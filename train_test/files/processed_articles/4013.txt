Research on the relationship between the\nuse of humor and different forms of learning spans several\ndecades (Kaplan & Pascoe, 1977; Matarazzo, Durik, &\nDelaney, 2010). Although the body of research is significant,\nthere are several issues. First, some research was studied in a\nrestricted manner. For example, in the area of actual learning\n(specific leaning outcomes), most studies were limited to\nshort interventions, while only a few lasted an entire semes-\nter. The last researcher to conduct an extensive study lasting\nan entire semester was Ziv (1988). A second area of concern\ncenters on the number of humor resources on websites and\nwithin books not based on empirical evidence. These\nresources are often based on anecdotal evidence provided by\ninstructors resulting from individual humor experiences\nwithin the classroom and presented as instructional tech-\nissue concerns the different variables (e.g., gender) that play\na role in the relationship between humor and learning. For\nexample, in these studies, the gender of the instructor using\nhumor within the classroom was a factor in how humor was\nperceived by the average student and the impact of humor\nuse (Bryant, Comisky, Crane, & Zillmann, 1980; Van Giffen,\n1990). Few studies have looked at the gender of students in\nthis regard.\nTypes of Humor Used in Educational\nSettings\nTo gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relation-\nship humor might have with different types of learning, it is\nimportant to understand the kinds of humor used in educa-\ntional systems. A comprehensive study by Wanzer, Frymier,\nWojtaszczyk, and Smith (2006) found several appropriate\nand inappropriate uses of humor by teachers in the class-\nroom. For that study, participants were undergraduate stu-\ndents who were given open-ended questions and asked to\ndescribe an example of teachers' use of both appropriate and\ninappropriate humor within the classroom. Several catego-\nries of appropriate humor emerged. The categories included\nthe following: (a) related humor strategies or behaviors\nlinked to course material, (b) unrelated humor strategies or\nbehaviors not associated with course material, (c) self-dis-\nparaging humor directed at oneself, and (d) unintentional\nhumor that was considered spontaneous or unplanned. The\ninappropriate uses of humor that emerged were (a) disparag-\ning humor-targeting students (e.g., making fun of them in the\nclass), (b) disparaging humor-targeting others (e.g., making\n1University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nMoshe Machlev, School of Psychological Sciences, University of Northern\nEmail: nancy.karlin@unco.edu\nUnderstanding the Relationship Between\nDifferent Types of Instructional Humor\nand Student Learning\nMoshe Machlev1 and Nancy J.

Based on Wanzer's et al.\n(2006) findings, the current research examined the relation-\nship between the types of humor recognized by students\n(appropriate-relevant/in appropriate) and different educa-\ntional outcomes (perceived and actual learning/course grade)\nwith gender as a covariate.\nHumor and Learning\nShort-term interventions.Humor has been recognized as an\ninfluence on learning. Most of the initial research about humor\nwith a possible relationship to learning was done using short-\nterm interventions that mostly examined retention and recall.\nOne group of researchers (Hauck & Thomas, 1972) looked at\nincidental and intentional associative learning. Intentional\nlearning was defined as learning that was sought, while inci-\ndental learning occurred by was not sought. These researchers,\nusing elementary schoolchildren, discovered humor influences\nretention when learning was incidental. Kaplan and Pascoe\n(1977) proceeded by using three types of humor in a lecture:\nhumorous examples related to the concepts in the lecture (con-\ncept humor), unrelated to the concepts (non-concept humor), or\na combination of concept and non-concept examples (mixed\nhumor). Their study examined retention and comprehension of\nmaterial immediately after the lecture and 6 weeks later. These\nresearchers found immediate comprehension was not influ-\nenced by the use of humor. However, retention of concept\nhumor related material significantly improved after 6 weeks.\nTo further investigate the influence of humor on a specific type\nof learning, Clabby (1979) had participants select nouns and\nnon-nouns. When participants selected nouns, their choice was\nfollowed with cartoons that were humorous. When participants\nselected non-nouns, non-humorous cartoons followed. It was\nfound that humor did influence learning, especially for partici-\npants low in creativity.\nSnetsinger and Grabowski (1994) also examined the\neffect of humorous and non-humorous learning. These\nauthors considered two types of learning in the context of a\ncomputer-based instructional (CBI) lesson on tick identifica-\ntion (i.e., ticks that cause Lyme disease). They found that\nthere were no differences between the two groups (humor\nand non-humor) when it came to learning, retention, or\nenjoyment. The authors report a difference between the\nhumor groups when it came to being worried about ticks\nwith the humorous group being more worried about ticks\nthan the group learning in a non-humorous manner.\nDuring the same period, Schmidt (1994) looked at mem-\nory for humorous and non-humorous versions of sentences.\nHe found sentences containing humor were remembered bet-\nter than non-humorous sentences. This was true with both\nfree- and cued-recall, and also with measures of word and\nsentence recall. Garner (2006) examined the impact of cur-\nriculum-specific humor on retention and recall. He found a\npositiveimpactoncontentretention.Hackathorn,Garczynski,\nBlankmeyer, Tennial, and Solomon (2012) discovered the\nuse of humor significantly increased students'overall perfor-\nmance on exams, predominantly on knowledge and compre-\nhension quiz items, but not on application items. The prior\nbody of research has proven significant but since there was\nan emphasis on short-term interventions, a need to examine\nthese issues over a semester period was needed.\nSemester-long interventions. The first comprehensive study\nthat was not a short-term intervention about the influence\nof humor on learning, and examined overall actual learning\n(student's final grade in a course) was done by Ziv (1988).\nIn this study, instructors completed a seminar about the use\nof humor in the classroom, and at the end of the seminar,\ninstructors judged to have the \"best\" type of humor were\nchosen to teach a statistics class. The instructors taught one\nclass throughout a semester using three pre-determined jokes\nin each and every class period. Instructors taught another\nsection in the exact way but without the use of humor. At the\nend of the semester, all students took a multiple-choice exam\non the material studied throughout the semester. Those stu-\ndents who studied in the humorous section achieved higher\ngrades on the final test than students in the non-humorous\nsection. This author replicated the study (using an introduc-\ntory psychology class) with similar robust findings (Ziv,\n1988). However, much of the research following Ziv did not\nconduct a semester-long study of the relationship between\nhumor and learning (Hackathorn et al., 2012).\nStudents' perception of instructors' use of humor.Several\nresearchers have taken a different approach and examined\nhow students perceive instructors' use of humor and its influ-\nence on learning. According to Kher, Molstad, and Donahue\n(1999), humor can be a part of the classroom because humor\ncreates an atmosphere of respect between students and the\nteacher. When the students feel safe, they revel in the learning\nprocess. Conkell, Imwold, and Ratliffe (1999) examined the\neffects of humor in learning fitness concepts and students'\nperceptions of a teacher who used relevant humor while\nteaching. They had students view either a humorous or non-\nhumorous lecture on body composition and weight control\nvia videotape. Later the researchers asked the students about\nthe content and delivery of the lecture. They discovered with\nregard to content examination, there was little difference\nbetween the humorous and non-humorous groups. Students\nwere more accepting of the instructor that incorporated humor\ninto the lecture. In addition, students in the humorous group\nwere more motivated to increase personal fitness levels.\nOther studies have found a robust association between humor\nFew studies examined both constructs (throughout an\nentire semester) in the same study with the same participants,\nmeaning, the relationship between actual learning and per-\nceived learning with humor that is used in the classroom. It is\nMachlev and Karlin 3\nof interest to examine in one study with the same students: if\nthere is a relationship between humor and the perceived learn-\ning of the students and the actual learning, if there is a relation-\nship between humor and only one of those constructs, or if\nthere is no relationship at all between humor and those two\nconstructs. A certain finding can indicate whether the use of\nhumor in the classroom is related to only one type of learning,\nto both, or to none of those. In addition, the Ziv (1988) studies\nonly included one measure of evaluation (exams), the measur-\ners in this study included different course requirements such as\nquizzes, papers, participation, attendance, extra credit assign-\nments, and research-related requirements.\nGender and humor. When it comes to the classroom, previous\nresearch has shown that male teachers use humor signifi-\ncantly more often than female teachers, with women in small\nclasses being especially unlikely to use humor (Crawford &\nMacLeod, 1990). Previous research about instructor gender\nand humor in the classroom also suggested differences\nbetween the perceptions of humor for males and females. If\nthe instructor was a male using humor, humor positively\nrelated to appeal, delivery, and teaching effectiveness. If the\ninstructor was a female, only the use of hostile humor was\nassociated with enhanced appeal. However, use of some non-\nhostile forms of humor was associated with a loss of appeal\na male teacher using non-tendentious humor and a female\nteacher using tendentious humor are perceived as more self-\nprotective than helpful. A male teacher using no humor is\nperceived as more forthright and truthful than the same\nteacher using either tendentious or non-tendentious humor.\nVan Giffen (1990) reported ratings by students of their\ninstructor's sense of humor was a better predictor of how the\nstudent would rate the instructor on course evaluations, if the\ninstructor was a female rather than a male. Prior research is not\nconclusive for whether a difference exists if the student is\nfemale or male, when it comes to humor as an instructional\ntechnique and its relationship with different educational out-\ncomes. Older findings imply if the instructor was male, a favor-\nable view is reported. However, in more recent times, it seems\nthat this perception has changed. In some instances, female\ninstructors are viewed more favorable when using humor.\nBut the research about the gender of the students and how\nthe use of humor by the instructor might have relationship\nwith perceived or actual learning is not comprehensive.\nThere is a significant body of research, however, about the\ndifferences between the genders in regard to humor outside\nof the classroom. When it comes to gender and humor, some\nresearchers found differences between the genders in the per-\nception of humor. Jackson and Jackson (1997) had male and\nfemale participant's rate jokes with either a male initiator/\nfemale joke or vice versa. They found that the gender of the\njoke target made no difference for the male participants.\nJokes with male targets had a significantly higher rating than\njokes with female targets, when the participants were female.\nResearch Questions\nThe literature review that was presented illustrates that study\nof the relationship between humor and learning was either\nstudied in the form of short-term interventions without con-\nsidering the gender of the students, and there is no one study\nto be found that examined both the relationship between dif-\nferent types of humor and perceived and actual learning\nthrough an entire academic semester. It is of interest to exam-\nine whether those two types of learning both have a relation-\nship with different types of humor in the same study using\nthe same participants and with the same kind of circum-\nstances (course content).\nIn this study, the perceived learning of students was mea-\nsured by how much they felt that they learned in the course\nand actual learning as measured by their final grade in the\ncourse. The study sought college students as participants.\nThe main reason for selecting college students is that humor\nis more developed in this cohort as compared with those in\nearly childhood (McGhee, 1983). When looking at college\nage humor, different types of humor are more understandable\nand can have a stronger relationship compared with earlier\nyears where sense of humor is less developed. Childhood\nhumor might demonstrate a lower familiarity with various\ntypes of humor along with no formal preference for different\ntypes of humor. The present study also examined whether\nthere were differences between the genders for student par-\nticipants in predicting different educational outcomes by dif-\nferent types of humor.\nResearch Question 1: Which type of humor would have\na positive relationship with the educational outcomes for\nperceived and actual learning?\nHypothesis 1: The use of relevant and appropriate humor\nwill have a positive relationship with perceived learning\ntion was examined with each type of learning and the dif-\nferent types of humor separately.\nHypothesis 2: The use of non-relevant humor will not\nhave a positive relationship with actual learning (Ziv,\nResearch Question 2: Would gender moderate the rela-\ntionship for type of humor with the different types of\nlearning (perceived and actual)?\nHypothesis 3: There will be a difference between genders\non the relationship of different types of humor with differ-\nent educational outcomes (Jackson & Jackson, 1997).\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants were students who enrolled in an introductory\npsychology class at a medium size public university located\nin the rocky mountain region with approximately 90 stu-\ndents enrolled in each section. The course is a liberal arts\n4 SAGE Open\nelective. Students were required to either participate in stud-\nies to receive credits or write a paper instead. Based on a\npower analysis conducted with G*Power 3.1 software (Faul,\nticipants was required for this study with an effect size of\ndictors. Table 1 provides descriptive characteristics of\nparticipants.\nProcedures\nParticipants were recruited by using the computerized\nrecruiting pool. All participants were students taking one of\nseveral introductory psychology class. Different instructors\ntaught the various sections of this format similar course. The\ndepartment requires all instructors to use the same textbook\nand teach the same assigned topics. In the study, there were\nparticipants from all seven sections of a general psychology\ncourse offered during a semester. Six different instructors\ntaught these sections (one instructor taught two sections).\nParticipants were invited to answer the study questions in\na lab setting with approximately 1 month left in the academic\nsemester. After completion of the consent process and agree-\ning to participate in the study, participants were asked to\ncomplete questions on perceived learning and their instruc-\ntor's sense of humor. Verbal instructions for each survey\nalong with a copy of the informed consent were provided.\nStudent final grades were obtained at the completion of the\nsemester.\nInstrumentation\nDemographic measure.Using a self-report questionnaire,\ndemographic information was collected to describe the sam-\nple characteristics of the groups. This instrument included\nquestions about participant age, gender, ethnicity, major,\nminor, academic year, cumulative grade point average, and\ncourse specifics (e.g., course title, instructor's name).\nHumor measure. To examine humor use by the instructor, a\nquestionnaire was developed. The questionnaire was devel-\noped using humor items recognized by Wanzer et al. (2006).\nFor example, participants were asked of how frequently their\ninstructor used relevant humor, non-relevant humor, appro-\npriate humor, inappropriate humor, offensive humor, self-\ndeprecating humor, self-deprecating others types of humor,\nand spontaneous humor. Questions about relevant and non-\nrelevant humor were asked 3 times by varying the wording\nso as to examine reliability. Students were asked the\nfollowing:\nHow often does your instructor use humor that is relevant to the\ntopic?\nHow often does your instructor use humor that promotes\nunderstanding of the topic?\nHow often does your instructor use humor that is related to the\ncourse content? How often does your instructor use humor that\nis NOT relevant to the topic?\nHow often does your instructor use humor that does NOT\npromote understanding of the topic?\nHow often does your instructor use humor that is NOT related to\nthe course content?\nHow often does your instructor use humor that is appropriate?\nBy appropriate we mean: you feel comfortable with the sense of\nhumor being used.\nHow often does your instructor NOT use humor that is\nappropriate?\nHow often does your instructor use self-disparaging humor to\nlaugh about oneself?\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics (N = 195).\nVariable Level Frequency Percent\nMajor Athletic\nadministration\nMachlev and Karlin 5\nHow often does your instructor use disparaging humor, i.e.,\ntargeting students by making fun of them in the class?\nHow often does your instructor use humor that is spontaneous\nand unplanned?\nHow often does the instructor use disparaging humor-targeting\nothers (e.g., making fun of a celebrity)?\nHow often does your instructor use offensive humor (e.g., sexual\njokes)?\nPossible answers for the questions were as follows: never,\nless than once a class period, once or twice a class period,\nand more than once or twice a class period. Answers were\ngiven a number ranging from zero through four.\nPerceived learning measure.This measure for the current\nstudy asked students to reflect on how much they believed\nthey learned in the course. A Likert-type scale was used to\nmeasure this perception. The measure asked the following\nquestion: When thinking about PSY 120 (Principles of Psy-\nchology), how much would you say that you learned from\nthe instructor in your class? Possible answers were as fol-\nlows: (a) I did not learn at all; (b) I learned a little bit; (c) I\nlearned something not too little, but not too much; (d) I\nlearned a lot.\nActual learning measure.The student's final grade in the\ncourse, reported by the instructor, served as the actual learn-\ning measure for the study. Participants consented to the\nrelease of this information.\nAnalysis\nData analysis was conducted using SPSS version 22. Factor\nanalysis was conducted to determine the number of humor\ntypes loaded together. In addition, a reliability analysis was\nconducted to examine the types of humor that factored\ntogether. The study examined the relationship between\nstudy variables (using Spearman's rho correlation) and pre-\ndiction of normally distributed dependent variables using\nmultiple regression. An interaction between gender and the\ntypes of humor as predictors was also examined.\nResults\nDescriptive and Correlational Statistics\nTable 1 provides a breakdown of participant characteristics. In\nshort, the study consisted of 195 undergraduate students, there\nwere 205 participants who filled out surveys but 10 were elim-\n40% male). The age of these participants ranged from 18 to 25,\nparticipants were first year students, 24 (12.3%) were second\nindicated being in at least their fourth year of undergraduate\neducation. The most reported academic majors were business\nPacific Islander or Native Hawaiian; most of the participants\n(85.6%) received a course grade of C- or better. Table 2 pro-\nvides averages for humor types, as well as correlational statis-\ntics between humor types and educational outcomes. The\naverage course grade for each section is as follows (on a scale\nthe same instructor. Participants from these two sections were\nsubmitted with no section identifiers.\nAn Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) using the\nMaximum Likelihood extraction methods with a varimax\n(oblique) rotation method for the different questions about\nhumor types was conducted on data gathered from the\nsame 195 participants. First, all of the humor styles were\nentered; at this point, four major factors emerged. Factor 1\nincluded the three items that asked about relevant humor in\nthree different ways (using the words: relevant, promotes\nunderstanding, and related) and two additional items that\nasked about spontaneous humor and appropriate humor.\nFactor 2 included the three items that asked about non-\nrelevant humor (using the words: not relevant, does not\npromote understanding, and not related). Factor 3 included\none item that asked about self-disparaging humor, and one\nitem that asked about disparaging others (students). Those\nitems had a low factor loading. Factor 4 included three\nitems. One item asked about relevant humor, one about\nappropriate humor, and one item about offensive humor.\nTwo of those items (relevant humor and appropriate\nhumor) cross-loaded with the first factor loading, but with\nweaker value. Factors 1 and 2 showed the most significant\nvalues (more than .70).\nThe spontaneous humor item had a low loading on the\nfirst factor loading and was dropped. With this item dropped,\nall of the relevant humor items loaded with one another.\nAppropriate humor also loaded with the three questions that\nasked about relevant humor. All of the non-relevant humor\nitems also loaded together. This resulted in a two-factor solu-\ntion: related/appropriate humor and non-related humor.\nReliability for the four items measuring related/appropriate\nhumor was .90, and reliability for the three items measuring\nnon-relative humor was .78. Table 3 displays results for the\noblique rotation. The first factor had an eigenvalue of 3.16,\nand it accounted for 45.21% of the variance in the data.\nFactor 2 had an eigenvalue of 2.11 and accounted for a fur-\nThus, two humor types were considered in the remaining\nportion of this article (relevant/appropriate and non-relevant).\n6 SAGE Open\nIt is worth mentioning that negatively worded items might fall\ninto the same factor and should be considered alongside study\nresults.\nPrimary Analyses\nSubsequent analyses examined the different research ques-\ntions. For each research question, several regression analyses\nwere conducted with different independent and dependent\nvariables and moderating variables.\nResearch Questions\nThe first question asked, \"Which type of humor (relevant/\nappropriate non-relevant) would have a positive type of rela-\ntionships with the educational outcomes of perceived learn-\ning and actual learning?\" And the second research question\nasked, \"Would gender moderate the relationship of the types\nof humor with the different educational outcomes (perceived\nand actual learning)?\"\nA linear regression was conducted. In Step 1, gender was\nentered; in Step 2, the humor types of relevant/appropriate\nand non-relevant were entered; and in Step 3, the interactions\nof each humor type with gender were entered. Interactions\nwere entered separately for each of the educational outcomes\nafter variables were centered.\nPerceived learning. In Step 1, with just gender as a predictor,\np < .13. Gender did not significantly predict perceived learn-\ning. In Step 2, with the two humor types entered, the model\nexplained 25.4% of the variance. There was statistically sig-\nappropriate humor significantly predicted perceived learning\n( = .50, p < .00), but non-relevant humor was not a signifi-\ncant predictor ( = -.10, p = .10). In Step 3, the gender by\nhumor type interactions were entered. There was not a statis-\ntically significant change in r2 (p = .79) and none of the inter-\nactions predicted perceived learning. Table 4 presents these\nresults.\nActual learning. In Step 1, with just gender as a predictor, the\n.03. Gender significantly predicted actual learning ( = .14,\np < .00). In Step 2, with the two humor types entered, the\nmodel explained 3.8% of the variance. There was no signifi-\npriate did not predict actual learning ( = -.11, p = .12), and\nneither did non-relevant humor ( = .09, p = .21). In Step 3,\nthe gender by humor type interactions were entered. There\nwas no statistically significant change in r2 (p = .33), and\nnone of the interactions predicted actual learning (Table 5).\nDiscussion\nThe relationship between different forms of humor and dif-\nferent types of learning is an important question. Humor is\nused within the classroom in various ways (Wanzer et al.,\n2006) with some instructors using humor as an instructional\ntechnique (Lundberg & Thurston, 2002). Accordingly, it was\nof interest to examine the relationship of different types of\nhumor with perceived and actual learning. It was also of\ninterest to examine possible mediating factors. Gender was\nchosen as a factor to be examined, due to the fact that there is\nnot a significant amount of research in this area (Jackson &\nTable 2. Correlational Statistics Between the Different Humor Types and the Educational Outcomes.\nDescriptive statistics\nPredictors N M Minimum Maximum SD\nCorrelations\nTable 3. Summary of Exploratory Factor Analysis Results for the\nTwo Humor Types Using Maximum Likelihood Estimation With\nRotated Factor Matrix\n Factor\nMachlev and Karlin 7\nJackson, 1997). With the educational system divided into dif-\nfering levels (elementary, middle school, high school, col-\nlege), university/college students were chosen as the focus\nfor the potential toward a greater understanding of humor\ntypes and individual preference.\nWith regard to the four measures of humor, factor analy-\nses revealed appropriate and relevant humor loaded together\nwith the only reliable types of humor being relevant/appro-\npriate and non-relevant. Accordingly, only two types of\ninstructor humor were evaluated. It was found that certain\ntypes of humor were positively related to certain educational\noutcomes. The analysis suggests that the use of relevant/\nappropriate humor by an instructor predicts higher levels of\nperceived learning.\nAppropriate humor is the type of humor students feel\ncomfortable with and can predict positive emotions among\nstudents. Appropriate humor was positively associated with\nperceived learning. The current study found the more appro-\npriate humor used, the higher perceived learning reported by\nstudents. According to Instructional Humor Processing\nTheory (IHPT), if there is a positive affect, the message\nenhances student ability to process information with reports\nof learning and retention occurring (Wanzer, M. B., Frymier,\nA. B., & Irwin). For the current study, relevant humor posi-\ntively correlates with perceived learning. This affirms IHPT\n(Wanzer et al., 2010), which suggests instructors who use\nrelated humor during a course promote learning in a positive\nmanner. For the current study, students report the more\ninstructors use relevant humor, the more students believe\nthey learned from the instructor in the course. Therefore,\nhumor may relate to the perceived learning of students for\nthat specific course.\nThere may be no relationship between different types of\nhumor and actual learning, this may suggest that the use of\nhumor by an instructor does not directly contribute to higher\nlevels of actual learning. In previous studies, a relationship\nbetween types of humor and actual learning was found (Ziv,\n1988). Perhaps in the current study, humor was not targeted\nin the same deliberative manner as in the Ziv study where\nspecific jokes were chosen so as to relate to course materials\nTable 4. Perceived learning by using gender and the two humor types.\nPredictor B SE b  R2 f 2\nTable 5. Actual Learning by Using Gender and the Two Humor Types.\nPredictor B SE b  R2 f 2\n8 SAGE Open\nand used throughout the entire semester. In the present\nstudy, the type of humor used varied and not all related to\ncourse materials. Also, the current study incorporated more\nmeasures of actual learning by comparison, while the Ziv\nstudy used the final exams as actual learning and integrated\nthree purposeful types of humor. These variations may have\naffected why different conclusions are drawn from Ziv\nThere were no differences in the classroom between\nmales and females in the manner in which different types\nof humor related to different educational outcomes. It may\nbe that because of the similar experiences for both males\nand females, similar humor preferences allow for similar\nimpressions.\nRecommendations\nThere are three specific recommendations resulting from the\npresent study. First, relevant/appropriate humor correlated\nwith perceived learning in a positive manner. This indicates\nspecific types of humor used in the classroom are associated\nwith higher levels of student perceived learning. If instruc-\ntors use humor that is relevant and appropriate in the class-\nroom, it may contribute to higher levels of perceived learning\nfor that specific course and for those specific students.\nSecond, there were no differences in the classroom between\nmales and females in the manner in which different types of\nhumor related to different types of learning. It may be that\nbecause of the similar experiences for both males and\nfemales, similar humor preferences will allow for similar\nimpressions. Third, when taking into account the Ziv (1988)\nstudy, actual learning can have a relationship with different\ntypes of humor. This may be the case if humor is specific to\ncourse material and targeted in such way to emphasize that\nspecific information.\nLimitations\nThe present study is of value in understanding the use of\ninstructor humor within the college classroom. However,\nthere are several limitations. The first limitation of this study\nis that this was not a cause and effect study, and the author\ncould not conclude the use of humor will result in higher or\nlower levels of different types of learning. Future studies will\nwant to consider a cause and effect design.\nThe second limitation is the fact that all of the instructors\nwere female. This happened by chance. Instructors who\ntaught the class in the prior semester included both males and\nfemales. The original intention of the study was to examine\nboth the gender of students and teachers. However, because\nonly female instructors were teaching the course at the time\nof data collection, it was only possible to consider student\ngender. Future research needs to examine instructor-related\ngender issues.\nDirections for Future Research\nThe limitations presented in the previous section provide a\nroadmap to how the study was conducted. Suggestions for\npossible improvement toward gaining a more thorough\nunderstanding of the relationship between different types of\nhumor and specific types of learning are provided. There are\nat least two potential directions for future research.\nFirst, an experimental design should be used so research\ncan draw a cause and effect conclusions about the rela-\ntionship between different types of humor with different\ntypes of learning. Specifically, future research could test\nthe suggested causal relationship: relevant/appropriate\nhumor increases perceived learning and also the possible\nrelationship that was found in previous studies between\nrelevant humor and actual learning. Second, future\nresearch should continue to examine both female and male\ninstructors and their use of humor in the classroom. This\nmay shed light on whether there are additional differences\nin the manner in which humor is judged by students and\nits relationship with perceived and actual learning, if the\ninstructor is male or female.
