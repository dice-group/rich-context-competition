Multiple Roles, Frequency of\nActivities, and C-Reactive Protein\nSeoyoun Kim, MS,* and Kenneth F. Ferraro, PhD\nCenter on Aging and the Life Course and Department of Sociology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana.\n*Address correspondence to Seoyoun Kim, MS, Center on Aging and the Life Course and Department of Sociology, Purdue University,\nDecision Editor: Rachel Pruchno, PhD\nPurpose of the Study: The study investigates\nwhether productive activities by older adults reduce\nbodily inflammation, as indicated by C-reactive\nprotein (CRP), a biomeasure associated with the\nrisk of cardiovascular diseases. Design and\nMethods: The study uses a representative sur-\nvey of adults aged 57\u00ad85 from the National Social\nLife, Health, and Aging Project (N = 1,790). Linear\nregression models were used to analyze the effects\nof multiple roles (employment, volunteering, attend-\ning meetings, and caregiving) and the frequency\nof activity within each role on log values of CRP\nconcentration (mg/L) drawn from assayed blood\nsamples. Results: Number of roles for produc-\ntive activities was associated with lower levels of\nCRP net of chronic conditions, lifestyle factors, and\nsocioeconomic resources. When specific types of\nactivity were examined, volunteering manifested\nthe strongest association with lower levels of inflam-\nmation, particularly in the 70+ group. There was\nno evidence that frequent engagement in volunteer\nactivity was associated with heightened inflamma-\ntion. Implications: Productive activities--and\nfrequent volunteering in particular--may protect\nindividuals from inflammation that is associated\nwith increased risk of hypertension and cardiovas-\ncular disease.\nKey Words: Productive activities, Volunteering, Social\nparticipation, Acute-phase protein\nConsiderable research reveals that the vast\nmajority of older adults engage in productive activi-\nties, including employment, volunteering, and other\nforms of social participation (Morrow-Howell,\nHinterlong, & Sherraden, 2001). Productive activi-\nties refer to paid or unpaid actions that make a con-\nstructive contribution to community life (Herzog,\nKahn, Morgan, Jackson, & Antonucci, 1989),\nand many models of successful or optimal aging\nconsider them essential to well-being in later life\n(Rowe & Kahn, 1997). Indeed, productive activi-\nties are widely extolled as salutary, and consider-\nable research identifies that these activities can\nenhance mental (Li & Ferraro, 2005) and physical\nhealth (Morrow-Howell, Hinterlong, Rozario, &\nTang, 2003) and reduce mortality risk (Pynn\u00f6nen,\nT\u00f6rnmak\u00e4gas, Heikkinen, Rantanen, & Lyyra,\nDespite extensive scholarly interest examining\nproductive activities and health in later life, most\nstudies rely upon self-reported measures of health,\ndisability, or physician-diagnosed illnesses, each of\nwhich can be influenced by psychosocial resources\nor access to health care. One wonders whether\nproductive activities exert effects on subclinical\nmeasures of biological processes that are predictive\nof major disease outcomes. If the relationship\nexists, productive activities may be a palpable way\nto prevent the development and onset of chronic\ndisease.\nThe Gerontologist\nThis study attempts to explicate the \"upstream\"\nhealth protective effects of productive activities\nby studying a marker of biological risk in older\nadults. Specifically, we examine the link between\nproductive activities and C-reactive protein (CRP),\na measure of inflammation. CRP is a useful bio-\nmarker for this investigation because it typically\nrises in later life, and high levels of CRP are linked\nto cardiovascular diseases including heart attack\n(Crimmins & Vasunilashorn, 2011).The main aims\nof the article are twofold: (a) Identify the associa-\ntion between the number of roles for productive\nactivities and inflammation; and (b) systematically\nexamine whether the relationship between produc-\ntive activity and CRP varies by the frequency of\nengagement within each activity.\nProductive Activities and Health in Later Life\nConsiderable evidence supports the claim that\nproductive activity is beneficial to older adults'\nhealth. Research on successful aging pioneered by\nRowe and Kahn (1997) points to the importance\nof engaging in productive activities to maintain\nhealth and well-being. Productive activity is a sig-\nnificant element of maintaining health and func-\ntioning, distinct from social relations or general\nsocial embeddedness. Role theory has often been\nused to explicate the health benefits of produc-\ntive activities: volunteering or attending organ-\nized meetings provides individuals with a unique\nopportunity to hold a meaningful social role and\nremain similarly active in later life (Thoits, 2012).\nBecause most Americans subscribe to a busy ethic\nand strive to engage in meaningful roles (Ekerdt,\n1986), productive activities become a viable alter-\nnative for adults who typically experience multiple\nrole transitions in later life.\nPrevious research has used somewhat distinct\ndefinitions of productive activities to predict health\noutcomes. Volunteering and paid employment are\nmost commonly recognized as productive activities\nMatz-Costa, Besen, James, & Pitt-Catsouphes,\nthat volunteering is associated with well-being,\nwhether the outcome considered is depressive\nsymptoms (Li & Ferraro, 2005; Musick & Wilson,\nor hypertension (Tavares, Burr, & Mutchler, 2013).\nEmployment has similar health-promoting effects\nin that employed men and women show virtu-\nally no decline in self-rated health and physical\nfunctioning; however, healthier people are also\nmore likely to be employed (Ross & Mirowsky,\nCaregiving is also widely recognized as an\nimportant form of productive activity (Burr\n2013). The contribution of middle-aged and older\ncaregivers generates enormous benefits for the\nnation and for those served. Despite a large body\nof research documenting caregivers' depression\nand worse physical health (Pinquart & S\u00f6rensen,\n2003), some studies demonstrate that caregiving\nbehaviors may improve adults' well-being (Brown,\nNesse, Vinokur, & Smith, 2003). Moen, Robison,\nand Dempster-McClain (1995), however, found no\ndirect effects of concurrent or past caregiving on\nhealth.\nAlthough studied less frequently, community\nengagement is another component of productive\nactivity that may have health benefits. Community\nengagement includes a wide range of activities\nsuch as voting, attending community meetings,\nand contributing financially to or holding a leader-\nship position in a community organization (Burr,\nGlass, & Berkman, 2003). Some of these activities\nrequire a considerable investment of resources, but\nMendes De Leon and coworkers (2003) argue for\nthe importance of tapping activities in which older\nadults are commonly involved. Meeting attend-\nance is one of the more prevalent forms of com-\nmunity engagement for older adults, even though\nit requires a commitment of time and skills (Burr\net al., 2002). Few studies, however, have examined\nwhether meeting attendance has a salutary effect\non health in later life.\nHealth benefits from such roles in later life may\naccruefromthemeaningattachedtothem,including\nstatus, influence, and emotional gratification\nthe types of productive activity are profiled across\nthe life course, younger adults typically engage in\nroles that are related to their other statuses (e.g.,\nparent or employee), whereas older adults are\nmotivated by more intrinsic reasons such as their\nvalues in helping others or their interests in local\ncommunity (Herzog et al., 1989; Van Willigen,\n2000). Thus, the meanings and values associated\nwith nonobligatory roles may be more salutary to\nhealth than is the case for obligatory roles. If the\nperson feels generative by contributing to the well-\nbeing of others, the benefits are manifest in lower\nrisk of impairment in activities of daily living and\nmortality (Gruenewald, Liao, & Seeman, 2012;\nSeveral theoretical and empirical studies also\nsuggest that productive activities may be espe-\ncially beneficial for older adults. Role accumula-\ntion theory suggests that multiple role occupancy\nis relevant in older ages because reduction rather\nthan accumulation of roles becomes more com-\nmonplace in later life (Moen et al., 1995).\nEmpirical studies confirm this thesis. For instance,\nVan Willigen (2000) used longitudinal data to\ndemonstrate that older volunteers (aged 60 and\nolder) are more likely than younger adults to\nexperience additional psychological health ben-\nefits for each hour of participation. Also, Musick\nand Wilson (2003) reported that volunteering\nhad a negative effect on depressive symptoms for\nolder adults but not for those less than 65 years\nold. Because older adults may be more likely than\nyounger persons to derive a psychological benefit\nfrom productive activity, one wonders whether\nthe effect extends to physical health phenomena\nsuch as inflammatory processes.\nAdvancing the Literature\nThe literature on the health benefits of produc-\ntive activities in older adults has yielded several\nnotable discoveries. Perhaps most impressive is the\nbreadth of outcomes considered. Previous research\ndemonstrates that productive activities among\nolder adults are associated with better self-rated\nhealth (Hinterlong, Morrow-Howell, & Rozario,\nsymptoms (Thoits & Hewitt, 2001), and greater\nlife satisfaction (Baker, Cahalin, Gerst, & Burr,\n2005). Recent discoveries also reveal that produc-\ntive activities reduce the risk of hypertension in\nAmericans (Tavares et al., 2013) and the risks of\ninstitutionalization and mortality in Finnish older\nadults (Pynn\u00f6nen et al., 2012). As Rowe and Kahn\n(1997) argue, productive activities have distinc-\ntive health benefits because they provide not only\na sense of belonging to a group with whom one\nshares common interests and activities but also a\nunique chance to hold social roles that give pur-\npose and meaning to life (Thoits, 2012). Building\non the contributions of previous research demon-\nstrating the health benefits of productive activities,\nwe articulate three ways to advance the current\nbody of research.\nFirst, most studies of productive activities rely\non self-reported measures of physical and mental\nhealth. Although self-reported measures are widely\naccepted as valid, investigations are warranted\nthat examine the influence of productive activi-\nties on biological measures, which are harbingers\nof subsequent health problems. Indeed, the power\nof using biomarkers in health research is the early\ndetection of bodily risks that might not yet register\nclinically.\nCRP, produced in the liver, is a useful biomarker\nbecause it indicates systemic levels of inflamma-\ntion and is linked to risk of heart attack, stroke,\nand mortality (Crimmins & Vasunilashorn, 2011).\nCRP is related to some modifiable cardiovascular\nrisk factors such as smoking, physical activity, and\nobesity (McDade, Hawkley, & Cacioppo, 2006)\nbut is also inversely related to social integration:\nMaintaining ties to a larger community and hav-\ning close and supportive relationships are related\nlowering chronic inflammation (Loucks, Berkman,\nGruenewald, & Seeman, 2006). Accordingly, CRP\npresents an important and novel way to explore\nlinks between productive activities and physical\nhealth in older adults.\nProductive activities may, in fact, lower older\nadults' inflammation through multiple pathways,\nparticularly when they select the role.One potential\npathway involves stimulating healthier responses\nto environmental challenges or stressors. Indeed,\nan observational study showed that social integra-\ntion is related to quicker cardiovascular recovery\nfrom a day's exertions (Evans & Steptoe, 2001).\nPerhaps productive activities are similarly benefi-\ncial by improving bodily response to stressors, but\nwe are unaware of any studies that examine the\nlink between productive activity and CRP.\nSecond, though the majority of existing research\nexamines a single indicator of productive activity,\nsome studies point to the importance of consid-\nering a more complex picture of individuals who\nremain active (Baker et al., 2005; Hinterlong,\n2008). Because concurrent engagement in multiple\nactivities is common, failure to consider multiple\nroles may be misleading because the purported\nsalubrious effects of productivity activities might\nbe due to a related role that is not measured.\nThird, though multiple roles may be beneficial\nto health, the level of involvement in each role\nmay be consequential to the purported health\nbenefits (Matz-Costa et al., 2013). Scholarship\non volunteering also points to how burnout or\novercommitment can lead to termination of the\nvolunteer role or unfavorable health outcomes (Li\ncan manifest itself on inflammation in two ways.\nFirst, high level of time commitment in productive\nactivities may offset the purported benefits (i.e.,\ndiminishing returns). Second, and more generally,\nit raises the question of whether the health benefits\nof productive activities accrue primarily by regular\nengagement in one role, modest engagement in\nmultiple roles, or some combination of both.\nA longitudinal study of older adults included\nmultiple roles, suggesting that both the number of\nroles and the amount spent engaging in each role\nare significant predictors of happiness (Baker et al.,\n2005).The current investigation examines both the\nnumber of productive activities performed by older\nadults and the frequency of participation within\neach type of activity in predicting levels of CRP.\nDrawn from the extant literature,we specify four\nhypotheses to guide the analysis. First, we hypoth-\nesize that older adults reporting more roles of\nproductive activity will have lower levels of inflam-\nmation, measured by C-reactive protein. Second,\nwe hypothesize that the frequency of participation\nwithin a role is negatively related to CRP. Testing\nthe first two hypotheses leads us to specify a third\nthat may be referred to as a role overload hypoth-\nesis: The health benefits of productive activities\naccrue until the person reaches very high levels of\nparticipation in multiple roles (interaction hypoth-\nesis). Fourth, given that other studies reveal that\nolder adults are more likely than younger adults\nto reap health benefits from productive activity, we\nhypothesize that the effect of productive activities\non CRP is stronger for adults 70 or older than for\nthose who have not yet reached 70 (interaction\nMethod\nSample\nThe study used data from the National Social\nLife, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), a nation-\nally representative, population-based sampling\nthe United States. In order to ensure representa-\ntion of particular groups, the sample includes an\noversampling by age, race, and gender. Additional\ninformation on the NSHAP sample is available in\na report by O'Muircheartaigh, Eckman, and Smith\n(n = 2,494) was selected to undergo whole blood\nresponse rate) provided usable samples.The reasons\nfor eliminating cases include refusal, equipment\nproblem, and insufficient volume of blood. As is\nstandard in the literature, 136 additional cases\nwith very high CRP levels (>8.6mg/L), which may\nbe indicative of inflammatory response to acute\nconditions such as cold, flu, or injury, were dropped\nfrom the analyses (Herd, Karraker, & Friedman,\n2012). Regardless, sensitivity tests demonstrated\nno meaningful differences in the pattern of findings\nwhen including the highest CRP values. Finally,\n13 cases with missing information for race or\nemphysema were excluded because the number of\nthese cases is small. The final analytic sample size\nMeasurement\nCRP Concentration.--During the interview, a\nblood sample was collected via a fingerstick and\ndisposable lancet and applied to filter paper for\ntransport and storage. The blood spot assays were\nconducted at the Laboratory for Human Biology\nResearch at Northwestern University (Williams &\ndistribution of CRP, values were transformed for\nthe statistical analyses (natural logarithm; Herd\nProductive Activities.--Four productive activi-\nties were examined: employment, volunteering,\nattending meetings, and caregiving. We created a\nbinary variable for each role and summed them to\ncreate number of roles (range from 0 to 4).\nThe frequency of activity was assessed by\nitems asking respondents how often they engage\nin each activity. For employment, respondents\nreported the number of hours they typically work\nduring 1 week. We defined those who work 40hr\nor more a week as full-time workers. Additional\nanalyses examined alternative thresholds for\nfull-time employment, but the conclusions were\nunchanged. For volunteering, respondents were\nasked how often they volunteered for religious,\ncharitable, political, health-related, or other\norganizations in the past 12 months. Responses\nranged from never (0) to several times a week (6).\nUsing the same response categories as for volun-\nteering, respondents were also asked about their\nfrequency of attending meetings of any organized\ngroups. Consistent with prior studies, meeting\nattendance is used as a measure of community\nengagement--a component of productive activity\n(Burr et al., 2002). Finally, respondents were\nasked whether they are currently assisting an\nadult who needs help with day-to-day activities\nbecause of age or disability. If answered yes, they\nwere then probed how many days per week they\ntypically spend caring for this person. The origi-\nnal response ranged from 0 to 7 days. However,\nbecause only eight individuals answered that they\nspend 5 days on caregiving, we combined 5 and\n6 days. The final response categories ranged from\n0 to 6, consistent with volunteering and attend-\ning meetings.\nAdditional Covariates.--In addition to pro-\nductive activities, several covariates were included\nbecause of their association with chronic inflam-\nmation (Schafer & Ferraro, 2011). Age is coded\nin years, and sex is dichotomized with 1 indi-\ncating female. Race was divided into a series of\nbinary variables (White, Black, and other race)\nwith non-Hispanic White serving as the refer-\nence group. Other race consisted of Hispanic\nAmericans, Native Americans, Asian or Pacific\nIslander, and those identifying themselves as\nmultiracial. (Whereas most Hispanic Americans\nidentified as \"other\" race, supplementary analy-\nses distinguishing them were estimated but the\nvariable was nonsignificant in all specifications.)\nMarital status was also dichotomized with 1\nindicating married or cohabiting with a partner.\nTo tap socioeconomic resources, four categories\nof educational attainment (less than high school,\nhigh school, some college, and B.S. or more) and\na binary variable for low wealth were included in\nthe analyses. For wealth, participants were asked\nto estimate their net worth including all of their\ninvestment, properties, and other financial assets\nminus debt. Then a binary variable was created\ndifferentiating respondents in the lowest 20%\nof the household net worth from those in the\nFor lifestyle variables known to be related\nto CRP, we use self-reported information.\nParticipants who reported as currently smoking\ncigarettes, pipes, cigars, or chewing tobacco were\nclassified as current tobacco users. Physical activity\nwas measured with an item probing respondents'\nengagement in physical activities such as walking,\ndancing, or exercise (0 = never, 1 = once a month,\n2 = one to three times a month, 3 = one to two\ntimes a week, 4 = three or more times per week).\nObese individuals were identified with body mass\nThe analysis adjusts for physical and mental health\nconditions that may be related to CRP. For mental\nhealth, we also included depressive symp\ntoms based\non the 11-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies\nDepression Scale (Cronbach's  = .93). Clinically\nrelevant chronic health conditions include dummy\nvariables for whether the respondent was ever diag\nnosed by a physician for emphysema, asthma, and\ndiabetes. Given the documented inverse relationship\nbetween lipid-lowering treatment and CRP (McDade\net al., 2006), lipid medication use was also included\nin the analyses, measured with a binary variable.\nSupplementary analyses considered additional covari\nates such as income, antihypertensive medicine use,\nand self-reported physical and mental health. These\nwere omitted then from the final analyses, however,\nbecause they were nonsignificant in multivariate\nspecifications.\nAnalyses\nAnalyses used ordinary least-squares (OLS)\nregression to model the natural log of CRP. We\nspecified separate models to examine number of\nproductive activities and frequency within each\nactivity, as well as their joint effects. In addition\nto an additive model with the independent varia-\nbles, multiplicative models were estimated to test\ninteractions between the number of roles and fre-\nquency of productive activity. We also tested the\nrobustness of our results in two supplementary\nanalyses: (a) OLS regression predicting raw CRP\nvalues and (b) ordinal logistic regression with\nordinal CRP as others have done (Sesso et al.,\n2003). Because CRP has clinical cutoffs that lend\nthemselves to logistic regression (<1, 1\u00ad2.99, and\n3mg/L), we used the three-category classification\nof CRP as the outcome variable in supplemen-\ntary analyses. The results from the ordinal logis-\ntic regression are provided in the Supplementary\nMaterial, but we focus on the OLS results in\nthe text.\nWe handled missing values on variables by\ncases, 294 of which were missing information on\nvolunteering variable. We imputed five values for\neach missing observation, averaged the coefficients\nand calculated new standard errors that account\nfor the variation across multiple potential imputed\nvalues (Rubin, 2004). We used all the information\navailable to impute for missing data on independ-\nent variables but did not impute for the outcome\nResults\nTable 1 displays the descriptive statistics for\neach variable, and the mean CRP level of 2.08 is\nregarded as average risk (>3 indicates high risk).\nMost NSHAP respondents engaged in two to three\nproductive activities, with the largest proportion\nengaging in meeting attendance (69.1%, distribu-\ntion not shown) and the lowest proportion in car-\nthe sample; 31.9% of the sample was employed.\nNote that more than one third of the entire sample\nhas a body mass index  30.\nTurning to Table 2, the Model 1 results reveal\nthat each role of productive activity is associated\nadjusting for all control variables. Women and\nBlack respondents generally had higher levels\nof CRP, and higher educational attainment was\nassociated with lower CRP. Of the lifestyle fac-\ntors, tobacco use and obesity were associated with\nhigher CRP, and physical activity was associated\nwith lower CRP. Given the gender differences,\nwe estimated supplementary models stratified by\ngender but the substantive results were similar. In\norder to further examine possible confounding\neffects of lipid medication on productive activity\nand CRP, we conducted supplementary analyses\nwith and without the lipid medication variable,\nand the conclusions were unchanged.\nIn Model 2, we examined the frequency of\nengaging in each productive activity while adjusting\nfor the covariates. Of the four types, only frequent\nvolunteering is associated with lower CRP (p < .05).\nThe other three types of productive activity were\nnot associated with CRP.\nThe effects of other control variables were simi-\nlar to the previous model.\nThe final OLS model includes both number of\nroles and frequency of each activity. The results\nshown in Model 3 reveal that the frequency of vol-\nunteering is associated with lower CRP, but num-\nber of roles is no longer significant. The results\nlend partial support for Hypothesis 2 stating that\nfrequency of participation within a role (i.e., vol-\nunteer) is negatively related to CRP.\nAs described earlier, we also estimated the\neffects of productive activities on three categories\nof CRP (Sesso et al., 2003); the results are pre-\nsented in the Supplementary Material. The pattern\nof results from the ordinal logistic regression is\nvery similar to those obtained with OLS. As shown\nin Model 3 in the Supplementary Material, a unit\ndifference in volunteering is associated with an 8%\nreduction in the odds of being in a higher category\nof inflammation (odds ratio = 0.92, confidence\nOur next step was to complete additional analy-\nses to examine the role overload hypothesis. We\ntested two specifications in the OLS analyses: (a)\nA quadratic term for overall frequency of produc-\ntive activities (to test for nonlinearity in the rela-\ntionship between frequency and CRP) and (b) an\ninteraction between the number of roles and the\nsum of activity frequency (across the four types).\nResults from both tests give no evidence that high\nlevels of engagement in multiple roles are detri-\nmental to health in older adults (results not shown\nbut available upon request).\nFinally, we tested for the hypothesis that the\nbenefits of productive activity are stronger for\nadults 70 years or older (OLS analysis). In doing\nso, we focused on volunteering frequency because\nthe results from previous analyses revealed that\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics for Variables, NSHAP\nRange\nMean or\nproportion (SD)\nProductive activities\nDemographic\nLifestyle factors\n Obese (body mass index\nDepressive symptoms (Center\nfor Epidemiologic Studies\nDepression Scale)\nChronic conditions\naOriginal value of C-reactive protein.\nvolunteering was the most consistent predic-\ntor of CRP. We first tested the interaction of age\ngroups and volunteer frequency on CRP. The result\nrevealed that the model with the interaction term\nwas a better fit than the model excluding the prod-\nuct term (F = 6.13, p = .01). Thus, we proceeded to\nfurther investigate the age differences. Stratifying\ndiscovered that the frequency of volunteering has\ndistinct effects on CRP in the two groups.Although\nfrequency of volunteering is associated with lower\nCRP, the effect is actually stronger for those 70 or\nolder. As shown in Figure 1, among people with\nlow levels of volunteering, CRP levels differed little\nby age group. By contrast, among persons engaged\nin frequent volunteering, CRP was lower among\nthe respondents 70 or older. People who are\n70\u00ad85 years of age and very active as volunteers\nexhibited lower CRP than persons aged 58\u00ad69\nwho were not very active as volunteers.\nThe test of Hypothesis 4 focused on volunteer-\ning--the most consistent predictor of CRP--but we\nconducted supplementary age-stratified analyses to\ndetermine whether the other forms of productive\nactivity were related to CRP in either age group.\nEven in the subsample < 70, the other forms of\nproductive activity (e.g., employment) were not\nrelated to CRP.\nDiscussion\nUsing nationally representative data from older\nadults, the current study showed that older peo-\nple engaged in more roles of productive activities\nreport lower CRP (Hypothesis 1). However, when\nboth frequency of participation and number of\nroles were considered simultaneously, frequency\nof participation in volunteering manifested the\nmost robust association with CRP (Hypothesis 2).\nThe findings are consistent with previous research\nshowing that volunteer activity improves various\nhealth outcomes (Morrow-Howell et al., 2003).\nVolunteering is associated with better health, pos-\nsibly through emotional gratification (Morrow-\nHowell et al., 2003), feelings of generativity\n(Gruenewald et al., 2012), and increases in social\nintegration (Loucks et al., 2006). Regularly engag-\ning in volunteering has a special way of getting\nTable 2. Ordinary Least-Squares Models Predicting in C-Reactive Protein in the NSHAP (n = 1,790)\nb SE b SE b SE\nProductive activities\nCovariates\nNote: Natural logarithm of C-reactive protein.\n\"under the skin,\" resulting in what appears as a\nyounger biological profile for inflammation.\nThe study extends the research on health bene-\nfits of volunteering and clarifies the need for inves-\ntigating not only self-reported measures of health\nbut also biomeasures. Doing so will aid further\nunderstanding of the mechanisms between produc-\ntive activities and health. The findings of this study\npoint to a specific type of productive activity--vol-\nunteering--as an agent for maintaining lower lev-\nels of chronic inflammation.\nThe analysis also yielded an intriguing finding\nrelated to age differences in the effects of productive\nactivities: frequent volunteering is particularly\nbeneficial on CRP among adults 70 years or\nolder (Hypothesis 4). NSHAP septuagenarians\nand octogenarians who were frequent volunteers\nhad lower CRP levels than comparably active\nvolunteers who were 58\u00ad69 years old. This finding\nshows that frequent volunteering benefits older\nadults in terms of having a \"younger\" biological\nprofile. Although our findings are based on CRP\nas the outcome, the conclusion is consistent with\nfindings of others that older people may reap more\npositive health benefits from volunteering than is\nthe case for adults of younger ages (Van Willigen,\n2000). Because it might be the case that younger\nand healthier individuals are more likely to be\nselected (or asked) into volunteering, we examined\nmean CRP levels in different age groups using a\ntwo-sample t-test. The results showed that mean\nCRP levels do not differ across these groups.\nThis study examined the effect of multiple roles\nof productive activity including volunteering,\nemployment, meeting attendance, and caregiving.\nThe results, however, showed clearly that volun-\nteering is the type of productive activity most likely\nto have health benefits.\nWe wondered whether the emphasis on volun-\nteering in prior studies may have neglected health\nbenefits from other forms of productive activity,\nbut the results from this study suggest otherwise.\nPerhaps some prior studies examined other forms\nof social activities but, like the present investiga-\ntion, found volunteering to be the most consequen-\ntial to health. Whatever the case, our findings add\nto the accumulated body of research demonstrating\nthat volunteering is distinctive in its health-giving\nproperties (Hinterlong et al., 2007; Li & Ferraro,\nWe also hypothesized that role overload\nmay nullify the purported health from produc-\ntive activity (i.e., when older people are highly\nengaged in many productive roles). We found\nno evidence for the role overload hypothesis\neven if people were very active in many roles\n(Hypothesis 3). Although our findings are con-\nsistent with much of the literature regarding the\noverall benefits of productive activity, we could\nnot replicate the adverse effect on health due to\na high time commitment to volunteering (Van\nWilligen, 2000). Perhaps the role overload thesis\napplies to other health outcomes, but not to CRP,\nCRP\nfreq of volunteering in past year\nFigure 1. C-reactive protein by frequency of volunteering, stratified by age groups (including adjustments for all control variables\nin Table 2).\nor it may be due to measurement issues described\nsubsequently.\nThis study is limited in important ways, and\none may be related to our inability to replicate\nthe adverse effects of very high time commitments\nin productive activities. Unlike other studies that\ncapture actual hours of productive activity, the\nmaximum value for productive activity in NSHAP\nis \"several times a week.\" In comparison to\naccumulated hours in an activity, this is a crude\nmeasure, perhaps resulting in a ceiling effect. We\nthought that seven categories of frequency in most\nof the productive activities, coupled with four roles,\nwould be sufficient to tap intense engagement in\nmultiple productive activities, but it would be\npreferable to have a more detailed measurement of\nfrequency within each role.\nSecond, the measurement of productive activity\nin the NSHAP is notably limited. When volunteer\nactivity is considered, the number of organizations\nand types of activities may have significant impli-\ncations on volunteers' health, but these are not\nassessed in the survey. We used the available meas-\nures to examine the research question but welcome\nfuture research with more complete measurement\nof productive activity. Community engagement is\nan important component of productive activity,\nbut our findings are limited by using one indicator:\nmeeting attendance. It would be very helpful for\nfuture studies to tap other indicators of commu-\nnity engagement such as voting, leadership roles,\nand financial contributions to community organi-\nzations. Studies that include a more comprehen-\nsive measurement of productive activity may prove\nespecially useful for explicating the mechanisms by\nwhich it is related to health.\nThird, a notable limitation of this study is the\ncross-sectional nature of the data, raising the con-\ncern that healthy individuals (low CRP) might be\nselected into participation in productive activi-\nties. Although the measurement of CRP obviously\noccurred after the productive activities reported in\nthe interview, it is still possible that health selec-\ntion is operant. To address this possible concern,\nwe accounted for health lifestyle factors, chronic\nconditions, and depressive symptoms--and the\nbenefits of productive activity on CRP remained\ndespite the inclusion of these variables and socio-\neconomic resources. Although we think the risk of\nreverse causality invalidating the results is quite\nlow, longitudinal tracking of productive activities\nand CRP would be especially helpful to check on\nthe conclusions presented herein.\nFinally,the sample comprised community-dwell-\ning adults, and the results cannot be generalized to\nthose living in assisted living, nursing homes, or\nother types of congregate facilities. Future research\nneeds to investigate whether older adults living in\nthese environments reap the same health benefits\nfrom productive activities as was observed for\ncommunity-dwelling adults in the NSHAP.\nIn sum, the study not only provides empiri-\ncal support to the generalization that volunteer\nactivity is beneficial to health, but it contributes\nto the literature by revealing that such health\nbenefits include lower inflammation. We are una-\nware of any previous study to report that produc-\ntive activity, especially volunteering, is associated\nwith lower CRP. Given that CRP generally rises\nwith age, the benefits of volunteering to coun-\nteract that trend are noteworthy. Moreover, we\nuncovered that the benefit of frequent volunteer-\ning was actually stronger for the oldest members\nof the sample, suggesting the health utility of sus-\ntained engagement in volunteer activities.\nSupplementary Material\nSupplementary material can be found at: http://gerontologist.oxford-\njournals.org.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by grants from the National Institute on\n"
