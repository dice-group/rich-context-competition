The main impediment to cross-country bank mergers is\ntypically seen in the heterogeneity of banking regulation and supervision in the European\nUnion that prevails despite the existing minimum harmonization.1 This paper, however,\nshows that more fundamental economic reasons might also prevent the formation of pan-\nEuropean banks.\nThe paper develops a model with different regions in which banks offer households de-\nposit contracts that provide them with an insurance against idiosyncratic liquidity shocks.\nSince the fraction of households facing a liquidity shock in each region is uncertain banks\ncannot fully diversify liquidity risks within a region. But banks can decide to operate in\nseveral regions in order to diversify regional liquidity risk. However, integrating several\nregions in one multiregional bank brings about the risk of contagion within the bank: a\nregional liquidity shortage in one region might exceed the excess liquidity generated in the\nremaining regions creating a liquidity shortage in the multiregional bank. Given that the\nnumber of regions is limited, regional risks are not fully diversifiable and the impact of a\nregional liquidity shock on the liquidity stance of a multinational bank does not become\nnegligible. Thus banks face a tradeoff when deciding about a cross-border penetration of\nthe retail market.\nThe paper shows that under fairly general assumptions banks choose to expand their\nbusiness to several but not all regions. Obviously, any system of cross regional financial\nintegration within a multinational bank can be supported by certain assumptions regard-\ning the correlation of regional liquidity shocks. However, this paper considers symmetric\nregions. This excludes positive or negative correlations of shocks across regions. But even\nin this case it is not necessarily optimal to have either a fully integrated or a nationally\nfragmented banking system.\nTo understand the intuition consider an economy with four regions and assume that\nif a liquidity shortage occurs in one region all other regions have an abnormal liquidity\nstance, i.e. have either a positive or a negative regional liquidity shock of the same size.\nIn this case it is always preferable for a bank to operate in at least two regions, because if\none region faces a liquidity shortage the second region could have an offsetting liquidity\nshock. If the second region is also hit by a negative liquidity shock the two regions are not\nworse off than if they were served by separate banks. Contagion does not occur in this case\n1Barros, Bergl\u00a8\nof, Fulghieri, Gual, Mayer, and Vives (2005) argue in their report on the integration of\nEuropean banking along these lines.\nwith a two regional merger. Adding additional regions, however, brings about the risk of\nfinancial contagion. Whenever the two initial regions have offsetting liquidity shocks, a\nliquidity shortage in the additional regions would cause a failure of the multiregional bank.\nAt the same time it is rather unlikely that the additional regions have sufficient excess\nliquidity to compensate a liquidity shortage in both initial regions. Thus it is optimal for\nbanks to operate in only two of the four regions.\nNicht technische Zusammenfassung\nDie geringe Anzahl an pan-europ\u00a8\naischen Banken scheint die Integration im retail bank-\ning zu behindern. Dabei wird h\u00a8\naufig die heterogene Bankenregulierung und -aufsicht\ninnerhalb Europas, die trotz der bestehenden Mindestharmonisierung zu verzeichnen ist,\nals wesentliches Hindernis f\u00a8\nur grenz\u00a8\nubergreifende Bank\u00a8\nubernahmen gesehen.2 Das vor-\nliegende Papier zeigt dagegen, dass auch fundamentale \u00a8\nokonomische Gr\u00a8\nunde die Entwick-\nlung pan-europ\u00a8\naischer Banken verhindern k\u00a8\nonnten.\nDas pr\u00a8\nasentierte Modell basiert auf einer \u00a8\nOkonomie mit mehreren Regionen, in de-\nnen Banken privaten Haushalten Einlagenvertr\u00a8\nage als Versicherung gegen idiosynkratische\nLiquidit\u00a8\natsrisiken anbieten. Da allerdings der Anteil derjenigen Haushalte, die tats\u00a8\nachlich\neinen Liquidit\u00a8\natsbedarf haben, unsicher ist, k\u00a8\nonnen Liquidit\u00a8\natsschocks innerhalb einer\nRegion nicht vollkommen diversifiziert werden. Um eine effizientere Diversifikation zu er-\nreichen, k\u00a8\nonnen Banken aber Regionen \u00a8\nubergreifend operieren. Die Integration mehrerer\nRegionen durch eine multiregionale Bank birgt allerdings auch das Risiko von Regionen\n\u00a8\nubergreifenden Ansteckungseffekten: Kann der Liquidit\u00a8\natsengpass einer Region innerhalb\neiner multiregionalen Bank nicht durch einen hinreichenden Liquidit\u00a8\nats\u00a8\nuberhang einer an-\nderen Region kompensiert werden, so f\u00a8\nuhrt dies in der gesamten multiregionalen Bank zu\neiner Liquidit\u00a8\natskrise. Ist die Zahl der Regionen begrenzt, sind Liquidit\u00a8\natsrisiken auch\nRegionen \u00a8\nubergreifend nicht vollst\u00a8\nandig diversifizierbar und der Einfluss eines regionalen\nLiquidit\u00a8\natsschocks auf den Liquidit\u00a8\natsstatus einer multiregionalen Bank wird nicht ver-\nschwindend. Dementsprechend muss eine Bank bei der Entscheidung, \u00a8\nuberregional im\nretail banking t\u00a8\natig zu werden, den positiven Diversifikationseffekt gegen das Risiko Re-\ngionen \u00a8\nubergreifender Ansteckungseffekte abw\u00a8\nagen.\nDas vorliegende Papier zeigt, dass es f\u00a8\nur Banken unter relativ allgemeinen Bedingun-\ngen optimal ist, in einigen aber nicht allen Regionen zu operieren. Nat\u00a8\nurlich l\u00a8\nasst sich\nein solches Ergebnis alleine durch eine bestimmte Korrelationsstruktur regionaler Schocks\nerzielen. Das vorliegende Papier geht aber von vollkommen symmetrischen Regionen aus.\nEs werden dementsprechend positive und negative Korrelationen zwischen Regionen aus-\ngeschlossen. Aber auch in diesem Fall zeigt sich, dass weder ein vollst\u00a8\nandig regional in-\ntegrierter Bankensektor noch vollkommen regional fragmentierte Bankensysteme optimal\nsind.\nUm die Intuition nachzuvollziehen, sei eine \u00a8\nOkonomie mit vier Regionen angenommen.\nDar\u00a8\nuber hinaus wird unterstellt, dass sofern eine Region einen Liquidit\u00a8\natsschock erleidet,\nauch s\u00a8\namtliche andere Regionen einen abnormen Liquidit\u00a8\natsbedarf haben. Das hei\u00dft,\n2Barros, et al. (2005) argumentieren beispielsweise dementsprechend.\ndass sie jeweils einen positiven oder einen negativen regionalen Liquidit\u00a8\natsschock dessel-\nben Ausma\u00dfes haben. In diesem Fall ist es immer vorteilhaft f\u00a8\nur eine Bank, mindestens\nin zwei Regionen pr\u00a8\nasent zu sein. Denn der negative Liquidit\u00a8\natsschock einer Region\nwird dann unter Umst\u00a8\nanden von einem positiven Schock in der anderen Region begleitet\nund kann hierdurch kompensiert werden. Ist die zweite Region dagegen auch von einem\nLiquidit\u00a8\natsengpass betroffen, so sind die beiden Regionen durch die Integration nicht\nschlechter gestellt als im Falle einer Autonomie. Ein Ansteckungseffekt tritt bei einem\nBankenzusammenschluss \u00a8\nuber zwei Regionen nicht auf. Dies ist anders, wenn die Bank ihr\nGesch\u00a8\naft auf alle vier Regionen ausdehnt. Denn sobald die beiden urspr\u00a8\nunglichen Regio-\nnen sich wechselseitig durch sich kompensierende Liquidit\u00a8\natsschocks stabilisieren, w\u00a8\nurde\nein Liquidit\u00a8\natsengpass in den zus\u00a8\natzlichen Regionen eine Liquidit\u00a8\natskrise in der multi-\nregionalen Bank ausl\u00a8\nosen.

The lack of pan-European banks however is the major obstacle to an\nintegration of the retail bank market. It is often argued that large cross-country mergers of\nbanks have mainly been impeded by the heterogenous banking regulation and supervision\nin the European union.1\nThis paper questions whether indeed the heterogeneity in the regulatory and supervi-\nsory regimes in Europe is the only reason why cross-country bank mergers in the European\nUnion have been limited and have failed to create a truly pan-European bank. A banking\nsystem that relies on international institutions provides an insurance mechanism against\nnational liquidity shocks. However, cross border transactions and mergers can bring about\na risk of financial contagion, i.e. they may increase systemic risk. A liquidity shortage in\na single region can spill-over to other regions if large financial institutions are fully liable\nfor their foreign branches.\nWe develop a model of banks as managers of different liquidity risks related to Kashyap,\nRajan, and Stein (2002). However, unlike Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein (2002) we follow\nAllen and Gale (2000) and assume regional liquidity shocks as the primary source of\nbanks' liquidity risk. Banks can choose to operate in different regions.\nBanks offer regional households with uncertain intertemporal consumption preferences\na liquidity insurance through deposit contracts as in Diamond and Dybvig (1983). How-\never, in each region there is some risk associated with the fraction of depositors having\nearly consumption needs. A bank that operates in more than one region can insure de-\npositors against regional liquidity risks. However, it risks that liquidity shortages in other\nregions spill over and adversely affect its entire business. Using this framework we show\nthat a partial integration of the retail banking sector with banks operating in several but\nnot all regions may actually be optimal given a certain fundamental stochastic structure\nof regional specific liquidity shocks.\nWe would like to thank Frank Heid, Michael Koetter, and Rowena Pecchenino as well as the conference\nparticipants of the 4th INFINITY Conference Dublin for helpful comments. The views expressed here\nare those of the authors and not necessarily those of the Deutsche Bundesbank.\n1Barros, Bergl\u00a8\nof, Fulghieri, Gual, Mayer, and Vives (2005) argue in their report on the integration of\nEuropean banking along these lines.\nObviously, any system of cross regional financial integration can be supported by some\nunderlying stochastic structure of liquidity needs. In order to gain further insights one\nneeds to distinguish more and less realistic scenarios. In our paper we impose a symmetry\nassumption which excludes positive or negative correlations of shocks across regions. We\nshow that even if all regions are entirely symmetric and no particular correlation between\nthe liquidity shocks of specific regions is assumed, its is not necessarily optimal to have\neither a full integrated or a nationally fragmented banking system. On the contrary, we\nfind that in many cases a multinational bank that optimally trades off the diversification\nbenefits and the costs from negative cross-regional spillovers is only operating in several\nbut not all countries. In other words we show that the problem of finding the optimal\nsize of multinational banks often has an interior solution in which banks operate only in\na subset of the countries of an economic area.\nOf course, our results only hold if the number of regions with different risk structures\nis not abundant. If this was the case then - by the law of large numbers - a complete\nmerger of banks in all existing regions would help to diversify away all risks. Moreover,\nfinancial distress in single regions would not cause the breakdown of the entire system\nbecause the excess liquidity need in one region would be relatively low. However, if the\nnumber of regions is limited, the financial distress in one region may cause a breakdown\nof a bank that operates in the entire economy. This is what we shall assume in this paper.\nSimilar to banks in Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein (2002) deposit institutes in our frame-\nwork try to economize on their overall liquidity risk by combining negatively correlated\nliquidity risks across regions. Consequently, if it is very likely that two regions are hit\nby (offsetting) liquidity shocks a two-regional bank merger (or a bank operating in two\nregions, respectively) can reduce the overall liquidity risk of the financial institution. If\nit is on the other hand rather likely that a liquidity shock only occurs in one region at\nthe same time, then the risk that such a regional shock might induce a collapse of the\nmultinational banks is too high. Multinational banks are inefficient in this case\u00adbanks\nshould operate only in one region. Financial risk that is concentrated on single regions\nmakes it desirable to partition the economy completely.\nIn our paper we introduce the notion of financial turbulence. Financial turbulence is\ncharacterized by situations in which all regions simultaneously display unusually high or\nunusually low liquidity needs: A liquidity shortage in one region is always accompanied by\nan abnormal (positive or negative) liquidity stance of the same size in all other regions.\nWe show that a high relative likelihood of financial turbulence makes limited financial\nintegration particularly desirable.\nTo understand the intuition consider an economy with four regions. In this case it\nis always preferable for a bank to operate in at least two regions, because if one region\nfaces a liquidity shortage the second region could have an offsetting liquidity shock. If\nthe second region is also hit by a negative liquidity shock the two regions are not worst\noff than if they were served by separate banks. Contagion does not occur in this case\nwith a two regional merger. Adding additional regions, however, brings about the risk\nof financial contagion. Whenever, the two initial regions have offsetting liquidity shocks\na liquidity shortage in the additional regions would cause a failure of the multiregional\nbank. At the same time it is rather unlikely that the additional regions have sufficient\nexcess liquidity to compensate a liquidity shortage in both initial regions. Moreover, in\ncases with excess liquidity in the two considered regions a merger with other regions leads\nvery likely to a liquidity transfer to other regions with less liquidity. Thus given a high\nrelative likelihood of financial turbulence it is optimal for banks to operate in only two of\nthe four regions.\nWhile our model shares the common feature of banks as managers of liquidity risks\nwith Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein (2002), our model differs from theirs in several respects.\nMost important is probably that in Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein (2002) banks' main ob-\njective when combining liquidity risks is to minimize costly cash holdings. In contrast,\nin our model banks try to smooth consumption for their stake holders taking negatively\ncorrelated liquidity risks. In this respect our paper is also closely related to models that\nanalyze the costs and benefits of integrated interbank bank markets like Allen and Gale\n(2000) and Freixas, Parigi, and Rochet (2000). They show that an integrated interbank\nmarket may serve as a means for banks to mutually insure against negatively correlated\nbank specific liquidity shocks. But when deciding to integrate through the interbank\nmarket banks do not take into account the risk of financial contagion. For a two regional\neconomy Fecht and Gr\u00a8\nuner (2004) analyze the decision of banks to integrate through\nthe interbank market trading off the benefits from diversifying idiosyncratic liquidity\nshocks against the costs from contagion in case of aggregate liquidity shortages. Fecht\nand Gr\u00a8\nuner (2004) also show that interbank integration does not capture all benefit from\nfinancial integration even if regional specific liquidity shocks are the only benefit from\nintegration. A cross-regionally active bank could provide even smoother consumption\npossibilities than regional banks being insured over the interbank market. This paper\nextends the framework of Fecht and Gr\u00a8\nuner (2004) to multiple regions but focuses only\non financial integration through cross-country bank merger. Intriguingly, we find that\neven though cross-country mergers allow to reap the maximum benefits from cross-border\nintegration (as compared to interbank market integration) depending on the distribution\nof the regional liquidity shocks it is still not necessarily optimal for banks to operate in\nall regions of an economy.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the basic\nsettings of the model. In section 2.4 we derive the optimal deposit contract that banks\noffer to households. If states with liquidity shocks are sufficiently unlikely this deposit\ncontract is independent of the degree of international integration chosen by banks. Thus\nwe can take the optimal deposit contract as given, when deriving the optimal degree\nof cross-country integration of the banking sector in section 3 for different parameter\nsettings. Section 4 provides some simulation results and section 5 concludes.\n2 The Model\nThe economy consists of four regions I = 1, .., 4. Each region consists of a mass 1 of\nhouseholds with the same stochastic utility function\nUi\n) = ~\nj\nj\n) ,\nwith\nu (ct\n) =\nt\nand  > 1 and ~\nj\nIn each region I households do not know whether they can derive utility from con-\nsumption in t = 1 or t = 2. They only know that with a probability ~\nqI\nthey will turn out\nto be impatient and want to consume in t = 1. The probability ~\nqI\nof becoming an impa-\ntient household (which is at the same time the regional fraction of impatient households)\nis itself stochastic:\n~\nj\ndj = ~\nqI\nwith ~\nqI\nWith probability a the fraction of impatient consumers in all four regions equals 1/2.\nWith probability (1 - a) in at least one of the regions qI\n. This means that in one or\nmore regions either a high (1) or a low (0) fraction of households wants to consume early.\n2.2 Stochastic structure\nIn an economy with four regions and two types of liquidity shocks there are 34 = 81\npossible realizations of the shocks. The set of possible probability distributions is given\nby the unit simplex with 81 dimensions. In order to impose some further structure on\nthe problem we assume that each situation with a given number of shocks is equally\nlikely. This implies that shocks are not correlated across regions. Call the conditional\nprobabilities of each event with i shocks i\nis the conditional (on the\nfact that there is a liquidity shock somewhere) probability that there is an early (or late)\nliquidity shock in one particular region and no shock in the other three regions. In this\nanalysis we restrict our attention to the limit case with a  0. We have:\ni.e. there are 8 possible constellations with one single shock, 24 possible constellations\nwith 2 shocks and so on. Four prototype situations will be distinguished:\n2. limited turbulence 2\n3. significant turbulence 3\nAny other stochastic structure is a convex combination of these 4 regimes.\nOur second, stronger assumption is that liquidity shocks which affect a smaller number\nof regions are more likely. Under such a monotonous risk structure 81\n>\n. This assumption will only be needed for one particular result on the desirability of\nfull financial integration.\nThere is one direct investment technology available in the economy. In t = 0 households\ncan invest in the technology. Because it is not observable whether a particular household\nis patient or impatient, there is no direct insurance mechanism against liquidity risks\navailable. Furthermore, there is no financial market in t = 1 available in which households\nfrom the four regions could participate.\nWe assume that the long-term returns are sufficiently large and/or that the degree of\nhouseholds' risk aversion is sufficiently high that\nAs we shall see below this assumption ensures that a bank operating in all four regions\nand offering the optimal deposit contract will collapse even if only in one of the four\nregions an early liquidity shock occurs.\nBesides direct investment households can invest their endowment at a bank. Banks\noffer deposit contracts with alternative repayments in both periods, {d1\n}. There is\none bank in each region. However, banking markets are contestable. Therefore banks are\nforced to offer the deposit contract that maximizes the expected utility of depositors.\nIf banks cannot repay all depositors withdrawing in t = 1 all depositors (even those\ninitially not withdrawing in t = 1) receive the same pro-rata repayment. Thus we abstract\nfor sequential service constraints and thereby exclude purely expectation driven bank runs.\n2.4 The optimal deposit contract\nGiven our assumption that liquidity shocks are sufficiently unlikely (a  0) the optimal\ndeposit contract maximizes households expected utility\n)] =\n) +\n)\nsubject to the budget constraint\n+\nR\nand is always given by\ndM\n=\n,\nwhich yields a regular payoff at date 2 of\ndM\n=\n.\n3 The optimal degree of financial integration\nIt is useful to note that there are cases in which only the likelihood of a bank's bankruptcy\ndetermines the ranking of consumer utility. This holds if the risk aversion parameter  is\nsufficiently large.\nProposition 1 Consider two banks 1, 2 that go bankrupt with some probability a1\n,\nprovide customers with normal payoffs dM\n, dM\nwith probability b1\n, and provide the\nnormal payoff dM\nat date 1 and R at date 2 with probability c1\n. For all R <  and\n< 1 there is a  such that for all    bank 1 is preferable to bank 2 if it\nonly has a low default probability, i.e. if a1\n.\nProof. An individual who is extremely risk averse maximizes his minimum payoff.\nThe optimal contract fixes identical payoffs in both periods.\nlim\n\ndM\n= lim\n\ndM\n=\n.\nMoreover, for  going to infinity utility is larger if and only if the probability of the\nlowest payoff, 1 is minimized. To see this verify that the utility of bank 1's customers\nmay be written:\nxj\nj\nwith cj\n= dM\n, dM\n, dM\n, R > 1 and xj\n.The result follows from\nlim\n\nxj\nj\n=\n+ lim\n\nxj\nj\n=\n.\nThus for sufficiently risk averse households banks' prior aim is to minimize the proba-\nbility of a default due to a liquidity shortage. Achieving or efficiently distributing excess\nliquidity becomes subordinated.\nOur second result relates to situations of low risk aversion. In such cases there is\nalmost no consumption smoothing since c1\n R. The loss from a financial\ncrises in a single region is negligible because all consumers would optimally consume one\nunit anyway. However, in other regimes there may be contagion in cases in which some\nconsumers prefer to consume at the later date. Therefore , for low values of  separation\nis strictly preferred to any other regime.\nProposition 2 For all R there is a \u00af\n > 1 such that for all   \u00af\n separation is strictly\npreferred to any other regime.\nProof. For a risk-neutral individual the optimal contract fixes dM\n= R. To\nsee this, consider the ratio of the maximum date 2 payoff R and normal date 2 payments,\ndM\n:\nR\ndM\n=\nR\n=\n=\n+\nR\n=\n+\n\n=\n+\n\n.\nlim\n+\n\nHence, under separation, early consumers realize their desired consumption even in the\nevent of a crises. Late consumers realize the maximum payoff R, i.e. there is no potential\ngain from late liquidity sharing. All other forms of integration yield lower payoffs because\nthere is a risk of liquidation for late consumers due to financial contagion. The rest follows\nfrom the continuity of utilities in .\nWe now use the first result to derive the optimal structure of the banking sector in\ncases with highly risk averse depositors.\nFinancial integration is particularly costly if shocks are limited to single regions (1\n).\nIn such a situation a financial merger has two effects: (i) a positive liquidity sharing effect\nin case of a positive liquidity shock in one region and (ii) a contagion effect which is\nparticularly likely. This is due to the fact that in half of all cases the aggregate liquidity\nshortage leads to a collapse of a cross-regionally active bank.2 Liquidity shocks can never\noffset each other in this case.\nProposition 3 (i) Consider an economy with only financial risk (81\n= 1). For all R\nthere is a  such that for all    separation strictly maximizes expected household\nutility. Utility strictly decreases in the order of integration. (ii) Consider an economy\nunder limited financial turbulence. For all R there is a  such that for all    separation\nand full integration maximizes expected household utility. Intermediate integration yields\ninferior results.\n2Keep in mind that we assume that each region is large enough to induce a financial collapse of the\nentire system.\nTable 1: Regionally concentrated financial risk, 1\n.\nProof. (i) Table 1 relates to a situation with regionally concentrated financial risk.\nIn this case 1\n. Each row represents one situation in which one particular region is\naffected by a shock. A black square ( ) represents excessive liquidity (qI\n= 0), an empty\nsquare ( ) too little liquidity (qI\n= 1). A zero represents normal liquidity. Separation\nyields maximum utility. 2-integration introduces a loss due to contagion in case 6. 3-\nintegration introduces a loss due to contagion in cases 6 and 7, and so on.\n(ii) Table 2 relates to a situation with limited financial turbulence, i.e. two regions are\naffected by a shock. Consider the risk of bankruptcy for consumers in region 1 in a merger\nbankruptcy occurs in 6 cases. Under 3 integration in 9 and under full integration in 6\ncases.\n3.3 Existence of an interior solution\nA limited merger of only two banks may be the optimal solution when an abnormal liquid-\nity demand in all regions is the most likely type of shock. In our model this corresponds\n= 1. We refer to such situations as cases with likely financial\nturbulence.\nProposition 4 Consider an economy with likely financial turbulence (164\n= 1). For all\nR > 1 there is a lower bound  such that for all    2-integration strictly maximizes\nexpected household utility.\nProof. Table 3 relates to a situation with financial turbulence: there is a shock in\nevery region. Consider the risk of bankruptcy for consumers in region 1 in a merger with\nregion 2. Bankruptcy occurs in 4 cases (13-16). Under separation bankruptcy occurs in\n8 cases, under 3-integration in 8 cases, under 4 integration in 5 cases.\nThe possible welfare gain from 2-integration (versus separation) arises when there are\nopposite liquidity shocks in those two regions. A possible cost arises when region 1 is\ncharacterized by a high liquidity need and region 2 has a normal liquidity status. In this\ncase liquidity is transferred from region 1 to region 2. However, as seen in section 3.1. for\nsufficiently risk averse households these costs are always overcompensated by the benefit\nfrom the reduced default risk.\nAdding two more regions (i.e. a complete merger of all four regional banks) raises\nthe cost of financial contagion significantly but adds little to the positive insurance effect.\nIf financial turbulence is the most likely outcome (meaning that all four regions have\ndifferent liquidity needs than usual) then adding two more regions can only help in those\ncases where the two initial regions have been subject to the same - early - liquidity\nshock. If the two regions have an excess liquidity they would be forced to share this\nexcess liquidity with the two additional regions if they have less liquidity. But more\nimportantly, given that the two initial regions have offsetting liquidity shocks expanding\nthe bank to two additional regions increases the risk that a liquidity shortage from the\nother regions causes a default of the entire bank.\nA similar result is obtained for a case of significant financial turbulence.\nProposition 5 Consider an economy under significant financial turbulence (323\nFor all R > 1 there is a lower bound  such that for all    3-integration strictly\nmaximizes expected household utility.\nProof. Table 4 relates to a situation with significant financial turbulence: there is\nalways a shock in 3 of the 4 regions. Consider the risk of bankruptcy for consumers\nin region 1 in a merger with region 2 and 3. Bankruptcy occurs in 10 cases (cases:\n3.4 Full integration\nProposition 6 (i) Full integration can only be uniquely optimal under a risk struc-\nture which is a convex combination of limited turbulence and turbulence. (ii) Under a\nmonotonous risk structure full integration can never be optimal.\nProof. (i) Under financial risk and significant turbulence full integration is the worst\nof all options. It is optimal under limited turbulence and preferred to separation under\nturbulence. From what we have learned so far under full separation the conditional\nprobability a liquidity shortage at the bank is:\n.\nUnder 2-integration it is:\n.\nUnder 3-integration it is:\n.\nTable 4: Significant financial turbulence, 323\nUnder full integration it is:\n.\nAn appropriate convex combination of 2 and 4\nyields the following bankruptcy risk.\nUnder separation it is:\n= \n=\n-\n\nUnder 2-integration it is:\n= \n=\n +\nUnder 3-integration it is:\n= \n=\n-\n\nUnder full integration it is:\n= \n=\n-\n\nFor  1 full integration is uniquely optimal.\n(ii) Under a monotonous risk structure 81\n. One can easily\nverify that this is incompatible with full integration dominating separation.\nIt is important to note that complete integration is particularly bad in those situations\nin which regions one and two are hit by a positive shock (see table 3). In most situations\nit is not good to integrate them because they would have to share their excess liquidity\nwith the two other regions (cases 10-12). If by contrast regions one and two are both hit\nby a negative shock then integration usually does not help (cases 14-16). It only helps\nin the case where the two remaining regions are affected by a positive shock (case 13).\nIf the shock in regions one and two offset one another then integration does not help if\nliquidity is balanced in the rest of the economy and it is bad if there is a need for liquidity\nin the rest of the economy (case 1 and 5). Only if there is excess liquidity in the rest of\nthe economy integration has a benefit (case 2).\nConsequently, when financial risk is dominant, separation is a good option. When\nfinancial turbulence is likely, less than complete integration may be a good choice. Under\na monotonous risk structure full integration is not desirable for risk averse consumers.\n4 Simulation results\nWe complete the paper with a simulation analysis for those intermediate parameter values\nfor which no clear welfare analysis can be provided. We have to start by specifying\nhouseholds' expected utility in the different arrangements. Under separation, households\nexpected utility conditional on the occurrence of a shock in some region of the economy\ncan be calculated as:\nU dM\n; dM\n=\n)\ndM\n+\ndM\n)\n)\nThe first line corresponds to normal liquidity, the second to a financial crises and the\nthird to excess liquidity. Under 2-integration excess liquidity may be shared with the\nother region in a number of cases (third line). We have:\nU dM\n; dM\n=\n)\ndM\n+\ndM\n)\n)\n\u00b7\nR\ndM\n+\ndM\n)\nSimilarly, under 3-integration three levels of average excess liquidity may obtain.\nHousehold utility is given by:\nU dM\n; dM\n=\n)\ndM\n+\ndM\n)\n)\nR\n+\ndM\n)\nR\ndM\n+\ndM\n)\nFinally, under full integration household utility is given by:\nU dM\n; dM\n=\n)\ndM\n+\ndM\n)\n)\nR\ndM\n+\ndM\nR\ndM\n+\ndM\nR\ndM\n+\ndM\nOur simulation results complement the previous analysis for intermediate values of the risk\naversion parameter . Figure 1 relates to a situation of financial turbulence. It displays\nthe utility difference between a regime of limited (2)- integration and full integration as a\nfunction of  for a value of R = 3. The difference remains positive for the entire parameter\nrange.\nFigure 2 relates to a situation of financial risk. It displays the utility difference between\na regime of separation and 2-integration as a function of  for a value of R = 3 and 4.\nThe difference remains positive for the entire parameter range.\n5 Conclusion\nThis paper has analyzed the welfare effects of financial integration. According to our\nanalysis international bank integration may yield welfare losses for risk neutral and for\nstrongly risk averse depositors when too many banks merge. The reason is that contagion\nis particulary likely under a fully integrated banking system - almost independently of\nwhether financial turbulences are limited to a subset of regions or not.\nAny welfare analysis of this kind needs to impose some restrictions on the underlying\nstochastic structure. Otherwise, trivially, any structure of the banking sector can be\noptimal under appropriate assumptions about the correlation of shocks. We have imposed\ntwo major restrictions on the underlying stochastic structures in order to organize our\nanalysis efficiently: (i) the uncorrelatedness of shocks across regions and in one case (ii)\nthe decreasing order on the likelihood of multiple shocks. In this concluding section we\nwould like to briefly discuss two alternative scenarios.\nA positive correlation of shocks across regions is a scenario that may result when\naggregate demand is correlated e.g. due to trade liberalization. In such cases very little\ncan be said in favor of any sort of financial integration because the scope for diversification\nis reduced. What would speak in favor of full integration are scenarios with a strong\nnegative correlation which actually is not too intuitive. Due to a low degree of real\nand political integration in the European union individual shocks to specific countries\nare still most likely. More widespread shocks \u00ad in particular, counterbalancing shocks in\nseveral countries that could result from significant cross-border portfolio shifts \u00ad are still\ncomparably unlikely. Accordingly limits to cross border activities or financial mergers\nmay naturally arise.\nOne should however keep in mind that the present analysis relies on the assumption\nthat a complete diversification is excluded. Large scale financial integration is always\ndesirable when risk can be fully diversified away through appropriate arrangements such\nas mergers or cross border activity of financial institutions. However, when the number of\nregions is not large enough, partial financial integration may be the optimal choice from\ndepositors' point of view. This may explain why financial integration across European\nregions is still limited.\nThe present paper is also skeptical about gradualism in financial integration. Even if a\nlarge financial institution that diversifies away all risks is feasible in practice, the present\nanalysis points out that a cost has to be borne along the way to such a conglomerate if\nthe merger process evolves gradually.\n6 Appendix.
