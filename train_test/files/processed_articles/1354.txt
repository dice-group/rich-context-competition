In regression models, independent variables included asthma status, household environmental factors,\nage, and anthropometric measurements. Regression analyses were weighted by the NHANES III examination\nsample weighting factor, and results were adjusted for clustering in the sampling design. There were distinct sex\ndifferences in the results. In girls, lung function was lowest among active asthmatics taking prescription\nrespiratory medicine, whereas lung function in other active and inactive asthmatics did not differ greatly from that\nin nonasthmatics. In boys, however, all groups of asthmatics had substantially lower lung function than\nnonasthmatics. Differences in lung function between active asthmatics and nonasthmatics were stable with\nincreasing age. However, the lung function of inactive asthmatic girls and boys returned to and diverged from\nnonasthmatics' levels, respectively. In asthmatic girls, passive smoking was associated with reduced lung\nfunction; having a dog or cat was associated with increased lung function; and gas stove use was associated with\nreduced lung function among subjects not taking prescription respiratory medicine.\nair pollution, indoor; asthma; environmental health; environmental pollutants; respiratory physiology; spirometry;\ntobacco smoke pollution\n, forced expiratory flow between 25 percent and 75 percent of forced vital capacity; FEV1\n, first-second\nforced expiratory volume; FVC, forced vital capacity; NHANES III, Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; Th2,\nT-helper cell type 2.\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys\nhave been conducted since the 1970s by the National Center\nfor Health Statistics. These surveys characterize the health\nand nutritional status of the US population. They are cross-\nsectional and employ a complex stratified, multistage proba-\nbility sampling design.

It is therefore impor-\ntant to understand influences of host and environmental\nfactors on children's and adolescents' lung function and to\nascertain the reversibility of lung function deficits in this\nage group.\nIn the present study, we examined the influences of asthma\nand of three household environmental factors (smoking by\nhousehold members (household passive smoking), use of a\ngas stove for cooking, and the presence of a dog or cat in the\nhome) on spirometric lung function in nonsmoking\nNHANES III subjects aged 8\u00ad16 years. We also evaluated\nwhether asthmatics' lung function returned to nonasth-\nmatics' levels with increasing age.\nTABLE 1.

Therefore, in this\nreport we consider only subjects aged 8\u00ad16 years.\nThe spirometric testing protocol and quality control proce-\ndures followed the spirometry guidelines issued by the\nAmerican Thoracic Society in 1987 (9). Lung function was\nmeasured at the mobile examination centers with dry rolling-\nseal volume spirometers that recorded data electronically.\nSubjects performed a minimum of five and a maximum of\neight forced vital capacity (FVC) maneuvers. Spirometry\nwas quality-controlled by the National Institute of Occupa-\ntional Safety and Health (Morgantown, West Virginia) (10).\nMeasurements of FVC and first-second forced expiratory\nvolume (FEV1\n) were judged reproducible if their largest and\nsecond-largest values from acceptable maneuvers were\nwithin the greater of 5 percent or 100 ml.\nFive lung function metrics were examined in data analysis:\n; forced expiratory flow between 25 percent and\n); and the ratios of FEV1\nand\nto FVC (FEV1\n/FVC, respec-\ntively).

A history was considered\npositive if the subject reported taking any of the following:\n\"adrenal corticosteroids\" (Food and Drug Administration\n\"respiratory tract\" medication (code 1900), or \"steroids-\nresponses were for beta agonists (bronchodilators), theo-\nphylline and its derivatives, and cromolyn sodium, respec-\ntively.\nInformation on personal smoking history was obtained\nthrough confidential interviews with subjects. The preva-\nlence of personal smoking was strongly positively associated\nwith age. We excluded subjects who were current smokers or\nhad smoked 5 packs of cigarettes during their lifetime, to\navoid the potential confounding of personal smoking effects\nwith effects of age on lung function.\nPrevious studies have shown sex differences in the effects\nof asthma and of host and environmental factors on lung\nfunction and respiratory symptom prevalence (11\u00ad14). We\ntherefore conducted sex-specific analyses. Preliminary anal-\nyses showed no appreciable effects of urban versus rural\nstatus, day-care attendance, or the presence of any siblings,\nolder siblings, or younger siblings in the NHANES III data\nset. Reported use of an exhaust fan had no discernible influ-\nence on the effect of using a gas stove for cooking. Among\nnonasthmatics, there were no appreciable effects of prescrip-\ntion respiratory medication use, wheezing in the past 12\nmonths, or parental history of asthma or hay fever. There-\nfore, these characteristics were not considered in the final\nmodels.\nRegression models were constructed. Outcome variables\nwere the natural logarithms of lung function metrics. Data\nanalysis was conducted in three steps. Step 1 was intended to\ncharacterize overall influences of asthma on girls' and boys'\nlung function. Step 1 models included three 0/1 dummy vari-\nables (main effects) for active asthmatics taking and not\ntaking prescription respiratory medication and for inactive\nasthmatics. Models also included the following independent\ncovariates: 1) natural log of age in years (age in months/12);\n2) anthropometric measures--the natural logs of standing\nheight (cm) and body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2)\nand a dummy variable for exceeding the age- and sex-\nspecific 90th percentile value for triceps skinfold thickness;\n3) household environmental factors (all dummy variables)--\nhaving one smoker in the home, having two or more smokers\nin the home, use of a gas stove for cooking, having a dog,\nand having a cat; 4) ethnicity (all dummy variables)--non-\nHispanic Black, Mexican American, non-Mexican Hispanic\nAmerican living in the Northeast census region (where about\nhalf of all Hispanic Americans were Puerto Rican Amer-\nTABLE 3.

Step 2 models included\ndummy variables and age interaction terms for active and\ninactive asthmatics and a dummy variable for use of respira-\ntory medication in asthmatics. Other covariates were defined\nas in the step 1 models.\nStep 3 was intended to examine influences of household\nenvironment on lung function. Factors of interest were\nhousehold passive smoking, use of a gas stove for cooking,\nand having a dog or cat. Separate models were constructed\nfor asthmatics and nonasthmatics. Asthmatics' models\nincluded dummy variables for inactive asthma and age at\nasthma onset <3 years among active and inactive asthmatics.\nThese models included dummy variables for use of respira-\ntory medication, using a gas stove and taking respiratory\nmedication, using a gas stove and not taking respiratory\n/FVC among subjects aged 8\u00ad16 years, by asthma status and age, Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey, 1988\u00ad1994.

Other covariates were\ndefined as in the step 1 models. Nonasthmatics' step 3\nmodels were identical to those of the step 1 models, except\nthat they did not include terms for asthma status or respira-\ntory medication.\nAll regression analyses employed SUDAAN software\n(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North\nCarolina), which calculates sample variances to adjust for\nstratification and geographic clustering in the sampling\ndesign. Regression analyses were weighted by the examina-\ntion sample weighting factor, which corrects for nonrepre-\nsentative sampling on ethnicity, age, sex, and other factors.\nPredicted lung function was depicted for selected models;\nexponentials (antilogs) of modeled log(lung function) were\nplotted by age using S-Plus 2000 software (Insightful Corpo-\nration, Seattle, Washington). Category-specific exponentials\nwere fitted with quadratic regression curves.\nRESULTS\nSubjects' characteristics are shown in table 1. Weighted\nethnic distributions differed from unweighted ones, because\nBlacks and Mexican Americans were intentionally oversam-\npled in NHANES III. In the analyzed weighted sample, 68.9\npercent of subjects were non-Hispanic White, 15.1 percent\nwere non-Hispanic Black, and 8.5 percent were Mexican\nAmerican.

Only 8.5 percent\n(weighted) of active asthmatics reported using steroids in the\npast month.\nWeighted characteristics are shown, by asthma status, in\ntable 2. Among girls, prevalences of asthma-associated char-\nacteristics were quite consistently highest in active asth-\nmatics taking prescription respiratory medicine, second-\nhighest in other active asthmatics, second-lowest in inactive\nasthmatics, and lowest in nonasthmatics. Among boys, this\ntendency was less consistent, though prevalences of these\ncharacteristics were generally highest in active asthmatics.\nIn both sexes, prevalences of wheezing, visiting a physician\nor an emergency room for wheezing, and hospitalization for\nwheezing in the past year were distinctly highest in active\nasthmatics taking prescription respiratory medication.\nAmong inactive asthmatics, wheezing was more prevalent in\nResults of the step 1 analyses are summarized in table 3\nand figures 1 and 2.

Effects of asthma were gener-\nally clearest in the ratio metrics log(FEV1\n/FVC) and\n/FVC). Among girls, predicted ratio metrics\nwere clearly lowest in asthmatics taking prescription medi-\ncation. Among other active and inactive asthmatic girls,\nthese metrics generally did not differ greatly from those in\nnonasthmatics. Among boys, however, these metrics were\ndistinctly and statistically significantly lower (at  = 0.05) in\nall asthmatic groups than in nonasthmatics and did not differ\nappreciably among asthmatic groups.\nIn step 2 analyses, differences between the lung function\nof active asthmatics and that of nonasthmatics were reason-\nably stable with age (for the interaction of active asthma with\nage across all sex-specific lung function metrics, p  0.436).\nIn contrast, the lung function of inactive asthmatic girls\ntended to return to nonasthmatics' levels, and that of inactive\nasthmatic boys tended to diverge from nonasthmatics'\nlevels, with increasing age. In girls, the sign of the interac-\ntion of inactive asthma with age was positive for all metrics\nbut FVC. In boys, this interaction was negative for all\nmetrics but FVC.

Among boys, the corresponding p values were\n/FVC by age in nonasthmatics, active asthmatics,\nand inactive asthmatics, as derived in step 2 models.\nIn step 3 analyses, household environmental factors\nconsistently influenced lung function in asthmatic girls but\nnot in other sex-asthma groups. In asthmatic girls, the pres-\nence of two or more smokers in the home was associated\nwith reduced lung function (table 4 and figure 4). This asso-\nciation was statistically significant for log(FEF25\u00ad75\n) and\n/FVC) and was marginally significant for\n) and log(FEV1\n/FVC). In asthmatic boys, modeled\nlung function was also generally lowest in the presence of\ntwo or more smokers but not significantly so. In asthmatic\ngirls, use of a gas stove in the absence of prescription respi-\nratory medication was consistently associated with reduced\nlung function (table 5 and figure 5). No such association was\nobserved for gas stove use when respiratory medication was\ntaken. There was no consistent influence of gas stove use on\nasthmatic boys' lung function. The presence of a dog or cat\nin the home was consistently and significantly associated\nwith increased lung function in asthmatic girls but not in\nasthmatic boys (table 6 and figure 6).\nAmong nonasthmatics, the presence of two or more\nsmokers in the home was associated with significantly\nincreased predicted FVC (p = 0.011) in boys and with\nnonsignificantly increased predicted FEV1\nboys. Otherwise, the presence of two or more smokers was\nassociated with nonsignificant reductions in nonasthmatics'\nlung function. There were no appreciable effects of gas stove\nuse, having a dog, or having a cat on predicted lung function\nin nonasthmatics (data not shown).\nDISCUSSION\nWhen interpreting these results, it is important to note that\ndifferent subpopulations were present in different propor-\ntions in the US population and the weighted NHANES III\nsample. For example, non-Hispanic Whites constituted over\ntwo thirds of our weighted analytical sample. Therefore, this\ngroup counted more heavily than other ethnic groups in the\ncomputation of effect estimates. The estimates derived in our\nmodels should be regarded as composite nationwide esti-\nmates for persons aged 8\u00ad16 years. They should not be\ngeneralized beyond this age group, and they may not be\nequally applicable to all ethnic groups.\nThe NHANES III data set does not provide information on\nmother's smoking, the number or ages of siblings, or the\nspecific ethnicity of Hispanic Americans other than Mexican\nAmericans. In addition, breastfeeding influences the devel-\nopment of asthma and wheezing (15) and a mother's\nsmoking during pregnancy influences children's lung func-\ntion (16). In NHANES III, this information was collected\nTABLE 5.

Inability to adjust the analytical\nmodels for these factors limits interpretation of these find-\nings somewhat.\nUse of prescription respiratory medication was associated\nwith clinically severe asthma, especially in girls (table 2).\nDeficits in lung function were especially pronounced among\nasthmatic girls who took such medication (table 3). Other\ninvestigators have also observed larger lung function deficits\nin asthmatics taking such medication than in those not taking\nit (11, 12). Overall, the literature suggests strongly that\nmedical treatment does not yet compensate for lung function\ndeficits in asthmatic children and adolescents. It would be\nhighly desirable to assess whether the effectiveness and\naccessibility of asthma treatment are improving over time.\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys\nprovide the opportunity to conduct such assessment nation-\nally, although the current survey does not include lung func-\ntion testing.\nAsthmatic subjects were classified as active or inactive\naccording to their mothers' perceptions. This classification is\nsubject to some uncertainty, especially in girls, in whom\nwheezing during the past 12 months was reported for over\nhalf of inactive asthmatics and in whom the frequency of\nschool absence was nearly as high in inactive asthmatics as\nin active asthmatics (table 2). Nevertheless, in both girls and\n/FVC among asthmatics aged 8\u00ad16 years, by use of a gas stove for cooking and age, Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988\u00ad1994. Group-specific quadratic regression curves are shown for girls (panel A) and boys (panel\n, forced expiratory flow between 25 percent and 75 percent of forced vital capacity; FVC, forced vital capacity.\nboys, weighted frequencies of most asthma-related charac-\nteristics were appreciably lower in inactive asthmatics than\nin active asthmatics. This was true even for wheezing in\ngirls. In addition, among inactive asthmatics, no girls and\nonly one boy had taken prescription respiratory medication\nin the past month. On balance, we believe that the chosen\nclassification method is reasonable.\nAbsolute differences between the lung function of active\nasthmatics and the lung function of nonasthmatics were quite\nstable with age. This observation is broadly consistent with\nthe literature, which suggests that lung function deficits\nassociated with childhood asthma sometimes improve after\nchildhood but do not disappear entirely. Among children\naged 6\u00ad18 years, Gold et al. (11) observed that absolute defi-\ncits in lung function associated with asthma and wheezing\nincreased with age. Percentage deficits did not change\nsubstantially with age. In southern California, Berhane et al.\n(12) made similar findings in asthmatic children and adoles-\ncents; asthma-associated deficits were somewhat larger in\nboys than in girls.\n/FVC among asthmatics aged 8\u00ad16 years, by the presence of a dog or cat in the home and age, Third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988\u00ad1994. Group-specific quadratic regression curves are shown for girls (panel A) and\n, forced expiratory flow between 25 percent and 75 percent of forced vital capacity; FVC, forced vital capacity.\nYouth Lung Function in NHANES III 187\nIn our analyses, inactive asthmatic girls' lung function\nappeared to \"catch up\" with nonasthmatics' lung function,\nwhereas inactive asthmatic boys' lung function diverged\nfrom nonasthmatics' lung function as age increased. These\ntrends were observed for multiple lung function metrics and\nwere often statistically significant. These trends are subject to\nuncertainty, because unweighted sample sizes were small and\nbecause the NHANES III data are cross-sectional. Age trends\nobserved in cross-sectional studies can differ from those in\nlongitudinal ones (17, 18), largely because of unadjusted\nbirth cohort effects in cross-sectional data. We cannot rule\nout the possibility of subtle cohort effects in the present study.\nIn addition, one might expect wheezing to be associated\nwith worsening, not improving, lung function. Wheezing\nwas reported for more than half of the inactive asthmatic\ngirls, so the observed age trends might seem counterintui-\ntive. Even so, these trends persisted when additional dummy\nvariables for wheezing in nonasthmatics and asthmatics\nwere entered into the step 2 model. This caused the absolute\nmagnitudes of effect estimates for the interaction of inactive\nasthma with age to diminish by less than 10 percent, with no\nchanges in their signs and only small changes in p values.\nWhen variables for age at asthma onset were entered into the\nstep 2 model, the inactive asthma-age interaction tended to\nincrease, and its p value to decrease, in girls. Furthermore, in\nseparate models, the interaction of wheezing with age in\never-asthmatics was positive for all metrics but FVC in girls\nand was negative for all metrics in boys.\nThus, we submit that the observed age trends in inactive\nasthmatics may well reflect actual sex differences in the\nnatural history of asthma between the ages of 8 and 16 years.\nLong-term deficits in asthmatics' lung function may result\nfrom permanent restructuring of the airways (airway remod-\neling) (19, 20), which may be mediated in turn by chronic\nairway inflammation (21, 22). Conceivably, among inactive\nasthmatics, 8- to 16-year-old boys might be more susceptible\nthan girls to these processes, even though the girls have a\nhigher prevalence of wheezing. The prevalence of positive\nskin tests was higher in inactive asthmatic boys than in inac-\ntive asthmatic girls. In addition, the prevalence of a positive\nhistory of asthma or hay fever in both parents was substan-\ntially higher among inactive asthmatic boys than among\ninactive asthmatic girls or active asthmatic boys (table 2).\nTherefore, one might hypothesize that in the studied age\ngroup, susceptibility to airway remodeling could be more\nclosely associated with one or both of these characteristics\nthan with wheezing.\nWe examined five lung function metrics, including the\nratios of FEV1\nto FVC. Our results underscore\nthe importance of considering such ratios. O'Connor et al.\n/FVC is particularly effective in\ndetecting effects of asthma and maternal smoking on chil-\ndren's lung function. In our analyses, ratio metrics generally\nprovided the clearest distinctions not only regarding the\neffects of asthma and passive smoking on lung function but\nalso regarding the effects of gas stove use and having a dog\nor cat in asthmatic girls.\nIn the present study, the lung function of asthmatic girls\nwas influenced, negatively and positively, by exposure to\nhousehold environmental factors. Household passive\nsmoking was clearly associated with reduced lung function\nin this group, as was gas stove use in asthmatic girls not\ntaking prescription respiratory medication. It appeared that\nuse of such medication conferred protection against the\neffects of gas stove use, even though overall, asthma was\nmost clinically severe among asthmatic girls taking such\nmedication.\nThe presence of a dog or cat in the home was consistently\nassociated with increased lung function in asthmatic girls.\nPrevious studies suggest that the presence of animals in the\nhome can protect against incident asthma (24\u00ad27). It has also\nbeen proposed that such protection may be conferred by a\nmodified T-helper cell type 2 (Th2) response to cat antigen.\nSuch a modified Th2 response might stimulate production of\nimmunoglobulin G and not of immunoglobulin E as usually\nassociated with the Th2 response. Such a modified response\nmight lead in turn to reduced skin-test sensitivity to cat\nantigen (28). It is not known whether such a \"desensitiza-\ntion\" response could reduce clinical severity or lung function\ndeficits in preexisting asthma. If so, it might be more likely\nto occur in girls than in boys and it might progress with\nTABLE 6. Model-predicted lung function among non-Hispanic\nWhite asthmatic girls and boys aged 8\u00ad16 years from models\nincluding all asthmatics, by the presence of a pet dog or cat,\nThird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988\u00ad\ndesignated lung function metric and having a dog or cat in relation to\nnot having a dog or cat).\n Exponentials of model-predicted values are given at the\nweighted means of the natural logs of age, standing height, and\nbody mass for Non-Hispanic Whites with triceps skinfold thickness\nat the <90th percentile, no smokers in the home, annual income\norganized physical activities, with reproducible FVC and FEV1\nvalues.\n Unweighted number of subjects.\n\u00a7 FVC, forced vital capacity; FEV1\n, first-second forced expiratory\n, forced expiratory flow between 25 percent and 75\npercent of forced vital capacity.\nPresence of a dog or cat\nNo Yes\nincreasing age or increasing duration of pet ownership. In the\npresent study, there were too few asthmatics for us to test\nthese hypotheses reliably or to test the separate effects of\nhaving a dog and having a cat.\nIn asthmatic girls, the association of having a dog or cat\nwith increased lung function could reflect selective avoid-\nance of pets (29, 30). If so, the prevalence of having a dog or\ncat should be lower in asthmatic girls than in nonasthmatic\ngirls. In fact, weighted prevalences were very similar in asth-\nmatic and nonasthmatic girls (47.3 percent and 48.3 percent,\nrespectively). Thus, we doubt whether avoidance of pets\naccounted for this association.\nTo assess the sensitivity of household environmental\neffects to model specification, we constructed several addi-\ntional models. Specifically, we entered a term for wheezing\nin separate models. We also constructed a model with no\nadjustment for nonreproducibility of FVC or FEV1\nand\nanother excluding nonreproducible measurements. House-\nhold environmental effects were actually somewhat stronger\nin the model with an additional term for wheezing than in the\nstep 3 model.\nUse of a gas stove and having a dog or cat had little or no\ninfluence on lung function in asthmatic boys or in nonasth-\nmatics of either sex. In addition, modeled lung function was\nusually lowest, though not statistically significantly so,\namong subjects with two or more smokers in the home. We\nreran the analytical models as weighted mixed models (the\nMIXED procedure in SAS/STAT software; SAS Institute,\nInc., Cary, North Carolina), treating strata and clusters as\nrandom effects. In nonasthmatic girls, for all metrics but\nlog(FVC), there were significant or marginally significant\nassociations of the presence of two or more household\nsmokers with reduced lung function (p < 0.054). In nonasth-\nmatic boys, the presence of two or more smokers was signif-\nicantly associated with increased log(FVC) and log(FEV1\n)\nand with reduced log(FEV1\n(data not shown). Thus, SUDAAN may yield somewhat\nconservative results regarding the effects of passive\nsmoking.\nMannino et al. (31, 32) investigated the effects of passive\nsmoking among children and adolescents in NHANES III.\nThey excluded subjects who reported active smoking and\nwhose serum cotinine level was greater than 20 ng/ml; they\nthen divided subjects into tertiles of cotinine level as a metric\nof passive smoking. In both the whole sample (31) and the\nsample of asthmatics (32), Mannino et al. reported signifi-\ncantly lower lung function in the high-cotinine tertile than in\nthe low-cotinine tertile. Our results regarding the effects of\npassive smoking are qualitatively similar to those of\nMannino et al., although we observed a statistically signifi-\ncant effect only in asthmatic girls. Differences between\nresults may well reflect differences in analytical strategy.\nFor example, Mannino et al. used serum cotinine as the\nmetric for passive smoking, whereas we used questionnaire\nresponses. In addition, Mannino et al. appear to have\ncombined both sexes into single models, with adjustment for\nsex. In view of the marked sex differences in the effects of\ncovariates in this age group, we conducted sex-specific anal-\nyses.\nThe literature is somewhat inconsistent regarding effects\nof household environmental factors on respiratory health and\nregarding sex differences in sensitivity to these factors. In\nthe Netherlands, Cuijpers et al. (13) reported that boys' lung\nfunction was negatively associated with passive smoking but\nwas not affected by the presence of unvented gas-fueled\nkitchen geysers (water heaters) or pets. In girls, passive\nsmoking and the presence of geysers exhibited limited nega-\ntive associations with lung function. In southern California,\nPeters et al. (33) observed reduced lung function among chil-\ndren living in homes with gas stoves. In Italy, among house-\nholds using gas stoves, Corbo et al. (34) observed a\nsignificant negative association of time spent in the kitchen\nwith girls' lung function but not boys'.\nGas stoves emit the air pollutant nitrogen dioxide. In the\nUnited States, Neas et al. (35) observed no consistent associ-\nation of indoor nitrogen dioxide with children's lung func-\ntion, but they did observe a statistically significant positive\nassociation with respiratory symptoms, including wheezing,\nin girls. In Japan, Shima and Adachi (36) also observed a\nstronger association of indoor nitrogen dioxide with respira-\ntory symptoms in girls than in boys. Overall, the current\nliterature, like the present study, suggests that there are\nstronger respiratory effects of gas cooking among girls than\namong boys. Further research is needed to ascertain why\neffects of household environmental factors differ across\nlocations and subpopulations.\n"
