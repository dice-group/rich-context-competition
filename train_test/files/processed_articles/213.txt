Reynolds, PhD,1 Eileen M. Crimmins, PhD,2 and Yasuhiko Saito, PhD-\nMost studies of health trends emphasize a period\napproach toward examining trends in age-specific pre-\nvalence of health states overtime (Crimmins & Ingegneri,\n1989). A cohort approach provides a different picture\nof health change in a society, one in which the relative\nhealth of successive cohorts, rather than of successive\nyears, is the focus. Period trends in health are poten-\ntially confounded by historical events and conditions\nthat birth cohorts experience at different points in their\nrespective life courses (Manton & Myers, 1987; Manton,\nStailard, & Corder, 1997). Such events include the Great\nDepression and World Wars I and II, as well as the tim-\ning of specific medical advances and technological\ninnovations, changes in health affecting behaviors such\nas diet and smoking, and environmental conditions.\nThose for whom childhood was a period of depri-\nvation because of depression or war may experience\nlasting effects from these events (Barker, 1994). Alter-\nnatively, cohort differences in early-life exposure to\ndisease and pathogens may act to produce differences\nin later-life health. For instance, cohorts born in this\ncentury could experience differential disease later in\nlife because of differential exposure to the influenza\nor to other viral or bacterially caused conditions. Co-\nhorts whose members understand the health risks as-\nsociated with smoking and the consumption of fat at\na relatively young age may take actions that prevent\nthe onset of certain chronic diseases until later age.\nThe changing social circumstances of successive gen-\n1Address correspondence to Sandra L.

The article also exam-\nines whether cohort change is the same for men and\nwomen and for those of lower compared with higher\nsocioeconomic status.\nBackground\nStudies attempting to document changes in cohort\nmortality and health have not all found clear pat-\nterns of improving health in later cohorts. Wilmoth,\nVallin, and Caselli (1990), who studied the mortality\nof French men and women born between 1894 and\n1959, found cohorts that experienced \"peculiarly\"\nhigh mortality. These high-risk cohorts included those\nwho were young adults during the two World Wars,\nthose who were very young during the influenza\nthey studied--those who were born in the 1950s. The\nadverse mortality of the last cohort was attributed\nto changes in obstetrical practices that the authors\nsuggest allowed the survival of the \"nonfit.\" Patrick,\nPalesch, Feinleib, and Brody (1982) found lower death\nrates from heart disease among more recent cohorts,\nbut the pattern of decline suggested a period rather\nthan cohort explanation of causation. Manton and Myers\n(1987) found cohort differences in death rates from\ncancer, heart disease, and stroke and attributed the\ndifferent cohort patterns of change across diseases to\na complex interaction of early-life exposure to disease\nprocesses and response to medical advances. More\nrecently, Manton, Stallard, and Corder (1997) found\nsignificant mortality reduction in old age across those\nthis improvement to improved medical care, reduc-\ntion in exposure to pathogens through a variety of\nmechanisms, and improved nutritional conditions.\nStudies of cohort changes in disease presence have\nfound some support for diminished disease prevalence\nin more recent cohorts. Svanborg (1988) found lower\nlevels of peptic ulcer and gall bladder surgery in more\nrecent cohorts, which he attributes to improvements\nin lifestyle. In a study of disease change over a cen-\ntury, Fogel (1994) found that the level of heart dis-\nease was almost three times higher in older Civil\nWar veterans than in older World War II veterans; he\nattributes decreasing disease prevalence to improve-\nments in nutrition. Cancer incidence has been shown\nto vary widely by cohort, and later-born cohorts, in\ngeneral, have higher levels of many cancers (Davis,\nthe prevalence of disability decreased in the older\npopulation in the United States. Simultaneously, the\nprevalence of some specific diseases decreased among\nolder persons, most notably arthritis and circulatory\nand cerebrovascular conditions. At the same time, the\nprevalence of other conditions increased, including\npneumonia, bronchitis, broken hips, and diabetes.\nManitoba, Roos, Havens, and Black (1993), who com-\npared health status in older adults born in 1971 and\n1983, found more disability and disease among the\nmore recent cohort. In Britain, Jagger, Clarke, and\nClarke (1991), comparing two cohorts of older per-\nsons, found disability levels improved but cognitive\nfunctioning deteriorated for the more recent cohort.\nResearchers who have investigated trends in health\nat younger ages have reported findings that are less\npositive. For instance, Cruenberg (1977) has empha-\nsized the \"failure of success\" in talking about the\npotential effect of the trend in increased survival of\nnigh risk infants and others in weakened health states\non population health. Empirical evidence that is con-\nsistent with this hypothesis is provided by Newacheck,\nBudetti, and Halfon (1986), who found an increase\nafter 1970 in mild disability among children.\nTrends in health change across multiple cohorts and\nages and considering a variety of diseases and disabil-\nity prevalence are, thus, somewhat mixed. The aim of\nthis article is to provide more evidence on the levels\nof disability and the prevalence of major diseases\namong a set of cohorts that span a wide range of birth\nyears and adult ages in the United States.\nData and Methods\nData from the annual National Health Interview Sur-\nanalysis. The NHIS is an ongoing household survey of\nthe noninstitutionalized population of all ages in the\nUnited States. The purpose of the NHIS, which began\nin 1957, is to monitor population health and health\ncare usage; however, the analysis of time trends with\nexisting data is hampered by periodic revision in the\ninterview protocols. A major revision of the survey took\nUsing these data, we examine health and function-\ning indicators for adults 30-69 years of age. We end\nthe analysis before age 70 because the basic disability\nquestions in the NHIS differ for those aged 70 and\nconstructed 15 3-year birth cohorts centered around\nThese cohorts' data are then examined for each of\ncates the central age of each cohort in each year. For\ngraphing purposes, we grouped the survey data into 3\nyear cohorts and 3-year periods are used to produce\nmore stable rates, which better display cohort patterns\nthan those based on a single year or a single age. This\nconfiguration of data produces up to four points of\nobservation for some cohorts, and as few as one for\nother cohorts but the span of ages and years allows\nfor comparisons of successive cohorts at ages that span\nthe adult age range. In the statistical analysis, the data\nare not grouped in the same way; 3-year cohorts are\nidentified as well as the age at interview for each in-\ndividual. The number of respondents in the entire data\nof respondents in each cohort ranges from 9,168 for\nMeasures of Health\nIn the NHIS, long-term disability due to chronic dis-\nease or impairment is indicated by limitation in major\nactivity or in ability to work because of a health prob-\nlem. Respondents are asked what they were \"doing\nmost of trie past 12 months\" and to indicate whether\ntheir major activity consisted of \"working at a job or\nbusiness, keeping nouse, going to school, or something\nelse.\" If respondents indicate that they were keep-\ning house most of the year, they are asked if \"any\nimpairment or health problem now keeps them from\ndoing any housework at all\" or \"limits the kind or\namount of housework they can do.\" If they answer\nany of the other three major activities, they are asked\nwhether \"any impairment or health problem now\nkeeps them from working at a job or business\" or \"limits\nthe kind or amount of work\" they can do. Housekeep-\ners are also asked about any adverse effects of their\nhealth on their ability to work. Respondents report\nwhether they are unable to perform their major activity\nor are limited in the kind or amount of major activity.\nEven in these 12 years, women in these cohorts\nhave experienced changes in the likelihood of report-\nCohort\nYear of Data Collection\ning housekeeping and working as their usual activities\n(Figure 1). Later-born cohorts nave more workers and\nfewer housekeepers at a given age than earlier-born\ncohorts do. In Figure 1, earlier-born cohorts are to\nthe right; later-born cohorts are to the left. At the top\nof the figure, moving leftward each successively born\ncohort has an increasing proportion of its members\nworking at a given age until the 1946 cohort. At the\nbottom of the figure, the pattern is reversed; moving\nleftward there is a decreasing proportion of respon-\ndents reporting housekeeping as a major activity at a\ngiven age among younger cohorts. Because there is so\nmuch change in major activity among women, we used\nreported ability to work as our indicator of disability\nfor both working and nonworking women. This makes\nthe reference for disability assessment similar across\ncohorts of women. In addition, it makes the measure\nof disability similar for men and women, as men pre-\ndominantly report \"working at a job\" as their major\nactivity, and both working and retired persons respond\nto questions on their ability to work.\nIn order to monitor disease prevalence, each re-\nspondent in the NHIS is asked about the presence of\na set of diseases or conditions selected from one of\nsix lists of medical conditions divided according to\nbody systems. Each list is presented to one sixth of\nthe sample to reduce respondent burden. The result\nof this is that researchers cannot determine the preva-\nlence of all diseases for all individuals. Depending on\nthe condition, respondents report whether they have\n\"ever had,\" \"currently have,\" or \"had in the past twelve\nmonths\" selected conditions. This information is used\nto produce cohort prevalence of major diseases. In\nthis analysis, we examined cohort patterns in the pre-\nvalence of arthritis, asthma, bronchitis, cardiovascular\ndiseases, diabetes, emphysema, mental disorders, mus-\nculoskeletal conditions, and orthopedic impairments.\nThese diseases and conditions include the major causes\nof both death and disability for which information is\navailable to determine trends in prevalence.\nIn addition, we examined age and cohort patterns\nin the presence of infectious diseases that result in\nlimitation of major activity for men and women. The\nNHIS does not ask questions about the prevalence of\nchronic infectious diseases in the six lists described\nabove, but because of the rise of AIDS in the past\ntwo decades, examination of the trend in infections\nas a cause of disability seems appropriate. Questions\nabout specific conditions limiting activity, including in-\nfectious diseases, are asked of all respondents, so we\ninclude these responses accordingly.\nMethods of Analysis\nSome of the analysis is presented graphically be-\ncause strong cohort patterns are readily apparent in\nthe graphs. The statistical significance of cohort differ-\nences in health indicators is determined using logistic\nregressions relating the likelihood of having a disabil-\nity (p) or a disease to age and cohort:\nIn (p/1 - p) = a + p/ge + p2\nAge2 + Z. Cohort.,\nand p are the coefficients representing the\nlinear and quadratic effects of age, respectively, and\nZ. is a vector of coefficients representing the effect of\nbeing in a specific cohort (/). The coefficients reflect\ndifferences from the 1937 cohort, which is the middle\nbirth cohort (/ = 0); seven cohorts were born earlier\nthan this cohort, and seven cohorts were born later.\nThis study uses this method to note significant co-\nhort differences but we are aware that, as in most\nstudies of this type, the differences could be inter-\npreted as either cohort or period differences. Although\nanalysts have attempted to separate age, period, and\n--\n\u00a5\ncohort effects, the required assumptions tend to influ-\nence the results heavily (Mason & Fienberg, 1985).\nThis study does not attempt to separate cohort effects\nfrom period effects but rather to determine whether\nthere are significant differences among cohorts. We\nregard this analysis as descriptive of cohort differences\nrather than indicative of cohort causation.\nResults\nCohort differences in disability, as indicated by limita-\ntions in ability to perform major activity or work, are\nshown for men in Figure 2 and for women in Figure\n3. The odds ratios from the logistic regression analysis\nare shown in Table 2. Examination of Figure 2 indi-\ncates that the men of the earliest-born cohorts, ob-\nserved at ages older than 55, appear to be on age\ntrajectories with a higher level of disability than the\nmiddle-aged and middle birth-year cohorts. Indeed,\nthe statistical analysis indicates that the percent of\nmen limited in major activity at a given age is gener-\nally higher in early-born cohorts. The cohorts of 1919\nthan for the 1937 cohort. The cohorts born in the\n1930s appear to be similar to each other, but the\nhort. Later-born cohorts (i.e., those born after 1946)\nappear to be more--not less--limited, by approximately\n8%. This change in cohort trajectory among the young\nis also visible in Figure 2. The cohort pattern for being\nunable to perform major activity is similar to that for\nlimitation described above: there are higher levels of\nimprovements in disability for cohorts born from 1928\nthrough 1943, and then some increase in disability\nfor subsequent cohorts.\nFor women, the cohort pattern in limitation in abil-\nity to work differs somewhat (Figure 3). There is less\nlimitation in earlier-born cohorts at the older ages,\nand the lowest disability levels are for the 1946 and\n1949 cohorts. The later-born cohorts at the younger\nages have higher disability levels, but they are not\nsignificantly different from those of the 1937 cohort.\nFor women, the cohort pattern of inability to work\nis generally one of improving cohort ability to work\namong later-born cohorts. Women born from 1916 to\n1937 to report inability to work, out women born from\nin the 1937 cohort. The last cohort, those born in\n1958, is significantly more likely to report work in-\nability compared with those born in 1937.\nThe Prevalence of Selected Diseases\nCohort differences in the prevalence of selected\ndiseases are indicated in Table 3 (men) and Table 4\n(women) by the coefficients and odds ratios.

The 1916 cohort has a level of em-\nphysema two times that of the 1937 cohort, whereas\n1937 cohort. On the other hand, earlier-born cohorts\nhave lower levels of diabetes and orthopedic im-\npairments. Men from later-born cohorts have higher\nlevels of asthma, although these differences are not\nsignificant, and some cohorts born in the 1950s have\nmore musculoskeletal conditions. There are no clear\ncohort patterns in mental disorders.\nWomen bom before 1937 do not have significantly\nhigher levels of any of these diseases or conditions\nthan the 1937 cohort, with the exception of arthritis.\nof arthritis that are 13-30% higher than that of the\never, have lower levels of asthma, musculoskeletal con-\nditions, and orthopedic impairments, compared with\nafter, there is less arthritis and cardiovascular disease\nthan in the 1937 cohort. Women from these later-\nborn cohorts, however, have higher levels of asthma\nand orthopedic impairments.\nBecause of the tendency toward higher disability\namong the youngest cohorts and the substantial rise\nof AIDS over recent years, this study also examined\ntrends in the probability that an infectious disease\nwas the cause of a reported limitation in major activ-\nity. There is no cohort pattern of change in infectious\ndiseases for men. Among women, there is no cohort\npattern of differences, although the cohort born in 1922\nhas less limitation due to infectious diseases than the\nCohort Differences by Education\nIncreasing differentials in mortality over time have\nbeen observed within the U.S. adult population (Feld-\nman, Makuc, Kleinman, & Cornoni-Huntley, 1989; Pres-\nton & Elo, 1995). Cohort differences in disability and\ndisease prevalence by education level were examined\nto see whether the pattern of change differs for socio-\neconomic groups within the population. The most\ncomparable indicator of cohort socioeconomic status\nis education, but the average education level is chang-\ning markedly across these cohorts.

The line cannot be drawn at\nthe quartile break because in some cohorts education\nlevel is so concentrated that the quartile and median\nare the same. In this analysis, the low education group\nfor the 1916 cohort has 8 or fewer years of educa-\ntion, whereas the low education group for the 1958\ncohort has 11 or fewer years. The percentage of the\ncohort in the low education group ranges from 27%\ncause of the variations in percentage, we tried sepa-\nrating each cohort into low education and high edu-\ncation groups using a variety of breakpoints between\nthe two categories and did not find the results sensi-\ntive to these choices.

More deterioration in health among later-born\ncohorts of men is observed among those with low edu-\ncation. For these men in the 1949 and later cohorts,\nthe level of disability is at least twice as high as in the\nearlier-born cohorts. For high education men, the level\nis significantly lower than the 1937 cohort.\nAmong women with high education levels there\nhas been a trend toward less disability in later-born\nnificantly more disabled than the 1937 cohort, other\ncohorts are generally less disabled.

For these women with low education, there\nis significant deterioration of health among cohorts born\nin the 1950s, with the three latest-born cohorts' rela-\ntive risk of disability increasing by 24-33%.\nCohort differences in the prevalence of selected dis-\neases for the high and low education groups are shown\nin Table 6 (Men) and Table 7 (Women). Many of the\ncohort changes in disease prevalence by education are\nsimilar to those described earlier for the whole popu-\nlation or are not very informative and are omitted from\nthe tables in the interest of brevity. These diseases in-\nclude asthma, bronchitis, diabetes, mental disorders,\nmusculoskeletal conditions, and infectious diseases for\nmen, and bronchitis, diabetes, emphysema, mental dis-\norders, and infectious diseases for women.\nTable 5.

Our\nanalysis indicates, however, that later-born cohorts do\nnot continue to experience improvements in disability\nand that there is some increasing disability for cohorts\nborn in the 1950s. Interestingly, the conorts among\nwhom we find increased disability are the same co-\nhorts that have relatively high mortality in France (Wil-\nPatterns of change differ somewhat by status as the\nrecent deterioration is concentrated among those\nwith low socioeconomic status. There has been much\ndiscussion lately of the widening differentials be-\ntween the \"haves\" and the \"have nots.\" Health status\nis another area in which the fortunes of different\ngroups in society may be moving in different di-\nrections. This relative deterioration in health among\nthose who are least able to cope with disability is a\nworrisome trend.\nCohort patterns of change in disease prevalence are\nalso mixed. Some diseases have declined, but others\nhave increased in prevalence. Where Fogel (1994) found\nsteadily decreasing rates of cardiovascular disease since\nthe Civil War and Manton, Stallard, and Corder (1995)\nfound reductions in cardiovascular diseases for the co-\nthis study found a pattern of steady cohort improve-\nbut not for women. Among women, only cohorts born\nsince World War II have lower levels of cardiovascu-\nlar disease overall, but the cohort pattern of change\nin cardiovascular diseases among women diverges dra-\nmatically by social class. Women with lower educa-\ntion levels have a pattern of improvement in early co-\nhorts while women with more education had lower\nrelative rates for cardiovascular disease before 1937\nthan after. The lack of improvement among better-\neducated women presents an anomalous pattern that\ndeserves further investigation.\nArthritis, the major disabler of women, is a disease\nwith large decreases in prevalence among later-born\ncohorts. This is certainly an encouraging trend because\nit should imply decreased disability as later-born and\ngenerally better-educated cohorts age.\nThere are other trends that are not as positive. For\nexample, respondents in more recent cohorts, espe-\ncially women, are more likely to suffer from asthma.\nThis finding is not surprising given the recent findings\nof increases in the prevalence of asthma among chil-\ndren and young adults in the United States (Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention, 1995) and in other\ncountries (Anderson, Butland, & Strachan, 1994). Our\nfindings indicate, however, that this increase in asthma\nmay have started earlier than previously thought.\nAn increase in orthopedic and musculoskeletal im-\npairments, particularly among people of low education\nlevels, is another discouraging trend among later-born\ncohorts. Potentially, the reduction in both milk con-\nsumption and physical activity among more recent\nco-horts could lead them to have lower bone density,\nless muscle mass, and more musculoskeletal problems.\nFurther investigation of this trend is warranted.\nThus, the potentially good news of improving physi-\ncal disability among cohorts who are now older is\noffset somewhat by increasing levels of disability and\nchronic conditions among younger cohorts. These co-\nhorts appear to be in better cardiovascular shape but\nhave the potential to be more disabled from muscu-\nloskeletal conditions, particularly those cohort mem-\nbers with low levels of education. These results imply\nthat the improvements in older adults' health found\nby previous studies may show a positive trend that\nmay be difficult to sustain in the future.\nThese conclusions are suggestive rather than proof of\nthe cohort patterns described above. As noted in the\nintroduction, it is impossible to separate age, period,\nand cohort effects without making some assumptions.\nWe, too, have made assumptions. Our specification of\nage and cohort effects uses one of many possible op-\nerational models. In order to test the sensitivity of our\nresults to this specification, we have performed the\nanalyses using other approaches: a linear age term only,\na linear cohort term and the quadratic age specifica-\ntion used in the article, and a linear cohort term with\na categorical age variable. Although the results pre-\nsented here are generally robust to the specification of\nage and cohort, some conclusions about patterns of\ncohort differences in specific diseases are sensitive to\nspecification.\nFinally, we have discussed age and cohort effects\nand have neglected period changes. Disability policy\nchange is one period factor that can affect time trends\nin health status. Policies toward disability have gone\nthrough cycles over recent decades: an apparent loosen-\ning of regulations in the 1970s, a subsequent tighten-\ning of the rules during the early 1980s (Bawden &\nPalmer, 1984), with a reduction in the stringency of\nregulations as a reaction in the later 1980s (Schulz,\n1995). Although these policy changes may have\naffected cohort levels of disability differentially, we\ndo not observe consistent cohort patterns that could\nbe attributed to such policy changes.\nReferences\nAnderson, H.
