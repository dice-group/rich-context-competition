This\nstudy aims to establish the prevalence of adequate fruit and vegetable intake and physical activity among community-ambulant\npatients in Singapore.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among community-ambulant patients using convenience sampling. Data\nwere collected through a survey questionnaire, covering self-reported level of physical activity and daily fruit and vegetable\nintake. Demographic information, awareness and adherence to recommendations were summarised using descriptive\nstatistics. To identify factors influencing awareness and behaviour, exploratory logistic regression analyses were performed.\nResults: Three hundred and eighty-five complete responses were analysed. For intake of fruits and vegetables, 29.1% and\n21.3% of participants were aware of and adherent to the fruit and vegetable intake recommendation respectively. For physical\nactivity, 21.3% and 26.8% of study participants were aware of and adherent to the recommendation respectively. Only 4.7%\nand 5.5% of participants were aware of and practising both recommendations respectively. Gender, age, ethnicity and body\nmass index were found to have significant influence on the awareness of the recommendations. However, there was no\nsignificant factor found to be contributing to the adherence to the recommendations.\nConclusion: Awareness of and adherence to lifestyle recommendations among patients remain low despite ongoing\npublicity efforts. Many are not fully aware of and adherent to the dietary and physical activity recommendations publicised.\nApart from intensifying public outreach on every possible occasion and delivering messages in manners understandable by our\nolder patients, strategies targeting the knowledge\u00adbehaviour disconnect among working middle-aged patients also deserve\ncontinued attention in the near future.\n",

Meeting these recom-\nmendations has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovas-\ncular diseases, type-2 diabetes, cancers and premature\nDespite well-known benefits of an active lifestyle, and\nadequate fruit and vegetable intake, health authorities globally\nhave been experiencing difficulty in encouraging their respec-\ntive populations to adopt the recommendations. In a study\nconducted by the United States Centre for Disease Control\nand Prevention, less than 20% of men and 15% of women\nengaged in these two lifestyle strategies.14 In Brazil, more than\nhalf of the adult population was found to be overweight, and\nfailed to practise any kind of physical activity during leisure\ntime, or consume fruits and vegetables regularly.15,16 Similarly\nin Singapore, the 2010 National Health Survey revealed that\nonly one in five adults engaged in regular exercise during their\nleisure time. Even with inclusion of physical activity at work,\nand walking or cycling while travelling to and from places in\naddition to leisure-time physical activity, only six in 10 adults\nhad sufficient total physical activity.17,18\nIn an effort to improve adherence to recommendations\nand combat chronic diseases, a wide range of research and\ninterventions have been trialled, with limited success.19\u00ad21 In\nSingapore, for instance, the Ministry of Health has recently\ndeclared war on diabetes and rolled out a series of long term\ncampaigns, such as the `Eat, Drink, Shop Healthy' Challenge\nand National Steps Challenge, to encourage active lifestyle\nand healthy eating habits, including adequate fruit and vegeta-\nble intake.22,23 While such publicity strategies through mass\neducation campaigns, news coverage and advertisements\nhave also been implemented in various settings, it is not\nknown how much impact these efforts have on actual behav-\nioural changes, especially among patients with existing medi-\ncal conditions and chronic diseases.24\u00ad26 As such, our\ncross-sectional study aims to establish current prevalence of\nadequate fruit and vegetable intake and physical activity\namong community-ambulant patients in Singapore. A second-\nary exploratory objective is to investigate the associations\nwith socio-demographic and contribution of different factors\ntowards awareness of and adherence to recommendations\nfor physical activity and intake of fruits and vegetables. This\nwill help to guide the future development of health promo-\ntion strategies that aim to reduce the burden of obesity and\nchronic diseases.\nMethods\nStudy design and data collection\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted in a 330-bed acute\ncare hospital in Singapore, from September 2016 to\nDecember 2016. Participants were selected by convenience\nsampling among patients filling prescriptions at the outpatient\npharmacy. Inclusion criteria for participant selection were: (1)\ncommunity-ambulant adult patients between the age of 21\nand 80 years who are not confined to bed or institutionalised\nas a result of disease or surgery; (2) without prescribed\nrestriction of diet and exercise; (3) able to communicate in\nEnglish or Mandarin. Participants were excluded if they with-\ndrew their participation at any point of the data collection or\nwere unable or unwilling to give verbal consent for participa-\ntion. The study protocol was vetted by Singhealth Centralised\nThe three-page survey questionnaire was administered by a\nsingle study investigator, who would clarify queries and rein-\nforce definitions to the respondents during data collection. The\nquestionnaire (Appendix 1) was divided into three section:\ndemographic information, dietary habits and exercise regime.\nBoth open-ended and closed-ended questions were used to\nelicit information from the participants. Separate illustrative\ncharts for exercise types and portion sizes for food (Appendix\n2) were also used during data collection to help participants\nestimate their level of physical activity and daily fruit and vege-\ntable intake. While there may be varying interpretations and\naspects of `adequacy' in fruit and vegetable intake and physical\nactivity in different countries or healthcare settings, we define\nthe standards for the purpose of this study as adherence to\nSingapore's Health Promotion Board (HPB) recommendations:\n(1) two servings of fruits and two servings of vegetables daily,\nand (2) at least 150 min of moderate-intensity aerobic physical\nactivity per week, or 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic activ-\nity, or equivalent alternatives. These recommendations have\nbeen consistently conveyed over the years while other guide-\nlines such as the food pyramid and macro-nutrient consump-\ntions have undergone considerable revisions.\nSample size calculation and statistical\nanalyses\nBased on an infinite population, with 5% margin of error and\nDemographic information, awareness and adherence to life-\nstyle recommendations were summarised using descriptive\nstatistics. Predictive ability of awareness towards actual adher-\nence to recommendations was determined using one-way\nanalysis of variance. To identify factors influencing awareness\nand behaviour, logistic regression analyses were performed\nwith the following patient demographics: gender, age, ethnic-\nity, education level, body mass index (BMI), history of long\nterm medication use, tobacco use and alcohol consumption.\nAll the analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Version 17.0\n(Chicago: SPSS Inc.).\nOutcome measures\nThe primary outcome measure of this study was the preva-\nlence of adequate fruit and vegetable intake and adequate\nphysical activity among community-ambulant patients in\nSingapore. The secondary exploratory outcome measure\nwas significance of selected demographic factors affecting\nawareness and adherence to at least one of the dietary and\nlifestyle recommendations of interest.\nResults\nIn total, 389 patients were approached at the hospital's outpa-\ntient pharmacy for survey participation while they were waiting\nfor their prescriptions to be filled. Three hundred and eighty-\nfive patients completed the survey questionnaire. Figure 1\ndetails the participant enrolment process for the study.\nGoh et al. 3\nCharacteristics of the participants\nwere male, with most of them above 40 years of age (68.3%)\nand of Chinese ethnicity (54.0%). The majority of the partici-\npants had at least secondary education (76.9%). The mean BMI\nof the participants was 22.81 kg/m2. Other demographic char-\nacteristics of the study participants are summarised in Table 1.\nAwareness of and adherence to\nrecommendations\nFor intake of fruits and vegetables, 29.1% of participants were\naware of the recommendation on daily intake of two servings\nof fruits and two servings of vegetables. However, they con-\nsumed only 1.04 servings of fruits and 1.78 servings of vege-\ntables daily on average, with 78.7% of participants failing to\nconsume the recommended two servings of fruits and two\nservings of vegetables on any typical day. Common reasons\ngiven for non-adherence were personal dislike of fruits\nFor physical activity, 21.3% of study participants were\naware of the recommendations by HPB. The mean time\nspent on moderate-intensity physical activity was 90 min per\nweek and 73.2% of participants reported that they did not\nengage in at least 150 min of moderate-intensity physical\nactivity on any typical week. Common reasons given for physi-\ncal inactivity were perceived poor health (40.4%) and laziness\nticipants were aware of both recommendations and 21\n(5.5%) patients reported to have met both recommenda-\ntions. About one in four participants were aware of and were\nable to meet either recommendation respectively. One hun-\ndred and fifty-four (40.0%) participants were reportedly\nunable to meet the recommendations as they were not aware\nof them in the first place. On the other hand, 73 (19.0%)\nparticipants failed to meet the recommendations despite\nbeing aware of them. Surprisingly, there were 97 (25.2%) par-\nticipants who met the recommendations despite not being\naware of them. That was reportedly due to their general\nawareness of health benefits for dietary fibre intake and exer-\ncise while not knowing the specific recommended amounts.\nThese findings are tabulated in Table 2.\nAwareness in dietary recommendation was not predictive\nto 0.755); similarly, awareness in physical activity recommen-\ndation was also not predictive of corresponding behaviour\nFactors affecting awareness and adherence\nTwo logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the\ninfluence of pre-defined demographic factors that may be asso-\nciated with levels of awareness and adherence to at least one of\nthe dietary and lifestyle recommendations of interest. Gender,\nage group, ethnicity and BMI were found to have significant influ-\nence on the awareness of the recommendations. Collectively,\nthese four factors alone explained 20.2% of the variation.\nOn the other hand, there was no significant factor found\nto be contributing to the adherence to the recommenda-\ntions. These findings are summarised in Tables 3 and 4\nrespectively.\nDiscussion\nConsiderable evidence has accumulated in recent decades\nregarding the importance of adequate physical activity and\nintake of fruits and vegetables in the management of\nchronic diseases.29\u00ad31 A review of literature revealed that\nFigure 1.

Although\nsimilar findings have been reported and reasons were\nexplored in similar studies from other countries, the observa-\ntion from our study may be further explained by several addi-\ntional reasons befitting the cultural context in Singapore.14\u00ad16\nedly `disliked fruits' and `disliked vegetables' respectively.\nThese personal preferences and perceptions could be a result\nof lifestyle habits adopted since their youth due to potential\neconomic reasons or low recognition of the associated health\nbenefits by the parents then.37 At the national level, there\nmay be a need to study and review the state of nutrition edu-\ncation and awareness, identify gaps and determine whether\nongoing nutrition messages are indeed achieving their\nintended objectives among the average Singaporeans.\nSecond, 42.3% of our study participants claimed that they\ndid not have time to prepare healthier food at home. Hectic\nwork commitment and related stress may be contributors to\nthis phenomenon.38 It was also noted that as the proportion\nof dual-income families increases due to rising costs of living,\nthe practice of eating out has become increasingly common in\nSingapore.39,40 However, food items sold in most eateries in\nSingapore are not usually served with fruits, these having to be\npurchased separately. In addition, the vegetable component in\nlocal food choices is also often small in portion size. Collectively,\nthese may help to explain the external factors surrounding the\nlack of fruit and vegetable intake among our participants.\nThird, there seemed to be considerable inertia among our\npatients with self-reported `poor health' to get physically active.\nphysical inactivity 76 (40.4%) cited poor health. Nonetheless, it\nwas unclear whether those who cited poor health as the\nreason were indeed unsuitable for the recommended level of\nTable 2.

However, it is worth noting that travel-related activi-\nties may be of lower intensity and it has been suggested that\ntheir health effects might be less significant than those of pur-\nposeful exercise.43,44 As well, regular exercise may confer\nadditional benefits beyond general health, such as physical fit-\nness, dexterity, strength or even quality of life.43,45\u00ad47 The\nfinding that despite engaging in less physical exercise many\nSingaporeans are still able to achieve relatively high levels of\ntotal daily physical activity, if travel-related activities are\nincluded, has lessons to be learnt for the selection and imple-\nmentation of appropriate health promotion strategies at the\nnational level. Studying the patterns of travel-related activity\nagainst different socio-demographic characteristics may shed\nlight on unmet needs in supportive infrastructure. Other\nstrategies, such as promoting work\u00adlife balance and work-\nplace physical activities, heightening awareness of exercise\nand recreational facilities and encouraging supportive work-\nplace cultures, may need to be considered.\nFrom the exploratory logistic regression models, it was\nfound that gender, age, ethnicity and BMI were significant fac-\ntors that may affect the awareness of lifestyle recommenda-\ntions, but only managed to collectively explain 20.2% of the\nvariation in the rate of awareness. Moreover, none of the fac-\ntors included in the regression model for adherence behav-\niour turned out to be significant. It echoed the findings of\nmany previous studies that issues relating to lifestyle and\nbehaviour are often multifaceted, involving the interplay of\nmany known and unknown variables.14\u00ad18 As such, it is unlikely\nthat the problems of low awareness of and low adherence to\nhealthy lifestyle practices may be addressed by a few simple\nor targeted solutions. Nonetheless, the least that healthcare\nprofessionals and health campaigners may do is to seize every\npossible opportunity to remind and motivate patients to take\ngreater initiative in adopting a healthier lifestyle and greater\nownership in maintaining their health in the community. This\nmay just help to persuade some patients contemplating it to\nactually begin their journey of behavioural change.48\nTo our knowledge, this is the first local study to evaluate\nawareness of and adherence to lifestyle recommendations\namong community-ambulant patients and the results of this\nstudy could provide healthcare professionals and government\norganisations with insights to improve future health promotion\ninitiatives in Singapore. The survey was intentionally designed to\nbe short and simple, covering only pertinent questions to\nanswer our study investigations. This led to an impressive\nresponse rate of 99%, thereby reducing the risk of selection\nbias. Moreover, all the questionnaires were administered by a\nsingle investigator with the use of illustrative charts and dia-\ngrams. These helped to improve consistency in survey responses\nand minimise potential information bias during data collection.\nThere were some limitations in this study. Given that this\nwas a cross-sectional study, it may not be appropriate to\nextrapolate the findings to other time points. Data collection\nwas done under the assumption that there was minimal\nreporting bias, and that any ongoing health campaigns, such as\nthe War on Diabetes and National Steps Challenge, had mini-\nmal influence on the responses during the recall period.22,23 It\nwas a deliberate decision to include only community ambulant\npatients in this study because the study team believed that this\ngroup of patients has good potential to be engaged and influ-\nenced through measures and intervention to encourage adop-\ntion of healthier lifestyles. However, the study team was not\nable to sample patients from the community who have their\nconditions managed solely by general practitioners. This limits\nthe generalisability of the study findings to other patient\ngroups who may have milder diseases not requiring specialist\ncare. In addition, the definition over what may constitute\nTable 4.

For this study, we based our awareness\nof and adherence to `healthy lifestyle' solely on Singapore's\nHPB's recommendations. Therein lies a potential bias as\npatients who are aware and adherent to recommendations\nother than HPB's would be classified as unaware of or non-\nadherenttoourstudy-specificrecommendations.Nonetheless,\nwe settled on HPB's ongoing recommendations as the team\nfelt that they were probably the most applicable in our local\ncontext. As most data were self-reported by the respondents,\nthere could be recall bias. To mitigate this risk, we used illustra-\ntive charts to help the respondents during the recall process,\nand worded the questions neutrally without informing the\nrespondents of what were the actual target recommenda-\ntions. Finally, we did not attempt to collect personal data that\nmay contain possible confounders, such as personal income\ndata, occupation and exposure to social media, for our logistic\nregression models. As a result, the possibility of residual con-\nfounding from unmeasured demographic factors could not be\nruled out and this could have influenced the results.\nIn conclusion, our study findings suggest that awareness of\nand adherence to lifestyle recommendations among patients\nremain low despite years of publicity effort. Many commu-\nnity-ambulant patients in Singapore are not fully aware of and\nadherent to the dietary and physical activity recommenda-\ntions that were publicised. Apart from intensifying public out-\nreach at every possible occasion and delivering messages in\nmanners understandable by our older patients, strategies\ntargeting the knowledge\u00adbehaviour disconnect among work-\ning middle-aged patients who are aware of the recommenda-\ntions but choose not to act on them also deserve continued\nattention in the near future.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency in\nthe public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
