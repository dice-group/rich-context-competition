We were interested in determining whether adolescents who bully others enjoy a key evolutionary\nbenefit: increased dating and mating (sexual) opportunities. This hypothesis was tested in two independent samples consisting of\n334 adolescents and 144 university students. The data partly supported our prediction that bullying, but not victimization, would\npredict dating behavior. The data for sexual behavior more clearly supported our hypothesis that bullying behavior predicts an\nincrease in sexual opportunities even when accounting for age, sex, and self-reports of attractiveness, likeability, and peer vic-\ntimization. These results are generally congruent with the hypothesis that bullying perpetration is, at least in part, an evolutionary\nadaptive behavior.\n",

Marini1,\nand Tracy Vaillancourt3\n Keywords\nbullying, evolution, dating, sex, sexual behavior\nIntroduction\nBullying is a behavior that appears to peak in adolescence,\nestimated to directly affect hundreds of millions of adolescents\neach year, worldwide (Volk, Craig, Boyce, & King, 2006).\nExamples of adolescent bullying are found in historical texts\nhunter-horticulturalists (Chagnon, 1983), and appears in every\nmodern society in which it has been measured (Craig et al.,\n2009). In fact, the pervasiveness of bullying has led to sugges-\ntions that bullying (as opposed to victimization or bully victi-\nmization) is, at least in part, influenced by evolutionary mental\nadaptations (Kolbert & Crothers, 2003; Volk, Camilleri, Dane,\nline further evidence for the adaptive nature of bullying beha-\nvior and propose that bullying be defined as a goal-oriented\nbehavior that has theoretically evolutionarily adaptive roots.\nOne such goal may be to increase one's dating and mating (sex)\nopportunities. Unfortunately, relatively little is known about\nthe link between bullying and dating and sexual behavior\namong adolescents. We therefore sought to review the evi-\ndence for bullying as a potentially adaptive behavior prior to\nturning our attention to dating and sexual behavior. We then\npresent two studies that explore the potentially adaptive link\nbetween bullying perpetration (i.e., bullying) adolescent dating\nand sexual behavior.\nBullying as an Adaptive Behavior\nA behavioral genetics study calculated that 61% of the varia-\nbility in bullying perpetration was due to genetic rather than\nenvironmental factors (Ball et al., 2008). Bullying is also\nsignificantly correlated with behavior traits known to have a\nsignificant genetic component, such as personality and tem-\nperament (Book, Volk, & Hosker, 2012; Farrell, Della\n1 Department of Child and Youth Studies, Brock University, St. Catharines,\nCanada\n2 Department of Psychology, Brock University, St. Catharines, Canada\n3 Faculty of Education and School of Psychology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa,\nCanada\nCorresponding Author:\nAnthony A.

Rather, these data offer support the idea\nthat there exist sufficient genetic linkages and individual var-\niation to have allowed for natural and/or sexual selection to\nevolve facultative mental predispositions that, in combination\nwith the right environmental cues, can result in behavior such\nas bullying (Ellis et al., 2012). That is, the presumably con-\nditional nature of bullying relies on the right confluence of\ninternal and external ecological factors (Hong & Espelage,\n2012). We have predicted that bullying is associated with at\nleast three benefits, reputation, resources, and reproduction,\nall of which are likely to be associated with passing on one's\ngenes to future generations (Volk et al., 2014).\nTo begin with, bullies are perceived as being more popular\nthan adolescents who do not bully others (Caravita, Di Blasio,\nHymel, & McDougall, 2003; Veenstra, Lindenberg, Mun-\nniksma, & Dijkstra, 2010). They are also ranked as being more\nsocially dominant (Vaillancourt et al., 2003). Moreover, a\nrecent longitudinal study found that, over time, high levels of\nbullying were highly positively related to high social status as\nindexed by perceived popularity (Reijntjes et al., 2013). This\nstudy also demonstrated that bullies appeared to maintain mod-\nest to high levels of likeability among their peers, in contrast\nwith previous literature (e.g., Salmivalli, 2010). Overall, effect\nsizes in the above-cited literature for dominance-related mea-\nsures range from medium to large, suggesting that bullying is a\npotential path to gaining a powerful social reputation.\nAlthough a dominant social reputation is the best studied\nbenefit of bullying, there are other benefits to bullying that\nhave been noted in the literature. Bullies can also gain access\nto greater economic (e.g., Flanagan, 2007) or physical\nresources (Turnbull, 1972). Under intense survival conditions,\nbullying for food access can be a matter of life or death (e.g.,\nTurnbull, 1972). When compared to adolescents not involved\nwith bullying, teens who bully others show as good or better\nmental health (Volk et al., 2006), physical health (Juvonen,\nGraham, & Schuster, 2003), and social skills (Garandeau, &\nCillessen, 2006), including leadership (Vaillancourt et al.,\n2003). This in in stark contrast to victims of bullies and espe-\ncially bully victims who show poorer mental and physical\nhealth than adolescents not involved in bullying, particularly\nonce family and childhood risk factors have been taken into\nFinally, as we have suggested, bullies may also benefit from\nthat the selective regime used by evolution is whether a gene\nincreases or decreases in frequency, reproduction is a key evo-\nlutionary variable (Dawkins, 1989). Thus, an important ques-\ntion for determining whether bullying is an evolutionarily\nadaptive is whether or not it is associated with increased mating\nsuccess. Prior to addressing this question, we briefly review the\nliterature on adolescent dating and sexual behavior.\nAdolescent Dating and Sexual Behavior\nAdolescence is a period of change that is greatly influenced by\nthe development of sexual characteristics and sexual behavior\n(Baams, Dubas, Overbeek, & van Aken, 2015). It is not sur-\nprising therefore that adolescence is generally the period when\nmost individuals begin to date and/or have sex. Dating is the\nmost common expression of adolescents' newly developed\ninterest in romantic relationships, with the normative mean age\nof onset for dyadic dating being approximately 13, and about\n80% of adolescents reporting having had a date prior to grad-\nuating high school (Connolly, Nguyen, Pepler, Craig, & Jiang,\n35% of youth have had sexual intercourse by the end of eighth\ngrade (*13 years of age), and approximately 75% have had a\nsexual experience prior to leaving high school (Alan Guttma-\nFurthermore, dating is likely to afford opportunities for sexual\nbehavior (Zimmer-Gembeck & Helfland, 2008). It is important\nto note that there is a wide individual variability in sexual\nbehavior among adolescents in terms of both initial onset and\nfrequency (Connolly, Craig, Goldberg, & Pepler, 2004;\nIn general, dating is a normative adolescent behavior that\nhas significant links to adolescent development and psycho-\nsocial well-being (Collins, 2003). For many adolescents, dat-\ning is associated with positive outcomes for the individual and\ntheir social standing (Kuttler & LaGreca, 2004). However,\nthere is also a potentially darker side to dating. It can be\nassociated with an increase in victimization and violence at\nthe hand of dating partners (Wekerle & Wolfe, 1999). It may\nalso expose individuals to increased aggression from other\nadolescents who view the victim as a competitor (Leenaars,\ninitial research has demonstrated that the early onset of dating\nbehavior can be associated with maladaptive psychosocial\noutcomes (Zimmer-Gembeck, Siebenbruner, & Collins,\n2001). However, more recent research reveals a more nuanced\npicture, whereby the match between an individual's goals and\nbehavior plays an important role in the strength and valence of\nsocial outcomes (Kelly, Zimmer-Gembeck, & Boislard-P,\n2012). Many adolescents express goal-oriented desires related\nto dating and sexual satisfaction and report positive psycho-\nsocial outcomes related to pursuing these goals (Kelly et al.,\n2012). Interestingly, this same study found a positive link\nbetween social status seeking and sexual (but not dating)\nbehavior (Kelly et al., 2012). As previously mentioned, status\nand sex are two goals that are also believed to be outcomes\nassociated with bullying behavior (Volk et al., 2014). This\nsuggests that perhaps there may be common goals that link\nsome adolescents' desire to bully others (i.e., gain status) and\ntheir desire to have sex.\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nBullying, Dating, and Sexual Behavior\nAlthough the link between general aggression and dating/sex\nhas been relatively well explored (Archer, 2009; Basile, Espe-\nlage, Rivers, McMahon, & Simon, 2009; Bjorklund & Hawley,\nined the links between dating/sex and bullying specifically.\nBullying is a special case of aggression that is primarily differ-\nentiated on the basis of power (Olweus, 1994; Vaillancourt\n2014). Specifically, individuals who bully are more powerful\nthan their victims, who in turn have difficulty defending them-\nselves (Vaillancourt et al., 2003), whereas individuals who\nemploy general aggression are not necessarily more powerful\nthan those they attack (Hawley, Stump, & Ratliff, 2010). From\nan evolutionary perspective, there are many potential reasons\nwhy bullies should enjoy increased reproductive benefits. Bul-\nlies generally elevated social and physical attributes may offer\na signal of good genes (Vaillancourt et al., 2003; Volk et al.,\n2012). Furthermore, their social dominance and ability to con-\ntrol resources are also likely to be reasons why bullies appear\nmore attractive to partners than nonbullies as a signal that they\ncould provide for and protect their partner and potential off-\nence of increased bullying (Volk et al., 2006) and dating\n(Zimmer-Gembeck, 2002) during adolescence may help\nexplain why antibullying interventions often fail to work (or\nare iatrogenic) among older adolescents. They fail because they\ndo not address the novel, sexually motivated goals of adoles-\ncents that foster new forms and goals of competition that are\ngenerally absent among younger children (Volk et al., 2014;\nIn one of only a few studies to directly measure bullying and\ndating, Connolly, Pepler, Craig, and Taradash (2000) found\nthat bullying (in both sexes) was associated with an earlier\nentrance into puberty and dating at a younger age, more activity\nwith members of the opposite sex, greater dating opportunities,\nand being more likely to be in a dating relationship. However,\nArnocky and Vaillancourt (2012) recently reported that while\npeer-reported indirect aggression was associated with\nincreased reports of dating, self-reported bullying was not asso-\nciated with any increase in reported dating. Peer-reported bul-\nlying was not examined in this study, although in most studies,\npeer reports of physical and indirect aggression correlated with\npeer reports of bullying at .50\u00ad.80 (e.g., Vaillancourt et al.,\n2003). Nevertheless, results from Arnocky and Vaillancourt's\nstudy raises some doubt about the link between bullying and\nreproductive success given that self-identified bullies did not\nreport higher dating levels.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are currently no studies\nthat measure bullying in conjunction with reported sexual\nbehavior. Although dating is an important variable relating to\nsexual behavior (Zimmer-Gembeck & Helfland, 2008), it rep-\nresents an indirect proxy of evolutionary reproductive success.\nReports of sexual behavior may still be indirect as they do not\ndirectly measure number of viable offspring, but they are likely\nto be more strongly correlated with ultimate reproductive suc-\ncess than dating variables (Gangestad & Simpson, 2000).\nCurrent Study\nGiven the aforementioned limitations, we conducted two stud-\nies in which the relation between bullying behavior and both\ndating and sexual behavior were examined in a sample of\nyounger adolescents and a sample of older adolescents. Con-\nsistent with most of the previous literature on aggression, we\npredicted that dating and sexual behavior would be signifi-\ncantly related to bullying. We predicted that bullies would\nreport higher levels of dating and sexual activity. We were also\ninterested in the effects of bullying when compared to other\nknown correlates of dating and sexual behavior such as attrac-\ntiveness (Walster, Aronson, Abrahams, & Rottmans, 1966) or\nboth are positively related to dating (Arnocky & Vaillancourt,\n2012), we predicted that bullying would still independently\npredict dating and bullying.\nGiven the lack of evidence for sex differences, as well as the\nlack of sex differences in previous literature (Connolly, Pepler,\nCraig, & Taradash, 2000), we used participants' sex as a con-\ntrol variable without any specific a priori predictions.\nMaterial and Method\nBecause the two studies generally relied upon similar meth-\nodologies, we present them in a unified methods and results.\nHowever, we believe that the underlying differences between\nthe samples are large enough for us to not combine the data into\na single analysis yet still small enough to make a single pre-\nsentation more parsimonious.\nParticipants\nin extracurricular athletic (e.g., hockey and gymnastics) or\nyouth clubs (e.g., church youth groups, pathfinders/guides)\nfrom across Southern Ontario participated in the present study.\nThe sample was primarily Caucasian (Caucasian 86%; 12%\nAsian; and 2% Black) and reported as belonging to the\nStudy 2. A total of 143 first-year university students (39 men\nand 104 women) from an Ontario university were recruited\nunder the condition that in the past year they had graduated\nprimarily Caucasian (Caucasian 75%; 8% Asian; 6% Black;\nlower class; and 22% upper class).\nVolk et al. 3\nMeasures\nParticipants were asked to provide information on demo-\ngraphics, followed by questionnaires pertaining to social rela-\ntionships in school and their primary organization or athletic\ngroup (the latter were used for a study of athletes' personal\nrelationships).\nBullying and victimization. Participants filled out a bullying ques-\ntionnaire regarding their school-based bullying behavior\n(adapted from Volk & Lagzdins, 2009). To measure victimiza-\ntion and bullying, respectively, participants were asked to rate\ntheir behavior associated with physical, verbal, social, cyber,\nand sexual bullying. For example, participants were asked\n``How often have you been hit, kicked, or punched by someone\nwho was much stronger or more popular than you?'' or ``How\noften have you hit, kicked, or punched someone who was much\nweaker or less popular than you?'' or ``How often have you\nmade sexual jokes, comments, or gestures aimed at someone\nmuch weaker or less popular last term?'' Participants could\nanswer with one of the five frequencies: not at all, only a few\ntimes this year, every month, every week, or many times a\nweek. The scales showed good reliability for bullying (a \u00bc\n.72) and victimization (a \u00bc .75). These questions were phrased\nin the past tense (``Overall, how often did you hit, kick, or\npunch . . . '') for Study 2. The scales showed similar reliability\n(bullying a \u00bc .75 and victimization a \u00bc .77).\nDating and sexual behavior\nIn both studies, participant dating behavior was assessed with\nthe same set of several questions. Participants were first asked\nto rate how interested they were in dating on a Likert-type scale\nof 1\u00ad3 corresponding to not very, somewhat, or very interested.\nParticipants then answered if they had started dating, and if so,\nat what age, and with how many different partners. To measure\nsexual behavior, participants were asked whether they had vol-\nuntary sexual activity of any kind since the age of 12 (see\nTolman & McClelland, 2011, for a review of adolescent sexual\nbehavior). If yes, they then answered at what age they first had\nsex and how many sexual partners they had.\nSelf-reported likeability. In both studies, likeability was assessed\nusing an item from the Strengths and Difficulties Question-\nnaire (2001) that asked participants whether the following\nstatement was not true, somewhat true, or certainly true:\n``Other people my age like me.'' Goodman's factor analysis\n(2001) suggested that the ``likeability'' item was less strongly\nrelated to the other items in the general peer relations factor,\nproviding justification for our using it separately from other\npeer items (that include confounding factors for our study\nsuch as victimization).\nSelf-perceived attractiveness. In both studies, we measured self-\nperceived physical attractiveness by asking participants how\nphysically attractive they felt on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 10\n(highest).\nProcedure\nStudy 1. Local extracurricular organizations were contacted\nthrough existing connections with the researchers and through\nphone or e-mail solicitations. Adult extracurricular supervisors\nwere briefed and asked to provide written consent to approach\ntheir adolescent participants. Researchers then visited partici-\npating clubs to brief participants about the study and its meth-\nods. To reduce participant bias, participants were told it was a\nstudy of peer relationships. Participants were given two envel-\nopes to bring home. The first envelope contained a parental\nletter of information and consent. The second envelope con-\ntained a participant letter of assent and the questionnaires,\nwhich they completed in private, at a time of their choosing.\nBoth parental consent and participant assent were required.\nParents were asked to not discuss the study prior to its com-\npletion to avoid biasing their child's answers and to ensure\nconfidentiality. Participants were protected from any personal\nliability associated with their answers, and participation was\nvoluntary with no penalty for withdrawing.\nAt a predetermined date, the participants returned their\nforms and received a verbal debriefing. After this debriefing,\nparticipants were asked to complete a second assent form\nbecause of the incomplete initial briefing. The participants then\nreceived $15 for their participation.\nStudy 2. Participants were recruited through the use of posters\nas well as the introductory psychology research participant\nprogram. Participants were brought to the lab where they were\nbriefed, asked to give consent, and then fill out the various\nmaterials. Upon completion, participants were debriefed and\ngiven 1.0 credits (1% grade increase) for the participant pool or\n$10. The methods of both studies were approved by a univer-\nsity research ethics board.\nResults\nAll analyses were conducted using SPSS 22's bootstrap anal-\nysis option, each bootstrap being performed with 1,000 itera-\ntions. To begin with, we examined the zero-order correlations.\nGiven the ordinal or nominal nature of most of the data, we\nused Spearman's correlations to determine the relations\nbetween the variables (see Tables 1 and 2).\nIn both studies, victimization was modestly, positively cor-\nrelated with bullying and number of dating partners. In Study 1,\nvictimization was negatively associated with age of first dating\nand positively associated with having had sex. In Study 2,\nvictimization was positively correlated with number of sexual\npartners and negatively correlated with self-perceived\nlikeability.\nIn both studies, bullying was significantly positively corre-\nlated with having dated, number of dating partners, having had\nsexual activity, and number of sexual partners. In Study 1, it\nwas positively associated with an interest in dating, and in\nStudy 2, it was positively associated with self-perceived attrac-\ntiveness and negatively associated with age of first sexual\n4 Evolutionary Psychology\nexperience. The only significant sex differences among the\nvictimization and bullying correlations were that in Study 1,\nthe association between bullying and dating interests was stron-\nger for girls (rs\n\u00bc .28) than for boys (rs\nand in Study 2, the association between bullying and number of\ndating partners was stronger for women (rs\n(rs\nThere were different patterns of correlations among the\nremaining variables between the two studies. Attractiveness\nwas positively related to having dated, number of dating part-\nners, and self-perceived likeability in Study 1, while in Study 2,\nattractiveness was positively associated with bullying, number\nof dating partners, having had sex, and number of sexual part-\nners, as well as being negatively correlated with age of first\ndating. In Study 1, likeability was only correlated with attrac-\ntiveness, whereas in Study 2, it was negatively correlated with\nvictimization and positively correlated with number of dating\npartners and having had sex.\nTable 1.

Significant values are bolded.\nVolk et al. 5\nOur second analysis focused on exploring the relation\nbetween a dimensional measure of bullying and victimization\nand having dated (dating experience) or having had sexual\nactivity (sexual experience) while controlling for the potential\ninfluence of participants' sex, age, attractiveness, and like-\nability. For each of the two studies, we conducted two sepa-\nrate logistic regressions for having dated and for having had\nsexual activity. In the first step, we included age and sex, with\nbullying perpetration and peer victimization in Step 2, and\nattractiveness in Step 3. We present our results without like-\nability as the final step because likeability was not a signifi-\ncant multivariate predictor of dating or sexual behavior and its\ninclusion did not alter any of the patterns of our results. With\nthat in mind, Table 3 shows that in Study 1, being younger,\nmale, and attractive were related to having dated in the final\nmodel, while in Study 2, bullying was the only significant\npredictor in the second step of the model (the model was no\nlonger significant once attractiveness was added).\nTable 3 also shows that bullying was predictive of number\nof dating partners. In Study 1, it was only significant in the\nsecond step of the model (adding attractiveness lowered the\nsignificance of the model), whereas in Study 2, in the final step\nof the model, it was significant alongside attractiveness. In both\nstudies, being older was a significant predictor of having had a\nsexual experience.\nOur third analysis focused on exploring the relation between\nmeasures of bullying and victimization and number of dating or\nsexual partners while controlling for the potential influence of\nsex, age, and attractiveness (as again, likeability was not a\nsignificant multivariate factor in any of the analyses). This\nallowed us to test whether bullying predicted a quantitative\nrelation with dating and sex as compared to the qualitative\ndifference of having had dated/sexual experience or not. The\nhierarchical linear regression for Study 1 revealed that being\nmale and being a victim were positive multivariate predictors\nof number of dating partners, with the final model explaining\n14% of the variance. Interestingly, despite being a larger uni-\nvariate predictor, bullying was not a significant multivariate\npredictor of number of dating partners. We ran a follow-up\nregression adding a fourth step testing for a Bullying \u00c2 Victim\ninteraction, but no significant effect was found (we repeated\nthis in all the other regressions with similar null results). In\nStudy 2, being male, a bully, a victim, or attractive were all\npositive predictors of number of dating partners (combining to\nexplain roughly 30% of the variance in the model). The data for\nnumber of sexual partners were more congruent between the\ntwo studies, with both final models revealing bullying to be a\npositive predictor of number of sexual partners (age was also a\npositive predictor in Study 1). The overall effect sizes were\nof the variance.\nDiscussion\nWe predicted that as an evolutionarily adaptive behavior, bul-\nlying would be positively associated with dating and sexual\nbehavior. Our results offer mixed support for our hypothesized\npositive link between bullying and dating behavior but more\nclearly supported our hypothesized positive link between bul-\nlying and sexual behavior.\nBullying and Dating Behavior\nThere were several significant univariate relations between\nbullying and dating, suggesting that bullying is related to an\nincreased interest in dating (Study 1), an increased likelihood\nof having dated, and a greater number of dating partners.\nAlthough dating is a more distal indicator of reproductive suc-\ncess than sexual behavior, our univariate data nonetheless offer\nsome supporting evidence regarding the potential role of bully-\ning from an adaptive context. Our multivariate data are more\nmixed, as bullying was a significant predictor of having dated\nand number of dating partners in Study 2, but not Study 1.\nWe are therefore somewhat cautious regarding the data on\ndating and bullying, as the data are not entirely consistent\nacross studies, particularly at the multivariate level. There were\nsome interesting differences between the two studies that may\nlend some context to our results. The links we observed\nbetween age and dating/sexual activity in Study 1 were not\nsurprising given that only a minority of our sample had actually\nengaged in dating (46%), a prevalence rate that is consistent\nwith previous developmental research on adolescent dating\n(Connolly et al., 2013). Therefore, the young age of the parti-\ncipants in Study 1 made a positive correlation between age and\nsexual activity very likely and the strength of this relation\nlikely accounted for most of the variance in the multivariate\nanalyses. In contrast, the majority of participants in Study 2 had\nbegun dating (82%), making age a less salient variable for this\nsample. Age may also have played a role in the link between\nvictimization and number of dating partners as research has\nshown that early dating is in fact a risk factor for psychosocial\nwell-being (Zimmer-Gembeck et al., 2001). It may be that\nduring early adolescence, when dating is less normative, dating\nmultiple partners triggers retaliatory same-sex aggression from\npeers who view the high dating individual as a sexual compe-\ntitor worth targeting (Leenaars et al., 2008; Vaillancourt,\n2013). In their experimental study of undergraduate women,\nVaillancourt and Sharma (2011) found strong support for\nwomen's intolerance of female peers who were perceived to\nbe sexually available. Another possibility is that individuals\nwho have numerous dating partners at a young age are placing\nthemselves in low-quality relationships that open themselves\nup to victimization from their partner and/or hinder their own\npsychological development to a point where they become tar-\ngets for their peers (Connolly et al., 2000; Wekerle & Wolfe,\n1999). These views promotes a hypothesis of increased dating\nas the cause of victimization that is in contrast to, but can\ncoexist with, a hypothesis that bullying causes increased dat-\ning. The difference between these two outcomes may rest on\nindividual factors such as social dominance. For example, a\ndominant bully may be able to safely date frequently without\nbeing harassed while a subordinate peer might be victimized\n6 Evolutionary Psychology\nfor their attempts to date frequently. However, given the incon-\nsistency of the findings across the studies, we are cautious in\nfurther interpretations of these data.\nAttractiveness and likeability were more prominent predic-\ntors of dating and sexual behavior in Study 2, perhaps because\nof the importance of age as a predictor in our younger sample.\nLikeability was a significant univariate predictor in Study 2\nonly, and it was a significant multivariate predictor in neither.\nThis suggests that likeability's associative variance is\naccounted for by other factors. The results for attractiveness\nsuggest that it predicts having dated at a young age, but when\ndating may be more normative (i.e., at older ages in Study 2), it\ninstead predicts number of dating partners. Being male was\nsometimes related to dating, as it significantly predicted having\nstarted dating in Study 1 (but not Study 2) and number of\npartners in Study 2 (but not Study 1).\nThus, with regard to dating, our results somewhat agree with\npast theoretical predictions (Volk et al., 2012), as well as with\nthe data from Connolly et al. (2000), historical data (Volk et al.,\n2012), and accounts of general aggression and dating (Pelle-\ngrini & Long, 2003). Interestingly, our data also partly agree\nwith the data reported by Arnocky and Vaillancourt (2012) who\nreported no link between self-reported bullying and whether\none was currently dating or not. Our data suggest, at least at\nthe multivariate level, bullying may be a relatively good pre-\ndictor in some samples (older) but not others (younger). We\nbelieve this may be explained, in part, by the increased expe-\nrience with dating in our older sample, as well as the somewhat\nvariable potential definitions of dating. For example, dating\ncould be interpreted to mean holding hands between classes,\nor going for coffee, or other similarly low-intensity behavior.\nConversely, it could also mean living together, being in a long-\nterm relationship, or being engaged to marry. The range of\npotential interpretations of dating, combined with our mixed\nfindings and the mixed findings in the literature, suggest that\nresearchers need to be careful in explicitly measuring specific\ninterpretations of dating and that age (as a proxy for experience\nwith dating) needs to be considered. If our younger participants\nin Study 1 interpreted dating differently than our older partici-\npants in Study 2, or differently than did the participants in\nthis could account for the variability in the published data on\nbullying and dating, as might varying interpretations of bully-\ning and its effects (e.g., physical vs social bullying).\nBullying and Sexual Behavior\nAcross both studies, the univariate data revealed numerous\ncorrelations between bullying and sexual behavior. In both sets\nof logistic regressions, bullying was a statistically significant\npredictor of sexual behavior. The effect sizes suggest that bul-\nlying is a modest predictor of sexual behavior at the univariate\nlevel in both younger and older adolescents. Our data suggest\nthat bullying is associated with a 1.5\u00ad2x greater likelihood of\nhaving had sexual intercourse (see Table 3). Bullying was also\na small but statistically significant predictor of the number of\nsexual partners in both linear regressions (see Table 4). These\nfindings, in two separate samples, offer converging support for\nour prediction that bullying would be related to sexual oppor-\ntunities, independent of age, sex, self-reported attractiveness,\nvictimization, and likeability. They suggest that the act of bul-\nlying itself, or some intrinsic character of bullies beyond those\nmentioned above, predispose and/or facilitate bullies' access to\nsexual opportunities. In particular, it is noteworthy that victi-\nmization had few univariate links with sexual behavior and was\nnot a multivariate predictor in any of our regressions.\nThe link we observed between age and sexual activity in the\nlogistic regression for Study 1 was not surprising, given the\nsimilar age-experience trends as was witnessed by our dating\ndata. In Study 1, only 15% of the sample had experienced\nTable 3.

The absence of age as a significant\npredictor in Study 2 suggests that the only stable predictor of\nsexual behavior in our two studies was bullying. There were\npatterns related to age and attractiveness, but they did not hold\nconstant across both studies and/or regressions. This lends\nfairly reliable support to the unique importance of bullying as\na positive predictor of sexual behavior and for the hypothesis\nthat bullying may be (at least in part) a behavior designed to\nmeet evolutionarily adaptive goals. In light of previous\nresearch illustrating a common link between motives for status\nseeking and sexual behavior (Kelly et al., 2012), bullying beha-\nvior may be a means to achieve both of these goals. Given that\nadolescence is a period in which dating and sexual behavior\nemerge, bullying and victimization peak in frequency, and\nsocial status has a heightened importance, adolescence may\nbe a critical developmental context for studying and under-\nstanding bullying and victimization.\nLimitations\nAlthough we view our results as making an important contri-\nbution to the bullying and evolutionary literature, there are\nseveral potential limitations to our study. One limitation\nof this study is that self-report data were used, particularly\nfor bullying, which can be difficult to adequately define\n(e.g., Vaillancourt et al., 2008). However, previous studies\nhave shown that self-report adolescent data on bullying\ncan be valid (Pellegrini & Bartini, 2000) as can self-report\nadolescent data on sexual activity (Brener, Billy, & Grady,\nFurthermore, the bullying measure used in this study has\ndemonstrated good construct validity (Book et al., 2012).\nThus, while we cannot eliminate the possibility that our\nresults are due to biased self-reports, we do have a significant\ndegree of confidence in their external validity. One exception\nmay be for attractiveness, as self-reports of attractiveness are\nsomewhat less reliable, particularly for males (Kos\n\u00b4cin\n\u00b4ski,\n2011). Certainly there are numerous instances of construct\nvalidity among the variables in our two studies that supports\nthe more general validity of our self-report measures (see\nTables 1 and 2), with the possible exception of our dating\nmeasures (as noted earlier). In particular, the fact that sexual\nbehavior remained correlated across the two samples, despite\nwide differences in age and sexual experience, lends confi-\ndence to our findings.\nAlong with our good construct validity, and in accordance\nwith suggestions by Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, and Podsak-\noff (2003), our use of different response formats for different\nquestionnaires, counterbalancing questionnaire orders, and\nprotecting participant confidentiality reduce the likelihood of\nshared-method variation problems. Thus, while we cannot\ncompletely eliminate the possibilities of bias, social desirabil-\nity, or common method variance due to the cross-sectional,\nself-report nature of the data (Lindell & Whitney, 2001), we\nare reasonably confident in the reliability and validity of our\nmethods and measures.\nA further limitation is that we did not assess the quality of\nthe dating or sexual experiences. Thus we are unable to deter-\nmine whether the more frequent dating and/or sexual opportu-\nnities result in an overall increase in fitness either through\nproductive procreation or choosing quality mating partners.\nWe also lack data on how individual pubertal status relates to\nour results.\nand Bullying, Victimization, and Attractiveness.\nNumber of Dating Partners Number of Sexual Partners\nPredictor Study 1; Study 2 b* Study 1; Study 2 b*\n*p < .05. **p < .01.

The effects of bullying on sexual behavior appear to be\ngenerally independent of individual perceptions of attractive-\nness, likeability, age, and sex. We found several univariate and\nmultivariate links between bullying and dating as well (espe-\ncially among an older, more experienced sample), but the over-\nall picture for our dating data is less clear (as it is in the general\nliterature's data).\nTaken together, results from the present study offer mixed,\nbut generally positive, support for our hypothesis that bullying\nis an evolutionarily adaptive behavior. The links between bul-\nlying and dating/sexual outcomes are (for the most part) not\nsimply a function of common variance with attractiveness and\nage or sex, although those variables do play a role in dating and\nsexual behavior. We appreciate that neither dating nor general\nsexual behavior are direct indicators of increased genetic fit-\nness. But we argue that it is reasonable to assume that they are\nat least correlated with ancestral, if not actual, genetic fitness\n(Gangestad & Simpson, 2000). This is particularly true for\nsexual behavior, which also had the clearer link to bullying.\nAlthough our data provide support to an evolutionary\nhypothesis of bullying, much work remains to be done to\nfully explore the relation between bullying and dating and/\nor mating behavior. Measures of quality, duration, and part-\nner characteristics need to be collected, as do data regarding\nthe potential costs and drawbacks that may moderate the link\nbetween bullying and dating or mating. These data should\nideally be measured longitudinally. Bullying research may\nbenefit from adding sexual behavior as both a cause and\noutcome of bullying, victimization, and social status. Unra-\nvelling the developmental and causal relations between these\nthree factors may be of significant aid in understanding, and\nultimately preventing, bullying.\nIn the meantime, bullying research and interventions should\nbe increasingly cognizant of the fact that bullying may indeed\nbe, at least in part, due to evolved mental adaptations that\npredispose some individuals to harm others to obtain personal\ngoals (e.g., Garandeau, Lee, & Salmivalli, 2014). These goals\nmay go beyond social dominance and extend specifically\ntoward obtaining sexual partners. Sexual goals have largely\nbeen ignored in the bullying intervention literature (see Volk\net al., 2012 for a review). This makes their inclusion a priority\nfor interventions that attempt to alter the costs and/or benefits\nof bullying (e.g., KiVa, Garandeau et al., 2014). If bullying\ndoes indeed lead to an increase in sexual opportunities, it will\nno doubt be difficult to shift the behavioral patterns of\nadolescents who enjoy such an outcome. Nevertheless, there\nmay be more prosocial ways of obtaining sexual opportunities\nthat are as successful, if not more so, than the antisocial meth-\nods of bullying. For both short- and long-term partners, both\nsexes report honesty and kindness as being highly desirable\nattributes in a partner (Stewart, Stinnett, & Rosenfeld, 2000),\nwhile Hawley (2003) reported that prosocial strategies are\nmore popular than mixed prosocial/aggressive strategies. It\nmay be that by teaching adolescents more profitable prosocial\nstrategies, we can shift their behavior without altering their\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Social\nCommunity-University Research Alliances (CURA) Program.\nReferences\nAlan Guttmacher Institute.
