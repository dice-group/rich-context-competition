Vitamin C functions as\na reducing agent in hydroxylation reactions catalyzed by dopamine\nb-monooxygenase and peptidyl glycine a-amidating mono-\noxygenase (1). It plays an important role in increasing the content\nof endothelial cell tetrahydrobiopterin and thereby increasing the\nactivity of nitric oxide synthase (2). It is involved in the bio-\nsynthesis of carnitine, histamine, and several adrenal steroids; it\npromotes iron absorption and mobilization; and it functions in\ntyrosine, folate, and xenobiotic metabolism. When intake of vi-\ntamin C is below a critical amount (10 mg/d) for prolonged pe-\nriods, failure of wounds to heal, petechial hemorrhages, follicular\nhyperkeratosis, bleeding gums, and related abnormalities ensue in\na condition known as scurvy (3). Manifest scurvy has rarely been\nreported in the United States during the past 30 y (4). Latent\nscurvy characterized by fatigue, irritability, vague, dull aching\npains, and weight loss (5) may be underreported because it is not\nrecognized as such.\nAlthough epidemiologic evidence suggests that vitamin C\u00ad\nrich foods play a protective role against development of cancers\nof the mouth, larynx, esophagus, and stomach (6\u00ad8), intervention\nstudies that used supplements have not shown protective effects\n(9\u00ad11). Similarly, epidemiologic studies suggest a lower risk of\ncoronary heart disease associated with higher intakes of fruit,\nvegetables, and whole grains (12\u00ad14); however, prospective studies\nrelating cardiovascular disease with the intake of vitamin C or\nserum concentrations have provided mixed results (15, 16).\nStudies involving food or supplements or both have shown\nmixed results for the effects of vitamin C on oxidative damage to\nthe eye, hypothesized to be part of the pathogenesis of cataract\nand macular degeneration. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study\n(AREDS), a large randomized trial, showed no benefit of 500 mg\nvitamin C/d (together with vitamin E, b-carotene, and zinc) on\nthe development or progression of cataracts (17). However, two-\nthirds of the study participants were taking multivitamins con-\ntaining vitamin C; thus, a treatment effect may have been dif-\nficult to discern (18). A 5-y prospective study in Japan that\nincluded .700 cases of newly diagnosed cataract found that\nhigher vitamin C intake (dietary and supplemental) was asso-\nciated with reduced incidence of age-related cataracts (19).\nFewer studies have tested the ability of vitamin C to delay or\nretard the progression of macular degeneration. In the AREDS trial,\nthe antioxidant formulation (vitamins C and E and b-carotene)\n1 From the Division of Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environ-\nmental Health (RLS), the Division of Health Examination Statistics, Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics (MDC and DAL), and the Division of\nAdult and Community Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Preven-\ntion and Health Promotion (ESF), Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion, Atlanta, GA.\n2 Address correspondence to RL Schleicher, Centers for Disease Control\nrschleicher@cdc.gov.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nplus zinc delayed progression 5 y after the start of therapy (17);\nthus, an AREDS-type supplement is currently recommended for\npersons with certain stages of macular degeneration.\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nconducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention. It provides important in-\nformation about the consumption of selected nutrients by pro-\nviding nutritional biomarker measurements.

For most analyses, adults aged 20 y, excluding\nchildren and adolescents, were considered because younger\npersons tended to have better vitamin C status than adults.\nDesign and data collection\nLaboratory methods\nascorbic acid (oxidized and reduced) measured. Within 30 min\nof separation from the clot, one part serum was treated with 4\nparts of 6% metaphosphoric acid in the MEC. The stabilized\nserum samples were stored frozen, then shipped to the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta where they were\nstored at 270\u00b0C until tested. An isocratic reverse-phase HPLC\nmethod with electrochemical detection of ascorbic acid was\nfor NHANES III (25). The analytic method used for NHANES\nibrators were treated as samples in the assay, ie, subjected to the\nsame sample preparation steps. Similarly, an internal standard\nwas used in all sample preparations to correct results for re-\nboth survey periods, 3 levels of bench quality controls, and\n2 levels of blind quality controls, were incorporated into each\nassay. In addition, the laboratory participated in semiannual\nexercises sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology (NIST; Gaithersburg, MD) for quality assurance for\nvitamin C analysis (26).\nHistorical quality assurance data were compared to assess\ndifferences in serum vitamin C assay precision with the use of the\n2 assay methods. NHANES III bench quality control (QC) data\nhad CVs between 5% and 8%. Similarly, during NHANES\nlmol/L, had CVs from 5% to 9%.

For comparison with NHANES 2003\u00ad\n2004, NHANES III data were adjusted with the use of a Deming\nregression equation, where the adjusted values (y) = 1.0566\nVariables\nImportant correlates of vitamin C concentrations presented in\nthis study include sex, age, race-ethnicity, smoking status, adi-\nposity, socioeconomic status, vitamin C supplement use derived\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nfrom a home interview, and dietary intake. Smoking status and\nadiposity were measured; all other correlates were self-reported.\nSmoking status\nAn assessment of tobacco product exposure was based on the\nmeasurement of serum cotinine, the primary proximate metab-\nolite of nicotine (27, 28). Serum cotinine was measured with the\nuse of a liquid chromatography atmospheric-pressure chemical\nionization tandem mass spectrometry procedure (28). Previous\nstudies established that ,2% of self-reported tobacco users have\ndividuals with concentrations .10 ng/mL cutoff were classified\nas \"smokers\" and all others were considered \"nonsmokers.\"\nNHANES III, respectively.\nBody mass index\nAdiposity of adults 20 y was assessed with the use of body\nmass index (BMI; kg/m2). In both surveys, height and weight\nwere measured by trained interviewers with the use of stan-\ndardized protocols and calibrated equipment. Adults were\nclassified as being obese (BMI 30), overweight (BMI of 25\u00ad\nmales, as determined by a combination of self-report and urinary\nchorionic gonadotropin, were excluded from the BMI data\nanalysis. Results for underweight adults (BMI ,18.5) were not\npresented because the sample sizes were too small to produce\nstatistically reliable results.\nSocioeconomic status\nIncome status was defined with the use of the poverty-income\nratio (PIR), which is calculated by dividing family income by\na poverty threshold that is specific for family size. This measure\nof income has the advantage of being relatively stable over time,\nthus enabling comparisons of PIR groups between NHANES III\ndefined as PIR ,1, 1 to ,3, and 3, respectively. PIR values ,1\nare below the official poverty threshold, whereas PIR values of\n1 indicate income at or above the poverty level (30). Of the\ncontained information on PIR; of the 15,185 adults in NHANES\nVitamin C supplement use\npertaining to the use of nutritional supplements was obtained\n2004, the question posed was as follows: \"Have you used or\ntaken any vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements in the\npast 30 days? Include prescription and nonprescription supple-\nments.\" In NHANES III, during the household interview, re-\nspondents were asked \"Have you taken any vitamins or minerals\nduring the past month? Please include those that are prescribed\nby a doctor and those that are not prescribed.\" In both surveys\nthose who answered affirmatively were asked to show the in-\nterviewer the contents of all vitamin and mineral supplements.\nThe interviewer then recorded whether any vitamin C\u00adcontaining\nsupplements were present. More than 99% of respondents in-\ndicated yes or no to a question about vitamin-mineral supplement\nuse in each survey.\nDietary intake of vitamin C\nDaily intake of vitamin C less than the Estimated Average\nRequirement (EAR) was calculated for adults 20 y based on\ncurrent recommendations (31) with the use of a single 24-h\ndietary recall. For women, EAR values are 60 mg/d for non-\nsmokers and 95 mg/d for smokers; for men, EAR values are\n75 mg/d for nonsmokers and 110 mg/d for smokers. Pregnant\nand lactating women have specifically higher values, namely\n70 mg/d for pregnant nonsmokers, 105 mg/d for pregnant\nsmokers, 100 mg/d for lactating nonsmokers, and 135 mg/d for\nlactating smokers. Estimates of dietary intake of vitamin C were\nStatistical methods\nBecause the distribution of serum vitamin C data was highly\nskewed, a transformation was needed to approximate a Gaussian\ndistribution to construct CIs and to test statistical hypotheses (32,\n33). The square root transformation optimally improved the data\ndistribution. Estimates of the mean with the use of the square root\n95th percentiles; and percentage (and SE) of deficient persons\n(vitamin C , 11.4 lmol/L) are presented for persons aged 6 y\nand for persons aged 20 y. Sample weights, which account for\nunequal probability of selection and adjust for nonresponse and\nnoncoverage, were incorporated in estimating means, percen-\ntiles, percentages, and their standard errors to obtain unbiased\nestimates. Standard errors were estimated with the Taylor Series\nLinearization, a design-based approach (32).\nCIs were constructed for the mean vitamin C square root\ntransformed and the percentage of persons with vitamin C de-\nficiency. The CIs for mean vitamin C square root transformed were\nconstructed on the square root scale with Wald's method (34) and\nthen back-transformed. Because the percentage with vitamin C\n,11.4 lmol/L in most subgroups was relatively small, ranging\n31.3% for NHANES III, CIs for these percentages were con-\nstructed with the arc-sine transformation (32). NHANES III an-\nalytic guidelines (23) were used to assess the stability of the\npercentiles. Minimum sample size needed to present estimated\npercentiles are a function of the design effect that measures the\neffect of the complex sample design on the variance estimate and\nis defined as the ratio of the design-based variance to the variance\nof a simple random sample of the same size.\nMeans of vitamin C concentrations (square root transformed)\nand percentage of persons with vitamin C concentrations , 11.4\nlmol/L for those aged 6 y and those aged 20 y were age\nadjusted by the direct method with the use of the projected US\nCensus population estimates from the year 2000 (35). No dis-\ncernible bias in serum vitamin C was found because of non-\nresponse on the basis of age, sex, race-ethnicity, cotinine, BMI,\nvitamin C supplement use, or dietary intake of vitamin C in\neither survey period (data not shown).\nThe data are presented 1) by sex cross-classified by age\nsex cross-classified by race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nHispanic black, Mexican American), smoking status (smoker,\nnonsmoker), and BMI category (healthy weight, overweight,\nobese), socioeconomic status (low, medium, high), vitamin C\nsupplement use (any, none), and 1-d dietary intake of vitamin C\ncompared with the EAR (less than EAR or greater than or equal\ndetermine whether stratification was needed in the analysis of\nmean vitamin C and the percentage of persons with deficient\nconcentrations of vitamin C, we tested for the presence of\n2-factor interactions of sex with age group, race-ethnicity, smok-\ning status, BMI, income, vitamin C supplement use, and dietary\ninteractions between sex and age group for mean serum con-\ncentrations of vitamin C (P , 0.001) and percentage of persons\nwho were vitamin C deficient (P , 0.01). An interaction was\nalso observed between sex and race-ethnicity for mean con-\ncentrations of vitamin C (P = 0.046). No other 2-factor inter-\nactions were significant (P . 0.05).\nEquality of means or equality of percentages was tested\nunivariately at the a = 0.05 level with the Student's t statistic\n(33). The equality of .2 subgroups was tested simultaneously.\nIf the hypothesis that the means or percentages of all subgroups\nwere equal was rejected, pairwise tests were performed applying\nthe Bonferroni method (36) to control for multiple comparisons.\nTo test for linear and quadratic trends in age and income level,\nthe null hypothesis of no linear or quadratic trend was examined\nwith orthogonal contrast matrices (37). Rejection of this hy-\npothesis implied the existence of a linear or quadratic trend. To\ninvestigate the odds ratio for vitamin C deficiency in smokers\nand nonsmokers during 2 survey periods while controlling for\npossible confounding variables, a multiple logistic regression\nanalysis was performed. Odds ratios having a 95% CI not in-\ncluding unity were considered significant. We investigated the\nodds ratios of supplement users and nonusers in a similar\nmanner. The hypothesis that the odds ratio was equal to unity\nwas tested by testing the equivalent hypothesis that the log of the\nodds ratio was equal to 0.\nSAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN 10.0 (RTI,\nResearch Triangle Park, NC) were used to construct CIs for the\nmeans and percentages, to model odds ratios for vitamin C\ndeficiency among smokers and vitamin C supplement users\n(SUDAAN, PROC RLOGIST), and to test statistical hypotheses.\nUnless specified otherwise, data are presented as back-\ntransformed weighted square root transformed mean with 95%\nCI.

Since NHANES III, many com-\nmunities have banned smoking in public places and conse-\nquently reduced passive exposure to secondhand smoke (52).\nThus, it seems likely that a reduction in smoke exposure in\nsmokers and nonsmokers alike may account in part for the im-\nprovement in vitamin C concentrations in the population during\nThe relation between serum concentration of vitamin C and\nage in the US population is complex and nonlinear. This relation\nappears to be different from country to country, depending on\nsuch factors as the availability of fruit and vegetables, socio-\neconomic levels, and supplement usage (48, 54). Fruit and\nvegetable consumption among American adults remained rela-\ndaily fruit intake in persons 2 y of age remained the same from\nconsumption declined slightly from 3.4 to 3.2 servings/d during\nthe same period (56). Increased intake of vitamin C\u00adcontaining\nfoods was unlikely to have contributed to the reduced prevalence\nof vitamin C deficiency during the recent survey. Mean 1-d in-\ntakes of vitamin C from food in those aged 12 y ranged from\nmore than one-half the adults who had vitamin C measurements\navailable had a 1-d dietary intake less than the EAR, and those\nwith intake less than the EAR had serum concentrations of vi-\ntamin C that were approximately one-third lower than those with\nadequate dietary intake, and they were 5\u00ad10 times more likely to\nbe vitamin C deficient. It should be noted that the dietary intake\ndata were from a single 24-h dietary recall and thus may not\nprovide the best estimate of usual dietary intake.\nIn prosperous societies, supplement consumption has a sig-\nnificant effect on body stores and circulating concentrations of\nconsumption of supplements in the past month, and 35% of adults\nwere regular users of multivitamins (58). Usage rates in children\nwere similar but lower in adolescents. These recent data show\nincreased usage since the overall 40% usage reported during\nNHANES III (58) and are likely to explain in part the improved\nfor those indicating vitamin C supplement use during the pre-\nceding month, serum concentrations were 57\u00ad73% higher than in\nSerum vitamin C concentrations (in lmol/L) of adults 20 y for all race-ethnic groups in different categories of supplement use or dietary intake, stratified\nGroup\nlimits Percentile3\nVitamin C supplement use4\nMen\nWomen\nVitamin C dietary intake8\nMen\nWomen\n1 EAR, Estimated Average Requirement.\n2 Weighted square root transformed; age-adjusted with the direct method to the year 2000 US census population with the use of the age groups 20\u00ad39, 40\u00ad\n59, and 60 y (35); equality of means tested on a square root scale with Student's t statistic with 15 df.\n3 Calculated on the basis of raw data (weighted untransformed data); data not shown for categories based on 1-d estimate of dietary intake because of\noverestimation of probabilities in tails (31).\n4 Defined as having taken one or more vitamin C\u00adcontaining supplement during the previous 30 d.\n5 Significantly different from men who were nonusers and women who were users, P , 0.001 (Student's t statistic with 15 df).\n6 Significantly different from women who were nonusers, P , 0.001 (Student's t statistic with 15 df).\n7 Significantly different from men who were nonusers, P , 0.001 (Student's t statistic with 15 df).\n8 Based on a single 24-h recall interview; EAR is defined as the daily intake that is estimated to meet the requirement in one-half of apparently healthy\npersons in a life-stage or sex group (31).\n9 Significantly different from men with intake less than the EAR and women with intake greater than or equal to the EAR, P , 0.001 (Student's t statistic\n10 Significantly different from women with intake less than the EAR, P , 0.001 (Student's t statistic with 15 df).\n11 Significantly different from men with intake less than the EAR, P , 0.001 (Student's t statistic with 15 df).\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nnonusers. When the relation between age and vitamin C status\nwas examined in supplement users and nonusers, older persons\n(60 y) had better vitamin C status in part because of supple-\nment use. A frequency analysis of smoking by supplement usage\nin this population showed that those aged 60 y who did not use\nsupplements were more likely to be smokers than those who did\n(22% compared with 12%). Smoking accelerates vitamin C\nturnover and lowers serum concentrations. Although older\nwomen are more likely to consume fruit and vegetables than\ntheir younger counterparts, accounting for some of the im-\nprovement in the oldest age group, older men are not (59). Even\nso, a substantial minority (10%) of older men and women\nconsume far less vitamin C than the Recommended Dietary\nAllowance through dietary sources (59).\nThe consequences of vitamin C deficiency in adults range from\npetechial hemorrhages, follicular hyperkeratoses with unerupted\ncorkscrew hairs, anemia, bleeding gums, and loosened teeth to\nmore subtle changes in mood and affect which might become\napparent before the body is fully depleted. Mild but distinct\nfatigue and irritability in the absence of manifest scurvy but\nconsistent with latent scurvy were reported by 6 of 7 healthy\nyoung men subjected to a vitamin C depletion protocol (60).\nLatent scurvy is also characterized by nonspecific symptoms such\nas joint and muscle pain (3). A substantial percentage of adults\nare associated with low energy and weakness as a result of in-\nadequate intake of vitamin C. More than 20% of adults showed\nmarginal vitamin C status, placing them at risk of vitamin C\ndeficiency, similar to the 20\u00ad23% estimates in NHANES III (20).\nThe limitations of the study are several. For the survey\ncomparison, NHANES III data quality was not as good as\nSerum vitamin C deficiency (,11.4 lmol/L) of persons in different age or race-ethnic groups, stratified by sex, with upper (UL) and lower (LL) 95%\nGroup\nn Percentage LL UL n Percentage LL UL\nAge adjusted3\nMen\nWomen\n1 Confidence limits were constructed with the arc-sine transformation (32).

For this reason a more\nextensive analysis of the mean concentrations of vitamin C in\nvarious subgroups was not undertaken, but rather we limited our\ncomparison to prevalence of deficiency. To compare surveys it\nwas necessary to adjust the NHANES III data set to make it\nImprovements in the assay were made in the period between the 2\nsurveys. Consumable supplies were shown to contain materials\nthat measurably degrade vitamin C within a short period of time\n(,24 h) (61). It was suggested that this degradation may occur\nin autosampler vials, tubes, and vials used in the collection and\nprocessing of blood and serum samples and that this type of\ndegradation may account for a substantial amount of the ob-\nserved interlaboratory variation in NIST-sponsored exercises for\nvitamin C measurement. Two features of the assay used for\ndation and degradation, namely, use of an internal standard that\npartially compensated for procedural losses during the assay and\ncalibrators that were processed the same as samples such that\nboth were exposed to similar conditions during the processing\nand analysis steps. Overall, '3% of the difference in mean\nserum concentrations between survey periods can be explained\nby method bias. This amount of bias is considered clinically ac-\nceptable, considering other sources of error in measuring serum\nvitamin C such as analytic error (CVA\n= 5\u00ad9%), within-individual\nvariation for repeated measurements (CVI\n= 26%), and variation\nof the group or population for this analyte (CVG\nA complication in interpreting vitamin C serum and dietary\nintake data, ordinarily considered the sum of intake from fruit,\nvegetables, supplements, and fortified foods, is the availability of\nD-ascorbic acid, which is used as a preservative in prepared\nfoods. The HPLC method used in this analysis (and during\nNHANES III) does not distinguish between the D- and L-\nisomers, which probably do not share full biological activity (1).\nA significant amount of D-ascorbate is found in some prepared\nfoods, particularly cured meats where it is used to shorten\nprocessing time and improve the color.\nThe strengths of this study are numerous. These results are\nfrom a national survey to measure vitamin C with the use of\nSerum vitamin C deficiency (,11.4 lmol/L) of persons aged 20 y in different categories of smoking, BMI, or socioeconomic status, stratified by sex, with\nGroup\nn Percentage LL UL n Percentage LL UL\nMen\nWomen\nMen\nWomen\nSocioeconomic6\n1 Includes all race-ethnic categories; age-adjusted by the direct method to the year 2000 US census population estimates with the use of age groups 20\u00ad39,\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).\n3 Smoker is defined as having serum cotinine . 10 ng/mL; nonsmoker has cotinine 10 ng/mL.\n4 Significantly different from smokers in respective sex groups, P , 0.05 (Student's t statistic with 15 df).\n5 Rounded to the nearest 10th; pregnant women and adults with BMI (in kg/m2) ,18.5 were excluded.
