Given the increasing need for\nfamily caregivers and the vital importance of the health of the nursing workforce for the health of others, future research on\nhow double- and triple-duty caregivers maintain their health amidst constant caregiving should be a priority.\n",

According to the\nBureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), these health care employ-\nees are considered primary caregivers and provide basic\ncare for patients in hospitals and residents of long-term\ncare facilities, such as nursing homes. Given their engage-\nment in hands-on care and more frequent contact with\npatients than other nursing staff, CNAs are generally highly\nactive, balance heavy workloads, and perform physically\ndemanding tasks (Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS], 2014).\nConsequently, CNAs are at significant risk of on-the-job\ninjuries, with nonfatal injury and illness rates in the 98th\nLabor Statistics [BLS], 2014; Khatutsky, Wiener, Anderson,\n2022 to keep pace with accelerated population aging and\nthe need for long-term care (Bureau of Labor Statistics\n[BLS], 2014). The health care industry has thus been tasked\nwith meeting an increasing demand for services, coupled\nwith retaining and accommodating an aging workforce\nThe Gerontologist\nsusceptible to injury and illness (Harrington & Heidkamp,\nIn addition to challenging an under-resourced health\ncare system, rapid populating aging has led to a concur-\nrent, unprecedented need for family caregivers (Harrington\nsuggests that adults who combine paid, formal caregiving\nin the health care sector with unpaid, informal caregiving\nin their \"off\" time are increasingly prevalent in the health\ncare industry (Boumans & Dorant, 2014; DePasquale\noccupation of informal caregiving roles for dependent chil-\ndren (i.e., double-duty child caregiving) or adult relatives\n(i.e., double-duty elder caregiving) by practicing health care\nprofessionals is called double-duty caregiving whereas the\noccupation of informal caregiving roles for sandwiched\ncare recipients, or dependent children and adult relatives,\namong such professionals is considered triple-duty caregiv-\ning. Double- and triple-duty caregiving are relevant for the\nhealth care industry for complementary reasons. First, dou-\nble- and triple-duty caregiving are associated with a range\nof health-related problems, including extreme physical and\nemotional exhaustion, physical and mental fatigue, strain,\nstress, anxiety, and psychological distress (Boumans &\nRogers, 2006; Ward-Griffin, Brown, Vandervoort, McNair,\n& Dashnay, 2005). Double- and triple-duty caregivers also\nhave an increased risk of compassion fatigue, a condition\nspecific to caregiving that negatively affects well-being as a\nresult of direct, prolonged exposure, and over identification\nwith care recipients' suffering (Ward-Griffin, St-Amant, &\nBrown, 2011). Further, as double-duty elder caregivers pro-\nvide more hours of informal care they report a greater need\nto recuperate from work-related efforts and are more likely\nto exhibit presenteeism, or attend work while ill (Boumans\n& Dorant, 2014). Nurses' presenteeism is particularly\ntroubling given its link to more patient falls, medication\nerrors, and health care costs as well as lower quality of care\nSecond, double- and triple-duty caregivers' health and\nwork\u00adlife balance affects care recipients' well-being. For\ninstance, a previous study found that the likelihood of mak-\ning medication-related, charting, or transcription mistakes\nat work was more than doubled for hospital staff nurses\noccupying an informal elder care role (i.e., double-duty elder\ncaregivers) compared to nonfamily caregiving counterparts\n(Scott et al., 2006). The authors attributed poorer work per-\nformance to sleep deprivation, as double-duty elder caregiv-\ners also reported the shortest average sleep duration on work\ndays. Indeed, prior research indicates that sleep deprivation\namong nurses,a significant and prevalent occupational health\nissue in the nursing profession, adversely impacts health,\njudgment, and performance, leading to errors and accidents\nthat jeopardize patient safety (Surani, Murphy, & Shah,\n2007). Additionally, double- and triple-duty caregivers expe-\nrience more work\u00adfamily conflict than nonfamily caregiving\ncounterparts (Boumans & Dorant, 2014; DePasquale et al.,\n2014). Nurses' work\u00adfamily conflict is linked to lower job\nsatisfaction (Cortese, Colombo, & Ghislieri, 2010), greater\njob stress (Farhadi, Sharifian, Feili, & Shokrpour, 2013),\nemotional exhaustion (Leineweber et al., 2014), poorer psy-\nchological health (Rantanen et al., 2013), and physical pain\n(Kim et al., 2013). These same outcomes, in turn, are associ-\nated with poorer work performance (Wang & Tsai, 2014)\nand occupational mistakes (Pani & Chariker, 2004). Thus,\ndouble- and triple-duty caregivers' work\u00adfamily conflict may\nhinder their ability to provide quality care.\nCollectively, findings from prior double- and triple-duty\ncaregiving research demonstrate a need for health-promoting\nbehaviors among this population not only for the preserva-\ntion of their own health, but for care recipients' health as\nwell. To date, however, no studies have examined a critical\naspect of double- and triple-duty caregiver health--use of\nhealth care services.Therefore, the objective of this study was\nto conduct an exploratory investigation of health care utiliza-\ntion among CNAs working in nursing homes in the United\nStates, the majority of whom occupy double- and triple-duty\ncaregiving roles, by addressing the following questions:\n1. How do double- and triple-caregiving role occupancy,\ncompared to formal-only caregiving (i.e., CNAs with-\nout family caregiving obligations), relate to health care\nutilization?\n2. What factors are associated with CNAs' health care\nutilization?\n3. Are double-and triple-duty caregiving role occupancy\nuniquely associated with health care utilization beyond\nthe effects of other factors?\nTheoretical Framework\nGiven our proposed exploration of factors associated with\nCNAs' health care utilization, we draw on the Andersen\nand Newman (1973) Behavioral Model of Health Services\nUse to inform variable selection. The Andersen and\nNewman model views health care utilization as an indi-\nvidual behavior resulting from three sets of contextual\nfactors: (a) predisposing; factors that exist prior to illness\nonset, (b) enabling; the means by which health care ser-\nvices can be accessed when needed, and (c) need; perceived\nor clinician-evaluated health status and functioning. The\nAndersen and Newman model has previously been tested in\nfamily caregiving research to identify predictors of health\ncare utilization, but has never been applied to CNAs occu-\npying different family caregiving roles. Our study there-\nfore provides the first empirical test of the model with this\npopulation.\nDesign and Methods\nStudy Design\nThis study is part of a multidisciplinary research initiative\nby the Work, Family and Health Network (WFHN), an\norganization formed by the National Institutes of Health\n(NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC), to enhance understanding of the ways in which\nworkplace practices and policies affect work, family, and\nhealth outcomes among employees working in different\nResearch Site\nThe WFHN mailed letters to several large health care\ncompanies to recruit partners for research participation.\nPotential partners were asked a standard set of questions\nto ensure fulfillment of minimum requirements for study\nparticipation. These requirements included basic informa-\ntion about the company (e.g., number of employees work-\ning in the United States), its background (e.g., competing\ninitiatives), employees (e.g., demographics), and relation-\nship with management (e.g., willingness to participate). The\nWFHN ultimately became corporate partners with a long-\nterm health and specialized care company managing 56\nworksites in New England. With guidance from the com-\npany's Vice President of Development, the WFHN selected\n30 nursing home facilities for study participation. Inclusion\ncriteria for consideration included size (< 30 nursing staff),\nhow recently the site was acquired (if relevant), stable man-\nagement structure (i.e., minimal turnover), location in a\nnonisolated setting, and no other research participation.\nNone of the facilities declined participation and one facil-\nity was excluded for participation in competing initiatives.\nSample\nEligible employees worked at least 22.5\nhr per week in\ndirect care on day or evening shifts. Nightshift workers\nwere excluded given the logistical challenges of schedul-\ning in-person interviews as well as fundamental differences\nbetween day and nightshift workers (e.g.,nightshift employ-\nees work on skeleton crews while residents are sleeping).\nWork, Family and Health Study (WFHS), 1,025 of whom\nwere CNAs and comprise the focus of this study.\nProcedures\nTrained field interviewers administered computer-assisted\npersonal interviews at a private location in the workplace.\nEmployees provided information about sociodemograph-\nics, family relationships, work environment, health, and\nhealth behaviors. Interviews averaged 60min and employ-\nees received compensation for their time. Detailed informa-\ntion regarding the WFHS protocol is described elsewhere\nMeasures\nOutcomes\nHealth care utilization was operationalized as the number of\nacute care and other health care visits CNAs reported mak-\ning for personal reasons/themselves in the past 6 months.\nSpecifically, acute care pertained to emergency room or\nurgent care treatment facility visits for health treatment\ncare visits reflected the receipt of outpatient treatment or\ncounseling from health care professionals (range = 0\u00ad76,\nPredictors\nWe categorized CNAs into four mutually exclusive groups\nbased on family caregiving role occupancy (DePasquale\nof age or younger living with them for at least 4 days per\nweek. Double-duty elder caregivers provided care (i.e.,\nassistance with shopping, medical care, or financial/budget\nplanning) for at least 3\nhr per week in the past 6 months\nto an adult relative, regardless of residential proximity.\nTriple-duty caregivers were identified through endorsement\nof both child and adult care criteria. Formal-only caregiv-\ners did not indicate any family caregiving obligations and\nconstituted the reference group.\nTo test the Andersen and Newman model (1973), we\nidentified multiple indicators of predisposing, enabling, and\nneed factors that may affect CNAs' health care utilization.\nClassification of contextual factors was guided by the model\nand a review of its application in family caregiving stud-\nies (e.g., Bergman, Haley, & Small, 2011; Bookwala et al.,\nBuckwalter, & Reed, 2005; Toseland, McCallion, Gerber, &\nBanks, 2002). The model components and respective vari-\nables are summarized and presented in Table 1.\nPredisposing\nWe examined the following predisposing factors: age\n(in years), gender (0 = male, 1 = female), race/ethnicity\n(0 = non-Hispanic White, 1 = White), educational attain-\nment (0 = high school degree or less, 1 = some college or\nmore), marital status (0 = single, 1 = cohabiting or mar-\nried), and average number of hours worked per week.\nEnabling\nWe included the enabling factors of annual household\nincome and health insurance status, as both variables are\nconsidered caregiver resources in accessing health care ser-\nAnnual household income was measured on an ordinal\nmore). For health care insurance status, we created dichot-\nomous variables to represent CNAs ineligible for employer\nhealth insurance (reference group), eligible but not enrolled,\nor eligible and enrolled.\nNeed\nGiven that chronic health condition status is positively\nassociated with family caregivers' health care utilization\nself-reported clinical diagnoses of high blood pressure, can-\ncer, and diabetes under the \"ever been told\" question stem\n(0 = no, 1 = yes). We also examined indicators of psycho-\nlogical well-being, as previous studies have highlighted their\nimportance in predicting service utilization (Bergman et al.,\nassessed nonspecific psychological distress and psychologi-\ncal job demands (Williams, 2013). Psychological distress was\nmeasured with the Kessler-6 scale (Kessler et al., 2003) which\nincludes six items (e.g., \"How much of the time did you feel\nhopeless?\") pertaining to the past 30 days ( = 0.84); response\noptions ranged from none of the time (1) to all of the time (5).\nWe summed item responses to compute a composite distress\nscore; higher scores reflect greater distress. Karasek et al.'s\n(1998) Job Content Questionnaire measured psychological\njob demands ( = 0.59). CNAs rated their level of agreement\nwith three items (e.g., \"My job requires very fast work\") on\na 5-point scale (1 = strongly agree, 5 = strongly disagree). We\nreverse-coded all items so that higher scores reflect greater\njob demands and averaged responses. Additionally, we incor-\nporated work-related injuries in the past 6 months (0 = no,\n1 = yes), average sleep duration, body mass index (BMI), and\ncurrent smoker status (0 = no, 1 = yes), each of which may\nexacerbate or contribute to the development of health prob-\nlems. Further, because the severity of child health problems\nor disability is positively related to parents' health care uti-\nlization (Damiani, Rosenbaum, Swinton, & Russell, 2004),\nwe accounted for dependent children with developmental\ndisabilities, physical health problems, or long-term, serious\nmental health problems.\nAnalytic Strategy\nTo ensure a consistent sample across analyses, we excluded\nparticipants with missing data on any of the aforementioned\nmeasures (n = 141), thereby resulting in a final analytic sample\nof 884 CNAs. As commonly found in health care utilization\nliterature, acute care and other health care visits represented\nnon-negative integer count variables characterized by non-\nnormal distributions and overdispersion (i.e., skewed and\nclustered at zero). We therefore modeled our outcomes with\nnegative binomial regressions (Hilbe, 2007).We accounted for\nclustering of CNAs within nursing homes by obtaining robust\nstandard errors via the repeated statement (Huber-White cor-\nrection) in the PROC GENMOD procedure in SAS 9.4. We\nestimate two separate models per outcome. Model 1 addresses\nTable 1.

Model 2 addresses RQ2 and RQ3 by\nadding predisposing, enabling, and need predictors.We report\nincident rate ratios (IRR) for all models.\nResults\nDescriptive Analyses\nTable 1 presents sample characteristics by family caregiv-\ning role occupancy. ANOVA analyses indicate that family\ncaregiving role occupancy is related to age, gender, marital\nstatus, health insurance status, psychological distress and\njob demands, sleep duration, and smoker status. Specifically,\nthe formal-only caregiving group, on average, was older,\nincluded fewer females and cohabiting or married CNAs,\nand reported higher enrollment in employer health insur-\nance than the double-duty child and triple-duty caregiving\ngroups. Additionally, the formal-only caregiving group, on\naverage, reported longer sleep duration as well as included\nfewer smokers relative to the double-duty child caregiving\ngroup, and had lower psychological distress scores than the\ndouble-duty elder and triple-duty caregiving groups. The for-\nmal-only caregiving group also reported lower psychological\njob demands, on average, than each double- and triple-duty\ncaregiving group.\nFigure 1 provides a graphical depiction of the preva-\nlence of health care utilization among CNAs. Overall, 23%\nand 27% of CNAs made at least one acute care and other\nhealth care visit in the past 6 months, respectively. Formal-\nonly caregivers had the lowest prevalence of acute care\nutilization (19%) whereas triple-duty caregivers had the\nhighest (32%); this difference was statistically significant\n(p < .05). Further, the prevalence of other health care visits\nwas lowest among double-duty child caregivers (24%) and\nhighest for triple-duty caregivers (37%).\nMultivariate Analyses\nRQ1: Double- and Triple-Duty Caregiving\nIn Model 1, double-duty elder and triple-duty caregiv-\ning were associated with higher acute care visit rates than\nFormal-only caregiving (Table 2). Specifically, acute care visit\nrates were 2.12 and 2.40 times greater for double-duty elder\nand triple-duty caregivers, respectively. Double- and triple-\nduty caregiving roles did not predict other health care visits.\nRQ2: Contextual Factors\nAmong predisposing factors, only marital status was asso-\nciated with health care utilization, such that cohabiting or\nmarried CNAs had higher rates of other health care visits.\nWith regard to enabling factors, neither health insurance\nstatus nor income predicted health care utilization. Across\noutcomes, however, the need factors of self-reported cancer\ndiagnosis and psychological job demands predicted higher\nvisit rates. Further, the need factors of self-reported high\nblood pressure, psychological distress, work-related injury,\nand living with a disabled child were linked to higher rates\nof other health care visits.\nRQ3: Unique Relationships\nAlthough attenuated, the associations between double-duty\nelder and triple-duty caregiving and acute care visits per-\nsisted after adding predisposing, enabling, and need factors\nin Model 2. Double-duty elder and triple-duty caregivers\nhad 91% and 77% higher visit rates, respectively. Double-\nand triple-duty caregiving role occupancy remained nonsig-\nnificant predictors of other health care visits.\nDiscussion\nGreater understanding of work\u00adfamily pressures is a key\naction step for the health care sector as it reforms workplace\npractices to keep pace with population aging (Harrington\nple-duty caregiving constitute significant, yet overlooked,\nwork\u00adfamily pressures experienced by a growing num-\nber of health care workers. Although prior research has\nhighlighted the adverse effects of double- and triple-duty\ncaregiving (Boumans & Dorant, 2014; DePasquale et al.\nthat assess health care utilization among this population.\nThus, our study is the first to empirically test the Andersen\nand Newman (1973) model as a scientific framework for\nunderstanding the role of contextual factors in acute care\nand other health care visit rates among CNAs simultane-\nously occupying family caregiving roles.\nIn addressing RQ1, we found that double-duty elder and\ntriple-duty caregivers had higher rates of acute care utiliza-\ntion than formal-only caregivers; conversely, double- and\nFigure 1. Prevalence of acute care and other health care visits among\ncertified nursing assistants. Figure depicts the proportion of certified\nnursing assistants who made one or more acute care and other health-\ncare visits in the past six months overall and by family caregiving role\noccupancy. ANOVAs with Tukey post-hoc comparison tests were con-\nducted to identify differences across groups, with formal-only care as\nthe reference group. Statistically significant group differences denoted\ntriple-duty caregivers and formal-only caregivers had simi-\nlar rates of other health care visits. RQ2 aimed to iden-\ntify factors associated with CNAs' health care utilization.\nGuided by the Andersen and Newman (1973) model and\nits previous applications in family caregiving research, we\norganized factors that may affect CNAs' health care utiliza-\ntion into predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics.\nOverall, predisposing and enabling factors had few effects\non health care utilization. Instead, the need component rep-\nresented the only set of determining variables associated\nwith CNAs' acute care utilization and was most pertinent\nfor other health care visits. Although it has been suggested\nthat predisposing and enabling factors may be as impor-\ntant as need factors in predicting family caregivers' health\ncare utilization (Toseland et al., 2002), our findings are\ncongruent with a number of family caregiving studies that\ndemonstrate the significance of need variables (Bergman\nneed factors may be a more salient contextual factor for\nCNAs than family caregivers because of their professional\nstatus. That is, predisposing and enabling factors may not\nhave the same impact given CNAs' specialized health care\ntraining or expertise, knowledge of available health care\nservice options, familiarity in navigating the health care\nsystem, and health care connections (Ward-Griffin et al.,\n2005). Our results are also consistent with prior literature\nin that the significance of variables measuring contextual\nfactors generally differed depending on the type of health\ncare service under consideration (Toseland et al., 2002).\nWith regard to RQ3, double- and triple-duty caregiving\nrole occupancy were uniquely related to acute care utiliza-\ntion beyond the effects of contextual factors. One possible\nTable 2.

The overdispersion parameter (or alpha) for each model has a 95% confidence interval that does not include zero, indicating that\nthe negative binomial regression model is more appropriate than the Poisson. An estimate greater than zero suggests overdispersion. All continuous variables are\ncentered.\naWork-related injury is a dichotomous indicator referring to the past 6 months.\nbHealth insurance refers to employer health insurance.\nexplanation for our findings is that, despite the negative\nhealth effects of double-duty elder and triple-duty caregiv-\nneed for health care services among this population, provid-\ning informal care for older adults constitutes a barrier to\nmore routine health care utilization. A similar notion was\nproposed by Baumgarten et al. (1997) after finding that use\nof physician services was no greater for dementia caregivers\nthan noncaregivers even though caregivers had poorer over-\nall health. Baumgarten et al. hypothesized that commitment\nof time and energy to informal elder care prevented car-\negivers from addressing their own health concerns. Indeed,\nqualitative research suggests that health care professionals\ninformally caring for adult relatives are typically responsible\nfor a wide range of activities, such as providing hands-on\ncare, making care-related decisions, delegating tasks, over-\nseeing professional care, and advocating for care recipients\net al., 2005). These responsibilities, all of which are com-\npleted in addition to formal caregiving, detract from time\nand energy otherwise allotted to maintaining one's own\nhealth. Further, as care recipient needs grow more complex,\ndouble- and triple-duty caregivers' care provision likely\nintensifies. If double- and triple-duty caregivers forgo or\npostpone their own health needs to fulfill increasing infor-\nmal care demands, they may exacerbate preexisting illnesses\nor work-related injuries and amplify stress vulnerability.\nConsequently, critical need factors may prompt double-duty\nelder and triple-duty caregivers to seek health care services\nat a point in which acute care is necessary.\nTwo other explanations adapted from Baumgarten et al.\n(1997), selection bias and self-reliance, facilitate interpre-\ntation of results from this study. First, CNAs' health care\nutilization patterns may reflect selection forces. For exam-\nple, 27% of CNAs in the WFHS sample made at least\none other health care visit in the past 6 months whereas,\naccording to the 2012 National Health Interview Survey\n(NHIS), approximately 80% of individuals 18 years or\nolder made at least one visit in the past year (Blackwell,\nLucas, & Clarke, 2014). In addition to being relatively\nyounger than NHIS participants, CNAs in the WFHS are\nall employed. Employment implies that CNAs are capable\nof successfully adopting as well as maintaining a physically\nand psychologically demanding work role. Individuals\nwho frequently require health care services or are in poor\nhealth likely do not select into a formal caregiving occupa-\ntion; if they do, they may be more likely to exit the role.\nRelatedly, selection forces may be particularly applicable to\ndouble- and triple-duty caregivers in that they must be in\ngood health to balance multiple caregiving role occupancy\nand fulfill accompanying role demands. Second, formal\ncaregiving may enhance self-reliance and reduce perceived\nneed or desire for health care services. As health profes-\nsionals, CNAs may rely on their own training or expertise\nto address personal health concerns or engage in self-care\ntactics that would otherwise prompt lay persons to make\nnonemergency health care visits. The additional respon-\nsibilities associated with providing informal care to adult\nrelatives, however, may motivate double-duty elder and tri-\nple-duty caregiving CNAs to seek health care services when\nhealth problems are serious or exceed their abilities, two\nhealth scenarios that likely require acute care.\nMoreover, adult care recipients' unpredictable care needs\n(Hessel & Keck, 2009) and familial pressure (Ward-Griffin\net al., 2005) may affect health care utilization patterns. In\nanticipation of changes in adult relatives' health, CNAs may\nbe hesitant to ask for or make work accommodations to\nmanage their own health needs during the work day. Rather,\nthey may reserve these options for unexpected care recipi-\nent events to avoid exhausting safeguards and sacrificing\nearnings. Although speculative, this explanation implies\nthat double-duty elder and triple-duty caregivers resort to\nacute care for their own health purposes, are strategic in\ntheir use of workplace supports, and exhibit presenteeism.\nAdditionally, double-duty elder and triple-duty caregivers\nmay feel that they cannot plan or partake in routine health\ncare visits for themselves as others are relying on them to pri-\noritize informal care. Indeed, qualitative evidence indicates\nthat double-duty elder caregivers prioritize care recipients'\nneeds and place unrealistic expectations upon themselves\nto be a model family member (Giles & Hall, 2014; Ward-\ncare may represent a convenient health care service that per-\nmits double- and triple-duty caregivers more control amidst\nuncertainty arising from family caregiving roles.\nLimitations and Future Directions\nThis study has several limitations. First, the cross-sectional\ndesign precludes causal ordering and exploration of the\ndynamic qualities of the constructs examined. Second,\nhealth care utilization measures were based on subjec-\ntive, retrospective reports that may be subject to recall\nbias. Third, CNAs worked in health care facilities in New\nEngland, thereby limiting generalizability. Finally, we con-\nducted a secondary analysis of existing data not specifically\ndesigned to study caregiving. Though the data lacked ideal\ninformation regarding caregiving intensity, it enabled us to\nconstruct proxy measures of family caregiving role occu-\npancy consistent with prior research (DePasquale et al.,\n& Korunka, 2015). Still, it should be acknowledged that\nthis approach operationalizes child and adult care differ-\nently. Specifically, the child care measure does not assess\nactual care provision; instead, dependency is implied by\nage (i.e., under 18) and cohabitation. However, the aver-\nand triple-duty caregivers, respectively) supports the notion\nthat child care recipients in the WFHS sample were depend-\nent. Conversely, adult care specifies criteria for care pro-\nvision; this criteria is more stringent than the 1\nhr time\ncommitment required in prior double-duty care research\n(Gottlieb, Kelloway, & Martin-Matthews, 1996; Ward-\nGriffin, 2004). It should also be noted that, although we use\nthe term double-duty elder care, this measure may encom-\npass care for adult relatives other than aging parents, such\nas spouses or siblings in midlife. Nonetheless, a sample\ndrawn from a working population is advantageous in that\nit may be more representative of double- and triple-duty\ncaregivers than a sample selected for a certain threshold\nof care or care recipient illness (DePasquale et al., 2014;\nDePasquale et al., 2015). Additionally, although family car-\negiving experiences likely vary within the WFHS sample,\nthe employment role is constant. Thus, family caregiving\nrole occupancy distinguishes double- and triple-duty car-\negiving CNAs from formal-only caregivers.\nThe aforementioned limitations should not outweigh the\ncontributions and knowledge gained from this study. We\nbring attention to and advance understanding of a unique\nand understudied population. Traditionally, researchers\nhave studied formal and informal caregiving separately\ninstead of considering the implications of their intersection\n(Ward-Griffin et al., 2015). Understandably, then, previous\nstudies on double- and triple-duty caregiving comprise a\nsmall, limited body of research characterized by qualitative\nevidence, relatively small samples of registered nurses or\nhealth professionals working outside of the United States,\nand a sole focus on double-duty elder care (Boumans\ncontribute to this existing literature by focusing on a large\nCNA population working in nursing homes in the United\nStates, accounting for different informal caregiving roles,\nand providing novel empirical evidence regarding health\ncare utilization, an outcome not previously examined\namong double- and triple-duty caregivers. An additional\nstrength is our extension of the application of the Andersen\nThus, our investigation serves as an essential baseline\nand lays the groundwork for prospective explorations\nof health care utilization among double- and triple-duty\ncaregivers. It is important that our findings be viewed\nas an initial step toward identifying the prevalence and\npredisposing, enabling, and need correlates of health\ncare utilization among double- and triple-duty caregiv-\ners, and that they be replicated with more representa-\ntive samples, longitudinal research designs, and further\nexpansion of the Andersen and Newman (1973) model.\nFor instance, only one care recipient characteristic (i.e.,\nchild disability) was available when applying the model\nto WFHS data. Future studies employing the Andersen\nand Newman framework should integrate care recipi-\nents' predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics to\nexamine how each contributes to caregiver health care\nutilization. Similarly, integration of other subcomponents\nof individual determinants, such as attitudes or beliefs\nabout health care utilization, and inclusion of societal\ndeterminants (e.g., health system resources) may enhance\nthe model's explanatory power (Andersen & Newman,\n1973). Moreover, whereas this study simultaneously\nexamined contextual factors, longitudinal studies can\ntest the causal ordering of relationships hypothesized\nwithin the model (Andersen, 1995). In addition to model\nexpansions, prospective research assessing health behav-\nior engagement, self-care strategies, and other types of\nhealth care services is warranted. Further, because health\ncare utilization may be delayed until an urgent health\nproblem arises, data on the timing of and reasoning for\nhealth care visits will be particularly informative. As\nimportant, studies that acquire information regarding\ncaregiving intensity as well as health information about\nor from care recipients can be used to examine concord-\nance between care recipient events and caregiver health\ncare utilization. Qualitative studies in which double- and\ntriple-duty caregivers discuss perceived barriers, facilita-\ntors, and life or health events in relation to health care\nutilization may complement such efforts. Lastly, the\navailability, use, and relevance of workplace practices,\nprograms, and policies for double- and triple-duty car-\negivers' health care needs represent a pivotal direction\nfor future research.\nConclusion\nIndependent of predisposing, enabling, and need factors\nspecified in the Andersen and Newman (1973) framework,\ndouble-duty elder and triple-duty caregivers had higher\nacute care visit rates than formal-only caregivers. Given\nthat their welfare is critically important for the well-being\nof others, additional research on how double- and triple-\nduty caregivers maintain their health amidst the challenges\nof constant caregiving is necessary.\nFunding\nThis research was conducted as part of the Work, Family and Health\nNetwork (www.WorkFamilyHealthNetwork.org), which is funded\nby a cooperative agreement through the National Institutes of\nHealth and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Eunice\nKennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human\nOffice of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, and National\nAlfred P Sloan Foundation, and the Administration for Children and\nFamilies have provided additional funding.\n"
