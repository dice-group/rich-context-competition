To this end,\nmany social-cognitive theories of health behavior, such as\nthe Health Belief Model (Janz and Becker, 1984) or\nProtection Motivation Theory (Rogers, 1975), propose that\ncognitions motivate action. One such cognition, perceived\nrisk, is commonly measured as perceptions of susceptibility\nto illness. To reduce the perceived threat, greater risk per-\nceptions of a health threat (e.g. heart disease) are purported\nto predict stronger intentions to engage in a behavior (e.g.\nsmoking cessation) as well as the behavior itself. Meta-\nanalyses on the association of perceived risk with inten-\ntions and behavior suggest relatively small but reliable\neffects supporting the theoretical suppositions (Brewer\nSocial-cognitive models emphasize the deliberative and\nreflective processes underlying decision-making. However,\ndual-process models of decision-making suggest important\ndistinctions between this type of reasoning (i.e. the\nanalytical system) and processes that are experiential and\nreflexive (i.e. the experiential system), the latter of which\ncan be emotionally laden (Slovic etal., 2005). Thus, con-\nsideration of the feelings regarding risk are also important\nfor health decision-making (Loewenstein etal., 2001) and\nmay independently contribute to motivation and behavior\nchange (Slovic etal., 2004). While distinct systems, they\nwork together to influence decision-making (Slovic etal.,\n2005) suggesting cognitive and affective components of\nhealth behavior should be considered jointly.\nOne feeling associated with risk is worry--an anticipa-\ntory negative emotion experienced when thinking about\nfuture events (e.g. developing cancer in the future due to\nComparisons of health-related and\nappearance-related smoking risk\nperceptions and worry on motivation\nto quit\nRenee E Magnan\n Keywords\nappearance, motivation to quit, perceived risk, smoking, worry\nWashington State University Vancouver, USA\nCorresponding author:\nRenee E Magnan, Department of Psychology, Translational Addiction\nResearch Center, Washington State University Vancouver, 14204 NE\nEmail: renee.magnan@wsu.edu\nReport of empirical study\n2 Health Psychology Open \none's smoking; Loewenstein etal., 2001). In this way, it\ncan be conceived as \"thought colored by affect\" (McCaul\netal., 2007). Worry about health consequences has been\nassociated with motivation to quit smoking (Koblitz etal.,\nSchmiege etal., 2009), and health behaviors themselves\netal., 2007). Moreover, when considered in tandem, worry\noften shows effects over and above effects of perceived risk\non behavioral outcomes (Chapman and Coups, 2006; Ferrer\nAdditionally, perceived risk and worry are moderately\nrelated--while they share characteristics, they are distinct\nconstructs (Janssen et\n2003). It is possible to perceive an outcome as likely but not\nworry much about it (e.g. flu) or to perceive an outcome as\nunlikely but worry a great deal about it (e.g. breast\ncancer).\nBoth perceived risk and worry may have independent as\nwell as interactive effects on motivating health behaviors.\nThat is, they may work together in a way that results in bet-\nter or worse health decisions. Some investigations have\nfound a somewhat paradoxical effect such that among those\nwith high worry and high risk perceptions, motivation for\nhealth-promoting behaviors is lower. Such an effect has\nbeen observed for engaging in physical exercise and con-\nsuming fruits/vegetables (Ferrer etal., 2013), intentions to\nquit smoking (Klein etal., 2009), and greater avoidance of\npractitioner visits among older adults (Persoskie et\nal.,\n2014). However, others have found no evidence for an\ninteractive effect on the likelihood of six types of cancer\nscreening behaviors (Moser et\nPortnoy et\nal. (2014b) found the pattern of interactive\neffects on intentions to exercise among individuals with\nType II diabetes varied by how perceived risk was\nmeasured.\nThe operationalization of perceived risk may help to\nexplain the lack of consensus on the interactive effects of\nperceived risk and worry on health decisions. Most meas-\nures of perceived risk are \"absolute\" in that they ask an\nindividual to assess their personal risk. Personal risk can be\nfurther delineated as unconditional or conditional.\nUnconditional measures evaluate the probability of an\nevent without specifying one's future behavior (\"How\nlikely are you to get lung cancer?\"). Conditional measures\nevaluate the probability of an event depending on one's\nbehavior (\"How likely are you to get lung cancer if you\ncontinue to smoke?\"). Risk measures may also be compar-\native, evaluating the probability of an event relative to simi-\nlar others (\"Compared to other smokers your age, how\nlikely are you to get lung cancer?\"). These different meas-\nures may influence the apparent strength of the relationship\nbetween perceived risk and motivation for health behavior\n(Dillard et\nal., 2012). For example, conditional risk\nestimates may be stronger predictors of behavior than\nunconditional measures (Brewer etal., 2007; Janssen etal.,\ncomparative risk perceptions may be more strongly associ-\nated with worry than absolute risk (Lipkus etal., 2005;\nZajac etal., 2006). This variation in outcomes has led some\nto recommend the inclusion of both absolute and compara-\ntive assessments when measuring risk perceptions due to\ntheir distinct influence on intentions and behavior (Zajac\nAnother consideration of measurement of risk is that the\nfocus is typically on long-term health outcomes. However,\na small but growing body of the literature suggests that\nfocusing on other risks such as social (Halpern-Felsher\ncould also discourage smoking, particularly among youth\nand young adults. For example, Grogan etal. (2011) found\nthat female smokers exposed to a personalized visual aging\ntrial reported greater intentions to quit in comparison to\nthose in a standard care condition. Moreover, certain\nappearance consequences of smoking may even promote\ncontinued smoking (e.g. concerns about weight gain;\nPerkins etal., 1997). In contrast to long-term health conse-\nquences, appearance consequences have a relatively shorter\ntime to onset--they typically develop faster and thus may\nbe more salient. The argument that many smokers use to\nrationalize continued use (i.e. I'll quit before my smoking\nmakes me sick) may not hold when confronted with more\nimmediate appearance consequences of their behavior\n(Grogan etal., 2010). A small number of studies focus on\nthe potential for enhancing appearance-related smoking\nconsequences to motivate behavior change (see Flett etal.,\n2013 for review), but none of this work to date has assessed\nhow perceptions of appearance risks \"measure up\" to\nhealth-related measures of risk and the extent to which they\nare associated with motivation to quit smoking. From an\napplied perspective, understanding the conditions under\nwhich perceived risk and worry are associated with motiva-\ntion to quit could aid the development of more effective\nrisk communications, provide an alternative to reduce\nhabituation to well-known health messages, or identify\nvariables for developing interventions.\nThis study addresses the connections of perceived risk\nand worry with motivation to quit among smokers. This\nstudy is unique in that the relationship of perceived risk\nand worry on motivation to quit will be tested for both\nhealth and appearance consequences of smoking. The\nfirst aim is to test the independent and interactive effects\nof perceived risk and worry on motivation to quit. In\nkeeping with theoretical perspectives (e.g. Loewenstein\nDillard et\nsimilar patterns for health consequence and appearance\nconsequence measures such that (1) all perceived risk\nand worry items will be positively associated with\nmotivation to quit and (2) worry will be associated with\nmotivation after controlling for the effects of perceived\nrisk. Furthermore, (3) there will be perceived risk\u00d7worry\ninteractive effects on motivation to quit although the spe-\ncific pattern of the interaction is not identified given the\nvariation in outcomes of previous work (e.g. Klein etal.,\nrelative importance of perceived risk and worry of health\nversus appearance consequences in explaining motiva-\ntion to quit smoking using a relative weights analysis\n(RWA). I further expected that worry and, to a lesser\nextent, conditional perceived risk would be the most\nimportant contributors of motivation to quit. No a priori\nexpectations regarding the relative importance of health\nor appearance consequences were made.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe current investigation utilized data from a study regard-\ning reactions to different types of smoking-consequence\nmessages, but the data reported here were collected prior\nto randomization to condition. Participants were 121\nsmokers who reported smoking at least four cigarettes per\nday. They were recruited from the local metro via Craigslist\nadvertisements and flyers posted around the area. Four\nindividuals were dropped from analysis because they\nreported smoking fewer than four cigarettes a day at the\nbaseline session resulting in a final sample of 117 smokers.\nParticipants were paid US$80 for completing the 2-week\nstudy. All participants gave written informed consent\nbefore beginning, and this protocol was designated as\nexempt by the Washington State University Office of\nResearch Assurances.\nMeasures\nBackground information and smoking behavior.Demographic\ninformation included age, gender, race/ethnicity, and edu-\ncation. To assess smoking behavior, participants indicated\nhow many cigarettes they typically smoke each day and the\nage they began smoking. Nicotine dependence was assessed\nusing the Fagerstr\u00f6m Test of Nicotine Dependence-Revised\n(FTND-R; Heatherton et\nwas assessed with the Penn State Worry Questionnaire\nPerceived risk.Measures of perceived risk were adapted\nfrom work by McCaul et\nal.\n(2009). Perceived conditional risk of health consequences\nof smoking was assessed with four items asking partici-\npants to indicate how likely they are to develop some type\nof cancer or non-cancerous medical condition within their\nlifetime if they continue to smoke (e.g. \"What are the\nchances that you might develop some type of cancer within\nyour lifetime if you continue to smoke?\"). Similarly, per-\nceived conditional risk of appearance consequences of\nsmoking was assessed with two items (e.g. \"How likely do\nyou think you are to develop a smoking-related deteriora-\ntion of your physical appearance if you continue to\nsmoke?\"). Responses were made on a 7-point response\nscale (1=very low/not all likely; 7=very high), and items\nwere averaged to create scores for conditional health risk\n(\n=\n.92) and conditional appearance risk (=.94). Per-\nceived comparative risk of health consequences was\nassessed with four items (\"What do you think your chances\nare of developing some type of cancer in your lifetime\ncompared to other people your age who have smoked ciga-\nrettes?\"), and perceived comparative risk of appearance\nconsequences was assessed with two items (\"Compared to\nother people your age who have smoked cigarettes, how\nwould you rate your chances of developing smoking-\nrelated deterioration of your physical appearance?\").\nResponses were made on 7-point response scales (1=much\nsmaller than average chances/below average; much big-\nger than average chances/above average), and items were\naveraged to create scores for comparative health risk\n(=.93) and comparative appearance risk (=.91).\nWorry. Worry about developing a smoking-related medical\ncondition and deterioration of physical appearance were\nassessed with three items focusing on the amount and fre-\nquency of worry (adapted from Magnan etal., 2009): \"How\nmuch do you worry about developing a smoking-related\nmedical condition [deterioration of your physical appear-\nance]?\" and \"How much does thinking about a smoking-\nrelated medical condition [deterioration of your physical\nappearance] bother you?\" were answered on 7-point (1=not\nat all; 7=extremely) scales. \"How often do you worry about\ndeveloping a smoking-related medical condition [deteriora-\ntion of your physical appearance]?\" was answered on a\n7-point (1=never; 7=often) scale. Items were averaged to\ncreate a single score for worry about health consequences\n(\n=\n.85) and worry about appearance consequences\nMotivation to quit.Assessment of motivation to quit was\nadapted from work by McCaul etal. (2007). Participants\nindicated how motivated they were to quit smoking in the\nnext 30days and 6months (1=not at all; 7=extremely) and\ndesire to quit smoking in the next 30\ndays and 6\nmonths\n(1=no desire at all; 7=strong desire). Participants also\nindicated their plans to cut back on their smoking and to\nquit (1=I do not have plans to cut back/quit; 5=I am cur-\nrently cutting back/trying to quit). Scores were summed to\ncreate a single motivation score, =.92. Similar approaches\nto measurement of motivation have been associated with\nquitting intentions (Kozlowski et\nabout cigarette smoking (McCaul etal., 2007).\n4 Health Psychology Open \nAnalysis\nPrior to analysis, all continuous variables were checked for\nassumptions of normality. Associations of perceived risk,\nworry, motivation to quit, and behavior were tested using\nbivariate correlations. Then, a hierarchical linear regression\nwas used to examine the main and interactive relationships\nof conditional risk, comparative risk, and worry on motiva-\ntion to quit. Step 1 included sociodemographic characteris-\ntics (age, gender), trait worry, and average number of\ncigarettes per day; step 2 added conditional and compara-\ntive risk of smoking; step 3 added worry; and step 4 added\nmultiplicative interaction risk\n\u00d7\nworry terms. The set of\nvariables in the models were first standardized prior to\nentry. Because of the positive bivariate correlations among\nthese variables, two separate models were tested for health\nconsequences and appearance consequences.\nTo test the relative importance of the perceived risk and\nworry measures of health and appearance consequences, a\nRWA (Johnson, 2000) was conducted with the six primary\ncorrelates of motivation (conditional risk, comparative risk,\nand worry for health and appearance consequences) using\nRWA-Web (Tonidandel and LeBreton, 2015). This analysis\nis recommended when variables included in a model are\ncorrelated as a supplement to regression analyses in order\nto break down the predicted variance in the criterion--here\nmotivation. RWA transforms the set of variables to be\northogonal, and thus, uncorrelated with one another.\nUltimately, this analysis identifies which variables explain\nnon-trivial variance in motivation to quit by providing an\nestimate of the proportionate contribution of each variable\nto the variance accounted for by the complete set of varia-\nbles. The analysis uses 95\npercent confidence intervals\nbased on 10,000 replication bootstrapping around the esti-\nmates of the set of variables to determine if significant vari-\nance is accounted for in the criterion.\nResults\nThe final sample included 117 smokers. On average, the\nyears of age (standard deviation\n(SD)\n=\npercent female, and the\nmajority had completed at least some college (71.5%). The\nmajority were White (75.2%), followed by African\nAmerican/Black (8.5%), Hispanic/Latino (6.0%), bi- or\nmulti-racial (3.4%), Native American/Alaska Native\n(1.7%), Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (1.7%), and\n2.5percent could not be categorized. Table 1 presents char-\nacteristics of the sample by gender. Females reported\ngreater comparative appearance risk, health worry, appear-\nance worry, and trait worry than males.\nTable 2 presents bivariate correlations between all per-\nceived risk and worry measures with age, trait worry, aver-\nage daily cigarette use, and motivation to quit. Consistent\nwith the first hypothesis, conditional risk (r=.34 and .49),\n.39) about health and appearance consequences of smoking\nwere all significantly and positively associated with moti-\nvation to quit smoking. No risk or worry variables were\nassociated with daily cigarette use, and only worry about\nhealth consequences (r=.23) and cigarettes per day (r=.27)\nwere associated with age.\nTable 1. Sample characteristics by gender.\nBackground\nSmoking behavior\nPerceived risk\nWorry\nValues are means and standard deviations (SD) unless otherwise indicated. One person did not indicate their gender. Bolded values indicate signifi-\ncant gender differences at p<.05. \"d\" refers to Cohen's d.\nThe second hypothesis was that worry would be signifi-\ncantly associated with motivation to quit over and above the\neffects of perceived risk. In the model including perceived\nrisk and worry of health consequences (see top of Table 3),\nage, gender, trait worry, and cigarettes per day were entered\nin step 1. In step 2, greater conditional perceived risk of\nhealth consequences (but not comparative perceived risk)\nwas significantly associated with more motivation to quit\n(=.30). Importantly, and as predicted, greater worry about\nhealth consequences was significantly associated with moti-\nvation to quit after controlling for perceived risk (=.26). In\nthe model including perceived risk and worry of appearance\nconsequences (see bottom of Table 3), after controlling for\nthe same background variables in step 1, greater conditional\nperceived risk of appearance consequences (but not com-\nparative perceived risk) was significantly associated with\nmore motivation to quit (\n=\n.41). However, in contrast to\npredictions, worry about appearance consequences did not\nsignificantly add to the model.\nThe third hypothesis was that there would be significant\nworry\n\u00d7\nperceived risk interactions on motivation to quit,\nalthough the precise form of these interactions was not\nidentified. Unexpectedly, none of the interaction terms\nspecified in step 4 added significantly to the models using\nperceived risk and worry for health consequence or per-\nceived risk and worry for appearance consequence.\nTo address the secondary aim, I conducted an RWAanal-\nysis to determine the relative importance of perceived risk\nand worry framed as health or appearance consequences. A\nweighted combination of the six primary risk and worry\npercent of the variance in\nmotivation to quit. The relative weights (RW) indicated that\nconditional appearance risk (RW\n=\n=\n.08), appearance worry (RW\n=\n.04), and conditional\nhealth risk (RW\n=\n.04) each accounted for a significant\namount of variance in motivation to quit, whereas the com-\nparative risk variables did not. Table 4 presents the RW of\neach variable in the model. Perceived risk of appearance\nconsequences and worry about health consequences were\nthe most important variables in the model, accounting for\nvation to quit, respectively.\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this study was to test the main and interac-\ntive effects of perceived risk and worry about health and\nappearance consequences on motivation to quit smoking\nand to address their relative importance on motivation to\nquit. In keeping with prior work on perceived risk and\nworry of health consequences, all perceived risk (condi-\ntional and comparative) and worry measures were inde-\npendently associated with motivation to quit such that\nhigher perceived risk and worry were associated with\nmore motivation to quit smoking. Moreover, these asso-\nciations held when framed for health consequences of\nsmoking, as well as appearance consequences of smoking.\nThese results suggest that non-health-related perceived\nrisk and worry could be unique contributors to motivating\nhealth behavior change.\nSomewhat consistent with expectations, worry about\nhealth consequences was associated with motivation to quit\nover and above effects of perceived risk; however, worry\nabout appearance consequences was not. These findings\nrelated to the health outcomes of smoking are in keeping\nwith previous work and theoretical perspectives (e.g.\n2001) suggesting that feelings of health risk may be more\nimportant than cognitions of risk for some behaviors.\nHowever, this work has largely focused on cognitions and\nfeelings of health threats. The current outcomes suggest\nthat the relative importance of cognitions versus feelings\nfor motivation may depend on the \"threat\" one is consider-\ning. Specifically, perceived risk of appearance conse-\nquences made the largest contribution to motivation to quit,\nwhile worry of health consequences made the second\nTable 2. Bivariate relationships.\nBolded values indicate statistically significant correlations.\n6 Health Psychology Open \nlargest. In other words, these variables were the most\nimportant among the set of variables in the model.Although\nthe outcomes of the RWA differ slightly from the regression\noutcomes, this is not surprising given the different\napproaches to the analyses. The RWA identifies which vari-\nables explain non-trivial variance in motivation to quit (i.e.\nuncorrelated with other variables in the model). Thus, while\nboth conditional risk measures and worry measures account\nfor variance in motivation to quit (regardless of conse-\nquences for health or appearance), they may account for\nlittle unique incremental variance in the regressions\nDual-process theoretical perspectives suggest that\nwhether one relies on the analytical or experiential system\nfor decision-making may vary depending upon the context\n(Slovic etal., 2005). In this study, cognitions of appearance\nTable 3.

Rescaled relative weight represents each variable's percentage of the predicted criterion accounted for by the set of variables in the\nmodel (R2). Weights did not significantly differ by age (30years or younger vs over 30years).\nconsequences weighed more heavily on motivation than\nfeelings of appearance consequences, while feelings of\nhealth consequences weighed more heavily than cognitions\nof health consequences. The relationship of risk appraisals\non behavior may be moderated by the proximity of the\nhealth threat (Sheeran etal., 2014). Health consequences of\nsmoking are often perceived as being distal--occurring in\nthe distant future. Appearance consequences, in contrast,\nmay be more proximal--occurring in the near future.\nFurthermore, appearance consequences are visible, poten-\ntially making the negative effects of behavior (i.e. one's sus-\nceptibility) more salient. Health symptoms of smoking may\nnot be visible until the consequences become more severe.\nThis variation by proximity suggests differences in what\nmay influence thoughts about smoking consequences versus\nfeelings about smoking consequences. These outcomes add\nto evidence that different content may differentially influ-\nence perceptions of risk and worry (Portnoy etal., 2014a).\nThe current findings also provide additional support\nfor growing literature highlighting the potential impor-\ntance of appearance-related consequences on health\nbehaviors (Flett etal., 2013). The vast majority of work\nassessing the role of risk perceptions on health behavior,\nappropriately, focuses on health threats; but conse-\nquences of smoking are relevant to more than personal\nhealth--smoking has monetary, social, and appearance\nconsequences. To this end, these data provide some sup-\nport that investigators focusing exclusively on health\nconsequences of behavior could be missing an opportu-\nnity to motivate behavior change.\nIn contrast to expectations, there was no evidence of a\nperceived risk\n\u00d7\nworry interaction effect on motivation to\nquit, for either health or appearance consequences.\nHowever, this outcome is consistent with prior work on\ncancer screening behaviors (Moser etal., 2007). Interaction\neffects also did not vary as a function of the way perceived\nrisk was measured (i.e. conditional or comparative)--a\nfinding seen in prior work (Portnoy etal., 2014b). One\npossibility for these null findings is that this study focused\non motivation as an outcome, whereas other work has\nfocused on intentions (e.g. Portnoy et\nbehavior (Ferrer et al., 2013). As mentioned previously,\nmotivation is associated with both intentions and behavior,\nbut the interactive effect may differ for motivation versus\nbehavior. Additionally, each prior test of this interactive\nrelationship used slightly different construct measurement\n(e.g. single item versus multi-item risk or worry meas-\nures). This speaks to a larger issue of inconsistency of risk\nmeasurement in the literature (Brewer etal., 2007); how-\never, such a discussion is beyond the scope of this article.\nGiven the limited focus on the interactive relationship of\nperceived risk and worry on health decisions and behavior,\nthese outcomes emphasize the need for continued work\nestablishing the conditions under which and for whom\nsuch interactions occur.\nFindings of the current investigation should be con-\nsidered in light of several limitations. First, this was a\ncross-sectional investigation and causal conclusions\ncannot be made. Indeed, it is possible that the relation-\nship between perceived risk and worry and motivation is\nbi-directional. Those who are already motivated to quit\nmay have more and/or stronger thoughts and concerns\nabout smoking consequences. Second, risk measures\nmay have stronger associations with motivation when\nframed for specific \"threats\" (Brewer et\nAlthough a \"non-cancerous medical condition\" and\n\"smoking-related deterioration of physical appearance\"\nwere indicated, specific consequences within these\ndomains were not provided (e.g. wrinkles, yellowing\nteeth). The specific consequences one thought about in\nthese categories were left up to the responder's imagina-\ntion and thus it is not possible to determine which proxi-\nmal or distal threats were brought to mind. Finally, the\nsample is limited to a single geographic area, and the\nfindings may not generalize to other groups.\nDespite these limitations, the findings point to the\nimportance of taking into account the appearance conse-\nquences of smoking. All perceived risk and worry items\nfor health and appearance items were independently\nassociated with motivation to quit. Furthermore, the most\nimportant contributor of motivation to quit (i.e. perceived\nrisk or worry) may be dependent upon the behavioral\nconsequence under consideration. The current outcomes\nsuggest that in addition to health consequences, making\nappearance consequences more salient may be a worth-\nwhile focus for smoking cessation interventions.\n"
