This is a highly sensitive and contentious area \u00ad especially when it comes to\ndecision-making about serious medical treatments, which was one of the key areas\naddressed in our research. We examine the issues that arose as we attempted to anonymise\nthese data, and we provide empirical examples that invite readers to consider what choices\nthey would make if faced with similar issues. It is through this focus on practice that the\noriginal contribution of this article will be made. The aim is to complement the growing\ntheoretical literature on anonymisation (which often debates the issues at a mainly abstract\nlevel) and to be of practical use to other researchers encountering similar challenges.\nDefining anonymity\nIn much previous literature `anonymity'has commonly been used either interchangeably\nwith, or conflated with, `confidentiality' (e.g. Kaiser, 2009; Tolich, 2004). For us, `con-\nfidentiality' is a generic term that refers to all information that is kept hidden from eve-\nryone except the primary research team. Anonymity is one form of confidentiality \u00ad that\nof keeping participants' identities secret. However, confidentiality also includes keeping\nprivate what is said by the participants, something only achievable through researchers\nchoosing not to share parts of the data.\nAn idealised view of anonymity is that a person will never be traceable from the data\npresented about them. As we will show, however, guaranteeing complete anonymity to\nparticipants can be an `unachievable goal' in qualitative research (Van den Hoonaard,\n2003: 141). Some commentators argue that since the primary researchers know who\nparticipants are, true anonymity is by definition never achievable, i.e. there will always\nbe at least one person with access to participant information (Scott, 2005: 247). In most\ncontexts, however, in-depth qualitative research could not be carried out without breach-\ning anonymity so defined: researchers not only know participants' identities, but usually\nmeet them in person. For this reason we would argue that it rarely makes sense to define\n`anonymity'in the research context so broadly: the primary researchers will always be in\nthe know. In what follows we address the question of anonymity insofar as it applies to\npersons other than the primary researchers.\nAnonymising data: a balancing act\nThe process of anonymisation is a complex, and far from water-tight process, in which\nchanging people's names or disguising locations are only first steps in a more nuanced\nprocess around managing `identifying details'. Anonymity is a continuum (from fully\nanonymous to very nearly identifiable) (Scott, 2005: 249), along which researchers bal-\nance two competing priorities: maximising protection of participants' identities and\nmaintaining the value and integrity of the data.\nMany official ethics guidelines recommend disguising the personal identities of\nresearch participants as a default position \u00ad see, for example, the Statement of Ethical\nPractice for the British Sociological Association (BSA, 2002), and the Economic and\nSocial Research Council's Framework for Research Ethics (ESRC, 2012). This represents\nthe `normalisation'of anonymity (Tilley and Woodthorpe, 2011: 198). Others recommend\nrespecting the wishes of participants either for anonymity or to `receive recognition'\n(Canadian Sociological Association (CSA), 2012: s.13, Statement of Professional Ethics)\nand anthropologists, in particular, have long been concerned about informants'requests to\nbe properly credited (Cassell and Jacobs, 1987). The ethics of `anonymity by default' is\nchallenged by critics who champion the empowering effect that they claim can be fostered\nby participant identification (Giordano et al., 2007; Grinyer, 2002) and argue against\npaternalism and an exaggeration of the proposed `harm' that may result from lack of ano-\nnymity (Moore, 2012). Others highlight the negative effects that default anonymisation\ncan have on research outcomes (e.g. Walford, 2005: 2), arguing, for example, that keeping\nplaces and settings hidden `naturalizes the decoupling of events from historically and\ngeographically specific locations' (Nespor, 2000: 549), or that anonymisation can leave\nunderlying power structures unchallenged, preventing the pursuit of transformative\nThere are also practical challenges. Concealing identities can sometimes be virtually\nimpossible (Van den Hoonaard, 2003). Anyone closely tied to a particular research set-\nting will likely be able to recognise participants and places (Nespor, 2000; Scheper-\nHughes, 2000), what Tolich (2004) refers to as threats to `internal confidentiality'; and\nsince academics tend to use geographically convenient locations this makes research\nsites more easily traceable (Walford, 2005). However, commentators also point out that\nthe difficulties faced in anonymising do not justify its abandonment (Kelly, 2009), that\nmany research participants still wish their identities to be concealed (e.g. Corden and\nSainsbury, 2006) and that they often do not have a clear idea about how their words will\nbe used, such that the future harm from naming participants cannot always be reliably\nThe debate summarised above highlights the need for a contextually-contingent\napproach to anonymising data. Those writers who have defended the principle of ano-\nnymity as default do not necessarily equate this with `blanket'anonymisation, i.e. disguis-\ning every single identifying detail mentioned, which corresponds with the advice of most\nethics guidelines, e.g. Qualidata (the specialist ESRC qualitative data archiving service)\nand the British Sociological Association guidelines (BSA, 2002: 5). However, these bod-\nies give little advice about how to anonymise in practice; and with the exception of a few\ndetailed accounts of challenges in particular projects (e.g. Clark, 2006; Clough and\nConigrave, 2008; Kaiser, 2009), this gap is also evident in the broader academic literature\ndebating anonymisation issues. This article contributes toward filling this gap.\nResearch context and method: challenges for anonymisation\nOur research explored family experiences of having a relative in a prolonged disorder of\nconsciousness \u00ad either a vegetative state (VS) where the patient is diagnosed as having\nno awareness of self or environment, or a minimally conscious state (MCS) in which the\npatient has only minimal and intermittent awareness. The second and third authors are\nthe Principal Investigators (PIs) on the project. The first author is the Research Associate\nwhose responsibility it was to anonymise the transcripts and upload them into a data\nmanagement programme which was shared with a larger interdisciplinary research group\nacross two universities. The group's publications draw on our interview analysis to show\nhow families of severely brain injured individuals experience decision-making about\nserious medical treatments (Kitzinger J and Kitzinger C, 2013; Kitzinger C and Kitzinger\nJ, 2014), how they understand `consciousness' (Nettleton et al., 2014), construct `death'\nAnonymisation in this project was particularly important. Participants shared very sen-\nsitive and personal information, not only about themselves, but also about third parties.\nThe patients they are talking about are profoundly incapacitated, and our interviewees\nrevealed intimate details about their conditions and treatments. Many also discussed end-\nof-life decision-making in relation to their relative, and sometimes said things that they\nexplicitly stated they had never (and would never) voice to anyone else (e.g. that they\nwished their relative had died). With this in mind, we assured participants that we would\nendeavour to keep their identities hidden as far as we could through changing their names\nand the names of anyone else they mention (e.g. treating clinicians), as well as disguising\nplace names and particular identifying details. However, participants were also made\naware of the limits to the anonymity we could offer, as well as the challenges that can be\nposed to maintaining anonymity, as discussed throughout the rest of this article.\nAnonymisation in this project was particularly challenging. First, the two PIs who\ndesigned the research, recruited participants and conducted all the interviews (Jenny\nKitzinger and Celia Kitzinger) have `insider' status: their sister, Polly Kitzinger, was\nseverely brain injured in a car crash in 2009. As other researchers have noted, insider\nresearch is associated with a set of particular benefits and dilemmas (e.g. Breen, 2007;\nTaylor, 2011); it clearly helped with recruitment and increased participants' willingness\nto share their experiences, and to do so very openly, but it also posed challenges for ano-\nnymity. In some interviews, participants drew on shared `insider' knowledge about par-\nticular healthcare settings, and healthcare professionals. This makes their identities\npotentially traceable, since the identities of the PIs, and their brain-injured sister, is pub-\nlic knowledge (Kitzinger C and Kitzinger J, 2011). Second, there are relatively few\npatients in the UK with chronic disorders of consciousness. This `small population'prob-\nlem has been discussed in relation to ethnographic studies (Van den Hoonaard, 2003;\nWalford, 2005), which often focus on a particular village or town, where there is a high\nrisk that individuals may recognise themselves in the talk of others (e.g. Hopkins, 1993,\nor see problems encountered in relation to Carolyn Ellis' account of Fisher Folk (1986)\ndiscussed in Ellis, 1995). However, similar problems can arise with a geographically\ndispersed population with unusual characteristics. We recruited from across the UK but\nsome families had already met each other \u00ad or we learned that they had done so subse-\nquent to our interviews \u00ad in specialist rehabilitation settings (of which there are very few\nacross the UK), or through charities and support groups, including online forums. Most\nwere also in contact with the same small set of experts (e.g. experts in assessing con-\nsciousness or in related legal issues).\nThe insularity of our research context posed a threat to what Tolich (2004) terms\n`internal' confidentiality \u00ad raising the possibility of participants identifying themselves,\nor other members of their own family or from other families with whom they have had\ncontact. This possibility was increased by our use of `snowball sampling', including\ndeliberately pursuing interviews with different members of the same family \u00ad some of\nwhom did not want parts of what they said to be identifiable to other family members.\nThere was also a risk to anonymity in relation to what Tolich (2004) refers to as\n`external' confidentiality. Tolich's use of the term confidentiality relates to the `protec-\ntion against identification' (2004: 101), thus equating with our use of the term `anonym-\nity'. Our participants might be identified by some members of the intended audience for\nour research findings \u00ad which includes the leading medical, scientific and legal experts\nin the field. The small number of PVS/MCS patients means that an idiosyncratic detail\nsuch as a quoted vocalisation from a patient (e.g. calling out a particular word while\napparently in a vegetative state) could identify that patient and his/her family to the\nmedical or legal professionals involved. A reference to participation in scientific trials\nmight be similarly revealing \u00ad a pertinent issue as we deliberately sought to interview\nfamilies with experience of the novel neurotechnology, fMRI (see Samuel and Kitzinger\nJ, 2013). Likewise, we sought out interviews with those rare families involved in legal\ncases for withdrawal of artificial nutrition and hydration (Kitzinger C and Kitzinger J,\n2014), of which there have been fewer than 100 cases in total in England and Wales since\nA further complication is the issue of the `small world' (or `global village') estab-\nlished via the world wide web \u00ad in which what one might know within a family, com-\nmunity, service user or professional network becomes potentially available to anyone\nwith online access. Our capacity to ensure anonymity was compromised by the availabil-\nity of transcripts of court cases, coroners' reports and media coverage related to some\nfamilies, as well as participants' own use of social media to campaign (e.g. to raise funds\nIn the following sections we will discuss how we attempted to tackle the challenges\nthat arose and provide examples of what we did in relation to the following factors:\n1) People's names\n3) Religious or cultural background\n4) Occupation\n5) Family relationships\n6) Other potentially identifying information\nIn selecting illustrative examples of where anonymity was particularly problematic we\nhave to ensure that we do not breach the very anonymity we have tried to protect. The\nexamples presented in this article are all drawn from our already anonymised dataset.\nBecause we cannot (without breaching anonymity) compare what was actually said with\nour anonymised version of it, we have in some cases developed a second anonymised\nversion of the same data especially for this article.\nAnonymising: six key areas\nPeople's names\nThe most common form of anonymisation discussed in the literature (see, for instance,\nparticipants wanted us to use their own names and that of the patient. They felt that their\nrelative had been stripped of their identity/voice first by the brain injury and then by a sys-\ntem which ignored their prior expressed values and beliefs and silenced those attempting to\nrepresent them (similar passionate wishes to be identified have been reported by other\nresearchers, e.g. one mother saw the use of pseudonyms as a betrayal of her dead son's\nmemory: Grinyer, 2002: 3). Despite this, we reluctantly took the decision to avoid naming\ninterviewees wherever this could be negotiated \u00ad especially since at times there were also\nlegal issues (e.g. where a court required that the identity of a patient should be protected).\nNaming some participants might reveal the identities of people they talked about (Clark,\n2006) and might also compromise the anonymity of other interviewees (Kelly, 2009).\nIn choosing pseudonyms, we wanted to avoid revealing too much about the ethnic/\ncultural backgrounds of participants (see `Religious and cultural backgrounds' section,\nbelow), but we did select names that would at least in some way resonate with them\n(Grinyer, 2002: 3). Of course another option would have been to avoid pseudonyms\naltogether \u00ad especially given that other studies suggest that some participants may prefer\nsimply to be referred to by characteristics of gender and age-range (see Corden and\nSainsbury, 2006). This seemed to us, however, to be quite impersonal and also would\nmake it harder for readers to follow individual narratives. (For an account of why we\nopted for names rather than numbers, see Kitzinger J and Samuel, 2014: 6\u00ad7.)\nOn occasion, however, anonymising required us to prevent readers from recognis-\ning that two data extracts were spoken by the same person (e.g. when neither extract\non its own threatened anonymity but might in combination make identification possi-\nble). Then we sometimes did avoid using a pseudonym for one of the extracts or went\nfurther and created a smoke screen by attributing different pseudonyms to each extract.\n(For other examples of this smoke screen strategy, see Kaiser, 2009). This is clearly a\ncompromise in relation to the integrity of the data, and could mislead readers, but we\njudged it necessary when (for example) interviewees expressed concerns about endan-\ngering relationships with clinicians to whom they referred using derogatory nicknames\n(e.g. `Mr God Almighty') or when they described certain contentious activities such as\nsmuggling pets into the hospital, taking illegal recreational drugs into the care home,\nor reading their relative's medical notes when they were not entitled to do so.\nInterestingly some interviewees seemed quite fluent in strategies for anonymising \u00ad\nperhaps because some had become familiar with managing parallel identities on the\ninternet. For example, one woman suggested changing pseudonyms for her, as she\nreflected on some highly personal information about the impact of her husband's brain\ninjury on her own life:\nThe thing is me and John [husband] had quite a \u00ad obviously if you use this part I would change\nthe [pseudonymous] names [our emphasis] \u00ad we had a very dominating relationship [...] I was\nvery overpowered by John. And I had no say in anything I did [...]. The music I listened to, the\nTV shows I watched, everything was very controlled. [...] Even walking to the bus stop you\nknow, [he'd say] `I'm coming with you', but I knew it was just to check I wasn't running off\nwith somebody else. It was very, very restrictive. [...] He wasn't violent towards me, but he'd\nbe the kind that would throw a wardrobe next to me.\nThis interviewee had fought tirelessly against some clinicians' suggestions that further\nlife-sustaining treatment for her husband might be futile, and she had found her own\nvoice in the process.\nExtract 1 (continued)\nI have to say I found liberation through John's tragedy. And whilst I've been very careful who I\nsay that to, it's the truth. You know, through what's happened to him I've found myself. [...] So\nit's been empowering in his disempowerment. And it's really horrible to say that, but it's true.\nGiven the sensitive nature of these comments we followed the interviewee's own sugges-\ntions, using a pseudonym for this extract which is different from the pseudonym used for\nother quotes from her. In addition, we edited out specific identifying details (e.g. that she\nhas now joined a dance class, something which her husband had previously forbidden [a\nfictionalised example]).\nIn other cases, it was interviewer, rather than interviewee, who initiated discussion of\nthe option of omitting a pseudonym or using multiple pseudonyms. For example, after\none mother described an occasion when she thought about killing her severely brain\ninjured son (not, in fact, an unusual experience for our interviewees, see Kitzinger J and\nI thought `if I loved him as much as I say I do, I would not permit this [suffering]'. [...] And I\nstood there looking at him [...] thinking `I could do this. I could. I know exactly what to do. All\nI've got to do is put my thumb over his trachy [tracheostomy, pipe into his throat] and his pillow\nover his face. It'd be done in five minutes.'\nAt the end of this interview, the researcher suggested it might be appropriate to take\nextra precautions to ensure that this episode was anonymised, and the interviewee agreed\n(`I don't think I've actually \u00ad well [two family members] know about that, but I haven't\ntold anybody else'). Although she wanted her anonymity protected, this interviewee\nactively wanted to have this part of her interview used:\n... to illustrate the point that if there is not a safe option [to allow a dignified death] then people\n\u00ad when they're overwhelmed with tiredness, grief, desperation and hopelessness \u00ad will put the\nboundaries aside just to do something to ease an unbearable situation.\nAs well as `ring-fencing' particularly sensitive extracts, using two pseudonyms for the\nsame person also enabled us to include some potentially identifiable aspect of a narrative\nin some circumstances. For example, in an article focusing on participants' engagement\nwith the law (Halliday et al., 2014), we included data from two families in which the\npatient had been killed by another member of the family (both involving subsequent\nlegal proceedings that received media coverage). In this one article we used pseudonyms\ndifferent from those used in our other publications to reduce the likelihood that any iden-\ntification made possible by our use of these particular extracts would compromise the\nanonymity of extracts from the same individual used in other articles.\nPlaces\nOur assignment of `place' pseudonyms followed the same principles outlined above,\nand we commonly replaced identifying places with numbers (e.g. `Hospital 1',\n`Hospital 2') or generalised descriptions (e.g. `Southampton' became `South Eastern\nEnglish city'). Such anonymisation represents yet another compromise to the integ-\nrity of the data as anonymising places can result in decontextualisation, limiting the\nscope for analysis (Baez, 2002; Nespor, 2000). However, the small number of health-\ncare institutions specialising in treating serious brain injury means that naming these,\nor even the town/city in which they are located, could lead to the identification of\nparticular families, as well as the clinicians who worked with them. We did, however,\nensure that settings were not entirely decontextualised by differentiating between\nEngland/Wales and the Republic of Ireland, for instance (and between countries\ninside and outside the EU), since these distinctions might be relevant due to transna-\ntional variations in legal framework and healthcare policies. A reference to a patient's\ninjury having occurred while skiing in Bulgaria, for example, may be replaced with\n`sporting accident' in `Overseas, EU country no.1', and so forth. For our own analytic\npurposes, we also kept track of every individual care setting mentioned to inform a\nforthcoming publication about how people talk about particular settings, such as a\nmodern neurorehabilitation unit or the Victorian hospital building, thereby addressing\nsome of Nespor's (2000: 549) concerns about the `decoupling of events from histori-\ncally and geographically specific locations'. For this particular publication exploring\ntalk about settings, we plan to cross-link locations but to remove or change pseudo-\nnyms, allowing a discussion of `place' without revealing which of our interviewees\nwas linked to which location.\nReligious and cultural backgrounds\nReferences to interviewees' religious, cultural or ethnic background could result in\n`deductive disclosure' (Kaiser, 2009: 1632) compromising anonymity. Following the\nadvice of ethical guidelines, such as those offered by Qualidata (UK Data Service, 2013),\nwe often replaced religion/culture with similar but unrelated items, or with generalised\ndescriptions (e.g. Jaspal's Hinduism became `Jaspal's religious faith').\nThis strategy became problematic when religion, culture or ethnic identity was not\nsimply `background information' but crucial `context for deeper and fuller understand-\ning' (Clark, 2006: 6). After lengthy discussion we decided to retain certain features in\nsome cases. For example George's brother, David, had been injured six years prior to\nthe interview, and at the time was diagnosed by medical professionals as having `low\nawareness'. George and his wife, Linda, (interviewed together) were very optimistic\nabout David's situation. Their religion underpinned their shared views about David's\nfuture, along with a strong sense of family togetherness that they associated with their\ncultural heritage (from outside the UK). They consistently represented these factors as\nunderpinning their belief in David's ongoing recovery, as illustrated in the following\nextract:\nInterviewer: You have very strong family values. That comes through.\nGeorge: Yeah.\nLinda: Mm.\nInt: Do you have religious beliefs as well?\nGeorge: Oh yeah, we're [specified faith].\nLinda: Yes, yes.\nGeorge: My [relative's] a [religious leader]. So, yeah.\nInt: And does this influence your approach, do you think?\nLinda:\nAh, saying about the [place of worship] now. We take\nDavid to the [place of worship] as well. And the first day we\ntook David to [place of worship] [...] I gave him the\n\ncandle, David, and he went like this [miming clenching hand around\ncandle] [...] The other time when we lit a candle and gave it to him,\nhe was holding it like that. And he was holding it for a while and then\nhe would go like that [miming hand going lax].\nAlthough it was the interviewer who initially raised the topic of religious faith, the joint\nnarrative that George and Linda subsequently constructed clearly indicates the impor-\ntance of religion in their lives and they went on to explain at length how David interacted\nwith other artefacts crucial to their religion and how this informed their belief that David\nhad more understanding than the doctors had predicted. They saw David's actions as\nclear evidence that he was able to recall the significance of religious objects, and thereby\nto connect with the beliefs he held prior to his accident \u00ad such that an important part of\nhis identity had survived the devastating brain injury.\nIn partially anonymising this example by removing reference to any specific religion\n(although even `candles' are only relevant in some religions and not others) we tried to\ndo justice to the story that George and Linda were telling without being too specific. We\nsuspected that, so strong were their religious and cultural values, George and Linda\nwould not have been comfortable if we had represented them as belonging to a different\nreligious faith or culture. We compromised through cutting references which would nar-\nrow down identification of their religion/cultural background too tightly \u00ad this involved\nlosing some very interesting data but seemed a reasonable compromise, albeit one which\nmade the quotations much more anodyne than they had been in the original form. The\nquestion we ask ourselves here is whether we have veered too far, and `white-washed'\nthe data, `forfeiting much of the richness yielded by the study' (Parry and Mauthner,\nOccupation\nLike religious and cultural beliefs, occupation too could be highly salient to our interview-\nees and therefore difficult to simply remove or alter. Where possible we again followed the\nadvice of ethical guidelines, such as those offered by Qualidata, by substituting general\nterms, e.g. Jaspal's job as a theatre director became `job in the Arts'. However, sometimes\nsuch vagueness was incompatible with conveying key parts of a story. For example, Sandra,\nwhose daughter has been in PVS for many years, describes the `tipping point' for her,\nwhich triggered a discussion about how her daughter might be allowed to die:\nI'm a beauty therapist by trade so I looked after her hands and toenails. And on this occasion\none of the nursing staff [...], decided her nails were a bit long and had cut them and in one case\nhad gone across the quick and it had bled. And it had really upset me because I know how much\nthat hurts. And anyway, [X] came in and she said `You look really rough'. And I said `You\nknow, there are times, [X], when I just wish she would go to sleep and never wake up'. And she\nsaid `Well if that's what you truly, truly want, it can be achieved'. And I sort of looked at her\nand said `Oh yes? And how?'And she said `Seriously. There is a process.' [...] So after she'd\ngone, I actually sat down and thought about it, consulted with my [other family members] who\nbasically said `Oh, thank god!'\nSandra isolates a precise moment which, for her, encapsulated her daughter's suffering\nand her own inability to protect her; it is through the lens of her professional experience\nthat this moment gains its significance. Anonymising Sandra's occupation would under-\nmine her description of this important moment, and therefore risk not fully representing\nSandra's experiences.\nFamily relationships\nThe familial relationship between the interviewee and the severely brain injured patient\nis usually highly significant for the interviewee (e.g. `As his mother I know ...' or\n`Speaking as her husband ...'). Wherever possible we retained the family relationship in\nour published accounts \u00ad but we sometimes felt it necessary to disguise them. We have,\nfor example, usually not identified gay relationships as such and we have subsumed\ncategories such as `step-parent' or `adopted child' under the category `parent/child' to\navoid identification. We recognise the problems associated with this. In particular, the\nattempt to achieve anonymity structurally predisposes researchers toward the erasure of\nthe experiences of minorities \u00ad precisely because their minority status may make these\nresearch participants easy to identify as, for example, the only known lesbian with breast\ncancer in a medical practice (Kaiser, 2009) or one of very few black faculty members\n(Baez, 2002). The result is a one-dimensional view which obscures family diversity.\nWith regret, we pursued this strategy nonetheless, except when the particular nature of\nthe minority relationship was essential to our analysis (e.g. if an interviewee compared\nbeing in the role of `step-parent' versus `his \"real\" mother', or an interviewee com-\nmented on discrimination encountered as a gay partner).\nWhen publishing extracts that reveal potentially identifying minority or atypical rela-\ntionships we have made sure that such extracts are presented in isolation from other data\nfrom the same person and/or discussed with interviewees the issues involved and arrived\nat a negotiated decision about how to use the data. One such example comes from the\ninterview with Louisa, whose two teenage sons, Nicholas and Dylan, were involved in\nan accident which left Dylan with relatively minor injuries, but Nicholas in a vegetative\nstate. The anonymisation challenge here centred on the fact that Louisa's sons were iden-\ntical twins. The likelihood of there being more than one mother in the UK with identical\ntwins, one in PVS, is small. We initially decided that it would be easy enough to substi-\ntute any reference to `twin' with `brother'. This proved problematic, however, when\nfaced with extracts such as the following:\nInterviewer:Did you have a sense of where was Nicholas'soul or spirit ... through\nall this?\nLouisa: Yes. I think I know where it is.\nInt: Where?\nLouisa:\nThat photograph is absolutely Nicholas [pointing to photograph of\nNicholas before his accident]. And I think Nicholas' soul is settled\nwith his brother. I've got a photograph on my iPad where Dylan\nlooks like the 23-year-old version of that. Now I mean you would\nthink `Well of course he would, you silly woman! They're identical\ntwins!'. But I could always tell who was who because of the way\nthey held their faces. Because Dylan's view of the world was differ-\nent to Nicholas', so they always had slightly different expressions\n... And that became more apparent as they grew up. But this picture\nthat I've got of Dylan the day he graduated, he looks like his bro.\nAnd I can't help thinking that because they were identical twins\n[...]. I just wonder if Nicholas is now just living out his destiny\nthrough his brother's life. [...] So I suspect that maybe that spirit\nthat split in the early part of [date of accident] has now merged\nagain. I hope so. I hope so.\nAs with Extracts 2\u00ad4, this part of the interview gives important insights into how an inter-\nviewee thinks about life\u00addeath issues in relation to a severely brain injured relative. It could\nnot have been included in our analysis if we had not retained `twins'. Towards the end of\nthe interview, the interviewer asked Louisa for her input on our anonymising strategy:\nI'm not really too worried about whether people hook up on the fact that it's us or not [...]\nThere aren't too many families who [have these unique traits] so frankly, if anybody's remotely\ninterested, they'll realise it was the Herwell family. [...] Just take your normal steps [to\nanonymise the interview], but don't worry.\nThis kind of researcher\u00adparticipant collaboration on an individualised basis has been\nbut none have raised the possibility of discussing these issues during the interview itself,\nas was done here \u00ad this strategy does, however, rely on the interviewer to recognise chal-\nlenges to anonymity as the interview progresses.\nOther potentially identifying issues\nOver and above name, place, occupation and religion there are often features in any\ndataset, which may provide unique (or closely narrowing) identifying information. We\nhave given examples of a range of such features throughout the discussion above \u00ad\nincluding idiosyncratic details of a case. Depending on the substantive focus of the\nresearch there may also be a recurring issue that needs special attention. In our case\nthis was the nature of the original injury. Such information was often interwoven\nthroughout accounts and also has prognostic significance. Brain damage resulting\nfrom `non-traumatic' injury (e.g. from oxygen deprivation following cardiac arrest) is\nmore predictably devastating that that resulting from traumatic brain injury (e.g. from\na blow to the head). Distinguishing between these types of injury is therefore analyti-\ncally important. However, beyond this we commonly used generic phrases such as\n`road traffic accident' or `sporting injury', which allowed us to describe a range of\nevents while not revealing more specific information.\nSo far, so straightforward. However, sometimes the cause of the injury had a greater\nsignificance to the interviewee and was infused throughout the account. For instance,\nprecipitating events, such as domestic violence or a cardiac arrest brought on by anorexia\ncould be hard to simply evacuate from an interviewee's story. There may be times that\nunpicking such elements in the narrative would be core to the analysis, and therefore jus-\ntifiably retained in published reports, as long as the participant was assured of being kept\nanonymous as far as this is possible. Suppose, for example, that an interviewee told us that\nit was horrific to consider withdrawing artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH) from her\nPVS daughter because that daughter had suffered from anorexia and the whole relation-\nship between mother and daughter was embedded in this very fraught relationship with\nfood. Further suppose that this case had come to court, and a transcript was available on\nthe internet referring to the daughter's anorexia. This is sufficiently unusual (in fact there\nis no such case!) that it would identify not only the mother and daughter but also other\nmembers of the family and any health professionals mentioned in the interview. In\nanonymising this interview we might perhaps change the daughter's illness from anorexia\nto oesophageal cancer \u00ad another illness (albeit physical rather than psychological) causing\nproblems in eating which might therefore similarly affect how the mother felt about ANH\nwithdrawal. If we think that disguise may be too transparent, the daughter may become a\nson, and/or the mother transformed into a sister, and we would use different pseudonyms\nfor different extracts to minimise the chance of jigsaw identification.\nConclusion\nWe have shown that anonymising is not, in practice, something that can be done on auto-\nmatic pilot with a `one size fits all' or `find and replace' approach, and have highlighted\nsome of the challenges we faced in one particular dataset. For us, anonymising has been\nan ongoing working compromise: at times we have sacrificed some of the integrity of the\ndata in order to maximise anonymity and at other times we may have risked compromis-\ning anonymity in order to maintain the integrity of the data. The process of anonymising\ntranscripts has involved multiple meetings and lengthy email exchanges between the\nthree authors of this paper: it has been very much a team effort, with not all of us agree-\ning all of the time. We share the process in the hope it can help others debate the issues\nand try to come to the `best possible', or `least worst', option for their own data.\nWe would like to conclude by highlighting the implications of this discussion for the\ndesign and conduct of research more broadly. First, our work highlights some of the con-\nsiderations that might help to maximise `informed consent' via the design of consent\nforms, information for participants and dialogue during the research process. Our consent\nform (approved by both universities' ethics committees) included from the outset a range\nof permissions, from giving consent for only the project team to access the data through\nto archiving via Qualidata. This evolved over the course of the study as we expanded the\nrange of ways in which we aimed to use the data and wanted to alert participants to this\nand to give them a more nuanced set of options from which they could opt in or out. For\nexample, as we were increasingly invited to talk at medical ethics conferences we started\nto highlight the fact that the likely audience for participant data would include treating\nclinicians, and possibly the very clinicians who were currently, had previously, or might\nin future, treat the interviewee's relative (a point also explored by Kaiser, 2009). In addi-\ntion, during the course of the project, we became more skilled at detecting, during the\ncourse of an interview, possible problems with anonymising what interviewees were say-\ning, and were able to raise it with participants there and then (as shown in Extract 6). In\nother cases we contacted a participant subsequently to discuss particular concerns.\nExperience also taught us that we needed to alert participants to the possibility of future,\ncurrently unanticipated, risks to their anonymity. If, for example, after giving us permis-\nsion to use their interview in our research, they were subsequently to use the same vivid\ndescriptions in (for example) a court case or on their blog, this could allow readers to\nmake a connection. This too is something we now explicitly include in our information\nsheet for participants.\nOur research also has implications for data sharing and archiving. To manage data shar-\ning we followed a two-stage process: first a crude anonymisation of whole transcripts so\nthat we could enter them into the data management system to share with our research\ngroup, and then anonymising individual data extracts at the point of submission for publi-\ncation, leaving in only details essential to the point being made, and creating a smoke\nscreen where necessary (e.g. gender change). Even the first level of anonymising was\nextremely time-consuming \u00ad and therefore has resource implications for the funding of\ndata sharing. The first author (as research associate) anonymised names of people and\nplaces and any other obvious identifiers, but left in information which was either difficult\nto extract because it infused the whole interview, or which was essential for the analysis.\nMore than a month's labour was devoted to anonymising just 20 of the interviews (three\nweek's full-time from the first author with additional input from the two co-authors) and\nwe ran out of resources to anonymise all the data we had permission to share. Costing this\ninto future funding proposals needs to recognise the time commitment involved. As we\nworked on anonymising transcripts it also became increasingly apparent how much would\nbe lost if we created maximum protection for our participants and how difficult it would be\nto make full transcripts completely anonymous for use by other researchers in an academic\narchive. In collaborating with colleagues from different disciplines we have become\nacutely aware that there are different assumptions across disciplines about what constitutes\nappropriate anonymisation and varying levels of experience in handling sensitive empirical\ndata. It is difficult for colleagues detached from the original data collection context, and\nwithout in-depth knowledge of the field, to judge what may, or may not pose an identifica-\ntion risk. If we archive the interviews after we have finished working with them and permit\ntheir use by other researchers, we will have to do another round of anonymising and pro-\nceed with great care as our ongoing oversight of anonymity issues in relation to our dataset\nhas been an essential part of our current work with our co-authors.\nFinally, we have to admit that, even with all our efforts, anonymity cannot be com-\npletely guaranteed. It can be subverted from different directions, not least because of the\nmajor challenges to anonymity linked to the rapid changes we are seeing in the data\navailable on the world wide web, and associated practices (see Saunders et al., 2014;\nTilley and Woodthorpe, 2011). Particular challenges are posed especially through the\nincreasing use of social media (both by research participants and researchers) and open\naccess publishing of academic work (a condition of some funding) and increasing efforts\nat public engagement from academia (e.g. via impact activities). For example, our latest\nwork involves developing a `healthtalkonline.org' website for families and clinicians \u00ad\nwhere they can learn about families' experiences from the research, and hear actual\naudio, or view vivid extracts of film, from interviews with some individuals. This initia-\ntive is funded by an ESRC `Knowledge Exchange'grant, and is an invaluable addition to\nthe existing research and its outputs: ensuring the research findings are presented in an\naccessible and engaging way that can support families in the future, be used in clinical\ntraining to improve practice and, perhaps, impact on policy. However, inevitably such\ninitiatives raise new challenges for how to negotiate anonymity (or its suspension) with\nfamily members who chose to appear on film (even if they do so with pseudonyms). In\nsuch cases the sort of careful thought that goes into anonymising practices outlined in\nthis article is useful groundwork for considering how to manage deliberate suspensions\nof anonymity (e.g. through the use of voice recordings or actual film of the individual on\nthe site). Explicit negotiation with research participants is also inevitably an essential\npart of the process (e.g. participants sign off on how they wish to be described in a mini\nbiography on the site as well as being offered view of their transcripts or copy of the\nfilm). New practices also have to be used under certain circumstances; for instance, in\none case a participant was happy to have her voice used, but not her image, and requested\nthat her voice be disguised a little on the recording.\nDiscussion between researchers and research participants thus becomes an essential\npart of negotiating levels of anonymising, or its suspension under particular circum-\nstances \u00ad a process which is valuable, but time consuming, and again needs to be costed\ninto projects adopting such approaches. It also needs to be recognised that although\nresearchers have professional duties and training in relation to anonymity, research par-\nticipants may not, and sometimes research participants may take the initiative to disrupt\nanonymity or adopt `identity management' approaches in unexpected ways. As we were\nwriting this article, we were confronted with one such challenge: one of our research\nparticipants was googling information about coma and came across our (open access)\narticle about brain injury which drew on our, oh so carefully and fully anonymised, inter-\nview data (Kitzinger J and Kitzinger C, 2013). He cheerfully emailed to inform us that\nhe had worked out his own pseudonym, and linked the article to his Facebook page. This,\nto us, seemed an ironic twist, and one that almost typifies the difficulties in anonymising\nour dataset. We no longer set the terms of engagement as researchers, and anonymising\nis very much an evolving exercise that continues to throw up challenges and surprises \u00ad\nand this is subject to further reflection in Saunders et al. (2014), which also reproduces a\nrevision we made to our consent form to manage similar situations in future.\nFunding\nThis paper is part of the work of the multidisciplinary York-Cardiff `Chronic Disorders of\nConsciousness' (CDoC) Research Centre, and was part-funded by Research Priming Funds pro-\nvided by the Wellcome Trust [ref: 097829/Z/11/A] through the Centre for Chronic Diseases and\nDisorders (C2D2) at the University of York, which funded the employment of the first author as a\nResearch Assistant at the University of York.\nReferences\nBaez B (2002) Confidentiality in qualitative research: reflections on secrets, power and agency.\nBreen LJ (2007) The researcher `in the middle': negotiating the insider/outsider dichotomy.\nBritish Sociological Association (BSA) (2002) Statement of ethical practice.
