Battiston: University of Zurich, stefano.battiston@uzh.ch\n1 Introduction\nOver-the-counter (OTC) markets are particularly difficult to study empirically because of\ntheir opacity. One possibility to study their structure is to use supervisory data. In this\ndescriptive paper we use data on individual exposures between all German banks available\nat Deutsche Bundesbank. We use quarterly data from the German large credit register\nfrom 2002 to 2012 to study the joint structure of two of the most important OTC markets\nin Germany: the market for interbank liquidity and the market for credit default swaps\n(CDS). In both markets, banks engage in OTC transactions with other banks in order to\nmanage their liquidity positions. While the German interbank market has been studied in\nisolation and for shorter time periods before, this paper is the first to analyze the network\nstructure of the German CDS network. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the\nfirst that studies the joint structural evolution of two OTC markets simultaneously.\nStudying the network structure of OTC markets is important for a number of rea-\nsons. First, there is growing consensus around the idea that financial inter-linkages play\nan important role in the emergence of financial instabilities and that the mathematical\nformulation of systemic risk can greatly benefit from a network approach (see, for exam-\namong the first to study contagion in financial networks. A large and growing number of\nrecent papers study contagion via interbank markets. See, for example, Stiglitz (2008),\nGai and Kapadia (2010), Beale, Rand, Battey, Croxson, May, and Nowak (2011), Haldane\nBattiston, Delli Gatti, Gallegati, Greenwald, and Stiglitz (2012), Battiston, Gatti, Galle-\ngati, Greenwald, and Stiglitz (2012), Georg (2013), Roukny, Bersini, Pirotte, Caldarelli,\nand Battiston (2013), Acemoglu, Ozdaglar, and Tahbaz-Salehi (2013), Elliott, Golub, and\nSecond, the network structure of OTC markets can be used to identify prevalent mar-\nket mechanisms. Because OTC markets are opaque, they are potentially characterized by\nasymmetric information. Heider, Hoerova, and Holthausen (2009) stress the importance\nof asymmetric information in the interbank market as a possible cause for a market freeze,\ni.e. a substantial reduction in interbank lending activity. Other authors stress the impor-\ntance of liquidity hoarding as a potential mechanism for a market freeze (see, for example\nAcharya and Skeie (2011), Gale and Yorulmazer (2013), Acharya, Gale, and Yorulmazer\n(2011)). If a market freeze is caused by precautionary liquidity hoarding, the decision\nwhich bank is being cut-off lending should be independent of the borrower characteristics.\nIf a market freeze is caused by counterparty risk, lenders are sensitive to borrower char-\nacteristics. Glode and Opp (2013) explain the existence of intermediation chains in OTC\nmarkets with the fact that asymmetric information can be overcome if spread along a set\nof less asymmetrically informed intermediaries. One important prediction of their paper\nis that the average length of intermediation chains is longer with increased asymmetric\ninformation. We provide a test for this hypothesis. However, we find that the average\nlength of intermediation chains is only little affected by the amount of asymmetric infor-\nmation in the market (as proxied by the LIBOR-OIS spread). This result holds both for\nthe interbank as well as for the derivative network. While our result should be taken as\nindicative only, this finding shows the relevance of our structural analysis of the German\ninterbank and CDS network.\nThird, a new literature analyzes welfare impacts of OTC networks. Gofman (2013)\nintroduces a bargaining friction in sparse OTC networks and studies the inefficiencies aris-\ning from it. Neklyudov (2013) studies competition amongst dealers in an OTC network\nand shows that more efficient central dealers provide intermediation services to peripheral\ndealers. Bargaining in stationary networks is analyzed in Manea (2011) who shows that\nthe fraction an agent in a network of buyers/sellers can capture from gains from trade\nare determined by network structure. The relationship between network efficiency and\nconnectivity is addressed in Galeotti and Condorelli (2012) who point out the existence of\ntwo types of inefficiencies: either networks in equilibrium underconnected when compared\nto efficient networks, or multiple equilibria exist and agents may fail to coordinate on the\nefficient equilibrium network.\nFourth, the network structure of OTC markets is an important subject of analysis in\ndynamic models of network formation. Cohen-Cole, Patacchini, and Zenou (2012) develop\na model of banking behaviour with endogenous (interbank) network formation and, using\ndata from the e-MID electronic exchange, show that their model can be matched with em-\npirical data on the degree distribution (diversification) of banks on the interbank market.\nvan der Leij, in 't Veld, and Hommes (2013) show that the existence of a core-periphery\nstructure - which is typically found in interbank markets (see, for example, Craig and Von\nPeter (2010)) can only be explained if agents are heterogenous.\nAnd fifth, a set of models analyzes a bank's incentive to gain systemical importance\nby becoming increasingly interconnected e.g. on the interbank market. Acharya (2009)\nmodels the endogenous choice of banks asset correlations. When bank resolution mech-\nanisms focus on the insolvency of individual banks, banks endogenously correlate their\nassets more than is socially optimal. A network perspective is taken by Leitner (2005)\nwho shows that financial linkages not only spread contagion, but that the threat of conta-\ngion also induces private sector bailouts by connected banks. Eisert and Eufinger (2013)\ndevelop a model of the interbank market where banks increase their interconnectedness\nby engaging in cyclical lending. This effectively increases their systemic importance and\nthe probability of a bailout. Cyclical lending thus provides uninsured creditors with a\nmechanism to benefit from an implicit bailout guarantee.\nOne of the most studied type of financial network is arguably the interbank market\nwhere banks are nodes and links between them represent loans or payments. While some\nanalysis focus on macroscopic measures (Boss, Elsinger, Summer, and Thurner, 2004;\nSoram\u00a8\naki, Bech, Arnold, Glass, and Beyeler, 2007; Iori, De Masi, Precup, Gabbi, and\nCaldarelli, 2008; Cajueiro and Tabak, 2008; De Masi, Fujiwara, Gallegati, Greenwald,\nand Stiglitz, 2009; Cont et al., 2011), others put the emphasis on micro- and mesoscopic\nmer approach reports high heterogeneity in the number of counterparties and flows that\ndifferent banks can have in the same market. The latter approach provides evidence of\ncore-periphery structures where banks in the core act as intermediaries while banks in the\nperiphery only interact with these core banks and not with each other. While interbank\nnetworks have been extensively analyzed, CDS networks are much less studied (Markose,\nGiansante, Gatkowski, and Shaghaghi (2012), and Peltonen, Scheicher, and Vuillemey\nOur paper contributes to this literature not only by providing a complete account of\nthe evolution of the German interbank market, but also by combining it with an analysis\nof the network of CDS contracts. This enables us to study the correlation of the two\nnetwork structures over a long period of time. Furthermore and in contrast to most of\nthe literature, our networks take the amounts of contracts and (when possible) directions\ninto account.\nWe report a number of interesting findings about the structural evolution of the Ger-\nman credit and derivative market. The data, however, shows surprisingly little variation\nover time. Neither the financial crisis of 2007/2008, nor the eurocrisis, or the business\ncycle have a substantial and visible effect on the credit market. The market for derivative\nbecomes more concentrated and more important in terms of aggregated volumes in the\nrun-up to the crisis, but remains structurally (as measured by degree distributions and\nhigher order moments of the network) fairly constant. The structure rather evolves slowly\nover time which indicates that the interbank network structure is not as volatile as one\nmight think.\nWe also analyze the evolution of structural roles in terms of network centralities and\nthe correlation between banking activities. On the one hand, correlation between lend-\ning and borrowing activities both in terms of number of counterparties and of volumes\nare remarkably high and stable over time for the credit market while correlation in the\nderivative deteriorates with the increase of volume concentration. On the other hand,\ncorrelation between banking activities and structural roles in both markets (i.e., the cor-\nrelation between a bank's properties in the credit and the derivative market) is remarkably\nhigh for most of the variables except the clustering coefficient.\nThe paper is organized as follows. After this introduction we describe the dataset and\nthe methods in Section 2. In Section 3 we report the results obtained and in Section 4 we\ndiscuss the results.\nWe use data present at the Deutsche Bundesbank containing banking exposures reports.\nBy German law, all domestic banks have to report all bilateral liability exposures each\nquarter if related the exposure was larger then 1.5 kEUR at any point during the quarter.\nWe have such information for the period spanning from January 2002 to August 2012,\nwhich results in 43 time periods.\nFrom this dataset, we extract only bank-related exposures, that is, we exclude all\nkinds of other information with regards to banks reporting exposures to other types of\nfirms. We then map the lending and borrowing activity of each bank by combining the\nidentifiers that reported when they lend to or borrow from other banks in the dataset.\nWe also take care of multiple reporting of bank holding corporation through several legal\nentities by aggregating all the information at the holding corporation level. Note that,\nwe also take bank mergers into account but, contrary to other works, not in a backward\nfashion: if two banks merge during a given quarter Qt\n, all information will be aggregated\nunder the acquirer bank for each further quarter Qt >t\nbut not for the quarters prior to\nQt\n, Qtp<t\n. This enables us to have a clearcut view of the market evolution over time,\nperiod by period. Also, forcing the aggregation allows to deal with potential legal effects\nwhich, in some cases, still force some acquired banks to still report independently for some\nperiods.\nThe term exposure here stands both for credit relationship and derivative contracts.\nThe reported credit relationship contains the lender identifier and the borrower identifier,\nthe notional value of the credit. The derivative contracts represent securities taken by\na bank from another depending on a credit relationship between the former bank and a\nthird bank and the value of the underlying credit is reported. Such contracts can be of\nseveral forms (e.g., Credit Default Swap, Total Return Swap, Credit Linked Note). Due\nto the complex nature of some of the contracts and the related reporting requirements,\nit is difficult to have a clear view on the exposure dependencies. We will therefore not\nconsider directionality for the case of derivative contracts (see next Section).\nFinally, the data used in this paper is highly confidential. As a result, constrains exist\non the granularity level of the disclosed results. More precisely, individual information on\nbanks cannot be disclosed. Therefore, the results presented are aggregated either at the\nsystem level or at the percentile level and ensure that each result is the aggregation of\nten banks at least. Distributions are thus proxied via the use of information of a series of\npercentiles (see next Section).\n2.2 Network Analysis\nA network is a set of nodes that are connected to each other via links. When the network\nis said to be directed and weighted, the links have a direction (from one node to another)\nand an associated value. In our context, the network consists of banks that are connected\nwhenever an exposure is reported in the data. We distinguish between two kinds of expo-\nsures: credit exposure and derivative exposure. In the credit exposure case, the network\nis directed: a link goes from the lender to the borrower. Hence, a bank having at least\none outgoing (resp. incoming) link in a given period is considered lender (resp.borrower)\nin that period. Obviously, a bank can act as a borrower and lender in the same period.\nThe weight of a link corresponds to the total amount of money currently being lent by\nthe lender to the borrower.In the derivative case, the directionality is more subtle as it\ndepends on the type of contract (see previous Section). In the following, we thus consider\nundirected networks when we analyze the derivative market.\nDensity. We compute the density d of the network as the the ratio between the\nnumber of realized loans and the number of all possible loans as defined in the following\nformula:\nd = i j\nij\n(n(n - 1))\nwhere ij\n= 1 if there is an existing loans between the bank i and the bank j and ij\notherwise. The parameter n is the total number of banks in the network. For example,\na complete network (i.e. where all banks are connected to each other) has a density of 1\nwhile a star network (i.e. where one bank is connected to all the others) has a density of\n.\nDegree. In a network, the degree ki\nof a bank i is the number of counterparties that\nthe bank has. When the network is directed, we distinguish between two sides. The\nin-degree, kin\ni\n, is the number of banks that have a loan to the bank i. It corresponds\nto the number of lenders of bank i and, hence, is a measure of the bank's liability side\ndiversification. Correspondingly, the out-degree, kout\ni\n, is the number of banks that receive\na loan from the bank i. It corresponds to the number of borrowers of bank i and, hence,\nit is a measure of the bank's asset side diversification.\nFormally, the degree can be defined as follows in the directed case:\nki\n= kout\ni\n+ kin\ni\nWhere kout\ni\n=\nj\nij\nand kin\ni\n=\nj\nji\n. In the undirected case, kout\ni\nand kin\ni\nare equal and\nki\ntakes the same value. The average degree k is the average number of connections that\nbanks have in the network irrespective of the direction:\nk = i\nki\nn\nAverage Shortest Path Length. In a network, a path is a set of links that allow\ntwo banks to reach each other. The number of links (i.e., loans) needed to define a path\ncorresponds to the length of this path which can be seen as the length of intermediation\nchain between two banks. The shortest path length, dij\n, between two banks i and j is\nthus the minimal amount of intermediary connections needed to go from one bank to the\nother. The average shortest path length of a network is the average minimal number of\nlinks that are needed to connect 2 banks in the network:\nl = i j=i\ndij\nIn our study, we consider two types of networks. The credit network transfers liquid-\nity amongst counterparties. A path in the credit network is a set of loans that transfer\nliquidity from one bank to another. Derivative contracts also provide liquidity exchange\nbetween two counterparties. In contrast to the credit network, however, derivative con-\ntracts provide liquidity conditional on an underlying event.\nDiameter. The diameter is the maximum length of all shortest paths in the network.\nHence, it is the number of links present in the longest intermediation chain present in the\nnetwork. Note that the diameter must be computed on a connected network, that is, a\nnetwork in which, for every pair of banks, there exists a least one path connecting the\ntwo banks. In fact, if ever two banks cannot not reach each other, the diameter of the\ncorresponding network is infinite.\nVolume. The volume vi\nis the aggregated value of all the loans associated with a\nnode. In economic terms, it amounts to the size of a bank interbank assets and liabilities.\nWhen the network is directed, we distinguish between the volume of interbank assets,\nvout\ni\n, and the volume of interbank liabilities vin\ni\n. Similar to the degree, we formally define\nthe total volume of a bank in a directed network as follows :\nvi\n= vout\ni\n+ vin\ni\nwhere vout\ni\n=\nj\nwij\nand vin\ni\n=\nj\nwji\n. In the undirected case, vout\ni\nand vin\ni\nare equal and\nvi\ntakes the same value. Where wij\nis the value of the loan from i to j.\nHerfindhal Hirschman Index (HHI). The HHI index is a measure of market con-\ncentration. We use this measure to compute the level of concentration in terms of both\ndegree and volume, that is, we analyze how concentrated the system is in terms of share\nof connections and of share of money involvement. The formula is expressed as:\n+ ... + s2\nnx\nwhere six\nis the share of the i-th firm. The index x indicates if the analysis is on the\ndegree share (x = k) or on the volume share (x = v). The higher the HHI value, the more\nconcentration there is in the system.\nClustering coefficient. The clustering coefficient measures the probability for a\nbank to have counterparties that are also connected to each other. Here, we do not\naccount for directionality nor weights. Furthermore, this measure can be seen as a proxy\nfor the size of counterparty risk externality (e.g., Acharya and Bisin (2013)) which exists\nwhenever two related banks share a common third counterparty. Another way to define\nthe clustering coefficient of a bank is to compute the number of triangles that can be\nformed within the set of the bank's counterparties and the bank itself:\nCi\n= j=i h=(i,j)\nij\nih\njh\nki\n(ki\nwhere ij\nih\njh\n= 1 whenever there exists a triangle linking banks i, j and h. The average\nclustering coefficient C is the average value of this coefficient for each bank in the network:\nC = i\nCi\nn\nBetweenness.The betweenness is a network centrality measure allowing to partially\ncharacterize the structural role of a bank in the market. The betweenness of a bank i\ncomputes the number of shortest paths in the network that pass through the bank i.\nBanks with higher betweenness belong to a larger amount of chains of intermediation.\nbi\n=\nj h=j\nsjh\n(i)\nsjh\nwhere sjh\n(i) is the number of shortest paths between the bank j and h in which the bank\ni is found and sjh\nis the total number of shortest paths between the bank j and h. The\naverage betweenness b is the average value related to each bank in the network\nb = i\nbi\nn\nCloseness.The closeness is another centrality measure allowing to compute the aver-\nage shortest distance (in terms of links) to all the other banks in the network. Let li\nbe\nthe average shortest path length from i to all the other banks in the network:\nli\n= j\ndij\nWhere dij\nis the length of the shortest path between i and j. The closeness of i is then\ndefined as the inverse of the former value:\ncli\n=\nli\n=\nj\ndij\nThe average closeness cl is the average value related to each node in the network\ncl = i\ncli\nn\nEigenvector The eigenvector centrality is computed from the adjacency matrix A in\nwhich aij\n= 1 if the banks i and j are connected and aij\n= 0 otherwise. The eigenvector\ncentrality is the vector e satisfying the following relationship :\ne = Ae\nwhere  is the largest eigenvalue. The eigenvector centrality of a bank i is thus defined\nby:\nei\n=\n\naij\nej\nThe resulting centrality vector thus takes into account the centrality of the neighbors\nto compute the centrality of each bank. This measure retrieves the level of centrality of a\nbank with respect to the number of its counterparties and the of number of counterparties\nits counterparties have, etc.\nPercentiles.A percentile i% is a statistical measure retrieving the threshold beyond\nwhich i% of the population can be found. We use this measure to analyze the state\nand evolution degrees and volumes distributions among the banks in the network, i.e. to\nexplore the cross-sectional dimension of our measures. In other words, through a set of\nactivities both in terms of lending/borrowing relationships (degree) and liquidity flows\n(volume). Contrary to the usual use, we use percentiles as values above which one can\nfind the dedicated population. For example, if the percentile 10% of the degree distribu-\ntion is 15, it means that in order to belong to the 10% of most connected banks, one has to\nhave more than 15 counterparties. To compute it, it suffices to order values of the distri-\nbution and determine the value beyond which i% (or more) of the population is addressed.\nCorrelation In order to assess the existence of correlations between networks features,\nwe compute the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, between 2 sets of results\nX and Y.\nr =\nn\ni\n((Xi\n- X)(Yi\n- Y )\nn\ni\n(Xi\ni\n(Yi\nThis measure retrieves the level of linear correlation between the two sets of values\nwith a certain inverval of confidence (p-value). Resulting values are between -1 and +1,\nwhere +1 (resp. -1) corresponds to a total positive (resp. negative) correlation. If the\nvalue is 0, then the two sets are not correlated.\nFurthermore, this metric is used in two different contexts. On the one hand, we use it\nto analyse the degree of correlation between banks' features within a market (i.e. credit\nor derivative): (i) In-Out degree (i.e., The level of correlation between the in and out\ndegree offers an information about the extent to which a bank having many lenders will\nalso have many borrowers), (ii) In-Out volume (i.e., the extent to which a bank acting as\na large creditor (in absolute amounts of money) is also likely to act as a large borrower)\nand (iii) Degree-Volume (i.e., The level of correlation between the degree of a bank and its\nvolume is useful to assert wether largely connected banks tend to significantly be highly\nactive in terms of flows of fund).\nAdditionally, we also use the Pearson correlation to compute the degree assortativity\nand link reciprocity in each network. The former is obtained by assessing for each link the\ncorrelation between the degrees of the nodes . This measure can be seen as the likelihood\nthat large banks lend to large, and small banks lend to small banks. When it is negative,\nthe network is said to be dissassortative: large banks tend to interact more with small\nbanks. The former measures was introduced in Garlaschelli and Loffredo (2004) and\nassesses the tendency for the connected nodes in a directed graph to have links in the two\ndirections (i.e., mutual connections):\n = i=j\n(aij\n- d)(aji\n- d)\ni=j\n(aij\nwhere d is the density presented above.\nOn the other hand, we also compute correlations in order to assess how banks behave\nPeriod\nNumber of nodes\nCredit\nAll Banks Lenders Borrowers\nDerivative\nNumber of Banks\nDegree\nDensity\nPeriod\nCredit\nDensity Avg Degree\nDerivative\nDensity Avg Degree\ncurves in tones of red show the evolution of the market of credit ties while the blue line\nshows the results of the market of derivatives.

This is achieved by com-\nparing the sets of relative values (i.e., divided by the maximum value in the given market)\nof (i) degree, (ii) volume, (iii) clustering coefficient, (iv) betweennes and (v) closeness for\neach bank in the derivative market and the corresponding values in the credit market.\nReciprocity Component Analysis. A directed network can be decomposed onto\nfour different sets. The Largest Strongly Connected Component (LSCC) is the largest\nsubset of the network in which for every pair of banks there exists a path connecting the\ntwo bank: every bank can reach any other bank within the LSCC. The OUT component\n(OUT) is the set of banks not belonging to the LSCC but that can be reached from\nbanks in the LSCC, directly or indirectly. The IN component (IN) is the set of banks\nnot belonging to the LSCC but that can reach nodes in the LSCC, directly or indirectly.\nThe Tubes and Tendrils are banks that do not belong to the LSCC and cannot either be\nreached by nor reach any bank from the LSCC.\nIn this section we report the results of our empirical analyses. We start from the simplest\nmeasures, such as size and density of the network and proceed to more sophisticated\nmeasures like correlations. As much as possible we try to compare the results for the\ninterbank credit network to the results for the derivative network.\n3.1 Size and Density\nAs Figure 1 (left) shows, the number of banks in the credit network (red tones) decreases\nslowly but steadily over the years from about 2200 to about 1700. We can distinguish\nbetween banks lending to at least one other bank, i.e. with at least one outgoing link,\nkout\ni\n> 0, denoted as \"lenders\", and banks borrowing from at least one other bank, i.e.\nwith at least one incoming link, kin\ni\n> 0, denoted as \"borrowers\". Their number is ap-\nproximately the same as the total over time, meaning that all banks act at the same\ntime as lenders and borrowers in at least one relation. Note, that the number of borrow-\ners and lenders is not trivially equal, as we only require kin/out > 0 for a bank to be a\nlender/borrower. The total in-degree (the number of incoming links in all nodes), how-\never, is trivially equal to the total out-degree (number of outgoing links from all nodes)\nbecause of simple accounting. Later, we analyse the extent to which banks' activities are\nrelated in terms of lending and borrowing in more detail.\nThe same figure shows also how the number of banks in the derivative network (in\nblue) is remarkably stable over time. Notice, however, that this figure only provides the\nnumber of banks participating in the market even with just one contract and, hence, does\nnot account neither for the density of the network nor the volumes involved.\nFigure 1 (right) shows the average degree and the density both for the credit and\nthe derivative networks. The average degree of the credit network increases over time\nwork increases over the time span of the data by +49.85% while the one of the derivative\nnetwork increases by +58.42%. This suggests that the relative amount of ties in both\nmarkets has significantly increased over time. Nevertheless, while the density increase\nof the credit network can be seen as a mere consequence of the continuous shrinking in\nthe number of market participants, the increase of density in the derivative is important\nas the total size of that market remained rather stable over time. In any cases, density\nvalues remain at a low level (i.e., smaller than 0.008 for the credit market and smaller\nthan 0.004 for the derivative market). Hence, those networks are very sparse.\nWhen we move to analyse aggregate volumes and concentration, Figure 2 (left) shows\nthat the volume of the contracts in the credit network contains several cycles providing\nfor an increase of more than 13% (i.e., an increase of  182 billion euros) with respect\nsimilar to the initial values from 2002Q1. Interestingly, those peaks do not coincide with\nthe business cycle. The biggest peak directly before the height of the crisis in 2008Q3\nindicates substantially heightened market activity in the run-up to the Lehman insolvency.\nIn contrast, the volume of contracts in the derivative network has a much larger volatil-\nhighest peak of the CDS market is in 2008Q3, almost coincident with the highest peak in\nVolume in k-euros\nVolume in k-euros\nPeriod\nCredit\nAggregate Volume\nDerivative\nAggregate Volume\nPeriod\nHerfindhal Hirschman Index\nCredit\nDegree\nVolume\nDerivative\nDegree\nVolume\nFigure 2: (Left) Evolution of the aggregate volume in the credit (red) and derivative\n(blue) interbank market from 2002 to 2012.

(Right)\nEvolution of the HHI for degrees and volume in the system from 2002 to 2012 for the\ncredit (red tones) and derivative (blue tones) interbank market.\nthe credit market.\nComplementary to the information on volumes is the measure of how much the vol-\nume and number of contracts are concentrated across banks in the market. To this end,\nwe measure concentration by means of the Herfindhal index (HHI) of both the number\nof contracts (degree) and the volumes. Higher values of HHI in the degree imply that\ncontracts are established with a smaller number of banks that act as hubs. Higher values\nof HHI in the volumes imply that a smaller number of banks handles a larger fraction of\nthe contracts in terms of volumes. Figure 2 (right) shows that the concentration in the\ncredit network of both degree and volume was stable or at most slightly decreasing. In\nthe derivative network, however, concentration of volumes increase to more than double\nagain.\nThe inverse of the HHI gives a proxy of the number of leading actors in the mar-\nket. Thus, the number of contracts for the credit market tends to be concentrated in\nderivative market, this subset contains among 30 leading banks (i.e., average: 29.5\u01052.68).\nIn terms of volume concentration, the credit market contains a subset of about 35\nleading banks (i.e., average: 35.64 \u0105 1.845). For the case of the derivative market, it\nstarts with approximately 14 banks in 2002Q1. At the highest point, the number of lead-\ning banks falls around 7 before reaching a bigger set of 22 banks by the end of 2012.\n3.2 Clustering and Centrality\nThe clustering coefficient is a measure of the fraction of triangles present in the network\nout of all the possible triangles that could be formed. Triangles are considered here as\nundirected and thus can correspond to several configurations involving three banks. In\ngeneral, the intuition is that the higher the clustering coefficient the higher chances that\nthe counterparties of a given bank are also engaging in a contract together. The clustering\ncoefficient is thus a measure of the counterparty risk externality introduced by Acharya\nand Bisin (2013). Betweenness measures the probability that a given bank is found on the\nshortest path of liquidity transfer between two other banks. Closeness gives a measure of\nproximity between all banks in the network by computing the average distance between a\nbank and all the other banks. Finally, the eigenvector centrality measures how important\na bank is in terms of connectivity taking into account the importance of its neighbors in\na recursive way.\nAs shown in Figure 3 (Top Left), we observe that the clustering coefficient of the\ncredit network remains stable over time while the one of the derivative network increases\nsteadily over time to levels that are twice as large as those in 2002. The initial value of the\ncoefficient in 2002 is very high for the credit network, c  0.87 (the coefficient has to be\nsmaller than one by definition, see more details in Methods), meaning that the majority\nof the triangles are in fact present. In contrast, the initial value for the derivative network\nThe average betweenness centrality of banks increases over time for both networks (see\nFigure 3, Top Left). While the slope for the credit network is higher (i.e., 30% change in\nthe whole time period) and steady, the derivative network is more volatile and increases\nless (i.e., a 10% change in the whole time period). This is in line with the increase in link\ndensity that we observed in Figure 1 but contrasts with the behaviour of the clustering\ncoefficient for the credit network (Figure 3, Top Left). The absolute betweenness values\nfor both networks are very small, especially in the credit case, which is in line with having\na highly heterogenous structure. The derivative case is less pronounced but shares same\ncharacteristics as the credit case.\nIn contrast to the betweenness, the closeness centrality for both networks is remark-\nably stable over time and absolute values are high. This indicates an important proximity\nbetween banks in both markets. The fact that this proximity almost did not change over\ntime is also interesting.\nThe average eigenvector centrality was small and very similar for both networks at\nthe beginning of our timeframe. While the derivative network oscillate around the same\nvalue over time, the credit network' average eigenvector centrality continuously increased\nover time (increase of 64.9% between the first and the last quarter). On average, banks\nthus significantly increased their average connectivity importance in the credit market.\nClustering Coeficient\nClustering Coeficient\nPeriod\nCredit\nAvg Clustering Coeficient\nDerivative\nAvg Clustering Coeficient\nBetweenness\nBetweenness\nPeriod\nCredit\nAvg Betweenness\nDerivative\nAvg Betweenness\nPeriod\nCloseness\nCredit\nAvg Closeness\nDerivative\nAvg Closeness\nPeriod\nEigenvector\nCredit\nAvg Eigenvector\nDerivative\nAvg Eigenvector\nValues for the credit network are reported on the left axis while values for the derivative\nnetwork are reported on the right axis.

(Bottom Right) Evolution\n3.3 Degree and Volume Distributions\nNext, we report the distributions of the number of contracts (degree) across banks and\nthe distributions of volumes of contracts across banks. The second quantity refers, for\neach bank, to the total value of all the contracts in which the bank is involved as lender or\nborrower. From the data, we construct a degree distribution for each quarter. In order to\ncharacterize the distributions we performed a Kolmogoroff-Smirnoff test to confirm/reject\nthe hypothesis that the tail of the distribution is power law using the method of Clauset,\nShalizi, and Newman (2009). The hypothesis was rejected systematically in all analyzed\nquarters.\nFigure 4 reports the average values of the percentiles over time. Due to the high\nheterogeneity (i.e., several orders of magnitude), each case is reported in normal with\nan horizontal bar indicating the confidence interval of one standard deviation and semi-\nlogarithmic scales. Each plot can be read as follows. For a given point on the curve, the\ny-axis coordinate of the point gives the percentage of banks with a degree larger than or\nequal to the value of the x-axis coordinate of the point. Thus for instance, in the credit\nnetwork (left panel) only 50% of the banks have a degree larger than 10. Compared to all\nother percentiles, the 1-st percentile is further in the tail by more than one order of mag-\nhas an average degree of 33.765 \u0105 1.46). This shows a high heterogeneity in the degree\ndistribution of the credit network even if the tail overall cannot be fitted with a power-law.\nDegree\nPercentiles\nDegree\nPercentiles\nDegree\nPercentiles\nDegree\nPercentiles\nFigure 4: (Top) Average percentiles value and standard deviation in normal scale (Left)\nand average percentiles value in semi-logarithmic scale (Right) between 2002Q1 and\n2012Q3 for the degree distribution in the credit network (Bottom) Average percentiles\nvalue and standard deviation in normal scale (Left) and average percentiles value in semi-\nderivative network.\nWe notice that the distribution in the derivative network exhibits an almost vertical\nline from the 80-th to the 30-th percentile, suggesting an important break between a\nlarge set of banks (more than 70% of the market) being only interacting with a couple of\nother banks and a smaller set of much more connected banks. Furthermore, the latter set\nalso shows a high inner heterogeneity as the 1-st percentile (i.e., 128.61 \u0105 25.2) is almost\nDegree (Credit) Degree (Derivative)\nTable 1: Average skewness and kurtosis of degree distribution between 2002Q1 and\nAs a second representation, Figure 5 shows the evolution over time of the various per-\ncentiles. We can read the plot as follows. Consider for instance the curve corresponding\nto the 1-st percentile (pale cyan) in the credit network (top-left panel). In order to be in\nthe top 1-st percentile of the degree distribution, a bank needs to have a degree larger\nthan 450. Most curves in Figure 5 (Top) are stable over time meaning that the distri-\nbution of degree in the credit network does not change much across the years. The top\n1-st percentile curve increases sensibly in 2008 (i.e., an increase of 22%), implying that\nin order to remain in the same percentile a bank would have needed to increase its total\nnumber of contracts by one fifth. This number then decreases back to previous values.\nThis behaviour of the top 1% of banks could result from a flight to quality. An alter-\nnative interpretation could be that banks in the core of the financial system, i.e. large,\ninternationally connected and therefore potentially susceptible to foreign shocks, trying\nto gain systemic importance by becoming more interconnected (see Eisert and Eufinger\n(2013) for a theoretical model of this mechanism).\nThe situation for the derivative network is shown in Figure 5 (Bottom) where we no-\ntice two things. First, the curves for percentiles that are below the top 5-th percentile and\n10-th percentile are packed at the bottom of the plot, meaning that the banks in those\npercentiles have smaller degree as compared to the case of the credit network. This is\nsimply another way of looking at the same effect that was shown in Figure 4. Second, the\ncurves for top 5-th percentile, 10-th percentile and, most importantly, the 1-st percentile,\nincrease over time by almost a factor of two. This means that it takes higher degree (twice\nas high to be precise) to remain in the same percentile, implying the distribution becomes\nsubstantially more skewed over time.\nTable 1 reports the average skewness and kurtosis value over the whole time period of\nboth credit and derivative degree distributions. Reported resulted show that the degree\ndistribution of the derivative is comparatively more skewed and has a more then two times\nhigher kurtosis.\nIn addition, we carried out the same analysis just described for volumes. Figure 6\nreports the average values of the percentiles over time, with horizontal bars indicating the\nconfidence interval of one standard deviation for the plots with normal axis. The plots\ncan be read similar to the one in Figure 4. For instance, in the credit network (top panel)\nonly 1% of the banks have, on average, an aggregate volume larger than 30 billion euros\n(the scale is in thousand euros). Again, we notice that the distribution is steeper in the\nderivative network than in the credit network, implying that the tail of the distribution\nis broader.\nPeriod\nDegree\nPeriod\nDegree\nPeriod\nDegree\nPeriod\nDegree\nFigure 5: (Top) Evolution of percentiles in normal scale (Left) and in semi-logarithmic\n(Bottom) Evolution of percentiles in normal scale (Left) and in semi-logarithmic scale\nAs a second representation, similar to Figure 5, Figure 7 shows the evolution over time\nof the various percentiles of the volume distribution. Consider the curve corresponding\nto the 1-st percentile (pale cyan) in the credit network (top-left panel). It shows the\nevolution of the minimum volume that a bank needs in order to belong to the 1% banks\nwith the highest volume in the market. It increases over time and it is characterized by\ntop-right panel suggests that the market did not structurally change through the analyzed\ntime period as the distances between the curves stay similar over time.\nIn the derivative case (Bottom), the 1st percentile is even more volatile with four\nboom-and-bust periods but does not point towards a general trend. Nevertheless, the\nresults from Figure 2 on the evolution of the total volume and the HHI of the volume con-\ncentration presented a trend peaking in 2008 and decreasing back to previous values. The\npresent result suggests that the increase between 2005 and 2010 occurs mainly because\nVolume in k-euros 1e7\nPercentiles\nVolume in k-euros\nPercentiles\nVolume in k-euros 1e6\nPercentiles\nVolume in k-euros\nPercentiles\nFigure 6: (Top) Average percentiles value and standard deviation in normal scale (Left)\nand average percentiles value in semi-logarithmic scale (Right) between 2002Q1 and\n2012Q3 for the volume distribution in the credit network (Bottom) Average percentiles\nvalue and standard deviation in normal scale (Left) and average percentiles value in semi-\nderivative network.\nof a smaller subset of banks comprised in the 1st percentile. Also notice that the lower\npercentiles are closer to zero meaning that the distribution of volumes in the derivative\nnetwork is more skewed than the one in the credit network.\nTable 2 reports the average skewness and kurtosis value over the whole time period\nof both credit and derivative volume distributions. Interestingly, results are very similar\nbetween both distributions even though the derivative network exhibits higher deviation\nin both cases.\nWe now turn to the correlation between the quantities investigated so far (see Figure\n3.4 Top-Left). We look at three combinations of quantities. The first is the correlation\nbetween the number of contracts in which a bank is involved as a borrower versus those\nin which it appears as a lender, i.e. between in-degree and out-degree. The second is the\nPeriod\nVolume in k-euros\nPeriod\nVolume in k-euros\nPeriod\nVolume in k-euros\nPeriod\nVolume in k-euros\nFigure 7: (Top) Evolution of percentiles in normal scale (Left) and in semi-logarithmic\n(Bottom) Evolution of percentiles in normal scale (Left) and in semi-logarithmic scale\ncorrelation between the volume of the contracts in which a bank appears as a borrower\nversus those where it appears as lender. The third combination is the correlation between\nnumber of contracts in which a bank is involved in either role (total degree) an the total\nvolume of those contracts. For the network of derivatives, we do not look at the direction\nof the links and thus we only consider the correlation degree-volume.\nThe correlations between variables in the credit network (degree in-out, volume in-out,\ndegree-volume) are remarkably high, and remarkably constant over time, as can be seen\nfrom Figure 3.4 (Top, Left). This implies that banks the lending and borrowing activities\nare highly correlated both in terms of number of counterparties and in terms of levels\nof total contracts volumes. In contrast, the degree-volume correlation of the derivative\nthen increases back to high values (> 0.7). This U-shaped evolution is in line with the\nprevious results from Figure 2 showing the evolution of the concentration of volumes and\ndegrees. As a result of the increasing volume and its concentration and relatively constant\naverage degree, the correlation between the degree and the volumes drops between 2010.\nVolume (Credit) Volume (Derivative)\nTable 2: Average skewness and kurtosis of volume distribution between 2002Q1 and\nPeriod\nCredit\nDegree in-out Volume in-out Degree-Volume\nDerivative\nDegree-Volume\nPeriod\nDegree\nVolume\nClustering\nBetweenness\nCloseness\nDegree\nVolume\nClustering\nBetweenness\nCloseness\nPeriod\nCredit\nReciprocity\nCredit\nReciprocity\nPeriod\nCredit\nDegree Assortativity\nDerivative\nDegree Assortativity\ncredit and the derivative networks.

(Bottom Left) Evolution of the degree assortativity between 2002Q1\nand 2012Q3 for the credit and the derivative network.\nWe then analyze quantity correlation between the two markets by comparing quan-\ntities related to nodes present in the two networks. We thus assess the extent to which\nbanking activity and structural roles are correlated between the credit and the derivative\nmarket. Figure (Top-Right) retrieves the results of such comparison for the following met-\nrics: total degree, total volume, clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality and closeness\ncentrality. The degree-degree and betweenness-betweenness correlation between the credit\nand the derivative network are also remarkably large and remarkably constant over time.\nThe volume-volume correlation takes a dip due to the volume dynamics in the derivatives\nMeasure Average Std Error\nTable 3: Shares of components and analysis of the LSCC\nmarket mentioned above. Finally, closeness-closeness correlation is largely positive (start-\nclustering-clustering correlation is constantly negative and stable.\nA related analysis concerns the so-called reciprocity of the links, that is the fraction\nof links that exist in both directions out of the total number of links. The reciprocity\ncan only be computed for the the credit network. Figure 3.4 (Bottom-Left) shows that\nreciprocity is positive but slightly decreasing over time (from around 0.4 to 0.3). Note\nthat our data contains end-of-quarter exposures between banks, which means that lending\ncan still be driven by liquidity demand as long as banks also engage in interbank lending\nwith maturity larger than the end of quarter.\nFinally, assortativity in both networks is negative and increasingly so as shown in\nFigure 3.4(Bottom-Right): both networks are thus dissassortative. This implies that small\nbanks have a tendency to lend to and borrow from large banks and vice versa. Negative\nassortativity is to be expected in highly heterogenous networks (e.g. core-periphery).\n3.5 Topological Structure\nA strongly connected component (SCC) is a subgraph in which every node can reach any\nother node along some path in the subgraph. Many empirical networks display a non-\ntrivial bow-tie structure (e.g.Vitali, Glattfelder, and Battiston (2011)), in the sense that\nthey can be decomposed into a largest strongly connected component (LSCC) and into\nnon-empty in and out components. The former consist of all the nodes that can reach\nthe LSCC but cannot be reached from the node in there. The latter consists of the nodes\nthat can be reached from the nodes in the LSCC but cannot reach the LSCC.\nSince the derivative network is undirected this analysis only makes sense for the credit\nnetwork. From Table 3, we find that the in- and out- component are very small and\nthe LSCC makes up almost the entire network. The fraction of banks in the LSCC is\nIn principle it would be possible that the banks in the tiny in- or out-component are\nimportant in terms of volume. It turns out that they aren't. Almost all the volume is\nlocated at the banks in the LSCC and this remains stable over time (99.66% \u0105 0.002%).\n4 Conclusion\nIn this paper we analyse the network of the German interbank credit and derivative mar-\nket from 2002 to 2012. Our data provides a unique view on the joint structure of two of\nthe most important OTC markets in Germany and covers over two thousand banks. The\nGerman interbank market is large in size compared to other countries and thus exhibits\npotentially rich dynamics.\nWe report a number of interesting findings about the structural evolution of the Ger-\nman credit and derivative market. Even though the credit market is much bigger than\nthe derivative market, its size steadily decreases over time while the size of the derivative\nmarket remains stable. Both markets are very sparse (i.e., their density of connection\nis low). Nevertheless, the average number of counterparties in each case increases over\nthe period. It is worth noting that the derivative market followed increases more than\nfour times more than the credit market. The connectivity distributions of both markets,\nwhile not following a power-law, show substantial heterogeneity and fat tails. Much of the\nchange of both markets occurs in the tail. While the distribution structure remains sim-\nilar between the different quarters for the credit market, the derivative market becomes\nincreasingly and continuously more skewed over time.\nIn terms of volumes, the derivative market more then doubled in terms aggregated\nlevel and concentration in the pre-crises period and then decreased to reach back initial\nvalues at the end of 2012. The volume levels of the credit market are comparatively more\nimportant by more than one order. The evolution of the aggregated level over time of\nthe latter market is much less volatile and characterized by four smaller boom-and-busts\nperiods. The concentration is smaller and stable over time. The distribution of volumes\nin both markets is highly heterogenous. Again, much of the change occurs in the tail\nwhere the one percent of most active banks continuously and importantly increased their\nlevel of volume activity.\nIn terms of network metrics, we find that the two market have an opposite profile\nin terms of clustering. The credit market has a very high average clustering coefficient\nwhile the derivative market has a substantially smaller value. The former is stable over\ntime while the latter steadily increases. Betweenness in both markets is small and slowly\nincreases throughout the period. Closeness is surprisingly similar in both markets and its\nevolution is almost flat. Finally, the average eigenvector centrality increased over time in\nthe credit market while, in the derivative case, it remains around the same level.\nCorrelations between various network measures in each market are remarkably high\nand stable in the credit market except the correlation between the aggregated volume\nand aggregated number of counterparties per bank in the derivative network which has\na U-shaped profile over time. Correlations across markets are similarly high and stable\nexcept the volume correlation, which follows a U-shape as well, and the clustering co-\nefficient, which is negative. The credit market also is also characterized by a high level\nof reciprocity between banks. The structure of the credit network, as measured by the\nrelative size and volumes of the strongly connected component is stable over time.\nThe results of this paper are relevant for policy makers, though, as they show a\nremarkable resilience of both studied OTC networks to endogenous and exogenous shocks.\nOne could argue that banks will unwind existing positions and distance themselves from\nthe market when there is a shock somewhere in the system. The resilience of the network\nstructure, however, indicates that banks are either unwilling or unable to do so, thus\nhighlighting the necessity of interbank network and contagion analyses.\nReferences\nAcemoglu, D., A.
