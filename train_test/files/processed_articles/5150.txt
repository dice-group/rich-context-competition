    "abstract": "Abstract\nVocabulary is an important part of language which is central to all language skills and meaningful communication. One way\nthrough which vocabulary learning can be facilitated is by the use of vocabulary learning strategies (VLS). VLSs can empower\nlanguage learners to be more self-directed, regulated, and autonomous. Also, they can help language learners to discover\nand consolidate the meaning of the words more effectively. Teachers' and students' behavior, functioning, and learning are,\nhowever, controlled by their thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, and perceptions. The present study was an effort to explore the\nIranian EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners' and teachers' beliefs about the usefulness of different types of VLSs. To\nthat end, a VLS questionnaire developed for this purpose was given to 392 EFL teachers and learners. Based on the results\nof the study, the Iranian EFL learners and teachers believed that strategies such as paying attention to vocabulary forms,\nfunctions, and semantic relations; guessing the meaning of new words from the context; and using monolingual dictionaries\ncan be very useful in discovering and consolidating the meaning of new words. They, nevertheless, expressed hesitancy to\nuse L1, bilingual dictionaries, and mnemonic devices. The results of Kruskal\u00adWallis Test also showed that the preference for\na few strategies differed across levels of education.\n",

The developments in the area of\nlinguistics along with new sociocultural demands challenged\nthe status quo (Richards & Rodgers, 2003). More recently,\nresearchers (Amiryousefi & Kassaian, 2010; Amiryousefi &\nhave viewed vocabulary as an important part of language on\nwhich effective communication relies. Schmitt (2010), for\nexample, believes that meaningful communication in a foreign\nlanguage depends mostly on words. If learners do not have the\navailable words to express their ideas, mastering grammatical\nrules does not help. Vocabulary has, consequently, gained pop-\nularity in the general field of English language teaching and\nlearning, and research in second language lexical acquisition,\nretention, and instruction has increased (Coady & Huckin,\nDuring the previous decades, the area of language learning\nand teaching has also been marked with the attempts to make\nAutonomy is believed to be the essence of language acquisi-\ntion which can help language learners take charge of their\nown learning (Little, 2007). One way through which language\nlearners can become autonomous is to help them use lan-\nguage learning strategies (LLS) (Zarei & Elekaie, 2012).\nLLSs are a set of conscious or semi-conscious thoughts and\nbehavior which are used by language learners to facilitate\ntheir learning process (Cohen & Dornyei, 2002). Vocabulary\nlearning strategies (VLS) are also a part of LLSs which are\ndefined by Gu (2003) as those behavior and actions used by\nlanguage learners to use and to know vocabulary items.\nThe present study is, therefore, an attempt to explore the\nIranian EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners' and\nteachers' beliefs about the usefulness of different types of\nVLSs and to examine the effects of level of education on\ntheir strategy preference.\n1University of Isfahan, Iran\nCorresponding Author:\nMohammad Amiryousefi, Assistant Professor, University of Isfahan,\nIsfahan, Iran.\nEmail: M.Amiryousefi@Yahoo.com\nIranian EFL Learners' and Teachers'\nBeliefs About the Usefulness of\nVocabulary Learning Strategies\nMohammad Amiryousefi1\n Keywords\nvocabulary learning strategies, belief, social-cognitive theory, levels of education\n2 SAGE Open\nVLS\nAlthough research on VLSs has been done for several\ndecades, the field has not been able to form a common and\nunified definition of what the term exactly means. Various\nauthors and researchers (Catalan, 2003; Cohen & Dornyei,\nVLSs differently. Nation (2001), for example, believes that\nVLSs are a part of LLSs which need to\n1) involve choice. That is, there are several strategies to choose\nfrom, 2) be complex. That is, there are several steps to learn, 3)\nrequire knowledge and benefit from training, 4) increase the\nefficiency of vocabulary learning and vocabulary use. (p. 352)\nCohen and Dornyei (2002), however, believe that VLSs\ninvolve memorizing, recalling, reviewing, and using vocab-\nulary items. Catalan (2003) also believes that VLSs are\nthose actions which are taken by language learners to find\nout the meaning of the words, to send them to their long-\nterm memory which is, based on Schmitt (2010), the ulti-\nmate goal of vocabulary learning, to recall and to use the\nwords when needed. Takac (2008), however, believes that\nVLSs are those strategies which are solely used for vocabu-\nlary learning tasks.\nIn spite of the differences in definitions, almost all\nresearchers believe that studying VLSs can give teachers and\nresearchers useful insights. First, by exploring VLSs used by\ndifferent language learners, useful information can be\nobtained regarding the cognitive, social, and affective pro-\ncesses involved in vocabulary learning (Chamot, 2001).\nSecond, by exploring the VLSs used by successful learners a\nlist of useful strategies can be prepared to be taught to less\nsuccessful language learners to help and support them in\ntheir language learning process (H. D. Brown, 2014). Third,\nby exploring the beliefs and attitudes of language learners\nabout different VLSs, useful information can be obtained\nabout their desired and expected behavior and actions\n(Schmitt, 2010). Learners' expectations and desires have big\nimpacts on their learning behavior because, according to\nSchmitt (2010), if language learners do not value specific\nbehavior and actions, they will not have the needed motiva-\ntion which is the very first step in the language learning pro-\ncess. Fourth, Tseng, Dornyei, and Schmitt (2006) believe\nthat VLSs are the ways through which language learners can\nbe empowered to be more self-directed in their learning. By\nexploring the beliefs and attitudes about different VLSs or by\ngetting information about the whats and hows of VLSs,\nteachers can raise their awareness about what works for and\nwhat works against their learners (H. D. Brown, 2014).\nFinally, research has shown that students from different cul-\ntural, linguistic, and educational backgrounds do not benefit\nthat culture plays an important role in vocabulary learning\nand VLS use. Language learners from different cultures may\nfind different VLSs useful (Schmitt, 2000). By exploring the\nbeliefs and perceptions of language learners about different\nVLSs, teachers will know what strategies to focus on.\nVLS Classifications\nDifferent taxonomies and classifications of VLSs are avail-\nable in the literature of vocabulary learning and teaching\nVLS, for example, consists of three major parts: (a) direct\napproach, (b) indirect approach, and (c) mnemonics. Direct\napproach contains strategies such as saying or writing the\nwords several times and putting the words on cards which\ndirect language learners' attention to vocabulary items them-\nselves. Indirect approach, however, contains those strategies\nsuch as reading a text and trying to make sense of it which\nfocus learners' attention to language learning tasks rather\nthan individual vocabulary items. Mnemonics also contain\nstrategies such as grouping the words and relating them to a\npicture which are used to retain the words in the memory.\ngies which can be divided into two broad categories, namely,\ndiscovery strategies which are used to discover the meaning\nof the words and consolidation strategies which are used to\nretain them. Schmitt's (1997) taxonomy is believed to be the\nmost comprehensive one because it is specifically prepared\nfor vocabulary learning, and there is little overlap between\nthe classifications of the strategies (Akbari & Tahririan,\nVLSs makes a difference between aspects of vocabulary\nknowledge, sources of vocabulary knowledge, and learning\nrefer to what is involved in knowing a word such as its writ-\nten and spoken forms, sources of vocabulary knowledge\nrefer to the context in which the word is used and learning\nprocesses refer to those actions that lead to the learning and\nretention of the given words. His taxonomy, therefore, con-\nsists of three major parts, namely, planning strategies which\nare used to choose what to focus on, source strategies which\nare used to find information about words, and process strate-\ngies which are used to establish vocabulary knowledge.\nKlapper (2008), however, divides VLSs into the strategies\nwhich are used in explicit learning of vocabulary and those\nwhich are used in implicit vocabulary learning. Strategies\nsuch as analyzing vocabulary items, using cards, or keeping\nvocabulary notebooks are used in implicit learning, whereas\nstrategies such as listening to stories, watching movies, or\nreading stories are the ones used in implicit learning. Tran\nto study the Vietnamese EFL teachers' perceptions about\nvocabulary learning and teaching. His taxonomy contains 68\nitems which are also divided into two main parts, namely,\ndiscovery strategies and consolidation strategies. The dis-\ncovery part has strategies such as leafing through the diction-\nary to learn words and asking the teacher for an L1 translation\nAmiryousefi 3\nwhich can help language learners to discover the meaning of\nthe words. The consolidation part, however, has strategies\nsuch as using scales for gradable adjectives and using mne-\nmonic devices which can be helpful in consolidating the\nmeaning of the learned items.\nThe Importance of Students' and\nTeachers' Beliefs\nfield of language teaching and learning has shown that stu-\ndents' and teachers' beliefs about the nature of language and\nlanguage learning and teaching affect their pedagogical prac-\ntices in the classroom. It is believed that beliefs affect stu-\ndents' and teachers' autonomy and success in language\nlearning and teaching, and underlie all choices they make.\nDifferences in beliefs can, therefore, make students' and\nteachers' approach a learning task differently despite their\nsimilarities in language proficiency and level of education.\nBeliefs also influence students' and teachers' personal attri-\nbutes such as anxiety and motivation (Riley, 2009). Nation\nand Macalister (2010) believe that what teachers and stu-\ndents do is determined by their beliefs. In the same fashion,\nPhipps and Borg (2009) believe that students' and teachers'\nbeliefs act as a filter through which all practices and experi-\nences are passed and interpreted. The social-cognitive theory\nalso states that a student or a teacher's behavior, learning,\nand actions are products of a continuous interaction between\ncognitive, behavioral, and contextual factors. That is, a stu-\ndent or a teacher's behavior, actions, and learning or teaching\nare shaped by factors such as the reinforcements experienced\nby himself or herself and/or by other's beliefs, perceptions,\nand interpretation of the task and context (Bembenutty &\nlearners' use of LLSs in general and VLSs in particular is,\nconsequently, affected by factors such as their own and their\nclassmates' and teachers' beliefs about their usefulness and\neffectiveness. Beliefs are, nevertheless, considered to be\ndynamic and may change over time or may change as teach-\ners' and students' factors such as level of education change\nRiley (2009), however, believes that if teachers' and stu-\ndents' beliefs are consistent with each other, there will be a\nsupportive atmosphere in the classroom which will enhance\nthe quality of learning and teaching. Otherwise, there will be\na clash and lack of understanding between the teachers and\nthe students which may lead to dissatisfaction (Rashidi &\nteachers' beliefs about different aspects of language teaching\nand learning can, therefore, provide valuable information\nabout what practices and tasks are considered useful by\nteachers and students to be included and what differences\nexist between their beliefs to be taken into account.\nThe Purpose of the Present Study\nUnder the umbrella of social-cognitive theory (Bembenutty\nstates that beliefs and thoughts are powerful and can affect\nhuman beings' behavior and functioning and with regard to\nthe importance attached to the role of LLSs in making lan-\nguage learners autonomous (Zarei & Elekaie, 2012), the\nvalue credited to the role of vocabulary in language learning\nand the role of culture in vocabulary learning and VLS use\nexplore the Iranian EFL learners' and teachers' beliefs about\nthe usefulness of different types of VLSs. The present study,\ntherefore, addresses the following research questions:\nResearch Question 1: What are the most useful VLSs in\nthe Iranian EFL learners' and teachers' opinions?\nResearch Question 2: Does the level of education affect\nthe participants' beliefs about the usefulness of VLSs?\nThe Study\nThe Participants\nThe sample of the study included 392 participants comprising\n320 students and 72 English teachers. The participants of the\nstudy were English learners and teachers of four big and\nfamous institutes (Iran Language Institute, Pouyesh, Gouyesh,\nand Iranian Academic Center for Education, Culture and\nResearch (ACECR) in Isfahan, Iran. The students participated\nin this study were learning English in different levels from\nelementary to advanced at the adults' departments of these\ninstitutes in the spring semester of 2014. Their age ranged\nfrom 16 to 43, and their degrees ranged from high school\ndiploma to PhD. The majority of the teachers were also\nfemale. Their age ranged from 21 to 58, and they had different\ndegrees in English from BA to PhD. Table 1 shows the char-\nacteristics of the participants of the study.\nThe Instrument\nTo elicit the required data, a 5-point Likert-type scale ques-\ntionnaire was used. The VLS questionnaire was developed\nbased on the questionnaire used by Tran (2011) to study the\nVietnamese teachers' beliefs about vocabulary learning and\nteaching. The original questionnaire contained 63 items which\nwere divided into two broad categories of discovery strategies\nand consolidation strategies. Based on the characteristics of\nthe Iranian EFL learners, teachers, and teaching and learning\ncontext, it was, however, reduced to 54 items, and some of the\nitems were also reworded. The anchor points for the existing\nitems ranged from 1 = very useless to 5 = very useful. It was\nalso divided into discovery strategies with 15 items and con-\nsolidation strategies with 39 items. Discovery part of the ques-\ntionnaire contained strategies such as checking the meaning of\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 3. The Reliability Statistics of the Questionnaire.\nPosition Cronbach's  n of items\nthe words in a bilingual or monolingual dictionary and guess-\ning the meaning of the unknown words which can be used by\nlanguage learners to arrive at the meaning of the words, while\nconsolidation part contained strategies such as writing words\ndown or saying them aloud several times to remember them,\nreviewing the words, and relating the words to personal expe-\nriences or pictures which are used to consolidate their mean-\ning. Based on J. D. Brown's (2001) suggestion to minimize the\nmeasurement errors, the questionnaire was translated into\nFarsi, the participants' native language and the Farsi format\nwas given to the participants.\nThe final format was reviewed by six experienced teach-\ners and scholars, and based on their validation necessary\nchanges were made. To check the validity of the question-\nnaire, factor analysis with varimax rotation was also used. As\nshown in Table 2, the Kaiser\u00adMeyer\u00adOlkin (KMO) is bigger\negies fit into the two main tentative factors as originally\nhypothesized (i.e., discovery and consolidation strategies).\nIt was also given to a group of 32 English teachers and 69\nEnglish learners which were comparable with the partici-\npants of the study to explore its reliability and the following\nresults were obtained. As shown in Table 3, is bigger than .7\nfor both the students and the teachers, which shows the reli-\nability of the instrument used.\nResults\nThe data were prepared for analysis and then analyzed using\nthe statistical package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version\n16. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the responses\nto the items available in the questionnaire. For the sake of\nsimplicity and space, the responses of the students and teach-\ners to each part of the questionnaire are summarized in Table\n4. The first column of Table 4 (ranks) presents Likert-type\nscale values (from very useless to very useful), and the\nnumbers in the next columns show the percent of the stu-\ndents and teachers who selected those scales for each part.\nAs shown in Table 4, around 89% of the students and 87%\nof teachers had selected either useful or very useful for the\nitems available in the discovery part of the questionnaire,\nand around 87% of the students and 88% of the teachers had\nselected useful or very useful for the items available in the\nconsolidation part. Generally speaking, the results show that\nthe majority of the participants believed that both discovery\nand consolidation strategies are useful in vocabulary learn-\ning. These results are, however, too general and belong to\nthose participants who had selected one of the anchor points\nof very useless, useless, useful, and very useful. The rest who\nhad not responded or had selected \"no idea\" were excluded\nin the calculation of the general percent of each part of the\nquestionnaire. The details about the most valued strategies\nare, however, presented in the following parts.\nThe Most Useful Strategies\nTo extract the most useful strategies in the participants' opin-\nions, the frequency of the responses to each item of the ques-\ntionnaire was calculated. The items for which at least 60% of\nthe respondents had selected the anchor points of useful or\nvery useful were marked as the most useful and the rest were\ndiscarded. Finally, 6 discovery and 20 consolidation strate-\ngies remained for the students, and 8 discovery and 25 con-\nsolidation strategies remained for the teachers. The results are\nshown in the following tables. Numbers 1 to 5 used in the\ntables, respectively, show 1 = very useless, 2 = useless, 3 = no\nidea, 4 = useful, 5 = very useful, and the numbers used under\nthem show the percent of the teachers and the students who\nselected each of these anchor points. The letter \"M\" stands for\nthe mean and \"SD\" for the standard deviation of the responses\nto the items listed. As it is clear, the teachers and the students\ndid not agree on the usefulness of several strategies.\nTable 5 shows the results for those discovery strategies\nwhich were rated as the most useful by both the students and\nteachers. As shown in Table 5, both the teachers and the stu-\ndents believed that strategies such as paying attention to the\nfunction, suffixes and prefixes of the words, using monolin-\ngual dictionaries, guessing the meaning of the words and\nasking the teacher to use the words in English sentences, or\ngive synonyms for them can be useful in discovering their\nmeaning.\nTable 6, however, shows those strategies which were\nrated as the most useful only by the teachers. The teachers,\nunlike the students, believed that if the learners try to link\nTable 1. The Participants' Characteristics.\nTeachers Students\nEducation BA to PhD Diploma to PhD\nTable 2.

The majority of the students did not, however, think so.\nTable 7, on the other hand, shows the most useful consoli-\ndation strategies in both the teachers' and students' opinions.\nAs stated earlier, these strategies can be used to consolidate\nthe meaning of the learned vocabulary elements. As shown\nin Table 7, both the teachers and the students believed that\nstrategies such as using the words in interactions, learning\nthe words in sentences, checking the pronunciation of the\nwords, repeating the words, listening to English music, and\nwatching English movies can be useful in consolidating the\nmeaning of the words and sending them to long-term mem-\nory for future use.\nTable 8, however, contains those consolidation strategies\nwhich were rated only by the teachers as the most useful\nstrategies to be used to consolidate the meaning of the already\nlearned vocabulary elements.

As shown in Table 9, they believed that, along with the\nstrategies listed in Table 7, memorizing the newly learned\nvocabulary items can also be a useful practice in consoli-\ndating their meaning. However, the majority of the teachers\ndid not believe that memorization can be a useful activity in\nthis regard.\nThe Iranian EFL learners and teachers did not, neverthe-\nless, believe in the usefulness of mnemonic strategies such as\nthe key-word method and the loci method which have a long-\nstanding position in the literature.\nThe Effect of Educational Level on Strategy\nPreference\nTo examine the effects of level of education on the strategy\npreference, at first the participants were divided into differ-\nent groups based on the degrees they held. Accordingly, the\nteachers were divided into three groups: (a) BA, (b) MA, and\n(c) PhD, and the students into four groups: (a) diploma, (b)\nassociate degree, (c) BA, and (d) MA and higher. The reason\nwhy the students with MA and PhD degrees were classified\ninto one group was that only a very small number (3) of the\nstudents had a PhD degree. Then the Kruskal\u00adWallis Test\n18.

The Results of the Kruskal\u00adWallis Test Used for the Students.\nLevel of education Mean Rank Strategy 1 Mean Rank Strategy 2 Mean Rank Strategy 3\nwas used due to the nonexistence of normality in the data to\nmeasure the effects of level of education on the students' and\nteachers' strategy preference. The results of the Kruskal\u00ad\nWallis Test used for the teachers showed that for all 54 items\navailable in the VLS questionnaire the p values were bigger\nthan .05 showing that there was not a meaningful difference\nbetween the responses of the teachers in the three groups to\nthe items available in the VLS questionnaire.\nHowever, as shown in Table 10, the results of the Kruskal\u00ad\nWallis Test used for the students suggested that for the con-\nsolidation strategies (a) trying to use the words in interactions;\n(b) associating the word with its word coordinates, for\ninstance, apple is associated with peach, orange . . .; and (c)\nreviewing the vocabulary section of the textbook the p values\n.05 representing a meaningful difference between the\nresponses of the students in the four groups to these items.\nAn inspection of the mean ranks showed (Table 10) that\nfor Strategy Number 1, the mean rank of the students with an\nassociate degree was 71.94, which was the highest. The fre-\nquency of the responses of the students in different groups to\nthe options available for this strategy also showed that all the\nstudents (100%) with an associate degree had selected the\nanchor points of useful or very useful indicating that in these\nstudents'opinions trying to use the newly learned vocabulary\nelements in interactions can be a very good practice to con-\nsolidate their meaning. This strategy was also selected as one\nof the most useful consolidation strategies in both the teach-\ners' and the students' opinions (Table 7).\nFor Strategy Number 2, the highest rank, as shown in\nMA or higher. The frequency of the students' responses to\nthe options available for this strategy showed that around\n50% of these students had selected either useful or very use-\nful showing that about half of these students believed that\nassociating a word with its word coordinates can help them\nconsolidate its meaning. The majority of the students in other\ngroups had either no idea regarding the usefulness of this\nstrategy or selected useless or very useless.\nThe highest rank for Strategy Number 3 was 64.26 which\nbelonged to the students with a BA degree. The frequency of\nthe responses of the students with a BA degree to this item\nshowed that around 85% of them had selected useful or very\nuseful for this strategy. As indicated in Table 7, this strategy\nwas also selected as one of the most useful consolidating\nstrategies in both the teachers' and the students' opinions.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nFrom the last half of the 20th century on, the field of language\nteaching and learning has been marked with the efforts to\nshift the attentions from teacher-centered classes to learner-\ncentered ones. To this end, terms such as autonomy, aware-\nness-raising, and self-regulation have made their way into the\nfield (H.D. Brown, 2014). In learner-centered classes, the\nemphasis is on making the learners independent and self-reg-\nulated. To do so, learners should become strategic learners,\nthat is, they should be instructed to use LLSs (Schmitt, 2010).\nTeachers'and students'thoughts, perceptions, and beliefs are,\nhowever, important forces that can have great effects on the\ndecisions they make and the pedagogical practices they use.\nTeachers' and students' actions, decisions, and functioning\nare, therefore, sifted through their thoughts and beliefs\n(Bembenutty & White, 2013; Kitsantas & Zimmerman,\n2009). Exploring their beliefs about different aspects of lan-\nguage teaching and learning can provide useful insights about\nthe processes involved. It can also raise teachers' and learn-\ners' awareness about what works and what does not (H.D.\nThe present study was, therefore, an effort to explore the\nIranian EFL teachers' and learners' beliefs about the useful-\nness of different types of VLSs and to examine the effects of\nlevel of education on their strategy preference. The results of\nthe study showed that the students valued 6 discovery strate-\ngies (e.g., paying attention to the function of the word in the\nsentence, paying attention to the prefixes and suffixes, and\nguessing the meaning of the words) and 19 consolidation strat-\negies (e.g., using the words in interactions, connecting the\nwords to their synonyms and antonyms, and imagining the\nmeaning of the words). The teachers also believed that these\nstrategies were useful for vocabulary learning except for\nmemorizing the words which was believed to be useful only\nby the students as a consolidation strategy. The teachers, how-\never, valued 2 more discovery strategies (linking the English\nword to a Farsi one that reminds the learners of the English\nword's form and meaning, and analyzing the available pictures\nAmiryousefi 9\nand clues) and 6 more consolidation strategies (e.g., connect-\ning the word meaning to a personal experience, using flash\ncards and keeping a vocabulary notebook) for which the stu-\ndents did not show a high esteem. The results of Kruskal\u00ad\nWallis Test also showed that the teachers' beliefs about the\nusefulness of different VLSs were not affected by their level of\neducation. However, the preference for a few strategies dif-\nfered across levels of education for the students.\nBy considering the strategies which were valued by the\nparticipants of the study, it can be inferred that for the Iranian\nEFL teachers and learners: (a) Paying attention to the form of\nvocabulary items is considered to be important in both dis-\ncovering the meaning of the words and consolidating them.\nIt can be seen in strategies such as paying attention to the\ngrammatical functions of the words, analyzing the word\naffixes or considering them, and paying attention to the spell-\ning and the spoken form of the words; (b) mechanical activi-\nties such as repeating the words, saying them aloud, or\nwriting them down several times are also deemed essential;\n(c) the context is very important both during the first encoun-\nter with the words to understand their meaning and during\nthe time the learners try to retain them; (d) guessing the\nmeaning from the context and paying attention to the word\nrelations can also promote vocabulary learning; and (e)\nvocabulary production has also an important place. It can be\ndone through activities such as linking the new words in a\nstory or using them in the interactions with peers and teach-\ners. Strategy preference may, however, be affected by learn-\ners' factors such as level of education.\nThe results of the present study can further support the\nimportance of context, word lists, semantic relation among\nwords, guessing the meaning of words from context, and\nvocabulary production in vocabulary learning and retention\nwhich are also proved useful by the studies done in the litera-\nof the present study do not support the results of the studies\nwho found that L1 can be facilitative in vocabulary learning,\nand bilingual dictionaries can provide students with useful\ninformation. The present study, on the contrary, showed that\nthe majority of the Iranian EFL teachers and learners\nexpressed hesitancy to use translation activities and tasks, L1\nequivalents, and English to Farsi dictionaries for vocabulary\nlearning. Also, the majority of the participants did not agree\non the usefulness of mnemonic devices such as the key-word\nmethod and the loci method which have a long-standing\nposition in the literature of vocabulary learning and teaching\nand are believed to contribute to vocabulary learning and\nretention (Amiryousefi & Ketabi, 2011; Sagarra & Alba,\n2006). It can be due to the cultural factors which are believed\nto have an important role in VLS use (Schmitt, 2000). The\nresults of the present study can, to some extent, support the\nfact that beliefs are dynamic and the changes in the learners'\nand teachers' attributes such as the level of education may\nresult in a change in their beliefs about different aspects of\nlanguage learning and teaching (Barcelos & Kalaja, 2011;\nAs the results of the present study suggest, teachers should\nbe cognizant of the fact that their beliefs do not always match\ntheir students' beliefs. Teachers and students are, conse-\nquently, recommended to articulate their educational beliefs.\nIn this way, teachers can raise their awareness about their\nstudents' accurate and inaccurate beliefs about all aspects of\nlanguage learning and teaching in general and about vocabu-\nlary learning and teaching in particular. It can help teachers\njustify their educational practices which in their students'\nopinions are not useful or logical to stimulate satisfaction\nand cooperation in their students and hence increase the\nquality of teaching and learning (H.
