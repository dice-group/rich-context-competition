Previous research on ad-\nverse childhood experiences (including abuse) documented\nthat a greater number of childhood adversities are associated\nwith higher risk of all-cause mortality.18,19 The only previous\nstudy that we are aware of that focused on childhood abuse\nfound no greater risk of mortality in adults abused as chil-\ndren; however, the sample was in their 20s and 30s at\nfollow-up.13 Toourknowledge,thisstudyrepresentsoneofthe\nfirst efforts to investigate the effects of reported childhood\nabuseonlong-termriskofmortality(20years)inalargesample\nof midlife adults (mean age of 47 years, with the oldest being\n74 years at baseline).\nThis study also tested whether different types of re-\nported childhood abuse would be associated with adult mor-\ntality. Previous research has been mixed, sometimes finding\nassociations between physical abuse and health,11 other times\nfinding relationships for emotional abuse,15 or sometimes\nboth.7,12 In this study, we tested associations with 3 different\ntypes of self-reports of abuse (emotional, moderate physical,\nand severe physical abuse) as well as whether the accumula-\ntion of types of reported abuse were associated with adult\nall-cause mortality.\nLast, we investigated sex differences based on previous lit-\nerature that observed abuse effects specifically in female\nare also evident in animal models.21 In addition, we tested\nwhetherourself-reportmeasureofchildhoodabusemightsim-\nply be acting as a proxy for other factors also associated with\nearly mortality, including low childhood socioeconomic sta-\ntus, personality variables (neuroticism or conscientious-\nness), or depression, by testing whether associations be-\ntween reported childhood abuse and adult mortality risk\nremained after statistical adjustment for these variables.\nMethods\nParticipants\nData for this study come from the national survey of Midlife\nDevelopment in the United States,22 a national sample of 7108\nnoninstitutionalized, English-speaking adults (ages 25-74\nyears).

We then conducted regression analyses\nseparately for men and women with different sets of co-\nvariates.

That is, in women, reported severe physical abuse\nassociated with all-cause mortality. In contrast, in men,\ntic = 2.76; P = .10); and types of abuse (Wald statis-\ntic = 4.997; P = .08) were not significantly associated with\nall-cause mortality.\nDiscussion\nThis is the first study that we are aware of to link self-reports\nof childhood abuse to mortality in adult women. Women who\nreported experiencing severe physical abuse, moderate\nphysical abuse, or emotional abuse from a parent were at\nincreased risk for all-cause mortality during the 20-year\nfollow-up period, compared with women who did not report\nsuch experiences. These associations did not appear to be\nspecific to any type of reported abuse, although an accumu-\nlation of more types of abuse was associated with a greater\nrisk of all-cause mortality in women. Furthermore, these\nfindings could not be explained by childhood socioeco-\nnomic status, adult depression, or personality traits. There\nwere no associations between reports of abuse and mortal-\nity in men.\nThis study's findings are consistent with previous litera-\nture that has demonstrated links between childhood physi-\nbut extends this pattern to all-cause mortality. Because of the\nolder age of our sample, if these reports are accurate, they\nsuggest that mortality effects may be less likely to be a\ndirect result of the abuse itself or suicide (more common in\nadolescents and young adults) and instead more likely\nowing to chronic diseases (the leading causes of death in\nmidlife and older adults, http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars\n/leadingcauses.html).\nWhy would abuse during childhood continue to have\nlong-term effects into adulthood that culminate in greater\nmortality risk? One explanation is that abuse heightens vul-\nnerability to psychiatric conditions (eg, depression) that in\nturn contribute to disease morbidity and mortality.32,33\nTable 2.

User on 08/19/2016\n \nAlthough we did not find support for this hypothesis, a\nstudy with more regular and thorough assessments of psy-\nchopathology is needed to definitively address this issue.\nAnother explanation is that children who experience abuse\nmay develop negative health behaviors (eg, drug use) as a\nway of coping with stress, and these detrimental behaviors\nmay then contribute to preventable disease morbidity and\nmortality.5,33,34 Obesity and its sequelae (eg, diabetes) could\nbe another possible pathway between childhood abuse and\nmortality. Another possibility is that childhood adversities\nbecome biologically embedded, calibrating how biological\nsystems operate across the lifespan. For example, adverse\nchildhood experiences may program the response tenden-\ncies of immune cells in ways that perpetuate chronic inflam-\nmatory states that in turn heighten risk for cardiovascular\nand other chronic diseases of aging.35\nOur findings further indicate that both reports of physi-\ncal and emotional childhood abuse are associated with all-\ncause mortality later in life. These findings are consistent with\nprevious studies7,12 that suggest that both the physical harm\nthat comes from abuse as well as the emotional harm that\ncomes from abuse that is psychological in nature can have im-\nplications for health outcomes.\nIn addition, the more types of abuse reported in child-\nhood, the greater a woman's risk of all-cause mortality is as\nan adult. This finding is consistent with previous literature\non adverse childhood experiences, where a greater number\nof childhood adversities (eg, parent divorce and/or parent\nmental illness) is associated with both morbidity (eg, heart\ndisease and/or respiratory diseases) and mortality outcomes\nFindings in this study were evident for women but not\nmen. This pattern is consistent with other research that has\nunclear why women might be more vulnerable to the effects\nof abuse than men. One biological explanation could be that\ncharacteristics that are differentially prevalent in women vs\nmen (eg, excessive release of steroid hormones in response\nto stress21) and that are also linked to health outcomes may\nhelp explain sex differences in abuse-mortality relation-\nships. Psychologically, it may also be that men and women\nhave different coping strategies for dealing with adversities\nsuch as abuse and that men's, on average, may be more pro-\ntective for their long-term health.\nA major limitation of this study is the retrospective\nassessment of childhood abuse. While we have interpreted\nthese findings as indicative of an effect of childhood abuse\nexposure on later-life mortality, we must caution that the\nretrospective and self-reported nature of the abuse measure\nmeans that other explanations are always possible and that\nthese reports may not necessarily be an accurate representa-\ntion of what happened in these participants' childhoods.\nFor example, there have been questions raised about the\nvalidity of retrospective reports36,37 based on observations\nTable 3.

User on 08/19/2016\n \nthat (1) the concordance between objectively verified abuse\nand self-reports of abuse are not that high; (2) there is insta-\nbility in self-reports of abuse over time; and (3) people may\nbe hesitant to endorse sensitive experiences such as abuse\nin self-report questionnaires, leading to underreporting.\nThese are important limitations to acknowledge and cer-\ntainly apply to this study. That said, there are a number of\nreasons why we believe that this study still makes an impor-\ntant contribution to the literature. First, in studies inter-\nested in mortality during midlife to later life, it would be\nvery difficult to have an assessment of abuse during child-\nhood because this would require a longitudinal sample fol-\nlowed up for more than half a century. While there are some\nimpressive cohorts that have been following up children\nwho experienced abuse for decades,13,38 until these samples\nreach older adulthood, we may need to rely on retrospective\nreports of childhood abuse in mortality studies. Second,\nissues of bias are large in studies where participants are also\nself-reporting on outcomes (eg, psychiatric conditions)\nbecause the potential for these outcomes to influence\nreports of abuse cannot be overlooked. However, this\nstudy's focus was mortality that was verified by the\nNational Death Index, an outcome not subject to reporting\nbiases. Third, people's memories of whether an event has\noccurred is typically better than their recall of the timing of\nthat event,37 and our study focused on occurrence rather\nthan timing of childhood abuse. Fourth, a review of the lit-\nerature on recall of childhood adversities found that posi-\ntive reports of abuse having happened are likely to be cor-\nrect (the major validity concern is about not reporting), that\nreports are more likely to be accurate if they do not rely on\njudgment or interpretation, and that a rejection of all stud-\nies that involve retrospective recall of childhood abuse is\nunwarranted.37 Other limitations of this study include the\nfact that the Midlife Development in the United States sur-\nvey did not contain information about sexual abuse or about\nthe age at which child abuse happened, both of which\nwould be important in future studies. Also, we note that the\noccurrence of different types of abuse may overlap substan-\ntially with one another, creating difficulties statistically\nwith detecting the unique effects of any particular type of\nabuse. Finally, another limitation is that the Midlife Devel-\nopment in the United States study does not contain infor-\nmation about cause-specific mortality.\nTable 4.
