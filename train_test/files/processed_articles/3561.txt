Experiences of social discrimina-\ntion have been associated with numerous deleterious health\noutcomes, including heightened activity of the hypothala-\nmus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA), poorer cardiovascular\nfunctioning (Pascoe and Smart Richman, 2009), and poorer\nphysical health outcomes (e.g. Clark et al., 1999; Coogan\net al., 2014). Moreover, the physical symptoms linked to\ndiscrimination have been characterized as chronic stress\n(Clark et al., 1999). These findings have led to the hypoth-\nesis that chronic discrimination experiences can produce a\nsufficient level of chronic physiological stress in individu-\nals to produce changes in the HPAA and health outcomes\nDiscrimination has been established as a chronic stressor\nand influential on alterations in HPAAfunctioning, although\nnot all findings are consistent; inconsistencies can be found\ndepending on the cortisol measurement and the severity of\nthe stressor. For example, in a meta-analysis by Miller et al.\n(2007), great variability was found in cortisol reactivity,\ndepending on the timing of the cortisol assessment or the\nindividual's appraisal. Broadly, it was found that acute\nstressors may be associated with HPAA hyper-reactivity,\nwhereas chronic stressors may be associated with HPAA\nhypo-reactivity, particularly when responsiveness is\nassessed at later time points. Yet inconsistencies remain in\nthe literature, given the variability discussed above and the\nmatrix for cortisol, that is, whether sampling saliva, urine, or\nWhen assessing the influence of discrimination or rac-\nism on HPAA functioning, several studies which examined\ndiurnal profiles with salivary cortisol have found that\nAfrican-Americans revealed flatter diurnal cortisol as com-\npared to White participants (e.g. Hajat et al., 2010; Martin\nsuggestive of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) dys-\nregulation, which has been associated with poor health out-\ncomes (e.g. Skinner et al., 2011).

(2012) investigated discrimi-\nnation-related stress in a sample of Mexican-American ado-\nlescents. Using salivary cortisol assessments to measure\ndiurnal and awakening responses, they found that perceived\ndiscrimination was associated with greater overall cortisol\noutput (area under the curve (AUC) and a nearly significant\nincrease in the cortisol-awakening response (CAR) (p < .08).\nIn another study of adolescents, Huynh et al. (2016) found\nthat greater everyday discrimination was associated with\ngreater daily cortisol (AUC). These associations were not\nsignificantly different by race or sex of participants.\nHair cortisol\nDespite the vast amount of work on discrimination and\nHPAA reactivity and alterations, little work has yet investi-\ngated the potential association of hair cortisol concentra-\ntions (HCC) with this well-known chronic stressor: social\ndiscrimination. We used HCC as a biomarker of the cumu-\nlative secretion of cortisol into circulation over a 3-month\nperiod, which is now a well-established measure of HPAA\nactivity. This methodological approach offers many advan-\ntages over measurement of cortisol in other sample matri-\nces (for reviews, see Meyer and Novak, 2012; Russell et al.,\ninvasive, and samples can be collected in field or lab set-\ntings and stored in envelopes or vials until assayed (e.g. see\nnecessity of storing samples refrigerated or frozen, which is\nparticularly relevant given that the temporal distance from\nthe stressor can be an important factor in quantifying the\neffects of chronic stress on HPAA activity (Miller et al.,\n2007). Moreover, cortisol assessments using blood, sali-\nvary, or urinary samples have shown a high degree of intra-\nindividual variability. In contrast, recent studies found\nHCC to be relatively stable with high test\u00adretest associa-\ntions when samples were obtained two times over 1 year\nand three times over 2 months; test\u00adretest associations\nHCC measurement additionally holds promise as a nonin-\nvasive measure that is feasible to use with large sample\npopulations. Indeed, current application of the HCC meth-\nodology is a response to the call in the literature that multi-\nple approaches are needed to get a full picture on the\nrelationship between discrimination and its influence on\nstress systems (Juster et al., 2010). Furthermore, there is a\nrapidly progressing literature to explicate the neuroendo-\ncrine mechanisms underlying social stress and disease con-\nnections (for review, see Wosu et al., 2013).\nSeveral studies have examined the relationship between\nHCC and other long-term measures of cortisol secretion\n(for review see Russell et al., 2012). Specifically, positive\ncorrelations have been found between HCC and measures\nof diurnal HPA activity. For example, D'Anna-Hernandez\net al. (2011) found HCC and diurnal salivary cortisol area\nunder the curve with respect to ground (AUCg) were cor-\nrelated throughout pregnancy. In earlier work, Suave et al.\n(2007) found positive correlations between HCC, serum,\nand 24-hour urine cortisol measurements. These findings\nhave helped validate HCC as a useful biomarker of chronic\ncortisol secretion.\nPerceived discrimination and\nsubjective stress\nThis study used an established scale of lifetime discrimina-\ntion to assess the relationship to HCC. The lifetime dis-\ncrimination measure asks questions on structural perceived\ndiscrimination, perhaps where one's greater socioeconomic\nstatus (SES) upward mobility may have been curtailed\nestablished perceived stress scales were used to examine\nrelationships with both discrimination and HCC, including\npersonal perceived stress and home stress. Associations\nbetween perceived stress measures and HCC have been\ninconsistent in the HCC-related literature (see Wosu et al.,\nSubjective social status\nThe subjective social status (SSS) ladder (Operario et al.,\n2004) has been used extensively to assess perceived social\nstanding or status, as compared to objective measures (e.g.\nincome). Evidence has shown that SSS is associated with\npsychosocial factors and devaluation experiences more than\nobjective SES measures (e.g. Subramanyam et al., 2013).\nSSS has also been found to be inversely related to physical\nhealth outcomes such as resting heart rate, obesity, and\nhypertension (Singh-Manoux et al., 2005), after statistically\ncontrolling for objective SES measures. Moreover, Adler\net al. (2008), comparing the Whitehall II and Coronary\nArtery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) data,\nfound that higher objective SES may not confer the same\nbenefits to African-Americans as compared to other racial/\nethnic groups, suggesting that implicit negative biases may\nstill be operating in higher SES environments and that rac-\nism may influence the self-assessment of status.\nGiven that discrimination engages social devaluation\nand subjective status, we hypothesized that SSS would\nalso moderate the relationships between discrimination\nand the stress indicators such that higher status may not\nconfer the same benefit to high SES minorities reporting\nhigh discrimination.\nWhile the health-gradient literature shows stepwise\nhealth improvements with objective measures of SES, life\ncourse or generational improvements in social status are\nO'Brien et al. 3\nnot always accompanied by a parallel change in health out-\ncomes or decreased stress (e.g. Colen et al., 2006; O'Brien\net al., 2013), which raises questions about interactive\neffects arising from perceived status. In prior work with a\ndiverse urban population, we found that higher SES con-\nferred protection from both perceived stress and increased\nHCC among non-minorities but not among minorities\n(O'Brien et al., 2013). We conjectured that differences in\ndiscrimination could account for the minority group differ-\nence at the higher SES level.\nThis study was guided by the primary hypothesis that\nlifetime discrimination stress would be associated with\nchronically elevated HCC in a diverse sample. Given that\ntemporal differences between HCC and shorter-term meas-\nures of cortisol can differ by days and months, lifelong\nexperiences with adversity may be captured better with the\nlonger-term measure of HCC. We predicted that a unique\npattern would emerge in which reported lifetime discrimina-\ntion would be a better predictor of elevated HCC than per-\nceived stress. Finally, we investigated a potential moderator\nof the predicted discrimination-HCC association: subjective\nsocial status (i.e. the SSS ladder; Operario et al., 2004).\nThis study\nThis study was guided by the primary hypothesis that life-\ntime discrimination stress would be associated with chroni-\ncally elevated HCC in a diverse sample. Given that hair\ncortisol is arguably a better index of chronic HPAA activa-\ntion than shorter-term measures such as salivary cortisol,\nlifelong experiences with adversity may be captured better\nusing HCC. Finally, we investigated a potential moderator\nof the predicted discrimination-HCC association: subjec-\ntive social status (i.e. the SSS ladder; Operario et al., 2004).\nTo summarize the two major study goals: (1) Do lifetime\ndiscrimination experiences predict (a) elevated HPAA\nactivity as measured by HCC and (b) perceived stress indi-\ncators and (2) Are the relationships between lifetime dis-\ncrimination and HCC moderated by the SSS ladder.\nMethod\nParticipants and recruitment\nThe protocol was approved by the University of\nMassachusetts Boston (UMB) Institutional Review Board\nprior to recruitment. We recruited healthy adults from the\nUMB, an urban commuter campus, and through online com-\nmunity bulletin boards. The final sample included 180\nrace/ethnicity included 19.1 percent African-American/\n32.8 percent European/White. All participants provided\nwritten informed consent and were paid an honorarium of\nMeasures\nHair cortisol.Noting the scalp end, hair samples were\ntrimmed to 3 cm, weighed, and stored in standard polypro-\npylene test tubes at room temperature until assayed. Since\nhair grows approximately 1 cm per month, 3 cm is posited\nto capture retrospectively circulating cortisol for the past 3\nmonths. Hair samples weighing 21\u00ad195 mg were processed\nand analyzed for cortisol (as described in Meyer et al.,\n2012). Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were\n< 10 percent. Values were converted into pg/mg hair for\ndata analysis and presentation.\nLifetime discrimination. This 12-item scale assesses the life-\ntime frequency of discrimination experiences across multi-\nple domains including work, school, receiving services,\nand public life (adapted by adding one question referring\nto higher education advising, McNeilly et al., 1996; Wil-\nliams et al., 2009). For example, \"How many times in your\nlife were you discouraged by a teacher or advisor from\nseeking higher education?\" Respondents answer on a Lik-\nert scale from 0 to 4, where each anchor represents 1\u00ad2\ninstances. Respondents answered using similar anchors as\nabove and the same open item question. The possible range\nis 0\u00ad48 ( = .93). For the following measures, items were\nreverse scored such that higher total values reflect higher\nendorsement of the construct assessed. One additional\nitem was open and asked \"Why\" the participant felt that\nthey were discriminated (e.g. race/ethnicity, sex, weight,\nnativity, sexual orientation, or other as an open-ended\nresponse).\nPersonal perceived stress.The personal perceived stress\n(PSS) is a standard validated subjective stress measure,\nThe wording was modified to assess perceived stress over\nthe past 3 months.

Specifically, participants were presented an image\nof a ladder of 10 rungs and were asked to rate themselves in\n4 Health Psychology Open \nterms of their social standing in the community, where 1 is\nthe lowest and 10 is the highest rank.\nSocio-demographic\nAge and sex. Participants listed their age in years and their\nsex.\nPersonal income.\nPersonal income was obtained with\nsonal income was recoded into four categories where 1 =\nRace/ethnicity. Participants were selected from 13 race/eth-\nnic categories, which were recoded into four major ethno/\nheritage groups: African (African-American/Black,\nDominican, Haitian), Asian (Asian, Indian, Hawaiian,\nPacific Islander), European (European/White, Arab/Middle\nEastern), and Hispanic (Latino-Hispanic, Caribbean, Bra-\nzilian/Portuguese, Native-American), and other as an open\nresponse. Four race/ethnicity categories were constructed\nbased on respondent's selection of personal heritage group:\nAfrican, Asian, Latin-Hispanic, and European-American.\nHair treatment\nSix questions assessed the frequencies of hair washing and\nstyling treatments that may influence cortisol capture in the\nhair matrix. These include the frequency of washing, dye-\ning, and chemical treatments.\nMedications\nSix questions were asked about medications that poten-\ntially alter HPAA activity (e.g. corticosteroids, beta-block-\ners), as well as depression, anxiety, and hormones (e.g.\nbirth control).\nProcedure\nAfter obtaining written informed consent, the gloved exper-\nimenter clipped a 3-cm sample of hair from the posterior\nvertex for the HCC assay. Human hair grows approximately\n1 cm per month; therefore, the collection of 3 cm is posited\nto capture cortisol secretion retrospectively for the past 3\nmonths. Participants then completed the socio-demographic\nand perceived stress and discrimination surveys online via\nPsychData (State College, PA). Upon completion of sur-\nveys, participants were debriefed, paid, and thanked.\nResults\nData analyses\nInitial examination of the data revealed that HCC values\n(pg/mg) fell within a range that is consistent with hair cor-\ntisol findings from both clinical and non-clinical popula-\n19.16). However, assessment of normality by means of the\nShapiro\u00adWilk and Kolmogorov\u00adSmirnov tests showed that\nthe distribution was positively skewed; consequently, the\ndata were subjected to log-transformation for further analy-\nfrequencies of hair washing, dyeing, use of weave, or\nchemical treatments were singularly entered as covariates\nin the first step of HCC analyses. There were no significant\ndifferences in hair treatment or medication use on HCC lev-\nels (all ps n.s.) and, therefore, these were not included as\ncovariates in the remaining statistical models. Table 1\nshows the zero-order correlations, means, and standard\ndeviations of major variables.\nAnalytic plan\nUsing IBM's SPSS version 19 statistical software, hierar-\nchical linear regression modeling was used to assess\nwhether the dependent variables were predicted by per-\nceived discrimination experiences. Dependent measures\nincluded HCC and perceived stress. Independent variables\nincluded lifetime discrimination and the SSS ladder.\nSimple and moderation effects of subjective status were\nassessed by the following. In step 1, primary predictors\nwere entered, in step 2, the moderator variable was entered,\nand in step 3, interaction terms were entered. Independent\nvariables were centered prior to creating the interaction\nterm to control for multicollinearity (Aiken and West, 1991;\nassessed covariates by entering them simultaneously in step\n1. Moderation effects were examined using standard proce-\ndures outlined in Aiken and West (1991) and Baron and\nKenney (1986). Specifically, significant two-way interac-\ntions were probed via regression analyses that included a\nconditional moderator variable. Regression lines were then\nplotted based on the regression equations. Analysis of\ncovariance (ANCOVA) was used to examine simple and\ninteraction effects of race/ethnicity by discrimination on\nthe dependent measures.\nLifetime discrimination and social status\nThe first model produced a significant main effect of life-\ntime discrimination on HCC, after controlling for age and\nThere was no main effect of SSS and the interaction was\nn.s. In the next model, perceived stress was not predicted\nby lifetime discrimination, status, or the interaction term.\nO'Brien et al. 5\nIn the next model, lifetime discrimination predicted the\nR2 = .12**). There was also a main effect of social status\nthe interaction term was not significant (Figure 2).\nAn ANCOVA assessed the interaction between race/eth-\nnicity (4) by lifetime discrimination on HCC and perceived\nstress measures. There were no main effects, and the inter-\naction of race/ethnicity by lifetime discrimination was not\nsignificant for any other dependent measures, controlling\nfor sex and age.\nFinally, an omnibus analysis of variance (ANOVA) found\na trend, but no significant between-group differences in life-\ntime discrimination by race/ethnicity (p = .80). The preva-\nlence of lifetime discrimination experiences by race/ethnicity\nis presented in Table 2. Responses to the open-ended ques-\ntions about the perceived reason \"Why were you treated this\nway?\" for discrimination varied tremendously and included\nrace, sex, age, looks, and other attributions, but no clear pat-\ntern emerged.\nDiscussion\nThe results reported in this study support the primary\nhypothesis: discrimination experiences can lead to chroni-\ncally elevated cortisol in healthy young adults. This rela-\ntionship was found using HCC as a biomarker of chronic or\nrepeated HPA activity and a self-reported measure of dis-\ncrimination experience in a diverse sample in terms of race/\nethnicity and social class. The findings provide the first evi-\ndence of a positive association between frequency of self-\nreported lifetime discrimination experience and HCC. It is\nnotable that this association was not found for a daily dis-\ncrimination scale (Kessler et al., 1999), that was also\nadministered (data not shown), but only for the more cumu-\nlative and chronic experiences of discrimination. It would\nbe of interest to replicate this finding as well as examine\nHCC and other acute or short-term assessments of social\ndevaluation, such as microaggressions (e.g. Torres-Harding\net al., 2012). In addition, it would be of interest to examine\nthe relationship between cumulative concentrations of cor-\ntisol in hair with the disrupted diurnal dynamics of cortisol\nsecretion reported in association with perceived discrimi-\nnation in several recent studies (e.g. Thayer and Kuzawa,\nMeasurement of HCC is a compelling noninvasive\napproach for the physiological assessment of chronic stress,\nand the extant research using HCC is expanding rapidly\n(for reviews, see Meyer and Novak, 2012; Russell et al.,\n2012). The findings in this report indicate that it can also be\na useful tool for teasing out the additive and interactive\neffects of the multiple social stressors found in health dis-\nparity populations and thought to be consequential for more\nfrequent or earlier onset of various chronic diseases. The\nnow considerable literature has established HCC as a sta-\nble, reliable, and efficiently obtained biomarker of average\ncirculating cortisol over months. It can be obtained in a\nTable 1.

Race/ethnicity is coded 1\u00ad4, where 1 is African, 2 is Asian, 3 is Latin, and 4 is European-American.\nFigure 1.

Those highest in\nreported discrimination showed the highest cortisol, a measure\nof cortisol secretion retrospectively for approximately 3 months.\n6 Health Psychology Open \nsingle sample collected noninvasively that takes no more\nthan a few minutes to obtain, has few specific storage needs\n(e.g. can be stored in tin foil in a plastic bag), and can be\nrepeated over time with methodological ease. These fea-\ntures suit it well to further research aimed to understand\ninterrelations among chronic physiological stress, discrimi-\nnation, and other pervasive social stressors, neurobehavio-\nral pathways, and health outcomes.\nThe linkage between HCC and discrimination stress\nfound in this study provides further evidence to the broad\nliterature that has evinced physiological mechanisms under-\nlying the discrimination and poor health link. Perceived dis-\ncrimination has been associated in prior research with\npoorer cardiovascular, mental, and health outcomes (e.g.\n2008), and this has not always been race-based discrimina-\nIn this study, race/ethnicity did not interact with per-\nceived discrimination or subjective status to predict HCC\nor subjective stress and perceived lifetime discrimination\nwas reported by participants in all four of the major racial/\nethnic groups (Table 2). The lack of interaction effects may\nbe due to the diversity of the sample in both race/ethnicity\nand SES. For example, the present sample includes a\nrelatively low SES sample, with the lowest reported income\nand Massachusetts median incomes. The sample was also\n50 percent students who also work part-time or full time.\nHowever, there was evidence of differences in the perva-\nsiveness of discrimination across these race/ethnic groups;\nAfrican-Americans reported the highest levels of lifetime\ndiscrimination experiences (Table 2). Given the diversity of\nthis sample, in this first iteration investigating discrimina-\ntion and HCC, we did not primarily predict that discrimina-\ntion would always be race based. The open-ended questions\nrevealed enormous variability in \"Why\" participants felt\ndiscrimination; race was often reported with gender, sexual\norientation, or age. Other responses were ambiguous and\nincluded \"class,\" \"not enough,\" and \"religion.\" In future\nstudies, the open-ended response could be constrained to\ndisambiguate the reasons for perceived discrimination.\nThe complex pattern of social stress and status relation-\nships reported in the literature led us to examine protective\nfactors for the impact of lifetime discrimination stress on\noutcome measures. We hypothesized that social status\nwould have moderating effects, and this was confirmed\nwith the chaos variable (i.e. higher status was associated\nFigure 2. The left figure shows the mean of lifetime discrimination (+/- the mean) on Chaos in the home scale. Those highest in\nreported discrimination also reported the highest Chaos, compared to those in the lowest group. The right figure shows the mean\nof subjective status (+/- the mean) on Chaos. Those in the lowest report subjective status also reported the lowest, compared to\nthose reporting high status.\nTable 2. Prevalence of lifetime discrimination reported by self-reported race/ethnic heritage group.\nLifetime discrimination African Asian Latino European Total\nO'Brien et al. 7\nwith lower chaos in the home). It is important for under-\nstanding the complex interplay of these social variables and\nfor guiding the selection of interventions that the moderator\nhypotheses were supported. In addition, higher discrimina-\ntion was predictive of higher chaos, perhaps highlighting\npathways of stress experiences that can infuse other domains.\nQuestions for future research include other protective\nfactors that can be assessed experimentally and titrated to\nspecific discrimination stress, in order to specify the mod-\nerator's strengths and contextual constraints. The real world\nsignificance of this work supports the categorization of dis-\ncrimination as chronic stress.\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations that warrant discussion.\nFirst, our sample includes a relatively young sample of\ndiverse adults, ages between 18 and 30 years, and does not\ninclude long-term health outcomes or assessments of acute\nor chronic diseases. While we can merely assess discrimi-\nnation\u00adstress relationship as a potential risk for deleterious\nhealth later in life, this study focused primarily on one fac-\ntor of risk: elevated cortisol secretions in hair, which may\nbe prospective. Future studies could add measures specifi-\ncally associated with allostatic load and actual health out-\ncomes (e.g. chronic diseases) for a more complete picture.\nFurthermore, we did not examine objective SES (income)\nas a predictor or moderator, so these findings are independ-\nent of income in this sample. Future samples could recruit\ngreater variability in SES.\nThe coding of race/ethnicity was based on participant's\nselection of 13 groups as suggested by National Institutes\nof Health (NIH). Based on these reports, the race category\nwas constructed into four groups based on respondent's\nanswer to one question (primary heritage group; NIH,\n2017). Given a larger sample size, with a more focused\nrecruitment on specific race/ethnicity and variability in\nSES, one could investigate differences between related her-\nitage groups that also have vast cultural differences, as well\nas class, status, and discrimination experiences in the\nUnited States. For example, Vietnamese and Japanese indi-\nviduals could be examined as separate groups, rather than\ntogether as Asian.\nFinally, there are limits related to HCC that need to be\nconsidered (Meyer and Novak, 2012). Most importantly,\nmeasurement of hair cortisol does not capture details about\nthe dynamics of physiological stress response systems,\nsuch as extent and timing of the rise and recovery of corti-\nsol secretion during a stress response or diurnal patterning\nof HPA activity, which feed into the cumulated cortisol\nsum. These stress-related dynamics have downstream\neffects on cardiovascular and other homeostatic systems,\nwhich can result in \"wear and tear\" on the systems over\ntime (Wosu et al., 2013). Because of the limitations of the\nhair cortisol approach, we do not yet know whether the\nelevated HCC levels found in this study reflect higher base-\nline cortisol levels or increased responsiveness to daily\nstressful experiences (including those that are discrimina-\ntion related). For this reason, further research is needed to\ndefine more completely the nature of HPAA dysregulation\nin people who have suffered high levels of lifetime social\ndiscrimination.\nConclusion\nThe present findings add to the body of evidence indicat-\ning that discrimination is a chronic stressor influential\nenough to alter the HPA axis and related stress systems,\npotentially increasing the growing gap in health dispari-\nties. Moreover, these findings inform clinical intervention\nand social policy in that both discrimination and modera-\ntors of these specific stress effects need to be taken into\naccount in interventions designed to reduce health dispari-\nties in racial and ethnic minorities and other devalued\ngroups who report discrimination.\n"
