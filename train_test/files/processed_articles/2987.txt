The design involved oversampling of cer-\ntain subgroups, including women of childbearing age, the\nelderly, and persons living in poverty areas. The survey in-\ncluded questions on sociodemographics, medical history,\ndiet, and biochemical and anthropometric measures. Of the\noriginal cohort, 14 407 adults were included in the Na-\ntional Health and Nutrition Examination Follow-up Study\n(NHEFS). Follow-up interviews were conducted in 1982,\ncluded an assessment of depression based on the Center\nfor Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D). In the\npresent investigation, we analyzed the follow-up data for\nthe cohort of participants who completed the CES-D from\nlow-up interview and reported having no history of heart\npression questionnaire. Compared with participants who\ncompleted the CES-D, the participants who did not com-\nplete the CES-D were older (58.2 vs 54.5 years) and of lower\nerty level). Furthermore, participants who did not com-\nplete the CES-D were less likely to be married than par-\nticipants who completed the CES-D. However, the outcomes\nwere not associated with whether the CES-D was com-\npleted. Participants who did not complete the CES-D were\nnot at greater risk for nonfatal CHD (relative risk [RR], 1.11;\nThe CES-D is a self-report scale designed to measure the\ncurrent prevalence of depressive symptoms in the general\npopulation.7 The scale consists of a series of 20 questions,\nand each question is rated from 0 to 3, with 0 indicating\nthat the symptom was experienced rarely or not at all dur-\ning the past week and 3 indicating that the symptom was\nexperienced most or all of the time during the past week.\nA cutpoint of 16 was established for distinguishing be-\ntween depressed and nondepressed patients because such\na score implies that many of the symptoms were assigned\na rating of 1 or 2, or at least 6 symptoms were assigned a\nrating of 3.8 Also, the scores in several clinical populations\nwere compared with those in the general population, and\nit was found that a score of 16 was a reasonable cut-\npoint.9,10 The reliability and validity of the CES-D have been\ntested in community samples. The results indicate that the\ninternal consistency is high, the concurrent validity (agree-\nment with other measures of depression) and construct va-\nlidity (ability to link scale items to attributes known to be\nassociated with depression) are good, and the test-retest\nreliability is acceptable.7\nWhile the CES-D is easy to administer and has the de-\nsirable properties of consistency and validity, there are some\nconcerns with its screening ability. Roberts and Vernon11\nhave reported that the sensitivity using the standard cutpoint\npression, whereas the specificity estimates are 83.4% and\n83.3%, respectively. Schein and Koenig12 reported the sen-\nsitivity and specificity of the CES-D using the standard cut-\npoint in a sample of elderly inpatients. In their sample, the\nsensitivity using 16 as the cutpoint for depression was 73%\nfor any depression and 90% for major depression. The asso-\nciated specificity estimates were 84% and 84%. Scores other\nthan the traditional cutpoint of 16 have been suggested to\nclassify depression. Husaini et al13 have recommended us-\ning scores of 17 or more and 23 or more to classify individu-\nals as having \"possible depression\" and \"probable depres-\nsion,\" based on their findings in community samples.\nConceptually, these categories are similar to \"normal depres-\nsives\"and\"clinicaldepressives,\"respectively.RobertsandVer-\nnon11 foundthatthespecificityformajordepressionwasquite\nhigh using a cutpoint of 23 (93%) compared with the stan-\ndard score of 16 (83.4%); however, the sensitivity was lower\nThe participants who had complete data for the CES-D were\nNext, individuals who reported a history of a physician-\ndiagnosed heart condition, heart attack, or angina were ex-\nand 14 men were excluded because of missing informa-\ntion on covariates. Thus, the analysis is based on 5006\nAs stated above, the cohort interviewed in 1982 was\nevaluated until 1992, the year of the final follow-up inter-\nview. At that time, all participants not experiencing the event\nof interest were censored. That is, all follow-up informa-\ntion was used on those participants even though the event\ndid not occur. Individuals lost to follow-up were censored\nIf an individual did not participate in a follow-up inter-\nview after the 1982 interview, he or she was censored at\n0.25 year.

All rights reserved.\nTo determine the incidence of nonfatal CHD events, data\nfrom hospital discharge records were used. Medical\nrecords were obtained from the hospitals where individu-\nals had reported being hospitalized between 1982 and\n1992. Discharge diagnoses were recorded by medical cod-\ners using ICD-9 codes. Each record included room for up\nto 10 diagnoses. Individuals who had a record with at\nhaving a CHD event. We also looked at the subgroup of\npatients who had an ICD-9 code of either 410 (acute MI)\nor 411 (other acute and subacute ischemic diseases), as\nthese codes represent acute events. Only first events were\nconsidered; therefore, individuals ceased to contribute\ntime after the first diagnosis.\nIt is possible that the number of CHD events\nobtained by reviewing the health care facility stay\nrecords is lower than the number that actually occurred\ncare facility stays were recorded.14-16 Fifty-six percent of\nthese records were matched to a participant self-report;\nthat is, a participant reported the stay and complete\ninformation from the facility was available. Twenty-four\npercent of the records were not matched. In these cases,\na participant reported a stay but no information from the\nhealth care facility was available. Finally, 20% of the\nrecords corresponded to additional stays found. Thus, a\nfacility reported an additional stay that was not reported\nby the participant. Because 24% of the self-reports had\nno associated information from the health care facility, it\nis possible that a greater number of CHD events\noccurred during the follow-up period. It is also possible\nthat more events occurred but were not reported by the\nparticipant, and therefore no attempt was made to con-\ntact the facility. No information is available for specific\ndiagnoses; however, if CHD event rates follow the same\npattern, this would be a problem of nondifferential mis-\nclassification. This type of misclassification would result\nin an underestimation of the effect of depression in the\nanalyses.\nThe percentage distributions for possible confounders\nwere first evaluated among depressed and nondepressed\nparticipants separately in men and women. Race was cat-\negorized as white and black/other. Hypertension and dia-\nbetes were defined as a positive response to the questions\nasking whether a physician had ever diagnosed the par-\nticipant with hypertension or diabetes. Smoking was\ndichotomized into never/former and current smoker.\nAlcohol use was ordered according to the total number of\ndrinks of beer, wine, and spirits: nondrinker, 1 drink or\nless per day, and more than 1 drink per day. A self-report\nassessment of the participant's usual recreational activity\nwas used to classify individuals as sedentary, engaging in\nlight exercise, or engaging in regular exercise. Marital sta-\ntus was assessed with 3 categories: single, married, and\ndivorced/widowed/separated. Finally, the mean poverty\nindex (percentage of the US poverty level) and body mass\nindex (BMI) were compared between the depressed and\nnondepressed participants.\nThe relationships between depression and CHD inci-\ndenceandbetweendepressionandCHDmortalitywereevalu-\nated separately in men and women using Cox proportional\nhazards regression models. The data are left truncated, since\nindividuals entered the study free of disease at different ages.\nTherefore, the analysis was conditional on the age at which\nthe participant entered and left the study (because of either\nexperiencing the event or being censored), because it is as-\nsumed that the hazard changes more as a function of age than\noftimeinthestudy.Foradescriptionofthemethod,seeKlein\nFour models were then developed to determine the\neffect that depression had on CHD incidence and mortal-\nity in men and women, adjusting for confounding vari-\nables. A combination of backward elimination and for-\nward selection techniques was used to select variables. A\nvariable was included in the model either if P.20 or if its\nremoval affected the parameter estimate for depression by\nat least 20%.19 In all of the models, continuous variables\nwere entered as continuous variables and quadratic func-\ntions. The likelihood ratio test was used to determine if the\nquadratic terms added significantly to the model. The fi-\nnal model was then checked for proportional hazards by\ncomparing a model that included log(time) interactions with\neach independent variable with the model that included only\nthe independent variables. The likelihood ratio test was used\nto compare these 2 models. In the male incidence model,\nsmoking did not meet the proportional hazards assump-\ntion. A term that accounted for the interaction between\nsmoking and log(time), which was the function of time used\nto check the proportional hazards assumption, was in-\ncluded in the final model.\nIn the mortality analyses we had to address the fact\nthat some patients had nonfatal CHD events prior to the\nfatal CHD event. Nonfatal events predict depression and\nthey increase risk of CHD mortality. Thus, if caused by a\nmechanism other than depression, nonfatal events should\nbe treated as a confounding variable in the relationship be-\ntween depression and fatal CHD. On the other hand, non-\nfatal CHD events are intermediate steps between depres-\nsion and fatal CHD; that is, depression may lead to a nonfatal\nevent, which then results in fatal CHD. Although there are\nmethods for doing so, we did not have enough informa-\ntion to treat depression as both a confounding variable and\nan intermediate step in the fatal CHD analyses. Such an as-\nsessment would have required repeated measurements of\ndepression over time. We decided to treat nonfatal events\nas time-dependent covariates in the mortality analyses. This\nresulted in conservative RR estimates; however, the con-\nclusions did not differ from those in the models that did\nnot include nonfatal events as covariates (results not shown).\nInteractions between depression and smoking and\nbetween depression and poverty (135% of the poverty\nlevel was selected as the cutpoint for defining poverty)\nwere then examined. The interactions between depression\nand smoking and between depression and poverty were\nchosen based on their relationship to depression and\nCHD. Previous studies have shown that the prevalence of\ndepression has a negative relationship to household\nincome.8,20 Furthermore, living close to the poverty level\nmay be associated with an increased risk of CHD.

A history of major depressive episode was associ-\nated with elevated odds of MI over the 13-year fol-\nlow-up period. The results were reported for men and\nwomen together, and there was no mention of a pos-\nsible interaction. It is likely that even if such an interac-\ntion had been examined there would not have been\nenough power to detect its presence since there were only\n6 events among the individuals with a history of major\ndepressive disorder.\nAnda et al6 used data from the first National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) to evalu-\nate the role of depression and hopelessness in CHD de-\nvelopment. A subsample of 6913 individuals completed\nthe General Well-being Schedule at the baseline inter-\nview. After an average of 12.4 years of follow-up, depres-\nsion was associated with an increased risk for both fatal\nand nonfatal CHD. The authors did not report whether\nthe effect of depression on CHD differed between men-\nand women.\nClearly, there is evidence that depression is related\nto CHD incidence and mortality in men, however little\nis known about how depression affects CHD risk in\nwomen. As stated above, studies that have examined the\neffect of depression on CHD incidence or mortality ei-\nther included only men, did not examine the possibility\nof a differential effect of depression in men and women,\nor tested for an interaction but observed none, likely ow-\ning to low power.\nThe prevalence of depression differs between men\nand women. Women in the Barefoot and Schroll4 study\nhad significantly higher scores on the depression scale\nthan did the men. Similarly, Anda et al6 reported a higher\npercentage of women with depressed affect than men\nthe participants with a history of major depressive dis-\norder were female. Thus, there is evidence that women\ntend to be more susceptible to depression than men.\nWhether this higher susceptibility affects the relation-\nship between depression and CHD is not known. The pres-\nent investigation was conducted to test the hypothesis\nthat the effect of depression on CHD incidence and mor-\ntality differs in men and women. A large, nationally rep-\nresentative data set was used to examine this question.\nRESULTS\nThe mean \u00b1 SD ages for the women and men were\nUsing 16 as the cutpoint for defining depression, 17.5%\nof the women were classified as depressed.

It was thought that the higher\ncutpoint would reduce the misclassification of depres-\nsion among the truly nondepressed women. All further\nresults are based on the classification of depression us-\ning the cutpoint of 23. The crude RR of nonfatal CHD\namong women scoring 23 or higher on the CES-D was\nand adjusted RR estimates.

It is therefore possible that an inter-\naction exists between depression and either poverty\nlevel or smoking status.\nTo eliminate the possibility that subclinical dis-\nease biased the relationship between depression and\nCHD, the analysis was performed a second time af-\nter excluding the first 2 years of follow-up. We also\nwanted to eliminate the possibility that antidepres-\nsant or tranquilizer use confounded the effect of de-\npression on CHD incidence and mortality, since these\nmedications may be related to mortality. We tested\nfor an effect of self-reported use of antidepressants\nand tranquilizers at baseline (1982 interview) in the\nfinal models.\nWe then looked at the effect of varying the cut-\npoint on the 2 outcomes. We computed age-\nadjusted RR estimates for each outcome separately,\nusing each score between 0 and 25 as a possible cut-\npoint.

None of the interactions tested was\nsignificant.\nVarying the cutpoint resulted in different patterns in men\nand women, and the patterns further differed according\nto the outcome. The results are presented in Figure 1.\nFirst, in women, there is only a slight increase in risk with\neach 1-point increase in the cutpoint until a CES-D score\nof 20, after which the risk increases more dramatically\nwith each 1-point increase. In men, the risk increases\nslightly with each 1-point increase in the cutpoint until\nthe CES-D score reaches 12, after which the RR esti-\nmates begin to increase more steeply. The RR estimates\nthen decrease below 1.5 above a cutpoint of 20. It is im-\nportant to note that there were only 10 events among the\nmen who scored above 20. Therefore, these RR esti-\nmates may not be stable because of the sparse data. To\nassess which cutpoint is optimal, we looked at the -2 log\nlikelihood from each model. The cutpoint that results in\nthe model with the smallest -2 log likelihood (or largest\nlog likelihood) is the optimal cutpoint.17 Among women,\nthe model with the smallest -2 log likelihood was the one\nthat used 24 as a cutpoint, and among men it was the\nmodel that used 15. We then evaluated the CES-D score\nas a continuous variable, adjusting for the potential con-\nfounders. Among women, a quadratic term for CES-D\nscore was significant (P = .03). Among men, only the lin-\near term was significant (P = .02). Therefore, 2 different\ncontinuous functions explained the relationship be-\ntween CES-D score and nonfatal CHD events in men and\nwomen.\nAn entirely different pattern emerged when the fa-\ntal RR estimates were plotted against the CES-D score\n(Figure 2). Varying the cutpoint did nothing to alter\nthe RR estimates in women. However, in men, begin-\nning at a score of 10, the RR estimates increase rather\nsharply.

We have shown that the ef-\nfect of depression on CHD risk differs in men and women.\nMore severe levels of depression were related to nonfa-\ntal CHD events in women, but there was no relationship\nto fatal CHD. Among men, depression was related to both\nnonfatal and fatal CHD.\nThese findings are in agreement with previous in-\nvestigations that analyzed the effect of depression on CHD\nincidence and mortality. As in the present investigation,\nAnda et al6 evaluated data from NHANES I; however, they\nused the General Well-being Schedule to define depres-\nsion, and their cohort consisted of the augmented sample\ninterviewed at the baseline interview. They reported that\nthe adjusted RRs of CHD incidence and mortality among\nand Schroll4 reported an effect of depression on fatal and\nnonfatal myocardial infarction (adjusted RR, 1.7; 95% CI,\n1.2-2.3). The recent data from the Precursors Study3 also\nsuggest that depression acts as an antecedent to CHD.\nIn their male cohort, the adjusted RR of CHD among de-\nIt is unclear why depression is related to CHD in-\ncidence but not mortality in women. In the Precursors\nStudy,3 depressed men had an increased risk of total CHD\nevents but not CHD mortality. However, Anda et al6 found\nthat depression had a similar relationship to fatal and non-\nfatal outcomes. In the present investigation, the effect of\ndepression on CHD mortality was greater than its effect\non CHD incidence in the male cohort.\nDepression was only measured once, at the begin-\nning of the study, which is the main limitation of this\nstudy. Serial measurements would have provided infor-\nmation on the dynamics of depression and how changes\nin depression affect CHD. Also, we could have evalu-\nated chronicity and severity of depression and how these\n2 indices relate to heart disease. Other investigators have\nfaced a similar problem.4,6 In his original report on the\nproperties of the CES-D, Radloff7 reported that the 1-year\ntest-retest correlation (of total score) was 0.49 in a com-\nmunity sample. It is therefore possible that many of the\nindividuals classified as depressed in 1982 remained in\nthat classification throughout the follow-up period.\nAnother limitation of the study was the lack of in-\nformation on serum cholesterol level in the 1982 inter-\nview. We cannot rule out the possibility that the results\nmay be confounded because of unmeasured serum cho-\nlesterol levels. Other investigators had information on this\nrisk factor, and controlling for cholesterol did not di-\nminish the effect of depression on CHD.3,4,6 Thus, it is\nunlikely that unmeasured serum cholesterol levels acted\nas a strong confounding variable in the present study.\nThe strengths of this study include its prospective\ndesign, large sample, and relatively long follow-up pe-\nriod. Also, unlike previous studies of depression and CHD,\nwe were able to analyze depression effects separately in\nwomen and men. Another strength of the present study\nand the NHANES I data set in general was the ability to\ncontrol for many cardiac risk factors and demographic\nvariables.\nThe present analyses controlled for baseline car-\ndiac risk factors, socioeconomic status, and preexisting\ndisease. Some of the participants may have had subclini-\ncal disease, which could have had an impact on both the\nCES-D score and the CHD event. After eliminating the\nfirst 2 years of follow-up, the relationships between de-\npression and nonfatal CHD remained in both men and\nwomen, and the relationship between depression and fa-\ntal CHD remained in men; this indicates that subclini-\ncal disease did not affect the results.\nThere are several pathways by which depression\nmay act to increase the risk of CHD. First, there is a\ngeneral clustering of behavioral risk factors among\ndepressed individuals that may affect the development\nof CHD. Depressed individuals are more likely to be\ncurrent smokers and less likely to quit smoking than\nnondepressed individuals.21 In the present investiga-\ntion, standard cardiac risk factors were controlled for in\nthe analyses, making confounding by known risk fac-\ntors an unlikely explanation. The second explanation\nfor the relationship between depression and CHD is\nthat altered autonomic tone affects heart rate variability,\nwhich then increases susceptibility to CHD. Carney et\nal23 reported that depressed CHD patients had lower\nheart rate variability compared with nondepressed CHD\npatients, and this relationship was not caused by disease\nseverity. The authors stated that lower heart rate vari-\nability was likely related to dysregulation of the auto-\nnomic nervous system, and it could place the individual\nat greater risk of ventricular fibrillation, leading to an\nincreased risk of CHD death. Another possible mecha-\nnism linking depression to CHD is increased platelet\naggregation. Fielding24 reviewed the literature and\nstated that elevated sympathetic activity may be present\nin depressed patients. Sympathetic catecholamines may\nCES-D Score\nRelative Risk of Fatal Event\nMen\nWomen\nFigure 2.

After specifying this rela-\ntionship, interventions (behavioral and pharmacological)\nto reduce the risk of CHD in depressed individuals can\nbe tested. Studies should also further examine the un-\nderlying relationship between depression and CHD. We\nfound that continuous functions explained the relation-\nship between depression score and nonfatal events in men\nand women and between depression score and fatal events\nin men. Analyzing the score as a continuous variable may\nbe more desirable than classifying depression according\nto a cutpoint because misclassification of depression near\nthe cutpoint could bias the results.\nPresented at the 39th Annual Conference on Cardio-\nvascular Disease Epidemiology and Prevention, American\nHeart Association Council on Epidemiology and Preven-\nnual meeting of the American Public Health Association, Chi-\nWe thank Lynn Mitchell for her assistance in the pro-\ngramming.
