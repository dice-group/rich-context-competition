A focus on voice as both political and performative means that the\ncontent as well as the form of voice must be considered in representation and\nparticipation. Similarly, the way that voice changes and is affected by systems of\npower and political structures is part and parcel of developing a theory of voice.\nThere is a notion that there is a political necessity for diverse voices to be present\nwithin democratic political systems to realize equality (Warren, 2002: 698). In this\narticle I refine `voice' in relation to this political notion but also draw on perfor-\nmativity. This does not detract from a political focus on the need to hear diverse\nvoices but rather supports it. My support responds to the critical concerns that\nminority people are co-opted by governments if they are included into political\nstructures in superficial ways. In the name of giving voice, minority people can be\ngiven tokenistic positions of power and prestige that hide underlying issues of\nassimilation and exclusion (Eisenberg and Kymlicka, 2011: 5).\nI draw on my ethnographic work with a marginalized minority group of indi-\ngenous Ncoakhoe (San) in Botswana who are engaged in a struggle for societal\nrecognition, to be recognized as human beings of equal value. In this work I\nexamined the ways in which individual indigenous people use voice to negotiate\ndifficult encounters and make their ways in the world within the broader society in\nwhich they are embedded. I worked with Ncoakhoe `advocates', who were engaged\nin their own process of representing Ncoakhoe. The necessity for their political\nvoice came from daily experiences of oppression and discrimination when interact-\ning with non-Ncoakhoe. I refer to a broad understanding that voice is (mis/\nun)heard or (mis)recognized on a societal level as well as on a legal or political\nlevel, as this relates to relationships of power that exist between speakers and\nlisteners, which ultimately affect the political use of voice.\nSo while voice is also an emic concept \u00ad one that my research participants used \u00ad\nI draw on ethnographic observations to show how voice reveals complex sets of\nsocio-political relations that cut across ethnic, linguistic and cultural boundaries.\nThe aim of this paper is to think about the political and performative aspects of\nvoice as a way to develop a theory that concerns representation, the body, social\nand political hierarchies and minority group politics. In short, I consider performa-\ntive and political aspects of what makes voice legible and audible in Botswana, and\nhow this can build into a broader theory that resonates not only with `subalterns'\nbut also with minority groups of people across the world.\nThe kinds of publics that are receptive to voice and the limits of speaking and\nbeing heard often lie in maintaining peace and not disrupting the status quo\nthrough dissent or non-consensual action. A voice is heard when listeners attend\nto dominant forms of speech and action through which voice becomes acceptable,\nlegible and audible. Through highlighting legibility and audibility we `enable\ninvestigation of what conditions obtrude to mute the speech of the subaltern'\n(Morris, 2010: 3), and we also reveal the conditions that help to accentuate the\nvoices of dominant people.\nI wish to orient anthropological discourses on voice towards what might be\ndeveloped as an anthropology of listening. A focus on voice(s) ostensibly makes\nthe speaker responsible for what is said. Yet we have always been aware that no\naction, act of speaking or behaviour is isolated from the situation and context in\nwhich it is made. For instance Gayatri Spivak (1988: 24) highlights the `epistemic\nviolence' of intellectuals who have often sought to claim the voice of others. This\nopens us towards an understanding of the struggles of non-dominant minority\npeoples, who may come into direct contact with violence for having a different\nway of speaking, understanding or experiencing the world than majority peoples.\nVoice (as both political as well as performative) is not just about voicing or speak-\ning; it is also about listening and hearing, for it is in the ways that the audience or\nlistener reacts to, accepts, or rejects what has been put out into the social milieu\nthat reveals the (political/social) impact of that voice.\nListening/hearing/mishearing has an effect on the way that the voice is pro-\nduced. The language being used, the tonal qualities of the speech, as well as the\ntopics spoken about and the bodily gestures that can be adopted to maximize the\nlegitimacy of the voice are effected by the (imagined) audience and the kind of effect\nthat the speaker wishes to have. When minorities attempt to `translate' their voices\ninto the dominant rhetoric of the majority so that their message might affect change\nin the attitudes/practices/policy decisions, a tension arises. For when their voice\nchanges to speak in a way that can be listened to, i.e. in a legible and audible way,\ntheir message may be changed, watered down, dismissed or silenced because the\nissues raised are `unacceptable' and cause a negative reaction.\nListening requires an openness so that the perspective of the speaker might not\nmerely be voiced but also heard, listened to and recognized. Yet while minority\npeoples attempt to meet the majority half-way through the way they present them-\nselves, the majority peoples are reluctant to meet them at the half-way point, for it\nis often these people who run the risk of losing the most from change. When\nminority peoples are lauded and promoted to positions in structures as if there\nhave been shifts in power, in actuality their voices often fall on deaf ears or their\nissues are silenced. Ultimately they are generally heard only in environments that\nare dominated by minorities, or in self-contained environments which have limited\neffects.\nIn this article I draw attention to an interdisciplinary literature to develop an\nanthropological inquiry of voice. I posit that not only is it important to note\nthat voice is rooted in political as well as performative aspects of the speaker,\nbut also that it is only through examining the structural and cultural issues of\nlistening that the nuances of voice can be heard. In the next section I think\nabout the positon that voice has taken in anthropology, and how this interlinks\nwith performativity and work on gesture, before moving into ethnography of\nvoice from Botswana.\nVoice\nA promise of giving voice to minority and under-represented groups has been part\nof a broad emancipatory agenda that has been deployed in media studies (Dreher,\nMladen Dolar (2006), a philosopher and cultural theorist, addresses voice as an\nobject of study rather than as a vehicle for meaning or source of aesthetic admir-\nation. He reveals a paradox, that voice is both an object that emerges from the\nbody, but `is neither fully defined by the body, nor completely beyond it'\n(Schlichter, 2011: 33). The `object voice' is described by Dolar as `a bodily missile\nwhich has detached itself from the source, emancipated itself, yet remains\ncorporeal . . . So the voice stands . . . at the intersection of language and the body,\nbut this intersection belongs to neither' (2006: 73). Drawing from Dolar, Annette\nSchlichter (2011: 32) develops a critique of Judith Butler who, she argues, refrains\nfrom theorizing voice as she simultaneously presents naturalized gender through\nlanguage, at the same time as overlooking the material qualities of the voice. Butler\nmaintains a focus on the visual representation of gender and eventually presents us\nwith `voiceless bodies', as the body becomes central to her understanding of gender,\nyet voice is reduced to the body. Schlichter describes Butler's works as portraying\n`voice without theory' (Schlichter, 2011: 32), and indeed it is notable that, in social\nscience broadly, voice remains under-theorized.\nWhen we think of voice the most common idea that comes to mind are the\nvoices that we hear every day that carry our communicative messages between one\nanother. In this form, voice is central to social and political life and is inseparable\nfrom its articulation within a social world of other actors, who are both present and\nabsent in any given context (Keane, 1999: 273).Voice can also relate to agency,\nrepresentation, power and authority of `having a voice', and can be concerned with\n`claiming one's voice'. Voice has been conceived of as being multiple and context-\nual, and within a single group, or even a single person, there are a number of voices;\nas Appadurai (1988: 17) explains, `voice is a problem of multiplicity as well as a\nproblem of representation'. Voice within anthropology has been linked to textual\nrepresentation, the discussion of which peaked in the 1980s `Writing Culture'\ndebate (Clifford and Marcus, 1986). Outside of that debate, voice has also been\nlinked to `linguistic expressions of agency, hierarchy and political-economic\nchange' (Dinwoodie, 1998: 194), but it has also been used to discuss the material\nqualities of speech. It seems then that voice is a term that has been picked up and\nused in various ways.\nI contend that the productivity of deploying voice as an analytical category is\nthat our focus becomes a `set of . . . material and literary practices shaped by cul-\nturally and historically specific moments' as well as `a category invoked in discourse\nabout personal agency, cultural authenticity, and political power' (Weidman, 2014:\n38). In this way voice is more than the language used, the speech pattern employed\nor the prominent linguistic features but is also about how the speaker talks, how\nthey stand and the social symbols that they use and appropriate in order to be\nheard. Voice is as much about being heard or recognized as it is about speaking.\nListening is a key element to any research on voice.\nCollective voice, `giving voice', voice and identity\nVoice has been used to describe a number of different aspects of social and political\nlife. In relation to social movements, voice is often tied to claims for political\nrecognition, equality, and identity politics, which can be part of a struggle for\ndisability rights, feminist claims, or indigenous activism. In these cases, voice can\nhelp to reach far beyond individual experiences and instead connect to `the experi-\nences of a group; collective and shared experience' (Crossley and Crossley, 2001:\n1484) that are critical in uniting members of minority groups who face prejudice\nand discrimination. Voice can go hand-in-hand with thinking about access to\npower and struggles to be represented in structures of political power. There can\nbe a strong emphasis on the democratic potential of voice. In this context, it is\nassumed that diverse voices are necessary to insure a well-functioning democratic\npolitical system. The need to `give voice' to different groups is often central to a\ndemocratic political agenda for voice.\nHowever, many have critiqued the notion that giving voice is in itself empower-\ning. Critics have argued that actually voice offers `only superficial forms of inclu-\nsion', thereby `essentializing group identities' and failing to address `the problem of\npower in the selective bestowing of voice' (McLeod, 2011: 179). This critique\nsuggests that using participation as the only measure of empowerment actually\nfeeds into discourses that serve to maintain imbalances. Participation can be super-\nficial and used to cover up underlying inequalities that are maintained. At the same\ntime as recognizing this critique, I also do not wish to dispute the idea that\nincreased participation in political systems can be beneficial. My point is rather\nthat using presence as evidence that voice is being heard is a rather superficial\nmeasure to use.\nVoice is also viewed as being a `guarantor of truth and self-presence, from which\nsprings the familiar idea that the voice expresses self and identity and that agency\nconsists in having a voice' (Weidman, 2014: 39). A western tradition places empha-\nsis on the voice as a vehicle for the internal self, which formed a basis for the\ndevelopment of psychoanalytical practice. A focus on identity is often separated\nfrom the material qualities of the voice \u00ad `the sense that they [voices] are produced\nthrough bodily actions and the training of bodies' (Weidman, 2014: 41). Studies\nthat focus on the materiality of voices and vocal practices are often set aside from\nthe social/political work of identity-based projects, suggesting they do not coincide.\nTo have a voice is not only about maintaining or claiming a political agenda as a\ngroup but is also a `key representational trope for identity, power, conflict, social\nThese are not separate, especially as we consider the dominance of `identity politics'\nin the world today, where who you are and who you say you are, as well as who\nothers say you are, matters. Group affiliation and individual identity are closely\nintertwined with making political claims to land, citizenship and belonging.\nResponding to the idea that voice is a guarantor for truth of the inner self is a\ndifficult position to maintain, not only because it `disregards some of the important\nsocio-political reasons of vocalization' (Schlichter, 2011: 34) but also because, as\nanthropologists, we have known that `[w]hat people say is often striking, but it\nneeds to be accompanied by a focus on what they do' (Engelke, 2011: 179).\nMethodologically this is significant and foregrounds the need for participant\nobservation, and suggests that we need to engage beyond speech, to think about\naction.\nMoreover, we have long known that:\nEvery speaker has available numerous ways of speaking that are associated by virtue\nof linguistic ideologies with different character types, professions, genders, social sta-\ntuses, kinship roles, moral stances, ideological systems, age groups, ethnicities, and so\nforth . . . these may be expressed by virtually any linguistic contrast, including lexical\nor language choice . . . variations in fluency, phonology, or syntax. These permit\nspeakers to claim, comment on, or disavow different identities and evaluative stances\nVoice is a way for a social actor to enact or perform their identity and to use their\nown agency. In different contexts their voice may sound different, or may change.\nVoice is multiple for any single actor. Hill (1995) suggests that we should not be\nlooking for the `real self' represented in any single voice, as the self is dispersed over\nmultiple voices and is in the gaps between voices too. Even when there is a single\nagent, there are many different voices used in order to be heard. Research needs to\nencompass different times and places when/where voice is used by an actor, and\nwhere silence is used too.\nPerformativity, gesture and bodies\nVoice uses speech and gestures. Judith Butler's theory of performativity draws on\n`speech acts' \u00ad the performative act of speaking in which we `incorporate' the\nreality that is around us by enacting it with our bodies. Speech acts are constituent\nof words and also the tenor and tone of the speech \u00ad `it is the constellation of\nintended meaning, mode of delivery, and unintended effect that must be considered\nas a . . . kind of unity' (Butler, 2004: 172). Speaking is a bodily act that requires the\nlarynx, mouth, tongue, lips and lungs (Butler, 2004: 172). Speaking passes through\nthe body and involves the presentation of the body. It matters, for instance, how\nthe speaker is dressed, and the gestures (Merleau-Ponty, 1962) that the body makes\nwhile speaking. Indeed there is a whole science to public speaking, and we see\npoliticians and other public orators imbuing their speech with `powerful' bodily\ngestures. Social and political articulations are revealed though animating speech\nusing the body to make and create situations in which the speaker is heard.\nMaurice Merleau-Ponty emphasized that spoken words are not just the transfer\nof representation but also consist of expressive gestures: `the spoken word is sig-\nnificant not only through the medium of individual words, but also through that of\naccent, intonation, gesture and facial expression, and as these additional meanings\nno longer reveal the speaker's thoughts but the source of his thoughts and his\nfundamental manner of being' (Merleau-Ponty, 1962: 150). When speaking, we\nare not only orating words that have meaning but we also are imbuing meaning\nthrough the way we perform the speech, and these are what generate voice. For\ninstance, the speaker must be in the right place, in front of the right audience,\nspeaking a particular language, using acceptable words and standing in the right\nplace in order to be validated, legitimized and ultimately heard and understood. In\norder to be heard, the body of the speaker must be readable and legible to the\naudience. Voice then is more than just about what is said, as it is also about how the\nspeaker presents themselves and puts themselves in a position to be heard. This\ninvolves both words \u00ad what is said \u00ad and the way it is said, as well as the body that\nuses gestures that make the speech more `hearable', and thus understood and\naccepted.\nSince there is also the element of being heard, voice and its constituent aspects\nmust be understood in the context of the broader society. The body is integral to\nvoice and certain types of people/bodies are more likely to be heard in public than\nothers. For instance, Povinelli (2002) writes that indigenous bodies are under scru-\ntiny and that the ability for a person with an indigenous body to act autonomously\nis curtailed by the social checks that are made on her or his body, a body that is\nperpetually `out of place' (Douglas, 1966). Through an exaggeration of difference\nbetween people within society `a semblance of order is created' (Douglas, 1966: 4).\nThus, the indigenous body, in being separated and demarcated as different, is part\nof the overall social structure that requires these differences to maintain hierarchies\nwithin the larger system. Maintaining a low social profile for indigenous people is\npart of how dominant voices and bodies are kept in positions of higher status, in\npositions where they are heard and listened to more easily. In this way being heard\nis not dependent on the speaker but on the broader society which listens in very\nparticular ways that relate to the social structures. Signifiers such as age, gender,\nrace, religion, dress and many other factors serve to filter and discern who speaks\nclearly and powerfully, and who is ignored. We are also reminded that there are\nissues of publics \u00ad that different kinds of publics expect different things from the\nspeaker and listen to the speaker in particular ways.\nA `speaking body'\nAbraham, a 40-year-old Naro-speaking Ncoakhoe man from Gantsi, was an artist\nwhom I met serendipitously at his studio near Gaborone during my first week of\nfieldwork. Abraham and I decided to take a trip to the Kalahari and go on a safari\ngame drive with our non-Ncoakhoe friends, a female artist, Lesedi (24, Setswana-\nspeaker), and a male artist, Peter (32, Kalanga-speaker). We joined five more\npeople on this safari drive, including a young well-dressed Batswana couple and\ntwo older Batswana men.1\nThe government-employed wildlife ranger Mpho, who took us on the drive, was\na non-Ncoakhoe Motswana man.2 He wore expensive Ray-Ban shades and a large\ncowboy-style sun hat. He gave Lesedi and me, the only `single' women present, a\ncasual elongated look over the top of his shades. To me, this showed how confident\nhe felt in his position as a wildlife ranger, a position that provides a steady wage\nand job security which is often influential in gaining the affections of women.\nDuring the drive, we asked Mpho questions about the animals and he answered\nwith ease and pleasure. As an inquisitive (and nai\u00a8ve) anthropologist, I decided to\nask, `So where are the Bushmen [Ncoakhoe]?' As though he was offended, Mpho\nquickly dismissed my question by saying, `There are no Bushmen [Ncoakhoe] here'.\nI replied, `But I read that there are a few hundred Bushmen [Ncoakhoe] living\ninside the [Central Kalahari Game] Reserve.' My question was contentious, prob-\nably for a number of reasons. Discussing issues about Ncoakhoe in public in\nBotswana often sparks immediate reactions. I have seen how it can cause sucking\nof teeth, the rolling of eyes, and an obvious disconnection from the topic of dis-\ncussion, as a general sense of annoyance is shown by non-Ncoakhoe Batswana.\nThat I am white and British and that I started to speak about Ncokahoe may have\nbeen unintentionally antagonistic. Historically Botswana has struggled against a\nUK-based advocacy charity, Survival International, who in the eyes of many\nBatswana have been disrespectful to their country in the way they have attempted\nto lobby for the land rights of Ncoakhoe. Moreover, part of the contentiousness of\nour interaction was that the government wishes to assist the development of\nmodern, educated citizens. Since I inferred that I expected Ncoakhoe to live in\nthe same place as animals, which, according to a developmental framework of\nprogress and success, may be construed as a negative or shameful place to live, I\nwas not sure how Mpho would take this. Mpho quickly became aggressive, raising\nhis voice to explain that `the government is trying to move them out . . . give them\neducation . . . they need civilisation'; and he added, `they need development'.\nThe tone in the group had shifted and had become tense. At this point Mpho\nstopped the vehicle as it was time for a fizzy drink that was provided as part of the\nsafari. The discussion was now taken up by the two older male Batswana members\nof the safari group. One of them asked, `Our government is trying to provide\neducation for all of us . . . don't you think everyone is entitled to education?'\nGiven their gender and age, these older men had a higher social status than a\nyoung woman like me. Moreover, being a white European talking about education,\ndevelopment and Ncoakhoe is likely to cause defensiveness in others who react to\nthe historical and ongoing political and social pressure that European nations, and\nvisible representatives of these nations, put on non-European nations, and citizens\nto conform to the ideas that they present. Post-colonial relationships have tended\nto reproduce colonial structures, which no doubt affects subsequent interpersonal\ninteractions. I boldly replied, `Yes. But it depends on what kind of education you're\ntalking about.' However, my approach was not taken seriously: `That's a different\nissue. We are talking about the issue if everyone should have the opportunity for\neducation.'\nAlthough I agree that access to education should be universal, I am aware of\ncultural nuances within education \u00ad the use of language, the hidden curriculum,\nprejudice and discrimination that all impact the experience of education, especially\nfor minority groups. However, by now I felt overwhelmed by the confrontation\nwith these older and socially powerful Batswana men. I left my un-articulated point\nas it was and, feeling a little defeated, I remained silent.\nWe all stood at different points around one side of the vehicle where the cool box\ncontaining the mid-safari refreshments was resting on the warm sand. Mpho\ndeclared to us all that the reason Ncoakhoe are still living deep in the bush is\nbecause of their `stupidity', since the government is trying to help them yet they\nare `refusing' to accept this help. At this point, Peter, my male artist friend,\nretorted, `You know, my friend here [points with his head and uses a slight hand\ngesture towards Abraham] is one of them [Ncoakhoe]'. Mpho turned to look at\nAbraham and appeared a little shocked. It did not seem that he was expecting to\nhear that. He continued, `That's okay, you're the sensible one. At least you under-\nstand. You're living in the city, wearing clothes, not like the others who take off\ntheir clothes and start running around after the animals.'\nMpho defined himself and other `normal' city-dwelling people who wore clothes,\nhad jobs and who were probably educated, as being `superior'. He drew on a\nperception of Ncoakhoe as being `backwards', `difficult', `stupid' and `uneducated'\nthat he connected with an image of them being naked and animal-like. In numerous\ninstances (Freire, 1970), the concept of illiteracy and of being `uneducated' often\nprovides a definition of the `other' and can be a `cover for powerful groups simply\nto silence the poor, minority groups, women, or people of color' (Giroux, 1988: 66).\nAt the same time Mpho also identified Abraham as not-really-like-the-others, and\nthus suggested that he was `better' than Ncoakhoe who were still stupid and back-\nwards. This kind of distinction could be divisive as it encouraged Abraham to agree\nwith him, thus created a division between himself and other Ncoakhoe. Mpho's\nstatements both signal the ready use of stereotypes about Ncoakhoe and the dehu-\nmanized way in which they are treated, as well as revealing the complexities of\nrelations within Botswana.\nAbraham said nothing. Instead he quickly and effortlessly climbed onto the\nbonnet of the 4x4 safari vehicle. He was calm and measured in his movements.\nWe all stood looking up at him as he took off his big boots, then steadily undid\neach button of his shirt. He peeled it off and stood topless. He loosened his belt and\nlet his trousers drop into a pile at his feet. He was naked except for his underwear.\nHis hands rested on his hips, his legs were apart and his eyes looked into the far\ndistance across the Kalahari landscape. It was a stance that told us he felt proud\nand free to `run after the animals' if he chose to do so. He was asserting his identity\nas a Ncoakhoe man and standing in solidarity with those who, according to Mpho,\nwere `not like him'. This was a powerful image. His audience was quiet as we\nwaited to see what he would do next. Abraham turned his head to look at us all\nstood on the ground, and a broad grin swept across his face. He stooped to pull up\nhis trousers, scooped up the rest of his clothing and boots and jumped down off the\nbonnet. Lesedi, Peter and I celebrated Abraham's statement and slapped each\nother's hands in celebration of Abraham's defiance. There was no comeback to\nhis response.\nReflections on the protest\nDiscrimination against Ncoakhoe in Botswana is pervasive, and it riled Mpho and\nthe safari group into a heated debate. Mpho succinctly bound ethnicity, place of\nresidence and subsistence practices into a negative stereotype while he simultan-\neously attempted to devalue Ncoakhoe cultural practices. Moreover, Mpho and the\nother Batswana on the safari drive found it difficult to talk about ethnic and cul-\ntural difference beyond a modernization perspective that follows a fairly linear\ndevelopment trajectory within a liberal discourse of equal rights and opportunity.\nThis broadly reflects the perspective taken by the government and citizens of\nBotswana.\nAbraham viscerally drew us towards the difficulties for Ncoakhoe voices to\nbe heard above the strong stereotypes. Here Abraham's body used performa-\ntivity to `speak' in a way that did not use orated language. Through his naked\nbody, and through the performance of undressing and his stance, Abraham\nactively and powerfully responded to the situation. Naked bodies have been\nused in protests all over the world, by different people for different causes. In\nUganda, for instance, old women protested against land reform by undressing\n(Ware, 2015); by undressing, the `protesters' actively make themselves vulnerable\nthrough revealing the fragility of their body(ies). So while my PhD supervisor at\nthe time was mildly surprised to hear me retell this story, he also informed me\nthat he had heard of a `naked protest' by Ncoakhoe before. Clearly this protest\nwas part of a wider dialogue for Ncoakhoe, but also more generally, in south-\nern Africa and across the world too. Being naked strips away any defence,\nleaving a person literally bare. What is supposedly the weakest aspect of any\nperson, their vulnerable unclothed nakedness, is a source of strength.\nUndressing symbolically defies attempts at coercing or persuading that person\naway from how they imagine themselves, as it clearly demonstrates their will to\nbe who they are in their totality.\nMoreover, for Ncoakhoe, being naked reappropriates a symbol (their `naked-\nness') that has been used primarily to pejoratively devalue or undermine the status\nGiven that appropriate means `to take possession of or make use of exclusively for\noneself,' we consider reappropriate to mean to take possession for oneself that which\nwas once possessed by another, and we use it to refer to the phenomenon whereby a\nstigmatised group revalues an externally imposed negative label by self-consciously\nreferring to itself in terms of that label.\nBy using his body, Abraham's voice was loud and clear. Rather than passively\naccepting the negative meanings of the labels espoused by Mpho, which relate to\nbroader sets of negative labels used in Botswana about Ncoakhoe, Abraham\nrejected the damaging meanings commonly associated with it. By reappropriating\nthis label he imbued it with positive connotations, and thus sought to renegotiate\nthe meaning of the label from something hurtful to something positive and\nempowering. Instead of being silenced, and effectively allowing himself to be\nremoved from the group (of Ncoakhoe), Abraham challenged the way in which\nNcoakhoe were perceived and judged by non-Ncoakhoe. He simultaneously\nshowed solidarity with Ncoakhoe who were, according to Mpho, `not like him',\nwhile he rejected Mpho's attempt to differentiate him from other Ncoakhoe.\nAbraham's voice spoke loudly even when he was vocally silent. Indeed silence\nhas been part of the tactics employed by Ncoakhoe in dealing with conflicts which\ncannot be worked out using the preferred method \u00ad talking. Talking has been\nsituations where talking through conflicts was not possible (for whatever reason),\nPolly Wiessner comments that Ju/'hoansi (Ncoakhoe) `vote with their feet' (2014:\n14029), and often simply physically leave difficult situations. A silent yet bodily\naction is sometimes heard most loudly. Ncoakhoe in villages where there are mixed\nethnic groups are often treated badly by non-Ncoakhoe. A number of Ncoakhoe\ntold me how Ncoakhoe are likely to leave a village or settlement when non-\nNcoakhoe move in. They migrate to places where there is no one to cause conflict,\nand this is substantiated elsewhere in literature (Motzafi-Haller, 2002: 158). Here\nthe action of moving away \u00ad speaking with their feet \u00ad speaks loudly of the difficult\nand compromising living situations that Ncoakhoe find themselves in and the\ndesire to be free from negativity and relationships that demean their position.\nIn situations where talking has no effect, then bodily action through walking\naway, moving locations or \u00ad in the case of the safari mentioned earlier \u00ad undressing\nis how voice emerges. The body speaks in ways that talking does not, as it changes\nthe terms of the argument or discussion. During the safari trip it was clear that a\ncritical discussion about education and development was not acceptable, as my\nattempts to address this had been dismissed. However, Abraham changed the terms\nof the debate from being about education and development to being about his life\nand the lives of other Ncoakhoe who, through simply inhabiting their `rural-dwell-\ning' and `naked' bodies, were identified as `other' and faced discrimination, nega-\ntive labelling and often attitudes of disgust from the majority population. This was\na protest against negative portrayals of Ncoakhoe and action towards positive\nreappropriation and active self-empowerment of Ncoakhoe identity. The body is\na powerful vessel through which voice emerges, even (or especially) when vocally\nsilent. Bodies and action, as well as speech, are central to voice, perhaps especially\nfor the so-called `voiceless', i.e. people from marginalized, disempowered and sub-\nordinate groups.\nYet the impact of this kind of action could be delicate: while Abraham defiantly\nshowed solidarity with and pride in Ncoakhoe culture through a reappropriation of\nnakedness, did his wordless action translate in the same way to Mpho? It is likely\nthat Mpho's interpretation might be quite different. Did Abraham's action then\nfoster and build understanding between the groups, or did it further solidify stereo-\ntypes in the eyes of his audience? How did they listen to this protest? Since he used\na common essentialized symbol as the backbone of his protest, Abraham's message\nmight have had the effect of further reifying Ncoakhoe in the eyes of the safari\ngroup. Moreover, given the way that Batswana political culture revolves around\nconsensus and consultation, could Abraham's action be misrecognized as an\ninstance that further reaffirmed their `difficult-ness', rather than as an act of self-\npreservation and pride in the social and cultural group with which he identifies?\nCan we equate this powerful example of silently giving voice with empowerment?\nOther minority people face this issue too; for instance, there are ongoing debates\nabout the success of the reappropriation of, for example, `nigger' by African\nAmericans (Anderson, 2010) or `slut' to address a culture of victim-blaming in\ncases of sexual assault (`Georgiaporgia', 2011). Do these reappropriations serve\nto fuel the stereotype or label, or dispel it? Indeed, in other situations I noted a\ndistinctly negative reaction of Batswana towards Ncoakhoe when they spoke:\nNcoakhoe speaking out was seen as `troublemaking' which was being instigated\nby `troublemakers'. This opens the question of not only what Ncoakhoe are saying\nbut also, when Ncoakhoe speak, how they are heard. Analysts of these acts of voice\nmust consider, in relation to the power differentials, the effects that non-Ncoakhoe\nhave. It is important to assess the impact of their (in)ability to listen to the\nmessages being communicated. The effect of this approach is to decouple taken-\nfor-granted assumptions within society that come from culturally or ethnically\ndominant groups.\nLanguage ideology\nBeyond the body, there are mechanisms that are fundamental to society that also\nreveal issues that affect voice. I turn to language ideologies to make sense of this\nphenomenon. Kroskrity (2000: 8\u00ad23) identified that `language ideologies represent\nthe perception of language and discourse that is constructed in the interest of a\nspecific social or cultural group'. This is the idea that what is seen as morally good\nor aesthetically pleasing underlies the way in which language is used. Infringements\nto this moral code are then not only incorrect linguistic acts but are also immoral.\nThis suggests that Abraham's actions are likely to be interpreted as wrong or\nimmoral, as his language \u00ad or lack of it \u00ad did not adhere to the dominant form\nof communication.\nAnalyses of language ideologies are a tool that can help to reveal hierarchies that\nemphasize dominant forms of speech and language which underwrite power rela-\ntionships between groups in society. Language hierarchies feed into the way in\nwhich voice is used, and what kinds of voices are heard and by whom, and they\nalso feed into how we can analyse representation. For instance, even if using the\nsame language, English, there are signifiers carried within the accent used and the\nwords selected that help the listener differentiate who is `worthy' of being taken\nseriously (Brown et al., 2003: 120; Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission\n& Social Mobility Commission, 2015: 25). Social signifiers such as class and geo-\ngraphical location are often obvious in the way someone speaks. An example of\nthis from the UK context is a Birmingham or `Brummie' accent, which carries the\nweight of prejudice in that the larger society may classify the speaker as `stupid'\n(Workman, 2016). Because of the imposition of the dominant language ideology in\nthe UK, non-dominant accents, i.e. those not using the `Queen's English', and\nespecially those who have a strong regional accent, face discrimination. It is\nlikely that those with `non-standard' accents are less frequently heard in public\nspheres. In Botswana those with Ncoakhoe accents are thought to sound stupid\nand uneducated and are subject to various types of discrimination.\nMoreover, in Botswana the numerous Ncoakhoe languages, known as Khoisan\nlanguages, are phonetically complex and use a number of `click' sounds. Non-\nNcoakhoe often find that their untrained bodies are unable to eloquently produce\nthese sounds. These clicks are a source of ridicule by non-Ncoakhoe, who some-\ntimes poorly imitate random `clack-ity-clack' noises as a way to demonstrate their\nnegative perceptions of these languages and their speakers. Making these noises\nalerts us to one way in which Khoisan languages are identified and erased from\npublic social life \u00ad through ridicule.\nThere is also a general lack of desire for non-Ncoakhoe to learn Khoisan\nlanguages, and a general rhetoric is that they are `too hard' to learn. Yet what\nthis demonstrates is a lack of `bodily technique' (Mauss, 1992) in producing and\nreproducing these sounds. Mauss (1992: 73) explains that bodily techniques and\nbodily actions are imitated from people who are perceived as having authority over\nthe imitator, and to whom the imitator must display compliance: `The action is\nimposed from without, from above, even if it is an exclusively biological action,\ninvolving his body' (Mauss, 1992: 73). Body technique is shaped by social and\npolitical hierarchies.\nMauss (1992: 73) continues by explaining that it is a `notion of prestige of the\nperson who performs the ordered, authorised tested action vis-a`-vis the imitating\nindividual' which reveals that there is a psychological element as well as a physio-\nlogical element. There is an `ensemble of techniques of the body' which are not just\nassembled by the individual but also through their education, their society and\ntheir place in that society (Mauss, 1992: 76). The way the body is used maps onto\nthe broader social and political structures that are found within that society.\nLanguage ideologies help to describe the social fabric of societies and how this is\ntranslated into practices that effect and differentiate groups within society.\nMarginalized minority groups are nearer the bottom of the hierarchy of that soci-\nety. A low social position influences voice (speech and action), as often what makes\na group marginal is the peripheral way in which their language, practices and\nbodies are understood and received by other members of society. For instance,\nAbraham's protest was against the negative portrayal of Ncoakhoe bodies and\ncultural practices. Rather than using spoken words which carry within them a\ndifferent and distinguishable accent from the dominant Setswana-speaking major-\nity in Botswana who were present and dominant in number and attitude on the\nsafari drive, his silent action suggests that non-dominant languages and accents\nmatter when it comes to speaking to being heard: being listened to.\nNow I turn to my ethnography with a young Ncoakhoe man, Cgase, who was in\na position of privilege and power relative to many other Ncoakhoe who I met.\nHe was a university student and was part of a Christian youth group that was\naffiliated with a well-known church in Botswana. Within this group Cgase used his\nvoice in ways that matched those that are generally recognizable as respectable and\nmoral in Botswana. He spoke with confidence in public on a Christian stage. This\ndrew positive attention to Cgase, and could be seen as good practice for him in the\nfuture, as he wished to become a politician in national party politics.\nOutside of the Christian group, Cgase was given certain amounts of power as he\nwas invited to perform prayers at the beginning of meetings in his home village \u00ad a\nprivilege extended to those who are deemed well-versed in Christian discourse and\npractice. However, although a couple of years after my fieldwork Cgase spoke at\nthe United Nations Working Group of Indigenous Peoples (UNWGIP), it was\nunclear what power his voice held outside of the relatively self-contained publics\nof the church group, his village and an international indigenous forum. There were\nindications that his voice, although responsive to the dominant cultural and social\nmarkers of education and church-going, was still contained within particular pub-\nlics. This raises a question: when will indigenous minorities be able to speak on\nbehalf of the wider public and not only their own people, or other small, self-\ncontained audiences?\nCgase: A Christian voice\nCgase (a Naro speaker) was enrolled on a BA in Marketing at the University of\nBotswana.3 Although he lived in the capital city, Gaborone, he was from D'Kar,\nwhere his mother still lived. Cgase explained that he was the only one in his family\nwho attended church and he was also on the board of a student-led Christian\nchurch society at the University of Botswana.\nThe student society met weekly in a lecture theatre at the University of\nBotswana's main campus. When he spoke at the church meeting, Cgase was intro-\nduced onto the stage of the lecture theatre by two pastors from the main local\nchurch who come to give sermons to the group. Cgase stood easily and charismat-\nically on stage while he delivered a passionate and well-measured motivational\nspeech in Setswana, and for the benefit of me, their guest, also partly in English.\nAs he spoke, one of his hands rested halfway in the pocket of his trousers. His shiny\nshoes and relaxed shoulders swaying slightly left to right as he strolled across the\nstage showed that although he was not ordained by the church, he was on his way\nto following in the footsteps of the pastors who sat quietly at the side of the stage.\nAs he delivered his message to the group, Cgase's speaking style was impressive and\ninsistent. He invited and encouraged the church group members to join a trip to\nSouth Africa where, as part of a wider church directive, they would meet other\nchurch members (most affiliated church groups visit their church headquarters in\nSouth Africa more frequently).\nAlthough other student members of the group also went up on stage to speak,\nnone inhabited the stage as easily or comfortably as Cgase. One student even\ncommented on Cgase's proficiency as he encouraged others to come prepared to\nspeak at the meeting, `so that when the likes of Cgase has stood and spoken, it is\nnot like you can say, ``oh well he said everything'''. This comment suggested that\nCgase held a strong position within the group as others may have felt shy or\ninferior when speaking after him, as he had said `everything' so that there was\nnothing left for others to contribute.\nThis Christian public were impressed by Cgase's obvious ease and skill in speak-\ning on stage, and his voice commanded respect. Here the audience could listen to\nCgase and hear what he had to say, even revering his words and actions. A pro-\nficiency in English and Setswana was a sign of him being an educated person to\nwhom attention should be paid. Speaking English was a desirable skill for many\nyoung people, as it also suggested that they have connections, or else have the\nability to make connections, with people from international places where English is\nthe lingua franca.\nCgase chose to participate within the construction and production of a Christian\ndiscourse in and around a church. First and foremost, then, his public voice was\nlegitimized within a Christian space. Cgase gained a positive position of relative\npower within the church group due to his ability and desire to contribute, as well as\nhis ability to speak calmly and confidently in front of his peers, and superiors in the\nchurch. Cgase's voice was validated both through performativity \u00ad that is, through\nthe skills in speaking loudly and confidently in Setswana on stage \u00ad as well as\nthrough the content of the language used, as it revealed his proficiency in translat-\ning and making accessible Christian rhetoric and Christian teachings.\nAt all public meetings in Botswana, someone is asked to lead the group in prayer\nin the Setswana language before the meeting commences. At a meeting in D'Kar,\nthe village where he grew up, Cgase was asked to conduct this opening prayer. By\nbeing asked to perform this, Cgase's position as a person with authority in the\nvillage was strengthened.\nAlignment with the church runs alongside a discourse of morality in Botswana\n(Dahl, 2009: 24), and so being part of the church also strengthened Cgase's position\nas a moral person. Being willing and able to perform the leading of prayers in\npublic meetings, as well as being recognized as someone who can perform this well,\nwas a privilege that afforded him a position inside as well as outside of the church,\nalbeit within a Ncoakhoe public. Leading public prayers is a part of social life in\nBotswana, and it is recognized as a role for those who are conversant in a Christian\nrhetoric and who are confident enough to speak in public. Moreover, through\nperforming these roles, men like Cgase are nurtured further as people who can\ntake on public speaking roles, and each time they are listened to they are recognized\nas such.\nDeveloping public speaking skills\nWhen Cgase's peers in the church group commented on how well he spoke in\npublic, the practical training of this kind of meeting was highlighted. Speaking\non a small public stage such as this student society was a practice platform for\nCgase, a place where he could learn and practise public speaking skills and tech-\nniques. The church was a relatively safe space for public speaking, as opposed to\nthe controversial space of political advocacy work that also interested Cgase. Cgase\nwas part of an NGO that lobbied the government on issues to do with Ncoakhoe,\nand where clear and confident public speaking was needed. In 2015, Cgase spoke at\nan international UNWGIP meeting, where public speaking skills were also a neces-\nsary part of the role.\nIn relation to other Ncoakhoe, it was clear that Cgase had the confidence to play\ncentral roles in public meetings. Some months earlier I had been surprised to hear\nanother Ncoakhoe man, Moses, comment that he was frustrated as his Ncoakhoe\nfriends and peers from the village were often scared and unconfident to accept the\nopportunities and invitations to speak when these were being offered. Moses\nexplained that it was not that there was a lack of opportunity to be part of inter-\nesting and exciting projects in development and education, but rather that many\nNcoakhoe refused to accept the offers. I spoke to a 22-year-old Ncoakhoe man who\nwas invited to a training programme in South Africa in 2016. While he did initially\ngo to the training centre, he told me that he was homesick and so returned back\nhome before completing his qualifications. While this was not explicitly explained\nby this man as a confidence issue, there is clearly a complex set of issues that\nNcoakhoe face when leaving their own villages, which is being translated by\nsome Ncoakhoe as being issues with confidence.\nThe difference between those who Moses described as `scared' and unconfident\nand how Cgase behaved was stark. His attitude, bodily gestures and actions\nrevealed that Cgase was not only keen to take on positions of power but was\nconfident and capable to do so, both within his village and in public arenas that\naccepted his voice but were outside of the village. Although the publics where he\ntook a central role were relatively bounded (to a student church society, or indi-\ngenous forum), his actions revealed a difference in the kind of voice that Cgase has\ndeveloped. Cgase has become used to, and particularly good at, developing his\nlanguage and bodily skills and speech patterns so that he can confidently command\na public space that is outside of a Ncoakhoe environment. This sets him apart from\nother Ncoakhoe from his and other villages.\nIn the coming months Cgase explained that he wanted to be a `leader' and\nmentioned that in later life he wanted to become a politician. In 2015, a\nFacebook post suggested that Cgase was becoming more involved with a political\nparty, although the full extent of his involvement was unclear. The training in\npublic speaking that his involvement within the church society enabled was good\npreparation for a future in politics, where public speaking will be a necessary and\nimportant skill. If he is able to be accepted within party politics in the future, it is\nlikely that he will have the confidence and conviction to publicly address the nation\nand that these formative experiences will help him to do this.\nBy speaking in certain publics, and particularly in Christian spaces, Cgase was\nrecognized as moral person, that is, one who could be heard. Church legitimized\nCgase within the public sphere and promoted his voice as meaningful and power-\nful. Being a spokesperson involves not only having the confidence and skills to\nspeak up but also being identified and recognized as someone to whom others\nlisten. For Cgase being listened to went hand-in-hand with being educated and\narticulate in the Setswana language but also in the English language. Ultimately he\nhoped his skills would lead to a career in politics as his aim was to be a politician,\nthe ultimate people's spokesperson.\nNow I turn to Khanx'a, a 30-year-old Ncoakhoe man whose voice was legit-\nimized through the kind of work he does as a civil servant. Working for the gov-\nernment is widely recognized in Botswana as legitimate and respectable\nemployment. This can be directly comparable with working for an NGO, which\nis the other obvious source of employment for many educated and ambitious\npeople in Botswana. Working in an NGO means being peripheral to the govern-\nment, whereas working for the government means being validated and approved by\nthe central governing body and authority in Botswana. To work for the govern-\nment is to be accepted and recognized as valuable. It is exactly this kind of recog-\nnition that many Ncoakhoe have lacked in their daily interactions and everyday\nencounters. However, although Khanx'a's voice was respected within his work\nspace, he also became aware that his voice was not legitimized in a broader\nsense; once he became a government worker he had to maintain a silence around\nwhat he described as `San issues', with which he had previously engaged.\nKhanx'a's voice\nThe decision that Khanx'a made to work in central government, as opposed to\nlocal government, was in part motivated by the fact that local government offices\nare prone to reproducing the same discriminatory practices found in daily life in\nthe town in which the office was situated. It is well known amongst Ncoakhoe\nmovers and shakers that employment in local government offices is not an\nattractive prospect, especially if there is an opportunity to find work elsewhere.\nKhanx'a likened working in local government offices to Ncoakhoe experiences of\nschool. Non-Ncoakhoe maintain difference between themselves and Ncoakhoe,\n`to the extent of insulting you and insulting your parents. . . . You will be told\n``you people are useless, you see the government is feeding you, RADP [Remote\nArea Development Programme \u00ad a government programme] is feeding you, blah\nblah blah''.'\nThese practices locate Ncoakhoe at the bottom of a social hierarchy and, in\nmaintaining this pecking order, delegitimize Ncoakhoe voices within the working\nenvironment. Khanx'a reveals to us the limits of using his voice. The dominant\nrules govern practices within local government offices, regardless of the\nachievements of the individual. When I asked if there were discriminatory practices\nin his current job in central government, he drew attention to the professionalism\nof the department. He explained that there was no discrimination because `[his\ndepartment] is a professional institution, where professionals are' (Khanx'a,\n2014). He suggested that local government offices are less professional, and in\nthat way are less attractive places to work, as employees are not treated as\nequals \u00ad when they speak, they are not heard.\nHowever, although as a central government worker he had an equal professional\nvoice, Khanx'a could not be heard on issues of equality for Ncoakhoe. Khanx'a\nexplained that working for (any part of) government meant withdrawing from\nbeing politically active. As he put it, his employment kept him from being `out-\nspoken' about `San issues'. Being employed by the government entailed curtailing\nhis political voice, as it might involve speaking in opposition to the government,\nwho was now his employer. Speaking out could result in him being sacked. Such\nsilencing is addressed by Eisenberg and Kymlicka (2011: 5). They note that key\npeople who are politically outspoken are often co-opted by governments who wish\nto maintain the system so that `[v]oice, from this perspective, may be understood as\ninterpreting and assigning legitimacy to institutional power' (Gorden, 1988: 292).\nFrom the perspective of Khanx'a and other Ncoakhoe, the legitimacy of their own\nvoices is superseded by the voice of their employer. More broadly, their voices are\nbeing contained within certain publics (for instance the central government office\nwhere he worked), and the broader legitimacy and efficacy of their voices beyond\nand outside these particular contexts is diminished or silenced. There was an indir-\nect threat of a loss of employment if Khanx'a's legitimacy was used for anything\noutside of the government mandate that his job stipulated. Eisenberg and\nKymlicka's criticism of co-option seems to apply to this situation.\nFurther demonstrating this view, Moses explained that it is only the Ncoakhoe\nwho have been politically outspoken and who are a potential threat to the status\nquo who have been offered government jobs. During my fieldwork Moses was\noffered employment in the local government. However, his cousin Benji advised\nhim against taking the position as it would run counter to Moses' projects of public\nadvocacy. Although Moses spoke longingly about the financial security that\nemployment in local government would provide, he eventually turned down the\njob. I wondered if he would accept a position in central government if one was\noffered to him. After all, there are many benefits of working in such a highly secure\nand financially stable job that has good welfare benefits such as a pension scheme.\nA Ncoakhoe role model\nIn contemplating his silencing, Khanx'a noted that his contribution was to act as a\nrole model for other Ncoakhoe in his home village. For him, Ncoakhoe role models\nare needed so that young Ncoakhoe students can see that other Ncoakhoe have\n`done it', i.e. been successful in completing formal education, `so they can see what\nthey can also achieve'. It is notable that Khanx'a appears to be interpreting and\nassigning legitimacy to the dominant rhetoric in Botswana, which, as Mpho\ndemonstrated at the beginning of this paper, is about being educated. Khanx'a\nmentioned that he had begun to visit his home village at Christmas with presents to\ngive to young people who have been doing well in school.\nIn a twofold way, this is revealing. Firstly, like Cgase, whose legitimate Christian\npublic voice extended only to the student group and to those in his village,\nKhanx'a's legitimate voice, which is verified through his educated and successful\nemployment, only extended as far as the government office in which he worked.\nEven the possibility of obtaining a legitimate voice through public employment was\nunderstood as curtailed if set within a local office which maintains the social and\npolitical hierarchies of the local area. These are relatively self-contained publics and\na question that these examples raise connects the subject of voice to the topic of\nlistening. Who is listening to Ncoakhoe?\nMoreover, Khanx'a's experience also reveals that even as Ncoakhoe gain legit-\nimization \u00ad the right to be heard \u00ad they face the need to adapt their voice, that is to\nsilence themselves. Khanx'a valued education, professionalism and employment in\nthe central political structure, the government. His belief in these values was strong\nenough that it permeates his own self-presentation and he sees himself as a role\nmodel who can encourage and influence other Ncoakhoe to follow his lead. He was\npart of a broader moral and social project that is identifiable within the government\nrhetoric that promotes these ideas for its citizens. In acting as a role model,\nKhanx'a reinforced the legitimacy of his voice and values, even though many of\nthem could be traced to the system that simultaneously constricted and confined his\nvoice to particular contexts, even as he followed the dominant ways of being. The\nvalues that are explicitly and implicitly carried within the dominant rhetoric were\nbeing reproduced by minority people who may not directly benefit from that\nsystem.\nHowever, the very real restrictions that Khanx'a had in not being able to act\npolitically did not diminish his sense of his own goals and aspirations. Some\nNcoakhoe criticized Khanx'a and other Ncoakhoe who they saw as undermining\nthemselves as they `lost themselves' \u00ad that is, as they lost their distinctive voices\nthrough their participation in Botswana's institutions of education and political\nstructures. While Khanx'a's voice reproduced signifiers of those in power, his com-\nmand of public situations did not correspond to his mastery of a dominant voice.\nWhen Khanx'a speaks, and whether they agree or not, it is still Ncoakhoe who\nlisten.\nConclusion\nMinority people across the globe struggle to have their voices heard. This article\nhas presented voice as being both political and performative, sounding a caution-\nary note about the need to theorize power in discussion of minorities who experi-\nence a struggle to make themselves legible and audible. Abraham's protest at the\nbeginning of the article alerts us to the fact that voice is not only in speech, and that\na person can be `silent' yet can simultaneously speak loudly. However, his protest\nalso led us to ask about the need to consider not only the power to give voice but\nabout who hears and what is heard.\nUsing speech in particular ways reveals `confidence', both the confidence of the\nindividual speaking, but also the confidence instilled in that person by those lis-\ntening. For instance the level of education that the person has is revealed in their\nmastery of both Setswana and English. The use of a Christian rhetoric can morally\nvalidate a person and make their voice central within Christian spaces. The `con-\nfident' use of the body, as shown in the way that Cgase paced up and down the\nstage in the church meeting room, revealed a man who took up the space in a way\nthat might be slightly intimidating to others who feel less confident. Using his body\nin this way instilled further confidence that Cgase and his voice were heard and\nreceived well in this space.\nYet what also emerged was that there were boundaries to the effectiveness of\nvoice \u00ad where, for instance, it was only in Christian spaces where a Christian\nrhetoric was a useful tool, or while a person might gain high status from employ-\nment, they might forfeit the ability to use their voice to make political claims. We\nneed to examine domains of silencing as well as those of speaking in discussions of\nvoices in democratic structures.\nA question raised by this paper is to ask how much of this dynamic is about\nbeing an indigenous minority and how much of it is about class, minority-status,\ngender, and age. In Botswana it is certainly evident that there is an elite class, who\nPnina Werbner (2014) describes as those who work for the government and who\nhave secured social and financial benefits for now and for the rest of their lives.\nThese people occupy upper echelons of privilege in society. There is also a privile-\nging of particular people within the political elite. There are minority groups in\nBotswana who, like Ncoakhoe, also do not have the same status as the `eight major\ntribes' who have cultural and linguistic dominance. Yet the Kalanga minority can\nand do have a political voice, and are heavily present within consensus-building\npolitical structures that are central to the functioning of Botswana's polity\n(Werbner, 2004). Moreover, my time spent with young Setswana-speaking\npeople also revealed they often lacked the confidence to speak in public, suggesting\nthat age is also a factor in assessing who is empowered. It is not only Ncoakhoe\nwho face discrimination.\nThis suggests that while this article has been framed around minority voice, the\nscope of the theory of voice that I have sought to develop is actually wider, speak-\ning to all peoples who are enmeshed within political and social hierarchies, obli-\ngations and social relationships. The dynamics that underlie the question of who\ncan be heard and what is heard when those with less power speak are at work when\nScottish Members of Parliament speak in Westminster, when white working-class\npeople go for job interviews, when middle-class people attend an elite university or\nwhen indigenous people make claims as equals within their respective nation-states.\nAt the same time, it is important to note that the racialization of those at the\nbottom holds up the whole hierarchy.\n"
