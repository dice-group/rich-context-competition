Nevertheless, literature lacks studies that address the relationship between the oral health\u00adrelated\nquality of life (OHRQoL) and emotions. The present study aimed to investigate the psychological impact of oral disorders\non people's emotional well-being, with a particular attention to gender and age differences. Two hundred twenty-nine dental\npatients in care at private dental clinics were individually tested. One hundred thirty of them were females (56.8%) and 99\nand the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) were used. Data were analyzed using Pearson's correlations, the ANOVA,\nand the Kruskal\u00adWallis test. OHRQoL showed several correlations with all the emotions explored, overcoming the well-\nknown relationship with anxiety and depression (p < .05). The degree of OHRQoL produced differences on mood states,\nwhich could appear normal, moderately altered, or psychopathological (p < .03). Furthermore, in different life stages, patients\nshowed specific OHRQoL and emotions.\n",

It is\na state of being free from mouth and facial pain, oral and throat\ncancer, oral infection and sores, periodontal (gum) disease, tooth\ndecay, tooth loss, and other diseases and disorders that limit an\nindividual's capacity in biting, chewing, smiling, speaking, and\npsychosocial wellbeing.\nAs the above-mentioned definition suggests, a number of\npsychological factors seem to be implicated. At first, it is\nwell known that the concept of quality of life (QoL) is \"mul-\ntidimensional and may be categorized within five dimen-\nsions: physical wellbeing, material wellbeing, social\nwellbeing, emotional wellbeing, and development and activ-\nAs oral health\u00adrelated quality of life (OHRQoL) is \"an\nintegral part of general health and well-being,\" it can be\nhypothesized that oral disorders may impair at least three of\nthe QoL dimensions: the physical, emotional, and social\nwell-being (\u00c5str\u00f8m, Haugejorden, Skaret, Trovik, & Klock,\nStudies have demonstrated the impact of oral health con-\nditions on physical and psychosocial dimensions (John et al.,\nMento, 2014), while there is a lack of scientific evidence\nabout the link between OHRQoL and emotions. The majority\nof existing studies have focused exclusively on the relation-\nship with dental anxiety (Kurer, Watts, Weinman, & Gower,\nFrom a psychological point of view, all emotions play a\nfundamental regulatory role in human behavior (Gross,\n1998), as they intervene in stressful situations, such as facing\nillness. Positive or negative feelings toward health problems\nmay produce different outcomes (Bowman, 2001), suggest-\ning a strict link between health and emotions. According to\nKressin, Reisine, Spiro, and Jones (2001), the personality\ntrait of \"negative affectivity,\" compared with the \"positive\naffectivity\" trait, is associated not only with a worse general\nphysical health and worse health-related quality of life\n(HRQoL) but also with specific aspects of OHRQoL.

In fact, emotions in clinical situations may become\npathological, for example, when \"there is a lack of balance\nbetween real and perceived danger\" (Settineri, Mallamace,\nFurthermore, as individuals during life span vary in their\nability to regulate emotions and cope with stress (Wang &\nSaudino, 2011), it can be hypothesized that even the relation-\nship between OHRQoL and emotions may differ across age,\neven if the existing literature seems to have neglected this\npoint.\nOn the basis of these premises, the main aim of this study\nwas to investigate the relationship between all emotions\n(Tension, Depression, Anger, Fatigue, Vigor, and Confusion)\nand the patient's OHRQoL, with a particular attention for\ndifferent life stages.\nThe hypotheses are the following:\nHypothesis 1: Poor OHRQoL is linked not only to anxi-\nety and depression but also to other mood states.\nHypothesis 2: In different life stages, there are different\nOHRQoL degrees and different emotions.\nHypothesis 3: Different OHRQoL degrees produce dif-\nferent expression of emotions, until psychopathology.\nMethod\nInstruments\nFor the evaluation, two questionnaires were used.\nThe POMS is a self-assessment mood scale consisting\nparticipant has to indicate on a Likert-type scale from 0\n(not at all) to 4 (very much) as the last week has experi-\nenced the moods listed. The instrument consists of six\nsubscales: (a) Tension\u00adAnxiety, (b) Depression\u00adDejection,\n(c) Aggression\u00adAnger, (d) Vigor\u00adActivity, (e) Fatigue\u00ad\nIndolence, and (f) Confusion\u00adBewilderment. The partici-\npant obtains a score for each subscale, which can be\ntransformed into standard scores (T points). Being a stan-\ndardized instrument, on both clinical and nonclinical sam-\nples, it allows to discriminate between normal range\nThe Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14)--Italian ver-\nitems (Slade, 1997). As described by Meredith, Strong, Ford,\nand Branjerdporn (2016), each pair of item captures a specific\ndimension of the perception of the state of oral health: (a)\nFunctional Limitation (e.g., difficulty chewing), (b) Physical\nPain (e.g., sensitivity of teeth), (c) Psychological Discomfort\n(e.g., self-consciousness), (d) Physical Disability (e.g.,\nchanges to diet), (e) Psychological Disability (e.g., reduced\nability to concentrate), (f) Social Disability (e.g., avoiding\nsocial interaction), and (g) Handicap (e.g., being unable to\nwork productively). Respondents were asked to indicate how\nfrequently they experienced each problem within a reference\nperiod of 12 months on a 5-point Likert-type scale--never\n(score 0), hardly ever (score 1), occasionally (score 2), fairly\noften (score 3), and very often (score 4). Highest valor corre-\nsponds to greater discomfort related to oral health; a non-\npathological condition is instead closer to zero.\nProcedure\nThe study was in conformity with ethical principles of\nresearch as it was conducted according to the Declaration of\nHelsinki. Each participant was informed in advance about\nmethods and study aims and answered to the issued question-\nnaires only after signing informed consent. Data were col-\nlected in the period from January to May 2013. The\nadministration was conducted by operators who had a brief\ntraining for the administration of psychological tests. The\ncompletion of the questionnaires required from 15 to 30 min,\nbeing two self-report measures. Data were analyzed using\nthe Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 17.0).\nTo verify our hypothesis, we performed Pearson's correla-\ntions, the ANOVA, and the Kruskal\u00adWallis test. The reliabil-\nity of questionnaire used obtained a Cronbach's alpha value\nResults\nSample\nThe whole sample consisted of 263 dental patients, all\nbelonging to private dental surgeries of the center of Messina,\nSicily (240,000 habitants). We included all participants with\nmild or moderate dental problems (gingivitis, cavities,\nplaque, sensitive teeth, halitosis, denture discomfort, etc.)\naccording to the judgment of the dentist. For the analysis, we\nconsidered only the valid cases: 130 of them were females\n(see Table 1).\nTo verify any difference between life stages, patients aged\nthree age groups, based on age classes: (a) young patients,\nand (c) old age patients, from 51 to 83 years. The chi-square\nvalues according to age and gender were not significant,\nindicating that groups were well balanced. The measure of\nsampling adequacy met the criteria for statistical analysis\nshows descriptive statistics of the scores obtained by dental\npatients on the OHIP-14 and POMS.\nSettineri et al. 3\nEach dimension of OHIP-14 was referred to a pair of\nitems (e.g., Functional Limitation, Items 1 and 2; Physical\nPain, Items 3 and 4, etc.); subsequently, scores range from a\nminimum of 0 to a maximum of 8. As regards the POMS\nfrom raw scores, we obtained T points: Scores ranging from\n40 to 60 are conventionally considered normal. In our dental\npatients sample, each subscale scores exceed the norm (mini-\nmum 6, maximum 98), even if the mean is contained in the\nconventional range.\nHypothesis 1: Poor OHRQoL is linked not only to anxiety and\ndepression but also to other mood states.To verify our first\nhypothesis, we performed Pearson's correlation (see Table 3).\nAll the POMS subscales were positively related to OHIP-14\nitems. Oral health dimensions were significantly related not\nonly to the well-known constructs of Anxiety and Depression\nbut also with Aggression, Fatigue, and Confusion, with the\nexception for Vigor subscales. The higher the level of emo-\ntional psychopathology, the worse the OHRQoL. Further-\nmore, both physical and psychological aspects of oral health\nwere significantly linked to mood states.\nHypothesis 2: In different life stages, there are different OHRQoL\ndegrees and different emotions. Second, we excluded any pos-\nsible significant effect of gender by performing the Student t\ntest for independent samples. On the contrary, the ANOVA\nrevealed significant difference in the OHIP between age\nclasses, as shown in Table 4.\nAdult patients aged from 31 to 50 years had the higher\nscores and hence the worse oral health profile in almost all\nsubscales, with the exception of Functional Limitation in\nwhich old age patients were more compromised.\nAs regards POMS, there were no differences between\nmales and females and between age classes. In the whole\nsample, 66 patients showed a level of Tension upper normal,\nfor Confusion.\nHypothesis 3: Different OHRQoL degrees produce different\nexpression of emotions, until psychopathology. According to the\nclassification of the total score of OHIP-14, one hundred\nforty-four patients obtained a score lower than 14, which\nindicates the absence of oral health problems; 79 patients\nobtained a total score between 15 and 41, on the average; and\nonly six patients obtained a score higher than 42, showing\noral health problems. To verify our third hypothesis, we per-\nform the nonparametric Kruskal\u00adWallis test (Table 4).\nPatients who obtained a total score on the average (from\n15 to 41) reported increased feelings of Depression and\nConfusion. Instead, patients who obtained OHIP-14 total\nscores higher than 42 reported more Aggression and Fatigue.\nDiscussion and Conclusions\nAt first, as general result, all mood states subscales resulted\npositively related to oral health dimensions, with the excep-\ntion for the Vigor, the unique positive mood state. Oral health\ndimensions were strictly linked not only to the well-known\nconstructs of Anxiety and Depression but also with\nAggression, Anger, and Confusion. This result clearly con-\nfirmed our hypothesis: The perception of the patient's\nOHRQoL was connected to an emotional spectrum, broader\nthan known, ranging from adequately modulated mood, until\nemotional dysregulation. In fact, in 19% to 37% of cases, the\npatients tested showed mood alterations in association with\nOHRQoL problems. Specifically, we observed that patients\nwho obtained a total oral health score on the average reported\nincreased feelings of Depression and Confusion. Instead,\npatients who scored lower in the oral health profile, suggest-\ning a poor OHRQoL, reported more Aggression and Fatigue.\nDifferent degrees of perceived severity of the OHRQoL con-\nditions were connected to different emotional shades. A pos-\nsible explanation is that mood states may also depend on\ncognitive evaluation of oral health impairment (i.e., having\ncoping abilities, self-efficacy, danger perceived, etc.), but\nthis pathway has not yet been investigated in detail. One of\nthe few attempts to draw the association between oral health\nand mood states is the Meridian Tooth Chart developed by\nWilson and Williams (2011) (see Figure 1). The authors have\ncompiled a list of the associations between teeth, organs, and\npositive or negative mood states. Although fascinating, this\ntheory borrowed from oriental medicine had never been the\nsubject of empirical studies: The psychometric investigation\nof the relationship between teeth and emotions may even\nserve as a first scientific evidence to support this intuitive\nassociation.\nRegarding the issue of age differences, we observed that\nthe most significantly impaired oral health dimension for\nelderly patients is Functional Limitation which was in\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics of OHIP-14 and POMS.\nNote. OHIP-14 = Oral Health Impact Profile; POMS = Profile of Mood\nStates.\n4 SAGE Open\nassociation with specific mood states: Depression, low Vigor\nand Confusion. These results are consistent with the findings\nof similar studies conducted by Friedlander, Friedlander,\nGallas, and Velasco (2003). The authors found an association\nbetween oral health and late life depression (LLD): Old age\npatients with LLD seem to develop behavioral patterns char-\nacterized by \"compromised social function and impaired\nself-maintenance skills (e.g., bathing, dressing, hygiene).\"\nThe depressed, who lose pleasure and interest for daily life\nactivities, lose even the interest in personal oral hygiene.\nSimilarly, Macentee, Hole, and Stolar (1997) found, through\na structured interview, that in older adults, mouth has a par-\nticular significance related to three interacting themes: com-\nfort, hygiene, and health. An amount of studies, coherent\nTable 3. Differences in Oral Health Impact Profile Between Age Classes (OHIP-14).\n M SD M SD M SD F Significance\nNote. In bold are statistically significant values.

On the contrary, adult patients of our sample aged\nfrom 31 to 50 years scored worse oral health profile, in\nalmost all subscales. These results can be explained by the\nepidemiological distribution of oral health\u00adrelated problems\nand its impact on the specified age range. According to\nNuttall, Steele, Pine, White, and Pitts (2001), \"over half\n(51%) of dentate adults said they had been affected in some\nway by their oral health, and in 8% of cases the impact was\nsufficient to have reduced their quality of life\" (p. 121).\nLocker and Miller (1994) comparing different age groups of\ndental patients on self-reported oral health status obtained\nthat the initial hypothesis that younger participants would\nreport lower problems on oral health indicators has been not\nsupported. On all measures except ability to chew, younger\nparticipants were as likely to be compromised by oral condi-\ntions as older participants. On the contrary, in the present\nstudy, younger patients showed the lower levels of oral\nhealth impairment and adequate emotional regulation.\nNevertheless, we have reason to think that the oral compro-\nmission of adolescents and young adults could be tied not so\nmuch for the physical aspects, such as pain or discomfort,\nassessed in this study, but above to other oral health aspects\nbelonging to the general health QoL such as dental aesthetics\nperceptions and dysmorphic levels, as suggested by literature\nIt is also necessary to discuss issues surrounding the\ngender. Both in OHIP-14 and in the POMS, gender differ-\nences were not found. On the contrary, several studies\nhave shown that males and females have a different per-\nception of oral health status and oral health behavior in\nfavor of females. Young woman \"had better oral health\nFigure 1. Meridian Tooth Chart.\n6 SAGE Open\nbehaviour and more factors associated with their oral\nhealth in comparison with young men\" (Tada & Hanada,\nhealth as having a greater impact than men on their QoL in\ngeneral, having both a greater negative or positive impact\n(McGrath & Bedi, 1999). Nevertheless, good general\nhealth habits correlate with higher oral health behaviors in\nmales as well. For this reason, Fukai, Takaesu, and Maki\n(1998) hypothesized that \"gender specificities in oral\nhealth depend on individual attitudes to oral health and\nAlthough the findings have offered a first level of study of\nthe psychopathology of emotions in dental patients, we must\npoint out some limitations of the study. First, the sample\nshowed the limits of generalizability, having been sourced in\nthe same geographic region, because there are some evidence\nthat oral health is influenced also by cultural background.\nFor example, in Australia, those aged between 30 and 49\nyears showed the worst oral health profile scores; in the\nUnited Kingdom, instead, patients below 30 years showed\nthe highest scores, reporting the worse oral health quality\nIt would also be interesting to verify, both from the psy-\nchological and the dental point of view, whether the discom-\nfort felt by the patient is congruent with the severity attributed\nby the dentist or whether there are differences attributable to\nthe degree of invasiveness of the treatment.\nIn conclusion, the results of this study showed a signifi-\ncant relationship between the perception of the patient's oral\nhealth and the mood states experienced. This knowledge\nmay help to better understand the psychological mechanisms\ninvolved in the treatment compliance. The attention about\nthe role of emotions in oral health life involves both psy-\nchologists and dentists, who have to safeguard the psychoso-\ncial, physical, and emotional well-being of dental patients.\nThe teeth moreover have a symbolic value in the emotional\nlife. The mouth, the main organ of our ability to express, can\nbe read scientifically as an organ to cure, or symbolically as\npart of the body capable of recording and expressing our psy-\nchoemotional experience.\n"
