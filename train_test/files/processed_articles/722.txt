This downward trend has been con-\ncentrated among young adults. Today, unlike\ntwenty years ago, there is a substantial gap in\nemployer-sponsored coverage between young\nadults and their elders.\nHow should policymakers respond to this?\nThat depends critically on whether these low\nrates are transitory or permanent. If young\nadults gain insurance coverage as they grow\nolder, then policymakers need to develop\nmodels that serve them during their transition\nto employer-sponsored insurance. If, con-\nversely, low coverage rates in young adult-\nhood presage continuing low rates, policy-\nmakers need to develop not age-specific but\ncohort-specific models that address perma-\nnent problems.\nEmployer-sponsored coverage is an out-\ncome of the functioning of both the labor mar-\nket and the health insurance market. Prior\nstudies have generally concluded that labor-\nmarket changes, such as shifts in the distribu-\ntion of employment across industries, have\nhad only minor effects on coverage.1 Most of\nthe change in employer-sponsored insurance\nappears to be a consequence of increases in\nthe overall cost of coverage and in the em-\nployee contribution requirement.2\nOur focus here is on the extent to which\nlow (or high) rates of coverage among young\nadults persist within cohorts over time. This\napproach parallels a large literature in labor\neconomics that has examined the earnings ex-\nperience of cohorts over time. Earnings in the\nlabor market tend to grow with experience\nand to improve as the economy becomes more\nproductive. Many researchers have found,\nhowever, that the unusually large U.S. popu-\nlation cohorts born during the baby boom ex-\nperienced persistently depressed wages rela-\ntive to cohorts that preceded them--even as\nthey grew older and the economy prospered.3\nDeclines in earnings were sharpest for baby\nboomers who did not graduate from college.\nDespite economywide improvements in pro-\nductivity, these workers never did as well as\nprior generations.\nIn this paper we replicate the methods\nused in the analyses of cohort earnings to ana-\nlyze changes in employer-sponsored health\ninsurance rates along three lines: the effect of\nsecular time trends, the effect of growing\nolder and gaining labor-market experience,\nand the effect of birth cohort.\n\u00a92001ProjectHOPE\u00adThePeople-to-PeopleHealth Foundation,Inc.\nSherry Glied is associate professor and head of the Division of Health Policy and Management at Columbia\nUniversity's Mailman School of Public Health.

We define having em-\nployer-sponsored coverage to include anyone\ncovered by such coverage, whether in one's\nown name or through a family member.\nThe CPS health insurance questions\nperiod. In general, these changes had little ef-\nfect on the employer-sponsored coverage\nquestions.5 All of our analyses include a vari-\ndummy variables capture any residual effects\nof questionnaire changes that affect the entire\npopulation. All analyses are weighted using\nthe CPS weights.\nTo compare changes in health insurance to\nchanges in earnings, we repeat our analyses\nfor health insurance using information on\nweekly wages. We adjust all wages for infla-\ntion to 1980 dollars using the all-items Con-\nsumer Price Index (CPI).6\nWe construct cohorts in the CPS data by\nfollowing successive age groups over time. For\nexample, the cohort born in 1952 was thirty\ncohort were five years older. The experience\nof the group is then captured by the experi-\nence of thirty-five-year-olds in 1987. In gen-\neral, the sample of thirty-five-year-olds in 1987\nis representative of the same population as the\nsample ofthirty-year-olds in 1982. We restrict\nthe sample for regression to cohorts born be-\nten observations for each cohort in the data.\nIn further analyses, we compare the expe-\nrience of different education groups. We de-\nfine these groups according to highest level of\neducation completed: (1) did not complete\nhigh school; (2) received a high school di-\nploma but had no further education; (3) at-\ntended college or postsecondary technical\ntraining but did not receive a degree; (4) re-\nceived a college degree or higher.\nWe perform the decomposition by com-\nputing linear regressions that include age\ncomponents, time-trend components, and co-\nhort components. We specify the age compo-\nnent by including terms for ages 26\u00ad30, ages\nThe age components are measured relative to\ntwenty-five-year-olds.7 We are interested in\nlearning whether the transition to employer\ncoverage has changed over time. We test this\nby including a second set ofterms for the same\nage groups in the period after 1988 (the mid-\npoint of our sample). These terms show\nwhether the effect of being ages 26\u00ad30 is dif-\ntime-trend components by including a\ndummy variable for each CPS year included in\nour analysis. We measure the trend compo-\nnents relative to 1989. We specify the cohort\ncomponents using a series of dummy variables\nfor each birth cohort year. We measure cohort\ncomponents relative to the cohort born in 1955.\nThe coefficients we estimate in these\nanalyses describe relative coverage rates.\nRather than listing them, we plot the coeffi-\ncients in a series of graphs that describe\ntrends over age, time, or cohort (after control-\nling for each of the other variables). The verti-\ncal axes of these graphs show the estimated\ndifference in insurance coverage associated\nwith different values of that component (age,\ntime trend, or cohort) relative to the base\ncategory for that component.\nStudy Results\nn Changes in age profile. Exhibit 1 shows\nhow levels of employer-sponsored health cov-\nerage change as people age. The exhibit shows\ntwo profiles, one for the period before 1989\nand one for the period 1989 and beyond. The\nupward slope of both age profiles shows that\nlevels of employer-sponsored health insur-\nance increase as people age. However, exam-\nining the difference between the two profiles\nreveals that the rate at which health insurance\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : T R E N D S\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y / F e b r u a r y 2 0 0 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The post-1988 profile is steeper than the\npre-1989 profile, which suggests that after\n1988 employer-sponsored health insurance\ncoverage levels increased more rapidly be-\ntween the ages of twenty-five and thirty-four.9\nThe shift in the age profile suggests that\nsome of the decline in coverage experienced\nby today's younger adults will be made up as\nthey grow older. Holding other factors con-\nstant, group coverage of today's twenty-five-\nyear-olds is likely to increase nearly eight per-\ncentage points by the time they reach their\nmid-thirties. The changing age profile, how-\never, does not fully explain the changes in\nhealth insurance coverage over time.\nn Changes over time. Exhibit 2 shows\nthe pattern of employer-sponsored health\ncoverage over time relative to 1988 levels. The\npattern over time reflects changes in eco-\nnomic conditions and changes to the CPS\nhealth insurance questionnaire. The apparent\nmost certainly reflects concurrent question-\nnaire changes.10 The data also suggest that\nhad little effect in this population. These re-\nsults suggest that the decline in health insur-\nance coverage over this period ended in 1994,\nafter controlling for cohort and age effects.\nn Effects of cohort of birth. Finally, we\nexamine the effects of cohort of birth on the\npattern of employer-sponsored health cover-\nage. Exhibit 3 shows the percentage-point\nchange in coverage relative to the cohort born\nin 1955. Health insurance coverage rates\npeaked for the cohort born in 1947, just as the\nbaby boom began. There has been a steady\ndecline in coverage for subsequent cohorts. At\neach age, health insurance coverage rates for\nthe cohort born in 1947 have been about three\npercentage points higher than rates for the\nn Breakdown by education groups.\nNext, we repeat the analyses above for each of\nthe four education groups listed earlier. We\nfind a large and statistically significant change\nin the age profile of employer-sponsored\nhealth coverage after 1988 for the least-\neducated group (controlling, once again, for\nyear and cohort effects), a small but signifi-\ncant change for those with college education,\nand a small and insignificant change in the age\nprofile for groups with high school and some\nSOURCE: Regression coefficients from analysis of the 1980\u00ad1999 Current Population Survey that includes year and\ncohort effects.\na Percent change in employer-sponsored coverage relative to twenty-five-year-old before 1989.\nAge Profiles For   Coverage Before And After 1989\nPercent changea\nAge (years)\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : T R E N D S\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 2 0 , N u m b e r 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The\ndifference between coverage rates at age\ntwenty-five and at age thirty-five is about six\npercentage points greater in the later period\nfor those with less than a high school educa-\ntion and about two percentage points greater\nfor those with a high school education. For\ngroups with a high school education or less,\nhowever, the entire age profile, while becom-\ning steeper, also shifts downward. This shift\nis so large that the earlier and later profiles do\nnot cross within the sample age range.\nThe time-series profile of coverage by edu-\ncation group, controlling for age and cohort\neffects, is described in Exhibit 4. Over time,\nthe propensity of the most highly educated\nworkers to obtain employer-sponsored health\ninsurance coverage has remained flat.11 By\ncontrast, the least-educated workers have ex-\nperienced a continuous decline in the propen-\nsity to hold employer-sponsored coverage\nover time. Comparing this graph to the time\ntrend of the unemployment rate reveals that\ndeclines in the unemployment rate are corre-\nlated with increases in coverage for all but the\nmost-educated groups.12 For the least edu-\ncated, however, the effect of cyclical improve-\nments has been swamped by the downward\ntrend in coverage over time.\nExhibit 5 illustrates cohort patterns of cov-\nerage for these four education groups, control-\nling for age and year effects. Health insurance\ncoverage has remained relatively flat in co-\nhorts born since 1950 among those in each\ngroup except those with a high school di-\nploma. Cohorts of high school\u00adeducated\nworkers born since 1947 have seen steady de-\nclines in their propensity to hold health insur-\nance, with a slight uptick in the youngest co-\nhorts in the sample.\nExplaining The Pattern:\nComparison To Wage Effects\nIn designing policy, it would be useful to\nknow whether health insurance coverage pat-\nterns parallel changes in earnings.

If, however, earnings declines have\nparalleled coverage declines, cohorts without\ncoverage are also likely to lack the earnings to\ntake advantage of market reforms.\nWe repeat our analysis to examine the age,\ntime-trend, and cohort patterns on weekly\nwages. First, we find that the experience pro-\nfile in earnings fully replicates the profile for\nhealth insurance. Second, we find a down-\nward trend over time in earnings for less-edu-\ncated workers. However, the decline in cover-\nage rates is much steeper than the decline in\nwages. For college-educated workers, earn-\nings rise over time, but coverage is flat. The\ndifference in the time-trend patterns for earn-\nings and health insurance across all groups\nreflects the rising cost of health insurance\nrelative to earnings over time.13 We also find\nthat health insurance is more sensitive to\nbusiness-cycle fluctuations than are wages.\nThis is not surprising, since health insurance\nis contingent on employment, and employ-\nment changes tend to be stronger than wage\nchanges over a business cycle.\nThird, we find, as does the prior literature,\na decline in the earnings of cohorts of high\nschool\u00adeducated workers over time.14 The de-\ncline in earnings for this group is less pro-\nnounced than is the decline we find in the\nhealth insurance data. One explanation for\nthe more pronounced decline in benefits than\nin wages for high school\u00adeducated cohorts\nborn after 1950 may be the decline in unioni-\nzation.15 Union jobs are much more likely to\noffer benefits than are nonunion jobs, and\nhigh school\u00adeducated workers are more likely\nthan other groups are to have been affected by\nthe decline in private-sector unionization.\nAs in the health insurance data, there is\nlittle pronounced cohort pattern for workers\nwith less than a high school education.

This divergence suggests\nthat persons in this group are most likely to be\nable to take advantage of market reforms that\nmake it easier to buy health insurance.\nInterpreting The Results\nThe results described above can best be un-\nderstood by considering their implications for\nthe health insurance experiences of different\ngroups. Consider, for example, the group of\nhigh school\u00adeducated adults born in 1956.\nThe age pattern for this group suggests that\ntheir health coverage should have increased\nby four percentage points between ages\ntwenty-five and thirty-five. The time-trend\ncomponent, however, shows that employer-\nsponsored insurance for high school\u00ad\neducated adults fell six percentage points be-\nwere twenty-five years old) and 1991 (when\nthey were thirty-five). The combination of\nthese two effects meant that for this cohort,\ninsurance coverage rates at age thirty-five\nwere actually lower than their rates were at\nage twenty-five. Rather than gaining em-\nployer-sponsored insurance coverage with\nage, this cohort actually lost it.\nNow consider the high school\u00adeducated\ncohort born seven years later, in 1963. When\nthis cohort turned twenty-five (in 1988), eco-\nnomic conditions overall for high school\u00ad\neducated workers were much as they were\nfive years earlier. Nonetheless, this later co-\nhort experienced a substantial decline in eco-\nnomic well-being and health insurance cover-\nage compared with the 1956 cohort. At age\ntwenty-five, their health insurance rates were\nfully 4.2 percentage points lower than those of\ntheir older counterparts were. The time-\nseries profile for high school\u00adeducated work-\ners declined over the next ten years, so that,\nagain, this cohort had lower rates of coverage\nat age thirty-five than at age twenty-five.\nPolicy Implications\nThe existence of age-related and cyclical com-\nponents of coverage has several implications\nfor policy.

Second, coverage rates\nmove with the business cycle. These fluctua-\ntions are sharpest for poorly educated work-\ners. Policies that offer ways for these workers\nto obtain or maintain coverage during down-\nturns could smooth cyclical patterns.\nThe results described above also docu-\nment, however, that there is a strong perma-\nnent component to changes in employer-\nsponsored health coverage over the past two\ndecades. This affects health insurance plan-\nning decisions.

Rather than targeting an age group\nor a group undergoing a distinct economic\ntransition, policies need to make insurance\navailable for extended periods to people de-\nfined by income, not age or employment\nstatus. This coverage might be offered\nthrough employers or through other venues\nthat we have not considered in this paper,\nsuch as private nongroup or public coverage.17\nThe depressed earnings of this group suggest\nthat the private nongroup market is unlikely\nto be a viable source of coverage, unless sub-\nstantial subsidies are offered. Public coverage\nmight be an option, but this coverage is gener-\nally not available to working adults ages\ntwenty-five to fifty. Subsidies that enable\nworkers to purchase coverage through their\nown employers also may help members of co-\nhorts with poor health insurance prospects.\nFinally, the decline in employer-sponsored\nhealth insurance coverage across cohorts of\nworkers with only a high school education\nshould be considered when the overall eco-\nnomic well-being of this group is being evalu-\nated. For these Americans, declines in insur-\nance coverage exacerbate an already negative\ntrend in income.\nThisresearchwassupported by an InvestigatorAward\n(Glied) from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\nThe authors thank Dan O'Flaherty for his helpful\ncomments.\nNOTES\n1.
