In particular, we investigate how the concept of `the child's best inter-\nests' is produced as a resource in mediation settings (by parents and mediators). At which\npoints in the discussion is this invoked, and with what effect? We analyse extracts from\nfamily mediation sessions, selected from three pairs of separated or separating parents\nattempting to resolve child contact or residency disputes through mediation. How are\nchildren's needs and interests occasioned in mediation talk? When and how do parents\nrefer to their child's interests, and/or to the more abstract concept of `a child's best inter-\nests', and how is this responded to? We are interested in how the concept of the child's\nbest interests becomes a resource for parental positions and arguments about contact, resi-\ndency and parenting agreements after separation. Does the appeal to considering a child's\nbest interests progress the mediation talk in a way which enables conflict resolution? Is\nthe concept of a child's best interests a useful one for mediators to focus on?\nOne of the key stated aims of mediation, and of the law concerning post-separation\narrangements for children (Children Act 1989 s 1) is a focus on a child's welfare or best\ninterests. Studies of therapeutic processes have found that children's interests are rou-\ntinely sidelined or represented (Hutchby and O'Reilly, 2010), and this has been found\nin mediation too. Dingwall and Greatbatch (1991), reporting on a study of UK media-\ntion in the 1980s, argued that dispute resolution was a parent-centred process with par-\nents and conciliators making few references to child welfare. However, a generation on,\nthe findings from the 1980s study may not reflect current mediation practices, views of\nchild well-being or parenting norms. Trinder et al. (2010) looked at in-court concilia-\ntion, using conversation analysis (CA) to study how the child's needs and wishes were\ndiscussed by parents and conciliators (sessions recorded in 2004\u00ad2005), concluding\nthat `the needs and wishes of these children are regularly invoked by adults, but as a\nstrategic and contingent argumentative resource, rather than as the starting point for the\ndecision-making process' (p. 234). A consistent feature in their data was that parents\nfocused in talk on their needs and wishes as parents \u00ad in contrast to the `official' idea of\nthe child's needs being focused on. Conciliators also attended to this and focused on the\nparents' feelings about not seeing their child. Trinder et al. conclude `The challenge for\nthe next decade is to find child-centred methods of routinely including children in dis-\npute resolution processes'. A decade on from this research, despite consistent attention\non the importance of prioritising children's needs in dispute resolution processes, chil-\ndren are rarely directly included (Barlow et al., 2014; Walker and Lake-Carroll, 2014),\nwhich leads to the child's voice or interest usually being represented by its parents, or\nbrought up by the practitioner, in dispute resolution processes. It is therefore relevant to\nconsider how children's views, needs, or interests are discussed in their absence in the\nmediation setting.\nThe data come from a three-year, Economic and Social Research Council-(ESRC)\nfunded study `Mapping Paths to Family Justice'undertaken by the Universities of Exeter\nand Kent. The project's central aim was to provide evidence about the awareness, usage,\nexperience and outcomes of out-of-court Family Dispute Resolution (FDR) processes.\nWe used several research methods to address these aims. First, we conducted a national\nsurvey of out-of-court FDR awareness and experiences, and second, an individual inter-\nview study with 95 people who had experienced an out-of-court FDR process between\nphase of the study, we recorded examples of each FDR process. We recorded five com-\nplete mediation processes (four concerning children's matters and one financial; nine\nsessions in total), as well as three collaborative law processes (11 sessions in total) and\nfive first interviews within solicitor negotiation processes. The overall project findings\nfocus on the data from some of the recorded mediation sessions. Notably, despite our\nefforts to include experiences of child-inclusive mediation (both in interviews with prac-\ntitioners and parties, and our recorded sessions), there were few actual instances of this\n\u00ad only two interviewed parties had experienced this. Although two-thirds of the media-\ntors interviewed had trained in child-inclusive mediation, they either rarely practised it\nor had qualms about doing so (Ewing et al., 2015). For example, one mediator (and\nsolicitor) said that `I have never found the need to bring children into mediation because\nmy practice seems to work quite well on the basis that the children's voice is heard but\nit's the parents that will bring that voice'. Another mediator and solicitor said,\nI guess I would be hoping that the parents could be reliable consultants with their own children\nand what their wishes are, because if they aren't reliable then the thing is fairly doomed from\nthe start and there is a lot of work to be done.\nSo, the child's voice\u00ador wishes\u00adis assumed or hoped to be represented by the parents\nin the mediation process. In this article, we draw on data from the mediation processes\ninvolving children's matters \u00ad and in particular on data from three sets of parents \u00ad to\ninvestigate when and how talk about children's best interests is occasioned during medi-\nation sessions, and what effect this has on the process.\nAnalytic approach\nWe used a Discursive Psychology approach, drawing on elements of critical discourse\nanalysis and CA to understand how participants display understandings in everyday, or\n`naturally-occurring', talk (Edwards and Potter, 2001; McHoul and Rapley, 2005).\nDiscursive approaches have no recognisable `method'in terms of formalised procedures,\nbut share a set of assumptions about language practices \u00ad an `analytic mentality'\n(Schenkein, 1978). A Discursive Psychology approach typically `starts with the catego-\nries, constructions and orientations through which a sense of agency, say, or severe dis-\ntress, or a moment of understanding are displayed in a piece of interaction in a particular\nsetting' (Wiggins and Potter, 2007: 73). Language is both constructed and constructive;\nit is action oriented and situated within a particular sequential environment \u00ad words are\nunderstood according to what precedes and follows them. The analytic focus is on exam-\nining discursive practices in naturalistic materials, including institutional talk. We view\nmediation as an institutional practice in that talk in mediation settings is normally goal\noriented with particular forms of talk permitted; moreover, participants attend to their\ninstitution-relevant identities \u00ad for example, mediator, parent, ex-partner (Drew and\nHeritage, 1992). In discursive approaches, a few cases, analysed in detail, are assumed to\nshed light on widespread practices and assumptions, and also possibly highlight future\nareas to be investigated on a larger scale (McHoul and Rapley, 2005). Discursive\nPsychology's emphasis on the construction of specific versions encourages the researcher\nto consider the practices that those versions are part of, and the particular work that they\nperform (Edwards and Potter, 2001). For this analysis, we consider how parents talk in\nmediation sessions about parenting, child residency, gender equality, without taking\nthese claims as facts about the family or individuals'experience. How do people draw on\nresources, such as claims about parenting behaviour, or a child's best interests. How are\nclaims built up? (Heritage, 2012). At what point in a discussion do participants draw on\na resource, and what effect does this have on the progression of the talk? How does the\nmediation process \u00ad or the institution \u00ad produce certain forms of arguments and make\nother types of talk less likely?\nMediation processes have been the subject of a number of discursively oriented\nstudies, and in particular from CA, which have focused on how mediators develop\n`de-escalatory practices' (Greatbatch and Dingwall, 1997), how mediators attempt to\nmaintain a stance of neutrality (Jacobs, 2002) and how neighbourhood mediators\nwork to obtain a `solution' (Stokoe, 2015). These studies noted gaps between norma-\ntive ideals and actual practice, as mediators face multiple competing demands which\nlead to `interactional difficulties'. So, while neutrality may be aimed for, CA analy-\nses have demonstrated how the mediator manages this ideal in interaction, while\nsimultaneously progressing the task of achieving outcomes and deflecting tension.\nGarcia (2010) demonstrated how participants actively align themselves with their\nmediator in neighbourhood disputes, using `interactional competence', so while offi-\ncially it is the mediator's job to balance power between disputants, in practice par-\nticipants shift the power. A discursive analysis avoids making inferences about\nparticipants' inner beliefs, or moral judgements on participants' truthfulness, but\nviews talk as a participatory activity. Parents' assertions that they want to do their\nbest by their children are treated as statements produced to demonstrate competence\nAnalysis\nExtracts were selected from the nine recorded mediation sessions on two related criteria.\nWe looked for instances of parents talking about the `best interests' of the child, and also\nfor talk that included related concepts, in particular abstract ideas about child well-being,\nwhat is good for children in general. We use extracts from mediation sessions with three\nheterosexual couples. In this data, talk about a child's best interests cropped up when\nparents were in dispute about where children should live after parental separation, and\nhow much contact each parent would have:\nExtract 1. Separated couple, Jack and Kerry,1 with a woman mediator\nAn hour into their first mediation session, the father (Jack) has been describing his idea of how\ntheir child will be cared for during time spent at his house.\n 1. Med So it looks as though [you\n 2. Kerry [So it looks as though I have got to sit down yeah, I\n 3. have got to mediate, I have got to roll over, I have got to make the effort\n 4. and do things for both of us but what I get nothing out of it and I am still\n 5. left like yeah.\n 6. Med You are not rolling over and it's not about what you get out of it it's about\n 7. Josh and it's about Josh having [a healthy relationship with both of you.\n 8. Kerry [Yeah but alright [yeah so ok ok ok I don't\n 9. mean what I get out of it ok but so everything I want (.) right (.) (sniffs)\n10. everything I want for my son I can't have. (0.2) [what he can't have\n11. Jack [It's not what you want for\n12. your son it's what you want for your[self.\n13. Kerry [What I want for my son I am saying I\n15. Jack No you haven't.\n16. Kerry Oh ok alright I wouldn't be HERE now if I was thinking about myself\n19. Kerry I wouldn't be here now. I'm gonna walk out in a minute.\nHere, the mother, Kerry, produces a strong statement, `I have got to ... ' repeated four\ntimes. `but what I get nothing out of it'. The mediator responds with a direct rebuttal of\nKerry's claim. `You are not rolling over' and follows this up with a rebuke `it's not about\nwhat you get out of it it's about Josh'. In the context of mediation, this exchange has two\nnoteworthy aspects. The direct rebuttal of a participant's claim and moral rebuke are in\ncontravention of the assumption of neutrality \u00ad the mediator backs up her strong rebuke\nwith a claim about what mediation is and is not about: `it's about Josh ... '. The institu-\ntional business of mediation is shown by the mediator to be about the child, and about the\nchild having `a healthy relationship' with both parents. In this way, the centrality of the\nchild's interests is attended to by the mediator, but in doing so she had to override core\nmediation values of neutrality and objectivity (Greatbatch and Dingwall, 1997, 1999).\nKerry suggests that this means that `everything I want for my son I can't have', and\nquickly reframes this as `he can't have'. At this point Jack, the father, picks up on this\nand mirrors the mediator in rebuking Kerry for her focus on herself. Kerry's response to\nthis explicitly links what she wants for her son with having `my son's interests at heart'\n(capitals denote shouting). In fact, she claims, her wishes for her son are based on his\ninterests. She offers evidence \u00ad her participation in the mediation process.\nIn this extract, the mediator introduces the focus on the child at a point of tension in\nthe discussion, and the parents take this up as a resource, with Jack suggesting that Kerry\nis prioritising her own wishes, which rouses Kerry to a defence for which she uses the\nterm `my son's interest'. We see how here the mediator's attempt to focus the discussion\non the child's interest is not a successful tool for calming the discussion, but rather the\nopposite\u00adit becomes a challenge to the mother, and the father takes up the term enthusi-\nastically as a strategic way of demonstrating his ex-partner's (inappropriate) focus on\nherself:\nExtract 2: Separated couple Nicola and Jordan with a woman mediator\n 1. Med OK. So what (.). What um obviously I'm gonna come back to you in a\n 2. moment Nicola, but what would (.) you think work better for (.)\n 3. Jordan Well I would like to start with um sha:red residency (.) and then\n 4. take it from there.\n 6. Nicola And you feel that that's in Harry's best interest?\n 7. Jordan Yeah I do. There's been, there's been, um, countless surveys and stuff\n 8. done. On families (.) what would you suggest then?\n 9. Med Just a moment there. Jordan what do you mean by shared residency?\n10. Jordan One week, one weekend (.) with both families.\n11. Nicola Have you thought about the logistics of that?\n12. Jordan Yeah, That's why, that's why\n13. [that's why (.) we haven't moved (.) from [town], you've moved and\n14. Nicola [Have you thought about how you're gonna do school pickups?\n15. Jordan moved and gone down and come back and registered him in other\n16. schools we're in [town] we can be a constant in his life. (.). And as such,\n17. shared residency is a good starting point. Now, if you don't want to\n18. agree with that suggest something else.\n19. Med Just a moment, what do you mean by sh.. so one week aa, one week\n20. from s, Friday to Friday\n21. Jordan Yeah (0.2). And then (.) alternate Christmases, Christmas Eve,\n22. Christmas Day, um (.) ten days holiday, at the minute Nicola feels\n23. that ten days is too long for Harry to be away on holiday with us. (.)\n24. um he's been away with Nicola on holiday for ten days this year\n25. which (.) you know, I (.) agreed to. Because it's important to him\n26. to spend as much time (.) with both families. Because it is within his\n27. best interest, you know.\n28. Med So Nicola you have listened to that and I know you have got\n29. concerns so let's let's uh let's hear what your thoughts are.\n30. Nicola Ok well I categorically disagree with the um (.) shared residency.\n31. Jordan Ok what, well then you suggest what you think would be [um\n[I've told you\n33. what my suggestion is Jordan, it's [ um\n[what's your suggestion?\n35. Med [Can I, I'll do it, can I hear it?\nIn this extract, the mediator asks Jordan, what he thinks would `work better for' the\nchild, Harry. Jordan's response (Lines 3\u00ad4) is quite specific, a direct drawing on a pre-\nsumption of shared residency (Fehlberg et al., 2011; Trinder, 2010). To this, Nicola asks\nwhether this will be in `Harry's best interest'. The presumption of shared residency is\ncountered with the concept of the child's best interest. This is not a `rights-based' dis-\ncourse from Jordan, it is an `evidence-based' discourse referring to child well-being\nresearch. The mediator questions this reading of shared residency (Line 9). Nicola coun-\nters with reference to `the logistics' (Line 11) \u00ad not with reference to 50:50 parenting. In\nresponse, Jordan brings in an example of `parental one-upmanship' \u00ad unlike Nicola, he\nimplies, he has not moved around, he is therefore demonstrably a `constant' in their\nchild's life. We see in this extract several categories which participants link to the child's\ninterest \u00ad doing school pickups (Line 14), being a `constant' (Line 16).\nThe mediator intervenes with a focus on the practicalities (Line 19). While this might\nseem to be a neutral intervention, it links back to Nicola's challenge to think about the\n`logistics'. In this way, an ostensibly neutral intervention often patterns or references one\nparty's claim or terms. Jordan brings in a complaint about Nicola (Lines 22\u00ad27), finish-\ning with another appeal to the child's best interest: Jordan thus positions himself as rea-\nsonable, in contrast to Nicola's unreliability in moving around, but also demonstrates his\nattention to the child's best interest. On being invited by the mediator to respond, Nicola\n`categorically' disagrees with the shared residency. This extreme case formulation\n(Pomerantz, 1986) needs no elaboration or justification (Sidnell, 2004). The form of the\nstatement closes down discussion. Antaki and Wetherell (1999) demonstrated how\nextreme case formulation can be used to subsequently `show' concession, and Nicola's\ncategorical refusal here may be a strategic move.\nDuring this extract, first Nicola and then Jordan challenges the other, citing the child's\ninterest (rather than their rights or preferences as parents) as a reason for their position.\nJordan draws explicitly on the `evidence base' for shared parenting; Nicola talks about\n`logistics', the example of which is `school pick-ups'. The concept of the child's best\ninterest in this talk is invoked by Nicola as a response to a plea for shared residency, and\nby Jordan as a summary of his argument for the child spending equal (or as much as\npossible) time with both families.\nIn the third extract, a separating couple discuss a similar issue. Peter has proposed that\nboth of their children have two separate but equal homes, spending one week in each.\nRoberta is unenthusiastic:\nExtract 3: Peter and Roberta with male mediator (Session 1)\n 1. Med Um (.) How much of all thi:is (.) is about (.) how each of you might feel (.)\n 2. with with the children (.) not having, not being (.) with the children not\n 3. being with you as much as you both want? So so for example, for you,\n Roberta, um how would it feel for the (.) not to see them for (.) uh, a week,\n 4. and (.) how much is that dri:iving your decision making?\n 5. Roberta Um that um that's not driving it at a:all. Umm uumm (0.2)\n 6. Med Okay. And the same question, by the way, Peter.\n 7. Roberta It is purely about what I believe to be the best for them. They (.)\n 8. um and (.) you know there may be some element of (.) umm, are they at\n 9. are they with Peter, crying, and they want me. Um (.) and I will find that\n10. very difficult to deal with. Not I mean, not (.) obviously, I'll miss them if I\n11. don't have them for a week but i:it's (.) it's more to do with how I (0.1)\n12. would worry how they're feeling about things (.) and not being there for them\n13. Med Soo the same question for you, Peter. Actually, before I come back to\n14. because I'm hearing a lot of `I believe, I believe' and that's that's but how\n15. how (.) how much of it is it about you? (.) I mean, be perfectly honest\n16. about this, I'll ask that same question really. About how you might fe:el if\n17. (.) you see them (.) Fri Friday, Saturday and Sunday, alternate weeks with\n18. uh (.) with uh one night a week (.) every week (.) for you?\n19. Peter Uum [coughs] I think (.) [coughs] excuse me. (.) Uum (.) I think I\n20. would just feel (.) cut off and distanced a:and (.) um (.) you know,\n21. there's an element of (.) relegation uuh (.) to:o (.) not being able to\n22. fulfil (.) the role that I have been fulfilling since they were born (.) Um\n23. (.) um (.) and I don't see why (.) that should happen (.) to the\n24. detriment of the children. Because I (.) you know I um.. my belief um I\n25. believe that Roberta and I offer(.) different valuable things (.) to to each of\n26. our children and I don't see why (.) um they shouldn't benefit from that.\nThe mediator indirectly suggests here (Lines 1\u00ad4) that the parents in dispute about\nchild contact and residency might not be focusing on the children's best interests, but\nperhaps (and reasonably, he implies) `how would it feel . . . not to see them for . . . a\nweek?'. Roberta denies this bluntly `it's not that at all', and elaborates bringing in directly\nthe concept of the children's best interests \u00ad `It is purely about what I believe to be the best\nfor them'. This is another extreme case formulation \u00ad both hard to counteract, and also\nsetting up possibilities for `show' concessions later. Roberta insists that her opposition to\nweek-with-each-parent proposal is based on the children's emotional needs.\nHowever, the justification for this claim is interesting as it hinges on her feelings and\ninvolvement: `I would worry how they're feeling'and `not being there for them'. Roberta's\nargument thus links the children's interests and needs with her presence. She is the parent\nmost attentive to the children's emotional needs, and therefore, her feelings and emotions\nabout the children are not separable from their best interests. This is a strong assertion\nabout who has the right to make epistemic claims about the children's interests.\nHere (Lines 13-18) the mediator, performing a symmetrical neutrality, repeats his\nearlier question to Peter, of his feelings about Roberta's earlier proposal that the children\nlive with their father for alternate weekends, plus a midweek night (a common contact\narrangement in the United Kingdom). Peter responds (Lines 19\u00ad20) `I would just feel cut\noff and distanced' and refers to `the role that I have been fulfilling since they were born'\n(Line 22). In this term, he manages to demonstrate his emotional involvement, but also\nhis active longstanding involvement, concluding with a reference to the children's best\ninterests: `I don't see why that should happen to the detriment of the children.' He adds\nto this (Lines 25\u00ad26) that both parents offer `different valuable things'which the children\nshould benefit from.\nBoth parents resist the suggestion that their feelings are driving their preferences, and\ntalk instead about the impact on the children. Peter additionally emphasises his long-term\nchildcaring involvement, and draws on abstract notions of good parenting. The mediator\nattempts to talk about the parents' feelings, perhaps to challenge the either/or dichotomy\nof feelings versus evidence in parenting. The dispute between these parents over how\nmuch time the children will spend in each parent's home continues into the second\nmediation session (a few weeks later):\nExtract 4: Peter and Roberta (Session 2)\n 1. Roberta I mean, really the children need consistency (.) and they need a base. They\n 2. need to know where their house is. They need to know that this is when\n 3. they are going to be at home. How would you like to li:ive in a hotel for six\n 4. nights and then in another hotel for another six nights and just keep (.)\n5. shifting? It makes no sense. That's not normal. This is what I am ta:alking\n 6. about, being rational to the point of lu lunacy. That is not (.) normal (.) for\n 7. children. They need to have a home and then they will go and see you (.)\n 8. for five nights out of fourteen.\n (a few lines omitted)\n 9. Peter Okay. So (0.2) what you are saying about they need a home, (.) a base and\n10. then some other uh prop:erty too, this is wrong. The way you are speaking\n11. about it is wrong. We are two parents. We conceived them. We've brought\n12. them up for six years. They will have two houses of equal standing (.) with\n13. two parents of equal STANDING.\n14. Med Is the reality however, whatever language you both [uh whatever\n16. Med language you both use (.) is they will have (.) a home with you both and it's\n17. a question of how much time they spend in each home (.) with you both\n19. Peter [Yes. A home with us both. I have had enough of your arrogance.\nRoberta talks (Lines 1\u00ad6) about what the children need: consistency, a base, to know\nwhere their house is. She is drawing on abstract notions, but then moves rhetorically\ninto more personal territory `How would you like to live in a hotel ...?'. She contrasts\nthe `normal' experience she is proposing with the `lunacy' of Peter's `rational' 50:50\nsuggestion. She finishes her turn with an absolute `They need to have a home and then\nthey will go and see you (.) for five nights out of fourteen'. Here Roberta is in line with\nthe current default practice in family law, whereby children usually live primarily\nwith the mother. Roberta does not justify why she (rather than Peter) will be the parent with\n9/14 nights; her argument rests on the children's need for `a home' (Line 7) rather than\ntwo `hotels', `and then they will go and see you (.) for five nights out of fourteen'. This\nis similar to Nicola's `categorical refusal' to contemplate 50:50 residency in Extract 2.\nNeither statement is taken by the speaker to require justification, which closes down\ndiscussion. Peter takes issue with the idea of `a home, (.) a base, and then some other uh\nprop:erty'. He refers to equality of parenting (Lines 9-12). He then maintains that `They\nwill have two houses of equal standing (.) with two parents of equal STANDING'(Lines\n12\u00ad13). The mediator intervenes and\u00adwhile his turn has aspects of an impartial formu-\nlation: `Is the reality however ...'\u00adthis is a mild rebuttal of Peter's statement by suggest-\ning that the exact language (home, house, property) is unimportant. However, he\ncontinues that `they will have (.) a home with you both' \u00ad which is in line with Peter's\nterminology, and not Roberta's. Peter picks up on this and immediately agrees `Yes.\nA home with us both' (Line 19). Here, the mediator uses standard current practice in\nhow to talk about post-separation parenting (two homes, even if children spend more\ntime in one). Despite the mediator's attempts to remain neutral, his lexical choices\nprivilege one party's words or claims over the other.\nFor the next extract, we return to Nicola and Jordan, in the same mediation session as\nearlier, still discussing shared residency:\nExtract 5: Nicola and Jordan\n 1. Med But um can we just while we are on the issue I wasn't going to spend\n 2. as much time on Christmas (.) but uh it seems to me that there is a\n 3. major misunderstanding between you uh to put it mildly uh at the\n 4. moment as to what's actually going to happen this Christmas [so let's\n\n[Yeah\n 6. well (.) that that's the reason that I wanted to cover it today because no\n 7. conversation has been entered into regarding Christmas this year (0.2)\n8. Med [Mm\n 9. Nicola [and my situation is very different because I am not at work.\n10. Jordan But this isn't about you, it is about Harry [and what's best for him.\n11. Nicola [what well I care for Harry\n12. and soo (.) because if (.) i it is about my circumstances.\n14. Nicola I am on maternity leave this year and therefore (0.2) I am prepared\n15. for Harry to have Christmas with you guys.\nThe mediator (Lines 1\u00ad4) attempts to progress the talk on from the cyclical disa-\ngreement, downgrading the couple's argument to a `major misunderstanding', though\nthe following `to put it mildly' suggests the mediator is aware of this being a reformu-\nlation. The reformulation of disagreement to `misunderstanding' is routine in counsel-\nling talk. Edwards and Potter (2001) argue that such reformulations perform two\nfunctions. They downplay tension, suggesting no fault, while setting up relationship\nproblems as a kind of puzzle that can be unravelled via counselling. Moreover, they\nmight demonstrate to fighting ex-couples how to constructively talk about their dif-\nferences in future.\nThe mediator stresses that the topic of Christmas is a participant-led concern \u00ad\nwhich Nicola immediately ratifies `because no conversation has been entered into\nregarding Christmas this year'. The use of formal, third-person language is a way of\ndemonstrating reasonableness and capacity to step back from emotions (Edwards and\nPotter, 2001), particularly in interactions involving both professional and lay members\n(Atkinson, 1982). Nicola suggests that her working situation is relevant, but Jordan's\nresponse draws again on the concept of the child's interests: `But this isn't about you,\nit is about Harry and what's best for him'. Nicola subsequently moves to a personal\nclaim `well I care for Harry'. This reference to maternal care is drawn on as relevant to\nconsidering the child's interests \u00ad as Roberta did in Extract 3. Nicola suggests a solu-\ntion (Lines 14\u00ad15), but this is presented not as Jordan's right (or as Harry's best inter-\nest), but rather as a gracious relinquishment: `therefore I am prepared'. The earlier\nextreme case formulation is here modified with a `show' concession (Antaki and\nWetherell, 1999). Jordan returns to the notion of shared residency, and the final extract\nis five minutes later in this session:\nExtract 6: Nicola and Jordan\n1. Jordan and to increase the contact is only a good thing and not a bad thing. (0.2)\n2. Med Ok Nicola, do you want to respond (.) to any of that?\n3. Nicola Yeah I I disagree with that.

Nicola's response is similar to Roberta's in Extract 3,\nwith a three-part list pattern: the child needs a base, stability, routine. Nicola repeats her\nearlier `categorical disagreement' with shared residency, claiming that a child needs one\nstable base. Previously, Nicola drew on her knowledge of Harry's need for care (Extract 2).\nHere, she draws on general ideas of what is good for a child (a base, stability, a routine),\nthough she talks specifically about Harry (not an abstract child) needing this.\nDiscussion\nWe have highlighted how parents drew on various argumentative resources to demon-\nstrate their attention to good parenting, while negotiating shared care of their children.\nInvestigating the details of the talk helps clarify how the mediation process, both in the\ngoals and assumptions inherent in the institution, and in mediators' practices, produces\ncertain forms of claims and arguments.\nOur analysis adds to previous research with close attention to the resources that par-\nents currently bring into the mediation sessions. In these extracts, we observe the gen-\ndered cultural norms of mothering and fathering being both displayed and contested. The\nrole of fathers post-separation is more contested than in previous decades. While this\nfine-grained analysis focuses on just three couples over nine mediation sessions, the\nfindings are consistent with a much larger set of observations compiled by a range of\ninvestigators (summarised by Dingwall, 2010). Moreover, the concerns and arguments\ndemonstrated in these sessions mirror recent family law debates and shifts in expecta-\ntions of post-separation parenting (Collier and Sheldon, 2008).\nParents come to mediation services with strategies and knowledge \u00ad but sometimes\nfrom contradictory sources, such as competing `expert' positions on a child's well-\nbeing. They engage performatively in the mediation process, demonstrating parental\ncompetence, reasonableness and attention to the child's best interest. They also align\nthemselves with mediators whose interventions may be intended neutrally but can be\ntaken up by parents as argumentative resources (previously noted in Garcia's (2010)\nneighbourhood mediation participants). Both fathers and mothers refer to the `child's\nbest interests', directly and implicitly, as justification for their proposals about shared\nparenting arrangements. Two mothers in these extracts make links between their emo-\ntional state and the child's best interests, which is taken by the fathers (and sometimes\nthe mediators) as the mothers attending to their own needs in contrast to focusing on the\nchild's best interests. However, this contrast depends on an assumption of autonomy, in\nwhich the interests of all \u00ad in this case, parents and child \u00ad are independent. An alterna-\ntive reading is possible and has been taken up by feminist scholars (e.g. Diduck, 2013)\nwho argue that an inability to disentangle each individual's interests may only be a\n`problem' because the current autonomy discourse has made it so.\nIn these extracts, the fathers do not invoke a parental rights discourse (though they do\nelsewhere), but refer to research which supports shared parenting, to the concept of the\nchild's best interests and to their personal history of involved parenting. These are sys-\ntematic (and predictable) differences in the resources from parenting literature which\nfathers and mothers use as justification, but here, we note how fathers and mothers in\nthese studies both orient to the `child's interests', rather than to their rights as parents, or\ntheir feelings. It seems that an "
