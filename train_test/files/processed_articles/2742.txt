Yet, given the emphasis on sub-\njects such as reading, writing, and arithmetic, many\nschool districts and schools do not prioritize PA and/or\nphysical education (PE) during the school day.4 While\nthe provision of PE is fairly commonplace, the duration,\nfrequency, and quality of PE varies tremendously.3,5,6\nA recent consensus statement concluded that in-\ncreasing PE frequency and duration, increasing the\namount of MVPA time in PE, and providing trained\nteachers to implement PE are keys to increasing\nin-school PA.7\nStates laws and district policies govern PE in\nschools.8,9 Most state laws have been on the books\nfor a number of years and have not changed substan-\ntially since 2003.8 And, although not required, many\ndistricts incorporated PE provisions into their con-\ngressionally mandated school district wellness policy.9\n(See the Supplemental Digital Content Table, available\nat: http://links.lww.com/JPHMP/A23, that illustrates\nthe nationwide prevalence of state laws and district\npolicies governing PE time and MVPA time.)\nResearch on the relationship between state and/or\ndistrict PE laws and policies, respectively, is emerging.\nTaber and colleagues10 illustrated that district policies\nare stronger in states with strong PE laws, indicative of\ntop-down policy making.11 Yet, Eyler and colleagues12\ndocumented the relative lack of evidence-based ele-\nments in state PE laws, with only 16% and 11% of\ning language governing PE time or activity time, re-\nspectively. Several studies have found a relationship\nbetween specific PE time requirements and elemen-\ntary school (ES) and/or middle school (MS) PE time\nlaws were associated with more student time in PE\nand, in a California study, state PE mandates were as-\nsociated with district-level compliance and student fit-\nness levels.17 Kim18 found no relationship between state\nPE laws and school-level PE, children's PA, or obesity.\nAnd, Evenson and colleagues19 found that a North Car-\nolina statewide PE and recess policy change was asso-\nciated with increased PA participation, awareness of\nhealthy habits, student focus on studies, alertness and\nenjoyment, and higher staff involvement. Although lit-\nerature in this area is growing, we are unaware of any\nstudy to examine the relationship between state laws,\ndistrict policies, and district-level PE practices. This\nstudy seeks to fill this gap by illustrating the extent\nto which state and/or district PE time and MVPA time\nlaws and policies, respectively, are being implemented\nin practice in districts nationwide and to highlight pol-\nicy opportunities.\n Methods\nData sources\nState laws\nState laws for each of the 50 states were compiled\nby Bridging the Gap researchers at the University\nof Illinois at Chicago.20 The state laws, effective as\nof the beginning of September of school year 2010-\n2011, were identified through key word searches of\nthe full-text, tables of contents, and indices of codi-\nfied state statutory and administrative laws commer-\ncially available from Westlaw (www.westlaw.com) and\nLexis-Nexis (www.lexis.com). Codified state statutory\nlaws include legislation, whereas codified administra-\ntive laws include all rules/regulations promulgated\nby state Boards of Education. \"Informal,\" noncodified\npolicies adopted by state Boards of Education were ex-\ncluded from this study. The codified state laws were\nDistrict policies\nThe district sample was developed at the University of\nMichigan's Institute for Survey Research, using sam-\npling frames based on the National Center for Edu-\ncation Statistics' Common Core of Data files. Districts\nfrom all contiguous US states were eligible.\n\"On-the-books\" district policies effective as of the\nstates through Internet research with telephone and\nelectronic mail follow-up.9 District policies were de-\nfined broadly to include: the district-approved wellness\npolicy, any associated district regulation, and any state\nor district policies embedded by reference in the well-\nness policy/regulation (ie, PE policies). The University\nof Illinois at Chicago's institutional review board de-\nclared the district policy collection \"not human subjects\nresearch.\"\nDistrict sample and survey\nDistrict sample--Each district with a policy was contacted\nto confirm the PE coordinator and to obtain the coor-\ndinators' contact information. Physical education was\ncoordinated either at the district level (78%) or at the\nschool level (22%). Since this study sought to assess\ndistrict-level implementation of state laws and district\npolicies, the survey was restricted to the 444 districts\n(located in 45 states) with district-level PE coordina-\ntion. (The 2 other states included in the original dis-\ntrict sample did not have any sampled districts with\ndistrict-level PE coordination.) District PE coordinator\nresponsibilities ranged from PE curriculum coordina-\ntors, to health/wellness specialists, to athletic/fitness\ncoordinators. Compared with excluded districts,\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

This\nanalysis focused on the survey items related to PE fre-\nquency and duration and percentage of PE time spent\ndoing MVPA at the ES and MS levels.\nThird grade was the ES referent category, with\n3 relevant questions asked. First, \"On average, how\nmany days (range, 1-5) per week is PE required for\nthird-grade students?\" Second, an open-ended nu-\nmeric question asked, \"On average, how many minutes\nper week of PE do students in third-grade receive\"?\nThe third question asked, \"What percentage of time\ndo third-grade students spend engaged in active PE,\nthat is, activity that will elevate their heart rates such\nas running, jumping jacks, etc\"? Ordinal response op-\ntions ranged from 0% to 100%. All questions included\na \"do not know\" option.\nEighth grade was the MS referent category. Given the\nvariability in MS scheduling, options to assess block\nscheduling were included to account for longer class\nperiods and fewer days per week associated with block\nscheduling. PE coordinators were first asked, \"What\ntype of scheduling is used for eighth-grade within the\ndistrict?\" Response options were as follows: 1, block\nscheduling only; 2, standard scheduling only; and 3,\nboth block and standard scheduling. \"Block only\" or\n\"both block and standard scheduling\" respondents\nwere asked an open-ended numeric question: \"On av-\nerage, how long is each block of time allotted for PE?\"\nThis question was followed by \"On average, how many\nblocks per week of PE do eighth-grade students re-\nceive?\" Response options ranged from 1 to 5, with op-\ntions for \"every other day\" and \"it varies.\" Respon-\ndents indicating that they used \"standard scheduling\nonly\" were asked an open-ended numeric question:\n\"How many days per week is PE required for eighth-\ngrade students?\" Standard scheduling-only districts\nwere not asked the length of each PE session. Instead,\nresearchers at Washington University collected the in-\nformation via Internet research with electronic mail and\ntelephone follow-up. A question on percent time in\nMVPA, akin to the question asked for third grade, was\nalso asked for the eighth-grade level of applicability.\nAll questions included a \"do not know\" option.\nThe survey was pilot tested to determine completion\ntime and question wording. Washington University re-\nsearchers e-mailed the survey to each PE coordinator\nthrough Qualtrics Online Survey Software (Qualtrics\nLabs Inc, Provo, Utah) along with an introductory\ne-mail explaining the survey purpose and offering an\nopportunity to be entered into a raffle for a $25 gift card\nfor survey completion. Three follow-up electronic mail\nmessages were sent.\nAnalytic variables\nPolicy predictors (independent variables)\nAll state laws and district policies were double-coded\nby 2 trained coders, using a reliable and valid ordinal\ncoding scheme.23 Coding agreement was high (ranging\nfrom 94% to 97%), and discrepancies were resolved\nthrough discussion among the coders and the lead\nauthor. The original PE time policy coding schemes\nranged from a strong policy that met the National As-\nsociation for Sport and Physical Education recommen-\nminutes of PE per week (MS) (level 2 code),24 a lesser\nrequirement or only a suggested time standard (level\n1 code), to no law/policy (level 0 code). The MVPA\nlaws/policies were coded as follows: 2, requirement\nthat at least 50% of PE time be spent in MVPA; 1, re-\nquirement that less than 50% of PE time be spent in\nMPVA or encouraged that PE time be spent in MVPA;\nand 0, no MVPA-related law/policy.\nBecause of a limited number of survey-responding\ndistricts being located in a state and/or district with\na strong (level 2) state law and/or district policy for\neither topic, dichotomous variables (1, any law/policy;\n0, no law/policy) were created for each item by grade\nlevel of applicability. The state and district variables\nwere cross-tabulated to create a variable (one for each\ngrade level of applicability), with 4 mutually exclusive\nand exhaustive categories to indicate policy jurisdic-\ntion: none (neither district nor state); district only; state\nonly; or both district and state. Each of the latter cate-\ngories was compared against \"none\" (referent).\nDistrict practices (outcome variables)\nElementary school items\nResponses greater than zero for the third-grade minutes\nper week were received from all but 19 districts requir-\ning PE. All but 13 districts responded to the question\nregarding the number of days of third-grade PE. And,\n147 districts responded to the active time in PE question\nfor third grade.\nMiddle school items\nResponse rates also varied for the MS items. Forty-six of\nthe 53 districts with block scheduling responded to the\nnumber of blocks offered per week. For the standard\nscheduling districts, data on the number of minutes\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Responses were received from 145\ndistricts on the number of days of PE required per week\nfor eighth grade. Missing data for all ES and MS items\nwere replaced with the item mean.\nTo standardize responses across standard and block\nscheduling districts, 2 new variables, \"PE_TIMES\"\nand \"PE_MINWEEK,\" were computed. PE_TIMES re-\nflected the number of days per week that PE was of-\nfered in eighth grade and was based on the number\nof days of PE per week for standard schedule districts\nand the number of blocks per week for block districts.\nPE_MINWEEK was calculated by multiplying the min-\nutes per session by the number of days per week for\nstandard scheduling districts and the minutes per block\ntimes the number of blocks per week for block schedul-\ning districts.\nDistrict-level contextual controls--District-level characteris-\ntics were obtained from National Center for Education\nthis analysis). For each district, data were obtained on\nthe total number of students (school size, collapsed into\ntertiles based on the data distribution of small, medium,\nand large [referent] districts based on student enroll-\nment); US census region (South [referent], West, Mid-\nwest, and Northeast); and locale (city [referent], suburb,\ntownship, or rural). The percentage of students eligible\nfor free or reduced price lunch was used as a proxy\nfor SES, divided into 3 groups on the basis of free or\nreduced price lunch distribution: higher SES (referent),\nmedium SES, or lower SES. School racial/ethnic com-\nposition was coded as 1 of 4 exhaustive and mutually\nexclusive categories: majority white (referent); major-\nity Hispanic; majority black; and diverse (no majority).\n(Table 1 provides the cutoffs for each of the categorical\nvariables.)\nAnalytic methods\nAnalyses were conducted using Stata/SE v.12.1.25 Be-\ncause of the nonnormal distribution of the outcome\nmeasures, Poisson regressions were used with robust\nstandard errors and state clustering to account for\nthe lack of heterogeneity in state laws for multiple\ndistricts within each state. In addition, to ease in-\nterpretation, predicted margins and marginal effects\nwere computed. The predicted margins equal the ad-\njusted outcome (eg, days of PE per week) within\neach policy category, controlling for covariates. The\nmarginal effects represent the average difference in\nthe outcome (eg, days of PE per week) associated\nwith the state and/or district policies as compared\nwith districts in states/districts without the given\nlaw/policy.\nTABLE 1  Characteristics of the Districts Included in\nthe Analytic Sample\nq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q\nElementary Middle\nCharacteristics School Levela School Levelb\nPolicy predictors, %\nAny PE time per week policy\nAny MVPA in PE policy\nOutcome variables, mean (range)\nControl variables, %\nCensus region\nUrbanicity\nDistrict size\nMajority race/ethnicity of students\nFRL eligibilitye\nAbbreviations: FRL, free or reduced price lunch; MVPA, moderate-to-vigorous phys-\nical activity; PE, physical education.\naN = 191 districts with policies applicable at the elementary school level unless\notherwise noted.\nbN = 184 districts with policies applicable at the middle school level unless otherwise\nnoted.\ncFour districts reported zero PE minutes at the elementary school level, so the final\nanalytic N = 187 districts at the elementary school level of applicability.\ndFour districts reported 400 to 450 minutes of PE per week at the middle school\nlevel.

The exceptions were that dis-\nPE time was spent in MVPA at the ES and MS levels, re-\nspectively, when the district had an MVPA policy than\ndistricts where such a policy did not exist. State laws\nwere not significantly associated with district MVPA\ntime.\n Discussion\nThis study illustrated the extent to which public school\ndistricts are implementing state and/or district PE time\nand MVPA time laws and policies. Consistent with\nprior research, this study illustrates that state laws, in\nparticular, have been influential in affecting district-\nwide practices regarding PE time.17,19 District policies\nwere associated only with increased PE time when the\nstate also had such a law, indicative of top-down pol-\nicy making,11 and not surprising given that district PE\npolicies are stronger in states with stronger PE laws.10\nWhile the relationship between the state laws and\ndistrict policies with district PE practices is encourag-\ning, it is important to note that they all fell well be-\nlow the National Association for Sport and Physical\nEducation\u00adrecommended amount of PE time. Clearly,\nmore efforts are needed to find ways (from both a com-\npeting demand and a resource standpoint) to enable\ndistricts to offer more PE time.\nNeither state laws nor district policies positively in-\nfluenced the amount of MVPA time in PE. It is possible\nthat the district respondents overreported the amount\nof MVPA time (64%) as compared with prior obser-\nvational research that found that only 35% to 38% of\nPE time was for MVPA26-29 and therefore one would\nnot be able to correctly interpret the outcome. In addi-\ntion, as indicated in Supplemental Digital Content Ta-\nble (available at: http://links.lww.com/JPHMP/A23),\nmost states and districts do not address this issue in\ntheir laws and policies and, when they do, districts are\nmore likely than states-only to address the issue, thus\npolicy opportunities exist to continue to enhance and\noversee implementation of laws in this area.9,12,30\nAs always, the findings are subject to several limita-\ntions. First, this was a study of association and not cau-\nsation. Second, the district practices were self-reported\nby district PE coordinators and thus are subject to re-\nporting error and/or bias based on the extent of the\nrespondents' knowledge regarding district-wide prac-\ntices regarding PE time and MVPA time. While we at-\ntempted to reach the district official most knowledge-\nable about PE practices, respondent knowledge about\nactual practices may be limited to what they believe\nas opposed to what actually is happening in practice.\nThird, we were unable to assess the relationship be-\ntween laws and policies and school-level practices or\nstudent time spent in PE or MVPA time in PE. Future\nresearch would be well served to explore the relation-\nship between state laws, district policies, and student-\nlevel PE time and MVPA time in PE. Finally, survey re-\nsponders primarily represented larger, predominantly\nwhite and high-SES districts nationwide; thus, the re-\nsults may not be generalized to all districts nationwide.\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\nPolicy Influences on District PE Practices  S47\nIn conclusion, state laws and district policies have\nthe potential to influence PE time at the ES and MS lev-\nels; however, state laws clearly seem to be driving dis-\ntrict PE time practices. Interestingly, although the laws\nand policies in this area were not \"strong\" (ie, they did\nnot meet the National Association for Sport and Physi-\ncal Education\u00adrecommended standards), the results of\nthis study indicated that even \"weaker\" policies with\nlesser time standards are associated with increased PE\ntime. Given that most state laws and district policies\nin this area do not change frequently9,10 and given that\nstates and districts are constantly navigating the com-\npeting demands for time during the school day as well\nas resource limitations, policy changes in this area will\nbe challenging, but the results of this study suggest that\nPE time laws/policies can influence district PE time\npractices. Given these challenges, districts would be\nwell served to engage in cross-sectoral collaborations\nsuch as those recommended by the both the National\nPhysical Activity Plan31 and the Institute of Medicine32\nwith the education sector working with other groups\nsuch as parks/recreation, transportation, health care,\netc, to facilitate increased PA time among school-aged\nchildren.\nREFERENCES\n1.
