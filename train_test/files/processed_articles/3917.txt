These scholars examined how media\nattention to organizations and related attributes can affect the public and other agendas,\nmainly in terms of organizational reputation (e.g. Carroll and McCombs, 2003; Meijer\nand Kleinnijenhuis, 2006). Others have used the broader concept of `agenda building', or\n`media agenda setting' (Denham, 2010), to study how media select and emphasize some\norganizations and/or issues over others, thereby mainly focusing on the impact of public\nRagas et al., 2011). A particular relevant research avenue that remains unexplored by\nthese `agenda scholars' interested in organizations is that of media agenda diversity.\nResearch in other areas, mainly political communication and policy studies, has\nexamined agenda diversity in the agenda-setting process in depth (Kleinnijenhuis et al.,\n2015). Zhu (1992) referred to agenda setting as being a `zero-sum game', which means\nthat attention to one agenda object must go at the expense of others, because the `carry-\ning capacity' of agendas is inherently limited (Hilgartner and Bosk, 1988). In effect,\nagenda formation is characterized by intense competition among agenda objects (e.g.\nissues or actors), which affects agenda setting (McCombs and Zhu, 1995). Remarkably,\nfew studies have focused explicitly on the underlying dynamics of `media agenda diver-\nsity' and how they can be explained. This refers to the way in which agenda building\ninfluences the diversity structure of the media agenda, or, in other words, how the jour-\nnalistic shaping of the agenda in terms of attention to specific objects may influence the\ndiversity pattern of the media agenda.\nSeeking to inform the literature on agenda building and agenda diversity, particularly\nin relation to organizational news, this study investigates the long-term influence of\nattention to corporations on media agenda diversity during the economic crisis.\nRelating to normative ideas about the function of journalism in society, there is a\nwide consensus that journalists should aim to build and maintain a diverse media\nagenda. Ideally, a diverse agenda is desirable because it offers comparable opportunities\nfor social actors (in our case companies, critics, and others) to gain media attention. Yet,\nbuilding a diverse agenda may be challenged in times of crisis. Organizational news is\noften related to crisis situations, as crises render organizations newsworthy\n(Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2013). The so-called `trigger events' (Dearing and Rogers, 1996)\ntypically catapult crises on the media agenda, causing focused attention waves in the\nJonkman et al. 3\nnews (Nisbet and Huge, 2006). These waves may then lead to a temporal decline of\nagenda diversity since focused attention to crisis-related objects (e.g. certain corpora-\ntions) pushes other objects (e.g. other corporations) off the agenda (Kleinnijenhuis\net al., 2015). However, day-to-day patterns of fluctuating agenda diversity are common\nin news reporting (Boydstun, 2013). But severe crisis situations, such as global eco-\nnomic crises, may affect agenda diversity negatively on a structural level because these\nevents are capable of sustaining high attention over longer periods of time. The critical\nquestion with regard to diversity then becomes to what extent long-term attention influ-\nences agenda diversity on a structural level?\nThis study aims to shed light on that question by taking the recent economic crisis as\na case in order to examine to what extent long-term media agenda diversity operates in\nthe context of attention to a variety of media salient company types (e.g. transport com-\npanies, banks, energy firms), in Dutch economic news between 2007 and 2013. Hereby,\nfocus is on the effect of media attention to banks since they have been objects of fierce\ndiscussion in news coverage during and after the financial crisis in 2007. In the economic\ncrisis that hit Europe years after that period, banks have been central actors and they have\nundergone several large waves of attention. This makes them especially relevant to con-\nsider in the context of agenda diversity since attention patterns for these organizations\nmight be highly skewed, with periods of large attention going in particular at the expense\nof the general pattern of diversity.\nMedia agenda diversity\nMedia agenda diversity may be used as both a dependent and an independent variable\nbecause on a conceptual level it refers to the interplay between agenda building and\nagenda setting: as journalists create fluctuating diversity patterns on the media agenda,\nthey may in turn influence agenda setting. Zhu (1992) started agenda-diversity research\nby showing how agenda setting could be seen as a `zero-sum game, in which the rise of\none issue results in the fall of another' (p. 826). It was articulated that\nthe salience of a particular issue on the public agenda is a function not only of its salience on\nthe media agenda, which is the original agenda-setting hypothesis, but also of the salience of\ncompeting issues on both the media and public agendas. (McCombs and Zhu, 1995: 496)\nSubsequent studies confirmed this idea to large extent (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015). Only\nrecently scholars began to study media agenda diversity explicitly as an effect of how the\nmedia agenda is shaped by journalists (Boydstun et al., 2014a). In this type of research,\nagenda media diversity is used as dependent variable.\nMedia agenda diversity can be conceptualized as the distribution of attention among\na given set of discrete object categories in a news discourse (Tan and Weaver, 2013). The\nterm objects denotes the same as `attitude objects' in social psychological research: the\nthings we form opinions about (Carroll and McCombs, 2003). While agenda research is\ntraditionally focused on issues, scholars in corporate communication have also focused\non organizations and substantive and affective attributes of organizations. Media agenda\ndiversity may thus have qualitative and quantitative constituents: the types of object\n4 Journalism \ncategories and the number of categories (Peter and De Vreese, 2003). Diversity can theo-\npercent concentration on one category (e.g. only banks) to\nequal dispersion of attention across all categories (Jennings et al., 2011), although such\nextremes are unlikely to be encountered in the news (Alexandrova et al., 2012).\nEntropy\nMethodologically, most communication researchers use entropy (Shannon and Weaver,\n1949) to measure agenda diversity (see Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015). Here, entropy relates\nto the distribution of attention scores across a set of selected objects (e.g. a set of corpo-\nrate types), weighted by the occurrence of those objects (e.g. the amount of mentions or\narticles in a newspaper on a certain day; Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015). Entropy is thus a\nmeasure to examine the relative dispersion of attention across objects on an agenda. Of\ncourse, the categorical themes may vary (e.g. issues, perspectives, or organizations),\ndepending on the topic under study (Boydstun et al., 2014a).\nEntropy has, among other purposes, been employed as a dependent variable to meas-\nure the extent of prioritization of specific objects across a set of general objects on a\ncommunication agenda (e.g. Jennings et al., 2011). For example, let us assume that\nmedia attention to banks is disproportionally large for one whole news week, when com-\npared to attention to all other company types in that week. Then, attention to banks will\nhave a negative effect on the entropy scores within that specific week: We could say that\nbanks are prioritized in the news that week.\nThe relation between attention and agenda diversity\nMedia attention and object prioritization can be conceptualized through the agenda-\nbuilding approach (see, for example, Kiousis et al., 2009, 2015), which has, among other\npurposes, also been used to study how crisis events trigger media attention (Denham,\n2014).Agenda-building scholars have followed a model by Shoemaker and Reese (1996)\nthat identifies five sorts of influences on news attention: processes related to individual\njournalists, media organizations, journalistic routines, external events and broader cul-\ntural context (Denham, 2010). These influences can be used to briefly explain how media\nattention, and in turn diversity, is by definition constrained and limited.\nDay-to-day agenda building by individual journalists and news organizations is first\ncharacterized by a systematic drive to process ample, new, and diverse information in a\ncontinuous fashion (McQuail, 2010). Yet, a massive incongruity exits between the abun-\ndant available information that journalists and media institutions potentially could pro-\ncess and their capacity to actually do so (Boydstun, 2013). Because there is too much\ninformation available to keep up with \u00ad psychological attention is finite, organizational\nrecourses are limited, and the carrying capacity of the media agenda is restricted\n(Boydstun, 2013) \u00ad information is processed in a boundedly rational fashion (Kahneman,\n2003). That is, focus lies on a given set of topics at the time because journalists and news\norganizations can only keep up with so many stories at once. The necessity to focus\nattention fosters routinization: journalists and media organizations have relatively stable\norientations toward specific actors and issues (Tuchman, 1978), and news is governed by\nJonkman et al. 5\nsteady journalistic perceptions about newsworthiness and news values (Harcup and\nO'Neill, 2001). Furthermore, agenda building functions in the context of stable relations\nwith sources (e.g. specific companies), re-occurring events (e.g. the publication of annual\nreports), and mimicking behavior of journalists (Vliegenthart and Walgrave, 2008).Also,\nattention patterns emerge in the context of dominant societal discourses, such as eco-\nnomic and political narratives.\nAll this shapes the context wherein attention patterns emerge and agenda diversity\nmaterializes. Evidently, however, agenda building differs from day to day, resulting in\nfluctuating attention patterns. Often, attention reflects relatively routinized patterns\nof agenda building, with attention for a limited variety of objects. Sometimes, how-\never, specific news objects may dominate news, often catapulted on the media agenda\nby so-called newsworthy trigger events (e.g. crises). This is when agendas get punctu-\nated (Boydstun, 2013). Punctuations are frequently occurring periods of dispropor-\ntional high attention to specific objects that enter the news agenda. From time to time,\nmedia pay (often collectively) disproportional amounts of attention to specific topics\nfor a certain period of time (Boydstun et al., 2014b). These salience punctuations may\nvary in terms of impact and duration but are an inherent characteristic of the media\nagenda.\nWith regard to this, Boydstun et al. (2014b) differentiate between storm and non-\nstorm media coverage. Non-storm coverage can be considered `normal news reporting':\nsituations that are characterized by a relative fast chancing pattern of attention to a rela-\ntive small set of agenda objects. Media storms, on the other hand, are large and lengthy\npunctuations, which comprise a considerable share of the media agenda during a specific\nperiod (Boydstun et al., 2014b). Storm coverage also differs from normal news reporting\nin the sense that those large and lengthy punctuations should be associated with fewer\nagenda objects.\nHigh attention to specific agenda objects normally declines after a certain period\nand the pattern of news reporting shifts back to `normal reporting', until new punctua-\ntions occur. This pattern of continuing trade-offs between salience punctuations and\n`normal reporting' produces a diversity pattern that fits the characteristic of `punctu-\nated equilibrium dynamics' (Boydstun, 2013: 54). Journalists try to offer a relative\ndiverse palette of actors, issues, and perspectives, but in practice they end up focusing\non a limited set of objects at a time. Since this continuing pattern of generating news\nis often interrupted by periods of focused attention to specific objects, agenda diversity\nwill vary over time.\nMedia storms are often caused by trigger events. Such events tend to `shift the atten-\ntion of the media, refocusing attention to problems or issues that are either novel or were\npreviously unattended or underattended' (Wolfe et al., 2013: 180). Most of these issues\nare catapulted into public attention by the media trough trigger events (Nisbet and Huge,\n2006), but the `media inevitably exhaust dramatic elements of the issue that are needed\nto sustain interest' (p. 6). However, some issues or actors remain highly visible on the\nmedia agenda and start to receive structurally more attention than other objects (Hilgartner\nand Bosk, 1988) because they disrupt social order to a large extent (e.g. severe environ-\nmental, political, and economic crises qualify; see Boydstun, 2013) and are extremely\n`loaded' with news value (e.g. dramatic, negative, personal, related to elites).\n6 Journalism \nThe erratic day-to-day/week-to-week patterns of low and high attention fluctua-\ntions should thus not influence the pattern of long-term media agenda diversity since\nthe complete diversity pattern absorbs the individual salience punctuations (Jennings\net al., 2011: 5). However, agenda objects that structurally \u00ad or at least for longer peri-\nods in time \u00ad receive more attention than others could influence long-term agenda\ndiversity negatively (Jennings et al., 2011). The critical question in this regard is to\nwhat extent objects have the capacity to dominate the news agenda over longer time\nperiods.\nThe effect of attention to banks on long-term media\nagenda diversity\nThe financial crisis that started in 2007 can be seen as a major trigger event for news\nattention to the financial system, and banks in particular. Media attributed the crunch of\nthe financial markets to a large extent to commercial banks (Bennett and Kottasz, 2012).\nStill, critics have also held media accountable for not fulfilling their watchdog role, fail-\ning to warn the public about the risks and dangers of commercial banking earlier\n(Manning, 2013). In effect, the financial crisis turned out to be not only a banking crisis\nbut also a journalistic crisis.\nIn the recent years, journalists and news organizations have been forced to reorientate\ntheir positions vis-a-vis the banking sector and the financial system in general. Ever\nsince the beginning of the financial crisis, commercial banks have been a focal point of\nattention for journalists around the world (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015). This suggests that\nbanks have been `prioritized species' in the mainstream news discourses about compa-\nnies in this period of financial and economic turmoil. In the Netherlands, this is also\nreflected in the frequent high waves of media attention around issues like fraud (e.g. the\nRabobank Libor scandal in 2013), financial deficits and bankruptcy (e.g. state aid to\nING, Fortis and ABN Amro in 2008), bonuses (e.g. ABN Amro in 2014), and the role of\nbanks in Europe and abroad (e.g. relations to banks and the financial deficits of Greece\nfrom 2009 onward). During the crisis, the attention for banks is unlikely to have been at\nthe same high level all the time \u00ad it is expected to go up and down with the occurrence of\nnew developments and events.\nIn sum, one can anticipate (a) overall higher levels of attention for the banking sector\ncompared to other sectors during an economic crisis and (b) more fluctuation in atten-\ntion compared to other sectors. In the context of the above, this means that we expect\nthat news about banks will punctuate the news discourse, on average, more often than\nnews about other firm types. We argue that banks will be structurally prioritized when\ncompared to other company types and are thus able to `push' other companies from the\nagenda.\nStructural prioritization means a systematic negative effect on the diversity of the\nwhole agenda. Hence, the following hypothesis is proposed:\nH1. Increased attention to banks leads to a structural decline in agenda diversity in\nJonkman et al. 7\nMethod\nData and case\nOur dataset consists of all company news articles about highly visible company types,\npublished in the economy section of NRC Handelsblad, between 1 January 2007 and 31\nIn the study's time period, the Dutch economy was first affected by the US mortgage\ncrisis (beginning 2007). Loaning money became more expensive; banks became increas-\ningly precautious with mortgage lending; the Dutch stock exchange (AEX) dropped; and\nconsumer confidence and trust in the economy and banks declined. In September 2008,\nthe US credit and banking crisis led to a banking crisis in the Netherlands. Hereafter, the\ncrisis evolved into the Euro and a broader economic crisis, which can overall be charac-\nterized by a decreasing gross domestic product (since 2008), declining purchasing power\nAlthough the newspaper market suffered from a severe decline in circulation rates\nsince the start of the economic crisis in 2007, quality newspapers are still regarded as a\nmajor information source in the Netherlands (Bakker and Scholten, 2014). The\nNetherlands is a prototypical example of the `democratic corporatist model' (Hallin and\nMancini, 2004), with independent media, high level of professionalization of journalism,\nas well as traditionally high circulation numbers of newspapers.\nNRC Handelsblad is one of the largest daily quality newspapers in the Netherlands (the\nother large newspapers are Telegraaf, Trouw, Algemeen Dagblad, and de Volkskrant).\nNRC stands out for its broad and extensive coverage on economic issues (Bakker and\nScholten, 2014), which makes it particularly suitable for examining news related to the\neconomy (Hollanders and Vliegenthart, 2011).Apractical advantage regarding our choice\nto study NRC coverage is that its digital database, in contrast to the other outlets, covers\nclear sections. This allowed us to automatically separate economic news from other news.\nWe started with retrieving all articles that were published in NRC Handelsblad in the\nperiod of study from the LexisNexis database (N=243,171) and subsequently narrowed\ndown the sample to meet our requirements. First, we identified all articles that were pub-\nlished in the Economy section of the paper (N=29,843) because news about corporations\ncan be conceptualized as a sub-category of economic news (Kalogeropoulos et al., 2015).\nFurther inspection of the data showed that not all entries contained full articles (as in\nwritten texts) but occasionally were lists or tables (e.g. stock exchange ratings). By plot-\nting a histogram of the number-to-word ratios of the articles, we determined that entries\nin which 16percent of the characters are numbers instead of words are extremely likely\nto belong to the category of non-articles. We removed them, which narrowed down the\nPreprocessing and determination of relevant companies\nAll preprocessing and large parts of the analysis were done using a program that we\nnamed INCA (Infrastructure for Automated Content Analysis). The program involves a\n8 Journalism \nset of Python scripts that we previously developed in another context (see Trilling and\nJonkman, 2015) and that will be made available to any interested researcher. INCA con-\ntains a parser that separates individual articles from metadata like publication date, sec-\ntion, author, and the like, and subsequently stores the parsed data in a MongoDB\ndatabase.1 This database was then used for preprocessing and cleaning the data, which\nwas also done within our program.\nNext to steps like conversion to lowercase and the removal of stop words and punctua-\ntion, we paid extensive attention to the recoding of potential firms mentioned in our data\nin order to circumvent underestimation of news attention to firms. We manually compiled\na list of companies \u00ad based on existing lists of Dutch and Non-Dutch multinationals, and\nAEX stock market\u00adlisted firms potentially relevant for our study. If a firm on this list\ncontained more than one word or had synonyms or different spellings, our program used\nregular expressions to replace these by a unique term that we defined. For example, Air\nFrance KLM and different variations on it were all converted into Air_France_KLM and\nABN AMRO into ABN_AMRO. In addition, we supplemented abbreviations like ABN\nby the full (new) name, if the full name was mentioned in the same text.\nDetermination of most prominent companies\nIn a next phase, we compiled a list of the 100 companies with the highest media visibil-\nity. Instead of using pre-existing lists or rankings with company names (e.g. the Fortune\n500 ranking for most reputable firms), which is common practice in research involving\nnews about corporations, we propose to inductively define which companies to select.\nThis approach suits our type of research better since news media have their own selection\nmechanisms for relevant information (Shoemaker and Reese, 1996). In other words,\nbeing able to inductively retrieve the most visible firms in the news gives us an idea of\nthe media prominence of corporations. To this end, we calculated the frequency of each\nword in the whole dataset, with the exception of words (including their conjugations)\nthat appear in a Dutch dictionary. For validity reasons, we compared our pre-existing list\nof companies to the dictionary list to avoid missing firm names that may appear in the\ndictionary. Two names (TomTom and Amstel)2 were found and they were removed from\nthe dictionary. This dictionary filter function gave us a list with several thousand words\n(predominantly referring to specific social actors and issues; i.e. non-Dutch words).\nSubsequently, we selected the first 100 companies on that list manually. We also consid-\nered using named entity recognition for this task, but decided to use the dictionary filter\napproach instead to minimize the chance of missing a company.3\nAs we are interested in news about companies, we included only articles in which at\nleast one of the 100 most media prominent companies was mentioned in our further\nanalysis. This narrowed the final dataset down to 14,363 articles.\nIndependent variables: Attention to company types\nWe allocated each of the identified firms to an overarching company type, using the Global\nIndustry Classification Standards (GICS) industry classification scheme, which is a clas-\nsification scheme for company types commonly used in economic and financial research\nJonkman et al. 9\nand practice (see: Hrazdil et al., 2013).4 We based the allocation process on information\nfrom the Orbis and Osiris databases. Both databases are commonly used sources in eco-\nnomic and strategy research involving corporations. The databases contain all sorts of\ndata about public and private companies worldwide, including information about the\nGICS classification of firms. All the Top 100 companies that we detected in our data were\nalso present in the Orbis and Osiris databases. In accordance with the way the Orbis and\nOsiris organize their data, we defined our company types on the GICS `industry groups'\nlevel.According to the GICS scheme, there are 24 company types in total in this overarch-\ning category. On the basis of the information provided by Orbis and Osiris, we were able\nto allocate the 100 media prominent companies to 17 (of the 24) distinct company type\ncategories: (1) Utilities; (2) Transportation; (3) Telecommunication Service; (4)\nTechnology Hardware and Equipment; (5) Software and Services; (6) Semiconductors\nand Semiconductor Equipment; (7) Real Estate; (8) Media; (9) Materials; (10) Insurance;\n(11) Food and Staples Retailing; (12) Energy; (13) Diversified Financials; (14) Consumer\nDurablesandApparel;(15)CapitalGoods;(16)Banks;(17)AutomobilesandComponents.\nThose 17 company types could thus be considered `media prominent company types'.5\nWe used the aggregated number of mentions in a week of all company types as inde-\npendent variables in our analysis. We chose a weekly level of analyses because weeks\nrefer to the weekly cycle of news presentation (Boydstun et al., 2014a).6 This means that\nit is likely that those periods of normal news reporting and/or salience punctuations begin\nand end at the beginning of news weeks. The analytic lens of a daily level can be best\nused to investigate the dynamics of high fluctuations reporting, whereas a monthly level\nof analysis is more suited for long-term events.\nDependent variable: Media agenda diversity\nTo measure media agenda diversity, we use Shannon's H entropy (Shannon and Weaver,\n1949), which is the most used measure in agenda diversity research (Jennings et al.,\nthe distribution of observations across a given number of distinct object categories,\nweighted by the occurrence of these object categories (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015).\nMathematically, the formula is represented in the following form\nH p x ln p x\ni\ni\nn\ni\n= - ( ) ( )\n( )\n=\n\nIn our case, entropy (H) is the negative sum for all firm types of the likelihood p(x)\nthat a firm type x is allocated to a specific industry segment i, multiplied by the natural\nlogarithm of that likelihood (Jennings et al., 2011).As ln(0) is undefined, we replaced the\nzero with a very small proportion: 0.0000001. This is common procedure in agenda-\nsetting research (Boydstun et al., 2014a). While the minimum score of Shannon's H is\nalways equal to zero (complete focus of attention on one category), the maximum score\nis dependent on the amount of categories. Our study is based on 17 distinct categories,\nwhich implies that the maximum value for Shannon's H is ln(17)2.833.\nControl variables\nWe used the following variables as control variables in the analysis.\nVolume.It is conceivable that a higher volume of coverage might give room to more\ndiverse coverage. We therefore control for the amount of (1) words used in company\nnews per week and (2) the amount of articles in news about corporations per week.\nCrisis dummy.We have argued that commercial banks have been media salient, espe-\ncially in the beginning of the economic crisis, during the credit crisis. We therefore con-\ntrol for this specific period. The exogenous variable `credit crisis' is operationalized as\nthe period between the first week of July 2007 and the first week of November 2009 and\ncaptured by a dummy variable (0\n=\nno crisis, 1\n=\ncrisis). According to Kleinnijenhuis\net al. (2015), this period was a phase in which several banks received a lot of media atten-\ntion. This phase started with a mortgage crisis in the United States. On 15 September\n2008, Lehman Brothers (a US investment bank) crashed, causing a shock in the financial\nsystem. Suddenly, they were even more in the spotlight than before. In 2008 and 2009, a\nseries of severe crises happened, involving several foreign as well as Dutch firms, espe-\ncially banks (e.g. Fortis, ABN Amro, ING, Ice save (an Icelandic bank), and the DSB\nbank). This phase ends in the last week of October 2009, when the problems around the\ndeficits in Greece were announced (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015). We argued before that\nmedia attention to banks `exploded' during the credit crisis. It is therefore relevant to\ncontrol for this period.\nTime-series analysis: Partly adjusted Autoregressive Distributed Lag model\nToanalyzethedata,weusedtime-seriesanalysisandbuiltapartlyadjustedAutoregressive\nDistributed Lag (ADL) model. Since our data have the form of time series, with weekly\nobservations, we have to take into consideration the specific characteristics of time\ndependent data. First, however, it is necessary to determine whether the time series are\nstationary (Vliegenthart, 2014) \u00ad that is, the mean is not dependent on the time of obser-\nvation. To this end, we used a Dickey Fuller Unit Root Test \u00ad to test null hypothesis that\nthe series are non-stationary. This test revealed that this null hypothesis can be rejected\nand the series are indeed stationary (Z=-13.48, p<0.001). Consequently, the series do\nnot have to be differenced.\nAutoregression and time\nA second issue with time series is the overtime dependency. In our model, we include a\nlagged dependent variable (or AR(1) component) to account for this dependency.\nAutoregression (AR) refers to the extent to which the value of a variable is explained by\nits own past value (t-1). In our case, this means the influence of the agenda diversity of\nthe previous week on the current week. We additionally also control for linearity in over\ntime, by adding a trend variable that takes the value of 0 for the first observation and\nincreases with one each week. Ljung-Box Q tests suggest that with the inclusion of the\nlagged dependent variable and the trend variable, the residuals do not contain any addi-\ntional autocorrelation and thus the temporal dependencies in the data are well accounted\nfor. Furthermore, for the final model, the ADL model with one lag results in residuals\nIn our analysis, we test the immediate effect of the attention for various company\ntypes on agenda diversity. With the inclusion of a lagged dependent variable and a time\ntrend, this means that our model formally resembles a partial adjusted ADL model (De\nBoef and Keele, 2008). We present our partly adjusted ADL model of media agenda\ndiversity in company news in three hierarchical steps: (1) the effects of the AR, trend,\nand agenda volume (amount of words and amount of articles per week) have been tested;\n(2) then, we included the exogenous dummy variable for the crisis; and (3) we included\nthe variables for the attention for the different company types.\nResults\nFirst, looking at the descriptive statistics (see Table 1), we see that attention to Banks is\non average much higher than attention for other company types, while also its standard\ndeviation (SD) is high (M\n=\n=\n62.75). Additionally, the maximum amount of\nmentions are higher for Banks, and they are the only company type with a minimum of\nTable 1.

The level of entropy is on average relatively high since the level of entropy in this\nstudy can theoretically fluctuate between 0 and 2.83 and has an empirically observed\nFigure 1 shows the relations between overtime attention to banks and entropy, as meas-\nure for agenda diversity. As expected, the graphs show attention patterns that are charac-\nterized by relatively long periods of focused attention, with low entropy levels. These\nsalience punctuations appear to be the heaviest during the financial crisis. Figure 1 shows\nthat entropy decreases during periods of frequent salience punctuations (periods of\nfocused attention) \u00ad especially during the financial crisis.\nExplaining media agenda diversity\nIn order to explain media agenda diversity, we tested three models. The results are shown\nin Table 2.\nModel 0 consists of the control variables only. When adding the credit crisis dummy\nto the model (Model 1), the explained variance slightly increases (R2=0.01).\nAs was observable in Figure 1, results indicate that during the credit crisis (July 2007\nHowever, Model 2, with the attention to all the company types added, reveals that it\nis not the credit crisis as such that drives long-term agenda diversity but rather the com-\npany types mentioned in the news during the crisis.\nIn fact, we observe a substantial increase in explained variation in agenda diversity\n(R2=0.55) when taking the visibility of company types into account as well. This is in\nline with the bivariate statistics presented in Table 3 (see Appendix 1).\nThe bivariate analysis shows that the credit crisis (dummy) correlates highly with\nBanks, Utilities, and Automobiles and Components. That explains why the credit crisis\nvariable becomes insignificant in Model 2.\nTable 2. Partly adjusted ADL model for agenda diversity in company news.\nVariables Model 0 Model 1 Model 2\nTechnology Hardware and Equipment 0.001**\nSemiconductors and Semiconductor\nEquipment\nADL: Autoregressive Distributed Lag; AR: autoregression.\nModel 2 specifies that banks \u00ad as expected \u00ad have a significant negative impact on\n<\n0.001). This means that if banks are in the news media,\nagenda diversity declines. Banks having a negative impact on agenda diversity of -0.003\nindicates that, for example, in a week where 50percent of attention is attributed to banks,\nagenda diversity declines with 0.0015. The effect is small yet substantial, given the theo-\nretical and empirically observed range of entropy that we observed above.\nNotably, Automobiles and Components also shows a significant negative impact on\ndiversity. Yet, the effect of this firm type is smaller when compared to the impact of\nBanks (-0.001, p<0.001). An explanation for this effect might be that also the automo-\nbile industry has been hit seriously by the crisis and shows considerable variation in\nattention during the research period (see also Table 1).\nLooking at the other firm types, we can observe another pattern. Most of the other\nfirm types (8 out 15) have a significant positive effect on media agenda diversity\n(Utilities, Telecommunication Service, Technology Hardware and Equipment, Media,\nInsurance, Food and Staples Retailing, Consumer Durables and Apparel, and\nSemiconductors and Semiconductor Equipment). The positive effects suggest that these\nsorts of firms are associated with more space on the media agenda. For example, if 5per-\ncent of the attention is devoted to Semiconductors and Semiconductor Equipment (the\nBased on these results, our hypothesis that increased attention to banks leads to a\nstructural decline in media diversity in the Dutch news between 2007 and 2013 can\ntherefore be confirmed.\nConclusion and discussion\nThe results of our study suggest that banks, and to a lesser extent also the `automobiles\nand components' industry, have been structurally prioritized above other media promi-\nother firm types have been associated with more agenda diversity instead of less, indicat-\ning that these corporate actors receive on average more attention only when there is a\nwider set of corporate actors on the agenda. Notably, the effect sizes related to these\ndifferences are small, while the average mean of agenda diversity is high. This suggests\nthat a fairly diverse company news agenda has been built and maintained during the\neconomic crisis. Our findings point to the structural prioritization of banks, but the pri-\noritization is fairly limited in its scope.\nDespite the small size of this effect, our results are in line with the theoretical idea that\nstructural prioritization of corporate actors in the news through accumulated agenda\npunctuations and media storms influences the structure of the whole media agenda in a\nsystematic way (Boydstun, 2013). In our theoretical reasoning, we argued that the space\nfor agenda building is inherently restricted because it reflects a `zero-sum game' (Zhu,\n1992). This means that the diversity structure of media agendas can be negatively influ-\nenced by attention to corporate actors if these actors receive on average more attention\nthan other actors. Broadly speaking, our results support this idea. Attention to banks is on\naverage and over time higher than all other corporate actors that are present in the news.\nFurthermore, we also observed that the salience punctuations that can be attributed to\nbanks are on average more frequent and larger than those punctuations belonging to\nother kind of corporate actors. In other words, we observed more and heavier storm cov-\nerage regarding banks in comparison with other company types. This indicates that banks\nmight be newsworthy across the board, but at some periods a lot more than in other\nperiods \u00ad and thus that news might be `event-driven' to a certain extent.\nSome reflections are important in the context of these findings. The effects that we\nfound are small in absolute terms. Yet, since the proportion of explained variance\nincreased substantially when accounting for the firm type variables, this suggests that\nthe overall variation in the distribution of attention to company types is small. In other\nwords, we are able to explain a considerable proportion of the variance in agenda\ndiversity over time by looking at attention to the different types of companies, despite\nthe small effect sizes. Two processes, which are in line with our theoretical reasoning,\nmay explain this. First, routinized agenda building may indeed result in a very stable\npattern of attention distribution across companies and company types: that is, journal-\nists generate information about a relatively fixed set of corporate actors, which receive\nrelatively stable amounts of attention over time (Harcup and O'Neill, 2001). Second,\nit could be that journalists indeed actively try to offer a diverse news agenda in weekly\nnews cycles, despite frequent agenda punctuations (Boydstun, 2013). This is also\nreflected by the high mean in media agenda diversity that we found over time. In other\nwords, the results reflect the idea that journalists are systematically caught in an `equi-\nlibrium': they seem to be moving around a relatively small set of actors and issues for\na certain period of time while seeking to maintain a diverse media agenda at the same\ntime (Boydstun, 2013: 54). As was brought up earlier, journalists were criticized for\nnot fulfilling their watchdog role properly, before and during the economic crisis. In\nresponse to such critique, it might well be considered socially legitimate, or even desir-\nable, that journalists pay intensified attention to particular issues, events, and actors\nover longer time periods, as long as they strive to maintain a diverse agenda in general.\nOur findings seem to echo that idea. An additional explanation for the small effect\nsizes could be related to the size of the agenda. The economic section of the newspaper\nis a relatively large agenda compared to, for example, the first page of a newspaper, a\ntelevision news bulletin, or the first page of a website. The larger the news agenda, the\nmore possibilities there are to construct a diverse agenda. Future research should take\ndifferent kind of news agendas and interrelated dynamics of agendas into account (e.g.\nfront-page news vs the rest of a newspaper, or front-pages of websites vs whole\nwebsites).\nOf course, our study has some limitations that need to be addressed. Although we\nanalyzed a newspaper that is known for its broad range of topics related to firms and the\neconomy, it is still only one news outlet. Given that we used a method to assess agenda\ndiversity that has not been used before in this context, we do not want to claim that our\nstudy provides a comprehensive answer to the question how agenda diversity in eco-\nnomic news can be explained. Instead, we rather see our case study as a point of depar-\nture for future research. In particular, our findings have to be re-tested across a broader\nvariety of news outlets (e.g. diverse newspapers, online news, television news) because\nthe characteristics of news outlets might play an important role in the way attention to\nnews is distributed. Similarly, cross-national comparisons may reveal structural\ndifferences between countries with, for example, different media systems. In addition,\nwe focused explicitly on large and highly media salient firms in a specific time period\n(the economic crisis), neglecting, for instance, the bulk of medium-sized businesses in\ntheir daily business. Future research could look at longer time periods to investigate\nlong-term general trends and the importance of key events. The contribution of our study,\ntherefore, goes beyond the \u00ad admittedly limited \u00ad case we have studied: We hope that the\nframework for assessing agenda diversity, which we introduced, can serve as a useful\ninspiration for such larger studies.\nNext to broadening the scope of such studies by introducing comparative or long-term\nelements, future research on agenda diversity in company news content could consider\nnot only organizational actors but also issues. It would, for example, be interesting to\nexplore the variation of issues in news about organizations and examine to what extent\nthese issues are prioritized in comparison with one another. In particular, issue\u00adactor\nrelations could be taken into account (see Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015). Because agenda\ndiversity could be seen as a particular instance of the broader concept of `attention diver-\nsity' (Boydstun et al., 2014a), such ideas could also be translated to other realms of\nmedia content research. This type of broader conceptualization allows researchers to also\nincorporate other, more substantial, content characteristics in diversity research (e.g.\nframes, perspectives, and discourses).\nFinally, our study particularly seeks to inform agenda-building and agenda-set-\nting research. In addition to our approach, scholars could use Shoemaker and\nReese's (1996) `theory of a hierarchy of influences on media content', to examine\nhow variables on micro, mezzo, and macro levels influence agenda diversity.\nFurthermore, in addition to the existing body of knowledge on the interaction\nbetween agenda diversity and agenda setting, future research should examine how\nmedia agenda diversity moderates the two-step process of agenda building and\nagenda setting. For example, the news-mediated influence of public relations efforts\n(e.g. attempts to influence the public through the media) could be moderated by\nlong-term agenda diversity. It is up to future research to enhance the design we used\nand explore such possible effects.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/\nor publication of this article: This work was carried out on the Dutch national e-infrastructure with\nthe support of SURF Foundation.\nNotes\n1.
