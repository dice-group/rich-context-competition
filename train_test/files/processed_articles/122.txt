While such a positive cross-sectional correlation may be due to equity stakes\nbenefiting lending, it may also be driven by endogeneity. To distinguish the two, we study a German\ntax reform that permitted banks to sell their equity stakes tax-free. After the reform, many banks sold\ntheir equity stakes, but did not reduce lending to the firms. Thus, our findings question whether prior\nevidence can be interpreted causally and suggest that banks' equity stakes may be less important for\nlending than previously thought.\n",

In the academic literature, it has often been argued that equity stakes may be\nbeneficial for lending because the control rights of the equity stake provide the lender\nwith an advantage in monitoring the borrower and the cash flow rights align the\nincentives of debt and equity holders. However, prior cross-sectional studies are\npotentially biased because banks may be more likely to buy equity stakes in firms with\nwhich they have a close lending relationship (reverse causality).\nContribution\nIn 2000, the German government decided to abolish the capital gains tax on the\ndivestitures of equity stakes. Following this tax reform, the banks sold most of their\nequity stakes. We study how these divestitures affected lending to these firms. This\napproach allows us to study the causal effect of equity stakes on lending.\nResults and Policy Recommendations\nWe find that banks sell most of their equity stakes in industrial firms after the tax\nreform. However, we cannot find any evidence that banks reduced lending to these\nfirms following the divestitures. Thus, the positive cross-sectional correlation between\nequity stakes and lending, which we also confirm in our sample, seems to be driven by\nendogeneity issues and cannot be interpreted causally. Rather, equity stakes held by\nbanks seem to be immaterial to their lending. Our findings have important policy\nimplications because they indicate that the benefits of equity stakes for lending may be\noverstated in the literature. This finding is relevant for bank-based economies such as\nGermany and Japan, but also applies to the United States, where banks are allowed to\nhold large equity stakes in their borrowers since the repeal of the Glass\u00adSteagall Act.\nFurthermore, it is relevant for institutional investors that participate in lending\nsyndicates which often hold both debt and equity of the same company\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nFragestellung\nDie sogenannte ,,Deutschland AG\" war dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass Banken gro\u00dfe\nAktienbest\u00e4nde an Industrieunternehmen hielten. In dieser Arbeit wird untersucht, wie\ndies die Kreditvergabe an diese Unternehmen beeinflusst. Vielfach wurde in der\nakademischen Literatur argumentiert, dass eine Kapitalbeteiligung f\u00fcr die\nKreditvergabe von Vorteil sei, da sie Interessenkonflikte zwischen Kreditgebern und\nEigent\u00fcmern des Unternehmens verringert. Jedoch kann aus den bisher verf\u00fcgbaren\nQuerschnittsanalysen keine kausale Wirkung von Kapitalbeteiligungen auf die Kredit-\nvergabe abgeleitet werden, denn ihre Ergebnisse werden dadurch verzerrt, dass die\nKreditbeziehung einen Einfluss auf Kapitalbeteiligungen hat (,,umgekehrte Kausalit\u00e4t\").\nBeitrag\nDer Deutsche Bundestag beschloss im Jahre 2000, den Verkauf von Kapital-\nbeteiligungen steuerfrei zu stellen, um die Aufl\u00f6sung der ,,Deutschland AG\" voran zu\ntreiben, woraufhin Banken viele ihrer Kapitalbeteiligungen verkauften. Wir unter-\nsuchen, wie sich diese Verk\u00e4ufe auf die Kreditvergabe an dieselben Unternehmen\nauswirken. Dieser Ansatz erm\u00f6glicht es uns, den kausalen Effekt von Kapitalbeteili-\ngungen auf die Kreditbeziehung zu messen.\nErgebnisse und Politikempfehlungen\nEs ergibt sich, dass deutsche Banken nach der Steuerreform zahlreiche Beteiligungen an\nUnternehmen, die mit ihnen in einer Kreditbeziehung standen, ver\u00e4u\u00dferten. Jedoch\ndeuten die Ergebnisse nicht darauf hin, dass die Banken auch ihre Kreditvergabe an\ndiese Unternehmen reduzierten. Daraus folgt, dass die in bisherigen Querschnitts-\nanalysen gefundene positive Korrelation zwischen Beteiligungen und Kreditvergabe\nnicht kausal interpretiert werden darf. Stattdessen kann der Bestand an Unternehmens-\nbeteiligungen als irrelevant f\u00fcr die Kreditbeziehung gelten. Als wichtige politische\nImplikation deuten unsere Ergebnisse darauf hin, dass die Vorteile von Beteiligungs-\nbeziehungen zwischen der Finanz- und Realwirtschaft in der Literatur \u00fcbersch\u00e4tzt\nwerden. Dies ist vor allem f\u00fcr bankbasierte Finanzsysteme wie Deutschland und Japan\nrelevant, aber auch f\u00fcr die USA, wo es Banken seit Aufhebung des Glass-Steagall-Act\ngestattet ist, gro\u00dfe Eigenkapitalanteile an Unternehmen zu halten. Bedeutend sind die\nErgebnisse zudem f\u00fcr institutionelle Investoren, die sich an Kreditsyndikaten beteiligen,\nwelche oft sowohl Eigen- als auch Fremdkapitaltitel an Unternehmen halten.\n*Bastian von Beschwitz, Federal Reserve Board, International Finance Division, 20th Street and Constitution\n(corresponding author).\n** Daniel Foos, Deutsche Bundesbank, Directorate General Banking and Financial Supervision, Wilhelm-\ndaniel.foos@bundesbank.de\nWe thank Viral Acharya, Franklin Allen, Tobias Berg, Jean Dermine, Alex Edmans, Lily Fang, R\u00fcdiger\nFahlenbrach, Itay Goldstein, Todd Gormley, Denis Gromb, Maria Guadalupe, Wei Jiang, Kose John, Thomas\nKick (the editor), Laura Lindsey, Elena Loutskina, Ron Masulis, Pedro Matos, Massimo Massa, Atif Mian,\nHolger Mueller, Lars Norden, Daniel Paravisini, Joel Peress, Urs Peyer, Sascha Steffen, Philip Strahan, Ingo\nWalter and seminar participants at the Bundesbank, ECB, INSEAD, Wharton, Tuck, Federal Reserve Board,\nRotterdam, Norwegian School of Economics, HEC Paris, NTU, HKU, the Swiss Finance Institute and the 4th\nINSEAD PhD Workshop for valuable feedback.

Introduction\nFor most of the twentieth century, the Glass\u00adSteagall Act enforced a division between\ncommercial and investment banking in the United States. When it was repealed in 1999,\nU.S. commercial banks not only obtained the right to engage in underwriting and\nadvisory activity but also the right to hold large equity stakes in firms they lend to\n(Kroszner (2000)).1 While this option was new in the United States, banks in other\ncountries such as Germany and Japan frequently held equity in their borrowers (Allen\nand Gale (1995)). Indeed, in the 1990s, some researchers praised bank equity ownership\nas an advantage of such bank-based economies (e.g., Prowse 1990), while others saw it\nas a risk to financial stability (e.g., John, John, and Saunders (1994), Boyd, Chang, and\nSmith (1998)). Nowadays, this discussion gains new importance as the United States\nreintroduce some of the Glass-Steagall provisions in form of the Volcker Rule, which\nlimits banks' ability to engage in private equity investments.\nWe contribute to this debate by studying how a bank's equity stake in a borrowing firm\naffects lending to that firm. There are two reasons why equity stakes may provide an\nadvantage in lending to a firm: First, the cash flow rights of an equity stake align the\nincentives of debt and equity holders and thus reduce the agency cost of debt (John,\nrights of the equity stake may allow the lender to better monitor the borrower.\nPrior papers (e.g. Ferreira and Matos (2012), Prowse (1990)) find a positive association\nbetween banks' equity stakes and lending, which they argue supports that equity stakes\nare beneficial for lending. However, such a positive cross-sectional correlation can also\nbe driven by endogeneity issues because banks decide on their debt and equity holdings\njointly.\nTo address such endogeneity issues, we use a German tax reform which triggered\ndivestitures of equity stakes as identification. While we confirm prior papers in finding\na positive cross-sectional correlation between banks' equity stake and lending, we do\nnot find any causal evidence that equity stakes benefit lending: following the reform,\nbanks sell their equity stakes, but they do not decrease lending to these firms. Thus, our\nfindings question whether the prior evidence can be interpreted causally and suggest\nthat banks' equity stakes may be less important for lending than previously thought.\n1 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 allows banks to engage in \"merchant banking investments\".\nBanks can obtain any percentage of equity in an industrial company and keep it for up to 15 years. The\nbank is not allowed to \"routinely manage or operate\" the company, but can exert some influence on the\nfirm. Under the Glass-Steagall Act, such merchant banking investments were limited to 5% of voting\nWe use the German capital gains tax reform in 2000 for identification. Before the\nreform, German banks held large minority stakes in German industrial companies. For\nexample, Deutsche Bank held equity stakes in 24 industrial companies ranging from\n0.25% to 30% of the firms' equity and adding up to a total market value of EUR 22.7\nbillion (45% of Deutsche Bank's own market capitalization). Many of these stakes had\nunrealized capital gains over time. Consequently, banks maintained the equity stakes\nmainly to avoid capital gains taxation (Sautner and Villalonga (2010)). The German\ngovernment decided to abolish the 50% capital gains tax in 2000, thus removing a major\nobstacle to the divestiture of banks' equity stakes (Edwards et al. (2004)). Banks' stock\nprices increased by 5% upon the announcement of the tax reform (see Figure 1), which\nsuggests that (1) the reform was a surprise to the market, and (2) that the tax acted as a\nbinding constraint on banks.\nFigure 1: Announcement returns of the tax reform\nIn Panel A, we display the mean returns of German banks with equity stakes around the announcement of the tax\nreform on December 23rd, 1999. As control groups we report German firms without equity stakes and US banks (SIC\ncodes 6000-6199). An equity stake is defined as a holding of another firm's equity of less than 50%, which is held\neither directly or through a chain of subsidiaries at the 75% threshold. In Panel B, we display the returns of the four\nlargest publicly traded German banks. To put those returns into perspective, we also display the aggregated value of\nthe equity stakes, the market capitalization of the bank before the tax reform and the market capitalization increase\nimplied by the return computed as return multiplied by market capitalization. In the last column, we display the\nmarket capitalization increase as a function of the value of the equity stakes computed as market capitalization\nincrease divided by the aggregate value of the equity stakes.\nPanel A: Stock returns around the announcement of the tax reform\n(Event)\nReturn\nGerman banks with\nequity stakes\nGerman firms\nwithout equity stakes\nUS banks\nPanel B: Announcement returns on the banks with the largest holdings\nName\nValue of Equity\nStakes\n(EUR million)\nMarket\nCapitalization\n(EUR million)\nMarket\nCapitalization\nIncrease\n(EUR million)\nMarket\nCapitalization\nIncrease in % of\nEquity Stakes\nValue\nBayerische Hypo- und\nVereinsbank AG\nAs these equity stakes tied up much regulatory capital, one would expect banks to divest\ntheir stakes despite potential benefits these stakes might have for the lending\nrelationships. Indeed, 75% of banks' equity stakes were divested in the six years\nfollowing the tax reform (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2: Divestitures of equity stakes following the tax reform\nThis figure illustrates the divestitures of banks' equity stakes following the tax reform. An equity stake is defined as a\nbank holding less than 50% in an industrial company, either directly or through a chain of subsidiaries at the 75%\nthreshold. We display whether an equity stake held by a bank in December 1999 (before the tax reform) has been\ndivested or maintained by December 2002 and December 2005. We define a stake as divested if the firms is still\ncovered in the respective database (\"Who owns whom?\" or Hoppenstedt) and the stake has been decreased by at least\n50%. We also supplement our data with regulatory data from the German Central Bank on equity stakes of banks. For\n14 of 135 equity stakes the coverage ends before the bank divests the equity stake. These are set to missing and are\nexcluded from computing these percentages.\nEquity stakes by divestiture (%)\nDivested\nMaintained\nTax Reform\nIn our main tests, we use loan-level data from the German Large Credit Register\nprovided by the German Central Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank) to study how equity\nstakes by banks affected lending. We start by conducting the same cross-sectional\nanalysis as prior studies (e.g. Ferreira and Matos (2012), Prowse (1990)) for the time\nperiod before the announcement of the tax reform. We find a positive correlation\nbetween equity stakes and lending for both the extensive and intensive margin. The\nexistence of an equity link is correlated with a higher probability of a lending\nrelationship (44.1% instead of 18.7%) and conditional on the existence of a lending\nrelationship, the bank lends on average 2.6 times as much money to the firm if it holds\nits equity. These results are significant at the 1 percent level in all our specifications.\nWhile the positive cross-sectional correlation is in line with the prior papers, it does not\nimply that equity stakes are beneficial for lending. Rather it could be explained by\nreverse causality or omitted variable bias.\nTherefore, we go on to study how banks change their lending to firms whose equity\nthey divest following the tax reform. Because divestiture decisions are endogenous, we\nconduct an intention-to-treat analysis and condition our analysis only on the ownership\nof equity stakes prior to the tax reform rather than the actual divestiture decision.\nSpecifically, we run a difference-in-difference regression where the treated group\nconsists of bank-firm pairs with an equity stake in 1999. Such an intention-to-treat\nanalysis is common in the literature (e.g. Angrist, 1990; Karlan and Zinman, 2010) and\nis the same as a reduced-form instrumental variable approach in which the divestiture of\nan equity stake is instrumented by the existence of an equity stake at the time of the tax\nreform. The same identification strategy is used in von Beschwitz (2017).\nThe idea of this analysis is that before the reform, the tax forced banks to keep\ninefficiently large equity stakes in firms. Once the tax is abolished, banks are free to sell\ntheir stakes down to the optimal level (which in many cases is no equity stake). If equity\nstakes were indeed beneficial for lending (as prior papers have argued), we would\nexpect a reduction in lending to firms in which banks divest equity stakes for the\nexogenous reason of the tax reform. However, we do not find any evidence of this\nreduction in lending. Rather there seems to be no significant change in lending to\npreviously equity linked firms following the tax reform. If anything, there is an\n(insignificant) increase in lending. This finding suggests that the evidence in the prior\npapers may be affected by endogeneity issues and thus be misleading.\nSince the treatment occurs at the bank-firm-level, we can control for trends at the bank-\nand firm-level with bank-year and firm-year fixed effects, respectively. Intuitively,\nbank-year fixed effects imply that we examine the change in the bank's lending to the\nfirm in which it held equity relative to its lending to other firms, while firm-year fixed\neffects imply that we study how the company's borrowing from the (formerly) equity-\nlinked bank changes relative to its borrowing from other banks. Thus, we control for\nany bank or firm specific effects, such as the additional capital that banks obtain from\nselling their equity stakes.\nWe show several additional analyses that confirm our results and address potential\nconcerns with our methodology. For example, one concern may be that our results are\ndistorted by including equity stakes that were not sold. Thus, in a second test, we rerun\nour difference-in-difference set-up, but only include equity stakes that were divested\nuntil 2005. The result remains unchanged.\nNext, we directly study the change in lending around divestitures after the tax reform.\nWhile this analysis is affected by endogeneity concerns, such endogeneity would most\nlikely bias the analysis towards finding a negative effect of divestitures on lending. For\nexample, if a bank has negative information about the firm, it may choose to divest the\nequity stake and reduce lending. However, even using this specification, we find that\nbanks (insignificantly) increased lending following the divestiture of an equity stake.\nNext, we examine whether we can find a negative effect of the tax reform in the subset\nof bank-firm pairs where equity stakes are particularly likely to benefit lending.\nSpecifically, we study the subset of cases where the bank also sits on the company's\nsupervisory board and where the company is not publicly listed. We don't observe a\nnegative effect of the tax reform on lending for either of these two subsets.\nWe conduct several robustness checks. For example, we add companies and banks\nwithout equity links to our control group or study different regression set-ups. Our\nresults do not change. We also show that the number of votes banks obtain from proxy-\nvoting the shares of their customers is miniscule compared to the votes obtained through\nequity stakes. Furthermore, we show that our sample is representative: Banks that hold\nequity stakes account for 59% of the assets of the German banking system and firms\nwith banks as equity holders are similar to other German firms along a number of\ncharacteristics.\nOverall, our findings show no indication that banks reduce lending to firms in which\nthey divest equity stakes for exogenous reasons. This finding questions whether the\ncross-sectional evidence can be interpreted as showing that equity stakes benefit\nlending. Rather, it seems likely that equity stakes are immaterial for lending and the\ncross-sectional evidence provided in other studies is affected by endogeneity issues such\nas reverse causality and omitted variable bias. Reverse causality seems likely because\nseveral studies document that lenders can use their access to private information for\nprofitable investments in the borrower's equity (Massa and Rehman (2008), Ivashina\nand Sun (2011), Massoud et al. (2011)). Also omitted variable bias seems relevant,\nbecause good relationships with a company may cause a bank to invest in both, the\ncompany's debt and equity. An alternative interpretation is that an equity stake might\nfacilitate the initiation of a lending relationship, but it may provide no further benefits\nafterward. Consistent with this view, Hellmann, Lindsey, and Puri (2008) show that\nbanks are more likely to extend credit to companies in which they have previously held\na venture capital investment. We can only speculate which mechanism causes the cross-\nsectional correlation, but our results suggest that the cross-sectional evidence does not\nimply a positive effect of equity stakes on lending for established lending relationships.\nThe finding that equity stakes may not benefit lending also has important policy\nimplications. It suggests that regulations preventing banks from holding equity in their\nborrowers (such as under Glass\u00adSteagall) do not adversely affect lending.\nOur paper adds to a strand of literature studying the effect of equity stakes on lending.\nThese studies generally document a positive association between banks' debt and equity\ninvestments in a firm, be it in Portugal (Ant\u0103o, Ferreira, and Lacerda (2011)) or in Japan\nthat banks are more likely to act as lead arrangers for syndicated loans to companies in\nwhich they hold an equity stake through their mutual fund or asset management\ndivisions. Different to our paper, these studies are based on cross-sectional\ncomparisons. Many of these papers try to address endogeneity with instrumental\nvariables, such as whether the bank or the firm is publicly listed or how strong the\nrestrictions on the mixing of banking and commerce are in a country. However, these\ninstrumental variables can affect lending through other channels besides affecting the\nlikelihood of the bank holding an equity stake. Therefore, it seems likely that the\nexclusion restriction of these instrumental variables is not fulfilled, making them\ninvalid. Our difference in difference analysis is a superior method to address\nendogeneity because it provides plausibly exogenous variation to the ownership of\nequity stakes. Our findings question whether the cross-sectional results can be\ninterpreted as showing that equity stakes benefit lending.\nOur research is also related to papers that analyze the relationship between equity stakes\nand loan pricing. Santos and Wilson (2008) find that banks request lower interest rates\nfrom borrowers whose voting rights they control. Fang, Ivashina, and Lerner (2013)\nshow that banks provide cheaper financing to companies in which their private equity\narms invest. Jiang, Li, and Shao (2010) show that non-bank institutional investors\ncharge lower interest rates on syndicated loans if they also hold equity in the borrower.\nContrary to these studies, Lim, Minton, and Weisbach (2012) find that leveraged loans of\nnon-bank institutional investors have higher spreads when the lenders hold equity in the\nborrower. While our data do not allow us to study loan pricing or loan characteristics,\nour findings show the importance of controlling for endogeneity when studying equity\ninvestments of banks, which may explain the inconsistent results on loan pricing.\nOther studies focus on the effect of bank ownership on the borrowing firm. For Japan,\nbank ownership is associated with better performance in financial distress (Hoshi,\nKashyap, and Scharfstein (1990)) and better access to financing (Hoshi, Kashyap, and\nScharfstein (1991)), but also with lower growth and profitability (Weinstein and Yafeh\n(1998)). For Germany, several studies find a positive effect of bank influence on firm\n(1985)), while Dittmann, Maug, and Schneider (2010) find that bankers on the firm's\nsupervisory board add little value. Bank equity ownership may be beneficial for two\nreasons: Banks may provide more financing or they may be efficient shareholders. Our\nresults suggest that the first is less likely to be the case than was previously thought.\n2. Institutional details\nOur source of identification is Germany's abolition of its corporate capital gains tax in\n2000. Before the reform, many German banks held equity stakes in German industrial\ncompanies. These equity stakes were part of a system of minority stakes and cross-\nholdings often called \"Germany Inc.\" (Deutschland AG) (H\u00f6pner and Krempel (2006)).\nMany of these holdings had been acquired in the distant past and thus had book values\nsignificantly below their market value (Edwards et al. (2004)). For example, some of\nthe holdings of Deutsche Bank in old industrial companies dated back to the companies'\nfoundation before World War II. Other equity stakes of banks were acquired in the\n1950s and 1960s, potentially to exercise control over industrial companies through\nboard representation. In the 1990s, German banks increasingly moved towards\ninvestment banking and wanted to divest their equity holdings to free up capital (Beyer\nimplied that banks would have been subject to a significant tax cost from divesting their\nequity holdings in German companies (Sautner and Villalonga (2010)).2 This lock-in\nwas lifted when the government introduced a tax exemption on the sale of equity stakes\nwith the explicit intention to facilitate the sale of equity stakes (Hoepner, 2000).\n2 Capital gains were taxed at 40% corporate tax and trade tax that varies across regions, but was\napproximately 10%. For more details see Edwards et al. (2004).\nThe abolition of the capital gains tax was part of a wider tax reform, which included a\nreduction in individual and corporate tax rates as well as a change in dividends taxation.\nHowever, there is no reason to believe that the general tax changes specifically affected\nbanks' lending to firms in which they hold equity.3 The tax reform was first announced in\nbecome effective on January 1, 2001. The abolition of the capital gains tax did not\nenter into force until January 1, 2002. However, there were ways for companies to divest\nholdings before 2002 and still capture the better tax treatment. For example, Deutsche\nBank sold a stake in Allianz on 6 June 2000 and stated in its investor relations release:\n\"The economic disposal has been achieved by an innovative structure which\nallows Deutsche Bank to obtain the full benefits from the upcoming tax reform\nin Germany. The transaction will qualify as a disposal for the Deutsche Bank\nGroup in its IAS accounts, giving rise to a capital gain in excess of EUR 2\nbillion, but without triggering a tax disposal in the current year.\"4\nFurthermore, anticipating the tax reform, banks may have changed their lending to firms\nin which they plan to sell equity and thus the tax reform may already have had an effect\nbefore January 1st, 2002. Accordingly, we use the announcement of the tax reform in\n2.2 The regulatory and supervisory environment\nOur sample period ranges from 1998 to 2005. It therefore lies entirely before the\nimplementation of the Basel II Accords in Germany in 20075. Thus, according to Basel\nI rules, equity stakes and loans were part of risk-weighted assets, which banks had to\nback with 4% core capital and with 8% total core and additional capital. The risk weight\nfor equity stakes was 100% and thus the same as that of uncollateralized corporate\nbonds. For tax and regulatory purposes, banks applied German GAAP accounting and\nthus valuing equity stakes at historical cost. Loans were generally valued at face value.\nWe conclude from this environment that, first, changes in the market value of the equity\nstakes did generally not affect the bank's book equity or risk-weighted assets. Second,\nthe tax reform created an incentive for banks to divest their holdings because a sale of\nan equity stake increased their capital by the amount of the capital gains.\n3 For a detailed description of the tax reform, see Keen (2002).\n4 \"Deutsche Bank reduces Allianz stake to 4.1%\" (DB Investor Relations Release) and \"Deutsche plays\nclever in Allianz sale to avoid CGT\" (article from http://www.efinancialnews.com).\n5 The Basel II Accords were published already in June 2004 and discussed before that. Therefore, German\nbanks might have taken the expected change in regulation into account during our sample period.\nDifferent to the United States, there are no lender liability laws in Germany. Thus,\nbanks do not risk equitable subordination in the case of bankruptcy if they are\nrepresented on the firm's supervisory board or hold the firm's equity (Dittmann, Maug,\nWe provide additional information on the German banking system and German\ncorporate governance in Appendix 2 to 4.\n3. Data and Variables\nOur data on equity holdings of German companies is from Who owns Whom? (Wer\ngeh\u00f6rt zu wem?) provided by Picoware as of July 1999. This database contains\nownership data for private and public companies. The data are based on public sources\nand self-reported information. In addition, we manually add holdings of banks reported\nin Hoppenstedt Aktienf\u00fchrer 2001 (these holdings are as of December 1999). To focus\non equity stakes rather than subsidiaries, we define an equity link as a holding by a bank\nin an industrial company of less than 50% equity. However, we do include equity\nholdings of a bank's subsidiary if the bank holds at least 75% of the subsidiary's\nequity.6 We exclude holdings in other banks, private equity companies and vehicles of\nproject finance using the industry information provided in Who owns Whom? as well as\nmanual checks. We exclude these holdings because they are more likely part of the\nnormal operations of the bank and thus are much less likely to be divested after the tax\nreform. After these filters, our sample includes 135 equity stakes that 26 banks held in\nWe also determine the year in which an equity stake is divested. This exercise is not\ntrivial given that both Who owns Whom? and Hoppenstedt Aktienf\u00fchrer provide only\nyearly cross-sections rather than a panel dataset. We choose a conservative measure of\ndivestiture, which only counts an equity stake as divested if a company is still covered\nin the data and the equity stake is listed as belonging to another owner7. We also ensure\nthrough manual checks that the new owner is indeed a different company and that the\nequity stake has not just moved into a different holding vehicle of the same bank. If a\ncompany disappears from the data before a divestiture, we set the time of divestiture to\nmissing.\n6 We also include the equity holdings of lower levels of subsidiaries (i.e. subsidiaries of subsidiaries) as\nlong as any link consists of at least 75%. The subsidiary can be a non-financial company. Results are also\nrobust to using a 50% cut-off instead.\n7 We treat an equity stake as divested if at least half of the equity has been sold.\nOur loan-level data comes from the German Large Credit Register\n(Millionenkreditevidenz) provided by the German Central Bank and covers the time\nperiod from 1998 to 2005. German banks must report their debt exposures to companies\nand individuals at the end of each quarter if the exposure exceeds EUR 1.5 million\nduring the quarter. For ease of interpretation, we refer to this quarterly exposure as a\nloan (following Khwaja and Mian (2008)). The credit exposure is further broken down\ninto on-balance sheet items such as loans and bonds, as well as off-balance sheet\nexposure through credit derivatives, guarantees and undrawn credit lines. We focus on\nthe total credit risk a bank faces towards a borrower.\nWe use four measures of loan size in the paper: Loan Size (log) is the natural logarithm\nof the size of the loan, while Loan Size (EUR million) is the unstandardized loan size\nwinsorized at the 1% and 99% threshold. Bank Share is the share of a borrower's total\ncredit that is provided by a bank. Borrower Percentile measures the importance of a\nborrower to a bank. It is a percentile based on the size of a borrower's loan relative to\nother borrowers of the bank. Detailed definitions of all variables are reported in\nAppendix 1.\nThe German Large Credit Register provides the most detailed data on the lending of\nGerman banks and has been used in other studies, such as Haselmann, Schoenherr, and\nVig (2017). However, it does not include loan terms, forcing us to focus on the size of\nthe loans.\nWe conduct our main analysis on the 26 banks that hold equity stakes in industrial\ncompanies. These large banks account for 59% of the German banking system by\nassets. An extended sample used in robustness checks includes other banks that are\ncovered by Who owns Whom? and have more than EUR 1 billion in total loans\noutstanding from 1998 to 1999 according to the German Large Credit Register. For\nthese 89 banks, we obtain balance sheet data as of December 1999 from the Regulatory\nCredit Information System (Bankaufsichtliches Kredit-Informationssystem, BAKIS) of\nthe German Central Bank. Extending the sample does not materially change our results.\nWe match the firms in the German Large Credit Register to the firms which are covered\nin Who owns Whom?. For publicly listed firms, balance sheet data of the last fiscal year\nending before December 1999 comes from Worldscope and stock market data from\nDatastream and Compustat Global. For private companies, we obtain balance sheet data\nfrom the Jalys/USTAN database, which was constructed for the rediscount business of\nthe German Central Bank. We match Jalys/USTAN to the German Large Credit\nRegister using the links employed in Haselmann, Schoenherr, and Vig (2017).\nJalys/USTAN is \"the best and most comprehensive firm data set in Germany\" for our\ntime period (St\u00f6ss (2001)). Still some companies are not covered in every year. If a\ncompany is not covered in 1999, we instead use the last data point available in the\ndataset going back to 1995. We manually collect information on the composition of\nsupervisory boards in 1999 from annual reports.\n3.5 Summary statistics\nWe include in our main analyses only banks and firms with equity links in 1999, which\nwe will refer to as the Inside Sample. Table 1 reports summary statistics for the Inside\nSample as of 1999. The firms in our sample are fairly large with average assets of EUR\n(median 7) banks. The high number of banking relationships allows us to use firm-time\neffects in our difference-in-difference set up. Half of the sample consists of publicly\nlisted companies.\nAlso the banks in our sample are large with mean assets of EUR 107 billion (median\nEUR 53 billion). On average, they hold equity stakes in 5.2 companies (median 1.5),\nmaking up 23% of the bank's equity on average (median 3.8%). This means that equity\nstakes are large enough that the associated cash-flow rights align the incentives of the\nbank with those of equity holders. Of our 26 banks, 11 banks belong to the commercial\nsector, 11 banks belong to the public sector (savings banks and their central institutions)\nand 4 banks belong to the cooperative sector.\nIf there is an equity link, a bank holds 14.6% of the firm's equity on average (median\n10.5%). For 66% of the equity links, the bank also provides a loan to the company. In\nthis case, the market value of equity is typically twice as large as the loan given that the\ndebt constitutes on average 36% (median 32%) of total financing.8 In 75% of the cases\nwhere the bank holds equity in the company, it is also represented on the company's\nsupervisory board.\n8 If the firm is privately listed, we estimate the market capitalization using a multiple of its book equity,\nwhere this multiple is the median of the book to equity ratio of publicly listed companies.\nTable 1: Summary statistics\nThis table displays summary statistics as of December 1999. Panel A covers variables on the firm level for all firms\nin which a bank holds an equity stake. Panel B reports the summary statistics on the bank level for the 26 banks\nwhich hold equity in an industrial company. Number of Equity stakes is the number of industrial companies in which\nthe bank holds equity. Value of Equity Stakes is the estimated market value of these stakes, while Equity Stakes /\nEquity is this value divided by the bank's equity. Panel C reports the summary statistics on the equity stake level. The\nsize of the stake is given in EUR million and as a percentage of the company's equity. Existence of a Loan is a\ndummy variable indicating whether the bank holding the equity gives a loan to the firm. Debt Share of Bank Funding\ngives the loan value from the bank to the company divided by the total funding (debt + equity) taking into account\nonly the 89 equity stakes with a loan. Board Link 1999 is an indicator variable equal to one if a representative of the\nbank sits on the firm's supervisory board. Panel D reports the summary statistics on the loan level. Following Khwaja\nand Mian (2008), we refer to a bank-firm pair as a loan, i.e. multiple loans are aggregated. All other variables are\ndefined in Appendix 1.\nPanel A: Firms\nPanel B: Banks\nPanel C: Equity stakes\nPanel D: Loans\nVariable Mean\nPercentile\nMedian\nPercentile\nStandard\nDeviation\nVariable Mean\nPercentile\nMedian\nPercentile\nStandard\nDeviation\nVariable Mean\nPercentile\nMedian\nPercentile\nStandard\nDeviation\nVariable Mean\nPercentile\nMedian\nPercentile\nStandard\nDeviation\n4. Results\n4.1 Announcement of the tax reform: Event study\nThe abolition of the capital gains tax was part of a wider tax reform. While the general\ntax reform was announced on December 21, 1999, the plan to abolish the corporate\ncapital gains tax was not confirmed until December 23, 1999. This enables us to\nexamine the market reaction to the capital gains tax announcement separately\n(following Edwards et al. (2004)). In Panel A of Figure 1, we plot the average stock\nreturns for banks with equity stakes around the announcement. Because almost all\npublicly listed German banks had equity stakes, we use German industrial companies\nand US banks as control groups to proxy for country and industry specific shocks.\nDuring a quiet stock market environment in the last week before Christmas, the stock\nprices of banks with equity stakes shot up by 5.1%, while the return for both control\ngroups was only 0.3%. This finding is consistent with Edwards et al. (2004) and von\nIn Panel B, we display the returns on the announcement day for the four largest German\nbanks, which also held the most equity stakes. To better understand these returns, we\ncompare them to the aggregate value of the banks' equity stakes. Deutsche Bank, whose\nequity stakes had the highest aggregate value (EUR 18.6 billion), experienced a stock\nprice increase of 13.6%, while Commerzbank, whose equity stakes had the lowest value\n(EUR 2.2 billion), experience a stock price increase of only 4.7%. This pattern suggests\nthat the holding of equity stakes determined the market reaction. The average increase\nin market capitalization on the announcement day divided by the aggregate value of\nequity stakes was 33%. Given that the tax rate before the reform was 50%, the capital\ngains made up at least 66% of the value of the equity stakes and the surprise element of\nthe tax reform was at least 66%.9 In addition to the event study, newspaper articles\nsuggest that the tax reform was a surprise to the market. For example, Handelsblatt, a\nGerman business newspaper, headlined \"Eichel [the German minister of finance]\nsurprises stock market with a Christmas present\".10 The fact that the reform was a\nsurprise alleviates worries that equity stakes or lending decisions before 1999 were\nendogenous to the anticipation of the tax reform.\n9 The value increase of the equity stakes on the announcement day should depend on the amount of\ncapital gains and on the change in probability of the passage of the tax reform. It can be approximately\ncomputed as:   =           0.50 =\n0.33 where 50% is the capital gains tax rate. This calculation implies that both Change in Probability of\nTax Reform and Capital Gains were at least 66%.\n10 \"Eichel \u00fcberrascht die B\u00f6rse mit einem Weihnachtsgeschenk\", Handelsblatt, December 24, 1999.\n4.2 Divestitures of equity stakes following the tax reform\nSeveral prior studies find that most of the bank equity stakes were divested following\nwe confirm this result for our dataset. We show that 75% of banks' equity stakes in\nindustrial firms were divested at least by half until 2005.\nThis result is not surprising given that banks had strong incentives to divest their equity\nstakes: First, banks realize large accounting gains by selling the holdings, which\nimproves their capital position and leads to potential income and reputation gains for the\nbank's management. Second, divesting a holding leads to a cash proceed, which\nimproves the liquidity position of the bank. Third, there was a general election in\nGermany in September 2002, and the political opposition had announced a plan to\nreintroduce capital gains taxation. The opposition narrowly lost the election and the\ncorporate capital gains tax has not returned since. However, in 2002 the opposition was\nahead in the polls potentially causing some banks to sell their holdings to front-run a\nreturn of the tax (Pauly and Sch\u00e4fer (2002)).\n4.3 Cross-sectional correlation between equity stakes and lending\nSeveral prior papers find a positive correlation between banks' equity stakes and\nlending, for example in Japan and Portugal ((Ant\u0103o, Ferreira and Lacerda (2011), Flath\ncross-sectional correlation can be found in our data for Germany. We report our results\nin Table 2. In Panel A, we use a dataset with all possible bank-firm combinations,\ndependent variable Lending Relationship is a dummy variable equal to one if the\ncompany received a loan from the bank in December 1999. The explanatory variable of\ninterest is Equity Link in 1999. We control for geographic proximity using dummy\nvariables equal to one if bank and firm are located in the same city or the same region.\nWe use size, leverage and tangibility of assets as firm-specific controls. In regressions 2\nto 4, we replace them with firm fixed effects. Since our dependent variables are binary,\nwe use a logit specification, which we replace with a linear probability model (OLS) in\nthe specifications with firm fixed effects due to the incidental parameter problem.11 We\ndouble-cluster standard errors at the bank and firm level. We find that an equity link is\ncorrelated with a higher probability of a lending relationship, significant at the 1 percent\n11 Since our sample includes many firms, but only few banks, a simple non-linear probability model\ncannot be consistently estimated due to an incidental parameters problem (Chamberlain (1980); Puri,\nRocholl and Steffen (2011) and Khwaja and Mian (2008), we employ a linear probability model\nestimated with OLS.\nlevel in all our specifications. Based on the results of the logit regression, we predict a\nprobability of having a lending relationship of 44.1% for bank-firm pairs with an equity\nstake, while it is only 18.7% for bank-firm pairs without an equity stake.\nTable 2: Comparison to other studies: Cross-sectional correlation\nThis table displays cross-sectional regressions as of December 1999, examining whether equity links are correlated\nwith the existence and the size of a lending relationship. The analysis includes only banks and firms with equity\nstakes. In Panel A, the observational unit is a bank-firm pair. The dependent variable is a dummy variable equal to\none if the bank provides a loan to the firm in December 1999. In Regressions 1, we estimate a logit model. In\nRegressions 2 to 4 we estimate a linear probability model, i.e. OLS. In Panel B, the observational unit is a loan (i.e. a\nbank-firm pair in which the bank provides credit to the firm). The dependent variables are Loan Size (log), Loan Size\n(EUR million), Bank Share, and Borrower Percentile. The explanatory variable of interest is a dummy variable equal\nto one if the bank holds an equity stake in the company. All standard errors are double-clustered at the bank and the\nfirm level. We report t-statistics below the coefficients in parenthesis. *, **, *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5%,\nand 1% level, respectively.\nPanel A: Lending Relationship\nPanel B: Size of Lending Relationship\nLending Relationship\nRegression Method Logit OLS OLS OLS\nFirm Fixed Effects No Yes Yes Yes\nBank Fixed Effects Yes No Yes Yes\nLoan Size (log)\nLoan Size\n(EUR million)\nBank Share Borrower Percentile\nFirm Fixed Effects Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nBank Fixed Effects No Yes No Yes No Yes No Yes\nNext, we want to examine whether an equity link is also associated with larger loans\nconditional on the existence of a lending relationship. We run OLS regressions where\neach observation is a bank-firm pair for which average lending in December 1999 is\npositive. The results are presented in Panel B. We find that in the cases where a bank\nholds the firm's equity, it lends 2.6 times as much or EUR 21.9 million more.12 A bank\nthat holds an equity stake in the company on average provides 8.9 percentage points\nmore of the company's debt and the company ranks 11 percentage points higher\namongst the banks borrowers. All these effects are significant at least at the 1% level.\nThese results indicate that there is the same positive cross-sectional correlation between\nequity stakes and lending volume in Germany as has been shown in previous studies for\nother countries. This suggests that the findings of our study may be extended to other\ncountries as well. However, it is important to note that the positive cross-sectional\ncorrelation does not imply that equity stakes are beneficial for lending as we discuss in\nthe next section.\n4.4 How our analysis addresses endogeneity\nThe positive cross-sectional correlation between equity stakes and lending does not\nnecessarily show that equity stakes benefit lending but could also be explained by\nomitted variable bias or reverse causality. In this section, we explain how our\nidentification strategy addresses this issue.\nAssume the bank chooses the amount of debt (D) and equity (E) invested in the firm\njointly to maximize its profits ():\n(, ) = arg max\n,\nD* and E* are the optimal levels of debt and equity that maximize profit for the bank (if\nit is unconstrained). If equity stakes are beneficial for lending, then debt and equity are\ncomplements, i.e. adding an extra unit of debt raises profits more if the bank owns more\nequity in the firm:\n\n \nHowever, omitted variables, such as whether the bank has a good relationship with the\nfirm, can lead to a correlation between D and E even if Equation 2 is not fulfilled. We\ncan address this issue by using the tax reform as a natural experiment. Before the tax\nreform, banks were essentially forced to hold on to their equity stakes due to the high\ncapital gains tax.13 This means that they were not at the unconstrained optimum\n(\n, \n), but at a constrained optimum (\n, \n), where the bank chooses the optimal\nlending D** conditional on a suboptimal large equity stake, \n:\nD = arg max\n\n (D|E\nWhere E\n > E\nAfter the tax reform, the constraint is lifted and the bank moves from the constrained\noptimum (\n, \n) to the unconstrained optimum (\n, \n). As we have shown above,\nbanks indeed divested most of their equity stakes following the tax reform, suggesting\nthat Inequality 4 holds. In fact, it seems that in most cases the optimal level of equity is\nzero ( = 0), as most of the stakes were fully divested. This is not surprising given the\nlarge regulatory capital cost of holding equity as a bank.\nGiven that the change in the level of equity from \n to \nis exogenously caused by the\ntax reform, any change in D must be due to the effect of E on D.14 Thus, if equity stakes\nare indeed beneficial for lending, i.e. if Equation 2 is true, we obtain that:\nD < D\nThis means that we should see a decrease in lending to formerly equity-linked firms\nafter the tax reform if equity stakes benefit lending. Instead, as we lay out in the next\nsections, we observe that the amount of lending to formerly equity-linked firms does not\nchange (relative to firms without an equity link), suggesting that the cross-sectional\ncorrelation is due to endogeneity issues.\n4.5 Impact of the tax reform on lending: Graphical evidence\nAs discussed above, we would expect a decrease in lending to (formerly) equity-linked\nfirms after the tax reform if equity stakes benefit lending. Thus, we compare how\nlending changes after the tax reform to firms in which the bank held an equity stake in\n1999. Since the treatment takes place at the bank-firm level, we do not need other firms\nor banks as a control group. Rather, we include only banks and firms with at least one\nequity link in 1999 in our sample (Inside Sample) and use their lending relationships\n13 We implicitly assume here that the original reason to purchase the equity stake has disappeared over\ntime, which seems a reasonable assumption given that banks owned many of their stakes for several\ndecades (see Section 2.1).\n14 One important assumption here is that the profit function  does not change after the tax reform.\nEmpirically, we control for any change in the profit function by including bank-year fixed effects in our\nregression. This means we examine the change in the bank's lending to the firm in which it held equity\nrelative to its lending to other firms. As long changes in the profit function affect lending to all firms in\nthe same way, they do not influence our results.\nwithout an equity link as the control group. Using this Inside Sample has the advantage\nthat our results cannot be driven by different time trends between treated and control\nfirms or banks. To focus only on existing lending relationships, we only include bank-\nfirm pairs for which the average lending before the tax reform (1998 to 1999) was\npositive.\nWe start with a simple graphical analysis in Figure 3 where we compute the average log\nloan size each year for bank-firm pairs with and without an equity link. If equity stakes\nbenefit lending, we would expect the lending to firms with equity links to decrease after\nthe tax reform when equity stakes are divested and the benefits from the equity stakes\ndecrease. We do not find any evidence that lending to firms with equity links decreases\nrelative to firms without equity links. Rather, the two lines are parallel both before and\nafter the tax reform.\nFigure 3: Effect of the tax reform on lending\nThis figure reports the average log loan size for bank-firm pairs with and without equity stakes. The analysis includes\nonly banks and firms with equity stakes. The vertical line indicates the announcement of the tax reform in December\nLoan Size (log)\n4.6 Impact of the tax reform on lending: Difference-in-difference\nNext, we conduct a more rigorous difference-in-difference analysis to study how the\nsale of equity holdings following the tax reform affected lending. We use the following\nset up that controls for bank and firm specific trends:\n ,,\n= \n+ ,\n+ ,\n+ ,\n  \n+   ,\n  \nWithout Equity Link\nWith Equity Link\nwhere f denotes the firm, b the bank, q the quarter, y the year and pr the post tax reform\nperiod. Equity Stake 1999 is a dummy variable equal to one if the bank holds an equity\nstake in the firm in 1999 and Post Reform is a dummy variable equal to one from 2000\nto 2005 (after the announcement of the tax reform). The explanatory variable of interest\nis the interaction between Equity Stake 1999 and Post Reform (we do not include the\nmain effects of this interaction because they are multicollinear with the fixed effects).\nThis specification measures how the loan size of bank-firm pairs with equity links in\n1999 changes relative to bank-firm pairs without links in 1999 following the tax reform.\nThis is an intention-to-treat analysis, where we only condition our analysis on the\nexistence of an equity stake in 1999 rather than the endogenous decision to divest it.\nThis is essentially a reduced form instrumental variable approach, in which the sale of an\nequity stake is instrumented with the existence of an equity stake prior to the tax reform.\nWe include quarter fixed effects (denoted ) to control for changes in the economic\nenvironment and bank-firm fixed effects (denoted ,) to control for any time-invariant\nheterogeneity at the bank-firm-level. In addition, there may be time-varying effects on\nthe firm or bank-level such as changes in credit demand or credit supply, which are\npotentially correlated with having an equity link. For example, banks may have used the\nadditional capital from divesting their equity stakes to increase overall lending. We\naccount for these issues by including bank and firm fixed effects interacted with yearly\ndummy variables (denoted , and ,). Intuitively, bank-year fixed effects imply that\nwe examine the change in the bank's lending to the firm in which it held equity relative\nto its lending to other firms, while firm-year fixed effects imply that we study how the\ncompany's borrowing from the (formerly) equity-linked bank changes relative to its\nborrowing from other banks. With this regression set up, the only omitted variables that\ncan distort our results are relationship-specific variables which are correlated with\nequity links and have a time-varying effect. Thus, we include Same Region and Same\nCity indicators interacted with Post Reform to control for the time-varying effect of\ngeographic proximity.\nWe display our results in Panel A of Table 3. We use the main specification described\nabove and a specification in which bank-year and firm-year fixed effects are replaced\nwith firm\u00adPost Reform fixed effects. We use all four of our loan size measures as\ndependent variables. For none of our dependent variables the tax reform decreases\nlending for bank-firm pairs with an equity link in 1999. In fact, all coefficients are\n(insignificantly) positive. This finding does not suggest that equity stakes benefit\nlending. Rather, equity stakes seem to be immaterial to lending and the positive cross-\nsectional correlation is likely explained by endogeneity issues.\nTable 3: Impact of the tax reform on lending: Difference-in-difference\nThis table presents difference-in-difference regressions examining the effect of the tax reform on lending. The\nobservational unit in this regression is the bank-firm-quarter and the time period spans from 1998 to 2005. A bank-\nfirm pair is only included if there is a lending relationship before the tax reform (average lending from 1998 to 1999\nis positive). The dependent variables are Loan Size (log), Loan Size (EUR million), Bank Share, and Borrower\nPercentile. Variables are defined in Appendix 1. In all regressions, we include fixed effects for the bank-firm pair and\nquarter. In Regressions 1, 3, 5 and 7 we add firm\u00adpost reform fixed effects. In regressions 2, 4, 6 and 8 we add bank-\nyear and firm-year fixed effects. In Panel A, the main explanatory variable of interest is the interaction between\nEquity Link 1999 and Post Reform. The main effects Equity Link 1999 and Post Reform are not included because they\nare multicollinear with the fixed effects. In Panel B, we exclude all bank-firm relationships with equity stakes that\nwere not sold or for which divestiture information is missing. All standard errors are double-clustered at the bank and\nthe firm level. We report t-statistics below the coefficients in parenthesis. *, **, *** indicate significance at the 10%,\n5%, and 1% level, respectively.\nPanel A: All Equity Stakes\nPanel B: Only Divested Equity Stakes\nAs discussed above, we conduct an intention-to-treat analysis, where our treated group\nalso includes equity stakes that were not divested after the tax reform. We do this\nbecause the decision to divest an equity stake is endogenous. However, given that we\nwould not expect any effect on lending if equity stakes are not sold, this set-up biases\nour results towards zero. This could potentially explain why we do not observe a\nnegative effect on lending. To address this concern, we run our analysis again, but\nremove from our sample all bank-firm pairs with equity stakes that were not\ndivested after the tax reform (or whose divestiture information is missing). The\nresults are presented in Panel B. They are very close to the results in Panel A\nand all coefficients remain positive.\nLoan Size (log)\nLoan Size\n(EUR million)\nBank Share Borrower Percentile\nBank-Firm and Quarter F.E.

For example, if a bank has negative information\nabout the firm, it may choose to divest the equity stake and reduce lending.\nHowever, such endogeneity would bias the analysis towards finding a negative effect\nof divestitures on lending. Thus, if we do not find a negative effect in this\nendogeneous analysis, it suggests that the causal effect is also not negative.\nWe start with a simple graphical analysis. We plot Bank Share, i.e. the average share\nof the firm's total borrowing provided by the bank around the divestiture time. We\nfocus on Bank Share, because it controls for general demand effects. The results are\npresented in Figure 4. We do not observe a reduction in lending after the\ndivestiture. To the contrary, while lending slightly decreases before the divestiture, it\nincreases somewhat after the divestiture.\nFigure 4: Lending around divestitures\nThis figure reports the average Bank Share for bank-firm pairs with equity links around the time of the divestiture\nof the equity link. Bank Share is defined as the percentage of the firms' borrowing that the linked bank provides.\nThe years are measured relative to the time of divestiture. Year zero is the year in which the equity stake was\ndivested.\nBank Share for bank-firm pairs with equity link\nNext we study the effect of divestitures in a regression setting. We use a setting similar\nto the difference-in-difference analysis in Table 3, but we replace the interaction of\nEquity Link 1999 * Post Reform with Equity Link is Divested, which is a dummy\nvariable equal to one after the equity stake is divested and zero before. For bank-firm\npairs without an equity stake, this variable is always zero. Therefore, it captures how\nlending changes after the divestiture relative to bank-firm pairs without an equity stake.\nBank Share\nYears relative to divestiture\nThe results are presented in Table 4 and are very similar to the results in Table 3. Once\nagain, all coefficients are very close to zero and most of them are (insignificantly)\npositive. This finding suggests that there is no decrease in lending after the divestiture\nof equity stakes. Given that endogeneity effects should bias the results to be more\nnegative, these findings suggest that there is no negative causal effect of divestitures on\nlending, suggesting that equity stakes do not benefit lending and that the cross-sectional\ncorrelation is driven by endogeneity issues.\nTable 4: Impact of divestitures on lending\nThis table presents difference-in-difference regressions examining the effect of divestitures on lending. The\nobservational unit in this regression is the bank-firm-quarter and the time period spans from 1998 to 2005. A bank-\nfirm pair is only included if there is a lending relationship before the tax reform (average lending from 1998 to 1999\nis positive). The dependent variables are Loan Size (log), Loan Size (EUR million), Bank Share, and Borrower\nPercentile. Variables are defined in Appendix 1. In all regressions, we include fixed effects for the bank-firm pair and\nquarter. In Regressions 1, 3, 5 and 7 we add firm\u00adpost reform fixed effects. In regressions 2, 4, 6 and 8 we add bank-\nyear and firm-year fixed effects. In Panel A, the main explanatory variable of interest is the interaction between\nEquity Link 1999 and Post Reform. The main explanatory variable is Equity Link is Divested, which is equal to 1 after\nan equity has been divested and 0 before it is divested or if there is no equity link. All standard errors are double-\nclustered at the bank and the firm level. We report t-statistics below the coefficients in parenthesis. *, **, *** indicate\nsignificance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.\nAs described above, we do not find any negative effect of exogenous divestitures of\nequity stakes on lending when focusing on our whole sample. However, there may be a\nnegative effect in certain subsamples in which bank equity ownership is especially\nbeneficial. We consider two such subsamples: First, the proposed monitoring benefits of\nequity ownership may be higher if the equity stake allows the bank to be represented on\nthe company's board. The bank would likely lose this board seat after divesting the\nequity stake, making the divestiture more important. Second, bank monitoring through\nequity stakes may be more important in private firms, because they are more opaque\nand less monitored by the general public. There is a second reason, why bank equity\nstakes may be more beneficial in private firms: If a bank has a close lending relationship\nwith a firm, it may get inside information that gives it monopoly power. If the firm turns\nLoan Size (log)\nLoan Size\n(EUR million)\nBank Share Borrower Percentile\nBank-Firm and Quarter F.E.

No Yes No Yes No Yes No Yes\nto other banks, they will perceive this as a negative signal (Sharpe (1990), Rajan (1992),\nownership in the firm can help prevent such a hold-up problem. Given that private firms\nare more opaque, they are more likely to be subject to such a hold-up problem.\nTherefore, we now split our sample by board links and whether the firm is publicly\nlisted.\nWe present the results in Table 5. In Panel A, we report difference-in-difference\nregressions, where we split the treated group by whether a representative of the bank\nsits on the firm's supervisory board in 1999 (we will refer to this as a board link). More\nspecifically, we define two dummy variables: Equity Link with Board Link 1999 is\nequal to one if the bank holds an equity stake in the firm in 1999 and there is a board\nlink, while Equity Link without Board Link 1999 equals one if there is an equity link,\nbut no board link in 1999. If a bank-firm pair does not have an equity link in 1999, both\nvariables are set to zero. By including both of these variables (interacted with Post\nReform) in the regression, we estimate the effect of equity stakes with and without\nboard links both compared to bank-firm pairs without equity links. This set up is\ncomparable to a sample split, but has the advantage of using a larger sample to compute\ncoefficients of fixed effects and control variables. We do not find a negative effect of\nthe tax reform on lending in either subgroup. Almost all coefficients are positive and the\nones that are negative have t-statistics very close to zero. In fact, for some measures of\nloan size we even find a positive significant effect. This finding suggests that equity\nstakes do not benefit lending even when they allow the bank to obtain representation of\nthe firm's supervisory board.\nNext, in Panel B, we conduct a similar analysis where we split the treated group by\nwhether the firm is publicly listed. Once again, almost all coefficients remain\n(insignificantly) positive and in those two cases where coefficients are negative, the t-\nstatistics are very close to zero. This finding suggests that equity stakes do not benefit\nlending even when the firm is not publicly listed. More generally, these findings show\nthat we do not find an effect of equity stakes on lending in those cases where equity\nstakes are most likely to benefit lending.\nTable 5: Sample splits\nThis table presents difference-in-difference regressions examining the effect of the tax reform on lending. The\nobservational unit in this regression is the bank-firm-quarter and the time period spans from 1998 to 2005. A bank-\nfirm pair is only included if there is a lending relationship before the tax reform (average lending from 1998 to 1999\nis positive). The dependent variables are Loan Size (log), Loan Size (EUR million), Bank Share, and Borrower\nPercentile. Variables are defined in Appendix 1. In all regressions, we include fixed effects for the bank-firm pair and\nquarter. In Regressions 1, 3, 5 and 7 we add firm\u00adpost reform fixed effects. In regressions 2, 4, 6 and 8 we add bank-\nyear and firm-year fixed effects. In Panel A, we split firms with equity links in 1999 into those that also had a board\nlink to the bank and those that did not. In Panel B, we split firms with equity links in 1999 into two groups depending\non whether the firm is publicly listed. The main effects of the interactions are not included because they are\nmulticollinear with the fixed effects. All standard errors are double-clustered at the bank and the firm level. We report\nt-statistics below the coefficients in parenthesis. *, **, *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level,\nrespectively.\nPanel A: Split by board link\nPanel B: Split into public and private firms\n4.9 External validity\nWhile using a natural experiment has the important advantage of addressing\nendogeneity, it always comes at the cost of being limited to a specific sample and time\nperiod. Thus, it is important to determine whether the results can be generalized to other\nsettings. This question cannot be formally tested, but we examine in this section\nwhether external validity seems likely.\nLoan Size (log)\nLoan Size\n(EUR million)\nBank Share Borrower Percentile\nEquity Link without Board Link\nBank-Firm and Quarter F.E.

Given that we do not find any effect of the\ndivestitures of these large equity stakes, it seems unlikely that smaller equity stakes\nshould benefit lending. Thus, it is likely that our findings transfer to other countries\nwhere banks hold smaller equity stakes. This is further supported by the fact that we\nfind the same cross-sectional correlation as studies in Portugal and Japan (see section\nNext, to assess how banks owning equity stakes compare to the entire population of\nGerman banks, we plot the 50 largest German banks by assets in Figure 5. Of the 26\nbanks with equity stakes, 22 are amongst the largest 50. In general, the 26 banks with\nequity stakes in 1999 account for 59% of the total assets of the German banking system.\nThus, they are representative of the German banking system as a whole.\nFigure 5: Size of banks with equity stakes\nThis figure illustrates the size of the banks that own equity stakes (Inside Sample) compared to other German banks\n(excluding special banks such as mortgage banks). Bank Size is defined as total assets in 1999 taken from the\nBankscope database. We plot the 50 largest banks according to this measure as well as the four banks that own equity\nstakes and are not amongst the largest 50 banks.\nTop 50 banks by size (assets)\nAssets (billion)\nSize Rank\nWith Equity Stakes\nNo Equity Stake\nAggregated Market Share\nBanks with equity stakes: 59%\nBanks without equity stakes: 41%\nIn Figure 6, we compare firms with equity links to a control group matched by assets\nand the criterion whether the firm is publicly listed. We find that there is no significant\ndifference between the two groups for several control variables and in terms of industry\ncomposition. Thus, our firms are representative of German firms in general.\nTo summarize, the features of our data make it likely that our findings are general and\nnot specific to our sample. Nonetheless, external validity can only be verified using\ndifferent samples, which calls for further research in this area.\nFigure 6: Comparison of firms with and without equity links\nThis figure compares firms with banks as equity holders to a control sample matched by assets and whether the\ncompany is publicly traded. We match each company having a bank as equity holder to the next smaller and next\nlarger company by assets within the group of public or private companies respectively (due to two firms with equity\nlinks being next to each other, the control sample is not exactly twice as large). In Panel A, we compare the firms\nbased on 12 Fama-French industry groups. In Panel B, we report the means and medians for firm-specific control\nvariables in 1999. Firm Leverage is defined as book value of debt divided by total assets. Firm Tangibility of Assets\nis defined as cash and equivalents plus net PPE divided by total assets. Number of Bank Relationships is the number\nof banks from which the company receives a loan. Return on Assets is EBIT divided by total assets. Profit Margin is\nnet income divided by sales. Asset Turnover is sales divided by assets. We also report a Student t-test for the\ndifference in means and a Wilcoxon rank-sum test for the difference in medians. *, **, *** indicate significance at\nthe 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.\nPanel A: 12 Fama-French industry groups\nPanel B: Summary Statistics\nMean Median\nNo bank as\nequity holder\nBank as equity\nholder\nT-test of\ndifference\nNo bank as\nequity holder\nBank as equity\nholder\nZ-test of\ndifference\nWith bank as equity holder\nWithout bank as equity holder\n5. Robustness checks\n5.1 Less fixed effects\nGiven that the main result of our paper is that there is no significant effect, one can be\nconcerned that we do not find statistically significant results, because our tests do not\nhave enough power. The power of our test will be reduced by the large number of fixed\neffects we employ to control for supply and demand effects. Thus, in the robustness check\nin Table 6, we show results using two specifications with less fixed effects. In the first\nspecification, we drop the firm-year and bank-year fixed effects as well as the controls for\ngeographical proximity. This barely changes our results at all. In the second specification,\nwe add again the controls for geographical proximity and include bank-Post Reform fixed\neffects (but exclude firm-time fixed effects). This change does also not alter our results\nmuch, suggesting that they are not driven by the specific set of fixed effects we use.\nTable 6: Robustness check: Fewer Fixed Effects\nThis table presents a robustness check to Table 3 with less fixed effects. The observational unit in this regression is\nthe bank-firm-quarter and the time period spans from 1998 to 2005. A bank-firm pair is only included if there is a\nlending relationship before the tax reform (average lending from 1998 to 1999 is positive). The dependent variables\nare Loan Size (log), Loan Size (EUR million), Bank Share, and Borrower Percentile. Variables are defined in\nAppendix 1. In all regressions, we include fixed effects for the bank-firm pair and quarter. In regressions 2, 4, 6 and 8\nwe add bank-Post Reform fixed effects. In Panel A, the main explanatory variable of interest is the interaction\nbetween Equity Link 1999 and Post Reform. The main effects Equity Link 1999 and Post Reform are not included\nbecause they are multicollinear with the fixed effects. In Panel B, we exclude all bank-firm relationships with equity\nstakes that were not sold or for which divestiture information is missing. All standard errors are double-clustered at\nthe bank and the firm level. We report t-statistics below the coefficients in parenthesis. *, **, *** indicate\nsignificance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.\nPanel A: All Equity Stakes\nPanel B: Only Divested Equity Stakes\nLoan Size (log)\nLoan Size\n(EUR million)\nBank Share Borrower Percentile\nBank-Firm and Quarter F.E.

Using this Inside Sample has the advantage that our results cannot be driven by\ndifferent time trends between treated and control firms or banks. The disadvantage is\nthat bank-firm pairs in the control sample may be indirectly affected by the tax reform\nbecause the firm (bank) always has an equity link to another bank (firm). Therefore, we\nshow in this section that our results are robust to conducting the same analysis on a\nlarger sample. In this sample, we include all 89 banks that are covered in Who owns\naccording to the German Large Credit Register, as well as all firms covered in Who\nowns whom? with assets above EUR 5 million. As the sample is larger, we report\nregressions using Difference in Loan Size as the dependent variable (following the\nmethodology of Khwaja and Mian (2008)).15. We report the results of this specification\nin Table 7. In Panel A, we repeat our analysis on the Inside Sample to show robustness\nto the alternative methodology. As expected given the similarity of the two approaches,\nthe results are very similar. In Panel B, we report results for the full sample of all banks\nand firms. Once again, all coefficients remain positive and the positive effect for\nBorrower Percentile even becomes significant. Finally, in Panel C, we use only firms\nthat do not have equity links with any bank as the control group. This set up has the\nadvantage that the control firms are not affected by the tax reform. However, this comes\nat the cost of not being able to control for firm-specific trends because the control group\nconsists of different firms than the treated group. Thus, we report regressions where we\nreplace the firm fixed effects with firm controls. Once again all coefficients are positive\nand some are even statistically significant.\n15 Due to the larger sample, it is computationally infeasible to run a full-fledged panel model as in Table 2\nand Table 3. Due to data confidentiality reasons, we have to run all analyses on the computers of the\nGerman central bank, which have low computing power.\nTable 7: Robustness check: Different control groups and regression set up\nThis table presents regressions examining the effect of the tax reform on lending using different control groups. The\ndependent variables are differences averages between the pre and post-tax reform period (following Khwaja and Mian\ncontains the average over all quarters from 2000 to 2005. The regression includes only bank-firm pairs for which pre-\ntax reform lending is positive. In Panel A, the sample consists only of firms and banks that have an equity link (as in\nTables 3). In Panel B, the sample consists of all banks and companies in our wider sample, i.e. banks that are covered\nin Who owns whom? and have aggregate average lending of more than EUR 1 billion before the tax reform (1998 to\n1999) as well as firms that are covered in Who owns whom? and have assets above 5 million EUR. In Panel C, we\nexclude non-linked loans of companies with equity links. In Panel A and Panel B, we report specifications with bank\nfixed effects as well as specifications with bank and firm fixed effects. In Panel C, we replace firm fixed effects with\nfirm controls (because firm fixed effects cannot be estimated). In all regressions, we include three sets of loan size\nquartile fixed effects based on Loan Size, Bank Share and Borrower Percentile before the tax reform (average from\n1998 to 1999). All standard errors are double-clustered at the bank and the firm level. We report t-statistics below the\ncoefficients in parenthesis. *, **, *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.\nPanel A: Banks and firms with equity stakes\nPanel B: All banks and firms\nPanel C: Only different firms\nDifference in\nLoan Size (log)\nDifference in\nLoan Size\n(EUR million)\nDifference in\nBank Share\nDifference in\nBorrower Percentile\nFirm Fixed Effects Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nBank Fixed Effects No Yes No Yes No Yes No Yes\nDifference in\nLoan Size (log)\nDifference in\nLoan Size\n(EUR million)\nDifference in\nBank Share\nDifference in\nBorrower Percentile\nFirm Fixed Effects Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nBank Fixed Effects No Yes No Yes No Yes No Yes\nDifference in\nLoan Size (log)\nDifference in\nLoan Size\n(EUR million)\nDifference in\nBank Share\nDifference in\nBorrower Percentile\nBank Fixed Effects No Yes No Yes No Yes No Yes\n5.3 Equity repurchases following the tax reform\nOur results could be influenced by banks extending credit to firms in order to enable\nthese firms to buy back the equity stake from the bank. In this section, we study whether\nour results are driven by this phenomenon. Specifically, we examine whether firms with\nan equity link exhibit an increase in the number of stock repurchases following the tax\nreform. We report the results in Table 8. The dependent variable in this regression is a\ndummy variable equal to one if the firm undertakes a buyback in a year measured as an\nincrease in the number of treasury shares held by the firm. In Regression 1, we estimate\na logit model only after the tax reform, which shows that there is no effect of equity\nstakes on repurchases cross-sectionally. In Regressions 2 to 4, we apply a difference-in-\ndifference set up using a linear probability model in the sample from 1998 to 2005.\nNone of the specifications shows an increase of repurchases for firms with equity links.\nThe coefficients are never significant and in two cases they are, in fact, negative. This\nfinding suggests that the banks did not sell their equity stakes to the specific firms.\nTable 8: Equity repurchases following the tax reform\nThis table presents regressions examining the effect of the tax reform on the number of equity repurchases depending\non whether the firm has a bank as an equity holder. The dependent variable in this regression is a dummy variable\nequal to one if there was an increase in the number of treasury shares in a year and equal to zero if the change was\nzero (and neither value was missing). We base this variable first on the number of treasury shares from\nUSTAN/Jalys. If it cannot be determined (because either value is missing), we use data from Compustat Global\ninstead. In Regressions 1, we estimate a logit model only after the tax reform. In Regressions 2 to 4, we estimate a\ndifference-in-difference set up using a linear probability model, i.e. OLS. In Regression 4, we add 12 Fama-French\nIndustry fixed effects interacted with Post Reform. All standard errors are clustered at the firm level. The main effects\nof the interacttions are not included because they are multicollinear with the fixed effects. We report t-statistics below\nthe coefficients in parenthesis. *, **, *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.\nRepurchase Dummy\nFirm Tangibility of Assets * Post\nReform\nSample Period After Tax Reform Full Sample Full Sample Full Sample\nRegression Method Logit OLS OLS OLS\nFirm Fixed Effects No Yes Yes Yes\nYear Fixed Effects No Yes Yes Yes\nIndustry\u00adPost Reform Fixed Effects No No No Yes\nIn Germany, banks are allowed to exercise voting rights on behalf of their customers\nunless the customer instructs the bank how to vote. This proxy-voting is often seen as\nan additional channel of bank influence (e.g. Gorton and Schmid (2000)) and may be a\nreason why voting rights from equity stakes are less relevant in Germany. We examine\nthe extent of proxy voting using data from the German Central Bank on the shares that\nbanks hold in custody (Depotstatistik). The data is only available from 2005. Since\nprivate investors stock market participation did not dramatically change in this time\nperiod, the 2005 values should be a good approximation for 1999. On average, all\nprivate customers of a bank combined hold only 0.66% of shares in a sample company\n(median is 0.05%, 90th percentile is 1.5%). Thus, even if none of the private customers\nvoted themselves, the importance of proxy-voting is small compared to the importance\nof equity stakes, which had an average size of 14.6% (median 10.5%).\n6. Conclusion\nThis paper studies how a bank's equity stake in a borrowing firm affects lending to that\nfirm. Several papers have argued that equity stakes may be beneficial for lending\nbecause the control rights of the equity stake provide the lender with an advantage in\nmonitoring the borrower and the cash flow rights align the incentives of debt and equity\nholders. Indeed, the prior literature has documented that equity stakes and lending are\npositively correlated. However, such a positive cross-sectional correlation does not\nnecessarily mean that equity stakes benefit lending, but may also be driven by\nendogeneity issues.\nIn this paper, we address such endogeneity issues by using the German capital gains tax\nreform in 2000 as a natural experiment. The tax reform abolished the corporate capital\ngains tax of 50%, enabling banks to divest their equity stakes in industrial companies.\nWe find that banks sell most of their equity stakes in industrial firms after the tax\nreform. However, we cannot find any evidence that banks reduced lending to these\nfirms following the divestitures. If anything, there is an (insignificant) increase in\nlending. This suggests that the positive cross-sectional correlation between equity stakes\nand lending does not imply that equity stakes benefit lending. Rather equity stakes seem\nto be immaterial to lending.\nThus, the positive cross-sectional correlation between equity stakes and lending, which\nwe also confirm in our sample, seems to be driven by endogeneity issues. For example,\nbanks may use their private information from lending to invest into a firm's equity\n(reverse causality) or good relationships with a company may cause a bank to invest in\nboth, the firm's debt and equity (omitted variable bias). An alternative interpretation is\nthat an equity stakes might facilitate the initiation of a lending relationship, but provide\nno further benefits afterward. We can only speculate which mechanism is at work here,\nbut our results suggest that the cross-sectional evidence is misleading for established\nlending relationships.\nOur findings have important policy implications for bank-based economies such as\nGermany and Japan as well as for the United States where banks are allowed to hold\nlarge equity stakes in their borrowers since the repeal of the Glass\u00adSteagall Act. Our\nresults indicate that the benefits of equity stakes for lending may be overstated in the\nliterature. We find no evidence that regulation preventing banks from owning equity in\nindustrial companies adversely affects lending. More broadly, this finding suggests that\nconflicts between debt and equity holders are of minor importance in our sample. Our\nfindings are also relevant for institutional investors that participate in lending syndicates\nbecause these \"shadow banks\" often hold both debt and equity of the same company\nReferences\nAllen, Franklin, and Douglas Gale, 1995, A welfare comparison of intermediaries and\nAnt\u0103o, Paula, Miguel A.

It includes on-balance sheet lending such as loans and\nbonds as well as off-balance sheet exposures through guarantees, derivatives and undrawn credit\nlines. Loan Size is set to missing if either the firm or the bank are not in the database for other\nloans in that quarter.\nLoan Size (log) Log ( )\nWhere log is the natural logarithm and the size of the loan is measured in EUR.\nLoan Size (EUR million) Loan size in EUR million. This variable is winsorized at the 1% and 99% threshold.\nBank Share  \n      \nAll loan data for this variable comes from the German Large Credit Register. In the sum of all\nloans we include also loans of banks that are not in our sample. Bank Share is set to missing if\neither the firm or the bank are not in the database for other loans in that quarter.\nBorrower Percentile We sort all borrowers of a bank by the average size of their loans in the quarter and assign\npercentiles with the largest borrower receiving 100% and the smallest borrower 0%. We include\nonly borrowers from the respective sample. If a firm does not borrow from this bank, but both the\nbank and the firm are in the database, we assign a zero.\nEquity Link is Divested Dummy variable equal to 1 in the years after an equity stake was divested. More specifically:\nIf Equity Link 1999 is equal to 1 and we know the divestiture time, this variable is 0 before the\ndivestiture and 1 starting in the year when it was divested.\nIf Equity Link 1999 is equal to 0, this variable is equal to 0.\nIf Equity Link 1999 is equal to 1 and the divestiture time is missing, this variable is missing.\nPanel B: Bank-firm-level variables\nVariable Name Definition\nLending Relationship Dummy variable equal to one if the company receives a loan from the bank in December 1999. Set\nto missing if either the firm or the bank is not covered in the German Large Credit Register in\nEquity Link 1999 Dummy variable equal to one if the bank holds an industrial firm's equity of less than 50%, which\nis held either directly or through a chain of subsidiaries at the 75% threshold. Unless stated\notherwise, we take these holdings as of December 1999. We use data from the \"Who owns\nWhom?\" database and manually add holdings of banks reported in Hoppenstedt Aktienf\u00fchrer 2001\n(these holdings are as of December 1999). We exclude holdings in other banks, private equity\ncompanies and vehicles of project finance.\nDivested Equity Link This variable is the same as Equity Link 1999, but is set to missing if the equity stake was not\ndivested by 2005 or the divestiture information is missing.\nSame City Dummy variable equal to one if the bank is located in the same city as the firm (based on the\naddress in \"Who owns Whom?\").\nSame Region Dummy variable equal to one if the bank is located in the same region as the firm. Regions are\nbased on the first two digits of the German postal code (based on the address in \"Who owns\nWhom?\").\nBoard Link 1999 Board Link 1999 is a dummy variable equal to one if a representative of the bank sits on the firm's\nsupervisory board. As bank representative we count: any employee of the bank (in almost all cases\nthey are members of the bank's management board), any former management board member of the\nbank that does not have a new job and the chairman of the supervisory board of the bank if he does\nnot have a full-time job at another company. This variable is missing if we do not have information\non the firm's supervisory board composition.\nEquity Link with Board Link\nall other bank-firm pairs.\nEquity Link without Board\n1. It is zero for all other bank-firm pairs.\nPublic Equity Link 1999 Dummy variable equal to 1 if Equity Link 1999 is equal to 1 and the firm is publicly listed. It is\nzero for all other bank-firm pairs.\nPrivate Equity Link 1999 Dummy variable equal to 1 if Equity Link 1999 is equal to 1 and the firm is not publicly listed. It is\nzero for all other bank-firm pairs.\nDifference in Loan Size (log) \n(log( ))  \n(log( ))\nDifference in Loan Size\n(EUR million)\n\n( )  \n( ). Then this variable is winsorized at the\nDifference in Bank Share \n( )  \n( )\nDifference in Borrower\nPercentile\n\n( )  \n( )\nPanel C: Firm-level variables and firm-quarter level variables\nVariable Name Definition\nFirm Size (log) Log (total firm assets in 1999)\nLog is the natural logarithm and firm assets are taken from Worldscope for publicly listed\ncompanies and from JALYS/USTAN for privately listed companies.\nFirm Leverage The firm's book value of debt divided by the firm's total assets in (both in 1999).\nFirm Tangibility of Assets The firm's cash and equivalents plus net PPE divided by the firm's total assets (both in 1999).\nRepurchase Dummy Dummy variable equal to one if there was an increase in the number of treasury shares in a year\nand equal to zero if the change was zero (and neither value was missing). We base this variable\nfirst on number of treasury shares from USTAN/Jalys. If it cannot be determined (because either\nvalue is missing), we use data from Compustat Global instead.\nPanel D: Other variables and definitions\nVariable Name Definition\nValue of Equity Stake We determine the value of an equity stake by multiplying the firm's market capitalization with the\nshare that the bank holds. If the firm is privately listed, we estimate the market capitalization using\na multiple of its book equity, where this multiple is the median of the book to equity ratio of\npublicly listed companies.\nAppendix 2: The German banking system\nThe German banking system consists mostly of universal banks offering a broad range of\nfinancial services, including deposits, loans, payment services, and securities transactions.\nThey can be classified into commercial sector banks, public sector banks and cooperative\nsector banks (Hackethal (2004)).16 Specialized banks (such as mortgage banks, building\nsocieties, securities brokers etc) only account for a market share of around 20% in terms of\ntotal business volume and are not covered in our data.\nCommercial sector banks are organized on the basis of private-sector principles with a clear\nfor-profit orientation. This sector includes large universal banks, which are usually listed on\nthe German stock exchange, regional banks and smaller \"private bankers\". Compared to\nothers, commercial sector banks have a stronger market position in the securities trading and\nunderwriting business, and they generally provide all domestic and international banking\nservices.\nPublic sector banks include Landesbanken and savings banks (\"Sparkassen\"), which are\nentities under public law with ultimately public ownership. Savings banks are smaller\ninstitutions with a regionally specified mandate and a less sophisticated business model. On\nthe other hand, Landesbanken are larger and usually operate in one or more of Germany's 16\nstates and offer more complex financial products. Furthermore, it is important to note that\nmany savings banks are not allowed to take equity stakes in industrial firms due to their\nrespective articles of association.\nFinally, the cooperative sector consists of small credit cooperatives with a regional\norientation as well as their central institutions. Compared to commercial sector banks,\ninstitutions in the public or cooperative sector rely more strongly on retail than on wholesale\nfunding and on retail and small business lending rather than on lending to large businesses.\nWhile the commercial banking sector has the largest market share (around 40% of total\nbusiness volume according to statistics of the German Central Bank), it is relatively\nconcentrated. In contrast, more than three-quarters of German banks are in the public sector\n(with a market share of 35%) or cooperative sector (with a market share of 12%).\n16 Please note that \"public\" refers to \"state- owned\" and not to \"publicly listed\".\nAppendix 3: German corporate governance\nGermany has a two-tier board system. The management board (Vorstand) is responsible for\noperative decisions and the supervisory board (Aufsichtsrat) is responsible for representing\nthe interests of shareholders and employees. All stock companies (Aktiengesellschaften) must\nhave a supervisory board, even if they are not publicly listed. A limited company\n(Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung (GmbH)) must have a supervisory board if it has\nmore than 500 employees and can always have a supervisory board voluntarily. The\nsupervisory board consists of shareholder representatives and representatives of employees. If\nthe company has above 2,000 employees, there are an equal number of shareholder and\nemployee representatives. If there are between 500 and 2000 employees, employee\nrepresentatives make up one-third of the supervisory board. Below 500 employees, there are\nno employee representatives. In either case, the chairman of supervisory board\n(Aufsichtsratsvorsitzender) decides in the case of a tied vote. Thus theoretically, shareholder\nrepresentatives can always overrule employee representatives if they vote in unison."
