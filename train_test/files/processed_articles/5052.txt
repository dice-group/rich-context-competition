With currently popular\nphotographic techniques, the spectator is forced to, because the viewing sphere is presented as a\npictorial object. Then the question is whether human observers are able to use such pictorial\nrepresentations in an intuitive manner. Can the spectator `mentally step into the interior' of the\npictorial viewing sphere? We explore this issue in a short experiment. Perhaps unsurprisingly,\nbecause the eye cannot see itself, the short answer is no.\n",

This yields\nthe `viewing sphere' S2. The viewing sphere is a formal, ideal object (Van Brummelen, 2013)\nthat has no special significance in physical optics. One often uses it as a parameter space,\nspecifying points of S2 as labels for visual directions.\nThe sphere is conventionally parameterized by means of a pair of angular coordinates\n#, '\n. Here, # is the `elevation', or height above the horizon. It takes values in the range\nf g, with # \u00bc \u00fe90 specifying the zenith, # \u00bc \u00c090 specifying the nadir. The angle\n' denotes the `azimuth', that is, the angle reckoned from the forward direction along some\nsmall circle centred on the zenith or nadir to the current view direction. Thus one defines\n' \u00bc # \u00bc 0 for the principal direction of view and ' \u00bc 180, # \u00bc 0 the direction towards the\nrear, the antipode of the principal fixation point, called `occipital pole' by Helmholtz.\nThe viewing sphere is quite large, its spherical area measures about 210,000 times the area\nof the full moon. It contains about 200 million visual rays in the sense of Euclid.\nmany years, but never wholeheartedly accepted its status as merely formal, ideal object.\nAt first, he spoke of a `one-inch sphere', apparently identifying the viewing sphere with the\neye ball. (Later, Gibson switched to the more abstract notion of `nested solid angles'.\nHowever, this relates to the point-topology of the optic array and has no relation to the\npresent issues.)\nRecently a variety of cameras that allow one to capture the full optic array in a single\nexposure has become available to the general public. These are optical machines that deliver a\npictorial representation of the viewing sphere. Such photographs have an obvious appeal,\npeople look at planispheric and rolling globe pictures on their smartphones. So-called small\nearth circular images are frequently seen in the popular media, so are cylindrical projections\nthat may be scrolled by the user (Koenderink & van Doorn, 2017). The popularity of such\nrenderings is partly due to the fact that they are unusual and thus (at least for the time being)\nhave a gimmicky character. The fact that various representations are used perhaps suggests\nthat none is an obvious `winner', there is no way such optical data are intuitively and\nuniquely `represented right'.\nDoes this novel technology extend the power of the eye or is it a mere gimmick? It would be a\npotential `eye opener' if people could read the pictures intuitively, without falling into major\nmisperceptions. It is not a priori evident that this would be unproblematic. For instance,\nobservers estimate the extent of their visual fields (Koenderink, van Doorn, & Todd, 2009)\nas being much smaller than it is (common), or much larger than it is (less common, but not\ninfrequent). For most observers, the space behind their backs does not exist (Attneave &\nFarrar, 1977; Phillips & Voshell, 2009). One takes an optic hemisphere for all there\n(optically) is. Thus, there is some reason to expect problems due to topological factors.\nConventional pictures almost without exception depict (much) less than the halfspace in\nfront of the observer. Photographs and drawings depicting more than about 90 usually lead\nto complains that they are `distorted' (despite the perfect perspective) and are usually avoided\nby professional photographers, whereas artists intentionally use formally incorrect\nperspective in order to make their depictions `look right'. Attempts to show more than a\nhemisphere of the optic array are rare, exceptions being panoramas, where the viewer is inside\nthe physical picture. In modern Western art, Picasso did experiments in the 1950s and Flocon\nshowed a planar representation of a full optic array (final figure of the book; Flocon & Barre,\n1968). Such experiments were only appreciated by a very minor audience though.\nIn a recent experiment (Koenderink & van Doorn, 2017), using the common planispheric\nrendering, we found that essentially all observers commit characteristic topological errors.\nThey do not recognize the fact that the horizon is a topological circle, ignoring both the\nconnectivity and the special status of antipodal directions (Koenderink & van Doorn, 2017;\nKoenderink, van Doorn, & Lappin, 2003). Since all observers also commit huge errors of a\nmetrical nature, this leads to major misperceptions of the depicted scene.\nIn this study, we focus on the so-called rolling ball representation. This is a popular\nrepresentation of the optic array `as seen from the outside', usually presented in rotation.\nIn some implementations, the user may control the rotation on a touch screen of a\nsmartphone say.\nSince one commonly enjoys the optic array from the inside, problems may be anticipated\nwhen it is presented as a picture so as to be seen from the outside. The question is are spectators\nable to mentally step into the inside of the pictorial viewing sphere? (See Figure 1.) That is to say,\nare they able to put their mental eye at the position of the camera? That is not at all trivial\nbecause all pictures are infinitely ambiguous. For instance, in the rolling ball presentation, one\npossible interpretation is an actual rolling ball, painted at its outside surface, like a photograph\ncan be seen as a planar surface covered with pigments. In the latter case, many people would\nhold that you cannot only look at a photograph but also look into a photograph. One meets a\nsimilar problem in the case of the rolling ball interpretation. It is well known that the ability to\nlook into a picture is typically human and apparently learned. Here, we report empirical data\non this issue.\nMethods\nStimuli\nWe used a Ricoh Theta S camera (Ricoh, 2016) to take the photographs. This camera has a\npair of back-to-back fisheye lenses, each covering a field of 190. Because the two cameras are\nFigure 1. This explains the cases of `viewing from the inside' and `viewing from the outside'. At left, the case\nof viewing from the inside, as when you experience the optic array. At right, the case of viewing from the\noutside, as when you look to an earth globe. Although you cannot see your optic array from the outside, you\ncan view a spherical rendering of it from the outside. This happens when viewing a celestial sphere, for\ninstance. We discuss these cases in detail in the discussion section.\nKoenderink et al. 3\nrigidly connected, stitching is unproblematic, it is handled in-camera. The camera can be\nremote controlled by way of an iPhone app. A single exposure yields a 5,376 \u00c2 2,688\u00adpixels\nimage, covering the full optic array with a resolution of about 40 at the horizon. We use such\nphotographs as texture maps on a computer graphics triangulated sphere.\nPhotographs were taken on an overcast day. This was done to avoid shading and cast\nshadows due to the (unidirectional) sunbeam, as these would introduce a fixed absolute\ndirection.\nWe set up two scenes. In each scene, eight actors were uniformly distributed over a circle\ncentred on the camera. The radius of the circle was 1 m. The scenes are illustrated in Figures 2\nand 3. Both pictures represent the so-called equirectangular maps (Fr.: plate carre\n\u00b4 e, G.:\nquadratische Plattkarte), introduced by Marinos of Tyros (ca. 100CE; Snyder, 1993). The\nvertical dimension is the elevation #, the horizontal dimension is the azimuth '. Thus, the full\nupper edge of the picture is a (very singular) map of the zenith, the full bottom edge of the\npicture is a (very singular) map of the nadir. The left edge and the right edge formally\ncoincide. Both edges contain the occipital pole.\nIn one scene, all observers faced the camera (with body, head and eyes), in the other, they\nhad their backs to the camera. In both cases, the actors joined hands, so they are obviously\nmutually connected. Note that when the actors face each other, they also face the camera,\nwhereas when turning their backs to each other, they look away from the camera.\nIn the final presentation, the photographs were presented as texture on a rotating sphere\non a computer screen (see supplementary material). The precise layout is discussed later in\nthis article, since it is closely related to the design of the experiment. The display was the\nscreen of an Apple MacBook Pro 15\u00adinch (mid-2012), the sphere subtended a diameter of\n8 cm on the screen. Viewing was in an informal setting at comfortable viewing distance (ca.\n50 cm). The display thus measured about 35 of visual angle wide and 23 high. We have no\nreason to believe that these measures are essential.\nFigure 2. This is a planispheric image of the actors looking inwards. In this configuration, the actors \u00ad\narranged in a circle \u00ad face each other. Notice how the outmost person is `split' and appears both at the left\nand the right edge.\nParticipants\nParticipants were as follows:\n.

Total 11:4 males and 7 females.\nIn total, there were 85 participants.\nDistribution over genders was about equal (45% female). The 21 Giessen participants were\naware that we were experimenting with a full optic array camera, the others did not. It made\nno difference to their result though.\nExperiment\nThis experiment is hardly regular psychophysics, but might perhaps be classified\n`experimental phenomenology', since we essentially collect first person reports.\nAlthough one objective was to perform the experiment in an informal setting, typical for\ngeneric use, it is clearly desirable to exert some control. Thus, the design of the task is of\ncrucial importance. The next section is devoted to that.\nFigure 3. This is a planispheric image of the actors looking outwards. In this configuration, the actors \u00ad\narranged in a circle \u00ad turn their backs to each other.\nKoenderink et al. 5\nDesign of the Task\nA session can be divided into various mutually independent stages, visited in sequential order.\nAt each stage, one needs to control the viewing of the participant and perhaps to instruct the\nparticipant on the next stage. Stages that we formally distinguished are:\nRegistration: This is a purely administrative stage in which some identifying data of the\nparticipant are collected. It is not further discussed;\nInstruction: This is a very important stage in which the participant is made aware of what to\nexpect and what to look for;\nPresentation: This is the actual stimulus presentation. Here, it is needed to force the\nparticipant to look in the intended manner;\nResponding: At this stage, the participant is asked for a response. It is a critical stage in that\nit is hard not to impose constraints that might influence the result;\nQuestioning: At this stage, the actual session is over. However, one might ask the participant\nvarious questions (in this experiment we use only one). The generic techniques of\nquestionnaires apply.\nWe proceed to describe the essential choices that were made in these cases. It is evident\nthat such choices might make a difference. We will hardly attempt to generalize beyond them.\nRegistration. Because the task involves a non-trivial spatial judgement, we reckoned it perhaps\nrelevant to consider gender a possible parameter, at least requiring a check. Names were\nregistered because they might allow reference to the previous experiment (Koenderink & van\nDoorn, 2017) in case some singular result occurred. However, the groups of participants only\npartly coincided. Possible overlap is limited to the Giessen group anyway.\nIn retrospect, neither age nor gender made a difference. In order to show these up, a much\nlarger sample from the generic population would have to be taken into account.\nInstruction. The instruction was implemented as a full screen page (Figure 4). It contained\nsome text and two images, placed so as to be read as three separate messages.\nThe top line reads [the presentation shows some rotating spheres \u00ad attend to the one at\ncenter] and right below [it shows a group like these:].\nRight below these lines, we placed two images, one marked [``inwards''], the other\n[``outwards'']. These images showed three-dimensional configurations of figures placed in a\ncircle, either facing inwards or outwards. In either case, the viewpoint was conventional, that\nis, from outside the group, a slightly raised position. These images (and their identifying\nwords) were placed in random left/right order. It was expected that the images would render\nthe terms `inside' and `outside' clear. Reviewers of the manuscript judged that this made the\noutcome of the study entirely trivial. We obviously disagree and leave it to the reader to\ndecide. We could have changed the response mode (see below) to a drawing of a ground-plan\nof the physical configuration, including the camera. We decided against this because (as we\nknow from experience) this takes much effort, many participants complaining that they\n`cannot draw'. The present choice appeared natural enough to all participants, we do not\nfeel that there was any confusion or that we intentionally biased the participants to some\nparticular choice.\nBelow the images was the instruction [you need to judge whether the group you see is\n``outwards'' or ``inwards'']. Below that (in less emphasized type due to colour) was [SPACE\nBAR to start - presentation time is 3 s].\nThe rationale was as follows. We wanted to prepare the participants to the fact that they\nwould be presented with spherical pictorial objects and that there were several of these and\nthat they should focus on the central one \u00ad without showing them an example. We also wanted\nto prepare them to the fact that they would have a fairly short presentation, 3 seconds is only\na `good look' worth. The remark about the space bar alerted them to the fact that they could\nself-initiate the presentation. This is very important indeed, because a good look is short, but\nlong enough when anticipated.\nThe images defined the task: Are the figures in the group I'm going to see facing inwards or\noutwards? The randomization of position was a precaution against systematic errors. The\nrandom choice was written to the response file for later checks, although it was not\nanticipated to be relevant.\nPresentation. This is the actual stimulus presentation (Figure 5). The full screen had the\nstimulus at centre, with a group of six auxiliary objects around it. The stimulus was the\n`rolling ball' presentation of the picture of a scene, the auxiliary objects were small\npresentations of a rotating earth globe. The globes were half the size of the rolling ball\npicture. All spheres (seven in all) rotated simultaneously about the vertical at the same\nspeed and in the same sense. In the 3 seconds of presentation, the spheres completed\nabout a third of a full turn. The phases of all spheres were random in any presentation.\nAll spheres were shown as lightly shaded, as if illuminated from a direction to the high left\nwith respect to the observer.\nThe rationale was as follows. First of all, since we were interested in momentary visual\nawareness, not perception in the course of reflective thought, we limited the presentation to a\nfew seconds. Three seconds is amply sufficient for a good look, at least if the presentation is\nself-initiated, but it is too short for scrutiny.\nFigure 4. The instruction screen. At left a group looking outwards, at right a group looking inwards.\nKoenderink et al. 7\nSecond, when viewing a rolling ball presentation, experienced observers can \u00ad given time \u00ad\ninvert the sphere and look into a concave hemispherical cup instead of a convex full sphere.\nThis would defeat our purpose, so this viewing mode needs to be counteracted. We used a\nnumber of devices to do that. The shading certainly helps to make the spheres appear solid\nand convex. The earth globes are not easily inverted and a group of spheres tends to appear\nall convex or all concave. Thus, the globes (otherwise irrelevant to the experiment) help to see\nthe stimulus as convex. Since earth globes are such familiar objects, they are not expected to\ndistract attention. Finally, the short presentation time is insufficient to do the convex\u00ad\nconcave flip, this tends to take conscious effort (and thus time) even for experienced\nobservers.\nThe shading and the otherwise irrelevant earth globes also serve to evoke the awareness of\nsphericity in participants with only weak pictorial stereopsis. Of course, we cannot be certain\nthat all participants actually experienced solid spheres. Some may have been aware of flat\ndiscs filled with texture in non-uniform motion. Maybe that is how they experience pictures\nof the globe. We are not aware of any (objective) method to avoid this possibility.\nWe obviously experimented with a variety of presentations before deciding on the present\none. In retrospect, we are quite happy with it. There were no signs that observers met with\nFigure 5. This is a screen shot in the presentation mode.\nambiguities, they experienced the visual awareness of a `rolling ball', painted on its outside\nsurface. The question that interests us is whether they are able to `look inside it'.\nBecause we wanted to minimize the influence of reflective thought, each participant was\npresented with only one stimulus. Half of the observers were presented with pictures of the\ninward looking, the others with pictures of the outward looking scene. Although this is very\ninefficient in terms of observer's usage, it avoids various possible artefacts.\nIn retrospect, this was probably unnecessary. When we explained the physical\nconfiguration, the photographic process, the display of the picture to people, it did not\nchange the observer's visual awareness. This equally applies to the authors themselves.\nResponding. The responding phase is a critical one because it is only too easy to introduce\nsome systematic error. We used a full screen presentation for the response phase (Figure 6).\nIt contained some text and the same two images as used in the instruction phase, again\nlabelled as [inwards] and [outwards]. As the screen came up, these images are in random\nleft/right order (independent of the other used in the instruction phase) and neither of them\nhighlighted.\nThe screen had a top line [use the LEFT and RIGHT ARROW KEYS to select a response]\nand a bottom line [when you are happy hit the RETURN key to proceed]. Hitting the left or\nright arrow keys highlighted the corresponding left or right image. The participant was free to\ntoggle arbitrary times, the response was concluded with a hit of the return (or enter) key.\nThe rationale was as follows. As the screen comes up, the participant becomes aware of the\nchoices but is in no way led to some particular one. As the presentation is still mentally\npresent, the response can be given on the basis of pictures alone. No doubt some participants\ntranslated everything in verbal terms, but this was by no means necessary. We tried to\npromote promptness to avoid the latter but to limit the response time appeared\ncounterproductive. In practice, all participants reacted promptly, as we hoped they would.\nFigure 6. A screen shot in responding mode. The right picture has been highlighted.\nKoenderink et al. 9\nIf some observers would have taken a much longer than median response period, we would\nhave excluded them from the analysis, but this proves not necessary.\nThe random left/right order of the images was again recorded on the response file, for later\nchecks, although it was not anticipated to be relevant.\nQuestioning. In the questioning phase, we devoted the full screen to only a single question\n(Figure 7). It was formulated on top of the screen: [in retrospect, I saw the spherical picture as\nseen:] and (in smaller type) [(use UP/DOWN ARROW keys to select)].\nBelow this text, the screen had three circular discs with text labels (from high to low) [from\ninside the sphere], [from outside the sphere] and [in no particular way]. None of these was\nselected as the screen came up. Using the up/down arrow keys allowed scrolling through the\ncategories. There was no time limit, but we promoted promptness. In practice, responses were\nindeed quick in all cases.\nAt the bottom of the screen was the text [when you are happy hit the RETURN key to\nconclude]. Hitting the return (or enter) key exited the program, after writing all relevant data\nto the response file.\nThe rationale was as follows. We did not want to inject any suggestion, so there was no\ninitial highlighting. Most participants did not anticipate the question but did not take the\ntime to think it over.\nOf course, the meaning of the responses is necessarily ambiguous. However, it was decided\nthat more detailed questioning would probably not serve to illuminate the nature of\nimmediate visual awareness, but rather reflective thought in retrospect.\nPost-experiment briefing. Although we did not formally plan a post-experiment briefing, indeed\nthis happened in all cases. Participants had more to say than what they could respond in the\nexperiment.\nFigure 7. A screen shot of the questioning mode. `from outside the sphere' has been selected.\nWe were especially interested in whether they had been aware of a solid sphere, a\nconcave hemispherical cup, a flat disc filled with moving texture or perhaps something\nelse altogether. However, we avoided leading questions and merely took note of what was\nfreely offered to us.\nData\nEach session took only a few minutes and contributed a line to the data file containing name,\nepoch, instruction order, scene type, response order, response of the participant and answer\nto the question in CSV format.\nThe most important data are scene type and response. Both scene types and responses are\neither INWARDS or OUTWARDS, although the meaning of these words is obviously different in\nthe two cases (Figure 8). Thus, in the coarsest approximation, the results can be summarized\nby a 2 \u00c2 2\u00c0matrix (one row per scene and one column per response):\nIn view of the observation that this matrix is nearly diagonal, one might be inclined to\nsummarize even further to `73 different, 12 same'.\nIn response to the question we find:\nOf course, there remains much more to check and correlate, but \u00ad in a sense \u00ad this sums up\nthe major observations.\nAnalysis\nSo what does a finding of `73 different, 12 same' imply? We use the conventional Bayesian\nanalysis for the case of the unfair coin tossing problem.1 The prior and the posterior\ndistributions are shown in Figure 9.\nThe maximum a posteriori estimate for the binomial parameter p is 0.86.1 The\ncorresponding Bayes factor is 3.5 bits. On the scale suggested by Jeffreys,2 this is `strong'\nevidence in favour of the binomial distribution with parameter 0.86 as compared with the\nfully non-informative prior. A 5% credible interval for the parameter p is 0:78, 0:93\nf g.\nThe Bayes factor for the comparison p > .5 versus p < .5 is 3.5 bits (again, `strong').\nThe distribution over the inwards and outwards looking presentations does not yield an\nincentive to look for a difference.\nInwards Outwards\nInside Outside Don't know\nKoenderink et al. 11\nNote that 6 of 85 participants answered the question with a [don't know],\nsomewhat unequally distributed over participants with a veridical or a non-veridical\nanswer. Because of the small numbers, there is not much to analyse here. The don't\nknows are expected, because very likely many observers respond without any\nintrospection going on.\nFor those 12 who responded veridically, 7 answered the question with [inside]. Perhaps\nthey experienced a hollow hemisphere, or perhaps they indeed placed their mental eye inside\nthe sphere, there is no way to know.\nFor those who answered the question non-veridically, 63 answered [outside], 4 [inside],\n6 [don't know]. Ignoring the [don't know]'s, we find that the maximum a posteriori estimate\nof the probability of responding (outside) is 0.95, with a Bayes factor of 3.4 bit, `strong' on\nJeffreys' scale.\nFigure 8. `Looking inwards' to become `face to face', `looking outwards' to become `back to back' for the\ncase of the scene. This explains the terms `inner' and `outer' for the scenes that were photographed (the left\ncolumn) and for the responses (the right column). The two rows depict the most common cases\nencountered in the experiment, showing that the responses are `not veridical.'\nConclusions\nThe conclusions are rather clear-cut. Given the Bayes factors, the rational inference is that\nobservers experience a rotating spherical picture as seen from its exterior and that they do not\nmentally place themselves in its interior.\nIf observers had no trouble seeing the scene as it was, the posteriori distribution would\nhave been vastly different. Even a fifty\u00adfifty distribution would have been surprising. Instead,\nwe find that observers systematically tend to have the non-veridical awareness.\nThe reason is also evident: Observers locate their mental eye outside the spherical picture.\nThis is hardly surprising, since the mental eye is typically outside of any pictorial content. If\nthat was not the case, the eye would be able to see itself! But nothing can be simultaneously in\nphysical and in pictorial space, the objects in these spaces are ontologically distinct. For\ninstance, although you can see your eye in a mirror, you still cannot see your eye, you\nonly see a Doppelga\n\u00a8 nger. The mirror world is indeed optically specified, whereas the\ninterior of the rolling ball is not.\nDiscussion\nThe fact that our viewers tended to view the sphere from an exterior perspective may reflect\nour general visual diet in which pictures of all kinds are normally read from `the outside in'.\nPictures are evidently material objects made of paper, ink or pixels, and we will naturally\nperceive them as such. But we also perceive their depictive content, with no apparent\nconceptual confusion. Pictures, therefore, have a remarkable dichotomous nature, being\nperceived as two quite separate things at the same time (Koenderink, van Doorn, Pinna, &\nBut pictorial conventions that have been in force since at least the Medieval period, in the\nEuropean tradition at least, have implicitly located the beholder outside the picture space \u00ad as\nan external observer (Arnheim, 1982). Panoramas and `peepshows' such as the view of Delft\nby Carel Fabritius in the National Gallery, London (1652) are rare cases of artists\nwho deliberately attempted to locate the beholder's experience inside the pictorial space.\nWhile such devices do not negate the pictorial dichotomy (we are rarely fully deceived\nFigure 9. The posterior distribution (in blue) and Jeffreys' prior (in orange). The influence of the choice of\nprior on the posterior distribution is very small.\nKoenderink et al. 13\nby trompe l'oeil effects, even in virtual reality) they can profoundly alter the 'pictorial\ncontract' in favour of the content at the expense of the material.\nThis difference can be illustrated with a 360 photograph made by one of the authors and a\ncolleague Alistair Burleigh (Figure 10). Viewed conventionally, that is, from an external\nperspective, the content is readable but topologically misleading. We are inclined to\nmistakenly interpret the eye on the left as directed towards us, when it is actually directed\nat the plaster bust of Hercules in the centre. If, however, the image is sufficiently enlarged (a\nhigh-resolution digital file is available on the journal website) and viewed with one eye in line\nwith the bust at a sufficiently close range, we are, with some effort, able to experience a strong\nsensation of being inside the pictorial space. It may even be that, given the presence of visual\ncues such as the photographers' legs and nose in the picture periphery, we will experience\nsomething of the subjective viewpoint of the photographer itself. In sum, we are looking as\n`from inside' the picture rather than `at it' (Pepperell, 2017).\nMany representational pictures can be viewed in this way; try looking very close up with\none eye at a painting next time you are in an art museum, it is often a revelation. But the\ninability of our eyes to focus on very close surfaces and the nervousness of museum guards\nare usually discouragements.\nThus, it is perhaps not surprising that the majority of responses are not veridical. Most\nobservers were aware of viewing the rolling ball from the outside as a pictorial `solid' object.\nThere is a priori no cue that such an object might depict a viewing sphere, after all the viewing\nsphere is never `seen' as such in daily vision \u00ad it is not something that can be seen, being\nessentially beyond visible or invisible. In short, the `rolling ball' presentations fail when seen\nat a glance, they are flawed as visual designs.\nFigure 10. A 360 photograph of the artist's studio (equi-rectangular map). When the photograph is viewed\nconventionally, the eye on the left seems to be directed at us, whereas in fact it is directed at the plaster bust of\nHercules in the centre of the image. This illustrates how viewing the picture from an external perspective can be\ntopologically misleading. Viewed from very close quarters, however, the photograph takes on a subjective\naspect in which we may `inhabit' the picture space, as though seeing the studio from the photographer's point of\nview. This example illustrates the difference between looking `at' and looking `as' a picture. (Image by Robert\nPepperell and Alistair Burleigh; a high-resolution version available at the publisher's site.)\nConceptually, one deals with a peculiar type of topo-agnosia. It adds to the topo-agnisias\ndetected in our earlier work on the planospheric depictions (Koenderink & van Doorn, 2017)\nin which observers failed to take the periodic nature of the horizon into account and failed to\nrecognize instances of antipodal positions of pictorial objects. Thus, one has to reckon with\n(at least) three distinct forms of topo-agnosia that affect the intuitive, immediate awareness of\nfull visual field depictions.\nThe particular topo-agnosia detected here is related to a number of phenomena that have\nbeen noticed and discussed for many years, even centuries.\nEarly instances relate to the topology of the surface of the earth and that of the sphere of\nheavens. This is tied up with the idea of `globes' as representations (Stevenson, 1921).\nOur immediate awareness of the surface of the earth is as that of an articulated plane, an\nimpression that is especially strong on the open seas, in Siberian tundras, Utah salt flats and\nso forth. Pythagoras in the 6thc. BCE and Parmenides in the 5thc. BCE stated that the Earth is\nspherical. In the 2ndc. BCE, Crates of Mallus devised a terrestrial sphere. Erathostenes (ca.\nexplicit idea of its spherical shape. This was the time terrestrial globes were available.\nIndeed, you need to have a globe in mind before you can set out to find its radius. From a\npsychological perspective, the availability of globes must have been instrumental in\nconvincing people of the spherical shape, because it allowed them to get off the surface\nand view the earth from a distance. The globe is as effective as a space vehicle, although\ntaken by the Apollo 17 crew) did not fail to create a sensation only decades ago. Were people\nfinally convinced?\nWell, some not, for even today, the insight that one inhabits the surface of a sphere is not\nuniversal, because the intuitive impression of a planar environment is so dominating. There is\nstill belief in the `flat earth' and there is even a widely shared belief in the `hollow earth' (or\nsky-centrism). Reputedly Adolf Hitler and the Germain Kriegsmarine were believers (Kuiper,\n1946; Lang, 1938) and sponsored expeditions to spy on the British navy by pointing infrared\ncameras to the sky near Peenemu\n\u00a8 nde.\nMore interesting is the case of the celestial globe, because the heavens are invariably seen\nfrom the inside (Figure 11), whereas celestial globes are invariably seen from the outside or\ntheir outside surfaces. Thus, there immediately arises a question of orientation or\nhandedness.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, there exist two types of celestial globes and star maps, one a\nmirror image of the other (see Figure 12). This goes back a long time. The famous atlas Kitab\nsuwar al-kawakib (published around 964CE, several copies extant) by Abd al-Rahman ibn\n'Umar al-Sufi (903CE\u00ad986CE) shows the constellations in both configurations (Goldstein &\nHon, 2007). On antique globes, where the personifications of the constellations are depicted,\nthe figures are sometimes seen in dorsal (`seen from the outside') and sometimes in ventral\nview (`seen from the inside'). From the lettering, it appears that some globes were routinely\nviewed in a mirror. Sometimes the celestial sphere is drawn on glass, so inside and outside are\nseen simultaneously. Clearly, users of celestial globes were aware of the topological problem\nand must have tried to transfer their mental viewpoint from outside to inside and perhaps\nvice versa. It remains an unsolved (unsolvable?) problem of visual design.\nThe notion that the correct viewpoint was inside the solid pictorial sphere apparently did\nnot intuitively occur to our observers. This indicated that the popular `rolling ball' paradigm\nis not very well suited to create a useful impression of a wide scene wrapped around the\nspectator's eye. The popularity of this representation is possibly due to the interactive\n`rolling' feature, but this is a mere gimmick that does in no way solve the problem.\nKoenderink et al. 15\nFigure 12. A composite of three maps of the stellar constellation Orion. At left is a modern celestial map, it\nis drawn as seen from the inside. Note that the basic Gestalt of Orion is made up from the four bright stars:\nBetelgeuse, Bellatrix, Rigel, and Saiph in an almost parallelogram, with a striking configuration of three\ncollinear stars (the `girdle', Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka) near the centre. At centre and right, two star maps\nof different orientation. The maps are mirror reversed and the figure of Orion is either seen ventrally or\ndorsally.\nFigure 11. Photograph of the constellation Orion in the night sky, thus evidently a view from the inside.\nBetelgeuse is the bright yellow star at top left, Rigel is the bright blue star at bottom right. Together with the\nblue star Bellatrix at upper right and the white Saiph at lower left they subtend an easily recognized\nquadrangle. The three blue stars `in the belt of Orion' at centre (Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka) make that the\nconstellation can hardly be confused with anything else. The slope of the belt in the quadrangle is a convenient\nsign of the orientation: If it slopes along the Saiph\u00adBellatrix diagonal you are `looking from the inside.'\nA much better impression is obtained \u00ad even in static representations \u00ad through more\nappropriate types of depiction. For instance, the `small earth' maps shown in Figure 13 leave\nno doubt as to the topology of the scene, it is evident at a glance. Similar representations have\nbeen used even before our common era (Figure 14). These are very effective, despite\ncontaining no conventional linear perspectival depth cues. Instead, individual objects are\nrepresented from a `canonical' perspective. In this format, the viewer is neither inside the\nscene nor outside it since there is no single implied viewing position. Despite this, the space\nbeing presented is quite legible.\nFull spherical representations are rare in the visual arts. Partial representations are\ncommon enough, think of panoramas or frescoed domes. These are always seen from the\ninside, so it is easy to represent the optic array. Small paintings for display have to be painted\non globes seen from the outside though. Few painters have made a career out of that, an\nexception is the contemporary artist Dick Termes (1991). He writes\nWhen I am painting, however, it is easier to think of myself inside a transparent sphere, painting\nthe world I see outside . . . I later imagine taking the sphere off my head and seeing from the\noutside what I mentally painted from the inside. Some of the larger spheres that end up in an\noutside environment are actually painted on the inside and viewed from the outside. (p. 290, 291)\nSo the `Termespheres' are like our photographs. This may yield the type of uneasy inversions\nthat troubled the observers in the experiment (again, Termes, 1991):\nAnother of my spheres seems at first to provide a look at a fishbowl, but, later, observers realize\nthat they are inside the bowl, seeing the fish outside as well as the table and room in which the\nFigure 13. A so-called small earth representation is really a Riemann normal coordinates map centred on\nthe nadir. The nadir is at centre of the picture and the radius is proportional to the angular distance from the\n\u00fe #. The angle (clock-face direction) is the azimuth '. The zenith is at 180 from the nadir,\nthus maps on the full circumference of this circular picture, a very singular feature of this map. The map is only\nconformal at the centre, although distortions are not too objectionable over much of the disc.\nKoenderink et al. 17\nIn conclusion, our experiment shows that modern photographic and computer graphics\ntechnology have brought us yet another instance of a perceptual quandary that has\nplagued humanity since the dark ages. The usual brochures or websites used by the public\nto select a holiday destination or hotel will have to depend on a `quilt' of mutually\nindependent perspective renderings (photographs) for the foreseeable future \u00ad although\ninteractive rolling ball and pannable planispheric depictions are already frequently\nencountered.\nWe conclude with a statement requested by a reviewer of this article: This experiment tells\nus absolutely nothing novel about the visual system.\nInstead, it is about the intuitive impressions in viewing pictorial representations of physical\nscenes.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFigure 14.
