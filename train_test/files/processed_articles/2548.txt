Better understanding the affective experiences\nassociated with childhood adversity could ultimately\nallow for the development of more effective interventions\nfor individuals who experienced early adversities, includ-\ning fostering positive affect to promote resilience to and\nrecovery from these stressors. This study aimed to explore\nwhether low positive affect is related to specific childhood\nadversities, including abuse, neglect, caretaker dysfunc-\ntion, and low childhood social support.\nLow positive affect and psychopathology\nLow positive affect is an important component of various\nforms of psychopathology, including social anxiety and\ndepression (Naragon-Gainey, Watson, & Markon, 2009;\nWatson, Gamez, & Simms, 2005), and has been asso-\nciated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and\naffect is conceptually (Watson et al., 1995) and neurolo-\ngically (see Davidson, 2000) distinct from negative affect.\nTherefore, low positive affect presents an additional\nchallenge to individuals' functionality with distinctive psy-\nchological, cognitive, and neurological correlates. Lower\npositive affect is associated with greater PTSD symp-\ntom severity (Feeny, Zoellner, Fitzgibbons, & Foa, 2000)\n\u00e6\nEuropean Journal of Psychotraumatology 2013. # 2013 Darryl W.

Individuals with low\npositive affect also have worse memory for positive\nevents, expect fewer future positive events, and may\nhave self-regulation difficulties that limit their ability to\nachieve goals (Andersen & Limpert, 2001; Aspinwall,\n1998). Neurologically, low positive affect has been asso-\nciated with decreased activation in brain areas involved in\nreward and higher-order cognition (Forbes & Dahl, 2005;\nIn contrast, greater positive affect seems to be an im-\nportant factor in resilience to and recovery from psy-\nchological stressors, including depressive and PTSD\nsymptoms (Ong, Bergeman, Bisconti, & Wallace, 2006;\nYamasaki, Uchida, & Katsuma, 2010). The NIMH\nResearch Domain Criteria (RDoC) project has identified\npositive affect as an important area of functioning, and\ndysfunction of this system is considered to cut across\ndiagnoses (Sanislow et al., 2010). Better characterizing the\nassociation between positive affect and traumatic stres-\nsors, including childhood adversities, could inform our\nunderstanding of the factors involved in the develop-\nment and maintenance of posttraumatic psychopathol-\nogy, as well as prevention of and recovery from these\ndisorders.\nChildhood adversities and posttraumatic\noutcomes\nRather than being considered as a specific outcome, low\npositive affect in adulthood has been primarily tied to\nchildhood adversity through its associations with depres-\nsion and PTSD (Green et al., 2010; Hillberg, Hamilton-\nGiachritsis, & Dixon, 2011). However, low or inappropriate\npositive affect has also been directly associated with\npoorer functioning in childhood sexual abuse survivors\n(Bonanno et al., 2007), and greater severity of childhood\nabuse experiences has been associated with lower positive\naffect among women with PTSD (Frewen, Dozois, &\nLanius, 2012). The nature of the relationship between\npositive affect and specific adversities relative to other life\nexperiences remains unclear, though. Based on studies of\nthe association between childhood adversity and other\nnegative psychological outcomes, low positive affect in\nadulthood may be associated with the severity and type of\nadversity experienced.\nThe severity of childhood adversity is often measured\nby the number of discrete maltreatment experiences or by\nthe number of types of adversity experienced. Experien-\ncing more incidents of maltreatment has been associated\nwith greater levels of PTSD and depression symptoms\n(Vranceanu, Hobfoll, & Johnson, 2007). Similarly, ex-\nperiencing multiple types of maltreatment has consis-\ntently been found to be related to poorer psychological\nfunctioning in adulthood than experiencing only one type\nof maltreatment (Cloitre et al., 2009; Edwards, Holden,\naffect will, therefore, likely be associated with greater\nseverity of childhood adversity.\nIn contrast to the consistent association of severity of\nchildhood adversity with poorer psychological outcomes,\nthere is no clear consensus as to which types of adver-\nsity are most associated with psychopathology (Arata,\nLanghinrichsen-Rohling, Bowers, & O'Farrill-Swails,\nof associations between multiple types of abuse and\npositive affect (Frewen et al., 2012) did not test for\ndifferences between types of abuse, but early case studies\ndemonstrating differential effects of physical and emo-\ntional abuse on infants' affect (Gaensbauer & Hiatt,\n1984) suggest that examining the relationship between\nvarious types of childhood adversity and low positive\naffect may inform our understanding of how such\nexperiences impair functioning.\nPhysical abuse, sexual abuse, and family environ-\nment (e.g., childhood social support, neglect) have all\nbeen associated with adulthood psychopathology (e.g.,\nEdwards et al., 2003), and the strength of those associa-\ntions can inform expectations about the relationships\nbetween adversities and low positive affect. Relative to\nsome other early adversities, sexual abuse has been found\nto be more predictive of poor psychological adjustment\nin adulthood, PTSD symptoms, and negative affect\n(Higgins & McCabe, 2000; Sullivan, Fehon, Andres-\nHyman, Lipschitz, & Grilo, 2006). Lower levels of\nchildhood social support, especially emotional and psy-\nchological support, have been associated with PTSD,\nemotional distress, depression, negative affect, externaliz-\ning symptoms, and lower levels of psychological wellbeing\nThe role of physical neglect is less clear because it so\noften co-occurs with other types of early adversity.\nSome evidence suggests that it may be less predictive of\nPTSD, depressive, and dissociative symptoms than phy-\nsical or sexual abuse (Wechsler-Zimring & Kearney, 2011).\nPositive affect is an important aspect of psychological\nfunctioning and wellbeing that is potentially affected by\nthese same early adversities.\nThe current study\nLow positive affect is closely related to common patholo-\ngical responses to childhood adversity, including PTSD\nand depression, but little is known about how the\ncharacteristics of early adversity experiences might be\nrelated to positive affect in adulthood. Therefore, this\nstudy examined how the number of types of abuse\nexperienced, severity of adversity types (physical abuse\nand sexual abuse), childhood environment (childhood\nsocial support, neglect, and caretaker dysfunction), and\nnumber of non-abuse traumas are related to positive\naffect. First, we hypothesized that lower positive affect\nDarryl W. Etter et al.\n(page number not for citation purpose)\nwould be associated with multiple types of abuse (i.e., both\nphysical and sexual abuse). Second, we hypothesized that\nsexual abuse would be more strongly related to low posi-\ntive affect than physical abuse. Third, we expected that\nlower positive affect would be related to lower levels\nof childhood social support, higher levels of neglect,\nhigher levels of caretaker dysfunction, greater severity of\nabuse, and more non-abuse traumas. Finally, we sought to\nreplicate earlier findings of associations between low\npositive affect and other psychiatric symptoms.\nMethod\nParticipants and procedure\nWe conducted a secondary analysis of data collected from\npsychiatric inpatients participating in a study examining\nthe relationship of childhood family environment, child-\nhood abuse experiences, and adult traumatic stress with\ncurrent posttraumatic symptoms (Carlson et al., 2001).\nA detailed description of the recruitment methods is\ndescribed elsewhere (Carlson et al., 2001). All patients\nwho were admitted to a large, nonprofit psychiatric hos-\npital over a period of 3.5 years were eligible to participate\nin the study and patients were targeted for recruitment\nas soon as approval from the admitting psychiatrist or\npsychologist was obtained. Two hundred seventeen\nadults participated in a structured clinical interview,\nand data for all predictors were available for 173\nparticipants. The majority of participants were female\n(52%), and most participants reported their ethnicity as\nstatus (SES) was determined using Hollingshead's Two-\nFactor Index of Social Position (Hollingshead & Redlich,\n1958), which is based on education level and occupation\nof the participant or the head of household (whichever\nresults in higher SES). In this sample, 8% of participants\nwere categorized as lower class, 29% as lower-middle\nclass, 26% as middle class, 27% as upper-middle class,\nand 10% as upper class.\nPsychiatric diagnoses were obtained from patient\ncharts. The most common diagnoses were mood dis-\norders, followed by substance use disorders (see Table 1).\nOther data were collected through self-report measures\nand private interviews by trained and supervised clinical\npsychology graduate students who were not involved in\nthe participant's treatment.\nMeasures\nPositive affect\nPositive affect was assessed with two interviewer-\nadministered questions. First, participants responded to\nan item describing their perceived capacity for positive\naffect (``In general, over your whole life, how easy or hard\nhas it been for you to feel good or happy?'') on a 6-point\nSecond, participants responded to an item describing\ntheir experience of positive affect (``In general, over your\nwhole life, how often have you felt good or happy?'') on\nSumming the two item scores created an index of positive\naffect capacity and frequency. Positive affect index scores\ncould range from 0 to 10. In this sample, the two items\nGlobal psychopathology symptoms\nThe Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R; Derogatis,\n1983) was used to measure global psychopathology\nsymptoms. The SCL-90-R is a 90-item self-report ques-\ntionnaire that measures nine psychiatric symptoms as\nwell as the overall degree of distress related to a symptom\nmoderately; 30quite a bit; 40extremely). Subscale scores\nare averages of subscale items, and the Global Severity\nIndex represents global psychopathology symptoms by\naveraging subscale scores. The SCL-90-R has been\nwell validated for use in psychiatric samples (Derogatis,\nDepression symptoms\nThe Depression subscale of the SCL-90-R was used to\nassess depression symptoms. Though this scale is in-\ncluded in the SCL-90-R total score, it was included in\nbivariate correlation analyses due to the specific associa-\ntion between positive affect and depression in prior\nDissociative symptoms\nDissociative symptoms were measured with the Dissocia-\ntive Experiences Scale (DES; Bernstein & Putnam, 1986).\nIt is a 28-item self-report measure assessing the percen-\ntage of time individuals experience amnesia, deper-\nsonalization, derealization, absorption, and imaginative\nTable 1.

The SI-PTSD uses a screening item to identify a\ntraumatic event, and the interview is only completed if a\ntraumatic event is reported. For this reason, SI-PTSD\nSI-PTSD has demonstrated good interrater and test\u00c1\nretest reliability, as well as concurrent validity (Davidson\nChildhood social support\nPerceived childhood social support was assessed with a\nmeasure created for the study, the Structured Interview\nfor Social Support as a Child (SI-SSC). The SI-SSC\nassesses five types of support: self-esteem support, infor-\nmational support, instrumental support, motivational\nsupport, and listening support. Participants indicated\nwhen and who provided the support, and the extent they\nfound this person helpful was rated from 0 to 3, where\nmuch. Total scores were then calculated by averaging\nacross all five items, for a possible range of 0\u00c13. The\nSI-SSC has been shown to be reliable and valid (Carlson\nNeglect\nNeglect was assessed with five questions as part of a\nstructured interview, participants were asked whether\nthey experienced being sick with no one to care for\nthem, getting sick because of neglect, going without food\nor water for a day or more, living away from home for\n3 or more months, or living in foster care. Scores\nrepresent how many of these types of experiences an\nindividual reported and could range from 0 to 5.\nCaretaker dysfunction\nAs part of a structured interview about childhood\nexperiences, participants were asked with whom they\nlived as children and who was responsible for their care,\nup to five individuals. For each of these caretakers,\nparticipants indicated whether that person had a mental\nillness, had problems with drinking or alcohol abuse, had\never attempted suicide, or had been violent with others\nin the home. Scores represent how many of these issues\nwere endorsed and could range from 0 to 20.\nChildhood sexual and physical abuse\nChildhood sexual and physical abuse were assessed with\nslightly modified versions of Jacobson's (1989; Jacobson\n& Richardson, 1987) structured interviews for interper-\nsonal violence and nonconsensual sexual experiences\nwhich were based on the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS;\nStraus, 1979). Participants were first asked ``When you\nwere a child, did anyone ever use physical force on you?''\nParticipants could identify up to four assailants, and for\neach individual identified, interviewers asked structured\nquestions about 11 types of physical violence (e.g., ``Did\nthis person ever throw something at you?''), as well as the\nfrequency and duration of the incidents. The interview\nfollowed a similar structure in assessing sexual abuse.\nParticipants endorsing the gate question (``When you\nwere a child, did anyone ever touch you in a sexual way\nor do something sexual or weird that made you feel\nuncomfortable?'') were asked about the frequency and\nduration of 11 types of sexual experiences with up to four\nindividuals. The interview was structured and worded\nto be specific and neutral to increase accuracy of recall.\nThe interview procedure used for this study is described\nin greater detail elsewhere (Carlson et al., 2001).\nResponses from these interviews were classified into\nphysical abuse or sexual abuse, and individuals were\ncategorized as having experienced No Abuse, Physical\nAbuse Only, Sexual Abuse Only, or Both Abuse Types.\nPhysical abuse severity and sexual abuse severity scores\nwere calculated by summing the number of abuse ex-\nperiences within each category, with more severe incidents\n(e.g., being burned or threatened with a weapon, sexual\npenetration) counted as double. Scores on these variables\nrepresent the number of experiences of these types of\nabuse from up to four abusers, such that multiple types\nof abuse on one occasion results in a higher score for\nparticipants. The interview and scoring system used for\nthis study have demonstrated strong reliability and\nvalidity through test\u00c1retest reliability and convergent\nvalidity analyses reported in the original publication\nfrom this project (see Carlson et al., 2001).\nAbuse scores were transformed to reduce distortion\nby statistical outliers resulting from some participants\nendorsing very high levels of abuse. We transformed these\nscores using a 95th percentile Winsorization, in which\nDarryl W. Etter et al.\n(page number not for citation purpose)\noutliers beyond the 95th percentile are replaced with the\nvalue at the 95th percentile. Winsorization retains all data\nand their magnitudes and is more intuitively clear than\nother procedures, such as common log transformations\nAdulthood and childhood non-abuse trauma\nThe numbers of adulthood and childhood non-abuse\ntraumatic events were collected as part of the SI-PTSD\n(Davidson et al., 1989). For this study, to avoid excluding\nthose who had high levels of trauma, but were unable to\nprovide exact numbers, the number of adulthood and\nchildhood non-abuse traumas reported during the inter-\nview were coded into five categories where 000 traumas,\nor more traumas.\nResults\nDescriptive and correlation analyses\nDescriptive data for psychiatric symptoms and psycho-\nsocial factors are presented in Table 2. Positive affect was\nsignificantly negatively correlated with all other symptom\nmeasures (see Table 3). Table 4 shows correlations among\npositive affect, childhood environment (social support,\ncaretaker dysfunction, and neglect), childhood physical\nabuse, childhood sexual abuse, childhood traumas, and\nadult traumas. Positive affect was significantly related to\nlevels of childhood social support, caretaker dysfunction,\nphysical abuse, and sexual abuse, but not to neglect,\nchildhood non-abuse traumas, or adulthood non-abuse\ntraumas.\nEffect of number of types of abuse\nTo test our hypotheses regarding the association between\ntype of abuse experienced and positive affect, an ANOVA\nwas conducted on positive affect scores with abuse type\n(No Abuse, Physical Abuse Only, Sexual Abuse Only, Both\nAbuse Types) as the independent variable. The number of\nparticipants reporting each type of abuse and group means\nis presented in Table 5. This ANOVA found signifi-\nhoc comparisons with Bonferroni corrections showed\nthat those in the Both Abuse Types group had significantly\nlower positive affect than those in the Physical Abuse Only\nand No Abuse groups. No other significant differences\nacross groups were observed.\nEffect of childhood adversity\nTo test the capacity of various types of childhood\nadversity to predict positive affect, a hierarchical regres-\nsion analysis was conducted predicting positive affect with\nchildhood environmental factors (social support, neglect,\nand caretaker dysfunction) entered in Step 1, severity of\nphysical and sexual abuse entered in Step 2, and child-\nhood and adulthood non-abuse traumas entered in Step 3.\nThe results are shown in Table 6.\nDiscussion\nThis study demonstrated that positive affect is signifi-\ncantly negatively related to a number of psychiatric\nsymptoms and that childhood support and abuse experi-\nences are significant predictors of positive affect in adult\npsychiatric inpatients. Individuals who experienced both\nphysical and sexual abuse reported significantly lower\npositive affect than those with only physical or no abuse\nexperiences. Greater severity of sexual abuse and lower\nchildhood social support predicted lower positive affect,\nabove and beyond childhood neglect, caretaker dys-\nfunction, physical abuse severity, and non-abuse trauma\nexperiences.\nWe found positive affect to be negatively correlated\nwith global psychopathology, depressive, dissociative,\nself-destructive behavior, and PTSD symptoms. These\nnegative associations are consistent with the view that\nlow positive affect is a transdiagnostic symptom. Our\nfinding of associations with broad psychopathology may\nbe a result of our assessment of positive affect broadly\nover the lifespan and measurement of a broad construct\nTable 2.

Low positive affect, there-\nfore, can cause distress and functional impairment inde-\npendently or in conjunction with negative affect. Low\npositive affect may also increase vulnerability to psy-\nchological disorders by impairing cognitive processes\ninvolved in resilience to and recovery from nega-\ntive psychological states (Andersen & Limpert, 2001;\nThe finding that individuals who experienced both\ntypes of abuse reported lower positive affect partially\nsupported our hypothesis that multiple types of abuse\nwould be associated with lower positive affect than one\ntype or no abuse. This finding is also consistent with prior\nresearch on other outcomes that indicates that individuals\nwho have experienced multi-type maltreatment may be\nat risk for compromised psychological functioning (e.g.,\nGreen et al., 2010). Interestingly, individuals report-\ning only one abuse type did not differ significantly from\nthose reporting no abuse. However, the number of types\nof abuse experienced is a relatively imprecise index of\nseverity of abuse, and the severity of the abuse in those\nwith only one abuse type may have been lower than in\nthose with more than one type.\nThe regression analyses sought to clarify the relation-\nship between positive affect and the type and severity of\nearly adversity. Severity of sexual abuse predicted sig-\nnificant unique variance in positive affect above and\nbeyond childhood environment characteristics and non-\nabuse trauma experiences, while severity of physical abuse\nwas not significantly predictive of positive affect. This\nprovides support to our hypothesis that sexual abuse\nwould be associated with lower positive affect and is\nconsistent with prior research indicating that sexual abuse\nmay be more pathogenic than physical abuse and with the\nbroader finding that sexual trauma is more pathogenic\nthan other interpersonal violence (Brewin, Andrews, &\nLow positive affect was associated with lower child-\nhood social support, greater neglect, and greater care-\ntaker dysfunction, consistent with our hypothesis and\nwith previous findings indicating that childhood experi-\nences are strong influences on later mental health (e.g.,\nGreen et al., 2010). Childhood social support was an\nespecially robust predictor of positive affect, so interven-\ntions to foster a supportive environment for children may\nhelp to mitigate the deleterious effects of early adversity\non positive affect. Along with family-focused interven-\ntions, at-risk children may benefit from mentoring,\nTable 3. Intercorrelations of positive affect and psychopathology symptoms\nTable 4. Intercorrelations of positive affect and predictor variables\n8. Adulthood non-abuse traumas\nDarryl W. Etter et al.\n(page number not for citation purpose)\nteacher-focused interventions, and nurturing extracurri-\ncular activities that grow social support outside of a\nfamily context.\nGreater severity of abuse experiences, as measured by\nthe number of incidents of abuse, predicted lower posi-\ntive affect. Prior research has repeatedly found greater\nseverity of traumatic experiences generally, and early\nadversity experiences specifically, to be associated with\nworse posttraumatic outcomes (Brewin et al., 2000;\nextend that line of research to a novel outcome*positive\naffect. However, the number of non-abuse traumas was\nnot a significant predictor of positive affect in this study.\nIt is unlikely that the other predictors in the model\nobscured the relationship between the number of traumas\nand positive affect, as the zero-order correlation between\nthe two was comparatively small and not statistically\nsignificant. Instead, these results seem to suggest that\nchildhood abuse experiences have a greater impact on\npositive affect than non-abuse childhood traumas or\nadult traumas. This finding is consistent with theory and\nresearch on the differentially greater impact of early\ninterpersonal trauma (Cicchetti & Toth, 2005).\nPotential mechanisms underlying the relationship ob-\nserved in this study between low childhood social support,\nchildhood sexual abuse, and low positive affect include\ndisruption of attachment processes, emotion regulation\ndifficulties and interactions with negative affect, and\nalteration of psychobiological state. Childhood maltreat-\nment appears to be strongly associated with insecure\nattachments (Cicchetti & Toth, 2005). More insecurely\nattached individuals have been found to minimize posi-\ntive experiences, and an avoidant attachment style\nhas been associated with social anhedonia (Gentzler,\nKerns, & Keener, 2010; Troisi, Alcini, Coviello, Nanni,\n& Siracusano, 2010), which would likely reduce how\nsupportive individuals find social contacts and their like-\nlihood of accessing social support. Furthermore, attach-\nment difficulties have been associated with difficulty\nregulating negative affect (Cloitre, Stovall-McClough,\nZorbas, & Charuvastra, 2008). These emotion regulation\ndifficulties could interact with individuals' ability to\nexperience positive affect. Indeed, when individuals with\nPTSD were presented with typically positive stimuli (e.g.,\nthe image of a sunny day), they experienced significantly\nmore negative affect than healthy controls (Frewen et al.,\n2012). This negative affect interfered with their ability to\nexperience positive affect, contributing to individuals\nwith PTSD experiencing less overall positive affect. In\naddition to these psychological consequences, attachment\nproblems may have biological impacts. Psychobiological\nmodels have indicated that oxytocin, which is released\nduring pleasurable social contact, resulting in feelings of\nreward, pleasure, and safety, plays a crucial role in positive\naffect and the endocrine response to stressors (Olff, 2012).\nEarly negative emotional experiences and coping through\nover-modulation of affect are thought to produce lasting\nneurological alterations (Perry, Pollard, Blakely, Baker, &\nVigilante, 1995), so childhood experiences of low social\nsupport may result in decreased oxytocin levels and\nconcomitant reduced positive affect.\nLimitations\nLimitations of the study include the potential for error in\nindividuals' recollection of childhood experiences and\nreports of low positive affect. In an experience sampling\nstudy of depressed patients, reports of anhedonia were\nfound to be negatively biased (Ben-Zeev & Young, 2010).\nAdditionally, current positive affect was not assessed so\nthat it could be differentiated from lifelong experience of\npositive affect, and the reliability and validity of the\npositive affect items have not been established. This study\nwas conducted with psychiatric inpatients, potentially\nTable 6.

Future research\nwould benefit from developing more extensive measures\nof lifetime positive affect and determining the relation-\nship between measures of state positive affect (e.g.,\nPANAS; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) and lifetime\npositive affect as measured here.\nConclusion\nThis study investigated the relationship between child-\nhood adversity and positive affect in an adult psychiatric\ninpatient sample. Individuals who experienced both\nphysical and sexual abuse as children reported lower\nlifetime experience of positive affect and lower lifetime\ncapacity to experience positive affect than those with no\nabuse experience and those who experienced only one\ntype of abuse. Sexual abuse severity was a particularly\nstrong predictor of positive affect. Given the role of\npositive affect in psychological resilience, these results\nsuggest that victims of multiple types of early adversity,\nespecially those with sexual abuse experiences, may be at\nrisk for psychological difficulties. Given the strong\nrelationship between childhood social support and posi-\ntive affect, interventions to foster social support may be\nuseful in treating these at-risk populations.\nConflict of interest and funding\nThere is no conflict of interest in the present study for any\nof the authors.\nReferences\nAndersen, S.
