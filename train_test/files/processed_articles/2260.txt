In addition, in\nTCHS I1 it was possible to obtain roentgenograms\nof the hands and wrists (anteroposterior view)\nand of the cervical spine (lateral view in flexion),\nof the majority of participants 20 years of age or\nover.\nThe tube dilution latex fixation test was consid-\nered positive if flocculation occurred in a dilution\nof 1:20 or greater. The slide modification was\nconsidered positive if the result was \"reactive\" as\ndefined by the manufacturer; weakly reactive\nresults were not considered significant. In the\ncase of the human erythrocyte agglutination test,\nagglutination in a dilution of 1:16 or greater was\nregarded as positive.\nThe radiographs of the hands and wrists and\ncervical spine were interpreted by the authors\nusing the Atlas of Standard Radiographs of Ar-\nthritis as a reference guide.5\nInso far as possible the American Rheumatism\nAssociation (ARA) diagnostic criteria for rheuma-\ntoid arthritis6 were used as the basis of diagnostic\nclassificationin TCHS I. Only 7 of the 11 criteria\ncould be applied since radiologic examination of\nthe joints was not made, nor was it feasible to\nexamine synovial fluid or the histologic features of\nthe synovialis or subcutaneous nodules.

Questionable: These individuals had only\njoint pain or tenderness or morning stiffness, or a\nhistory of joint swelling; thus they failed to meet\nthe criteria for any of the defined diagnostic cate-\ngories.\n. Possible: The ARA criteria were employed,\nexcept that sedimentation rates and C-reactive\nprotein tests were not performed.\n3. Probable: These subjects fulfilled three or\nfour of the ARA diagnostic criteria.\n4.Likely: These subjects fulfilled five or more\nof the A.R.A.diagnostic criteria; this group there-\nfore also includes those few individuals with\n\"classical\" rheumatoid arthritis.\nThe comparability of the diagnostic classifica-\ntions in TCHS I1 was complicated by the addition\nof radiologic examinations, so that information was\nobtained regarding 8 of the 1\n1 criteria. The clas-\nsification scheme was somewhat modified and sim-\nplified from TCHS I, as follows:\n1. Possible cases: One or two of the ARA\nticipated only in TCHS I with those who\nparticipated both in TCHS I and I1 indi-\ncated that the two groups did not differ to a\nstatistically significant degree with respect\nto most of the characteristics in which they\ncould be compared. They were alike as to\ndistribution by age, sex, type of arthritis,\ndegree of certainty of diagnosis of rheuma-\ntoid arthritis, distribution of latex fixation\ntest titers, and distribution within the sam-\nples and strata of the total population.\nThus, for all practical purposes, the loss of\n28.6 per cent of individuals of interest over\nan average period of 4 years did not change\nin any major way the group characteristics\nof those who could be followed through a\nsecond examination.\nThe diagnostic status of these 402respon-\ndents is indicated in Table 1.

In part, the difficulty\narises fmm the fact that rheumatoid ar-\nthritis pursues a fluctuating course with at\nleast partial remissions and exacerbations.\nIn some cases transient episodes of disease\nmay occur which do not leave permanent\nevidences of deformity and which may be\neasily forgotten by the patient in a 4 year\nperiod. While most population studies sug-\ngest a much broader spectrum of severity\nof rheumatoid arthritis than do hospital- or\nclinic-based studies, there is still uncer-\ntainty about the minimal requirements for\na diagnosis. It seems probable that a num-\nber of nonrheumatoid musculoskeletal con-\nditions, such as posttraumatic joint disease\nand postviral arthritis, confuse the results\nof population studies by fulfilling the diag-\nnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis to\nvarying degrees. It may be impossible to\nseparate these nonrheumatoid conditions\nfrom rheumatoid arthritis in a single ex-\namination or to differentiate them from re-\nmittent and/or intermittent rheumatoid ar-\nthritis on repeated examination. It seems\nunlikely that this dilemma will be resolved\nuntil an etiologic definition of rheumatoid\narthritis is at hand.\nThe nonspecificity of rheumatoid factor\ntests is well recognized, as is the fact that\nthey may be present transiently during or\nfollowing various infectious diseases, in-\ncluding subacute bacterial endocarditis,\nsyphilis, yaws, leprosy, tuberculosis, infec-\ntious hepatitis, kala azar, and schistosomia-\nsis.' The situation has been compared to\nthat previously observed with the serologic\ntests for syphilis, where acute or chronic\nfalse positive results may occur. Consider-\nable interest has centered on the possibil-\nity that positive tests for rheumatoid factor\nmay select individuals with an increased\nrisk of subsequent development of clinical\nrheumatoid arthritis. The very limited data\navailable at present regarding this possibil-\nity are conflicting and do not provide a\nclear answer. Ball and Lawrence,s on re-\nexamining after 5 years 19 seropositive sub-\njects who originally had no accompanying\nclinical or radiological evidence of rheuma-\ntoid arthritis, found that 7 had developed\nevidence of the disease, as compared to\nonly 5 of 57 seronegative subjects similarly\nfollowed. In a similar study, Finnish inves-\ntigator$' found that after an interval of 9\nyears none of a small group of 7 subjects\nwith apparently false-positive sheep cell\nagglutination tests on original examination\nhad developed rheumatoid arthritis and\nthat 4 had become seronegative. More re-\ncently, 3 apparently normal individuals\nwith high titers of rheumatoid factor were\nreported not to have developed rheuma-\ntoid arthritis after an interval of 6 to 9\nyears, although the first had experienced\narthralgias and a nonspecific conjunctivitis,\nthe second intermittent eye symptoms, and\nthe third an episode of polyarthralgia fol-\nlowed later by a \"tennis elbow.\"1\u00b0 In a brief\ncommunication,\" this third patient is sub-\nsequently reported to have developed clin-\nical and laboratory evidence of probable\nsystemic lupus erythematosus. In the Te-\ncumseh community, it was found that only\nabout 24 per cent of otherwise healthy sero-\npositive respondents remained seropositive\nby the same technic after an average inter-\nval of 4 years. Of this group of originally\nseropositive subjects, none was found to\nhave developed definite or classic rheu-\nmatoid arthritis in this average 4 year\nfollow-up period, and only 1.9 per cent\nwere found to have evidence for probable\nand 7.6 per cent evidence for possible dis-\nease.\nSimilarly, there seemed to be little evi-\ndence that the varying diagnostic catego-\nries of rheumatoid arthritis constituted a\ngradient along which respondents pro-\ngressed toward a more certain diagnosis,\nalthough the correlation coefficient ( r ) of\ndents originally in the possible and proba-\nble categories, the great majority moved\ndownward in the diagnostic scale and\nabout half were found to have no evidence\nof rheumatoid arthritis. Even in the group\noriginally classified as having definite rheu-\nmatoid arthritis this trend was apparent,\nwith 21 per cent showing no evidence of\ndisease on reexamination. Again, these\nfindings are compatible either with the\nview that rheumatoid arthritis, as it occurs\nin the general population, pursues a much\nmore variable course than observed in hos-\npita1 or clinic settings, or with the view\nthat the picture is obscured by a number\nof nonrheumatoid arthropathies which are\nmore frequently transient or self-limited.\nIt seems likely that both factors contribute\nto the observed results.\nSUMMARIO\nININTERLINGUA\nInter 563 individuos con suspicion de arthritis rheumatoide quando illes esseva ex-\na base de simile criterios, solo 107 (26,6 pro cento) manteneva lor previe classification\ncon respecto a1 certitude del presentia de arthritis rheumatoide, durante que 200 (49,8\npro cento) monstrava nulle evidentia del morbo.
