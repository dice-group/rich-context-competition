    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjectives: This study examined dietary intakes and nutritional status of marijuana\nusers and non-current marijuana users in US adults aged 20 to 59 years.\nMethods: We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES III), 1988\u00b11994. Information on self-reported drug use, including\nmarijuana, was obtained as part of the NHANES III physical examination component.\nNutritional status was assessed using height and weight, and blood biochemistries.\nDietary intake was assessed using a 24-hour recall and a food-frequency\nquestionnaire.\nResults: Among adults 20\u00b159 years of age, 45% reported ever having used marijuana\nin their lifetime. A total of 8.7% reported using marijuana in the past month. Current\nmarijuana users had higher intakes of energy and nutrients than non-current\nmarijuana users; however, body mass index (BMI) was slightly lower. We found\nhigher cigarette-smoking rates and higher consumption of sodas and alcohol,\nspecifically beer, among marijuana users than among non-current marijuana users.\nMarijuana users also consumed more sodium, fewer fruits, and more pork, cheese,\nand salty snacks. Nutritional status, using indicators of serum nutrients, serum\nalbumin, haematocrit and haemoglobin, was similar between marijuana users and\nnon-current marijuana users. Serum carotenoid levels were lower among marijuana\nusers, independent of cigarette smoking.\nConclusion: Dietary intake was different among marijuana users than among non-\ncurrent marijuana users. Although overall nutritional status was similar, serum\ncarotenoid levels were lower in marijuana users. The long-term health effects of\nthese differences in marijuana users deserve careful consideration in future research.\n",

Approximately one-third of the US population aged\n12 years or older, or 72 million persons, have reported\nsmoking marijuana at some point in their life1. Trends in\nmarijuana use have not changed dramatically since 19911.\nThe National College Health Risk Behavior Survey found\nthat 59.6% of students aged 25 years and older reported\never having used marijuana, with 8.3% reporting being\ncurrent users of marijuana2.\nIn response to public pressure to allow for the medical\nuse of marijuana, the Office of National Drug Control\nPolicy of the United States evaluated the scientific\nevidence for the benefits and risks of using marijuana as\na medicine3. We know little about the long-term effects of\nmarijuana use on the human body and other concomitant\nhealth behaviours associated with marijuana consumption.\nThe report called for an increase in research to evaluate\nthe health consequences of marijuana use and other\nbehaviours associated with consumption of marijuana. It\nis important that we learn more about the changes in\ndietary habits that accompany marijuana use and their\nbeneficial or detrimental effect in the development of\nchronic diseases later in life.\nUse of psychoactive drugs, including marijuana, has\nbeen reported to affect food and beverage consumption,\nand body weight4\u00b18. Mendelson studied chronic mari-\njuana users in a laboratory setting and found that the\nparticipants increased caloric intake and gained weight\nduring periods of active marijuana use5.

Limited information is available\nabout the intake of marijuana users in the free-living\npopulation. We examined dietary intake and related\nfactors in the non-institutionalised US adult population\namong those reporting using marijuana and those not\ncurrently using marijuana.\nMethods\nStudy population\nThe study population consists of participants of the Third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988\u00b1\n1994 (NHANES III). The study design is described in detail\nin the Plan and Operation of the Third National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey9. NHANES III uses a\nhighly stratified multistage probability design and\nemploys over-sampling of the elderly, non-Hispanic\nblacks and Mexican\u00b1Americans.\nWe limit this analysis to adults defined as aged 20 and\nabove. Additionally, only participants up to age 60 years\nwere asked about marijuana use. Our analytic sample\nthus consists of those participants aged 20\u00b159 years. A\nand asked to complete an extensive in-home interview\nand a health examination at the mobile examination\nsample persons) were examined. The total analytic\nsample, excluding incomplete and unreliable dietary\nrecalls and incomplete marijuana data, is 10,623 adults,\nwhich is 94% of those participants who were examined\nand 71% of the total persons sampled.\nThe household interview generally took place one to\nthree weeks prior to the MEC health examination. Data on\nmarijuana use were collected during the health examina-\ntion. Non-current marijuana users included never users\nn  5843 and those who reported ever having used\nmarijuana, but who had not used marijuana in the past\nmonth n  3928X Initial analysis showed these two\ngroups to be similar in social characteristics (e.g. age and\neducation) and dietary intake, and therefore they were\ncombined n  9771X We classified participants who\nreported using marijuana in the past month (number of\ndays in the past month) by frequency of use: less than or\nequal to four days per month n  541Y five to 10 days\nn  176X For the purpose of this paper, we shall refer to\nthese groups as light, moderate and heavy users,\nrespectively.\nDietary intake assessment\nOne 24-hour dietary recall was collected during the visit\nto the MEC. The dietary interviewers used the Dietary\nData Collection system, which is an automated, standar-\ndised, interactive dietary interview and coding system.\nThe system was specifically developed for NHANES III by\nthe University of Minnesota Nutrition Coordinating\nCenter. Participants were asked to report all foods and\nbeverages consumed, excluding plain drinking water,\nduring the previous 24 hours, from midnight to midnight.\nDuring the household interview, a food-frequency\nquestionnaire (FFQ) with a one month reference period\nwas administered by an interviewer. The FFQ did not\ninclude information on serving size and is not designed to\nprovide quantitative nutrient data. It does provide informa-\ntion on the frequency of consumption of specific foods or\nfood groupings, such as frequency of beer use or frequency\nof the use of salty snacks during the past month.\nBlood measurements\nBlood concentrations were determined on a specimen\nobtained by venipuncture during the visit to the MEC.\nDetails of the laboratory procedures can be found in the\nLaboratory Procedures Used in NHANES III10. The Coulter\nCounter Model S-PLUS JR with Coulter histogram differ-\nential is a quantitative, automated haematology analyser\nand was used to determine 16 haematologic parameters\nincluding haemoglobin and haematocrit. Albumin was\nmeasured with the Boehringer Manneheim Diagnostics\n(BMD, Indianapolis, IN) albumin system and the bromo-\ncresol purple binding agent. Folate was measured by\nusing the Bio-Rad Laboratories `Quantaphase Folate'\nradioassay kit. Serum levels of vitamin A (retinol), vitamin\nE (tocopherol) and carotenoids were measured by\nisocratic high-performance liquid chromatography with\ndetection at three different wavelengths.\nSerumtotalcholesterolwasanalysedenzymaticallyinthe\nJohns Hopkins University Lipid Research Clinic Laboratory,\nusing the method of Allain et al.11 and the reagent mixture\nStatistical analysis\nTotal and adjusted means and variances of dietary intake\nand blood biochemistries were calculated using SAS\nSample weights, provided by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics, were used to correct for differential\nselection probabilities and to adjust for non-coverage and\nnon-response.

A\ntotal of 8.7% of the sample population reported using\nmarijuana in the past month, with 5.5% using one to four\ntimes a month (light users), 1.3% using five to 10 times a\nmonth (moderate users), and 1.9% using 11 or more times\na month (heavy users).\nTable 1 shows the social characteristics of adults, 20 to\n59 years of age, who participated in NHANES III by\nmarijuana use. Non-current users were older than users\nand the proportion of men was higher among users than\nnon-current users. The proportion of participants with\nannual household income of greater than $50,000 was\nhighest in the non-current users and lowest in the heavy\nusers. Similarly, the proportion of participants with an\neducation level of more than high school was highest in\nthe non-current users and lowest in the heavy users.\nThe proportion of participants who reported smoking\ncigarettes was lowest in the non-current users and highest\nin the heavy users. Among those who reported smoking\ncigarettes, the mean number of cigarettes in the past five\ndays was also lowest in the non-current users and highest\nin the heavy users. As shown in Table 1, mean body mass\nindex (BMI) was lower in the heavy users than in the non-\nremained after adjusting for age, gender, education,\ncigarette smoking and caloric intake P  0X003 (data\nnot shown). A similar proportion was underweight\nmoderate users). The proportion overweight or obese\nBMI $ 25 was also similar among all groups: 54%\namong non-current users, 42% among the light users,\n49% among the moderate users, and 42% among the\nheavy users.\nDietary intake is shown in Tables 2 and 3. Total caloric\nintake was highest in the heavy users. Light, moderate and\nmore calories than non-current users. After adjusting for\nage, sex and education, the calories were 13%, 17% and\n25%, respectively, higher than for the non-current users.\nThe percentage of energy from fat was lower among the\nheavy users than among the non-current users, whereas\nthe percentage of calories from alcohol was higher in the\nheavy users than in the non-current users.\nAbsolute and energy-adjusted values are provided for\nthe grams of protein, carbohydrate, fat and alcohol (Table\n2), and micronutrients (Table 3). The absolute intake\nreflects the actual amount consumed and is of interest for\nexamining differences in intake among the users and non-\ncurrent users. The energy-adjusted values are of interest\nfor examining the amount of nutrient relative to the total\nenergy intake. Absolute intakes among heavy users were\nhigher for all macronutrients and alcohol than among the\nnon-current users. Fat and alcohol intake remained higher\nafter energy adjustment.\nWomen tend to consume fewer calories than men, and\nmore men than women use marijuana. Therefore, we\ncompared dietary intake between male non-current\nmarijuana users and male marijuana users, and found\nthe macronutrient intakes to be higher in users than in\nnon-current users. We also compared women non-current\nmarijuana users and women marijuana users, and again\nfound macronutrient intakes to be higher in users than in\nTable 1 Social characteristics of US adults, 20\u00b159 years of age, according to marijuana use in the past month\nNon-current users\nRace (%)\nGender (%)\nIncome (%)\nEducation (%)\nDietary intake and nutritional status of marijuana users\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

We therefore report\nthe combined, gender-adjusted data.\n, folate, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin,\ncalcium, phosphorus, iron, zinc, potassium and sodium\nwere higher among the heavy users than among the non-\ncurrent users. Most of these differences were reduced or\ndisappeared after energy adjustment. Energy-adjusted\nintakes of carotenes and vitamin C were significantly\nlower among the heavy users than among non-current\nusers.\nWe subsequently examined the food-frequency data\n(Table 4). The frequencies do not include serving sizes\nand although we can determine the frequency of\nconsumption, we cannot compare the serving size.\nMarijuana users had a higher frequency of beer, liquor,\nregular sodas, pork, cheese and salted snacks consump-\ntion than non-current users, whereas frequency of diet\nsodas and fruits consumption was lower.\nTable 5 shows serum values for various health\nindicators and serum nutrient levels. Although serum\nhaemoglobin and haematocrit levels were higher in the\nmarijuana users than in the non-current users, the\ndifferences were clinically small. Serum albumin, choles-\nterol and triglycerides were similar between marijuana\nusers and non-current users. Most of the serum carote-\nnoids were lower in the heavy users than in the non-\ncurrent users.\nDiscussion\nWe examined food consumption, nutrient intake and\nserum nutrients among US adults, aged 20\u00b159 years, who\nparticipated in the NHANES III and who reported using\nmarijuana in the past month compared with those who\ndid not report using marijuana in the past month.\nMarijuana users were younger, had a lower income,\nwere more likely to be smokers and were less likely to\nhave completed high school than non-current marijuana\nTable 2 Dietary intake of macronutrients in US adults, 20\u00b159 years of age, according to marijuana use in the past month\nMean^SE Adjusted\u00b2 Mean^SE Adjusted\u00b2 Mean^SE Adjusted\u00b2 Mean^SE Adjusted\u00b2\n\u00b2 Adjusted for age, sex and education for percentage of energy; adjusted for age, sex, education and energy for grams of protein, fat, carbohydrate and alcohol.\n* Significantly different from non-current users, P # 0X05X\n** Significantly different from non-current users, P # 0X0001X\nTable 3 Dietary intake of micronutrients in US adults, 20\u00b159 years of age, according to marijuana use in the past month\nMean^SE Adjusted\u00b2 Mean^SE Adjusted\u00b2 Mean^SE Adjusted\u00b2 Mean^SE Adjusted\u00b2\nVitamin B6\n\u00b2 Adjusted for age, sex, education and energy intake.\n* Significantly different from non-current users, P # 0X05X\n** Significantly different from non-current users, P # 0X0001X\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

We found caloric intake to be higher among\nmarijuana users than among non-current users and that\nthe intake increased as frequency of marijuana use\nincreased (Table 2). Although energy intake was higher\namong marijuana users, their BMI was somewhat lower.\nAdditionally, most of the indicators of nutritional status\n(serum nutrients, serum albumin, haematocrit and haemo-\nglobin) were not different between marijuana users and\nnon-marijuana users.\nThe higher caloric intake findings agree with other\nsmaller studies looking at the effect of marijuana use on\ncaloric intake5\u00b18. Foltin et al. found a 40% increase in\ncaloric intake among marijuana users7, while we found\nthat users had 24 to 40% higher intakes than non-current\nusers. We also showed that the higher caloric intake came\nfrom higher absolute amounts of protein, carbohydrates,\nfat and alcohol, and more specifically from the higher\nfrequency of beer, liquor, sodas, pork, cheese and salty\nsnacks consumption. It has been suggested that in addition\nto stimulation of appetite, the reason for higher intakes\namong marijuana users may be related to the notion that\nmarijuana is often used in social groups where food and\nalcoholic beverages may be more readily available6.\nIn contrast to some studies that have reported an\nincrease in body weight with marijuana use5, we found\nBMI to be somewhat lower among marijuana users than\nin non-marijuana users. Given the higher caloric intake,\none might expect higher body weights among users than\nnon-current users; however, other factors may affect this\nrelationship. For example, higher energy intake may be\nan indicator that physical activity and/or metabolic rate\ncould be higher among marijuana users than among non-\ncurrent users. When we adjusted caloric intake for\nparticipation in leisure-time physical activity in addition\nto age, sex and income, we found that the caloric\ndifferences remained the same. We also adjusted for\nTable 4 Frequency of consumption of specific foods and beverages in US adults, 20\u00b159 years of age, according to marijuana use in the\npast month\u00b2\nNon-current users\n\u00b2 Adjusted for age, sex, education and race\u00b1ethnicity.\n* Significantly different from non-current users, P # 0X05X\n** Significantly different from non-current users, P # 0X0001X\nTable 5 Serum nutrient levels and other serum health indicators in US adults, 20\u00b159 years of age, according to marijuana use in the past\nmonth\nMean^SE Adjusted\u00b2 Mean^SE Adjusted\u00b2 Mean^SE Adjusted\u00b2 Mean^SE Adjusted\u00b2\n\u00b2 Adjusted for age, sex and education.\n* Significantly different from non-current users, P # 0X05X\n** Significantly different from non-current users, P # 0X0001X\nDietary intake and nutritional status of marijuana users\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Zwillich et al.\nfound that the metabolic rate of marijuana users increased\nfor up to 60 min after marijuana use in a placebo-\ncontrolled study of eight volunteers8. Although we could\nnot test this hypothesis in our population-based study, a\nhigher metabolic rate may be a plausible explanation that\nwill need to be investigated further.\nSome have suggested that drug users have diets poor in\nvitamins and minerals, which could be a public health\nconcern3,12. We found that the majority of absolute\nvitamin and mineral intakes were higher among mari-\njuana users than among non-current users, and energy-\nadjusted vitamin and mineral intakes were similar\nbetween marijuana users and non-current users. More-\nover, intakes for most nutrients were within the Recom-\nmended Dietary Allowances (RDA) or the Dietary\nReference Intakes (DRI). Only folate intake was below\nthe DRI and this was the case for both marijuana users\nand non-current users.\nSerum haemoglobin, haematocrit, albumin and most of\nthe serum nutrients were within normal ranges for both\nmarijuana users and non-current users. This is in\nagreement with Mendelson, who found no abnormalities\nin blood chemistries in 70 male chronic marijuana users5.\nWe found, however, lower serum carotenoid levels\namong marijuana users than among the non-current\nusers, which may be due to the oxidative effect of\ncigarette smoking. When we examined serum carotenoid\nlevels stratified by cigarette smoking, we found that\namong non-cigarette smokers, marijuana users had lower\ncarotenoid levels than non-current marijuana users.\nSimilarly, among cigarette smokers, marijuana users had\nlower carotenoid levels than non-current marijuana users\n(data not shown). These results suggest that marijuana\nuse is associated with lower serum carotenoid levels\nindependent of cigarette smoking. Sarafian et al. found\nmarijuana smoke to be a source of cellular oxidative\nstress13, which may in part explain the differences in\nserum carotenoids. The differences may also in part be\ndue to the lower dietary carotenoid intake, higher alcohol\nintake, and lower frequency of fruit and vegetable\nconsumption among the heavy users than among non-\ncurrent users (Tables 3 and 4).\nUsing cross-sectional data limits our ability to assess\ncause-and-effect relationships. However, these data are\nvery useful in estimating marijuana use and describing\nintake patterns among groups of individuals. The 24-hour\nrecall does not reflect usual or individual intake and\ndoes not include supplemental intake. It does provide\nreasonable group estimates of dietary nutrient intake14.\nThe FFQ does not provide quantitative nutrient informa-\ntion, but it does provide information on the usual\nconsumption of specific foods or food groupings. Little\nis known about the cognitive impact of marijuana use on\ndiet recall. We also do not have information on the\namount of marijuana smoked and do not know the extent\nof underestimation of marijuana frequency. Despite these\nlimitations, we consider that these data provide reason-\nable estimates of dietary intake by marijuana use.\nIn summary, marijuana users had higher intakes of\nenergy and nutrients than non-marijuana users and did not\nappear to have a poor nutritional status using indicators of\nbody mass index, serum nutrients, serum albumin,\nhaematocrit and haemoglobin. At the same time, marijuana\nusers had a higher consumption of sodium, lower fruit\nintake, lower serum carotenoid levels, higher alcohol\nintake, and higher rate of cigarette smoking. The long-\nterm health effects of these lifestyle habits among marijuana\nusers deserve careful consideration in future research.\nReferences\n1 Office of Applied Studies, Substance Abuse and Mental\nHealth Services Administration.
