Support for\nthese hypotheses comes from a diversity of scientific approaches:\nAnimal and in vitro studies have shown that vitamin D plays a\nvariety of biologic roles that potentially reduce cancer incidence\nand promote survival, including suppressing tumor progression by\nreducing cell proliferation and stimulating apoptosis and cell dif-\nferentiation (3,4). Exposure to sunlight is one of the major sources\nof vitamin D (5), and ecologic studies have demonstrated an\ninverse association between indicators of residential ultraviolet\nradiation and cancer mortality at various sites, including the colon,\novary, prostate, and breast (6\u00ad9). Subsequent ecologic and obser-\nvational studies found an inverse gradient for solar radiation sur-\nrogates (e.g., residence, outdoor work) for mortality due to these\nand other cancer sites (10\u00ad12). Recent analytic epidemiologic stud-\nies found improved survival for several cancers if diagnosis or treat-\nment occurred during nonwinter seasons, compared with winter,\nleading to the speculation that therapy may positively interact with\nvitamin D (2,13\u00ad16). The observation that some individuals who\nare obese or dark-skinned tend to have lower vitamin D levels and\nhigher cancer mortality has led some investigators to suggest that\nthese associations may be mediated by vitamin D levels (1,17).\nFinally, a recent Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS)\nthat was based on predicted 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]\nvalues (the major circulating form of vitamin D) estimated that a\n25 nmol/L difference in predicted 25(OH)D was associated with a\n29% reduction in total cancer mortality risk in men (18).\nAfter its photochemical synthesis in the skin, vitamin D\nis\nhydroxylated in the liver to the major circulating form, 25(OH)D,\nand further hydroxylated in the kidneys, to the active or hormonal\nform of vitamin D [1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D\nD].

Michal Freedman, Anne C. Looker, Shih-Chen Chang, Barry I. Graubard\nBackground Vitamin D has been hypothesized to reduce cancer mortality through its effects on incidence and/or sur-\nvival. Epidemiologic studies of the association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and the risk of cancer,\nhowever, have been largely limited to incident cancers at a few sites.\nMethods A total of 16818 participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey who were 17\nmeasured at baseline by radioimmunoassay. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to\nexamine the relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and total cancer mortality (in the entire popula-\ntion or according to race/ethnicity, sex, age, and retinol status) and mortality from specific cancers.\nBecause serum was collected in the south in cooler months and the north in warmer months, we exam-\nined associations by collection season. All statistical tests were two-sided.\nResults We identified 536 cancer deaths in 146578 person-years. Total cancer mortality was unrelated to baseline\nvitamin D status in the entire population, men, women, non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican\nAmericans, and in persons younger than 70 or 70 years or older. We found no interaction between vitamin\nD and season or vitamin D and serum retinol. Colorectal cancer mortality was inversely related to serum\n25(OH)D level, with levels 80 nmol/L or higher associated with a 72% risk reduction (95% confidence inter-\ntrend\nConclusions Our results do not support an association between 25(OH)D and total cancer mortality, although there was\nan inverse relationship between 25(OH)D levels and colorectal cancer mortality.\njnci.oxfordjournals.org JNCI | Articles 1595\nand sun exposure [and serve as a substrate for 1,25(OH)\nD in other\norgans], whereas circulating 1,25(OH)\nD is homeostatically con-\ntrolled, circulating 25(OH)D is considered to be reflective of an\nindividual's vitamin D status.\nDespite the potential benefits of vitamin D, to our knowledge,\nthe relationship between measured vitamin D levels and total can-\ncer mortality has not been examined prospectively. In this study,\nwe examined the relationship between serum 25(OH)D and cancer\nmortality in persons aged 17 years and older from the Third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES\nIII), a nationally representative sample of the noninstitutionalized\nUS population.\nMethods\nStudy Population\nThe NHANES III survey, which was conducted between 1988 and\n1994 by the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, was designed to examine the\nhealth and nutritional status of the noninstitutionalized US popula-\ntion (20). In addition to providing representative estimates of health\nand nutrition for the total noninstitutionalized population, the sur-\nvey was designed to provide separate estimates for three major\nracial/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks,\nand Mexican Americans. It was conducted with oversampling from\nthe latter two populations. Data were collected by interview and\nphysical examinations (conducted in Mobile Examinations Centers)\nthat included blood sampling for vitamin D and other serum con-\nstituents. All procedures were approved by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics Institutional Review Board, and all subjects pro-\nvided written informed consent.\nWe restricted eligibility to those who were aged 17 years and\nolder at baseline and who had completed the physical examination\nin a Mobile Examination Center (n = 17705). Those who had no\n25(OH)D measurement (n = 875), were of unknown mortality\nstatus (n = 11), or were missing birthdate (n = 1) were excluded,\nVitamin D Measurement\nDetailed information on the assay used to measure 25(OH)D has\nbeen provided elsewhere (21). Briefly, levels of serum 25(OH)D\nwere assayed with a radioimmunoassay kit (DiaSorin, Stillwater,\ncoefficient of variation, 25%, corresponds to a mean 25(OH)D\nvalue close to the assay detection limit, which reflects the fact that\nsmall variability in the lower levels of measured 25(OH)D values\ncan result in higher coefficients of variation.\nalternative cut points for 25(OH)D insufficiency (in the absence\nof agreement on optimal levels) (21,22). Even lower values, e.g.,\n37.5 nmol/L, have been used as cut points, but small case num-\nbers prevented us from using lower threshold values in our analy-\nses. The highest cut points were selected to reflect the full\ncohort respectively, corresponding to 25(OH)D levels of 80 to\nSubgroup analyses included fewer cut points, with the number of\nintervals varying according to the case number size in each\nsubgroup.\nSample Collection\nseasons, with collection in southern latitudes undertaken in the\ncooler months of November through March and collection in\nnorthern latitudes in warmer months (April\u00adOctober) because the\nmobile vans used for data collection were sensitive to weather\n(21). Thus, season and latitude, both of which are related to\n25(OH)D levels, are linked in the dataset, which limits the oppor-\ntunity to assess each variable independent of the other. We refer\nto the two groups as \"winter/lower latitude\" and \"summer/higher\nlatitude.\"\nEndpoint Ascertainment\nFollow-up of the cohort continued from data collection until\nMortality file (International Statistical Classification of Diseases,\n10th Revision) (with 113 underlying causes of death), which had\nbeen derived through probabilistic linkage with the National Death\nIndex. Cancer mortality was based on International Statistical\nClassification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes (Table 2). Survival\nfollow-up continued until the event of interest, an underlying cause\nof death due to cancer. Follow-up was censored at the date of death\nfor persons who died of other diseases and at December 31, 2000,\nfor persons who were not known to have died.\nPrior knowledge\nBased on epidemiologic studies, vitamin D has been hypothesized\nto reduce cancer mortality.\nStudy design\nCox proportional hazard regression models were used to exam-\nine the relationship between serum vitamin D level measured in\nparticipants in a nationwide survey of health and nutrition and\ncancer mortality.\nContribution\nThis study found that total cancer mortality was not related to vita-\nmin D status but that higher levels of vitamin D may be associated\nwith a reduced risk of colorectal cancer mortality.\nImplications\nInverse associations between a surrogate for vitamin D status and\ncancer mortality reported previously are not supported by the\nresults of this study.\nLimitations\nThis study lacked power to clarify associations between vitamin D\nstatus and particular cancers for which there were insufficient\ndeaths, and it relied on a single measurement to reflect serum\nvitamin D status.\nConfounding Variables\nWe considered race/ethnicity, latitude, body mass index (BMI),\ntotal body fat, education level, smoking patterns, levels of physical\nactivity, disease history, calcium intake, and serum retinol levels as\npotential confounders. Race/ethnicity was based on self-report, and\nlatitude, on the location of the physical examination. BMI was cal-\nculated as body weight (kilograms) divided by height (meters)\nsquared, using height and weight measured during the physical\nexam (20). Total body fat (kilograms) was derived using bioelectri-\ncal impedance analysis data as previously described (23).\nEducation was based on self-reported number of years of\nschooling completed. Smoking status was derived from responses\nto questionnaire items that asked whether the respondents had\never smoked at least 100 cigarettes, and if so, whether they cur-\nrently smoked. Pack-years were calculated from multiplying the\nreported number of cigarettes smoked per day by the years\nsmoked. There were two physical activity variables, one based on\nthe self-reported frequency of various activities and another\nderived from a self-rating of personal activity level compared with\nothers of the same age and sex.\nDietary calcium and vitamin D intake from food and alcohol\nwere based on a single 24-hour dietary recall. The University of\nMinnesota Nutrition Coordinating Center food composition data-\nbase was used for the vitamin D composition data (24,25), while\nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture food composition database\nprovided the calcium and alcohol values (26). Serum retinol was\nmeasured by high-performance liquid chromatography at the\nNational Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (27).\nStatistical Analysis\nChi-square tests and multiple linear regression were used to assess\nassociations between baseline demographic and health-related\ncharacteristics and serum 25(OH)D levels. Cox proportional haz-\nards regression analysis was used to compute relative risks (RR)\nwith 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for total and site-specific can-\ncer mortality by categorical level of 25(OH)D, with age (beginning\nat baseline) as the time line (28). The proportional hazards\nassumption was tested by examining the interaction between the\nage attained during the study with the measured continuous\n25(OH)D serum value and was found to be satisfied. We examined\ntotal cancer mortality in each of the two season/latitude groups, as\nwell as for each sex, in non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks,\nand Mexican Americans, and in age strata (<70 and 70 years\n[attained age], with these strata selected based on case numbers).\nTo further assess whether 25(OH)D levels are associated with dif-\nference in cancer mortality by race, we examined mortality risk with\nand without adjusting for 25(OH)D measurements, after control-\nling for a number of potentially confounding factors generally\ncomparable to those in the HPFS that sought to explore the role of\nvitamin D in explaining racial differences in cancer incidence and\nmortality (29). These factors were sex, smoking status, BMI, lati-\ntude, total calories, alcohol, dietary calcium intake, serum retinol\nand physical activity.\nWe also assessed site-specific cancer mortality, including\nmortality due to cancer of the lung, colon or rectum, other diges-\ntive organs, breast, and prostate, as well as mortality due to non-\nHodgkin lymphoma or leukemia. Site-specific cancer mortality\noutcomes were selected based in part on suggested protective asso-\nciations with dietary, circulating vitamin D, and other indicators of\nvitamin D exposure reported previously (e.g., colorectal, breast,\nlymphoma and leukemia because of small numbers and because\nexperimental and epidemiologic studies suggest a possible associa-\ntion between vitamin D or solar radiation and these hematopoetic\nPotential confounders were assessed by examining Pearson and\nSpearman correlation coefficients with serum 25(OH)D for the\nunweighted sample. No correlation coefficient was greater than\n.24. We also assessed the potential confounders listed above to\nidentify the ones that substantively affected the main effects. The\nfinal models were adjusted for sex, race/ethnicity, and smoking\n(never, former, current <20 pack-years, 20 pack-years, unknown\npack-years). We also analyzed the relationships between 25(OH)D\nand cancer mortality after excluding the first year of follow-up\nbecause individuals who died within the first year may have had\ndisease at baseline. However, exclusion of the first year of follow-\nup had little effect on risks, and results are not reported.\nTrend tests were based on modeling the measured values of\n25(OH)D both as a continuous variable and by assigning a value\nfor the median of each category of measured values and modeling\nthe resulting variable as continuous. Results were similar using\nboth methods (when there were more than two categories), so only\nthose based on the former are reported. All statistical tests were\ntwo-sided, and P values less than .05 were considered to be statisti-\ncally significant.\nTo explore effect modification, we examined stratified analyses\nand multiplicative interaction by creating product terms. We\nassessed seasonal/latitude group for interaction with 25(OH)D for\ntotal cancer mortality. We also examined interaction of 25(OH)D\nlevel with serum retinol levels for total cancer and colorectal can-\ncer mortality to explore a published hypothesis that retinol intake\nmay counteract the cancer prevention effects of vitamin D (1).\nAll statistical tests using Cox proportional hazards analysis were\nbased on the Wald-F test (36). The data were analyzed using the\nSUDAAN software program, a family of statistical procedures for\nanalysis of data from complex sample surveys (release 9.0.1,\nResearch Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). Sample\nweights were used to conduct weighted analyses to account for\nthe unequal probability of selecting individuals and for survey\nResults\nyears of follow-up in the NHANES III study, of which 206 were in\nthe winter/lower latitude group and 330 in the summer/higher lati-\ntude group. The distribution of 25(OH)D measurements varied to\na statistically significant extent according to the factors presented\nin Table 1 (P.001, except for education [P = .01] and alcohol\n[P = .004]). Men, whites, and more highly educated participants\nwere more likely to have higher 25(OH)D values than women, both\nAfrican Americans and Mexican Americans, and less educated par-\nticipants, respectively (Table 1). Higher BMI was associated with\njnci.oxfordjournals.org JNCI | Articles 1597\nlower 25(OH)D serum measurement, with a mean BMI of 27.8\nkg/m2 in subjects with 25(OH)D lower than 50 nmol/L and a mean\nIn contrast, reported levels of physical activity were higher in those\nwith higher 25(OH)D, with 71.1% of those with circulating\n25(OH)D lower than 50 nmol/L reporting a level of physical activ-\nity the same or greater than others of the same age/sex and 80.4%\nreporting such physical activity in those with circulating 25(OH)D\n80 nmol/L or higher. Dietary vitamin D and calcium, as well as\nserum retinol, were higher in those with higher 25(OH)D levels\n(Table 1).\nIn the combined group of both season/latitude subpopulations,\ntotal cancer mortality was unrelated to 25(OH)D level (P\ntrend\n(Table 2). There was also no relationship to cancer mortality in\neither the winter/lower latitude or summer/higher latitude groups,\nand the test for interaction with season/latitude groups was not\nstatistically significant (P = .36).\nWhen we confined the analysis to men, there was similarly no\nstatistically significant association between 25(OH)D and cancer\nmortality risk in the combined season/latitude subpopulations,\nalthough there was a suggestion of elevated risk in the two highest\n(Table 2). In women, there was also no association in the com-\nbined season/latitude subpopulations (Table 2). Because the test\nfor interaction with season/latitudes groups was not statistically\nsignificant for men (P = .70) or for women (P = .26), we have not\npresented associations by sex and season/latitude groups. In addi-\ntion, no association was seen in each age stratum (<70 or 70 years\nat attained age; data not shown).\nWhen we considered racial/ethnic groups separately, there was\nalso no association between 25(OH)D and total cancer mortality in\nnon-Hispanic whites (P\ntrend\n= .80), non-Hispanic blacks (P\ntrend\nor Mexican Americans (P\ntrend\n= .37) (Table 3). As with sex, the test\nfor interaction with season/latitude groups was not statistically\nsignificant for non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, or\nMexican Americans, and we have therefore not presented associa-\ntions by season/latitude group. Moreover, we found a statistically\nsignificantly elevated risk in non-Hispanic blacks compared with\nnon-Hispanic whites that was not reduced by adjusting for serum\n25(OH)D (data not shown).\nWe analyzed the relationship between serum 25(OH)D level\nand site-specific cancer mortality (Table 4). One hundred fifty-\nthree subjects died of lung cancer; 66, of colorectal cancer; 72, of\nother digestive cancers; 28, of breast cancer; 47, of prostate can-\ncer; 40, of non-Hodgkin lymphoma or leukemia; and 130, of\nother cancers. We found no relationship between 25(OH)D level\nand lung cancer mortality. There was a statistically significant\ninverse relationship between colorectal cancer mortality and\ntrend\n= .02).

There\nwas a suggestion of declining risk (RR with increasing retinol = 0.94\nCI = 0.49 to 1.09]), but the linear trend was not statistically signifi-\ncant (P\ntrend\n= .17). The pattern was similar in both season/latitude\ngroups (data not shown). The relationship between 25(OH)D\n(whether treated as a continuous or categorical variable) and total\ncancer mortality was not modified by serum retinol (in two catego-\nries, split at the median) (test of interaction, P = .13 and P = .41,\nrespectively). There was also no interaction between 25(OH)D and\nserum retinol for colorectal cancer mortality (P = .76, P = .91).\nDiscussion\nWe found no association between 25(OH)D and total cancer mor-\ntality in the total NHANES III study population or in either\nseason/latitude subpopulation. We did, however, find an inverse\nassociation with colorectal cancer mortality. Although there was\nalso a statistically significant inverse association with female breast\ncancer mortality when subjects were divided into those with high\nand low levels of 25(OH)D, the linear trend was not statistically\nsignificant and the number of deaths due to breast cancer was\nsmall. For all other cancer sites and groups of sites that we exam-\nined, there was no association between mortality and 25(OH)D\nlevels. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the\nrelationship between measured serum vitamin D levels and cancer\nmortality for selected sites and for all sites combined.\nThe study of the relationship between vitamin D levels and\ncancer mortality has been based largely on latitude or other surro-\ngates for exposure to solar radiation, not vitamin D itself (6,7,10).\nTable 2.

P\ntrend\nwas based on 25(OH)D as a\ncontinuous variable. Categories were selected to reflect alternative cut points of 25(OH)D insufficiency and the full distribution of 25(OH)D values (21,22).\n Cancer mortality was based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes for cancer sites as follows: C33\u00adC34 (lung, trachea, and\nbronchus); C18\u00adC21 (colon, rectum, and anus); C15, C16, C22, C25 (other digestive system, i.e., esophagus, stomach, liver, pancreatic cancer); C50 (breast); C61\nC67\u00adC80, C88, C90, C97 (other cancers, including buccal, larynx, melanoma, gynecological sites, kidney, bladder, brain, multiple myeloma).\njnci.oxfordjournals.org JNCI | Articles 1599\nThere has, however, been one randomized controlled 5-year trial\nof triannual high oral doses of vitamin D that evaluated cancer\nmortality. It found a somewhat lower cancer mortality risk (RR =\nD, although the case numbers were small (n = 135 cancer deaths in\nboth arms combined) and the difference in risk was not statistically\nsignificant (37). In addition, as noted above, one study estimated\nthat there was a 29% reduction in total cancer mortality risk\nassociated with an increment of 25 nmol/L in 25(OH)D based on\na predictive model for vitamin D level (18).\nSeveral studies have, however, addressed the association\nbetween serum vitamin D level and site-specific cancer incidence.\nOur finding that colorectal cancer mortality is inversely associated\nwith 25(OH)D is consistent with a large number of observational\nepidemiologic studies (1,17,38). Several prospective studies of the\nrelationship between serum/plasma 25(OH)D and colorectal can-\ncer incidence have found a reduced risk associated with increased\nvitamin D. One of the largest of these was a nested case\u00adcontrol\nstudy with 193 cases of colorectal cancer within the Nurses' Health\nStudy. It found that the odds ratio of colorectal cancer for women\nin the highest relative to the lowest quintile of 25(OH)D was 0.53\nlinear inverse trend (P = .02) (39). Three smaller studies\ncancer associated with higher 25(OH)D (40\u00ad42). In addition, cir-\nculating 25(OH)D was associated with reduced risk of colorectal\nadenomas in women, although not in men (43). However, the\nWomen's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial of\naverage of 7 years of follow-up found no association between the\nintervention supplements and colorectal cancer incidence (44).\nNonetheless, the case\u00adcontrol study of baseline serum 25(OH)D\nnested in the trial found a statistically significant inverse associa-\ntion of colorectal cancer risk with baseline level of serum 25(OH)D,\nsuggesting that the null result of the trial may have been due to low\ntrial doses of vitamin D, insufficient trial duration (45), or reduced\nrisk being limited to those with low baseline levels.\nOnly one study has prospectively examined the relationship\nbetween circulating levels of 25(OH)D and the risk of breast can-\ncer (46). In that study, which included 701 breast cancer patients,\nwomen in the third, fourth, or fifth quintiles of 25(OH)D had a\nsomewhat lower risk of incident breast cancer than women in the\ntwo lowest quintiles, suggesting a possible threshold effect.\nAlthough we observed a substantially reduced risk of breast cancer\nmortality for those with 25(OH)D measurements at or above 62.5\nnmol/L, the linear trend was not statistically significant and the\nnumber of breast cancer deaths was small, so the result must be\ninterpreted with caution. In fact, the estimated relative risk of\nbreast cancer mortality associated with a 50-nmol change in\nCI = 0.24 to 2.85) that are, too wide to rule out either the possible\nprotective effect observed in the study by Bertone-Johnson et al.\n(46) in which the relative risk for the fifth quintile compared with\nthe first quintile [a difference in 25(OH)D of approximately\nThe absence of other associations, including the lack of any\nrelationship between 25(OH)D level and total cancer mortality,\ndoes not support the current interest in 25(OH)D as a prohormone\nthat reduces the risk of and mortality due to a wide range of can-\ncers. It is also inconsistent with the inverse association with cancer\nmortality risk observed in the HPFS, which was based on predicted\n25(OH)D values rather than on actual measured values (18).\nThere was no association between total cancer mortality and\n25(OH)D in non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and\nMexican Americans; thus, our results do not support the hypothe-\nsis that low vitamin D levels in blacks contribute to racial dispari-\nties in cancer mortality (29). The fact that the cancer mortality risk\nin non-Hispanic blacks relative to non-Hispanic whites did not fall\nafter adjusting for serum 25(OH)D is also inconsistent with vita-\nmin D being a major factor in cancer mortality differences.\nTable 3.

It has been proposed that if retinol lev-\nels are high, this molecule may compete with hormonal vitamin D\nfor the retinoid X receptor and thus reduce the activity of vitamin\nD (1). Animal and human evidence cited in support of the hypoth-\nesis relates to effects of vitamin D on serum calcium and bone\nhealth (1). Although one nested case\u00adcontrol study (46) of breast\ncancer and 25(OH)D examined the effects of retinol levels and did\nnot find that retinol modified the actions of 25(OH)D, our study\nis the first, to our knowledge, to examine whether serum retinol\nmodifies the association between 25(OH)D and total cancer mor-\ntality.

Thus, our results do not support a role for retinol levels\nin modifying an association between 25(OH)D levels and cancer.\nOur study had several strengths. Serum 25(OH)D measure-\nments were obtained from an entire study population that was\nderived from a representative sample of the civilian, noninstitu-\ntionalized US population. We studied a wide range of covariates\nand assessed an endpoint, cancer mortality, with a substantial\nfollow-up period (median 8.9 years) so that our results would be\nsensitive to potential associations of vitamin D with survival.\nOur study, however, recorded small numbers of cancer deaths\nfor certain cancer sites and racial and season/latitude subgroups,\nand this limited our ability to detect associations.

Categories were selected to reflect alternative cut points of 25(OH)D insufficiency and the full distribution of 25(OH)D values (21,22).\n Includes esophagus, stomach, liver, and pancreatic cancer.\n Includes anal cancer mortality.\n\u00a7 Includes buccal, larynx, melanoma, gynecological sites, kidney, bladder, brain, multiple myeloma, and others.\njnci.oxfordjournals.org JNCI | Articles 1601\nlatitudes, and a measurement of 25(OH)D based on a blood sample\nthat was collected at a single point in time, an imperfect surrogate\nfor long-term indicators of 25(OH)D. A recent cohort study, how-\never, measured 25(OH)D concentrations at two times that were\n3 years apart and found a Pearson correlation coefficient of .70\nIn summary, we did not find a relationship between prospective\nserum 25(OH)D and total cancer mortality, although we observed\na negative dose\u00adresponse relationship between 25(OH)D and\ncolorectal cancer mortality. Serum retinol did not modify the rela-\ntionship between 25(OH)D and total cancer or colorectal mortal-\nity. Additional studies with large numbers of samples of measured\n25(OH)D serum levels, preferably at multiple time points, are\nneeded to confirm the total cancer mortality findings of this paper\nand to obtain more accurate risk estimates for mortality from\nspecific cancers.\nReferences\n(1) Giovannucci E.
