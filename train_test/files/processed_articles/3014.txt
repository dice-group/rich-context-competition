By contrast, results from one\nstudy using a national population-\ngested that disabled women may have\nreceived somewhat less informal care\nthan their male counterparts.8\nIn contrast to the paucity of articles\non gender differences in receiving care,\nthere are more articles addressing gen-\nder differences in giving care. This lit-\neraturestronglysuggeststhatwomenare\nmuch more likely to be caregivers than\nmen.3,4 The dominance of women in the\ncaregiving role has been attributed to\nseveral factors including the fact that\nfewer women have been engaged in paid\nemployment and that women may more\neasily assume the role of caregiver to a\ndisabled spouse or parent because of tra-\nditional social role functioning.9\nWe used a large national survey rep-\nresentativeofnoninstitutionalizedelderly\npeople living in the United States to\naddressgenderdifferencesinthereceipt\nof informal and formal home care.

In ad-\ndition to measures of the health and\nfunctional status of the elderly survey\nrespondents, data on the number of\nhours of care provided by both paid and\nunpaid caregivers in the home were col-\nlected. Seventy-two percent of those\nby telephone, whereas 70% of those\naged 80 years or older were inter-\nviewedinperson(baselineresponserate\nspondents in our study sample re-\nquired a proxy (most often a family\nmember) to help complete the survey.\nResponse rate did not differ signifi-\ncantly by mode of questioning and nei-\nther mode of questioning nor proxy sta-\ntus affected our results in this study.\nStudy Sample\nspondents who: (1) were aged 70 years\nor older; (2) lived in the community;\nand (3) were disabled, defined as re-\nporting during the prior month that\nthey had difficulty or were receiving\nhelp with 1 or more activity of daily liv-\ning (ADL), ie, eating, transferring, toi-\nleting, dressing, bathing, walking across\na room, or instrumental activity of daily\nliving (IADL), ie, preparing meals, gro-\ncery shopping, making telephone calls,\ntaking medications, managing money.\nVariables\nThe principal dependent variables were\nthe number of weekly hours of infor-\nmal and formal home care. Respon-\ndents were classified as having re-\nceived informal home care if they\nreceived in-home assistance with any\nADL or IADL in the prior month from\na relative (paid or not), or unpaid non-\nrelative with no organizational affilia-\ntion.11 Formal home care was defined as\nhelp with any ADL or IADL in the prior\nmonth from a paid nonrelative or from\nsomeone affiliated with an organiza-\ntion, whether paid or not.11 Respon-\ndents who did not normally perform an\nIADL, such as shopping, were not clas-\nsifiedashavinganIADLimpairmentnor\nas having received help for that IADL.\nThe number of weekly hours of infor-\nmal and formal home care were calcu-\nlated using the average number of days\nper week (in the prior month), and the\naverage number of hours per day that\nrespondents reported receiving help\nIndependent variables of greatest in-\nterest were gender, living arrangement\n(unmarried and living alone, unmar-\nried and living with others, and cur-\nrently married) and level of disability (2\nvariables indicating the number of cur-\nrent ADL impairments and the number\nthree quarters of unmarried elderly\npeople living with others were residing\nwith either children or grandchildren.\nWe also included the most common\nmedical comorbidities and an indica-\ntor of the presence of dementia (de-\nrived from an administered test of cog-\nnition)16 because these clinical factors\nmay be associated with need for home\ncaresupport.Wecontrolledforotherco-\nvariates previously shown to be associ-\ncluded predisposing and enabling\nfactors:age(continuous),ethnicity,edu-\ncation, and net worth (TABLE 1).\nAnalytic Approach\nBecause a substantial proportion of\nrespondents used no informal or formal\nhome care in the month prior to the\nadministrationofthesurveyandbecause\nthedistributionofhoursamonguserswas\nhighlyskewed,weexaminedcaregiving\nlogistic regression was used to estimate\nthe independent association of gender\nwith any use of informal home care in\nthepriormonthcontrollingforotherfac-\ntors. In the second part, ordinary least\nsquares regression was used to estimate\nthe association of gender with the natu-\nrallogarithmofinformalhomecarehours\nper week for individuals who used any\nservices. The results from both models\nwere combined to calculate adjusted\nmean weekly hours of informal home\ncare for different subgroups of respon-\ndents. We then repeated these analyses\nandcalculationswithformalcareuseand\ntotal care use (formal and informal care\ncombined) as the dependent variable.\nAll analyses were weighted for dif-\nferential probability of selection and ad-\njusted for the complex sampling de-\ntested for significant interactions be-\ntween all covariates and regression di-\nagnostics were performed to check for\nmodel assumptions. All analyses were\nperformed using STATA statistical soft-\nware, Release 6.0 (College Station, Tex).\nRESULTS\nTable1showscharacteristicsofthestudy\npopulation for all variables. About two\nthirds of the study sample were women.\nCompared with men, women reported\nreceiving fewer weekly hours of infor-\nmal care but reported receiving a greater\nnumber of hours of formal care. Women\nwere olderand reported lowernet worth\nthan men. Women were much more\nlikely to be living alone and much less\nlikely to be living with a spouse. Women\nreported more ADL impairments and\nmore chronic medical conditions.\nReceipt of Informal Care\nFIGURE 1 shows the mean weekly hours\nof informal care by gender and living ar-\nrangementafteradjustingforallotherco-\nvariates.

Among all disabled elderly people,\nceived any informal care (P.001) and\nwomen received 28.3 hours of care per\nuser vs 35.6 hours received by men\n(P.001). Among the married dis-\nabled population, 53.8% of women vs\n64.6% of men received any informal\ncare (P.001), and women received\nhours received by men (P.001). In-\nTable 1.

Among those with 1 or 2 ADL\nor IADL impairments 27.2% of women\ninformal care and women received 10.0\nweekly hours vs 19.6 hours received by\nmen (P.001). This gender disparity\nresulted from disabled women receiv-\ning much less spousal care than their\nmale counterparts. For example, 17.4%\nof women vs 40.3% of men received any\ninformal care from a spouse alone\n(P.001) and female receivers of spou-\nsal care on average received 9.8 weekly\nhours vs 18.9 hours received by men\n(P=.003). The gender disparity in in-\nformal care diminished as the level of\ndisability increased, primarily be-\ncause children provided increasing\nnumber of hours of care to their dis-\nabled mothers. For example, among\nthose with 3 to 5 ADL or IADL impair-\nmen received any informal care from\na spouse alone (P=.04). However,\nceived any informal care from chil-\ndren alone (P=.005). These gender dif-\nferences in the involvement of children\nas caregivers were even more marked\nfor elderly people with 6 to 11 impair-\nments.\nIndeed, our results as a whole show\nthat children played a dominant role in\nthe care of disabled women whereas\nwives played the dominant role in the\ncare of disabled men. Among all dis-\nabled women, 44.6% reported receiv-\ning informal care from 1 or more chil-\nchildren were daughters, daughters-in-\nlaw, or granddaughters. By contrast,\nonly 11.1% of disabled women re-\nported any informal care from a spouse\ncompared with 43.8% of disabled men\n(P.001). Children played an impor-\ntant caregiving role even among mar-\nried disabled women since 23.0% re-\nported receiving informal care from 1\nor more children vs 13.2% of married\ndisabled men (P.001). By contrast,\n38.0 % of married disabled women re-\nported receiving any informal care from\ntheir spouse compared with 58.0% of\nThe gender disparity in the receipt of\ninformal home care for married dis-\nabled elderly people was not limited to\nIADL impairments such as shopping or\npreparing meals but rather, it was ob-\nserved consistently across levels of both\nADL and IADL impairments. For in-\npairments received any informal ADL\nTwo factors may explain why hus-\nbands of disabled women play a much\nlesser role in caregiving than wives of\ndisabled men. First, husbands of dis-\nabled women may be less able to pro-\nvide care because they may be older and\nmore disabled than wives of disabled\nmen. Indeed, on average, disabled\nwomen lived with husbands who were\n1 year older; while disabled men lived\nwith wives who were on average 4.6\nyears younger. However, the disabil-\nity level of husbands of disabled women\nwas similar to that of wives of disabled\nmen; 42.4% of the husbands of dis-\nabled women reported 1 or more im-\npairments (mean [SD] number of im-\n[2.7]). To examine whether spousal age\nor spousal disability level influenced the\ngender disparity in home care use\namong married disabled respondents,\nwe performed secondary analyses re-\ngressing spousal home care support on\nrespondent gender, age, and disability\nlevel with and without the addition of\nspousal age and spousal disability level.\nThese analyses showed that spousal dis-\nability, not spousal age, was inversely\nassociated with spousal support but that\nthe gender disparity in weekly hours of\nspousal home care support was un-\nchanged after controlling for these\nspousal factors.\nAnother explanation for the gender\ndifference in informal care in married\nhouseholds is that husbands may be less\nFigure 1.

The prob-\nability of receiving any formal care was\nabout one fifth that of informal care.\nAbout 10% of disabled elderly people re-\nceived some formal care (13.2% women\nhalf received some informal care.

Control-\nling for disability and other factors, dis-\nabled women received about one third\nfewerhoursofcarethantheirmalecoun-\nterparts. This was mainly due to 2 fac-\ntors.First,nearlyhalfofdisabledwomen\nlived alone vs 17% of men, whereas\nnearly three quarters of disabled men\nlivedwithaspouse.Second,marrieddis-\nabledwomenreceivedmanyfewerhours\nof care compared with their married\nmale counterparts.\nMany disabled women lived alone\nwith very limited financial resources\navailable to obtain outside help. Our re-\nof disabled women lived alone and had\nabout 6% of disabled men). This rep-\nresented about 1.3 million women in\nthe United States. A surprising finding\nin our study was that married women\nwith disability received many fewer\nhours of care than their male counter-\nparts. Disabled married women re-\nceived about 80% more informal home\ncare hours than disabled women liv-\ning alone while disabled married men\nreceived about 230% more care than\ndisabled men living alone. Our results\nsuggest that this gender disparity was\nlikely related to sociocultural factors re-\ngarding the caregiving role rather than\nphysical limitations of the husbands of\ndisabled women because husbands and\nwives of disabled married respon-\ndents reported similar levels of impair-\nment. Furthermore, controlling for\nspousal age and spousal impairment did\nnot change the gender disparity in re-\nceipt of home care. The dominance of\nwomen as caregivers for disabled el-\nderly people may be because fewer\nwomen are engaged in paid employ-\nment and because women may more\neasily assume the role of caregiver to a\ndisabled spouse or parent because of\ntraditional social role functioning.3,4,9\nFigure 2.

First, the gender differences\nthat we found might have been mainly\nrelated to IADL support for grocery\nshopping or preparing meals, which is\ntraditionally provided by women, and\nmay have been overreported in the sur-\nvey. We do not believe this to be the case\nbecause the gender difference was con-\nsistently observed across both ADL and\nIADL support categories. Further-\nmore, question formats in the survey\nsought to exclude IADL support unas-\nsociated with a health problem. An-\nother limitation is that our data are for\nonly 1 year. Although the AHEAD sur-\nvey is longitudinal, the subsequent 2\ntionspertainingtohoursofinformalcare\nprovidedbyspouses.Thus,wecouldnot\ninclude these waves in our analyses.\nThe gender difference in the receipt\nof informal care and the role of family\nmembers in the care of disabled elderly\npeople have enormous implications for\nhomecareprogrampoliciesintheUnited\nStates. Biological, social, and organiza-\ntional trends in the United States will\nresult in a marked increase in the num-\nber of elderly people living with disabil-\nity in the community.24 The conse-\nquencesofthesetrendsonthequalityof\nlife of elderly people and their families\ndiffer markedly by gender. Our results\nshow that women and their extended\nfamiliesaremuchmorevulnerabletothe\nconsequences of these trends than men.\nMany more women than men are dis-\nabled, and care may be less available for\ndisabled women because they are much\nmore likely to be living alone with very\nlimited financial resources.
