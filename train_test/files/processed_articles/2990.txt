Besides the quantitative relation-\nship between carbohydrate intake and\nHDL-C concentrations, the quality of the\ncarbohydrate characterized by glycemic\nindex may also affect HDL-C concentra-\ntions. For example, a recent study6 re-\nported that glycemic index was the only\ndietary variable that was associated with\nHDL-C concentrations in a national study\nof the adult population in England.\nThe glycemic index of foods reflects\ntheir tendency to affect postprandial glu-\ncose and insulin concentrations.7 Thus,\ngiven equal amounts of carbohydrate, food\nwith a high glycemic index leads to higher\npostprandial glucose and insulin concen-\ntrations than food with a low glycemic in-\ndex. Although it has been long known that\nfoods affect glucose and insulin concentra-\ntions differently, the clinical significance of\nthe glycemic index remains controversial.8\nCurrent dietary guidelines in the United\nStates do not recommend the use of glyce-\nmic index, although many recommenda-\ntions are generally consistent with the con-\nsumptionoffoodswithalowglycemicindex\nand avoidance of refined foods with a high\nglycemic index.9,10 Examples of foods with\na lower glycemic index include various le-\ngumes, pasta, and minimally refined prod-\nFrom the Division of Nutrition\nand Physical Activity, National\nCenter for Chronic Disease\nPrevention and Health\nPromotion, Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention,\nAtlanta, Ga (Dr Ford);\nand the Division of Preventive\nMedicine, Harvard Medical\nSchool, Boston, Mass (Dr Liu).\n\u00a92001 American Medical Association.

For some participants who were unable\nto attend the examination because of health reasons, a blood\nsamplewasobtainedduringthehomeinterview.Personswho\nattended the morning session were asked to fast for 12 hours\nbefore the session.

Based on pre-\nviouswork,11,14 wedeterminedglycemicindexvaluesforfoods\nreported on the food frequency questionnaire. For example,\nbread, 55% for apple, and 13% for broccoli. In particular, us-\ning the method described by Liu,17,18 we calculated dietary\nglycemicloadbymultiplyingthecarbohydratecontentofeach\nfood by its glycemic index value; this value was then multi-\nplied by the frequency of consumption and summed for all\nfooditems.11 Valuesforthecarbohydratecontentofeachfood\nwere obtained from the US Department of Agriculture food\ncomposition tables.19 We calculated the average glycemic\nindex for each participant by dividing each person's glyce-\nmic load scores by their total daily intake of carbohydrates.\nBecause individual food portion size was not collected in\nNHANES III, we applied standard serving sizes according to\nvalues published in the US Department of Agriculture food\ncomposition tables.19 Previous studies20-22 showed that addi-\ntional queries on portion size for participants provided few\nchanges in participants' ranking according to their relative\nintake of foods and nutrients.\nWe included other variables in the analyses: age, sex,\nrace or ethnicity (white, African American, Mexican Ameri-\ncan, or other), education (years of attendance), smoking\nstatus (current, former, or never), BMI (calculated as weight\nin kilograms divided by the square of height in meters),\nalcoholconsumption(drinkspermonth),leisure-timephysi-\ncal activity, energy fraction from protein and carbohy-\ndrates, and total energy intake. Alcohol consumption was\ndetermined from responses to a food frequency question-\nnaire. For regression models, we created a physical activ-\nity index by summing the products of the frequency of par-\nticipation in 1 of 9 specific activities or up to 4 additional\nself-reported activities by the metabolic equivalent level for\neach reported activity. The energy fraction from protein and\ncarbohydrates and the total energy intake were calculated\nfrom a single 24-hour dietary recall.\nWe limited the analyses to participants 20 years or older\nwho attended the medical examination and included 13907\nformation in our analyses. We treated glycemic index, car-\nbohydrate intake, and glycemic load as either continuous or\ncategorical variables.

To examine\nthe significance of means or percentages of these variables\nby quintiles of glycemic index and glycemic load, we per-\nformed tests for linear trend.

Our results are consistent with\nfindings from a survey conducted by Frost et al6 in a na-\ntional sample of adults in England. They recently re-\nported that glycemic index and HDL-C concentration were\ninversely related among 1420 British participants aged\n18 to 64 years in a cross-sectional study. The percentage\ndecrease in HDL-C concentration among men in their\nstudy was similar to that observed in our study. They\nfound a stronger inverse relationship between glycemic\nindex and HDL-C concentration among women than men,\nhowever. These differences are likely due to differences\nin the demographic compositions of the 2 samples and\nto the use of different dietary instruments.\nBecause our results were derived from a cross-\nsectional study, we cannot conclude that changes in the\nglycemic index and glycemic load can cause changes in\nHDL-C concentrations.

Consequently, we probably underestimated the mag-\nnitude of the decreases in HDL-C concentration with in-\ncreases in glycemic index or glycemic load. We may have\nfailed to account for relevant confounders or incom-\npletely adjusted for selected confounders. Finally, the ap-\nparent association between glycemic index or glycemic\nload and HDL-C concentration may be due to another\nnutrient.\nAlthough it has long been known that diet can affect\ncirculating concentrations of HDL-C, much remains to be\nlearnedabouthowspecificaspectsofdietcanaffectHDL-C\nconcentrations.Thus,therecentresearchthatshowedthat\nthequalityofthedietarycarbohydratecompositioncanaf-\nfectHDL-Cconcentrationsindependentofthequantityof\ncarbohydrateintakesuggestsanewpathwaythroughwhich\nadietwithalowglycemicindexmaylowertheriskofcoro-\nnaryheartdisease.Asummaryofobservationalstudies3found\nthat for every decrease of about 0.026 mmol/L in HDL-C\nconcentration,theriskofcoronaryheartdiseaseincreased\ncrease in the adjusted HDL-C concentration of about 8%\ninmenand2%inwomencouldtheoreticallyreducecoro-\nnary heart disease by about 8% in men and 3.5% in wom-\n1.1millionAmericanswereestimatedtohavehadmyocar-\ndialinfarctionorfatalcoronaryheartdisease.23 Therefore,\nthe potential reductions in coronary heart disease events\nandmortalityduetochangesinHDL-Cconcentrations,such\nas those we found, are not trivial.\nAlthough metabolic studies in patients with diabetes\nmellitus or hyperlipidemia have shown lower total cho-\nlesterol concentrations when carbohydrates with a low gly-\ncemic index are substituted for those with a high glyce-\nmic index, findings on HDL-C concentrations have been\nless consistent.24-28 Therefore, the recent findings in 2 na-\ntional surveys in the United States in the present study and\nEngland6 need to be confirmed by prospective studies or\nclinical metabolic trials of healthy persons. Because of the\nlong-standingcontroversyaboutthepotentialetiologicrole\nof glycemic index in the pathogenesis of several chronic\ndiseases and the short-term nature of metabolic data, data\nfrom large prospective cohorts that directly relate dietary\ncarbohydrates, glycemic index, and glycemic load to the\nsubsequent development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and\ncoronary heart disease will be most informative. In the fi-\nnal analysis, the ultimate criterion by which to judge the\nclinical utility of the glycemic index or that of any other\nclassification schemes of foods is its ability to predict dis-\nease outcomes. If dietary carbohydrate composition influ-\nences HDL-C concentrations, recommendations about the\nbest dietary sources of carbohydrates may need to be re-\nfined.
