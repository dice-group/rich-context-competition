It is under-\nstood that adipose tissue produces and secretes some pro-\ninflammatory factors. Dysregulated production of\nproinflammatory factors, such as tumor necrosis factor-\n(TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), is\nassociated with the pathophysiology of obesity-related\ndisorders.\nPatients with essential hypertension and obesity are at\nincreased risk of type 2 diabetes. Several recent clinical\ntrials have suggested that blockade of the renin\u00adangiotensin\nsystem (RAS) may protect against the development of de\nnovo diabetes in `at risk' patients.1 Evidence shows that\nthe RAS may have a direct role in the pathogenesis of dia-\nbetes. Local RAS was activated in the adipocyte, which\nmakes the adipose tissue the potential target of angiotensin\nII receptor blockers.\nIn this context, the present study was designed to eluci-\ndate the effect of telmisartan, an angiotensin II receptor\nblocker, on the proinflammatory factors' secretion using\n3T3-L1 adipocytes. We hereby show that telmisartan can\ndecrease the proinflammatory factors'secretion from 3T3-\nL1 adipocytes and decrease the adiposity, which may favor\nthe adipocytes with insulin sensitization.\nEffects of telmisartan on lipid metabolisms\nand proinflammatory factors secretion of\ndifferentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes\nChen Kang*, Li Yijun*, Dou Jingtao, Pan Changyu, Yan Wenhua,\nWang Baoan, Ma Fangling, Wang Xianling, Yang Guoqing,\nMu Yiming and Lu Juming\n Keywords\nAngiotensin 11 receptor antagonist, telmisartan, microarray, adipocyte, proinflammatory factor\nDepartment of Endocrinology, PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China\n*These authors contributed equally to the manuscript of this paper.\nCorresponding author:\nDou Jingtao, Department of Endocrinology, PLA General Hospital, 28\nEmail: jingtaodou@sohu.com\nOriginal Article\nMaterials and methods\nCell culture and adipocyte differentiation\n3T3-L1 cells (Shanghai Institute of Life Science of CAS,\nShanghai, China) were cultured and differentiated into adi-\npocytes as described previously.2 Briefly, 3T3-L1 cells\nwere immersed in DMEM plus 10% heat-inactivated FCS\n(10% FCS/DMEM), housed in a humidified incubator set\nand 37\u00b0C. Cells were grown for two days post-\nconfluence (referred to as day 0) in 10% FCS/DMEM.\nDifferentiation was induced with 10% FCS/DMEM con-\ntaining 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX)\n(Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA), 1 \u00b5M dexamethasone (DX)\nand 10 \u00b5g/ml insulin for three days. The cells were then\nincubated in 10% FCS/DMEM with insulin for three days\nand maintained thereafter with 10% FCS/DMEM to day\n12. The medium was changed every other day. After dif-\nferentiation, more than 90% of the adipocytes displayed a\nround shape with a cytoplasm completely filled with mul-\ntiple fat droplets. Only cultures with a differentiation den-\nsity 90% were used in experiments.\nTreatments of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes\nwith various concentrations of telmisartan\nThe experiment was designed for five groups according to\nthe concentrations of telmisartan (Sigma-Aldrich, MO,\nUSA): control group (DMSO), T1 group (0.01 \u00b5g/ml), T2\nml). Telmisartan was dissolved in 100% DMSO at 1 mg/\n\u00b5g/ml and stored at \u00ad20\u00b0C until use. The final concentra-\ntion of DMSO was less than 0.1% and considered to be\nnon-toxic to the differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes.\nOil Red O staining\nThe cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline\n(PBS) twice, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 1 h and then\nstained with 0.6% (w/v) Oil Red O solution (60% isopro-\npanol, 40% water) for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were\nthen washed with water to remove unbound dye. Stained\nOil Red O was eluted with isopropanol and quantified by\nmeasuring the optical absorbance at 550 nm.\nProinflammatory factors and free fatty acids\nassay of cultural medium\nThe concentrations of proinflammatory factors TNF- and\nIL-6 were measured using a commercially available\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for rat\n(Rapidbio, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's\nprotocol. Each sample was measured in duplicate with a\nmicroplate reader and expressed as means \u00b1 SEM. The\nvalues of free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations were\nobtained by enzymatic assay on an automatic analyzer.3\nCellular 2-[18F]-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake\nmeasurements\nUptake measurements were performed in 3T3-L1 mature\nadipocytes treated with 0.1% DMSO (control) and various\nconcentrations of telmisartan for three days by adding 370\nNuclear Medicine Department of Chinese PLA General\nHospital, Beijing, China) to the culture of cells and incu-\nbating in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2\nTime course experiments showed that 18F-FDG uptake in\n3T3-L1 adipocytes reached a relative plateau after 25 min\nincubation (data not shown). Hence, the remaining 18F-\nFDG uptake experiments were performed with 25-min\nincubation, when the adherent cells were washed twice\nwith PBS and then lysed in 1 ml distilled water before the\nradioactive counts were measured on a high-energy\n-counter (Wallac). 18F-FDG uptake levels of each sample\nwere corrected for protein content as determined by the\nBradford method and expressed as percentage of uptake\nrelative to that of the control cells.\nHigh throughput gene expression profiling by\nmicroarray\nIn order to detect the possible genes involved in the effects\nof telmisartan on the 3T3-L1 adipocytes, a cDNA microar-\nray analysis was performed for the chosen two groups:\ncontrol group and T2 group (telmisartan 0.1\u00b5g/ml). The\ncontrol and telmisartan-treated groups were treated with 1\nml Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, MD, USA). RNA isolation\nand quality were checked by spectrophotometry. All pro-\ncedures of the hybridization experiments of oligonucleo-\ntide microarray analysis (CapitalBio 36k Mouse Genome\nArray) were conducted by CapitalBio Corp. (Beijing,\n70-mer oligo probes from Mouse Genome Version 4.0 of\nOperon (http://www.operon.com), representing approxi-\nGenome. The housekeeping genes ACTB, GAPD, LDHA\nand RPL5 were printed as internal positive controls of\nhybridization. The results were analyzed with LuxScan 3.0\nand the KEGG and BioCarta genome databases retrieved\nwith CapitalBio Molecule Annotation System 4.0 software\nfor pathway analysis.4\nQuantitative real time polymerase chain\nreaction\nParts of the differential expressed genes screened by\nthe microarray were verified by quantitative real time\npolymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). The control and tel-\nmisartan treated group (0.1 \u00b5g/ml) were treated with 1 ml\nTrizol reagent (Invitrogen, MD, USA). RNA isolation and\nquality were checked by spectrophotometry.

Statistical signifi-\ncance was assessed by one way analysis of variance\n(ANOVA) and the ANOVA post-hoc Bonferroni test with\nnificant. All experiments (except microarray) were per-\nformed more than three times and similar results were\nobserved every time.\nResults\nTelmisartan reduced fat drop and lipid storage\nTo explore the potential effect of telmisartan on the lipid\npocytes were differentiated with standard differentiation\ninducers. During day 12 to 16 of differetiation, telmisartan\nwas added to the media every day. As shown in Figure 1,\nhigher doses of telmisartan (T2, T3 and T4 groups) reduced\nfat drop and lipid storage of the differentiated 3T3-L1 cells\nin a dose-dependent manner, while a lower dose (T1 group)\ndid not (Figure 1).\nEffect of telmisartan on secretions of the\nTo examine a potential impact of telmisartan on the FFAs\nand proinflammatory factors secreted from the differenti-\nated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, an assay of the culture levels of\nIL-6 and TNF was performed. After differentiation of\n3T3-L1 cells (day 12), the cells were incubated with vehi-\ncle (DMSO) and 0.1 \u00b5g/ml (T2) and 1 \u00b5g/ml (T3) of tel-\nmisartan for 12 h. Then the levels of the proinflammatory\nfactors and FFAs in the cultural solution were measured.\nCompared with the control, the higher dose (T3) of tel-\nmisartan decreased the levels of IL-6 and TNF and\nincreased those of FFAs. The lower dose (T2) of telmisar-\ntan reduced the levels of IL-6 and had no significant effects\non the levels of TNF and FFAs (Figure 2).\nEffect of telmisartan on 18F-FDG transport in\nTo examine the potential impact of telmisartan on glucose\ntransport in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, an 18F-FDG\n(2-DG) uptake assay was performed. Exposure of differen-\ntiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes to telmisartan resulted in a sig-\nnificant enhancement in 18F-FDG uptake in a\ndose-dependent manner (Figure 3). In the absence of insu-\nlin, treatment with 1 and 10 \u00b5g/ml telmisartan for 72 h\nResult from microarray study and Q-PCR\nTo determine which gene might be involved in the adi-\nposity, we used 3T3-L1 adipocytes from the control and\ntelmisartan (0.1 \u00b5g/ml) groups for microarray analysis.\nOne hundred and fifty-seven genes differentially\nexpressed between the groups were found from the\nmicroarray. These genes were involved in transport, cell\nadhesion and signal transduction of the adipocytes; pre-\nliminary analyses of these gene functions and their rela-\ntionship were performed (unpublished). In the present\nstudy, we focused on analyzing the gene expression pro-\nfile related to the processes of lipometabolism and the\nsecretion of proinflammatory factors from the differenti-\nated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. By retrieving the KEGG and\nBioCarta database, we propose that some cell signaling\npathways involved in the secretion process of adipocy-\ntokines and proinflammatory factors were affected by\ntelmisartan. The significant pathways affected by tel-\nmisartan are listed in ascending order of p-values (and\nmultiple-comparison corrected Q-value)5 in Table 1.\nAccording to the pathway analysis, the mitogen-activated\nprotein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was signifi-\ncantly different. The analysis revealed nine differentially\nexpressed genes involved in the MAPK signaling path-\nway (Table 2). Moreover, the result also showed that\nNos3 and CPT1 (Table 3), which encode the endothelial\nnitric oxide synthase and carnitine palmitoyl transferase\n1A respectively, were up-regulated. Consistent results\nwere obtained by the Q-PCR with Nos3, CPT1 and the\nthree select genes, which are Fos, Prkcc and Fgf22, from\nthe MAPK signaling pathway (Table 3).\nDiscussion\nWe have demonstrated that telmisartan reduced the lipid\nstorage and increased the 18F-FDG uptake in differentiated\n3T3-L1 adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner. At the\nsame time, telmisartan reduced the levels of IL-6 and\nTNF and increased that of FFAs in the culture medium.\nMicroarray analysis revealed that the MAPK signaling\npathway and oxidative stress were implicated in the secre-\ntion of proinflammatory factor and lipometabolisms and\nwere affected by telmisartan. Regulation of Nos3 and\nCPT1 expression by telmisartan, which was detected by\nthe microarray, may also be the underlying cause of the\nimprovement in the lipometabolisms.\nCurrently, more than 50 different adipokines are recog-\nnized. The adipokines are implicated in a wide range of\nphysiological processes, including appetite and energy bal-\nance, glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, blood pres-\nsure regulation, hemostasis and angiogenesis. IL-6 and\nTNF are two of the inflammation-related proteins whose\ncirculating levels are increased during obesity and are\ndirectly linked to inflammation and inflammatory\nFigure 1.

Adipose\ntissue is one of the main origins of IL-6 and TNF.7 In addi-\ntion, RAS components, including angiotensin II receptor,\nexist in the adipocyte, which makes the adipose tissue a\npotential target of angiotensin II receptor blockers.\nNumerous clinical studies in subjects with a variety of car-\ndiovascular conditions have shown that blockade of the\nrenin\u00adangiotensin system demonstrates suppression of pro-\ninflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF.8\u00ad10 Our\nstudy showed that telmisartan reduced the levels of IL-6\nand TNF, which suggests that the direct effect of telmisar-\ntan on adipocyte secretion is one of the causes of the sup-\npression of IL-6 and TNF in vivo. In addition, the\nFigure 3.Relative 18F-FDG uptake levels in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. 18F-FDG uptake was measured in the absence (a) or\npresence (b) of 1 \u00b5M insulin.

These effects were mediated through\nthe Ang II AT2 receptor, but not Ang II type 1 receptor.11\nAs one of the Ang II AT1 receptor blockers, the action of\ntelmisartan on adipocyte may be independent of the Ang II\nAT1 or AT2 receptor. We also demonstrate that telmisartan\ndose-dependently augments 18F-FDG uptake both in the\nbasal and in the insulin-stimulated state of 3T3-L1 adipo-\ncytes. These data are consistent with a previous report,\nwhich speculated that telmisartan induces glucose trans-\nporter type 4 (GLUT4) expression and subsequent glucose\nuptake via peroxisome proliferator activated receptor \nTable 1.

Some\ninvestigators hold the view that reduction of body weight\nis associated with reduction of food intake and a down-\nregulation of orexigenic peptides after AT1-blockage.17,18\nOthers presume that it is a direct effect of angiotensin\nreceptor blockers (ARBs) on the lipid metabolisms in the\nliver and/or the adipose tissue.19 In the present study, we\nobserved the effect of telmisartan on the lipid metabolisms\nof differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and provided evidence\nthat the telmisartan has direct impact on the adipocytes,\nreduces lipid storage and increases FFA secretion from the\ncells. Thereafter the possible mechanisms were explored\nby the microarray, which showed that telmisartan affected\nthe MAPK signaling pathway and gene expressions of\nNos3 and CPT1 during the reduction of lipid storage.\nLocal endothelial nitric oxide synthetase can increase the\nnitric oxide synthesis of adipocytes and also regulates\nenergy metabolism via influencing mitochondrial biogen-\nesis20 and lipolysis.21 Carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A is\nthe key regulatory enzyme of the long-chain fatty acid\nenzyme of -oxidation. Recent studies suggest that a mod-\nerate increase in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A activity\nis sufficient to substantially reduce hepatic triglyceride\nlevels. Overexpression of CPT1 increased the rate of\n-oxidation and was accompanied by a significant reduc-\ntion in triglyceride accumulation by hepatocytes which\nhave potential benefits in the treatment of fatty liver.22 In\nadipocytes, it is known that increasing the expression of\nCPT1 can also enhance the fatty acid oxidation.23\nAbuissa et al.,1 in a meta-analysis of 12 recent rand-\nomized controlled clinical trials that enrolled patients\nwith hypertension, chronic heart failure or coronary heart\ndisease, showed that angiotensin-converting enzyme\n(ACE) inhibitors and ARBs produced a highly significant\n25% reduction in the incidence of new-onset diabetes\nwhen compared with placebo, diuretics, beta-blockers or\ncalcium channel antagonists. However, these mechanisms\nare not fully understood. Our experiment suggests that the\nadipocyte is one of the major targets for telmisartan, and\nthe actions of reducing proinflammatory factors from\nadipocyte, increasing glucose uptake and decreasing the\nlipid content of adipocytes may enhance the beneficial\nmetabolic effects of telmisartan. Collectively, the present\nfindings of our experiments indicate that telmisartan may\nbe involved in regulation of adipose mass and secretion of\nadipocytes. Local effects of telmisartan on the adipocytes\ncould thus be expected to change the factors known to\nregulate adipocyte metabolism. Additional studies will be\nnecessary to determine whether there are similar effects of\ntelmisartan on regulation of lipid metabolisms and proin-\nflammatory factors secretion in vivo.\nConclusions\nTelmisartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, affected\nlipometabolisms and the proinflammatory factors secreted\nfrom adipocytes. Our research revealed that Nos3, CPT1\nand the MAPK pathway affected by telmisartan may be\nthe underlying cause of the improvement in the lipid\nmetabolisms and proinflammatory factors affecting the\nsecretion of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science\nReferences\n1.
