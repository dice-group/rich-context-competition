One set of data came\nfrom the Andhra Pradesh Children and Parents\nStudy (APCAPS), a community-based trial of\nnutritional supplementation integrated with other\npublic health programs and its follow-up surveys.\nThe trial was conducted during the period of 1987\nto 1990 under India's Integrated Child Develop-\nment Services (ICDS), which is a national pro-\ngram of providing free supplemental nutrition,\npreschool education, health checkups and refer-\nral, immunization, and nutrition and health edu-\ncation to pregnant women and young children\nFirst, 2 adjacent subdistricts--one each as\nintervention and control areas--near the city of\nHyderabad in the state of Andhra Pradesh (now in\nTelangana) were selected for the study. Then,\nwithin each subdistrict, a group of villages around\na village centrally located in the subdistrict was\nincluded in the trial--resulting in 15 intervention\nand 14 control villages. Under the ICDS, a\nbalanced protein\u00adcalorie supplement, made from\nlocally available corn\u00adsoya ingredients called\n\"upma,\" was offered daily over a period of 3 years\nto pregnant women and children below 6 years of\nage living in 15 intervention villages. The\nintervention was delayed in 14 control villages\nand introduced after the trial ended. Access to\nother public health programs, such as primary\nhealthcare, child immunization, and anemia\ncontrol in pregnancy by providing iron and\nfolic acid tablets, were similar in intervention\nand control villages. A short abstract describ-\ning the trial was published, but no other docu-\nments are available.35\nChildren born during the original trial period\nveys have been used to examine the association\nbetween exposure to the nutritional supplement\nand adolescent height, lean body mass, muscle\nstrength, cardiovascular health, and educational\nsupplement by participants during the original\ntrial is not available. As a result, exposure to the\nsupplement has been measured as intention to\ntreat, that is, birth in an intervention village dur-\ning the trial period, in these studies.\nFor the current study, we used data from the\ncohort. Among the 8246 children born since the\nbeginning of the trial, 11.5% had died before the\nfollow-up survey. Of the surviving children, 2601\nwere born during the trial period and are therefore\neligible for follow-up. Among them, 654 inter-\nvention and 511 control group children with his-\ntorical records participated in the survey (801 and\nWe used retrospective data on breastfeeding col-\nsurvey, when the children were 13 to 18 years\n(see Table 1). Breastfeeding initiation was nearly\nuniversal (99.4% of children), and the median\nreported duration of any breastfeeding was 24\nmonths (standard deviation [SD] \u00bc 14.2). Infor-\nmation on the exclusivity of breastfeeding was\nnot collected by the survey, which asked only for\nthe number of months before introducing solid\nfood (with no details on the type of food). Self-\nreported data on whether currently enrolled in\nschool, highest schooling grade completed, and\nscores on the most recent test at school for each\n13- to 18-year-old study participant were\nWe used Stata version 14 (StataCorp LLC) for\nanalysis and considered P < .05 statistically sig-\nnificant.

Other covariates were household caste\n(scheduled caste or scheduled tribe, other back-\nward class), religion (Hindu or other), household\nstandard of living--measured by the quintiles of a\ncomposite wealth index20,39--indicators of edu-\ncation of the father and mother (literate, com-\npleted primary, or completed secondary or\nabove, in comparison with illiterate), and child's\nage, sex (whether female), and birth order.\nBecause preterm birth may adversely affect the\nfuture educational outcomes of a child,40,41 we\nincluded an indicator of premature birth among\nour covariates.\nThere are large gaps in child human capital\ninvestment and outcomes in India between boys\nand girls. Boys are breastfed at a higher rate and\nfor a longer duration than girls.42 To capture the\nsex-specific association between breastfeeding\nand future outcomes, we included an interaction\nbetween sex and breastfeeding duration in our\nmodel. Finally, in order to capture any links\nbetween the nutrition trial and breastfeeding\nduration, we included an indicator of whether the\nchild was born in an intervention village among\nthe covariates. We clustered standard errors of all\nregression models at the village level.\nAnalysis of IHDS\nWe further examined the link between breast-\nfeeding and educational outcomes in the nation-\nally representative India Human Development\nTable 1.

Self-reported infor-\nmation on educational attainment in years, based\non standard national schooling curriculum, was\navailable for all matched children (6 to 12 years\nold in IHDS-2). For children aged 8 to 11 years in\nIHDS-2, the survey administered standardized\ntests in reading, writing, and mathematics. Chil-\ndren were given a choice of the test language (1 of\n13 languages). The reading test, involving a short\nstory, was scored on the following scale: can't\nread \u00bc 0, letter \u00bc 1, word \u00bc 2, paragraph \u00bc 2,\nand story \u00bc 4. The writing test was scored as\nfollows: cannot write \u00bc 0, writes with 2 or less\nmistakes \u00bc 1, and writes with no mistakes \u00bc 2.\nThe mathematics test, involving calculations, was\nscored as follows: cannot recognize number \u00bc 0,\nnumber \u00bc 1, subtraction \u00bc 2, and division \u00bc 3.\nThese tests were very similar to those used in\nother internationally recognized surveys of ado-\nlescent children, including the Pratham Founda-\ntion's Annual Status of Education Report surveys\nBreastfeeding initiation was nearly universal\n(99%) among children who could be matched\nbetween the 2 rounds.

However, information on child feed-\ning during the 24 hours preceding the survey--as\nper the WHO standard for gathering data on\nbreastfeeding exclusivity--was not collected.\nSummary statistics of the APCAPS and IHDS\nsamples are shown in Table 2.\nUsing the IHDS-2 data, we employed ordered\nprobit regression models to examine the associa-\ntion between breastfeeding duration and later life\noutcomes: (1) educational attainment in years and\n(2) test scores (only for 8- to 11-year-old chil-\ndren) in reading, writing, and mathematics. We\nobtained the main explanatory variables--\nmonths of breastfeeding and months before intro-\nducing liquids and solid food--from the IHDS\nsurvey. Other covariates (from IHDS-2) included\nage and sex of the child (whether female),\nwhether the child was underweight (as perceived\nby the mother), interaction between sex of the\nchild and breastfeeding duration, household size,\nand indicators of caste (scheduled caste, sched-\nuled tribe, or other backward class) and religion\n(Muslim or Christian, in comparison with Hindu).\nWe captured the standard of living of the house-\nhold by quintiles of monthly per capita household\nexpenditure (in Indian rupees). We adjusted for\nstate indicators in all regression models and clus-\ntered the standard errors at the state level.\nAdditional Analyses Using Categorized\nValues of Breastfeeding Duration\nFigure 1 shows the kernel density distributions of\nduration of breastfeeding in APCAPS and IHDS\ndata, respectively. In both, reported breastfeeding\nduration was significantly clustered around the\nmonths). The clustering was more pronounced in\nthe APCAPS data, possibly because of recall\nerror arising from the long gap between the\nfeeding data were collected from their mothers.\nThe measurement error in breastfeeding dura-\ntion could widen the CIs of the estimated rela-\ntionship between breastfeeding duration and child\noutcomes. We improved precision by replacing\nthe breastfeeding duration in months with cate-\ngorized values in additional regression models. In\none set of models, we used a binary indicator of\nabove-median duration (as compared with at or\nbelow median) instead of duration in months. In\nanother set of models, we categorized the breast-\nfeeding duration in APCAPS into the following\ngroups: (1) up to 12 months of breastfeeding, (2)\nmore than 12 but less than 24 months of breast-\nmonths of breastfeeding, and (4) over 36\nmonths of breastfeeding. In IHDS, we categor-\nized breastfeeding duration into the following\ngroups: (1) up to 6 months of breastfeeding, (2)\nmore than 6 but less than 12 months of breast-\nbreastfeeding, and (4) over 24 months of\nbreastfeeding. We included indicators of each\ncategory in the regression models (using the\nlowest category as the comparison group)\ninstead of the duration in months. This\napproach ignored a child's exact location,\nwhich may be imprecise, on the breastfeeding\nduration distribution.\nTable 2.

There were no other signifi-\ncant associations.\nDiscussion\nWe examined the association between the dura-\ntion of breastfeeding of Indian children and their\nfuture educational outcomes. We mitigated pos-\nsible measurement errors by dividing breastfeed-\ning duration into 2 or 4 categories. In APCAPS\ndata, >36 months of breastfeeding was associated\npositively with test scores. In IHDS-2 data, above\nbreastfeeding were associated with more years\nof educational attainment. Breastfeeding dura-\nwere also associated with very small (less than\none-seventh of an SD), and therefore negligible,\nreductions in mathematics test scores in IHDS-2.\nBoys received greater educational benefits\nthan girls in both data sets. When conducting\nregressions separately by sex, above-median\nduration of breastfeeding was associated with\nhigher test scores for boys in APCAPS. In\nIHDS-2 data, above-median breastfeeding was\nassociated with more years of education but lower\nwriting scores for girls. However, the reduction in\nwriting score was equivalent to about one-\nseventh of an SD and is therefore negligible.\nLonger breastfeeding duration has been asso-\nciated with improved educational outcomes in a\nfew other countries. A study using long-term data\nNew Zealand found that those breastfed for at\nleast 8 months postbirth were 62% more likely\nto complete schooling and had standardized test\nyear-old Irish children found that breastfeeding\npoints higher reading and mathematics scores.46\nA longitudinal study of 1739 men and women\nborn in 1946 in England, Wales, and Scotland\nfound that breastfeeding duration was positively\nassociated with educational attainment by age 26\nand the ability to read 2 additional words on the\nAnother study followed 2094 children born in\nthat those breastfed for 9 or more months in child-\nhood attained 0.5 to 0.8 more grades of schooling\nthan those breastfed for less than 1 month.48 A\nfollow-on study that revisited the cohort when the\nparticipants were 30 years old reported that\nbreastfeeding for at least 12 months was associ-\nated with 0.9 more years of education relative to\nthose breastfed for less than 1 month.49\nOur finding of a sex difference in educational\noutcomes associated with breastfeeding is consis-\ntent with the findings of previous studies of\nbreastfeeding patterns in India. A recent study\nestimated that mothers on average breastfed\ndaughters for 0.9 fewer months than they did\nsons.42 Another study showed not only that girls\nwere breastfed for 0.45 fewer months than boys\nbut also that the amounts of breast milk and other\nlower, respectively.50 Health and educational\nresources such as vaccinations and nutrition are\nalso provided more to boys.51-53 The sex differ-\nence in the intensity of breastfeeding may explain\nthe stronger positive association between breast-\nfeeding and educational outcomes among boys in\nour data.\nPossible explanations on the differences in\nfindings from the APCAPS and IHDS data sets\nand also between our study and the previous lit-\nerature include lengthy recall periods (in\nAPCAPS) and differences in the methods of col-\nlecting breastfeeding data.\nWe first address recall periods. In the\nAPCAPS survey, historical data on breastfeed-\ning during early childhood of 13- to 18-year-old\nchildren were collected from their mothers.\ncal data on breastfeeding of children born since\nthe year 2000. As a result, reported breastfeed-\ning duration data were highly clustered around\ncertain values. The measurement error likely\nattenuated our regression estimates, especially\nin case of the APCAPS data, in which recall\nperiods are long.\nIn additional analyses, we examined the asso-\nciation between breastfeeding duration and out-\ncomes separately for children who were between\n6 and 9 years old in the IHDS-2 data. The recall\nperiod for breastfeeding was shorter for these\nyounger children, yet the estimated links between\nbreastfeeding and outcomes from these regres-\nsion models were not statistically significant.\nAs shown in Table 1, both APCAPS and IHDS\nsurveys deviated significantly from the WHO\nguidelines for collecting breastfeeding data.\nAlthough the questions related to whether chil-\ndren were ever breastfed and total duration (in\nmonths) of breastfeeding were the same, there\nwere significant differences in how data on exclu-\nsive breastfeeding were collected. In particular,\nneither APCAPS nor IHDS included detailed\nquestions on breastfeeding and liquids or food\ngiven the day before the survey. As a result, the\nnature and quantity of liquids and solid food\ngiven to children are unknown. The duration of\nexclusive breastfeeding in these data cannot be\nreliably compared with international standards.\nAs discussed earlier, the background characteris-\ntics of the APCAPS and IHDS samples were also\ndifferent. India Human Development Survey pre-\nsents an average estimated relationship between\nbreastfeeding duration and education across the\ncountry, which could be considerably different\nfrom the local findings of APCAPS.\nAlthough we incorporate in our analysis child\ncharacteristics such as sex, birth order, and the\nincidence of premature or underweight birth,\nwhich could all affect the duration of breastfeed-\ning, there may be confounding effects from resi-\ndual unobserved factors. Attrition between\nconsecutive rounds of data may be selective and\ndistort our findings. For example, IHDS-2 house-\nholds that cannot be matched with IHDS data\nhave higher per capita monthly expenditures than\nhouseholds that can be matched, and their chil-\ndren are breastfed for 1.2 fewer months. Also, a\nmother may selectively breastfeed certain chil-\ndren more based on their or her own unobserved\ncharacteristics. For example, Indian mothers with\nhigher levels of financial autonomy in the house-\nhold or those who receive more prenatal care are\nlikely to breastfeed at a higher rate,54,55 whereas\nSri Lankan children who are born by cesarean\ndelivery are initiated to breastfeeding late.56\nInformation on maternal IQ, which might\naffect children's cognition, was also unavail-\nable in our data.\nIn addition, if mothers who breastfeed for lon-\nger durations also provide additional educational\nresources to their children, any estimated positive\nassociation between breastfeeding duration and\nacademic outcomes will be inflated. This may\naffect a child's future healthcare and education\nresources, such as availability of vaccinations,\nschool quality, and public versus private school-\ning, and could play a role in a child's decision to\nwithdraw from school--all of which could affect\neducational outcomes. The socioeconomic and\neducational environment surrounding a child also\nmay change over time, thereby affecting the rela-\ntionship between breastfeeding in early life and\nfuture academic outcomes. Because of a lack of\ndata, these unobserved factors are beyond the\nscope of our analysis.\nFinally, the underlying mechanisms through\nwhich cognition or IQ may be related to educa-\ntional achievements in India have been studied\ninadequately. As a result, our findings are limited\nin providing a theoretical understanding of the\nrelationship between breastfeeding and academic\noutcomes.\nConclusion\nLonger breastfeeding duration, in addition to hav-\ning well-established positive health benefits, has\nbeen associated with improved longer-term cog-\nnitive and educational outcomes in a few country\ncase studies. Using long-term data from a\nregional trial and a nationally representative\nhousehold survey, we found small positive asso-\nciations between breastfeeding duration and a\nfew educational outcomes for adolescent males\nbut not females in India. However, household\nsurveys that collected data on breastfeeding in\nIndia have not always followed the WHO guide-\nlines. Although our findings suggest the potential\nimportance of breastfeeding promotion as a pol-\nicy tool for improving future educational out-\ncomes, further research using higher-quality\nbreastfeeding duration data is necessary.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest\nwith respect to the research, authorship, and/or publi-\ncation of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following finan-\ncial support for the research, authorship, and/or publi-\ncation of this article: This study was funded by the Bill\n& Melinda Gates Foundation, which provided a grant\nto the University of Virginia.
