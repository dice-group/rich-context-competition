Cox proportional hazards, discrete-time\nhazards and competing risk regression models were conducted (N = 16,573 participants, n = 4207 deaths,\nResults: Age, sex and poverty income ratio-adjusted hazard rates were higher among Non-Hispanic Blacks\n(NHBs) vs. Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). Within the above-poverty young men stratum where this association\nwas the strongest, the socio-demographic-adjusted HR = 2.59, p < 0.001 was only partially attenuated by SES\nand other factors (full model HR = 2.08, p = 0.003). Income, education, diet quality, allostatic load and self-rated\nhealth, were among key mediators explaining NHB vs. NHW disparity in mortality. The Hispanic paradox was\nobserved consistently among women above poverty (young and old). NHBs had higher CVD-related mortality\nrisk compared to NHW which was explained by factors beyond SES. Those factors did not explain excess risk\nfactors explained the lower risk of neoplasm-related death among MA compared to NHW, while CVD-related\nmortality risk became lower among MA compared to NHW upon multivariate adjustment.\nConclusions: In sum, racial/ethnic disparities in all-cause and cause-specific mortality (particularly cardiovascular and\nneoplasms) were partly explained by socio-demographic, SES, health-related and dietary factors, and differentially by\nage, sex and poverty strata.\n",

We further evaluated the putative\nmediating effects of SES, lifestyle, social support and\nhealth-related factors in the association between race and\nall-cause mortality risk and examined cause-of-death\nstructure across racial and ethnic groups.\nMethods\nStudy population\nThe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) con-\nsample design, providing national estimates of health and\nnutritional status of the civilian non-institutionalized\npopulation [13]. Using questionnaire, physical examin-\nation and laboratory data from NHANES III, we retained\nethnicity as NHW, NHB or MA, thus excluding other eth-\nnicities. This yielded a final sample of 18,110 participants,\nof whom N = 16,573 were retained upon multiple imputa-\ntions for descriptive statistics and N = 15,889 for survival\ncompliant with the ethical rules for human experimenta-\ntion stated in the Declaration of Helsinki, including ap-\nproval of an institutional review board and informed\nwritten consent. The current study was approved by the\nOffice of Human Subjects Research Protections, National\nInstitutes of Health.\nMortality outcome\nThe NCHS conducted a mortality linkage for NHANES\nIII with the National Death Index (NDI), allowing inves-\ntion to mortality rates at follow-up through December\neligibility status, assigned vital status, mortality source,\nperson-months of follow-up from interview date and\nfrom Mobile Examination Center (MEC)/home exam\ndate, and the underlying or multiple causes of death\n[14]. We defined an event as death from any cause, start-\ning from the MEC examination date and ending on or\nunderlying causes: \"Major cardiovascular disease\" (Inter-\nnational Classification of Diseases, 10th version, (ICD-10)\nD50-D64), \"Diabetes\" as an underlying/contributing cause\nICD-10 codes) [14]. \"Other causes\" were sub-divided\ninto: \"infections and respiratory (A..-B.. and J.. codes),\n\"gastrointestinal (GI), Kidney and urological\" (K.. and\nN.. codes), \"Neurological disease\" (G.. codes), uninten-\ntional/intentional injuries (V..-Y..) and \"others\" (all other\ncodes). This detailed subdivision of causes (8 groups) was\nused only in part of the analysis whereby the cause of\ndeath structure (proportionate mortality) was compared\nbetween the three major race/ethnicity groups. In the\nmain analysis of survival data, only deaths from major car-\ndiovascular disease and neoplasms were examined.\nMain predictors\nIn the selected sample, race/ethnicity was coded as\nNHW, NHB and MA. Two dummy variables were cre-\nated to contrast NHB and MA with NHW.\nExogenous variables\nIn the final models, exogenous variables were the variables\nthat were allowed to predict both potential mediators and\nthe final outcome. Those included continuous age (y),\nsex, marital status (1 = Never married, 2 = Married, 3 =\nDivorced, 4 = Widowed, 5 = Other), household size and\nurban-rural residence (1 = Urban, 2 = Rural).\nPotential mediators\nSocio-economic status\nSocio-economic status was measured alternatively by\ncontinuous poverty income ratio, education (years) and\nhealth insurance status (1 = yes, 0 = no).\nLifestyle and social support factors\nSeveral factors were included in our models as mediators\nthat could be directly affected by socio-economic status.\nThose include the latent constructs of \"substance abuse\",\n\"nutritional factors\", \"physical activity\", \"smoking\" and\n\"social support\". Substance abuse was operationalized\nas \"alcohol consumption (g/d)\" and drug use (1 = Ever,\n0 = never); \"nutritional factors\" as 1995-Healthy Eating\nmean adequacy ratio score (MAR), [16\u00ad18] (Additional\nfile 1); \"Physical activity\" as 3 related items: Item 1:\n\"Compare activity for past month to past yr (0 = less, 1 =\nsame, 2 = more), item 2: \"Active compared with men/\nwomen your age\" (0 = less, 1 = same, 2 = more), item 3:\n\"Active now compared with self, 10 year ago\" (0 = less, 1 =\nsame, 2 = more); \"Smoking\" with two items: Item 1: \"num-\nber of cigarettes smoked per day\" (0 among non-smokers);\nitem 2: \"years smoked cigarettes\" (0 among non-smokers);\nsocial support with 5 items namely, (1) \"In a typical week,\nhow many times do you talk on the telephone with family,\nfriends, or neighbors?\", (2) \"How often do you get together\nwith friends or relatives; I mean things like going out to-\ngether or visiting in each other's homes? (per year)\", (3)\n\"About how often do you visit with any of your other\nneighbors, either in their homes or in your own? (per\nyear)\", (4) \"How often do you attend church or religious\nservices? (per year)\", (5)\"Altogether, how often do you at-\ntend meetings of the clubs or organizations (per year)\".\nHealth-related factors\nThe construct of \"Health\" was operationalized with self-\nrated health, co-morbidity index and the allostatic load\n(AL) score. Participants self-rated their health as: \"Excel-\nlent\" (referent), \"Very good\", \"Good\", \"Fair\" or \"Poor\",\nwhile the co-morbidity index consisted of total sum score\nof 14 possible self-reported conditions, namely \"arthritis\",\n\"congestive heart failure\", \"stroke\", \"asthma\", \"chronic\nbronchitis\", \"emphysema\", \"hay fever\", \"cataracts\", \"goiter\",\n\"thyroid disease\", \"lupus\", \"gout\", \"skin cancer\", \"other\ncancer\". The allostatic load total score (0-9) is composed\nof 9 items which are described in details in Additional file\nStatistical analysis\nUsing Stata 14.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX), [20]\nanalyses accounted for survey design complexity [14], by\nincorporating sampling weights, primary sampling units\nand strata. Multivariate imputed data [21, 22] was used\nto estimate means and proportions across race/ethnic\ngroups, as well as various measures of associations in-\ncluding odds ratios and linear regression coefficients,\nafter adjusting for sampling design complexity with sur-\nvey (svy) commands. Comparison across race/ethnicity\ngroups were made using svy:reg and svy:mlogit com-\nmands with race/ethnicity dummy variables as the only\npredictors. Standard errors were estimated using Taylor\nseries linearization [14]. Comparison between race\ngroups (NHB vs. NHW and MA vs. NHW) in terms of\ncause-of-death structure was done among all deaths in\nthe selected sample, comparing proportions of each\ncause by use of a logistic regression model that took into\naccount design complexity and multiple imputations.\nDefining time-to-event from any age  20y since base-\nline visit (i.e. delayed entry) until death or censoring, we\nconducted Cox proportional hazards models for all-\ncause mortality stratifying by age group, sex and poverty\nstatus as well as competing risk regression models for\ncause-specific mortality. The time of follow-up is\nexpressed in months. A series of nested models account-\ning for sampling weights were carried out and using the\nimputed data, in which socio-demographic, SES, lifestyle,\nsocial support and health-related factors were entered\nconsecutively. The mediating effect of each of those fac-\ntors was tested more thoroughly in a separate analysis\nusing discrete-time survival analysis within a structural\nequations modeling (SEM) framework that accounted\nfor sampling weights, though using the original un-\nimputed data. This was suggested as the optimal method\nto examine causal mediation within the context of sur-\nvival analysis [12]. In this generalized SEM model, the\nfinal outcome was the hazard rate of death from all-\ncauses and the data structure is person-period rather\nthan participant-level data. The mortality outcome Y\n(0 = alive, 1 = dead of any cause or specific cause) was\nmodeled using discrete-time survival with a logit link,\nby adding 18 dummy variables for year of follow-up as\nthe main predictors for risk of death in the person-\nperiod modified data. Race/ethnicity was the primary\nexposure with two contrasts (NH black vs. NH whites;\nMA vs. NH white). A series of generalized SEM models\nwere conducted, in which alternative mediators \"M\" were\nincluded, one at a time. Those mediators could be\ngrouped under SES, substance abuse, diet, PA, smoking,\nsocial support and health. The generalized SEM models\nincluded covariates (age, sex, marital status, household\nsize and urban/rural area of residence) that were exogen-\nous to the system along with the race contrast variable.\nDirect and indirect effects of race were estimated from\nwhich the mediation proportion, a non-linear combination\nof the two, was also estimated using the delta method. Of\nparticular interest were MP > 10 %, indicating an appre-\nciable proportion of a total effect mediated by \"M\" [23].\nType I error was set at 0.05 in all other analyses.\nResult\nStudy sample characteristics by race/ethnicity group\nWeighted proportions of NHW, NHB and MA were\n~83 %, 12 % and 5 %, respectively. Compared to NHW,\nNHB and MA participants were younger on average\nthan NHW with the reverse being true for MA. Mean\nPIR was lower among NHB and MA vs. NHW (2.02 and\nfor poverty status and education(y). NHB and MA had a\nhigher likelihood of urban residence and a larger mean\nhousehold size compared to NHW, with marked racial/\nethnic difference in marital status. Lack of health insur-\nance was more common in MA (21.1 %) and NHB\n(9.3 %) vs. NHW (6.1 %), with both NHBs and MA being\nless likely to rate their health as \"Excellent\". Conversely,\nboth mean daily use and years of cigarette used were\nhigher in NHWs, who were nonetheless more physically\nactive than NHBs and MA, based on an item comparing\nactivity to age peers. Drug ever use was highest among\nest prevalence was among MA (29.4 %). While alcohol\nconsumption did not differ between race groups, both\n1995-HEI and MAR indicated poorer overall dietary\nquality among NHB compared to NHW. With only one\nexception (clubs and organizations), NHB had more so-\ncial support from family, friends, neighbors and church,\ncompared to NHW; with the reverse being true for MA.\nSelf-reported co-morbidity was highest among NHW\nand lowest in MA. In contrast, total AL score based on\nobjective measures of metabolic and inflammatory dis-\nturbance markers was higher among NHB than NHW,\nwith no disparity detected between MA and NHW.\nExamining individual components of the AL, NHB had\nspecifically a poorer profile in terms of albumin, CRP,\nglycated hemoglobin, resting heart rate and blood pres-\nsure levels compared to NHW (Table 1).\nCause of death structure by race/ethnicity\ncardiovascular disease or a neoplasm, with another 9 %\nhaving diabetes as the main contributing factor. Infec-\ntious diseases accounted for 13.1 % of deaths, while\nneurological, digestive/kidney and injuries accounted for\n2\u00ad3 % of deaths each. The remaining causes, labelled as\n\"Other\" accounted for ~9.6 % of deaths, overall. Compar-\ning NHW to NHB, NHB were more likely to have died\nfrom digestive/kidney disease than NHW and less likely to\nhave died from neurological disease. When comparing\nMA to NHW, diabetes, digestive/kidney disease, injuries\nand \"Other\" were more common causes of deaths among\nMA. The reverse was true for CVD and neurological\ndisease (Fig. 1).\nRace/ethnicity and all-cause adult mortality: moderation\nby sex, age group and poverty status\nSmoothed all-cause hazard curves by race/ethnicity (ad-\njusted for age, sex and poverty income ratio) were consist-\nently higher among NHBs compared to NHWs and\nnoted between MA and NHW in that model (Fig. 2).\nUsing Cox PH models (Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5), higher\nall-cause mortality among NHBs vs. NHWs was specific\nto younger men above poverty (Model 0, Table 2: Crude\nLoge\nciation that remained significant after adjustment for\nage, marital status, urban-rural area of residence and\nhousehold size (Model 1, Table 2). In Model 2 of\nTable 3, adjusting further for SES factors (i.e. PIR,\neducation and insurance status), the race/ethnicity as-\nsociations with all-cause mortality among younger men\nabove poverty was attenuated to Loge\ning a similar effect of race on all-cause mortality in that\ngroup (Table 5, model 8).\nA lower all-cause mortality rate in MA compared with\nNHW observed in several age group/sex/poverty strata\nwas retained in the full model only among women above\npoverty (young and old), (Table 5, Model 8). In the\ncrude model (Model 0, Table 2), a lower risk of all-cause\nmortality was found among MA compared to NHW,\nspecifically among men below poverty (both age groups)\nas well as older women(both poverty status groups). Ad-\njustment for age and socio-demographic factors attenu-\nated the effect appreciably in all these strata. Further\nadjustment for SES factors, however, pronounced the\ndisparity among women above poverty (both young and\nold), an effect that was attenuated upon adjustment for\ndietary factors (Model 4, Table 3) as well as in subsequent\nmodels. This effect was then markedly pronounced in the\nfinal model, particularly among younger women above\nmortality risk among MA compared with NHW was\nunveiled upon adjustment for age and other socio-\ndemographic factors, specifically among younger men\nabove poverty (Loge\nhowever, was completely explained away by SES factors\nRace/ethnicity and all-cause mortality: individual mediators\nin the total adult population\nAdditional file 1: Tables S1 and S2 show a series of gen-\neralized SEM models with the outcome being discrete-\ntime hazard of all-cause death, with the main exposure\nbeing race/ethnicity, and individual mediators (M) being\nentered alternatively to explain the total effect of race on\nhazard rate. Among key findings, PIR, education, dietary\nquality indices, AL and self-rated health, were all key\nmediators in the pathway linking race to mortality when\ncomparing NHB to NHW (MP > 10 %). When contrast-\ning hazard rates between MA and NHW, the total effect\nwas not indicative of any racial disparities. Social sup-\nport factors, drug and alcohol use, as well as insurance\nstatus did not act as mediators.\nRace/ethnicity and cause-specific mortality\nTable 6 presents findings from competing risk regression\nmodels.

In addition, socio-economic sta-\ntus and other factors can act in mediating racial dispar-\nities in all-cause mortality [31, 32]. In a recent study,\nKrueger and colleagues used 1990 National Health Inter-\nview data involving 38,891 US adults and found distinct\nmediating effects of socioeconomic status, smoking status,\nphysical activity, perceived stress, sleep duration and alco-\nhol consumption on the relationship between race and all-\nHealth and Retirement Study found distinct mediating ef-\nfects of socioeconomic status, health behaviors and health\ninsurance as mediators of the race disparities in all-cause\nmortality rates [32].\nWe find that NHBs had a higher rate of CVD mortal-\nity compared to NHWs, which is in accord with previ-\nous investigations [25, 33].

Racial/Ethnic differences in neoplasm-related\nmortality can result from a combination of factors includ-\ning smoking, nutrition, access to preventive, diagnostic,\ntherapeutic, screening services and aggressiveness of treat-\nment [38]. Modifying those factors could potentially pre-\nvent over half of cancer deaths and eliminate most racial/\nethnic disparities [38]. Specifically, racial differences in\nbreast cancer survival prevailed even after controlling for\ndisease stage and known tumor characteristics, reflecting\nthe potential mediating effects of social determinants\nbeyond the biological, genetic and environmental factors,\nincluding the barriers of poverty (e.g. lack of a primary\ncare physician, geographical access to care, competing sur-\nvival priorities, burden of comorbidities, health insurance\nstatus, lack of information and knowledge, risk-promoting\nlifestyles and provider/system-level factors), culture (spir-\nituality, perceived susceptibility to breast cancer, cultural\nbeliefs and attitudes, and medical mistrust) and social in-\njustice (racial prejudice and injustice) [24]. Menashe et al.\nindicated that the rate of decline in breast cancer mortality\nwas slower among NH black women compared to White\nwomen, while age-specific incidence rate in black women\nwas lower among blacks. Thus, the widening disparity in\nbreast cancer mortality could not be explained by a higher\nTable 5 Cox PH of race/ethnicity vs. all-cause mortality: further adjustment for health-related factors: full model a, NHANES III\nModel 8: Model 7 further adjusted for health-related factors: Full modelb\nLoge\nAbbreviation: CI Confidence Interval, exp exponent, HR Hazard Ratio, LCL Lower confidence limit, Loge\nNatural logarithm, MA Mexican-American, NHANES National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Surveys, NHB Non-Hispanic Black, NHW Non-Hispanic White, PIR Poverty Income Ratio, SE Standard error, UCL Upper\nconfidence limit\naValues are the natural log of hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % CI with p-values, taking into account unequal probability of selection or sampling weights.

However, those mediating effects\nof poverty and segregation varied widely across US cities\ndiagnosed elderly individuals with diabetes increased by\n36.9 %, overall with Hispanics having the greatest\nincrease at 55 % [40]. Our study indicated that MA had\nindeed a greater share of deaths attributed to diabetes\ncompared to NHWs.\nThe Hispanic paradox, a consistently observed\nphenomenon, [9] occurs when mortality rates, specif-\nically cardiovascular [6] and smoking-related mortality\n[5] among US Hispanics is similar or lower to NHWs'\nrates, despite lower SES among Hispanics. Hunt et al.\nreported the age and sex-adjusted HR for all-cause\nmortality of US-born MAs vs. NHWs as 1.66 (95 % CI\nation\" in young MA may be a multifactorial covariate\nthat is inadequately represented in large study sets\nsuch as NHANES III, which is sampling for a \"para-\ndoxically healthy\" new immigrant population, rather\nthan a truly representative sample of young Mexicans\nas a whole [42]. Generally, mortality rate differences\nbetween MA and NHW are greater among older age\ngroups. Suggested mechanisms behind this paradox\ninclude less acculturation to the US resulting in better\nhealth, healthy migrant bias, and death records' misre-\nporting of ethnicity or missing records upon return to\ncountry of origin (\"salmon bias\") [43]. Previous studies\nshow that diet was healthier and smoking level was\nlower among Hispanics compared to non-Hispanics,\nwhich may partly explain their lower mortality rates\n[7, 8]. These findings are not universal, with studies in\nthe apparent paradox. Our findings support the Hispanic\nparadox mainly for cardiovascular mortality, which con-\ncurs with a recent meta-analysis [6]. It has been suggested\nthat increased fruit and legume consumption among this\ngroup may have a protective effect [6]. Country of birth\nmay be an important consideration; data from the San\nAntonio Heart Study show that diabetic MAs born in the\nUS have higher rates of CVD mortality, compared to\nNHWs, while risk for CVD mortality was similar between\ndiabetic US-born MAs and NHWs [41]. The findings also\nsupport the perplexing disassociation of several common\nrisk factors with cardiovascular disease mortality in US\nHispanic populations. MAs in our study had both lower\nincome and a lower mean education years, when com-\npared with NHWs. They also had a higher waist-hip-\nratio and glycated hemoglobin levels, as well as lower\naccess to health insurance. In contrast, MA were less\nlikely to smoke and had a comparable diet quality to\nNHW. Smoking behavior differentials have accounted\nfor >50 % life expectancy variability between Hispanics\nand non-Hispanics at age 50y [7]. Acculturation may\ninfluence our findings as only 51 % of MA in our sample\nwere US-born.\nTable 6 Competing risk regression, age, sex and PIR-adjusted\nvs. full models for direct effect of race on mortality from major\ncauses, NHANES IIIa\nLoge\nCardiovascular mortality\nAge, sex, PIR-adjusted modelb\nFull modelc\nNeoplasms\nAge, sex, PIR-adjusted modelb\nFull modelc\nAbbreviation: CI Confidence Interval, HEI Healthy Eating Index, HR Hazard Ratio,\nMA Mexican-American, MAR mean adequacy ratio, NHANES National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Surveys, NHB Non-Hispanic Black, NHW Non-Hispanic\nWhite, PIR Poverty Income Ratio\naValues are the natural log of hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % CI with p-values,\ntaking into account unequal probability of selection or sampling weights.\nStatistical significance is inferred from a 95 % CI not crossing the value of zero\nbThe age, sex and PIR adjusted model is presented here to be contrasted with\nthe full model\ncThe full model adjusted for the same vector of covariates as in Model 8\n(Table 5).

First, to our knowledge,\nit among few nationally representative studies testing\nassociations between race/ethnicity and all-cause and\ncause-specific mortality in the adult US population by\nsystematically examining effects within sex, age and\npoverty status and investigating potential mediators for\nall-cause and cause-specific mortality. Second, its large\nsample size allowed testing associations with mortality\nfrom homogeneous groups of causes. Competing risk,\nselection bias, missing data, unequal probability of sam-\npling and design complexity were all addressed in our\nanalyses. Some limitations include residual confounding,\nmeasurement error in covariates, particularly self-reported\npotential mediators (e.g. co-morbid conditions), and mis-\nclassification error of underlying and contributing causes\nof death.\nConclusion\nIn sum, racial/ethnic disparities in all-cause and cause-\nspecific mortality (particularly cardiovascular and neo-\nplasms) were partly explained by socio-demographic,\nSES, health-related and dietary factors, and differentially\nby age, sex and poverty strata. More studies are needed to\nuncover neighborhood-level and individual-level psycho-\nsocial factors mediating the effect of racial disparities on\nall-cause and cause-specific mortality among US adults.\nAdditional file\nAdditional file 1: Table S1.
