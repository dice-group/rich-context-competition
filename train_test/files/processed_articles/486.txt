Prior to the 1990s, the study of human exposure to chemicals\nin the environment mainly focused on understanding intakes of\ndifferent chemicals through characterization of exposure media\nconcentrations and exposure contact rates.1 Regional and national\npopulation surveys to determine the presence of chemicals in\nthe body gave exposure assessors another, arguably more\npowerful, measure of exposure and internal dose. In these\ngeneral population surveys, chemicals measured in blood tend\nto be those which are persistent in the environment and in the\nbody, and the measurements typically represent the accumula-\ntion of the chemical over many years of exposure. Other\nchemicals are measured in urine, and they represent a different\npattern both in persistence and exposure. These contaminants\ntend not to persist in the body, with half-lives on the order of\ndays and hours, and are primarily excreted in urine. Exposure\nmight be associated with identifiable events, as might be the\ncase with the detection of pesticide metabolites in urine after\npesticide application, or exposure might be ubiquitous and less\nunderstood. Such is the case with phthalates and bisphenol\nA (BPA).\nAlthough detection of phthalate metabolites and BPA in urine\nprove that exposure occurs, the measurement of urinary\nmetabolites does not provide information on route of exposure,\nor the rate of overall intake which resulted in the measured\nconcentrations. However, many studies have developed estimates\nof daily intakes from the urinary concentrations of phthalate\nmetabolites and BPA in spot samples, mainly using what is termed\nthe ``creatinine-correction'' approach. This method takes advan-\ntage of the common practice of measuring creatinine, along with\nthe target compounds, in a spot sample. Although measurement\nof creatinine is primarily done to normalize concentrations across\nindividuals (i.e., to avoid issues which occur because urine\nvolumes are a function of hydration and can result in high or\nlow concentrations not reflective of chemical excretion), a\ncreatinine-adjusted concentration in urine (mass of chemical\ndivided by mass of creatinine) is also used to estimate daily intake.\nThis simple back-calculation method takes advantage of relation-\nships between a spot sample excretion of creatinine and total\ndaily creatinine excretions. Assuming consistent daily intakes of a\n1United States Environmental Protection Agency, National Center for Environmental Assessment, Office of Research and Development, Washington, District of Columbia, USA;\n2Institute for Prevention and Occupational Medicine of the German Social Accident Insurance, Institute of the Ruhr-University Bochum (IPA), Bochum, Germany;\n3Umweltbundesamt (Federal Environment Agency), Berlin, Germany; 4National Exposure Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development, United States Environmental\nProtection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA. 1.

A critical assumption in\nthis approach is that the creatinine-adjusted concentration of a\ncontaminant in a spot urine sample is equal to the contaminant\ndaily average concentration in urine. However, given their\nfirst-order kinetics with half-lives in the order of hours (B5 h to\n12 h2--4), peak concentrations of DEHP metabolites and BPA occur\nin urine shortly after exposure, with decreasing concentrations\nseveral hours after exposure.2,5,6 These peak concentrations could\nbe mistaken to imply high daily exposures when using the\ncreatinine-correction approach, and conversely, the lower con-\ncentrations could be mistaken for low daily exposures. Ideally, one\nwould like full day (24 h) average concentrations to use in a\ncreatinine-correction model, but such data are rarely available for\nlarge population surveys.\nFor compounds with short half-lives (on the order of hours), the\nvariability in concentrations seen in a population of 24-h samples\nfrom a specific group of individuals will inevitably be less than the\nvariability seen in a population comprised of all the individual urine\nsamples from that same population. However, most surveys only\ntake a single sample during a day, and consequently may miss\nsome of the high concentrations that would be seen in their\nsample population if they sampled all urine events over the course\nof a day (or longer) from those individuals. The purpose of this\nstudy is to evaluate the comparability of spot urinary concentra-\ntions of phthalate metabolites and/or BPA obtained from a specific\npopulation, with the 24-h average urinary concentrations of these\ncompounds obtained from a comparable population. If the two\ndistributions are reasonably comparable, then one can use the\ncreatinine approach for studying the distribution of intakes within\na population with an acceptable degree of certainty, at least with\nregard to the urine-concentration term. Spot and long-term (24-h\nand 48-h) sample sets analyzed for phthalate metabolites and BPA\nwere retrieved for this examination. Measures of central tendency\nand spread were examined within these populations. Additionally,\nstatistical tests were applied to paired spot and long-term data sets\nto determine whether the two data sets could have come from the\nsame distribution.\nStudy Descriptions\nCharacteristics of the data sets used in this study are summarized in\nTable 1, with further details provided in the Supplementary Material. Three\nGerman data sets using spot urine samples included surveys of 45 adults in\nin Bavaria (the latter data have not been published, but a description of the\nlarger study of measurements from 1005 individuals from which a subset\nof 102 were analyzed for phthalate metabolites can be found in Kutting\net al.)10 To compare with these data sets was a set of 712 students, aged\nEnvironmental Specimen Bank of the Federal Environmental Agency of\nGermany. A description of this database and a summary of partial results\ncan be found in Wittassek et al.11 and the website for the Environmental\nSpecimen Bank: http://www.umweltprobenbank.de/en/documents. All\nurine samples from these German data sets were analyzed for di-2-\nethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) metabolites: mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate\n(MEHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), and mono-\n(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP); for the mono-ester metabolite\nof di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP); for the\nmono-ester metabolite of di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP), mono-isobutyl\nphthalate (MiBP); and for the mono-ester metabolite of butylbenzyl\nphthalate (BBzP), mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP). In the spot sample data\nsets from Bochum and Erlangen, values below the limit of detection\n(LOD) were substituted with zero. In the spot sample data set from\nBavaria and the 24-h urine data set from the Environmental Specimen\nBank, values below the limit of quantification (LOQ) were substituted\nwith LOQ/O2.\nA data set from Atlanta, Georgia in the United States included eight\nadults, four women, and four men aged 25--59 years of age, who provided\na complete set of urine spot samples (n \u00bc 427) over a consecutive 7-day\nperiod in 2005.12 Each sample was analyzed for the DEHP metabolites,\nMEHP and MEHHP as well as for BPA, and 24-h concentrations were\nconstructed from the spot sample concentrations. First morning voids,\ndefined as the first urination event after 0500 hours, were culled from the\nfull set of spot samples. To compare with the urinary concentrations of all\nspot samples, first morning void spot samples, and 24-h samples from the\nExamination Survey (NHANES) data on these metabolites for adults\ntiming of the Atlanta study. NHANES participants provided urine samples\nthroughout the day (rather than first morning voids), and phthalate\nmetabolite concentrations are available for a random 1/3 sample of\nparticipants. In both the Atlanta data set and the NHANES, values below\nthe LOD were substituted with LOD/O2.\nBPA urinary concentrations in 48-h samples were determined as part of\nthe Children's Total (Aggregate) Exposure to Persistent Pesticides and\nOther Persistent Organic Pollutants (CTEPP) study.13 For the present study,\nwe used a subset of CTEPP 48-h urine samples collected during a 2-day\nchildren from Ohio and 29 from North Carolina. The 48-h samples (one per\nchild), constructed by pooling six spot samples (3 each day, from the\nmorning, afternoon, and evening), were analyzed for total (free plus\nconjugated) BPA. To compare with this BPA data set, we retrieved the\nand age range were chosen for comparability to the CTEPP study, given\nmeasurements are only available for participants aged Z6 years. Values\nbelow the LOD were substituted with LOD/O2.\nAll studies contained concentrations reported either on a volume basis\n(ng/ml) or a creatinine-adjusted basis (ng contaminant/mg creatinine). We\nconducted all of our analyses on volume-based concentrations. Although\nhydration certainly affects dilution and volume-based concentrations, and\ncreatinine-based concentrations are thought to address issues with\nhydration, creatinine-based concentrations themselves may not account\nfor differences in race and nationality. The Supplementary Material\ncontains an exercise showing that the variability in volume-based\nconcentrations is similar to that of creatinine-based concentrations, using\nthe DEHP-metabolite data from the Atlanta and NHANES data sets.\nProtocols for these studies were reviewed for human subject\nconsiderations within the institutions, which conducted the studies, and\nall raw data used in this study were deidentified.\nStatistical Methods\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SAS/STAT software, Version\n9.2. The distributions of all of these population data sets were characterized\nby calculating measures of central tendency (geometric mean (GM),\nmedian) as well as spread (geometric standard deviation (GSD), inter-\nquartile range) and extreme values (95th percentile, maximum). For\nNHANES only, weighted statistics were derived using weights supplied by\nthe National Center for Health Statistics. For the CTEPP data, there was one\noutlier, a child with a BPA-urine concentration 4200ng/ml. Because this\nvalue was many times greater than the next highest value (39ng/ml), we\ntreated this result as an outlier and did not use it in the statistical analyses.\nFurther statistical tests were used to evaluate the comparability\nbetween concentrations derived from a population of spot samples and\nconcentrations derived from a comparable population of 24-h samples (i.e.,\nthose that might be obtained from the same population). It should be\nnoted that such testing is most appropriate for the Atlanta data set,\nbecause the spot samples and the 24-h samples came from the same\nparticipants, over the same time period. In contrast, it is less meaningful to\ncompare any of the concentrations derived from the German spot sample\ndata sets with the concentrations derived from the German 24-h samples,\nVariability of phthalate, BPA concentrations\nChristensen et al\nbecause they represent different people: the general adult population\nversus 20- to 29-year-old students, from different parts of Germany,\ndifferent collection years, different time of day for sampling, and most\nimportantly, different exposure patterns. Despite these limitations, these\ntests give additional insight as to whether the distributions are similarly\nshaped, so we compared the results using German 24-h samples with each\nof the German spot samples, the Atlanta 24-h samples with the Atlanta\nspot samples, and the CTEPP BPA 48-h data set with NHANES data on BPA.\nUrine concentrations for each metabolite were log base 10 transformed\nbefore performing these tests, in order to more closely approximate\nnormality; we also include results from these tests with no transformation\napplied, in the Supplementary Material. As the distributions of phthalate\nmetabolite concentrations in urine may not meet normality assumptions\n(especially given limited sample sizes) even after appropriate transforma-\ntion, we compared distributions using non-parametric methods. The\nequality of the distributions was compared using the Cramer-von Mises\ncriterion, and the variances of the distributions were compared using\nLevene's test. The Cramer-von Mises criterion compares two empirical\ndistributions by ranking the values in the two distributions separately, then\nin combination, and comparing the resulting rank orders --- subsequently,\nvalues closer to zero indicate less difference (more similarly shaped\ndistributions). It is considered more robust than other methods (such as\nthe Kolmogorov--Smirnov test), when differences in location are expected.\nLevene's test assesses equality of variance between two sample sets, using\nthe squared deviation of values from the group means. As Levene's test\ngives information about the equality of the spread of the distribution\nwithout assuming similar central tendencies, it is likely the most\ninformative and appropriate test for use in comparing the German 24-h\nsamples with the German spot samples and the BPA data sets. As noted\nabove, the differences in the populations and exposure patterns in the\nGerman data may lead to differences in measures of central tendency, but\nit is possible to assess whether the distributions from each population have\na similar degree of variability.\nFor the Atlanta data set, we also created a series of bootstrap data sets\nfrom the Atlanta spot sample data. This was done by randomly selecting\none spot sample per person per day, for a total of 56 values; this process\nsample per person per day (i.e. 56 samples in each). To characterize the\noverall results from this bootstrap sample, the median values of the\nstatistical measures calculated for each of the 1000 data sets were\ncalculated and presented. The purpose of constructing the bootstrapped\ndata sets is primarily to assess the right tail (high-end) of a distribution of\nspot samples when one obtains only one sample per person per day. If one\nsamples all daily urine events for a given population, such as the 427 spot\nsamples of the Atlanta data set, one sees the full extent of the right tail. On\nthe other hand, if each individual provided one sample per day at random\ntimes, the shape of the distribution and in particular, the characterization\nof the right tail is unknown, but likely would be different than the right tail\nof the full sample set of 427 spot samples. The bootstrap attempts to\ncharacterize this difference between all samples versus one sample taken\nat random times during a day. However, given the limited sample size and\nskewed nature of the data, the estimation of upper percentiles (such as the\n95th) is challenging.14 In looking at urinary metabolite concentrations in\nthe general population, there is generally a long right tail --- that is, most of\nthe data are clustered in the lower range and there are a few persons with\nmuch larger values --- which may lead to bias in bootstrap estimation of\nthe upper percentiles. To address this issue, we estimate the 95th\npercentile in the bootstrapped samples using both the empirical\ndistribution function with averaging (the most widely used method, and\nthe default option in SAS) and the weighted average (i.e. linear\ninterpolation between ranked values).15 This weighted average approach\nshould provide a more robust estimate for comparison.\nTable 1.

The results of the statistical tests comparing pairs of studies\nare displayed in Table 2. Additional results are included in tables in\nthe Supplementary Materials.\nGerman Data on Phthalate Metabolites\nFigures 1 and 2 depict the distribution of the measured phthalate\nmetabolite concentrations for the four German populations (three\nspot sample and one 24-h data set). Adults from the Bochum\nstudy showed the lowest concentrations and those from Erlangen,\nthe highest. The difference in central tendency measurements of\nthe six phthalate metabolites between these two populations\nranged from a factor of about 5 to almost 20. However, although\nthe results show different central tendencies, and correspondingly\nhigher 95th percentile and maximum values, the GSDs for all\npopulations and metabolites seem to vary narrowly from less than\nthe GM to well within a factor of 2 above the GM. The 25th\npercentile of all four data sets was about half the median and the\n75th percentile was about twice the median. The 95th percentile\nwas B3 to 6 times the median. The 24-h concentration data for the\nDEHP metabolites had spread comparable to the spot samples, but\nthe 24-h concentration data had the most spread for MnBP, MiBP,\nand MBzP, including the highest maxima. For example, the\ntwice as high as the highest maximum value found in the spot\nsamples: 1256 ng/ml from the Erlangen samples. We believe it's\npossible that a contributing factor to 24-h samples showing equal\nand maybe higher spread than the spot samples is the much larger\nsample size (n \u00bc 712) of the 24-h data set compared with the spot\nsample data sets (all n o100). Another contributing factor would\nphthalate use would change and contribute to their variable\nexposure patterns. The spot samples, in contrast, all took place in a\nTable 2 shows the statistical measures comparing the distribu-\ntion of concentrations from 24-h samples to the distribution of\nconcentrations from the three sets of spot samples. In nearly all\ncases, the Cramer-von Mises criterion was quite close to zero\nthe distributions. When comparing variance, there were a few\ngroups for which Levene's test indicated significantly different\nvariance: between the 24-h samples and the Bavaria spot samples\n(all but MBzP) and between the 24-h samples and the Erlangen\nspot samples for two DEHP metabolites (MEOHP, MEHHP). These\npatterns are reflected in the descriptive statistics --- for example,\nthe maximum concentrations for MEOHP and MEHHP were much\nhigher in the Erlangen data compared with the 24-h data.\nUS Data on DEHP Metabolites\nFigure 3 depicts the distribution of the two measured DEHP-\nmetabolite concentrations for the NHANES and four permutations\nof the Atlanta data set. The central tendency measures of median\nand GM for these data sets were very similar, unlike the German\ndata. Four of the data sets are permutations from the same study,\nand thus it is expected that their measures of central tendency\nwould be similar, but the similarity with the national NHANES data\ndoes suggest that this focused data set characterized exposures\nthat, at least for their central tendency, were similar to national\ntendencies. However, unlike the German data, there was generally\na greater amount of variability when comparing the concentra-\ntions from all spot samples, to the 24-h averages.\nThe rank order from most to least variable is as follows: NHANES\n4all spot samples 4bootstrap spot samples 4first morning voids\n424-h samples. NHANES had the highest maximum, about 4 to 10\ntimes higher than the maximum from the Atlanta spot samples.\nAt least one reason for this disparity between NHANES and the\nAtlanta data sets is sample size: over 1600 adults each supplying a\nFigure 1. Box plots of DEHP metabolites from four German surveys (median and 95th percentiles displayed on graphs).\nVariability of phthalate, BPA concentrations\nChristensen et al\nspot sample for NHANES, compared with only eight individuals in\nthe Atlanta data. Although these eight individuals supplied 427\nspot samples, they still represent lifestyles and exposure patterns\nof only eight individuals, all living in one city.\nWithin the four groupings of the Atlanta data set, the variability\nin concentrations from the 24-h samples and the first morning\nvoid spot samples were comparable, and both lower than the\nvariability in the other two groupings (all spot samples and\nbootstrap spot samples). The maximum for the 24-h and first\nmorning voids were 2 to 4 times lower than the maxima for the\nother two permutations.\nIt is interesting that although the 95th percentile values for the\n24-h and NHANES data sets were virtually identical, the maximum\nfor NHANES was over an order of magnitude higher than the\nmaximum of the 24-h samples. Again, this is likely owing to the\nmuch larger sample size of NHANES, as well as different\ndistribution of sampling times (and fasting protocols) in the\nNHANES. But it does highlight an intuitive expectation: a 24-h\nsample will dampen the high as well as low concentrations that\narise from spot samples from phthalates and related contaminants\nfor which exposure is frequent and almost a daily event, and\nelimination of metabolites in urine is in the order of hours. The\nhighest concentrations are near the time of exposure and low\nconcentrations are found many hours after exposure. But when\nassessors have a large database such as NHANES, with which to\nstudy exposures, the important question remains: do adults at the\nhigh end of the concentration distribution in NHANES experience\na much higher daily exposure than might be implied had all of\nthem supplied 24-h instead of spot samples?\nPossibly the best comparison we can make to answer this\nquestion is the comparison between bootstrapped spot samples\nand 24-h samples from the Atlanta cohort. Here the comparison is\nbetween a 24-h sample and a random sample taken from the\nsame person on same day. Proportionately, the ratio of the GSD\nto the GM is about twice as high for the bootstrapped as\ncompared with the 24-h samples. The 95th percentile for the\nbootstrapped sample metabolite concentrations is about 15--20%\nhigher than the 95th percentile for the 24-h samples (using a\nweighted average to estimate the 95th percentile in the\nbootstrapped samples), and the maxima are about twice as high\nfor the bootstraps as compared with the 24-h samples. All of these\nmeasures suggest that the high-end of a population of spot\nsamples tends to be higher than that of a population of 24-h\nsamples.\nFigure 2. Box plots of MBzP, MnBP, and MiBP from four German surveys (median and 95th percentiles displayed on graphs).\nFigure 3. Box plots of DEHP-metabolites, MEHP and MEHHP, from US surveys including four from the Atlanta survey (all spot, bootstrapped\nspot, first morning void, and constructed 24 h) and NHANES (median and 95th percentiles displayed on graphs).\nVariability of phthalate, BPA concentrations\nChristensen et al\nA comparison between the bootstrapped data and all 427 spot\nsamples from Atlanta also show trends of note. In general, the\nmeasures of central tendency (GM, median) and spread (GSD,\ninterquartile range) of the bootstrapped samples were similar to\nthe full set of 427, from which the bootstrap was derived, but the\nmaximum was much lower. This finding is logical --- when\nrandomly selecting from each day, invariably all of the 1000\nbootstrap data sets of 56 daily spot samples will miss several of\nthe high concentrations that are incorporated into the analysis of\nFor the statistical tests of distribution comparability, similar\nresults to the comparison of German 24-h and spot samples were\nfound for the Atlanta data (Table 2). Of all the data sets used, the\nAtlanta data set is the only one with 24-h and spot samples from\nthe same individuals; thus, it is more appropriate to test whether\nthe spot samples are from the same distribution as the 24-h\nvalues. The Cramer-von Mises criterion was close to zero for all\noverall shape of the distributions. Levene's test indicated different\nvariance for MEHHP 24-h and spot samples (P-value \u00bc 0.008), but\nborderline similarity in variance for MEHP (P-value \u00bc 0.06).\nWe also evaluated the distribution of MEHHP and MEHP urinary\nconcentrations on a creatinine-corrected basis (results in Supple-\nmentary Material). The results were quite similar to those found\nusing a volume basis in magnitude and variability, so that the\noverall patterns were preserved when comparing across data sets.\nFor example, the GM for MEHP ranged from 2.96 (NHANES) to 6.44\n(Atlanta 24-h) mg/g creatinine; the GM for the spot and boot-\ncreatinine, respectively) and for each data set the GSD was\nsimilar in magnitude to the GM. Also, similar to results using a\nFigure 4.

This could be the result of the demographic\ndifferences in the two data sets -- the NHANES captured a\nnational sample of 6--11 year olds whereas the CTEPP study\ntargeted a non-random selection of 2--5 year-olds in NC and OH.\nThe 48-h samples had a very similar GSD compared with the\nThe NHANES data had a somewhat higher maximum value\n38.6 ng/ml for NC and OH, respectively).\nSummary\nSome dissimilar trends emerged from the US and German data\nsets and their long-term and spot samples. The 24-h DEHP data\nfrom the Atlanta data set show a narrower spread than the\ncorresponding spot samples. There, the spot samples showed\nvariability that was dampened when averaging over 24-h periods.\nIn contrast, the German 24-h phthalate metabolite concentrations\nshowed a much wider range and variability as compared with the\nGerman spot samples from different individuals and locations. The\nUS BPA data are more similar to the German data, in that they\nshow a spread and variability that appears quite comparable with\nthe spot samples. Reflecting the similarity in the amount of spread\nand measures of central tendency for these BPA data sets,\nstatistical tests indicated no significant differences between the\nCTEPP data and the NHANES data when comparing distributions\nin terms of overall shape, or variance (Table 2).\nResearchers have used spot sample surveys to infer daily intakes\nof key contaminants. As discussed earlier, simple methods to\nbackcalculate daily intakes from spot samples rely on the\nassumption that the spot sample concentration is a good\nsurrogate for the 24-h average concentration. The ideal data set\nto examine this question would be one which includes a large\nnumber of individuals who provided a 24-h sample as well as a\nspot sample randomly taken on the day of the 24-h sample. We\nfound one data set that had this feature, but it included only eight\nindividuals, so any generalizations or conclusions from these data\nmust be made cautiously. We believe a sample size much larger\nthan eight would be necessary to capture different patterns of\nexposure. How ``large'' such a sample size is obviously an issue of\nwould be even better. If each of the 712 individuals in the German\ndata set provided a spot sample during the day in which the 24-h\nsample was provided, then a fairly rigorous analysis could be\ndone. Without this luxury, we sought several diverse individual\ndata sets including spot samples and 24- or 48-h samples\nincluding different contaminants (phthalates and BPA) and\ndifferent age groups (children to adults).\nBesides our analysis, there are three published studies that\nlooked at the differences between urinary concentrations of\nphthalates and other non-persistent contaminants in spot and\n24-h samples. Frederiksen et al.16 examined the volume-based\n(not creatinine-based) concentrations of phthalate metabolites in\nhealthy Danish children (n \u00bc 103, 6--16 years of age) and young\nadults (n \u00bc 26, 17--21 years of age). They measured metabolites of\nDEP, DBP, BBzP, DEHP, and DiNP. The highest concentrations of all\nphthalate metabolites were in the 1st morning urine sample, and\non a mass basis, between 40% and 48% of daily excretions were\nfound in this first morning sample. The 2nd morning voids were\nalso higher than the 24-h averages, but by a lesser amount than\nthe 1st morning voids. Although not obtaining other spot sample\ndata, it can be surmised that, for this population, the morning\nsamples captured the daily high concentrations for phthalates.\nLi et al.17 evaluated the variability in urinary concentrations of\nmono-hydroxy polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OH-PAHs) on\nthe same group of eight persons and 427 samples from the\nAtlanta data set studied here for BPA and DEHP metabolites.\nAmong the 427 samples, they looked at the concentration of OH-\nPAHs in the population of first morning voids (n \u00bc 56), constructed\nthe first morning voids had the highest concentrations, with GMs\nand medians roughly 1.2 and 1.5 times higher than analogous\nmetrics for constructed 24-h samples. Interestingly, however, the\nGMs and medians were similar or slightly lower over the\npopulation of 427 samples as compared with the constructed\n24-h samples for the different OH-PAHs. This might suggest that\nfor OH-PAHs, spot sample concentrations taken at random times\nof the day would yield information on the central tendencies that\nis comparable with the central tendencies derived from a\ndistribution of 24-h samples.\nIn the third study, Scher et al.18 collected first morning voids and\n24-h samples from farmers and their children potentially exposed\nto chlorpyrifos. They measured 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP),\nVariability of phthalate, BPA concentrations\nChristensen et al\na chlorpyrifos metabolite, in the first morning void the day\nfollowing application of chlorpyrifos to a nearby agricultural field,\nand in the corresponding 24-h void for the day following\napplication. This strategy was employed because toxicokinetics\nsuggested that a peak concentration in urine would appear\nroughly 24 h following an exposure. As expected, the first morning\nvoid concentrations of TCP were higher than those estimated from\nAll of these studies showed evidence that the first morning void\nmight be higher than a 24-h average, whereas the study on PAH\nmetabolites additionally showed that random samples taken\nthroughout the day might show similar central tendencies as\ncompared with 24-h samples. The study on chlorpyrifos was\ntargeted based on a likelihood of recent exposure, and an\nexpectation that the peak concentration in urine might occur 24 h\nafter this exposure, about the time of the first morning void. For\nthis reason, it is not unexpected that the first morning void had\nhigher concentrations than the 24-h samples. For the study on\nphthalates and children/young adults, one consideration perhaps\nis that these younger individuals do not wake up and urinate at\nnight as frequently as older adults and often not at all, such that\nthe first morning voids include all phthalate metabolites that\nwould have migrated to the bladder overnight, and as a result,\ntheir first morning void might well have higher concentrations as\ncompared with the first morning voids of adults.\nTwo other studies have also looked at the relationship between\nurinary concentrations of BPA and phthalates over time, although in\na somewhat different way. Mahalingaiah et al.19 examined the\nurinary concentration of BPA in spot samples taken from 82 subjects\nseeking infertility evaluation and treatment, and had multiple spot\nsamples from a subset of individuals. Although the authors did not\nexamine correlation of BPA concentrations in spot samples taken\nduring the same day, they did look at how well a single spot sample\ncharacterized long-term trends in the full set of spot samples. They\nconcluded that a single spot sample had good ability to identify\nindividuals in the highest tertile of exposure, and that predictive\npower improved when two samples from the same day were used.\nSimilarly, Teitelbaum et al.20 evaluated urinary concentrations of\nphthalate metabolites, phytoestrogens and phenols among 35min-\nority children over a 6-month period, to determine how well a single\nspot sample characterized long-term trends. They also concluded\nthat a single spot sample was reliable in ranking subjects according\nto tertile of all the analytes studied. These studies addressing a\ndifferent aspect of the question, on the variability in spot versus\nlong-term sampling, also provide confidence that a single spot\nsample may recapitulate trends in exposure.\nIn our study, we found that first morning voids of the two DEHP\nmetabolites and BPA in the Atlanta cohort of adults showed a\nnarrow range of variability, comparable with the 24-h samples,\nand lower than the variability of all spot samples. The central\ntendencies of the first morning voids were comparable with 24-h\nand other spot samples, including NHANES samples, although the\nfirst morning void of MEHHP was a bit higher. This is also what\nPreau et al.12 found for MEHHP in the same data set.\nAylward et al.21 studied the issue of extrapolating spot versus\n24-h concentrations of DEHP to daily intakes directly using the Atlanta\ncohort. They determined daily intakes in two ways: from concen-\ntrations in spot samples using a creatinine-correction approach\nand from concentrations in 24-h constructed averages on a\nvolume-basis approach. They found that intakes determined from\nconcentrations in spot samples ranged from 20--300% of intakes\ndetermined from 24-h average concentrations. From their analysis,\nit is clear that application of the creatinine-correction approach\ncan underestimate as well as overestimate daily intakes for a given\nindividual. But what is the expectation of over or under estimation\nover a full population? As mentioned often, this Atlanta cohort\ncontains only eight adults in one city, so one must be cautious\nabout drawing any conclusions from an analysis of their data.\nThis issue is not only a matter of general interest, but it takes on\nadditional importance when the extrapolation is used to comment\non population health risk. Health and/or regulatory benchmarks\nfor phthalates and BPA are expressed on an intake basis. Intakes\nhave been derived from concentrations in spot samples using the\ncreatinine-correction approach, and the upper ends of the\npopulation distributions have been examined for their relationship\nto these intake-based benchmarks. Koch et al.,22 for example,\nmeasured spot urine concentrations of metabolites of six\nphthalates in 111 German children aged 5--6 years during a\nmandatory health examination for entrance into the education\nsystem, and determined each child's intake of each phthalate\nusing the creatinine-correction approach. They compared the\nintakes of each phthalate with the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) for\nthat phthalate, and also developed a cumulative TDI (TDICUM\n), by\nadding the ratio of the individual child's intake divided by the TDI\nfor each phthalate, that is, the sum of (intakePH\n) over the six\nphthalates. They found that about 2% of the children (2 of 111)\nexceeded the TDI for DnBP, 1% approached the TDI for DEHP, and\n24% exceeded the TDICUM\nfor the sum of DEHP, DnBP, and DiBP. In\na general population study entailing 85 German individuals, Koch\net al.8 measured four metabolites of DEHP and, from these,\ndetermined daily intakes using the creatinine approach. They\nfound that 10 of 85 individuals had intakes that exceeded the\nEuropean Union TDI value (at the time of publication in 2003) of\n37 mg/kg per day, and that 26 of 85 individuals had intakes higher\nthan the US Reference Dose (RfD) of 20 mg/kg per day. One can\nquestion whether the individuals identified in these studies\nactually had an intake on the day of sampling that exceeded\nthe TDI or RfD for the given phthalate. However, if the\ndistributions of spot and full-day urinary concentrations are\nsimilar, one may infer that B2% of children in the region of\nGermany studied, would experience an exposure to DnBP greater\nthan the TDI on any given day.\nIt should be noted that health benchmarks including the RfD\nand the TDI are often developed assuming a long-term, and not a\nsingle day, of exposure. The studies summarized above made\nobservations based on a surveys of single-day samples. As well,\nthe analysis in this paper looked only at inferences made from\nsingle spot samples taken during one day. As noted earlier, there\nhas been some work on longitudinal variability --- whether a\nhigh concentration on a single day from an individual suggests\nongoing elevations for that individual, a rare occasion, or\nsomething in between.19,20 Preau et al.,12 for example, did examine\nday-to-day variability in DEHP metabolites from the Atlanta cohort\nand found substantial variability from this perspective.\nFor short-lived compounds such as phthalates and BPA, it is\nexpected that the variability in concentrations seen in a population\nof 24-h samples from a specific group of individuals will, by\ndefinition, be less than the variability seen in a population\ncomprised of all the individual urine samples from that same\npopulation. We saw this when we were comparing the 427\nsamples in the Atlanta cohort with their 24-h samples. However,\none does not take all the urine samples in exposure surveys such\nas the NHANES; one takes only a single sample during a day. Given\nthis fact, it is easy to envision that a spot sample survey will miss\nsome of the high concentrations that would be seen in their\nsample population, if they sampled all urine events over the course\nof a day (or from several days), from those individuals rather than\njust one sample. In the same way, a population of 24-h samples\nmight very well characterize some of the days with high exposures\nthat are not captured in spot samples (e.g., if the individual who\nhad high exposure had given a spot sample before the exposure\noccurred). These are the issues we attempted to investigate.\nWe recognize that an optimal data set is simply unavailable to\naddress this question fully. The Atlanta data set best meets the\ncriteria, and perhaps the most direct analysis is that comparing the\n56 person-days of 24-h samples to the bootstrapped data sets of\nVariability of phthalate, BPA concentrations\nChristensen et al\n56 person-days of individual spot samples. Generally, we found\nthat the 24-h samples had less variability than the bootstrapped\nsamples, as measured by spread around the central tendency, a\nlower 95th percentile, and a lower maximum concentration. When\nstudying this question with less ideal data sets (i.e., non-matching\n24-h and random spot samples), we did find variability in long-\nterm samples that more closely matched the variability in spot\nsamples. Specifically, the spread of the interquartile range, and\nthe location of the 95th percentile and maximum concentration\nin relation to the median, were similar in the German data on\nphthalates and in the BPA data in children. This is probably\nthe extent of the observations one can make, given that the\nlong-term samples and spot samples came from different\npopulations.\nIn conclusion, the analysis here suggests that given the limited\ndata available to support such comparisons, concentrations of\nphthalate metabolites and BPA in spot urine samples on a\npopulation basis have variability reasonably comparable with 24-h\nurine concentrations of the same compounds on a population\nbasis. This lends credibility to the use of spot sample surveys of\nphthalates and BPA to infer roughly approximate distributions of\ndaily intakes within a population, and then to examine those\ndistributions for trends. The caveat we offer to this generality is\nthat caution should be exercised when using the high-end of spot\nsample surveys to characterize a high-end of daily intakes,\nparticularly when the high-end of intakes appears close to health\nand regulatory intake-based benchmarks.\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n"
