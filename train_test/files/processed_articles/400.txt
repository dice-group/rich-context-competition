Other racial/ethnic subgroups were not\nincluded because of insufficient sample size on which to\nbase folate intake estimates. For each folate intake category,\nwe estimated age-, gender- and race/ethnicity-specific\nrisks of developing each of the four health outcomes. We\nthen assigned lifetime QALY losses and disease-related\nnet costs for each health outcome, using either published\nestimates or a Markov modelling approach, to calculate\nthe population-wide impact of each strategy.\nFolate intake distributions\nEstimates of population-based folate intake distributions\nwere previously derived using food and dietary supple-\nment data from two periods of the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES)(22). Briefly, data\nfortification food folate intake, and those from NHANES\nintake and post-fortification food folate intake. Because\nnutrient intake data are based primarily on one 24 h dietary\nrecall measure, which does not represent an individual's\naverage long-term daily intake, population distribution\nestimates of dietary folate intake were corrected for mea-\nsurement error using a sub-sample of NHANES III subjects\nwho had provided two 24 h recalls. Total folate intake\ndistributions before and after the fortification policy, cor-\nrected for measurement error, are shown in Fig. 1 and\nin the Appendix. Folate intake for the two hypothetical\nscenarios was estimated as the product of the pre\u00adpost\ndifferences in corrected food folate intake and the ratio of\nstrategy), plus the post-fortification supplement intake.\nDisease incidence\nAnnual incidence of the four disease outcomes prior to\nfortification was estimated as a function of age range,\ngender and race/ethnicity (Table 1). When data were not\navailable for the Mexican-American population, the rates\nfor the Hispanic population were used.\nwere considered at risk for an NTD-affected pregnancy.\nNTD incidence as a function of race/ethnicity was based\non estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) of 10?6 cases of spina bifida and anen-\nNational Center for Health Statistics(28) were used to calcu-\nMI incidence was based on calculations by gender and\nage from the Framingham Risk Equations(29). The relative\nracial/ethnic distribution of MI incidence was assumed to\nbe the same as that of CHD-specific death among each\nage and gender-specific subgroup(30). Subgroup-specific\nannual colon cancer incidence rates were derived from\nthe Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program\n(SEER) of the National Cancer Institute(31\u00ad33).\nmasking was defined as the delayed\ndeficiency followed by the development\nof neurological complications. Estimates of masking risk\nincorporated the probability of consuming greater than\n1000 mg folate/d(22) \u00ad the `tolerable upper intake level' for\nfolic acid(10,11) \u00ad and the risk of pernicious anaemia (PA) \u00ad\na common cause of B12\nFolate-specific incidence of each disease was calcu-\nlated by using data on the percentage of the population in\neach folate intake category (Fig. 1) and the relative risks\nof disease by folate intake to split out the subgroup-\nspecific disease rates.

Relative risks for MI and colon cancer\nwere assumed to be the same for men and women.\nValuing outcomes\nThe number of disease events associated with each\nstrategy were estimated as the product of incidence and\nnational population estimates for each subgroup(38). The\nnumbers of events were multiplied by the associated\nQALY lost and net costs per event (Table 2) to estimate\nthe net health and economic impact of each fortification\nstrategy. All QALY and cost estimates were discounted by\n3 % per year.\nHealth related quality-of-life\nEstimates of QALY lost for NTD and B12\nmasking out-\ncomes were based on a CDC cost-effectiveness analy-\nsis(20) that used the Quality of Well-Being Index(39). To\nestimate the QALY lost associated with MI and colon\ncancer we used a Markov modelling approach in which\nwe incorporated disease-specific mortality, health-related\nquality-of-life weights and mortality from other cau-\nses(40\u00ad42). For MI, we assumed the same utility for patients\nwith coronary artery disease (CAD) of 0?84, calculated\nfrom previous analyses as the mean of mild and severe\nangina, weighted by the proportion of angina patients\nwith CAD(43\u00ad45).

Due to lack of adequate dose\u00adresponse data,\nthe model allows only for reduced NTD risk at folate\nconsumption of .400 mg/d, yet there may be benefits in\nNTD risk-reduction at lower levels.\nTo evaluate the effect of this possibility, three additional\nNTD dose\u00adresponse assumptions were tested (Fig. 3a),\nallowing women to benefit from folate intake over\nsimilar to that of colon cancer \u00ad albeit through different\nTable 3 Annual QALY and costs associated with US folic acid fortification, by fortification strategy and outcome\nStrategy* NTD MI CC B12\nNet\nEvents averted\nQALY gained\nCosts incurred (millions of dollars)-\nFortification costs Net costs\nQALY, quality-adjusted life years; NTD, neural tube defects; MI, myocardial infarctions; CC, colon cancer; B12\nmasking.\n*Strategies labelled by amount of fortification in mg of folic acid added per 100 g of enriched grain product.\n-Disease-specific costs do not include fortification costs.\nTable 4 Annual QALY and costs (millions of dollars) associated with US folic acid fortification, by gender, age and race/ethnicity\nNon-Hispanic white Non-Hispanic black Mexican-American\nStrategy* QALY Costs QALY Costs QALY Costs\nQALY, quality-adjusted life years.\n*Strategies labelled by amount of fortification in mg of folic acid added per 100 g of enriched grain product.\nCost-effectiveness analysis of US folic acid fortification policy 461\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

The use of NTD\nfunction B predicted at the 140 mg level a 23 % risk\nreduction, the closest approximation to observed data.\nWhen applying these functions for both NTD and MI\ndose\u00adresponse, the 700 mg strategy was predicted to save\nQALY and $4 billion in the base case (Table 5).\nTo evaluate the effect of the model's other assumptions,\na range of estimates were applied for QALY and costs\n(Table 2), relative risk of NTD-affected pregnancy (10% and\n5%).

Although disease incidence was not\nprojected to decrease among all populations, this effect\nwas caused by the unrealistic discontinuous risk func-\ntions used to avoid interpolating the epidemiological data\nanalysed in risk strata. Targeted supplement-use inter-\nventions may be necessary to further mitigate disparities\nand reduce disease prevalence, and future research\nshould aim to identify racial/ethnic differences in intake\nof fortified and non-fortified foods.\nThe results of the present analysis provide evidence for\nrecommending that fortification be increased to at least\ncorroborating prior research that predicted greater eco-\nnomic gains at higher fortification levels(20). The analysis\ndemonstrates that the benefits of higher fortification\nwould exceed the risks even in the most unfavourable\nsubgroups. It also addresses other important considera-\ntions by using estimates of folate intake that are national,\nsubgroup-specific, and corrected for the bias caused by\nthe use of 1 d dietary intake data.\nThere are several limitations to consider when inter-\npreting these results. The use of limited data on the\ndose\u00adresponse relationships between folate intake and\ndisease risk may have underestimated the post-fortifica-\ntion health benefits. However, even when using\nmore realistically continuous \u00ad albeit uncertain \u00ad dose\u00ad\nresponse assumptions for both NTD and MI, the conclu-\nsions of positive benefit\u00adrisk trade-offs for all subgroups \u00ad\nand of greater benefit at higher fortification levels \u00ad did\nnot change, and the model predicted that more NTD and\nMI would be prevented and that the NTD reduction\nwould be consistent with that observed post-policy(6,8,9,17).\nA related source of uncertainty is that synthetic folic\nacid is more bioavailable to absorption by the human\nbody than is naturally occurring folate. While this factor\ncan be incorporated using dietary folate equivalents\n(DFE) \u00ad a measure that adjusts intake estimates for these\nabsorption differences \u00ad we were unable to include DFE\nin our analysis due to data limitations. With fortification\nresulting in greater proportions of intake from synthetic\nfolic acid, the model's use of total folate may thus have\ncaused the benefits of fortification to be underestimated,\nand the risks to be overestimated. Conversely, because\nthis factor was not considered in estimating folate-specific\nrisks of MI and colon cancer, the benefits for dietary\nsources of folate may be overstated. The model's pro-\njected cost savings associated with fortification may have\nbeen underestimated, as lifetime caregiving costs of NTD-\naffected individuals were not included, reduced costs\nassociated with the proportion of NTD ending in a ter-\nminated pregnancy were excluded, and MI costs were\nused that may not consider the increased costs of today's\nstandards of care. By the same token, we may have\noverestimated QALY losses due to MI because survival\nhas been improved by today's standards of care. Taken\nas a whole, it is unlikely that any such positive or negative\neffects would substantially impact the results of the\nanalysis, or alter the conclusions of overall benefit.\nGiven the suggestion of possible insignificant or even\nadverse effects of increased folate intake on MI risk and\non colorectal cancer progression among individuals with\npre-existing disease(3,63\u00ad67), the benefits to MI as well as to\ncolon cancer could be less than predicted by our model.\nHowever, recent evidence also indicates a positive folate\u00ad\nstroke association(68\u00ad70) and an overall cardiovascular\nbenefit(16), and our results may thus underestimate ben-\nefits. The potential risk to colorectal cancer progression\nmay appear to be supported by recent published research\nindicating a possible temporary delay in the ongoing\ndecline in colorectal cancer incidence(71), but this could\nbe in part an artefact of increased use of colonoscopy. In\naddition, a recent report from the National Cancer Insti-\ntute indicates that not only is incidence still decreasing at\n2 % per year, but also mortality \u00ad which one would expect\nto increase if fortification were accelerating growth of\nexisting tumours \u00ad is also declining at an annual rate\nof close to 4 %(72). This analysis is thus important for\nmotivating further trials among people without exist-\ning disease, while simultaneously suggesting caution\namong policymakers who may be considering potential\nfortification increases.\nBy not formally allowing competing risks between\ndisease outcomes while allocating benefit for each dis-\nease event averted, the model may have double-counted\nsome of the benefits gained because multiple events may\nbe occurring per individual. The analysis did not incor-\nporate potential associations of folic acid intake with\nwith cognitive decline(80). Given the lack of consistent\nevidence for such outcomes, it is unclear in which\ndirection their inclusion may impact results, yet the\nstrength of the findings from our analysis suggests that the\nconclusion of overall benefit associated with increased\nfolate intake would not be changed.\nWhile these benefit\u00adrisk estimates assume a steady\nstate, in reality fortification's effect on NTD and B12\nmaskings would be relatively immediate, while that for\nyears(37), respectively. However, not only were fortifica-\ntion's benefits for NTD alone predicted to outweigh the\nmasking risk, this risk may in fact have been\noverestimated given our use of a conservative risk\nthreshold of 1000 mg/d despite no evidence of harm\nbelow 5000 mg/d(10). It is also important to note that while\nthere is conflicting evidence regarding whether masking\nhas increased since fortification(81\u00ad83), current medical\nknowledge regarding appropriate screening measures for\ndeficiency suggests that the fear of delayed diagnosis\nby physicians may not in fact be realised. The risk,\nhowever, may be that symptom improvement due to\nCost-effectiveness analysis of US folic acid fortification policy 463\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Nevertheless, with the low prevalence\nof potential masking \u00ad estimated at 0?09 % in older\nwomen before fortification and 0?61 % after(83) \u00ad even\nwith conservative estimates our model predicted that this\nrisk would be outweighed by the benefits.\nGiven the uncertainty involved, future research should\nclarify the dose\u00adresponse relationships and benefit\u00adrisk\nassociations between folate intake and disease risk. This is\nespecially important for outcomes such as MI, colon cancer,\nstroke, cognitive decline and B12\nmasking, for which\ncausality has not yet been established; there has been\nconflicting evidence on potential risks, in particular among\nindividuals with pre-existing disease; or there remains\nIn addition, future policy decisions may consider B12\nco-\nfortification or a more stringent screen for B12\ndeficiency\nto offset the potentially elevated B12\nmasking risks due\nto higher fortification, and may evaluate a broader range\nof fortification levels to better determine the optimal for-\ntification strategy.\nIn summary, folic acid fortification was implemented in\nthe USA in 1998 to reduce the chance of NTD in new-\nborns. While there are potential risks of increased folate\nintake to populations with vitamin B12\ndeficiency, there\nmay also be benefits in preventing MI and colon cancer.\nOverall, in considering the benefit\u00adrisk trade-offs of folic\nacid fortification, the present study suggests that the\nhealth and economic gains may outweigh the losses\nfor the US population as a whole, and that additional\nstudies on the potential benefits and hazards associated\nwith folate intake \u00ad as well as an in-depth evaluation of\nthe level of fortification \u00ad deserve further consideration in\norder to maximise net gains among all racial/ethnic, age\nand gender-specific subgroups.\n"
