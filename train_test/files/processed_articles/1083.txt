The studies concerning these trends suggest\nthat the prevalence of functional limitations (such as\nhaving difficulty bending, reaching, or stooping) and\ndifficulty with routine tasks such as shopping,\ncleaning, and managing money (instrumental activ-\nities of daily living, or IADLs) declined for older\nthe prevalence of difficulty with and the receipt of\nhelp for personal care activities such as bathing, dres-\nsing, and walking (activities of daily living, or ADLs),\nalthough trends in the use of personal care or assistive\ntechnology to meet ADL needs have been relatively\nAt the same time, the relative importance of\nassistive devices (also referred to in the literature and\nsurveys as assistive technology, special equipment,\nor aids) in meeting the needs of the older population\nhas been increasing. Nearly two thirds of older\nAmericans with an ADL disability use one or more\nassistive devices to meet their needs (Agree &\nFreedman, 2000), and this estimate increased during\nprevalence of the use of assistive devices is likely to\nrise further as the number and types of devices\navailable increase. In the past 20 years alone, the\nnumber of assistive devices has expanded from 6,000\nproducts (U.S. Congress Office of Technology As-\nAn earlier version of this article was prepared for the annual meeting\nBoston, MA.

Although potential sources of bias in\ndisability trends have been explored in systematic\nreviews (e.g., Freedman et al., 2002), the various\napproaches to measuring assistive device use and\ntheir influence on disability prevalence rates has not\nbeen investigated. Our purpose in this article is to\ndescribe the range of approaches that national sur-\nveys employ to measure assistive device use; inves-\ntigate how prevalence estimates of assistive device\nuse by older Americans are influenced by survey\ndesign features; and explore how analytic decisions\nabout the inclusion of assistive device measures may\naffect estimates of late-life-disability prevalence.\nBackground: Approaches to Defining\nand Measuring Disability\nUnlike measures of disease, disability is socially\ndefined, representing the intersection of an individu-\nal's abilities, her or his social and physical environ-\nment, and the demands of daily tasks (Agree, 1999).\nConceptually, a person experiences a disability when\nthe demands of a given context (environment and\ntask) do not match her or his physical, cognitive, and\nsensory capabilities. Given these complexities, the\nlack of agreement about optimal measures of\ndisability (Altman, 2001) and the wide variation of\nmeasures appearing in the late-life-disability litera-\nture are not surprising.\nAt least three general approaches to defining the\nprevalence of late-life disability have appeared in the\nliterature. The first considers those who have\ndifficulty with daily tasks, most often in the absence\nof accommodations (e.g., without help or equip-\nment), as having a disability. The second approach\nclassifies those needing or getting personal care as\nhaving a disability. Less common is a third approach\nthat categorizes people who use any assistance--\neither personal help or assistive devices--in daily\nactivities as having a disability.\nFigure 1 illustrates how these various measure-\nment approaches overlap. The largest circle repre-\nsents the population that reports difficulty with daily\nactivities in the absence of help or equipment. The\ncircles drawn with dotted and dashed lines represent\nthe populations using assistive devices and getting\nhelp from another person, respectively. Although the\nillustration here is for a hypothetical population, one\ncan imagine that the size of the circles as well as the\nextent of overlap will vary by key demographic\ncharacteristics, particularly age.\nAs Figure 1 shows, people who report having\ndifficulty also may report the use of assistance--\neither an assistive device, or help from another\nperson, or both. However, restricting the definition\nof disability to the population that reports difficulty\nomits a potentially important group: those who use\neither assistive devices or personal help or both but\nwho report no difficulty with a task. This group may\nuse devices (e.g., a cane) as a prophylactic measure,\nperhaps to avoid falling or to increase security.\nAlternately, they may be so successful in adapting\nwith the device that they perceive no difficulty\nwhatsoever. Regardless of the reason, they do not\nassociate performance of the task with difficulty.\nSurveys sometimes embed questions about assistive\ndevice use within questions about difficulty with\nADLs, effectively restricting the assistance questions\nto those reporting difficulty and eliminating this\ngroup a priori. For this group, the use of assistance,\nlike behavioral changes that are made to accommo-\ndate daily activities, may signal what has been\nreferred to as preclinical disability (Fried, Bandeen-\nRoche, Chaves, & Johnson, 2000; Pine, Gurland, &\nThe figure also illustrates that restricting the\ndefinition of disability to the population getting\npersonal help excludes two potentially important\ngroups receiving assistance: those who have difficulty\nand bridge that difficulty with only assistive devices\nand those who use devices for reasons other than\ndifficulty (e.g., safety or convenience). Whether these\nso-called omitted groups have similar characteristics\nas those receiving personal help is unclear; one might\nhypothesize that they are likely to differ because they\nhave accommodated their difficulty (or if not their\ndifficulty, their situation) independently, without\nhuman assistance.\nIn sum, two common approaches to measuring\ndisability--defined either as having difficulty or as\nreceiving help--potentially omit relevant groups of\nindividuals who use assistive devices to carry out\ntheir daily tasks. In this article, we explore both types\nof omissions and their implications for estimates of\nassistive device use and of disability prevalence.\nFigure 1. Illustrative overlap among populations of individ-\nuals who have difficulty, get help, or use assistive devices to\ncarry out daily activities.\nMethods\nData\nWe compare estimates of assistive device use\nacross the following six national surveys, using the\nlatest available wave of data: the 2002 National\nHealth Interview Survey (NHIS), the 2000 Medical\nExpenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), the 2001 Survey\nof Income and Program Participation (SIPP), the 2000\nHealth and Retirement Survey (HRS), the 1999\nNational Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS), and\nthe 2001 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey\n(MCBS). Although not all of the surveys focus on\nthe older population, they all include samples of older\nadults and questions about late-life disability, in-\ncluding measures of difficulty and forms of assis-\ntance. Even so, each survey serves multiple purposes\nand, therefore, the amount of detail collected on these\ntopics is limited and varies. In the following analyses,\nwe limit samples from each survey to the community-\ndwelling population aged 65 and older. (See Table 1\nfor additional details on each survey.)\nMissing Data.--We treat missing data on device\nuse or disability consistently across all surveys. Data\ncan be missing on the device-use questions primarily\nfor two reasons: (a) the survey design skipped\na respondent around the device-use questions; and\n(b) a respondent did not provide an answer to the\nquestion(s). For respondents who were skipped\naround the device-use questions, we assume that the\nrespondents do not use any assistive devices.\nFor item nonresponse (e.g., don't knows or re-\nfusals), we also assume that respondents are not\nusing the devices in question. In the NHIS core,\nHRS, MEPS, NLTCS, and MCBS, this affects less\nthan 0.7% of cases included in the samples from\nthese surveys. In the NHIS disability supplement,\nabout 2% of cases are missing on the device-use\nquestion, and we assume that these individuals are\nnot using any devices. In the SIPP, there are no\nmissing data in the public release file because an\nimputation procedure is used to assign values to\nmissing data. Approximately 8% of cases have\nvalues imputed for the device-use questions. Results\nare unaffected if cases with item nonresponse or\nimputed data are dropped.\nWe use a similar strategy for dealing with missing\ndata on the disability questions. If a respondent does\nnot provide an answer to a disability question, we\nassume that the respondent does not have a disability.\nIn the MEPS, NHIS, and HRS, less than 0.1% of\ncases are missing on the disability items and about\n8% of cases in the SIPP have imputed data. In\naddition, in the HRS, respondents who report no\nfunctional limitations, or one functional limitation\nand no difficulty dressing, are skipped around\nquestions about difficulty with walking or trans-\nferring, the measures of disability examined here. We\nassume that these respondents do not have difficulty\nwith these activities (disability data from the NLTCS\nTable 1.

Again, results do not\nchange if cases with either item nonresponse or\nimputed data are excluded.\nMethods\nFirst, we discuss differences in the design and\nwording of the surveys. Following this, for each\nsurvey, we present the weighted percentage of those\naged 65 or older and those aged 85 or older who use\nany assistive device, assistive devices for specific\nADLs (mobility, bathing, toileting, transferring,\neating, or dressing), and individual devices (wheel-\nchair and walker, cane, or crutches).\nNext, we explore the implication for estimates of\nassistive device use of restricting device-use questions\nto those reporting difficulty. Using data from the\nHRS, we test differences in device-use rates esti-\nmated with and without restriction on difficulty.\nWe then use four surveys to explore the implica-\ntions for disability rates of excluding (a) those who\nuse assistive devices but report no difficulty (SIPP and\nHRS) and (b) those who use devices but report no\nhelp (MEPS and NHIS). In both cases we show the\nunadjusted rate excluding the group in question and\nthe adjusted rate when the omitted group is added to\nthe estimate, and we use t tests to examine differences\nin rates.\nFinally, we explore the characteristics of the two\nexcluded groups by using chi-square tests to indicate\nsignificant differences in rates across demographic\ngroups (age, gender, race, marital status, and\neducation). We also use multinomial logistic re-\ngression models with SIPP and HRS data to estimate\nmodels with a three-category outcome: (a) reports\nno difficulty and does not use devices; (b) reports no\ndifficulty but uses devices; and (c) reports difficulty\n(the reference group). We estimate a second set of\nmodels with the MEPS and NHIS for the outcome:\n(a) gets no personal help and does not use devices;\n(b) gets no personal help but does use devices; and\n(c) gets personal help (the reference group). Predic-\n(Black, White, or other), marital status (married or\nunmarried), and education (less than high school,\nhigh school education, or more than high school).\nWe exclude cases missing on these predictors from\nboth the bivariate and the multivariate analyses.\nWe drop approximately 0.5% of the cases in the\nHRS, 1.8% in the MEPS, and 1.7% in the NHIS (data\nnot shown).\nResults\nDifferences in Survey Design\nThere are three primary survey design elements\nrelated to measuring device use that differ across the\nsix surveys examined: (a) whether questions about\nassistive devices are restricted to those reporting\ndifficulty with ADLs; (b) whether questions focus on\ndevice use for specific activities or device use more\ngenerally (global), regardless of the tasks for which\nthey are used; and (c) whether questions focus on\nindividual devices or the use of any device (any use).\nThere also are some potentially important question-\nwording differences, including a reference to a time\nperiod for use (e.g., use last week or use now) and the\nterminology used to refer to assistive devices (e.g.,\nspecial equipment, aids, technology, equipment).\nTable 2 outlines the salient features of the device-use\nquestions for each of the surveys. Actual question\nwording appears in Appendix A.\nRestricting Device-Use Questions.--Surveys dif-\nfer in regard to which respondents are asked\nquestions about the use of assistive devices. Of the\nsurveys reviewed, one asks questions about device\nuse only to respondents who self-report having\ndifficulty with functioning (HRS), and another limits\ndetailed questions to those reporting a chronic\nproblem with one or more daily activities (NLTCS).\nA third survey (MCBS) restricts questions about\ndevice use for a specific activity to those reporting\ndifficulty with that specific activity. The three\nremaining surveys (NHIS, MEPS, and SIPP) do not\nimpose any restrictions.\nQuestion Focus: Activities.--A second difference\nis in the activities on which questions focus. Three\nsurveys (HRS, NLTCS, and MCBS) ask about device\nuse for specific tasks, and the other three (NHIS,\nMEPS, and SIPP) focus on use more generally,\nwithout reference to specific activities. Two surveys\n(NLTCS and MCBS) ask about equipment used to\nhelp in performing all ADLs, and one (HRS) limits its\nquestions about device use for walking and trans-\nferring. The global questions vary in terms of how\ndevices are referred to and what kinds of activities are\nmentioned. (Mentioned activities are, e.g., usual\nactivities in the NHIS disability supplement, personal\ncare or everyday activities in the MEPS, and no\nspecific activities in the SIPP or NHIS core; see\nAppendix A for details.)\nQuestion Focus: Devices.--Finally, surveys also\ndiffer in whether they record specific types of devices\nor any use. Three surveys (NHIS, MEPS, and MCBS)\nrecord any use (the latter for each activity). The other\nthree surveys record more detailed information. The\nNLTCS and HRS, for example, ask respondents to\nname the type of device used for each activity,\nwhereas the SIPP asks explicitly whether the re-\nspondent uses ``a wheelchair or scooter'' or ``a\nwalker, cane, or crutches.'' Among the surveys that\nrecord more detail, there is variation in the items that\nare recorded and whether items are grouped together.\nPrevalence Estimates Across Surveys\nThe first three rows of Table 3 show the\nprevalence estimates of the use of any device. We\nderived these estimates in slightly different ways\nand are thus shown on different rows. Estimates\nfrom the NHIS (core and disability supplement) and\nthe MEPS are from a single question about the use\nof any assistive device. We derive the HRS, NLTCS,\nand MCBS estimates by summing across the use of\ndevices for specific ADL tasks. The SIPP estimate\nincludes those that report using a wheelchair or\nscooter or a walker, cane, or crutch.\nDespite the differences in measurement and differ-\nences in the way prevalence is derived, estimates of\nthe use of ``any assistive device'' are remarkably\nsimilar. Between 14% (NLTCS) and 18% (SIPP and\nNHIS, both the core and the disability supplement) of\nthose aged 65 and older and between 39% (NLTCS\nand MCBS) and 44% (SIPP and NHIS Core) of adults\naged 85 and older use one or more assistive devices.\nThe middle panel of Table 3 provides task-specific\nestimates of device use. Estimates are in general quite\nsimilar across surveys for the population aged 65 and\nolder, but they vary a bit more for some activities for\nthe 85 and older population. For example, estimates\nof device use for bathing (6.5% to 8.5%), toileting\nquite similar for the 65 and older population, but the\npercentage of the 85 and over population using\ndevices ranges from 16% to 24% for bathing, from\ntransferring. There are two exceptions for this\ngeneral pattern. First, estimates vary for both age\nolder populations, respectively). The indoor mobility\nestimates come from only two surveys--the HRS and\nNLTCS--which use different screening approaches\nand different questions (see Table 2 and Appendix\nA for details). Second, estimates for using devices\nfor eating and dressing are quite low (less than 1.5%)\nand quite similar within each age group.\nThe bottom panel of Table 3 shows the frequency\nof use of specific devices. Although the HRS and\nNLTCS collect information on the use of additional\ndevices, in the SIPP, wheelchairs, walkers, canes, and\ncrutches are the only devices about which data are\ncollected. (The NHIS, MEPS, and MCBS do not ask\nquestions about specific devices.) Results show that\nfrom 2% (HRS) to 5% (SIPP) of the population\nand NLTCS) of the population aged 85 and older\nuse wheelchairs. Between 11% (NLTCS) and 17%\nTable 2.

The right-hand side\ndemonstrates how estimates of device use are affected\nwhen questions about device use are restricted to\nthose reporting difficulty. The first row shows that\n9% of those individuals aged 65 and over who report\nhaving no difficulty walking across a room also\nreport using indoor-mobility equipment. If these\nrespondents were excluded from the use questions (as\nthey would be if the device-use questions were\nrestricted to those reporting difficulty), the estimates\nof using equipment for walking across a room would\nbe cut in half. That is, only 6.3% would be identified\nas using indoor-mobility devices compared with\n14.6% when no restriction is imposed. The rate of\nusing transferring equipment also would be cut\nnearly in half if transferring-device-use questions\nwere restricted to those reporting difficulty trans-\nferring (2.6% with restriction vs 5.1% with no\nrestriction).\nThe bottom panel of Table 4 demonstrates the\neffect of restricting the device-use questions for\nestimates of the use of specific types of devices.\nAmong older adults reporting no difficulty with\nwalking or transferring, 8.3% (2.4 million people)\nreport using a device for those activities; the majority\nof these individuals use canes (80% or about 1.9\nmillion people). Restricting the device questions to\nthose reporting difficulty lowers the prevalence\nestimates of any device use by about half, from\n15% to 7.6%, largely as a result of the exclusion of\nthese cane users. Estimates of cane use would be\nreduced by more than half (from 10.4% with no\nrestriction to 4.5 %) and wheelchair use by about one\nCombining Assistive Device Use\nWith Rates of Difficulty and Help\nTable 5 shows the potential effects of combining\nestimates of assistive device use with rates of dif-\nficulty and of getting personal help. The left side\nillustrates the changes in disability rates that result\nfrom augmenting difficulty responses with informa-\ntion about assistive device use. In the SIPP, for\nexample, 6.5% of the population aged 65 and older\nreport having difficulty getting around inside. An\nadditional 13.1% of individuals report using a device\nbut have no difficulty. By including these respond-\nents, the percentage of individuals with an indoor-\nmobility disability would triple. In the HRS, results\nfor walking across the room are similar, with the\ncombined estimate of having difficulty or using a\ndevice (16.3%) double the estimate of those reporting\ndifficulty (8.0%). The combined estimate for trans-\nferring is 8.8% compared with 6.2% for the estimate\nbased only on difficulty.\nThe right side of Table 5 illustrates the effects of\ncombining estimates of assistive device use with rates\nof getting personal help (see Appendix B for the\nwording of help questions). About 6% of respondents\naged 65 or older report receiving (MEPS) or needing\nTable 4.

Estimates\nof assistive device use without help range from\nroughly 12% to 14%.Combining the percentage of\nindividuals reporting help with the percentage of\nindividuals reporting device use leads to estimates\nthat are nearly triple those of help alone (18.0% to\nIdentifying Those Reporting Device\nUse but no Difficulty or Help\nThe top panels of Table 6 shows, for several\ndemographic groups, the percentage of individuals\nwho report no difficulty but use devices for several\nmobility-related tasks. Older respondents, women,\nBlacks, those who are not married, and respondents\nwith less than a high school education are more likely\nto be in this group for getting around inside (SIPP\nand HRS), walking (SIPP), and transferring (HRS).\nSimilarly, the percentage of individuals who report\nusing devices but not help (MEPS, NHIS) is higher for\nolder respondents, women, Blacks, unmarried indi-\nviduals, and those with less than a high school\neducation (bottom panels, Table 6).\nTable 7 shows the odds of reporting device use\nbut no difficulty relative to reporting difficulty (col-\numn 2 of each model). The associations between the\ndemographic variables and the likelihood of using\ndevices and reporting no difficulty vary across sur-\nveys and activities, showing few consistent patterns.\nThe one consistent finding across surveys and\nactivities relates to education. Those with more\nthan a high school education are from one third more\nlikely to twice as likely as those with less than a high\nschool education to report no difficulty but use\na device for a mobility-related activity.\nThe associations between demographic character-\nistics and the odds of reporting device use but no\nhelp, relative to reporting help (column 2 of each\nmodel in Table 8), vary across surveys and tasks.\nNevertheless, two consistent results emerge. The\nrelative odds of reporting device use but no help is\nlower for two groups: the oldest old (aged 85\u00fe)\ncompared with those aged 65 to 74, and those of\nother races (not Black or White) compared with\nWhites. These results suggest that approaches that\nuse questions about help to identify the older\npopulation with disability tend to omit younger in-\ndividuals who are White.\nDiscussion\nOur purpose in this study was to gain a better\nunderstanding of the implications of assistive-device\nmeasurement for estimates of device use and\ndisability in late life.

For example, by restricting questions to those\nreporting difficulty with mobility-related tasks, thus\nomitting those individuals who use devices but report\nno difficulty, our results show that estimates of device\nuse would be half as large. If estimates of disability\nwere based on difficulty or device use, that is,\nincluded those individuals who use devices but report\nno difficulty, the prevalence of disability would be up\nto three times as large as estimates based on difficulty\nalone. Finally, results showed that individuals who\nreport no difficulty but use devices for mobility tend\nto be highly educated, and the majority of these\nindividuals report using a cane.\nEstimates of disability based on receiving or\nneeding help also are influenced by device use.\nCombining estimates of those individuals using\ndevices with those getting help increases estimates\nnearly threefold compared with rates of those persons\ngetting help alone. Furthermore, younger individuals\n(aged 65\u00ad74) and Whites have greater odds of using\ndevices but not help compared with getting help.\nThis study has several limitations. First, we could\nnot definitively assess the amount of bias introduced\ninto assistive device use and disability estimates by\nrestricting questions about device use to those\nreporting difficulty. Although we contrasted esti-\nmates of difficulty and device use for mobility-related\nactivities, whether these differences hold for other\nactivities is unclear. Moreover, in some cases we\nassumed that the devices (e.g., wheelchair or walker,\ncane, or crutch) were used for all mobility-related\nactivities across settings. Finally, neither of the two\nsurveys used to assess this bias unambiguously\nmeasures difficulty without the use of assistive\ndevices: the SIPP question specifies that users of\nassistive technology report difficulty when they use\ntheir equipment, but without personal help (see\nAppendix B), and the HRS measures of difficulty do\nnot make reference to assistance at all, leaving up to\nthe respondents whether they report their difficulty\nwith or without assistance (see Appendix B). This\nimplies that some proportion of the gap between\nreports may include satisfied users of technology who\nexperience no difficulty when using their devices.\nTable 6.

Had a true measure of\nunderlying difficulty been available, the combined\nrates of difficulty and device use may not have been\nas large as shown here.\nA related limitation is that we were unable to\nexplore whether task-specific, global, or detailed\ndevice-use questions provide similar estimates of\nthe prevalence of assistive device use. For this issue\nto be explored further, a survey that measures\ndevices by using more than one approach is needed.\nA study now underway to create an instrument for\nnational surveys to measure assistive-technology\nuse and effectiveness is being funded by the\nAssistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation in\ncooperation with the National Institute on Aging\nand the National Center for Health Statistics. The\nnew instrument, developed with input from policy\nmakers, researchers, and extensive cognitive testing\nby the National Center for Health Statistics, will be\npiloted with a purposive sample of 300 individuals\naged 50 and older. Both global and detailed items\nwill be included and use will be assessed across\nmultiple tasks.\nDespite these limitations, our results have impor-\ntant implications for survey designers interested in\nmeasuring device use and disability among older\nAmericans. Our results suggest that a nontrivial\nproportion of older adults use devices but report no\ndifficulty with daily tasks, and that these individuals\nare more highly educated than those reporting\ndifficulty. Future studies might explore a number\nof possible explanations for such discrepancies,\nincluding the relationship among reports of device\nuse, underlying disability dynamics, the physical,\ncognitive, and mental status of individuals, and\nperceptions about ability and independence. To\nfacilitate these explorations, survey designers may\nwant to consider asking questions about assistive\ntechnology independent of questions about diffi-\nculty and give researchers the option of studying\nfurther the personal characteristics and social and\nenvironmental conditions of this group. Qualitative\ninterviews also may add to our understanding of\nhow these individuals perceive their situations and\nwhy they report using devices but not difficulty.\nResearchers interested in studying older Ameri-\ncans who use assistive devices may find reassuring\nthe finding that national estimates fall within\na relatively narrow range. However, despite the\nfact that the estimates are similar, it is possible that\ndifferent approaches to identifying assistive device\nuse may capture different groups of users. An\nimportant next step will be to investigate the\nreliability and validity of the various approaches\nidentified here--global, task specific, or device\nTable 7.

These individuals are\nimportant to consider because, as a younger and\nmore educated group, they may represent the\npatterns of adaptation new cohorts will make as\nthey age. Whether this group should appropriately be\nincluded in estimates of the older population with\ndisabilities, however, raises questions about where\nthe clinical threshold for disability should be set in\nnational estimates. It may be more appropriate to\ninclude this group along with those making behav-\nioral accommodations in the population with pre-\nclinical disability (Fried et al., 2000).\nEvidence suggests that the number of older adults\nusing assistive devices has been steadily growing over\nSpillman, 2004); whether this trend reflects changes\nin underlying health (e.g., decreasing levels of\ndisability), changes in the propensity to turn to\ndevices instead of human care (i.e., increasing\nacceptance of technology), changes in the availability\nof personal care, or changes in the desire to maintain\nindependence is still unclear. What is clear is that the\nuse of assistance and perceptions of difficulty and\nability are inextricably interwoven, and more atten-\ntion to the measurement of these concepts, and to the\nimplications of measurement techniques for our\nestimates of disability in the older population is\nwarranted.\nReferences\nAgree, E.
