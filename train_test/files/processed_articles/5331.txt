Apoptosis and inflammation play important roles\nin AMD pathogenesis.

We studied the effects of PEDF on focal retinal\n[Crb1rd8]) mice, a model for progressive, focal rd (retinal\ndegeneration).

Wang and others\nINTRODUCTION\nAMD (age-related macular degeneration) is a chronic, pro-\ngressive, neurodegenerative disorder in the retinal macula.\nAMD has become the leading cause of irreversible cen-\ntral vision loss in the elderly worldwide (Coleman et al.,\nmajor forms of AMD: geographic atrophic (dry) AMD and\nexudative/neovascular (wet) AMD. Atrophic AMD is char-\nacterized by drusen deposits, RPE (retinal pigment epithe-\nlium)/photoreceptor degeneration and loss in the macula. In\nneovascular AMD, CNV (choroidal neovascularization) breaks\nthrough the Bruch's membrane to the neuroretina, causing\nfluid leakage, lipid accumulation, and ultimately resulting in\nfibrovascular scarring. Most AMD patients have large con-\nfluent drusen in the macula and later develop geographic\natrophy or neovascular AMD, both of which cause severe\nAlthough AMD is a neurodegenerative disorder (de Jong,\n2006), causes of the macular degeneration are still not clear.\nSeveral evidence has linked it to intense parainflammation\ndue to a wide range of causes, such as ageing, oxidative\nstress, genetic predisposition, and environmental elements\nphotoreceptors and retinal neurons are exposed to the cy-\ntokines and neurotoxins released by the activated inflam-\nmatory components, thereby contributing to the initiation\nand progression of AMD. In addition, studies have shown\nthat apoptosis of RPE and photoreceptors are involved in\ngeographic atrophy AMD (Dunaief et al., 2002; Yang et al.,\nPEDF (pigment epithelium-derived factor) is a naturally\noccurring glycoprotein of 50-kDa that is present abundantly\nin the retina and is secreted mainly by RPE in a directional\nfashion toward the neuroretina (Becerra et al., 2004). It be-\nlongs to the serpin (serine protease inhibitor) superfamily\nby sequence homology (Steele et al., 1993). Although PEDF\nlacks protease inhibitory activity, it exhibits several biologi-\ncal activities of interest for the eye that make it a potential\ntherapeutic agent for several ocular diseases. PEDF was dis-\ncovered in the culturing media of human fetal RPE cells with\npotent neuronal differentiating activity on retinoblastoma\ncells (Tombran-Tink et al., 1991). Later it was established that\nPEDF is a neurotrophic factor of the retina and the CNS\n(central nervous system). It protects photoreceptors against\napoptosis in the rd (retinal degeneration) and rds (retinal\ndegeneration slow) and light damage animal models, inner\nretina against ischemia and retinal ganglion cells (Cayouette\n2007). PEDF has pro-survival and anti-apoptotic activity on\nR28 cells, a rat retinal progenitor cells in culture (Murakami\nmanner, PEDF effectively protects R28 cell death induced by\nserum starvation and elevates the levels of the anti-apoptotic\nBcl2 gene and protein.

The major component of\nlipofuscin A2E causes further RPE damage and is regarded as\nimpressive that not only PEDF treatment effectively reduced\nA2E level in the RPE of DKO rd8 mice, but also improved the\nstructural integrity of the RPE, which in turn can facilitate\nthe maintenance of photoreceptor integrity.\nThe photoreceptors and RPE of human AMD eyes and of\nDKO rd8 mice undergo apoptosis likely mediated by the FasL\nand Fas system as well as the Bcl-2/Bax system (Dunaief et al.,\nC 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nY. Wang and others\nFigure 4 Anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic effects of PEDF on the neuroretina in DKO mice\nWhole retina of PEDF-treated and untreated DKO rd8 eyes was harvested and total RNA was isolated and converted to cDNA. To\ndetermine the transcript levels of targeted gene, the mRNA levels were quantified and normalized to universal mRNA with the -actin\nhousekeeping gene by qRT-PCR. (A) Tnf, (B) Il1, (C) Il17a, (D) iNos and (E) Vegfa (n = 8).*indicates significant difference between\nuntreated and PEDF-treated eyes as *P < 0.05.\nan elevated FasL-mediated RPE apoptosis under inflammation\nand oxidative stress in the cultured RPE cells of DKO rd8\nmouse than that of WT (Wang et al., 2012). Higher levels of\nBax transcript and lower ratios of Bcl2/Bax were also detected\nin DKO rd8 mouse eyes compared with WT (Cao et al., 2010).\nInterestingly, in DKO rd8 eyes, PEDF increases ONL thickness\nand decreases apoptotic retinal cells with a decrease in FasL\nprotein, indicating that PEDF might be effective to reverse\nFasL-mediated apoptosis in DKO rd8 retina. We detect that no\nsignificant decrease of Fasl and Fas transcripts in the DKO rd8\nretinas with PEDF treatment. This result could be due to the\ndiscordant expression of transcript and protein of FasL and\nFas in DKO rd8 mouse eyes. In our previous study, we found\nhigher FasL and Fas protein yet comparable transcript levels\nin the DKO retina compared with WT (Cao et al., 2010; Wang\net al., 2011). In the present study, PEDF significantly down-\nregulated pro-apoptotic Bax protein and transcript as well as\nup-regulated anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein in DKO rd8 retina.\nThese findings are in agreement with the PEDF effects in the\nretinas of Royal College Surgeons rats and retina progenitors\nR28 cells in culture in which the anti-apoptotic effect of PEDF\nresults from induction of Bcl-2 expression to prevent nuclear\ntranslocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (Murakami et al.,\n2008). An overexpression of Bcl-2 can lead to prevention\nof Bax translocation and activation, resulting in lower cell\ninfluence of PEDF on decreasing pro-apoptotic and elevating\nanti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members can produce a survival\neffect in the DKO rd8 retina.\nAnother important mechanism of AMD development is\nthe involvement of inflammation (Ding et al., 2009; Xu et al.,\noxidative stress, complement components and inflammatory\nmediators contribute to parainflammation in human AMD\nTarallo et al., 2012). Retinal changes in DKO rd8 mice are\nindicative of a chronic inflammatory process, immune dys-\nfunction and activation of innate immunity (Ross et al., 2008;\nVarious pro-inflammatory cytokines and related molecules\nhave also been reported in DKO rd8 retinas and RPE.\nAs a multifactorial disease, retinal neurons are exposed\nto the pro-inflammatory cytokines in AMD. Among them,\npro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1 are con-\nsidered as one of the primary components responsible for the\ninflammatory response in AMD. Recently, several reports have\nshowed the involvement of IL-17 in the inflammatory patho-\net al., 2013). Moreover, oxidative stress plays a role in the\n316 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nPEDF protects neuroretina in an AMD model\nrd in AMD. By using the DKO rd8 mouse model, our pre-\nvious studies demonstrated lower transcript expression of\nretina when treated with anti-inflammatory and/or neuro-\nprotective agents. Thus, we chose these cytokines to detect\nwhether PEDF has anti-inflammatory effects in this mouse\nmodel. TNF, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is produced by\nlymphocytes and macrophages, and plays a role in induc-\ntion of apoptosis. IL-1, also a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is\nproduced mainly by macrophages and involved in cell prolif-\neration and apoptosis. iNOS, the inducible NOS plays a pivotal\nrole in sustained and elevated NO release. iNOS is released\nunder pathological conditions by inflammation and certain\ncytokines, including TNF and IL-1. Elevated serum IL-17A,\na Th17 family cytokine, is reported in AMD patients (Liu et al.,\neffectively arrested photoreceptor and RPE degeneration in\nConsequently, all these pro-inflammatory molecules can in-\nteract with each other to evoke apoptosis and tissue damage,\nresulting in rd. The current study demonstrates that PEDF\ntreatment counteracts inflammatory state in neuroretina by\ndown-regulating the inflammatory mediators Tnf, Il1, iNos\nand Il17a transcripts to ultimately ameliorate retinal damage\nand contribute to fewer retinal degenerative lesions in DKO\nrd8 mouse retina.\nPEDF also decreases the levels of VEGF, a pro-\ninflammatory molecule that plays a well-recognized role in\nneovascularization (Reinders et al., 2003). Although VEGF ex-\npression is regulated largely by hypoxia and mainly involved\nwith CNV in neovascular AMD, VEGF/PEDF ratio favoring an-\ngiogenesis may promote drusen accumulation and trigger\nprogression towards CNV in smoker patients with dry AMD\n(Pons and Marin-Castano, 2011). Pons et al. also detected\nincreased VEGF levels in RPE/choroids from mice under ox-\nidative stress. An increased VEGF level is documented in DKO\net al., 2013). Thus, the reduced VEGF expression also indicated\nthat inflammatory and oxidative milieu of PEDF-treated DKO\nrd8 eyes is lessened.\nIn summary, our data show that PEDF stabilizes focal pho-\ntoreceptor degeneration in DKO rd8 mice. The protective\nmechanisms deduced from our data are via anti-apoptotic,\nanti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic pathways. The neu-\nroprotective effect of PEDF constitutes a novel approach for\npotential treatment of AMD.\nYujuan Wang helped in drafting the manuscript, acquisition\nof data, collection of data, analysis and interpretation of data,\nfinal approval of the version to be published.
