Pace\nDoctoral Student, School of Social Work, Department\nof Sociology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor,\n1 Background\nPolicy and Scholarly Debates\nOf the many potential determinants of child\nhealth development throughout the life course,\none of the most contentiously debated has been\nthe role of marriage and nonmarital childbearing.\nThe now-famous Moynihan Report (1965), titled\nThe Negro Family, highlighted family structure,\nalong with the legacy of slavery and sustained\ndiscrimination, and inadequate employment\nopportunities, as key determinants of intransigent\npoverty among African-Americans of the time\n(Massey and Sampson 2009). Moynihan's pri-\nmary policy recommendation was for increased\nfederal efforts toward economic opportunity, and\nhe was initially praised by black leaders for\nfocusing such high-level attention on the wellbe-\ning of black families. However, a more enduring\nlegacy of his report, particularly in the context of\nthe civil rights and feminist movements of the\n1960s, was his reference to the \"pathological\"\nnature of mother-headed households (ibid.) and\nthe controversy it engendered.\nIn the subsequent decades, scholars and poli-\ncymakers debated whether nonmarital childbear-\ning was the result of a \"culture of poverty,\" which\nencouraged choices that undermined African-\nAmerican children's life chances, or of structural\nfactors such as racial discrimination, which\ntrapped families in circumstances of intergenera-\ntional poverty and social disadvantage (Wilson\n1988). The nature and causes of poverty, and the\nracialized discourse about social welfare pro-\ngrams, single-parent families, and their implica-\ntions for child wellbeing, played a significant role\nin policy debates as well. This rhetoric was par-\nticularly notable in passage of the 1996 welfare\nreform law, the Personal Responsibility and\nWork Opportunity Reconciliation Act (Cherlin\nAt the same time, the prevalence of nonmari-\ntal births has grown considerably, both among\nblacks and other racial and ethnic groups\n(McLanahan 2009). This growth, illustrated in\nFig. 1, engendered further debate about the\nnature of nonmarital childbearing and whether\nits widespread increase should be cause for\nconcern.\nHowever, in the 1990s, empirical data on\nunmarried parents and their children was limited\nalternately posited that children born to unmar-\nried parents were the result of encounters so\ncasual that mothers might not know who the\nfathers were, or that nonmarital childbearing in\nthe United States might resemble that in other\nWestern industrialized countries in which com-\nmitted, cohabiting parents raised children within\nthe same stable unions as a married couple,\n\"lacking only the piece of paper.\" Still others\nsuggested that while unmarried parents might be\ncommitted to each other and their children, the\nAmerican welfare state did not provide the sup-\nport of those in other Western industrialized\ncountries, leaving the family units at risk\nAt the point when these debates were most\nsalient, the literature on single parenthood and\nfather absence focused predominantly on wid-\nows and divorced families (McLanahan and\nSandefur 1994), who researchers suspected dif-\nfered significantly from parents who never mar-\nried. Some basic demographic information was\navailable about the women who gave birth while\nunmarried, but very little was known about the\nfathers of their children or about the social and\ncultural environments in which their children\ngrew up (McLanahan 2009). Still less was\nknown about the health development outcomes\nof children born outside of marriage or the role\nof the family and social environment in their\ndevelopment.\nDevelopment of the Fragile\nFamilies and Child Wellbeing\nStudy\nTo build a sound evidence base on the causes and\nconsequences of nonmarital childbearing, a team\nof researchers at Columbia and Princeton\nUniversities developed and implemented a large\nnational survey, the Fragile Families and Child\nWellbeing Study (FFCWS).The \"Fragile Families\"\nmoniker was carefully chosen and derived from\nthe Ford Foundation's \"Strengthening Fragile\nFamilies\" initiative of the 1990s (Sorensen et al.\n2002). Although a variety of family transitions\ncarried the potential for resulting instability \u00ad\ndivorce and parental death, among others \u00ad the\nterm \"Fragile Families\" referred specifically to\nfamilies in which parents were not married at the\ntime a child was born (ibid.). The word \"fragile\"\nreferred to the risks that unmarried parents faced\nin terms of their economic and relationship sta-\nbility, while the word \"families\" was used in rec-\nognition that unmarried partners with children\nrepresent a cohesive family unit (ibid.).1\nThe FFCWS was designed to address four key\nquestions raised by the Moynihan Report and sub-\nsequent public discourse (Reichman et al. 2001).\n1To avoid potential stigma associated with the term \"frag-\nile,\" families participating in the FFCWS were approached\nusing more neutral terms and asked to participate in the\n\"Survey of Parents.\"\nWhite Black Hispanic All Races\nFig.1 Unmarried births\nas a percent of US\n(National Center for\nHealth Statistics;\nNational Vital Statistics\nSystem).

How do parents and children fare in fragile\nfamilies, and how does family structure and\nstability affect child wellbeing and\ndevelopment?\nThe study has since expanded to become a key\nsource of information about family relationships\nand the broader social environment and their\neffects on child health development and wellbe-\ning. At time of writing, the FFCWS is in the mid-\ndle of its sixth wave of data collection, and the\nchildren born at the study baseline are turning\n15 years old. The study is a joint effort by the\nPrinceton University Center for Research on Child\nWellbeing (CRCW) and Center for Health and\nWellbeing, the Columbia Population Research\nCenter (CPRC), and the National Center for\nChildren and Families (NCCF) at Columbia\nUniversity.

The study's funding has\ncome from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National\nInstitute of Child Health and Human Development,\nas well as a variety of other government and pri-\nvate funders, listed in Appendix A. More than 730\nscholarly articles, theses, books, and abstracts\nhave used the FFCWS data, which has also been\nused to inform testimony to policymakers at the\nnational, state, and local levels (e.g., Sorensen\nThe FFCWS and Life Course\nHealth Development Research\nThe FFCWS has several features that make it ide-\nally suited for life course health development\nresearch on children. The Life Course Health\nDevelopment (LCHD) model (see Halfon and\nForrest 2017) views health as a \"dynamic, emer-\ngent capacity that develops continuously over the\nlifespan, in a complex, nonlinear process\" form-\ning health development trajectories that are influ-\nenced by physical and social environmental as\nwell as personal and genetic factors. Specifically,\nthe model lays out seven principles of health\ndevelopment (ibid.):\n1. Health is an emergent set of developmental\ncapacities.\n2. Health develops continuously over the life\nspan.\n3. Health development is a complex, nonlinear\nprocess occurring in multiple dimensions and\nat multiple levels and phases.\n4. Health development is sensitive to the timing\nand social structuring of environmental expo-\nsures and experience.\n5. Health development is an adaptive process\nthat has been engendered by evolution with\nstrategies to promote resilience and plasticity\nin the face of changing and often constraining\nenvironmental contexts.\n6. Optimal health development promotes survival,\nenhances thriving, and protects against disease.\n7. Health development is sensitive to the timing\nand synchronization of molecular, physiologi-\ncal, behavioral, social, and cultural function.\nUsing the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) in Life Course Health Development Research\nHealth is a broad set of developmental capaci-\nties that are in constant and dynamic transactions\nwith individuals' biological, physical, and social\nenvironments (National Research Council and\nInstitute of Medicine 2004). The FFCWS mea-\nsures children's environments across all of these\ndomains: the study contains biological indicators\nof children's wellbeing from the time of their\nbirth, including low birthweight (Reichman and\nTeitler 2006) and overweight and obesity (Kimbro\nIn many cases the FFCWS is even able to study\nchildren's prenatal environments through their\nmothers' hospital records (Reichman and\nrecently, the study has also started to collect\ngenetic data, to enable examination of gene-envi-\nronment interactions (Mitchell et al. 2014).\nThe FFCWS also contains rich information on\nchildren's physical environments, examining fac-\ntors with significant influence on health develop-\nment throughout the life course. The study\ncollects data on the homes and neighborhoods in\nwhich children live, exposure to lead (Boutwell\nand other neighborhood conditions.\nOne of the richest contributions of the FFCWS\nis its measurement of the social environment in\nwhich children are raised. According to the theo-\nretical principles of life course health develop-\nment, health development is a multilevel\nconstruct, and the FFCWS measures children's\nsocial environments at many of the levels that\ninfluence their health development throughout\nthe life course: the family (both biological par-\nents and the social unit that comprises the house-\nchildcare settings (Rigby et al. 2007), schools\n(Razza et al. Forthcoming), neighborhoods\n(Suglia et al. 2013), and broader contexts such as\nstates or local labor markets (Rigby et al. 2007;\nIn addition to the rich multilevel data con-\ntained in the FFCWS, another significant contri-\nbution the study makes to life course research is\nits unique sampling strategy (detailed below in\nSect. 2.1). Given the study's focus on unmarried\nparents and nonmarital childbearing, the study\nsystematically oversamples unmarried couples,\nwho face disproportionate socioeconomic\n\npermits the observation of these challenges on a\npopulation level, and enables the identification of\nfactors that might exacerbate risk or promote\nresilience among children. By nature of the\nFFCWS sampling plan, the data also contain\nlarge samples of racial and ethnic minority fami-\nlies, who are often underrepresented in popula-\ntion-based surveys (Reichman et al. 2001).\nAnother contribution of the FFCWS is the\nlongitudinal nature of its data collection. The\nstudy contains rich information on children's\nenvironments, health status throughout infancy,\nearly childhood, school entry, and middle child-\nhood, which permits the construction of health\ndevelopment trajectories. As important as these\nperiods are for long-term health and wellbeing\nvery few population-based American datasets\ntrack birth cohorts or begin in infancy or early\nchildhood (though see Flanagan and West 2004\nfor information on the Early Childhood\nLongitudinal Study, a notable exception).\nThe longitudinal birth cohort structure of the\nFFCWS, coupled with the rich data it collects on\nmultiple domains of health and health determi-\nnants, permits the joint analysis of children's\nphysical and emotional health development, both\nof which develop continuously over the life span.\nHealth development and environmental con-\nstructs are tracked over time, with indicators\neither measured repeatedly or updated to be age-\nappropriate, as needed. These measures are there-\nfore able to capture the time-sensitive nature of\nchild development. Children (and adults) experi-\nence several key transitions throughout the life\ncourse (e.g., school entry, puberty, etc.), which\nrequire new modes of adaptation to biological,\npsychological, or social changes (Elder 1985;\nGraber and Brooks-Gunn 1996). Events they\nexperience \u00ad both positive and negative \u00ad may\nalso serve as turning points that alter their life\ncourse trajectories (Elder 1985; Sampson and\nLaub 1990). The effects of turning points and\nother key exposures on life course trajectories\nmay further be linked to the timing of these\nA. Geller et al.\nexposures with respect to developmental transi-\ntions (Graber and Brooks-Gunn 1996).An impor-\ntant strength of the FFCWS is its observation of\n\nexposures to key influences, and measurement of\nchildren's risk and resilience, throughout their\nhealth developmental trajectories.\nThe rest of this chapter proceeds as follows.\nSection 2 lays out the sampling plan and study\ndesign of the FFCWS. Section 3 provides an\ninventory of the data available at time of writing.\nSection 4 provides greater detail on how the\nFFCWS data may be used for life course health\ndevelopment research. Section 5 lays out future\nplans for the FFCWS. Section 6 concludes with\nresources available for FFCWS data users.\n2 Study Design\nThe FFCWS was designed to provide informa-\ntion on unmarried couples and their newborn\nchildren (McLanahan et al. 2010). Previous\nefforts to describe these \"fragile families\" were\nlimited by the challenges in collecting data on\nunmarried fathers (Reichman et al. 2001). What\nlittle was known about men who fathered chil-\ndren outside of marriage suggested that they were\nyounger and less educated than men who father\nchildren within marriage, with lower incomes\nand fewer attachments to the labor market\nThese fathers also reported more disability, more\ndepression, and a greater prevalence of risky\nhealth behaviors such as drinking and substance\nuse (ibid.). These factors create challenges in\nrecruiting and retaining them in population-based\nsurveys (Aday and Cornelius 2006). Unmarried\nfathers also are less likely to be their children's\nlegal guardians and to have fewer formal ties to\ntheir families, and may be harder to locate as a\nresult. Accordingly, it is also likely that data\nobtained from prior household surveys under-\nstated the disadvantage faced by families with\nunmarried fathers.\nThe FFCWS focused its study design around\nthe objective of obtaining information about\npreviously understudied, unmarried, and often\n\nnonresident fathers. Early pilot studies sug-\ngested that unmarried fathers were often present\nat the birth of their child, and that both parents\nwere willing to be interviewed at this time\n(Reichman et al. 2001). Baseline data collection\nwas designed around this \"magic moment,\" and\nboth mothers and fathers were initially con-\ntacted for interview while in the hospital, shortly\nafter their child's birth. Sampling from hospitals\nalso provided a spatial clustering of new parents\nthat both improved response rates and kept\nrecruitment and interview costs manageable.\n2.1 Sampling Strategy\nThe FFCWS was based on a multistage stratified\nrandom sample: cities were sampled, then hospi-\ntals within cities, and then births within hospitals.\nThe sampling of cities was based on all cities in\nmore. Some of the cities in the sampling frame\nlying suburban areas were included, while some\ncities were considered only in terms of their inner\ncity \u00ad the definition of each city was drawn from\nits vital statistics (Reichman et al. 2001). These\ncities were then characterized by their policy\nenvironments, as defined by three variables: the\nwelfare generosity, the strength of the local labor\nmarket, and the strength of local child support\nfor further details on the scoring of policy\nenvironments.)\nEach city's welfare, labor market, and child\nsupport regimes were scored on a three-point\nscale: low, medium, or high welfare generosity\nand strong, medium, or weak labor markets and\nchild support enforcement policies. Cities were\nthen sorted into two groups: those with only\nextreme values (low or high) for all three dimen-\nsions (leaving 8 different \"extreme cells\") and\ncities with at least one middle value (19 remain-\ning cells). One city was sampled from each of\nthe 8 extreme cells, and 8 additional cities were\nUsing the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) in Life Course Health Development Research\nrandomly sampled from the 19 remaining cities,\nwith selection probability based on city popula-\ntions. In the 8 \"extreme policy\" cities, the plan\nwas to collect data on 250 nonmarital births and\n75 marital births, for a total of 325. In the other\n8 cities, the plan was to sample a total of 100\nbirths. The \"large sample\" cities provided an\nability to understand the social and policy envi-\nronment and social processes within cities, as\nwell as differences between cities. The eight\n\"small sample\" cities, selected from the cells\nwith at least one middle value, improved the\nability to observe nonlinearities in the effects of\nwelfare, child support, and labor markets.\nThe 16 cities randomly selected along the sys-\ntematic stratified sampling plan comprise the\n\"national sample\" of the FFCWS.3 Four addi-\ntional cities were added to the study, given their\nspecial substantive interest to funders. Table 1\nlists the cities sampled in the FFCWS, whether\nthey were selected as part of the national (i.e.,\nrandom) sample and their baseline sample sizes.\nThe FFCWS is not only designed to be nation-\nally representative of births in large cities but to\noffer detailed case studies of the included cities\nthemselves. Hospitals were systematically sam-\npled in order to increase coverage of nonmarital\nbirths, which led to a full sample of 75 hospitals\n(see Reichman et al. 2001, for the full list of\n3Two cities (Baltimore and San Jose) were selected in a\nsecond round of sampling, when the research team was\nunable to gain access to hospitals in two of their initially\nsampled cities (Birmingham, AL and Santa Ana, CA).\nincluded hospitals). Within each hospital, moth-\ners of new babies were sampled from maternity\nward lists. Once sampled, mothers were asked to\ncomplete a screening instrument to determine\nmarital status and eligibility for participation in\nthe study. Quotas were set at each hospital for the\nnumber of unmarried and married births, based\nrates. Marital and nonmarital births were ran-\ndomly sampled until preset quotas were reached\nfor each hospital. If a mother was determined to\nbe above the set quota for a given marital status,\nthe case was coded \"over quota,\" and the mother\nwas not interviewed. In the rare cases that sur-\nveyed parents had had twins or a higher-order\nmultiple birth, one child was designated the\n\"focal child,\" the child to whom answers to the\nFFCWS refer.\nThe FFCWS oversample of nonmarital births,\ncoupled with the significantly higher rates of\nnonmarital childbearing among blacks and\nHispanics noted in Fig. 1, provided a study sam-\nple with a significantly higher representation of\nnon-white families than most household surveys.\nRacial and ethnic classification of the mothers\nand fathers in the survey are provided in Table 2.\nSeveral subgroups of parents were not\nincluded in the study: those who did not speak\nEnglish or Spanish well enough to complete the\ninterview, those who planned to place the child\nfor adoption, those for whom the father of the\nbaby was deceased, those whose baby died before\nthe interview could take place, those mothers\nwho were too ill to complete the interview (or\nTable 1 Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study cities and sample sizes\nAustin, TX:\nRichmond, VA: N = 327 San Jose, CA:\nToledo, OH:\nBaltimore, MD: N = 338 Corpus Christi, TX: N = 331 Boston, MA:\nSan Antonio, TX:\nDetroit, MI:\nIndianapolis, IN: N = 325 Nashville, TN: N = 102 Pittsburgh, PA:\nNewark, NJ:\nMilwaukee, WI: N = 348 Chicago, IL:\nNorfolk, VA:\naNewark, Oakland, Detroit, and San Jose were strategically selected due to funder interest and therefore are not part of\nthe FFCWS \"national sample\"\nA. Geller et al.\nwhose babies were too ill for the mother to\ncomplete the interview), and, in many hospitals,\nparents who were under 18 and therefore prohib-\nited by the hospital from being interviewed\n(Reichman et al. 2001). Because the study was\ndesigned to examine the roles of mothers and\nfathers in families, the study is also limited to\nbirths to heterosexual couples. As the sample is\nhospital-based, home births and births in other\nvenues are also not represented. With these and\nother slight exceptions, the FFCWS sample is\nrepresentative of the nonmarital births taking\nplace in each city. However, the marital sample is\nnot necessarily representative of marital births in\neach city because in many cities, births were pur-\nposively sampled from hospitals with the highest\nrates of nonmarital births. It is also important to\nnote that the sample is representative of nonmari-\ntal births taking place in each city rather than of\nbirths to residents of each city (Reichman et al.\n2001), since parents giving birth within the city\nmay live elsewhere.\n2.2 Sampling Weights\nDue to the complex sampling design of the\nFFCWS, the data are provided with sampling\nweights to make the data representative of the\nsample cities and of urban births nationally.\nThese weights account for the stratified random\nsample of cities, the sample of hospitals, and the\nsample of births, as well as the clustering of\nbirths by hospital, the oversample of nonmarital\nbirths, the underrepresentation of teen births, and\nmothers' marital status, education, race/ethnicity,\nand age. The survey includes six sets of weights:\nto make the data nationally representative and\nrepresentative of sample cities, for couples and\nfor mothers and fathers separately. These weights\nare provided for the five waves of data currently\navailable, to account not only for design but for\nbaseline nonresponse and attrition over time\nTiming of Interviews\nBaseline interviewing for the FFCWS took\nCouples were subsequently contacted for re-\ninterview in four additional waves, reflecting\nvarious developmental stages of the focal child's\nlife. Interviews took place when the focal chil-\ndren were 1, 3, 5, and 9 years of age, and a sixth\nwave of the study is currently in the field (inter-\nviewing the families while the focal children are\n15 years old.) Due to the short time that elapsed\nbetween the early interviews, some families\nwere interviewed for their Year 1 (Y1) follow-\nup before baseline interviewing was completed\nfor all families, for their Year 3 (Y3) follow-up\nbefore Y1 interviewing was completed, and for\nYear 5 (Y5) follow-up before Y3 interviewing\nwas completed.\nBecause interviews were carried out over\napproximately 3 years in each wave, many of\nthe early interviews provided valuable informa-\ntion to improve the survey while it was ongoing.\nInterviews took place in the first two cities\n(Oakland, CA and Austin, TX) approximately a\nfull year before interviewing began in the\nremaining 18 cities, and the early interviews\nserved as a form of pilot test. If questions were\nnot well understood by the respondents, or\nresponses did not have sufficient variation to\npermit meaningful analysis, these questions\nwere revised before interviewing in the remain-\nIt also bears noting that considerable time\nmay elapse between father and mother inter-\nviews within the same family. Of the families\nin which both mothers and fathers were inter-\nviewed at baseline, more than half (55%) of\nTable 2 Racial and ethnic composition, FFCWS sample\nMothers (%) Fathers (%)\nOther races and ethnicities 4 4\nRace/ethnicity unknown <1 1\nNote: Mothers' race-ethnicity are based on self-reports.\nFathers' race-ethnicity are based on a mix of self-reports\nand mother reports\nUsing the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) in Life Course Health Development Research\ncouples were interviewed on the same day.\nHowever, in more than 10% of families, par-\nents were interviewed more than 1 month apart.\nBy Year 9 (Y9), only 15% of parents who both\nparticipated were interviewed on the same day.\nMore than 30% were interviewed more than 1\nmonth apart from their partners, with a small\nnumber interviewed over a year apart. It is\nquite possible that discrepancies in mothers'\nand fathers' reports of family circumstance\nreflect differences in timing as well as differ-\nences in perspective and other traditional\nsources of measurement error.\nAttrition and Retention\nThe FFCWS has been unusually successful in\ncollecting data on its generally hard-to-reach tar-\nget population. Core response rates are provided\nin Table 3 for mothers and fathers, by their base-\nline marital status. Mothers' baseline response\nrates are computed as the percent of mothers\napproached for interview who agreed to partici-\npate. Fathers' results at baseline are computed as\nthe percent of mothers interviewed at baseline\nwhose partners agreed to participate. Response\nrates in subsequent waves are computed as a per-\ncent of the couples interviewed at baseline who\nparticipated in subsequent waves. Even among\nthe hardest-to-reach population, unmarried\nfathers, the majority of the sample was retained\nin the survey at the 9-year follow-up wave. Nearly\nall fathers (96% of fathers married at baseline\nand 87% of unmarried fathers) were interviewed\nat least once.\nAnother way in which the FFCWS provides\nunique information into its hard-to-reach target\npopulation is by the collection of couple data.\nNot only does the \"magic moment\" of the focal\nchild's birth provide an opportunity to identify\nfathers who might not otherwise be located,\ninformation on these fathers is not only provided\nthrough personal interviews but also through the\ndata collected from their partners. Mothers report\nnot only on their own background and behavior\nand their personal perception of the couple rela-\ntionship, but they also report detailed information\non their partners' own background and behavior.\nThis information includes the fathers' racial and\nethnic background, place of residence, and edu-\ncational attainment, as well as behavioral infor-\nmation such as labor market activity, incarceration\nhistory, parenting behavior, and other aspects of\nfather involvement (e.g., child support payment\nand visitation). Likewise, fathers are asked to\nreport on similar domains of the mothers' back-\nground and behavior.\nCouple data provides value in two important\nways. When both parents are interviewed, con-\ncordance or disagreement between the two\n\nparents' responses can be used to assess many\ndomains of their relationship, subject to differ-\nences in the phrasing of some questions and the\ntiming of each parent's interview. When only one\nparent is interviewed, responses about their part-\nner provide information not directly obtainable.\nThis is particularly important given the factors\nlikely to influence attrition and retention. If the\nfathers least involved with their partners and\nTable 3 Response rates, FFCWS core biological parent survey\nMother Father\nUnmarried (%) Married (%) Unmarried (%) Married (%)\nA. Geller et al.\nchildren are the most likely to leave the survey,\nanalyses based only on those retained are likely\nto be affected by selection bias. Collecting moth-\ners' reports of father characteristics helps to\nreduce this bias.\nCurrent Data Availability\nAs noted, five waves of FFCWS data collection\nhave been completed as of time of writing. A\nsixth wave of data collection is ongoing. Baseline,\nY1, Y3, Y5, and Y9 core follow-up data are\navailable to the public through the data archive at\nthe Office of Population Research (OPR) at\nPrinceton University. These data, excluding Y9,\nare also available through the Inter-university\nConsortium for Political and Social Research\n(ICPSR). In-home data from the Y3, Y5, and Y9\nwaves are also available for a subset of core\nrespondents. Additional data, described below,\nare available to the public via a restricted use\ncontract.\nThe FFCWS restricted-use dataset (also\nknown as the \"contract data\") contain more sen-\nsitive information such as geographic identifiers\n(i.e., the city where the focal child was born and\nstate of respondent residence), census tract char-\nacteristics, local macroeconomic measures,\ngenetic data, medical records data, and school\ncharacteristics. More information on these mea-\nsures is provided in Appendix B. While these\nindicators are invaluable for researchers who are\ninterested in children's local or school environ-\nments, gene-environment interactions, or detailed\ninformation about maternal health, it bears noting\nthat the vast majority of FFCWS research is done\nusing the public-use dataset.\nAccess to the FFCWS contract data is limited\nto researchers who agree to the terms and condi-\ntions contained in the Contract Data Use License.\nAccess is limited to faculty and research person-\nnel at institutions which have an institutional\nreview board (IRB) or human subjects review\ncommittee registered with the US Office for\nHuman Research Protections (OHRP) or the\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH). Researchers\nmust obtain IRB approval of their research and\ndata protection plans. Students may use the\nFFCWS contract data for dissertation research;\nhowever, a faculty advisor must serve as the\ninvestigator and complete the application pro-\ncess, with the student signing a Supplemental\nAgreement with Research Staff form. The faculty\nadvisor and the institution bear full responsibility\nfor ensuring that all conditions of the license are\nmet by the student. Further information about the\ndata access process for both the public- and\nrestricted-use files is available in Appendix B.\nIn every wave, participating mothers and fathers\neach completed a \"core\" survey, administered\nin-person for most baseline interviews and by\nphone in most subsequent interviews. For both\nmothers and fathers, each core interview\nincluded questions on household and family\ncharacteristics (including a household roster and\nparents' marital and coresidence status, as well\nas contact between nonresident parents and the\nfocal child); sociodemographic and background\ncharacteristics; information on parenting behav-\nior; romantic relationships (with the focal bio-\nlogical child's other biological parent or, where\nrelevant, with new partners); details about each\nparent's health, education, employment, and\nincome; as well as indicators of the focal child's\nhealth development and wellbeing. Many of the\nindicators in the core are collected using the\nsame survey questions at each wave, enabling\nlongitudinal analyses of family trajectories.\nDetails on the data collected in the FFCWS core\nare provided in Sect. 4. In addition to the data\navailable in the core, both the FFCWS public-\nand restricted-use files contain several other\nmodules with additional information. These\ninclude in-home observations, supplemental sur-\nveys, official records, and genetic data.\nUsing the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) in Life Course Health Development Research\nIn-Home Module (Public\nand Restricted Use)\nIn addition to the data collected by phone from\nboth mothers and fathers in the FFCWS core\ndata, both the public- and restricted-use files\ninclude an in-home module in the Y3, Y5, and\nY9 waves. The in-home module includes several\nassessments of the child and his or her home\nenvironment and a survey of the child's primary\ncaregiver (PCG), defined as person the focal\nchild lives with at least half the time. The PCG,\nwho can be either the biological mother or father,\nor a nonparental figure such as a grandparent, is\ninterviewed in the Y3, Y5, and Y9 survey waves.\nInterviews include a mix of in-person and self-\nadministered questionnaires conducted in the\nhome and questions asked over the phone.\nThe PCG survey covers information about the\nchild's home and neighborhood environment,\nincluding questions of neighborhood safety, the\navailability of household resources, parenting\nbehaviors, and childcare arrangements. The PCG\nalso provides details of the focal child's health\ndevelopment, which are best reported by the per-\nson the focal child spends the most time with. It\nis notable, however, that which questions are\nanswered in the PCG survey and which are\nanswered by the biological parents in the core\nsurvey vary by wave.\nIn addition, the in-home module in all three\nwaves includes several systematic assessments\nby the interviewer, including the focal child's\ngeneral health and cognitive health develop-\nment, the PCG's health and cognitive abilities,\nand assessments of the home and neighborhood\nenvironment. These include measures of the\nheight and weight of both the PCG and child,\ncognitive tests of both the PCG and child, and\nrecorded observations of interactions between\nthe PCG and child.\nIn the most recent wave (Y9), the in-home\nassessment also includes an interview of the focal\nchild. In the \"child survey,\" the focal child pro-\nvides his or her perspective on the home environ-\nment, including relationships with each of their\nbiological parents, as well as any new partners\nthat the parents are married to or living with. The\nchild also reports on the extent of discipline and\nmonitoring provided by their primary caregiver\nand discipline provided by each of their biologi-\ncal parents and any new partners. The focal child\nalso reports on relationships with his or her sib-\nlings and how and with whom he or she spends\ntime. He or she provides self-reports of personal\ninformation that might not be accurately assessed\nby the parents or PCG, including health, personal\nsafety, his or her school environment, school con-\nnectedness, bullying and bully victimization, and\nseveral aspects of behavior, including early delin-\nquent behavior.\nChildcare Provider and Teacher\nSurveys (Public\nand Restricted Use)\nIn the Y3 survey, families using nonparental\nchildcare for at least 7 hours per week, and one\nconsistent childcare arrangement for at least\n5 hours per week, were asked if a representative\nof the childcare program could be interviewed. A\nsubset of these parents and childcare providers\nconsented to be interviewed and observed. The\nchildcare provider survey included information\non the focal child's behavior, social skills, and\nlearning, as well as characteristics of the pro-\ngram. In many cases the interviewer also observed\ninteractions between the provider and the child.\nIn Y5 and Y9, the focal child's teachers were\nalso asked to participate in the survey. Teachers\nwho agreed completed a self-administered\nquestionnaire and provided characteristics of\ntheir classroom, the school climate, and their\nassessment of the child's behavior, social skills,\nand learning, as well as the parents' involve-\nment. The teacher surveys did not include\nadministrative details of the school itself; fur-\nther information provided on the child's school\nis provided in the restricted-use file and\ndescribed in Sect. 2.4.\n3.2.3 Medical Records (Restricted Use\nOnly)\nApproximately 75% of the mothers interviewed\nat the FFCWS baseline gave permission for their\nmedical records to be abstracted for analysis.\nThese records contain detailed quantitative and\nqualitative data on the mother's health and\nA. Geller et al.\nhealthcare history, including details of her repro-\nductive history, such as how many previous preg-\nnancies she had had before the focal child was\nborn, and how much weight she gained during\nthe pregnancy. The FFCWS medical records data\nalso contain other anthropomorphic measures\n(such as the mother's weight and the child's birth\nweight), indicators of chemical substances in the\nbody at the time of the birth, and diagnoses,\nincluding both physical and mental health. The\nmedical records data provides a rich narrative of\nthe mother's health at the time of the birth and\nserves to identify inconsistencies in maternal\nself-reports.\nSchool Characteristics File\n(Restricted Use Only)\nAt the Y9 follow-up survey, data on the focal\nchild's school was collected by the National\nCenter for Education Statistics (NCES).Although\nthe names and locations of the school are not\nreleased in the restricted-use file, a unique identi-\nfier is provided for each school in the file, so that\nchildren attending the same school can be identi-\nfied. The NCES data include information on\nwhether the school is a public or private school,\nthe school's grade span (i.e., the grades taught in\nthe school), the racial composition of the student\npopulation, Title I funding and eligibility (United\nStates Department of Education 2014), an indica-\ntor of socioeconomic disadvantage among the\nstudents, and the percent of the student body eli-\ngible for free or reduced price lunches.\n3.2.5 \"Neighborhood\"Contextual\nData File (Restricted Use Only)\nNeighborhood data for both mothers and fathers\nare measured at each wave. \"Neighborhoods\" in\nthe FFCWS are defined as each parent's census\ntract of residence, though to protect respondent\nprivacy, the tract identifiers are coded, and\nrespondents cannot be matched to a specific tract\nin the restricted-use files. In addition, some ran-\ndom noise has been introduced into the data to\nensure that respondents' census tracts cannot be\nidentified from the data. This noise should have\nno impact on analyses. The contextual data file is\nbased on the US Census and contains information\non the tracts'racial composition, local employment\nand income levels, housing characteristics and\nrent, and receipt of public assistance.\nMacroeconomic Data File\n(Restricted Use Only)\nIn addition to tract-level contextual data, the\nFFCWS has recently released broader contex-\ntual data for restricted use. The macroeco-\nnomic data file contains information on the\nnational and local economic climate facing\nboth mothers and fathers in the month of their\ninterview. This file is based on MSA-level data\nfrom the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, on\nemployment, unemployment, and labor force\nparticipation in the MSA containing their sam-\nple city, as well as monthly population data in\nboth the MSA and sample state. The file also\ncontains national-level data from the Survey of\nConsumers on the Consumer Sentiment Index\nin the month of interview. These data, coupled\nwith the fact that Y9 data collection in the\nFFCWS took place between August 2007 and\nMarch 2010, permit unique analyses of the\nGreat Recession and the effects of economic\ndownturns on families and children (Pilkauskas\nGenetic Data (Restricted Use\nOnly)\nIn the Y9 wave of data collection, in addition to\nthe survey data collected from parents, children,\nand teachers, and the administrative data col-\nlected to supplement the surveys, the in-home\nmodule included the collection of genetic data.\nMore than half of families in the study \u00ad and\nmore than 75% of families participating in theY9\nin-home survey \u00ad provided noninvasive saliva\nsamples for genotyping. The goal of the genetic\ndata collection was to allow researchers to\ndirectly incorporate genetic information into\ntheir models of family relationships and child\ndevelopment and to test hypotheses about the\nrelationships between genes, environment, and\nchild health development. Saliva samples were\nsealed into containers with a liquid preservative\nand mailed to the survey subcontractor, where\nthey were in turn shipped to the Princeton\nUsing the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) in Life Course Health Development Research\nUniversity Molecular Biology laboratory, where\ngenetic information was extracted and quantified\ninto genetic markers such as single nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) and telomere length\nThe genetic data file includes results from the\ngenotyping of several candidate polymorphisms\nhypothesized to influence child health develop-\nment through their interactions with children's\nsocial environments. These candidate polymor-\nphisms include serotonin transporters, dopa-\nmine transporter, dopamine D2 receptor,\ndopamine D4 receptor, catechol-O-methyltrans-\nferase, melanocortin 4 receptor, transmembrane\nprotein, and tryptophan hydroxylase. Further\ninformation on the specific polymorphisms\nincluded in the data file, the genotyping process\nand quality control mechanisms for each, and\nvaluable references for the study of gene-envi-\nronment interactions, are available through the\nCenter for Research on Child Wellbeing (2015).\nAt the time of writing, additional data are being\ndeveloped in conjunction with active research\nprograms, for future release. Data users are\nencouraged to check the FFCWS home page for\nup-to-date information.\nModule Participation Rates\nAlthough not all of the data collection modules\nwere completed for each family at each wave, the\nmajority of modules were completed for a sub-\nstantial majority of families at the waves they were\noffered. Table 4 provides the participation rates for\neach of the data collection modules by wave.\nUsing the FFCWS\nAs noted in Sect. 3.1, FFCWS data can be\nobtained through two different processes: public\naccess and the contract process for accessing\nrestricted-use data. The access details described\nin this section apply only to the public-use file.\nThe remainder of this section lays out details of\nthe FFCWS data, which apply to both the public-\nand restricted-use data.\nThe FFCWS public-use files can be accessed\nthrough a two-step process: users must first reg-\nister with the data archive at the Princeton\nUniversity Office of Population Research and\nthensignupforaccesstotheFFCWS.Registration\napplications are usually reviewed within one\nbusiness day. Public-use files, not including Y9,\nare also available through the Inter-university\nConsortium for Political and Social Research\n(ICPSR); however, the Princeton archive has\nthe most current data files and is preferential for\nscientific research. Access protocols for the\nTable 4 Participation rates, FFCWS modules by wave\nChildcare provider/teacher\nsurvey\nNeighborhood contextual\ndata file\nA. Geller et al.\nrestricted-use file are available from the Center\nfor Research on Child Wellbeing at Princeton\nIn both the public- and restricted-use datasets,\nthe FFCWS data are structured with one record\nper child and identified with a unique family\nidentifier, a string variable called idnum. At\neach wave, mother and father data are stored in\nseparate files and can be merged using the\nidnum variable to match members of the same\nfamily. The other modules described in Sect. 3\ncan also be merged to the core data using the\nidnum variable. Each core dataset has records\nfor all 4898 families, regardless of whether\neach parent was interviewed. Flag variables\nindicate whether or not a mother or father was\ninterviewed at a given wave, and cases who\ndidn't participate in a given interview/wave are\ncoded as \"not in wave\" on all other variables.4\n4.3 Variable Documentation\nThe complete merged FFCWS dataset contains\nety of domains used in life course health develop-\nment research. These include parents'\ndemographic information, parental relationships,\nrelationships the parents may form with new\npartners, relationships between each parent and\nthe focal child, relationships between parents'\nnew partners and the focal child, child wellbeing,\nhealth, behavior, and other aspects of health\ndevelopment. The data also contain information\non the focal child's physical and social environ-\nments, including parental employment, house-\n4In Y9, there were several types of interviews a PCG may\nhave participated in, so it was possible for them to be\ncoded as \"not in wave\" for one interview but to participate\nin a different interview, technically in the same wave. For\nexample, a mother who is the PCG might have partici-\npated in the mother core survey but not completed the\nPCG self-administered questionnaire.\nhold income and economic wellbeing, parental\nhealth and behavior, parental incarceration, social\nsupport and other family relationships, housing\nand neighborhood quality, and access to govern-\nment programs. Not all domains are covered in\neach wave of the FFCWS and where each domain\nappears in the survey varies across waves. Each\ntopic can be located within the five available\nwaves using the FFCWS Core Question Map\n(CRCW 2009b), which lists in which waves a\ngiven topic appears; whether a topic is covered\nby mothers, fathers, or both; and in which section\nof the survey. Additionally, there is an In-Home\nQuestionnaire Map for Y3 and Y5. Complete\nquestionnaires are also available on the docu-\nmentation page of the FFCWS website.\nand Construction\nOther than the variable idnum, which identifies\nfamilies across data modules, core FFCWS vari-\nables are named according to a consistent con-\nvention. Core variable names begin with either\nan m or an f, depending on whether it was reported\nby the mother or father, respectively, followed by\nan indicator of the wave in which it was asked\nand 5 = 9 years), followed by a letter and number\nto indicate the section and question where it\nappears in the survey instrument. For example,\nthe variable m1a12 refers to the mother's base-\nline survey and the 12th question of section a.\nVariables from the in-home survey are stored in\nseparate modules and are numbered only with a\nletter and number to indicate section and ques-\ntion.5 The Y9 dataset includes several additional\nvariable prefixes to accommodate the additional\nVariables in the FFCWS data are also charac-\nterized by a consistent schema for responses and\n5It is important to note that many variable names are used\nin both the Y3 and Y5 in-home modules, and will need to\nbe renamed for unique identification, usually by adding\nprefixes (i.e., ih3, ih4), if the variables are used together in\na single data file. Future data updates may correct for this\nby including variable prefixes.\nUsing the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) in Life Course Health Development Research\nmissing data. All substantive responses appear in\nthe data as positive numbers. Nonnumeric vari-\nables are also coded as positive integers, and their\nsubstantive meaning is indicated in the question-\nnaires and embedded variable labels. (For exam-\nple, \"Yes\" answers are usually coded as 1, and\n\"No\" answers are usually coded as 2.) Missing\nresponses are indicated with negative numbers,\nwith different negative values indicating different\nreasons that the data are missing. Details on the\nmissing data codes are provided in Table 5.\nThe FFCWS dataset also includes numerous\nvariables constructed by CRCW staff to ensure\nthat commonly used concepts are coded consis-\ntently by all users. At baseline, examples of con-\nstructed variables include the baby's sex, whether\nor not the birth was of multiple children (i.e.,\ntwins), whether the baby had low birth weight\n(i.e., less than 2500 grams), the ethnicity and race\nof both parents, and each parent's educational\nattainment at baseline. At Y1, additional vari-\nables were constructed to note the mother's age\nwhen she first had a baby and the total number of\nbiological children she had. At Y3, variables\nwere constructed to indicate each parent's cogni-\ntive ability (Wechsler 1981). Several other vari-\nables were constructed to indicate household\ncomposition (along with a second variable to\nindicate whether the child's grandparents lived in\nthe household), fathers' incarceration histories,\nwhether each parent reported depression and\nanxiety, and several details of the interview\nitself \u00ad whether it was conducted in Spanish,\nwhether each parent was interviewed, and\nwhether the primary caregiver participated in the\nin-home study.\nThe FFCWS data, collected through multiple meth-\nods, contains a rich set of child health and behav-\nioral indicators, measures of parental resources and\nbehavior, as well as indicators of parents' physical\nmental health, health behaviors, incarceration histo-\nries, and relationship stability before and since the\nfocal birth. A summary of information collected to\ndate is provided in Table 6, along with the modes of\ncollection used for each class of data.\nTracking Constructs Over Time\nOne of the strengths of the FFCWS for life\ncourse health development research is the con-\nsistent measure of multiple substantive con-\nstructs across waves of the study. Many of the\nquestions on child health were asked in each\nwave: parents or primary caregivers are asked to\nreport the focal child's general health status,\nwhether he or she has any physical disabilities,\nand whether he or she has had any experience\nwith asthma \u00ad a diagnosis or an attack, with par-\nticular attention to whether the attack required a\nvisit to the emergency room. Parents and care-\ngivers are also asked to report children's medical\nvisits at each wave, including doctor's visits for\npreventive care, illnesses, and accidents, as well\nTable 5 Missing data codes in the FFCWS\nNumeric\ncode Meaning Explanation\nwave\nRespondent was not\ninterviewed in wave\nrange\nRare code suggests the\nresponse was not appropriate\nfor the question\n-7 Did not\napply\nAlso indicated at times by\n-6 Skipped\nquestion\nQuestion skips are usually\ndictated by survey design,\nindicating that a given\nquestion did not apply to a\ngiven respondent or the\nanswer could be inferred from\ninformation already provided\n-5 Not asked This code is most often used\nwhen a question was added or\ntaken away following the\nOakland and Austin \"pilot\"\ninterviews.

These measures may be recon-\nciled by analyzing only the eight indicators that\nappear in all three waves or can be used in their\ndiffering format. Still other characteristics, par-\nticularly those related to child health develop-\nment, would be inappropriate to measure in the\nsame way in all waves (e.g., questions on child\nbehavior, cognitive development, and puberty\nonset). The FFCWS measures are selected and\ndesigned to be age-appropriate at the time they\nare asked. Researchers maintain considerable\nflexibility in ways to model child cognitive and\nbehavioral health trajectories over time.\n5 Looking Ahead\nIn addition to the rich data that has been collected\nin the FFCWS to date, the study is currently in\nthe field for a new round of data collection. This\ndata collection is timed around the focal child's\ndesigned to improve understanding of how chil-\ndren's experiences in early and middle childhood\ninfluence adolescent behaviors. Adolescence is a\ncritical period in human development when chil-\ndren engage in both positive and negative behav-\niors with lasting consequences for future health\nand wellbeing. The new wave of the FFCWS will\nprovide new information about how children's\nadolescent outcomes are influenced by their\nexperiences in infancy and early childhood.\nData in the Y15 wave is being collected\nthrough a series of new measures, as well as\nmeasures from existing waves that have been\nexpanded to capture children's experiences\ndirectly from their self-report. Key areas of\nexpansion include sexual activity (and particu-\nlarly risky sexual activity), school performance\nand engagement, delinquency, civic and extra-\ncurricular participation, pro-social behaviors,\npubertal development, substance use and abuse,\nsleep, physical activity, eating, multimedia\nexposure, and a variety of other measures of\nadolescent health and wellbeing. The Y15 survey\nis also collecting data on the focal child's rela-\ntionships with both his or her biological parents,\nany new partners, and siblings, in order to under-\nstand how family complexity and instability\ninfluence family interactions and adolescent\nwellbeing. Finally, the Y15 wave will include\nnew collection of genetic information through\nadditional saliva samples.\nThe new data will facilitate research on topics\nrelated to adolescent risk; the role of the family in\nshaping adolescent outcomes; racial and ethnic,\ngender, and income disparities in adolescent\nhealth development; and the role of gene-envi-\nronment interactions in adolescent development.\nData collection is scheduled to be completed by\n2017, and the data will be cleaned and released\nfor limited and public use in the coming years.\nKey Resources for Users\nIn addition to the rich data resources available in\nthe FFCWS, Princeton's Center for Research on\nChild Wellbeing (CRCW) and the Columbia\nPopulation Research Center (CPRC), as the\nhome institutions of the study, devote consider-\nable material and intellectual resources to the\ncommunity of data users. In addition to the data\nand extensive documentation available online,\nCRCW staff maintain an online database of\nworking papers and publications using the\nFFCWS. Data users are encouraged to publish\ntheir working papers and submit their publica-\ntions for inclusion in the database. CRCW also\npublishes a series of research briefs based on\nFFCWS publications, which are both available\nfrom the FFCWS website and distributed to a\nbroad audience of researchers, policymakers,\nand advocates. Finally, CRCW staff are available\nto answer questions about the study. In addition,\nA.
