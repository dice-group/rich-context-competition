Our objective was to develop test procedures using family data from complex\nsurveys such as NHANES III. We developed six Pearson 2 based tests for a diallelic locus of autosomal genes. The finite\nsample properties of the proposed test procedures were evaluated via Monte Carlo simulation studies and the Rao-Scott\nfirst order corrected test was recommended. Test procedures were applied to three loci from NHANES III genetic\ndatabases, i.e., ADRB2, TGFB1, and VDR. HWE was shown to hold at 0.05 level for all three loci when only families\nwith genotypic information available for two parents and for one or more children were used in the analysis.\nKeywords: Complex sampling, Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, inbreeding coefficient, Pearson 2 based test, Rao-\nScott first order correction\nIntroduction\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES), conducted periodically since 1960 by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Cen-\nters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has pro-\nvided national estimates of the health and nutritional status\nof the U.S. civilian, non-institutionalized population. The\nThird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) began in the fall of 1988 and ended in the\nfall of 1994.

At the first stage of the sampling, the target population\nis partitioned into primary sampling units (PSU), e.g., coun-\nties. The PSUs are then grouped into strata. Within each\nstratum, PSUs are sampled often with probability propor-\ntional to the population size. At the next stage,the sampled\nPSUs are subdivided into smaller geographic units, such as\ncity blocks, and a random sample of these units are selected.\nAdditional stages of sampling may be used where smaller units\nare sampled from the sampled units at the second stage. At\nthe last stage of sampling, individuals are sampled from the\nsampled units. For each individual, the inverse of the product\nof the selection probabilities across all of the stages of sampling\nis their sample weight.\nA complex sampling plan adds at least two complexities to\nthe data analyses. First, cluster sampling may induce correla-\ntion between individual observations within sampled clusters.\nThe standard errors can be underestimated if this correlation is\nignored. Second, varying selection probabilities used to sam-\nple individuals produce different sample weights for surveyed\nsubjects. If these sample weights are correlated with the ob-\nservations then an analysis that does not take this into account\nJournal compilation C 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/University College London\nD. She et al.\ncan be biased (Korn & Graubard, 1999). Test procedures de-\nveloped for simple random samples are generally unsuitable\nfor the analysis of data from these complex sample designs.\nThe classic question when looking into the genetic varia-\ntions in a population is whether the population is in the state\nof Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), which has been a\npowerful research tool ever since its discovery in the early\ndeparture from HWE have been proposed under different\nThe analysis of family data for HWE has been proposed\nby Bourgain et al. (2004) in the setting of random samples.\nLi & Graubard proposed using Wald-like tests for HWE in\na complex survey setting assuming that all individuals were\nindependent (Li & Graubard, 2008). Our objective was to\ndevelop procedures for testing departure from HWE using\nfamily data in a complex survey setting. Our methods differ\nfrom that of Bourgain et al. (2004) in that our methods were\ndeveloped for complex survey samples while Bourgain et al.\ndeveloped their method for random samples, though both of\nthe methods deal with family data. The family structure was\nignored by Li and Graubard (2008), which was taken into\nconsideration when we developed our test procedures.\nMethods\nSurveys with a complex sampling plan, such as NHANES III,\noften have a multi-stage design. At the first stage of the sam-\npling, the target population is partitioned into primary sampling\nunits (PSU). The PSUs are then grouped into strata. Within each\nstratum, some numbers of PSUs are sampled. Later, individuals\nor households with different weights are sampled from PSUs. Li\npointed out that the effect of pooling random mating subgroups\nwith different allele frequencies is equivalent to that of inbreed-\ning in the total population (Li, 1969). Therefore, for stratified\nsampling data, the first step of testing HWE is to test the homo-\ngeneity across all stratified subgroups. Our work is restricted to\nthe situation that all stratified subgroups are homogeneous, i.e.,\nno population substructure exists.\nIn a simple random sampling setting, assuming a diallelic locus\n(i.e., A and a) of autosomal genes, there are 27 possible genotype\ncombinations among father, mother, and child. When the mating\norders of father and mother do not need to be distinguished,\nthese 27 combinations reduce to ten possibilities. Let p be the\nfrequency of allele A and q = 1-p be the frequency of allele a.\nAssuming HWE, the joint genotype distribution of parents-child\ntriads are given in Table 1.\nWe consider K families with two parents and one child and\nassume families are independent of each other. Let n = (n1, n2, n3,\nTable 1 Joint distributions of three genotypes from parents-child\ntriads\nGenotype\nFamilial Type Parents Child Joint Probability Count\nfamilies in each category, and K = 10\nni is the total number\nof families. The null hypothesis of interest, denoted by H0, is\nthat HWE holds in the population. If H0 holds, then n has a\nmultinomial distribution with parameter vector (K; (p)), where\nDeparture from HWE can be tested using Pearson chi-square\ntest statistics given by:\nA\n= (n, ^\np)T M(n, ^\np)(n, ^\np),\nwhere ^\n+\nn9)/(4K), which is the maximum likelihood estimator of p,\n(n, ^\np) = (n - ( ^\np))T, which is the observed number of fam-\nilies minus the estimated expected number of families in each\ncategory, and\nM(n, ^\np) =\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK ^\n.\n: .\n: ...\n.\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\nAssume that K families with two parents and one child have\nbeen sampled in a complex survey and the rth family has a sample\nweight wr .

The fol-\nlowing parameters were controlled in the same manner used by\nLi and Graubard (2008): 1) H, the number of strata; 2) L, the\nnumber of sampled PSUs per stratum; 3) m, the number of sam-\npled parents-child triads per PSU per stratum; and 4) w, the\nweight assigned to each parent-child triad. In addition to these\nparameters, we also controlled 1) F, the inbreeding coefficient\nfor population substructure or cryptic relatedness; and 2) p, the\nfrequency of allele A.\nWe set H to 23 and L to 2, which reflect the design of the\nsecond phase of NHANES III, for all simulation studies.

The six Pearson 2\nstatistic based test statistics are 1) the weighted version of\nchi-square test statistic 2\n; 2) the Rao-Scott first order\nadjusted test statistic 2\n(1); 3) the Satterthwaite second\norder adjusted test statistic 2\n(2); 4) the F-version statistic\n(2); 5) the Wald test statistic 2\nA,Wald\n; and\n6) the F-version statistic F A,Wald of 2\nA,Wald\n.\nProperties of proposed test procedures were evaluated via\nMonte Carlo simulations. The first order corrected test main-\ntained type I error rates closest to the nominal level for all three\nchosen allele A frequencies. It achieved little power when F,\nthe inbreeding coefficient, was 0.01. The power achieved\nby the first order corrected test exceeded 90% when F was\nset 0.05. Among all the tests developed by Li and Graubard\n(2008), which assumed that all individuals were independent\nof each other, the F-version of the Wald test had type I er-\nror rates closest to the nominal level but could be slightly\nanti-conservative.\nUnder the null hypothesis, father and mother are indepen-\ndent so the methods developed by Li and Graubard (2008) are\nvalid for parental data. Our simulation results (not presented\nin this paper) show that the F-version of the Wald test had\nwell-controlled type I error rates while other tests had inflated\ntype I error rates for some occasions. In this analysis, the F-\nversion of the Wald test achieved uniformly less power than\nour proposed 2\n(1) test applied to parents-child triads.\nThe proposed method is based on the data of parents-child\ntriads. It can be extended to the situation when data for more\nthan one offspring per family are available. The key is to find\nthe joint genotype distribution of parents and children, which\nis much more complicated and deserves further investigation,\nand to apply the same principle as described in this paper.\nThe proposed test procedures were applied to NHANES\nIII data and the results presented here are applicable to the U.S.\ncivilian, non-institutionalized population of age 12 and older,\nfrom which the data were collected. The analysis showed that\nHWE held at the 0.05 level for all three loci if the analyses\nwere restricted to those families with genotypic information\navailable for both two parents and at least one child. When all\nfamilies with genotypic information available for two parents\nwere used for the analyses, we randomly generated a child\ngenotype using Mendelian law for those families who did not\nhave a child genotype but did have parental genotypes. In this\nsituation, HWE only holds for ADRB2 and TGFB1 (nominal\nResults relating to VDR from the two analyses do not agree\nwith each other for two possible reasons. First, in the studied\ndata, the number of families with genotypes for both parents\nand at least one child is relatively small compared with the\ntotal family number. For example, there are 861 families with\ngenotypic information about VDR available for two parents,\nof which only 128 families have genotypic information about\nVDR for at least one child. Secondly, the distributions of\nparental genotypes of families with children are quite different\nfrom those of families without children. For example, for\nVDR, 3.9% of families with children have parental genotype\nof `CC-CC' while 9.4% of families without children have\nthis parental genotype; this would result in different joint\ndistributions of three genotypes from parents-child triads and\ncontribute at least partially to the different results from the\nanalyses.\nIn summary, we recommend the use of the Rao-Scott first\norder corrected test in surveys like NHANES III.\n"
