The World Health\nOrganization's Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) aims\nto address the gap in reliable data and scientific knowledge on ageing\nand health in low- and middle-income countries. SAGE is a longitu-\ndinal study with nationally representative samples of persons aged\n50\u00fe years in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia and South Africa,\nwith a smaller sample of adults aged 18\u00ad49 years in each country for\ncomparisons. Instruments are compatible with other large\nhigh-income country longitudinal ageing studies. Wave 1 was con-\nWorld Health Survey (referred to as SAGE Wave 0). Wave 2 data\ncollection will start in 2012/13, following up all Wave 1 respondents.\nlease of study instruments, protocols and meta- and micro-data:\naccess is provided upon completion of a Users Agreement available\nthrough WHO's SAGE website (www.who.int/healthinfo/systems/\nsage) and WHO's archive using the National Data Archive application\n(http://apps.who.int/healthinfo/systems/surveydata).\nPublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of the International Epidemiological Association\nData resource basics\nFew low- and middle-income countries have data on\nlevels and distribution of health and disability among\nthe older population, much less on which morbidity\ntrajectory their respective ageing populations are fol-\nlowing: expansion of morbidity, where people\nare living longer with more disease and disability;1,2\ncompression of morbidity, where longevity increases\nbut with delays in the age at onset and progression of\ndisease;3,4 or a dynamic equilibrium, where longevity\nand disability rates both increase, but the severity of\ndisability is not as severe.5,6 Large-scale longitudinal\nresearch in multiple settings is required to provide\ncomparable information on health and well-being,\nas well as to track the impact of health interventions\nand policies within and across countries. The World\nHealth Organization (WHO) Study on global AGEing\nand adult health (SAGE) aims to address this gap\nwith a global perspective. Its core consists of national\nlongitudinal studies of older people in six lower- and\nupper-middle-income countries, complemented by\nresearch collaborations with existing local\npopulation-based research studies, comparisons with\nother domestic ageing studies, and also comparisons\nto studies outside these six countries.\nSAGE is a longitudinal study with nationally repre-\nsentative samples of persons aged 50\u00fe years in China,\nGhana, India, Mexico, the Russian Federation and\nSouth Africa (see Figure 1), with comparison samples\nof younger adults aged 18\u00ad49 years in each country.\nThe main aim is to generate valid, reliable and\ncomparable information on a range of health and\nwell-being outcomes of public health importance, in\nadult and older adult populations. The core SAGE\ncountries provide a broad representation from different\ngeographic regions of the world, different levels of eco-\nnomic development and different stages in the demo-\ngraphic and health transition, and include the two\nmost populous countries of the world. SAGE is also\ndesigned to provide results that are comparable to\nageing studies in high-income countries, such as the\nUS Health and Retirement Study (http://hrsonline.isr.\numich.edu/), the English Longitudinal Study on Ageing\n(www.ifs.org.uk/elsa/) and the Collaborative Research\non Ageing in Europe (COURAGE in Europe) Project\n(www.courageproject.eu/) in three countries.\nData resource area and population\ncoverage\nFace-to-face interviews conducted in China (2008\u00ad\nChina were completed using a computer-assisted\nFigure 1 World map showing SAGE and SAGE sub-studies, by collaborating country\npersonal interview (CAPI) and the other half using\npaper and pencil. SAGE Mexico used CAPI through-\nout and the other four countries used paper and\npencil format for all interviews.\nMultistage cluster sampling strategies were used in all\ncountries where, except for Mexico, households were\nclassified into one of two mutually exclusive categories:\n(1) all persons aged 50 years and older were selected\nfrom households classified as `50\u00fe households'; and\n(2) one person aged 18\u00ad49 years was selected from a\nhousehold classified as an `18\u00ad49 household'. The ar-\nrangement in Mexico was similar, but included supple-\nmentary and replacement samples to account for losses\nto follow up in selected sampling units since Wave 0\n(more sampling details provided when accessing the\ndata through http://apps.who.int/healthinfo/systems/\nsurveydata/index.php/catalog). The sample in India is\nalso representative at the sub-national and sub-state\nlevels for the selected states. Household enumerations\nwere carried out for the final sampling units. One house-\nhold questionnaire was completed per household--\nwhere a household informant and individual respond-\nent need not be the same individual. One individual was\nhouseholds all individuals aged 50\u00fe were invited to\ncomplete the individual interview. Proxy respondents\nwere identified for selected individuals who were\nunable to complete the interview. Household-level\nanalysis weights and person-level analysis weights\nwere calculated for each country, which included\nsample selection and a post-stratification factor. Post-\nstratification correction techniques used the most\nrecent population estimates provided by the national\nstatistical offices. The pooled Wave 1 six-country totals\nfor individual respondents included 34 124 respondents\nTable 1 Sample sizes and response rates for SAGE Waves 0 and 1, by country and age groups\nCountry Age group\nNumber\nselected\nfor Wave 0\nIndividual\nresponse\nrate Wave 0\nNumber\nselected\nfor Wave 1\nIndividual\nresponse\nrate Wave 1a\nHousehold\nfollow-up rate,\naThe China team and WHO decided to use a new sampling frame for Wave 1. The South Africa team chose not to follow up Wave 0\nrespondents for Wave 1. Both samples are new, and do not include any Wave 0 follow-up respondents.\nbThe India sample for Wave 1 includes a large number of women aged 18\u00ad49 as part of a nested study, subsidized by the SAGE\nIndia team.\nSAGE also includes two longitudinal sub-studies to\ndevelop further hypotheses, assess the effects of\ninterventions and study specific populations, based\non collaborations with existing demographic and\nhealth surveillance systems fieldsites and local\ncommunity studies. The SAGE collaboration with\nthe International Network for the Demographic\nEvaluation of Populations and Their Health in de-\nveloping countries (INDEPTH; www.indepth-network.\norg) involves collaboration with eight fieldsites in\neight countries.7\u00ad9 One round of data collection took\nplace in 2007, with a second round planned to start in\n2013 (see Box 1). In addition, SAGE includes collab-\noration with Medical Research Centre Uganda,\nUganda, and the Africa Centre for Population and\nHealth, South Africa, building upon existing studies,\nto prospectively examine the direct and indirect ef-\nfects of HIV/AIDS on the health and well-being of\n2).

SAGE-INDEPTH Wave 1 data\n19 501 men) was produced.9 The overall response rate was 75%. The eight fieldsites implemented an adapted\nversion of the standard SAGE modules. Socio-economic and demographic information was taken from the\nHDSS site datasets. SAGE-INDEPTH Wave 2 is planned for late 2013. A special volume of publications was\npublished in 2010 (www.globalhealthaction.net/index.php/gha/issue/view/408).\nThe full SAGE questionnaire was also implemented in sub-samples of persons aged 50 years and over in\nAgincourt (N \u00bc 425), Navrongo (N \u00bc 594) and Vadu (N \u00bc 375). Data from these fieldsites can also be com-\npared with SAGE national samples in overlapping countries (South Africa, Ghana and India) to assess\nplausibility of findings and generalizability, as well as to generate new hypotheses that can be more inten-\nsively studied at the INDEPTH fieldsites before incorporating these components into future rounds of SAGE\nin national samples.\nBox 2 SAGE collaboration with existing local longitudinal studies (SAGE-HIV)\nThe SAGE sub-study on the effects of HIV on older people's health and well-being, with special attention to\nthe effects of antiretroviral therapy, includes two collaborations and was implemented in 2009/10. The\nsamples consist of HIV-positive people aged 50\u00fe years, and HIV-negative older people indirectly affected\nby the HIV/AIDS epidemic because their children are living with or died of HIV. The sub-studies are led by\nthe Medical Research Council/Uganda Virus Research Institute (510 people aged 50\u00fe years, including\n198 who are living with HIV)10 and the Africa Centre for Population and Health Studies (Africa Centre),\nsituated in the Mpukunyoni tribal area, Hlabisa sub-district, northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (422 par-\nticipants aged 50\u00fe years, 203 people living with HIV).11 The SAGE modules for health and functioning,\nchronic conditions, risk factors, health care utilization and caregiving were used during interviews.\nRespondent characteristics, living conditions, household assets and income, transfers and social networks\nwere included. Anthropometric measures and blood samples were collected.\nhousehold and individual respondents to be assigned\na known non-zero probability of selection.14 Pooling\nthe data from the six SAGE countries resulted in\naged 18\u00ad49 years; this sample is referred to as\nSAGE Wave 0.\nSAGE Wave 0 samples were revisited in SAGE Wave\n1 in four countries, resulting in a longitudinal data\nset of 8160 respondents in total. In India, all people\naged 50 years and older were revisited in Wave 1. In\nGhana, Mexico and the European region of the\nRussian Federation, a randomly selected sub-set was\nfollowed up. All added random samples of new\nrespondents to the Wave 0 samples. China and\nSouth Africa interviewed only newly selected respond-\nents--with China using an entirely new sampling\nframe based on the national non-communicable dis-\nease (NCD) surveillance system and South Africa\nupdating the Wave 0 sampling frame and then select-\ning all new respondents. The Russian Federation\nadded new respondents from its Asian region and\nthe South Federal Districts of the European part of\ncountry. The data from Waves 0 and 1 were linked\nbased on unique household and individual identifiers,\nand location, age and sex. Age and sex variables were\nverified case by case. Every household in the study\nhas location coordinates available through the use of\na Global Positioning System (GPS) device as part of\nthe interview process at both points in time.\nResponse rates were generally high in Wave 1 (see\nTable 1). In Mexico, response rates were lowest, partly\nbecause of the short time available for the field work\nwhich did not allow sufficient time for multiple re-\nvisits if the respondent was not at home at the initial\nvisit. The revised sampling targets and long interval\nbetween data collection efforts (on average 6 years)\ncontributed to high attrition between SAGE Wave 0\nand Wave 1 (Table 1). Mexico had the highest loss to\nsampled Wave 0 respondents were interviewed in\nWave 1. Only 676 refused or did not complete the\ninterview, whereas the remaining 1082 could not be\nlocated (31.0%), had died (2.3%) or were otherwise\nnot enrolled in Wave 1. In future Waves, follow-up\nrates are expected to be considerably higher because\nof the shorter time interval and the design measures\nemployed in Wave 1.\nMeasures\nA standardized survey instrument, set of methods,\ninterviewer training and translation protocols are\nused in all SAGE countries. The SAGE household\nquestionnaire consists of (1) a household roster\nand modules about the dwelling, income, transfers\nin and out of the household, assets and expenditures;\n(2) an individual questionnaire with modules on\nhealth and its determinants, disability, work history,\nrisk factors, chronic conditions, caregiving, subjective\nwell-being, health care utilization and health systems\nresponsiveness; (3) a proxy questionnaire about\nhealth, functioning, chronic conditions and health\ncare utilization; (4) a verbal autopsy module question-\nnaire to ascertain the probable cause of death for\ndeaths in the household in the 24 months prior\nto interview or between interview waves; and (5)\nappendices including showcards to assist with the\ninterviews. In addition, SAGE Wave 1 included\nanthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist\nand hip circumferences), blood pressure measures and\na blood sample via finger prick, and performance tests\nincluding near and distant vision, a timed 4-m walk,\ngrip strength, lung function and cognition.\nInternational standards were used to harmonize\neducation levels15 and occupations.16 Table 2 presents\na summary of the main measurements included in\nData resource use\nSome illustrative results are presented about health\nstatus and various predictors, cross-sectionally by\ncountry and age, and also the change in overall\nhealth over time. The analyses presented here focus\non the assessment of health state: a multidimensional\nconstruct consisting of eight health domains includ-\ning affect, cognition, interpersonal relationships,\nmobility, pain, self-care, sleep/energy and vision.\nA single composite health score was constructed\nfrom responses to self-reported difficulties in the\neight domains. Data were scored using item response\ntheory, and a partial credit model was used to calcu-\nlate the composite health score, ranging from 0\nFigure 2 presents the overall health status by age\nand income group for SAGE Wave 0. Across all coun-\ntries there is a consistent decline in health across the\nage spectrum, with respondents in China in better\nhealth and respondents from India in worse health\nas compared with the other countries. The sharpest\ndecline with age in Wave 0 is seen in Russia. The\ndifferences by country are smallest between the ages\nof about 50 and 75 years. This same inter-country\npattern was seen when using a single self-reported\noverall general health question (of the type, `In gen-\neral, how would you rate your health today?').\nThe declines in health status in respondents who\nwere assessed at both Wave 0 and Wave 1 were com-\npared and predictors for decline between the two\nwaves generated using a generalized estimating\nequation regression model.18 Figure 3 shows the\nmean health score results for respondents aged 50\u00fe\nyears from four SAGE countries pooled across Waves\n0 and 1.

Age is clearly the\nstrongest predictor of decline in health status, with\nolder adults having a much more significant decline\nin health over time than their younger counterparts.\nWomen's health state declines significantly more\nrapidly than men's health state between Wave 0\nand Wave 1.

The latter is particu-\nlarly critical to the overall success and strategic use of\nthe results. The collection of a range of biological and\nclinical markers in addition to a very comprehensive\ninterview is an asset.\nThe SAGE collaborations with local health and\ndemographic surveillance studies or systems provide\nan opportunity to link non-fatal health outcomes data\nto information from demographic surveillance, such\nas risk factors, mortality and migration, and track\nthese populations over time.

The duration of the interview is long\n(mean time for Wave 1 was 2.5 h), as multiple dimen-\nsions of health and well-being are measured, which\nmay be particularly demanding for both respondents\nand interviewers.
