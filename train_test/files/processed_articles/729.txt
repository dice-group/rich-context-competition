Although it has been demonstrated that physical performance measures predict incident disability in\npreviously nondisabled older persons, the available data have not been fully developed to create usable methods for de-\ntermining risk profiles in community-dwelling populations. Using several populations and different follow-up periods,\nthis study replicates previous findings by using the Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly\n(EPESE) performance battery and provides equations for the prediction of disability risk according to age, sex, and level\nof performance.\nMethods. Tests of balance, time to walk 8 ft, and time to rise from a chair 5 times were administered to 4,588 ini-\ntially nondisabled persons in the four sites of the EPESE and to 1,946 initially nondisabled persons in the Hispanic\nEPESE. Follow-up assessment for activity of daily living (ADL) and mobility-related disability occurred from 1 to 6\nyears later.\nResults. In the EPESE, compared with those with the best performance (EPESE summary performance score of 10\u00ad\n12), the relative risks of mobility-related disability for those with scores of 4\u00ad6 ranged from 2.9 to 4.9 and the relative\nrisk of disability for those with scores of 7\u00ad9 ranged from 1.5 to 2.1, with similar consistent results for ADL disability.\nThe observed rates of incident disability according to performance level in the Hispanic EPESE agreed closely with\nrates predicted from models developed from the EPESE sites. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that gait\nspeed alone performed almost as well as the full battery in predicting incident disability.\nConclusions. Performance tests of lower extremity function accurately predict disability across diverse populations.\nEquations derived from models using both the summary score and the gait speed alone allow for the estimation of risk of\ndisability in community-dwelling populations and provide valuable information for estimating sample size for clinical\ntrials of disability prevention.\nNCREASINGLY, standardized tests of physical perfor-\nmance have been applied in research and geriatric assess-\nment settings. Performance tests have been found to be\nstrongly associated with multiple measures of health status\nand are predictive of important outcomes such as hip fracture,\nnursing home admission, and death. It has been generally\nagreed that performance measures supplement, rather than re-\nplace, self-report of disability. Along the theoretical pathway\nfrom disease to disability proposed by Nagi (1) and the Insti-\ntute of Medicine (2) and made operational by Verbrugge and\nJette (3), most performance measures can be considered func-\ntional limitations. These functional limitations are proximal\non the pathway to disability, which represents the interaction\nof performance ability with an individual's environment.\nIt has also been demonstrated that performance measures\ncan capture a hierarchy of functioning in persons who are\nnot disabled and even in those who are high functioning (4,5).\nFurthermore, in nondisabled persons performance measures\nhave been shown to be predictive of the onset of incident\ndisability (6\u00ad9). In research from Project Safety (6) a\nthreshold effect was observed, whereby risk of future dis-\nability increased substantially below a certain critical level\nof performance. In contrast, in the Iowa cohort of the Estab-\nlished Populations for Epidemiologic Research in the Eld-\nerly (EPESE), a graded effect was seen, with increasing\ndisability risk at each lower level of performance (9).\nOne important limitation of the findings from the latter\nstudy was that it was restricted to the Iowa EPESE site, a ru-\nI\nral, all-white cohort. Data have recently become available\nthat allow for the replication of the study in other EPESE\nsites and for the comparison of findings both between sites\nand for different lengths of follow-up. This study evaluates\nfindings across these sets of studies, assesses whether a sim-\nple measure of gait speed has the same predictive value for\ndisability as the full performance battery used in the initial\nEPESE studies (9,10), presents predictive models of risk of\ndisability and death according to performance level, age, sex,\nand number of years of follow-up, and examines how well\nthese models predict disability in an external, Hispanic pop-\nulation. It is then demonstrated how estimates of disability\noutcomes can be used to determine sample size requirements\nfor clinical trials, information that is critical in planning for\ninterventions to prevent disability.\nMETHODS\nStudy Populations\nData are from the four sites of the EPESE and from the\nHispanic EPESE. The East Boston, Iowa, New Haven (Con-\nnecticut), and North Carolina sites of the EPESE comprise a\ncollaborative study of aging initiated by the Epidemiology,\nDemography, and Biometry Program of the National Insti-\ntute on Aging. After recruitment of representative popula-\nin North Carolina. Details of the baseline assessments have\nbeen described in detail (11,12). Annual contacts were\nmade for 6 years and at the sixth follow-up measures of\nphysical performance were added to the protocol for the\nfirst time. Subsequent to follow-up 6, which is considered\nthe baseline for these analyses, interviews were performed\nat 1 year in Iowa and New Haven, at 4 years in Iowa and\nNorth Carolina, and at 6 years in New Haven. Mortality\nsubsequent to follow-up 6 was ascertained at all sites through\ninterviews, obituaries, and linkage with the National Death\nIndex. No interviews were performed in East Boston after\nfollow-up 6 and East Boston data contribute to only esti-\nmates of baseline distribution of physical performance and\nestimates of mortality according to baseline performance.\nAt follow-up 6, the number of persons not known to have\ninstitutions, living at home but needing a proxy respondent\nbecause of cognitive or physical impairment, or living out-\nside the area and requiring a telephone interview. Of the re-\nmaining 7,352 persons interviewed in person in their\nhomes, 141 (1.9%) refused the performance tests. To select\nan initially nondisabled cohort, we excluded persons report-\ning disability in activities of daily living (ADLs) or mobil-\nity-related disability (defined below). To further reduce\ndisabled persons being misclassified as nondisabled at base-\nline, we also excluded those 4% of participants reporting no\ndisability but having scores of 0 to 3 on the summary per-\nformance scale (defined below). A large proportion of these\npersons were unable to walk 8 ft or maintain a simple side-\nby-side stand, which is incompatible with a report of ability\nwho were initially classified as nondisabled (East Boston\nAt follow-up, interviews to assess disability status were\nperformed using proxies and in nursing homes if necessary.\nAmong those not known to have died, follow-up disability\ninformation was missing at 1 year in 3.2% and 3.8% of\nthose in Iowa and New Haven, respectively, at 4 years in\n4.2% and 6.7% of those in Iowa and North Carolina, respec-\ntively, and at 6 years in 5.0% of those in New Haven. After\ndeath and loss to follow-up, subsequent information on dis-\nability status was obtained at 1 year on 1,342 persons in\npersons in Iowa and 962 persons in North Carolina; and at 6\nyears on 455 persons in New Haven.\nChronic Conditions at Baseline\nWe assessed chronic conditions at baseline and each an-\nnual interview through follow-up 6 by asking participants if\na physician had told them they had a heart attack, stroke,\ncancer, hip fracture, or diabetes. Cancer was considered\npresent only if the participants also reported spending one\nor more nights in the hospital for the cancer. Chronic condi-\ntions were considered present if mentioned at baseline or at\nany follow-up interview.\nMeasures of Physical Performance\nThe physical performance battery used in the EPESE\nstudies, previously described in detail (9,10), evaluated\nlower extremity function by using tests of gait speed, stand-\ning balance, and time to rise from a chair five times. Identi-\ncal assessments were done in all sites by specially trained\ninterviewers, with a training videotape used to optimize\nstandardization of the procedures across sites. Good to ex-\ncellent test\u00adretest reliability of these tests has been demon-\nfrom the original three EPESE sites (East Boston, Iowa, and\nNew Haven), a five-level categorical score was created for\neach test, with 0 representing inability to complete the test\nand 4 representing the highest level of performance (10).\nFor tests of standing balance, participants attempted to\nmaintain the side-by-side, semitandem, and tandem posi-\ntions for 10 seconds. Participants were scored 1 if they\ncould hold a side-by side stand for 10 seconds but were un-\nable to hold a semitandem stand for 10 seconds, 2 if they\nheld a semitandem stand for 10 seconds but were unable to\nhold a full tandem stand for more than 2 seconds, 3 if they\nheld the full tandem stand for 3 to 9 seconds, and 4 if they\nheld the full tandem stand for 10 seconds.\nA usual pace, 8-ft walk was timed from a standing start,\nand participants were scored according to quartiles of per-\nformance. Time on the faster of two walks was used to de-\nParticipants were asked to fold their arms across their\nchest and to stand up once from a chair. If successful they\nwere asked to stand up and sit down five times as quickly as\npossible. Quartiles of performance for the repeat chair\nstands were used to define scores as follows: score of 1:\nA summary performance score was created by summation\nof the scores for tests of standing balance, gait speed, and ris-\ning from a chair 5 times. This scale has been demonstrated to\nhave predictive validity in analyses showing a gradient of\nrisk for mortality, nursing home admission, and incident dis-\nability (7,9,10). The internal consistency of the summary\nscale as assessed by Cronbach's alpha was 0.76 (10). The\nsubjects in this report were nondisabled at baseline and had\nsummary performance scores ranging from 4 to 12.\nIn addition to the summary performance score, gait speed\nalone was assessed for its relation to incident disability. An\n8-ft (2.44 m) walk was used in EPESE because of concern\nabout limited space in participants' homes. However, for\nthe assessment of gait speed over a short distance we be-\nlieve the 4-m walk is now the distance of choice because it\nhas been demonstrated to be feasible in the home as well as\nin the clinical setting and its longer distance may improve\nmeasurement accuracy. In the Women's Health and Aging\nStudy it was demonstrated that in small houses and apart-\nments in Baltimore a 4-m walk was possible for 90% of\nsubjects, with 9% requiring a 3-m walk and 0.8% not hav-\ning space for a 3-m walk (16). Because of the advantage of\nusing the 4-m walk for both home and clinic gait speed\ntests, we converted velocity in the 8-ft walk into estimated\nvelocity for a 4-m walk in all analyses presented here. This\nconversion was accomplished with data from the University\nof Kansas Prediction of Elder Performance Study. In that\nstudy, 700 assessments were done in which time was mea-\nsured for both an 8-ft and a 4-m walk. Velocity for both\ntests was converted to meters per second. The correlation\nbetween velocities was 0.97. Piecewise linear regression\nwas used to evaluate whether the relationship between 8-ft\nwalk velocity and 4-m walk velocity was linear. A model\nwith a single break point and change in slope had a signifi-\ncantly better fit than a straight linear model. The break point\nthat maximized the R2, determined iteratively, was at an 8-ft\ngait speed of 1 m/s (R2  0.96). The observed data showed\nthat, on average, the ratio of 4-m walk velocity to 8-ft walk\nvelocity (both expressed in meters per second) was 1.065\nlocity 1.0 m/s. The following equations were used to con-\nvert 8-ft gait speed to 4-m gait speed:\nWhen these equations are used, the quartiles used for the\ncategorization of gait speed when a participant is perform-\nDisability Status at Follow-up\nDisability status at follow-up, based on self-report or\nproxy report, used a three-level hierarchical scale (9,17) that\ncontains a subset of questions from a scale originally devel-\noped by Berkman and colleagues (18). This scale, used to\n( ).\n+\n=\n( ).\n+\n=\nexclude those with disability at baseline, was used to clas-\nsify subjects at follow-up as having no disability, having\nmobility-related disability (inability to walk 0.5 mile or\nclimb stairs without help), or having disability in ADLs\n(having mobility-related disability plus the inability to per-\nform one or more of the following activities without help\nfrom another person: moving from a bed to a chair, using\nthe toilet, bathing, and walking across a small room). Be-\ncause the baseline performance tests measured lower ex-\ntremity function, disability items related to lower extremity\nfunction were used. At each follow-up in all sites less than\n2% of persons did not fit the hierarchical pattern, reporting\ndisability in ADLs but not in mobility-related disability.\nThese persons were classified as having disability in ADLs.\nHispanic EPESE\nPredictive models developed from the original EPESE\nsites were evaluated with data from the Hispanic EPESE, a\npopulation-based study of 3,050 community-dwelling Mex-\nican Americans living in five Southwestern states (19). The\nbaseline assessment, including the same self-report items on\ndisability and the same performance battery, was completed\nability data were ascertained (7).\nStatistical Analysis\nRates of ADL and mobility disability were calculated ac-\ncording to summary performance score for each site and ac-\ncording to number of follow-up years. Multiple logistic\nmodels, adjusting for age, sex, and number of chronic con-\nditions, were used to predict the relative risk of disability for\nthose with summary performance scores of 4\u00ad6 and 7\u00ad9\ncompared with the reference group, those with scores of 10\u00ad\n12. Interactions between performance scores and other vari-\nables in the models were examined but there was no consis-\ntency seen across sites or follow-up times for the few\ninteractions that were significant. Meta-analytic techniques\nwere used to test for homogeneity for the two sites with\n1-year follow-up data and the two sites with 4-year follow-\nTo compare the relative predictive ability of gait speed\nwith that of the summary performance score, receiver-oper-\nator characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed and tested\nwith AccuROC software (Accumetric Corp., Montreal).\nGait speed was categorized as deciles for these analyses. Ar-\neas under the curves were calculated, and comparison of\nthese areas was done with the method of Hanley and Mc-\nIn addition to evaluating relative risk, these data were\nused to estimate absolute risk of disability. Risk of disability\nwas modeled in multiple logistic equations in which age,\nsex, and either summary performance score as an ordinal\nvariable or gait speed as a continuous variable were entered.\nCoefficients from these models were used to construct\nequations that predict the absolute risk of disability accord-\ning to these variables. Estimated risks predicted from the\nmodels are compared graphically with actual observed risk.\nFor specific levels of performance, we calculated prediction\nof disability risk by entering into the predictive equation\nthat level of performance and the average age and sex distri-\nbution for that level of performance. In the same way, actual\nrate of disability after 2 years in the Hispanic EPESE cohort\nwas compared with predicted risk for each baseline perfor-\nmance score after 1 and 4 years by use of the EPESE predic-\ntive equations.\nAdditional data are furnished to make it possible to esti-\nmate transitions along all steps in the pathway from encoun-\ntering a community-dwelling population, to estimating the\nproportion initially disability free, to predicting the rate of\nsurvival and incident disability in survivors. The distribu-\ntion of summary performance scores and categories of gait\nspeed according to age and sex were estimated by being\ntreated as ordinally scaled dependent variables in polychot-\nomous logistic regression models (SAS procedure CAT-\nMOD) (23). The estimates calculated from this model for\nmen and women of specific ages are provided in additional\ntables, which also provide information on the proportion ex-\npected to be nondisabled at each performance level. Rather\nthan being adjusted for chronic disease status, which would\nmake results for different age and sex subgroups more simi-\nlar to each other, the analyses are not adjusted in order to\npresent each age and sex group's performance distribution\nas you would find it in the community. Multiple logistic\nmodels were used to estimate risk of mortality according to\nage, sex, and performance, and equations are presented that\npredict absolute risk of mortality according to these vari-\nables. Preliminary to these analyses we performed site-spe-\ncific analyses for mortality and found that the coefficients\nfor age, sex, and performance were similar across sites.\nExamples illustrate how these findings can be used to es-\ntimate mortality and disability outcomes for 80-year-old men\nand for a mixed cohort selected for a clinical trial.\nRESULTS\nLower Extremity Function as a Predictor of Disability\nFigure 1 illustrates the proportion of initially nondisabled\npersons developing ADL and mobility disability according\nto summary performance score, site, and years of follow-up.\nFor each group there is a decline in risk of disability with in-\ncreasing performance. There is a higher risk for mobility\ndisability than for ADL disability, and a higher proportion\nof persons become disabled with longer follow-up periods.\nThere is consistency across sites for the 1-year follow-up re-\nsults (Iowa and New Haven) and 4-year follow-up results\n(Iowa and North Carolina).\nTable 1 shows the adjusted risk of initially nondisabled\nparticipants developing mobility disability at follow up.\nCompared with those with a baseline performance score of\n9\u00ad12, persons with a score of 4\u00ad6 had a relative risk ranging\nfrom 2.9 to 4.9, whereas those with a score of 7\u00ad9 had a rel-\native risk ranging from 1.5 to 2.1. Similar consistency in\nfindings is demonstrated for risk of ADL disability in Table\n2. Meta-analysis demonstrated the homogeneity of findings\nfor ADL and mobility outcomes at 1 year and at 4 years.\nGait Speed Alone Versus the Summary\nPerformance Score\nOf the three components of the summary performance\nscale, the steepest gradient of risk for disability has been ob-\nserved across categories of gait speed (7,9). Because gait\nspeed is easy to measure and may be done quickly in the\nclinical setting, it is useful to evaluate whether measuring\ngait speed alone may capture the predictive power of a more\ncomprehensive battery. To examine this we created ROC\ncurves for the prediction of ADL and mobility disability,\nexamining the gait speed component of the summary per-\nformance score and the summary performance score itself.\nFigure 2 illustrates that the area under all ROC curves is\n65% or greater, with all curves significantly different from a\ndiagonal line that indicates zero predictive ability of the test.\nIn each case the summary score performs better than the\ngait speed. However, for predicting ADL disability at 4\nyears the two curves are not substantively or significantly\ndifferent from each other. For the other three comparisons\nthe curves do differ significantly from each other but the\ndifference in area under the curves is not substantial, rang-\nFigure 1. Percentage of participants with no disability at baseline who developed ADL disability and mobility disability according to summary\nperformance score, site, and number of years of follow-up (f/u).\ning from 3% to 5%. These findings indicate that gait speed\nalone is nearly as good a predictor of disability outcomes as\nthe full performance battery. Predictive models for disabil-\nity and mortality will thus be presented for both measures.\nPredicted and Observed Disability Outcomes\nTable 3 combines data from the two sites with 1-year fol-\nlow-up (Iowa and New Haven) and the two sites with the\n4-year follow-up (Iowa and North Carolina) to present\nequations that estimate probability of disability. These\nequations result from multiple logistic models that adjust\nfor age and sex. When age, sex, and summary performance\nscore or gait speed are entered into the equations, an esti-\nmate of disability risk can be obtained. To examine how\nwell these models fit the data and predict observed disabil-\nity risk, the probability of disability associated with specific\nsummary performance scores and gait velocities was calcu-\nlated with the equations in Table 3. Figure 3 illustrates the\npredicted risk of disability and the actual risk observed in\nthe study cohorts. The fit is excellent, with minor deviations\nbetween predicted and observed occurring mainly at the\nlower end of performance, where the data are more sparse\nthan at the upper end.\nThe predictive accuracy of the equations was further as-\nsessed by examination of data from an external source, the\nHispanic EPESE. This cohort had a 2-year follow-up after\nthe baseline assessment of performance. Figure 4 shows the\nobserved Hispanic EPESE ADL and mobility disability\nrates at 2 years and compares them with predicted rates for\n1 and 4 years generated from the equations derived from\nEPESE data. The observed rates generally fall within the 1-\nand the 4-year predictions. Overall, in the Hispanic EPESE\ncohort with no ADL or mobility disability at baseline with a\nof ADL disability and 211 cases of mobility disability were\nobserved at 2 years of follow-up. The predictive models\nprojected that at 1 and 4 years, ADL disability would be\npresent in 29 and 69 persons and mobility disability would\nCharacterizing Performance and Predicting Functional\nOutcomes in a Community-Dwelling Population\nWith confirmation that performance measures can accu-\nrately predict disability outcomes in groups, it is valuable to\nfurther exploit the rich EPESE database to characterize per-\nformance levels and outcomes that can be expected to be\nfound in a representative population. These descriptive data\nand predictive models may then be applied to other popula-\ntions. Available EPESE data provide information on the dis-\ntributions of the summary performance score and gait speed\nin representative older populations, and, according to level\nof performance, the proportion of the population that is ex-\npected to be nondisabled when first encountered, the pro-\nportion expected to die over time, and, finally, the proportion\nthat is predicted to become disabled. With data from all four\nEPESE sites, Appendix A shows the distribution of the\nsummary performance score according to age and sex. It\nalso shows the proportion of persons in each performance\ncategory that is initially nondisabled in ADLs and mobility\nand thus at risk of future disability. Appendix B shows sim-\nTable 1.

By using these data one can calcu-\nlate the proportion of persons of a specific age that have a\ngait speed within a certain range who might be candidates\nfor a specific intervention or clinical trial. It should be noted\nthat these gait speeds are lower than those measured in\nmany previous studies of gait speed and aging (24). Most of\nthose studies, performed in gait laboratories, made measure-\nments after subjects reached their full speed, as opposed to\nthe home assessment done in the EPESE, in which subjects\nwere timed from a standing start. Appendix C presents\nequations resulting from multiple logistic analyses that pre-\ndict probability of death according to age, sex, and perfor-\nmance.\nTable 4 demonstrates how the data provided here can be\nused to characterize a population and predict outcomes over\ntime. With data from Appendix A, the distribution of the\nsummary performance score in one-thousand 80-year-old\nmen is shown in column 2. Further, with data from Appen-\ndix A on the proportion of nondisabled persons, column 3\nshows the actual number expected to be nondisabled. The\nprobability of death at 1 year is estimated when age, sex,\nand summary performance score are inserted into the first\nequation listed in Appendix C. The number of men surviv-\ning at each level of performance score can then be calcu-\nlated. The probability of mobility disability is then estimated\nwhen age, sex, and summary performance score are inserted\nFigure 2.

The performance battery and gait speed\nalone were significant predictors of incident disability as\nlong as 6 years after they were done. The absolute risk of\ndisability increased with longer follow-up time (Figure 1)\nbut, irrespective of time to follow-up, there was excellent\nconsistency among the relative risks comparing the low-\nand medium-performance individuals with those with high\nperformance (Tables 1 and 2). It appears that the predictive\npower of the performance measures wanes somewhat at 6\nyears, as the relative risk for the low- versus the high-per-\nformance groups was somewhat lower than for the shorter\nfollow-ups. However, it is striking that after 6 years the in-\ncreased risk associated with low performance on this sim-\nple, brief performance battery done by an interviewer in the\nparticipant's home is still of substantial magnitude and is\nstatistically significant. This is especially impressive con-\nsidering the high rate of intervening and catastrophic condi-\ntions occurring in persons in their 70s and 80s followed\nover a long period of time.\nOur findings may be directly compared with the results in\na recent report by Ostir and colleagues on the 2-year follow-\nup of the Hispanic EPESE, for which the performance bat-\ntery was performed in the same way (7). The relative risk of\nmobility-related disability was 4.8 in their low-performance\ngroup and 2.4 in their middle-performance group, compared\nwith the high-performance group. Relative risks for ADL\ndisability were 6.2 and 2.0, respectively. These relative\nrisks are very similar to the estimates shown in Tables 1 and\n2 for three EPESE sites with different lengths of follow-up.\nIt is essential to examine whether the models developed\nto test the relationship between performance and incident\ndisability not only indicate an elevated relative risk but also\naccurately predict the actual rate of disability. We first\nfound that predictions made from the models worked very\nwell in predicting the observed outcomes in the cohorts\nused to develop the models (Figure 3), indicating that the\nmodels fit the data from which they were derived quite well.\nThe true test of a model's predictive ability, however, is to\ntest it by using an external data set. This was done with the\nHispanic EPESE. Although we could not make direct pre-\ndictions for the 2-year Hispanic EPESE follow-up period, it\nwas possible to compare these observations with 1- and 4-year\npredictions. Considering the differences in the ethnicity of\nthe cohorts and the regions in which the studies were done,\nit was remarkable how well the models predicted the range\nof the observed rates of disability in the Hispanic EPESE at\n2 years (Figure 4). This evidence supports the validity and\nthe robustness of these simple measures of performance and\nsupports their use in developing disability risk estimates for\ndiverse populations. Analyses within the North Carolina co-\nhort also revealed no clear evidence for differences in the\nrelationship of performance with disability between whites\nand African Americans (data not shown).\nThis research also demonstrated that assessing gait speed\nalone is nearly as good as performing the full battery of per-\nformance tests in the prediction of incident disability. This\nis a valuable finding to support the routine measurement of\ngait speed in older persons in the clinical setting, in which it\nmay be quite useful to have an objective measure of lower\nextremity functioning, but in which there may not be time to\nperform a full performance battery. Gait speed assessment\nmay also be an efficient tool as the first step in screening a\nlarge number of older persons to identify and recruit into\nclinical trials persons with a specific level of functioning.\nThe equations presented in this report allow for estimation\nof disability and mortality risk in persons who are initially\nnondisabled, as determined from the few self-report ques-\ntions used here, and for whom a gait speed has been mea-\nsured.\nThe question of whether to abandon the full performance\nbattery and use gait speed alone in all clinical and research\nsettings is a difficult one. Certainly the assessment of rising\nfrom a chair and balance give information that may be of\nvalue in understanding the pathway from disease to disabil-\nity (3). Specific diseases and impairments may affect spe-\ncific aspects of lower extremity function, which may then\ndetermine the characteristics of an individual's disability.\nFurthermore, measuring a specific construct with multiple\nmeasures increases reliability (25), so some measurement\naccuracy may be gained by using the full battery. For this\nreason, the full battery is likely to be a better instrument in\nwhich to assess change over time. In the Iowa EPESE co-\nhort, the summary performance battery had a mean decline\nof 1.6 points over 4 years, with 67% of the sample declin-\nValidity of the change scores was supported by the findings\nthat, with adjustment for baseline performance, the sum-\nmary performance score declined more in those  80 years\nold, having less education, and having coronary heart disease\nand chronic lung disease. Furthermore, declines in summary\nperformance score were sensitive to the presence of depres-\nFigure 4.

The real value of the\nfindings on performance measures presented here is that\nthey provide a strategy to target disability prevention inter-\nventions to high-risk groups that can be identified with a\nsimple screening battery or even just a test of walking speed.\nThe reference tables here provide the information needed to\nestimate the distribution of performance levels that can be\nanticipated to be present in the community and the probabil-\nity that persons of a specific age, sex, and performance level\nwill develop disability. This information allows for the ra-\ntional development of estimates of disability risk that will\nput the calculation of sample sizes needed for these studies\non a much more empirical footing. It should be noted that\nthese estimates are for persons living in the community who\nare in their usual state of health and are not appropriate for\nestimating risk for persons who have acute illnesses or are\njust being discharged from the hospital.\nThe largest benefit for the effort expended in disability\nprevention programs may come from intervening not on\nthose at the best level of functioning but on persons with\nlower levels of functioning. Thus, screening a nondisabled\npopulation and recruiting persons with summary perfor-\nmance scores ranging from 4 to 9 would yield a population\nwith a high risk of disability. The higher rate of events in\nthis population would allow for a reduced sample size com-\npared with intervening on very high functioning individuals.\nFurthermore, nondisabled persons who are objectively dem-\nonstrated to have reduced performance may be on a pro-\ngressively downward trajectory, so their functional abilities\nand quality of life could be substantially improved with a\ntimely and well-focused intervention. This approach can\nsupport future efforts to reduce disability at both an individ-\nual and a public health level.\n"
