    "reduced_content": "Relative to information on activities of daily living, information regarding the onset of and recovery from\nmobility difficulty has been limited. Drawing upon data gathered from 6,376 self-respondents aged 51-61\nyears at baseline (1992) who were successfully reinterviewed in 1994 as part of the Health and Retirement\nSurvey, the authors were able to build upon and add to knowledge gained from previous studies of the onset\nof and recovery from mobility difficulty. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to separate the direct and\nindirect effects of predictors of mobility difficulty onset and recovery at 2-year follow-up. To separate direct\nand indirect effects, the authors categorized various predictors as being related to sociodemographic factors,\neconomic factors, health behavior, chronic disease, or physical impairment, and the categories were sequen-\ntially incorporated into a series of equations. The order in which the predictors were incorporated into the\nequations followed from a theoretical model of the disability process. In this study of mobility difficulty, the\nstrongest direct predictors of recovery were having little baseline difficulty and the absence of diabetes\nmellitus, lung disease, and frequent pain. The strongest direct predictors of onset were female sex, less\neducation, low net worth, lack of private health insurance, obesity, and frequent pain. Few indirect predictors\nfor either onset or recovery were identified. Predictors of recovery were few and differed from predictors of\nonset. Further efforts are needed to identify modifiable predictors among females, persons with few economic\naging; chronic disease; disability evaluation; risk factors\nRecent research indicates that mobility difficulty is\na primary risk factor for the onset of disability. Studies\nhave presented considerable evidence that mobility\nproblems have a strong negative impact on the ability\nto perform basic and household activities of daily\nliving, as well as on perceived health and the incidence\nof depression (1-4). This suggests that identification\nof predictors of the onset of mobility difficulty repre-\nsents an important step in the development of effective\ndisability prevention programs and policies. Thus, our\nobjective in this analysis was to create separate models\nfor prediction of the onset of and recovery from mo-\nbility difficulty at 2-year follow-up (1994) among the\nment Survey.\nIn the several published reports on predictors of\nchange in mobility status that do exist (2, 5, 6), socio-\nReceived for publication April 17,1997, and in final form January\n1 Department of Medicine, Indiana University Center for Aging\nResearch, Indianapolis, IN.\n2 Regenstrief Institute for Health Care, Indiana University School\nof Medicine, Indianapolis, IN.\n3 School of Public Health, St. Louis University Health Sciences\nCenter, St. Louis, MO.\ndemographic characteristics and the prevalence of\nchronic health conditions received considerable atten-\ntion. Race did not independently predict change in\nmobility status among respondents in the Longitudinal\nStudy on Aging, but greater age and female sex did\n(6). Among respondents to the EPESE survey [Estab-\nlished Populations for Epidemiologic Study of the\nElderly], age and female sex also predicted the onset\nof mobility limitations (2) and were associated with\ngreater rates of decline and a lower probability of\nrecovery (5). Lower income was a significant predic-\ntor of mobility loss among both men and women,\nwhile a lower educational level predicted loss among\nmen only (2). In both the Wolinsky et al. (6) and\nGuralnik et al. (2) reports, the presence of diabetes\nmellitus, hypertension, stroke, and arthritis at baseline\nwere predictive of onset of or increase in mobility\ndifficulty. Predictors unique to one or the other study\nincluded leg pain, dyspnea, heart attack, Alzheimer's\ndisease, and greater body mass index (weight (kg)/\nNone of the above studies included behavioral pre-\ndictors, but in a companion study to that of Guralnik\net al. (2), LaCroix et al. (7) focused specifically on\nbehavioral predictors. They found current smoking\namong men, a body mass index at the 80th percentile\nor higher among women, and low levels of physical\nactivity among both sexes to be predictors for the\nonset of mobility limitations. Relative to no alcohol\nconsumption, low to moderate alcohol consumption\nwas protective. The authors reported that the effects of\nthe behavioral predictors were essentially unchanged\nwhen baseline age, education, and number of chronic\nconditions were controlled (7).\nThe findings of the above studies represent impor-\ntant steps toward the identification of risk factors for\nmobility difficulty or loss. We incorporated each of\nthe predictors identified in these studies into our anal-\nysis, and, using data from the Health and Retirement\nSurvey, we were able to extend the findings of these\nstudies by incorporating important additional predictor\nvariables (e.g., comorbidity and physical impairments\n(8, 9)). In addition, we modeled difficulty onset and\nrecovery separately, focused on a slightly younger age\ngroup, and estimated both indirect and direct effects.\nSeparate models of onset and recovery may be impor-\ntant, given the fact that more than one fourth of per-\nsons who report having difficulty with activities of\ndaily living or limitations in lower body function im-\nprove or recover by 2-year follow-up (6, 10). A focus\non a younger age group may also prove valuable,\nbecause primary prevention is often most effective\nwhen the intervention population has low prevalence\nbut elevated risk. Thus, a focus on persons aged 51-61\nyears, the majority of whom have not yet experienced\ndeclines in lower body function, may provide im-\nportant clues for the prevention of mobility diffi-\nculty and, ultimately, disability in activities of daily\nliving.\nThe identification of both direct and indirect effects\nhas been noted to be a much overlooked but very\nimportant step in risk factor modeling (11, 12). Be-\ncause the strongest proximate or direct causes are\noften not modifiable (e.g., age, sex), it is of interest to\nidentify indirect effects, which may be modifiable.\nAge, for example, may have an effect on the onset of\nmobility difficulty via physical activity level, because\nquadriceps muscle activity is negatively correlated\nwith age. Identifying this indirect effect allows for a\nmore thorough understanding of predictors and thus\ngreater potential for intervention (e.g., promotion of\nphysical activity). In this study, we used the hierarchi-\ncal regression approach to attempt to identify direct\nand indirect effects of sociodemographic factors, eco-\nnomic factors, health behavior, chronic disease, and\nphysical impairment on mobility difficulty onset and\nrecovery.\nData collection\nThe data for these analyses were obtained from\nself-responses to questionnaires administered during\nphases of the Health and Retirement Survey. The Health\nand Retirement Survey was funded by the National\nInstitute of Aging and was coordinated and managed\nby the Institute for Survey Research at the University\nof Michigan (Ann Arbor, Michigan). The study was\ndesigned to provide in-depth data for the investigation\nof analytical and policy issues surrounding retirement;\nhence, it focused on persons aged 51-61 years. Over\n93 percent of the respondents were interviewed in\nperson; the remainder were interviewed via telephone.\nThe survey lasted approximately 1 hour for each re-\nspondent. The substantial breadth of data collected on\nwork experiences, financial status, and health allowed\nthe creation of more fully specified models than was\npreviously possible.\nTo identify age-eligible persons, the Health and\nhouseholds obtained from an area probability sample.\nCensus tracts containing a high density of African\nAmericans or Mexican Americans were oversampled\n2:1, as were census tracts in Florida. All spouses were\ninterviewed regardless of age, because of the fre-\nquency of dual-earner couples and the influence of\nspouses in the retirement decision process. Thus, the\nHealth and Retirement Survey also includes data on\nthan 61 years. These persons do not constitute a rep-\nresentative sample of persons in those age ranges, and\nthey were excluded from the analyses presented here.\nThe analyses were further restricted to baseline self-\nrespondents, because of the subjective nature of many\nof the baseline measures. The baseline proxy re-\nsponse rate was 5 percent, and among baseline\nself-respondents, the follow-up proxy response rate\nwas 2 percent.\nThe overall baseline response rate was 82 percent,\nand comparisons with 1990 US Census data provided\nno indication of sample bias (13). Among the 51- to\n61-year-old self-respondents interviewed at baseline,\nsignificant demographic, economic, or chronic disease\ndifferences between those who were reinterviewed\nand those who were not. There were 6,437 self-\nrespondents aged 51-61 years with complete mobility\ndata at baseline and follow-up (table 1) and 6,376\nself-respondents who had complete data on all mea-\nsures used in the analyses (tables 2 and 3).\nOnset of and Recovery from Mobility Difficulty 65\nMeasures considered\nThe sociodemographic characteristics considered\nincluded a continuous measure for age; indicator vari-\nables for female sex, marital status, residence in the\nSoutheast, and non-US birth; and a set of three dummy\nvariables for ethnicity (African-American, Mexican-\nAmerican, and white; white was the reference catego-\nry). Economic measures consisted of indicator vari-\nables for an income (respondent and spouse combined)\ntotal net worth, private health insurance, and Medicaid\ninsurance. The questions regarding net worth covered\nreal estate, business ownership, pensions, stocks and\nbonds, checking accounts, savings accounts, certifi-\ncates of deposit, and all other sources of income. For\nmissing information on income and net worth, values\nimputed by the Institute for Survey Research were\nused. By dichotomizing income and net worth at\n$10,000 or less, we minimized the potential implica-\ntions of the imputation of missing values. Education\nwas represented by a continuous measure for years of\nschooling completed, and an indicator variable identi-\nfied persons currently working for pay. For the latter\nrespondents, a nine-point occupational physical de-\nmands score (not shown) was created from responses\nto three statements: 1) \"My job requires lots of phys-\nical effort,\" 2) \"My job requires lifting heavy loads,\"\nand 3) \"My job requires stooping, kneeling, or crouch-\ning.\" There were four possible responses, ranging\nfrom \"all or almost all of the time\" (coded as a 1) to\n\"none or almost none of the time\" (coded as a 4). The\nthree items formed one factor, with factor loadings all\nable was only used in subgroup analyses of persons\nwho were currently working.\nThe behavioral predictors studied consisted of alco-\nhol consumption, smoking status, overweight, and\nphysical inactivity.\nAlcohol consumption. The CAGE scale is a four-\nitem alcohol use scale (14) designed to determine\nwhether an individual has ever abused alcohol. The\nfour CAGE items are: 1) \"Have you ever felt you\nshould cut down on your drinking?\"; 2) \"Have people\never annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?\";\n3) \"Have you ever felt bad or guilty about drinking?\";\nand 4) \"Have you ever taken a drink first thing in the\nmorning to steady your nerves (an eye-opener)!\". A\nscore of 2 or more is indicative of alcohol abuse.\nSmoking. Markers were created for current smok-\ners and for former smokers who had quit smoking\nwithin the past 10 years. Nonsmokers and those who\nhad quit more than 10 years previously formed the\nreference group.\nOverweight. Respondents at or below 90 percent\nof their ideal body mass were considered underweight,\nwhile those at or above 140 percent of their ideal body\nmass were considered obese. Those between 91 and\n139 percent of their ideal body mass formed the ref-\nerence group.\nPhysical activity. A set of three dummy variables\nwas used to capture physical activity levels. A high\nlevel of physical activity was represented by a self-\nreport of vigorous physical activity (e.g., swimming,\naerobics, biking) at least once per week. A medium\nlevel of physical activity was represented by a self-\nreport of moderate physical activity (e.g., gardening)\nat least once per week but no weekly vigorous physical\nactivity. Reports of no weekly vigorous or moderate\nphysical activity formed the reference category.\nDisease was represented by a series of indicator\nvariables for self-reports of chronic disease. In the\nHealth and Retirement Survey, it is possible to identify\nthose who report having been told by a doctor that they\nhave high blood pressure or hypertension, diabetes or\nhigh blood sugar, cancer (other than skin cancer), or\nchronic lung disease (excluding asthma) such as\nchronic bronchitis or emphysema. Respondents were\nalso asked, in a single question, whether they had ever\nbeen told by a doctor that they had angina, coronary\nheart disease, congestive heart failure, heart attack, or\nanother heart problem. In a separate question, respon-\ndents were asked whether they had ever been told by\na doctor that they had had a stroke. Finally, respon-\ndents were asked whether they had ever had or had\never been told by a doctor that they had arthritis or\nrheumatism, and whether they had seen a doctor for\npsychiatric problems in the past year.\nMeasures for physical impairments captured infor-\nmation on sensory deficits and pain. Vision impair-\nment has important consequences for difficulty and\nfunctional limitation, while the role of hearing impair-\nment appears to be less significant (15, 16). Vision and\nhearing were self-rated by the use of glasses, contact\nlenses, or hearing aids, with responses dichotomized\nas fair/poor eyesight or hearing versus other. Pain was\ndefined as a positive response to the question, \"Are\nyou often troubled with pain?\" Experimental studies\nhave demonstrated that such self-reports of pain are\nDependent variable\nThe lower body mobility scale consisted of reports\nof any difficulty in performing three mobility tasks:\n1) walking one block, 2) walking several blocks, and\n3) climbing one flight of stairs without resting. At\nbaseline, the questions read, \"How difficult is it for\nyou to ... ?\", and the possible responses were \"not at\nall,\" \"a little,\" \"somewhat,\" \"very,\" and \"don't do.\" At\nfollow-up, the questions read, \"Do you have any dif-\nficulty with ... ?\", and the response set consisted of\n\"yes,\" \"no,\" and \"don't do.\" We coded the baseline\nresponses of \"a little,\" \"somewhat,\" and \"very\" and\nthe follow-up response of \"yes\" as l's, indicating\ndifficulty. Accordingly, possible scores on the three-\nitem scale ranged from 0 (no difficulty on any item) to\n3 (difficulty on every item). Persons who reported that\nthey did not do the activity (less than 2 percent of the\nsample) were not included in our analyses. Explor-\natory factor analysis models yielded minimum factor\nAnalyses\nIn hierarchical logistic regression, variables are en-\ntered sequentially into successive models, allowing the\nestimation of both direct and indirect effects of inde-\npendent variables. In the analyses described here, we\nestimated mobility difficulty onset and recovery in\nseparate models and sequentially incorporated catego-\nries of variables one at a time. We first incorporated\nsociodemographic characteristics and then economic\nmeasures, followed by health behavior measures,\nchronic disease indicators, and finally physical impair-\nments. In this way, we were able to separate the\nindirect effects and direct effects of each of the cate-\ngories of variables. Model fit was assessed through the\nuse of the receiver operating characteristic curve and\nthe Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit-statistic (18).\nRESULTS\nThe incidence of recovery from mobility difficulty\nwas substantially greater than the incidence of onset\nwho reported having difficulty at baseline no longer\nreported difficulty at follow-up, while slightly more\nTABLE 1.

In addition, 53 percent of those who had recovered\nby the time of the 2-year follow-up had recovered\nfrom a self-report of \"a little\" difficulty on just one\nlower body item at baseline (data not shown).\nTo conserve space, we have not shown comparisons\nbetween the measured characteristics of persons with\nand without difficulty at baseline. Because of the large\nsample size, most differences were statistically signif-\nicant. With the exception of sex, however, sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics did not vary substantially by\nbaseline difficulty status; 52 percent of respondents\nwithout difficulty were female versus 66 percent of\nthose with difficulty. On the other hand, several of the\neconomic indicators varied substantially by difficulty\nstatus. The percentages of respondents with low fam-\nily income, low net worth, and Medicaid insurance\nwere over two times higher among those with baseline\nmobility difficulty. Similarly, those with difficulty\nwere twice as likely to be at 140 percent or more of\ntheir ideal body mass and to report low physical ac-\ntivity, and they were 50 percent more likely to cur-\nrently smoke. Chronic diseases and physical impair-\nments were all 50-150 percent more prevalent among\npersons with difficulty.\nAdjusted odds ratios from the hierarchical analysis\nof difficulty onset are shown in table 2. Model 1\nindicated that Mexican Americans were 2.8 times and\nAfrican Americans 1.7 times as likely to experience\ndifficulty onset as were Caucasians, while females\nwere nearly 1.7 times as likely to experience onset as\nmales. Each year of age was associated with a 1.06\ngreater risk of difficulty onset. In a separate model\n(data not shown), we tested the assumption of linearity\nby replacing the continuous age variable with a set of\nreference age group). Those analyses showed that the\nrisk of difficulty onset was equivalent for persons aged\nModel 2 incorporated economic indicators.

The effects\nof female sex and age, on the other hand, remained and\ndid not appear to indirectly affect difficulty onset via\neconomic status. Each year of education was associ-\nated with an 11 percent lower likelihood of onset,\nwhile a net worth of $10,000 or less was associated\nwith a 96 percent increase in the likelihood of onset.\nPersons with private health insurance were 0.56 times\nas likely to experience onset as those without it.

Persons with a baseline body mass index of\n140 percent or more of their ideal weight were 2.3\ntimes as likely to experience difficulty onset as those\nwith a body mass index in the 91st--139th percentile,\nand those who smoked at baseline were 1.6 times as\nlikely to experience onset as nonsmokers. Respon-\ndents who scored 2 or more on the CAGE alcohol\nabuse scale were 1.4 times as likely to experience\nonset as those who scored less than 2, while those who\nreported participating in vigorous physical activities at\nleast once per week at baseline were 0.63 times as\nlikely to experience onset as those who engaged in no\nphysical activity.\nAlthough there is some indication that a small por-\ntion of the effects of obesity may have operated indi-\nrectly via chronic disease, the majority of the effects of\nmodel 3 were unchanged in model 4. Persons who\nreported having been diagnosed with arthritis or heart\ndisease were 1.5 times as likely to experience diffi-\nculty onset as those who did not.\nPhysical impairments were incorporated in model 5.\nPersons who reported being often bothered by pain at\nbaseline were 2.1 times as likely to experience diffi-\nculty onset as those who did not, and those reporting\nfair or poor eyesight were 1.6 times as likely. The\neffects of arthritis and heart disease were no longer\nsignificant with the addition of physical impairments,\nand separate analyses (not shown) indicated that this\nmodest drop was the result of an indirect effect via\npain. The receiver operating characteristic (0.766) and\nHosmer-Lemeshow (p = 0.322) statistics suggested\nthat this final model had an acceptable fit to the data.\nWe incorporated a few select interaction terms one\nat a time into model 5. Following the findings and\nspeculations of other authors, we tested for interac-\ntions between indicators for arthritis and obesity\nAfrican-American ethnicity (21), diabetes and African-\nAmerican ethnicity (22), and non-US birth and\nMexican-American ethnicity (23). None of these terms\nwere statistically significant.\nTable 3 shows results from logistic regression anal-\nysis for recovery of lower body function. The five\nmodels created were identical to those for difficulty\nonset, with the exceptions that no interaction terms\nwere estimated (there are no existing reports or hy-\npotheses with which to guide tests of interaction terms\nfor recovery from mobihty difficulty) and an indicator\nvariable was included in each model for persons who\nrecovered from a report of \"a little\" difficulty on just\none item at baseline. (These recoveries were modest\nand would be the most likely to be influenced by\ninstrumentation changes between baseline and follow-\nup.) The estimates shown at the top of table 3 under\n\"Model 1\" indicate that persons with \"a little\" diffi-\nculty on just one item had a 3.2 times' greater likeli-\nhood of recovery than those with greater levels of\nbaseline difficulty. In addition, with all variables con-\ntrolled (i.e., model 5), persons with \"a little\" difficulty\non just one item at baseline had a 2.3 times' greater\nlikelihood of recovery.\nAlthough model 1 of table 2 showed that Mexican-\nand African-American respondents were more likely\nto experience difficulty onset, the estimates shown in\nmodel 1 of table 3 do not indicate any effects of\nethnicity on recovery; neither are any sex effects ap-\nparent. Age had a modest negative association with\nrecovery in model 1, and the incorporation of eco-\nnomic indicators in model 2 did not alter that effect.\nEach year of education (model 2) was associated with\na 1.06-fold greater likelihood of recovery. Respon-\ntimes as likely to recover as those with a greater net\nworth, and those with Medicaid insurance were 0.41\ntimes as likely to recover.\nBaseline health behaviors were incorporated in\nmodel 3, and none of them affected the odds of recov-\nery. The associations of age and Medicaid insurance\nshown in model 3 were reduced somewhat by the\nincorporation of chronic disease in model 4, suggest-\ning that older respondents and those on Medicaid were\nless likely to recover in part because of greater comor-\nbidity. Having high blood pressure, diabetes, lung\ndisease, or arthritis lowered the likelihood of recovery\nModel 5 indicated that persons who reported at\nbaseline that they were often bothered by pain were\n0.55 times as likely to experience recovery as those\nwho were not often bothered by pain. As with diffi-\nculty onset, model 5 suggested an indirect effect of\narthritis via pain. A CAGE score of 2 or more had a\nmarginal positive association with the odds of recov-\nery.

The strongest predictors of\ndifficulty onset were female sex, less education, lack\nof private health insurance, high body mass index, and\nfrequent pain. Age, low net worth, current smoking,\nlack of physical activity, and fair or poor eyesight\nwere also significant predictors of onset. Predictors of\n2-year recovery from difficulty were few, and with the\nexception of being bothered by pain, they differed\nfrom predictors of onset in this late-middle-aged\ngroup.

The presence\nof some unique predictors and the apparently consid-\nerable differences in the effects of the various eco-\nnomic status indicators suggest that separate theoreti-\ncal frameworks of onset and recovery may be\nnecessary. At the very least, further investigation of\nthe unique effects of the various economic indicators\nseems warranted.\nFew indirect mechanisms for onset and recovery\nwere identified. Arthritis operated via pain, and\nMexican- and African-American ethnicity operated\nvia economic status. The considerable and persistent\ndirect effects of economic indicators on recovery and\nonset are perplexing. With baseline sociodemographic\ncharacteristics, health behaviors, chronic disease, and\nphysical impairments controlled, respondents with low\neducational attainment, low net worth, or no private\ninsurance were at substantially greater risk of diffi-\nculty onset. Persons with Medicaid insurance were\nnearly one half as likely to recover as persons without\nMedicaid. While health insurance status may change\nfrequently, net worth and education are relatively sta-\nble and are likely to capture a person's economic\nstatus over the course of adulthood. This supports the\nview that poor economic status represents a cumula-\ntive health risk that accrues over many years.\nFemales were more likely than males to have mo-\nbility difficulty at baseline and to experience onset of\nmobility difficulty, but they were no more likely to\nrecover. This is consistent with the findings of other\nstudies (24-26) which have shown that females have\npoorer functional status scores at baseline and experi-\nence greater average rates of decline over periods\nranging from 2 years to 10 years. What is not fully\nconsistent with existing literature is our finding that\nthe effects of female sex remained essentially un-\nchanged after the incorporation of economic, health\nbehavior, chronic disease, and physical impairment\nmeasures. Other investigators have shown that these\ngreater rates of difficulty among women are in large\npart determined by economic indicators. Maddox and\nClark (24) found that income and education accounted\nfor a majority of the greater mean rates of and 10-year\ndeclines in functional status among women relative to\nBird (26) had access to data on a wide range of social\nand behavioral predictors, and they found that among\nadults aged 18 years and over, female sex disadvan-\ntages in difficulty, morbidity, and perceived health\nwere statistically accounted for by these predictors.\nThere are three potential explanations for the differ-\nences in the findings associated with female sex in this\nreport and those of other researchers (24-26). First,\neach study used different measures of mobility diffi-\nculty, and direct and indirect predictors for difficulty\nare likely to depend on the particular measures em-\nployed. In fact, Wolinsky et al. (6) used a mobility\ndifficulty measure very similar to that used here, and\ntheir results showed that females aged S70 years were\nmore likely than males to experience decline even\nafter data were controlled for sociodemographic, eco-\nnomic, and disease indicators. Second, the study by\nVerbrugge (25) and Ross and Bird (26) used cross-\nsectional data; the predictors may account for sex\ndifferences at a particular point in time but not account\nfor differences in prospective risk. This hypothesis,\nhowever, is not consistent with the panel data results\nreported by Maddox and Clark (24). Third, Verbrugge\n(25) and Ross and Bird (26) had access to information\non psychosocial measures such as stress, sense of\ncontrol, and health attitudes, and these psychosocial\nfactors may be the primary source of sex differences in\ndifficulty and/or perceived health. Again, however,\nthis hypothesis is not fully consistent with the findings\nof other studies. Thus, the hypothesis that would seem\nmost consistent with the findings of each of these\nstudies is that different measures of physical function\nand health status have very different predictors.\nThe primary limitation of these analyses is the mod-\nest change in wording between the baseline and\nfollow-up questions on mobility difficulty. It has been\nshown that differences in the wording of questions can\nproduce quite different rates of difficulty (27). Thus,\nwe were concerned that the modest change in instru-\nmentation might have biased the results. Fortunately,\nseveral questionnaire modules were tested in baseline\nsubsamples, and one of those modules (n = 684)\nincluded a \"difficulty\" question with the same stem\nand response set as those used at follow-up (i.e., \"Do\nyou have any difficulty ... ?\"/[\"yes,\" \"no,\" \"don't\ndo\"]). However, \"Do you have any difficulty walk-\ning?\" was the only module question that was similar to\nthe lower body items included in our scale. Compar-\nison of the distribution of responses to this module\nquestion with the distribution of responses on the\nlower body scale item, \"How much difficulty do you\nhave walking several blocks?\", yielded an expected\npattern. Ninety-two percent of those who responded\naffirmatively to the module question also reported\nhaving at least \"a little\" difficulty walking several\nblocks. Eight-five percent of those who responded\nnegatively to the module question also reported no\ndifficulty in walking several blocks. Nonetheless, as\nan added safeguard, we also implemented the models\nwith alternative coding schemes. Persons who re-\nported having \"a little\" difficulty at baseline, for ex-\nample, were coded zero along with those who reported\nhaving no difficulty. Results from analyses based on\nOnset of and Recovery from Mobility Difficulty 71\nthis and other alternative coding schemes did not differ\nsignificantly from those shown. Therefore, it is un-\nlikely that the modest change in instrumentation af-\nfected these findings.\nThe identification of predictors of difficulty through\nsurvey data is a necessary but insufficient step toward\nthe identification of modifiable risk factors. Predictors\nwere categorized into blocks, and we incorporated\nthese blocks into the models one at a time in hopes of\nisolating the impact of modifiable predictors. This\napproach had limited success. Female sex is clearly\nimmutable, and net worth and education are also es-\nsentially immutable. Whether or not the remaining\nsignificant predictors are modifiable depends in large\npart on the social and cultural context in which the\npredictors exist (28). The perception of pain, for ex-\nample, might be modifiable through pain management\ntechniques, but these techniques may not be accept-\nable in some subcultures. Improvements in insurance\ncoverage do not appear possible in the current political\ncontext of the United States. Similarly, rates of obe-\nsity, smoking, and physical activity, and thus of lung\ndisease, diabetes, and several other chronic diseases, will\nbe more modifiable in some contexts than in others.\nMobility difficulty appears to play a very large role\nin health and disability in later life, and the older adult\npopulation is projected to increase substantially in the\ncoming decades. Identification of modifiable predic-\ntors and their social contexts will play an important\nrole in reducing the dependency rates and care costs\nassociated with such disability in future cohorts of\nolder adults.\n"
