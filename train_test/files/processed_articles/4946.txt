We grouped states by political party control and compared their reactions across these policy goals. To\nidentify changes in states' rate review programs and anticipated loss ratio requirements in the individual and small group\nmarkets since the ACA's enactment, we conducted legal research and contacted each state's insurance regulator. We\nlinked rate review program changes to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) criteria for an effective rate\nreview program. We found, of states that did not meet CMS's criteria when the ACA was enacted, most made changes\nto meet those criteria, including Republican-controlled states, which generally oppose the ACA. This finding is likely the\nresult of the relatively low administrative burden associated with reviewing health insurance rates and the fact that doing so\nprevents federal intervention in rate review. However, Republican-controlled states were less likely than non-Republican-\ncontrolled states to increase their anticipated loss ratio requirements to align with the federal retrospective medical loss\nratio requirement, expand Medicaid, and establish state-based exchanges, because of their general opposition to the ACA.\nWe conclude that federal incentives for states to strengthen their health insurance rate review programs were more effective\nthan the incentives for states to adopt other insurance-related policy goals of the ACA.\n",

Scheffler, PhD1\n Keywords\nhealth care reform, Affordable Care Act, health insurance rate review, policy implementation, federalism, politics\nOriginal Research\nIntroduction\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) sought to increase access to\nmore affordable health insurance through a number of provi-\nsions. It expanded Medicaid eligibility and provided pre-\nmium tax credits to households with incomes between 100%\nand 400% of the federal poverty level that purchased insur-\nance within the ACA's newly established health insurance\nexchanges (or marketplaces). These provisions increased\naccess to insurance; however, that access is unaffordable to\nmany individuals and small employers because of rising\nhealth insurance premiums.1\nTo try to reduce the health insurance premium growth,\nsome stakeholders wanted the ACA to give the federal gov-\nernment the authority to reject proposed health insurance rate\nincreases determined to be unreasonable. But in the end, poli-\ncymakers compromised by including incentives to strengthen\nstates' health insurance rate review programs and by estab-\nlishing a federal medical loss ratio requirement. Since the\nACA's enactment, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid\nServices (CMS) has made annual and ad hoc evaluations to\ndetermine whether each state's rate review program is\neffective.2-5 CMS bases its determination on whether the state\n(1) receives sufficient data and documentation to determine\nthe reasonableness of the proposed rate increase (whereby the\nrate is the unit price of insurance, and the premium is based\non the rate coupled with the benefit design and allowable rat-\ning factors, such as age, geography, family composition, and\ntobacco use); (2) conducts a timely review that considers\nchanges in factors such as medical cost, utilization, benefits,\nand cost sharing; and (3) bases its determination of the rea-\nsonableness of rate increases on a standard that is set forth in\n1University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, USA\n2University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nBrent D. Fulton, University of California, Berkeley, 50 University Hall,\nEmail: fultonb@berkeley.edu\nstate statute or regulation.6 Beginning September 1, 2011, in\nthe individual and small group markets, non-grandfathered\nhealth insurance annualized rate increases of 10% or more\nmust either be reviewed by the state or CMS for reasonable-\nness. States with an effective rate review program conduct the\nreview and make this determination, but CMS plays this role\nfor states with ineffective rate review programs. The ACA\nallocated $250 million for states to bolster their rate review\nprograms, including helping states to establish effective pro-\ngrams. The grants have been used by 44 states to hire and\ncontract with actuaries, upgrade information systems, and\nenhance rate transparency.7,8\nIn addition to incentivizing states to impede unreasonable\npremium rate increases, the ACA encourages states to play a\nrole in expanding insurance coverage. A number of studies\nhave examined the factors that led states to decide whether to\nexpand Medicaid or establish a state-based exchange.9-13\nPolitics loomed large in both decisions. Beland, Rocco, and\nWaddan found that Medicaid expansion and state-based\nexchange decisions required institutional coordination\nbetween the federal and state governments, further compli-\ncated by the fact that most states needed both the governor's\nand legislature's approval.9 Jones and colleagues describe\nhow several Republican-controlled states, which were ini-\ntially receptive to establishing state-based exchanges, acqui-\nesced in the face of intense political pressure to oppose the\nHowever, politics was not the only factor in state decision\nmaking. Although Democratically controlled states were\nmore likely to expand Medicaid than Republican-controlled\nstates, economic circumstances, previous Medicaid expan-\nsion, and administrative capacity all played a role in states'\ndecisions to expand Medicaid.11 Haeder and Weimer discuss\nthe influence of state insurance commissioners and existing\nadministrative capacity within states that established state-\nTo our knowledge, however, no studies have examined\nwhich states, by political party control, decided to establish\nan effective rate review program and create an anticipated\nloss ratio requirement that is consistent with the federal ret-\nrospective medical loss ratio requirement. In the remainder\nof this article, we first examine CMS's determinations of the\neffectiveness of each state's rate review program over time\nand highlight the states that took actions to become effective.\nSecond, we report the share of states, by political party con-\ntrol, that made changes to become effective rate review pro-\ngrams, increased their anticipated loss ratio requirement to\nalign with the federal medical loss ratio requirement,\nexpanded Medicaid, and established a state-based exchange.\nWe statistically test whether these 4 decisions differed by\nstate political party control. Our hypothesis is that although\nRepublican-controlled states generally oppose the ACA as a\nwhole and chose to not emulate the federal medical loss\nratio, not expand Medicaid, nor establish a state-based\nexchange, they would nonetheless establish effective rate\nreview programs at a similar rate to non-Republican-con-\ntrolled states, because reviewing rates has a relatively low\nadministrative burden and doing so would prevent federal\nreview of their carriers' rates.\nData and Methods\nWhereas several studies have documented states' rate review\nand anticipated loss ratio laws at a point in time,14-21 we are\nthe first to document changes over time between 2010 and\n2013. Our sources included statutes, regulations, and insur-\nance department bulletins. We also examined states' cycle I\nand II grant applications \"Grants to States for Health Insurance\nPremium Review\" submitted to CMS, states' medical loss\nratio waiver applications submitted to the U.S. Department of\nHealth and Human Services (DHHS), and the studies refer-\nenced above. After completing this legal research, we con-\ntacted state legislative librarians to review our findings. We\nthen contacted the state agency that regulated health insur-\nance to review our findings and to better understand their rate\nreview programs. We received a full response from 47 state\nregulators and the District of Columbia, and a partial response\nfrom three state regulators, and thus relied on in-state health\ninsurance experts to confirm our findings.\nSince the enactment of the ACA, CMS has continually\ndetermined the effectiveness of each state's rate review pro-\ngram (using the criteria discussed in the Introduction), and\nhas published its determinations as of the following dates:\ncategories:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Always Had Effective Rate Review Program: States\nthat CMS determined to have effective rate review\nprograms for all major types of carriers (ie, for-profit\ninsurers, non-profits, and health maintenance organi-\nzations [HMOs]) for each of its reviews, and based on\nour analysis, had already met CMS's effectiveness\ncriteria when the ACA was enacted.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Effective Rate Review Program via Changes: States\nthat made changes to rate review statutes or regula-\ntions after the ACA was enacted to become effective\nrate review programs. Many of these states did not\nreceive an \"ineffective\" determination from CMS,\nbecause the change was made prior to CMS's first\ndetermination, effective July 1, 2011. We identified\nthese states by linking their statutory and regulatory\nrate review changes to CMS's effectiveness criteria,\nto determine which states met CMS's effectiveness\ncriteria as a result of the changes.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Ineffective Rate Review Program: States that had an\nPrior to the ACA, many states established an anticipated\nloss ratio requirement within a law, regulation, or bulletin for\nFulton et al 3\nthe individual and small group markets.20 The state loss\nratios were strictly based on the share of premiums repre-\nsented by medical claims,22 whereas the federal medical loss\nratio allows for quality improvement adjustments as well as\ntax, license, and regulatory fee adjustments, reducing the tra-\nditionally defined state loss ratio by a few percentage points.\nTherefore, we assumed that a 75% state loss ratio require-\nment was equivalent to the 80% federal medical loss ratio\nrequirement. In the individual market, DHHS granted 7 of\nthe 17 states that applied for temporary relief to lower the\nfederal medical loss ratio threshold to between 65% and 75%\nthe individual market and 13 states in the small group market\nalready had anticipated loss ratio requirements for their\nmajor types of carriers when the ACA was enacted; however,\nonly 3 states in the individual market and 5 states in the small\ngroup market had a requirement of at least 75%. Hence, we\nexamined whether the remaining states and the District of\nColumbia established or increased their anticipated loss ratio\nAlthough the ACA did not have an explicit financial incen-\ntive for states to establish an anticipated loss ratio that is con-\nsistent with the federal medical loss ratio, increasing carriers'\nloss ratios was a goal of the ACA. This goal creates an\nimplicit incentive, because a state does not want to determine\na rate increase to be reasonable and then systematically have\ncarriers' medical loss ratios exceed the 80% federal medical\nloss ratio threshold.\nFor Medicaid expansion and state-based exchange deci-\nsions, we relied on secondary sources. Twenty-seven states\nand the District of Columbia (or 55%) expanded Medicaid as\nColumbia (or 37%) established state-based exchanges as of\nOctober 1, 2013, the beginning of the first open enrollment\nperiod.25,26 Mississippi and Utah only established their\nexchanges in the small group market. Furthermore, Nevada,\nNew Mexico, and Oregon have subsequently decided to have\na federally supported state-based exchange in which they\nrely on the federal Web site and information technology;\nhowever, we based our analysis on their October 1, 2013,\nWe classified states' political party control as of January\nRepublican Party or Democratic Party, respectively, con-\ntrolled both houses and the governor's office.28 Otherwise\nstates were considered divided.\nWe used a Fisher exact test to test whether the percentage\nof states that adopted these 4 policy goals differed by politi-\ncal party control. We used this test because the decision was\nbinary and the expected frequency of particular cells was less\nthan 5.29 We used a McNemar exact test to test whether\nRepublican-controlled states adopted these 4 policies at dif-\nferent rates, because the data were generated from the same\nsample of states, the decision was binary, and the expected\nfrequency of particular cells was less than 5. This test\nincluded only the sub-sample of Republican-controlled states\nthat had not adopted the policies being compared prior to the\nACA. Results were considered statistically significant if the\nP value was less than .05 using a 2-tailed test.\nResults\nStatus of the Effectiveness of States' Health\nInsurance Rate Review Programs\nFigures 1 and 2 show the effectiveness status of each state's\nrate review program in the individual and small group mar-\nmaps show that 37 states in the individual market and 27\nstates in the small group market that CMS determined to\nhave effective rate review programs for each of its reviews,\nand based on our analysis, had already met CMS's effective-\nness criteria when the ACA was enacted. However, as we\ndiscuss below, altogether, 9 states in the individual market\nand 19 states in the small group market responded to the\nCMS incentive and became effective rate review programs.\nFour states in the individual market and 13 states in the\nsmall group market took actions after the ACA was enacted\nthat enabled them to have effective rate review programs by\nSeptember 1, 2011, the date for which CMS or the state\nwould review rate increases of 10% or more (see \"Effective\nRate Review Program via Changes\" states with two or three\nasterisks in Figures 1 and 2). For example, Georgia had only\nan \"informational only\" filing requirement for most rate\nrevisions in the individual and small group markets. In 2011,\nnity plans, preferred provider organizations, and Blue Cross\nBlue Shield plans to file rate increases of 10% or more, so\nthat the state could review the reasonableness of those\nincreases.\nMeanwhile, 5 states in the individual market and 6 states\nin the small group market, which CMS initially determined\nto have ineffective rate review programs, took action after\nthe September 1, 2011, deadline to become effective (see\n\"Effective Rate Review Program via Changes\" states with no\nasterisks in Figures 1 and 2). For example, although\nPennsylvania had prior approval authority over all carrier\ntypes in the individual market as well as HMOs and non-\nprofit carriers in the small group market, it had no rate filing\nrequirements for for-profit insurers in the small group mar-\nket, and thus, was considered ineffective.2 However, in late\nauthority over those insurers, enabling it to become an effec-\ntive rate review program.3\nFinally, 5 states in both the individual and small group\nmarkets currently have an ineffective rate review program.\nThis includes both Oklahoma and Texas, which had effective\nrate review programs in 2011, but decided to not comply\nwith reviewing certain federal rate review requirements.\nFigure 2.

We found that these states were less likely to adopt\nthe other policy areas and the differences were statistically sig-\nnificant: establishing or increasing their anticipated loss ratio\nFor example, South Carolina, a Republican-controlled\nstate that neither expanded Medicaid nor established a state-\nbased exchange, had prior approval authority over some\ntypes of plans in the small group market, but no filing\nrequirement for most insurers, non-profit carriers, and\nitself prior approval authority over those carriers' rates,\neffective September 1, 2011. This change enabled the state to\nbecome an effective rate review program.2\nDiscussion\nThe ACA included financial and regulatory incentives and\ngoals for states to bolster their health insurance rate review\nprograms, increase their anticipated loss ratio requirements,\nexpand Medicaid, and establish state-based exchanges. Both\nRepublican-controlled and non-Republican-controlled states\nestablished effective rate review programs at a high rate: For\nRepublican-controlled states, the rates were 50% and 69% in\nthe individual and small group markets, respectively, and for\nnon-Republican-controlled states, the rates were 83% and\n91% in the individual and small group markets, respectively.\nHowever, Republican-controlled states were less likely than\nnon-Republican-controlled states to establish or increase\nanticipated loss ratio requirement to be at least 75% (only in\nthe small group market), expand Medicaid, and establish a\nstate-based exchange. Particularly in the small group market,\nRepublican-controlled states were more likely to establish an\neffective rate review program than to establish or increase\ntheir anticipated loss ratio requirement to be consistent with\nthe federal retrospective medical loss ratio requirement,\nexpand Medicaid, or establish a state-based exchange.\nThe ACA's attempt to strengthen states' health insurance\nrate review programs is reminiscent of the ACA's Medicaid\nexpansion. Under both policies, the federal government set\nminimum standards and provided financial incentives for\nstates to pursue a federalist policy goal.\nThere is a notable difference, however. For rate review pro-\ngrams, the ACA created a clear federal role for non-compliant\nstates. Specifically, CMS reviews non-grandfathered carriers'\nrate increases of 10% or more in the individual and small\ngroup markets in states with ineffective rate review programs.\nThis incentivized states, including Republican-controlled\nstates that generally oppose the ACA, to establish effective\nrate review programs. For example, in April 2011, Idaho's\nordering executive agencies to not implement the ACA; how-\never, in August 2011, the Idaho Department of Insurance\nreceived a waiver to begin conducting rate review in compli-\nance with theACA, in part, \"to help preserve state oversight of\nrates.\"30 In contrast, there was no federal intervention for\nstates that did not expand Medicaid, because the U.S. Supreme\nCourt ruled that hinging all federal Medicaid funding on a\nstate's decision to expand Medicaid was overly coercive.31\nAlthough most Republican-controlled states bolstered\ntheir rate review programs to become effective, in part, to\nprevent federal review of their carriers' rate increases, only\n5% of all Republican-controlled states in the individual mar-\nket and only 10% of all Republican-controlled states in the\nsmall group market established state-based exchanges to\navoid the federally facilitated exchange. Establishing a state-\nbased exchange, because of its visibility, could be construed\nas a tacit endorsement of the ACA. In fact, the American\nLegislative Exchange Council advocated for states to not\nestablish state-based exchanges as a way to oppose the\nFulton et al 7\nACA.32 Furthermore, the administrative burden to establish a\nstate-based exchange is significant. DHHS grants totaled\nover $4 billion for states to establish state-based exchanges,\n16-fold more than the $250 million in grants for states to\nbolster their rate review programs.7,8,25 This administrative\nburden has a greater impact on Republican states, which are\nmore likely to have lower capacity state governments.33\nThis study has 3 primary limitations. The small sample\nsize of 50 states and the District of Columbia limits our\npower to detect statistical differences, potentially resulting in\nnot rejecting the null hypothesis when there is a substantive\ndifference. Notwithstanding the small sample size, we were\nable to detect important statistical differences.\nSecond, we do not incorporate how states reviewed health\ninsurance rates sold through associations. Prior to the ACA,\nstates often regulated associations' rates in the large group\nmarket, or had less stringent requirements if they regulated\nthem in the individual and small group markets.34,35 However,\nas of November 1, 2011, associations are subject to rate\nreview regulations under the individual and small group\nmarkets.36 Therefore, a few states with effective rate review\nprograms were considered to be ineffective in reviewing\nassociations' rates.4\nThird, most states made decisions and changes related to\nrate review, loss ratios, Medicaid expansion, and state-based\nNovember 2010 elections. Only Louisiana and Mississippi\nchanged political party control in 2012, both from divided\ncontrol to Republican control. In a few states, a policy change\nparty control than 2011; however, these rare events did not\naffect our main findings.\nConclusion\nIn principle, federalism combines state policy innovation and\nadministration with federal financing and minimum stan-\ndards, all of which are present in the ACA.37-39 The ACA\nsought to increase access to more affordable health insurance.\nIt provided financial and regulatory incentives and goals for\nstates to establish effective health insurance rate review pro-\ngrams, emulate the federal retrospective medical loss ratio\nrequirement, expand Medicaid, and establish health insurance\nexchanges. Although the federalist goal for states to establish\neffective rate review programs was largely accomplished,\nincluding within Republican-controlled states, these states\ngenerally did not emulate the federal retrospective medical\nloss ratio requirement, expand Medicaid, or establish state-\nbased exchanges, because of their general opposition to the\nACA. Our findings suggest that federal incentives for states\nto strengthen their health insurance rate review programs\nwere more effective than the incentives for states to adopt\nother insurance-related policy goals of the ACA.\nAppendix\nTable A1 shows each state's and the District of Columbia's\nstatus and change in the following 4 policy areas of the\nAffordable Care Act (ACA): rate review program effective-\nness status and change since the enactment of the ACA,\nTable A1.

Rate review program effectiveness was coded based on March 23, 2010, status (when the Affordable Care Act was enacted) and April 16, 2014, status.\nAlways Eff: always had an effective rate review program since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act; Became Eff: became an effective rate review program after\na change via legislation or regulation; Ineff: ineffective rate review program as of April 16, 2014. Anticipated loss ratio requirement was coded based on March 23,\n2010, and December 31, 2013, statuses. Always 75%, always had an anticipated loss ratio requirement at or above 75% since the enactment of the Affordable Care\nAct; Became 75%, anticipated loss ratio requirement became at or above 75%; <75%, anticipated loss ratio requirement was less than 75%; None, no anticipated\nloss ratio requirement. Medicaid expansion was coded based on August 28, 2014, status. State-based exchange was coded based on October 31, 2013, status.\naThese states have \"none\" coded in the table because the major carrier type(s) based on market share in the state did not have an anticipated loss\nratio requirement; however, the following minor carrier type(s) did have an anticipated loss ratio requirement: Michigan for-profit insurers (individual\nmarket), Nevada non-profit carriers (individual and small group markets), North Carolina for-profit insurers (individual market) and health maintenance\norganizations (HMOs; individual and small group markets), and Pennsylvania for-profit insurers (individual market).\nTable A1.
