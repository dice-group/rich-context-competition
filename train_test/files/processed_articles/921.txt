There is some\nevidence that the spatial correlation of first experience with cocaine increases with percentage of\nneighbourhood households living in poverty.\nConclusions: The gradient in spatial correlation of incident cocaine experience by neighbourhood poverty\nlevel is consistent with current theories of concentrated disadvantage. The possibility that the direction of\nthe poverty gradient might change over the course of a drug epidemic is discussed.\nEarly epidemiological investigations of infectious disease,\nsuch as John Snow's study of cholera, often focused on\ngeographical variation in the occurrence of disease. They\ncompared and contrasted the characteristics of geographical\nareas in which disease clustered in an effort to uncover\naetiological clues. Snow pinpointed cases on maps that led\nhim to discover that geographical context was essential to the\nspread of cholera in London; the disease clustered in areas\nserved by a water company that drew from the polluted\ndownstream Thames but hardly at all in areas served by its\ncompetitor, which drew from an upstream source.1 Recently,\nthere has been a resurgence of interest in the context of\nhealth and illness (characteristics of the physical and social\nenvironment) as witnessed by the proliferation of ``contex-\ntual,''2 ``multilevel,''3 and ``hierarchical''4 studies in the public\nhealth and social science literatures.5 6 Some epidemiologists\nhave called for the context of disease, geographical and\notherwise, to be incorporated into risk factor epidemiology,\nthe long dominant approach that focuses on associations\nbetween individual level risk factors and the risk of illness\nwithout necessarily considering the broader context of\nThe contextual approach seeks to open the ``black box''9 of\nrisk factor epidemiology by examining whether contexts\nmight place people at risk of risks for illness.10 This study and\nour previous work11 incorporate geographical clustering, a\nnotion central to early epidemiology, into the contextual\napproach to epidemiology that has recently become popular.\nWhereas contextual analyses typically analyse whether\ngeographically defined contexts are associated with the risk\nof disease, our approach examines whether such contexts are\nrelated to the geographical clustering of disease. To demon-\nstrate our approach, we examine the extent to which incident\nexperience with cocaine clusters in relation to the geogra-\nphical context in which it occurs. Historical distance from the\nwith the availability of data from geographically sampled\nsurvey data collected during those years make cocaine a\nworthy candidate for this approach to contextual analysis.\nIn this paper we address two research questions. Firstly,\ndoes incident experience with cocaine cluster geographically\nand, if so, is the observed spatial correlation an artefact of\nneighbourhood composition? Secondly, in an attempt to\nbetter understand the spatial correlation of cocaine, this\npaper takes a cue from previous drug research and examines\nwhether the magnitude of clustering of cocaine incidence is\nassociated with neighbourhood disadvantage.13\u00ad15\nThe Office of National Drug Control Policy estimated that\nthe economic costs of illegal drug misuse in the United States\n(health care costs, loss in productivity, crime related costs,\nuse, especially in the form of ``crack,'' is growing rapidly in\nEurope, most notably in Britain.17\u00ad19 Given cocaine's past cost\nto and impact on the health of the United States, we believe\nthis study presents a timely examination of the spatial\ncorrelation of cocaine incidence and its possible association\nwith neighbourhood disadvantage.\nMETHODS\nThis paper reports the results of analyses of public use data\nfrom six years of the National Household Survey on Drug\nmultiple years of data facilitates an examination of whether\nthe results replicate.

More\nimportantly, they were collected during the downward turn\nin the most recent cocaine epidemic in the United States.12 26\nData from more recent years, after the cocaine epidemic had\nsubsided, might provide misleading results as the underlying\nfactors responsible for the epidemic might have subsided. For\nexample, if the present analyses used data from years in\nwhich the incidence of cocaine use had fallen to levels lower\nthan those observed during epidemic years, fewer neighbour-\nhood residents would be starting cocaine use, making it more\ndifficult to detect an association with neighbourhood socio-\neconomic status.\nThe NHSDA is a multistage area probability sample of\ncivilian, non-institutionalised household residents of the\nUnited States age 12 years and older. It was first conducted\nsurvey, only the 48 contiguous states were sampled; Alaska\nand Hawaii were included beginning with the 1991 survey.\nThe primary sampling units (PSUs) randomly selected in the\nfirst stage of sampling were standard metropolitan statistical\nareas, counties, groups of counties and independent cities, or\nportions of counties, or other well defined geographical units;\nfor ease of discussion, PSUs will hereinafter be referred to as\n``cities,'' the lay geographical term to which they most closely\ncorrespond. The 1990 survey oversampled the Washington,\nsamples of metropolitan Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles,\nMiami, and New York City. ``Segments'' within cities were\nselected in the second stage of sampling. Segments were\ndefined using aggregations of census blocks and enumeration\ndistricts that contained a maximum of 1000 and a minimum\nsegments will hereinafter be referred to as their closest lay\nequivalent--``neighbourhoods.'' Housing units (hereinafter\nreferred to as ``households'') within neighbourhoods were\nselected in the third stage of sampling. The fourth and final\nstage of sampling entailed selecting zero, one or two\nrespondents from individual households. Complete details\nof the survey design and sampling procedures can be found\nin official NHSDA publications. Once respondents were\nidentified, they were recruited into the study according to\nguidelines approved by an Institutional Review Board.\nRespondents who agreed to participate answered some\ninterview questions by responding to questions read aloud\nto them by an interviewer who recorded their oral answers.\nRespondents answered sensitive questions such as those\nregarding drug use by reading them from an answer sheet on\nwhich they also marked their own replies, which remained\nunknown to the interviewer. The interview response rate\nThe NHSDA interview contained modules that include\nstandardised questions about use, opportunity to use, and\nperceived harm of tobacco, alcohol and other drugs. It also\ncontained a module of questions about demographic char-\nacteristics of respondents and their families. Beginning with\nthe 1988 survey, respondents were instructed that all\nquestions about cocaine should be interpreted to include\nboth the powder form of cocaine and crack cocaine unless a\nquestion asked specifically about crack cocaine. Accordingly,\nthis study examines both forms of cocaine.\nThe inclusion of multiple respondents from a household\nmight tend to inflate estimates of geographical clustering\nwhen using simpler statistical models. To expedite statistical\ncomputations, a single respondent was randomly selected\nfrom within those households in which more than one\ninterview was conducted. Furthermore, to estimate the\nextent to which incident cocaine experience clusters, subjects\nwho were not ``at risk'' for the respective outcomes had to be\nremoved from the samples. The samples used for this study\nwere therefore smaller than the total sample sizes on the\nNHSDA public use files.\nVariables\nThis paper examines two outcomes that reflect incident\nexperience with cocaine. Two binary (yes/no) outcomes were\nconstructed from responses to the following two questions30:\n(1) ``About how old were you when you first had a chance to\ntry cocaine, in any form, if you had wanted to?''; (2) ``About\nhow old were you the first time you actually used cocaine, in\nany form, even once?'' The two outcomes will be referred to\nherein as first had opportunity and first used cocaine,\nrespectively.\nIf neighbourhoods and cities differ in terms of their\ncomposition with respect to factors associated with these\noutcomes, it is possible that estimates of geographical\nclustering could be artefacts of these differences. For this\nreason, seven categorical sociodemographic covariates asso-\nciated with cocaine use33 are incorporated into all of the\nmodels reported herein in an effort to examine whether their\nstatistical adjustment might attenuate the estimates of\ngeographical clustering of the outcomes. These seven\ncategorical covariates are: age, race, hispanic ethnicity, sex,\nmarital status, employment status, and educational attain-\nment.\nTwo additional individual level categorical covariates were\nalso included in the analyses for the purposes of adjustment.\nPeople from the same socioeconomic status (SES) tend to\ncluster their residences in self selected neighbourhoods.34\nBecause this paper examines whether cocaine outcomes\ncluster based on geographical area of residence, it is therefore\nnecessary to adjust for SES. We use the combination of\neducational attainment and occupation to measure SES.35\nBecause adolescents were included in the sample, we\nmeasure occupation of chief wage earner (CWE) in house-\nhold, which breaks the Census Bureau's 16 occupational\ngroups into six categories.36 Two additional categories were\nadded to accommodate respondents who: (a) reported their\nhouseholds had no CWE or that the household CWE does not\nwork; (b) did not report the occupation of their household\nThe other individual level covariate included for the\npurposes of adjustment is residential mobility. This binary\ncovariate (moved/did not move) was constructed from\nresponses to the following question: ``How many times in\nthe past five years have you moved?''23 Beyond its reported\nassociation with the cocaine outcomes,33 residential mobility\nis used in an attempt to adjust for the presence of selection\neffects. Cocaine users might cluster in particular neighbour-\nhoods by way of two different processes or some combination\nthereof. People with a proclivity to use or have opportunity to\nuse cocaine might migrate to certain locations, thereby\nselecting the neighbourhoods in which they cluster.\nSelection effects might also occur when persons who are\nnot likely to use or have opportunity to use cocaine selectively\nmigrate from particular neighbourhoods, leaving behind a\ncluster of persons who do have these characteristics.37 The\nanalyses reported in this paper attempt to adjust for selection\neffects by incorporating this measure of residential mobility\nas a covariate in our analyses.\nFinally, of the few neighbourhood level measures of\nneighbourhood disadvantage available on the NHSDA public\nuse data files examined herein, we chose the only one that\nallowed for examination of a gradient in within neighbour-\nhood clustering. This measure of disadvantage, percentage of\nhouseholds in poverty, is derived from 1990 census data. It is\nwww.jech.com\nand appears as a six category variable (quintiles plus a\nmissing category) to prevent possible disclosure of any\nrespondent's identity.\nStatistical methods\nThe extent to which the binary cocaine outcomes co-occur\nwithin geographical areas can be quantified using alternating\nlogistic regressions (ALR), a recently developed statistical\nmethod.38 The ALR method uses first order generalised\nestimating equations39 to regress a binary outcome on\ncovariates while simultaneously estimating a pairwise odds\nratio (PWOR) by regressing each binary response in a\ngeographical area on others from the same geographical\narea. To address the first research question, we use ALR to\nquantify the extent to which first experience with cocaine\nclusters within US cities and neighbourhoods. To quantify\ngeographical clustering in this way necessitates the estima-\ntion of nested models because neighbourhoods are nested\nwithin cities. To address the second research question, we use\nALR with a contextual pairwise model to quantify the extent to\nwhich incident experience with cocaine clusters within\nneighbourhoods by level of neighbourhood disadvantage\n(see appendix).\nRESULTS\nTable 1 displays the number of cities, neighbourhoods and\nrespondents in each of the six NHSDA samples after removal\nof respondents not ``at risk'' of the respective outcome (that is,\nthose who had their first opportunity to use cocaine, or first\nused cocaine, more than five years ago).

It presents\nthe first quantitative estimates of the magnitude of spatial\ncorrelation of incident experience with cocaine at two levels\nof analysis, neighbourhoods and cities, and by level of\nneighbourhood disadvantage. The findings are replicated\nusing six separate years of survey data collected during the\ndownward turn in the most recent US cocaine epidemic. First\nopportunity to use cocaine co-occurs within neighbourhoods\nfrom 1.2 to 1.7 times more often than one would expect if it\nwere distributed randomly across neighbourhoods, and first\nuse of cocaine co-occurs from 1.3 to 1.9 times more often.\nOnce within neighbourhood concentration has been taken\ninto account, there is evidence of modest residual clustering\nof incident experience with cocaine within cities.\nFurthermore, there is some evidence that spatial correlation\nof first opportunity to use cocaine and first cocaine use\nincrease with neighbourhood poverty level. Neighbourhood\ncomposition with respect to age, race/ethnicity, sex, socio-\neconomic status, and residential mobility does not explain\nthe spatial correlation of incident experience with cocaine\nwithin neighbourhoods in general, or within poorer neigh-\nbourhoods in particular.\nOne possible explanation for geographical clustering of\ncocaine incidence within neighbourhoods is ``contagion'': a\ncontextual effect in which the probability that a person will\ndevelop a disease outcome is dependent upon the degree to\nwhich others in the community already have the outcome.7 40\nIn other words, the rate at which unaffected people become\naffected (that is, incidence) depends upon the prevalence rate\nof disease within a group.41 Despite its connotation, the\ncontagion effect can describe non-infectious diseases and the\nadoption of health behaviours within groups.7 42 For example,\ncurrent drug users might encourage use among non-users in\nthe community and thereby transmit the behaviour and\nincrease the incidence and prevalence rates.42 In other words,\nbeliefs and behaviours are transmitted from neighbour to\nneighbour.43 44 DeAlarcon reported how heroin use spread in\nsuch a fashion among residents of a London suburb in the\nto intervene in Chicago's heroin epidemic of the early 1970s.46\nAnother possible explanation for clustering of first cocaine\nexperience within neighbourhoods involves ``selection'' pro-\ncesses, selective in-migration and/or out-migration from\nneighbourhoods. This study adjusted for selection effects by\nincorporating a measure of residential mobility as a covariate.\nHowever, it is important to distinguish selection processes\nwhich produce poverty from the social processes by which\nFigure 3 First had opportunity to use cocaine during past five years:\nwithin neighbourhood clustering by neighbourhood poverty level.\nFigure 4 First used cocaine during past five years: within\nneighbourhood clustering by neighbourhood poverty level.\nwww.jech.com\nneighbourhood contexts produce spatially clustered out-\ncomes.47 Elsewhere, we found no evidence of differences in\ngeographical clustering of cocaine when it was estimated\nseparately by the residential mobility status of respondents.48\nLimitations\nA thorough interpretation of the estimates presented herein\nnecessitates a brief discussion of several limitations of the\ndata and methods used. The NHSDA data are self reported\nand their validity are affected by respondents' truthfulness\nand memory, and possibly by socially desirable responding\nwith respect to the behaviour in question.49 Although NHSDA\nprocedures encourage honesty and recall, the data are likely\nto contain some measurement error.\nThe use of NHSDA ``segments'' as a proxy for ``neighbour-\nhoods'' presents some conceptual difficulties. The ideal\nmeasurement of neighbourhoods would not rely solely on\ngeographical boundaries but would instead capture the social\ndimensions of neighbourhoods, such as cohesion and shared\ninstitutions and values, which have been called ``the ultimate\nmechanisms through which neighbourhood effects can be\ntransmitted.''47 The small size of NHSDA segments (max-\nimum of 1000 occupied housing units) makes them a less\nproblematic stand-in for neighbourhoods than such com-\nmonly used constructs as census tracts, but their small size is\nno guarantee that they somehow embody the interpersonal\nconnections one wishes to quantify when speaking of\n``neighbourhood effects.''44 The same conceptual problem\nexists when equating NHSDA primary sampling units with\n``cities.''\nFuture research\nOne facet of the utility of examining whether within\nneighbourhood clustering of first experience with cocaine (or\nother drug use or other inherently social health problems)\nvaries by neighbourhood context rests in its potential for\nidentifying types of neighbourhoods to target for preventive\nintervention. However, it is perhaps too broad a general-\nisation, or too simplistic, to suggest that preventive\ninterventions should be targeted to impoverished neigh-\nbourhoods. The cross sectional survey data examined here\ncannot speak to the underlying mechanisms that might\ngive rise to the observed spatial correlation of first\nexperience with cocaine within neighbourhoods. Future\nresearch should apply and evaluate strategies designed to\nuncover the social mechanisms that drive the geographical\nclustering of cocaine and other drug use, such as those\nproposed by Frohlich et al50 and Macintyre et al.51\nSeveral historical examples drawn from the 20th century\nexperience in the US suggest that the use of cocaine, or ``club\ndrugs'' such as MDMA (``ecstasy''), may occur more often in\nthe upper socioeconomic strata when they first gain\npopularity but then drift downward as the epidemic gains\nmomentum. Hence, the ``tipping point'' described by Crane52\nmight actually characterise the end stages of epidemics of\nsocial problems. It is possible that in the earlier stages of an\nepidemic the poverty gradient in clustering of first cocaine\nexperience might be inverted, such that clustering is highest\nin affluent neighbourhoods and lowest in impoverished\nneighbourhoods. This speculation cannot be investigated\nwith respect to the recent US cocaine epidemic because the\nrequisite data are not available. The early warning signs of a\ncocaine epidemic in Britain17\u00ad19 suggest a potential opportu-\nnity to examine the plausibility of this hypothesis.\nInclusion of more specific survey questions regarding\nexperience with cocaine and other drugs would be useful.\nFor example, survey questions that ask respondents whether\nthey shared or sold drugs to their neighbours could help\nevaluate the plausibility of the contagion interpretation of\ngeographical clustering of incident drug outcomes.\nFurthermore, the NHSDA asks when first experience with\ncocaine and other drugs occurred, but not where; knowing\nwhether it occurred at home, school, work, or outside the\nneighbourhood would be essential in any attempt to discern\nthe mechanisms driving geographical clustering.\nFinally, although we conducted a preliminary evaluation,48\nmore definitive research into the potential effect of incorpor-\nating sampling weights into the estimation of geographical\nclustering is necessary. Similarly, it is unknown whether\nsurvey designs that include geographically defined oversamples,\nestimates of spatial correlation.\nConclusions\nThe results of this study concur with recent theories of\nconcentrated disadvantage. William Julius Wilson demon-\nstrated that the social transformation of inner city neigh-\nincreasing concentration of poverty.53 This concentration of\nthe most disadvantaged segments of the population produces\nwhat he calls ``concentration effects'': ``the constraints and\nopportunities associated with living in a neighbourhood in\nwhich the population is overwhelmingly socially disadvan-\ntaged--constraints and opportunities that include the kinds\nKey points\nN The pairwise odds ratio (PWOR) can be used to\nquantify the extent to which a binary outcome clusters\ngeographically. The PWOR can be estimated by the\nstatistical method of alternating logistic regressions.\nN First opportunity to use cocaine and first use of cocaine\ncluster within US neighbourhoods to an extent that is\nnot explained by neighbourhood composition.\nN Once spatial correlation within neighbourhoods of\nthese two incident outcomes has been accounted for,\nthere is modest residual spatial correlation within US\ncities.\nN There is some evidence that the spatial correlation of\nthese outcomes within neighbourhoods increases with\nneighbourhood poverty level.\nPolicy implications\nN Geographical clustering of the earliest stages of\ninvolvement with cocaine suggests prevention efforts\nmight be more effective if they were geographically\ntargeted.\nN In the later stages of a cocaine epidemic, the effect of\nprevention efforts might be increased if they were\ntargeted to disadvantaged neighbourhoods.\nN Based on previous experience with cocaine and other\ndrugs, it is possible that in the earlier stages of an\nepidemic the poverty gradient in clustering of first\nexperience with a drug might be inverted, such that\nclustering is highest in affluent neighbourhoods and\nlowest in impoverished neighbourhoods.

He also describes the growth of the inner city illicit drug\nindustry as a concentration effect, which, in turn, can\nincrease rates of drug use in high poverty neighbourhoods.54\nWork inspired by Wilson suggests that both poverty and\naffluence are highly geographically concentrated in the\nUnited States.34 55 Furthermore, Massey discussed increasing\nrates of drug use as a potential ramification of the\nconcentration of affluence and poverty.55\nOne of the more intriguing findings in this study, which\nmight be added to the body of evidence on concentration\neffects, involves the interplay between the geographical\nclustering of first experience with cocaine and neighbour-\nhood disadvantage. Because the results encompass both first\nopportunity to use cocaine and first use of cocaine, one can be\nmore certain that the spatial correlation of first opportunity\nto use, one of the earliest points in the progression through\ndrug involvement, is engendered by concentrated disadvan-\ntage or associated conditions in the neighbourhood environ-\nment. It is not easy to imagine how clusters of opportunity to\ntry cocaine could cause neighbourhood residents to become\nmore impoverished in any direct manner. Rather, it seems\nmore likely that concentrated neighbourhood disadvantage\nitself, or characteristics associated with it such as a lack of\nsocial capital56 or collective efficacy,57 might give rise to\nconditions that favour the occurrence of a first experience\nwith cocaine.\n"
