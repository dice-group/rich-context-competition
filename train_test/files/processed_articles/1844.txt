We sought to assess whether a single underlying factor could\nrepresent the metabolic syndrome in adolescents.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- Using data from the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (1999\u00ad2002), we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis to\nassess the validity of waist circumference, triglycerides, fasting insulin, and systolic blood pres-\nsure (SBP) as potential phenotypic traits for the metabolic syndrome in adolescents aged 12\u00ad17\nyears (n  1,262). A multiple-group approach was used to test the invariance in factor loadings\nacross sex and race/ethnicity.\nRESULTS -- The estimates of factor loadings for the total sample were 0.76, 0.46, 0.81, and\n0.42 for waist circumference, triglycerides, fasting insulin, and SBP, respectively. The goodness-\nof-fit indexes were adequate for the total sample (comparative fit index, 0.99; standardized root\ndifferences in factor loadings of the four measured variables between boys and girls and among\nthe three racial or ethnic subgroups.\nCONCLUSIONS -- The metabolic syndrome as a single underlying factor for the four simple\nphenotypic traits may be plausible in adolescents. The proposed model appears to be general-\nizable across sex and race/ethnicity.\nMetabolic syndrome is a clustering\nof metabolic risk factors including\nabdominal obesity, dyslipidemia,\nglucose intolerance, and elevated blood\npressure, and it has become a health chal-\nlenge in children and adolescents (1). Us-\ning a modification of the definition\nproposed by the National Cholesterol Ed-\nucation Program Expert Panel on Detec-\ntion, Evaluation, and Treatment of High\nBlood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treat-\nment Panel III) (2), the prevalence of the\nmetabolic syndrome was 4% during\nthe U.S. The prevalence was 30%\namong U.S. overweight adolescents (4).\nAbout a dozen studies have used ex-\nploratory factor analysis to examine the\nrelationships of traditional and emerging\nrisk factors considering the potential phe-\nnotypic traits or components of the met-\nabolic syndrome in children and\nadolescents (5\u00ad15). The number of com-\nponents ranged from 5 to 26, and the\nnumber of factors identified ranged from\n1 to 7. The most frequently examined\nmeasurements included one or more an-\nthropometric measures, blood pressure,\nand concentrations of triglycerides, HDL\ncholesterol, and fasting insulin. No con-\nsensus on the type and number of com-\nponents for the metabolic syndrome has\nbeen reached thus far.\nConfirmatory factor analysis (CFA)\nhas been used to evaluate the models with\nfour factors (16\u00ad18), a second-order fac-\ntor (16), and one factor (19) in adults.\nUsing waist circumference or waist-to-hip\nratio, BMI, fasting insulin or insulin sen-\nsitivity, fasting glucose, triglycerides,\nHDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure\n(SBP), and diastolic blood pressure\n(DBP), the four-factor model appeared to\nbe supported among Europeans, African\nprovided insights in understanding the\ninterrelationships among the measured\nvariables. However, it did not directly ad-\ndress the nature of the metabolic syn-\ndrome as a single underlying factor. Using\nwaist circumference, triglycerides\u00adto\u00adHDL\ncholesterol ratio, homeostasis model as-\nsessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR),\nand mean arterial pressure (MAP), a sin-\ngle-factor model of the metabolic syn-\ndrome was identified in adults (19). This\nmodel greatly simplified the modeling\nprocess, yet calculating the three secondary\nvariables still required six direct measures.\nLack of a universally acceptable and\napplicable model for the metabolic syn-\ndrome in the pediatric population makes\nit difficult to define this syndrome and\ncompare its prevalence across studies and\ndiverse populations. Using clinically\navailable measures and a conceptually\nsimple model may be a practical way to\ndefine the metabolic syndrome and may\nspur physicians to diagnose the syndrome\namong their patients. Fasting insulin was\nhighly correlated with HOMA-IR (r \n                                                \nFrom the Division of Adult and Community Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and\nHealth Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Chaoyang Li, MD, PhD, Centers for Disease Control and\nThe findings and conclusions in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the\nviews of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nAbbreviations: CFA, confirmatory factor analysis; CFI, comparative-fit index; DBP, diastolic blood\npressure; HOMA-IR, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance; MAP, mean arterial pressure; SBP,\nsystolic blood pressure.\nA table elsewhere in this issue shows conventional and Syste\n`me International (SI) units and conversion\nfactors for many substances.\n\u00a9 2007 by the American Diabetes Association.\nThe costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.

Elevated triglycerides have been\nconsidered a key marker for atherogenic\ndyslipidemia (23). In addition, SBP was\nrelated to fasting insulin and body com-\nposition measures, whereas DBP was not\nor was weakly related to these measures in\nchildren and adolescents (24).\nThus, we proposed a new model us-\ning four simple and directly measured\nvariables--waist circumference, triglyc-\nerides, fasting insulin, and SBP--as the\npotential phenotypic traits of the meta-\nbolic syndrome in adolescents. The goals\nof this study were to examine the con-\nstruct validity and goodness of fit of the\none-factor model proposed in adolescents\nand to test the invariance in factor load-\nings across sex and race/ethnicity.\ntional Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey used a multistage, stratified sam-\npling design to represent the noninstitu-\ntionalized civilian U.S. population\n(25,26).

We\nlimited the analyses to boys and girls aged\nmedical examination, had fasted 8 h,\nand had complete data on all variables\nsians, non-Hispanic African Americans,\nand Mexican Americans were included in\nthe final analyses.\nSerum specimens were frozen at\n70\u00b0C, shipped on dry ice, and stored\nat 70\u00b0C until analysis. Plasma insulin\nconcentration was measured via a Phar-\nmacia insulin radioimmunoassay kit\n(Pharmacia Diagnostics, Uppsala, Swe-\nden). Plasma glucose concentration was\nmeasured by using an enzymatic reaction\n(Cobas Mira Chemistry System; Roche\nDiagnostic Systems, Montclair, NJ). De-\ntails on insulin assays can be found else-\ncalculated as [glucose (mmol/l)  insulin\ntration level was measured enzymatically\nin serum after being hydrolyzed to glyc-\nerol using a series of coupled reactions.\nHDL cholesterol level was directly mea-\nsured on a Hitachi 704 Analyzer after the\nprecipitation of other lipoproteins with a\nheparin-manganese chloride mixture.\nThe triglycerides\u00adto\u00adHDL cholesterol\nlevel was calculated using triglyceride\nconcentration divided by HDL choles-\nterol concentration.\nWaist circumference was measured\nby two trained health technicians using a\nsteel measuring tape to the nearest 0.1 cm\nat the high point of the iliac crest at min-\nimal respiration when the participant was\nin a standing position (29). Up to four SBP\nand DBP readings were obtained from\nparticipants. The average of the last two\nmeasurements of SBP and DBP for the\nparticipants who had three or four mea-\nsurements, the last measurement for the\nparticipants with only two measure-\nments, and the only measurement for the\nparticipants who had one measurement\nwere used to establish high blood pres-\nsure status. MAP was calculated as DBP \nStatistical analysis\nFasting insulin, HOMA-IR, triglycerides,\nand triglycerides\u00adto\u00adHDL cholesterol\nwere log transformed to approximate a\nnormal distribution. All variables were\nstandardized (mean  0 and SD  1) for\nage and sex. The four-factor model and\nthe one-factor CFA model in adults were\nspecified according to Shen et al. (16) and\nPladevall et al. (19). The one-factor model\nproposed in adolescents was specified as\nfollows: waist circumference, triglycer-\nides, fating insulin, and SBP may be influ-\nenced by an underlying factor, the\n\"metabolic syndrome,\" and a measure-\nment error. No correlated measurement\nerrors between any two measures were as-\nsumed. The factor loading () of each\nmeasured variable indicates the strength\nof its association with the underlying fac-\ntor. We used a cutoff value of 0.3 as the\nminimal level of a practically significant\nnificance level for two-tailed statistical tests.\nThe estimates of the parameters were\nobtained using the maximum likelihood\nmethod of the Mplus software (31). The\n2 test, comparative fit index (CFI), and\nstandardized root mean square residual\nwere used to assess the goodness of fit of\nthe hypothesized model to the data\n0.95 for CFI is recommended as an ac-\nceptable fit (32), and a cutoff value of\nroot mean square residual is recom-\nmended for a good fit (32).\nA multiple-group analysis was con-\nducted to test the invariance of factor\nloadings in the CFA model across sex and\nrace/ethnicity. The 2 difference test was\nused to determine whether the factor\nloadings between the two groups were\nstatistically significant.

The es-\ntimates of goodness of fit for the one-\nfactor CFA model proposed in adults by\nPladevall et al. (19) were adequate (Fig.\n1A). However, the factor loading for MAP\nwas low (  0.12), indicating a poor\nvalidity of this measure.\nThe estimates of goodness of fit for\nthe one-factor CFA model proposed in\nthe present study were adequate (Fig. 1B).\nThe overall estimates of factor loadings for\nand 0.42 for waist circumference, triglyc-\nerides, fasting insulin, and SBP, respec-\ntively.

The esti-\nmates of goodness-of-fit indexes were ex-\ncellent for Caucasian (Fig. 2A), African-\nAmerican (Fig. 2C), and Mexican-\nAmerican (Fig. 2E) boys and Mexican-\nAmerican girls (Fig. 2F); good for\nCaucasian girls (Fig. 2B); and acceptable\nfor African-American girls (Fig. 2D).\nAmong the four measures, fasting insulin\nhad the largest factor loading for the met-\nabolic syndrome in all sex- and race/\nethnicity-specific subgroups, except in\nAfrican-American girls.\nThe estimates of factor loadings of the\nfour measures for the metabolic syn-\ndrome were similar between boys and\nwas no statistical significance in the esti-\nmates of factor loadings between boys and\nLi and Ford\nsuggesting similarity in the construct va-\nlidity of the measured variables for the\nmetabolic syndrome across sex.

P  0.05; P \nThe metabolic syndrome in adolescents\nmeasures, waist circumference and fast-\ning insulin appeared to be the major com-\nponents in the syndrome. In particular,\nthe one-factor model seemed to be gener-\nalizable in various subpopulations be-\ncause no significant differences in the\nfactor structures of the model across sex\nand race/ethnicity were detected in our\nstudy.\nDespite an overall adequate fit for the\nmodel proposed by Pladevall et al. (19) in\nadults, MAP as a potential component for\nthe metabolic syndrome in adolescents\nmay be questionable because of its poor\nconstruct validity (  0.12). In fact,\nMAP, as a measure of average pressure\nthroughout the cardiac cycle, has been\nstudied less in relation to insulin resis-\ntance or obesity among both children and\nadults. In contrast, SBP was positively as-\nsociated with insulin resistance, whereas\nDBP was not or was weakly associated\nwith insulin resistance (24). Thus, the use\nof SBP as a potential component for the\nmetabolic syndrome seemed to be more\ntenable than either MAP or a combination\nof SBP and DBP in adolescents.\nThere are several advantages of using\nfasting insulin as a potential component\nfor the metabolic syndrome. At the sim-\nplest level, it is as good a surrogate esti-\nvarious combinations of fasting insulin\nand glucose concentration such as\nHOMA-IR (28). Of greater clinical rele-\nvance may be the pathophysiological role\nthat hyperinsulinemia plays in the devel-\nopment of the clinical abnormalities that\noccur more frequently in individuals who\nare insulin resistant. Finally, the construct\nvalidity of fasting insulin was similar to\nthat of HOMA-IR, yet much greater than\nthat of fasting glucose in the definition of\nthe metabolic syndrome.\nThe use of triglycerides in lieu of a\ntriglycerides\u00adto\u00adHDL ratio or HDL cho-\nlesterol as a possible component of the\nmetabolic syndrome in adolescents may\nhave the following advantages: 1) triglyc-\nerides correlated more closely to triglyc-\nerides\u00adto\u00adHDL cholesterol ratio than\nHDL cholesterol; 2) the model using trig-\nlycerides was less variant in factor struc-\ntures than that using HDL cholesterol\nacross sex and race/ethnicity; 3) elevated\ntriglyceride concentrations have been\nconsidered a key marker for atherogenic\ndyslipidemia or the lipid triad, i.e., raised\ntriglyceride levels, small LDL particles,\nand low HDL cholesterol (23); and 4) low\nHDL cholesterol was a component of the\nmetabolic syndrome only in the presence\nof hypertriglyceridemia in patients with\ntype 2 diabetes (33). Therefore, triglycer-\nides appeared to be a preferable measure\nof dyslipidemia in the definition of the\nmetabolic syndrome in adolescents.\nInsulin resistance and abdominal\nobesity have been proposed as major un-\nderlying causes for the metabolic syn-\nrelative importance of insulin resistance\nand abdominal obesity in the metabolic\nsyndrome is difficult and scarce in litera-\nture. A previous study (15) showed that\nobesity might be a stronger component of\nthe metabolic syndrome in adolescents\nthan hyperinsulinemia. Our results, how-\never, that fasting insulin and waist cir-\ncumference were approximately equally\nassociated with the metabolic syndrome,\nsuggest that both insulin resistance and\nabdominal obesity may be the key fea-\ntures of the syndrome.\nOur results provide a conceptual\nframework of the metabolic syndrome in\nadolescents. To be useful in clinical prac-\ntice, research, and surveillance, findings\nfrom factor analyses have to be translated\ninto a practical definition of the metabolic\nFigure 2--Factor loadings and goodness-of-fit indexes of one-factor CFA model for metabolic\nsyndrome by sex and race/ethnicity among U.S. adolescents aged 12\u00ad17 years, National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (1999\u00ad2002). Measurement errors were not specified to be\ncorrelated in the CFA model. For clarity of demonstration, the error terms of the CFA model were\ncircumference.\nLi and Ford\nsyndrome. One approach would be to\nemulate the definitions of the metabolic\nsyndrome among adults, such as the ones\ndeveloped by the National Cholesterol\nEducation Program and the World Health\nOrganization, and use threshold values\nfor the components specific to children\nand adolescents, as recommended in\nguidelines for waist circumference\nfor triglycerides would need to be adapted\nto children and adolescents (2). The\nthreshold value of 20 mU/l for fasting\nplasma insulin concentration proposed\nby the American Heart Association may\nbe potentially useful for the clinical as-\nsessment of insulin resistance in pediatric\npopulation (39). Another approach\nwould be to develop a risk score for the\nmetabolic syndrome based on multivari-\nate modeling or on summing z-scores for\nthe components. Because such a risk\nscore is a continuous measure, one or\nmore cut points could be established,\nleading to a classification such as having\nor not having the metabolic syndrome or\nsuch as low, medium, or high risk for the\nmetabolic syndrome.\nIn conclusion, our findings have im-\nplications in clinical practice, epidemio-\nlogic research, and public health\nsurveillance. The one-factor model uses\nvalid, simple, and easily available mea-\nsures to define the metabolic syndrome;\nthus, it may facilitate the diagnosis of the\nsyndrome in clinical settings and the de-\nvelopment of a case definition for use in\nsurveillance. In addition, the model ap-\npeared to be consistent across sex and ra-\ncial/ethnic subgroups and therefore could\nbe generalized to diverse populations. It\nmight be of particular interest to use valid\nand universally applicable measures to\ndefine the metabolic syndrome in the pe-\ndiatric population, given the lack of a\nstandard pediatric definition of the syn-\ndrome to date.\nReferences\n1.
