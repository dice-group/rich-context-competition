    "abstract": "Abstract\nInformal caregiving for dementia is common and often affects caregiver mental health. In addition to typical stressors faced\nby caregivers of persons with dementia (PWDs), rural caregivers often face additional stressors associated with living in\nmore remote locations; unfortunately, this group is largely understudied. Ninety-three caregiver\u00adPWD dyads completed\nmeasures of social support, perceived control, self-efficacy, burden, and cognitive functioning. Measures of PWD activities of\ndaily living and mental functioning were also collected. These variables were hypothesized to predict caregiver self-reported\nsymptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Contrary to predictions, only caregiving-related self-efficacy and caregiver\nburden predicted the caregiver's mental health. Future interventions for improving rural caregiver self-reported mental\nhealth should target cognitions associated with caregiving self-efficacy and caregiver burden. Health care providers for rural\nfamilies should focus on ways to reduce feelings of caregiver burden and provide caregivers with useful skills and tools for\ncaregiving.\n",

Despite available formal caregiving\noptions, many family members of people with dementia take\nmillion family caregivers spent more than 30 billion hr car-\ning for a family member with any condition, which could be\nroughly translated to more than US$300 billion market value\n(National Family CaregiversAssociation & Family Caregiver\nAlliance, 2006). Notably, 75% of care provided for individu-\nals with Alzheimer's disease alone is done so by informal\ncaregivers (Schulz & Martire, 2004). In the present study, we\nfocus on these informal caregivers of persons with dementia\n(PWDs), defined as caring for a family member or friend in\nan informal capacity (as opposed to a professional or paid\ncapacity). Given the large number of informal caregivers, it\nis important to understand the associated mental health\neffects of caregiving.\nThere is a large amount of literature speaking to the physi-\ncal and mental health effects of caregiving for family mem-\nbers with dementia. Evidence consistently shows that this\nrole is associated with negative physical and mental health.\nSpecifically, caregiving for individuals with dementia or\nAlzheimer's disease is associated with anticipatory grief\n(Garand et al., 2012), clinical depression and anxiety (Schulz,\nO'Brien, Bookwala, & Fleissner, 1995), depressive disorders\nand symptoms (Kiecolt-Glaser, Dura, Speicher, Trask, &\nGlaser, 1991), and changes in processing speed (Caswell\net al., 2003). Dementia caregiving is also associated with\ndecreased immunity and more days sick with infectious dis-\neases (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 1991) and decreased health\nbehaviors (e.g., less sleep; Connell, Janevic, & Gallant,\n2001). Moreover, caregiving for individuals with dementia\n(vs. no dementia) is associated with increased physical and\nmental health difficulties, familial conflict, and caregiver\nstrain (Ory, Hoffman, Yee, Tennstedt, & Schulz, 1999).\nDespite the abundance of research on caregivers of PWDs,\nrelatively little attention has been paid to caregivers in rural\nsettings. In addition to the mental and physical effects, rural\ncaregivers face additional challenges in caring for an indi-\nvidual with dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Notably, rural\ncaregivers indicate that their family member faces unmet ser-\nvice needs (Li, Kyrouac, McManus, Cranston, & Hughes,\n2012) and limited availability and accessibility of services\n(O'Reilly & Strong, 1997b). In addition, they face potential\n1University of Virginia, Charlottesville, USA\n2University of California, Los Angeles, USA\n3Alzheimer's Association, Central and Western Virginia Chapter,\nCharlottesville, USA\n4Department of Gerontology, Virginia Commonwealth University\nCorresponding Author:\nAlexandra J.

In one report, researchers note that rural care-\ngivers provide almost 50 hr of care a week (Kosberg,\nKaufman, Burgio, Leeper, & Sun, 2007). Interestingly, gen-\nder differences appear in comparisons of urban and rural\ncaregivers; male caregivers in rural environments exhibit\npoorer mental health as compared with their urban-dwelling\ncounterparts; however, no differences emerge between\nfemale caregivers in the two locations (Tommis et al., 2007).\nHome care staff note that rural caregivers may be reluctant to\nuse services in the area and may not request help until a crisis\nsituation emerges (Morgan et al., 2002). Despite the draw-\nbacks of being a caregiver of a PWD in a rural setting, rural\ncaregivers do express somewhat high levels of social support\n(Kaufman, Kosberg, Leeper, & Tang, 2010). Social support\nin rural areas, despite its potential negative consequences\n(e.g., community members misunderstanding the dementia\ncondition and criticizing the caregiver's care decisions), does\nprovide benefits, such as access to informal networks and\nless social isolation (O'Reilly & Strong, 1997a).\nMuch of the research on caregivers in rural settings is quali-\ntative, which is a necessary first step to understanding the prob-\nlems faced by this population. However, more work is necessary\nto more fully understand the relationship among demographic\nvariables, reported caregiver burden and social support, patient's\ndementia, and caregiver mental health, as previous research\nsuggests that rural and urban caregiving is qualitatively differ-\nent. In the present descriptive study, we will examine predictors\nof caregiver mental health (self-reported anxiety, stress, and\ndepression) in a sample of rural dementia caregivers. This next\nstep affords service providers more information about potential\npoints of intervention for this group of individuals.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first examination of mental\nhealth predictors in rural dementia caregivers. In the pres-\nent study, cognitive functioning, social support, caregiver\nburden, perceived control over one's life, self-efficacy in\ncaregiving, and demographic variables (i.e., age and gen-\nder), in addition to the care-recipient's level of dementia\nand ability to complete activities of daily living (ADLs),\nwill be explored as possible predictors of self-reported\ncaregiver mental health.\nResearch supports the hypothesis that many of these factors\nwill predict dementia caregivers' mental health symptoms.\nGreater social support is related to lower levels of depression\n(Lopez, Romero-Moreno, M\u00e1rquez-Gonz\u00e1lez, & Losada, 2012;\nWilliams, 2005), and a caregiver's burden is negatively related\nto his or her mental health (Garand, Dew, Eazor, DeKosky, &\nvariables are also related to caregiver mental health, including\nDonner, & Keane-Hagerty, 1998) and gender (Covinsky et al.,\nMoreover, across elderly caregiving studies (i.e., not restricted\nto dementia caregiving), spouses report greater depressive\nsymptoms than do caregiving children (Pinquart & S\u00f6rensen,\n2011). The PWD's ability to perform ADLs also predicts care-\ngiver anxiety (Mahoney et al., 2005), as well as the PWD's level\nof dementia (Sparks et al., 1998). Self-efficacy, an individual's\nbelief that he or she has control over the events in his or her life,\nis related to how much stress one believes he or she can handle\nand has to do with how he or she encounters challenges\n(Bandura, 2000). Conceptually similar, caregiver self-efficacy\nis a caregiver's self-report of his or her ability to engage indi-\nviduals with dementia in meaningful activities, respond to the\nindividual's needs, and deal with caregiving difficulties.\nIncreased caregiving self-efficacy is associated with lower lev-\nels of depression (Gilliam & Steffen, 2006) and mediates the\nrelationship between care-recipient behavioral problems and\ncaregiver depression (Sherwood et al., 2007).Agreater sense of\ncaregiving-specific self-efficacy may also be related to lower\nlevels of depression, anxiety, and anger (Steffen, McKibbin,\nZeiss, Gallagher-Thompson, & Bandura, 2002). Although the\ncited research is by no means exhaustive, it does support the\nhypothesis that there is a relationship between a caregiver's\nsocial support, burden, self-efficacy, and demographic charac-\nteristics and his or her mental health. However, previous\nresearch has largely neglected caregivers in rural settings.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first exploration of whether\nprocessing speed predicts mental health in caregivers.\nAlthough previous research suggests that individuals'\nchronic stressors (such as chronic health conditions) predict\nchanges in cognition (for review, see Marin et al., 2011)\nand that caregiving status predicts cognitive functioning\n(although this effect disappears when distress is entered\ninto the regression; Caswell et al., 2003), we will include\ncaregiver processing speed as a predictor of mental health.\nHypotheses\nBetter rural caregiver mental health (fewer self-reported\nsymptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety) will be predicted\nby greater levels of caregiver social support, perceived con-\ntrol, and self-efficacy; lower levels of caregiver burden; and\nbetter cognitive functioning. Moreover, demographic vari-\nables, such as being female and younger age, will be related to\nbetter caregiver mental health. Finally, lower levels of demen-\ntia and greater ability to performADLs in/by the care-recipient\nwill be associated with better caregiver mental health.\nParticipants\nIndividuals interested in receiving an intervention for care-\ngiver burden responded to local media advertisements or\nlearned about the intervention from community resources\n(e.g., local Alzheimer's Association chapter). Each of the 93\nparticipating families consisted of one primary caregiver\n(defined by the participating family) and one PWD (this is\nWerntz et al. 3\nloosely defined, as not all PWDs had received a formal diag-\nnosis). Seventy-five percent of the families reported receiv-\ning a diagnosis of dementia (see Table 1 for the dementia\nbreakdown). Families lived in rural areas of central Virginia.\nMeasures\nMeasures completed by the caregiver\nDemographic questionnaire.In addition to typical demo-\ngraphic information, the questionnaire included items\nregarding the relationship between the caregiver and PWD,\nthe number of years the caregiver has been caregiving for\nthis family member, and whether or not there is a profes-\nsional caregiver present, as well. Five families did not report\ndemographic information (see Table 1 for participant char-\nacteristics).\nDepressionAnxietyandStressScale\u00ad21-itemversion(DASS-21).\nThis measure assesses self-reported depression, anxiety,\nand stress symptoms over the past 7 days.

Note that this questionnaire measures the phys-\niological symptoms of anxiety (e.g., \"I felt I was close to\npanic\"), symptoms of stress (e.g., \"I tended to overreact to\nsituations\"), and depressive symptoms (e.g., \"I felt that I had\nnothing to look forward to\"). Psychometric properties for the\nadults seeking treatment for worry in a primary health care\nsetting suggest adequate internal consistency and correlates\nwith widely used measures for similar constructs (Gloster\net al., 2008). In the current sample, the full scale exhibits\nhigh internal consistency, Cronbach's  = .93.\nMultidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support.This\n12-item questionnaire (Zimet, Dahlem, Zimet, & Farley,\n1988) contains questions regarding the participant's per-\nceived social support from three domains: significant other,\nfamily, and friends. Individuals rate the degree to which they\nagree or disagree with statements about how supported he\nor she feels by others. Scores range from 1 to 7 (mean of\nitem responses); higher scores reflect greater social support\nin each of the domains. Cronbach's  = .93 in the current\nsample.\nZarit Burden Index\u00ad22-item version (ZBI).This 22-item\n(Zarit, Reever, & Bach-Peterson, 1980) questionnaire con-\ntains questions regarding a caregiver's feeling of burden\nrelated to caregiving. Scores range from 0 to 88 (sum of item\nresponses). Higher scores reflect greater feelings of burden;\nlittle or no burden is reflected by scores of 0 to 21, mild to\nmoderate burden by scores of 21 to 40, moderate to severe\nburden by scores of 41 to 60, and severe burden by scores of\nPerceived control.This 12-item (Lachman & Weaver,\n1998) questionnaire consists of questions regarding an indi-\nvidual's sense of perceived control over his or her life. Per-\nsonal Mastery (e.g., \"I can do just about anything I really set\nmy mind to\") and Perceived Constraint (e.g., \"I often feel\nhelpless in dealing with the problems of life\") subscales are\nused to create a perceived control score with higher scores\nreflecting a greater sense of perceived control overall and a\nhigher standing in each subscale. Possible scores range from\n1 to 7 (mean of item responses). In the current sample, Cron-\nCaregiver Self-Efficacy Tool\u00ad20-item version.This 20-item\nquestionnaire (Braddock, 2008; modified for the current study)\nconsists of questions from the original 34-item questionnaire.\nThis assesses the caregiver's efficacy and self-efficacy in how\nhe or she is able to work with the PWD on activities provided\nby the intervention (e.g., \"At this time, I am confident that\nI am able to understand my family member's interests and\nhobbies\"). Scores can range from 20 to 100 (sum of item\nresponses); higher scores reflect self-efficacy with respect to\ncaregiving in the caregiver. Cronbach's  = .94 in the current\nsample.\nDigit Symbol-Coding subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence\nScale\u00adIII (WAIS-III).2\nThe Digit Symbol-Coding subtest\n(Wechsler, 1997) measures cognitive processing speed by\nasking participants to copy symbols of corresponding num-\nbers into boxes as quickly as possible in 2 min. Possible\nscores can range from 0 to 133 (sum of correct symbols).\nAlzheimer'sDiseaseCooperativeStudy(ADCS)--ADLInventory\u00ad\nSevere Impairment Version (ADCS-ADL-SIV).This 19-item\ninterview (Galasko et al., 1997) includes questions for the\ncaregiver of the PWD concerning the PWD's abilities to\nperform ADLs over the past 4 weeks. Caregivers are asked\nto describe the actions of the PWD observed in domains\nsuch as eating functions, personal care functions, and his\nor her ability to use items around the home. Using a struc-\ntured interview, scores of 0 to 54 (sum of item responses)\nwere obtained with higher scores reflecting greater ability to\nperform ADLs. This interview has adequate test\u00adretest reli-\nability (with a significant correlation of .93 from baseline\nto 1-month follow-up; Galasko et al., 2005).

Scores on the MMSE\nwith higher scores reflecting greater cognitive functioning.\nAlthough both age and education can affect mean scores on\nthe MMSE (Crum, Anthony, Bassett, & Folstein, 1993), in\nthe present intervention, a score of 30 reflects no dementia,\nscores 26 to 29 reflect questionable dementia, scores of 21 to\n25 reflect mild dementia, scores of 11 to 20 reflect moderate\ndementia, and scores of 0 to 10 reflect severe dementia (Per-\nguidelines, both the serial sevens question (subtracting seven\nfrom 100 and so on) and spelling WORLD backward were\nadministered, and the set that yielded the higher score was\nused for scoring.\nProcedure\nConsent procedure.To ensure that all individuals compre-\nhended the purpose of the intervention research study, as the\nfirst step in the consent procedure, the researcher (a) informed\nthe caregiver and PWD of the goals of the study, (b) assessed\nwhether or not the PWD understood the purpose and goals of\nWerntz et al. 5\nthe study, and (c) determined which consent forms were nec-\nessary for each family. If the PWD comprehended the pur-\npose and goals, the researcher administered an informed\nassent agreement to the PWD and a \"guardian informed con-\nsent\" agreement to the caregiver so that he or she could sign\nfor the PWD. The caregiver was asked to sign a caregiver\ninformed consent agreement. It should be noted that some of\nthe PWDs were unable to sign the assent form. In this case of\nlast resort, the PWD could provide oral assent to participate,\nand both the caregiver and the home visitor would sign and\ndate the assent form. The home visitor was also asked to pro-\nvide a detailed rationale for not obtaining written assent.\nQuestionnaire administration.\nAll families participated in\ntheir homes; both the PWD and caregiver were present. Fol-\nlowing informed consent, caregivers completed the demo-\ngraphic, DASS-21, social support, ZBI, perceived control,\nand caregiver self-efficacy questionnaires independently.\nResearchers administered the digit symbol questionnaire,\nADL, and MMSE according to established measure guide-\nlines. Note that during oral administration (ADL and\nMMSE), the caregiver and PWD were separated when pos-\nsible to ensure measurement validity (i.e., so one would not\noverhear the other's answers).\nResults\nAnalytic Plan\nTo assess the predictors of caregiver mental health (as\nassessed by the DASS-21), a hierarchical linear regression\nwas conducted. Prior to running the regression analysis,\nassumptions were checked. Notably, caregiver age and care-\ngiver mental health were not normally distributed; these\nvariables were transformed using a square root transforma-\ntion and were normally distributed following the transforma-\ntion. All other assumptions (multivariate normality, linearity,\nnormally distributed errors) were checked and met (see Table\n2 for descriptive information for the measures before\ntransformation).\nPredicting Caregiver Mental Health\nTo assess how well caregiver social support, perceived control,\ncaregiving self-efficacy, caregiver burden, and PWD's cogni-\ntive functioning (on the MMSE) and ADL predict caregiver\nmental health, when controlling for the caregiver's age and\ngender, a hierarchical linear regression was computed. When\nage and gender were entered, they did not significantly predict\nHowever, when caregiver social support, perceived control,\ncaregiving self-efficacy, caregiver burden, and PWD's cogni-\ntive functioning and ADL were entered into the model, they\nTogether, these variables accounted for 56.3% of the variance\nin caregiver mental health.\nContrary to predictions, only caregiver self-efficacy,  =\npredict the caregiver's mental health.\nTaken together, the results suggest that greater caregiver\nself-efficacy in caregiving ability is related to better (i.e.,\nlower scores) caregiver mental health. Moreover, better care-\ngiver mental health is related to less caregiver burden.\nSurprisingly, caregiver age, gender, social support, perceived\ncontrol, and the PWD's cognitive functioning and ADL did\nnot significantly predict the caregiver's mental health.\nTable 2. Descriptive Information for Measures.\nMeasure M SD Range N\nNote. SIV = Severe Impairment Version; PWD = persons with dementia.\n6 SAGE Open\nFollow-up analyses. Following the results of the multiple lin-\near regression, exploratory correlational analyses were con-\nducted to examine the relationship among caregiver\nself-efficacy, caregiver burden, and mental health domains\n(see Table 3 for correlation coefficients). Results suggest that\ncaregiver self-efficacy is negatively correlated with care-\ngiver depression, anxiety, and stress, such that as the care-\ngiver's self-efficacy in caregiving increases, depression,\nanxiety, and stress decrease. Moreover, caregiver burden is\npositively correlated with caregiver depression, anxiety, and\nstress, such that increasing feelings of burden are associated\nwith greater reported depression, anxiety, and stress symp-\ntoms. Overall, caregiver burden is more strongly correlated\nwith mental health variables than caregiver self-efficacy.\nIn addition, a post hoc power analysis was conducted\nusing G*Power software (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner,\nat .95 ( = .05) for a two-tailed t test, and medium effect size,\nfor eight predictors in a multiple linear regression.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first assessment of multiple\npredictors on the mental health of caregivers of PWDs in a\nrural setting. Contrary to predictions, caregiver age, gender,\nsocial support, perceived control, and the PWD's cognitive\nfunctioning and ADL did not significantly predict the care-\ngiver's current mental health (as assessed on a self-report\ndepression, anxiety, and stress symptom measure). Consistent\nwith predictions, however, caregiver self-efficacy and bur-\nden did predict caregiver mental health. Exploratory analy-\nses revealed medium-sized correlations between caregiver\nself-efficacy and depression, anxiety, and stress. Moderately\nlarge correlations emerged between caregiver burden and the\ncomponents of mental health. Taken together, these results\nsuggest the importance of rural caregiver's experienced bur-\nden and feelings of self-efficacy while caregiving for a loved\none with dementia.\nThe present study failed to support previous dementia\ncaregiving findings with regard to the relationships between\nmental health and social support (Lopez et al., 2012;\nMahoney et al., 2005), and relationship (Pinquart & S\u00f6rensen,\n2011). Previous research has also found support for a rela-\ntionship between caregiver mental health and the PWD's\nreported ADL (Mahoney et al., 2005) and level of dementia\n(Sparks et al., 1998). In the present sample of rural caregiv-\ners, these factors do not appear to play a significant role in\npredicting their overall mental health when caregiving.\nPrior work--replicated in the present study--has found\nthat the burden of caregivers of Alzheimer's disease patients\n(Garc\u00eda-Alberca et al., 2012) and individuals with mild cog-\nnitive impairment (Garand et al., 2005) is related to caregiver\nmental health. This suggests that the relationship between\nmental health and burden is fairly robust, even across mild\nand more severe forms of dementia caregiving. Caregiver\nquality of life is also strongly tied to reported levels of care-\ngiver burden (Heggie et al., 2011). Burden has also been\nfound to mediate the relationship between a patient's disturb-\ning behavior and a lack of caregiver social support on depres-\nsion in dementia caregivers (Clyburn, Stones,\nHadjistavropoulos, & Tuokko, 2000). These relatively robust\nfindings across studies make it clear that caregiver burden is\none area that could be targeted by interventions to greatly\nimprove caregiver's mental health. Caregiver self-efficacy\nwas also found to predict mental health in our rural dementia\ncaregivers. This result also is in line with prior work in this\narea; self-efficacy is associated with lower levels of depres-\nsion (Gilliam & Steffen, 2006; Romero-Moreno, M\u00e1rquez-\nGonz\u00e1lez, Mausbach, & Losada, 2012) and mediates the\nrelationship between patient behavioral problems and care-\ngiver depression (Sherwood et al., 2007). Importantly,\nresearchers have found that the combination of self-efficacy\nand spirituality in caregivers is associated with better mental\nIndividuals with greater self-efficacy are hypothesized to\nbe able to take on challenges, rather than avoid them, and are\nless vulnerable to anxiety and depression (Bandura, 2000).\nTo measure caregiving self-efficacy in the current study,\ncaregivers were asked about their confidence in engaging the\nPWD in activities around the home, coping with added\nresponsibilities around the home as a caregiver, and effec-\ntively responding to the frustration associated with caregiv-\ning. Caregivers' greater feelings of caregiving self-efficacy\nwere associated with better mental health (i.e., fewer self-\nreported symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress). It is\nperhaps the case that self-efficacy provides a certain resil-\niency in caregivers of individuals with dementia. What is\nsurprising, however, is that perceived control (a concept very\nsimilar to self-efficacy) did not significantly predict care-\ngiver mental health. The caregivers may not have understood\nTable 3. Correlations Among Mental Health Variables, Caregiver Burden, and Caregiver Self-Efficacy.\nDASS-21 Depression subscale DASS-21 Anxiety subscale DASS-21 Stress subscale\nNote. DASS = Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale.\nWerntz et al. 7\nthis measure, as it was the measure most commonly left\nincomplete in the packets. Thus, the questions may not have\nbeen a valid measure of perceived control in this sample.\nWhat is likely, though, is that there is something unique\nabout self-efficacy specific to caregiving skills--and not\nmore general feelings of control in one's life--that is related\nto mental health in this sample of rural caregivers.\nLimitations\nThere were a number of limitations in the current study that\nshould be noted. First, participating families all responded to\nlocal advertisements for a caregiver intervention by a local\nAlzheimer's disease group. All families had to be willing to\nallow researchers to come into the home across a few months\nto administer measures and interact with the caregiver and\nPWD. Thus, the present sample may not be representative of\nevery rural family with an individual with dementia. Second,\nreligion and spirituality were not assessed in the current\nstudy; thus, a potentially important aspect of coping or sup-\nport was not included in our model. Caregivers of PWDs\nhave reported that religious coping is helpful when coping\nwith caregiving (Stolley, Buckwalter, & Koenig, 1999).\nResearch on religious coping in rural caregivers has primar-\nily focused on ethnic and racial differences. Results suggest\nthat African Americans endorse greater religious coping than\nCaucasian individuals (from cities: Haley et al., 2004; and\nrural areas: Kosberg et al., 2007). Despite our sample being\nlargely Caucasian, religion and religious coping may play a\nrole in caregiver's understanding of the caregiving role, and\nthus may have affected the present results.\nImportantly, results from the present analyses should be\ninterpreted in light of the fact that the self-efficacy measure\nhas yet to be rigorously tested or validated. Although previ-\nous work has utilized the longer form of the measure\n(Braddock, 2008), the measure was shortened for the present\nstudy and has not been validated in either form. Despite this,\nthe measure demonstrated excellent internal consistency in\nthe present sample and was found to significantly predict\ncaregiver mental health. In addition, participating caregivers\nseem to have found the measure approachable, as they all\ncompleted it. However, future work must test the reliability\nand validity of the measure, especially in larger samples.\nFuture Directions and Conclusions\nThe present study was the first to our knowledge to examine\ncaregiver age, gender, perceived social support, perceived\ncontrol, burden, caregiver self-efficacy, and the PWD's cog-\nnitive functioning and ADL as predictors of rural caregivers'\nmental health. Contrary to predictions, only caregiver burden\nand caregiver-related self-efficacy were significant predic-\ntors of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress.\nImportantly, these two predictors accounted for more than\nhalf of the variance in caregiver mental health, suggesting\nthe relative importance of these two components on mental\nhealth. Future research should investigate interventions tar-\ngeting caregiver-specific burden and self-efficacy, seeking to\nreduce the perceived burden by rural caregivers and increase\nthe relative control that caregivers have over their situation.\nSpecifically, interventions could teach caregivers how to\ncope with increased responsibilities around the home, deal-\ning with difficult PWD behavior, and how to effectively\nengage the PWD in meaningful activities around the home.\nGiven the results of the present study, interventions that suc-\ncessfully target these areas may reduce mental health prob-\nlems in rural caregivers, who deal with unique issues when it\ncomes to caregiving.\nIn addition to the difficulty of caregiving for an individual\nwith dementia or Alzheimer's disease, rural caregivers must\neffectively cope with the added stressors of rural caregiving.\nLargely forgotten by targeted interventions, rural caregivers\nface the added challenges of lack of privacy and increased\nstigma in small communities (Morgan et al., 2002) and lim-\nited availabilities of services (O'Reilly & Strong, 1997b).\nThe present findings are somewhat positive in that two fac-\ntors that can be targeted by interventions, namely, caregiver\nburden and self-efficacy, were shown to be predictive of\ncaregiver mental health. Many variables that would be\nimpossible to target in interventions, such as caregiver age\nand gender, did not significantly predict mental health.\nMoreover, it may be possible to target burden and self-effi-\ncacy via telephone or Internet, which would overcome some\nof the difficulties associated with rural caregiving.\nInformal rural caregivers, often with little or no choice\ndue to limited resources, have made a difficult decision to\ncare for a loved one with dementia or Alzheimer's disease.\nMoreover, these individuals have the added difficulties asso-\nciated with caregiving in rural areas. In the present study,\nreduced caregiver burden and increased caregiving-related\nself-efficacy are related to decreased caregiver mental health\n(i.e., self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and\nstress). These results are promising in that they provide a\npotential next step in creating targeted interventions for\nreducing caregiver mental health issues.\n"
