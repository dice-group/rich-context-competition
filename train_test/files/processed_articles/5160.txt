We used the Rasch rating scale model\nto investigate the psychometric performance of the MMSS-25. We identified possible item bias among MMSS-25 items.\nWe conducted confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) to compare the fit to our data of five factor structures reported in the\nliterature. We concluded that irrespective of administration in English or Arabic, the MMSS-25 is not sufficiently productive\nof measurement for use in the region. A core set of 13 items (MMSS-13, Cronbach's  = .82) loading on five dimensions\neliminates redundant MMSS items and is suitable for initial screening of nurses' satisfaction. Of the five factor structures\nwe examined, the MMSS-13 was the only close fit to our data (comparative fit index = 0.951; Tucker\u00adLewis index = 0.931;\nroot mean square error of approximation = 0.051; p value = .401). The MMSS-13 has psychometric characteristics superior\nto MMSS-25, but additional items are required to meet the research-specific objectives of future studies of nurses' job\nsatisfaction in Middle Eastern countries.\n",

For each\narchy of needs and insights of Burns (1969), staff nurses\nwere asked to indicate which rewards, if available, would\nhave influenced them to remain in the job they left in the\nprevious 4 months. Mueller and McCloskey (1990) con-\nducted exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on 33 of the 36\nitems and retained the 31 items that have since constituted\nMueller and McCloskey (1990) recommended that inves-\ntigators use the MMSS-31 as a general measure of nurse sat-\nisfaction when they have no interest in determining how nurse\nsatisfaction is influenced by particular job or work setting\ncharacteristics. When a finer grained understanding of nurse\njob satisfaction is required, Cronbach's alpha values .7 sug-\ngest that four of the eight sub-dimensions identified by\nMueller and McCloskey are sufficiently internally consistent\nto achieve productive measurement (scheduling satisfaction,\nsix items, Cronbach's =\n.84; interaction, three items,\nCronbach's =.72;praise/recognition,fouritems,Cronbach's\n = .80; control/responsibility, five items, Cronbach's  =\n.80).

Six items included in Mueller and McCloskey's (1990) 31-item scale were omitted from the El-Jardali, Murray et al.

The six MMSS-31 items\nexcluded (Table 1, footnote) were omitted because they were\nirrelevant to nurses working in underserved areas. Nurses\nused four Likert-type rating scale categories to respond to the\nMMSS-25. The MMSS-25 was administered in Arabic. The\nstudy was part of a wider investigation of nurses' intentions\nto stay in underserved areas of Yemen, Jordan, Lebanon, and\nQatar (El-Jardali, Murray, et al., 2013). In Qatar, the MMSS-\n25 was administered in English. The MMSS-25 data col-\nlected in Lebanon and Qatar provided the data set for our\nmethodological study.\nOur review of studies of nurse satisfaction conducted in\nthe Middle East demonstrates that researchers have used dif-\nferent sets of MMSS-31 items, different rating categories,\ndifferent languages, and different populations to investigate\nnurses' job satisfaction in the region, and that the measure-\nment characteristics of the resulting scales have not been suf-\nficiently examined. Consequently, investigators intending to\nconduct future studies of nurses' job satisfaction in Middle\nEastern countries need guidance on the following important\nmethodological questions:\n1. How many rating scale categories should be used\nwhen conducting studies with MMSS items in Middle\nEastern countries?\n2. Which MMSS items are most productive of measure-\nment when used in the region?\n3. Are MMSS items biased when administered to\nArabic speaking local nurses or in English to interna-\ntionally educated nurses in the region?\n4. Irrespective of language of administration (Arabic or\nEnglish) are responses to MMSS items biased by the\nincome level of the country of employment?\n5. Within the limitations of the number of MMSS items\nused in studies of nurse satisfaction in Middle Eastern\ncountries, which reported factor structure for the\nMMSS is most plausible?\n6. What do answers to the first five questions suggest\nfor investigators planning to use MMSS items for\nfuture studies of nurse job satisfaction in Middle\nEastern countries?\nThe purpose of our article is to contribute to answering\nthese questions.\nMethod\nOurs is a methodological study that used the Rasch rating\nscale model (Andrich, 1978) and confirmatory factor analy-\nsis (CFA) to examine the psychometric characteristics of the\nMMSS-25 and item subsets in a secondary analysis of data\n4 SAGE Open\ncollected from registered nurses in Lebanon and internation-\nally educated nurses in Qatar. Eligibility criteria for the par-\nent study (El-Jardali, Murray, et al., 2013) were as follows:\nregistered nurses of any nationality with at least 12 months in\ntheir current employment who were able to complete the\nstudy questionnaire in Arabic if working in Lebanon, in\nEnglish if working in Qatar. The Arabic version of the\nMMSS-25 was prepared following consultation with a panel\nof registered nurses in Lebanon and forward and back trans-\nlation by independent translators.\nParticipants\nThe characteristics of the respondents to the MMSS-25 are\ndescribed in Table 2.\nInstrumentation\nWe used the items listed in Table 1 and the data collected in\nLebanon and Qatar (El-Jardali, Murray, et al., 2013) to inves-\ntigate the measurement performance of the MMSS-25. We\nexamined response category ordering (whether use of rating\nscale categories increased monotonically as expected), item\ndifficulty (the ordering of items from the least difficult to the\nmost difficult to endorse), dimensionality or fit (whether the\nitems measured a single latent construct), targeting (whether\nthe difficulty of endorsing MMSS items was appropriate for\nthe sample), separation (whether the MMSS-25 was sensi-\ntive enough to distinguish between nurses with high and low\nlevels of satisfaction), reliability (whether there is a high\nprobability that respondents with high satisfaction measures\nwere more satisfied than those with lower measures), and\ndifferential item functioning (DIF; whether MMSS-25 items\nwere easier to endorse for nurses in Lebanon or in Qatar). We\nconcluded our analysis by using CFA to compare the fit of\nfive factor structures reported in the literature to our data.\nThe Rasch Measurement Model\nThe Rasch Measurement Model was developed by the\nDanish mathematician Georg Rasch (1980) as a special case\nof the general linear model (GLM). The Rasch model speci-\nfies the probability of correct responses to test items and\nstrength of endorsement of rating scale items. The ability of\nrespondents (aptitude for selecting correct answers/tendency\nto endorse rating scale items) and the difficulty of items\n(probability of a correct answer or of endorsing a particular\ncategory in a rating scale) are modeled on a continuous latent\nvariable measured in logits (additive log-odds units of equal\nmeasurement). For Rasch analyses of responses to polyto-\nmous items, the data are fit to the following mathematical\nmodel: loge (Pnij/Pni(j-1)) = Bn - Di - Fj, where loge is the\nnatural logarithm of the probability Pnij of person n of ability\nBn endorsing category j in response to a scale item of diffi-\nculty Di, as opposed to the probability Pni(j-1) of the person\nendorsing the next lowest category (j - 1). For example, if j\nis the endorsement of \"4\" on a 5-point Likert-type scale,\n(j - 1) would be the endorsement of \"3,\" the adjacent lower\ncategory. In this formulation, the parameter Fj defines the\nsame rating scale structure for all items (Linacre, 2012).\nUnlike raw scores for a test instrument or questionnaire\nthat have unknown intervals, the Rasch model enables inves-\ntigators to calibrate item difficulty and measure personal\nability using standardized intervals of measurement along a\ncommon continuum or latent trait.\nMore specifically, Rasch analysis examines how well items\nin a test or rating scale contribute to the useful measurement of\nan assumed one-dimensional latent variable (Rasch, 1980).\nRasch fit statistics indicate how well respondents and their\nresponses fit the response pattern predicted by the Rasch mea-\nsurement model. Infit and outfit statistics are calculated as chi-\nsquare values that range from zero to infinity. Infit and outfit\nvalues for an item that perfectly matches the Rasch model have\na mean square value (MNSQ) of 1. Items with MNSQ values\ngreater than 1 overfit the model because they lack precision.\nItems with values less than 1 are too predictable and may not\nachieve successful measurement. (Linacre, 2012). In Rasch\nanalysis, the dimensionality of rating scales and subscales can\nTable 2. Characteristics of Study Sample (N = 1,322).\nn %\nCountry\nNationality\nGender\nAge\nMarital status\nHighest nursing qualification\nEmployment\nClinton et al. 5\nbe checked by principal component analysis (PCA) of residu-\nals. The Rasch measurement model is the dimension of first\ncomparison. Second and subsequent dimensions with eigen-\nvalues greater than 2 suggest second and higher order dimen-\nsions that need investigation (Linacre, 2012).\nSoftware\nis available from Windows.com.\nResults\nResponse Ordering\nWe examined response ordering for the six-category rating\nscale used in the El-Jardali, Murray, et al. (2013) study (0 =\nno response, 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = agree,\n4 = strongly agree, 5 = not important to me). With responses\nin the \"not important to me category\" rescored as 0s, response\ncategories for 23 of the 25 MMSS items were disordered.\nThe exceptions were Item 15 \"The physicians you work\nwith\" and Item 21 \"Opportunities for career advancement.\"\ndered items. Categories 1 and 2 were disordered for Item 1\n\"Salary\" and Item 11 \"Maternity leave time.\" Response cat-\negory disordering was corrected by excluding null and not\nimportant to me responses. All of the following results were\nobtained using the four-category rating scale: 1 = strongly\ndisagree, 2 = disagree, 3= agree, and 4 = strongly agree.\nItem Difficulty\nThe measurement characteristics of the MMSS-25 were\nexplored using the corrected four-category rating scale\ndescribed in the previous paragraph. Respondents' mean raw\nsatisfaction scores were in the range 2.01\nwith the Rasch dimensioned latent satisfaction variable, the\nlogits for Item 12, with higher logit values indicating more\ndifficulty in endorsing the satisfied and very satisfied rating\ncategories. Respondents expressed their relative dissatisfac-\ntion with Item 3 \"Benefit package\" (M = 1.19 logits), Item 1\n\"Salary\" (1.08 logits), and Item 10 \"Compensation (pay) for\nweekend work\" (M = 1.01 logits). The nurses endorsed\nhigher categories of satisfaction for the items measuring per-\nceptions of their relationships with colleagues: Item 14 \"Your\nnursing peers\" (M = -1.63 logits; Item 13 \"Satisfaction with\nyour immediate supervisor (head nurse or facility manager)\"\n(M = -1.15 logits); and Item 15 \"The physicians you work\nwith\" (M = -1.05 logits). With respect to the Mueller and\nMcCloskey (1990) categorization of items, respondents\nexpressed least satisfaction \"safety needs\" items, somewhat\nmore satisfaction with \"psychological needs\" items, and\nmost satisfaction with \"social needs\" items (Figure 1).\nFigure 1 shows the relationship between measured nurse\nsatisfaction and difficulty of endorsing MMSS items. The\nnumbers in the first column (bottom to top) from -1 to 3 are\nmeasures of nurse satisfaction in logits. The distribution of\nsatisfaction measures for this sample is flatter than a normal\ndistribution and positively skewed. The difficulty of endors-\ning satisfaction with a MMSS item is shown in the column on\nthe right. Only nurses with satisfaction scores 1.3 standard\ndeviations above the sample mean were satisfied with Item 12\n\"Child care facilities\" and Item 3 \"Benefits package.\"\nNurses with satisfaction scores 1 standard deviation above\nthe mean measure for the sample expressed satisfaction with\nItem 10 \"Compensation (pay) for weekend work\" and Item\n11 \"Salary.\" The easiest item for the nurses to express satis-\nfaction with was Item 14 \"Your nursing peers.\" Nurses with\nlevels of satisfaction at or above -1.43 standard deviations\nfrom the sample mean were able to express satisfaction with\nthis item. The hierarchy of item difficulty can be seen by\nreading down the column on the right from the most difficult\nsatisfaction with coworkers and interaction opportunities\nwas expressed than with scheduling or with professional\nopportunities. Least satisfaction was expressed with the\nextrinsic needs of child care and benefits.\nDimensionality\nWe examined the dimensionality of the MMSS-25.The\nmeasures explained a relatively poor 39.5% of the raw vari-\nraw variance, 1.62 times more than explained by the first\ncontrast. The eigenvalue of 3.1 for the first contrast sug-\ngested the presence of a non-Rasch dimension with the\ndimension, in contrast to Items 8, 4, 6, 2, and 9 that loaded\nThe first contrast may differentiate responses by types of\nreflect psychological needs and Items 8, 4, 6, 2, and 9 reflect-\ning safety needs. We noted that Item 11 \"Maternity leave\ntime,\" Item 12 \"Child care for employees'children at facility,\"\nand Item 13 \"Your head nurse or facility manager\" had infit\nand outfit MNSQ values that exceeded 1.3; our cutoff value\nfor under fitting items. None of the items had MNSQ values\nless than 0.6, our cutoff value for overly predictable items.\nOur analysis indicated the possible existence of a second\nnon-Rasch dimension with a strength of approximately two\nitems (eigenvalue = 2.0) that explained 5.0% of the unexplained\nof this dimension, in contrast to Items 18, 19, and 17 that loaded\n-.54 to -.45 at the opposite pole. This dimension may distin-\nguish items that measure satisfaction with self-esteem needs\nfrom those that measure satisfaction with affiliation needs.\n6 SAGE Open\nItems that loaded positively and negatively on the contrasts\nderived from the principal components analysis (PCA) of\nresiduals were used to estimate differential person functioning\nusing independent t tests. Since >5% of the t-test values (9.6%)\nfor the first contrast and 10.7% for the second contrast were\noutside the range \u00b11.96 multidimensionality was confirmed.\nRemoving the three items with infit and outfit MNSQ val-\nvariance explained by the Rasch dimension to 39.8%. For all\npractical purposes, the strengths of the first and second con-\ntrasts remained unchanged (eigenvalues = 3.0, 2.0).\nTargeting\nThe MMSS-25 items were a very good fit for 85% of the\nsample; person mean discrimination -0.14 logits, model root\nmean square error (RMSE) 0.36 logits, item mean discrimi-\ndifficulty of the items was slightly greater than the mean sat-\nisfaction of the nurses -.14 logits. No items matched the\n8.6% of the nurses with the highest levels of satisfaction or\nthe 6.4% of least satisfied nurses.\nPerson Separation and Reliability\nThe WINSTEPS person separation index indicates the sensitiv-\nity of a measure to distinguish between higher and lower mea-\nsensitive enough to distinguish approximately four strata of\nnurse satisfaction, person reliability index 0.87. The person raw\nscore test reliability (estimated traditional test\u00adretest reliability\nCronbach's ) for the MMSS-25 was approximately .95.\nDIF\nDIF occurs when respondents with the same ability level\nhave different probabilities of endorsing response categories\nParticipants ordered by satisfaction | Items ordered by difficulty to endorse\nMost satisfied participants (logits) | Most difficult items to endorse (logits)\n. |\n. |\n. |\n# |\n. |\n.# |\n.### |T\n.### | D12Child_Care D3Benefits\n.######### |\n.######## |S\n.######### | D24Enc_Feed D2Vacation D7OP_PT\n.########## M| D19Prof_Inte D4Hours D5Hours D8Wk_off\n############ | D17Soc_Conta D23Rec_Peers\n.########### |\n.####### S| D13NuMAN\n.###### |T\n.#### | D14Nur_Peers\n## |\n## |\n.

We examined whether nurses in Qatar\nRasch measures for job satisfaction responded differently to\nMMSS-25 items. None of the items was biased in favor of\nnurses in either country, confirming that the MMSS items\nwere not biased irrespective of whether nurses responded in\nArabic or English, nor were items biased by nurses' country\nof employment: middle income (Lebanon) or high income\n(Qatar).\nDiscussion\nRating Scale Categories\nAlthough the MMSS is a well-established and occupation\nspecific measure of nurses' job satisfaction, its psychometric\nproperties when used with samples outside Western coun-\ntries have not been critically examined. Until now, no attempt\nhas been made to determine whether MMSS items adminis-\ntered in English or Arabic in countries in the Middle East are\nbiased in favor of local or internationally educated nurses.\nFurthermore, in the absence of studies conducted in middle-\nincome and high-income countries in the region, there has\nbeen a gap in knowledge about whether the MMSS is uni-\nformly productive of measurement when used outside North\nAmerica. Our results do not support Abu Ajamieh et al.'s\n(1996) recommendation that a four-category rating scale\nshould be used when investigating nurses' job satisfaction in\nthe region. Reducing the rating categories to four for our\nRasch analyses contributed to the relatively small proportion\nof variance explained by MMSS-25 items.\nWe recommend that investigators conducting future stud-\nies of nurses' job satisfaction in Middle Eastern countries\nrely on the four-category scale (strongly disagree, disagree,\nagree, and strongly agree) only when they have added items\nthat are easier and more difficult to endorse than those in the\nMMSS-25, or remove items clustered around the center of\nthe distribution for item difficulty. These strategies are\nrequired to increase the proportion of variance explained by\nMMSS items, irrespective of whether the scale is adminis-\ntered in English or Arabic.\nDIF\nOur results show that responses to MMSS items concerned\nwith salary and benefits are not biased in favor of nurses in\neither high- or middle-income countries in the Middle East.\nThis finding is counterintuitive because nurses' salaries in\nQatar are significantly higher than the salaries paid to nurses\nin Lebanon. The benefits available to nurses in Qatar are\nsimilarly more generous than those available to nurses in\nLebanon. The reason we did not find the MMSS salary and\nbenefit items biased in favor of either Lebanese nurses or\ninternationally educated nurses in Qatar is because we\nexcluded nurses with extreme high and low satisfaction\nscores from our DIF analyses. When we repeated our DIF\nanalyses with the deleted records reinstated, we found\nmedium to strong evidence of item bias. We found that Item\n4 \"Hours that you work\" was significantly more difficult for\nnurses in Lebanon to express satisfaction with compared\nwith those in Qatar (effect size = 1.25 logits, t = 12.6, df =\n966, p < .01). A moderate to large DIF value was found for\nItem 6 \"Opportunities to work (consecutive) straight days\"\nwas also more difficult for nurses in Lebanon to endorse.\nConversely, Item 7 \"Opportunity for part-time work\" (effect\n\"Satisfaction with your immediate supervisor (head nurse or\nfacility manager)\" (effect size = -0.98 logits, t = 9.19, df inf.,\nyou work with\" (effect size = -0.79 logits, t = -7.44, df inf.,\np < .001); and item 15 \"The physicians you work with\"\nmore difficult for nurses in Qatar to endorse. We suggest that\ninvestigators measuring nurse job satisfaction in Middle\nEastern countries consider the possibility of bias in MMSS\nitems and consider either dropping seemingly biased items\nfrom their data set or including additional satisfaction items\nto offset the possibility of DIF.\nDimensionality\nThe literature we reviewed indicates that an eight-factor\nmodel for the MMSS and a three sub-dimension model\n(Mueller & McCloskey, 1990), a seven-factor model\n(Tourangeau et al., 2006), a five-factor model (Al-Enezi\net al., 2009), and a four-factor model (Abu Ajamieh et al.,\nWe ran a CFA using PCA with varimax rotation to exam-\nine the fit of seven of (Mueller & McCloskey, 1990) eight-\nfactor models to our data.

However, we could not investigate fac-\ntor structure invariance across samples because we did not\nhave data on all 31 items included in Mueller and\nMcCloskey's (1990) eight-factor model. Neither could we\nexamine the fit of the full Tourangeau et al. (2006) seven-\nfactor model.\nClinton et al. 9\nIn light of these findings, we reexamined the item-person\nmap for the MMSS-25. Figure 1 shows that as many as 14\nMMSS-25 items could be redundant. When we examined\nitem redundancy among MMSS-13 items, we identified five\npotentially redundant items. The items for possible deletion\nwere Item 3 \"Benefits package,\" Item 5 \"Flexibility in sched-\nuling your hours,\" Item 6 \"Opportunities to work (consecu-\ntive) straight days,\" Item 8 \"Weekends off per month,\" Item\n9 \"Flexibility in scheduling time-off,\" and Item 19\n\"Professional interactions with other disciplines.\" We\nretained all five items because they did not duplicate the\nmeaning of the items with which they shared similar Rasch\nitem measures. We suggest that investigators conducting\nstudies of nurse job satisfaction in Middle Eastern countries\nconsider using the MMSS-13 as a core set of items with\nwhich to screen nurses for work satisfaction.\nThe MMSS-13 has acceptable psychometric characteris-\nwith the exception of Item 13 \"Satisfaction with your imme-\ndiate supervisor (head nurse or facility manager),\" outfit\nestimated Cronbach's alpha .91; person index 2.03, sufficient\nto distinguish among three strata of satisfaction (low satis-\nfaction, moderate satisfaction, higher satisfaction). However,\nthe ceiling effect of the MMSS-13 excluded 8.4% of the\nmost satisfied nurses in our sample. The floor effect of the\nscale excluded a further 16% of our sample. Consequently,\nour study supports (Mueller & McCloskey, 1990) suggestion\nthat investigators should add items independent of the\nMMSS-31 according to their specific research objectives.\nWhen we excluded the 12 non-MMSS-13 items, the pro-\nportion of raw variance explained by the measures increased\n(Fisher, 2007) to achieve more than a poor quality of mea-\nsurement. However, 42.5% of explained raw variance in\nRasch analysis is sufficient for such practical purpose as ini-\ntial screening of respondents if the first contrast to the Rasch\ndimension does not indicate an obvious non-Rasch dimen-\nsion. The MMSS-13 items explained 12.6% of the raw vari-\nance in our data. The proportion of variance explained by the\nmeasures can be improved by including participants with a\nwider range of satisfaction measures, by sampling nurses in\na wider range of health care facilities, by conducting multi-\nsite studies or by including nurses with more diverse qualifi-\ncations. In addition to including more items targeted at nurses\nwith lower and higher levels of satisfaction, the proportion of\nraw variance explained can be increased by including items\nknown to be relevant to nurses in the sample rather than rely-\ning on items selected from the (Mueller & McCloskey, 1990)\nThe empirical usefulness of our shorter scale in Middle\nEastern countries needs to be established. Whether investiga-\ntors should use the MMSS-31 or our shorter version depends\non the purpose of their studies. For initial assessment of\nnurse job satisfaction and for collecting time series data, the\nshorter scale may be preferred. However for more complex\nstudies, including those that involve causal analyses in which\nhypotheses are tested about factors that influence nurses' job\nsatisfaction, the most productive approach would be to com-\nbine the MMSS-13 scale with hypothesis-specific items.\nMore work needs to be done on the dimensionality of the\nMMSS as a whole and on shorter versions because Maslow's\n(1954) hierarchy of human needs does not provide a suffi-\nciently predictive theory for understanding occupation spe-\ncific job satisfaction. Whereas the hierarchy of needs offers\na general framework for understanding human motivation,\nthe assumptions on which it is based, such as the discrete-\nness of levels of human needs, are untenable because it is\nincapable of capturing situation-specific causal factors.\nWhen considering the use of job satisfaction items in sam-\nples of local nurses working in Middle Eastern countries,\ninvestigators should consider the possibility of item bias\namong MMSS items. We found that Item 13 \"Satisfaction\nwith your immediate supervisor (head nurse or facility man-\nager)\" could be biased in favor of nurses working in cultur-\nally homogeneous work settings, such as Lebanese nurses\nworking in Lebanon (effect size = -1.16 logits, t = 10.6, df =\nWe readily acknowledge the limitations of our study. Our\nRasch and CFA analyses were conducted as a secondary\nanalysis of data on only 25 of Mueller and McCloskey's\nries we used were different from those used by Mueller &\nMcCloskey (1990). Despite these limitations, we have estab-\nlished that the MMSS-31 is not a suitable measure for inves-\ntigating nurses' job satisfaction in Middle Eastern countries.\nThe scale explains a relatively low proportion of raw score\nvariance in nurses' job satisfaction scores, and up to 45% of\nMMSS items may be redundant depending on the setting and\ncontext. Whereas the MMSS is clearly not unidimensional,\nfurther studies are required to establish its factor structure.\nFour of five factor models tested were plausible but not a\nclose fit to our data. We have reported on a close fitting fac-\ntor structure for MMSS-13 scale items, which are suitable\nfor administering inArabic or English to nurses in the region.\nAt the same time, we have confirmed that the MMSS-13 pro-\nvides a psychometrically acceptable core set of items to ini-\ntially screen nurses in the Middle Eastern countries for levels\nof job satisfaction, irrespective of whether they work in mid-\ndle- or high-income countries in the region.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe primary study was funded by the Alliance for Health Policy\nand Systems Research.
