Data are scarce for patients with no history of\nintravenous drug abuse (IVDA) or cardiac device insertion. This study analysed the consistency of\npresurgical echocardiographic results with surgical findings for vegetation identification, and the\nfactors that influence accuracy of echocardiography.\nMethods: This retrospective trial divided infective endocarditis (IE) patients into three subgroups\naccording to the results of their presurgical TTE: left-sided native IE (LSNIE), left-sided prosthetic\nvalve IE (LSPIE) and RSIE. The accuracy of TTE was tested by comparing vegetation (number and\nlocation), detected presurgery by TTE, with actual findings during surgery.\nConsistency between TTE findings and surgical results was lower in the RSIE group compared with\nthe LSPIE and LSNIE groups. Consistency was lowered by the presence of vegetation in multiple\nlocations and atypical distribution \u00ad both of which were increased in the RSIE group. The chance of\nvegetation in both sides of the heart rose with increased numbers of vegetation locations in RSIE\npatients. A high proportion of RSIE patients had congenital heart defects, mostly ventricular septal\ndefects.\nConclusions: TTE may be unsuitable for RSIE patients with no history of IVDA or cardiac device\ninsertion, because multifocal and atypically distributed vegetation may influence detection\naccuracy.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nimr.sagepub.com\nPulmonary Heart Centre, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital\nMedical University, Beijing, China\nCorresponding author:\nShuang Liu, Pulmonary Heart Centre, Beijing Anzhen\nHospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100023, China.\nEmail: liushuangmedsci@163.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and\ndistribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page\n(http://www.uk.sagepub.com/aboutus/openaccess.htm).\n",

The sensitivity of TTE may be reduced\nfor very small vegetative lesions and there\nmay be difficulties in identifying vegetation\nin the presence of pre-existent severe lesions\n(such as mitral valve prolapse, degenerative\nlesions and prosthetic valves).6 The identifi-\ncation of vegetation may also be difficult\nwhen the lesions are nonoscillating and/or\natypically distributed.4 Conversely, false\ndiagnosis of IE may occur due to difficulty\ndifferentiating between vegetation and\nthrombi, prolapsed cusps, cardiac tumours,\nmyxomatous changes, Lambl's excrescences,\nstrands or noninfective vegetations (mar-\nantic endocarditis).4,7\nCompared with left-sided IE (LSIE), the\nincidence of right-sided IE (RSIE) is much\nlower, accounting for 5\u00ad10% of cases of\nIE.8,9 RSIE is most frequently observed in\nthose with a history of intravenous drug\nabuse (IVDA).10\u00ad12 The value of TTE as a\nmethod for discovering vegetation is con-\nfactory assessment of large vegetations and\nof valvular involvement because of the\nanterior location of the tricuspid valve.8,14\nSan Roman et al. have shown that even the\nuse of transoesophageal echocardiography\n(TEE) did not increase the accuracy of TTE\nfor the detection of vegetation in tricuspid\nendocarditis.15 However, most of these data\nwere obtained from patients with a history\nof IVDA or from those who had received\ncardiac devices, with little data presented for\nRSIE patients without either of these\nhistories.\nThe reported incidence of IE in patients\nwith congenital heart disease (CHD) is many\ntimes higher than that in the general popu-\nlation,16\u00ad18 and is particularly high for\nRSIE.17 With economic and technological\ndevelopments, survival rates have improved\nin patients with complicated CHD, but this\nhas resulted in the emergence of complex\nThe present study retrospectively ana-\nlysed patients who received surgery to treat\nIE (and any concomitant structural abnor-\nmality, if present), and compared the con-\nsistency of echocardiographic findings with\nsurgical findings of vegetation (and\nabscesses). This study also compared the\nconsistency rates between LSIE and RSIE\npatients, and analysed factors that influ-\nenced the accuracy of TTE judgements for\nvegetation in RSIE patients with no history\nof IVDA or cardiac device insertion. The\naims of the study were to provide meaningful\ninformation on the diagnosis of RSIE for\nechocardiographic experts and clinicians,\nand to promote the accuracy of\nidentification by highlighting important\nissues that are frequently ignored or mis-\nunderstood in clinical work. Such issues are\nparticularly relevant in the treatment of\npatients with CHD.\nMethods\nPatients\nSequential patients with IE, admitted to\nBeijing Anzhen Hospital between January\npatients included in the study underwent\nsurgery for at least one of the following:\nremoving vegetation and/or abscesses; repair-\ning or replacing valves; correcting CHDs. The\npatients had received TTE on one of the 0\u00ad30\ndays before the operation. For those who\nunderwent more than one operation during\nthe study period, only the results from the\nfirst operation were used in the present ana-\nlyses. Patients who were not treated with\nsurgery, or who were treated with a procedure\nthat did not require the heart to be opened\n(for example coronary artery bypass graft or\npericardial surgery) were not included in the\nstudy. Also excluded were those who did not\nreceive TTE in the Anzhen Hospital, or those\nin whom TTE was not completed 30 days\nprior to surgery. Patients with RSIE who\nreceived a cardiac device during their surgery\nwere also excluded from the study. All\npatients were interviewed about their medical\nhistory and were evaluated carefully on\nadmission and before surgery. The character-\nistics of all patients conformed to the Duke\nThis study was approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board of Beijing\nAnzhen Hospital. All patients (or parents\nof patients) provided written informed con-\nsent for participation in the study.\nUltrasound assessment\nThe TTE was performed by highly experi-\nenced cardiologists to evaluate the presence,\nlocation and size of vegetations, to provide\nsystematic evaluation of all the valves in\nmultiple acquisition angles, and to calculate\ncardiac chamber size and ejection fraction.\nDuring TTE, possible vegetations that were\nhardly differentiated from a pre-existing\nlesion with thickened or calcified leaflets\nwere regarded as vegetation during analysis.\nInterval points were calculated as the time\nbetween the last echocardiography and the\nday of surgery, and were then classified into\nregurgitation point of affected valves had\nfour degrees of classification: 0, no regurgi-\ntation; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe. If\npatients had an echocardiographic examin-\nation more than once with different results,\nthe final one prior to surgery was used for\nthis study. According to TTE, patients were\nclassified into three subgroups: left-sided\nnative IE (LSNIE); left-sided prosthetic\nvalve IE (LSPIE); RSIE. Patients with con-\ncomitant left- and right-sided IE and CHD\nwere regarded as RSIE during statistical\nanalysis.\nTransoesophageal echocardiography was\nperformed on patients at the discretion of\nthe treating clinician and when results of the\nTTE were questionable.\nSurgical assessment\nStandard blood cultures were taken for\nevery patient. All patients received anti-\nbiotics for 4\u00ad8 weeks, dosed according to\nbody weight and creatinine clearance values.\nThe following regimens were used: penicillin\nalone; penicillin in combination with other\nantibiotics; cephalosporin in combination\nwith other antibiotics; vancomycin in com-\nbination with other antibiotics. Antifungals\nwere prescribed for those whose symptoms\nwere suggestive of a fungal infection.\nDuration point refers to the time between\nsymptom onset and day of surgery, and was\nclassified into three subgroups for statistical\n3, < 60 days. According to surgical findings,\nlesions on the mitral and aortic valves of the\nleft heart and the tricuspid and pulmonary\nvalves of the right heart were defined as\ntypically distributed anatomical vegetation.\nAtypical anatomical vegetation included\nlesions in the ventricle, atrium, aorta, pul-\nmonary artery, ductus arteriosus, etc. If no\nvegetation was found in the right hearts of\nLSNIE and LSPIE patients without struc-\ntural heart disease by ultrasound, patients\nwere not explored surgically and were clas-\nsified as having negative findings. If vegeta-\ntion was not found during surgery, the TEE\nresult was considered to be a false positive.\nSome patients, therefore, failed to meet the\nmajor and minor Duke criteria for IE diag-\nnosis, but were still regarded as IE patients\nfor this study because of their clinical char-\nacteristics, which included fever and severely\ndamaged valves.\nStatistical analyses\nNumeric values were reported as\nmean \u00c6 SD; age, left ventricular ejection\nfraction (LVEF), heart function, regurgita-\ntion point and duration point were com-\npared by analysis of variance. Categorical\nvariables were compared with 2-test.\nStatistical calculations were performed\nusing SPSS\u00d5 version 16.0 (SPSS Inc,\nChicago, IL, USA) and a P-value < 0.05\nwas considered statistically significant. A\nsensitivity analysis of patients with or with-\nout CHD was also undertaken.\nResults\n(median 39.0 years), who conformed to the\nDuke criteria for IE.20 Fifteen patients with\nconcomitant left and right IE and CHD\nwere regarded as RSIE during statistical\nanalysis. TEE was performed on 23 (5.5%)\ningful positive blood-culture report.\nPenicillin alone was prescribed for 25\n(6.0%) patients, penicillin in combination\ncephalosporin in combination with any\nmycin in combination with any other anti-\nreceived antifungal agents, with some\npatients receiving antifungal therapy con-\ncomitantly with antibiotics.\nVegetation was not found during surgery\nin 93 patients; the presurgery TTE result was\ntherefore considered a false positive in 66\npatients.\nCompared with LSNIE and LSPIE\ngroups, patients from the RSIE group were\nyounger, had better LVEF and were less\nlikely to be male (Table 1). Patients with\nLSPIE had the poorest heart function of the\nthree groups, while RSIE patients had the\nbest. Regurgitation tended to be milder in\nthe LSPIE patients compared with the other\ngroups. In the LSPIE group (n \u00bc 31) only\nhad undergone mechanical valve implant-\nation before IE and the remaining patients\nhad received biovalves. In the LSNIE group\nincluding 12 (3.7%) with ventricular septal\ndefects (VSD), five (1.6%) with atrial septal\ndefects (ASD) and 36 with malformations of\npatients were diagnosed with rheumatic\nvalvular disease but none had received\nvalvular treatment; the remaining 175\npatients had no basic heart disease. There\nVSD, three (4.8%) had concomitant VSD\narteriosus, three (4.8%) patients had tetral-\nogy of Fallot, four (6.3%) had very rare\nstructural abnormalities. One patient (1.6%)\nhad rheumatic valvular disease. There were\nno differences between the groups in terms\nof the duration point or the interval point.\nThe consistency of the TTE results with the\nsubsequent surgical findings regarding vege-\ntation was much lower in the RSIE group\nthan in the other groups. Consistency\nshowed no obvious variability across the\nentire study period.\nThe LSPIE, LSNIE and RSIE groups\nwere considered to be separate entities in\norder to calculate the consistency of TTE\nwith surgical findings of vegetation. There\nwere no significant differences between con-\nsistency values across the three groups\n(Table 2).\nThe consistency of TTE with surgical\nfindings for patients with surgically-con-\nfirmed vegetation is shown in Figure 1A.\nPatients with multifocal vegetation (at least\ntwo locations) had significantly lower con-\nsistency between TTE results and surgical\nfindings than patients with vegetation in no\nremoving all patients found during surgery\nto be free of vegetation (n \u00bc 93), patients\nwith surgically-confirmed atypically\ndistributed (multifocal) vegetation (n \u00bc 32)\nhad much lower rates of consistency\nbetween TTE and surgical findings than\nthose with typically distributed vegetation\n(Figure 1B).\nThe RSIE group had a significantly\nhigher rate of surgically-confirmed multi-\nfocal vegetation than the LSNIE and LSPIE\nFigure 2): patients without vegetation find-\nings during surgery were excluded from the\ncalculation.

Compared with\npatients with LSNIE or LSPIE, the consist-\nency of echocardiographic identification of\nvegetation with actual surgical findings was\nlower in the RSIE group. Therefore, the\nidentification of RSIE by TTE may not be\nsuitable for patients who have no history of\nFigure 2.

For these areas, echocardiograpic\nimages are good. Vegetation may be located\nanywhere on the components of the valvular\nand subvalvular apparatus, as well as on the\nmural endocardium of the cardiac chambers\nor the ascending aorta.6 In the present study,\nsurgery confirmed that atypically distributed\nvegetation was present in 32 (7.7%) of all IE\npatients, including vegetation in the aorta,\npulmonary artery, left ventricle, right\nventricle and other positions of the left and\nright heart. Compared with IE patients with\ntypically-distributed vegetation, patients\nwith atypically distributed vegetation had\nreduced consistency (by 28.0%) between\nTTE and surgical findings. This phenom-\nenon was even more striking among RSIE\npatients. RSIE vegetation may not only be\nentrapped in the tricuspid and chordal\napparatus, but also in mural and atrial or\nventricular defect areas, and sometimes may\npresent as embolized vegetation floating free\nin the right ventricle or pulmonary\nthe dominant type of congenital abnormal-\nity for RSIE patients, and the chances of\natypically distributed vegetation were higher\nfor these patients than for those with LSNIE\nand LSPIE. In addition, we found a much\nlower consistency between TTE and surgical\nidentification of vegetation among RSIE\npatients than among LSIE patients, which\ndiffers from a case report confirming TTE\nvalidity for diagnosing atypically distributed\nRSIE vegetation.24 In our opinion, TTE\nmay not be adequate for diagnosing sus-\npected IE patients with CHD and/or atyp-\nically distributed vegetation because of its\npoor accuracy, especially for RSIE patients.\nAlthough the need for routine TEE in RSIE\nremains questionable, it may be useful in\ndetecting unusual localizations of RSIE,\nsuch as infection on the Eustachian valve\nor on the Chiari network;25,26 in addition,\nTEE is more sensitive than TTE in the\ndetection of pulmonary vegetation and\nabscesses (particularly those adjacent to\nthe membranous septum), and associated\nleft-sided involvement.27 When necessary,\nX-ray or computed tomography should also\nbe considered, to exclude pulmonary\nembolism.\nIn the present study, the consistency rate\nof TTE with surgical findings was only\n45.7% when multifocal vegetations were\nverified during surgery.

For RSIE\npatients with no history of IVDA or cardiac\ndevice insertion, attention is needed to\nidentify widely distributed vegetation, espe-\ncially those lesions that are atypically\nlocated. According to some reports, TEE is\nuseful for identifying multifocal IE affecting\nvalves, mural areas within atria and ven-\nIn our study the tricuspid was the most\ncommonly affected valve in the right heart,\nand most patients with multifocal vegetation\nhad CHD. Although some RSIE patients\npresented with left heart vegetation, only\nthree (4.8%) patients had cyanotic CHD (all\ntetralogy of Fallot) and very few had trivial\nright-to-left shunt. In our opinion, this\nmeans that patients with CHD may have a\nhigher risk of concomitant RSIE and LSIE\neven at an early disease stage, before a severe\nhaemodynamic disorder. It seems VSD\npatients with associated valvular regurgita-\ntion have higher incidences of IE,31 but it\nremains unclear whether the rectification of\na structural abnormality reduces the risk of\nLSIE for patients who already have tricus-\npid regurgitation due to VSD or an ASD.\nWhether or not left-to-right shunts are pre-\nsent for RSIE patients with CHD, especially\nVSD, we consider that special attention is\nneeded to investigate multifocal as well as\nconcomitant left-sided vegetation, which\nseems to be more dangerous than isolated\nRSIE vegetation and should always be\ntreated more aggressively by surgery. TEE\nis also recommended for CHD patients with\nsuspicions of concomitant RSIE and\nSeveral shortcomings with the present\nstudy should be mentioned. First, as a\nretrospective study, data were as good as\nwere available, and were not always per-\nfect. For example, although the complete\nstudy consistency (TTE results and surgi-\ncal findings) was > 80% in our analysis,\nvery few people received TEE (which\nshould be considered in patients with\npoor image quality with TTE, and in\nthose who have a negative TTE result\ndespite a moderate or high level of clinical\nsuspicion of IE).32 The decision to operate\non patients without a TEE was taken\nbecause most of the IE patients in this\nstudy had concomitant CHD and surgery\nwas already necessary to correct a con-\ngenital abnormality. Secondly, the diag-\nnosis of IE may be difficult at an early\ndisease stage, when vegetative lesions are\nnot yet present or are too small to be\nidentified.33 In this study, a few patients\npresenting with complicated pathologies\nhad different TTE findings by the same\ncardiologist over a period of several days,\nso the final one (before surgery) was used\nin order to fulfil the study objective.\nThirdly, with rapid development of the\nhospital facilities over recent decades, the\nechocardiographic equipment has greatly\nimproved, which was difficult to take into\nconsideration in our study. However, the\naccuracy of echocardiographic identifica-\ntion appeared to be similar year on year,\ndespite improvements in equipment.\natypically distributed vegetation and 57\n(70.4%) with multifocal vegetation were\nadmitted after 2007 rather than in the first\nhalf of the study, which made the diagnosis\nof IE more challenging for doctors in the\nlatter half of the study, even with better\napparatus, and can to some extent explain\nthe similar accuracy of TTE over the\ndecade. No literature is available to com-\npare the accuracy between the old and the\nmore advanced echocardiographic appar-\natus in terms of RSIE, but careful selection\nof transducers (sometimes higher fre-\nquency transducers may improve spatial\nresolution), the use of the `zoom function',\nand paying attention to the adjustment of\nsector width, depth and focus settings are\nrecommended for accurate identification\nof vegetation in the right heart.4\nThe time delay between the last echocar-\ndiography and surgery may influence the\naccuracy of vegetation identification, but\nwas similar between the groups and there-\nfore unlikely to influence the results of this\nstudy. Ideally, echocardiography should\noccur 1\u00ad3 days before surgery, considering\nthe instability of vegetative lesions in the\nheart.\nThis study recorded a very low rate of\npositive blood cultures. This is likely due to\nthe fact that Beijing Anzhen Hospital is a\ntertiary referral centre, receiving patients\nwith IE from around the country, most of\nwhom had received antibiotics in their local\nhospital prior to transfer.\nThe experiences of other developed coun-\ntries in the treatment of patients with IE may\nnot translate well to Chinese society because\nof different social and health backgrounds.\nFor example, the incidence of chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is\nhigher in China than in western nations,\npartly because of higher rates of smoking\nand pollution in China.34 Patients with\nCOPD with barrel chests may have a lower\nrate of accuracy of vegetation identification\nin the right heart (where blood velocity is\nslower than in the left side) with TTE,\ncompared with patients without COPD.35\nOur results are applicable to patients world-\nwide. Further research to investigate the\naccuracy of echocardiography for diagnos-\ning IE without IVDA, but with CHD and\nother diseases, is worthwhile.\nIn conclusion, the objective findings from\nsurgery in this retrospective study have\nshown that TTE may not be ideal for\ninvestigating vegetation in RSIE patients\nwith no history of IVDA or cardiac device\ninsertion. To promote accurate rates of TTE\nidentification, doctors should be very alert\nto multifocal and atypically distributed\nvegetative lesions. For RSIE patients com-\nplicated with CHD, special caution is\nneeded to exclude the potential presence of\nconcomitant left-sided vegetation.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors had no conflicts of interest to declare\nin relation to this article.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
