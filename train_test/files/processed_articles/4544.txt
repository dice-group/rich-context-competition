    "abstract": "Abstract\nMany stakeholders are concerned with the apparent failure of schools to facilitate children achieving at high levels. One\nexplanation of the failure of schools takes a more narrowly focused educational view. In this perspective, the problem is one\nof inadequate standards and poor teachers. In a second, broadly societal view, the problem of student achievement seems to\nbe a complex societal problem, not easily amendable to strictly educational solutions. The two positions are compared and\ncontrasted. Examples of societal factors affecting student achievement are explored. It is suggested that the broadly societal\nview provides a better explanation of why students fail to succeed.\n",

Specifically, I\nwish to deal with the perceived lack of student achievement\nin K-12 schools in the United States. It is my aim to examine\nthe attribution of causation for underachievement as pro-\nposed in the conventional wisdom. Furthermore, I will offer\na different suggestion for the cause of the \"problem.\" What\nthis article does not do is to offer a real solution to the prob-\nlem. As the reader will see, if my suggestion has merit, the\nsolution is neither simple nor clear. It will require effort and\ningenuity (innovation) from many quarters.\nMany stakeholders in the United States have addressed\nthe problem of student achievement. Comparing student\nachievement to expectations derived from state and national\nbenchmarks has arrived at the conclusion that students are\nnot achieving at a satisfactory level of performance.\nFurthermore, many point to international comparisons as\nevidence of underachievement of U.S. students. Finally, it\nappears that many students lack the skills necessary to suc-\nceed in college or the workplace. The conclusion of many is\nthat U.S. students are far behind where they should be when\nit comes to academic achievement.\nIt is no secret that some have questioned whether the\n\"problem\" is as severe as some commentators and lawmak-\ners claim. Many claim, for example, that U.S. scores on the\nNational Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) are\nconsistent rather than declining. Still, other measures lead\nstakeholders to conclude that American students are lagging\nbehind. (See Bracey, 2008, for an evaluation of what various\nassessments prove and fail to prove.)\nIn this article, I wish to examine two possible interpreta-\ntions of the cause of the problem. The first cause sees the\nproblem as more narrowly educational. The solutions to the\nproblem, in this view, involve adjusting, what we might call,\neducational factors. This is the view that represents the domi-\nnant educational and political orthodoxy of the day.\nThe second cause I will describe as more broadly societal.\nThis viewpoint seems to be more associated with the Great\nSociety days of U.S. policy. However, there are new factors\nthat require that Americans take a closer look at this point of\nview. This article suggests that the broadly societal view of\nthe problem of inadequate achievement is better at describ-\ning the problem than the narrowly educational view.\nThe Narrowly Educational View\nIn the educational view, the issue of the achievement gap,\nboth in international as well as national terms, is seen as a\nfailure of schools. This failure involves two main compo-\nnents. The first is a lack of rigorous standards for schools. The\nsecond component of school failure is inadequate, inept, and,\nperhaps, incompetent teachers. The solutions here mostly\ncenter around creating and establishing higher standards and\n1Kentucky Wesleyan College, Owensboro, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nJames Alexander, Kentucky Wesleyan College, 3000 Frederica St.,\nEmail: jamesal@kwc.edu\nThe Demise of Education or the Eclipse\nof Compassion?

The challenges, while incorporating con-\ncerns about academic achievement, are more far-reaching\nthan that. Perhaps the main difficulty is a lack of creativity--\ninnovation. For Wagner, what our educational system funda-\nmentally lacks is not more standardized tests. The problem is\none of shallowness of the curriculum and the failure to\nemphasize critical thinking.\nIn his video, The Finland Phenomenon, Wagner investi-\ngates the educational system of Finland--considered by\nmany accounts to be the best in the world. Many of the direc-\ntions that U.S. reformers are taking are a clear departure from\nthe standard of excellence typified by the Finnish system. In\nFinland, there seems to be little in the way of the \"testing\nfrenzy\" that characterizes U.S. schools. Also, the Finnish sys-\ntem is characterized by demonstrating trust in the wisdom of\nteachers rather than taking a punitive approach to improve-\nment of instruction. In short, Wagner admits there is a prob-\nlem with education in America but seems to believe that\nstakeholders are perhaps \"missing the boat\" when it comes to\nsolutions.\nStandards\nFor many, the first line of attack when it comes to failing\nschools is to tighten standards and make standards more rig-\norous. For the past 30 years at least, there has been a move to\ninstitute standards that define exactly (or nearly so) what stu-\ndents should be able to do and what they should know at any\ngiven instructional level. This is usually combined with some\ncriterion-referenced assessment scheme that aims to measure\nstudent attainment of the prescribed standards.\nThere have been many \"versions\" of generally agreed\nupon benchmarks. Originally, these benchmarks were delin-\neated by the various states. Still, if one were to examine stan-\ndards from state to state, one would find a general agreement\nin what was expected of students and teachers. Of course,\nthis doesn't mean that there is no variation, both historically\nand presently. But the general thrust of standards tends to\nreflect common concerns.\nI have noted, talking with teachers and administrators,\nthat often realignment and revision of standards appear to\nmany as merely \"shuffling\" things around a bit. Standards\nare framed and reframed, but the basic core remains the\nsame. Normally, mastery of standards is assessed in discrete\nways using items on criterion-referenced tests. The combina-\ntion of standards and testing leaves the system open to criti-\ncism by some.\nThe main critique tends to be that all of this leads to\n\"teaching to the test.\" Beginning in the mid-70s, my work as\na public school teacher was in the area of primary grades\nremedial reading. The state in which I was teaching put into\nplace a mastery testing system in the mid-80s. At that point,\ndescriptors of what should be taught and when it should be\ntaught were provided to schools. These standards (or perhaps\nat that point, proto-standards) were assessed by discrete\nitems on a statewide test. The expectation was that my\nChapter I (Title I) reading students would improve in the\ntested areas.\nFollowing the general guidelines, I began to teach to the\ndiscrete testing areas. The result? My students' vastly\nimproved test scores. In fact, many \"tested out\" of remedial\nreading classes. The problem was that the classroom teachers\nstill felt that many of these students did not read well. It\nseems, the idea of teaching to the test becomes a critique of\nthe system because it is felt that such teaching is far too\nnarrow.\nThe latest foray into the world of standards in the United\nStates is the creation and implementation of the Common\nCore State Standards (Common Core State Standards\nInitiative, 2012). The promoters and adopters of these stan-\ndards (most of the states) see these standards as more rigor-\nous and broader than former attempts. In the 2012 Brown\nCenter Report, \"How Well Are American Students\nLearning?\" (Loveless, 2012), the success or potential suc-\ncess of standards (such as the Common Core State Standards)\nin addressing student achievement is explored. In looking at\nstandards historically, the Report finds little in the way of\nsuccess. Furthermore, the Report questions whether new or\nrevamped standards, namely, the Common Core, are an\nimprovement over earlier standards. The creation of stan-\ndards is an ever-growing, never-ceasing endeavor. However,\nthe Report suggests that a different approach is required. In\nshort, standards are not succeeding. Of course, it might be\nargued that the failure of revamped and newly minted stan-\ndards to improve achievement leads to many adjustments\nand improvements in pedagogical approaches--as standards\nare continually reworked and fine-tuned. As a curriculum\nguide, the Common Core State Standards may prove quite\nuseful. The reality, however, is that standards are often\nmainly used as a rationale for test items; more feared than\nused judiciously. Certainly, new standards lead to higher lev-\nels of accountability for teachers as well as students.\nOverall, are the new standards likely to improve the situ-\nation? The standards movement has existed for many years.\nIt seems as if, when faced with less success than expected,\nthe idea is that everything will work out if we can just find\nthe \"right\" standards (or perhaps the right way to word them).\nAlthough many schools (perhaps most) say that they are\nimplementing the Common Core State Standards, and\nalthough virtually all teachers and administrators state that\nthey understand the standards, few teachers believe that the\nStandards will improve student learning (MetLife, 2013).\nTeachers\nThe other major area of education reform deals with teachers--\nnamely getting rid of poor teachers and improving the quality\nAlexander 3\nof the rest. On the face of it, it is difficult to see how anyone\ncould realistically differ with that goal. What we need, how-\never, is to look a bit more closely.\nBracey (2008) suggests that those who raise the cry of\nreform most loudly are \"playing fast and loose with the\ntruth.\" The notion of a failing education system that can be\nfixed by working to get rid of teachers is deeply flawed.\nOftentimes, the problems of \"failing schools\" is laid at the\nfeet of teachers. Yet many of these schools are high-need,\nhigh-poverty schools. The idea of getting rid of the teachers\nthat are charged with causing the failure and replacing them\nwith more competent, motivated teachers is unlikely to suc-\nceed. Few teachers, especially new ones, will want to take on\na class of kids who are desperately poor, working far below\ngrade level, and seem to lack motivation (of course, some\nwill).\nOverall, the goal of reformers of improving the teacher\ndetails the profile of recent graduates of education colleges:\n1. Candidates have higher GPA's than in the past.\n2. Praxis pass rates have decreased, largely due to\nhigher standards put in place over the last several\nyears.\n3. The academic profiles of candidates has markedly\nimproved.\n4. The improvement in subject-specific areas is espe-\ncially noted in those pursuing secondary\ncertification.\nEven though this data was reported in 2007 (6 years ago),\nthe perception remains that teachers are largely incompetent\nand lack academic qualifications for the job. This is true,\neven though admission to college departments of education\noften requires higher academic and test performance than\nother degree programs.\nAlthough there is a general tendency to blame lack of\nachievement on classroom teachers, regardless of the quality\nof the teaching force for the last several years, that may be a\nfaulty assumption. The notion is that many teachers are\nincompetent and/or lazy. While this may sound like a worth-\nwhile observation in the aggregate, it breaks down in the par-\nticular. I have worked with preservice teachers for many\nyears in three states. In the classroom of practicing teachers,\nwhere my students are placed for field experiences, I observe\nlittle in the way of incompetent, ineffective teachers.\nFurthermore, most building principals in U.S. schools rate\ntheir teachers as very good or excellent (MetLife, 2013).\nCertainly, there is little, if any, incentive for principals to\nretain and praise ineffective teachers. In fact, principals in\nthis age of high accountability would likely have a vested\ninterest in getting rid of poor teachers.\nThe common notion adopted by many proponents of edu-\ncational \"reform\" is that the most reliable and accurate\nappraisal of student learning and teacher performance can be\nfound in standardized tests. In a report of a recent study\nfunded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Sawchuk\n(2013) casts doubt on the common orthodoxy. The study\nfound that the best evaluations of teacher effectiveness\ninvolved a combination of teacher observations, student per-\nceptions of teacher effectiveness, and standardized test\nscores. The study finds that relying most heavily on stan-\ndardized test data is counterproductive. Also, such data does\nnot offer much predictive value when it comes to student per-\nformance on more cognitively demanding tasks.\nIn a recent survey of teachers and principals, MetLife\n1. Only 39% of teachers reported being very satisfied\nwith their jobs (the lowest level in 25 years).\n2. Fifty-one percent of teachers report being under sig-\nnificant stress at their jobs.\n3. Three out of four principals regard their jobs as too\ncomplex.\n4. About a third of K-12 principals believe they will\nlikely enter a different profession in the next 5 years.\nThere may indeed be a problem regarding educators in\nAmerica. It appears, however, that the problem might be\nwhat conditions do to educators rather than problems caused\nby educators.\nAmidst demands for greater accountability, many meth-\nods of ensuring teacher quality are suggested. One that is\ncurrently gaining popularity in some quarters is value-added\nassessment. In this system, statistical methods are applied to\ndetermine which teachers are succeeding and which are fail-\ning in adding \"value\" to a child's achievement. The system\nhas been touted as fair and useful for comparing achievement\nat the building and district levels, across states, and for eval-\nuating the relative success of teacher education units at col-\nleges and universities The idea is that such assessments\nmeasure how much value is added to a child's educational\nprofile, regardless of whether a child is \"on grade level\" or\nThere are some problems with the scheme. The major\nproblem is that such systems cannot adequately assign value\nto the various factors that influence student achievement. In\nvalue-added paradigms, the major influence on student\nachievement is what the teacher does. The approach assumes\nthat teachers must be threatened and cajoled into putting\nforth the effort required to ensure student achievement. It\nremains to be seen if poor teacher performance is wide-\nspread. It also remains to be seen if the teacher's classroom\nperformance really is the main determiner of students' aca-\ndemic achievement, or just one of many factors; and perhaps\nnot the most important one.\nBausell (2013) expresses caution regarding value-added\nevaluation. Although, value-added teacher evaluation is both\npromoted and criticized, rarely is this approach examined\nfrom a scientific perspective pursued without an agenda. The\n4 SAGE Open\nconventional wisdom is that \"causal conclusions can be\nteased out of huge data sets by economists or statisticians\nusing sophisticated statistical models that control for extra-\nneous factors.\" Using a model of statistical design and analy-\nsis normally associated with medical research, Bausell calls\nthat wisdom into question.\nIn such a model, subjects are \"(a) premeasured on an out-\ncome, (b) randomly assigned to receive different treatments,\nand (c) measured again to ascertain if changes in the out-\ncome differed based upon the treatments received.\" This\nresearch paradigm is virtually impossible when it comes to\nresearch on the effectiveness of value-added assessment in\nimproving student achievement.\nThe gold standard in medical research is random assign-\nment. For reasons known and unknown, schools cannot truly\nrandomly assign students to educational conditions. As\nBausell writes (2013), \" . . . any student assigned to any\nteacher can receive auxiliary tutoring, be helped at home,\nteam-taught, or subjected to any number of naturally occur-\nring positive or disruptive learning experiences.\" In short,\nvalue-added systems simply cannot adequately control for\nsuch factors. Many of these variables are not only unknown\nbut even unknowable.\nAs a transition into our discussion of the societal\napproaches to understanding the \"problem,\" it should be\nnoted that other factors that influence student achievement\nand relate to the ways that teachers are evaluated have been\nnoted. Elsewhere, many factors influence student achieve-\nment. It is reported that 97% of students receiving A's and\nB's on their report cards had parents who consistently\nencouraged them to do well in school, while 49% of students\nreceiving C's received little such encouragement. While\nabout 50% of our proclivities are genetic in nature, the\nremaining 50% seems to make a real difference. It is this\n\"half\" of our personal cognitive profiles that are highly\namendable to parental influence (Alexander, 2011).\nAnd parental encouragement isn't the only consideration.\nSome have estimated that about 9% of variation in student\nachievement is due to teacher characteristics. About 60% of\nvariation is explained by family characteristics, student char-\nacteristics, and such variables. All direct school input com-\nbined (teacher quality, classroom variables, etc.) seems to\naccount for about 21% of student outcomes (Goldhaber,\n2002). To sum up, the narrowly educational view of the prob-\nlem of student underachievement is, at best, suspect.\nThe Broadly Societal View\nThe alternative view of the \"problem\" looks to society in\ngeneral as the impetus for the creation of both good and ill in\nthe education of young people. This view is quite broad. It\nincorporates such societal/environmental variables as vio-\nlence, media, youth culture, and politics. Of course, educa-\ntional factors are not excluded, since they fit into the societal\nmix as well. However, those factors are only part of the\nequation, and perhaps not the major component in student's\nfailure to achieve. In addition, as we have seen, the usual\napproach to the educational \"side of the ledger\" is likely mis-\nconceived. Perhaps a broadly societal perspective offers a\nclearer view.\nThere are far too many factors in the societal mix to sort\nthem out here. For the purpose of this discussion, the focus\nwill be on three major influences that might affect children\nand schools. The first, family considerations, has an obvious\neffect on children both in and out of school. The second, pov-\nerty, has long been identified as a predictor of academic dif-\nficulty. It is widely accepted that socioeconomic status (SES)\nhas a greater effect on student achievement than race, gender,\nor age of students. The third consideration, technology, is (in\nsome ways) a rather new but major contender in affecting\nchildren at school and at home as it may even affect thinking\nprocesses. As society and schools in particular wholeheart-\nedly embrace technology, it may be to our benefit or to detri-\nment, as is indicated below.\nFamilies\nOlsen and Fuller (2011) point out many ways that families\nhave changed over the years. Many of these trends are\npatently obvious. There is a shift from two-parent families to\none-parent families. There are more grandparents raising\nchildren. Modern families face problems of child abuse and\ndomestic violence. There is a precipitous increase in blended\nfamilies. Families are highly mobile and, depending on fac-\ntors such as parental work skills and education level, there is\nthe very real specter of creating and furthering generational\npoverty. It might be that parents are having less input into the\nlives of their children. Finally, childrearing practices have\nbecome more permissive and, in some cases, negligent.\nAre all of these changes completely negative? While we\nmight be tempted to say that they likely are not, it is more\naccurate to say that there is no definitive answer to the ques-\ntion. For many, the general trend toward a more negative out-\ncome for families is a foregone conclusion. Yet, strong,\nhealthy families come in many shapes and forms. It does\nseem certain, however, that many of the shifting trends bear\ncloser scrutiny.\nIn Michael Winerip's December 9, 2007 New York Times\narticle, \"In the Gaps at School, Weighing Family Life,\" the\nresults of a study by the Educational Testing Service (ETS)\nare discussed. If ETS has expertise at all, it must certainly\nbe in the field of assessment. ETS researchers examined\nfour variables: absenteeism, the percent of children living\nin single-parent families, the amount of television watch-\ning, and how much preschoolers are read to daily by par-\nents. Using these factors, the researchers found they could\npredict states' results on reading tests in eighth grade with\nconsiderable accuracy. They determined that these four fac-\ntors accounted for two thirds of the variance of results\nbetween states.\nAlexander 5\nThe report went on to say that by the time many kids start\nschool, they are already behind. A child from a single-parent\nhome is 2.5 times more likely to repeat a grade. By age 4, a\nchild from a professional family hears about 35 million more\nwords than his more disadvantaged counterpart.\nAll of this is significant and little of it is within the\nschool's, much less the teacher's, control. Add to this the fac-\ntors of transience and limited English proficiency and it\nbecomes apparent that approaches such as value-added\nassessment are far too crude to address something as com-\nplex as student achievement and the \"problem\" with schools.\nSchools deal with a very multivariate clientele. As we have\nseen, approaches such as value-added assessment just cannot\naddress the variables (which are multiplying) that teachers\nface every day. Embracing such heavy-handed approaches to\nstudent achievement is overly simplistic. It is a bit like using\na sledgehammer as a fly swatter. Many of the solutions pro-\nposed to deal with the problems associated with schools are\njust not sensitive enough to the variables of the real world,\nwhich inevitably involve family life and structure.\nPoverty\nRuby Payne (2005) enumerates some of the characteristics of\ngenerational poverty in the United States. These characteris-\ntics include\n1. Background noise--The T.V. is almost always on.\n2. Little room for academics--Discussions tend to\navoid academic topics.\n3. Expectations for men--Men are expected to be \"real\nmen\" not \"eggheads.\"\n4. Negative orientation--The orientation in stories and\noutlook is generally negative.\n5. Polarized thinking--Thinking tends to be absolute.\nStatements such as \"I can't do it\" are common.\n6. Lack of future orientation--There is little real plan-\nning for the improvement of conditions in the future.\n7. Lack of organization--Homes are often unkempt and\ndisorganized.\n8. Distrust of educational institutions--There is a dis-\ntrust of schools, and children often have a negative\nview of school.\nCertainly, all, some, or none of these characteristics may\nbe obvious in the history of any given child. Some of these\ncharacteristics are obviously influential when it comes to\nchildren and schooling. Some characteristics may have indi-\nrect effects. Some may not impact learning in any measur-\nable way (at least in many cases). What is quite apparent is\nthat poverty impacts kids. In addition, the number of children\nliving in poverty is on the rise. Poverty, as part of the constel-\nlation of factors comprising the concept of socioeconomic\nstatus, has long been noted to impact student learning\n(Snowman & McCown, 2013). It is quite safe to say that the\nimpact of poverty is well established and there is little doubt\nthat schools with large populations of underprivileged chil-\ndren tend to perform poorly on most measures of achieve-\nment relative to schools with wealthier populations.\nThere is a mistaken idea that the problems of the poor\ncould be solved if only they worked, or at least worked\nharder. I sometimes have my classes engage in an activity to\ninvestigate that notion. I present my students with a scenario\nin which a single mother with two children works 30 hours a\nweek for minimum wage. Then we look at expenses such as\nfood, transportation, clothing, and medical care. When\nviewed in this light, the causes of discouragement are quite\napparent.\nAs stated above, the impact of poverty on children in\nschools is well known. Yet, the political climate as it stands\nin the United States hardly favors new expenditures to help\nalleviate poverty. Certainly, a comprehensive societal\napproach to dealing with the concerns related to education\nmust address poverty.\nTechnology\nAny discussion of the impact of technology on society in\ngeneral and children in particular needs to begin with the\nreality that it is not going away. Cris Rowan (2013) raises the\nquestion of whether technology is interfering with the devel-\nopment of children. Technology impacts children socially,\ncognitively, and physically. Children interact with others dif-\nferently when technology pervades their lives. In fact, they\nmay interact less. They think in different ways in and out of\na heavily technology \"saturated\" environment. Certainly,\nhours of technology use impacts physical development.\nWhen it comes to children and learning, technology is pow-\nerful. And when it comes to culture and society, technology\nis ubiquitous. Still, adopting a Luddite position about the\nissue simply won't do. At least not anymore. Technology\nimpacts society, and therefore children. This is apparent to\nthe most casual observers. The question of rather the adop-\ntion of technology should proceed uncritically is a question\nof a different order. It bears asking.\nNo matter what one's political inclination might be, it is\nbeneficial to read Al Gore's insightful book, The Future\n(Gore, 2013), dealing with current and future societal trends.\nIn particular, Gore reviews the place of technology in the lives\nof world citizens. Gore points out that the upcoming revision\n(as of this writing) of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorders will include a note about \"Internet Use\nDisorder\" as being worthy of further study. It is clear that\nGore sees the Internet as influencing society and persons. The\namount of time spent online may well be changing our con-\nsciousness. Humanity evolved literacy over the millennia.\nYet, it is possible, as Gore indicates, that our basic neurologi-\ncal structure might be shifting, due largely to technology. The\nprint revolution that accompanied the growth of literacy\nseems to be rapidly overshadowed by the digital revolution.\n6 SAGE Open\nThe influence of technology is ubiquitous. Gore tells of\nhow 40% of smartphone owners connect to the Internet upon\nawakening. By 2015, there will be as many mobile Internet\ndevices as there are people on the planet. Much of what Gore\nwrites about deals with the idea that \"we make our tools, and\nthen our tools make us.\" Still, he states that technology does\nnot change human nature. I would argue that technology\ndoes interact with our humanness to create new facets of cul-\nture and societal influence.\nTurkle (2011) writes of how technology has the potential\nto isolate individuals and undermine community. It seems\ncounterintuitive. It seems as if digital connectivity would\nonly serve to broaden our relationships and deepen our sense\nof community. Some years ago, I attended a Peter, Paul, and\nMary concert where they commented on how we are never\nso alone as when we are \"connected.\" As Turkle indicates,\nreal relationships often suffer in the face of increasing\nembrace of technology. It is unclear how the supplanting of\n\"face to face\" relationships with digital connections might\naffect children.\nThere is some evidence that the Internet is making us more\n\"shallow.\" Technology can tend toward superficiality. Some\ncommentators (see Carr, 2010, for example) urge caution in\nthe embrace of technology. These critics view technology as\na potential impetus in \"dumbing us down.\" While society in\ngeneral and schools in particular seem eager to embrace tech-\nnology, the verdict is not yet fully in on the impact on society,\nculture, or schools. As Moore's Law suggests, the growth of\ntechnology proceeds in an ever-accelerating pace. Could it be\nthat the rapid pace with which society embraces technology is\noutpacing the accumulation of data relative to the impact of\nthat embrace?\nAlthough there are many implications of the rise in tech-\nnology in our society, and these all affect the ways that chil-\ndren and adults relate to the world, to school, to work, and to\neach other, some aspects of technology do seem to have a\nrather direct impact on children and schooling. For years,\nsome voices in the field of learning and cognitive psychol-\nogy have urged caution in how children utilize technology.\nCarr (2010) sounds a cautionary note concerned with the\neffect of technology on attention spans and thinking pro-\ncesses in general. Furthermore, some researchers state that\nthe effectiveness of teaching with a large component of tech-\nnology has not been demonstrated to outperform more con-\nventional approaches (see Alexander, 2012).\nWhat is clear is that, whether in school or out of school,\ntechnology is here to stay. It is ubiquitous. In a positive\nappraisal of technology in society and biology, Kurzweil\n(2005) describes how the growth of technology, both in\nterms of computing power as well as prevalence, is exponen-\ntial. Although some may have concerns, and although some\nlegitimate cautionary notes might be voiced, the \"genie can-\nnot be put back in the bottle.\" Nor should we wish to gener-\nally reverse the trends that have led to advancements in\ntechnology applications. This does not mean, however, that\nsociety's embrace of technology should be unexamined or\nunequivocal.\nFinal Thoughts\nAlthough it is not my purpose here to offer specific solu-\ntions to curricular and pedagogical concerns, there are many\nideas which have promise, and which should be imple-\nmented. Reorganization of schools to implement ideas such\nas competency-based education (Kentucky Department of\nEducation, 2013) might certainly help compensate for envi-\nronmental and societal factors which hinder student learn-\ning. However, even with this being the case, the main\nproblem is not specifically \"educational\" nor can it be ade-\nquately addressed by changes in the way that schooling is\ndelivered. The problem lies much deeper, and superficial\nfixes are unlikely to succeed.\nThis, then, is my diagnosis of the \"problem.\" As stated at\nthe outset, it is not my intention to offer a solution here. I feel\na bit like a physician that has only partial training. It seems\nthat I can diagnose, but I cannot say how to cure the disease.\nSince poverty, technological impact, the nature of fami-\nlies, and other such contemporary concerns are very human,\nsocietal factors, the answer seems to call for very human\nsolutions. Perhaps the demise of education, if such a demise\nexists, is not so much due to pedagogical and curricular fac-\ntors. Perhaps the demise of education is, in reality, an eclipse\nof compassion.\nThis article has contrasted two views dealing with the\nproblem of student underachievement: the narrowly educa-\ntional view and the broadly societal view. It is suggested that\nthe broadly societal view more aptly frames the problem.\nThis view may well suggest solutions as well. Societies can\nchange directions. If the civil rights movement of the 1960s\nproves anything, it proves this. Throughout history, societal\nconcerns have lead to paradigm shifts. Perhaps it is time for\na civil discussion once again. It is reasonable to assume that\nsociety and societal changes impact schools and children.\nThe task of social science analysis is to \"tease out\" the ways\nthat the educational endeavor is diminished. Then, seeing\nmore clearly, society can better determine which societal\nshifts or changes should be embraced, when caution is war-\nranted, and when change should be resisted. Caring for chil-\ndren and supporting teachers is a far better way forward than\naccusing and punishing.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nAlexander 7\nReferences\nAlexander, J.
