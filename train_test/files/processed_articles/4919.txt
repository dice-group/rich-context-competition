Does their formation take time to develop? How\ndo they contribute to determining and defining a visual object, and how do they differ? How do visual\nartists use them to create objects and scenes? Is the way artists use them related to the way we\nperceive them? To answer these questions, we studied the microgenetic development of the object\nperception and formation. Our hypothesis is that the main object properties are extracted in sequential\norder and in the same order that these roles are also used by artists and children of different age to\npaint objects. The results supported the microgenesis of object formation according to the following\nsequence: contours, color, shading, and lighting.\n",

Through phenomenological\nexperiments, Rubin discovered the following general figure-ground principles: surrounded-\nness, size, orientation, contrast, symmetry, convexity, and parallelism. In his experiments,\nRubin used line drawings to emphasize one aspect of the representation of such objects,\nnamely, the 2-D outline--the external bounding contour, or silhouette.\nIn Figure 1 these properties are clearly visible. This figure can be described as follows: four\nwiggly rectangles, the larger one including the other three, smaller and similar to three biscuit-\nlike surfaces upon a plate. The four rectangles assume the shape traced by the contours,\nimplying that the contours belong unilaterally to each rectangle (border-ownership, see\nbackgrounds--ie, the area surrounding the large rectangle and the area included in the large\nrectangle that is the background of the small rectangles.\nIt is worthwhile noticing that the inclusion of the three small rectangles inside the surface\nof the large one induces the perception of two other possible results as alternatives to the\nprevious descriptions (ie, by perceiving one, the other is excluded and vice versa). These\nalternatives are the following: (i) the large rectangle appears as an empty space (some kind of\nwindow or simply as a wiggly contour) or as a hole while the small rectangles are perceived\nas surfaces and (ii) the small rectangles can be perceived as three holes upon the rectangular\nsurface. These outcomes, even if possible and partially reversible, are not as strong as the\nprevious main description that can be attributed to the size and surroundedness principles\nstudied by Rubin.\nThe color/brightness of the large rectangle and of the small ones is perceived full like a\nsurface and denser than the same physical color/brightness on the surrounding background\nFigure 1. Four wiggly rectangles, the larger one including the other three, smaller and similar to three\nbiscuit-like surfaces upon a plate.\nthe rectangles show a surface color/brightness property (Erscheinungweise, Katz 1911,\n1930): the chromatic paste appears solid, impenetrable, and epiphanous like a surface;\non the contrary, the background is not seen like a surface but empty, penetrable, and\ndiaphanous, similar to a void (Katz 1911, 1930). The small rectangles appear like figures\nin relation to the large rectangle, which is perceived as a sort of \"background\" with respect\nto the small rectangles but like a figure or a surface if compared with the surrounding\nspace, perceived instead as an empty background. Briefly, the large rectangle appears as a\n\"background surface\", on which the small rectangles are placed. The phenomenal notion\nof \"background\" emerging from the two conditions (empty space surrounding the large\nrectangle and large surface containing the small rectangles) belongs to two different domains:\nfigure-ground segregation and part-whole (surrounding-included) differentiation. Thus\nsome chromatic/brightness differentiations are perceived between the small and the large\nrectangles, but not in terms of full and dense versus transparent and empty as occurs with the\nlarge rectangle and surrounding space. These results suggest that every kind of figure-ground\nor part-whole segregation elicits a chromatic-brightness differentiation, whose phenomenal\nproperties depend on the specific kind of segregation perceived.\nNext, and joined to the previous figure-ground attributes--ie, the unilateral belonging-\nness of the contours that become boundaries of the figure and the chromatic/brightness\ndifferentiation between figure and background--there is a third main attribute, namely, that\nfigures appear closer to the observer than do backgrounds: thus, the large rectangle appears\ncloser than the empty surrounding space, and the small rectangles appear closer than does\nthe large one.\nThe perception of the three attributes is clearly related to the formation of the main object\nattributes, ie, shape, color, and depth (Rubin 1915, 1921), emerging when a figure-ground\nsegregation occurs.\nFigure 1 suggests that a single contour is perceived as a breakpoint differentiating the\nvisual field in complementary (opposite) attributes related to shape, color, and depth. In\nother words, a contour induces a phenomenal asymmetry of figure-ground attributes. If\nthis were not true, then it would be impossible to perceive Stravinsky's portrait in Picasso's\ndrawing illustrated in Figure 2a or, more simply, an amoeboid surface in Figure 2b. Instead,\nthe expected results would have been, in Figure 2a, a complex set of contours running in\nPerceptual organization of shape, color, shade, and lighting 259\ndifferent directions and intersecting one another without showing any specific surface or\nobject organization, and in Figure 2b, an undulated closed contour. It should be noted that\nPicasso's drawing shows both figure-ground segregation and part-whole organization as in\nFigure 1, demonstrating superimposed planes and layers of figures and surfaces completing\namodally (Pinna 2008a) one behind the other.\nFigure 2. Stravinsky's portrait (1920) by Picasso (a) and an amoeboid surface (b).\nThe phenomenal organization of contours in figure-ground and part-whole organizations\ncan be considered as the visual evolution of a contour in a surface. The perception of Figure 3a\nas an open figure rather than as an undulated contour clearly demonstrates this unavoidable\nevolution. The figural effect strongly persists. This result also occurs in Figure 3b, where\nthe vertical undulated contour creates a figure-ground segregation on both its left and right\nsides. The three attributes of shape, color, and depth even if reversible on the two sides are\ndistinctly perceived. In Figure 3c, the perception of a contour is enhanced at the expense of\nthe surface evolution by interweaving its terminations. It is expected that the line perception\nfrom its ends fills the entire contour, thus eliciting the perception of an undulated line.\nThis expectation prevents possible inner contradictions or antinomies within the contour\ncontinuation (see also Pinna and Reeves 2006). Nevertheless, this is not the main result: the\nundulated central component of the contour, the one not interweaved, is seen as a figure or\nas a surface similarly to Figure 2b and Figure 3a. Despite the uniqueness of the geometrical\ncontour and of the good continuation principle as suggested by Wertheimer (1922, 1923), the\nline is perceived as such only in its terminations and becomes a surface (a boundary contour)\nin its central component. This figure shows the necessity to distinguish between line and\ncontour perception, where the contour refers to the conditions where a line represents a\nshape or a surface.\nIt is worthwhile noticing that the global convexity of Figure 3c creates an inside-outside\neffect in the whole figure. However, the same distinction between line and boundary contour\noccurs also when the inside-outside effect is annulled in conditions similar to Figure 3b\n(Figure 3d). This demonstrates that interweaving versus untwine conditions are the most\nresponsible for the presence within the same figure of contours that appear as lines or\nboundary contours along the same drawing.\nThis kind of discontinuation of contour and figure/surface perception can also be ob-\nserved in Picasso's (Figures 4a\u00ade) drawings. More specifically, in Figures 4d\u00ade, the surrounding\ncontours among all the ones illustrated become the boundary of the figures, while the inner\nones appear like filling coloration or part-whole articulation. All the previous examples\nsupport the idea that the contours tend to become the boundaries of segregated surfaces,\nFigure 3. An open figure (a), figure-ground segregation on both left and right sides (b), the non-\ninterweaved undulated central component of the contour appears as a figure (c\u00add).\neven under unfavorable conditions like those illustrated in Figures 3c and 3d and Figure 4,\nthus creating asymmetrical and complementary figure-ground attributes.\nThe figure-ground segregation problem, posed by the previous figures, is related to the\nway the complementary properties are extracted and organized. The main questions we\nasked in this work are: Where are representations of shape, color, depth, and lighting mostly\nlocated? Does their formation take time to develop? How do they contribute to determining\nand defining a visual object, and how do they differ? How do visual artists use them to create\nobjects and scenes? Is the way artists use them related to the way we perceive them?\n2 General methods\nFor each set of figures different groups of 12 undergraduate students of architecture, design,\nand linguistics (regarding the descriptions of the figures reported within all sections, except\nsection 4.2.1) as well as 12 children for each age from 5 to 18 years old (as regards the results\nreported in section 4.2.1) participated in the experiments. Undergraduate students had some\nbasic knowledge of gestalt psychology and visual illusions, but they were naive both to the\nphenomena studied and to the purpose of the experiments. Within each group, subjects\nwere about 50% male and 50% female, and all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.\nPerceptual organization of shape, color, shade, and lighting 261\nStimuli were the different sets of pictures that are presented in the following sections of\nthe article. Every set of stimuli was described by a different group of subjects. The overall\nsizes of the visual stimuli were ~4 deg. The figures were shown on a computer screen with\nambient illumination from an Osram Daylight fluorescent light (250 lux, 5600\u00b0 K). Stimuli\n100 Hz), driven by a MacBook Pro computer with an NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT. Viewing\nwas binocular in the frontoparallel plane at a distance of 50 cm from the monitor.\nTwo methods were used with undergraduate students: one more qualitative (phenomeno-\nlogical task), similar to those used by gestalt psychologists, and another more quantitative\n(rating task). A new task (pictorial reproduction task) was used with children of different ages.\nThe task of the subjects was to report spontaneously what they perceived by giving an\nexhaustive description of the main visual property. The descriptions were provided by at\nleast 10 out of 12 subjects and were reported concisely within the main text to aid the reader\nin the stream of argumentations. The descriptions were judged by three graduate students of\nlinguistics, naive as to the hypotheses, to get a fair representation of the ones given by the\nobservers.\nSubjects were allowed to make free comparisons, confrontations, afterthoughts, to see\nin different ways, distance, etc, to match the stimulus with every other one. Variations\nand possible comparisons occurring during the free exploration were noted down by the\nexperimenter. As concerns these tasks and procedure see Pinna (2010b).\nA new group of 12 subjects rated the adequacy of the edited results that emerged from\nthe phenomenological task. They were instructed to rate (in percent) the descriptions of the\nspecific attribute obtained in the phenomenological experiments. In other words, subjects\nwere instructed to rate the relative strength or salience (in percent) of the descriptions of\nthe phenomenological task as follows: \"please rate whether this statement is an accurate\nreflection of your perception of the stimulus, on a scale from 100 (perfect agreement) to 0\n(complete disagreement)\". Throughout the text, we reported descriptions, whose results of\nthe rating task (mean rating) were greater than 80.\n2.3.3 Pictorial reproduction task\nThe task of the children was to describe and make a painted copy (the order of the two\ntasks were randomized) of what they perceived on the computer screen (see the stimuli\nreported in section 4.2). Possible stages of development were defined by 100% of times that\nsubjects represented the stimuli in a specific way. Children could use freely all the pastels,\nprovided by the experimenter in a paintbox containing 36 different colors. All subjects\nwere tested individually and video recorded to keep track of the temporal sequence of the\npictorial reproduction. During the experiment, observation and painting time was unlimited.\nReports for visual stimuli occurred spontaneously and fast, while painting time could change\naccording to the children's skills, age, and personal reproduction speed.\n3 Boundary, color, shading, and lighting contours\n3.1 Where are shape, color, and depth mostly located?\nSome answers to the previous questions can be found by going back to the previous figures\nand by improving their figure-ground effects. As for the question \"where are shape, color,\nand depth mostly located?\", they suggested that, under these specific conditions, these\nattributes are placed along the contours. Because a single contour tends to be perceived as\nthe boundary of an object, and because it tends to impart surface color/brightness attributes\nand depth segregation, it follows that the information about these three attributes depends\nand is placed along the contour.\nA convincing demonstration of this general statement can be obtained by asking subjects\nto paint any object. It is expected that they take a black pastel and draw the boundaries of\nthe object forming its shape. The drawing of the boundary contours is considered sufficient\nto create a visual object. It is sufficient because the addition of other information, such as\ncolor, shades, and lighting, is usually considered secondary with respect to the contours. The\npresence of contours is sufficient to create objects and events in many different domains like\nart (see previous drawings and the detail of Giotto's fresco of Figure 5a, detail of Death of St\nFrancis and Inspection of Stigmata, 1320), comics (Figure 5b), Roman mosaics (Figure 5c),\nand Greek decorations (Figure 5d).\nIt is necessary because without contours no object can be created. This is also true under\nconditions apparently contradicting this statement, like in Seurat's paintings, where lines and\ncontours are now made of discrete elements (points) instead of continuous lines. Therefore,\nthese paintings can be considered in terms of visual scale and observation distance. The\nprimary role of contours remains strong also after a very large magnification and even when\nonly the dots emerge. In fact, under these conditions the tendency to group the dots in\nobjects and create contours is immediate as demonstrated by gestalt psychologists.\nIn Figure 5e, Picasso's woman (Blue Nude, 1902) emerges not on the basis of the colors\nfilling the canvas but mostly because of the contours that organize the chromatic paste\nto become different properties of the woman's body, ie, shade, surface color, and light. A\nfurther demonstration of the necessary condition is the fact that contours are depicted even\nwhere they are not physically required. This implies that contours are phenomenally but\nnot physically necessary. In Figures 5f\u00adh, respectively, two paintings by Schiele (Self-Portrait,\nof the sharpness and strength of the contours and demonstrate their shaping effect placed\neverywhere in the figure even where contours are not necessarily required. Last but not\nleast, as demonstrated by Rubin, all the figure-ground properties emerge immediately and\nautomatically with contours and so without any need to paint them or to add shading or\nlighting. All these examples prove that the contours are of paramount importance in defining\na visual object.\nIn spite of these arguments, by using only one black contour it is difficult or impossible\nto understand the visual organization of the figure-ground attributes, and thus some of the\nprevious questions: Does their formation take time to develop? How do they contribute to\ndetermining and defining a visual object, and how do they differ?\nTo answer these questions, we suggest introducing along the contours some variations as\nemerging from this illusion depends on two factors: the juxtaposition of contours and the\nformation of asymmetrical luminance and chromatic conditions along the contours. The\nmain argument is the following: because Rubin's figure-ground attributes emerge by virtue\nPerceptual organization of shape, color, shade, and lighting 263\nFigure 5. Examples of the primary role of the boundary contours in defining a visual object.\nof the phenomenal complementation of the unilateral belongingness of the boundaries,\nthe chromatic brightness induction and depth segregation produced on both sides of a\ncontour, by creating a physical asymmetry (asymmetrical gradient) through a juxtaposition\nof contour, the complementary figure-ground attributes are expected to be enhanced and\npossibly attributed to different adjacent contours. This suggests different contour roles in\nthe watercolor illusion.\n3.2 Different contour roles in the watercolor illusion\n3.2.1 Shape and color with two contours\nOne of the simplest conditions of the watercolor illusion induced by two adjacent\ncontours is illustrated in Figure 6, where the black contours of Figure 1 are split into two\nadjacent purple and orange contours. Phenomenally, the three figure-ground attributes\ndescribed in relation to Figure 1 are strongly improved. (i) The three biscuit-like surfaces\nand the large wiggly rectangle show now less ambiguously the unilateral belongingness of\nthe purple boundaries to them, ie, their belongingness is now perceived univocal and not\nreversible. The other possible solutions described in Figure 1 become now impossible: both\nthe large and small rectangles cannot be perceived as holes or empty spaces. (ii) The inner\ncoloration of the figures appears epiphanous, like a surface color, and is distinctly perceived\ntinted with a light orange color that fills homogeneously the biscuits and the large rectangle.\n(iii) The part-whole organization is perceived univocal, ie, three small wiggly rectangles\ncloser like bas-reliefs placed upon a large rectangle segregated in depth from the empty\nsurrounding space.\nStarting from this figure, a deeper phenomenological analysis advocates several general\nstatements. First of all, the unilateral and univocal belongingness of the purple contours to\nthe biscuit-like shapes and to the large rectangle suggests that only one of the two juxtaposed\ncontours becomes the boundary of the object. Pinna (2005) and Pinna and Reeves (2006)\nshowed that the contour with the highest luminance contrast tends to be perceived as the\noutermost boundary of the figure. We call this \"boundary contour\". In Figure 7, by reversing\nthe colors of the two contours, ie, the purple becomes orange and vice versa, the boundary\ncontour is also reversed, creating three biscuit-like holes within a large rectangular hole.\n\"Holes upon a larger hole\" is very different from \"figures upon a figure\". Only the second\ncondition is logically possible. However, what is logically impossible can be phenomenally\npossible. The two domains obey different rules (see also Kanizsa 1985, 1991). It is worthwhile\nFigure 6. The watercolor illusion. Figure 7. A variation of Figure 6 by reversing\nthe colors of the two contours.\nnoticing that by perceiving these results the gaze spontaneously follows the contours in all\ntheir inner and outer components.\nTo better appreciate the perception of holes upon a larger hole see Figure 8. Here, the\nthree holes are now placed on a large rectangular surface.\nFigure 8. A variation of Figure 7 by reversing the colors of the large rectangle.\nThe second main statement derived by the previous figures and the first statement say\nthat if one of the two contours assumes one role, the juxtaposed one assumes a different role.\nIn particular, if the purple contours of Figure 6 are the boundaries of the objects, the orange\ncontours define their color. We call this \"color contour\". A further demonstration of this\ngeneral statement can be proven phenomenally by referring to the spontaneous descriptions\nof Figure 6: three orange biscuits overlapped to a large orange rectangle. What is striking about\nthis description is what is not mentioned--ie, the color of the boundaries. Only the color\ncontour has a noticeable color while the boundary contour, playing a boundary role, does\nPerceptual organization of shape, color, shade, and lighting 265\nnot show its color. This does not mean that we cannot see the color of the boundary contours,\nbut that it remains \"unspecified\" and unnoticeable like a background. Even if Picasso in\nFigure 5e used black contours to define the boundaries, nobody sees a black woman. The\ncolor of the boundaries--even when strengthened and therefore more visible like in Picasso's\npainting--appears chromatically unspecified. The boundaries are boundaries without color\n(ie, they manifest a unique role, just boundaries). In other words, the boundary contours\ndefine only the boundaries and not the color, ie, the inner coloration. In Figures 9a\u00adc, the\ncolors of the boundaries of Matisse's paintings are irrelevant because they are boundaries, so\nthey pass unnoticed.\nFigure 9. Matisse's paintings. (a) Lady on the Terrace, 1902; (b) De jeu-de-boulesspelers, 1908; (c) Young\nAnother way to demonstrate the specialized and unique role of the contours is illustrated\nin Figure 10, where a variation of Picasso's horse shows a couple of black contours (Figure 10a)\nslightly but clearly shifted in the oblique direction (see also Pinna 2011). The shifted contours\nshow an effect of blur or duplicity of the boundaries of the horse. On the basis of the\nfirst general statement (only one of the juxtaposed contours, ie, the one with the highest\nluminance contrast, becomes the boundary of the object), given two black contours, none of\nthem prevails on the other as a boundary contour and none prevails as a color contour but\nboth are perceived as boundaries. The color contour can be assigned only after the boundary\ncontour has been already assigned.\nFigure 10. Variations of Picasso's Horse.\nBy replacing one of the two black contours with an orange one (Figure 10b), an orange\nhorse is now perceived. It is very difficult to perceive a black horse. The black contour is\npredominantly perceived as the boundary of the horse, while the orange contour appears\nas its color. It is worthwhile noticing that the modal coloration of the watercolor illusion\nis now absent, but an amodal spreading of color is perceived. The difference between the\ntwo colorations is based on their phenomenal appearance: in the case of the watercolor\nillusion, the color is perceived as painted within the figure, in the case of the horse the orange\ncolor of the contour is perceived as its color without modal coloration, but giving anyway a\nsense of chromatic completeness, unity, and wholeness (Pinna 2008a). We call this \"amodal\nwholeness of color\".\nWhen the black contour is replaced by a purple one (Figure 10c), the horse appears\norange: the color of the purple contour passes unnoticed and can be discounted similarly\nto the black contour of Figure 10b. Therefore, the orange contour assumes again the role of\ncolor and the purple one the role of boundary. The role specialization emerges also from\nthe fact that we perceive an orange horse and not a purple or a purple-orange horse. This\nsuggests that the boundary role belongs to the contours with highest luminance contrast\nindependently from its color. It is worthwhile saying that when there is only one contour as\nshown in Figure 10d and 10e, the first attribute that tends to be extracted and perceived is\nthe boundary. Its color passes unnoticed because it assumes the role of boundary. Therefore,\nin both these conditions we perceive a horse and not a black or a purple horse.\nThe previous figures suggest a third general statement: while boundary contours are\ngeared to delineate, outline, and segregate an object locally and in detail along the subtle line\nthat splits a figure from its background, color contours are aimed to complete and fill globally\nboth modally and amodally the inner surface of a visual object.\nFrom the three previous statements it follows that the information needed to define\nshape and color of a perceptual object is placed on its external bonds and limits, thin like\ntwo juxtaposed contours and placed where the object segregates from the background. From\nthe external contours these properties fill the whole object along the boundaries and within\nits surface.\nTwo controls with contours near equiluminance, illustrated in Figures 11a\u00adb, corroborate\nthese observations by demonstrating that the two contours show both boundary and color\nroles.\nFigure 11. Controls near equiluminance.\n3.2.2 Shape, color, depth, and lighting with six contours\nPerceptual organization of shape, color, shade, and lighting 267\nBy using two juxtaposed contours we can study the role of two (boundary and color\ncontours) of the three properties of the figure-ground segregation. Under these conditions,\nthe two roles appear clearly distinct. Nevertheless, the further distinction among boundary,\ncolor, and depth attributes cannot be effectively studied and, thus, understood by using only\ntwo juxtaposed contours. As a matter of fact, the orange contour does not show only color\nassignment but also shading and depth properties. The decrement of the luminance contrast\nperceived through the wiggly contours and the illusory coloration--the purple contour, the\norange contour, and the light orange coloration--creates an asymmetrical luminance profile\nthat provides a depth cue similar to that of the luminance gradients that govern the shape-\nfrom-shading (Pinna et al 2003; Spillmann et al 2004) and the Renaissance Chiaroscuro\nThe Renaissance artists used the chiaroscuro (see Figures 13a and 13c in section 4.1) as a\nstandard set of rules to apply light and shadow to a shape in order to create an illusion of\ndepth. A highlight marks the point where the light is orthogonally reflected. This is most often\nbright white, and it is the closest point to the light source where light is most concentrated.\nHighlights can be seen more easily on reflective or glossy surfaces. Moving away from this\nhighlight, light hits the object less directly and therefore has a darker value of grey. The\nshadow is the dark region opposite the light region. The core shadow is the center of the\ndarkened area. The reflected light area is the back edge of an object. It occurs in a shadowed\narea and is caused by the light being reflected from another area or created by a secondary\nlight source.\nTo study and understand the organization of boundary, color, and depth attributes, it\nis necessary to add more adjacent contours (eg, for a total of 6 as illustrated in Figures\n12a\u00adb; due to the limited space and therefore to the size of the illustrations, the number\nof contours may not be perceived clearly, but they emerge when zoomed into). Pinna\n(2008a) demonstrated that by increasing the number of adjacent contours, (i) the unilateral\nbelongingness of the object becomes stronger, (ii) the modal coloration effect decreases, and\n(iii) the depth segregation and the volumetric effects increase. The amoeboid objects appear\nlike irregular undulated shapes with a 3-D appearance, similar to a high relief, illuminated\nby a bright light. The inner regions can be perceived as bright fuzzy whites, luminous and\nslightly whiter than the white of the backgrounds. Nevertheless, the colors of the whole\nobjects are amodally perceived, respectively, as yellow (Figure 12a) and magenta/fuchsia\n(Figure 12b). Again, even if the modal coloration is almost absent, the amodal one can be\nclearly perceived. A control is shown in Figure 12c.\nTo judge the phenomenal strength of these results, we can try to perceive Figures 12a\u00ad\nb according to the following descriptions, which are alternatives to the previous ones: (i)\ntwo amoeboid objects, yellow and magenta in their periphery and white inside; or (ii) two\namoeboid white objects, yellow and magenta in their periphery; or (iii) two amoeboid\nyellow and magenta objects, white in their center. These descriptions do not say anything\nabout the organization of color, depth, and lighting. Indeed, what emerges are two-tone\nobjects. More particularly, in the first description the colors of the objects are juxtaposed\nand are, respectively, yellow/magenta and white; in the second description, the white is\nthe color of the whole object while the yellow/magenta are colors of a part of each object\n(the periphery); finally, the third description reveals a part-whole organization opposite\nto the second description: the yellow/magenta are colors of the whole objects, while the\nwhite is the color of a part of each object (the center) (see also Pinna 2008a, 2008b). Though\nphenomenally probable, these descriptions are not perceived as strong as the previous ones,\nwhere the inner white of each object appears homogeneous and depending on the different\ndistribution of illumination upon the object based on its 3-D volume.\nThe tendency to perceive a unique color filling in the whole object can be considered as a\nfourth general phenomenal statement. This can be demonstrated again through the a priori\nunlikely perception of the following more and more analytical description, where the local\nconditions are not organized in a whole: two amoeboid shapes, whose boundaries start with\nblack, continue with a short luminance gradient of yellow and magenta, and end with white\nwithin the large inner area of each object. This kind of description does not say anything\nabout the organization of the contours in boundary, color, and depth. Even if phenomenally\nprobable, it belongs to the most unlikely pole of the perceptual gradient (see Pinna 2010b).\nFigure 12. Boundary, color, depth, and lighting attributes obtained with six adjacent contours (for\ndetails see the text).\nThe tendency to perceive a unique color occurs also within the bunch of contours and\nnot only between their color and the inner white. Not all the yellows and the magentas\nare perceived amodally as the color of the whole object but only one of them. This is\nclearly perceived and agrees with the second statement related to the specialization of\nroles. Phenomenally, the boundary contour appears to be followed by a bunch of juxtaposed\ncontours with lower and lower luminance contrast modeling the volume by depicting and\nappearing like shades. We call this \"shading contours\". They precede the color contour\nresponsible for both modal and amodal coloration. The location of the shading contours\nin between boundary and color contour suggests that they are aimed at enhancing the\nboundaries and the shape properties of the object. In other words, they belong to the shape\ndomain, phenomenally different from the color domain.\nThe innermost contour at the extreme of the gradient with the lowest luminance contrast\ndefines the properties of the lighting, its color and intensity, as shown in Figure 12d. We call\nthis \"lighting contour\". The lighting contour is located in between the color contour and the\nbrightest inner homogeneous area of the object. It belongs to the color domain. In other\nwords, even if shading and lighting can be considered as part of the chiaroscuro, they are\nperceived as part of different objects: the shading enhances the unilateral belongingness of\nthe boundaries by depicting its volume, while the lighting contour reveals the light and the\nillumination of the object.\nThe four roles, emerging from the adjacent contours (see also Pinna 2008b, 2008b; Pinna\nand Reeves 2006) under these simple conditions, suggest that most of the information needed\nto define shape, color, depth (volume), and illumination (under the conditions shown here)\nis placed along its boundaries, where the object is segregated from the background. The\nspecialization of roles clearly demonstrates a new kind of perceptual organization of figurality.\nPerceptual organization of shape, color, shade, and lighting 269\nThe juxtaposition of contours reinforces and more strongly demonstrates the organization\nof these attributes but also adds a new property, the lighting, never mentioned by Rubin in\nthese terms.\nNow, if these roles are related to the main object attributes, the previous questions come\nback spontaneously: Does their formation take time to develop? How do they contribute to\ndetermining and defining a visual object, and how do they differ?\n4 Microgenetic development of the object attributes\nThe previous questions, derived from the phenomenal specialized roles of adjacent\ncontours, suggest that a holistic and integrated process like the figure-ground segregation\ncan be segmented and broken up into different and individual attributes likely belonging\nto different neural pathways. These questions imply the idea of a microgenetic process that\nbreaks up the holistic fabric of object perception into variably differentiated yet phenomenal\nmeaningful attributes and relations among them. The term \"genetic\" refers here to the\ndevelopmental dynamics of a psychological process (or \"mental process\"), not to a genome\nor to an adjectival use of the metaphor \"genetic program\".\nBy breaking up the continuous fabric of attributes, a microgenetic viewpoint invokes\ngenetic precedence of continuum over discrete attributes and, at the same time, suggests\ntheir organization into specific forms on the basis of specific principles. The phenomenal\nprecedence of continuum over discrete structures runs parallel and is accompanied by its\nopposite--ie, the phenomenal presence of discrete attributes forming the continuum of the\nperceived object. This statement of the problem goes beyond the idea of a reconstruction\nfrom elementary features because it embraces continuum and discrete, global and local,\nwhole and parts, and object and attributes. These contraries are thus two ways of seeing the\nsame thing. In this sense the answers to the previous questions suggest also a macrogenetic\nprocess--namely, the sudden integration of attributes producing a clear phenomenal\nvariation in the structure of the object formation.\nAll the figures here considered cannot answer directly the previous questions, but the\ndevelopmental dynamics of the process of formation and integration of attributes can mark\nout the way. We suggest that the visual organization of object attributes can be understood\nby studying how children of different ages and visual artists use these attributes to create\nobjects and scenes. This implies that the way children, people, and artists paint is related to\nor is a reflex of the way people normally perceive and, thus, organize these attributes.\nMicrogenesis usually refers to development on a brief, present-time scale of a percept.\nThis defines the occurrence of immediate experience as dynamic and unfolding and as\ndifferentiation in which the final experience is already embodied in the early stages of its\ndevelopment. This idea of microgenesis subsumes a cognitive approach according to which\nany process of perception is primarily a process of differentiation and development, rather\nthan one of detection of a stimulus array or information, organization, and transformation of\nmultiple primitive components. By studying the process of object developmental formation\nand thus by extending the dynamics observed from the few seconds to the minutes or\nhours necessary to create objects, we go beyond this controversy to being able to study both\nperspectives and point of views. The phenomenological and epistemological nature of this\ncontroversy will not be further considered in this work.\n4.1 How do visual artists use figural attributes to create objects and scenes?\nFigure 13a shows Leonardo's drawing (Head of a Girl, 1483) in different moments of the\nprocess of formation of a woman with the main object attributes.\nGoing from the outside to the inside of the figure, the number of object attributes\nincreases more and more. On the right side, the boundaries are drawn as first and outline\nFigure 13. Organization of figural attributes used by artists in sequential order to create objects and\nscenes. Going from the outside to the inside of the figure, the boundary contours represent the first\nproperty segregating unilaterally a figure from the background and tracing its shape, then the color\nfills the inner edges, and finally, shading and lighting complete the figurality organization. (For details\nsee the text.)\nthe whole shape, and then parallel oblique segments fill in the hair and part of the body\nof the woman. More internally, the shading models the volume of the face, cheekbones,\nand eyebrows, and finally, white brushstrokes create lighting effects in the upper-left eyelid\nand below the eyes. A similar organization of attributes is shown in Giacometti's (Portrait of\nMarguerite Maeght, 1961), Michelangelo's (Madonna and Child, 1525), and Picasso's (Paul as\nThese figures suggest that the way artists paint objects is related to the specialization\nof roles and positions in the watercolor illusion. This idea is corroborated by the fact that\na figure made up of contours can stand alone evocating all the figure-ground attributes as\nsuggested by Rubin. All the more reason boundary and color can stand alone as demonstrated\nin Lichtenstein's (Hopeless, 1963), Japanese (Shangchun, 1024), and Ancient Egyptian (Wall\nPainting in the Tomb of Sennejem, Egypt)artworks of Figures 13e\u00adg. Under these conditions,\nthe boundaries are filled with homogeneous color without any shading and lighting. The\nresults of Figure 13 and, more particularly, those of Figures 13a\u00adc indicate that the boundary\ncontours represent the first and most important property of a visual object segregating\nunilaterally a figure from the background and tracing its shape, then the color fills the inner\nedges, and finally, shading and lighting complete the figurality organization. These examples\nalso imply that the object attributes are relatively independent.\nA further demonstration of the strong relations between visual organization of figural\nattributes and object formation emerges from the way comics are created and addressed to\nchildren of different ages. In Figures 14a\u00adc, the kind and the number of attributes used in the\ncomic characters are clearly addressed to children older and older.\nAlso, the way shading and lighting are painted supports our hypotheses. In Figures 15a\u00adb,\nthe shading of the Marvel and Etruscan (Paestum wall detail) characters are represented\nwithout the chiaroscuro technique and instead by using mostly contours and surfaces, while\nthe coloration is painted homogeneously. This demonstrates that the shading belongs to the\nPerceptual organization of shape, color, shade, and lighting 271\nFigure 14. Cartoon and comic-book characters. (a) The Flinstones; (b) Tex Willer; (c) Superman.\nboundary domain. It appears, in fact, like boundaries of concave and convex creases and\nfolds outlining the volume of the object.\nFigure 15. Ways of painting shading and lighting.\nThe lighting tends instead to be painted through a different color, usually white and,\nthus, brighter (Figures 15c\u00add, Pablo Picasso, Madame Olga Picasso, 1923 and Edward Hopper,\nMorning Sun, 1952) than the color filling the object, but this is not necessarily true as shown\nin Figures 15e\u00adg (Giorgio de Chirico, Cavalli in riva al mare, 1928; Pablo Picasso, Female Head,\n1902, and Tex Willer comic-book character), where the lighting is chromatically different\nfrom the one of the object. This suggests that lighting belongs to the color domain.\nIn addition, Schiele's paintings (Figures 16a\u00adb, Nude, 1910 and Portrait of Woman with\nOrange Hat, 1910) demonstrate the primacy of the boundary contours, the use of modal\n(very close to the watercolor illusion) and amodal coloration, and the belongingness of the\nlighting (highlights) to the color domain.\nA clear example of amodal coloration is illustrated in Picasso's painting (Figure 16c, Nude\nWoman, 1968), where even if the color does not fill modally the entire inner edge of the\nwoman, amodally it does. Figure 16d shows the primacy of the boundaries even under non-\nfigurative paintings like this Last Judgment (1912) by Kandinsky. The black contours become\nthe boundaries of something not representational. They are something and nothing at the\nsame time. All the other colors fill each something, adding further meaning. Even within a\npainting of Pollock's, the abstract expressionism of colors can very easily reveal boundaries\nof \"something\".\nFigure 16. Examples showing the primacy of the boundary contours.\nFinally, Basquiat's (Untitled, 1982) and Picasso's paintings of Figures 16e\u00adg (Self-portrait,\n1959 and Rooster, 1973) corroborate the idea of specialization of roles of adjacent and close\ncontours in terms of figure attributes as shown in the watercolor illusion and in the horses of\nAll these phenomenal results support the idea of a visual organization of figural attributes,\ntheir independence, the way they contribute to determine and form a visual object, namely\ntheir specialized roles/domains, and finally, how they are bound, namely through a sequential\njuxtaposition of roles structurally and phenomenally not very different from the watercolor\nillusion.\nThe previous paintings demonstrate that these properties are spatially juxtaposed one\nafter the other, but also suggest a possible temporal juxtaposition. Unfortunately, these\nartworks cannot say anything about the sequential order of the attributes and the time\nneeded to create them. This is where the microgenetic process, occurring during the visual\norganization of figural attributes, comes in.\n4.2 How are objects organized in shapes, shades, colors, and lighting during visual and\npictorial reproduction development?\nTo understand the temporal juxtaposition and organization of figural roles, we studied the\npictorial reproduction of several artworks in which these roles are shown very clearly. The\nroles of boundary and color contours are clearly visible by watching children drawing a figure.\nWith a black pastel, they first draw the contours of the object. Then, they use colored contours\nthat fill the inner edges of the figure, following the direction of the boundary contours. In a\nfirst stage (4\u00ad5 years old) the coloration with color contours can get through the boundary\ncontour and sometimes some parts of the figure can remain unfilled. This stage is the first\ncase of amodal wholeness of color. Only in a second stage the action of filling with color\ncontours becomes precise and stops when it meets the barrier of the boundary contours. It is\nworthwhile noticing that, even though drawing skills could be an important influence, it is\nobvious that the boundary contour still plays a primary role.\nPerceptual organization of shape, color, shade, and lighting 273\nThe development of drawing was previously studied by Parsons (1987, 1994) from a\nperspective different from ours and related to aesthetic reactions. Parsons suggested five\nstages of aesthetic development. The first stage, called favoritism, is an immediate enjoyment\nof art without any inquiry. Beauty and realism, in the second stage, describe the appreciation\nof art because of its resemblance to actual beautiful things. Expressiveness, the third stage,\ninvolves a particular interest in the topic and interpretation of art. Style and form, in the\nfourth stage, involve the observer assigning the artwork to its historical and cultural context.\nIn the fifth stage, called autonomy, judgments about art become independent.\nThe pictorial artworks studied here, related to understand the temporal juxtaposition and\norganization of figural roles, were the following. Donaldson's drawing (Joseph Donaldson, Old\nMan, 1973) illustrated in Figure 17a shows contours and lines (see the distinction between\ncontours and lines in Figure 3), intertwined like in a scribble. They appear organized in\nexternal boundaries (the whole shape of the face), internal parts (ear, eye, hair, etc), and\nvolumes (of the nose, cheekbone, jaw, etc) creating a face in profile. This condition induces a\nvisual organization of contours in boundaries, part-whole, depth, and volume. The question\nis: how do children organize and represent these figural attributes during the visual and\npictorial development?\nFigure 17b shows a detail of a painting by Matisse (Nude with Raised Arms, 1923). This\nwork apparently violates the tendency to perceive/create a unique color filling in a whole\nobject, described in section 3.2.2. Nevertheless, under these conditions the multiplicity of\ncolors is related to a multiplicity of different roles: boundary, shade, color, and lighting. In\nother words, those colors can be easily assigned to different roles. The complex chromatic\norganization of roles in this figure suggests the same question previously asked. More\nspecifically, how do colors get organized in figural attributes during the development of\nvisual object representation?\nFigure 17c shows a third condition (Woman with the Hat by Matisse), where the color\norganization of Figure 17b is taken to extremes. Now, the colors lose the figural roles,\nperceived more easily in Figure 17b, and appear like a chaotic chromatic distribution without\nany visual logic. A woman is easily recognized, but it is very difficult or impossible to assign\nfigural roles other than multiple coloration to the colors depicted. They can also be perceived\nparceling out the wholeness of the shape (Pinna 2010c). How do these colors interfere with\nthe whole shape formation of the woman at different ages? In other words, how do colors\ninhibit or oppose the primary role of boundary formation? How does the multiplicity of\ncolors support or oppose the main function of color discussed here, ie, the filling in of the\nfigure delimited by the boundaries?\nA fourth painting, useful to answer our main questions, is illustrated in Figure 17d. It\nshows a painting by Manet (Portrait of Victorine Meurent, 1871), where colors fill amodally\nthe blouse of the woman by shading the crease with a light blue color. They also represent the\nlit up color of the face and the shadow crossing one third of the face and half of the neck. The\nseparation between these two regions contains a physical sharp contour, while the shape\nof the jaw does not show any clear contour. Therefore, the question is: How do children of\ndifferent ages paint the amodal completion of color and the boundary, color, and shadow\norganization?\nLucien Freud's painting (Reflection, 1985), illustrated in Figure 17e, shows deep and\nsharp shading and lighting revealing a face seamed by wrinkles and the body signed by\nmuscles. What is the whole amodal color that completes behind shading and lighting? How\nare boundaries, colors, shading, and lighting, so deeply and sharply represented, perceived\nand painted at different ages?\nFigure 17f represents a control for all the other works described in this section. This\ncontrol is necessary to compare real and artwork conditions and the object attributes, their\norganization and strength. It shows a photographic real woman face in profile with complete\nfigurality attributes and, more particularly, with clear lighting and highlights. The questions\nare the following: Does this photo show the same object attributes as the artwork conditions?\nHow are boundary, color, shade, and lighting attributes of the two conditions represented at\ndifferent ages?\n4.2.1 How do children use figural attributes to create objects?\nEach of the figures of the previous section, described and reproduced freely with colored\npastels by different groups of 12 children from 5 to 18 years old, revealed three main stages in\nthe development of the pictorial representation. These stages that we are going to describe\nbriefly can be considered both as continuous and discontinuous. Nevertheless, we intend\nto go beyond this controversy because our data are not sufficient to discriminate between\nthese theoretical and phenomenal problems. Therefore, by using the term \"stage\" we refer\nto both qualitative and quantitative differences in behavior without taking a stance on the\ncontinuous or on the discontinuous variation.\nFigure 17a was reproduced by children according to the following stages. (i) Up to 6 years\nold the contours of this figure were represented mostly and uniquely as boundary contours.\nTherefore, the inner filling of interwoven contours was absent, discounted, and unnecessary\n(Figure 18a), according to the children's spontaneous descriptions. (ii) Gradually, up to 10\nyears old, the interwoven contours were represented more and more clearly as filling the\ninner edges defined by the sharp boundaries (Figure 18b). The inner contours were used like\ncolors aimed to fill in the face in profile. (iii) The next stage showed the gradual emergence of\nthe contours used as shades to create volume. This stage became a stable way of representing\nchildren drew this figure in between a stage where the contours are used as boundaries\nand colors and a stage where they are used also as shadings. It is worthwhile noticing that\nPerceptual organization of shape, color, shade, and lighting 275\nin the first two stages children drew the figure starting from the external boundaries; then\nthey drew the inner parts of the face (eye, ear, etc). Only in the third stage (18 years old) did\nyoung adults draw the face not necessarily starting from the external boundaries but also\n(though less often) from single components inside the face. In this stage the organization of\nthe contour roles reveals a stronger integration of the figural attributes and a more flexible\nway of drawing the face.\nFigure 18. Free reproduction of Donaldson's drawing by children at different ages.\nThe pictorial representation of the second stimulus (Figure 17b) revealed the following\nstages. (i) Children up to 7 years old painted the boundary contours with the black pastel, and\nthen filled homogeneously the inner edges of the woman. The multicoloration of Figure 17b\nwas totally absent in the reproductions and the colors assumed the unique role of filling in\nthe figure. During this stage colors were not used to depict shading (shadows) and lighting.\nThis phase supports the general tendency to perceive or use a unique color to fill in a whole\nobject both modally and amodally (Figure 19a). (ii) From 7 to 14 years of age, children\nstarted gradually to enter the second stage, where the multicoloration of the stimulus was\nrepresented and used both as coloration and shade/shadow (Figure 19b). Subjects continued,\nthough less and less frequently, to reproduce the stimulus similarly to the first stage until\nthe age of 17 years old, when they started (iii) the third stage during which they used colors\nto represent more realistically shadows and lighting (Figure 19c) as emerged also from the\ndescriptions. During the three stages the temporal representation sequence of the figural\nattributes was the following: black boundaries, color filling in the inner edges, and formation\nof shading/shadows and lighting.\nFigure 19. Free reproduction of Matisse's painting by children at different ages.\nThe extreme chromatic conditions of Figure 17c showed again three developmental\nstages. (i) In the first stage, up to 7 years old, the boundary contours of the whole face and its\ncomponents were drawn with black boundaries. While the face of the woman was filled with\na single homogeneous color, the dress and the hat were painted multicolored (Figure 20a).\n(ii) In the second stage, up to 15 years old, the face was painted multicolored; however, the\nblack boundary contours of the face and its components continued to be drawn (Figure 20b).\nThis suggests that the multicoloration is used like a coloration (with many colors instead\nof one) of the inner edges of the woman outlined by black boundaries. (iii) After this stage,\nalso the boundaries were painted multicolored more and more frequently (Figure 20c),\neven if the tendency to use black contours persists. None of the children belonging to the\nthird stage painted the woman through a juxtaposition of colored patches. Similarly to the\nprevious stimulus, the time sequence of pictorial representation was the formation of black\nboundaries and then their filling in with the multicoloration.\nFigure 20. Free reproduction of Matisse's painting by children at different ages.\nThe reproduction of Figure 17d revealed again three main developmental stages. (i) In\nthe first stage, up to 9 years of age, a black contour delineated the boundaries of the different\ncomponents of the woman. Both the face and the blouse were colored homogeneously\nwith only one color (Figure 21a). The uniqueness of the color completes modally by filling\nthe entire component (face or blouse). The large shadow was never represented. In this\nstage the jaw was always outlined by a black boundary while the shadow was not, even if\nits boundaries are physically much more pronounced. (ii) The chromatic differentiation,\ntraced without boundaries, started to emerge in the second stage at about 10 years of age,\nbut it was sometimes represented as a maquillage, a making-up coloration, or as shading\n(Figure 21b). The coloration of the blouse remained homogeneous until the third stage. (iii)\nThe representation of the shadow across the face, the neck, and the shades within the blouse\nemerged for the first time in 17 years old young adults. Nevertheless, the shades were not\npainted as a chiaroscuro but by using the black pastel that defined the direction and width of\nthe blouse creases (Figure 21c).\nFigure 21. Free reproduction of Manet's painting by children at different ages.\nSimilar results emerged also in the reproduction of Figure 17e. (i) In the first stage, up to\nabout 10 years old, the black boundaries were filled in by a homogeneous yellow that was the\nPerceptual organization of shape, color, shade, and lighting 277\ncolor perceived amodally. All subjects used the same yellow, illustrated in Figure 22a. It is\nworth noticing that the eyes were white, differently from the stimulus. Shading and lighting\nwere not painted at all. (ii) In the second stage the shading depicting wrinkles and muscles\nwere defined only through boundary contours (Figure 22b). This is a clear demonstration\nthat shading belongs to the shape/boundary domain. (iii) Only at the age of 17 years did a\nrepresentation of the shades similar to the chiaroscuro start to be used. In the three stages,\nchildren started painting from the boundary contours, and then filled in the shape with\nhomogeneous color; after that they added the contours/boundaries of the wrinkles and\nmuscles and, finally shaded these boundaries.\nThe results of the control condition, illustrated in Figure 17f, strongly supported those\nof the artwork stimuli. (i) In the first stage, up to 14 years old, children reproduced this face\nin profile firstly using a black pastel to draw the whole face, the jaw, the eye, and the nose,\nand then they filled the face and the hair with only one homogeneous color, pink for the face\nand yellow for the hair. The strong highlights in the forehead, in the nose, lips, and chin were\nnot painted despite their strong physical boundaries. On the contrary, the jaw was clearly\ndefined by a black contour even if its boundaries are physically much weaker than those of\nhighlights (Figure 23a).\nFigure 22. Free reproduction of Lucien Freud's painting by children at different ages.\n(ii) The formation of shading starts the second stage from 14 to 18 years old. In the\nbeginning the shading was similar to boundary contours or stains or spots (Figure 23b).\nLighting and highlights were still absent. This result compared with the one of the shading\ndemonstrates the independence between shading and lighting. (iii) In the third stage, at 18\nyears old, lighting and highlights emerged but without boundary contours, while the jaw was\nalways defined with black boundaries. Similarly to the results of the previous stimuli, the\ntemporal sequence of the pictorial reproduction was the same in all the stages: formation of\nblack boundary contours, inner homogeneous coloration, formation of shading, and, finally,\nformation of lighting and highlights.\nThe results of the pictorial development will be summarized and discussed in the next\nsection.\n5 Discussion and conclusions\nIn the previous sections we showed new visual and artistic examples useful to under-\nstand the general problem of figure-ground segregation and its main attributes: unilateral\nbelongingness of the boundaries, surface color/brightness induction within the boundary\ncontours, and volume/depth emergence. We also introduced a new figural attribute: lighting.\nIt was demonstrated that a single contour is sufficient to segregate two regions into figure\nand background and, as a consequence, into complementary attributes (border ownership,\nFigure 23. Free reproduction of photographic face in profile by children at different ages.\ndepth segregation, and surface color). This is what many artists do when they create their\nwork starting from a contour or when they use only contours.\nIn this work we suggested that the figure-ground segregation problem is related to the\nway the complementary properties are extracted and organized. This entails some questions,\nwhose answers are the main topic of this work: Where are representations of shape, color,\ndepth, and lighting mostly located? Does their formation take time to develop? How do they\ncontribute to determining and defining a visual object, and how do they differ? How do visual\nartists use them to create objects and scenes? Is the way artists use them related to the way\nwe perceive them?\nTo answer these questions, we focused our attention on the watercolor illusion with its\njuxtaposed contours. In fact, in this illusion the contour with the highest luminance contrast\ntends to be perceived as the outermost boundary of the figure, and it is called \"boundary\ncontour\". The bunch of contours with the luminance contrast lower than the boundary\ncontour and juxtaposed to it, model the volume depicting shades. They are called \"shading\ncontours\". The \"color contour\", which defines the color of the whole object, follows the\nshading contours, and is responsible for both modal and amodal coloration. The innermost\ncontour placed at the extreme of the gradient with the lowest luminance contrast defines\nthe properties of the lighting (its color and intensity), and it is called \"lighting contour\" (see\nThe main hypothesis of this work was that the specialization of figural roles of the\njuxtaposed contours in the watercolor illusion is related to the way the figural attributes\nare extracted and organized in human vision. To test this hypothesis, we studied the\nmicrogenetic process that breaks up the holistic fabric of object perception into differentiated\nyet phenomenal figural attributes and relations among them. In other words, to answer the\nprevious questions and to test the main hypothesis, we investigated the developmental\ndynamics of the process of formation and integration of attributes. We assumed that the\nvisual organization of object attributes is related to the way artists and children of different\nages use these attributes to create objects and scenes. This assumption is true also in the\nopposite direction: the way people and artists paint is strongly related to the way people\nnormally perceive and thus organize these attributes.\nThe phenomenal analysis of the watercolor illusion (section 3), of some artworks (see\nsection 4.1), and the results of the development pictorial reproduction task (section 4.2.1)\nsupport this assumption and suggest the following answers to the main questions of this work.\nRubin's figure-ground attributes are clearly related to shape, color, and depth perception.\nThese are, in fact, the three main attributes used by artists and children of different age to\nPerceptual organization of shape, color, shade, and lighting 279\ncreate objects. They do not deplete the set of possible figural attributes. In fact, lighting (and\nhighlights) completes this set, as suggested also by some variations of the watercolor illusion.\nFurthermore, most of the information about the four figural attributes is located on\nthe external bonds and limits (edges) of a figure, thin like the juxtaposed contours of the\nwatercolor illusion, where the object segregates from the background. The figural attributes\nare relatively independent as clearly demonstrated by the watercolor illusion and by the\ntemporal sequence of their occurrence during the pictorial reproduction made by each child\nand during the pictorial development at different ages. The temporal and developmental\nresults demonstrated the following sequence and order among the figural attributes in\ncreating a visual object: boundary contours, color, shading, and lighting. These sequence\nand order are marked by short and large lapses of time. The lapse from the use of color to the\nuse of shadings and lighting requires much more time than the lapse from the boundaries to\nthe color. Further studies are required to define more quantitatively the exact time structure\nof the stages here suggested.\nThis temporal sequence apparently disagrees with the one emerged from the watercolor\nillusion: boundary, shade, color, and lighting. This difference can be attributed to the fact\nthat in the watercolor illusion the sequence is mostly spatial and not temporal. In fact, as\nwe suggested several times in this work, boundary and shade belong to the shape domain,\nwhile color and lighting to the color domain. In this sense, it can be expected that the\nspatial organization of the sequence of attributes in the watercolor illusion is different from\nthe temporal one. Temporally, it can be more important to extract and create information\nbelonging to boundary and color, firstly, because these two attributes belong to different\ndomains, and secondly, because they are more and differently informative for a visual system.\nThis hypothesis suggests that the figural attributes are hierarchically organized in terms of\nvisual importance, ie, by contributing with a different weight and meaning to the organization\nof visual objects. As a matter of fact, shape defined by boundary contours is more important\nfor visual organisms in terms of adaptive fitness than are color, shading, and lighting. In fact, it\nwarns the presence of an object. The primacy of the boundary contours is also phenomenally\nrelated to the fact that contours alone can signal information also about surface color and\ndepth as proposed by Rubin. Once the presence of an object is coded, color adds further\nimportant but secondary visual properties. It favors the presence, identification, and salience\nof objects as a cue for species, sex, fruit, identification and so on. The information, provided\nby shading and lighting, gives further support to the one of shape and color, but signal\nproperties noninvariant in the same way as shape and color.\nThe specialization and spatial/temporal sequence and organization of figural attributes\ncan be related to recent studies demonstrating that neurons in V2 respond differently to\nthe same contrast border, on the basis of the side of the figure to which the border belongs\ncorrelates of the unilateral belongingness of the boundaries. Other attributes of the figure-\nground segregation are likely processed in areas V1 and V2 (Friedman et al 2003; von\nder Heydt et al 2003; Zhou et al 2000), in inferotemporal cortex of monkeys (Baylis and\nDriver 2001) and the human lateral occipital cortex (Kourtzi and Kanwisher 2001). This\nfinding can be related to the chromatic/brightness complementation between figure and\nbackground (see also von der Heydt and Pearson 2006 about the watercolor illusion). The idea\nof specialized roles of the figural attributes and the phenomenal logic of their organization\ngo beyond previous works and can shed light on the understanding of how neurons become\nmore and more specialized by firing only for one figural attribute and how they are then\nintegrated after a level of juxtaposition of attributes.\nIn conclusion, the answers to the main questions of this work can represent the starting\npoints to explore a new domain focused on the microgenetic development of the figural\nattributes within the more general problem of object organization. Integrated and multi-\ndisciplinary studies, based on art and vision science, and visual/pictorial development, are\ndesirable because they can strongly contribute to a full understanding (even in terms of\nneural circuitry) of the basic and common problem of perceptual organization of shape,\ncolor, shade, and lighting.\n"
