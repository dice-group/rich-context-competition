According to data presented in\nthe 1994 surgeon general's report, young\nwhites are more than twice as likely to report\nsmoking in the previous month than young\nblacks. Although smoking rates among young\nwomen were higher than young men during the\n1980s, this trend has reversed itself in the\n1990s, with more young men reporting that\nthey currently smoke than young women.1\nAlthough the diVerences in smoking rates are\nwell documented, little research has been done\nto help explain why these diVerences exist or\nwhether they persist over time.\nAn examination of historical trends in smok-\ning rates among a nationally representative\nsample of high-school seniors (aged 13\u00ad18\nyears) reveal that the diVerences we see today\nin smoking rates have not persisted. Figure 1\nshows 30-day smoking prevalence among\nhigh-school seniors by sex and race from 1975\nto 1997. Although smoking prevalence among\nsmoking rates move in very diVerent directions\nthroughout the 1980s. Smoking prevalence\namong young blacks continued to decrease\nthroughout the 1980s. Similarly smoking rates\namong young women fell throughout the\n1980s, but the declines are not nearly as large\nas those observed among young blacks. Smok-\ning rates in young men and young whites, how-\never, levelled oV in the early 1980s and started\nto climb slowly throughout the 1980s. Interest-\nlel movement in the smoking rates of these four\ngroups, but now smoking rates among young\nmen are higher than smoking rates among\nyoung women.\nWhat caused these dramatic diVerences in\nsmoking rates during the 1980s? One possible\nexplanation is that there was a large change in\na significant predictor of young people's smok-\ning during this time period that influenced\nthese four groups diVerently. For example,\na pack of 20 cigarettes rose from a 25-year low\nFigure 1 Thirty-day smoking prevalence among high-school seniors.

We find that significant diVerences do\nexist, by sex and by race. For example, young\nmen are much more responsive to changes in\nthe price of cigarettes than young women; the\nprevalence elasticity for young men is almost\ntwice as large as that for young women.\nFurther, we find that smoking rates of young\nblack men are significantly more responsive to\nchanges in price than those for young white\nmen. We also find that there are significant dif-\nferences in young people's responsiveness to\ntobacco control initiatives by race. Smoking\nrates among young whites are much more\nresponsive than among young blacks to\nanti-tobacco activities and clean indoor air\nrestrictions. Smoking rates among young\nblacks, on the other hand, are significantly\ninfluenced by smoker protection laws and\nrestrictions on youth access, whereas smoking\nrates among young whites are not.\nMethods\nData on young people's smoking prevalence\nFuture surveys of eighth grade (ages 13\u00ad14\ngrade (17\u00ad18 years) students living in the con-\ntiguous United States conducted by the\nInstitute for Social Research (ISR) at the Uni-\nversity of Michigan. Every year since 1975, the\nISR has collected data on tobacco, alcohol, and\nother drug use from a nationally representative\nseniors. In 1991, comparable surveys of eighth\nand 10th grade students were added. The sur-\nvey is conducted in school and addresses young\npeople's attitudes, perceptions, and use of legal\nand illicit drugs. Given the sensitive nature of\nthe subject matter, great care is taken to ensure\nreliable and valid responses. For example, par-\nents are not informed of their child's responses.\nFrom responses to these surveys, a dichoto-\nmous indicator of smoking prevalence is\nconstructed that is set equal to one for young\npeople reporting any cigarette consumption in\nthe previous 30 days and zero otherwise. In\naddition, various other socioeconomic and\ndemographic variables can be constructed\nfrom the general background data that are col-\nlected. Variables used in this analysis include:\nsex (male or female), race (white, black, and\nother race), age, average weekly income from\nall sources (employment, allowances, and\nother), current grade (eighth, 10th, or 12th),\nmarital status (married/engaged or single),\nparental education (less than high-school\ngraduate, high-school graduate, more than\nhigh-school graduate), family structure (live\nalone, only mother present, only father present,\nboth parents present, live with other(s)), moth-\ner's work status while the child was growing up\n(not employed, employed part-time, employed\nfulltime), existence of siblings, average number\nof hours worked weekly, living in rural/urban\narea, and frequency of participation in\nreligious services (no participation, infrequent\nparticipation, and frequent participation). Year\ndummy variables are also included for 1992\nand 1993 to control for diVerences in smoking\nrates across time.\nBased on each person's county of residence,\nmeasures of cigarette price and state and local\ntobacco control policies are added to the survey\ndata. The cigarette price measure reflects the\naverage state-level price for a pack of 20\ncigarettes and is taken from the Tobacco\nInstitute's annual The tax burden on tobacco.4 It is\na weighted average of the prices of single packs,\ncartons, and vending machine sales and includes\nstate-level excise taxes and the price of generics.\nTo capture potential cross-border shopping for\ncigarettes that, if excluded, may bias estimates of\nprice towards zero, an additional variable repre-\nsenting the largest price diVerence between the\nperson's state of residence and states within 25\nmiles of the person's county of residence is also\nincluded. This variable is set equal to zero for\nthose young people who live in states with lower\nprices than nearby states and for young people\nwho live in counties more than 25 miles from\nanother state.\nFour variables capturing state and local\ntobacco policies are also merged into the data.\nThe first is a dummy variable set equal to one\nin those states that earmark a portion of\ncigarette tax revenues for anti-tobacco\nactivities and zero otherwise. Those states that\nset aside these funds are generally believed to\nbe more aggressive in discouraging smoking.\nThe second is another dummy variable set\nequal to one in those states that have some\nform of smoker protection legislation and\nequal to zero otherwise. These laws typically\nprotect smokers from discrimination in the\nworkplace and elsewhere and may reflect a\ngreater \"pro-smoking\" sentiment in the states\nthat have them.\nThe final two variables are indices of clean\nindoor air restrictions and youth access laws\npassed at the state and local level. The index of\nclean indoor air restrictions represents the sum\nof five independent variables capturing the\nfraction of the population in the person's\ncounty of residence subject to state or local\nrestrictions on smoking in private work sites,\nrestaurants, retail stores, schools, and other\npublic places.\nThe index of youth access is constructed\nsimilarly by summing five diVerent variables\ncapturing diVerent aspects of youth access.\nThe first two variables included in this index\nare dummy variables set equal to one if the\nstate has a minimum legal purchase age of at\nleast 18 and if the state requires point-of-sale\nsignage stating the minimum legal purchase\nage. Two other variables included in this index\nrepresent the fraction of the county population\nin the person's county of residence that is sub-\ngroup.bmj.com\ntobaccocontrol.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nject to restrictions on vending machine sales\nand distribution of free samples. The last vari-\nable included in this index represents the frac-\ntion of the county population who are living in\nareas where vendors are required to have a\nlicence to sell tobacco products.\nThe data on state-level policies were taken\nfrom the Coalition on Smoking OR Health's\n(CSH) annual State legislated actions on tobacco\nissues.5 Similar information on county and city-\nlevel restrictions was obtained from the\nNational Cancer Institute's monograph\nsummarising major local control policies,\nupdated with information from CSH.6\nDescriptive statistics for the variables of\ninterest by sex and race are provided in table 1.\nAs has been found in other surveys, smoking\nrates among young blacks (8.0%) are\nsignificantly lower than those of young whites\n(25.6%) in our sample. There is no significant\ndiVerence in smoking prevalence by sex,\nhowever. Approximately 23% of young men\nand young women report currently smoking.\nOnly a few of the policy variables diVer across\nthe groups. On average, fewer young blacks are\nfound in states that pass smoker protection\nlaws. Similarly, fewer black youths live in states\nwith tougher restrictions on smoking in public\nplaces.\nResults\nUsing as controls the variables described\nabove, the probability of smoking in the previ-\nous 30 days was estimated for young men,\nyoung women, young blacks, young whites,\nyoung black men, young white men, young\nblack women, and young white women using\nseparate probit maximum likelihood specifica-\ntions. Each specification includes a measure of\nthe price of cigarettes along with the\nborder-purchase variable. However, as the\ntobacco control policies are highly correlated,\nonly one policy variable could be included in\nthe regression equation at a time. We therefore\nestimated each of the eight sex/race specific\nspecifications five separate times, once with\njust the price included and four times with\nprice and a diVerent tobacco control policy. As\nmost of the policy variables are measured at the\nstate level, standard errors are corrected for\ncorrelation created by having multiple\nobservations within a single state using the\ncluster option in STATA 5.0. Although similar\nmodels were run using daily smoking instead of\n30-day prevalence, these results are not\npresented. Models of daily smoking could only\nbe estimated for some of the subpopulations\ndue to a small number of observations (for\nexample, only 387 young blacks in the sample\nare daily smokers). The results for daily smok-\ning in those subpopulations we were able to\nestimate are consistent with the findings\npresented here for 30-day prevalence. The only\nnotable diVerence is that the eVects of price are\nlarger for daily smoking than for past-month\nsmoking.\nTable 2 reports the marginal eVects obtained\nfrom each of these separate regressions for the\nkey policy variables, and table 3 summarises\nthe main findings. In table 3, a dash indicates\nthat the marginal eVect of the variable on the\nprobability of smoking was negative while the\nplus sign indicates that the marginal eVect of\nthe variable was positive. The average price\nelasticity resulting from the five diVerent policy\nspecifications of the models is reported in the\nfinal column. Although earmarking of state\ncigarette tax revenue to promote anti-tobacco\nactivities has a negative and significant eVect\non smoking prevalence for young men and\nwomen, it is only smoking by young whites that\nis aVected by this policy. State earmarking has\nno significant eVect in any of the model speci-\nfications run separately for black youths.\nSmoker protection laws, on the other hand,\nhave the largest positive eVect on smoking rates\nby young blacks, and in particular young black\nmales. Smoking prevalence of young whites,\nmale and female, is not aVected by the\nexistence of smoker protection laws. Clean\nindoor air laws significantly decrease smoking\nprevalence among young white males, but have\nno significant eVect on any of the other groups\nof adolescents. Stricter youth access laws, on\nthe other hand, significantly decrease smoking\nrates among young black males and females\nbut have no significant eVect on the smoking\nprevalence of young whites.\nEconomists use the price elasticity of\ndemand as a way of measuring the responsive-\nness of the demand for a commodity to\nchanges in the price of that commodity. It is\nmeasured as the per cent change in the\nquantity of the product demanded, or in this\ncase the percent change in the probability of\nsmoking cigarettes, given a 1% increase in the\ncommodity's price, or\nd\n= % Q / % P. When\na change in the probability of using a product is\nexamined instead of the actual quantity\ndemanded, we refer to this as a prevalence\nelasticity. A value greater than one in absolute\nvalue indicates that the change in the probabil-\nity of smoking is greater in percentage terms\nthan the change in the price of the commodity,\nand we say that consumption is very responsive\nto changes in price. A value less than one in\nabsolute terms would indicate that the change\nin the probability of smoking was smaller in\nMales Females Whites Blacks\nYoung people's responsiveness to price and tobacco control policies 375\ngroup.bmj.com\ntobaccocontrol.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\npercentage terms than the change in price,\nmeaning that consumption is relatively less\nresponsive to price.\nLooking at the average price elasticities\nreported in the final column of table 2 we see\nthat smoking prevalence among young men is\nmuch more sensitive to changes in price than\nsmoking prevalence by young women,\nregardless of race. Smoking by young black\nmen is the most price sensitive; a 10% increase\nin the price of cigarettes is estimated to result\nin a 16.5% decrease in smoking prevalence\namong young black men, holding everything\nelse constant. The same price increase would\nresult in a reduction in smoking prevalence of\n8.6% among young white men. Smoking\nprevalence among women is less responsive to\nprice than it is among young men. While statis-\ntically significant eVects of price are found for\nyoung white women, in most of the models, the\nprice of cigarettes had no significant eVect on\nthe probability of smoking for young black\nfemales.\nDiscussion\nIt should be kept in mind when interpreting\nthese findings that most of the tobacco control\npolicies included in this analysis only measure\nthe existence of a policy and not its actual\nenforcement. There is considerable evidence in\nthe recent literature suggesting that it is the\nenforcement of these policies and not the poli-\ncies themselves that change behaviour.3 7 8 This\nsuggests that one interpretation of the findings\npresented here is that particular tobacco\ncontrol policies are enforced diVerentially in a\nmanner that is somehow correlated with sex\nand race. Such an interpretation cannot be\nruled out without detailed information on the\nTable 2 Predicted change in the probability of smoking\nSingle policy models--sex diVerences\nPolicy Price Policy Price\nSingle policy models--race diVerences\nPolicy Price Policy Price\nSingle policy models--men only\nPolicy Price Policy Price\nSingle policy models--women only\nPolicy Price Policy Price\nz-Scores are in parentheses. Each row represents a diVerent specification which, in addition to price and the tobacco-related policy\nnoted in the row, includes an intercept, indicators of race, age, religiosity, rural residence, family structure, parental education,\nmaternal work status, grade, year, average hours worked, and real income. Standard errors were adjusted for clustering at the state\nlevel.\nTable 3 Summary of findings by race and sex\nDemographic\ngroup\nEarmarking of\ntax revenue\nSmoker\nprotection laws\nClean indoor\nair laws\nYouth\naccess laws\nAverage price\nelasticity\n(across all models)\nAll probit regressions included controls for age, average weekly income, current grade, marital\nstatus, parental education, family structure, mother's work status while the child was growing up,\nexistence of siblings, average number of hours worked weekly, living in rural area, and frequency\nof participation in religious services in addition to race and sex when appropriate.\n***Significance at the 1% level (two-tailed test); **5% level (two-tailed test); *10% level\n(two-tailed test); a10% level (one-tailed test).\ngroup.bmj.com\ntobaccocontrol.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nenforcement activities surrounding each of the\npolicies. However, the most consistently\nsignificant policy variable is the price of\ncigarettes, which is not a function of\nenforcement. Higher prices have a negative and\nsignificant eVect on smoking prevalence for all\nof the groups examined, except for young black\nwomen, but even here there is significant varia-\ntion in the responsiveness by subpopulation. It\nis possible that some of this variation may be\ndue to correlation with unobserved factors that\nhave not been adequately controlled for in our\nmodels, such as socioeconomic status. The\nmodels do include controls for parental educa-\ntion, mother's working status, and the\nindividual's weekly income, but no clean meas-\nure of family income or wealth is available from\nthe data. However, findings from another\nnationally representative study of young adults\n(ages 18\u00ad25) show similar diVerences in price\nresponsiveness by sex and ethnicity, and this\nstudy does include more comprehensive meas-\nures of income.9\nTo what extent do the observed diVerences\nin price sensitivity explain the divergence in\nsmoking trends that were observed in the\n1980s? Assuming that young people's smoking\nprevalence elasticities are fairly constant over\ntime, it is possible to use the elasticities\nreported in table 3 to predict the change in\nsmoking prevalence expected given the 63%\nincrease in real price that occurred from 1981\npredicted change in smoking prevalence for the\nfour basic subgroups represented in the figure.\nIt is clear from the diVerences in predicted and\nactual values that the change in price alone\ndoes not adequately explain the actual patterns\nof smoking prevalence for all of the subgroups.\nGiven the elasticities calculated in table 3 and\nthe enormous change in price during the\n1980s, we would have expected to see smoking\nrates among all four groups decline, with\nsmoking among black youths falling the most\nand smoking rates among young women falling\nthe least. Although smoking rates among\nyoung blacks did experience the largest decline\nduring the 1980s, the decline was not nearly as\nlarge as our model predicts. The same is true\nfor young women. Smoking rates among young\nmen and young whites actually rose during the\nperiod, however, contrary to what our model\npredicts.\nThe poor performance of our model at\nexplaining the shifts in smoking prevalence in\nthese population subgroups during the 1980s\nis not that surprising as it assumes that\neverything else that may influence young\npeople's smoking is held constant throughout\nthe period. This was certainly not the case. For\nexample, at the same time that the tobacco\nindustry started raising the price of cigarettes,\nit dramatically increased its spending on adver-\ntotal advertising and promotional expenditures\nfor the industry nearly tripled.1 This increase in\nadvertising and promotion is not accounted for\nin our analysis and may be oVsetting the eVect\nof price on smoking rates. To the extent that\nadvertising and promotional activities target\nspecific subgroups more than others, and to\nthe extent that some young populations may be\nmore responsive to these activities, this\nincrease in tobacco industry marketing expen-\nditures is likely to influence young people's\nsmoking rates diVerently as well. There may be\nother missing determinants as well.\nEven with these shortcomings, it is clear\nfrom this analysis that diVerent youths respond\ndiVerently to changes in price and public poli-\ncies. Significant diVerences exist by sex and\nrace, suggesting that public health profession-\nals and policymakers need to keep in mind who\ntheir target user is when determining policy.\nThere is clearly not a \"one size fits all\" strategy\nfor discouraging young people's smoking.\nThis research was supported by a grant from the US Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention and the Robert Wood Johnson\nFoundation.
