Popkin*\nDepartment of Nutrition, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599\n Introduction\nObesity among U.S. adults has increased markedly over the past\ndietary factors, including intake of energy beverages, away from\nhome eating, portion sizing, and snacking have been related to the\nexcess of energy intake and obesity at different life stages (2\u00ad18).\nMeal and snack patterns, including the frequency of daily eat-\ning occasions, are suspected to affect health outcomes, including\ncardiovascular disease and glucose intolerance (19,20). However,\nthe contribution of meal frequency and snacking to overeating and\nbody weight remains unclear. Many studies in adults of all age\ngroups have reported higher values of BMI related to lower eating\ndefined as eating occasions different from main meals (breakfast,\nlunch, dinner/supper), has been commonly regarded as contrib-\nuting to excess weight (26,27). Late night eating, greater intake of\nenergy-dense salty snacks and energy beverages, or increased\nportion sizes of snacks are among other behaviors noted (28\u00ad32).\nOther studies on snacking related to BMI have shown inconsistent\nresults (21,33,34). These inconsistencies may be due to under-\nreporting (35) of energy-dense snack and dessert-type foods\n(36,37), especially among obese people. Recent research among\nadults has found a higher BMI is associated with a higher total\ndaily energy intake and a higher energy intake at all eating oc-\ncasions (38). Moreover, energy intake has been found to increase\nwith snacking frequency in both males and females, irrespective of\nphysical activity. This increase is markedly higher in obese\nindividuals (26). According to these results, increased snacking\nmay be associated with a greater risk of energy imbalance and\nincreased overweight and obesity.\nPrevious studies among young adults and children reported\nlarge increases in snacking frequency and higher contribution of\nAmong U.S. adults, only 1 paper examined this topic and did not\nfind large increases in eating frequency or snacking from 1971 to\n2002 (39). This previous study used very precise food- and meal-\nbased measures of snacking and adjusted as much as possible for\nsome measurement differences by linking foods and food com-\nposition tables over the full period studied. We examined sys-\ntematically overall patterns of snacking, shifts in energy intake\nfrom snacking, snacking occasions, and energy intake per snacking\nevent. We also examined the shifts in snacking food and beverage\nsources, in addition to the overall trends of the energy density of\nsnacks and meals.\nParticipants and Methods\nSurvey design and sample.

From the NHANES, there were 9490 respondents\na multistage, stratified area probability sample of noninstitutionalized\nU.S. households. Detailed information about each survey and its\nsampling design has been published previously (40\u00ad44). The major\ndifference is that although the NHANES sampling system is nationally\nrepresentative, it does not represent each region by season and is\nnot randomly distributed over the days of the week as the earlier\nUSDA surveys were (45). By utilizing secondary USDA and NHANES\ndata, we were exempt from institutional review board concerns for this\npaper.\nDietary data. All dietary survey data utilized a comparable food\ncomposition table and collection methods developed by the USDA. The\nNFCS 77 and CSFII 89 surveys contain information on dietary intake\nthat was collected over 3 consecutive days using a single interviewer-\nadministered 24-h recall followed by a self-administered 2-d food record.\nDietary data from NFCS 77 and CSFII 89 surveys consisted of all foods\neaten at home and away from home during the previous day (24-h recall)\nand the records of the foods eaten on the day of the interview and the\ncollected interviewer-administered 24-h recalls on 2 nonconsecutive days\ndietary methodology into the NHANES system) included 2 nonconsec-\nutive days of 24-h dietary recall data. The d 1 interview is conducted by\ntrained dietary interviewers in the Mobile Examination Center and the\nd 2 interview is collected by telephone 3\u00ad10 d following the Mobile\nExamination Center interview. For NHANES 03\u00ad06, the USDA's\nAutomated Multiple Pass Method, a 5-step computerized dietary recall\ninstrument, was used for collecting 24-h dietary recalls, either in person\nor by telephone. For our purpose of studying snacking behavior over\ntime, the first 2 d of dietary intake from each survey have been included\nin this analysis to provide fairly comparable measurement periods and\nprotocols. In the cases where either d 1 or 2 results were not obtained, the\nindividuals with only the other day were included.\nSnack vs. meal definitions. The USDA and NHANES surveys\ncollected information on eating occasions, such as snacks and meals.\nEach eating occasion was determined by the respondent in each survey.\nRespondents were asked to name the type of each eating occasion. The\ntime when the eating or drinking event began was recorded for each food\nor beverage. The snack category included those eating occasions defined\nby the respondent as \"snack,\" plus the occasions related to snacking,\nsuch as food and/or coffee/beverage breaks. Meals were defined by the\nrespondent as breakfast/brunch, lunch, and dinner/supper. People often\nconsume more than 1 food item when having a snack. Therefore, we\ncombined all snack foods consumed within 15 min of each other as a\nsingle snacking occasion. To determine whether participants were\nsnackers or not, we classified them as snackers if they snacked on any\nday of intake. For those individuals who snacked on d 1 and 2, we\ncomputed the contribution of snacking for each day and then averaged\nthese contributions. Also, some people defined foods eaten at the same\ntime as both snack and meal. We changed them all to meal if any were\ndefined as a snack, as in all cases most of the foods were identified as 1 of\n3 meals (e.g. eating chips with a lunch). In NCFS 77, CSFII 89, and CSFII\n96, we found eating occasions defined as \"other\" or \"no answer.\" If a\nperson did not have 3 meals, the missing values were recoded as meals\naccording to the eating time. The remaining eating occasions were\nassigned to meals if the person did not eat 3 meals. Finally, the remaining\nmissing eating occasions were considered as snacks. In summary, we\nhave set 3 principal meals, if possible, and then we have studied the\nsnacking behavior outside them in all the years surveyed.\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill food grouping\nsystem. To determine those food items contributing to energy intake,\nthe University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) food\ngrouping system was used. This food grouping system links all foods\nfrom 1965 to the present. Comparable food composition Latin names\nand nutrient compositions are used to link the same foods in each food\ngroup over time. All the foods reported in the USDA surveys were\nassigned to the 107 UNC-CH food groups. First, we assigned the major\nfood groupings designated by the USDA and then further classified them\naccording to fat and fiber content. The UNC-CH food grouping system\nhas been previously described (46). For all individuals, the amount of\nsnacking energy provided by each UNC-CH food group was calculated\nand then divided by the total energy from snacking of all individuals.\nThose food groups contributing the most to snacking energy intake are\nreported. Diet soft drinks and sweetened or unsweetened coffee/tea were\nexcluded as snacks from analysis of shifts in energy in the food group\nanalysis. These food items accounted for a very low percent of energy of\nthe total snacking daily energy.\nWater as a beverage was collected differently across the surveys.\nBecause plain water was added as a food item in 2003, we determined\nthat water accounted for up to 5% of all the reported foods in 2003\u00ad\n2006 compared to 0% in all the other previous surveys. Water was\ndeleted as a food item in all the years studied.\nStatistical analysis. Data are presented as means 6 SE. Snacking trends\nold, and 60 y and older. We used survey commands to account for survey\ndesign, weighting, and clustering (47,48). The proportion of adults (19 y\nand older) consuming 0\u00ad2 snacks/d, 3\u00ad5 snacks/d, and .6 snacks/d\nwithin each sociodemographic characteristic and classified by BMI was\ndetermined in NHANES 03\u00ad06. The proportion of snackers within each\nage group by key sociodemographic groups was also determined in\nNHANES 03\u00ad06 but varied little between all subpopulations (Supple-\nmental Table 1). For each survey year, the percentage of individuals who\nreported snacking on d 1, 2, or both was determined. For snackers, we\ncomputed each survey year by age group. We used both the mean\nnumber of snacking occasions per day, mean energy intake (kJ and kcal),\nand g consumed per snacking occasion for this computation. The\ncontribution of snacking to total energy intake was also determined. The\nenergy density of snacks (food and beverages or both) and meals (food\nand beverages or both) was calculated dividing the total energetic\ncontent of each category by the total amount of g consumed from them.\nDifferences testing, by a Student's t test, used STATA, version 10 (47), to\nweight the results and control SE for sample design effects. A P-value #\n0.01 was considered significant.\nResults\nProportion of adults by snacking groups. Some sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics were related to a higher snacking habit\ndefined in terms of number of daily snacking events (Table 1).\nMales, non-Hispanic Whites, and people with higher income\nlevel and education were mainly included in the group with 3\u00ad5\nsnacks/d (P , 0.01). Other descriptive characteristics such as\nBMI classified a higher proportion of normal and obese individ-\nuals in the group of 3\u00ad5 snacks/d, although these proportions did\nnot differ from the group of 0\u00ad2 snacks/d.\nDynamic increases in snacking behavior. The prevalence of\nsnackers over a 2-d period increased over all adults ($19 y) from\n2, or both) (Fig. 1). For the same period and age group, the\npercentage of snacking on both d 1 and d 2 increased from 42 to\n78% (data not shown).\n4 Abbreviations used: CSFII, Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals;\nNFCS, Nationwide Food Consumption Survey; UNC-CH, University of North\nCarolina at Chapel Hill.\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nBehavioral changes in snacking habits.

Table 3 presents the\nenergy density of snacks and meals (foods, beverages, and both\ncombined) in adults. Over the time period studied, we found a\nsignificant increasing trend for total snacking (food plus bever-\nages) in all the age groups studied. The energy density of\nsnacking beverages also increased in all the adults aged .19 y.\nMeals food also showed a significant increasing trend in all the\nadults for the studied periods.\nThe top 5 sources of energy were desserts, salty snacks, other\nsnacks, sweetened beverages, and juices/fruit (Fig. 3). The major\nand high-fat salty snacks, with small increases also in candies,\nnuts/seeds, alcoholic beverages, fruit drinks, and sport drinks.\nWe found decreases for overall desserts (although low-fat\ndesserts increased), milk/dairy, and juices/fruit.\nDiscussion\nOver the past 2 decades, U.S. adults have steadily increased the\nnumber of daily snacking occasions. The percentage of energy\nintake from snacking occasions has increased to 24%. Interest-\ningly, our results show significant shifts in snacking between the\ndecade. Not only do we find major increases in snacking\nbehavior, but food sources of snacks have changed. Major shifts\ntoward increased intake of salty snacks, chips, and nuts have\noccurred along with smaller shifts toward reduced amounts of\ndesserts, dairy products, and fruit.\nSnacking occasions and snacking foods for this study are\nbased on a definition that focuses on self-selected snacking\nevents but removes as snacks the foods that were eaten at meals.\nWe also utilize food groups based on foods that are linked over\ntime so the same foods are in the same food groups (48).\nNevertheless, we differ from other scholars. For example, one\nrecent study reported across the 4 NHANES surveys [I (1971\u00ad\ndecline in snacking prevalence (39). That we used only surveys\nwith 2 d of dietary data may have been one reason for the\ndifferent interpretation. Another may be our exclusion of snack\nfoods such as chips consumed at a meal. NHANES collected\nonly 1 d of dietary intake data before the integration in 2003\nwith the USDA and a combination of 1 d of direct face-to-face\nrecall with a subsequent telephone interview. Other earlier\nresearch, with slightly less restrictive definitions of snacking\nevents, found increased snacking patterns and a higher contri-\nTABLE 1 Proportion of adults ($19 y) over a 2-d period by\nsociodemographic characteristics in the NHANES,\nSample characteristics\nSnacks/d\n%\nEthnicity3\nIncome level4\nHousehold's education\nBMI\n1 Data are weighted to account for survey design effects and to be nationally\nrepresentative. aDifferent from 0\u00ad2 snacks/d, P , 0.01; bdifferent from 3\u00ad5 snacks/d,\n2 The proportion of snackers over a 2-d period by sociodemographic characteristics in\n3 Mexican American and Other Hispanic were included in the Hispanic group.\n4 To more accurately represent income level, household income is expressed as a\npercentage of the federal poverty thresholds adjusted for inflation.

Our study, consistent\nwith this last approach, states that the young adults (19\u00ad39 y\nTABLE 2 Number of snacks consumed per day and amount and energy consumed per snacking\nsurveys by age group1\nEnergy per snack\nSnack size\nTotal energy from snacking\nEnergy per snack\nSnack size\nTotal energy from snacking\nEnergy per snack\nSnack size\nTotal energy from snacking\nEnergy per snack\nSnack size\nTotal energy from snacking\n1 All estimates are mean 6 SE.

Our findings are\nconsistent with others that reported increased portion sizes in\nU.S. surveys (13,14). Higher portion sizes might be linked to\nincreased energy intake (51,52). Another component of possible\nsources of increased energy intake (along with number of\noccasions and portion sizes) is energy density, defined as the\nenergy content per g of the eating event (snack or meal) that\nincludes beverages, foods, and both combined (53\u00ad55). This\nstudy shows important trends toward higher energy density of\nsnacks (meals plus beverages) and meals food over the 1977\u00ad\nThere are limitations to our analysis of snacking trends.\nDifferent methodologies were used in the dietary surveys,\nchanges have been much smaller. To capture more accurately the\ntotal diet, both USDA and NHANES, and later the combined\nthrough the day with repeated queries on what has been eaten in\nthe 1990s.

Furthermore, the consequences of these methodo-\nlogical changes have not been measured with a bridging study as\n(56). Also, for NHANES in particular, different nutrient\ndatabases have been used for each survey. For both, shifts in\nthe measurement and accuracy of data for foods and the changes\nin the food supply could affect the composition of these nutrient\ndatabases. We addressed these food composition table concerns\nby using the system developed by this UNC team. This allowed\nus to link food coded and collected in the last survey with foods\nconsumed by respondents in earlier surveys and ensure consis-\ntently high-quality estimates of nutrient values over time (57).\nThere were also a different number of days of data collection in\neach survey. While NFCS 77 and CSFII 89 collected 3 d of\nwere recorded. Using 3 d of data would create noncomparable\ninformation. Further, the record data for d 3 provides surpris-\ningly distinct and less believable results (only 4% of participants\nreported snacking on d 3) (28). Selection of comparable 2-d\nperiods seemed the best way to provide comparable data. Using\n2 d is a closer approximation of usual intake, although it would\nbe better if these days were always measured randomly many\ndays apart.\nWe developed a restrictive approach to the definition of\nsnacking. We combined all the snacks consumed within 15 min\nof each other and we recoded those foods defined as snacks, but\neaten as part of a meal, as a meal only. There have been different\nconsiderations of snacking, based on the name occasions\nreported by the participants, and/or counting each snack food\neaten at a unique time interval as 1 snacking occasion (39,58).\nOthers defined snacks according to the time of day or type of\nabout the snack foods or meal foods definitions. However, we\nthink self-identification of a snacking occasion provides some\nFIGURE 2 Contribution of snacking to total daily\nenergy intake by year and age group.
