    "abstract": "Abstract\nMedicare Advantage was implemented in 2004 and the Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) program was implemented in\nFlorida during 2005. Both increase surveillance of medical necessity and deny payments for improper admissions. The purpose\nof the present study was to determine their potential impact on for-profit (FP) and not-for-profit (NFP) hospital operating\nmargins in Florida. FP hospitals were expected to be more adversely affected as admissions growth has been one strategy\nto improve stock performance, which is not a consideration at NFPs. This study analyzed Florida community hospitals from\n2000 through 2010, assessing changes in pre-tax operating margin (PTOM). Florida Agency for Health Care Administration\ndata were analyzed for 104 community hospitals (62 FPs and 42 NFPs). Academic, public, and small hospitals were excluded.\nA mixed-effects model was used to assess the association of RAC implementation, organizational and payer type variables,\nand ownership interaction effects on PTOM. FP hospitals began the period with a higher average PTOM, but converged\nwith NFPs during the study period. The average Medicare Advantage effect was not significant for either ownership type.\nThe magnitude of the RAC variable was significantly negative for average PTOM at FPs (-4.68) and positive at NFPs (0.08),\nmeaning RAC was associated with decreasing PTOM at FP hospitals only. RAC complements other Medicare surveillance\nsystems that detect medically unnecessary admissions, coding errors, fraud, and abuse. Since its implementation in Florida,\naverage FP and NFP operating margins have been similar, such that the higher margins reported for FP hospitals in the 1990s\nare no longer evident.\n",

Both programs heighten\nsurveillance of medical necessity and deny payments for\nunnecessary hospital admissions.\nMedicare Advantage was enacted in December 2003,\nenhancing benefits and managed care options to beneficia-\nries. In Florida, Medicare Advantage enrollment increased\nplans approve or deny payment for member services, typi-\ncally prospectively. An incentive exists to deny funding for\nmedicalservicesdeemedunnecessaryasMedicareAdvantage\nplans are private companies that must assure their own finan-\ncial success,.\nAs Medicare Advantage plans typically deny medically\nunnecessary admissions prospectively, neither revenue nor\nexpense is incurred for a disallowed admission because the\nadmission does not occur. Nonetheless, a hospital's pre-tax\noperating margin (PTOM) can be affected. The PTOM mea-\nsures a hospital's ability to generate revenue while control-\nling for expense. When an admission is denied, a hospital is\nprecluded from generating earnings, where earnings are\nmaximized from increasing revenue while controlling for\nexpense. In general, admissions deemed unnecessary may\nhave been more profitable as patients had acuity levels deter-\nmined inappropriate for admission, meaning if reimbursed at\ninpatient rates, such patients should be profitable, on aver-\nage. Furthermore, when fewer patients are admitted, fixed\ncosts are spread among fewer patients, thus increasing the\naverage cost per patient.\nDuring 2005, a 3-year RAC pilot program was imple-\nmented in Florida, California, and New York, which\naffected Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) patients. In 2007,\nthe pilot program was expanded to include 3 additional\nstates. The 6-state pilot concluded in 2008. Independent\nRAC contractors examined Medicare admissions to detect\nimproper overpayments and underpayments. Overpayment\noccurred when a provider's claim did not meet Medicare's\nmedical necessity or coding requirements, and payment\nwas then denied retrospectively. When underpayments\nwere detected, the amount was reimbursed to the provider.\nThe 6-state RAC pilot detected $1 billion in overpayments,\nof which nearly $700 million was returned to Medicare\ntrust funds, and detected $38 million in underpayments.5,6\nRAC was implemented nationwide in 2010, allowing\naudits of admissions from 2007 and beyond. Consequently,\nall Medicare FFS admissions in Florida have been eligible\nfor RAC review since the pilot was first implemented dur-\nAlthough RAC provides enhanced oversight of medical\nnecessity, Medicare claims administrator (MAC) contrac-\ntors, formerly known as fiscal intermediaries, have pro-\nvided claims administration and review activities since the\norigins of Medicare in 1965. The transition from fiscal\nintermediaries to MAC contractors also began during 2005,\nbut was not fully implemented by 2010. In contrast to MAC\ncontractors, RAC enhanced existing claims review pro-\ncesses, which was needed due to the multiple responsibili-\nties of MAC contractors that limited their review of claims\nto a small percentage, pre-payment and post-payment. RAC\nand MAC contractors use similar review processes (auto-\nmated reviews and complex reviews); however, RAC\nfocuses exclusively on post-payment claims review. During\nthe RAC pilot, 85% of overpayments pertained to inpatient\nadmissions. In addition, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid\nServices (CMS) uses other surveillance to identify cases for\nreferral to law enforcement. Prior to reviewing a claim,\nRACs are required to assure a MAC contractor did not pre-\nviously review the claim and that the review would not hin-\nder a fraud investigation.7 Thus, RAC functions in\ncoordination with MAC contractors and avoids interfering\nwith fraud and abuse investigations.\nRAC can adversely affect a hospital's PTOM. When a\nRAC audit determines an admission was medically unnec-\nessary, the provider is notified and can appeal the decision\nin a process initially conducted by MAC contractors. If the\nRAC decision is ultimately sustained, repayment for the\nadmission is required from the provider. Consequently, a\nhospital incurs the expense of the admission, but will\nreceive no payment (revenue), thereby reducing the hospi-\ntal's PTOM. During the pilot program, RAC audits in\nFlorida focused on short-stay claims. Hospitals with high\nlevels of short-stay admission denials made significant pay-\nbacks to Medicare. The American Hospital Association\nreported that, in Florida, a significant number of 1-day\nadmissions were denied because they could have been man-\naged through observation or at a lower level of care, for\nexample, chest pain. In addition, it was reported that 3-day\nstays were often denied because the admissions were pri-\nmarily used to qualify patients for Medicare Part A cover-\nage for a skilled nursing facility.8 During the RAC pilot,\nvulnerabilities identified in improper payment were com-\nmunicated to MAC contractors for use in further develop-\nment of their strategies. Due to RAC denials, where expense\nis incurred from an admission but not revenue, RAC is\nexpected to have a greater negative impact on PTOM than\nMedicare Advantage.\nFurthermore, Medicare Advantage and RAC programs\nmay have a greater impact on FP hospitals as the financial\npressure to admit patients is more consequential than at NFP\nhospitals due to the influence of growth in admissions and\nrevenue on the stock price of proprietary hospital chains. For\nexample, 2 such chains, HCA Holdings, Inc. (HCA) and\nHealth Management Associates (HMA), both experienced\ndeclining stock prices after reports of their first-quarter earn-\nings in 2013 revealed slower growth in hospital admissions\nrelative to prior periods.9 Ultimately, the HCA stock price\nfor strong growth in admissions and revenue.10,11 Although\ngrowth can be attained by acquiring more hospitals, growth\nin admissions at a given hospital is more challenging to\nachieve due to the surveillance of medical necessity from\nMedicare Advantage plans and RAC. For example, in 2012,\nsome former physicians at HMA hospitals alleged they were\npressured to admit patients from the emergency department,\nnot always based on medical need.12 However, with increased\nsurveillance, unnecessary Medicare admissions are less\nlikely to be funded, therefore reducing hospital operating\nprofitability.\nThe importance of growth and increasing revenue to pub-\nlically traded companies, including FP hospital chains, is that\nstock analysts use this information to estimate earnings,\nwhich can enhance a stock's future value. For example, a\ncertified financial analyst explained the benefit of growth\nLangland-Orban et al 3\nover several periods as follows, \"it will command multiples\nthat exceed the market multiple.\"13 Furthermore, FP hospital\ncommunications to investors state their specific goal of rev-\nenue growth. In its annual report in 2013, the FP hospital\nchain Community Health Systems (CHS) stated that the\ncompany had \"significant opportunities to improve financial\nperformance in 2014 as [they] deploy new growth strategies\"\nand their intent to leverage their \"considerable size and scale\nto drive higher revenues.\"14 Revenue growth is consistent\nwith performing in the \"growth stage\" of the Product Life\nCycle, as opposed to the \"maturity stage,\" which is associ-\nated with limited potential for growth in sales, for example,\ninpatient admissions. Furthermore, one strategy touted by a\nprivate equity firm is to achieve \"organic growth enhance-\nment,\" which is \"top line\" (revenue) growth, not attained via\nacquisitions. The strategy is to fund continued revenue\ngrowth without decreasing short-term earnings. The organic\ngrowth strategy does not place cost-cutting at a premium for\ndemonstrating financial performance.15\nBased on hospital structure, the industry is not inher-\nently highly profitable as it is real estate based and labor-\nintense, meaning high fixed costs. Consequently, a\nformer hospital CEO explained the focus of investors as\nfollows: \"The top line (revenue) is actually more impor-\ntant than your bottom line (net income after interest,\ntaxes, and depreciation). You will do anything to add\nrevenue.\"16 Although NFP hospitals also seek growth,\nthere are no consequences for these hospitals when it is\nnot attained, as long as financial stability is achieved.\nInstead, the consequences may affect top-management\nbonuses, but there are no direct negative consequences\nrelative to external capital measures, such as stagnating\nstock prices.\nFlorida provides a unique market to assess FP and NFP\nhospital profitability during the implementation of\nMedicare Advantage and RAC as half the acute care hospi-\ntals are FP. Florida is a bellwether state with the highest\npercentage of elderly population and the second highest\npercentage of FP hospitals. Furthermore, from 1991 to\n2005, several published studies analyzed hospital profit-\nability in Florida,1,2,17-21 such that factors associated with\nprofitability were established. Factors associated with hos-\npital profitability have included bed size, ownership, and\nlabor efficiency. Bed size is associated with economies of\nscale, as average cost was found to be higher in smaller\nhospitals.22 FP hospitals in Florida were associated with\nfewer full-time equivalent (FTE) staff per bed, fewer per-\nsonnel hours per adjusted patient day, and lower wages.1\nIncreases in labor efficiency were associated with sizable\ngains in hospital profitability.2\nThird-party payer mix also influences profitability. In\nof cost, respectively. Commercial insurers paid hospitals\nnet financial loss. In 2009, the median amount spent on\nuncompensated care by reporting NP hospitals was 1.52% of\nhospital expenses.24 Consequently, commercial insurance is\nexpected to be the most profitable and self-pay the least\nprofitable.\nthrough 2010 to assess whether Medicare Advantage or RAC\nwas associated with changes in hospital PTOMs of FP and\nNFP hospitals during this time period.\nMethods\nHospital financial data from the Florida Agency for Health\nCare Administration were used to analyze the operating prof-\nitability of community acute care hospitals in Florida from\nwere the major teaching hospitals, public hospitals, taxing\ndistrict hospitals, and those owned by foundations, as they\nhave additional revenue sources, which may or may not\naccrue as operating revenue. In addition, hospitals with less\nthan 50 beds were excluded as they are more likely to experi-\nence diseconomies of scale and many are critical access hos-\npitals, making them dissimilar to the retained group. A total\nof 104 acute care hospitals remained for inclusion: 42 NFP\nand 62 FP hospitals.\nPTOM was the dependent variable. It quantifies profit-\nability from annual patient care operations, measuring a hos-\npital's ability to generate revenue while controlling expense.\nIt was calculated as follows:\nPTOM\nTotal operating revenue\nTotal operating expense\n=\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal operating revenue\n.\nIndependent variables used in the analysis were organized\ninto three categories. The RAC variable captures time, pre-\nimplementation and post-implementation of RAC. As the\nwas the first year that would definitely be affected. The orga-\nnizational variables capture both ownership type and decisions\nthe organization can make, for example, Bed Size and Labor\nEfficiency. Adjusted patient days (APD) was used in calculat-\ning the Labor Efficiency variable. It was defined as follows,\nand accounts for both inpatient and outpatient services:\nAPD Inpatient Days\nGross Outpatient Revenue\nTotal G\n= \u00d7\n+\nr\nross Revenue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\nThe payer type variables capture the payer mix for each hos-\npital. All variables were continuous, except for RAC and\nOwnership. Each variable is defined below.\nA mixed-effects model was used to capture the effect over\ntime (11 years) of the repeated measurements for each hospi-\ntal, containing both fixed and random effects, to estimate the\nassociation between PTOM and the independent variables\ndescribed above. The study's unit of observation was an indi-\nvidual hospital. Ownership was modeled as a binary vari-\nable, and a hospital-specific random effect was included in\nthe model to account for correlation of PTOM for the same\nhospital. The Commercial insurance variable was excluded\nfrom the model and all other payer type variables were\nincluded. Seven interaction terms with Ownership type were\nadded to the model. All statistical analyses were performed\nwith Statistical Analysis System software (Version 9.4; SAS\nInstitute, Cary, North Carolina).\nThe final model was as follows:\nPTOM Ownership RAC Bed size\nLabor fficiency\n= + + + +\n   \n\nSelf-pay Medicare FFS\nMedicare Advantage M\n+ +\n+ +\n \n  e\nedicaid\nOther payers RAC Ownership\nLabor efficien\n+\n+ \u00d7 +\n \n\nc\ncy Ownership\nSelf-pay Ownership\nMedicare FFS\n\u00d7\n+ \u00d7 +\n\u00d7\n\n O\nOwnership\nMedicare Advantage Ownership\nMedica\n+\n\u00d7\n+\n\n i\nid Ownership\nOther payers Ownership Error.\n\u00d7 +\n\u00d7 +\n\nResults\nTable 1 provides the time trends for all performance indica-\ntor variables used in the model, as well as the percentage of\ntime trend statistical significance (P\ntrend\n) is based on data\nsimilar to Florida's population increase.

Other Payers decreased from\nFigure 1 illustrates changes in average PTOM at FP and\nNFP hospitals over the study period. In 2000, average PTOM\nwas -2.3% for NFPs and 7.6% at FPs, which is nearly a\ndecreased to 1.4 percentage points with average PTOM of\n4.1% at NFPs and 5.5% at FPs. Although the FP hospitals\nstarted the period with a higher average PTOM, the PTOM\nof the two groups converged during the 11-year period.\nAverage PTOM for FPs reached a nadir in fiscal year 2006,\nwhich is the year following the implementation of the RAC\npilot program; however, this average has since monotoni-\ncally improved.\nThe results of the final model are provided in Table 2.

All the other variables have values less than the\nabsolute value of 1, other than RAC (-4.68). The FP hospitals\nstart this study period at a much higher and positive PTOM\nposition than the NFPs, as evidenced in the intercept and the\neffect of NFP ownership status. The intercept results are an\nartifact of the model, so the values are not the true PTOM\ngroup mean at the start of the study period because all relevant\nvariables were not considered. FPs, on average, had a higher\nand positive PTOM at the start of the study period, whereas\nthe NFP group had, on average, a negative PTOM at the start,\nconsistent with Figure 1. Based on the estimate for RAC, FP\nhospitals, on average, lost 4.68 percentage points of PTOM\nfollowing RAC; conversely, NFP hospitals achieved an aver-\nage increase in PTOM of 0.08 percentage points as the RAC \u00d7\nOwnership interaction estimate was 4.76.\nFor payer type variables, the main effects for Medicare\nFFS and Medicaid were statistically significant, and main\nand interaction effects for Other Payers were also significant.\nThe Medicare Advantage was not statistically significant for\neither ownership type. PTOM had the same association with\npayer types regardless of hospital ownership type, with the\nexception of Other Payers, which is a relatively small group\nof unidentified payers.\nLarger bed size was positively associated with PTOM.\nHowever, Labor Efficiency, both main effects and interaction\neffects, was not statistically significant. This may suggest,\noverall, that hospitals have optimized labor efficiency, espe-\ncially as the reimbursement environment is such that greater\nvolume (adjusted patient days) does not always result in\ngreater payment.\nDiscussion\nThe present study analyzed the association of two Medicare\npolicy changes (Medicare Advantage and RAC) on hospital\nPTOM. Medicare Advantage was not associated with PTOM\nat FP or NFP hospitals, using Commercial insurance as the\nreference group. The lack of statistical significance may\noccur as Medicare Advantage plans use similar provisions in\napproving admissions as Commercial insurance plans, which\nwas the reference group.\nIn contrast, the RAC variable was associated with a signifi-\ncant decrease in PTOM at FP hospitals, but not at NFP hospi-\ntals. The analysis does not allow for making conclusions about\nthe potential association of RAC and decreased PTOM at FP\nhospitals. For example, PTOM may decrease due to RAC pay-\nment denials for purported medically unnecessary admissions\nor, alternatively, from FP hospitals decreasing potentially\nunnecessary admissions to avoid risk of payment denial.\nAs evidenced in Figure 1, the average PTOM at FP hospi-\ntals decreased in 2004, which is prior to the implementation\nof the RAC pilot program. This may be attributed to other\nfederal surveillance initiatives regarding medical necessity,\nfraud, and abuse, which were not controlled for in the study\nbecause they existed throughout the study period. The four\nlargest FP hospital chain settlements during the study period\nwith Medicare over fraud and abuse are listed below with\nthree occurring prior to RAC.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\nIt is possible that such settlements resulted in changing prac-\ntices among FP chains to avoid further penalties, which may\nTable 1.

The FP hospital industry's perspective on\nincreasing surveillance was explained as follows: \"Nearly all\npublicly traded systems list the government's heightened and\nmore well-coordinated, focus on policing healthcare fraud\nand abuse as a risk factor for their business.\"25\nSince 2006, the average PTOM at FP hospitals in Florida\nhas improved. This may occur as information about RAC pro-\ncesses and the basis for payment denials became evident,\nthereby allowing hospitals to be more effective in appealing\ndenials and determining, in advance, the types of cases that\nwill be denied. Numerous publications advise providers on\nconsiderations in appealing RAC decisions as five levels of\nappeal exist, developing an internal RAC-response approach,\nimproving clinical documentation and coding systems, as\nwell as understanding reasons targeted by RACs for payment\ndenial, for example, cases involving inpatient rehabilitation\nadmissions, high-risk diagnosis-related groups, and use of\ncertain diagnosis and procedure codes.26-31 One goal of the\nU.S. Senate Finance Committee is to assure that the RAC\nprocess is efficient, recognizing providers report that it can be\noverburdonsome.32 The ultimate goal is to minimize RAC\ndenials as hospitals avoid medically unnecessary admissions,\ncoding problems, and other discrepancies targeted by RAC.\nAlthough FP Florida community hospitals began the 21st\ncentury with higher average PTOMs, the margins converged\nwith NFP Florida hospitals around the time RAC was imple-\nmented and have remained similar since. Although RAC was\none Medicare initiative that appears to have contributed to\nthis change, other CMS surveillance initiatives were also\nused. RAC coordinates with MAC contractors and fraud and\nabuse investigations, such that RAC is complementary to\nNot-For-Profit For-Profit\nFigure 1. Eleven-Year average PTOM by ownership type.\nNote.
