It may exhibit the potential for patients under dabigatran therapy suffering ischemic\nstroke to regain eligibility for thrombolysis with rt-PA and may inhibit lesion growth in patients with intracerebral\nhemorrhage on dabigatran.\nAims: To provide insights into the clinical use of idarucizumab in patients under effective dabigatran anticoagulation\npresenting with signs of ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage.\nMethods: Retrospective data collected from German neurological/neurosurgical departments administering idarucizu-\nmab following product launch from January to August 2016 were used.\n1Department of Neurology, Nordwestkrankenhaus Sanderbusch, Sande,\nGermany\n2Medical Affairs Germany, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co\nKG, Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany\n3Department of Neurology, University Hospital, Essen, Germany\n4Department of Neurology, Kreiskrankenhaus Siegen, Germany\n5Department of Neurosurgery, Nordwestkrankenhaus Sanderbusch,\nSande, Germany\n6Department of Neurology, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany\n7Department of Neurology, Klinikum Altenburger Land GmbH,\nAltenburg, Germany\n8Department of Neurology, Klinikum Wolfsburg, Germany\n9Department of Neurology, Klinikum Mittelbaden, Rastatt, Germany\n10Department of Neurology Herz-Jesu-Krankenhaus Hiltrup, Mu\n\u00a8nster,\nGermany\n11Department of Neurology, University Medical Centre of the Johannes\nGutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany\n12Department of Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology, Evangelische\nKliniken Gelsenkirchen, Gelsenkirchen, Germany\n13Department of Neurology, University Medical Centre, Freiburg,\nGermany\n14Department of Neurology, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim,\nGermany\n15Department of Neurology, Evangelisches Krankenhaus Ko\n\u00a8nigin\nElisabeth Herzberge, Berlin, Germany\n16Department of Neurology, University Hospital Wu\n\u00a8rzburg, Wu\n\u00a8rzburg,\nGermany\n17Department of Neurology, Sozialstiftung Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany\n18Center for Neurology, Asklepios Hospitals Schildautal, Seesen,\nGermany\n19Stroke Unit, Marienhaus Klinikum, Kreis Ahrweiler, Bad Neuenahr-\nAhrweiler, Germany\n20Department of Neurology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg,\nGermany\n21Department of Neurology, Asklepios Klinik Altona, Hamburg, Germany\n22Department of Neurology, Main-Kinzig-Kliniken, Gelnhausen, Germany\n23Department of Neurology, University of Bonn Medical Center, Bonn,\nGermany\n24Department of Neurology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover,\nGermany\n25Department of Neurology, Centre of Neurology and Neuropsychiatry,\nLandschaftsverband Rheinland-Klinikum Du\n\u00a8sseldorf, Germany\nCorresponding author:\nHans-Christoph Diener, Department of Neurology, University Hospital,\nEmail: h.diener@uni-essen.de\nInternational Journal of Stroke, 12(4)\nInternational Journal of Stroke\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/wso\nResults: Thirty-one patients presenting with signs of stroke received idarucizumab in 22 stroke centers. Nineteen\npatients treated with dabigatran presented with ischemic stroke and 12 patients suffered from intracranial bleeding. In\npatients receiving rt-PA thrombolysis following idarucizumab, 79% benefitted from i.v. thrombolysis with a median\nimprovement of five points in NIHSS. No bleeding complications occurred. Hematoma growth was observed in 2 out\nof 12 patients with intracranial hemorrhage. The outcome was favorable with a median NIHSS improvement of 5.5 points\nand mRS 0\u00ad3 in 67%. Overall, mortality was low with 6.5% (one patient in each group).\nConclusion: Administration of rt-PA after reversing dabigatran activity with idarucizumab in case of ischemic stroke is\nfeasible, easy to manage, effective, and appears to be safe. In dabigatran-associated intracranial hemorrhage, idarucizumab\nhas the potential to prevent hematoma growth and improve outcome. Idarucizumab represents a new therapeutic option\nfor patients under dabigatran treatment presenting with ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage.\n",

We provide data about feasibility, potential\nefficacy and safety of idarucizumab application in\nthese two important patient cohorts.\nMethods\nWe retrospectively collected data from all German\nneurological/neurosurgical departments who used idar-\nucizumab for the reversal of dabigatran for the first\neight months from when it became available in the\nclinic in January 2016. The anonymized patient data\ncollected included baseline characteristics, clinical find-\nings, laboratory and coagulation parameters upon\nadmission, imaging diagnostics, clinical course and\nstatus upon discharge from hospital and further co-\nmedication. In case of intracranial hemorrhage, we col-\nlected information on hematoma growth with clinical\ndeterioration, adverse events of idarucizumab applica-\ntion and outcome measured by modified Rankin score\n(mRS) pre- and post-treatment. For ischemic stroke, we\nconsidered NIHSS, mRS, bleeding and thrombotic\ncomplications, clinical outcome and further co-medica-\ntion.

They did not display signs of bleeding or early\ninfarct signs on initial CT scan (see Table 1 for baseline\ncharacteristics, laboratory examinations, clinical course\nand outcome).

For patients on dabiga-\ntran, aPTT is recommended as an appropriate test to\nprovide qualitative rather than quantitative informa-\ntion about the presence and anticoagulant activity of\ndabigatran. We suggest taking a blood sample for\naPTT immediately after idarucizumab infusion to\nensure an on-label application of rt-PA. Thrombolysis\nwith rt-PA may be started without delay and only ter-\nminated if one of the coagulation parameters proves\nstill to be prolonged when analysis of the samples has\nbeen performed (see Expert Opinion in this journal\nissue). Thrombolysis with rt-PA was highly effective\nin our patient series with a median NIH-SS improve-\nment of 5 points and a median mRS of 1 point at dis-\ncharge. This improvement was achieved without a\nbleeding event. One thrombotic adverse event (bilateral\npulmonary embolism) leading to death occurred five\ndays after idarucizumab/rt-PA infusion. The pulmon-\nary embolism appeared most probably due to the fact\nthat effective anticoagulation was not restarted in this\npatient. Idarucizumab infusion was generally well tol-\nerated and anticoagulation with dabigatran could be re-\npatients.\nPatients with intracranial bleeding\nFive out of 12 patients with primary intracranial bleed-\ning were taking high-dose dabigatran (150 mg twice\ndaily). However, hematoma growth could only be\ndocumented in two patients. This is an important find-\ning, as previous data from the RE-LY trial showed that\nthe incidence of ICH was significantly lower in patients\non dabigatran; however, mortality was similar under\nVKA or dabigatran treatment.21 In addition, data\nfrom a subgroup of patients with intracranial hemor-\nrhage were recently presented from the interim analysis\nof the RE-VERSE AD trial, focusing on the ability of\nidarucizumab to reverse the anticoagulant effects of\ndabigatran in this patient group. The analysis showed\na rapid reversal of the anticoagulant activity and a mor-\ntality rate similar to patients with non-ICH included in\nthe RE-VERSE AD trial.22\nThe mortality after idarucizumab treatment was\n6.5% in this case collection of patients with hemor-\n(D110 mg) mortality in the RE-LY trial.21 A recent\nreport by Purrucker and colleagues23 summarizes 61\nconsecutive patients with non-traumatic NOAC-asso-\nciated intracerebral bleeding. In this case cohort, the\nmortality rate was 28% and hematoma expansion was\nMultinational registries are necessary to quantify\neffects on bleeding complications, hematoma growth,\nthrombotic events, outcome and mortality in cases of\nischemic stroke and intracranial bleeding from patients\ntreated with dabigatran receiving idarucizumab or\nother NOACs and anti-factor Xa inhibitor-antidotes\nwhen they become available.

Intravenous thrombolysis with rt-PA after antago-\nnizing dabigatran with idarucizumab is feasible,\neasy to manage in an emergency room or stroke-\nunit setting, appears to be safe and should there-\nfore be considered in cases where ischemic stroke\noccurs in patients under effective dabigatran\ntherapy.\n2. Idarucizumab application appears to prevent\nhematoma growth and might reduce mortality\nand/or improve outcome in cases of hemorrhagic\nstroke or intracranial hemorrhage and should\ntherefore be given in all patients presenting with\nintracranial bleeding and effective dabigatran\nanticoagulation.\nClearly, this study has limitations with regard to the\nsmall number of patients included in the analysis and\nthe retrospective nature of the study. However, this\ncase collection of administration of idarucizumab in\nacute neurological emergencies displays the largest\nreal world experience available to date. Thus, this\ncase collection adds important clinical information\nuntil further robust data from large prospective regis-\ntries will be available.\n"
