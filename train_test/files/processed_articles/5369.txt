Thus, teachers are entering the classroom through various\ncertification routes with varying levels of training as the traditional and alternative programs differ in their requirements.\nClassroom management can determine the success or failure of teachers and students. The research involved in this study\nattempted to determine whether university-certified teachers differ from alternatively certified teachers in the area of\nclassroom management as determined by referrals, while controlling for level of education, years of teaching experience, age,\nrace, and gender at both middle and high school levels. The population for this study was the middle and high school teachers\nin one rural south central Texas school district. Data were collected from the school district's personnel database as well\nas from the campus-level administrators. Hierarchical regressions were used to test null hypotheses and recommendations\nwere suggested.\n",

However, there are differences in certification\ntype, which arise from the chosen type of state-approved\nroute to certification that each teacher takes.\nIn Texas, traditional routes to certification consist of uni-\nversity-based non-education programs, university post-bac-\ncalaureate programs, and out-of-state certification (State\nBoard of Educator Certification [SBEC]). Traditional routes\nto certification involve completing some form or combina-\ntion of coursework, field-based experience, and the state-\napproved content area exams. For teachers receiving initial\ntraditional certification programs.\nProspective teachers can also choose non-traditional or\nalternative certification routes to achieve teaching certifica-\ntion. Alternative certification programs were designed to\nmitigate teacher shortages as well as fast track interested\nindividuals into education (Heinen & Scribner, 2009).\nAlternative certification programs are expedited programs\nthat place prospective teachers into the classroom after a\nbrief introductory training and student support period (Jacobs\n& Walsh, 2007). Proponents of alternative certification\nprograms argue that the benefit of alternative certification\nprograms is the continuing professional development and\nsupport of beginning teachers, which has been identified as a\nkey factor in teacher success (National Center for Education\nOnce in the classroom, teachers are responsible for the\neducation of their students and must find the most effective\nway to teach them, maintain order, and build relationships\nwith their students through the use of effective classroom\nmanagement techniques (Harrison & Killion, 2007).\nClassroom management refers to the design and implemen-\ntation of efficient classroom routines, policies, and proce-\ndures for participation in class discussions, forming\ncooperative learning groups, accomplishing class work, and\nvarious other classroom activities and interactions (Sterling,\n2009). Classroom management can determine the success or\nfailure of teachers and students.\n1Comal Independent School District, New Braunfels, TX, USA\n2Texas A&M University\u00adKingsville, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLori Kupczynski, Texas A&M University\u00adKingsville, 700 University Blvd.,\nA Comparison of Traditional and\nAlternative Certification Routes on\nClassroom Management\nBrian Uriegas1, Lori Kupczynski2, and Marie-Anne Mundy2\n Keywords\nalternative certification, traditional certification, classroom management, discipline\n2 SAGE Open\nPutman (2009) identifies student discipline and classroom\nmanagement as areas of anxiety and concern for pre-service\nteachers. Schools across the United States are experiencing\nall time highs in behavior problems (Abede & HaileMariam,\n2007). Principals note that to limit the number of office refer-\nrals, teachers must be able to distinguish between what con-\nstitutes a discipline infraction as opposed to an issue of\nclassroom management (Wyatt, 2010). According to Baines\n(2006), university-certified teachers outperform alternatively\ncertified teachers.\nThe research involved in this study attempted to deter-\nmine which factors affect classroom management; more spe-\ncifically, whether differences exist between the classroom\nmanagement abilities of traditional and alternative certifica-\ntion teachers as measured by discipline referrals, while con-\ntrolling for level of education, years of teaching experience,\nage, race, and gender at both middle and high school levels.\nAs the teaching profession continues to expand, more\nresearch is needed to analyze the effectiveness of certifica-\ntion programs.\nReview of Literature\nThe Teacher Center (2004) explains that individuals seek\ncertification to teach for many reasons, including a feeling of\nwanting to have a greater impact on people and the decline of\nthe business world. For individuals seeking teaching certifi-\ncation, there are not only many steps in the process but also\nmany routes for accomplishing these steps.\nThe Texas SBEC has established several steps a person\nmust complete before becoming a certified teacher. First, a\nperson must hold a bachelor's degree from an accredited col-\nlege or university within this requirement is the stipulation\nthat all teachers must have an academic major as well as\nteacher training courses because Texas institutions do not\noffer degrees in education. Subsequently, prospective teach-\ners must complete an approved teacher training program,\nwhich can be completed through a college or a university,\nschool district, regional service center, community college,\nor other entity such as an alternative certification program.\nFinally, pre-service teachers must complete and pass the\nappropriate teacher certification test for the subject and grade\nlevel that they wish to teach (SBEC, 2011).\nThe TEA has established two final steps a person must\ncomplete, once all other appropriate steps for certification\nhave been completed, to become a certified teacher in Texas.\nFirst, a person must complete and submit the appropriate\napplication and fees which are then filed with SBEC. Second,\nall first-time teachers in the state of Texas must submit to\nfingerprinting as part of a national criminal background\nTypes of Certification\nOne of the most controversial topics in education today is the\nhiring of teachers who were alternatively certified versus\nteachers who were certified through a traditional program.\nThe types of teacher certification differ in terms of the\nrequirements necessary for certification. Taking an even\ncloser look at alternative certification versus traditional cer-\ntification, one of the biggest differences is the practicum or\nfield-based experience factor. While the field experience\nmay not be extensive, teacher preparation programs may uti-\nlize intensive field experiences involving reflection and\ninquiry that link theories with personal learning experiences\n(Capraro, Capraro, & Helfeldt, 2010). For students to benefit\nfrom teachers, certification programs (alternative or tradi-\ntional) must ensure that candidates are trained and practice\nunder quality veterans from the very first day the candidate\nsets foot in a classroom (Darling-Hammond, Holtzman,\nTraditional. Traditional teaching certification encompasses a\nvariety of different methods of obtaining a teaching certifi-\ncate through a university. Traditional teaching certification\ncan be obtained through a university undergraduate program,\na university post-baccalaureate program, or through certifi-\ncation earned in another state.According to TEA(2010), uni-\nversities offer certification to persons who either have\ngraduated high school and are entering college seeking a\nteaching degree, or who have earned a degree and wish to\nbecome a certified teacher.\nProponents of traditional teacher certification programs\nargue that field-based aspects of these programs allow for\nteachers to experience more challenges before entering the\nteaching world, thereby allowing these teachers to prepare\nfor the \"real world.\" It has been suggested that the current\nuniversity-based system has been best suited to prepare\nteachers for the classroom (Lit, Nager, & Snyder, 2010). The\nidea that student achievement increases with the level of\nclassroom experience a teacher has is supported by Buck and\nO'Brien's (2005) research findings showing a positive rela-\ntionship between teaching experience and teacher effective-\nness (Marszalek & Odom, 2010). In some instances,\ntraditionally certified teachers and alternatively certified\nteachers both performed adequately as a mixed group, but\ntraditionally trained teachers performed significantly better\nin the area of quality student management practices (Brindley\nAlternative certification.Alternative certification has been a\nterm used for a variety of programs that train and credential\nteachers in an expedited manner often by eliminating steps\nsuch as student teaching.\nUriegas et al. 3\nIn Texas, specifically, alternative certification programs\ncan come from universities, region service centers, and pri-\nvate organizations. While there are many alternative certifi-\ncation programs to choose from in Texas, TEA (2010)\nprovides a set of guidelines and procedures for teachers who\nchoose to seek certification through an alternative certifica-\ntion program. Prospective teachers must determine a grade\nlevel and subject area to teach and choose an approved alter-\nnative certification program. Once the alternative certifica-\ntion program is chosen, the prospective teacher must meet\nthe required screening criteria of that program, which may\ninclude college grade point average, basic skills, and content\nknowledge. The next step in the process is to set a certifica-\ntion plan within the respective program.\nSome alternative certification programs are self-taught\nand simply consist of online modules that must be completed\nwithin a specific time frame during the intern year. Other\nalternative certification programs require actual classroom\ntime with an instructor, while still other alternative certifica-\ntion programs consist of a mixture of the two methods.\nAnother difference that exists between various alternative\ncertification programs is requirement for internship training.\nSome alternative certification programs, usually university\nor service center based, allow students to obtain a paid intern-\nship or probationary teaching position based on coursework\nprogress and the completion of appropriate certification\ntests. A student must obtain an eligibility statement from the\nprogram to be employed (TEA, 2010). There are also alter-\nnative certification programs, such as Texas Teachers, that\nwill allow a student to accept a paid teaching position almost\nimmediately after acceptance into the teacher training pro-\ngram (TEA, 2010). A candidate will need to secure a teach-\ning assignment at the grade level and in the subject area of\none's target certificate. Once the prospective teacher secures\na teaching position, the prospective teacher will follow the\nsame process as prospective teachers acquiring certification\nthrough a post-baccalaureate certification program. Upon\ncompletion of the process, the candidate will be a certified\nSome alternative programs are basically traditional pro-\ngrams under a different name, whereas other programs have\nvery few admission standards or program requirements\nuniversity-based alternative programs exist in two forms: the\n\"learn while you earn program,\" which has an expedited\nsummer course preceding a full-time teaching position as an\ninternship year, or the Internet-based programs, which have\nno field experience requirement.\nThere have been benefits from alternative certification\nprograms, which include work experienced teachers entering\nthe profession and addressing teaching fields that were con-\nsidered critical needs areas (Mikulecky, Shkodriani, &\nWilner, 2004). One of the central beliefs of the alternative\ncertification programs is that continuous professional devel-\nopment and support offered to first-year teachers through\nthese programs is more beneficial than a semester of class-\nroom experience with no follow-up support or extension\nClassroom management has been one of the areas where\nalternatively certified teachers have struggled. The biggest\nissues first-year alternatively certified teachers deal with are\ntime and the managing of students (Samaras & Wilcox,\n2009). In addition, alternatively certified teachers struggle\nwith student achievement as students who had university-\ncertified teachers outperformed students from alternatively\nMethod\nTeacher demographic data were collected through the\nstudied rural south central Texas school district's Human\nResource department. A spreadsheet containing teachers'\nlevel of education and years of teaching experience, age,\nrace, and gender on the district's five middle school and\nthree high school campuses was provided. All identifiable\ninformation was removed for confidentiality purposes. A\nprintout of all discipline data in the Internet-based Texas\nComputer Cooperative System (iTCCS) were obtained\nfrom each campus administrator or Public Education\nInformation Management System (PEIMS) clerk. Teacher\ndemographic data, including age, gender, ethnicity, years\nof experience, and degree earned, and the number of dis-\ncipline referrals written by each teacher were captured\ninto a Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)\nfile.\nThe researchers input the dependent variable, classroom\nmanagement as measured by discipline referrals. This was\nchosen as the sole dependent variable because of the lack of\ninformation pertaining to discipline referrals in the literature.\nThe use of only discipline referrals as the dependent variable\nis a limitation of the study. The researchers do acknowledge\nthat discipline referrals are only one aspect of classroom\nmanagement that may affect instruction.\nOnce this variable was input, the researchers created the\nblock of covariates: level of education, years of teaching\nexperience, age, race, and gender for teachers at the middle\nschool level and high school levels, individually. The\nresearchers then added the remaining variable: route to\nteacher certification. The purpose of this was to discover\nhow much variance this variable accounted for.\nResults\nFor this study, 232 middle school teachers were examined;\ndemographic data for these teachers can be found in\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 1. Also analyzed was the mean number of discipline\nreferrals written by the combined (M = 5.54) and by each of\nthe traditional (M = 5.62) and alternative (M = 5.27) routes\n(Table 2).\nEntry of the demographic variables of degree, age, gen-\nder, ethnicity, and years of experience accounted for 3.3%\nof the variance (R2) in the subjects' discipline referrals.\nEntry of the certification variable resulted in an R2 change\nof .001, thus entry of the certification variable increased the\nexplained variance in the subjects discipline referrals by\n0.1% to a total of 3.4%. This increase was not significant as\n(Table 3). The results suggest that when adding the variable\nof certification to the demographic variables, there was no\nsignificant effect on the number of discipline referrals that\nwere written.\nThe ANOVA represented in Table 4 shows that entry of\nthe set of demographic variables alone yielded an insignifi-\nof the certification variable resulted in an overall insignifi-\nsignificant differences between the number of discipline\nreferrals that were written for the traditional route (M =\nSimilarly, 281 high school teachers were examined;\ndemographic data can be found in Table 5.

This increase was not significant as\n(Table 7).

The result of\nthe addition of the certification variable yielded no signifi-\ncant effect on the number of discipline referrals written\nthroughout the school year as evidenced by comparing the\nmeans of discipline referrals written by traditionally certi-\nalternatively certified middle school teachers (M = 5.27, SD\n= 6.05), and by traditionally certified high school teachers\nTable 2.

Teachers, regardless of their\ncertification routes, hone their craft with age and experi-\nence. In addition, circumstances such as previous career\nand life experiences may be beneficial to teachers who\nachieved certification through alternative certification\nprograms. For administrators and human resource person-\nnel, the results of this study suggest that hiring practices\nshould not attempt to avoid alternatively certified teachers\nas there is no significant difference in the ability to man-\nage a classroom when comparing alternatively certified\nteachers with traditionally certified teachers. Additional\nresearch should be done to determine the effects of certi-\nfication type on student achievement and teacher\nretention.\nTable 3.
