Devolution as a form of decentralization transferred\nboth political and administrative powers from the center to lower local councils specially to handle the responsibility of\nservice delivery. Following the approval of the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) Act 2010, the city's administration\nreverted to the central government. Detractors of decentralization allege that the conveyance in the policy and legislation\nfor change of Kampala city administration was timely because decentralization failed to deliver desired services to residents.\nThis article contends that recentralization of Kampala city administration was a necessary evil, it decreased the autonomy\nof sub-national governments in civil service administration, eroded accountability to the electorates, and transferred the\nallegiance of the accounting officer from local governments with and for which they work to the central government that\ndesignates and positions. To inflame accountability in local governments, the article champions for the reexamining of the\nKCCA Act 2010 to allow power sharing between the mayor and executive director to enhance bottom-up accountability,\nchecks and balances, and for participation of central government in appointing of executive director to allow financial and\nsecurity support. It additionally requests for a reconsideration of the 9th Parliament to lobby for the amendments owing to\nchallenges in its implementation and impact on accountability.\n",

The alteration from\ncentral to local authority was noticed in Latin America,\nAfrica, and Asia in the 1970s as a result of the disenchant-\nment with the centralized system of governance (Brillantes\nSmoke, 2003). Over the past several decades, many coun-\ntries have implemented decentralization as an all-embracing\nstrategy for government transformation (Smith, 1985).\nIn developed countries, decentralization was stimulated\nas a way of rationalizing government administration and\naddressing the frustration of red tape and service provision\n(Burns et al., 1994). Although decentralization was moti-\nvated to expand service delivery and check on the central\ngovernment failures in East Asia (White & Smoke, 2005),\nthe rationale was different in sub-Saharan Africa due to\nincreased demand for people participation in decision mak-\ning as a result of multi-party politics (Smoke, 2003), whereas\nthe desire for the democratization process influenced decen-\ntralization in Latin America (Burns et al., 1994).\nMany countries that had earlier undertaken decentraliza-\ntion are now recentralizing and increasing their number of\nadministrative units (Malesky, Nguyen, & Tran, 2012). This\ntrend is not unique to Uganda but Africa in general and other\ncountries such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Brazil, Morocco,\n1Islamic University in Uganda, Mbale, Uganda\n2University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\n3Uganda Institute of Information and Communication Technology,\nKampala, Uganda\nCorresponding Author:\nNabukeera Madinah, Lecturer, Faculty of Management, Islamic University\nin Uganda, Mbale, Uganda.\nEmail: nabmadinah@gmail.com\nRecentralization of Kampala City\nAdministration in Uganda: Implications\nfor Top and Bottom Accountability\nNabukeera Madinah1, Ali Boerhannoeddin2,\nRaja Noriza Binti Raja Ariffin2, and Bwengye Michael3\n Keywords\nrecentralization, service delivery, KCCA, accountability, local government\n2 SAGE Open\nAlthough this transformation has significant implications in\nthe way it alters the comprehensive assortment of power\nrelations specifically the electorates', the topography,\neconomic, and community closeness to local representatives\nand administrators' contact points for services provision, as\nwell as local authorities' relationships with the central state,\nhave been widely ignored by researchers. The emphasis of\nthis article is that the decentralization led to recentralization\nof Kampala city, which later weakened bottom accountabil-\nity to the electorate.\nThis was supported by Grossman and Lewis (2014), that\nthe creation of districts leads to \"change in the intergovern-\nmental balance of power that favors the central government\nsince the units have low bargaining power and tend to be\nhighly dependent on the center for resources, planning, and\nservice delivery\" (p. 215), which also facilitates \"dependency\nin terms of administrative centralization\" (Lewis, 2014,\np. 576) and increasing the number of units has many implica-\nUganda dispersed a new constitution in 1995 (Government\nof Uganda [GOU], 1995) with the provision on decentraliza-\ntion of Article 176 2 (b) that acted shortly before the rebirth\nof the Local Government Act (GOU, 1997). Devolution as a\nform of decentralization transferred both political and admin-\nistrative powers from the center to lower local councils spe-\ncially to handle the responsibility of service delivery. The\nelected mayors, chair persons, and councils of sub-counties\nin Kampala were locally accountable to the electorate, and\npublic service was therefore considered to be the mast of\nhighly decentralized local governance.\nThe failure for local governments in Kampala to deliver\nservices resulted into a new Kampala City Council (KCC)\nAct where we witnessed partnership arrangements and inter-\ngovernmental relationships (city\u00adsub-county merger) under\nthe current administration of KCC (herein after referred to as\nKampala Capital City Authority--KCCA1), which was set\nup after the approval of the KCC Act (GOU, 2010) and the\nappointment of the current executive director as the chief\nexecutive of the authority, the accounting officer, and head-\nship of the central government in the authority. This would\nhelp to restructure, transform, and reposition the authority to\ndeliver quality services to the people of Kampala.\nWhen President Yoweri Kagutta Museveni took state\nlocal government were witnessed. The president's guiding\nprinciple of participatory democracy through decentraliza-\ntion was to delegate tasks, duties, and accountabilities from\nthe center to the local units (Okumu-Wengi, 1994; Villadsen\n& Lubanga, 1996). The policy intention was to enhance the\ntransfer of scale and scope responsibilities at the lowest pos-\nsible administration unit, which has been described as a form\nof alteration that is remarkable among developing nations\n(Steiner, 2006). From one standpoint, the policy has been\ndescribed by Francis and James (2003) as the greatest\nwholesale local revolution reorganization program among all\ndeveloping countries. Another point of view by Mitchinson\n(2003) maintains that Uganda's localization agenda is a\nunique, comprehensive delegation inventiveness of any state\nin the time release.\nAfter the central government conceding its inability to\nprovide services because of its big debts and obligations, the\nresistance statute was put in place. This was accompanied by\nthe Local Government Act, which empowered local govern-\nment to deliver services through contracting out (GOU,\n1997). The central government adopted the decentralization\npolicy to empower district governments and lower govern-\nment units with a view of taking services nearer to the peo-\nple. It was the way of involving people in their affairs so as\nto give them the best in terms of quality and quantity.\nLocal government under decentralization embraced con-\ntracting out selected public services to private firms. Tenders\nwere awarded to successful firms to deliver particular ser-\nhad become a fashion for all the districts in Uganda.\nContracting out had proved to be an important method of\nprioritizing community social services, which is in the 1997\nLocal Government Act.\nTheUnitedNationsConferenceonTradeandDevelopment\n(UNCT; 1995) addressed privatization as a national strategy\nof giving mandate to the local people to determine their pri-\norities and also is in line with Article One of the Uganda's\nConstitution (GOU, 1995) which states that power belongs\nto the people. However, there are some misgivings about\nthe whole concept of contracting out in the delivery of ser-\nvices under the decentralization program. Some of the con-\ntracts have been taken over by \"`Mafias'Who Hijack Tenders\nare accusations and counter accusations of corruption and\nsubstandard work by firms (Monitor Newspaper, 2002). Two\ndecades later, public services were not desirable. According\nto a local newspaper in Uganda (Semujju, 2013), the major-\nity of Ugandans decry of poor service delivery.\nThe disappointment of private\u00adpublic partnership and the\nresources found many new districts unfortunate. Because the\nexpansion has not been proportional to the growth of the\nresource envelope, infrastructure, and human resources, ser-\nvices delivery in many districts has stagnated.\nIt was envisioned that the authority would become an\ninstitution that would transform the past challenges of inad-\nequate and poor quality service, lack of operational guide-\nlines and standards, inadequate professionalism, poor\ninspection to confirm compliance to approved specifications,\ncorruption, among many other service delivery issues, into\noperations with clearly defined administrative and technical\nstructures that would enable the government to deliver much\nneeded services to the residents of Kampala City.\nThe authority was established with a strong legal frame-\nwork as detailed in the KCC Act (GOU, 2010) with the\nMadinah et al. 3\nmandate of providing a territorial boundary for Kampala and\nwith a view of providing the following: developmental ser-\nvices; providing the structure and voting of representatives\nof the authority as well as their removal; voting and elimina-\ntion of the lord mayor and deputy mayor; the arrangement,\ncontrols, and roles of the executive director and deputy exec-\nutive director; to provide for the lower urban councils; the\ndevolution of tasks and amenities, delivery of services for a\ncity physical planning authority for Kampala and neighbor-\ning regions, among many other issues. This legal framework\nwas intended to guide the operations and conduct of the\nauthority, the administrative staff as well as the political arm\nof the authority.\nWith the onset of the said Act, it became critical to start a\nprocess of reviewing the authority-specific policies and\norganizational, structural, and governance issues pertaining\nto the effective and efficient operations of this very important\nbody in the creation and establishment of effective systems,\nprocesses, and controls in its operations. It became impera-\ntive to evaluate the realignments and best practices in their\noperations and wider civil service to ascertain the implica-\ntion of district creation and later recentralization of Kampala\non top-bottom accountability to the electorate.\nThe article proceeds as follows: First, we explore the intro-\nduction of the decentralization reform; second, discuss the\ntheories underpinning recentralization; and third, methodol-\nogy. We then discuss the recentralization of Kampala City;\nfourth, we provide the post-recentralization scenario, and\noffer the underpinnings of how recentralization of Kampala\ncity undermined bottom accountability, as well as the change\nin power and control, and also provide the restricted power\nfor the political wing in KCCA and then conclude with dis-\ncussion of our findings in the section \"Conclusion.\"\nTheories Underpinning\nRecentralization\nBasing on the depiction from various initial theories of com-\nbined dynamic action, institutional approach, collective\naction, democratic representation, intergovernmental rela-\ntions, and state building, this article argues that with the\noption of decentralization reforms, district unit creation\nmakes states vulnerable to recentralization of intergovern-\nmental authority, which then affects accountability to the\nelectorate due to \"over dependence at the centre\" (Lewis,\nhappen and each suggests a separate domain of intergovern-\nmental relations, institution, democratic, change in power\nand control, and restricted power for political representatives\nthat is influenced by the creation of several new district units.\nFirst, there are extras beyond the design of the decentral-\nized system than allocation of revenue and expenditure\nresponsibilities to various ranks of the state. The argument\nby Azfar, K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen, Lanyi, Meagher, and Rutheford (1999)\nand Litvack, Ahmad, and Bird (1998) is that, institutions\ndetermine the accomplishment of any program, this may\nimply the game rules of the society and limitations that affect\nthe organization, human behavior, and other means that sup-\nthat decentralization will capture accountability upwards,\nimprove transparency, and increase local voice if local lead-\nership is elected rather than appointed by higher level of gov-\nernment, and if this is adhered to, it can improve the\nrelationship between the center and region.\nSecond, intergovernmental relationship determines the\ncomplex relationship between different levels of govern-\nments due to mixing power with accountability tasks. This\nrelationship is regarded as reciprocal, where one relies on the\nother to perform certain tasks components (Chanie, 2007).\nThe relationship is multifaceted due to the variations in the\ncorresponding roles of both higher and lower local govern-\nments confirmed by cumulative alterations in number and\nresponsibilities in delivering most of the communal services\nappropriate for local demands through over-reliance on the\ncenter through the joining capacity to act collectively.\nThird, the partition of units upholds not only transfer of\nresources and decision-making power to lower levels of gov-\nernment, but also lowers representatives with authority to be\naccountable to the citizens, requests for accountability, and\nimproves public involvement in the lower local political\npractice. The advocates of this argue that, there is nothing\nless than total involvement in the process of policy formula-\ntion and they insist on full participation of individual inhabit-\nants rather than pseudo-participation (Hart, 1972), which\nreduces accountability to the voters.\nFourth is the change in power and control through creat-\ning various channels of reporting. This lessens the span of\ncontrol and leads to over-supervision of lower representa-\ntives, hence becoming accountable to the center rather than\nthe electorate because their positions have been made cere-\nmonial. Finally the restricted power for political reform of\ncreation of many units has deprived elected politicians and\nremarkably weakened mechanism of democracy in favor of\ncenter. This leads to different collusion and contestation\namong local representatives because the reforms have under-\nprivileged their controls and influence.\nAlthough bottom accountability issues are frequently\nignored in prevailing studies on decentralization, it plays a\nsignificant part in center-lower dealings and country struc-\nture in many modern African countries due to weak institu-\ntions inherited from the past colonial masters and an\nassociated susceptibility to sideline revolutions.\nTo validate these opinions, the article explores chrono-\nlogical disparity in the scope of recentralization and decen-\ntralization in Uganda. Uganda is an appropriate example for\nthis study because, similar to many African nations, in the\n1980s it diverted from a post-independence period branded\nby centralized system of governance.\nIn the initial 1990s, it embraced and commenced\nextremely aspiring decentralization transformations and\n4 SAGE Open\nother national development program efforts, although in the\nsame period undergoing frequent rural rebellions. In present\nyears, under the governance of President Museveni and the\nNational Resistance Movement (NRM), that has controlled\nthe country for almost three decades, the country has con-\nverted gradually to a centralized system of governance\nincluding the units within the capital city Kampala (CCK).\nUsing original evidence from field interviews, and aca-\ndemic and policy studies on Uganda, we explored the asso-\nciations between district unit multiplication as a result of\nUganda's ambitious decentralization policy and the center\nsucceeding, reducing of delegated control of political power\nfor politicians, and administrative and intergovernmental\ncontrol that undermined accountability to the electorate.\nFinally, as we contend below, the creation of districts as\nadministrative units expected to have impacts on intergov-\nernmental stability of authority thus support the develop-\nments of recentralization.\nWe explore the reduction of delegated control of political\npower through use of the Act (GOU, 2010) which restricted\npower for politicians, administrative workforce using inter-\ngovernmental control of division unit creation and this has\nundermined bottom accountability. Notwithstanding the\noccurrence of district creation in emerging nations and its\nprospects to significantly form the economic, political, and\nsocial consequences, the prevailing academic works on the\ncauses of these occurrences are not sufficient that we pursue\nto address.\nThe current literature addresses top-down strategy, politi-\ncal incentives, importance, agency of local actors, ethnic\npatronage network, fading powers of provincial opposition\npowers, and effects of how proliferation shapes the intergov-\nernmental balance of power (Green, 2010; Grossman &\nWe speculate that the employed justification of district cre-\nation leading to recentralization reform is significant for the\npolitical survival of the NRM regime.\nThis article makes two significant contributions to the\npromising district proliferation literature. One contribution is\nthe premeditated, planned, and protected efforts by the state\nto negate some of the elements for smooth managing of the\npolicy, and second, the negative impact of recentralization of\nKampala city on bottom accountability and the findings in\nthis article have implications for several diverse literatures.\nOverall, this article participates in building the literature\non decentralization, arguing that even when decentralization\nreforms are characterized by creating more districts through\ndividing big districts into small ones, it can have far-reaching\neffects hence contributing to recentralization of power. The\nlinkage between district unit creation and intergovernmental\nauthority is forthright because it is through the relationships\nthat accountability to the electorates is undermined and this\nand Ziblatt (2004), who argue that the creation of a large\nnumber of new local governments fragments existing ones\ninto smaller units with lower intergovernmental power and\nweak administrative capacity. Such a situation contributes to\nan augment of dependence of local governments on the\nresources and technical expertise of the central government\nIn the last part of our study, we offer evidence from inter-\nviews with mayors, deputy mayors, councilors, senior\nadministrative staff in KCCA, ministry of public service,\nministry of local government, and ministry of health in the\nfive sub-counties that settles with our argument that recen-\ntralization of districts that shadowed Uganda's decentraliza-\ntion transformations backed up the recent recentralization of\npower hence undermining bottom accountability. To the best\nof our knowledge, no previous study reflects the possibility\nthat the assumed to be just an indicator of decentralization\nprogram can indeed lessen bottom accountability and affect\nthe intergovernmental authority.\nMethod\nThis qualitative study investigates the consequences of\nrecentralization of Kampala city administration on top-bot-\ntom accountability in a highly devolved country. Data were\ngathered through semi-structured interviews with 15 codes\nand 35 interviews purposively selected from mayor, deputy\nmayors, councilors, senior administrative staff in KCCA,\nministry of public service, ministry of local government, and\nministry of health in the five sub-counties of KCCA in\nUganda. The information was analyzed using thematic and\ncontent analysis. Although the findings are not generalizable\nglobally, they nuance our understanding of perverse effects\nof recentralization of city administration on accountability to\nelectorates in local governments. This article is an extension\nof a few works done as a by-product of recentralization in\nUganda (Lewis, 2014) and the uniqueness of the article is in\nrecent recentralization and the impact on the electorate in\nterms of accountability. Table 1 shows the codes of inter-\nviewees, their organizations, and the total number of inter-\nviewees interviewed.\nRecentralization of Kampala City\nAdministration\nThe new Act provided that the authority will be constituted\nby technical and the political arm. The technical arm will\nconstitute the executive director's office and 10 directorates\nas provided for by the KCC Act (GOU, 2010) whereas the\npolitical arm will constitute the lord mayor and the divisional\nmayors.\nIn terms of organization structure, KCC was organized\nunder eight divisions and two units, which included the may-\nor's office as indicated in the following functions: administra-\ntion, internal audit, education and sports, engineering and urban\nplanning, finance/treasury, health, legal services, welfare and\nMadinah et al. 5\ncommunity services, projects unit and mayor's office, and in\nterms of human resource deployment and development, as on\nexcluding casual workers.\nThe major considerations for recentralization of KCCA\nwere to revamp the former KCC to turn it into an authority\nthat revolves around the following:\ni. Provide much needed services to the capital city.\nii. Promote the culture of effective customer service and\nresponsiveness to change.\niii. Develop institutional infrastructure for better gover-\nnance in terms of systems and controls.\niv. Promote democratic principles and good governance\nin the operations of KCCA.\nv. Empower people through a system of governance\nthat is characterized by transparency, accountability,\nand equitable resource allocation and usage, among\nothers.\nIt is against this background that we contextually think\nthat the above concerns can be implicit. Certainly, there was\nan urgent need to protect the city's image in terms of sanita-\ntion and beautification, there was double-dealing and incom-\npetence in the prior management of KCC but this is not\nenough justification for central government to defend their\nabsenteeism for robust support for the sub-national govern-\nments, which usually results into recentralization and chaos\nThroughout the geographical disparity, Uganda govern-\nment decided to recentralize only the capital city and not all\nmunicipalities in the country by forming an authority, which\nis over and above the city in the illusion of renovating service\ndelivery.\nThe intensive attempt to recover potential ways through\nthe legal instrument reiterates the factual contention that\ndecentralization as a system of governance can only be effec-\ntive and operational if local upper class approves of the deal\nwith central government (Mawhood, 1993). Similarly, the\nreinforcement that central government has given to the new\nadministrative system is a comprehensible manifestation of\nits lack of interest to respond to the cries from the prior\nadministrators of the city. Central government's decision to\nrecentralize the city is like, \"change horses in the mid-\nstream\"; a perfect signal that Uganda could not stand the\nassessment of time as a comprehensive and role model of\nwholesale decentralization system in the developing world.\nThe scenery started in 1997 through the city development\nstrategy (CDS) that later proposed the innovative forms of\nservice delivery and "
