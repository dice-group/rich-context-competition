In 1980,\nmillion people in federal and state prisons (Guerino,\nHarrison, & Sabol, 2011), greater than the population of\nfederal prisoners return to civilian society every year\n(Guerino et al., 2011). Nearly two thirds of released prison-\ners are rearrested for a new crime within 3 years of their\nrelease and half are sent back behind bars (Urban Institute,\n2009). The cost in human suffering and the sheer enormity of\nthe problem has fostered a surge of interest in the topic of\nprisoner training and reentry (Bucklen & Zajac, 2009). Given\nthe public health and public safety issues associated with\nreentry, developing policies and programs that promote suc-\ncessful reentry and prevent reoffending are indispensable for\na healthy community (Wheeler & Patterson, 2008).\nSeveral studies (e.g., Laub & Sampson, 2003; Tripodi,\n2010) have identified events, such as marriage and forming\nstrong ties to work, which can alter criminal trajectories.\nOther studies (e.g., Giordano, Cenkovich, & Rudolph, 2002;\nMaruna, 2001; van der Knaap, Alberda, Oosterveld, & Born,\n2011) have found evidence that psychological changes are\neven more important than keystone events in stopping or\nslowing down the rate of offending. Interventions that target\nantisocial attitudes, poor decision-making, problem-solving\nskills, self-control or self-regulation skills, association with\ncriminal friends, and substance abuse can reduce recidivism\nby upwards of 20 percentage points compared with programs\nthat ignore these needs (Andrews & Bonta, 2003). Bucklen\nand Zajac (2009) concluded, \"The greatest problem for\nparolees was managing themselves in a prosocial manner\nwhile facing demands from their environment\" (p. 239).\nCommunication can be a critically important element of\nprosocial behavior. A prime example, as described in the\nGeneral Aggression Model (C. A. Anderson & Bushman,\n2002), is the use of verbal aggression, a catalyst to physical\nassault among violent criminals (Infante & Rancer, 1996;\nToch, 1969). The use of verbal aggression is significantly\ncorrelated with the extent of resorting to physical assault (C.\nony offenses (Spillane-Grieco, 2000), and physical aggres-\nsion in correctional centers (Cornell, Peterson, & Richards,\nresearchers have found that a deficiency in verbal skills is a\nmajor cause of verbal aggression (e.g., Bandura, 1973;\n1969).

In this way, during con-\nflicts, there is no blame or fault assigned to either party.\nNVC has been extensively used to train educators, manag-\ners, mental health care providers, gangs, lawyers, military\nofficers, clergy, government officials, individuals, and\nfamilies (Rosenberg, 2003); it has also been used to train\nprisoners in the United States and other countries (Niebuhr,\n2001). Correctional facilities in Washington (Freedom\nProject, 2009), Oregon (Center for Compassionate Living,\nBritish Columbia, Denmark, and Sweden (Bryson, 2000)\nhave maintained their support and use of NVC for many\nyears There is a small but growing body of academic lit-\nerature, including research, surrounding the efficacy and\nimplications of using NVC within various contexts and\nTwo of the best-designed studies were carried out by\ninterventions involving NVC at maximum and medium\nsecurity forensic psychiatric units in Wisconsin. In both set-\ntings, Reimer found remarkable decreases in violence, use of\nrestraints, and involuntary seclusion on the ward when com-\npared with pre-NVC-training levels. A more recent study\ninvolving parolees showed that NVC training was associated\nwith significant increases in empathy .\nThe NVC process consists of four basic skills: (a) observ-\ning a situation without evaluation, (b) acknowledging the\naccompanying feelings, (c) understanding how those feel-\nings are a result of a met/unmet need, and (d) clearly request-\ning concrete actions and exploring how to honor all parties'\nneeds in a flexible and creative manner, without demands\nThese basic skills require mindfulness for their imple-\nmentation. Mindfulness meditation has been shown to ame-\nliorate aggression, anxiety, recidivism in prisoners, and drug\nuse (Alexander, Walton, Orme-Johnson, Goodman, &\n1998). Meditation and mindfulness have also been used suc-\ncessfully to help nonprison populations overcome intractable\nconflict (Horton-Deutsch & Horton, 2003), to help parents\nwhose children behave in particularly challenging ways\n(Koren-Karie, Oppenheim, & Getzler-Yosef, 2008), and for\ncounselors who work under stress (Christopher, Christopher,\nMindfulness has been described as \"the awareness that\nemerges through paying attention on purpose, in the present\nmoment, and nonjudgmentally to the unfolding of experi-\nMindfulness meditation can improve the capacity to regulate\nemotion, combat emotional dysfunction, improve patterns of\nthinking, and reduce negative mind-sets (Siegel, 2007, p. 6).\nSamuelson, Carmody, Kabat-Zinn, and Bratt (2007) offered\na vivid example of the beneficial effects of mindfulness-\nbased training in correctional facilities; this study examined\n1,350 inmates trained in mindfulness-based stress reduction.\nThe authors found significant pre- to post-training improve-\nments in hostility, self-esteem, and mood disturbances.\nThe body of research on mindfulness and the proven\neffects of NVC lead to the theory that mindfulness can sup-\nport NVC by increasing awareness, sharpening observational\nskills, and creating time and space to formulate a response; in\nturn, NVC can support mindfulness by decreasing violent\noutbursts that interfere with presence of mind.\nThe combination of NVC and meditation has been taught\nby Freedom Project in some of Washington State's correc-\ntion facilities. Freedom Project is a program for inmates run\nmostly by former inmates and volunteers. It has offered\nprison programs since 1999; there have been anecdotal\nreports of success and increased participation, but no formal\nstudies of the program's effectiveness. Freedom Project pro-\nvides introductory and advanced trainings in NVC and mind-\nfulness practices such as NVC study groups, support groups\nfor inmate facilitators, and multi-day theme-based work-\nshops on anger, empathy/self-empathy, reconciliation, con-\nnecting couples, and parenting. Inmates' participation in the\ntrainings is always voluntary, never obligatory (Freedom\nThe purpose of the set of studies presented here is to\nexplore the effects of the training offered by Freedom Project.\nThe first study examines the relation between training and\nrecidivism rates. The second study compares trained and\nuntrained inmates in their use of nonviolent communication\nskills during simulated and challenging social interactions;\nself-reports of mindfulness, self-care, and anger manage-\nment are also compared. These two studies are presented as\na unit because together they illuminate the effects of Freedom\nProject training for society and for individuals. The conclu-\nsions are strengthened by including different modes of mea-\nsurements, such as official records, behavioral observations,\nand self-report. The combined findings allow for the explo-\nration of whether the training is associated with improve-\nment during incarceration and upon release, as well as which\nspecific skills and attitudes change.\nGeneral Training Method\nFreedom Project's training of inmates is based on Marshall\nRosenberg's nonviolent communication approach that has\nSuarez et al. 3\nmaterials and specific activities used during the training have\nbeen compiled and published in the book Nonviolent\nCommunication (NVC) Toolkit for Facilitators (Gill, Leu, &\nPrisoners of the Monroe Prison Complex are offered\n2-day workshops every third weekend of every month. In\naddition, every month there are three, 3-hr evening classes in\nboth NVC and mindfulness. All classes are offered within\nthe prison compound. Workshops are either introductory or\norganized around themes such as conflict, empathy, healing,\nor couples and family relationships; all workshops include\nmindfulness. Teaching styles vary from trainer to trainer and\naccording to the workshop theme. Twice a year, specific\nmindfulness meditation workshops are offered as part of the\ntheme-based workshop series.\nClass sizes range from 15 to 25 participants, and work-\nshop participant numbers range from 20 to 45. All training is\ndone in groups and participation is always voluntary and\nmay be repeated. Freedom Project training is one of several\ntraining options offered to inmates in the Washington State\nprison system. Prisoners who have received NVC basic\ntraining are given preference for workshop participation;\nsome prisoners with long sentences have accumulated many\nhours of training. Freedom Project programs are open to all\nprisoners who choose to enroll. There are no early release or\nspecial treatment incentives offered for participation.\nThe program was not designed or conducted as a formal\nresearch study, and limitations imposed by administrative\nconstraints and the need to adapt to differences among the\nvarious prison settings necessitated some modifications. The\ntraining circumstances themselves are not optimal: for exam-\nple, the training rooms are usually small, cramped, hot in\nsummer, cold in winter, and with windows that do not open.\nIn the first study, we considered the relationship between\nFreedom Project training and recidivism. We compared the\npercentage of recidivism in trained inmates with the general\nrecidivism rates in Washington State for the same period. We\nhypothesized that inmates who had received training would\nhave a lower recidivism rate than those who were not trained.\nIn addition, we proposed that the number of hours of training\nin NVC and mindfulness might predict whether trainees\nwould reoffend or not when they reentered the community.\nMethod\nParticipants. Training data were collected on 1,315 inmates\nof the Monroe Correctional Complex in Monroe, Washing-\nton, including the Minimum Security Unit; the Twin Rivers\nUnit; and the Washington State Reformatory. Crimes leading\nto incarceration included sex offenses, drug crimes, burglary,\narmed robbery, assault, kidnapping, and murder. The Wash-\nington State Department of Corrections (DOC) supplied\ninformation about release and reoffenses for most of the\nsample inmates, except for 136 for whom data were not\nreported and 20 for whom some identifying information did\nnot match the training data. In addition, 274 of the trained\ninmates were not yet released from custody; recidivism\ncould not be studied for them. The final sample was com-\nposed of 885 inmates who were trained by Freedom Project\nvolunteer staff; complete release and reoffense data were\nknown on these inmates.\nThe 885 trainees included in this analysis were all men,\nthe date of their final training. Of the 885 trainees, 654 were\nAmerican Indian (3%), 17 were Asian/Pacific Islanders\n(2%), 1 was Eskimo, 6 were of other ethnicities, and 2 were\nof unknown ethnicities. Comparable demographic data for\nthe general prison population used as a comparison group\n(3.9%), Asian/Pacific Islanders (2.5%), and Other/Unknown\nbe White and less likely to be Hispanic than the general pop-\nulation, but otherwise were of comparable ethnicities. The\ninmates were trained an average of 35.2 hr (SD = 66.1, range\nResults\nvism rate; of the 5,999 general prison population inmates\n(Evans, 2010). In contrast, the DOC-reported data showed a\n21% recidivism rate for Freedom Project-trained inmates; of\nthe 885 inmates who were trained by Freedom Project and\nsubsequently released from prison, 188 had been returned to\nTo compare recidivism rates of trained and untrained\ninmates, the data for all prisoners released in 2000 by the\nWashington State DOC were corrected by eliminating the\nFreedom Project trainees released in that same year (N = 30)\nfrom the totals. A chi-square analysis revealed a highly sig-\nnificant trend, with fewer Freedom Project trainees returning\nto prison than expected and more from the general popula-\ntion returning to prison than expected, 2(1) = 84.2, p <\nyears, 89 (12%) had been released for between 2 and 3 years,\nBecause approximately 30% of the Freedom Project\ntrainees were sex offenders, and sex offenders may have a\n4 SAGE Open\nlower rate of recidivism for any crime than nonsex offenders\n(Hanson & Bussi\u00e8re, 1998), the data were reanalyzed to\ndetermine if recidivism remained lower for the Freedom\nProject trainees than for the general population of prisoners\nonce the sex offenders were eliminated from the analysis.\nFirst, the trainees were coded as sex offenders if any of the\ncrimes for which they were incarcerated in a Washington\nState prison was a sex crime (including \"Rape 1,\" \"Rape 2,\"\n\"Rape of a child 1,\" \"Other violation child sex,\" \"Nonviolent\nsex with child,\" \"Indecent liberties,\" and \"Sex Crime,\nother\"). The 268 released trainees coded as sex offenders\nreoffended at a rate of 11.2%, compared with a recidivism\nrate of 25.6% for the nonsex offenders. The chi-square was\nthen recalculated, eliminating the 268 sex offenders from the\n885 released trainees and comparing the recidivism rates of\nthe remaining 617 trainees. There was still a highly signifi-\ncant trend with fewer Freedom Project trainees returning to\nprison than expected and more from the general population\nA one-tailed t test assuming unequal variances was per-\nformed to determine if the number of hours of training dif-\nfered between the subgroup of the 885 trained inmates who\ncommitted a reoffense that returned them to prison (n = 182)\nversus the subgroup who were still released on December 31,\nfor outliers, using the definition of outliers as scores that\nwere greater than the mean plus three standard deviations for\nthe subgroup. Five outliers were identified and removed for\nthe subgroup that had been returned to prison, leaving data\nfor 177 trainees. Sixteen outliers were identified and removed\nfor the subgroup of those who were still released on\nwho returned to prison had significantly fewer hours of train-\ning (M = 20.6, SD = 10) than those who were still released\ntraining-hours data for both groups were positively skewed,\na nonparametric test of differences was also calculated that\ntranslates the training hours data (again with outliers\nremoved) to ranks for each group. Median training hours for\nthe group who did not reoffend was 19 hr, for the group that\nn\nDiscussion\nThe first hypothesis of Study 1 was that inmates who had\nreceived training would have a lower recidivism rate than\nthose who were not trained. This hypothesis was supported.\nWe chose to focus on recidivism data reported by Washington\nwhich trainees had to be released to study their reoffenses for\nthis study. By eliminating the counts of trained prisoners\nfrom the 2008 recidivism data, we had a recidivism rate for\nprisoners who were not trained. This general prison popula-\ntion comparison group had fewer members who claimed a\nWhite ethnicity and more who identified as Hispanic than the\nFreedom Project group. Despite the demographic differ-\nences, both the percentages of those reoffending (37% vs.\n21%) and the statistical analysis of frequencies led us to\nreject the null hypothesis that training made no difference in\nrecidivism. Recidivism as a measure has been criticized.\nFirst, the associations between crime, arrest, and imprison-\nment vary (cited in Gehring, 2000); therefore, reimprison-\nment as a sole measure of an individual's successive criminal\nactivities can be inaccurate. Race and socioeconomic status\naffect whether or not imprisonment occurs (Blair, Judd, &\nChapleau, 2004). Racial profiling might have allowed the\nHispanic members of the general prison population to be\nreimprisoned at a higher rate than the White members of that\ncomparison group. Second, outside-of-state convictions are\ngenerally not incorporated into within-state rates of recidi-\nvism. Finally, different states and different entities within a\nstate often use different definitions of recidivism (Evans,\ntwo limitations apply; however, the same Washington State\nDOC office produced the recidivism data for the trained and\nuntrained prisoner groups. While the proportion of sex\noffenders in the trained group was high (30%), even when\nthat subgroup was removed from the trained group data,\nrecidivism rates still differed significantly between the\ntrained group and the state-reported data for the general pop-\nulation of prisoners.\nThe second hypothesis that trainees who reoffended\nwould have fewer hours of training than those who did not\nreoffend was also supported. The nonnormal shape of the\ntraining hours distributions led us to rely on a nonparametric\napproach to conclude that the distributions of training hour\ndiffered significantly between those trainees who reoffended\nand those who did not.\nGiven the relationship between lower recidivism rates and\nFreedom Project participation, this second study considered\nwhat changes might have been brought about by the Freedom\nProject training in inmates. In other words, we were inter-\nested in knowing how the training worked and what effects it\nhad on individual inmates.\nWe hypothesized that inmates who underwent the NVC\nand mindfulness training, in comparison with untrained\ninmates, would show increased mindfulness, increased use\nof nonviolent communication skills when asked to address\ndifficult interpersonal interactions, increased self-compas-\nsion, and decreased anger.\nMethod\nParticipants' characteristics. This is a matched-pairs study that\ncompared inmates trained by the Freedom Project with\nuntrained inmates matched on key demographic variables.\nSuarez et al. 5\nThe 26 participants were male prison inmates at the Monroe\nCorrectional Complex in Monroe, Washington. At the time\nof their evaluation, their ages ranged from 24 to 66 years old.\nAll participants were Caucasian. To ensure that the partici-\npants understood all the questions and instructions correctly,\nonly inmates fluent in English were invited to participate. No\ninmate was ruled out due to participation in any other train-\ning program available in the prison. The crimes the inmates\nwere convicted of included rape, rape of a child, murder,\nindecent liberties, and assault.\nSampling procedures. The study used matched-pair sampling\nto look at the relationship between Freedom project training,\nand mindfulness and anger. The Trained group consisted of\n13 inmates selected because they had already undergone at\nleast one full cycle of training in mindfulness and NVC with\nFreedom Project, and because they had agreed to take part in\nthis study. The hours of training provided by the Freedom\nsisted of inmates matched and paired with the Trained group\nby crime category and age. The Washington State DOC\nselected matched untrained inmates from its files. The\nselected men were invited by Freedom Project to volunteer\nfor the study. When there was a pool of untrained inmates\nwho matched the same trained participant, only one of the\nuntrained men was included in the study. Untrained partici-\npants were randomly selected from the matched pool to form\ncomparable matched pairs. The final sample was composed\nof 26 Caucasian male participants who were matched on age\n(range = 24 to 66 years old, or 42 years) and crime category\n(rape, rape of a child, murder, indecent liberties, or assault).\nProcedure. This experiment was approved by the Washington\nState DOC's Institutional Review Board and Antioch Uni-\nversity Seattle's Institutional Review Board. In accordance\nwith the Institutional Review Boards'agreement, no identifi-\nable data were provided back to the Washington State DOC\nregarding an individually identifiable performance, comple-\ntion of participation, or if an inmate declined participation.\nEach inmate who showed up for the testing session received\na thank you letter and a chocolate bar, regardless of their\ncompletion of the testing protocol. Some participants did not\ncomplete all the assessments, in which case the data from\nboth members of the matched pair were eliminated from the\nstudy. In one case, there was a tape recorder malfunction,\nlimiting the number of role-plays available for scoring and\nanalysis. A total of 26 men took part in the study.\nFifty-five inmates were initially screened using the\nSymptom Checklist-90\u00adRevised (SCL-90-R; Derogatis,\n1983) to eliminate participants with psychotic features; none\nwere excluded from the study based on that criterion. Each\ntesting session took less than an hour and was conducted by\ntrained volunteers. The paper and pencil questionnaires were\ncompleted by participants in a group assessment session; the\nrole-plays were done individually and privately.\nMeasures.\nPaper-and-pencil questionnaires included the\nness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS; Brown & Ryan,\nand Aggression Questionnaire (BAAQ; Maiuro, Vitaliano, &\nCahn, 1987). Inmates also participated in a role-play involv-\ning difficult interpersonal situations; the role-plays were\nlogical symptom checklist. It is composed of 90 questions\nthat measure psychological distress. The checklist is based\non a 5-point Likert-type scale where a lower score indicates\nless symptom severity. The items are rated on a scale of 0\n(not at all) to 5 (extremely).\nThe MAAS is a self-report 15-item questionnaire devel-\noped by Brown and Ryan (2003) that is based on a Likert-\ntype scale where a higher score indicates increased\nmindfulness. Items are rated on a scale of 1 (almost always)\nto 6 (almost never). The MAAS has good convergent, dis-\ncriminant, and construct validity; internal consistency across\nsamples (explicit measures  = 0.85; state mindfulness  =\nBrown & Ryan, 2003). The MAAS indicates the presence or\nabsence of attention to and awareness of what is occurring in\nthe present; it does not necessarily indicate attributes such as\nacceptance, trust, empathy, or gratitude. Some sample\nMAAS items include \"I find it difficult to stay focused on\nwhat's happening in the present\" and \"I do jobs or tasks auto-\nmatically, without being aware of what I'm doing.\"\nThe Self-Compassion Scale (Neff, 2003) measures the\nability to recognize a broader human context and lessen self-\njudgment. It consists of a 26-item self-report questionnaire\nbased on a Likert-type scale where a higher score indicates\nmore self-compassion. The items are rated from 1 (almost\nnever) to 5 (almost always). The internal consistency of the\nSelf-Compassion Scale equals .92; it has good construct,\nconvergent, and discriminant validity; and it has a test-retest\nreliability of .93 (Neff, 2003). According to Neff's conceptu-\nalization and psychometric construction of the test, self-com-\npassion implies mindfulness and the Self-Compassion test\nincludes a Mindfulness subscale. The Mindfulness subscale\nparticularly measures over-identification with what is occur-\nring. Some examples of items from the Mindfulness subscale\ninclude \"When something upsets me I try to keep my emo-\ntions in balance,\" \"When I'm feeling down I try to approach\nmy feelings with curiosity and openness,\" and \"When I fail\nat something important to me I try to keep things in\nperspective.\"\nThe BAAQ (Maiuro et al., 1987) includes items that\naddress assault, indirect hostility, irritability, negativism,\nresentment, and verbal hostility. The BAAQ is a self-report\n6-item questionnaire based on a 5-point Likert-type scale\nwhere a higher score indicates greater anger. The items are\nrated on a scale of 0 (extremely unlikely) to 4 (very likely). It\nhas an internal consistency of .82 and reliability of .84. It\n6 SAGE Open\nprovides a good general measure of anger and dyscontrol\nbehavior (Maiuro et al., 1987). Examples of items include\n\"When I really lose my temper I am capable of hitting or\nslapping someone\" and \"When I get mad I say threatening\nand nasty things.\"\nThe role-play protocol is reported in Table 1 and scoring\ncategories in Table 2. The protocols were adapted, with per-\nmission, from Rosenberg's Nonviolent Communication: A\nLanguage of Compassion (1999). Six interviewers were\ntrained in how to instruct the participants on the task and\nintroduce the role-plays. The interviewers worked one-on-\none with each participant. A training scenario and two\nscorable role-plays were serially presented to each partici-\npant. Participants were allowed to respond to the protocol\nquestions at will. All the role-play responses were tape\nrecorded, transcribed, and coded by trained coders blind to\nparticipants' group memberships. The coders were two grad-\nuate students trained in the scoring protocol via education\nabout NVC concepts and scoring of mock responses until\nestablishing an inter-rater reliability of 75%.\nBased on the transcription, each phrase uttered by a partici-\npant was rated for the presence or absence of each of the four\nresponse criteria (Table 2); in other words, each phrase was\nrated dichotomously four times. The number of \"yes\" answers\nin each category represents the number of times the partici-\npants said a phrase that met that NVC evaluative criteria.\nResults\nA paired-sample t test for the SCL-R-90, which was used as\na pre-screening test, revealed no significant differences\nbetween the groups (M\ntrained\nuntrained\n=\nlevels of mental health symptomatology in both groups.\nTo look at the relationship among Freedom Project train-\ning and mindfulness and anger, we conducted a MANOVA\nTable 1.

A total of 90 phrases were uttered by\nall participants, which gave a grand total of 360 coded\nresponses.

Out of the 296\nresponses, 135 (46%) that were neutral or did not meet the\nNVC criteria were given by the trained participants. A chi-\nsquare analysis was highly significant, with more responses\ngiven by Freedom Project trainees meeting the NVC criteria,\nAs most of the phrases rated as \"Identifying and express-\ning own feelings\" were also rated as \"Taking responsibility\nfor own feelings\" and these two rating criteria might not\nhave been independent, the statistical analysis was repeated,\nexcluding the first category; in other words, a total of 90\nresponses (22 \"yes\" counts and 68 \"no\" counts) were dropped\nfrom the analysis, leaving 270 ratings. The chi-square analy-\nsis remained highly significant, with more responses given\nby Freedom Project trainees meeting the NVC criteria, 2(1)\nDiscussion\nAlthough mindfulness training is already well established as\nan intervention for inmates, we found that different measures\nof mindfulness tapped different concepts and resulted in dif-\nferent effects. The Freedom Project training had a significant\neffect on the mindfulness component of the Self-Compassion\nscale, which focuses on maintaining a balanced view of a\nsituation, in other words, on equanimity. No effects were\nfound on the MAAS, which is a mindfulness measure more\nconcentrated on attentional focus.\nSubstantial effects were noted on the BAAQ, indicating\nreduction in anger among inmates who had received Freedom\nProject training. The number of hours of training was signifi-\ncantly related to a reduction in anger.\nAccording to the role-play analysis, inmates who had\nbeen trained in the Freedom Project approach were signifi-\ncantly more likely to use nonviolent communication skills\nthan their untrained counterparts. Inmates who had received\ntraining were much more likely to identify and express their\nown feelings, to take responsibility for them, to be able to\nexplain their own needs or make requests without imposing\ndemands, and to express empathy. In other words, partici-\npants trained in the Freedom Project skills gave responses\nthat were not commonplace among the general prison\npopulation.\nSummary and Concluding Discussion\nThe aim of this article was to explore the effects of Freedom\nProject training. The first study investigated whether the train-\ning in mindfulness and nonviolent communication affected the\nrecidivism rate. Results indicated significantly less recidivism\namong former inmates trained by Freedom Project than among\nthose who were not. Even among trained men, those who were\nmore likely to return to prison had significantly fewer hours of\ntraining. Extrapolating, if 37% of returnees are expected to\nreoffend, but only 21% of Freedom Project trainees did so, and\nif the cost of keeping a man in prison is U.S. $98 per day, train-\ning by Freedom Project has saved the state of Washington\nWe also explored specific behavioral and attitudinal out-\ncomes of training that may prevent reoffending. The results\nof the second study found significant differences between the\ngroup of inmates trained by the Freedom Project and a\nmatched pair group of inmates with no training. The results\nare based on a small, matched-pair sample and are prelimi-\nnary. The study found that self-reports of inmates trained by\nFreedom Project showed significantly improved self-com-\npassion and mindfulness when compared with matched con-\ntrols as measured by the Self-Compassion Scale, but not as\nmeasured by the MAAS. The measurement of anger (BAAQ)\nshowed improvement: the more hours of training, the less\nanger expressed by participants. A replication with a larger\nsample is highly recommended. Behavioral observations\ndemonstrated very striking differences in the communica-\ntions styles of the trained and untrained groups, with Freedom\nProject trained inmates being significantly better able to use\nthe basic NVC skills of identifying and expressing their own\nfeelings, taking responsibility for them, and explaining their\nown needs without imposing demands.\nTable 3.

We believe the results from these studies are\nsuggestive of behavioral improvement and promising of\nhighly beneficial social impact of the training. We hope to\nsee further research continued. Recommended further\nresearch would include a replication of this study with a\nlarger population, placebo-controlled studies of recidivism\nafter training, process research including correlates with\nphysiological measures and analysis of the relationship\nbetween improvements in anger and nonviolent communica-\ntion skills on the one hand, and incidence of disciplinary\naction while incarcerated on the other. In addition, the gener-\nalizability of the second study can be improved by including\ndiverse cultural and ethnic participants. Random-assignment\ncontrol trial studies are also recommended, because of the\nproblem of self-selection into the training group.\n"
