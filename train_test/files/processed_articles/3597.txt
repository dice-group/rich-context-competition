The Union of South American\nNations (UNASUR) engages with regional health diplomacy (De Lombaerde and\nKingah, 2014), as does the World Health Organization (WHO) office in South East Asia\n(WHO, 2014a).How do we understand the role of the Southern African Development\nCommunity (SADC) in Southern Africa?\nThere is very limited evidence that SADC plays a role in regional health diplomacy\nand regional health governance through engagement with regional social policy. This\nrole is primarily played by donors partnered with national governments. There is, how-\never, a strong case to make for the more active involvement of SADC in regional health\ndiplomacy and governance, considering its capacity as a regional organisation, its role in\nthe creation of social policy, the presence of member states and member state funding,\nand its relationship with donors and multilateral organisations in the region.\nThis article presents new possibilities for the role of SADC in health diplomacy and\ngovernance, contributing to existing debates on the role of regional organisations in deter-\nmining health diplomacy and governance measures. The gaps identified in current literature\ninclude a lack of information on what SADC does specifically to advance regional health\ngovernance and Southern regional health diplomacy. We argue that SADC can play a more\nsignificant role in health diplomacy and governance in the Global South, through engage-\nment with regional social and health policies. The article shows this possibility by first\ndescribingtheglobalprinciplesofhealthdiplomacyandnichediplomacy.Itfurtherdescribes\nwhat role SADC plays in health governance in the region and finally shows how SADC can\nplay a stronger role in facilitating and coordinating health governance and diplomacy\nthrough social policy, based on the potential capacity it has as a regional organisation.\nThe evidence of the growth of multilateral regional organisations is significant and\npertains specifically to international integration and development coordination (Deacon\net al., 2010; Riggirozzi and Tussie, 2012; UN University Institute on Comparative\nRegional Integration Studies [UNU-CRIS], 2008). Regional organisations and regional\nsocial policy feature substantially in social policy literature which considers the role of\nregional organisations as global players and training hubs (Riggirozzi, 2012; Van\nLangenhove, 2012). Regional organisations contribute significantly to regional social\npolicy and programmes; for example, Latin American regional organisations have con-\ntributed significantly to transnational cooperation with regard to health surveillance and\nlabour migration (Deacon et al., 2010; UNU-CRIS, 2008). Regional social policy litera-\nture has focused on cross-border redistributive programmes (including employment pro-\njects, food programmes and social protection funds), policy harmonisation and provision\nConsidering the focus on regionalism in developing contexts, there is limited detailed\nknowledge of regional social policy and health diplomacy outside of the European Union\n(EU) context and specifically in terms of Southern regionalism in general and Southern\nAfrican regionalism in particular. In the health context, there is limited knowledge on\nsocial policy and a vast amount of information instead on regional economic integration\n(see Schiff and Winters, 2003; Te Velde, 2006). Policy research on SADC has not specifi-\ncally examined health issues and the opportunities for such regional policy commitments\nto be implemented and embedded in domestic social institutions and policy formation\nThere is a clear need for the paths of regional social policy and health diplomacy to\ncross. Regional health diplomacy speaks to the need for regional organisations to con-\nsider how they engage on issues of health, in the sphere of political diplomacy, but at the\nsame time consider how they engage on existing regional social policies and the creation\nof new policies which would promote access to healthcare and medicines in the region.\nThe article speaks specifically to how SADC can play more of a role in engaging regional\nsocial policy with regard to health governance and health diplomacy.\nThe emergence of health diplomacy in foreign policy\nThe WHO describes the creation of global health diplomacy as an emergent practice that\nidentifies and understands changes that influence global public health, as well as capac-\nity building for WHO member states, to support collective action to mitigate health risks\n(WHO, 2015). Global health diplomacy has its roots in the creation of the Global Fund\nto Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis (TB) and Malaria, President's Emergency Plan for AIDS\nRelief (PEPFAR), the Global Health and Foreign Policy Initiative and the Oslo Ministerial\nThe Group of Eight (G8) industrialised countries established the Global Fund to Fight\nAIDS, TB and Malaria in 2002 to increase international funding for intervention to deal\nwith these diseases. Funding was primarily sourced from the United States. An amount\nlion initiative to fight HIV/AIDS, mostly in Africa. PEPFAR is arguably the largest inter-\nvention ever undertaken by a single country to address a disease. PEPFAR positioned the\nUS government as a major supporter of activities to counter AIDS in the Global South.\nBy 2008, the programme had provided treatment to 2 million people in 15 focus coun-\ntries, 12 of which were African (PEPFAR, 2009). PEPFAR and the Global Fund are two\nkey examples of global health diplomacy in action.\nThe practice of global health diplomacy also extends to niche areas for emerging\nmiddle-power foreign policy. These areas are useful for health diplomacy, as they can\nextend middle-power foreign policy presence. The Global Health and Foreign Policy\nInitiative and the Oslo Ministerial Declarations were presented in September 2006 and\nMarch 2007, respectively. The importance of global health is communicated as being\n`the most important and yet still broadly neglected, long-term foreign policy issue of our\ntime...' (St\u00f8re et al., 2007). Health is prioritised as a key element of foreign policy and\ndevelopment in the Oslo Declaration. Priorities outlined in the Oslo Declaration apply to\nall regions and contexts, including the SADC region.\nBeyond the Oslo Declaration: Health diplomacy in the last\nSeven years after the Oslo Ministerial Declarations, health diplomacy has become criti-\ncally important for foreign policy, national governments and regional organisations.\nHealth diplomacy ensures the involvement of foreign affairs ministries, because of the\nrelevance of health for the exercise of soft power (or the ability of states to coerce other\ncountries into mutual cooperation or treaties by providing aid for health or access to\nhealth programmes), security policy, and trade, environmental and developmental poli-\ncies. Countries have to address trans-border issues that threaten global stability, includ-\ning pandemics and climate change. Health is of national and economic interest, reflecting\npressures on national sovereignty and global collective action.\nA key example of the emergence of new actors and funding in global health is the Bill\nand Melinda Gates Foundation. By 2007, the Foundation's budget had surpassed that of\nthe WHO. The Foundation forms part of a new global health governance elite, or the\nHealth-8 (H-8), which includes the WHO, the World Bank, the Global Alliance for\nVaccines and Immunisation (GAVI), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the\nUnited Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the Joint United Nations Programme on\nHIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the Global Fund. Global health governance and diplomacy\nemphasise cultivating unique connections among state and non-state actors acting trans-\nnationally. These partnerships reflect how health diplomacy offers `new mechanisms to\nimplement ambitious global health initiatives while at the same time securing favourable\nperceptions in a changing diplomatic space' (Katz et al., 2011). The Global Health\nProgramme 2012, launched by the Geneva-based Graduate Institute, represents a defin-\ning moment in global health diplomacy training. The programme provides courses for\ndiplomats, health attach\u00e9s and international organisation staff. WHO staff participate in\nthe programme and individual states such as Turkey and China are getting involved with\nMiddle powers from the Global South have the power to challenge the status quo\n(Jordaan, 2003). Countries such as Brazil, Mexico, South Africa and Turkey can poten-\ntially change the global health agenda by reforming as opposed to radically changing\nwhat already exists. Key examples of where health reform has been successful for a mid-\ndle power include Canada, Brazil and South Africa. Canada has integrated global health\nissues into their foreign policies, as part of preparation processes for the World Health\nAssembly (WHA), the Pan-American Health Organisation (PAHO) and the Summit of\nthe Americas. The Canadian government has also led funding and support for initiatives\nsuch as the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), the Canadian Access to\nMedicines Regime, the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative and additional input on\nthe International Health Regulations and maternal and child health (with additional focus\non sexual and reproductive rights (the Muskoka initiative) (Canada'sAccess to Medicines\nBrazil and SouthAfrica were instrumental in signing of the Global Health and Foreign\nPolicy Initiative as well as the Oslo Declaration. As noted previously, these middle pow-\ners played a key role in determining the parameters of global health diplomacy.\nConsidering South Africa's position in SADC, the region has a powerful place in the\nGlobal South to enact these resolutions (Fourie, 2013). Brazil also formally recognised\nthe right to health in the Brazilian constitution and made health a central foreign policy\ntheme. When antiretroviral (ARV) drugs for HIV/AIDS treatment became available in\n1996, the Brazilian government pushed for access to ARV drugs for all HIV-positive\npeople in the country. Brazil worked closely with other countries in the Global South,\nincluding the Treatment Action Campaign, to grant licences for local generic production\nof ARV drugs, despite being in breach of the Agreement on Trade-related Intellectual\nProperty Rights (TRIPS). Brazil also participated in the FCTC, providing leadership and\nSADC, as an emerging regional organisation, should prioritise health as part of the\nregional policy agenda. We have noted above that donors and international organisations\nhave played a more active role in assisting with healthy policy and programme imple-\nmentation than SADC does. The article argues that SADC, as a regional organisation, is\npositioned to be a more integral presence to the creation of regional social policy, in\ntandem with regional health governance and through additional positioning as a global\nhealth diplomatic actor.\nRegional health governance in Southern Africa: The role of\nSADC\nSADC health governance relates to basic principles of SADC's origins. SADC objec-\ntives are intended to `promote sustainable and equitable economic growth and socio-\neconomicdevelopment'(SADC,2014)throughregionalintegration,effectivegovernance\nand productive systems among the 15 member states.\nThe predecessor to the Southern African Development Community Conference\n(SADC), was established in 1980 to promote economic regionalism, development\nmember state took responsibility for a particular sector instead of a regional economic\ndevelopment strategy. The `sectoral responsibility approach' resulted in decentralisa-\ntion of the structure and the creation of the secretariat in Gaborone, Botswana\n(Ostergaard, 1990; Schoeman, 2002). The SADCC was viewed as a `service organisa-\ntion' rather than a regional leadership body. This structure made sense politically, how-\never, as each state was enabled to contribute equally to development across the region.\nSADC Secretariat was established in 2001 to centralise the governance processes of\neach member state, whereas previously each member state had been responsible for a\nsector, as noted above. The restructuring process created complications in trying to\nassign responsibility for sectors to specific programmes housed at the Secretariat\nPallotti describes SADC as being a development community without a development\npolicy (Pallotti, 2004). Since 1992 and the dissolution of the SADCC, SADC has strug-\ngled to find a cohesive approach to regional integration and development. This is exac-\nerbated by the lack of internal and external communication in the organisation. The\ncompetition between member states for private sector investment and development inter-\nventions, along with internal political struggles and economic imbalances, has resulted\nConsequently, the political economy of development and the political economy of\nhealth in the region are largely influenced by donors from the Global North. This is evi-\ndent by the large number of aid organisations responsible for coordinating HIV/AIDS\nplans and projects. Despite this, overseas development assistance (ODA) to the SADC\nregion has declined in the past few years, with member states having to shoulder a large\npercentage of development funding for their countries. Millennium Development Goal 8\n(MDG8) to develop a global partnership for development in the SADC region identifies\nthis decline. ODA has decreased despite the high debt burden in the SADC region. Aid\nthe levels of ODA, public expenditure on health and total bilateral flows from donors in\nSouthernAfrica (African Development Bank, 2014) The graph indicates a slight increase\nin public expenditure, with fairly significant decreases in ODA. Despite this, the amount\nof donor funding is still fairly evident in the region.\nSADC member states are responsible for financing their own health budgets and health\nremains prioritised at a national level, with international support and limited SADC sup-\nport. There is no specific SADC organisational budget for health policy, as policy is coor-\ndinated adopting a bottom-up approach. The money received consists of contributions\nfrom SADC member states and donor funding, which is then used by the Secretariat in the\ndevelopment of relevant regional protocols. External finance and foreign aid have encour-\naged transformation within SADC (with support in particular from the EU, Finland, the\nFigure 1.

External\n(Gray, 2013). The Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP) is said to\nemulate EU policies of integration and development and is determined by the material\ndependence of SADC on the EU (Lenz, 2012). As such, donors and governments work\ntogether to develop SADC-specific policies and protocols, identified in the next section,\nwhich are the foundation for regional health governance in Southern Africa. Perhaps this\nsupport is still what SADC requires as a regional organisation. At this stage in SADC's\ndevelopment, donor aid is essential for sustaining regional health policies and systems\nstrengthening.\nSADC health policies\nThe SADC Health Protocol forms the cornerstone of regional health governance. It out-\nlines commitments to combating communicable and non-communicable diseases in the\nSADC region. As such, a number of declarations, plans and strategies have developed\nfrom the protocol, detailing specific goals in combating the disease burden in the SADC\nregion. These mechanisms act as frameworks for Southern African regional governance.\nThese plans are detailed in Table 1.\nThe SADC Protocol on Health (signed on 18 August 1999) is the driving document\nbehind health in the SADC region. SADC recognises that `a healthy population is a\nTable 1.

Member states acknowledge that regional cooperation for health\nis indispensable for controlling communicable and non-communicable diseases and to\naddress common concerns in the region (SADC, 2014). The major policy documents\nwhich complement the Health Protocol are the Health Policy Framework and the RISDP.\nRegional governance in the global health sphere \u00ad The\nMDGs and sustainable development goals (SDGs)\nThe challenges identified speak to global efforts to manage health effectively. The\nMDGs represent the efforts of the global health diplomatic community to address the\nhealth challenges in the Global South. The MDGs, most importantly Goals No. 1, 4,\n5 and 6, are seemingly unattainable in the SADC region by 2015. The SDGs, born out\nof the Rio+20 Conference (United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development),\nbuild on the MDGs by focusing on coherent action for economic, political and socially\nsustainable development. Health is a priority sustainable development theme. Key\nsocial issues in the SADC region, which the SDGs intend to address, are high inci-\ndences of HIV/AIDS and related diseases and poor health service delivery (Sachs,\nFindings from a study commissioned by the UN, African Union (AU) and the African\nDevelopment Bank find that the primary use of the SDGs should be to inform their coun-\ntry's budgets and allocate more resources to SDGs that are not making progress. A second-\nary use would be to balance economic, social and environmental pillars in policymaking.\nThe study emphasises the need for SADC to draw attention to the SDGs to define national\npolicy priorities, review the influence of national policies and address pressures that lead to\nunsustainable development and guide development cooperation (Gandure and Kumwenda,\nEffective implementation and achievement of the SDGs will only be advanced by\neffective coordination of regional organisations, in partnership with national govern-\nments and donors. Considering the weak returns of the MDGs in Southern Africa, SADC\ncan, with the correct support and coordination, step up to assist and ensure that national\ngovernments can strive to achieve the SDG targets and eventually maintain capacity to\ndo so without foreign support. Resources and political resistance are problematic, but the\npositives of effective regional health governance outweigh these challenges.\nFive considerations for SADC as a regional policy actor\nWe posit that SADC has the potential capacity to play more of a role in health diplomacy\nand social protection in Southern Africa and in the Global South without support from\nforeign donors. To do so, we argue that if SADC implements the following recommenda-\ntions for their health agenda, this role could have a greater bearing on regional health\ndiplomacy and governance through regional social policy. To enable SADC to partici-\npate as a competent regional power for South\u00adSouth health diplomacy and act as a social\nprotection champion, we make a number of recommendations which could change how\nSADC engages with health intra- and inter-regionally.\nCivil society\nThe SADC Secretariat and health division need to engage further with civil society, non-\nprofit organisations and citizens to ensure that the views of citizens are considered\nequally. The Oslo Declaration, in identifying health as a `pressing foreign policy issue',\ncalls for recognition of the processes by which the government, multilateral organisa-\ntions and civil society position health in foreign policy deliberations for health govern-\nCivil society should be positioned to challenge government decisions and SADC min-\nisterial decisions. Considering the difficulties experienced in democratic governance in\nSouthern Africa, the role of civil society must become a priority in the regional organisa-\ntion to uphold democratic values and to ensure that the health interests of citizens are\nmet. Labont\u00e9 and Gagnon indicate that civil society can challenge corporations promot-\ning tobacco, alcohol and obesogenic foods, considering the damage they inflict on soci-\netal health. Canada and Brazil have set precedents for this in their work for the FCTC (as\nnoted above). If SADC were to partner strongly with civil society to regulate the intro-\nduction and sale of harmful commodities, the distribution of goods and awareness of\npotential dangers could be better monitored and regulated (Gods\u00e4ter, 2015; Labont\u00e9 and\nThe increased role of civil society in public health is also attributable to a perceptible\nweakening of state authority as a consequence of globalisation and the strengthening of\ntransnational corporations (Lee, 2010). Civil society is responsible for promoting `trans-\nnational' support for public interests in global health issues. Continued pressure from\ncivil society in the SADC region creates the possibility to allow for public participation\nin policies and processes, which have traditionally been siloed at a ministerial level\net al., 2010). The demand for SADC accountability and responsiveness to citizen outputs\nmakes the work of civil society increasingly more prominent.\nThe growth of civil society in addressing health issues also represents a shift in devel-\nopment processes. Health development requires careful consideration of the relationship\nbetween state and society. The 1978 Alma Ata Declaration represents one of the most\nsignificant developments in public health, particularly regarding recognition of citizen\nparticipation in health systems as a central tenet to primary healthcare, recognising the\nrole of organised social action for securing health gains. White and Banda provide an\nexemplary explanation on the role of central civil society organizations (CSOs) in health\ngovernance, suggesting that CSOs have a better picture of human and technical needs\nand capabilities. Partnering with communities has the potential to increase returns on\nhealth and agriculture. CSOs can also play a role in disease surveillance. The example\nprovided refers to the monitoring of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) out-\nbreak since the Chinese government was not willing to disclose the magnitude of the\noutbreak, leaving the WHO reliant on non-governmental organisation (NGO) and CSO\nreporting on epidemiological information (White and Banda, 2006). The UN High Level\nPanel on Civil Society also advocates for increased cooperation between government\nand civil society. SADC would do very well in taking this engagement to heart to further\nengage on issues of access to healthcare and medicines.\nSADC has the capacity to act as civil society champion in the region. SADC could\nassist in coordinating civil society platforms by potentially creating a civil society advi-\nsory desk, in this case for health organisations. Civil society agendas can be promoted by\na specific SADC civil society advisory body to ensure that concerns are addressed at a\nministerial level and also to include civil society matters on government agendas. South\nAfrica, as the most powerful SADC state, could lead a civil society initiative to ensure\nthat civil society agendas are addressed at inter-ministerial and government levels. There\ncould alternatively be rotating custody of this responsibility.\nTrade\nIn order to compete globally and regionally, SADC needs to advance its trade agenda in\nthe region in order to compete with other regional blocs and globally. The SADC Trade\nProtocol is viewed as ineffective in eliminating non-tariff barriers (NTBs), which nega-\ntively influence trade in the region in general but more importantly the movement of\npharmaceuticals and health products (Brenton et al., 2005; Kalenga, 2000; KeaneCali\nAs a regional trade market, SADC provides opportunities for the promotion of eco-\nnomic development of scale in production and services. Health issues, including com-\nmunicable disease control, drug purchases, health personnel migration, AIDS response,\ndisease surveillance and supply of resources, are being addressed from national, regional\nand international perspectives. Despite this, trade restrictions within SADC continue to\nhinder movement of medical purchases.\nThe 1996 SADC Trade Protocol established a Free Trade Area in SADC, imple-\nmented in 2008. Continued efforts have been made on tariff-reduction schedules, rules\non the origins of goods and services, elimination of NTBs, customs harmonisation pro-\ncesses, trade documentation mechanisms and dispute settlement mechanisms. Despite\nthese efforts, national macroeconomic policies have increased inequalities in the region,\nparticularly regarding income, employment and access to education, water and non-\nhealth sector inputs into health-related issues. Additional inequalities stem from une-\nqual land ownership, distribution and access to resources. Historical structural\nadjustment policies and market reforms have also influenced public expenditure, creat-\ning high levels of healthcare inequalities. Continued lack of access to healthcare has\naggravated the poverty\u00adhealth nexus, with the state playing a weakened role as health\nThe SADC Secretariat would benefit from using its allocated health budget for preven-\ntion mechanisms, access to primary care infrastructures and services, focused deployment\nof health personnel to regions in crisis and consideration of redistribution of resources\nbetween public and private health sectors. Deacon et al. (2007) argue that a serious con-\nsideration of challenges to social policy would include identifying appropriate national\nsocial policy responses in order to channel resources to those sectors that need them. This\nincludes identifying reforms for social policy institutions including SADC, which focus\non health, education, employment and income maintenance (Deacon et al., 2007).\nThe SADC Secretariat should channel financial resources into addressing these\nreforms for the healthcare budget, in line with addressing social policy challenges in the\nregion. This is also emphasised in policy recommendations by the Centre for Disease\nControl (CDC) with regard to emergency responses to disease control. The CDC sug-\ngests countries need to increase the presence of health personnel and systems infrastruc-\nture on the ground to mitigate against the threat of rapid disease transmission, as occurred\nwith Ebola (Centre for Disease Control, 2014). This is also suggested by the Institute for\nSecurity Studies, who recommend the need for allocated funding in developing countries\n(Institute for Security Studies, 2014). This pertains specifically to the SADC region and\nthe SADC Secretariat should heed these recommendations. In order to do this, the SADC\nSecretariat should consider integrating with a regional economic and trade regime and\ngenerating further support for states to maintain health systems. This takes into account\nthe tripartite free trade discussions which occurred between SADC, Common Market for\nEastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the East African Community (EAC) in\n2012 and the final communiqu\u00e9 between the first COMESA-EAC-SADC Tripartite\nSummit in 2008 (SADC, 2012c). Health-promoting trade must facilitate equitable out-\ncomes of private and public health services. This will become imminently more possible\nwhen SADC strengthens its negotiating power and capacity in trade frameworks, chal-\nlenge global trade regimes which exclude Southern interests, build non-economic and\ntrade regimes within the region that drive internal growth, and strengthen global integra-\ntion terms for the Southern African region.\nThis is not a very easy process to facilitate, considering the dominance of SouthAfrica\nin the region. The lack of balance in the region is a cause of concern, considering the\ntariff advantages for South Africa, cross-border informal trade and limited benefits of\nintra-regional trade. Other SADC countries actively use NTBs to block trade, as these\ncountries vie for markets. Certain countries fear that their economies will be undermined\nby cheaper goods in the region and have failed to eliminate NTBs (Keane et al., 2010).\nThe SADC region has been cited as being unprepared for trade liberalisation. The result\nof applied NTBs is low regional trade and resultant poverty in the trading bloc. NTBs\nrestrict product standards and rules of origin. Borders are still a major obstacle to regional\nSADC should consider advancing its trade agenda, focusing on facilitation of technol-\nogy transfer in the Global South. SADC countries need to consider how to rejuvenate\ntheir economies in order to generate revenue to afford innovative ways of addressing\nhealth issues using new technology and skills (Fourie, 2013). Regional integration\nefforts, including COMESA, SADC and Southern African Customs Union (SACU),\nhave all attempted to liberalise trade to increase bilateral trade flows and diversify\nexports. Continued attempts to harness regional integration will assist in lowering costs\nfor all countries. This will assist increased access to health and pharmaceutical products,\nconsidering the current lack of standardisation for these products.\nSADC could potentially act as a trade negotiation body between multilateral trade\norganisations, setting the trade agenda. This is pertinent in the light of the problem with\naccess to pharmaceuticals in the SADC region. There is a lack of harmonisation, regula-\ntion and distribution of pharma-products, including the granting and processing of import\npermits, multiple drug regulatory authorities, offshore drug trials and bioequivalence\nstudiesforgenericsinlocalpopulations,registrationfeesandtheWorldTradeOrganization\nTRIPS agreement on drug access and its implementation in the region (Economic\nSADC can assist by acting as an intermediary and potentially establishing a regional regu-\nlatory body to manage and harmonise differing drug registration authorities and regula-\ntions in the region.\nTraining health professionals\nStrengthening SADC's role in global health diplomacy could also allow for a greater\nfocus on training and retaining health professionals. Of critical concern is the lack of\nqualified health personnel in the region. A renewed focus on the role of the SADC could\naddress the disproportionate distribution of doctors and nurses in developing regions.\nThis is particularly pertinent in Southern Africa, considering the high percentage of HIV/\nAIDS and other communicable diseases and the `brain drain' of health personnel to\ndeveloped nations each year. Alarmingly, on the African continent there are a mere 2.3\nThis imbalance is reflected in the high infection and mortality rates across the continent.\nSADC can take a proactive role by pushing for renewed focus on health personnel within\nthe region, including providing incentives for professionals to remain in Southern Africa\nA lack of skilled health professionals results in a non-functional healthcare system,\nparticularly in the public sector, at primary levels of care. Southern African health sys-\ntems are confronted with scarcity and/or unequal distribution of health personnel. There\nare inadequate ratios of personnel to population for skilled health personnel and uneven\ndistribution of personnel between public and private sectors, urban and rural areas and\nThe move of healthcare workers from lower to higher income countries (within\nSouthern Africa and the Global North) has resulted in increased international migration,\nwhich creates further inequities (Gilson and Erasmus, 2005).\nThe push and pull factors influencing migration include low remuneration, increased\nwork risks, including HIV/AIDS and TB, unrealistic workloads, inadequate infrastruc-\nture and working conditions (Padarath et al., 2007). Country situations, including politi-\ncally repressive environments, taxation, increasing crime levels and poor service delivery,\nalso play a role in motivating health professionals to leave.\nWHO statistics indicate that 31 African states fail to meet the `Health for All'minimum\nstandards of one doctor per 5000 people (USAID, 2003). This is an additional concern,\nparticularly regarding political will, budgeting for healthcare concerns and provision of\nhealth personnel. Within Southern Africa, there is wide variation in health personnel per\ncountry \u00ad for example, more doctors in South Africa than in Lesotho, more nurses in\nBotswana than the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This issue has called for South\u00ad\nSouth prioritisation of human resources, staff exchanges in the SADC region and increased\ndialogue on migration. Specific goals include improving understanding of migration,\nincreased attention to strengthening SADC capacity to manage migration and, of course,\nincreased focus on addressing the issues causing mass migration in the first place.\nSADC can act as a regional champion for health personnel and regulation of health\npersonnel in Southern Africa. There is scope for improving personnel trade, employment\nand movement. The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) provides scope to\nnegotiate multilateral governance protocols. GATS creates a system of international trade\nrules to ensure equitable treatment of participants, to stimulate the economy of members\nand to promote trade and development through liberalisation. Using this effectively with\nSADC at the helm, trade can work to revive the health sector in Southern Africa.\nTraining for health diplomats\nA SADC-led training programme for health diplomats may also be a hypothetical solu-\ntion for focused South\u00adSouth health diplomacy management. Training for SADC coun-\ntry representatives could take place at inter-ministerial meetings and elected diplomatic\nrepresentatives could benefit from advanced health diplomacy training to `prepare pro-\nfessionals'to manage global health challenges. If such a programme was established and\nsuccessful, SADC could potentially offer these services to other South\u00adSouth organisa-\ntions to learn from other countries' challenges as well.\nThe University of Pretoria currently offers the only formal postgraduate programme\non diplomacy. This training could be expanded to include health diplomacy and links\ncould be set up between other Southern African university institutions for diplomat train-\ning programmes region-wide (Fourie, 2013).\nThis level of training has been achieved successfully by the Graduate Institute in\nGeneva and is endorsed by the WHO. Training of health diplomats provides key skills\nfor regional health issues to address challenges faced by developing regions and to\nachieve the requisite levels of successful health governance and diplomacy. Practical\nexercises addressed specific global health achievements including the FCTC, Resolutions\non Trade and Health and WHA resolutions. This has been successfully attained in other\nregions, and SADC would benefit from this to bolster the number of qualified health staff\nto engage on issues of regional governance (Fidler, 2007; Kickbusch et al., 2007a; WHO,\n2015). The SADC Secretariat is ideally placed for this role, considering its central loca-\ntion and support role for the 15 member states.\nParticipation of South Africa and a PAHO\nSouth Africa is a major player in SADC. South Africa's status as an emerging middle\npower is important for the region, considering South Africa's role in Brazil, Russia,\nIndia, China, South Africa (BRICS) and India, Brazil, South Africa (IBSA). South Africa\nis in a position to put SADC on the map as far as health diplomacy is concerned, consid-\nering its importance as a regional organisation in the Global South. South Africa is ide-\nally positioned to create closer ties with Brazil and other emerging middle powers to\nalign common goals for health diplomacy. If South Africa and SADC were able to posi-\ntion the region to reflect positively on middle-power potential, particularly at the WHA,\nthis could also demonstrate middle-power capacity to set the official health diplomacy\nagenda as opposed to responding to a top-down approach from the Global North (Fourie,\nSouth Africa, as a regional hegemon, could follow the example of South American\nstates and set up a regional institution focusing on health issues within SADC. In Latin\nAmerica, the PAHO is a key example of a coordinated regional health presence respon-\nsible for technical cooperation among states and mobilisation of partnerships to improve\nhealth and quality of life. It is described as being `the specialised health agency of the\nInter-American System' (PAHO, 2015) and acts as the WHO Regional Office for the\nAmericas. As a comparison, a pan-African organisation focusing on health could effec-\ntively address health challenges, instead of health being relegated to a departmental cor-\nridor in the SADC Secretariat. This organisation could be funded by the Chinese\ngovernment or partner with other middle powers in the Global South.\nFurther and future points to consider\nOpportunities for SADC are by no means limited to these five recommendations.\nAdditional considerations include SADC involvement in the manufacture of generic\nmedicines, acting as a representative to engage with big pharmaceutical companies.\nSADC can champion the regional generic drugs manufacturing industry, engage with big\npharmaceutical companies globally and advocate for the provision of cheaper medicines\nfor impoverished communities. SADC can learn from the examples set by norm entre-\npreneurs in India and Brazil in engaging with pharmaceutical companies and reducing\nthe price of patents on medicines (Fourie, 2013). This could strengthen SADC's position\nin the region and strengthen the case for reduced prices on medicines.\nThis could also promote the creation of an integrated health system. SADC has a man-\ndate to harmonise national health policies (SADC, 2014). However, the creation of a\nSADC-specific regional health organisation with a specific mandate to provide regional\nhealthcare protocols to guide national policy will allow for a coordinated regional response.\nThis is pertinent, considering the mobility of populations in the region, the rapid spread of\ndiseases across mobile corridors and country borders and the lack of coordinated health-\ncare responses, resulting in disparities in treatment and access to care and medicines. It is\nimportant to consider both inter- and intra-regional responses to healthcare in this case.\nWhat is not mentioned in the debate relative to regional health diplomacy and the\npresence of regional health organisations is the prevalence of regional health organisa-\ntions, which have the capacity to act as intermediaries for the WHO and the WHA. The\ninclusion of these organisations and their capacity to shoulder health issues as repre-\nsentatives of the WHO may take some of the burden off the WHO, allowing for specific\nfocus on the social determinants of health per region. SADC could again be instrumental\nin leading this initiative. Coordinated interaction with donors may allow a regional focus\nrather than national or multilateral focus. Acting in a coordinated regional manner could\nadvance the way that countries interact with external benefactors.\nConclusion\nRegional social policy creation with specific focus on health governance and health diplo-\nmacy needs a strengthened participatory body, to facilitate and coordinate policy develop-\nment. SADC, as a regional organisation, is ideally positioned to take on the creation and\nmanagement of regional social policy, regional health governance and diplomacy. However,\nSADC has experienced significant challenges regarding integration and development and\nreliance on international partners. In order to shoulder the mantle of regional governance\nresponsibility, SADC needs to make a number of changes, as outlined in the article. If these\nissues are addressed, SADC can strengthen its potential to manage South\u00adSouth health\ndiplomacy and regional governance, creating a stronger South\u00adSouth bloc and redefining\nthe health agenda on a global scale.\nSADC has the potential to act as a leader in South\u00adSouth health regionalism. However,\ndespite the many treaties and protocols in place, SADC is reliant on donors, development\naid and external interventions for health governance management. Multilateral health\nsecurity and diplomacy should encourage active participation from SADC and Southern\nAfrican ministers to ensure a coordinated approach for focused health initiatives. There\nis little evidence to suggest that SADC engages with the international health community\nas a regional diplomatic power, considering SADC's reliance on the international health\ncommunity for support. We acknowledge the challenges faced by SADC in the form of\npolitical differences, a lack of resources and continued conflict in the region. If govern-\nments form partnerships to address these challenges using donor money correctly, the\npotential to create beneficial change outweighs the problems that the challenges create.\nReferences\nAfrican Development Bank (2014) Socio-economic database.
