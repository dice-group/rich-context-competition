Foster and colleagues have documented\nthe commercial value of underage drinking and adult ex-\ncessivedrinkingtothealcoholindustry,butnoresearchhas\ndocumented the combined commercial value of underage\ndrinking and adult pathological drinking to the industry.\nIn this article, we close this gap in research. First, we\nreexamine the incidence of underage and adult drinking.\nNext, we consider the proportion of underage and adult\ndrinking that can be clinically characterized as abusive and\ndependent drinking as well as the percentage of alcohol\nconsumedbysuchdrinkers.Finally,wedocumentthecom-\nmercial value of underage and adult abusive and depen-\ndent drinking to the alcohol industry as well as the com-\nbined commercial value of underage drinking and adult\nabusive and dependent drinking to the industry.\nMETHODS\nWe relied on several national data sets to help define the fol-\nlowing: (1) the number and proportion of underage and adult\ndrinkers; (2) alcohol consumption by underage and adult drink-\ners as well as by underage and adult drinkers with alcohol abuse\nand dependence; and (3) the cash value of underage drinking\nas well as of underage and adult abusive and dependent drink-\ning to the alcohol industry.\nTo compute alcohol consumption by age group, we first used\nthe 2000 US Census19 to estimate the number of people in the\nTo estimate the proportion of people aged 12 to 20 years\nwho drank in the past month (ie, current drinkers), we con-\nsidered several data sets, including the 2001 National House-\nBehavior Survey (YRBS).21 The NHSDA, administered by the\nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,\nRockville, Md, used a nationally representative sample of 55 561\npersons aged 21 years and older. The YRBS, administered by\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga,\nused a nationally representative sample of 13 601 persons in\n(if the participating high school students were older than 18\nyears, they were recoded as 18-year-olds). We concluded that\nthe YRBS data are the most accurate for purposes of estimating\nthe proportion of underage individuals (aged 12-20 years) who\nstrated that the NHSDA data tend to underestimate the pro-\nportion of underage drinkers who consume alcohol and the\namounts they consume since it is based on personal inter-\nviews performed in a household and because children are only\ninterviewed when a parent is in the home. The YRBS provides\nmore accurate estimates because it is administered in schools,\nwith the added benefit of anonymity, and because of the order\nand content of the survey questions.22-27\nToestimatetheproportionofpersonsaged21yearsandolder\nwho drank in the past month, we used the 2001 Behavioral Risk\nFactorSurveillanceSurvey,28 whichwasalsoadministeredbythe\nCentersforDiseaseControlandPrevention.The2001Behavioral\nRisk Factor Surveillance Survey is a telephone survey of 212 510\nWeusedthe2001NHSDAtocomputetheamountofalcoholcon-\nsumedbyunderageandadultdrinkers,theprevalenceofabusive\nand dependent drinking as defined by DSM-IV criteria, and the\namountofalcoholconsumedbyunderageandadultdrinkerswith\nalcoholabuseanddependence.TheNHSDAaskedthefollowing\nquestionsaboutalcoholconsumption:\"Thinkspecificallyabout\nthe past 30 days--that is, since (fill in date), up to and including\ntoday. During the past 30 days, on how many days did you drink\n1ormoredrinksofanalcoholicbeverage?\"and\"Onthedayswhen\nyoudrankduringthepast30days,howmanydrinksdidyouusu-\nally have? Count as a drink a can or bottle of beer; a wine cooler\noraglassofwine,champagne,orsherry;ashotofliquor;oramixed\ndrinkorcocktail.\"TheNHSDAalsoincludedtheitemsnecessary\nfor a DSM-IV diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence.\nWe defined pathological drinking according to the DSM-IV\ncriteria for alcohol abuse and dependence. The NHSDA asked\nrespondents about the 4 domains related to alcohol abuse, de-\nfined by the DSM-IV as \"a maladaptive pattern of substance use\nmanifested by recurrent and significant adverse conse-\nquences,\"3 and the 7 domains related to alcohol dependence,\ndefined by the DSM-IV as \"a maladaptive pattern of substance\nuse leading to clinically significant impairment or distress.\"3\nA respondent was labeled as abusing alcohol if he or she ex-\nhibited any 1 of 4 conditions in the previous year. The respon-\ndent was labeled as substance dependent by the DSM-IV crite-\nria if the respondent exhibited 3 or more of 7 conditions at any\ntime in the previous year.3\nTo estimate consumer expenditures linked to underage drink-\ning and to underage and adult drinkers who met or did not meet\nthe DSM-IV criteria for abusive or dependent drinking, the total\namount (in gallons and liters) of beer, distilled spirits, and wine\nconsumed by each group in 2001 was calculated using data on\nconsumer expenditures for alcohol reported by the alcohol in-\ndustry and published by Adams Business Research.29-31\nEstimating the cash value of underage and adult drinkers also\nrequires information on the proportion of the type of drink (beer\nvsdistilledspiritsvswine)consumedbyunderageandadultdrink-\ners and by those who met vs did not meet the DSM-IV criteria\nforalcoholabuseordependence.Toourknowledge,nodatadocu-\nmenting the proportions by type of alcoholic beverages con-\nsumed by underage drinkers aged 12 to 18 years are available.\nHowever, Foster et al18 found that the pattern of drinking among\nunderage drinkers aged 12 to 20 years closely resembles the pat-\ntern of drinking among adult excessive drinkers.\n\u00a92006 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nWe estimated patterns of alcohol consumption using the 2001\nto 2002 National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Re-\nlated Conditions (NESARC).32 This nationally representative sur-\nvey of those aged 18 and older, administered by the National In-\nstitute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, asked participants to\nidentify type of drink by the categories of beer, distilled spirits,\nwine, and \"coolers\" of all types. Because the price of coolers is\ntypically similar to that of beer,33-35 we redistributed the percent-\nage of cooler consumption into the beer category, producing con-\nsumption estimates for adults who met the DSM-IV criteria for\nabuse or dependence of 70.8% beer, 18.3% distilled spirits, and\n10.9% wine whereas other adult drinkers consumed 56.1% beer,\n16.7% distilled spirits, and 27.2% wine. Using this same data set,\nwe found that underage drinkers (aged 18-20 years) who met the\nDSM-IV criteria for abuse or dependence consumed 79.6% beer,\n17.5% distilled spirits, and 2.9% wine whereas other underage\nwine. We applied the estimated beverage type computed among\nthose aged 18 to 20 years to all of the underage drinkers.\nTo present a range of estimates of the cash value of underage\nand pathological drinking, we also used the NESARC to com-\npute alternative estimates of drinking rates, consumption, and\npathological drinking rates among adults aged 21 years and older.\nTocalculatetheamountofalcoholconsumedbyunderageandadult\ndrinkers who met and did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for alco-\nhol abuse and dependence, we followed a basic formula:\nTi\n=Pi\nAi\nCi\n, where Ti\nis the total estimated number of drinks\nconsumed in the past 30 days by those in the ith age category, Pi\nis\nthe estimated proportion of the population in the ith age category\nwho drank in the past 30 days, Ai\nis the mean number of drinks\nconsumed by drinkers in the ith age category in the past 30 days,\nCi\nisthenumberofpeopleinthepopulationintheith agecategory,\nandolder.Tocomputetheseequations,weestimatedthenumber\n)\nusingthe2000USCensusdata,andwemultipliedthatbythepro-\nportion of those who drank in the past 30 days (ie, Pi\n) using the\nioralRiskFactorSurveillanceSurveydataforadults.Wethenmul-\ntipliedtheresultingnumbersofpeopleaged12to20yearsandthose\naged 21 years and older who drank in the past 30 days by the es-\ntimatedmeanamountofalcoholconsumedamongdrinkerswithin\nthe age category (ie, Ai\nalizedtheresultstocomputethetotalnumberofdrinksconsumed\nby persons aged 12 years and older.

Because the NESARC did not include\npersons aged 12 to 17 years, we continued to use the YRBS\ndata to estimate drinking rates and the NHSDA data to\nestimate drinking amounts and pathological drinking rates\namong underage drinkers. In this alternative analysis, we\nfound that underage drinkers and adults who met the\nDSM-IV criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence to-\nbillion) of all of the consumer expenditures for alcohol.\nCOMMENT\nThere are several limitations of our research. First, sev-\neral data sets were used to derive various estimates for\nyouth and adults. Although it would have been prefer-\nable to have 1 source of data, thereby controlling for pos-\nsible moderating factors such as item construction,\nmethod of administration, and time, no such single data\nsource exists. Therefore, as in other research of this na-\nture, we used the data sources that provided valid esti-\nmates of all of the quantities of interest and provided a\nconservative and alternative estimate. All of the data that\nwe used were publicly available national data sources.\nWe also made several assumptions about the propor-\ntion of each type of alcoholic beverage consumed by the\nvarious age and drinking groups. More research is clearly\nnecessary, especially among underage drinkers, to obtain\ndirect estimates of consumption amount by type and cost.\nThe operational definition of the term drink also needs fur-\nther exploration. The estimates produced by the NHSDA20\nwere based on the number of drinks of wine, beer, or dis-\ntilled spirits whereas alternative approaches (the 2001-\nthe study by Dawson37) were based on the actual size of\nthebeverageconsumedratherthanonthenumberofdrinks.\nFor the alcohol industry, increases in alcohol consump-\ntion come either from new customers or from increased\ndrinking among existing customers. This analysis demon-\nstrates that early initiation of alcohol use provides substan-\ntial financial value to the alcohol industry in both areas.\nTheshort-termcashvalueistheimmediatereturnofatleast\n$22.5 billion in consumer expenditures linked to alcohol\nconsumed by minors--ie, new customers. Because these\nunderagedrinkersarelikeliertobecomeadultdrinkerswith\nalcohol abuse and dependence, the longer-term cash value\nofearlyinitiationistheirsignificantcontributiontothe$25.8\nbillion per year in consumer expenditures for alcohol con-\nsumed by adult drinkers with alcohol abuse and depen-\ndence--ie, increased drinking among existing customers.\nAlmost all (96.8%) of the adult drinkers with alcohol abuse\nand dependence began drinking prior to the age of 21\nyears.20 The combined annual worth of all underage drink-\ning(includingabusiveanddependentdrinking)andalladult\nabusive and dependent drinking to the industry is at least\nalcohol,withalternativeestimatessuggestingthatthesecosts\nexpenditures for alcohol. Projected into the future, this\npresent pattern of illegal underage drinking and adult abu-\nsive and dependent drinking will realize at least one-half\ntrilliondollarsincashrevenuesforthealcoholindustryover\nthe next decade--an extraordinary commercial motive to\ninsure that such consumer behavior continues unabated.\nThe drinking behavior of 25.9% of the underage drink-\ners already met clinical criteria for alcohol abuse and de-\npendence. Although youth aged 12 to 20 years composed\nup 30.1% of all of the drinkers in the United States who\nmet the DSM-IV criteria for abusive and dependent drink-\ning. Of the $128.6 billion in consumer expenditures for al-\nof market sales, came from drinking on the part of adults\nandchildrenwhomettheDSM-IVcriteriaforalcoholabuse\nand dependence in the past year. A drinker with alcohol\nabuse and dependence is 3 times more valuable to the al-\ncohol industry since such drinkers consume 3 times the\namount of alcohol that other drinkers consume.\nWith at least 37.5% of sales linked to underage drink-\ning and adult abusive and dependent drinking, the alco-\nhol industry has a compelling financial motive to attempt\nto maintain or increase rates of underage drinking. Alco-\nholadvertisementsinmagazines,forexample,exposeyouth\n27% more advertisements for distilled spirits than adults\nof legal drinking age.38-40 The same pattern of overexpo-\nsure of children relative to adults with advertisements for\nbeer and distilled spirits also can be seen in radio and tele-\nvision advertising.41,42 Furthermore, exposure of children\nand teens to magazine and television alcohol advertise-\nments has increased, even more so for girls than boys, de-\nspite national reports43-45 calling for limits on advertising\nby the alcohol industry to children and teens younger than\n21 years. Allegations that the alcohol industry profits from\nunfair and deceptive marketing practices aimed at under-\nage drinkers to assure this flow of profits is the subject of\nseveral lawsuits filed against the alcohol industry.46-48\nThe financial interests of the alcohol industry appear to\nbe antithetic to the public health interests of the nation in\npreventing and limiting pathological drinking. The public\nhealth implications of this research are two-fold.
