In this article, I am focusing particularly on the life stories of youths and adults before they were referred\nfor an ADHD assessment. A narrative analysis of a body of empirical data material shows that the subjects' stories about\nthe background for their referral are dominated by three themes: substantial health-related disorders and problems, diffuse\nsensations that \"something\" was wrong, and experiences relating to their identification with the diagnosis. The study shows\nthat most of the respondents had been in contact with their regular general practitioner (GP)--and in many cases had tried\nout various diagnoses and treatments--long before the question of ADHD was raised.\n",

The term ADHD did\nnot appear in the diagnostic manuals until the end of the\n1980s.1 Furthermore, the medical definition of the condition\nhas, traditionally, primarily been concerned with children.\nThe description of the clinical symptoms in the diagnostic\nmanuals is still colored by this tradition (The Norwegian\nria for the diagnosis were altered, so that ADHD was defined\nas a lifelong condition. As a result of this, it became possible\nfor adults to be diagnosed with ADHD. In 2005, adults in\nNorway were given the same access as children and youths to\nmedical treatment with psychostimulants. The access to an\neffective pharmacological treatment may have contributed to\nthe diagnostic assessment appearing more meaningful and\nattractive, which in turn may have contributed to a rise in the\nnumber of ADHD assessments among youths and adults.\nAdults (aged 19 years or older), thus, constitute a rela-\ntively new group among those who can be diagnosed with\nADHD. In line with the immediate consequences of the\nabove-mentioned changes, it turns out that the largest rela-\ntive growth in the number of Norwegian users of ADHD\nage group \"19 years or older.\"2 The remarkable thing about\nthose referred for a diagnostic assessment as youths or adults\nis that while they have already lived for a long time with this\ncondition, they have lived without the ADHD diagnosis.\nAs suggested above, there are several plausible explana-\ntions for this development. Similarly, there are theories on\nthe interaction between the diagnostic categories and the\npeople within a society that supply adequate explanations of\nempirical research has also shed more light on different\naspects of the diagnostic assessment of adults. This research\nincludes descriptions of typical challenges for adults with\nADHD, and underlines the importance of the diagnostic\nassessment and treatment for the adults'self-image, and their\nability to handle these challenges (Fleischmann & Miller,\n2013). It has been documented that the same symptoms and\nchallenges are registered in the various life phases both in\nNorth America and Europe (Brod, Pohlman, Lasser, &\nHodgins, 2012). It has also been proven that students may\nstruggle to handle their \"medicated selves\" (Loe & Cuttino,\n2008), that adults may learn how to take advantage of their\nADHD idiosyncrasies in a positive manner (Fleischmann &\nFleischmann, 2012), and that it seems difficult to develop an\neffective test or method to uncover instances of misdiagnosis\n(Musso, Hill, Barker, Pella, & Gouvier, 2014). It is, however,\nharder to come by empirical investigations that help describe\nspecific events and courses of events in the individual\n1University of Nordland, Bod\u00f8, Norway\nCorresponding Author:\nBj\u00f8rg Mari Hann\u00e5s, Faculty of Professional Studies, University of\nEmail: Bjorg.mari.hannas@uin.no\nYouths' and Adults' Stories Related to the\nBackground for ADHD Assessment\nBj\u00f8rg Mari Hann\u00e5s1\n Keywords\nAttention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), life stories, key events, identification, health issues\n2 SAGE Open\nprocesses of youths and adults, preceding and leading up to\nthe diagnostic ADHD assessments.

This dissertation is based on\na comprehensive qualitative study. In this article, I would like\nto--based on empirical material from the same study--focus\nespecially on particular experiences from the histories of\nyouths and adults before they were referred forADHD assess-\nment. The main research question is as follows:\nResearch Question 1: What is the background for youths\nand adults being assessed for ADHD?\nMethodological and Analytical\nApproach\nThe referred study is based on semi-structured interviews.\nThis is a form of interviews characterized by open-ended\nquestions, where the informants are given the opportunity to\nraise their own topics during the conversations. Both this\ninterview form--explicitly and implicitly encouraging the\nsharing of personal experiences--and the subsequent analy-\nsis of the narratives in the autobiographical stories are\nstrongly influenced by a narrative approach to the research\nIn collaboration with the adult psychiatric and children and\nyouth psychiatric clinics, the public educational psychology\nservice and the Norwegian interest organization for ADHD,\n19 respondents aged 14 to 57 years were recruited to the inter-\nview study. Two criteria were defined for participating in the\nstudy. First, the participants had to have been referred for a\ndiagnostic ADHD assessment as youths or adults. Second,\nthey should be aged 19 years or older. In three cases, I chose to\ninclude participants below the age of 19; specifically, two\n14-year-olds and one 17-year-old. This was done at the request\nfrom the psychologists that helped recruit participants, as they\nfelt that these youths would be well suited for participation in\nthe study. The respondent group is comprised of 10 partici-\npants who had already completed their diagnostic assessment\nsome time (on average about 2.5 years) before I interviewed\nthem. These participants were interviewed once each. The\nremaining 9 participants were referred for ADHD assessment\nat the beginning of the interview study. These participants\nwere interviewed both before and after their diagnostic assess-\nments.4 In the analysis, the data material is handled as a whole,\nwith no distinction between the two sub-groups of partici-\npants. The interview study spanned over a period of about 1\u00bd\nyears. At the time of completion, 15 of the 19 participants had\nbeen diagnosed with ADHD (see Table 1). One participant\n(Ida, 42) had her suspicion of ADHD disproved by her diag-\nnostic assessment. Another (Carl, 23) elected to abort the\nassessment because it was too problematic to carry it out dur-\ning working hours. A third (Hanna, 40) was still waiting for\nthe final conclusion of her assessment. Finally, a fourth\n(Therese, 19) had asked for an assessment to get rid of an\nADHD diagnosis she had had for several years; an effort that\nproved successful. The analysis in the study is conducted on\nthe data material in its entirety, that is, all of the interviews\nwith everyone of the 19 informants.\nAll of the interviews were audio-taped. The recordings\nhave been transcribed into texts where other forms of mean-\ningful expression, for example, gestures, pauses, intonation,\nand so on, are indicated as well. The empirical material con-\nsists of 33 interviews, each lasting between 1\u00bd and 2\u00bd hr. In\naddition, an interview log-book has been kept, and notes\nTable 1.

These notes have\nsupported the processing of the data material, which was\nconducted by the author. All of the participants have been\nsupplied the results of this processing, and were invited to\nrespond to the presentation of the data before publishing.\nSeveral participants replied that they felt represented cor-\nrectly. None replied with critical comments or objections to\nthe presentations.\nThe narrative approach upon which the study was founded\nwas clearly reflected in the transcribed texts. The transcrip-\ntions showed that each interview more or less consisted of an\narray of autobiographical narratives of shorter or longer\nduration. The narratives represented various personal experi-\nences that referred to specific events--or sequences of\nevents--at different times or phases in the lives of the indi-\nviduals. Most of the narratives were easy to identify, in the\nsense that they, for example, had a clear beginning and a\nmarked ending. This was, among other things, manifested\nthrough different forms of \"entrance and exit talk\" (Riessman,\ncommon overall theme of the conversations: \"life with\nADHD--before and after the diagnostic assessment,\" a\ntheme that the participants had been made familiar with prior\nto the interviews. This contributed to connecting different\nnarratives within each interview to a personal life story.\nTo gain an overview of the contents of the transcribed\nmaterial, the different narratives in the 19 life stories were\nfirst identified and classified using different codes. These\ncodes were not pre-defined, but rather created as needed in\nthe course of the classification process. After coding the\nwhole raw material, I was left with 26 different codes. These\ncodes had been labeled according to the actual content or plot\nin the narratives, for example, \"movies/TV,\" \"brain damage,\"\n\"medication,\" \"clutter,\" \"different,\" \"conversations,\" \"dis-\ntress,\" \"school,\" \"work,\" \"friends,\" \"family,\" and so on.\nIn actual life, different events and actions follow each\nother in chronological order. Over time, a string of such hap-\npenings may create--or seem to create--a certain course of\nevents. The connections between the various happenings\nencompassed in such a course of events are, in reality, not\nnecessarily of a deterministic or causal character. Still, it\nturns out that \"earlier happenings are, however, often retro-\nspectively seen as a precondition for later happenings\"\ngraphical narratives, the \"story,\" however, does not follow\nthe actual or chronological order of the specific happenings\nor \"events.\" In autobiographical narratives, especially those\ndealing with the important experiences in life, the author\ntends to continually move back and forth in time. The author\ndigresses, and supplies personal commentary and evalua-\ntions in the course of the narrative (Riessman, 1993). To gain\nan overview of the chronological order of events, the coded\nnarratives were systematized based on the actual time of the\nvarious events in the life stories.\nThe form of narrative causality described above contrib-\nuted to some specific narratives from the time preceding the\nreferral appearing, in retrospect, to constitute plausible\nexplanations for the referrals for diagnostic assessment. In\nthe same way, the narratives concerning the assessment and\nthe result of this, appeared to be a natural explanation or con-\nsequence of the narratives concerning different sorts of dif-\nficulties and challenges.\nAfter identifying which narratives functioned as reasons\nor explanations for the narratives regarding the referral, the\nempirical material was reduced by keeping these narratives,\nwhereas the other narratives, in this context, could be elimi-\nnated from further analysis.\nThe remaining narratives were then systematized into dif-\nferent main categories and sub-groups, based on an analysis\nof the themes of the narratives. During this part of the analyti-\ncal effort, one narrative could occasionally be placed several\nplaces at once. The final result of the analytical process\nuncovered three main themes emerging from the participants'\nnarratives of the background for their ADHD assessment.\nAutobiographical narratives may, for several reasons,\noften deviate from the actual events they refer to. One partial\nexplanation for this may be that the narratives are situated\ninterpretations of earlier experiences, and that insights\ngleaned from later events may contribute to a retrospectively\nfounded interpretation of earlier events. The narrative of one\nspecific experience may, in this way, change from one situa-\ntion to another (Horsdal, 1999). The autobiographical narra-\ntives, in other words, do not reveal the past the way it really\nwas. On the contrary, they reflect the meaning which the\nauthors at any given point in time--consciously or uncon-\nsciously--attribute to earlier events in their own lives. Even\nif they do not represent any sort of objective truth, the auto-\nbiographical narratives are still required to have some sort of\ncredibility. One of the main requirements of the autobio-\ngraphical narratives is a level of consistency that makes them\nappear--and be accepted by others--as trustworthy: \"The\nhistorical truth of an individual's account is not the primary\nissue. . . . `Trustworthiness' not `truth' is a key semantic dif-\nference: The latter assumes an objective reality, whereas the\nformer moves the process into the social world\" (Riessman,\nAs pointed out before, there are weaknesses, too, associ-\nated with a narrative form of analysis. In this context, the\nadvantage is the ability to take the narrative's creation of\nmeaning more into account in the analytical work than a more\ntraditional coding and categorizing of the textual material\nwould allow.6 One of the main functions of a narrative is that,\nthrough both its form and its contents, it contributes to config-\nuring or creating meaning in life (Horsdal, 1999). A more tra-\nditional approach to the textual material, \" . . . by taking bits\nand pieces, snippets of a response out of context\" (Riessman,\n1993, p. 3) would reduce the ability to take into account the\nparticipants' interpretations of meaning: \"Precisely because\nthey are essential meaning-making structures, narratives must\n4 SAGE Open\nbe preserved, not fractured, by investigators, who must\nrespect respondents' ways of constructing meaning and ana-\nlyze how it is accomplished\" (Riessman, 1993, p. 4).\nThere is no single specific method or approach to narra-\ntive analysis. On the contrary, there is a range of different\napproaches to texts of a narrative character. Furthermore,\nnarrative methods combine well with other forms of qualita-\ntive analyses (Riessman, 1993). As can be gleaned from the\nabove description, I have combined elements from a tradi-\ntional form of cross-sectional analysis (from Grounded\nTheory, cf. Glaser & Strauss, 1967), with elements of Labov's\nmethod for analysis of personal narratives, in the course of\nprocessing the empirical data.7\nThree Main Themes of the\nAutobiographical Narratives\nThe analysis showed that three main themes dominate the\nbackground narratives of the youths and adults. The first\ntheme refers to various types of health-related disorders\nand problems. This is a main theme in 14 out of the 19 life\nstories. The second theme is a sort of diffuse sensation of\nnot being quite like everyone else, and that \"something\"\nmust be wrong. This is a main theme in 10 out of the 19 life\nstories. Last, the third main theme is identification. This\ntheme covers the way the participants themselves, at a cer-\ntain point, started identifying with the ADHD diagnosis.\nIdentification is a main theme in every one of the 19 life\nstories. In 8 of the 19 life stories, both health-related disor-\nders and problems and diffuse sensations show up as paral-\nlel main themes. In 2 of the life stories, identification is the\nsole main theme. In these cases, the participants empha-\nsized that they had not experienced any specific difficulties\nor challenges prior to their referral for a formal ADHD\nassessment.\nA more detailed presentation of the three main themes is\ngiven below. The in-text quotes are supplied as representa-\ntive examples of how different aspects of the three main\nthemes were expressed throughout the empirical material.\nHealth-Related Disorders and Problems\nHealth-related disorders and problems turned out to be a pro-\nnounced theme in 14 out of the 19 life stories. Common for\nthese 14 life histories are the descriptions of longer periods\nof time characterized by various sorts of illness and health-\nrelated issues and problems. The analysis shows that, in most\ncases, the respondents' problems started a long time before\nan assessment for ADHD became a relevant question. The\nnarratives include descriptions of numerous health-related\nissues, and the diverse consequences of these. In one respect,\nthe narratives refer to the participants'personal experience of\ntheir own ailments, spanning a broad specter; from different\nsomatic complaints like fever or pains, to problematic mood\nswings and feelings of total exhaustion. A recurring experi-\nence in these narratives is spoken of as \"hitting the wall\" or\n\"having a breakdown.\"\nKari (28): So I had a--. I hit the wall, as they put it. . . . It was\njust that I couldn't, uh--both be a mother, and a housewife, and\nbe a wife at the same time! . . . That was how I felt. At my lowest\npoint. And then they [medical professionals] started with the\nmanic depressive and all that sort of stuff. (Hann\u00e5s, 2010,\nIn another respect, the narratives refer to how other peo-\nple, especially physicians and medical professionals, per-\nceived, interpreted, and defined these challenges in different\ncircumstances:\nLinda (46): I don't know if there's anything they haven't\nassessed me for, let me put it like that. . . . But there's been--yes,\nbrain tumor and arthritis several times--and MS--and he [the\nregular GP] started talking about this ME and fibromyalgia.\nUpon meeting with the health care services, the partici-\npants' issues have been interpreted as symptoms of several\ndifferent disorders, but among the most frequently men-\ntioned are depression, bipolar disorder, burnout syndrome,\nand chronic fatigue syndrome. Several of the participants\nhave received other diagnoses, and tried different treatments,\nsuch as lithium, antidepressants, or tranquilizers, before\nbeing referred for ADHD assessment.\nJune (30): Because, you know, I've had \"type two bipolar,\" and\nI've had \"borderline,\" and I've had \"personality disorder,\" and\nthen I've had--. Yeah, because every time I've been in contact\nwith the psychiatrists, I've ended up with a new diagnosis.\nThe participants often seem to have been skeptical\ntoward--or disagreed with--the doctors' assessments.\nSeveral informants neglected to try out medication that they\nwere prescribed based on diagnoses that they were basically\nskeptical of:\nRigmor (41): I went to my regular GP. . . . he gave me happy\npills. . . . I did not feel depressed. And I did not have any fear of\ngoing out for coffee or any of those things. . . . I did not take that\nOthers, like June (30), said that they had tried the pre-\nscribed medication, but rejected it as it did not do them any\ngood: \" . . . I said from the beginning that I wanted out of the\nlithium, because it didn't help my depressions\" (Hann\u00e5s,\nThe first and foremost characteristics of the many stories\nof illness, however, are the comprehensive and dramatic con-\nsequences these health-related issues had for the individuals.\nPeriodically, they made the participants quite incapable of\nfunctioning adequately in everyday activities, both at home\nand at work. They were drained of energy, and consequently\nmany had to take sick leaves. Several participants told they\nhad been more or less bed-ridden--in some cases up to a full\nyear.\nAn overview showing how many of the participants who\nended up on sick leave or disability pension illustrates both\nthe degree and the magnitude of their challenges tied to\nhealth-related issues. Table 1 gives an overview of the\nrespondents' participation in education and work at the time\nwhen the interview study finished. The bracketed numbers\nfollowing the names indicate the age of the informants at the\nbeginning of the study. The columns marked \"Diag.\" indi-\ncate who had or had not been diagnosed with ADHD by the\nend of the study.\nTable 1 shows that 12 out of the 19 participants were either\non sick leave or disability pension, and that 9 of them were\ncompletely out of education or work life. Furthermore, it\nshows that 7 out of the 19 informants were neither on sick\nleave nor disability pension. However, it should be pointed out\nthat most of the participants who were neither on sick leave\nnor on disability pension (4 out of 7) were under education.As\nsome of these participants also spoke of health-related prob-\nlems, this might indicate that the educational system is more\ntolerant or flexible with regard to individual adaptation needs,\ncompared with work life. It should also be noted that the table\nshows that just 3 out of the 19 participants were working full-\ntime, and that 2 out of these 3 were among those who were not\ndiagnosed with ADHD by the end of the study.8\nDiffuse Sensations\nThe majority, that is, 10 of the 19 life stories, contained nar-\nratives of various childhood experiences, circling the topic of\nbeing set apart and feeling different from other people. No\nanalytical categories had been pre-defined before the study,\nand neither was this a theme that the participants were\nencouraged to illuminate in the course of the interviews,\nunless they broached the subject themselves. Still, diffuse\nsensations emerge as the second main theme of the narratives\nof the background for ADHD referral.\nThe recurring theme of these narratives is the diffuse, but\nnevertheless constant feelings in the participants that some-\nthing had to be wrong with them. Many of these narratives\nstart out with memories from early childhood. They may be\ntied to very different practical situations. The common denom-\ninator is the experience of being different, and coming up\nshort--most often as a consequence of some sort of deviation\nor breach between their own or others' expectation (general\nnorms) and their own social performance. In some narratives,\nthis description is specified as difficulty controlling their own\nbehavior in a socially acceptable way in certain situations or\ncontexts. Typical of other narratives is that the respondents\nthemselves do not really understand what it is they are doing\n\"wrong.\" For example, Hanna (40) told me that she noticed a\nlong time ago that others--interacting with her--tended to\nreact with raised eyebrows or shrugs, and subsequently with-\ndrawing from her; however, she had no idea why they did this.\nHanna was one of several respondents who told me she had\nstruggled to gain and keep friendships in the way her peers\ndid, both in her childhood and her youth. When Hanna started\ntelling me about the background for finally being referred for\nADHD assessment, she began her story thus:\nHanna (40): I was seriously starting to wonder if I was retarded,\nyou know! . . . And the way people reacted to me, I was\nwondering: Is my head muddled? . . . Am I stupid!? (Hann\u00e5s,\nIn other instances, however, the participants had managed\nto put together some of what it was that others were reacting\nto. Not uncommonly, this tends to be about the participants,\nin various contexts, behaving too actively, engaged or ener-\ngetically compared with general norms of social interaction.\nThis was expressed in different ways, but often, as exempli-\nfied by Sina's (34) story below, there was some sort of\nobservable physical activity. In this excerpt, Sina casts light\non a childhood memory, introduced by a little story about her\nown daughter:\nSina (34): My youngest daughter is very active. . . . And it hurts\nme so damn much when people comment: \"Can't you get her to\nshut up? Can't you make her sit still? Man, that girl of yours is\nactive!\" . . . Because I remember those comments from when I\nwas little. Like when mom and they were in the kitchen smoking\nwhen they had guests: \"Are you kidding me, you haven't had\nthat girl of yours checked yet!\" And then I wondered if I was\nactually a mongoloid--and they hadn't told me. Because I was\nThe narratives in this category are often about the partici-\npants finally wondering whether their brain is not working\nthe way it should. This interpretation can be said to be\nstrangely consistent with the medical assumption thatADHD\nis caused by a neurobiological failure in brain function. The\nmedical explanation for ADHD thus turned out to represent a\nreasonable rationale in the self-understanding for some of the\nparticipants. Mariann (33), for example, began our conversa-\ntion with some reflections on the following memory:\naround thinking I had a brain injury, but that no one dared tell\nme. I probably felt that something was not quite right, but I\nAfter a long conversation, she finished her story by telling\nme about her own reaction when she was diagnosed:\nMariann (33): It was a relief to get it. . . . 'Cause I got . . . uh, like\n. . . this feeling that I had a brain injury--that they wouldn't tell\nme about--I had it! . . . In a way. . . . The fact that I was going\n6 SAGE Open\naround feeling different and . . . that things were . . . were odd.\nLike, . . . I felt a little bit good about finally knowing that there\nactually was a reason. It wasn't because I uh--[pretended]. Like:\nI was different! And it was a good feeling [to get this confirmed].\nAlong with the narratives above referring to descriptions\nof concrete suspicions of disorders and brain impairment,\nthere are other examples of less specific descriptions and\nmore direct statements, such as this,\nNora (33): . . . since I was really young, I've felt that [drawing\na deep breath]: I'm not like them! I'm not like the others! I'm\nIdentification\nThe background narratives about identification deal with\nhow the participants at some point themselves identified\ntheir challenges with the ADHD diagnosis. This event turned\nout to have taken place at very different times in the various\nlife stories. All of the 19 life stories contain narratives with\nthis main theme. An eye-catching feature about these is that,\ngenerally, the participants themselves were the ones who\nasked to be referred for assessment. Only in 3 of the cases it\nwas a worker in the specialist health service who first sug-\ngested ADHD assessment. For most participants, then, the\nprocess of identification with the diagnosis in other words\nstarted well before--and completely independently of--the\ndiagnostic assessment of the individuals.\nFrom the narratives about health-related disorders and\nproblems, it was evident that most participants contacted\ntheir regular general practitioners (GPs) because of various\ntypes of somatic or psychological symptoms or complaints.\nThe fact is that several participants were actually diagnosed\nwith and treated for various other disorders before ADHD\nwas ever suspected. In many cases, the follow-up of their\nown children, already in the process of being diagnosed with\nor treated for ADHD, seems to have had a crucial role in a\nprocess where the parents eventually related their own prob-\nlems to their children's diagnosis. For example, Hanna (40),\nwho had a son diagnosed with ADHD 2 years prior to our\nfirst encounter, supplied the following background for her\nasking for ADHD assessment for herself:\nHanna (40): When [he got his diagnosis] we enlisted him in the\nADHD association, and received a lot of brochures and such.\nAmong those was one about girls and women. I put that aside,\nbecause I thought that this has nothing to do with him! Heh! . . .\nAnd then I stumbled upon that brochure again later while cleaning.\nAnd I thought I would just have a look in it, before throwing it out.\nAnd then I had one of those--. \"Wow, what is this,\" I thought.\nInstead of throwing the brochure out, Hanna put it aside.\nThe next time she happened to come across it, she plucked\nup her courage, and asked to be assessed for ADHD. All in\nall, 12 (eventually, 13) of the 19 participants in the study had\nchildren of their own. Some of the children were still babies;\nhowever, out of these 12, there were 7 participants who had\nat least one child with an ADHD diagnosis before they them-\nselves were referred for assessment. In most cases, the par-\nents identified with some descriptions of ADHD in women\nor adults, supplied by the specialist health care services.\nThese descriptions were conveyed either by educational\nmaterial or through courses following the assessment and\ntreatment of their children. Linda (46) was one of these infor-\nmants. She had several children with the ADHD diagnosis.\nShe also had many years of various kinds of sick leave,\nassessments, and treatments behind her, before asking to be\nassessed for the same diagnosis as her children had. Linda\naptly characterized the process these 7 participants had gone\nthrough: \"I guess the way it works is . . . that I have inherited\nthis diagnosis from my children, then?\"\nEven though several of the participants, for different rea-\nsons, had been familiar with the descriptions of clinical\nsymptoms in diagnostic manuals for a long time, it was still\nnot until they were acquainted with a kind of alternative\ndescription of the diagnosis that their suspicion of having\nADHD themselves was raised.9 Along with the official infor-\nmation that was disseminated through courses and brochures,\nalternative descriptions based on other people's personal\nexperiences with ADHD had spread through the participants'\nsocial networks of family members, friends, and acquain-\ntances. The participants' requests for assessment often seem\nto have been motivated by a sense of affiliation with \"signifi-\ncant others.\" The many examples of Linda's (46) narrative of\n\"inheriting the diagnosis from her children\" indicate that\ntheir own children often seem to perform as the \"significant\nother.\" There are also examples of siblings and other family\nmembers playing an important role in the identification pro-\ncess of the adult informants. In one case, the participant's\nown study work, and in another case, the mother's study\nwork seems to be the trigger for the participants identifying\nwith the diagnosis.\nFor the young people, it seems that friends are often the\nmost important \"significant others.\" In the absence of prob-\nlematic experiences, close relations with other young people\nwith ADHD diagnoses appear to be a key factor in the pro-\ncess leading to formal assessment. An example of this is the\nfollowing excerpt from Carl's (23) narrative:\nCarl (23): A friend of mine--uh [who is] a bit older than me--\nwent and got diagnosed with ADHD. And he, like me, reads a\nlot. He had read quite a lot about ADHD--and saw himself\nand also a lot of me in it, you know, as he read, . . . (I) sat down\nand started reading a bit--and I saw that it fitted. (Hann\u00e5s,\nIn the continuing process--that is, in the effort of obtain-\ning a referral for an assessment by the specialist health care\nservices--the network of friends and family members with\nthe diagnosis appears to be an important and useful tool. For\nexample, Carl (23) told that he had simply \"stopped by a\ntherapist in a psychiatric youth team\":\nCarl (23): I contacted him [the therapist] first. My friend, who\nwas already getting treated there, had mentioned me to him.\nBecause my friend and I are very much alike, in many ways.\nAnd he [the therapist] told me to just stop by, and we could have\na chat. And after talking to him for a bit, he took me in for a\nAs it turned out, many of those who had contacted their\nregular GPs because of their problems earlier, faced a kind of\nresistance when they asked to be assessed for ADHD. Not\nuncommonly, this resistance resulted in the participants hav-\ning to go through a period of negotiation with their regular\nGPs before finally getting the referral they sought.10 In cases\nwhere these negotiations appeared especially difficult, or\neven completely deadlocked, the participants solved their\nproblem by bypassing their GPs. Like the participants who\nwanted an assessment without any previous health-related\nissues, they utilized the networks of their respective friends\nor family members to contact the specialist health care ser-\nvices directly. Rigmor (41), in this vein, told that she--after\nseeing one of her own children, one brother and several other\nfamily members diagnosed with ADHD--contacted her reg-\nular GP to get referred for ADHD assessment. About the fol-\nlowing events, she told this,\nRigmor (41): I went to my GP. And then I asked for a referral for\nan assessment. And he started laughing at me. And he told me\nthat \"No, you don't have [ADHD]\" . . . He thought I was manic\nThe GP explained to Rigmor, who was already on disabil-\nity pension, that he regarded her chronic pain as a symptom\nof her depression. This, however, was a judgment Rigmor\ncould not agree upon. As the GP had, practically speaking,\ndenied her request to be referred, she tried an alternative\napproach to assessing whether or not she had ADHD:\nRigmor (41): So then, I rang the children and youth psychiatric\nservice, and talked to the people I'm dealing with there because\nof my child. Because we have discussion groups, and we have--.\nI got an appointment there. . . . And then she did one of those--.\nAnd she said, \"I can do a--, a straightforward, easy screening to\nsee whether you have--, if you're depressive.\" Anyway, it\nwas--, I think it was four or five sheets on one of those forms.\nThen she said, \"You're--, you're nowhere near being\ndepressive!\" And NN [name of therapist at the clinic] did the\nsame test then, before he started the ADHD assessment, to make\nIn several narratives, the regular GP seems to have been\nreluctant to comply with the participants' request for a refer-\nral, because, he had a different opinion of what the\nunderlying cause of the problem might be. By directing the\nrequest directly to the specialist health care services, this\nkind of remonstrance seemed to be avoidable or possible to\nThe participants' narratives about identification also con-\ntain examples of reflection on why ADHD was not suspected\nat an earlier stage in their lives. The relevant explanations are\nclosely tied to the question of how well their difficulties con-\nformed to the various notions of the ADHD diagnosis at any\ngiven time. Many participants have experienced symptoms\nthat could fit several diagnoses, and there seems to be a vari-\nation in terms of which diagnoses and which symptoms that\nhave been most prominent at different times. In many cases,\nthe participants'problems have been perceived and described\nas something other than ADHD. The data material contains\nexamples of the participants' problems being treated as eat-\ning disorders, self-harm, depressions, bipolar disorder, aller-\ngies, learning disabilities, different types of social difficulties,\nand so on. Several of the participants grew up in a period\nwhen the diagnoses ADHD (or minimal brain dysfunction\n[MBD]) were frequently associated with aggressive, violent,\nor criminal (generally) boys, who were often referred to as\n\"delinquents\" or \"hooligans.\" Except from the youngest\nones, a striking number of the participants pointed out that\nonly children very different from themselves had been diag-\nnosed with ADHD (or MBD) when they grew up. An exam-\nple of this is Mariann's (33) narrative:\nMariann (33): Um--we have, in our family, an extreme case of\nMBD. He got the diagnosis when he was 8, and he's now 27. So\nhe uh--he took all the attention for anything resembling MBD\nand ADHD. He was all over the place, and gets full score on\nevery symptom--and heh! And so, all the focus--in the entire\nfamily--was on him. . . . \"Uh--and my dad was in the MBD\nassociation. I think he was a member of the board. And my\nprimary school teacher was also--, is on the advisory board for\nthe ADHD association now. And no one had ever any idea that I\nOthers, especially among the older participants, meant\nthat they had always been considered as perfectly ordinary\nchildren. Some suggested that they from time to time--at the\nmost--might have been seen as \"troublesome\" or \"impossi-\nble\" children. Instead of justifying their request for assess-\nment by telling stories of diffuse sensations of being different,\nsome of these participants, conversely, emphasized and\nexplained which factors they believed might have contrib-\nuted to them never experiencing any specific difficulties ear-\nlier in life. Peter (53) told about a good life, first as a\nchild--both at home and at school--and then through years\nof working as an adult, before any difficulties emerged. He\npointed out that he, for example, had never been aggressive\nwhile growing up. He also emphasized that he was both an\nonly child, and belonged to a generation growing up with\nhousewife-mothers, in a period of \"proper conditions\" and\nstricter demands on discipline at school. Carl (23), who\n8 SAGE Open\nrepresents the next generation, believed that his teachers may\nhave considered him a fidgety or distracted pupil. At the\nsame time, he pointed out that this was a common phenom-\nenon in the school, and not something that would raise any\nsuspicion of ADHD. Carl (23), also, added that his mother\nhad facilitated things so well for him that his problems never\nbecame apparent at home. He guessed that this also contrib-\nuted to \"it not being discovered before he became that old.\"\nKey Events and Courses in the Stories\nIn the model shown in Figure 1, different events and courses\nin the various life stories are illustrated. The model is based\non identifying seven different key events that were recurrent\nin the participants' stories. A key event, in this respect, is an\nevent that turns out to be especially significant for the under-\nstanding of the events, and the way they are connected; that\nis, the course of events in the respective background narra-\ntives.12 In the model, the relevant key events are labeled \"dif-\nfuse sensations,\" \"health-related disorders and problems,\"\n\"regular GP,\" \"various diagnoses/treatments,\" \"identifica-\ntion,\" \"negotiation referral,\" and \"referral to specialist.\" The\narrows between the boxes in the model illustrate typical\ncourses of events in the different types of stories about the\nbackground for the youths and adults being referred for\nADHD assessment. The stories have different courses of\nevents. The numbers 1, 2, and 3 (by each oval) refers to the\nstarting point for the different stories, whereas the arrows\nbetween the ovals indicate what direction the course of\nevents in the various narratives took.\nIn the first variety, the stories start out with narratives of\ndifferent sensations of something being wrong. The next key\nevent in these histories, \"identification,\" represents the sto-\nries of how the participants ended up identifying with the\nADHD condition. From this point, there are two separate\ncourses. One, proceeding by the key event \"negotiating\nreferral,\" represents the stories where the participants con-\ntacted the primary health care services. In most cases, this\nled to their having to negotiate with their regular GP before\ntheir referral to a specialist finally came through. The other\ncourse illustrates the development of the stories where the\nparticipants bypassed negotiations with the primary health\ncare services, and--sometimes through middle men--\ndirected their request for ADHD assessment directly to (a\nrepresentative of) the specialist health care services.\nThe second variety of the typical courses of events starts\nout at Step 2 of the model, with \"health-related disorders and\nproblems.\" The stories continue with narratives of the par-\nticipants turning to their GPs for help with their issues, start-\ning off a period of time characterized by assessment and\ntrying out different diagnoses and treatments. From there, the\nstories continue with narratives linked to the subsequent key\nevent, \"identification.\" These often proved to be connected\nto other close acquaintances or family members of the par-\nticipants receiving an ADHD diagnosis. Onward, the stories\ntake one of the same two paths as the stories starting out with\n\"diffuse sensations.\"\nIn the third variety, the stories start out with narratives of\nthe key event \"identification,\" at Step 3 of the model. From\nhere, these stories also take one of the same alternate courses\nas the other two varieties; continuing on either through nego-\ntiations for referral in the primary health care services, or\ndirectly (alternatively through a middle man with some sort\nof personal connection) into the specialist health care ser-\nvices. These stories stand out from the two former varieties\nin the sense that they represent a type of stories that does not\nrefer to previous experiences, neither of distressing health-\nrelated problems nor of diffuse sensations. The lack of\nhealth-related issues may partially explain these participants\ninclination to bypass primary health care services, and\ninstead direct their request for assessment directly to the spe-\ncialist health care services. It should be emphasized, how-\never, that there were only 2 out of 19 instances of this kind of\nstory in the empirical data material altogether.\nThe purpose of the above-mentioned model is to sketch a\nsort of analytical representation of three different courses of\nhistories that stood out in the data material. The dashed arrow\nin the model's top left corner illustrates that the different nar-\nratives may also be part of one and the same life story. A life\nstory might start out with a narrative of a diffuse sensation,\ncontinue with a narrative of health-related disorders and\nproblems, before moving on to a narrative about a sort of\npersonal identification with ADHD. The objective, in this\ncontext, is not primarily to quantify the different key narra-\ntives, but rather to display the different courses of events that\nemerged, based on the analysis of the participants' life sto-\nries. Table 2, however, provides insight as to how the three\ndifferent main themes are distributed over four different vari-\neties of histories in the data material.\nThe column on the far left distinguishes four different\ncourses of events in the life stories. In the three following\ncolumns, \"X\" indicates which main theme is represented in\nthe different types of life histories. The row labeled \"Type 1\"\nDiffuse\nsensations\nHealth-related\ndis. & problems\nRegular GP Var. diagnoses/\ntreatments\nIdentification\nNegotiating\nreferral\nReferral to\nspecialist\nFigure 1. Key events and courses in youths' and adults' stories.\nNote. GP = general practitioner.\nshows that diffuse sensations was the main theme in 2 life\nstories where health-related disorders and problems did not\ncome up as a main theme. The row labeled \"Type 2\" shows\nthat health-related disorders and problems was the main\ntheme of 7 life stories where diffuse sensations were not a\nmain theme. \"Type 3\" shows 2 life stories with identification\nas a main theme, without any of the other main themes being\nrepresented. Identification, as previously mentioned, was a\nmain theme in all of the 19 life stories. The row labeled\n\"Type 4\" shows that, in 8 of the life stories, both diffuse sen-\nsations and health-related disorders and problems were main\nthemes. The numbers in the bottom row of the table shows\nthat diffuse sensations was a main theme in 10 of the 19 life\nstories. It is also apparent that health-related disorders and\nproblems was a main theme in 15 of the 19 life stories, in\ntotal (including one describing problems with violence).\nThe Search for an Explanation\nSeventeen of the 19 life stories contain narratives in which\nthe actions of the participants can be interpreted as an expres-\nsion of their search for an underlying explanation or reason\nfor their challenges.\nIn the narratives of health-related disorders and prob-\nlems, this is often expressed by a steadily seeking for medical\nhelp and advice. The problems are perceived as symptoms of\nvarious diagnoses, and the participants are receiving various\ntreatments, before ending up with ADHD as the final expla-\nnation of their disorders. The narratives refer to problems\nthat are usually widely accepted symptoms of some sort of\nillnesses or health-related disorders. The problems appear\nunquestionable; the challenge is finding their root cause.\nIn the narratives of diffuse sensations such references to\nobvious, visible signs and widely accepted symptoms of ill-\nness or health-related disorders are lacking. Instead, this\nvague feeling of not being like everyone else is reported. As\na consequence of repeated experiences of failure and social\nrejection, the participants however feel that something must\nbe wrong. For lack of better options, some start wondering if\nthey are suffering from some sort of brain impairment. The\nlack of obvious manifestations as well as reasonable expla-\nnations is a common characteristic of these narratives.\nHence, the participants' search for an explanation is primar-\nily motivated by a need for confirmation that their problems\nare real--and that there is an underlying reason for their\nproblems.\nBy the end of the interview survey, 17 out of the 19 par-\nticipants had finished their ADHD assessments, and received\ntheir conclusions. Fifteen of these 17 had the diagnosis con-\nfirmed, while 2 had their ADHD suspicions disproved. All of\nthe 15 that were given the diagnosis described this as a major\nrelief. This is in accordance both with results from other\nstudies on ADHD in adults (Fleischmann & Miller, 2013),\nand with theories in the field of medical sociology (Frank,\n1995). Interestingly, however, the same applied to the 2 par-\nticipants that did not receive the diagnosis. One of these had\nasked for an assessment to get rid of the diagnosis (Therese,\n19). The other one (Ida, 42), however, had strong hopes of\nconfirming her ADHD suspicions.13 Ida (42) had two chil-\ndren, both of whom had already received the ADHD diagno-\nsis, and she herself had struggled with comprehensive\nhealth-related issues all of her adult life. In the same way that\nthose who had received the diagnoses, she also, after a period\nof contemplation and confusion, expressed that having her\nADHD suspicions disproved had come as a relief.\nThe Significant Others\nAll of the 19 life stories contain narratives describing how\nthe participants ended up identifying with the ADHD diag-\nnosis. In 2 of the 19 life stories, identification was the only\none represented out of the three main themes identified in the\nstudy. The fact that the participants did not describe experi-\nences with any kind of problems or difficulties, and seemed\nto have identified with ADHD solely because of their\nacquaintances with the diagnosis, clearly makes these two\nlife stories stand out from the others. It is similarly quite\ninteresting that several of the older participants felt they had\nnot been perceived as different from other children while\ngrowing up.\nIn the narratives of identification, several factors that in\ndifferent ways seem to have contributed to the individual\nprocesses finally leading to a referral for ADHD assessment,\nare described. Some of them are related to a kind of avail-\nability. The sort of availability in question, however, has\nnothing to do with the geographical distance to diagnostic\ncompetence. Several of the participants had to travel quite\nfar, repeatedly, to complete their assessments. Still, no one\nbrought up this issue during the interviews. The analysis\nrather showed that the availability of \"significant others\"\nseems to have had a decisive impact on the participants'deci-\nsion to request an assessment for themselves.\nAmong those who most frequently appear as significant\nothers are own children, siblings or other close relatives,\nand--especially with the younger participants--close friends.\nTable 2.

All the others refer to health-related disorders and problems.\nThe knowledge possessed by the participants about ADHD\nfrom other contexts seldom led them to identify their own\nproblems with the diagnosis, and ask for an assessment.\nAlong with the significant others, the opportunity for a kind\nof informal or direct contact with the specialist health care\nservices appears to make the diagnosis a more available one.\nSocial networks and relations to others with the diagnosis\nstand out as important factors helping adults to seek and\nobtain assessment for ADHD.\nThe significance of having children of their own with the\ndiagnosis and the significance of the adults' own ability and\nwill to persist in finding the cause of their problems are also\npointed out by other researchers (Fleischmann & Miller,\nConcluding Remarks\nThe key questions of this article deal with how the ADHD\ncondition is manifested, and which factors, at different points\nin time, seem to have affected the course of the lives of the\nyouths and adults prior to their referrals for ADHD assess-\nment. The analysis shows that the youths' and adults' life\nstories are especially characterized by three themes: health-\nrelated disorders and problems; diffuse sensations that\n\"something\" is wrong with them; and by identification with\nthe diagnosis. Health-related disorders and problems seem to\ncause comprehensive problems in the everyday lives for the\nindividuals. Even if this appears to be the most dramatic\ntheme, the individual life stories also contain narratives of\nthe other main themes. The course of events in a life story\nthat contains all of the three main topics typically starts out\nwith narratives of a diffuse sensation that something is\nwrong. Next, there are narratives of health-related disorders\nand problems. Finally, there are narratives of identification\nwith significant others' modified descriptions of the diagno-\nsis. This identification motivates the youths and adults to\nseek and negotiate their referral for ADHD assessment.\nFurthermore, the study indicates that close, personal rela-\ntions with others with the diagnosis may be of great signifi-\ncance for adults getting assessed for ADHD.\nThis study has some obvious limitations. First, the ana-\nlytic work is conducted by the author alone. All of the par-\nticipants have, however, been sent the results of the analysis,\nand no one has made any critical objections. Second, the\nstudy was conducted in a very limited sample, thus, the\nresults are not readily generalizable to a larger population.\nDespite its limitations, the study does reveal some issues that\ncould be considered pursued in professional practice, as well\nas some questions that could warrant further research. One\nsuch question is whether the ADHD diagnosis will remain\nthe final explanation of the questions raised by the youths\nand adults, namely, \"why they are the way that they are\" or\n\"why things turned out as they did.\"\nThrough the interviews, it became clear that several of the\nparticipants and many of their close acquaintances were\nrelatively familiar with the diagnosis long before anyone\nsuspected that the participants'own issues could be related to\nADHD. The knowledge they possessed was based on the\ndescriptions from the diagnostic manuals. It did not comply\nwell with the adults'experiences of their own problems. This\nmay indicate a basic lack of knowledge in the general public\nabout the manifestations and consequences of this condition\nin adults. In addition, several adult participants faced resis-\ntance when requesting ADHD assessment from their regular\nGPs. This may indicate a lack of competence on ADHD in\nadults, as well as a lack of possible common comorbid prob-\nlems, in the primary health care services as well. This is\nanother question that might warrant a closer examination. If\nthis should turn out to be a widespread issue, increased\nefforts in raising the competence level in the primary health\ncare services could be useful. If no such efforts are made, we\nmay be at risk of a continuing under-diagnosing of adults\nwith ADHD.\nOnly a minority of the participants (2 of 19) in this study\ngot the diagnosis without experiencing any specific prob-\nlems or difficulties beforehand. These were two of the\nyounger participant in the sample, emphasizing themselves\nthat the diagnosis has become very common, and that their\nfriends had it, too. The study sample is rather small, and\nthese two constitutes a small share of the sample (less than\n1:10). Still, it might be of interest to investigate how com-\nmon this phenomenon actually is. A relevant question in this\ncontext is how one might explain that youths can be diag-\nnosed with ADHD without fulfilling the formal criteria of\nsignificant distress or interference with functioning. If this\nshould turn out to be an established practice, the consequence\nmay be an over-diagnosing of youths with ADHD. Perhaps\nTherese's (19) story, describing a request for assessment to\ndisprove her ADHD diagnosis, could be interpreted as an\nexample of this kind of over-diagnosing?Aresearch question\nthat could cover all of the above-mentioned questions is\nwhether we are witnessing a diagnostic practice that may\nlead to an over-diagnosing of youths and an under-diagnos-\ning of adults with ADHD.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\nas the year when \"ADHD\" (Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity\nDisorder) was introduced as a term for a specific diagnosis in\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM;\n 2.

For a more thorough description of the sample, and so on, see\n 5. The quote is retrieved from a paragraph that speaks of valid-\nity in relation to narrative analysis. In my interpretation of the\nauthor, the truthfulness requirement is as relevant both with\nrespect to the informants' narratives and to what may be called\nresearchers' narratives or meta-narratives, that is, my own\ninterpretations, reconstructions or analyses, based on the nar-\nratives of the informants.\n 6. Compare, for example, Grounded Theory (Glaser & Strauss,\n 7. A more thorough description of Labov's method is found, for\nexample, in Riessman (1993) and Fleischmann and Miller\n 8. The table may be subject to some inaccuracies. The categories\nare defined and bounded, based on the terms the informants\nthemselves utilized in relevant narratives from their own lives.\nIt is primarily the terms and explanations of the informants,\nnot the formal definitions of the corresponding administrative\ncategories that form the basis for the categorization. Despite\neventual inaccuracies that this may have caused, I believe the\nmain features and tendencies that are uncovered in Table 1\ncannot be characterized as misleading.\n9. In the network theory of Bruno Latour, which among other\nthings describes how the knowledge of any given phenomenon\nis confirmed and spread through a network of diverse actors\n(\"agents\"), such descriptions are described as different \"trans-\nlations\" of the phenomenon under study (Latour, 1987).\n10. In studies of chronic illnesses, a phenomenon called \"medical\nmerry-go-round\" is described. This term is related to a type\nof activity connected to patients' and next of kin's search for\nthe maximum amount of information possible with regard\nto their own illness and treatment. After hours of dedicated\ninformation gathering through every available channel, the\npatients appear to be experts on their own condition, able to\nnegotiate specific details with their doctors, both with regard\nto their own illness, and relevant forms of treatment. Bury\n(1997) describes this phenomenon in connection with the very\noutbreak of the illness, especially related to the activity that\ntakes place after the diagnosis is given, and the treatment com-\nmenced. Furthermore, he claims that the activity decreases,\nand the patients and next of kin usually calm down after a cer-\ntain amount of time. In terms of ADHD in youths and adults,\nhowever, the \"medical merry-go-round\" seems an appropriate\ndescription of a process that takes place prior to the diagnos-\ntic assessment for ADHD. The informants in this study, by all\naccounts, could not settle down, neither with the diagnoses nor\nwith the treatment options they were prescribed before being\nassessed for ADHD. This led to new rounds of sick leaves,\nassessments, diagnoses, and treatments (cf. \"medical merry-\ngo-round\") before finally being assessed for ADHD.\n11. According to Latour's network theory, the specialists in this\nrespect appear to be more effective agents than the general\npractitioners (GPs) in the primary health care services with\nregard to recruiting new members to the ADHD category.\nThe network of agents for the diagnosis is growing as a con-\nsequence of more members being recruited to the category.\nHowever, Latour points out another, unavoidable effect of the\nsame process. This shows that every new--and unique--case\nof a phenomenon identified, simultaneously implies a modi-\nfication of the phenomenon itself. Each new group of mem-\nbers included in the ADHD category contributes to a need for\nchange in the category itself. Correspondingly, the knowledge\nof the category must be subject to change--or \"translation\"--\nso that it at any point includes every new and unique variety of\nthe phenomenon (cf., for example, the information brochures\nfrom the specialist health care services; Latour, 1987).\n12. Riessman employs the term key aspect when describing both\nLabov's and Gee's models of narrative analysis. She states that,\nin both models, the analysis implies a \"reduction to the core nar-\nrative\" by using a \"selection of key aspects.\" \"Key aspects\" are,\npractically speaking, excerpts from the interview transcripts that\nrepresent specific functions in a narrative (Riessman, 1993, p. 60).\n13. Ida (42) was one of the informants who were interviewed both\nbefore and after the assessment. In this context, it is interest-\ning that she, unlike some of the informants who received the\ndiagnosis, did not go on sick leave after the assessment.\nReferences\nBaughman, F. A., & Hovey, C.
