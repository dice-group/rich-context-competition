Men invest relatively little in the\nconception and gestation processes, but face the risk of paternal uncertainty--a risk\nSex differences in jealousy\ncarrying potentially devastating genetic consequences should a man unknowingly invest\nresources in the child of another man. Women, in contrast, enjoy complete maternal\ncertainty, but their minimum investment (gestation and, often, early child rearing) is\nsubstantially greater than men's minimum investment. For women, then, the adaptive\nchallenge is to ensure that the father invests resources into her children rather than the\nchildren of a rival woman. These considerations led evolutionary psychologists to theorize\nthat male and female jealousy will differ in order to solve these differential adaptive\nproblems (Buss, Larsen, Westen, and Semmelroth, 1992; Daly, Wilson, and Weghorst,\nThe most robust evidence for sex differences in jealousy has been produced by Buss\net al.'s (1992) forced-choice methodology in which participants consider a hypothetical\ninfidelity scenario and choose which type of infidelity (sexual vs. emotional) would cause\ngreater distress. Numerous studies have demonstrated that men are much more likely than\nwomen to choose the sexual infidelity (see Harris', 2003, meta-analysis), although it should\nbe noted that the vast majority of forced-choice studies designed to test the theory of\nevolved sex differences in jealousy actually measured sex differences in \"distress\" or\n\"upset\" rather than sex differences in \"jealousy\". In contrast, studies that have examined\nwomen's and men's jealousy using continuous measures have often produced non-\nsignificant results, leading some critics to argue that the sex difference is an artifact of the\nforced-choice method (DeSteno, Bartlett, Braverman, and Salovey, 2002; Harris, 2003).\nHowever, a meta-analysis (Sagarin et al., in press) that examined the sex difference across\n45 independent samples that used continuous measures found a highly significant, theory-\nsupportive average effect, g* = 0.258, p < .00001, demonstrating that the sex difference in\njealousy is not an artifact of the forced-choice methodology. Furthermore, in contrast to the\ncommon use of \"distress\" or \"upset\" in forced-choice studies, the most common emotion\nmeasured in continuous measure studies was \"jealousy\" (Sagarin et al., in press).\nThe theory of evolved sex differences in jealousy has also been challenged on a\nhypothetical infidelity scenarios and questioned whether the sex difference would appear in\nresponse to actual infidelity experiences. In response, Edlund, Heider, Scherer, Farc, and\nSagarin (2006) demonstrated that the sex difference in jealousy replicated when an adult\nsample retrospectively reported their responses to a past experience as a victim of\ninfidelity, and Sagarin et al.'s (in press) meta-analysis found a significant theory-supportive\naverage effect across seven independent samples that assessed reactions to actual infidelity\ntesting the theory of evolved sex differences in jealousy. Kuhle coded infidelity-related\ninterrogations on the television program \"Cheaters.\" Consistent with the theory, \"men were\nmore likely than women to inquire about the sexual aspect of their partners' infidelities,\nwhereas women were more likely than men to inquire about the emotional aspect of their\nDeSteno and colleagues (2002) offered another challenge, suggesting that cognitive\nload eliminated the sex difference in jealousy. Sagarin (2005), however, reanalyzed\nDeSteno and colleagues' data and found that a significant sex difference remained even\nwhen participants were under cognitive load. Furthermore, Barrett, Frederick, Haselton,\nand Kurzban (2006) and Sagarin questioned the usefulness of cognitive load in\ninvestigating the sex difference in jealousy. Finally, Harris (2000) challenged the theory-\nSex differences in jealousy\nsupportive interpretation of Buss et al.'s (1992) physiological data. Harris's challenge\nremains thus far unaddressed.1\nWhen the Sexes Do Not Differ\nSex differences in response to hypothetical infidelity scenarios have been replicated\nin numerous heterosexual samples across the world (e.g., Buss et al., 1999; Buunk,\nAngleitner, Oubaid, and Buss, 1996; Geary, Rumsey, Bow-Thomas, and Hoard, 1995; see\nHarris', 2003, meta-analysis of forced-choice studies). These differences tend to disappear,\nhowever, among lesbians and gay men. In Harris' (2003) meta-analysis, a large sex\ndifference appeared across studies of heterosexual women and men (log-odds ratio of 1.09),\nbut a substantially smaller sex difference (log-odds ratio of \u00ad0.26) appeared across the three\nstudies of lesbians and gay men (Dijkstra et al., 2001; Harris, 2002; Sheets and Wolfe,\n2001). In addition, a fourth study (Bailey, Gaulin, Agyel, and Gladue, 1994), whose results\nwere not presented in a form that allowed for their inclusion in Harris' meta-analysis, found\nlittle difference between the responses of lesbians and gay men. These studies demonstrate\nthat the sex difference in jealousy is attenuated (sometimes completely) when the jealous\nperceiver and his or her partner are of the same sex. Along these lines, Wiederman and\nLaMar (1998) found that jealousy in response to sexual infidelity in heterosexual women\nand men is moderated by the sex of the rival, and Sagarin, Becker, Guadagno, Nicastle, and\nMillevoi (2003) found that the sex difference disappears when heterosexual men and\nwomen contemplate an infidelity in which the partner and rival are of the same sex.\nSexual Orientation and Jealousy\nTo account for the disappearance of the sex difference in jealousy among lesbians\nand gay men and among heterosexual women and men contemplating same-sex infidelities,\nwe offer a reproductive threat-based model of evolved sex differences in jealousy. The\nmodel stems, in part, from the observation that paternal uncertainty is a threat faced only by\n2001). In particular, the present model is built on the observations that (a) paternal\nuncertainty is a risk faced only by men whose female romantic partners become involved\nwith a male rival, and (b) loss of paternal investment to the children of a rival is a risk faced\nonly by women whose male romantic partners become involved with a female rival. This\nmodel provides a parsimonious account of the past data and generates novel predictions\ntested in our current data. In the next section, we outline the premises of our proposed\nmodel. Thereafter, we provide data from a study designed to test the model.\nA Reproductive Threat-Based Model of Evolved Sex Differences in Jealousy\nThe reproductive threat-based model of evolved sex differences in jealousy is based\non two premises: (a) Non-exclusive same-sex sexual behavior (both by individuals in their\nsexual behavior and by individuals' partners in their extra-pair sexual behavior) occurred\nsufficiently often in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness (EEA) that an evolved\nresponse could have taken it into account, and (b) The fitness implications of an infidelity\n1 But see Takahashi et al. (2006) for an intriguing demonstration of different patterns of\nbrain activation when women and men imagine sexual and emotional infidelity.\nSex differences in jealousy\nin which a mating partner became involved with a rival of the same sex were sufficiently\ndifferent from the implications of an infidelity in which a mating partner became involved\nwith a rival of the opposite sex, and, likewise, the fitness implications of an infidelity\ncommitted by a same-sex sexual partner were sufficiently different from the implications of\nan infidelity committed by an opposite-sex sexual partner, that it would have been\nadaptively beneficial for a sexually dimorphic jealous response to take these differences\ninto account. Each of these premises is addressed below.\nSame-sex sexual behavior in the EEA\nAlthough there is substantial evidence that same-sex sexual behavior in humans has\noccurred cross-culturally and throughout human history (Spencer, 1995), some have argued\nthat this behavior has been prematurely disregarded in evolutionary theory. Muscarella\n(1999) and Ross and Wells (2000) consider this state of affairs as the result of an improper\nequating of same-sex sexual behavior with sexual orientation as a self-identity, the latter of\nwhich has been construed to be a recent development resulting from industrialization (see\nGreenberg, 1988). A consequence of this association between behavior and identity is the\nunspoken assumption among evolutionary psychologists that `meaningful' quantities of\nsame-sex sexual behavior were absent until modern times when gay people suddenly\n\"appeared\", and thus the behavior is irrelevant to evolutionary theorizing.\nIn addition to apparent instances of same-sex sexual behavior being depicted in\nprehistoric art (Taylor, 1996), there appears to have been sufficient amounts of male same-\nsex behavior in our ancient history for the Egyptians to possess numerous terms in their\nlanguage to distinguish between different motivations behind the behavior early in their\ncivilization (Parkinson, 1995). The occurrence of male same-sex sexual behavior among\nthe Greeks is well-known, although the specific social structures organizing the behavior\nhave been debated (see Davidson, 2001; Percy, 2005). Indeed, sufficient instances of same-\nsex sexual behavior have occurred throughout history from Rome (Butrica, 2005) to\nRenaissance Italy (Rocke, 1996) for societies to establish linguistic and social structures to\ncharacterize (and often regulate) such behavior.\nSimilar instances of structured same-sex sexual behavior are observed in\ncontemporary hunter-gather societies, which are often considered the most appropriate\npresent-day representation of the EEA (Kirkpatrick, 2000). Among the Kimam-Papuans\nfrequent anal intercourse between males is required as a component of an adolescent boy's\ncomplex entrance into adulthood (Serpenti, 1993). Similar compulsory occurrences of\nmale-male oral sex are found in Sambian culture (Herdt, 1993). In many such societies\nsame-sex sexual behavior (often in substantial quantities) is considered to serve a necessary\nfunction not only for the physical and psychological growth of young men, but for the\nsuccessful achievement of heterosexual sexual behavior and reproduction in adulthood.\nAlthough this presumed connection between same-sex sexual behavior and reproduction\nmay appear nonsensical by modern standards, similar associations between\n`homosexuality' and reproductive success have been recently suggested by evolutionary\nSame-sex sexual behavior in animals has also been implicated as possessing\nsignificance for the development of psychological mechanisms in humans (see Werner,\n2006). Although the definition of such behavior in animals is often problematic and varies\nbetween researchers, the sexual interaction of animals of the same sex appears to be a\nSex differences in jealousy\n(1999) provides documentation that the behavior \"occurs in more than 450 different kinds\nof animals worldwide, and is found in every major geographic region and every major\nanimal group\" (p. 12).\nSame-sex sexual behavior comes out to have important social functions among\nnumerous species of non-human primates (see Vasey, 1995 for a review). The use of such\nbehavior among Bonobos as a means to reduce social tension and increase alliance\nformations and conflict reconciliation has been frequently portrayed (Vasey, 2006). Sexual\nbehavior also emerges commonly between female Japanese Macaques, although currently\nthe evidence suggests this behavior represents mutual sexual attraction between the\npartners in addition to serving specific social functions (Vasey, 2006), suggesting the\nevolution of functional same-sex sexual behavior and an individual orientation toward such\nbehavior in species need not be mutually exclusive.\nAlthough we acknowledge the ongoing debate regarding the evolutionary processes\nand functions involved in human same-sex behaviors and orientations, we point out that\nregardless of whether such behavior evolved to serve social functions (Muscarella, 2006) or\nenhance reproductive success of heterosexuals (Miller, 2000), or even if it is an emergent\nresult of some as yet unspecified gene-environment interaction, our threat-based model of\nsex differences in jealousy can be posited from a position that is agnostic regarding the\ncauses of `homosexuality'. Taken together, the above historical, cross-cultural, and animal\nevidence suggests that the EEA provided our ancestors with opportunities to encounter and\ndistinguish between infidelities involving a myriad of combinations regarding the sexes of\nthe persons involved. Thus, whatever its causes or functions, it seems likely that same-sex\nsexual behavior existed in sufficient quantities in the EEA that an evolved response could\nhave taken it into account.\nReproductive compatibility as an evolved moderator\nTooby and Cosmides (1992) theorized that some evolved mechanisms may have\nbeen constructed to produce flexible output based on evolutionarily relevant contextual\ninput (see also Harris', 2003, discussion of evolved modulators). Gangestad and Simpson\n(2000) offer evidence for this type of flexibility in the diversity of mating strategies\nadopted by men and women. For example, Gangestad and Simpson (2000) report that men\nwith a higher degree of bilaterial symmetry (a marker for good genes) have a greater desire\nfor short-term sexual opportunities than less symmetrical men. Similarly, Gangestad and\nBuss (1993) found that greater prevalence of pathogens in an environment was associated\nwith greater importance of physical attractiveness in women and men's selection of a mate.\nIn both these cases, contextual input moderates the manifestation of evolved mating\nstrategies, because variation in these contextual factors was present in the ancestral\nenvironment, and because taking this variation into account significantly alters the costs\nand the benefits of the strategic options.\nIn numerous cultures around the world, jealousy is a major cause of spousal abuse\nand homicide (Daly and Wilson, 1988a,b). It seems likely that jealousy provoked similar\nbehavior in the EEA. Furthermore, even when jealousy did not provoke violent behavior,\njealousy could cause the dissolution of the mating relationship, threatening the survival of\nexisting children through the loss of biparental care and removing the potential for future\noffspring. Thus, because of the fitness costs potentially incurred by the jealous perceiver,\nSex differences in jealousy\nwe suggest that it would be reproductively advantageous for an evolved response to take\ninto account the reproductive compatibility between the jealous perceiver and the partner\n(i.e., whether the perceiver and partner are reproductively compatible; that is, of the\nopposite sex), and the reproductive compatibility between the partner and the rival. This\nwould produce sexually dimorphic jealous responses only in situations in which women\nand men faced sexually dimorphic adaptive challenges (i.e., only in situations in which an\nopposite sex partner became involved with a rival of the opposite sex).\nThe existence of a response of this type does not require that evolution created a\ncontext-insensitive sex difference in jealousy and then added a moderator. Rather, we\npropose that evolution selected for a response that was sensitive to the reproductive threat\nimplied by the infidelity based on the sexes of the jealous perceiver, the partner, and the\nrival. In other words, although it is conceivable that a general sex difference evolved (e.g.,\nmen, relative to women, feel greater jealousy in response to sexual infidelity compared to\nemotional infidelity) and became modified with a suitably important exception (e.g.,\nselection pressures removed the sex difference in situations in which the partner became\ninterested in a same sex rival), we feel this is unlikely to have occurred. A more plausible\nscenario is that selection processes created a context sensitive response that took\nreproductive compatibility into account in the first place.\nIn considering the plausibility of such a response, it should be kept in mind that the\nevolved response is already very context sensitive. It manifests only when someone\nobserves or infers intimate contact between his or her partner and a person perceived as a\nrival. It does not manifest, for example, when someone observes or infers intimate contact\nbetween any two people, nor when someone observes or infers intimate contact between\nthe partner and a person not perceived as a rival (e.g., the partner's sibling). It thus seems\nmuch more likely that the response evolved with this discrimination in place rather than as\na general response that was then modified to account for the great number of possible\nexceptions (e.g., when the people observed do not include the partner, when the partner is\nhaving intimate contact with a member of the partner's immediate family, etc). Similarly,\nwe propose that, because ancestral men and women encountered non-exclusive same-sex\nsexual behavior (both in their own relationships as well as the relationships of their\npartners) sufficiently often, the response could have evolved with this sensitivity built in\n(e.g., men only became particularly sensitive to sexual infidelity when they observed their\nfemale partners becoming intimate with a rival male).\nFinally, the animal kingdom provides a precedent for the type of moderation we are\nproposing for humans. Gorillas are polygynous--a dominant male gorilla typically\nmonopolizes the mating opportunities with the adult female gorillas in his group. This\ndominant male is likely to respond with aggression against a rival male, but he tolerates the\nfrequent occurrence of sex between females in the group (Bagemihl, 1999). Thus, male\ngorillas discriminate between male and female rivals for the attentions of their female\nmating partners, showing more negative reactions when their female mating partners\nengage in sexual contact with other male gorillas than when their female mating partners\nengage in sexual contact with other female gorillas. Male gorillas also discriminate\nbetween male and female partners: In all-male groups \"there is often intense competition\namong the males for `preferred' partners--often the younger males--and older, higher-\nranking males frequently `guard' their favorite males and fight to protect them from the\nadvances of other males. Nevertheless, rates of aggression are significantly lower in all-\nSex differences in jealousy\nmale groups than in cosexual groups\" (Bagemihl, 1999, p. 281). Thus, male gorillas show\nmore negative reactions when their female mating partners engage in sexual contact with\nother male gorillas than when their male mating partners engage in sexual contact with\nother male gorillas.\nWe do not mean to suggest that gorillas feel jealousy in the same way as humans,\nbut these examples provide evidence that evolution has created in non-human animals\naggressive responses that are moderated by reproductive compatibility. We are simply\nsuggesting that evolution has built this moderation into humans as well.\nThe Present Study\nThe present study was designed to test the reproductive threat-based model of\nevolved sex differences in jealousy by examining jealousy within all eight possible\nconfigurations of male and female perceivers, partners, and rivals. To this end, we created\nan anonymous, web-based survey that assessed participants' sex and sexual orientation and\nthen posed a randomly-assigned version of the Buss et al. (1992) forced-choice question\nthat asked participants to consider either a same-sex infidelity or an opposite-sex infidelity.\nConsistent with the reproductive threat-based based model of evolved sex\ndifferences in jealousy, we hypothesized that the typical sex difference would emerge only\nfor heterosexual women and men contemplating opposite-sex infidelities. We hypothesized\nthat the sex difference would not appear for heterosexual women and men contemplating\nsame-sex infidelities nor for lesbians and gay men contemplating same-sex or opposite-sex\ninfidelities.\nWe should note that these hypotheses refer to a comparison of the proportion of\nwomen who choose the sexual infidelity as more distressing versus the proportion of men\nwho choose the sexual infidelity as more distressing. It is irrelevant (and, indeed,\npotentially misleading to attempt to interpret) whether the proportion for women differs\nfrom 50% or whether the proportion for men differs from 50%. The reason for this is that\nmultiple factors determine participants' responses to the forced-choice question, possibly\nincluding the theorized sexually dimorphic jealous response, but also including other\ninfluences such as the wording of the choices. As Sagarin et al. (in press) point out:\nFor example, Buss and colleagues (1992) used two operationalizations of each type\nof infidelity. They operationalized sexual infidelity as either \"enjoying passionate\nsexual intercourse\" or \"trying different sexual positions\" and emotional infidelity as\neither \"forming a deep emotional attachment\" or \"falling in love.\" The\nresults suggest that both women and men found passionate sexual intercourse more\njealousy provoking than different sexual positions, falling in love more jealousy\nprovoking than development of a deep emotional attachment, or both.\nFor \"enjoying passionate sexual intercourse\" versus \"forming a deep emotional\nattachment\", the proportion of men choosing the sexual infidelity as more distressing was\n60% and the proportion of women was 17% (Buss et al., 1992). For \"trying different sexual\npositions\" versus \"falling in love\" the proportion of men was 44% and the proportion of\nwomen was 12%. Thus, in the first operationalization of the infidelities, a majority of men\nchose the sexual infidelity and a majority of women chose the emotional infidelity, whereas\nin the second operationalization, a majority of both men and women chose the emotional\ninfidelity. In both cases, however, the proportion of women choosing the sexual infidelity\nSex differences in jealousy\nas more distressing was significantly lower than the proportion of men choosing the sexual\ninfidelity as more distressing. Given this, it would be misleading to conclude on the basis\nof both proportions lying below 50% that the second operationalization showed no sex\ndifference. It showed a large, highly significant sex difference.\nSimilarly, had Buss et al. (1992) operationalized emotional infidelity as \"sharing\nsome secrets\" and sexual infidelity as \"enjoying passionate sexual intercourse\", we might\nexpect a majority of both women and men to choose the sexual infidelity as more\ndistressing. But we would still expect a greater proportion of men than women to choose\nthe sexual infidelity.\nThe bottom line is that the interpretation of whether a particular group is above or\nbelow 50% does not tell us whether that group finds sexual infidelity (the construct) or\nemotional infidelity (the construct) more distressing. It tells us that that group found the\nspecific operationalization of sexual or emotional infidelity more distressing. Thus, the\nappropriate test of the theory of evolved sex differences in jealousy (and the appropriate\ntest of our reproductive threat-based model) is a comparison of the proportions of women\nand men, not an observation of whether both proportions lie on the same side of 50% (see\nEdlund and Sagarin, 2009, and Sagarin et al., in press, for a comprehensive treatment of\nthis issue).\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nTwo rounds of data collection took place, one targeting lesbians and gay men, the\nother targeting heterosexual women and men. The first round of participants was recruited\nthrough e-mail announcements on mailing lists subscribed to by lesbian, gay, and bisexual\nindividuals. The e-mail announcement described the survey, offered a link to those\ninterested in participating, and requested that the announcement be forwarded to other\nelectronic mailing lists subscribed to by lesbians and gay men. The survey was open for\none month after its announcement. Respondents to this round of data collection consisted of\nand 7 heterosexual men. Although this round of data collection was designed to target\nlesbians and gay men, all respondents were included in the final dataset.\nThe second round of participants was recruited by students in an Upper Division\nSocial Psychology class. Students were offered up to 5 points of extra credit if they\nrecruited up to 5 individuals within their social networks (i.e., friends and family members)\nto fill out the survey. In an effort to recruit a broader sample than college undergraduates,\nstudents were specifically encouraged to recruit non-students to fill out the survey. An\nexamination of the distribution of ages revealed that 51.1% of participants were over 21,\nwith ages ranging up to 75, suggesting that the sample contained a substantial proportion of\nnon-undergraduates. Students were provided with an e-mail cover letter that described the\nsurvey and offered a link to those interested in participating. Because of concerns about\ncheating, students were instructed that their participants' submissions must come from\ndifferent computers. To screen the data to ensure this criterion was met, participants'\ncomputer Internet Protocol (IP) addresses were logged when they filled out the\nquestionnaire. One hundred sixty three responses that were not in compliance with this\nstipulation (i.e., that were submitted by the same computer) were excluded from the data\nset. Respondents to this round of data collection consisted of 6 lesbians, 10 gay men, 5\nbisexual women, 5 bisexual men, 251 heterosexual women, and 160 heterosexual men.\nSex differences in jealousy\nbisexual men, 265 heterosexual women, and 167 heterosexual men. Bisexual women and\nmen were given a scenario with the sex of the romantic partner randomly assigned. For\nanalysis purposes, these participants were included with the group corresponding to their\nsex and their randomly assigned partner sex (e.g., a bisexual woman randomly assigned to\na scenario involving a male romantic partner was included in the group with heterosexual\nwomen). The mean age of participants was 28.2 (SD = 10.2). Thus, although the current\nsample is older than the typical undergraduate sample, participants were not randomly\nselected into the current study and the mean age is still rather low, suggesting the need for\nfuture research with more generalizable samples.\nindicated that they were not currently in a relationship, 101 (53 women, 48 men) were\ncasually dating one person, 57 (21 women, 36 men) were casually dating more than one\n0 men) were seriously involved with more than one person, 122 (73 women, 49 men) were\ndomestic partners/living together, and 157 (102 women, 55 men) were married/life\npartners.\nWith respect to infidelity experience, 56.7% of female respondents and 51.6% of\nmale respondents reported that a relationship partner had cheated on them, and 42.4% of\nfemale respondents and 44.1% of male respondents reported that they had cheated on a\nrelationship partner.\nProcedure\nThe present study consisted of a 2 (sex of participant)  2 (sex of partner)  2 (sex\nof rival)  2 (counterbalance of emotional infidelity vs. sexual infidelity response option\nfirst) between-subjects factorial design. The introductory web page of the survey described\nthe study and requested that participants click on one of six links that identified their sex\nand sexual orientation. These links brought up a version of the survey appropriate for the\nindicated sex and sexual orientation, with sex of rival and counterbalance randomly\nassigned (and sex of partner randomly assigned for bisexual participants). The survey itself\nconsisted of 27 closed-ended questions followed by 6 open-ended questions. Only the\nforced choice question and demographics are discussed in this paper.\nForced choice\nParticipants were asked a version of the Buss et al. (1992) forced-choice question\nwith sex of rival and counterbalance randomly assigned. For example, a female\nheterosexual participant randomly assigned to a female rival and randomly assigned to\nreceive the emotion choice first read:\nPlease think of a serious committed romantic relationship with a man that you have\nhad in the past, that you currently have, or that you would like to have. Imagine that\nyou discover that the person with whom you've been seriously involved became\ninterested in another woman. What would distress or upset you more:\n(a) Imagining your partner forming a deep emotional attachment to that other\nperson.\n(b) Imagining your partner enjoying passionate sex with that other person.\nSex differences in jealousy\nWhen participants submitted their answers, they were sent to a final page, which\nthanked them for their participation, described the background of the study, and offered\ncontact information if they were interested in a copy of the results.\nResults\nFigure 1 represents participants' answers to the forced-choice question. A logistic\nregression was run to test the main effects and interactions of sex of participant, sexual\norientation of participant, and whether the infidelity was same-sex or opposite-sex. The\nanswer to the forced-choice question was logistically regressed first on the three main\neffects, yielding a significant omnibus tests of model coefficients, 2(3) = 22.36, p < .001.\nThen, the three two-way interactions were entered, yielding a significant increase in\nentered, once again significantly increasing variance accounted for, 2(1) = 6.66, p = .01.\nThis significant three-way interaction demonstrates that sex differences in which type of\ninfidelity causes greater distress are moderated by both sexual orientation of the participant\nand whether the infidelity is same-sex or opposite-sex. With respect to counterbalancing,\nthe ordering of the answers to the forced-choice question had no significant effect on\nresponses, nor did counterbalancing interact significantly with any of the other independent\nvariables.\nFigure 1.

Results from gay and lesbian samples, however, reveal a different\nHarris, 2003). In contrast to the reliable sex difference that appears among heterosexual\nmen and women, gay men and lesbians tend to show no sex difference. Sagarin et al.\n(2003) and the present study offer further evidence for the context-sensitive nature of the\nsex difference: the sex difference disappears when heterosexual men and women are asked\nto consider their opposite-sex partners becoming involved with a rival of the same sex.\nWe believe that these boundary conditions on the manifestation of sex differences\nin jealousy do not refute an evolutionary explanation. Rather, they provide evidence as to\nthe nature of the algorithm underlying the sex difference. Specifically, the results reported\nby Bailey et al. (1994) and Sheets and Wolfe (2001) imply that sex differences in jealousy\ndo not conform to a purely perceiver-based model (i.e., the jealous reactions are not\ndetermined solely by the sex of the jealous perceiver) or a purely partner-based model (i.e.,\nthe jealous reactions are not determined solely by the sex of the partner). Additionally, the\nresults reported by Sagarin et al. (2003) and the present paper suggest that, among\nheterosexual women and men, the algorithm is sensitive to the reproductive compatibility\nbetween the partner and rival (i.e., whether the partner and rival are of the opposite sex).\nIn an attempt to synthesize these past findings into an evolutionary psychological\ntheory that explains not only when the sexes would differ but also when they would not, we\nproposed a reproductive threat-based model of evolved sex differences in jealousy. This\nmodel specifies that the sexes will differ only in situations in which an opposite-sex partner\nhas become involved with a reproductively-compatible rival. The present results offer\nstrong support for this model by demonstrating that reproductive compatibility between the\npartner and rival does not moderate the sex difference in jealousy among lesbians and gay\nmen as it does among heterosexual women and men. Instead, a similar proportion of\nlesbians and gay men report greater distress in response to a sexual infidelity, regardless of\nwhether the infidelity is same-sex or opposite-sex.\nThe present results are incompatible with an evolutionary psychological prediction\nthat gay men and lesbians will show patterns of jealousy analogous to heterosexual men\nand women, respectively. They are also incompatible with the predictions derived from six\nsocio-cultural explanations: the \"double-shot\" hypothesis (DeSteno and Salovey, 1996; see\nSex differences in jealousy\n\"discounting\" hypothesis (Sheets and Wolfe, 2001), the \"cognitive adaptation\" hypothesis\n(Sheets and Wolfe, 2001), the differential importance of sexual exclusivity (Harris, 2002),\ngender role adherence (Sheets and Wolfe, 2001), and differential need for social support\n(Sheets and Wolfe, 2001). As such, we believe the present results offer evidence most\nconsistent with an evolutionary origin of sex differences in jealousy.\nSexual Orientation and Evolved Sex Differences\nBailey et al. (1994) outlined three ways in which sexual orientation might be related\nto sex differences in mating psychology: (a) \"homosexual individuals may respond\nidentically to heterosexual individuals of the same sex\" (p. 1084), (b) \"homosexual\nindividuals may resemble opposite-sex heterosexual individuals in a given aspect of mating\npsychology\" (p. 1084), and (c) \"homosexual persons might show a pattern that exaggerates\nthe heterosexual sex difference\" (p. 1084). To these, we would add a fourth. In situations in\nwhich the solution to an adaptive problem carries risks (e.g., jealousy-motivated\naggression) or costs (e.g., reduced probability of obtaining romantic partners), the optimal\nstrategy for solving the problem might include implementing the solution (e.g.,\nexperiencing a sexually dimorphic increase in jealousy, rejecting a potential romantic\npartner) only when reproductive outcomes are at risk. In such situations, we would predict\nthat gay men and lesbians would show a pattern similar to whichever heterosexual sex\n(male or female) does not face the adaptive problem. Moreover, in situations in which\nheterosexual men and women each faced a different adaptive problem, gay men and\nlesbians would be expected to show a pattern similar to each other and in between\nheterosexual men and women.\nImplications for Other Mating Strategies\nBailey et al. (1994) examined six areas of mating psychology, uncommitted sex,\nvisual sexual stimuli, partner status, partner age, partner physical attractiveness, and\njealousy. Their results support a mix of the above models. For example, interest in\nuncommitted sex appears to be consistent with Bailey et al.'s first model, as men (both\nheterosexual and gay) expressed significantly greater interest than women (both\nheterosexual and lesbian) in short-term sexual opportunities. Importance of partner's status\nand sexual jealousy, in contrast, appear to be consistent with our proposed fourth model.\nHeterosexual women, the only group faced with the challenge of ensuring paternal\ninvestment, reported greater interest in partner status than any other group (as well as a\nnon-significant trend towards greater jealousy in response to emotional (versus sexual)\ninfidelity than any other group). Likewise, heterosexual men, the only group faced with the\nspecter of paternal uncertainty, reported greater jealousy in response to sexual (versus\nemotional) infidelity than any other group. Further work is needed to determine the nature\nand origin of the sex differences underlying preference for visual sexual stimuli, preferred\npartner age, and importance of physical attractiveness.\nNone of the six areas examined by Bailey et al. (1994) appear to be consistent with\nthe second model above (i.e., \"homosexual individuals [resembling] opposite-sex\nheterosexual individuals,\" p. 1084), leading to the question of whether any aspects of\nmating psychology conform to this model. We speculate that mate poaching (Schmitt and\nBuss, 2001), the attempt to steal a person out of an existing relationship, may conform to\nthis model, as the strategies used by a poacher would probably conform to the sexually\nSex differences in jealousy\ndimorphic desires of the target (e.g., men's interest in short-term sexual opportunities). As\nin the present study, further insight into the nature of these evolved mechanisms will\nrequire inclusion of a greater diversity of romantic partnerships.\nSimplicity versus Complexity\nWe anticipate the following objection to these conclusions: Why would evolved\nmechanisms take on the complexity necessary to distinguish context when more simple\n(e.g., perceiver based) mechanisms could confer the same benefits? This objection really\ncontains two presumptions: that simpler mechanisms can explain the observed differences,\nand that nature preferentially selects for simplicity. The first objection can be--and has\nbeen--answered empirically. Simpler models cannot adequately account for the data. The\nanswer to the second objection is more complex, but in general, we want to contend that\nevolutionary explanations should be wary of arguments of parsimony. Natural selection is a\ntinkerer, making use of existing adaptations and architectures but also being constrained by\nthem--it saticfices rather than optimizes. The massive complexity and interactivity of brain\nsystems at all levels certainly does not preclude complex solutions to adaptive problems.\nThe simple act of moving through a room requires a number of parallel informational\ninputs to be successful, and this coordination has evolved because of the recurrent nature of\nthe problem (see DeKay and Buss, 1992). Indeed, the Ecological perspective in psychology\n(e.g. Gibson, 1979; Reed, 1996) is founded on the premise that it is often complex, higher-\norder ratios of environmental variables which enable us to execute seemingly simple\nactions, and that neural systems have been selected to be attuned to these complexities.\nOur more general message is this: If we want to look for nature making use of\nsimplicity, it should not just be a simplicity of brain mechanisms but rather simplicity at the\nlevel of the information extant in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness, information\nwhich reliably predicts fitness costs and benefits. This should be an explicitly ecological\nposition wherein behavior is jointly specified by the neural mechanisms of the organism\nand the regularities of a dynamic environment (see Gibson's, 1979, concept of\naffordances). Consider the following example: animals avoid crashing into looming objects\nby attending not to single features of the environment but rather to the rate of an object's\nexpansion on the retina, a ratio of area to time (Lee and Reddish, 1981). This seemingly\ncomplex solution is actually simpler in the sense that the dynamic input uniquely specifies\nthe magnitude of the costs of maintaining the current velocity toward an object. Such an\necological position is already implicit in many of the canonical findings of evolutionary\npsychology. For example, it is not a human female's waist size or hip circumference that\npredicts men's judgments of attractiveness, but rather the ratio of these two measures\n(Singh, 1993). This is because the ratio (and not either of these measurements considered\nalone) is correlated with the amount of estrogen in the woman's system, and thus provides\na signal to her fertility. The present results present another such case. The assessment of\nreproductive threat requires at least three inputs: the sex of the perceiver, the sex of the\npartner, and sex of the rival. Nature selected such a mechanism because other constraints\nwould not have allowed a simpler mechanism to emerge.\n"
