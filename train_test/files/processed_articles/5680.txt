Based on this, we used an autobiographical narrative method in a constructivist paradigm to explore\nthis phenomenon that is autonomy. The coauthor's different experience developed the idea that difficulties lived by an\nentrepreneur can transform autonomy into dependence. This negative complex process is grounded on a request for help\nby the entrepreneur and the dissymmetric relation between the person who needs help and the support. This kind of\nrelationship promotes a loss of the entrepreneur's capacities. A non-co-construction of solution (by the entrepreneur and\nthe support) is not only less productive, but could also develop a very negative process. This finding is important to better\nunderstand support to entrepreneurs.\n",

A number of research projects\nsuggest that autonomy is an important entrepreneurial moti-\nbusiness people value independence and freedom. This con-\nfirms the need for autonomy and independence described by\nKets de Vries (1977). Several years later, this same author\nexplored the need for control experienced by entrepreneurs.\nThis need can be linked to the fears of being at the mercy of\nidea when he says that entrepreneurs do not like to be con-\ntrolled. The need for control is reflected in the concept of\nlocus of control. According to Rotter (1966), an individual's\nlocus of control can be either internal or external. While the\ninternal locus of control refers to an individual who believes\nthat events in his or her life are caused by factors that can be\ncontrolled, the external locus of control refers to an indi-\nvidual who attributes the cause of events to others, the envi-\nronment, destiny, or chance. Even if empirical data have not\nbeen able to strongly authenticate the links between the\ninternal locus of control and the entrepreneur, these links\nexist regardless (Janssen & Surlemont, 2009). Lumpkin and\nDess (1996) clarified what they mean by autonomy:\n\"Autonomy refers to the independent action of an individual\nor a team in bringing forth an idea or a vision and carrying it\nthrough to completion\" (p. 140). For Lumpkin, Cogliser,\nand Schneider (2009), autonomy is an important component\nof an entrepreneurial orientation (EO). A high level of\nautonomy within EO has \"show[n]a significantly higher\nlevel of performance than those with a lower level of EO\"\nthat may be present when a firm engages in new entry\nVan Gelderen and Jansen (2006) described the etymology\nof the word \"autonomy.\" It comes from two words: self\n(autos) and rule or law (nomos). According to these authors,\nthere is a broad consensus that \"autonomy means that indi-\nviduals make their own choice independent of others\" (Van\nGelderen & Jansen, 2006, p. 6). Autonomy is one of \"the\nqualities regularly attributed to the entrepreneurial personal-\nthe process to take advantage of a company's existing\nstrengths; it may help develop new ventures or improve busi-\nness practices. Autonomy is necessary to cultivate and\ndevelop entrepreneurial initiatives. Lumpkin and Dess\n(1996) defined autonomy as \"the independent action of an\nindividual or a team in bringing forth an idea or a vision and\ncarrying it through to completion\" (p. 140).\n1Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Rimouski, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nMarie-Noelle Albert, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Rimouski--Sc. de la gestion\nEmail: marie-noelle_albert@uqar.ca\nThe Support to an Entrepreneur:\nFrom Autonomy to Dependence\nMarie-No\u00eblle Albert1 and Marie-Mich\u00e8le Couture1\n Keywords\nentrepreneur, project, autonomy, support, autobiography, reflexive work\n2 SAGE Open\n(2006) distinguished two kinds of motives for autonomy:\ndistal and proximal. The proximal motive for autonomy is\nassociated with task characteristics, the sources of motiva-\ntion being located in the work itself. As autonomy is a deci-\nsional freedom, distal motives are often present in those\nwishing to start a business for themselves: to avoid a boss or\nrestriction, to act in a self-endorsed and self-congruent man-\nner, and to be in charge are three distal motives.\nInstead of Covin and Slevin's (1991) model that focuses\non the role of entrepreneurship as firm behavior (Lumpkin &\nDess, 1996), this article places the emphasis on the entrepre-\nneur as a person.\nIt is true that business people are often associated with\nautonomy and freedom or with the need to control their des-\ntiny. But this was not completely the case for one of the coau-\nthors of this article, the sole owner of a microbusiness.\nHowever, the coauthor's experience does not seem to be so\ndifferent from that of other entrepreneurs after all. Narratives\nby entrepreneurs abound because entrepreneurs are generally\ninclined to sharing their experiences and are happy to be the\nsubject of discussion (McKenzie, 2007). Most of these narra-\ntives involve heroes who have succeeded. This article will\npresent a narrative describing an entrepreneur grappling with\ndifficulties. The entrepreneur had a project that she knew\nmust be changed, resulting in her no longer feeling free and\nautonomous. The goal of our work was to examine this entre-\npreneur's transformation process, from her state of mind at\nthe beginning of her project to the feeling of being depen-\ndent. In this article, we wish to understand how supporting\nentrepreneurs may lead to a decrease in their autonomy and\nan increase in their dependence. First, we explain the meth-\nodology used: an autobiographical narrative method. Second,\nwe present autobiographical narratives and related work: the\nbirth of an idea and the need to review the project.\nMethod\nResearch in social sciences increasingly uses narratives and\nbiographical methods (Haynes, 2006). Historically, these\nmethods can be traced back all the way to the ancient Greeks\n(Gould, 2006), but they are not currently used in manage-\nment studies. For example, Boje and Tyler (2008) and\nspection is emerging in consumer research (Gould, 2012).\nDifferent kinds of similar approaches exist under different\nnames: autobiography, auto-ethnography, introspection,\npersonal narratives, narratives of the self, personal experi-\nence narratives, self-stories, first-person accounts, personal\nessays, auto-observations, personal ethnography, and reflex-\nive ethnography, among others. Researchers do not agree on\nthe limitations of each of these categories (Ellis and Bochner,\n2003). With all these reflexive methods, researchers seek to\nmake sense of personal experiences as opposed to existing\nresearch.\nThe use of autobiographical methods could be perceived\nas \"insufficiently rigorous, theoretical, and analytical\" (Ellis,\n\"Self-study researchers have also exhibited the need to wres-\ntle with the question of the validity of their studies\" (Feldman,\ntific content (in a positivist way; Hackley, 2007; Holbrooks,\nregard to the epistemological paradigm that has been chosen.\nFor this reason and to help legitimize it, this kind of method\nhas to be developed in a nonpositivist paradigm. In the para-\ndigm of pragmatic constructivism, research legitimizes\nknowledge by internal and external reflexive work. In this\ncase, knowledge is not found in the narrative, but is built\nfrom it.\nThe paradigm of pragmatic constructivism is based on\nradical constructivism as conceptualized by von Glasersfeld\nthis epistemological paradigm, knowledge neither claims to\nreflect an ontological reality (for nobody could rationally\nprove its existence) nor does it reveal its characteristics when\nthis reality exists. This constructivism is not so extreme that\nit rejects the notion of essence entirely (Grint, 1998). In this\nparadigm, while knowledge is being constructed, there is no\ndistinction between the inquirer and the phenomenon being\ninquired into. They simply cannot be distinguished because\nwhat results from the observer's viewpoint (an explicit or\nimplicit theoretical hypothesis) is that which influences\nobservations. Pragmatic constructivism considers that truth\nis meaningless because of the way knowledge is built from\nhuman representations to give meaning to situations in which\nthey are involved. Therefore, producing knowledge does not\nmean having a true representation of reality, but rather pos-\nsessing ways and means to understand life.\nBesides, in a constructivist epistemological framework,\nthe status of knowledge is openly acknowledged as a plau-\nsible hypothesis. This relies on the notion of generic knowl-\nedge as introduced by the pragmatist philosopher Dewey.\nGeneric knowledge involves knowledge about various kinds\nof things (Dewey, 1938), rather than knowledge about statis-\ntical regularities (Prasada, 2000). Generic knowledge has the\nparticularity that, to be utilized in a specific setting, it needs\nto be re-contextualized according to the idiosyncratic cir-\ncumstances of the setting in question.\nReflexive work is what researchers do when they behave\nas reflexive practitioners of scientific research. It consists of\ntracking what seems self-evident and digging into the\nimplicit assumptions made and the deep meaning of the\nnotions that are used or newly introduced. The researcher\noften uses a large body of academic literature to understand\nlocal knowledge, not to seem scientific but to stand back and\nunderstand it differently. As the word validation has a strong\nconnotation in a scientific context, that of having resisted all\nthe hypothesis testing performed hitherto, following Weick\n(1979), we prefer to use the term legitimization to refer to\nAlbert and Couture 3\nthe process by which some kind of validity is assigned to the\nknowledge that is built. Legitimization is not absolute, but\ncontext and goal-dependent. When researchers want to use\nautobiographical research methods and produce legitimized\nknowledge within the paradigm of pragmatic constructiv-\nism, they have to produce reflexive work. Autobiography is\ntherefore an abductive process (Minowa, Visconti, &\nMaclaran, 2012), that is to say, a constant back and forth\nbetween empirical information and the theories and con-\ncepts used to understand this process (Avenier, 2010). From\nour viewpoint, this means that an autobiographical narrative\nis not in and of itself scientific knowledge, but helps in its\nconstruction.\nSome Guidelines Could Help to\nLegitimize Knowledge That\nStems From Autobiography\nOn Writing Narrative\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Autobiographical self-studies should ring true and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Self-studies should promote insight and interpreta-\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Quality autobiographical self-studies attend care-\nfully to persons in context or setting\" (Bullough &\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Autobiographical self-study research must engage\nhistory forthrightly and the author must take an honest\nIt is essential that the reader believe the narrative that it\nseems realistic. This is called verisimilitude (Ellis, 2004). At\nfirst, an autobiographical narrative is written in a completely\nnaive way, without trying to understand, at the time of its\nwriting, what happened and why. Narrators simply talk about\nwhat they experienced and how they lived it, like talking\nabout their day when they get home from work or recounting\ntheir holidays to a friend. To provide specific context, practi-\ntioners/researchers must modify, rework, deconstruct, and\nreconstruct their narrative, until it is as exact and rigorous a\nreflection of their story as possible, just like it was lived. In\nother words, the text must be crystal clear to any reader. In\ncontrast to a literary autobiography, narrators must stay away\nfrom intrigue, mystery, and poetry. The narrative serves as\nempirical material for scientific research; it is not about enter-\ntainment, even though we may want it to be pleasant to read.\nOn Reflexive Work\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Authentic voice is a necessary but not sufficient con-\ndition for the scholarly standing of biographical self-\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Powerful autobiographical self-studies portray char-\nacter development and include dramatic action:\nSomething genuine is at stake in the story\" (Bullough\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Interpretations made of self-study data should not\nonly reveal but also interrogate the relationships, con-\ntradictions, and limits of the views presented\"\nWithin the paradigm of pragmatic constructivism, it is\nessential to carry out reflexive work to ensure the scientific\ncharacter of a study (Avenier, 2010). This is based on elab-\norated knowledge and the cognitive process involved in\nthe development of this knowledge. Because this work is\ndeliberate, it consists of questioning the real meaning hid-\nden behind the notions elaborated or mobilized, putting\nthem in theoretical and practical perspectives, articulating\nthem in the currently accepted knowledge, and proceeding\nto their deconstruction-reconstruction (Avenier & Schmitt,\nIn a continuous process, the narrative approach helps us\nunderstand the emergence of a phenomenon by identifying\nthe key moments that caused it, rather than by discerning the\nconditions that made its emergence necessary. The events\nwere explained by the story that made them what they are\n(Becker, 1998). Practitioners/researchers use this opportu-\nnity to revisit their narrative several times to find and develop\nwhat was at first implicit or unconscious. With this kind of\nresearch, we seek to learn \"how\" we know rather than con-\nfirm \"what\" we know, which is in line with approaches pro-\nResearch must be part of a distancing process, aiming to\ndifferentiate facts from perceptions. This process supposes\nthe explicitness of main elements on which this kind of work\nis based. To accomplish their autobiographical work,\nresearchers must compare and contrast personal experience\nagainst existing research (Ellis et al., 2010). They develop\npersonal narratives with diversified and heterogeneous sci-\nentific literature and theoretical frameworks from different\nacademic disciplines. In other words, the inquirer could\ndecontextualize knowledge through the systematic study of\nmultiple comparisons (Charmaz, 2003; Glaser & Strauss,\n1967). Conscious that their interpretation of lived events can\nnever be verified, practitioners/researchers have to appre-\nhend these events from diverse viewpoints. These new\nunderstandings trigger a reflection process, requiring the\nwriting of the other elements of the story that have emerged.\nThis new material must also be put to the test, and so on until\nsaturation.\nOn the Production of Generic Knowledge\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"The autobiographical self-study researcher has an\nineluctable obligation to seek to improve the learning\nsituation not only for the self but for the other\"\n4 SAGE Open\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Quality autobiographical self-studies offer fresh per-\nspectives on established truths\" (Bullough & Pinnegar,\nEven if the narrative is personal, it has to resonate with\nreaders; what is sought is neither the elaboration of singular\nstories nor a \"self-therapy\" exercise. The purpose of setting\nwords to the researcher's experience (local knowledge), with\nhindsight and rigor, is the elaboration of actionable knowl-\nedge by practitioners (generic knowledge), in other words, of\nestablishing heuristic benchmarks for actions (Avenier,\nThis method, where the researcher and the practitioner are\none, like any other involving a reflexive practitioner, pro-\nvides access to information that would not be revealed\nthrough questions or observations in other more \"traditional\"\nmethods. The meaning given to knowledge gained through\nexperience can be innovating or challenge other studies\n(1995) pointed out that generic knowledge expresses proper-\nties that are considered essential to characterize the studied\nphenomenon, even if in pragmatic constructivism generic\nknowledge is not invalidated by the existence of what might\nbe considered a counterexample. However, when using bio-\ngraphical methods in research, we must also consider that\nthere are undoubtedly limits to our knowledge of the past,\ndue to subjectivity, and even authors who are the protago-\nnists of their own story can reach these limits (Filion &\nAkizawa, 2012). While trying to be as sincere as possible,\neverything is not related or even relatable.\nThe generic knowledge presented in this article makes\nsense to other entrepreneurs and those who support them. We\npresented this knowledge to several people and they could\nrelate to it. Even if this is based only on the experiences of\none coauthor, we can still construct not only local knowledge\nbut also generic knowledge.\nAutobiographical Narrative and\nRelated Reflective Work\nThe autobiographical narrative and the reflective work are\npresented in chronological order to make them easier to read.\nThe narrative is divided into two parts: the birth of an idea\nand the need to review the project. Each piece of narrative is\nitalicized and followed by the related work.\nThe Birth of an Idea\nAlmost 20 years ago, my grandfather, who did not know how\nto read or write, passed away without having left us his\n\"salted onions\" recipe. What a calamity! It was one of the\nfamily's favorite condiments. After several years of suffering,\nwithout this much enjoyed condiment, I at last found an uncle\nwho had the recipe and was willing to give it to me.\nWonderful! Life could now go back to normal.\nAfter having eaten my fill of this much enjoyed condiment\nfor a good while, I thought to myself that this palace \"jewel\"\ndeserved to be known by all and shared like the Good News!\nOnce I had talked a little about this idea to those around me,\nI realized that this would not be easy: the product was com-\npletely unknown; its name meant \"unhealthy\"; the neces-\nsary investments could be significant; the market for this\ntype of condiment has been mostly taken over by Heinz and\nothers like it, and so on. In spite of all this, I made the recipe\nand, taking my courage in both hands, presented it to an\norganization for economic development. Following the\ninterview, I did not receive any news, not a phone call, not a\nword, not any advice, not even a procedure to follow . . . I\nwas disappointed. I must point out here that, just like prob-\nably a good many potential entrepreneurs, I felt insecure,\nabout my idea and the means to turn it into reality. Being\nsupported seemed essential for me to get my project off the\nground.\nSeven or eight years later, my career was at a dead end. I\nhad worked about 5 years at a job at which I was not suc-\ncessful and for which I was paid solely on commission. I had\nto find something else, but my personal circumstances made\nit necessary for me to stay in Rimouski, even though my com-\npetences would have been better suited to a big city. In the\nmeantime, I had almost finished an undergraduate degree in\nBusiness Management. I felt more confident in presenting a\nbusiness proposal to those involved. I enjoyed cooking, so I\nwanted to go back to my idea of the \"salted onions\" recipe.\nBut as I felt I had appeared completely crazy during my first\nattempt, this time I wanted to take more precautions.\nIf my family had almost lost its favorite recipe, there were\nlikely other families in the same situation. The idea of \"sav-\ning\" this heritage seemed interesting to me. I presented a\npreliminary project to an organization responsible for the\neconomic development of my region. (Obviously, if I had\nbeen lucky, this whole story would have been completely dif-\nferent.) The response I received left me puzzled: \"Your proj-\nect is too big. You should think about doing it step by step.\nYour kind of business is usually done on a very small scale.\nYou build your clientele little by little.\" On a small scale?\nYes, you make more than what you would normally at home,\nthen sell what is left over to people in your area who are\ninterested in the product, and so on. This is how your clientele\nwill grow. Once you have enough customers, then you can think\nabout building a company.\nBut I did not want a lucrative hobby! I wanted my own\nbusiness to earn a living! Considered stubborn, I went over\nmy project once more to make it \"work\" within the criteria\nof the development organization. Instead of a \"large fac-\ntory\" to preserve culinary traditions, I would make a very\nsmall local workshop, with products on sale locally.\nOnce more, I presented my project and was told that \"our\norganization is not involved in retail businesses.\" How could\nAlbert and Couture 5\nI be small and big? No problem! I knew that I was able to\nfinance the project with personal loans as it was, so I decided\nto risk it all.\nAt the beginning, the project did not fulfill the require-\nments of eligibility established by agencies that provide tech-\nnical assistance and funding, and it was too small for\nfinancial institutions. No problem! I decided to start out with\na personal loan. The real-estate market in my location did\nnot have any commercial space that met my needs, but never\nmind, I resigned myself to renting a space that was too big\nand too expensive, and poorly situated. I would work harder\nand that was it.\nBlock and Wagner (2010) noted a difference with respect\nto motivation when starting a business. The project initiator\n(the entrepreneur) is either attracted to entrepreneurship, to\nthe opportunities it offers, or brought to the project through\nnecessity. These kinds of entrepreneurships are tied to aspi-\nrations, motivations, and factors that influence human behav-\ntypes of motivation to start a business: pull or push motives,\ncost-benefit motives, depth-psychological motives (need for\nachievement, the need for power). Opportunity entrepreneur-\nship depends on \"pull\" factors, that is, whether business\nstart-ups generate material advantages or not, such as auton-\nomy, independence, freedom, money, challenges, social sta-\ntus, or even recognition (Carter, Gartner, Shaver, &\nship depends on \"push\" factors, that is, when development\nresults from the project initiator being in an adverse situa-\ntion, such as unemployment, layoff, or the threat of losing\none's job (Thurik, Carree, van Stel, & Audretsch, 2008).\nDespite innovations in the product and concept, the project\nour article focuses on emerged from a dead end on the labor\nmarket, making this a case of necessity entrepreneurship.\nHowever, necessity and opportunity can be said to mesh and\nmeld in this project. Dawson and Henley (2012) addressed\nthe conceptual ambiguities linked to the pull and push factors\ncategorization. They distinguish external push factors (lack\nof alternative opportunities and resources, as well as redun-\ndancy), external pull factors (resources, market opportuni-\nties,andinnovation),internalpushfactors(jobdissatisfaction,\nas well as family and financial constraints), and internal pull\nfactors (financial resources, autonomy, challenges, and per-\nceived self-efficacy). The entrepreneur felt free to carry out\nher project at that time: She interpreted the opportunity the\nproject offered as a way of meeting her needs (necessity).\nShe believed in her project. She had both pull and push,\ninternal and external, motivations. But in this case pull moti-\nvation was not based on business attractiveness as it is usu-\nally viewed (autonomy, independence, freedom, money,\nchallenges, social status, or even recognition); it was based\non the will to develop an interesting project.\nThe coauthor/entrepreneur's initial project was what\nmotivated her to start a business. Of course, she would have\nliked to make enough money to live on, but the main purpose\nof her project was to produce, sell, and promote traditional\nrecipes, not to make money per se.\nIn this study, the entrepreneur's representations of her aspi-\nrations, skills, and resources, and of the possibilities offered by\nher environment created a space in which she could plan her\nbusiness project (Bruyat & Julien, 2001). The project was con-\nsequently unique and personal as it was the product of a single\nindividual at a certain point in time. The space was clearly\ndefined by that person's representations, which were real only\nto her and reflected her personal view of her environment.\nThis strengthened the specific and unique character of the\nproject that would be developed in this realm of possibilities.\nThe entrepreneur sought to give meaning to the present by\nprojecting on it a potential future.Thus, taking action depended\non a perfect balance between the player (our entrepreneur),\nwhat attracted her, and the right moment (Fayolle, Basso, &\nTornikoski, 2011).Aproject initiator's environment is the goal\nLocated between the trigger and completion, the commit-\nment stage in Fayolle et al.'s (2011) entrepreneurial commit-\nment theory underlines a certain unrealistic optimism (UO)\ndescribed by Coelho (2010). UO refers to an underestimation\nof the likelihood of experiencing negative events and to an\noverestimation of the probability of experiencing positive\nevents (Weinstein & Klein, 1996, p. 2), that is, a mismatch\nbetween subjective and objective probabilities. Hence, UO\nimplies that the mean forecast errors are significantly differ-\nent from zero.\nMost people believe they have above-average abilities\nand have above-average chances of attaining a better future\nthan others. However, this egocentric bias does not appear\nonly when people compare themselves with others, but also\nin absolute terms. As commitment develops throughout the\nproject, the entrepreneur considers no obstacle as being too\ngreat to overcome. Escalating commitment (Staw, 1976)\nleads to irreversibility. Creating is perceived as preferable to\nany other project of change and resistance to change can be\novercome (Fayolle et al., 2011). We can therefore ask if UO\n(Coelho, 2010) is inevitable or essential for business project\ninitiators. Even if autonomy was not a motivating factor for\nour coauthor in becoming an entrepreneur, it helped her to\ntake control of her situation and start her business.\nNeed to Review the Project\nAfter operating for about a year, the business was not getting\noff the ground enough to break even, and I believed I was at\nthe end of my financial resources. Once more I appealed to\nthe Local Development Centre, which, this time, agreed to\nhelp me. The person responsible for my application was able\nto get me a small loan for young entrepreneurs and intro-\nduced me to another organization that agreed to pay for a\nmarketing consultant. At last, I received financing from a\ngovernment bank and a micro-credit organization.\n6 SAGE Open\nAfter all this preparation, what still remained was the\nimpression that the consultant lacked creativity. Yes, he had\nbrought in a new idea, but without any link to the primary\ngoal of the business or to my own aspirations. This left me\nwith a very strong feeling of being abandoned by the consul-\ntant because he didn't accompany me in the implementation\nof his solution (i.e., including a restaurant space reserved for\nsoups and sandwiches at the front of the store, for a better use\nof the space itself). This technical assistant/consultant did not\nmove beyond the theoretical level, then he \"disappeared,\"\nand the financial partners agreed to provide only the resources\nnecessary to the survival of the business, not the resources\nessential for the implementation of the whole plan.\nStill, the business survived another year, at which time it\nbecame increasingly obvious that its chances of success were\nvery slim. And here we go again! I started over once more:\nconsulting, planning, and giving up before the implementa-\ntion of the project. In fact, there was no implementation fol-\nlowing the second consultation. I did not think I had the\nresources or the means necessary to make it work.\nFrom that moment, while continuing to kick over the\ntraces, to rant, to get angry, and to fight for this project, I\nwas sad. Reapplying for help was not an easy task. I had to\nget to be convinced that I could be myself there. I needed\nsupport, knowledge, competent support from someone else.\nBut I had the impression of being left on my own, of being\nrobbed of my project. This was more challenging than it\nseemed, more than simply accepting help from the consultant\nand following the advice given. I had to take into account all of\nmy constraints. In fact, I didn't ask \"what to do\" or \"how to do\nit\" anymore. I asked for support in helping me reach my goal.\nMy enthusiasm, ambition, or dreams no longer had a place. It\nwaslikeamountainofrubblethatsuddenlyfellonme.Although\nI was strong and autonomous and I wanted to stay free in body\nand mind, at this point I had to accept that I couldn't do any-\nthing more by myself for this project. I felt small and fragile. I\nno longer had any choices. I was overwhelmed by everything .\n. . I didn't know what to do anymore.\nStill, it seemed like I remained confident because, over\ntime, I successfully convinced myself that I could still avoid\nthe worst. The consultant's ideas resurfaced: Transforming\nmy business into a \"fondue\" restaurant. I said farewell to the\noriginal project that I cherished, and presented this new\nproject to financial partners, who accepted it without ques-\ntioning where it might lead.\nAnd indeed, it was too little, too late, may be too far above\nmy expectations. My responsibilities turned into shackles,\nand after 18 months I had to close shop. I was in very bad\nshape, physically, morally, and financially.\nEpilogue: This experience certainly left marks, when\neverything was said and done. After a major surgery, a long\nperiod of rest, and a career change, I am now in perfect\nhealth, but I don't love cooking as much as before!\nWaele, Morval, and Sheitoyan (1993) defined the appro-\npriation process as the continuous flow of appropriation by\npeople, which contributes (through the learning and aware-\nness stages) to building reference points that enable people to\nfind their place in the organization where they work. One of\nthe flaws of the appropriation process may be the interpreta-\ntion of information based on prior mental schemas while\nblocking new data. People then deprive themselves of useful\nlessons and become attached to outdated and unsuitable\nbehaviors, which likely lead to failure (Waele et al., 1993).\nThe entrepreneur in this case could not accept advice from\nthe consultants because they did not correspond to her initial\nproject with which she had such strong emotional ties.\nConsulting changed the entrepreneur's goal, which was a\nmajor motivation to start her business. The consultant modi-\nfied the project (from the production of traditional recipes to a\nrestaurant). This transformation discouraged the entrepreneur.\nThe new project was too distant from her original project. This\ncreated a discomfort that led her to close her business. Advice\ncan be good or bad, but if it restricts entrepreneurs'autonomy,\nsuch advice can cause trouble. Shahidi (2012) explained that\nsome entrepreneurs should refuse to be supported because\nthey need independence, freedom, and the appropriation of\ntheir own creation. In our story, the consultant did not show\nher how, given her resources, she could implement the recom-\nmendations. Because of this, she did not manage to detach\nherself from her prior schemas. From her point of view, the\ninformation was not realistic and her projects did not seem to\nbe part of any plausible future. She may have felt as if she was\ngetting double-speak from the consultant. He gave her advice\nwith solutions that took into consideration neither her project\nnor her means, despite the fact that the project was her first\nmotive to start her business. This kind of behavior displayed\nby consultants can inhibit awareness and curiosity (Waele et al.,\n1993). In our case, the consultant refused to get involved in the\nimplementation of the project, using as reason that he did not\nwant to hinder the entrepreneur's autonomy. These contradic-\ntions can make the appropriation process difficult and foster a\nThis can be perceived as a paradox. Autonomy is very\nimportant for entrepreneurs. It helps them turn their projects\ninto reality. Seeking support may put the entrepreneur in a\nweak position, which may increase the perception of their\nneed for help. This perceived weakness may in turn decrease\nthe entrepreneur's autonomy. There is an unequal relation-\nship between the consultant and the entrepreneur. This sup-\nport, even if well intended could create a perception of\nvulnerability where the entrepreneur is concerned. Seeking\nhelp may decrease self-esteem. There may be a social stigma\nattached to seeking professional help, that is, the fear that\npeople may judge a person negatively if he or she seeks help\n(Vogel, Wade, Wester, Larson, & Hackler, 2007). This fear\nabout others'perception was interiorized by our entrepreneur\nwith his generalized \"other\" that may foster a feeling of\nincompetence. When consultants propose their own solu-\ntions they risk hindering entrepreneurs'autonomy. With their\nAlbert and Couture 7\nadvice, consultants apply informal pressure, whether inten-\ntionally or not. In our case, the coauthor/entrepreneur felt\nforced to follow her consultant's advice, although it was not\na formal obligation. Even if she did not like it, she thought\nthat she had to do what the consultant suggested. This infor-\nmal power seemed to hinder the entrepreneur's autonomy.\nBauman and D\u00f6ring (2011) distinguished the condition of\nautonomy from the capacity for autonomy.\nBeing autonomous presupposes that a person has several\ncapacities, most prominently capacities for self-reflection and\nrationality (rational self-control). But merely having these\ncapacities does not guarantee that a person is autonomous\nbecause other persons or the social environment she lives in\nmight prevent her from effectively exercising them. (Bauman &\nLee and Lim (2009) measured autonomy with three items:\n\"I always complete everything I initiate. I am always posi-\ntive about problems arising in my life, and solve them on my\nown. Even if I fail many times, I will keep on trying until I\nsucceed on this business\" (p. 9). If we use this type of mea-\nsure, our coauthor/entrepreneur could be considered as being\nautonomous. She maintained autonomous capacities, but in\nthis context, she was not fully autonomous. According to\nSt Jean and Audet (2012), mentors have to adopt a maieutic\nstyle rather than a directive style. In this case, the mentored\nretain their autonomy. \"A situation that threatens persons'\nself-view, the view others have of them, and/or the quality of\ntheir relationships and interpersonal exchanges, may dimin-\nish their sense of self-esteem and self-efficacy\" (Pierce,\nBaldwin, & Lydon, 1997, p. 29). \"Self-belief does not neces-\nsarily ensure success, but self-disbelief assuredly spawns\nskillful use of skills already established. If self-efficacy is\nlacking, people tend to behave ineffectually, even though\nSuch a situation may lead to dependence and incapacity to\nact. Support may therefore incapacitate a person and have\nthe opposite effect than intended. Support meant to increase\nefficiency often supposes an equal relationship between the\nentrepreneur and the person offering support, where solu-\ntions can be co-constructed. Co-construction does not lead to\na perception of inferiority and takes into account what is very\nimportant to the entrepreneur (in our case, her project).\nWilliams (1995) focuses on the importance of the need and\nthe wish to have a reciprocal relationship between support\nand recipient. Figure 1 shows how seeking help, feeling\nweak, and influencing autonomy can interact and induce\ndependence and loss of the entrepreneur's capacities.\nConclusion\nThe purpose of this article was to examine the transformation\nprocess of a specific entrepreneur, from autonomy to per-\nceived dependence. We explained how support may decrease\nautonomy and develop dependence in entrepreneurs. An\nunequal relationship between an entrepreneur who needs\nhelp and a support person who gives advice may have a very\nnegative impact on entrepreneurs (and their business).\nCoaches and mentors should work toward the co-construc-\ntion of solutions (the entrepreneur and the support person) to\nbe more productive and avoid a possibly very negative pro-\ncess. However, entrepreneurs who face difficulties and need\nhelp can easily get support from consultants who hand out\nready-made solutions, although this may indeed lead to fur-\nther difficulties.\nFeeling\nWeak\nImpacting\nAutonomy\nDependence\nLoss of\nCapacities\nSeeking\nhelp\nFigure 1.
