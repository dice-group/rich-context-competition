The sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of\nHigh Blood Pressure (JNC VI) recently recommended that risk strata, in addition to BP levels, be considered in the\ntreatment of hypertension. We estimated the absolute benefit associated with a 12 mm Hg reduction in systolic BP over\n10 years according to the risk stratification system of JNC VI using data from the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study. The number-needed-to-treat to prevent a cardiovascular\nevent/death or a death from all causes was reduced with increasing levels of baseline BP in each of the risk strata. In\naddition, the number-needed-to-treat was much smaller in persons with 1 additional major risk factor for\ncardiovascular disease (risk group B) and in those with a history of cardiovascular disease or target organ damage (risk\ngroup C) than in those without additional major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (risk group A). Specifically, the\nnumber-needed-to-treat to prevent a death from all causes in patients with a high-normal BP, stage 1 hypertension, or\nB; and 14, 12, and 9 for those in risk group C. Our analysis indicated that the absolute benefits of antihypertensive\ntherapy depended on BP as well as the presence or absence of additional cardiovascular disease risk factors and the\npresence or absence of preexisting clinical cardiovascular disease or target organ damage.

Whelton\n Key Words: blood pressure  cardiovascular diseases  mortality  risk factors\nHypertension is an important public health challenge in\nthe United States because of its high prevalence and the\nconcomitant increase in the risk of cardiovascular/renal dis-\nease. As many as 43 million Americans have hypertension,\nwhich is defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP)\nand/or taking antihypertensive medications.1 According to the\nAmerican Heart Association, in 1997, the estimated direct\nhealth costs (physician or other healthcare provider visits,\nhospital/nursing home stays, and antihypertensive medica-\ntions) of the care of patients with hypertension in the United\nStates were $21.8 billion; the associated indirect costs (lost\nproductivity due to morbidity and mortality) were $8.2\nbillion.2 Moreover, hypertension is the most important mod-\nifiable risk factor for coronary heart disease (the leading\ncause of death in the US population), stroke (the third leading\ncause of death), congestive heart failure, end-stage renal\ndisease, and peripheral vascular disease.3\u00ad6\nProspective studies have repeatedly identified an increas-\ning risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and renal insuffi-\nciency with progressively higher levels of both SBP and\nDBP.3\u00ad6 These studies have demonstrated a positive, contin-\nuous, and independent association between BP and the\nincidence of coronary heart disease, stroke, congestive heart\nfailure, and end-stage renal disease. They showed no evi-\ndence of a J-shaped relationship or a threshold below which\nincreasing levels of BP are not associated with a correspond-\ning increase in the risk of stroke, coronary heart disease, and\nrenal disease. Furthermore, they suggest that the association\nof SBP with these outcomes is stronger than that of DBP.\nRandomized, controlled trials have demonstrated that antihy-\npertensive drug therapy reduces the risk of cardiovascular\ndisease and stroke among patients with mild hypertension.6\u00ad9\nTraditionally, BP levels alone were used to make treatment\ndecisions in patients with hypertension. This approach was\nbased on the fact that elevated BP is an important indicator of\nthe relative risk of cardiovascular disease among groups. This\napproach worked well for treatment decisions made in pa-\ntients with moderate or more severe forms of hypertension\n(stages 2 to 3), but it is less well suited for treatment decisions\nin patients with milder elevations of BP. The recently\npublished sixth report of the Joint National Committee on the\nPrevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood\nPressure (JNC VI) emphasized the importance of absolute, as\nFrom the Departments of Biostatistics (L.G.O.) and Epidemiology (J.H., P.K.W.), Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine,\nNew Orleans, La, and SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals (E.L.), Collegeville, Pa.\nCorrespondence to Jiang He, MD, PhD, Department of Epidemiology, Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, 1430 Tulane\nHypertension is available at http://www.hypertensionaha.org\nScientific Contributions\nopposed to relative, risk in clinical decision-making.10 For the\nfirst time, the JNC report presented a risk stratification system\nthat was based not only on an individual's average BP level, but\nalso on the presence or absence of target organ damage or other\nrisk factors.10 The objectives of our study were to evaluate the\nabsolute benefit derived from treating hypertension according to\nthe JNC VI risk stratification system using the National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey I Epidemiologic Follow-up\nStudy (NHEFS) population.\nMethods\nStudy Population\nIn the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES I), a multistage, stratified, probability sampling design\nwas used to select a representative sample of the US civilian\npopulation subgroups, including those with a low income, women of\nchildbearing age (25 to 44 years), and elderly persons (65 years or\nolder) were oversampled. The NHEFS is a prospective cohort study\nof NHANES I participants who were 25 to 74 years of age when the\npersons in this age range at baseline, 1473 were excluded because\nthey had taken antihypertensive medication within the preceding 6\nmonths, and 306 were excluded because information on important\nbaseline covariables was missing. Of the remaining 12 628 partici-\nparticipants for inclusion in the current analysis.\nData Collection\nBaseline data collection included information on medical history,\nstandardized medical examinations, dietary history, laboratory tests,\nand anthropometric measurements.11,12 At the beginning of the\nbaseline physical examination, a physician measured BP once with\nthe examinee seated. With few exceptions, a standard mercury\nsphygmomanometer and a cuff that was at least 20% wider than the\ndiameter of the arm (13 cm or 9.5 cm) was used to measure the\nparticipant's BP level. American Heart Association guidelines were\nfollowed. Blood samples were obtained, and frozen serum was sent\nto the Centers for Disease Control for the determination of serum\ntotal cholesterol. The baseline questionnaire on medical history\nincluded questions about selected health conditions and medications\nused for these conditions during the preceding 6 months. Baseline\ninformation on smoking status was obtained in a random subsample\nof 6142 participants who underwent more detailed baseline exami-\nnation.11,12 For the remaining study participants, information on\nsmoking status at baseline was derived from responses to questions\non lifetime smoking history that were obtained during follow-up\nobtained using this approach has been documented.17,18\nexamination, a participant or his/her proxy was tracked to a current\naddress. The examination included an in-depth interview with the\nparticipant or proxy. In addition, relevant hospital and nursing home\nrecords were obtained, including pathology reports and electrocar-\ndiograms. A death certificate was requested for all decedents.\nMortality from cardiovascular disease was based on death certificate\nreports. Incident cardiovascular disease was based on documentation\nof an event that met prespecified study criteria and occurred during\nthe period between the participant's baseline examination and the\nlast follow-up interview. The validity of study outcome data from\nboth sources has been documented.19\nCause-specific mortality was identified by means of underlying\ncause of death reports using the following codes from the Interna-\ntional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision: 410 to 414\n(cardiovascular disease). A new cardiovascular disease event was\nbased on a death certificate report in which the underlying cause of\nnursing home stays in which the participant had a discharge\nRisk Stratification\nRisk of cardiovascular disease in hypertensive patients is determined\nby the BP level and the presence or absence of target organ damage\nor other risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, dyslipidemia, and\ndiabetes. The JNC VI report recommended a risk stratification\nsystem that is based on 3 categories of BP and 3 risk groups (A, B,\nand C).10 The 3 BP categories (SBP/DBP) are as follows: high-\n100 mm Hg). Risk group A includes patients who do not have\nclinical cardiovascular disease, target organ damage, or other car-\ndiovascular disease risk factors. Risk group B includes patients who\ndo not have clinical cardiovascular disease, target organ damage, or\ndiabetes but who do have 1 other cardiovascular disease risk\nfactor, such as smoking, dyslipidemia, age60 years, male sex,\npostmenopausal status (in women), or a family history of cardiovas-\ncular disease. Risk group C includes patients with diabetes mellitus,\nclinically manifest cardiovascular disease, or target organ damage.10\nIn the present analysis, risk group B included men, postmenopausal\nwomen, or those who were 60 years of age, current smokers, or\nhad a serum total cholesterol 240 mg/dL. Risk group C included\nparticipants who had a self-reported history of diabetes, heart attack,\nheart failure, stroke, or renal disease or who had evidence of these\nconditions during their baseline examination.\nStatistical Analysis\nPoisson regression analysis was used to model the relationship\nbetween SBP and mortality from all-cause or cardiovascular dis-\neases. Categorization and quadratic terms were used to test the\nlinearity of log mortality on SBP. In addition, the differences in\nregression coefficients of log mortality on SBP among the 4 BP\nusing interaction terms. Because no evidence of deviation from\nlinearity or of interaction among the different levels of BP existed, an\noverall model was used for each outcome. Risk differences among\nthe 3 groups were modeled using separate intercepts and interaction\nterms. SBP levels were centralized to their mean value before\nperforming regression analyses to stabilize the estimates of regres-\nsion coefficients on total and cardiovascular mortality and cardio-\nvascular incidence. The Poisson regression models for cumulative\nlog mortality (event rate) over a 10-year period were as follows:\nTo estimate the absolute reduction in the risk of mortality associated\nwith a 12 mm Hg drop in SBP over a 10-year period of follow-up\namong the 9 groups defined by different BP levels and cardiovascular\ndisease risk, we first calculated the 10-year probability of death using\nobserved data from the NHEFS population. We then calculated the\n10-year probability of death for each participant assuming a 12 mm Hg\nreduction in SBP throughout the period. The difference between the 2\nprobabilities represents the reduction in absolute risk that could be\nexpected from a 12 mm Hg reduction in SBP. The number-needed-to-\ntreat was calculated by taking the reciprocal of the absolute reduction in\nrisk, which represents the number of patients who would have to be\ntreated to prevent 1 outcome event. The number-needed-to-treat is a\nuseful way of expressing the degree of benefit that can be expected from\na healthcare intervention.20,21 To correct for regression dilution bias, we\ncalculated the coefficient of reliability using BP measurements at\nbaseline and at the 10-year follow-up examination.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the distribution of the 7090 NHEFS partici-\npants who had high-normal BP or hypertension according to\ntheir baseline level of BP and category of presumed cardio-\nvascular risk. Slightly less than a third of the participants\nsion, and 29.3% had stage 2 or 3 hypertension. A small\nminority (9.0%) of the study participants had no other risk\nfactors for cardiovascular disease and no evidence of target\norgan damage or clinical cardiovascular disease (risk group\nA). The vast majority, however, had 1 other risk factor for\ncardiovascular disease (71.7%; risk group B), and a substan-\ntial minority had a current history of diabetes or of other\ncardiovascular or renal diseases (19.2%; risk group C).\nThe number-needed-to-treat to prevent a cardiovascular dis-\nease event, with or without correction for regression dilution\nbias, is presented in Table 2. The number was determined using\nan average reduction of 12 mm Hg in SBP over 10 years of\nfollow-up. As expected, the number was reduced with increasing\nlevels of baseline BP in each of the risk groups. The number-\nneeded-to-treat was also smaller among persons who had major\nrisk factors or who had a history of cardiovascular diseases (risk\ngroups B and C) compared with their counterparts in risk group\nA, who did not have additional risk factors for cardiovascular\ndisease. For example, to prevent a cardiovascular event, the\nnumber-needed-to-treat for high-normal BP, stage 1 hyperten-\nsion, or stage 2 or 3 hypertension, respectively, was 25, 20, and\n8 in risk group C.\nThe number-needed-to-treat to prevent a cardiovascular death\nwas also reduced with increasing levels of baseline BP in each of\nthe risk groups (Table 3). However, this reduction was particu-\nlarly prominent in those without a major risk factor for cardio-\nvascular disease (risk group A). In this group, the number-\nneeded-to-treat was 486 for persons with high-normal BP, 273\nfor those with stage 1 hypertension, and 34 for their counterparts\nwith stage 2 or 3 hypertension. The number-needed-to-treat to\nprevent a cardiovascular death was much smaller among persons\nwith major risk factors or with a history of cardiovascular\ndiseases (risk groups B and C) than in those who did not have\nadditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease (risk group A).\nFor example, the number-needed-to-treat for persons with high-\nnormal BP, stage 1 hypertension, or stage 2 or 3 hypertension,\n11 for risk group C.\nThe number-needed-to-treat to prevent a death from all\ncauses is presented in Table 4. In each of the risk groups, the\nnumber-needed-to-treat was reduced with increasing levels of\nbaseline BP. In addition, the number was much smaller in\npersons who had 1 additional major risk factor for cardio-\nvascular disease (risk group B) and in those with a history of\ncardiovascular disease or target organ damage (risk group C)\nthan in those in risk group A. Specifically, the number-\nneeded-to-treat for persons with high-normal BP, stage 1\nhypertension, or stage 2 or 3 hypertension, respectively, was\nin risk group B; and 14, 12, and 9 for those in risk group C.\nDiscussion\nThere are 22.7 million US residents aged 18 years who\ntake medications that have been prescribed for the treatment\nof high BP.1 Only a small proportion of the almost 55 million\nUS adults with either known high BP (43.2 million) or a\nhistory of high BP (12.7 million) have clinical symptoms, and\nTABLE 1.

The main objective in lowering BP is\nto reduce the patient's absolute risk of premature death and\ndisease, primarily by reducing their risk of cardiovascular\ndiseases. In the US, 13% and 14% of the adult population,\nrespectively, has high-normal BP or stage 1 hypertension.1 In\ncontrast, only 4% and 1% of the adult population, respec-\ntively, has stages 2 to 3 hypertension.1 Epidemiological\nstudies and randomized trials have repeatedly demonstrated\nthat the relative risk of cardiovascular disease increases\ncontinuously with increasing levels of BP.3\u00ad9 However, no\nspecific BP level identifies the need for antihypertensive\ntreatment in an individual patient. We compared the expected\nabsolute benefits of BP lowering in the patients in the 9\ngroups characterized by baseline BP level and cardiovascular\ndisease risk. Our results indicate that the clinical decision to\ntreat high BP should be based on a person's average BP levels\nas well as on the presence or absence of other cardiovascular\ndisease risk factors.\nAn important strength of our study is that we were able to\ncalculate the number-needed-to-treat to prevent an event\nusing a large representative sample of the US general popu-\nlation. An additional strength was that the outcomes of\ninterest (cardiovascular and total mortality) were assessed\nover a prolonged period of follow-up, which averaged 20\nyears. A 12 mm Hg reduction in SBP was chosen as the\ntreatment effect of interest because it represents the average\nBP reduction that has been achieved in the major randomized\ncontrolled trials that have been conducted to determine the\nefficacy of antihypertensive drug treatment in reducing car-\ndiovascular disease risk.6 If a larger reduction in SBP were\nachieved in hypertensive patients, a greater benefit on mor-\nbidity and mortality might be observed. Likewise, the BP-\nlowering benefit might be increased with more prolonged\ntreatment for hypertension than was the case in the databases\nwe used. Previous analyses have indicated that the reduction\nin stroke risk observed in clinical trials is similar to that\nexpected on the basis of the risk associated with high BP in\nobservational studies.3,7 However, the reduction in risk for\ncoronary heart disease in clinical trials is less than expected\nwhen based on results from observational studies. One\nexplanation for the latter discrepancy is that the clinical trials\nfrom which the estimates of coronary heart disease risk\nreduction were derived had a much shorter average duration\n(3 to 5 years) than the corresponding experience in observa-\ntional studies (10 years).\nOur analysis supports the JNC VI recommendation to\nprescribe drug treatment as the initial therapy in patients with\nstages 2 to 3 hypertension and in those who have lower BP\nlevels when these persons have diabetes, target organ disease,\nor cardiovascular disease.10 Moreover, our results suggest that\ntreatment of those with high-normal BP or stage 1 hypertension\nwho concurrently have 1 other major risk factor for cardio-\nvascular disease is cost-effective. In such patients, the number-\nneeded-to-treat was similar to that noted in their counterparts\nwith stages 2 to 3 hypertension who did not have an additional\nmajor risk factor for cardiovascular disease.\nOnly a minority (9.0%) of those with a high-normal BP or\nhypertension did not have additional risk factors for cardio-\nvascular disease. The number-needed-to-treat was high in this\ngroup, especially in persons with high-normal BP or stage 1\nhypertension. Therefore, lifestyle modification may provide a\nmore meaningful approach for lowering BP in this group.\nOverall, antihypertensive treatment is a cost-effective ap-\nproach to the reduction of cardiovascular disease and total\nmortality compared with the treatment of other cardiovascu-\nlar disease risk factors. For example, pooling the experience\nof the 5 major trials evaluating the 3-hydroxy-3-\nmethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors indicated\nTABLE 3.

On the\nbasis of our analysis, the number-needed-to-treat to prevent\nmortality from cardiovascular disease or all causes in patients\nwith stages 2 to 3 hypertension or in patients with high-\nnormal BP or hypertension who had 1 other major risk\nfactor for cardiovascular disease or a prior history of cardio-\nvascular disease is similar or even lower. Results from the\nrecently published UK Prospective Diabetes Study indicate\nthat the number-needed-to-treat to prevent 1 death related to\ndiabetes is 15 for an average reduction in SBP/DBP of\nwith hypertension.23 The benefit of BP control may be greater\nthan blood-glucose control among these patients.23,24\nIn our study participants, only a single BP measurement\nwas obtained at the baseline examination. This imperfect\nmeasurement of BP might have resulted in a misclassification\nof our study participants into the different BP categories and\na consequent dilution of our estimates of absolute risk.\nBecause of this, we entered SBP as a continuous variable in\nthe risk equations to avoid estimating absolute risk based on\nBP category. Furthermore, a repeated measurement of BP at\nthe 10-year follow-up was used to correct for the possibility\nof regression dilution bias. These strategies should have\nminimized the potential for bias due to imperfections in the\nmeasurement of BP at the baseline examination.\nIn conclusion, our analysis demonstrates that the absolute\nbenefits of antihypertensive therapy depend not only on BP\nbut also on the presence or absence of additional cardiovas-\ncular disease risk factors and the presence or absence of\npreexisting clinical cardiovascular disease or target organ\ndamage. These findings have important implications for\nclinical practice and public health. To make an informed\ndecision regarding the wisdom of initiating antihypertensive\ndrug treatment for high BP, the practicing clinician must\nassess the absolute risk of an individual patient by determin-\ning the presence or absence of other cardiovascular disease\nrisk factors and the presence or absence of clinical cardio-\nvascular disease or target organ damage. To improve the\ncost-effectiveness of antihypertensive interventions in com-\nmunity programs, an emphasis should be placed on targeting\nhigh-risk populations. Our study also suggests that a need\nexists for more aggressive BP lowering among those with\nhigh-normal or stage 1 hypertension who concurrently have\n1 additional major risk factors for cardiovascular disease.\n"
