Bronchiolitis poses a sig-\nnificant health problem in high-income countries,\nbut it is an even greater problem in low- and mid-\ndle-income countries (LMICs), due to higher\nAlthough several clinical practice guidelines\n(CPGs) of acceptable quality have been devel-\noped [Rodr\u00edguez-Mart\u00ednez et al. 2016], there is\nstill significant unexplained variability in the clini-\ncal practice [Christakis et al. 2005; Florin et al.\n2014]. This variability has been associated with\ninappropriate use and overuse of medications\nwith insufficient evidence of effectiveness [Ochoa\nSangrador et al. 2014] and the use of unnecessary\ndiagnostic tests [Rodr\u00edguez Mart\u00ednez and Sossa\nBrice\u00f1o, 2011], generating unnecessary and\ncostly resource use with no improvement in\nimportant clinical outcomes [Christakis et al.\n2005]. In an attempt to reduce the variability in\nclinical practice for bronchiolitis, several different\nCPGs have been developed [Rodr\u00edguez Mart\u00ednez\net al. 2016], but many physicians fail to prescribe\nin accordance with these CPGs [Florin et al.\n2014]. This lack of impact of CPGs on physician\nbehavior has been deemed to be associated with\nthe persistence of variability in the use of medica-\ntions, diagnostic tests, and resources despite lack\nof strong evidence supporting recommendations\nfor their routine use [Florin et al. 2014].\nPrevious evidence has suggested that develop-\nment of CPGs alone may not change physician\nbehavior; it may also be necessary to execute an\nimplementation strategy showing how the rec-\nommendations can be put into practice [Florin\net al. 2014]. The development and implementa-\ntion of evidence-based clinical pathways has been\nshown to positively impact clinically important\noutcomes such as use of unnecessary diagnostic\ntests, use of medications with insufficient evi-\ndence of effectiveness, and length of stay\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, no previ-\nous study has investigated if the development\nand implementation of evidence-based bronchi-\nolitis CPGs improve clinically important out-\ncomes in LMICs. Additionally, while some\nstudies have found good self-reported compli-\nance with local bronchiolitis CPGs, this method\nof reporting compliance is potentially inaccurate\nand could provide information of what physi-\ncians think they do rather than what they actually\nThe objective of the present single-center study\nwas to assess the impact of the implementation of\nan evidence-based bronchiolitis CPG on physi-\ncian behavior and the care of infants with bron-\nchiolitis by comparing pre-guideline and\npost-guideline use of diagnostic tests and medica-\ntions through an electronic medical record review\nin one of the most representative children's hospi-\ntals in Bogota, Colombia. We also sought to\nassess the impact of the implementation of the\nCPG on clinically important outcomes such as\nlength of stay, hospital admissions, intensive care\nadmissions, and hospital readmissions.\nMethods\nStudy site\nThe Fundacion Hospital La Misericordia is a ter-\ntiary care university-based children's hospital\nlocated in the metropolitan area of Bogota, the\ncapital city of Colombia, a tropical LMIC located\nin South America. The hospital has 287 beds and\nas well as other cities of the country. For the lat-\nter, it mainly functions as a referral center that\n2000 are due to bronchiolitis) and registers more\nwhich about 3000 are due to bronchiolitis). The\nmajority of admissions to the hospital come from\nthe emergency department and from inpatient\ntransfers from outlying primary and secondary\nclinics and hospitals. All emergency and inpatient\nservices are provided with the assistance of pedia-\ntricians, residents, interns, and medical students.\nGuideline development\nThe evidence-based bronchiolitis CPG used in\nthe present study was developed by a team com-\nprised of resident pediatricians, pediatric pulmo-\nnologists, and clinical epidemiologists, supported\nby the Institute for Clinical Investigations,\nUniversidad Nacional de Colombia. Because\ninternational CPGs from authoritative sources\nmay not be directly applicable to a local setting\nand rigorous guideline development often carries\nsignificant personnel, resource, and time implica-\ntions, the team decided to adapt high quality\nexisting CPGs.\nFor this purpose, the first step was to conduct a\nsystematic search for CPGs on the diagnosis or\ntreatment of acute viral bronchiolitis in infants\nR Henao-Villada, MP Sossa-Brice\u00f1o et al.\nrestriction. We did not search for CPGs pub-\nlished before 2010 because evidence-based CPGs\nneed to be updated regularly and the resultant\nCPG developed was concerned with the most up-\nto-date evidence. The systematic search for CPGs\nwas carried out by searching in the TRIP (Turning\nResearch into Practice) database web sites of\nmajor international agencies that elaborate or\ncompile CPGs, clearinghouse websites, Google,\nGoogle Scholar, and the US National Library of\nMedicine database (through PubMed). A trial\nsearch coordinator with the Iberoamerican\nCochrane Collaboration provided search support\nfor the review team authors.\nThe process of identification and selection of\nappropriate and relevant documents yielded three\nCPGs for further quality evaluation. The AGREE\nII instrument was used to evaluate the quality of\nthe selected CPGs because this tool is currently\nthe most widely accepted and validated instru-\nment for appraising the quality of CPGs [Brouwers\net al. 2010]. In total, two independent reviewers\nwith experience in developing and appraising\nCPGs evaluated the three selected CPGs using\nthe AGREE II instrument, which was pilot-tested\nto ensure proper use. After comparing the scores\nof the three selected CPGs, the CPG of the\nSpanish National Healthcare System [Working\nGroup of the Clinical Practice Guideline on Acute\nBronchiolitis and Sant Joan de D\u00e9u Foundation,\n2010] was rated as `recommended', and was the\nselected CPG for the adaptation process.\nHowever, due to the fact that classic adaptation of\nCPGs could also involve a long and costly pro-\ncess, the team developed and used a short-term\nstrategy for the adaptation process [Galindo et al.\n2014]. The adaptation of the selected CPG\nstarted in September 2013, and was carried out\nover a period of 6 months. The complete adapta-\ntion process comprised the following steps: (1)\ncreating a coordinating committee; (2) prioritiz-\ning the conditions for the CPG; (3) building the\nGuidelines Adaptation Group; (3) defining the\nguideline's scope and objectives; (4) searching for\nthe CPG; (5) selecting related titles (two review-\ners); (6) assessing the quality using the AGREE II\ninstrument (two reviewers); (7) selecting the\nguidelines to be adapted; (8) defining the rele-\nvance of the adapted CPG questions (five maxi-\nmum); (9) assessing the need for a new question\nto be answered; (10) searching for tables of evi-\ndence; (11) validating the qualification of the\nevidence; (12) adjusting the recommendations to\nthe local context; and (13) drawing up the final\nGuideline content\nThe resultant CPG after the adaptation process\nrecommends against routine use of diagnostic\ntests such as a hemogram, C-reactive protein, and\nprocalcitonin and suggested that C-reactive pro-\ntein and procalcitonin should be ordered only for\ninfants with suspected serious bacterial infec-\ntions. Likewise, the CPG recommends against\nroutine use of chest radiography, suggesting that\nit should be ordered only for infants with diagnos-\ntic uncertainty, severe disease, or an atypical dis-\nease course.\nWith respect to the pharmacological treatment,\nthe CPG also recommends against routine use of\ninhaled bronchodilators (beta 2 agonists, anticho-\nlinergics), nebulized epinephrine, and anti-inflam-\nmatories (inhaled or systemic corticosteroids), but\nallows for the option of a monitored trial of inhaled\nbronchodilators or nebulized epinephrine, con-\ntinuing their administration only if there is a docu-\nmented positive clinical response to the trial using\nan objective means of evaluation. Finally, the\nCPG also recommends that nebulized hypertonic\nsaline could be administered to infants hospital-\nized for bronchiolitis in order to shorten hospital\nstay, but recommends against its use in the emer-\ngency department.\nGuideline implementation\nStandardized educational strategies were imple-\nmented in the study hospital in two phases\nbetween February and March 2015. The first\nphase was carried out in February 2015 and com-\nprised individual educational interventions tar-\ngeting general practitioners and pediatricians\nworking in the emergency department and in the\ngeneral ward. The second phase was carried out\nin March 2015 and involved group educational\ninterventions targeting pediatric residents, gen-\neral practitioners, and pediatricians. A Power\nPoint presentation showing levels of evidence and\ngrades for the main recommendations of the\nnewly-developed CPG was used in the second\nphase. Both phases were complemented by an\ninteractive session of questions and answers.\nAdditionally, in both phases each participant was\ngiven written material containing the levels of evi-\ndence and grades for the main recommendations\nTherapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease 10(5)\nof the newly developed CPG and a validated scale\nfor assessing the severity of bronchiolitis. The\nabove mentioned implementation strategy was\ncomplemented by the availability of an easily\naccessible written version of the CPG in the elec-\ntronic medical record platform.\nStudy design and study population\nWe conducted an uncontrolled before and after\nstudy through a review of the hospital's electronic\nmedical record of patients 24 months of age and\nyounger who were admitted to the emergency\ndepartment or who were hospitalized with a dis-\ncharge diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis (ICD-10\npre-guideline (March to August 2014) and post-\nguideline (March to August 2015) periods. We\nchose these two time periods because they roughly\ncoincided with the main bronchiolitis season in\nwere identified by daily review of the electronic\nmedical record of the emergency department and\nthe general ward and were confirmed by consulta-\ntion with the physician caring for the patient. Due\nto the fact that patients with subsequent bronchi-\nolitis readmissions are usually managed differently\nfrom those who present with their first episode,\nwe analyzed only the data regarding the first\nadmission. However, hospital readmission was\nanalyzed as an outcome measure. Patients with\nincomplete data were excluded from the analysis.\nAfter reviewing the electronic medical record, we\ncollected the following demographic, clinical, and\ndisease-related information: date of emergency\ndepartment attendance or admission, age, gen-\nder, presence of underlying disease conditions\n(prematurity, pre-existing respiratory conditions,\nbronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart\ndisease, and pulmonary hypertension), use of\ndiagnostic tests (hemogram, C-reactive protein,\nprocalcitonin, and chest radiography), use of\nmedications (beta 2 agonists, anticholinergics,\nepinephrine, inhaled and systemic corticoster-\noids, or antibiotics), type of virus identified, if a\nbronchiolitis severity classification was used, and\nif so, which scale for assessing the severity was\nused and what the severity level the disease was.\nIn the same manner, we collected information\nrelated to outcomes of care or bronchiolitis sever-\nity parameters such as length of stay, hospital\nadmissions, intensive care admissions, assisted\nventilation requirement, ambulatory oxygen\nrequirement, and hospital readmissions.\nOutcomes\nAs the primary outcome of interest, we defined a\npriori a composite outcome score, which we\ntermed `appropriate diagnosis and treatment of\nbronchiolitis'. This composite outcome score\naggregated the use of diagnostic tests (hemogram,\nC-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and chest radi-\nography), the use of medications (nebulized beta\n2 agonists, inhaled beta 2 agonists, nebulized\nanticholinergics, inhaled anticholinergics, nebu-\nlized epinephrine, inhaled corticosteroids, sys-\ntemic corticosteroids, antibiotics, and nebulized\nhypertonic saline), and the use of a scale for\nassessing the severity of bronchiolitis. Each of\nthese 14 items had a binary score: 0 indicating\nthat the diagnostic test or the medication was not\nused and 1 indicating that they were used (except\nfor the use of a scale for assessing the severity of\nbronchiolitis, which also had a binary score, but\nwith 0 indicating that a scale was used and 1 indi-\ncating that it was not used). The total score was\ncalculated by adding up the scores for the 14\nitems, resulting in a total score ranging from 0\u00ad14\n(best to worst). A composite outcome score >3\nwas designated as `inappropriate diagnosis and\ntreatment of bronchiolitis', whereas scores 3\nwere deemed as `appropriate diagnosis and treat-\nment of bronchiolitis', provided they did not\ninclude the use of anticholinergics (nebulized or\ninhaled) or corticosteroids (inhaled or systemic).\nAdditionally, the use of nebulized hypertonic\nsaline was deemed as appropriate for inpatients\nbut not for outpatients.\nSecondary outcomes included bronchiolitis sever-\nity parameters such as length of stay, hospital\nadmissions, intensive care admissions, assisted\nventilation requirement, ambulatory oxygen\nrequirement, and hospital readmissions. The\nstudy protocol was approved by the local ethics\nboard.\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous variables are presented as mean\nstandard deviation (SD) or median interquartile\nrange(IQR),whicheverisappropriate.Categorical\nvariables are presented as numbers (percentage).\nThe differences in the proportion of use of diag-\nnostic tests and medications and categorical\nbronchiolitis severity variables between pre-\nguideline and post-guideline assessment periods\nwere evaluated using the McNemar test.

We used\ngeneral linear models (GLMs) to examine the\nassociation between the implementation of the\nguideline and the `appropriate diagnosis and\ntreatment of bronchiolitis', adjusting for baseline\nvalues and potential confounders. Likewise, we\nused GLMs to examine the association between\nthe implementation of the guideline and bronchi-\nolitis severity parameters, adjusting for baseline\nvalues and potential confounders. Results of the\nmultivariate analyses are presented as an odds\nratio (OR) with their respective 95% confidence\ninterval (CI).

Implementation\nof the CPG was not statistically associated with\nlength of stay, hospital admissions, intensive care\nadmissions, assisted ventilation requirement,\nambulatory oxygen requirement, or hospital read-\nmissions (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nThe present study suggests that the development\nand implementation of a good quality CPG for\nbronchiolitis is associated with a significant\nincrease in the proportion of cases with an appro-\npriate diagnosis and treatment of the disease.\nThis appropriate diagnosis and treatment of\nbronchiolitis was mainly due to a decrease in use\nof diagnostic tests such as a hemogram and proc-\nalcitonin and changes in the use of medications\nsuch as nebulized beta 2 agonists, nebulized\nanticholinergics, nebulized epinephrine, and neb-\nulized hypertonic saline. However, implementa-\ntion of the CPG for bronchiolitis was not\nassociated with significant changes in outcomes\nof care or bronchiolitis severity parameters such\nas length of stay, hospital admissions, intensive\ncare admissions, assisted ventilation requirement,\nambulatory oxygen requirement, or hospital\nreadmissions.\nThe findings of the present study point to the\nusefulness of the implementation of a good qual-\nity bronchiolitis CPG in impacting physician's\nbehavior with respect to the use of unnecessary\ndiagnostic tests and the use of medications with\ninsufficient evidence of effectiveness. This opti-\nmization of the use of diagnostic tests and treat-\nments could help to reduce the variability in the\nclinical practice and the direct costs of bronchi-\nolitis, leading to a more efficient diagnostic and\ntherapeutic approach to the disease. Additionally,\nthe findings of the present study provide further\nevidence of the effectiveness of a strategy for\nimplementing a bronchiolitis CPG, which is one\nof the main flaws of the majority of the available\nbronchiolitis CPGs [Rodr\u00edguez-Mart\u00ednez et al.\n2016]. Although we could not demonstrate a\nsignificant change in clinically important out-\ncomes such as length of stay, hospital admis-\nsions, intensive care admissions, assisted\nventilation requirement, ambulatory oxygen\nrequirement, or hospital readmissions, the sig-\nnificant increase in the proportion of cases with\nan appropriate diagnosis and treatment of the\ndisease is probably associated with lower use of\nresources and with a lower proportion of the\nadverse effects of unnecessary medications or\nTable 3.

However, our study was not designed\nto measure the above factors.\nThe findings of the present study are in line with\nprevious research intended to assess the impact of\nimplementing bronchiolitis CPGs on resource\nuse. Kotagal and colleagues reported a significant\ndecrease in the proportion of patients who\nreceived albuterol after the implementation of an\nevidence-based CPG [Kotagal et al. 2002]. Mittal\nand colleagues demonstrated a significant reduc-\ntion in the use of tests and treatments (hemo-\ngram, chest radiography, bronchodilators,\ncorticosteroids, and antibiotics) after the imple-\nmentation of a CPG that included the presence of\nan easily accessible online CPG document [Mittal\net al. 2014]. Likewise, after the implementation of\nan evidence-based CPG, Perlstein and colleagues\nreported a 30% decrease in the use of at least\none beta-agonist therapy, as well as a significant\ndecrease in nasopharyngeal washings for RSV,\nchest radiographs, respiratory therapies, and\nmean costs for respiratory care services [Perlstein\net al. 1999]. However, in contrast to our findings,\nprevious reports in the literature have shown sig-\nnificant improvements in outcomes of care or\nbronchiolitis severity parameters such as length of\nstay (LOS) and hospital admissions after the\nimplementation of the CPG. Kotagal and col-\nleagues reported a significant decrease in length\nof stay after the implementation of an evidence-\nbased CPG [Kotagal et al. 2002]. Likewise,\nPerlstein and colleagues reported a 30% decrease\nin the rate of hospital admissions and a decrease\nof 17% in the mean LOS after the implementa-\ntion of an evidence-based CPG [Perlstein et al.\n2000]. These discordant results can be explained,\nat least in part, by a residual confounding bias\n(where the OR of the intervention is specifically\nbiased downward) due to the fact that a known\npotential confounder, severity of bronchiolitis,\ncould not be included in the multivariate models\nbecause a disease severity classification was used\nonly in 2.4% of cases. This is a viable hypothe-\nsis, because local epidemiological surveillance\nreports in the city (Secretary of Health of Bogota)\nshowed an increase in the severity of acute lower\nrespiratory infections in the first semester of\n[Secretary of Health of Bogota, 2015]. An alter-\nnative explanation is that, as opposed to the use\nof diagnostic tests, if there has been a failure to\ndemonstrate that the use of medications such\nas bronchodilators and nebulized epinephrine\n(which accounts for the highest proportion of\nchanges between pre-guideline and post-guide-\nline periods) has a significant impact on clinically\nimportant outcomes, this does not necessarily\nmean that the choice not to use them does have a\nsignificant impact on these outcomes. It is simply\nthat the disease follows its natural course, and\nthere are no significant differences between\nadministering and not administering these medi-\ncations. Another finding that deserves attention is\nthat in the post-guideline period, the use of nebu-\nlized bronchodilators decreased whereas the use\nof inhaled bronchodilators remained unchanged.\nThe reason for this is not clear but it could be\nattributed to the fact that the CPG implemented\nin the study promotes the use of the inhaled\ninstead of the nebulized form in order to perform\nthe monitored trial with bronchodilators.\nWe are aware that our research may have two\nlimitations. The first is that we used an uncon-\ntrolled before and after study to determine the\nimpact of the implementation of an evidence-\nbased bronchiolitis CPG on physician behavior\nand the care of infants with bronchiolitis.\nAlthough it is not possible to definitely attribute\nany observed changes to the intervention with the\nforegoing design of the study, it is very probable\nthat the observed changes in physician behavior\nand the care of infants with bronchiolitis were\nattributable to the intervention, because no other\nfactors or interventions occurred during the study\nperiods to which those significant changes could\nbe ascribed. The second is that we used a nonvali-\ndated definition for an appropriate diagnosis and\ntreatment of bronchiolitis. Although other studies\nhave used different definitions of an appropriate\ndiagnosis and treatment of the disease [Ochoa\nSangrador et al. 2013; Acu\u00f1a-Cordero et al.\n2014], these definitions have not been validated\nand have not included variables that we consid-\nered important, such as the use of a scale for\nassessing the severity of the disease. Finally, our\nresults need to be interpreted with caution,\nbecause residual confounding cannot be excluded.\nThe main strength of the study is that it offers\ncrucial evidence for the impact of a relatively sim-\nple intervention in a LMIC, aimed at improving\nthe diagnosis and the management of a disease\nthat is an important cause of morbidity and mor-\ntality in these countries.\nIn conclusion, the findings of the present study\nshow that the development and implementation\nof a good quality bronchiolitis CPG is associated\nwith a significant increase in the proportion of\nR Henao-Villada, MP Sossa-Brice\u00f1o et al.\ncases with an appropriate diagnosis and treatment\nof the disease in the context of a university-based\nhospital located in the capital of an LMIC.\nHowever, although the improvement in the pro-\nportion of cases with an appropriate diagnosis\nand treatment of the disease was due to changes\nin the proportion of the use of diagnostic tests and\nmedications as recommended in a good quality\nCPG, we could not demonstrate an improvement\nin clinically important outcomes. Further studies,\nwith a sample of patients/physicians more repre-\nsentative of the whole country, and taking into\naccount the severity of bronchiolitis as a potential\nconfounder, will need to be undertaken in the\nfuture. Additionally, future research on a vali-\ndated definition of an appropriate diagnosis and\ntreatment of bronchiolitis should be undertaken.\n"
