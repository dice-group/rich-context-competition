    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjectives: Limited research exists describing youth football injuries, and many of these are confined to\nspecific regions or communities. The authors describe U.S. pediatric football injury patterns receiving\nemergency department (ED) evaluation and compare injury patterns between the younger and older\nyouth football participants.\nMethods: A retrospective analysis of ED data on football injuries was performed using the National\nElectronic Injury Surveillance System\u00adAll Injury Program. Injury risk estimates were calculated over a\n5-year period (2001\u00ad2005) using participation data from the National Sporting Goods Associa-\ntion. Injury types are described for young (7\u00ad11 years) and adolescent (12\u00ad17 years) male football\nparticipants.\nResults: There were an estimated total of 1,060,823 visits to U.S. EDs for males with football-related\ninjuries. The most common diagnoses in the younger group (7\u00ad11 years) were fracture / dislocation\nincluded sprain / strain (31%), fracture / dislocation (29%), and contusion (23%). Older participants had a\nsignificantly higher injury risk of injury over the 5-year study period: 11.0 (95% confidence interval\nhigher injury risk across all categories, with the greatest disparity being with traumatic brain injury\nConclusions: National youth football injury patterns are similar to those previously reported in commu-\nnity and cohort studies. Older participants have a significantly higher injury risk, especially with TBI.\nMedicine\n",

These deficits\nare compounded by problems with generalizability due\nto large variations in injury reporting between studies.\nThis is due in part to the challenge of defining what\nconstitutes an injury in this group.9 The classification\nFrom the Injury Prevention Center at Rhode Island Hospital\n(MJM, RM, LP, JL), Providence, RI; and the Department of\nEmergency Medicine (MJM, LP, JL), the Department of Com-\nmunity Health (MJM, JC), and the Department of Pediatrics\n(LP, JL), Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Provi-\ndence, RI.\nAddress for correspondence and reprints: Michael J.

Additionally, the amount of expo-\nsure has been calculated in varying manners including\nany participation, by number of games, by number of\ngame minutes, or by number of plays. Given the\nincreasing levels of participation in football and the\nlack of nationwide data on youth football injuries, we\nexamined national injury patterns in youth and adoles-\ncent football participants who underwent emergency\ndepartment (ED) evaluation and compared injury\npatterns of very young participants with those of\nadolescents.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design\nThis was an ecologic study design using data from both\nthe National Electronic Injury Surveillance System\u00adAll\nInjury Program (NEISS-AIP) and National Sporting\nGoods Association (NSGA) for patients treated in U.S.\nThe Rhode Island Hospital Committee on the Protection\nof Human Subjects determined the study protocol to be\nexempt from institutional review board review.\nStudy Setting and Population\nData were obtained from the NEISS-AIP, which is a\ncollaborative effort between the U.S. Consumer Product\nSafety Commission and the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention (CDC) National Center for Injury Pre-\nvention and Control. Data on injury-related visits are\nobtained by NEISS-AIP from a national sample of 66\nout of 100 NEISS hospitals. This sample is selected by\nNEISS-AIP as a stratified probability sample of hospi-\ntals in the United States and its territories with a mini-\nincludes separate strata for very large, large, medium,\nand small hospitals and children's hospitals based on\nthe number of ED visits. NEISS-AIP collects data on ini-\ntial visits for all categories of injuries treated in U.S.\nED visits annually. It is intended to provide national\nincidence estimates of all categories and external\ncauses of nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in\nU.S. hospital EDs and cannot be used to provide regio-\nnal, state, or local estimates.\nNational Sporting Goods Association's Sports Partici-\npation Program is an annual mailed survey assessing\nthe number of individuals 7 years of age or older who\nparticipated in different sports within the previous year.\nbalanced on a number of characteristics, including\nhousehold size, composition, income, age of household\nhead, and location. From this panel, 20,000 households\nare selected each year and mailed a self-administered\nquestionnaire. In an effort to return a sample that is\nrepresentative of the U.S. population, households\nselected are balanced with oversampling of lower\n``return rate'' segments. Survey response rates average\nMeasurements\nThe NEISS-AIP collects information on the date of\ntreatment, patient age, diagnosis, body part injured,\npatient disposition, locale in which the injury occurred,\nand type of sport or product associated with the injury.\nIncident locale is coded by NEISS-AIP as home, farm / -\nranch, street or highway, other public property\n(includes store, office building, restaurant, church,\nhotel, motel, hospital or other medical facility, night-\nclub, theater, or other public property), mobile home,\nindustrial place, school, place of recreation or sports,\nor not recorded. Football-related injuries were identi-\nfied using the NEISS-AIP hierarchical category for\nsports injuries and were limited to football (nonsoccer)-\nrelated injuries. For the present study, only injuries that\noccurred at school or at a place of recreation or sports\nwere included. Two age groupings were used for analy-\napproximate elementary school age and middle / high\nschool age. Because injury frequencies in female foot-\nball participants were low, analyses involving NEISS\nestimates were considered unreliable, and we therefore\nperformed our analyses using only males. Injury diag-\nnoses as provided by NEISS-AIP were used, with the\nfollowing exceptions: fractures and dislocations were\ncombined into a single category (``fracture / disloca-\ntion''); ``laceration'' was recoded to include the NEISS\ncategories of lacerations, punctures, and avulsions, and\n``contusions / abrasions'' was recoded to include the\nNEISS categories contusions / abrasions and hematoma.\nWe generated a diagnosis category ``traumatic brain\ninjury'' (TBI) and recoded into that category NEISS-AIP\ndiagnosis codes for concussion, for internal injury in\nwhich ``head'' was the body part affected and for frac-\nture in which ``head'' was the body part affected.24\nDiagnoses other than the leading five diagnoses were\nrecoded into the ``other'' category.\nInjury rates were calculated using participation data\nfrom the Sports Business Research Network1 and are\nderived from annual reports provided by the NSGA.\nThe NSGA conducts annual mail-based surveys of\n20,000 preselected U.S. households, collecting self-\nreported sports participation data for U.S. residents.\nEligible participants include household members\n7 years of age who report participation in tackle foot-\nball at least once during the 12-month period. Data col-\nlected include age, sex, and sports participated in\nduring the previous 12 months. Participation numbers\nare grouped into age ranges and include the same age\nable for the entire study period. The number of foot-\nball-related injuries per 1,000 participants during the\nstudy period was calculated using these participation\nData Analysis\nData were analyzed with SAS (Version 9.1.3, SAS Insti-\ntute, Inc., Cary, NC) using the survey procedures to\naccount for the complex sampling design and the\nweighting structure utilized by NEISS-AIP. Each case is\nassigned a sample weight by NEISS-AIP based on the\ninverse probability of selection. These weights were\nused to calculate national estimates of nonfatal injuries.\nConsistent with the NEISS-AIP recommendations,23 we\ndesignated estimates as unreliable when computations\nare based on fewer than 20 NEISS cases (based on un-\nweighted data), individual national estimates are less\nthan 1,200 (based on weighted data), or the coefficient\nof variation (CV) of the estimate is greater than 30%.\nInjury risk for the 5-year study period was calculated\nusing the weighted estimates from NEISS-AIP data and\nthe total participation data in each age group during\nthe study period and then averaged across all years.\nConfidence intervals (CIs) and CVs were calculated by\nusing a direct variance estimation procedure that\naccounted for the sample weights.\nRESULTS\nvisits for children aged 7 through 17 years for football-\nrelated injuries occurring at school or sport /\nrecreation (Table 1).

Annual injury risk for male football participants presenting to emergency departments (EDs), by age group, United States,\n37.4%), but injury site distribution was fairly similar in\nboth groups (Table 3).\nDISCUSSION\nPrevious research describing football injuries has been\nlargely confined to examining cohorts over one or two\nseasons, usually from a single community or region. To\nour knowledge, our study is the first to use a nationally\nrepresentative data set to describe injuries to young\nfootball participants that require ED evaluation and\nthen compare them to older adolescent football partici-\npants.\nPrevious research has identified that many injuries\nincurred by football participants are minor.3,16 Our\nfinding that fractures are the most common injury diag-\nnosis in the younger age group and second most com-\nmon in the older age group most likely reflects the\nincreased level of acuity with this database of injuries\nreceiving ED evaluation. It should be noted, however,\nthat using ED-treated injuries does create some\ndifficulty in comparing our findings with previous\nresearch on youth football injuries.\nOver the 5-year study period, we found that older\nyouths (ages 12\u00ad17 years) appear to have an increasing\nannual injury risk, while the younger participants had a\nrelatively constant injury risk. We do not have an expla-\nnation for this, but can speculate that over this 5-year\nperiod, adolescent football participants may have been\nat increasing risk of injury due to less conditioning,\nincreased weight resulting in more force, increased\nlength of playing seasons, or playing more aggressively\nor because of adolescent football rule modifications.\nThis worrisome trend in the older age group encom-\npasses high school football programs, programs that\nalready have been reported to have the highest injury\nrate for high school athletics.25 Additional research will\nbe needed to determine if this trend continues and\nwhether more focused analysis for its causative factors\nis warranted.\nIn comparing injury diagnoses in the older group\nwith the younger group, we found that TBI, sprain /\nFootball Injury Characteristics of Male Participants Presenting to EDs by Age Group, United States, 2001\u00ad2005\nCharacteristic\nMales\nInjury\nRisk\nRatio\u00e0\nn* Injury Risk (95% CI) n* Injury Risk (95% CI)\nInjuries by diagnosis\nInjuries by mechanism\nED = emergency department; TBI = traumatic brain injury.\n*Based on National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) weights.\nInjury risk expressed per 1,000 participants / year.\nProportions for Body Parts by Age Group of Football Injuries Presenting to U.S. EDs, 2001\u00ad2005\nInjuries by Body Part\nNational\nEstimate*\n% of\nNational\nEstimate*\n% of\nED = emergency department.\n*Based on National Electronic Injury Surveillance System\u00adAll Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) weights.\nNational estimates less than 1,200 cases are considered unreliable by NEISS.\nstrain, and fracture / dislocation were significantly more\ncommon in the older age group. This is troublesome\ngiven that TBI and fracture / dislocation are two of the\nmost serious injury diagnoses. Others have also\nreported that increasing age is associated with increas-\nthat injured high school football participants have a\ngreater proportion of fractures and concussions than\ncollegiate football athletes. Furthermore, this is consis-\ntent with Powell and Barber-Foss,26 who found that\nhigh school football accounts for the majority (63%) of\nmild TBI in all high school athletics.\nArm / hand was the location with the highest propor-\ntion of injuries in our study in both age groups. This is\nconsistent with previous studies of younger partici-\nhigh school football studies that reported the lower\nextremity to be the most common site.6,7,9\u00ad11 Again, this\nmay reflect the difference in our data set, which\nincludes only injuries resulting in an ED evaluation, so\ndoes not include injuries treated only on the field.\nOur findings support the need for continued efforts in\ninjury prevention and control directed at youth football.\nRadelet et al.27 asserted that ``youth football should be a\npriority for injury studies,'' and we concur. Further-\nmore, these findings suggest the need to direct further\nprevention efforts within the sport. Others have made\nrecommendations regarding mechanisms for reducing\nsports injuries including preparticipation physicals,\nsporting event medical coverage, adequate training of\ncoaches, adequate hydration, enforcement of game\nrules, and proper equipment.2,28 Although these\napproaches have already been used with some success\nin football,25,28 these interventions need to be continu-\nally modified and then tested specifically within this age\ngroup to further reduce injury risk in young athletes.\nLIMITATIONS\nOur estimates of injury involve some potential biases\nassociated with the use of NEISS-AIP for injury fre-\nquency and NSGA's participation data. By examining\nNEISS-AIP ED data, we underestimate minor football\ninjuries that are not treated in an ED setting. Although\nthese minor injuries have less serious medical conse-\nquences, they still may restrict participation, as well as\ncause pain. Similarly, other significant injuries might be\nevaluated primarily by a specialist or in an office-based\npractice or by an on-field physician and not be evalu-\nated in the ED.\nThe NEISS-AIP allows for only the most severe injury\nto be coded in the case of multiple injuries and thus\nmay underreport less serious injuries. Conversely,\nextreme injuries resulting in fatalities are not fully cap-\ntured in NEISS-AIP (patients who were dead on arrival\nor died in the ED are excluded) and were excluded\nfrom our analysis. Thus, we cannot make any inference\nfrom our data on the incidence of fatal injury occur-\nrence in the study population. All of these factors\nwould lead to an underestimation of the frequency of\ninjuries and injury rate.\nBy restricting location codes to school and place of\nrecreation or sport, we attempted to minimize the\npotential for including injuries not occurring in orga-\nnized football settings. While it is likely that we never-\ntheless included some nonorganized football injuries,\nand this would lead to overestimation of the problem, it\nis also possible that we missed organized football inju-\nries that were not coded as football related. This possi-\nbility could offset any overestimation, although we\ncannot be sure where the balance lies.\nThe participation data are a self-reported mail sur-\nvey of a nationally representative sample. A participant\nwas included if reporting participation at least one\ntime over the past 12 months. Thus, the numbers may\noverestimate the number of participants, causing a\nbias of underreporting rates. In addition, using the\nNSGA's data for participation for participants 7\u00ad\n17 years in calculating injury rates has the limitation of\nnot accounting for sampling error. Our denominator\nwas not considered a random variable; it was assumed\nthat the denominator was our population parameter\nor, simply, our sample size. We recognize that this is\nan assumption of utilizing an ecologic study design,\nbut currently there is no better way to estimate the\nnumber of adolescents playing football in the United\nStates. All of our analyses were done using visits to\nan ED by young and adolescent male football partici-\npants and are not necessarily extrapolated to female\nparticipants in these age groups.\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur analysis of nationally representative data of foot-\nball injuries treated in EDs is similar to previously\nreported findings in communities and cohorts, with\nolder participants having a significantly higher injury\nrisk. We found this relationship of increased injury risk\nwith increasing age to be especially true for the poten-\ntially more serious injury diagnoses of TBI and frac-\ntures. These results and future research in this area\nshould be used to guide subsequent injury reduction\nmeasures in this age group.\nReferences\n1. Sports Business Research Network.
