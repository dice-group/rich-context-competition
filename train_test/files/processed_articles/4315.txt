We also explored associations between\ncurrent melanoma incidences and historical data on the following socio-demographic indicators: income, urbanization, and\npopulation aging. Melanoma incidences were higher in high-income countries where sales of sunscreen were also higher. Our\nresults show that, at the population level, income was significantly associated with melanoma incidences,  = 0.0003, t(19) =\n3.104, p < .006, and that increased sunscreen sales has not prevented higher income populations from being at higher risk\nof melanoma.\n",

Recent 10-year follow-up evidence from a ran-\ndomized controlled trial suggests that melanoma may be pre-\nvented by using sunscreen, provided it is used optimally (i.e.,\napplied every morning and reapplied after heavy sweating,\nbathing, or long sun exposure; Green, Williams, Logan, &\ning strong evidence for the effectiveness of sunscreen under\ntrial conditions (Robinson & Bigby, 2011), historical evi-\ndence from the late 1990s has shown that, in practice, many\npeople do not apply sunscreen optimally (Robinson &\nEpidemiological evidence from case\u00adcontrol studies is\ninconclusive, with some studies suggesting that sunscreen\ncan reduce the risk of melanoma and non-melanoma skin\ncancers, and others suggesting that using sunscreen might\nactually increase the risk of melanoma by encouraging\ngreater sunbathing time and thus ultraviolet (UV) exposure\nanalysis by Dennis, Beane Freeman, and VanBeek (2003)\nidentified seven case\u00adcontrol studies that reported a\ndecreased risk of melanoma and nine studies that reported an\nincreased risk of melanoma, although combined odds ratios\nof these studies failed to show either a significantly protec-\ntive or harmful association between sunscreen use and mela-\nnoma. One of the main limitations of such case\u00adcontrol\nstudies is that they are based on sunscreen use question-\nnaires, which use broad and sometimes subjective categories\nto measure the frequency of sunscreen use (e.g.,\n\"often\"/\"rarely\"/\"always,\" Wolf et al., 1998) and are subject\nto recall bias. Although sales do not directly equate to use (as\nnot all product bought is necessarily used), market data can\nbe considered a useful means of estimating use (in volume)\nbecause sales data are not subject to recall bias. To date, there\nhave been no cross-national, population-based ecological\nstudies exploring the association between melanoma preva-\nlence and sunscreen sales data.\nUV exposure is the only established exogenous causal\nfactor for melanoma (Westerdahl, Ingvar, Masback, &\nOlsson, 2000), and UV radiation has been shown to\nhave a strong negative association with latitude (Elwood\net al., 1974). Epidemiologists have also explored whether\n1Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA\n2Roosevelt University, Chicago, IL, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nSimon N.

Williams1 and Kimberly A. Dienes2\n Keywords\npublic health, health communication, melanoma, disposable income, sunscreen\n2 SAGE Open\nsocio-demographic variables, like income, aging, and urban-\nization, are also risk factors for melanoma.Anumber of stud-\nies at the local or national level suggest that risk of melanoma\nis higher among higher income populations within a country\nAa, de Vries, Hoekstra, Coebergh, & Siesling, 2011). Perez-\nGomez et al. (2008) found that the relative risk of melanoma\ngenerally increased with urbanization (i.e., those living in\nlarger towns were at higher risk of melanoma). In addition,\nincreasing age is a risk factor for melanoma, whereby inci-\ndence starts to increase throughout adulthood and the highest\nage-specific incidence is in the older age groups (Marks,\n2001). There are to our knowledge no substantial cross-\nnational studies exploring the relationships between mela-\nnoma prevalence and income, urbanization, and aging at the\npopulation level.\nIn this ecological study, we drew upon recently published\nmelanoma prevalence data, and compared these data with\nhistorical market data and published socio-economic data to\ntest for an association between historical sunscreen sales and\nrecent melanoma incidence in 24 countries in Northern\nEurope. We also explored associations between current mel-\nanoma incidence and historical data on the following socio-\ndemographic indicators: income, urbanization, and\npopulation aging.\nOur hypothesis is based on best-available evidence, as\nprovided by Green et al.'s (2011) findings, that if applied\nconsistently and optimally, sunscreen can effectively reduce\nthe risk of melanoma among those at risk (Robinson &\nBigby, 2011). Thus, we hypothesized that, after adjusting for\nincome, urbanization, and aging and after controlling for\nlatitude, higher historical sunscreen sales would be associ-\nated with lower recent melanoma incidence. Causality of\ncourse cannot be inferred from an ecological study, only a\nsignificant association. However, the presence of such an\nassociation could serve as a basis for further research into\nwhether and why sunscreen has not been applied consistently\nand optimally across populations in line with recommended\nguidelines.\nMethod\nGLOBOCAN--a publically available database produced by\nthe International Agency for Research on Cancer's (IARC,\n2014). A full description of the methodology can be found on\nthe methods of estimation are country-specific and depend on\nthe quality and amount of the information available for each\ncountry. However, of the 24 countries in this sample, 21 were\nclassified as \"high quality regional or national data\" (17 of\nwhich had coverage greater than 50% of a country's popula-\ntion; IARC, 2014). The IARC database provides the general\nincidence of melanoma, and did not provide information on\nmelanoma incidence according to bodily sites nor according\nto type (i.e., invasive vs. in situ). Separate incidences for mel-\nanoma in men and women were available, as well as com-\nbined-sex melanoma incidences. Mean incidences were\nIndustry data on sunscreen sales (in volume per capita)\nwere obtained from the Euromonitor Passport Global Market\nInformation Database, 2012 Edition (Euromonitor\nThis study uses mean sunscreen sales per capita between\n1999 were sufficient to explore its relationship with mela-\nassumes a minimum 10-year latency period (Liu & Soong,\nsunscreen sales approximately 10 years prior to recent mela-\nnoma rates can allow us to begin to explore whether there is\nan ecological association between the two.\nTo explore and adjust for the effect of potential confound-\ning factors, we included three socio-demographic variables\nin our analyses. Data on income (gross domestic product\n[GDP] per capita, expressed in constant 2011 international\ndollars purchasing power parity for comparability), urban-\nization (the percentage of the population living in urban\nareas), and population aging (the percentage of the popula-\ntion older than 65 years) were taken from the World Bank\nWorld Development Indicators Database (2014 edition;\nWorld Bank, 2014). For sunscreen sales, income, urbaniza-\ntion, and population aging, all data were historical, expressed\nThe model controlled for latitude as a proxy for domes-\ntic/everyday UV exposure. Variations in the intensity of UV\nexposure are known to be related to melanoma incidences\n(Crombie, 1979), and a country's UV Index is closely cor-\nrelated with its latitude. Only countries with latitudes of\n45\u00b0N and above were used.2 This is consistent with previ-\nous studies that have classified latitudes above 45\u00b0N as\n\"high latitudes\" (Chang et al., 2009). This allowed us to\nbroadly control for a country's general UV exposure.3 Also,\nin all countries, the vast majority of the population was\nCaucasian.4\nResearch has shown how, indoor tanning (in which sun-\nscreen is generally not applied) can also significantly increase\nthe risk of melanoma (Boniol, Autier, Boyle, & Gandini,\n2012), thereby making it a target for regulation across Europe\n(Williams, 2012). Differences in sunbed use between coun-\ntries may also have contributed to the observed differences in\nthe incidence of melanoma between countries. We were\nunfortunately unable to find any comparable and consistent\ndata on indoor tanning (sunbed) use for all 24 countries in\nthis sample, despite extensive searching. A meta-analysis by\nBoniol et al. (2012) provided an estimated fraction of mela-\nnoma cases attributed to sunbed use in Europe for 12 coun-\ntries included in this study.\nWilliams and Dienes 3\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analyses were conducted in SPSS/PASW Statistics\nVersion 18 (SPSS, Inc., 2014). The t tests were used to explore\ndifferences between male and female melanoma incidences\nand also between melanoma incidences in Western Europe\nand Central and Eastern Europe. Linear regressions were\nused to explore bivariate relationships between melanoma\nincidences and the independent variables--historical sun-\nscreen sales, income, urbanization, population aging, and lati-\ntude. Only those variables that were significantly associated,\nor nearly significantly associated (95% confidence interval\n[CI]), with melanoma incidences were selected for the final\nmultivariate regression model.\nResults\nBivariate Analyses\nA paired-samples t test revealed that melanoma incidences\nsamples t tests showed that there was no statistically\nsignificant difference in melanoma rates between males\nand females (p > .05). We chose to use only combined-sex\nmelanoma incidence data in our subsequent analyses.\nIndependent-samples t tests did, however, reveal that mela-\nnoma incidences in countries in Western Europe were sig-\nnificantly higher than in countries in Central and Eastern\nBivariate regression analysis showed that there was a sta-\ntistically significant relationship between mean sunscreen\nto our hypothesis, higher sunscreen sales were associated\nwith higher melanoma incidences. Melanoma incidences\nwere also significantly associated with income,  = 0.0003,\nMelanoma incidences were generally higher in countries\nwith higher income, greater urbanization and a larger propor-\ntion of the population aged 65 and older. Thus, these vari-\nables were included in the final regression model.\nAs noted above, by selecting only those European coun-\ntries with average latitude above 45\u00b0N, the potential effect of\nTable 1.

Latitudes are average national latitudes taken from the CIA Factbook (https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-\nfactbook/).\n4 SAGE Open\ndomestic/everyday UV exposure had already been accounted\nfor (not including lower latitude/high-UV countries).\nHowever, an additional analysis was performed to see\nwhether variances in average latitude above 45\u00b0N were asso-\nciated with melanoma incidences.Alinear regression showed\nthat there was no significant association between the latitude\nand melanoma incidences in the countries selected in this\nstudy (p > .05). Thus, latitude was not included as a variable\nin the final regression model.\nLinear regression analysis also showed that there was no\nsignificant relationship between the estimated fraction of\nmelanoma cases attributed to sunbed use and melanoma inci-\ndences (p > .05), although it is important to note the small\nsample size (n = 12). The absence of complete data and of\nsignificance in the subset meant that sunbed use was not\nincluded in the multivariate regression model.\nMultivariate Regression Analysis\nAlthough our final multivariate regression model (Table 2)\nscreen sales, urbanization and population aging no longer\nsignificantly predicted melanoma incidence. Income\nremained significantly positively associated with melanoma\nnized hierarchically, income significantly increased the mod-\nel's predictive capacity, accounting for 14.9% of the total\nmodel's predictive capacity of 65.5%. Adjusted R2 were used\nto account for the relatively small sample size.\nDiscussion\nRegional- and national-level studies have shown that the risk\nof melanoma is higher among higher income populations\n2011). This is to our knowledge the first multi-national com-\nparative study to explore show the relationship between\nmean disposable income and melanoma rates. After adjust-\ning for sunscreen sales, urbanization and population aging,\nincome was strongly associated with melanoma incidence,\nwith high-income countries having higher melanoma inci-\ndences. In higher income countries, people have more money\nto spend on activities that might entail intermittent high UV\nexposure, such as vacationing in lower latitude countries, a\nknown risk factor (Elwood, 1992). Like most commodities,\nsunscreen is generally more affordable in countries with\nhigher disposable income per capita, which helps to explain\nwhy sales were higher in higher income countries.\nAlthough the association between sunscreen sales and\nmelanoma incidences lost significance in our final model, we\nnonetheless observed that melanoma incidences were gener-\nally higher in countries with higher historical sunscreen\nsales. This is an important observation that adds to existing\nknowledge on the relationship between sunscreen use and\nmelanoma risk. Best-available evidence suggests that sun-\nscreen, when applied optimally, can be effective at the indi-\nvidual level (Green et al., 2011). However, our findings\nsuggest that in practice, sunscreen as a public health measure\nhas not historically succeeded in protecting against increased\nrisk of melanoma at the ecological or population level.\nSunscreen sales are a proxy for the amount of time spent in\nhigh-UV areas. However, our findings may also relate to pre-\nvious research which has found that the availability of sun-\nscreen may actually have increased population-wide UV\nexposure, because of the false sense of protection it confers\nwhen used improperly (Weinstock, 2001). There is a distinc-\ntion to be made between how successfully sunscreen has\nbeen marketed in high-income countries (as revealed by high\nper capita sales), and the relative lack of success that these\ncountries have had in the prevention of melanoma (as\nrevealed by high melanoma incidences). Our findings can be\nunderstood in relation to historical evidence, which suggests\nthat during the late 1990s, even though some sunscreens\nwere chemically effective when applied optimally (Green et\nal., 2011), in practice, they were not being applied correctly\nby sunbathers during periods of high UV exposure (Robinson\nour results show that increased sunscreen sales did not miti-\ngate against the increased risk that high-income populations\nexperience as a result of income-related activities like vaca-\ntions to lower latitude countries.\nLimitations\nTo reiterate, one of the well-known limitations of ecological\nstudies is that they can only show an association between\nvariables and cannot prove causation. Using population-\nlevel data offered the potential for ecological fallacies. Our\ndata were not able to speak to individual-level behaviors. Per\ncapita data divide the total volume of sunscreen purchased in\na country by the total population. For instance, per capita\ndata are unable to tell us whether a small proportion of the\npopulation are buying large volumes of sunscreen, or whether\na large proportion of the population are buying small vol-\numes of sunscreen. Also, data as to who is buying sunscreen\nand how it is being used are not included in this study. As\nsuch, it does not tell us the extent to which men are using\nTable 2.

As discussed above, we did not find a significant\nassociation between the estimated fraction of melanoma\ncases attributed to sunbed use and melanoma incidences for\n12 countries included in this study. However, these data per-\ntained to a limited number of countries (n = 12) and we were\nunfortunately unable to find any comparable and consistent\ncross-national data on indoor tanning (sunbed) use, despite\nextensive searching. Recent data from the \"Euromelanoma\"\n(van der Leest et al., 2011) project suggests that sunbed use\nvaries between countries, with approximately 25% of those\nscreened in Belgium reported having used sunbeds com-\npared with less than 10% of those screened in the Ukraine.\nAlthough insufficient for the purposes of this article, the\ngrowing Euromelanoma project may provide valuable and\ncomparable data on sunbed use across European countries,\nwhich could be used for future studies exploring these trends\nat the population level.\nIt is also worth noting that most of the existing literature\non melanoma and sunscreen use concerns studies conducted\nbefore 1990, when sunscreens with little UVA protection\nwere available. More recent sunscreens have started to\ninclude ingredients (e.g., avobenzone) that offer some UVA\nprotection. With UVA being linked to melanoma develop-\nment (Wang et al., 2001) and with newer sunscreens offering\nUVA protection, future ecological studies might show a dif-\nferent relationship between sunscreen use and melanoma\nrates.\nOne other consideration is the role of public awareness\ncampaigns. Again, comparable and quantifiable data on mel-\nanoma prevention campaigns were not available across all\nthe countries in our sample. As with sunbed use, the\n\"Euromelanoma\" campaign offers potential for future cross-\nnational studies to explore associations between recent large-\nscale prevention initiatives (e.g., disseminating information\nabout skin cancer and offering skin examinations to the gen-\neral public on \"Melanoma Day\"; van der Leest et al., 2011).\nConclusion\nMelanoma incidences were higher in high-income countries\nwhere sales of sunscreen were higher. In short, our results\nshow that, at the population level, income was significantly\nassociated with melanoma incidences, and that increased\nsunscreen sales has not prevented higher income populations\nfrom being at higher risk of melanoma. From a public health\nperspective, our results correspond with existing advice that\nsunscreen should be applied according to optimal recom-\nmendations (i.e., one teaspoon should be applied to per body\npart, prior to sun exposure and should be reapplied regularly\nand after activities such as swimming) and alternative meth-\nods of sun protection should be considered (e.g., wearing\nclothes and wide-brimmed hats; Robinson & Bigby, 2011).\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1.
