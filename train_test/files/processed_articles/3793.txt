More specifically, it uses the concept of\nneoteny to show that the retention of ancestors' juvenile characteristics is related to specific behaviors. The results of factor\nanalyses conducted on a UK sample (n \u00bc 499) and a French sample (n \u00bc 292) 7 years later indicate four dimensions of childlike\nconsumer behavior, namely, stimulus seeking, reality conflict, escapism, and control of aggression.\n",

In search of sensations, adults can take risks and put\nthe reality principle to one side. In the quest for enchantment,\nthey visit theme parks and act ``as if.'' Fun becomes an impera-\ntive (Wolfenstein, 1951): Consumers of all ages play games on\ntheir mobile phones while waiting for the bus or show extraor-\ndinary excitement about a future purchase. They cook or buy\ncolorful cupcakes or cake lollipops for their guests, perform air\nguitar at a Dodgers baseball game, and run not only to improve\ntheir health but to flee from zombies. Meanwhile, brands such\nas McDonald's (Australia), Volkswagen (France), Haribo\n(France), Ford (United States), Mercedes (Hagerstown, MD),\nBeef `O' Brady's (United States), San Francisco Giants, Audi\n(United States), Kia (United States), and Evian (worldwide) are\nusing their commercials to ask their consumers to let out their\ninner child.\nTo what extent is this infantilist ethos tied to evolutionary\nprocesses? As yet, marketing and communication researchers\nhave not displayed a deep interest in the evolutionary causes\nof consumer behavior, although there have been a few excep-\ntions (e.g., Griskevicius, Shiota, & Nowlis, 2010; Hantula,\nsible to provide a clearer understanding of a consumption\nphenomenon such as childlike behavior by accepting the\nassumption that individual variation in behavioral disposi-\ntions can be considered from an evolutionary perspective\nThis article explores the phenomenon of childlike con-\nsumer behavior from an evolutionary perspective. In this con-\ntext, childlike consumer behavior refers to the juvenile\ncharacteristics that adult consumers present. It is partly under-\nstood as a result of paedomorphosis, which is the retention of\nancestors' juvenile characteristics into adulthood. Since\nGould (1977), it has been accepted that neoteny, that is a\nretardation of somatic development, explains most of the pae-\ndomorphic aspects in humans.\nAfter sharing the relevant literature on neoteny and the\nmethodology used in this research (scale development\nthrough factor analyses), we present and discuss four\ndimensions of childlike consumer behavior based on evolu-\ntionary theories.\n1 CERGAM/AMGSM-IAE Aix, Aix-Marseille Universit\u00b4\ne, Aix-en-Provence\ncedex 2, France\nCorresponding Author:\nMathieu Alemany Oliver, Aix-Marseille Graduate School of Management--IAE\ncedex 2, France.\nEmail: mathieu.alemany@iae-aix.com\nEvolutionary Psychology\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nevp.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nNeoteny\nBiological Neoteny Induces Behavioral Neoteny\nNeoteny (literally ``to stretch youth''; Kollmann, 1885) is a\n``paedomorphosis produced by retardation of somatic develop-\noccurs more slowly than was the case in the subject's ancestors\nand causes the retention of juvenile traits in the descendants'\nadulthood. Paedomorphosis is part of a larger phenomenon\ncalled heterochrony. Heterochrony is defined as a change in\nthe rate or timing of development, which leads to a modifica-\ntion of size and/or shape but also behavior (McKinney, 1999).\nFor instance, Roth, Nishikawa, Naujoks-Manteuffel, Schmidt,\nand Wake (1993) show how paedomorphic processes in sala-\nmanders have modified the nervous system. The Dutch anato-\nmist Bolk (1926) made the first detailed study of the\nsimilarities between the anatomy of the Homo sapiens and that\nof young and unborn great apes. But Bolk's theory and the\nracist and sexist overtone of his writings made the concept of\nneoteny more difficult to accept within the research commu-\nnity. While trying to ``rescue Bolk's data,'' Gould (1977,\np. 356) underlines a number of paedomorphic--mostly neote-\nnous--features that were critical to human evolution. For\nexample, the neotenous human skull (i.e., with reference to\nchimpanzees, a retardation in shape and an increase in size and\nin the duration of growth) contributed to brain plasticity, lan-\nguage, and culture. Another example is found in the shape of\nthe pelvis, which permitted an upright stance and bipedalism.\nWhile the main debate around neoteny concerns its central\nrole in human evolution, it is commonly accepted that neoteny\nplayed a decisive role and that some other types of hetero-\n1989). Today, the evidence of human neoteny tends to be out-\nlined in neurological structures and processes as well as human\ngenetics. For example, the ancestral SRGAP2, a gene that is\nhighly expressed during brain development and controls corti-\ncal neuron migration, triggers neoteny by delaying dendritic\nspine maturation (Charrier et al., 2012). More generally, neo-\nteny plays a functional role in the maturation of the prefrontal\ncortex and in the acquisition of high cognitive abilities and\nFollowing McKinney's (1999) definition of heterochrony,\nan accepted corollary of the process of neoteny is that the\nobserved retardation of somatic development results in the\nretention of juvenile traits of behavior. In other words, biolo-\ngical neoteny induces behavioral neoteny (Bjorklund, 1997;\ncanine animals and longhorn sheep display different behavioral\nsystems corresponding to different juvenile ancestral behaviors\ncaused by biological neoteny (Coppinger et al., 1987; Geist,\nment, with respect to humans, is partly due to neoteny, and\nLorenz (1971) underlines the importance of these juvenile\ncharacteristics in the maintenance of brain plasticity. Finally,\nCairns (1976) points out that neoteny partly explains both the\ninstability of individual differences and the malleability of\nbehaviors during childhood and more largely in every social\nmammal's offspring.\nNeoteny and Marketing\nIn marketing research, the concept of neoteny is rarely used and\nmost often deals with anthropomorphic products. Anthropo-\nmorphism can be the attribution of a humanlike mind or of\nhumanlike physical features to nonhumans (Waytz, Cacioppo,\n& Epley, 2010). Anthropomorphic products can be found in\nvery different product categories and brands: products for the\nhome such as Koziol items or the Honda Asimo domestic\nrobot; cars such as the Volkswagen New Beetle (Aggarwal &\nMcGill, 2007); or perfumes, soap, and beverages using\nhourglass-shaped bottles (e.g., Jean Paul Gaultier, Ivory, or\nCoca-Cola, respectively). Anthropomorphism is also found in\nbrand communication with half of Ad Age's top 10 advertising\nicons of the 20th century being anthropomorphic characters\nmonplace feature for anthropomorphic brand characters and\nputs forward the tendency for some to ``get younger, more\ncherubic, more cuddly, more childlike, more and more cute\nwith the passing years.''\nThe promotion of neotenous products and brand characters\nmight be explained by the likeliness that consumers will\ndevelop affective responses and positive attitudes toward child-\nlike anthropomorphic characteristics (Hell\u00b4\nen & Sa\n\u00a8a\n\u00a8ksja\n\u00a8rvi,\nanthropomorphic car design improves the self-driving car\nexperience by increasing individuals' trust in the autonomous\ncar's performance (Waytz, Heafner, & Epley, 2014). Similarly,\nneotenous characteristics in cars such as round and big ``eyes''\nwith a high and smooth forehead can signal that there is no\nthreat (e.g., the Volkswagen New Beetle; Woodside, 2010),\njust like it tells consumers they can develop a playful relation-\nship with the product.\nWhen it comes to consumer research, no study actually\nevaluates the role of neoteny in consumer behavior. However,\nevolutionary studies can give consumer researchers a few poin-\nters. For instance, neoteny is a component of physical attrac-\ntiveness, especially in women (Cunningham, Roberts, Barbee,\n(1996) suggests that a preference for women with light skin\nand fair hair is due not only to political and cultural dominance\nbut also to a preference for neotenous women who already\nexisted in ancient Rome, along with women using cosmetics\nto lighten their skins. Her studies reveal that only in a few\nsocieties (including in non-Westernized populations) are neo-\ntenous traits not attractive. As for waist-to-hip ratio (Singh,\n1993), neotenous features such as light and smooth skin, large\neyes, a small nose, and full lips are indicators of good health\nand reproductive potential in mate selection; they also repre-\nsent desirable qualities highlighted by Western consumer\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nsociety, such as youth, vivaciousness, openness, and agreeable-\nsuch as Glamour and Cosmopolitan were found to showcase\nOne possible consequence of the preference for neotenous\nfeatures and the presence of neotenous subjects in media might\nbe consumers' willingness to transform into ultra-neotenous\nspecies by imitating the aesthetic standards (e.g., neotenous\nphysical traits) conveyed by the media and to adopt childlike\nbehavior by immersing themselves in discourses of eternal\nyouth. This is visible, for example, in the quest for rejuvenes-\ncence through the consumption of clothes, cosmetics, Botox,\ncollagen and plastic surgery, and also in the prevalence of\ncoolness and cuteness in popular culture (Belk, Tian, & Paa-\nAs illustrated by the Japanese neotenous character Prince\nPickles, the official mascot of the Japan Self-Defense Forces,\ncuteness is highly visible in Japan society at the moment. Cute\ncharacters also penetrated Western popular cultures and are\ndisplayed as bipedal mammalian with childlike characteristics:\nThey have a rounded, nonsexual, and infantile shape, and they\nare adorable, gentle, innocent, delicate, and inexperienced\nHomage to Mickey Mouse is another good example of the\nneotenous process taking place in consumer societies.\nMethod\nThis exploratory study aims to introduce the neotenous char-\nacteristics of childlike consumer behavior. Below we present\nthe participants, materials, and procedures employed in this\nresearch.\nParticipants\nBritish data were collected in 2007 by the Toluna online panel,\nan independent survey technology provider, on behalf of an\ninternational research consultancy. The authors collected the\nFrench data in 2014 through a direct online invitation to fill in\nthe translated questionnaire. Participants were considered as\nconsumers from the moment they answered items1 related to\nconsumption. In total, 499 British consumers (representative\nrespective samples.\nAmong the British participants, 9.6% are located in Scot-\nEngland. With regard to their social grade classification,2\n26.8% have higher and intermediate managerial, administra-\ntive, professional occupations (i.e., Grades A and B); 26.9%\nhave supervisory, clerical and junior managerial, administra-\ntive, professional occupations (i.e., Grade C1); 22.4% have\nskilled manual occupations (i.e., Grade C2); and 23.9% have\nsemiskilled or unskilled manual occupations, casual occupa-\ntions, or are unemployed or pensioners (i.e., Grades D and\nE). Finally, 42.7% of British participants are married, 36.2%\nare not engaged in a love relationship, and 60.7% have at least\none child.\nAmong the French participants, 38.7% live in the country's\nthree largest cities. Concerning socioprofessional groups,3\n0.7% of participants are farmers; 8.6% are craft workers, retai-\nlers, or business owners; 21.9% are chief executives, managers,\nor have higher grade intellectual occupations; 16.1% have\nintermediate occupations; 27.1% are white-collar workers;\n10.3% are blue-collar workers; and 15.3% are retired, students,\nor unemployed. Finally, 70.2% are married or live with a sig-\nnificant other, and 65.4% have at least one child.\nMaterials and Procedures\nFollowing the widely used Churchill (1979) paradigm and the\nitems to be used in factor analysis was identified from a set\nof 109 items. The items are based on neoteny, child cognition,\nand more generally psychology literature, and they cover the\nfollowing six neoteny-related characteristics: play (P. G. Bate-\nregression (Fischer, 1987; Lindahl, Heimann, & Ullstadius,\nGnepp, 1983; Greene, Krcmar, Walters, Rubin, & Hale,\ncomplete. The first section of the questionnaire dealt with\ndemographic and socioeconomic questions (e.g., gender, age,\nsocial grade, income, place of residence, and chief income\nearner in the household). The second section displayed the 55\nitems about consumer neoteny that were retained. Items were\nmeasured on 5-point Likert-type scales, 1 being disagree\nstrongly and 5 being agree strongly. A third section, for the\nexclusive use of the research consultancy and not used in the\npresent research, dealt with consumption habits and behaviors.\nThe 2014 questionnaire took an average time of 8 min to\ncomplete. The second section of the 2007 questionnaire was\ntranslated through the back-translation method as detailed by\nBrislin (1970) and put online for French consumers. A prelim-\ninary section was created for demographic and socioeconomic\ndata. French items were measured with 11-point Likert-type\nAlemany Oliver 3\nscales, 1 being disagree strongly and 11 being agree strongly,\nand took the form of moving cursors initially placed on scale\npoint 6. The number of points was decided with the aim to get\nsmoother distributions with greater variation (Dawes, 2002).\nAlso, for future research, 11-point Likert-type scales proved\nto be valid and reliable in cross-cultural studies (Scherpenzeel\n& Saris, 1997). Participants had a chance to win gift cards if\nthey completed the questionnaire. The university ethics com-\nmittee approved this research. All respondents were informed\nof the general aims, their anonymity was guaranteed, and all\ngave full consent.\nReplication procedures for further comparisons of results\nresearchers, ``the replicability of research findings in psychol-\nogy [ . . . ] has been increasingly questioned.'' In the context of\nthis research, replicability is even more critical because the\nfindings deal with evolutionary processes. As a result, they\nshould be compared across several generations to observe\nchanges in childlike consumer behavior. For this reason,4 the\nUK sample was randomly split in half to conduct internal\nreplication analysis consisting of running an exploratory factor\nanalysis (EFA) on each split sample (Osborne & Fitzpatrick,\nExternal replicability was tested by collecting new data 7\nyears later in France. The first reason for collecting new data at\na different time and place is that cultural differences between\nthe UK and France may have consequences for the four dimen-\nsions of childlike consumer behavior and the external replica-\ntion of the results. As shown in Figure 1, these two countries\ndiffer with respect to the six dimensions of national culture\n(Hofstede, Hofstede, & Minkov, 2010). Moreover, dimensions\nsuch as uncertainty avoidance may be related to childlike con-\nsumer dimensions such as stimulus seeking. The other reason is\nthat consumers in 2007 (first sample) were not affected by the\nglobal financial crisis yet, while 2014 consumers (second sam-\nple) have possibly experienced a decline in their savings, as\nwell as job uncertainty, increased risk aversion or lower dispo-\nsable income. Since it has been shown that consumers change\ntheir behavior after an economic recession (e.g., Kamakura &\nDu, 2012), it was critical to replicate the analysis and see\nwhether the four dimensions remained stable.\nResults\nEFA\nAn EFA using the maximum likelihood method of extraction\nand oblique rotation (promax) was conducted in the UK's ran-\ntion methods was based on the assumption of dependence\nbetween factors.\nFour factors and 17 items were retained, and they explain\n71% of total variance. The four factors are escapism, reality\nconflict, stimulus seeking, and control of aggression. The num-\nber of factors was determined by the Guttman\u00adKaiser criterion\n(four factors were suggested), Cattell's scree test (four factors\nwere suggested), Velicer's map (four factors were suggested),\nHorn's parallel analysis (five factors were suggested), and\nfinally their interpretability.\nThe correlation matrix did not reveal a multicollinearity\nissue, the Kaiser\u00adMeyer\u00adOlkin (KMO) measures of sampling\nadequacy were higher than 0.8 (KMO \u00bc .824), Bartlett's test of\nKMO values for each variable (i.e., elements on the diagonal of\nantiimage correlation matrix) were all greater than .74. Com-\nmunalities are presented in Table 1. Finally, reliability was\nmeasured with Cronbach's a, Jo\n\u00a8reskog's r, and item-to-total\ncorrelations. Discriminant validity was assessed with the factor\ncorrelation matrix.\nConfirmatory Factor Analyses (CFAs)\nIn order to test the factor structure's quality of representation,\nwe conducted a first CFA with the second UK split sample (n \u00bc\nPower estimates show an acceptable sample size for CFA (min-\nlum, Browne, & Sugawara, 1996).

The results\nof Harman's test indicate that a single factor cannot explain the\nmajority of variance (only 20.5% of variance explained). Addi-\ntionally, we observed very little change after adding a latent\nfactor in the CFA model and comparing the standardized\nregression weights from this model with the original model's\nstandardized regression weights.\nThe measures reveal a good fit for the four-factor model,\nfit index (AGFI) \u00bc .89; comparative fit index (CFI) \u00bc .97;\nTucker\u00adLewis index (TLI) \u00bc .96; standardized root mean\nPower Distance\nAvoidance\nLong-term\nOrientation\nIndulgence\nFrance United Kingdom\nUncertainty\nMasculinity\nIndividualism\nFigure 1.

The scale is reliable and valid across\nWestern European cultural contexts (United Kingdom\nand France).\nThe stimulus-seeking dimension involves the tendency to\nseek stimulation in a variety of ways and to respond to exciting\nsituations in a positive way. It relates to confidence in oneself,\nlife, and people, and it is very close to Mehrabian and Russell's\n(1974) ``need for arousal'' dimension. The reality conflict\ndimension captures the struggle that consumers have with the\ncomplexities and responsibilities of adult reality. The escapism\ndimension underlines the rich inner life of consumers who may\nneed to retire from reality but also adapt to it. Finally, the\ncontrol of aggression dimension represents consumers' lack\nof aggressive control due to difficulties in managing events,\nissues, and (more generally) every situation that involves\ndecision-making skills.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe main objective of this research was to provide a deeper\nunderstanding of neoteny in the context of consumer society.\nWe have proposed that paedomorphosis, which is the retention\nof ancestors' juvenile characteristics into adult consumers, can\nexplain childlike consumer behavior in part. Among paedo-\nmorphic processes, we focused on neoteny, which is a retarda-\ntion of somatic development. Our findings show that stimulus\nseeking (or the need for arousal), reality conflict, escapism, and\ncontrol of aggression are four dimensions of consumer beha-\nvior that are theoretically partly explained by neoteny. For this\nreason, these four dimensions represent childlike consumer\nbehavior. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the\nfirst empirical work in marketing research to tie paedomorpho-\nsis--and more precisely, neoteny--to consumer psychology\nand childlike behavior.\nLimitations\nA first limitation is the low but still acceptable reliability of\ncomposite score (Jo\n\u00a8reskog's r \u00bc 0.70) of the escapism dimen-\nsion. A possible reason is that the escapism dimension is too\nbroad a spectrum to be grasped in its entirety. For instance,\nescapism is linked to imagination, but imagination can be\nrelated to fantasy, creativity, intellect, or complexity (Hofstee,\nde Raad, & Goldberg, 1992). It is also highly related to the\nbroad concept of play, which remains one of the most difficult\nA second limitation concerns our inability to compare these\nfindings across time and with non-Western European places.\nBecause paedomorphosis is the retention of ancestors' juvenile\ncharacteristics into adulthood, several studies should be con-\nducted in the future to draw comparisons with the present find-\nings. Moreover, these findings should be compared with\npopulations from non-Western European cultures. Culture can\nbe considered a mediator or moderator variable (Cu\u00b4\nthat can reveal different items or even different childlike\ndimensions. For instance, Confucianism and Buddhism still\nshape Japanese culture and, as a collectivistic society, Japan\nemphasizes social harmony and interdependence. These cul-\ntural characteristics can have consequences on emotion reg-\nulation (Matsumoto, 2006) and may impact not only the\nscores obtained by consumers on the four dimensions of child-\nlike consumer behavior but also the dimensions themselves.\nFor example, decision-making, which is related to the reality\nconflict and control of aggression dimensions, is also related\nto emotion regulation (Heilman, Cris\n\u00b8an, Houser, Miclea, &\nA third limitation is the lack of empirical evidence showing\nthe relationship between the present findings and those of\nHell\u00b4\nen and Sa\n\u00a8a\n\u00a8ksja\n\u00a8rvi (2013). More particularly, consumer\nneoteny could explain the positive attitude that neotenous prod-\nucts trigger. For example, needs for attachment and safety dur-\ning periods of regression could lead to a preference for\nanthropomorphic and neotenous products and brands. Similarly\nto brand love, which can create feelings of confidence (Batra,\nand products would be able to recreate a safe environment in\nwhich adult consumers can live out their unstable life moments\nand reality conflicts more easily.\nChildlike Consumer Behavior and Intelligence\nA critical discussion topic relates to the potential role that\nintelligence--defined in this article as the ability to achieve\ngoals and adapt to different and changing environments (Legg\n& Hutter, 2007)--might have on the four dimensions of child-\nlike consumer behavior highlighted among the samples. Neo-\ntenous processes are partly responsible for the extended\ndevelopment of the human brain that allows individuals to\ncontinue learning and accounts for human high intelligence\n(Gibson, 1991). One reason for such cognitive abilities might\nbe found in the frontal lobe, which benefits from the extended\ndevelopment of the human brain and contributes to intelligence\nby providing executive functions, for example (Bunge, Dudu-\nDuncan, Emslie, Williams, Johnson, & Freer, 1996). The fron-\ntal lobe is able to enhance working memory, help individuals to\nregulate aggression, and allow mental flexibility, abstract\nthinking, and the capacity to keep related pieces of information\nin their minds for task analysis (Duncan, 2005; Miyake et al.,\nIn the context of this research, the four dimensions of child-\nlike consumer behavior might be related to the frontal lobe and\nintelligence by reflecting different adaptive and maladaptive\nbehaviors. Our findings reveal that two dimensions, namely,\nstimulus seeking and escapism, relate directly to play. Play is\nan adaptive, experiential function (Bateson & Martin, 2013)\nand a critical element in cognitive development (Bjorklund,\n1997) that can partly explain an increase in the amount of\nsynaptic pruning that shapes the neural network (McShea &\nHordijk, 2013). Therefore, stimulus seeking and escapism\n6 Evolutionary Psychology\nmight be interpreted as motivational processes of personal and\ncreative environment modification that are mainly made pos-\nsible through play and can be partly explained by intelligence\nand the extended development of the frontal lobe.\nConcerning the reality conflict and control of aggression\ndimensions, they are both linked to decision-making.\nDecision-making is related to adaptive behavior (Keith, Fehr-\nmann, Harrison, & Pottebaum, 1987; Payne, Bettman, & John-\nson, 1988). Following the somatic marker hypothesis\n(Damasio, Tranel, & Damasio, 1991), the reality conflict and\ncontrol of aggression dimensions might be explained by an\nimmature frontal lobe that would produce low capacities in\ndecision-making and qualitatively poor, ineffective and aggres-\nsive solutions to a problem (Crick & Dodge, 1994; Evans &\nSlaby & Guerra, 1988). Therefore, one may say that the reality\nconflict and control of aggression dimensions would reflect the\ninability of consumers to engage in a process of personal and\ncreative environment modification partly due to an immature\nfrontal lobe that makes exploration, exploitation, and adjust-\nment more difficult (Cohen, McClure, & Yu, 2007).\nIn conclusion, findings suggest that childlike consumer\nbehavior might be related to the frontal lobe and intelligence\nby reflecting different adaptive and maladaptive behaviors.\nHowever, the four dimensions seem to use different types of\nintelligence--mainly a cognitive and an emotional one. While\nthe stimulus-seeking and escapism dimensions would be more\nrelated to cognitive intelligence (e.g., stimulus seekers are the\ncreators of an enriched environment that triggers cognitive\nstimulation; Raine, Reynolds, Venables, & Mednick, 2002),\nthe reality conflict and control of aggression dimensions would\nreflect poor decision-making skills that can be explained by\nlower levels of emotional intelligence (Bar-On, Tranel, Den-\nburg, & Bechara, 2003). In this context, further research should\ninvestigate how adaptive behaviors in childlike consumption\ncontexts can vary according to the levels of cognitive intelli-\ngence and emotional intelligence.\nManagerial Implications\nFindings should help managers to segment their consumers\naround the four dimensions of childlike consumer behavior and\nto develop new positioning strategies. Brands can exploit these\nfour dimensions to communicate with a new language and can\nadapt their customer relationship management (CRM) pro-\ngrams according to their target market. For instance, if the\ntarget market is made up of stimulus seekers, then the relation-\nship between the brand and the consumer should be based on\n``best friendship'' (Fournier, 1998). By contrast, if the target\nmarket mainly comprises consumers who score high on the\nreality conflict dimension, then the relationship should be\nbased on ``dependency'' (Fournier, 1998).\nAnother way to exploit the four dimensions of childlike\nconsumer behavior in CRM is by differentiating between\nscores related to cognitive intelligence and those related to\nemotional intelligence. While it has not been widely discussed\nin marketing, emotional intelligence plays a critical role in the\nbuying process and consumption experience. For instance,\nsalespeople with high emotional intelligence can develop lon-\nger relationships with customers and increase sales revenue\n(Kidwell, Hardesty, Murtha, & Sheng, 2011). From the con-\nsumer experience standpoint, we suggest that managers relate\nthe dimensions of their brand personality to the type of\nintelligence the brand reflects and use the four dimensions\nof childlike behavior to trigger cognitive or emotional stimula-\ntion accordingly.\nFinally, it is critical that managers develop playful products\nand services and differentiate between the types of play. For\ninstance, consumers engage in play whether they score high on\nescapism or stimulus seeking. However, play used for escapism\nis an imaginative play that one does not find in the stimulus-\nseeking dimension. This differentiation is visible, for example,\nin Las Vegas hotels that offer not only imaginative play but\nalso attractions and contests. The focus on play makes even\nmore sense in advanced industrial societies for two reasons.\nFirst, disposable income increases and allows more leisure\nactivities for consumers (Engel's law). Second, social adult-\nhood is postponed at later ages (Arnett, 2000), while the con-\nsumption of sugar, fat, and endocrine disrupting chemicals\nprovoke progenesis (i.e., the retention of juvenile traits through\nan acceleration of sexual maturation; Aksglaede, S\u00f8rensen,\nlead consumers to accentuate childlike behavior since they\nbecome more juvenile, biologically speaking, while simulta-\nneously living in societies that postpone entry into adulthood.\nIn the leisure sector, increasing playfulness should give rise to\nnew opportunities in specific markets. A good example is the\nincreasing success of film tourism that allows consumers to\nescape mundane environments and adopt a childlike behavior\nthrough regression (Crompton, 1979; Macionis & Sparks,\n2009). Utilitarian products should become more and more\nplayful, too, in particular thanks to the digital turn and the\nInternet of Things that transforms any product into an inter-\nactive and ludic object (e.g., smart or connected refrigerator,\ndoors, toothbrush . . . ).\n"
