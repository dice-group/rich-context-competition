Older\nparents who begin to have difficulties in everyday function-\ning may benefit from emotional and practical help from\ntheir children (Krause, 1986; Silverstein & Bengtson,\n1994), whereas their middle-aged children may still\nwelcome support and advice from parents, and, on occasion,\nfinancial help (Cooney & Uhlenberg, 1992; Suitor, Pille-\nMuch of the literature on intergenerational exchanges has\nrelied on reports from a single family member, either a\nmiddle-aged adult or aging parent (Bianchi, Evans, Hotz,\nMcGarry, & Seltzer, 2007). Assessments of multiple per-\nspectives may provide a more comprehensive picture of\nintergenerational exchanges and their implications for the\nwell-being of family members (Freedman, Wolf, Soldo, &\nStephen, 1991). Multiple informants, however, often do not\nagree when reporting on their intergenerational support\nexchanges (Klein Ikkink, van Tilburg, & Knipscheer, 1999;\nRossi & Rossi, 1990). Although the observed discrepancies\nin these reports may be regarded as random error, discrep-\nant reports of the same events are a meaningful feature of\nfamily relationships and interactions (Cox & Paley, 1997).\nIn particular, differences in perspectives on how much sup-\nport is given and received could become a source of strain\nin the relationship and jeopardize future exchanges. Only a\nfew papers, however, have systematically examined factors\nthat might account for these discrepancies (Lin, 2008;\nThe present study examined predictors of discrepancies\nin reports of support exchanged between middle-aged adults\nand their parents. We obtained independent reports of support\nexchanged from middle-aged adults (aged 40\u00ad60 years) and\ntheir parents (aged 59\u00ad96 years). We considered total support\nas well as exchanges of five specific types of support (emo-\ntional, practical assistance, listening to talk about one's day,\nadvice, and financial). We investigated reports on both\ndownward exchanges (support given by parent and received\nby child) and upward exchanges (support received by\nparent and given by child). The study focused on two ques-\ntions: (a) What is the level and direction of discrepancy in\nparents' and children's reports about support exchanges?\nand (b) What predictors explain discrepancies in reports\nabout the frequency of support exchanges?\nDiscrepancies in Reports of Support Exchanges Between\nAging Parents and Their Middle-Aged Children\nKyungmin Kim,1 Steven H.

Fingerman3\n1Department of Human Development and Family Studies, Pennsylvania State University, University Park.\n2Life Course Development Program, Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.\n3Department of Child Development and Family Studies, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana.\nObjectives. This study investigated predictors of discrepancies in reports of 5 types of support that aging parents\nand their middle-aged children exchanged with one another. Predictors included structural factors, including needs and\nresources and dyadic characteristics, and psychological factors, including family obligation and investment in the\nrelationship.\nMultilevel models assessed the level of discrepancies between dyadic members and examined predictors accounting for\nthe discrepancies. We considered downward (from parent to child) and upward (from child to parent) directions in support\nexchanges.\nResults. For upward support from adult children to their parents, children reported that they gave more than their aging\nparents reported receiving. For downward support from parents to children, the results differed depending on the type of\nsupport. Discrepancies between parents' and children's reports were associated with parents' feelings of obligation\ntoward children and children's ratings of the importance of parent\u00adchild relationship.\nDiscussion. These results suggest the importance of considering multiple perspectives and the direction of exchanges\nbetween generations. Discrepancies in reports of support reflect both self-enhancement and family context and may be an\nimportant source of misunderstanding and conflict between generations.\nKey Words: Discrepancy--Dyadic reports--Intergenerational exchanges--Social support.\nDiscrepancies in Reports of Support Exchanges\nBetween Parents and Their Adult Children\nOur view of discrepancies is drawn from the social\npsychological literature on self-enhancement (Krueger, 1998;\nTaylor & Brown, 1988) and from a family systems perspec-\ntive that posits that structural and psychological features of\nfamily relationships will contribute to discrepancies (Cox &\nPaley, 1997). Self-enhancement theory suggests that people\nwill generally view their own actions in a more positive light\nthan others' actions. As applied to exchanges between\nparents and children, self-enhancement theory suggests that\neach generation would report more support given and less\nsupport received than the other generation. We do not know,\nhowever, if the discrepancies are due to distortions in the\nreports of one or both persons, but only that the direction of\ndiscrepancies is consistent with self-enhancement. These\ntrends toward self-enhancement, however, may be modified\nby specific family contexts and relationships.\nPrior research has found discrepancies between parent\nand child reports about contact and exchanges of assistance\n(Giarrusso, Stallings, & Bengtson, 1995; Rossi & Rossi,\ncies, however, only assessed whether each person reported\ngiving help or not but did not take into account the amount\nor frequency of support or the degree of discrepancy in\nAnother limitation of prior work is a focus on one direc-\ntion of exchange, mainly support given by children to an\nsupport between generations flows in both directions\nexchanges between parents and children can have different\nmeanings and consequences depending on the direction of\nhelp. In upward exchanges, most studies have found that\nmiddle-aged children tend to report giving more support to\nparents than their parents reported receiving, especially\nprior studies have shown mixed results. Mandemakers and\nDykstra found that parents report giving more support than\nchildren report receiving, regardless of the type of support.\nIn contrast, Shapiro reported that children tended to report\ngiving and receiving more instrumental support (e.g.,\nhousework, help with errands) than parents reported, and\nparents tended to report giving and receiving more\nemotional support than children reported. Thus, in explaining\ndiscrepancies, Shapiro emphasized the type of support\nexchanged (instrumental or emotional support), rather than\nthe direction of exchanges.\nThe first objective of this study was to look at whether\nthere are discrepancies in reports of specific types of\nexchanges at the dyadic level, both for upward and down-\nward exchanges. Drawing from family systems theory that\nsuggests each person in a family has a different perspective\non events and processes, we hypothesized that there would\nbe significant discrepancies in reports of support given and\nreceived by parents and their adult children. Based on self-\nenhancement theory, we expected that both parents and\nchildren will report giving more support than the other\nperson reports receiving. As some prior empirical work has\nfound that the amount and direction of discrepancies vary\ndepending on type of support (Shapiro, 2004), we also\nexplored individual types of support as well as overall\nsupport. Certain types of support (e.g., financial) may have\nmore saliency in the family relationship and may be more\nlikely to produce discrepancies between giver and receiver.\nPossible Sources of Discrepancies in Parents'\nand Children's Reports\nAlthough studies have reported discrepancies in re-\nports of support exchanges between generations (Giarrusso\nexamined predictors of discrepancies in reports of support\nexchanges in a multivariate framework. Lin (2008) and\nShapiro (2004) focused on structural characteristics (e.g.,\nincome and health) as predictors of discrepancies. Mande-\nmakers and Dykstra (2008) is the only prior study examining\npsychological factors (e.g., obligation, relationship quality,\nand dissatisfaction with support) as predictors of discrepan-\ncies between generations. In the present study, we focused\non four dimensions of the parent\u00adchild relationship to exam-\nine discrepant reports of exchanges between middle-aged\nchildren and aging parents. These factors include structural\nfactors (e.g., individuals' needs and resources and dyadic\ncharacteristics) and psychological factors (e.g., filial and\nparental obligation and investment in the relationship). We\nselected these factors based on prior findings and because\nthey potentially affect how people view these exchanges.\nNeeds and Resources of Aging Parents and Middle-Aged\nChildren\nNeeds and resources are the main determinants of the\namount of intergenerational support (Davey, Janke, &\nlead to different perceptions of intergenerational exchanges\nbetween generations. When one generation has fewer\neconomic and social resources than the other, the imbalance\nmay affect perceptions of support exchanges between\nPrior studies have shown that aging parents who have a\ngreater need for assistance may underestimate the amount\nof help received to protect their self-concepts from a feeling\nof dependency (Lyons, Zarit, Sayer, & Whitlatch, 2002;\nWalker, Pratt, Martell, & Martin, 1991; Zweibel & Lydens,\n1990). Conversely, as children are called upon to give more\nhelp to aging parents, it may seem that they are providing\nmore assistance than they actually are. Given norms about\nfilial obligation, some adult children with limited resources\n(e.g., time and money) or competing demands (e.g., chil-\ndren with special needs) may overestimate how much they\nactually give as a way of avoiding feelings of guilt about not\nestimated needs and resources from social structural char-\nacteristics of both parties, including age, education, income,\nhealth, and marital status. Persons with more education,\nhigher income, and who are in better health will potentially\nbe able to give more assistance and help, whereas those\nwith lower levels of education, income, and health will have\ngreater needs for support from their parent or child. Simi-\nlarly, having a spouse indicates another resource, whereas\nnot having a spouse would be associated with potentially\ngreater needs for assistance or fewer resources for provid-\ning help. Finally age in the older generation is likely to be\nassociated with greater needs and lower resources.\nThe Parent\u00adChild Dyadic Characteristics: Gender and\nProximity\nWhen a parent and child are the same gender, their\nperceptions of intergenerational exchanges may be more\nchild of the same gender tend to spend more time with one\nanother either in person or by telephone or e-mail, and this\nmay be particularly true of mothers and daughters (Coward\nThis increased time may lead to greater congruence in\nreports of intergenerational exchanges (Burton & Blair, 1991).\nIn addition, proximity of parents and children and sharing\nthe same household can provide more opportunities for\nshared perceptions of exchanges (Shapiro, 2004). We would\nexpect reports of coresident dyads and of dyads who live in\ncloser proximity but do not live together to have greater\ncongruence in their reports. The exception may be financial\nsupport, which can become blurred in a shared household.\nNorms of Family Obligation\nNorms of family obligation are culturally defined rights\nand duties that specify the ways in which family members\nare expected to behave toward each other (Gans & Silver-\nobligations are strong, individuals are more likely to present\na culturally desirable response to questions about exchanges\nof support. Thus, they may report that they are receiving\nmore from or giving more to their dyadic partner. Using\ndata from the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study, Mande-\nmakers and Dykstra (2008) showed that parents' family\nobligations were a strong predictor of discrepancies for\nboth upward and downward exchanges, whereas children's\nfilial obligations were not associated with discrepancies for\neither direction. Given that norms of family obligation can\nchange over the adult life span, across historical time, and\nacross cultures (Gans & Silverstein, 2006; Rossi & Rossi,\n1990), use of a data set from the United States, focusing on\nspecific life stages, (e.g., offspring in midlife and parents in\nold age) may bring different results. Specifically, because\nwe focused on parent\u00adchild dyads in later years, we expected\nthat children's filial obligation toward aging parents would\nalso show a significant effect on discrepancies.\nInvestment in the Relationship\nThe investment or importance that parents and their chil-\ndren place on their relationship may affect perceptions of\nsupport given and received. Investment represents a psycho-\nlogical dimension drawn from role centrality theory that\nholds that events in roles that are more salient are more\nlikely to affect self-esteem (Gurin, Veroff, & Feld, 1960;\nMartire, Stephens, & Townsend, 2000). Likewise, events in\ncentral roles may be perceived in a more self-enhancing\nway. Thus, we would expect that higher ratings of the\nimportance of the relationship would be associated with\ngreater discrepancies in reported support.\nThe concept of investment in the relationship is related to\nthe generational stake hypothesis (Bengtson & Kuypers,\ntheir relationships with children more highly than do their\nchildren and thus may overreport both the help they give to\nand receive from children. Studies based on this hypothesis,\nhowever, have assumed that each generation has a different\nstake in the relationship, rather than directly measuring that\ncurrent study, we used a direct measure of the importance of\nthe relationship to each generation to provide a better test of\nthe hypothesis (Fingerman, Chen, Hay, Cichy, & Lefkowitz,\n2006). We expected that individuals who view the relation-\nship as more important would report more support they are\nproviding and receiving. Because parents are typically more\ninvested in the tie than offspring, we expected parents to\nshow this pattern more than offspring.\nIn sum, this study examined the level and direction of\ndiscrepancies in reports of support exchanges between\nmiddle-aged children and aging parents at the dyadic level,\nboth for upward and downward flow. We also examined\npredictors of the discrepancies in the reports about exchanges.\nBased on the previous literature, as well as self-enhancement\nand family systems perspectives, we expected that parents'\nand children's needs and resources, dyadic characteristics,\nnorms of family obligation, and investment in the relation-\nship would explain discrepancies in their reports of support\nexchanges.\nMethod\nSample\nThis analysis is based on data from \"The Family Exchanges\nStudy\" (Fingerman, Miller, Birditt, & Zarit, 2009). The first\nstep in the sampling plan was to recruit respondents aged\n40\u00ad60 years who had at least one living parent and one or\nmore biological children older than 18 years. Potential\nrespondents were randomly selected from phone lists from\nGenesys Corporation as well as from random digit dialing\nfrom the Philadelphia Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area\n(five counties in southeastern Pennsylvania and four coun-\nties in New Jersey; Pennsylvania State Data Center, 2001)\nPeople living in Philadelphia county, high-density minority\nneighborhoods, and lower income households were overs-\nampled, which resulted in 37% minority participants. Inter-\nviews were conducted from January through August 2008.\nThe target (middle-aged) participants completed 1-hr-long\ncomputer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) and received\n$25 for their time. The CATI software allowed for random\norder of administration of sections of the interview. The target\nparticipants completed a series of questions for each living\nparent, including exchanges of support, beliefs on relation-\nship with parents, and other demographic information.\n(44%) had parents who also agreed to be interviewed. In\n223 cases, one parent was interviewed, and in 57 cases, both\nparents were interviewed, which yielded a total of 337\ndiscrete dyads nested within 280 families. We considered\neach parent\u00adchild dyad as a separate unit because exchanges\nbetween the middle-aged child and his or her mother and\nfather were measured separately. The aging parents (G1)\nwere asked a set of questions that were identical to those for\ntheir children (G2). In no instance was the older adult inter-\nviewed with his or her child present or vice versa. The\namount of missing data within the sample was quite small,\nbut in the few instances where items were missing, we used\npair-wise deletion in specific analyses. Table 1 presents in-\ndividual characteristics of each parent and middle-aged\nchild and the dyadic characteristics.\nMeasures\nSupport exchanges.--The dependent variable was the\nIntergenerational Support Scale (Fingerman et al., 2009),\nwhich assesses how often participants provided and received\nfive types of support: emotional support, practical assis-\ntance, advice, financial support, and listening to talk about\ndaily events. Four items reflect domains from the Social\nSupport Resources Index (Vaux, 1988; Vaux & Harrison,\n1985), and the fifth, listening to talks about daily events,\nwas drawn from prior work on intergenerational ties\n(Fingerman, 2000). Participants rated how frequently they\nprovided each type of support to their dyadic partner, and how\nfrequently they received that type of support on a 8-point\nscale: 1 (less than once a year or not at all), 2 (once a year),\n3 (a few times a year), 4 (monthly), 5 (a few times a month),\n6 (weekly), 7 (a few times a week), and 8 (daily). We summed\nscores across the five types of support given (a = .80 for G1\nTable 1.

We also examined each\ntype of support separately in post hoc analyses.\nTable 2 presents G1's and G2's reports on total support\nand each type of support in downward and upward exchanges.\nPaired t-tests revealed that in upward exchanges, children\nreported giving more total support than parents reported\nreceiving.Reportsofthetotalamountofdownwardexchanges,\nhowever, did not differ between G1 and G2.\nPredictor Variables\nNeeds and resources.--Five variables related to needs\nand resources were obtained from each parent and child:\nage, years of education, income, self-rated health, and marital\nstatus. Participants indicated household income in 2007\nwas measured using a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (poor)\nto 5 (excellent). Because we assumed that respondents\nwho have spouses have more resources to meet their\nneeds, marital status was coded 1 for (re)married and 0 for\nnot-married.\nThe parent\u00adchild dyadic characteristics.--Three variables\nwere used for dyadic characteristics of parent\u00adchild dyads:\ngender composition, coresidence, and residential proximity.\nGender composition was categorized into four groups on\nthe basis of parents' and children's gender: father\u00adson,\nfather\u00addaughter, mother\u00adson, and mother\u00addaughter. These\ncategories were dummy coded using mother\u00addaughter as\nthe reference group. Coresidence is a dichotomous variable\ncoded 1 for coresident dyads. Residential proximity is the\ndistance between parents' and non-coresident children's\nresidences in miles. For coresident dyads, their residential\nproximity was coded 0. To address positive skew of dis-\ntance, we used a log-linear transformation in analyses.\nFamily obligation.--Parental obligation (for parents) or\nfilial obligation (for children) asked how often parents or\nchildren should provide adult children or parents following\nsix types of support: emotional support, practical assistance,\nfinancial support, listening to the other's talk, socializing, and\nadvice (Silverstein, Gans, &Yang, 2006). The answers ranged\nfrom 1 (never) to 5 (always). Means of the six items were com-\nputed (a = .67 for parents; a = .79 for children). As shown in\nTable 1, children's obligation toward parents was significantly\nhigher than parents' obligation toward children.\nInvestment in the parent\u00adchild relationship.--Partici-\npants rated investment in parent and offspring using a one-\nitem assessment of the importance of the parent or child\ncompared with other social partners (Fingerman et al.,\nimportant person in your life), 5 (among the 3 most impor-\ntant), 4 (among the 6 most important), 3 (among the 10 most\nimportant), 2 (among the 20 most important), and 1 (less\nimportant than that). Paired sample t-tests revealed that parents\nreported significantly greater importance of relationship\nwith their child than children did (Table 1).\nAnalysis Plan\nTo analyze data at the level of the dyad, we used multilevel\nmodeling (SAS PROC MIXED, Cary, NC; Littell, Milliken,\nStroup, & Wolfinger, 1996), which accounts for the inter-\ndependence of individuals within each dyad or family and\nenables researchers to predict both the level of the outcome\nand the level and direction of differences in reports of the\noutcome within pairs (Maguire, 1999). In a multilevel\nmodel, individual observations of parents and children\n(Level 1) are nested within the dyad (Level 2), which is the\nunit of analysis. This method has been used to investigate a\nnumber of questions regarding dyadic reports within family\n(Barnett, Marchall, Raudenbush, & Brenna, 1993; Lyons\nGiven that some dyads (33.8%) are nested in families\n(Level 3), we also considered Level 3 (family level) mod-\nels to explain the shared variance of dyads within the same\nfamily.\nAt Level 1 (within-dyad approach), we used observations\nfrom each dyad member to fit a regression line on an indicator\nTable 2.

This regression model was\nsummarized by two parameters: an intercept and a slope. The\nintercept represents the mean level of support exchange for\neach matched pair (averaged across the dyad members). The\nslope captures the degree of discrepancy in the level of sup-\nport exchange between the dyad members. We modeled the\nindividual score (Yijk\n) for ith member in the jth dyad in the kth\nfamily as\nGeneration\n \n= + +\n( ) ,\nijk jk jk ijk ijk\nY e\nwhich is a function of an intercept (b0jk\n, the mean score\nacross dyads), a slope (b1jk\n, the degree of discrepancy\nbetween the pair), and individual-level errors of prediction\n(eijk\n). (The indicator variable, Generation, was coded -0.5\nfor parents (G1) and 0.5 for children (G2). This is an\nalternative form of dummy coding to 0 and 1 for examin-\ning means and discrepancies between dyad members. The\nadvantage of coding -0.5 and 0.5 is that the intercept can\nrepresent a mean across dyad members. Also, the slope\nrepresents a discrepancy between dyad members, which is\nequivalent to coding of 0 and 1. A negative coefficient for\ndiscrepancy indicates that parents reported higher level of\nexchanges than children; a positive coefficient for discrep-\nancy indicates that children reported higher level of\nexchanges than parents.) We used an unstructured covari-\nance matrix to specify the random effects. At Level 1, if\nthe dyadic mean (intercept) and discrepancy (slope) have\nsignificant variance components, it is appropriate to proceed\nwith a Level 2 model in which predictors can be included\nto explain the variation in these parameters (Bryk &\nAt Level 2 (between-dyads approach), the intercept\n(mean score of G1-G2 reports) and slope (discrepancy\nbetween G1-G2 reports) are treated as outcome variables,\nwhich are permitted to vary across dyads. We examined\nfour groups of predictors (needs and resources of parents\nand children, dyadic characteristics, family obligation, and\nparent\u00adchild relationship importance) to explain the varia-\ntion of the intercept and slope coefficients across dyads.\nBecause we expected that the predictors may be associated\nwith both mean and discrepancy level of support exchanges,\nwe included them as the predictors of both the intercept and\nthe slope.\n  \n  \n= + +\n= + +\n,\njk k k qjk jk\njk k k qjk jk\nwhere Wqjk\nare characteristics used as predictors of the\neffect of bpjk\n, and dp1k\nis the corresponding coefficient\nrepresenting the direction and strength of association be-\ntween characteristic Wqjk\nand bpjk\n. The error term (Upjk\n) indi-\ncates the deviation from Level 2 group mean that do not\nvary across dyad members.\nAt Level 3 (between-families approach), we included\nfamily level error terms to handle the nested structure of\ndyads in families.\n,\nk k\nk k\nV\nV\n \n \n= +\n= +\nwhere the error term (Vp0k\n) presents the deviation from\nLevel 3 group mean. Because only a small proportion of\nfamilies included two dyads, however, we compared two-\nlevel models and three-level models using the difference\nbetween -2 log likelihood coefficients from each model\nbased on a chi-square distribution to determine if adding\nfamily level improved the model fit.\nResults\nWe first present the results of baseline model with only\nthe indicator variable, Generation (G1 or G2), which esti-\nmates the mean level and the average discrepancy of dyadic\nreports. Then, we present the results of explanatory models\npredicting both the mean level and the discrepancies in reports\nof parents and children.\nBaseline Model\nIn the baseline model (Table 3), we examined dyad\ndiscrepancy scores (slopes) in downward and upward\nexchanges. The discrepancy score of total support was sig-\nnificant in upward exchanges (from G2 to G1), indicating\nthat children (G2) reported giving more support than parents\n(G1) reported receiving. The discrepancy of downward\nexchanges (from G1 to G2), however, was not significant,\nindicating that parents and offspring generally agreed on the\nsupport that parents provide to children.\nExamination of each type of support revealed that all five\ndiscrepancy scores for upward exchanges were positive\nscores, and three were significant (emotional support,\nlistening to other's talk, and financial support), which\nmeans that children consistently reported giving more than\nparents reported receiving for all types of support.\nAlthough parents and offspring generally agreed on total\ndownward support, there were discrepancies in perceptions\nof specific types of support, practical assistance and advice.\nThe discrepancy score for practical assistance was negative\ngiving more practical assistance than children reported\nreceiving, whereas the discrepancy score for advice was\npositive (B = 0.41, p < .01), indicating parents reported\ngiving less advice than children reported received.\nAll the random variance components for the intercepts\nand the discrepancy scores were significantly different\nfrom zero (p < .001) at Level 2, indicating that there were\nsubstantial amounts of variability in the mean level and the\ndyad discrepancy across parent\u00adchild dyads and Level 2\npredictors could be added for a further investigation of var-\niations of discrepancy. Next, when family level (Level 3)\nwas added to the random effects, the variance components\nin the mean level and the dyad discrepancy are significant\nfor family level. Compared to two-level models, the model\nfit also improved for both downward (-2 log likelihood =\npredictors of discrepancies in reports, we used three-level\nmodels.\nDeterminants of Discrepancies in Reports of Support\nExchanges\nTable 4 presents the results of multilevel regressions with\nfour sets of variables added to predict: (a) dyadic mean level\nof exchanges and (b) discrepancy in parent\u00adchild reports of\ntotal support in downward and upward exchanges. Our\ninterest is how parent and child view the same exchange, so\nalthough we showed findings for both mean levels (inter-\ncept) and discrepancies (slope), we focused on predictors of\ndiscrepancies. We also examined each of the five types of\nsupport in a separate model to confirm the results from total\namount of support and check whether there are different\npatterns for specific types of support (not shown in table).\nParents' and children's needs and resources had little\ninfluence on discrepancies of total support in downward and\nupward exchanges, with one exception that children's health\nwas positively associated with a discrepancy of downward\nexchange. That is, children in better health reported receiving\nmore support compared with their parents' reports of support\ngiven. Looking at each type of support, although some\nsignificant effects of children's characteristics were found on\ndiscrepancies, the effects were not consistent across most or\nall types of support.\nTurning to the parent\u00adchild dyad characteristics, none\nof the predictors were associated with discrepancies in\ndownward exchanges and only coresidence was positively\nassociated with a discrepancy score in upward exchanges,\nindicating that children who live together with their parents\nreported giving more help than parents reported receiving.\nPost hoc tests of each type of support showed that children\nof coresident dyads reported giving more advice (B = 2.08,\nreported receiving.\nParents' obligation toward children was the most consis-\ntent and significant predictor of discrepancies in reported\nsupport in both downward and upward exchanges. Parents\nwho have strong feelings of obligation toward children were\nlikely to report giving and receiving more support than chil-\ndren report. The post hoc tests of each type of support\nrevealed that for upward exchanges, parents' obligations\nwere significant for discrepancies in all types of support\nexcept financial support. For downward exchanges, parents'\nobligation was significant for discrepancies in practical\nChildren's obligation toward parents, however, was not\nassociated with discrepancies in total support for either\ndownward or upward exchanges. It should be noted that\nboth parents' and children's obligations were significantly\nassociated with mean levels of support exchanges.\nTurning to ratings of the importance of the relationship,\nchildren's ratings showed significant effects on discrepancies\nin total support for both downward and upward exchanges.\nChildren who regarded the relationship with their parent\nas more important tended to report giving and receiving\nmore than parents reported. For specific types of support,\nchildren's importance ratings were significant for the\nlistening to their parent (B = 0.30, p < .05) in downward\nTable 3.

Also, children's rating of importance was\nsignificantly associated with the level of upward and down-\nward exchanges. Interestingly, parents' perceived importance\nof the parent\u00adchild relationship was not associated with\ndiscrepancies as well as levels of support exchanges.\nDiscussion\nExchanges of support between parents and their adult\nchildren are used to meet everyday needs and sustain the\nbonds between generations. Our results suggest that parents\nand their adult children differ in systematic ways in their\nperceptions of how much support is exchanged. How each\ngeneration views these exchanges of support may be of\nconsiderable importance. If a parent\u00adchild dyad disagrees\non how much support is exchanged, it may lead to misun-\nderstandings, resentment, or conflict and may affect their\ncontinued willingness to give support to one another. For\nexample, in situations where parents perceive that children\ngive less support than children perceive they have given, a\nparent may feel entitled to receiving more frequent support,\nwhereas a child may interpret the discrepancy as indicating\nthe parent would like all of his/her time and attention. The\nways in which discrepancies affect parent\u00adchild relationships\nand future exchanges needs further exploration.\nTable 4.

For those exchanges, parents reported\ngiving more practical assistance and less advice than chil-\ndren reported receiving, which may still reflect self-\nenhancement, albeit in a different way. Giving practical\nhelp is consistent with a positive image of the parental role,\nwhile advice-giving may be interpreted by older adults as\nbeing intrusive and interfering in children's lives. This in-\nterpretation is consistent with our view that self-enhancement\nprocesses are modified by the family context.\nThis study allowed us to examine a wide range of factors\nthat might account for discrepancies, including structural\nfactors (needs and resources and dyadic characteristics) and\npsychological factors (family obligation and relationship\nimportance). These factors reflect family process and context\nregarding support exchanges within family. Our findings\nshowed that psychological aspects of family relationships\nhave most consistent effects on discrepancies. Interestingly,\ndifferent psychological factors affected discrepancies for\nparents and children. Parents who felt more obligations\ntoward their children reported both giving and receiving\nmore support than children reported. For children, although\nobligation was associated with the level of support they\nreported giving to and receiving from parents, it was not\nrelated to discrepancies in support. Rather, for children, rating\nof the importance of the relationship with their parents had a\nsignificant relation to discrepancies. These findings confirmed\nthe report of Mandemakers and Dykstra (2008) that only\nparent's feelings of obligation toward their children were\nassociated with discrepancies. Since our study focused on\noffspring in midlife and parents in old age, however, parents\nin the current study had lower feelings of obligation toward\ntheir children than children reported toward parents. As\nparents age, they may feel less overall obligation to children\nbecause they may have fewer resources, greater needs, or\ntheir children are settled and have fewer needs. Nonetheless,\nonly parents' obligation to children exerts an influence on\nperceptions of support given and received. It makes sense\nthat parents who feel a stronger obligation would report giv-\ning more support than children report receiving. They may\nalso cast positive light on support received because they\nview it as reciprocation of the obligation they feel toward\ntheir children.\nWe found a similar pattern regarding investment in the\nrelationship. Parents reported the relationship as more\nimportant to them than did their children, but relationship\nimportance was a significant predictor of discrepancies only\nfor children. Prior studies have documented that children\nplace less importance on their relationship with parents than\nparents do with children (Bengtson & Kuypers, 1971;\nGiarrusso et al., 1995). Our findings extend that work by\ndemonstrating that rather children's investment in the rela-\ntionship has an influence on discrepancies between parents\nand children in perceptions of support. The finding that chil-\ndren with greater investment would perceive giving more\nsupport to parents makes sense. Viewing their relationship\nwith parents as more important may also lead them to cast a\nmore positive light on support received. Taken together,\nthese findings on obligation and importance suggest that\ndiscrepancies between parents and children in their percep-\ntions of support given and received have to do with feelings\nthey have about the relationship. As at other points in the\nlife course, it may be that subjective beliefs about the rela-\ntionship may differ between parents and children and lead\nto discrepancies in perceptions.\nIn contrast to these psychological dimensions, needs and\nresources of parents and children did not consistently\npredict the discrepancies. Prior studies that reported the\neffects of needs and resources on discrepancies (Lin, 2008;\nShapiro, 2004) did not take into account psychological fac-\ntors, such as obligation and importance. Our finding shows\nthat while needs and resources affect level of exchanges,\nsubjective beliefs are more important for understanding\nhow people perceive the exchanges.\nDyadic characteristics of the parent\u00adchild dyad were also\nnot significant predictors of discrepancies, with the excep-\ntion of coresidence. For upward exchanges of child to parent,\nchildren who live with parents reported giving more\nsupport than parents reported receiving. Coresidence may\nin many cases come about because parents need more\nsupport. Children in that situation may be more attuned to\ngiving assistance, though parents may still want to see\nthemselves as independent.\nSome limitations of the study need to be considered.\nFirst, though the use of information from multiple reporters\noffers a unique opportunity to look at the correspondence of\nthe reports between parents and children, the parents who\nagreed to participate in this survey may be more likely to\nhave better relationships with their children than those par-\nents who did not participate. Second, we can only identify\ndiscrepancies, but not how the discrepancies are related to\nthe amount of the actual exchanges. How family members\nperceive exchanges, however, will be more important for\nthe overall quality of their relationships than the actual\namounts of support given and received.\nThese findings confirm and expand upon prior research\nthat demonstrated discrepancies between parents and their\nmiddle-aged children in the amount of support given and\nreceived. Discrepancies are a potential source of misunder-\nstanding and conflict within families and may condition the\nresponse when either parents or their children need extensive\nhelp for health or social problems. Of particular note is that\nthe reasons for discrepancies differ by generation. Intervention\nfor families that face major challenges like caregiving may\nneed to take into account the differences in how parents and\nchildren view the support and assistance they give to one\nanother, and the different reasons for these discrepancies. It\nwill be important for future research to examine the effects of\ndiscrepancies on future exchanges and other aspects of family\nrelationships over time.\nFunding\nto K.L.F.) and the MacArthur Network on Transitions to Adulthood (K99\nCorrespondence\nCorrespondence should be addressed to Kyungmin Kim, MA, Department\nof Human Development and Family Studies, Pennsylvania State Uni-\nReferences\nBarnett, R.
