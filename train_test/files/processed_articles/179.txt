Biochem Biophys Acta 1115:\nAssessment of\nInsulin Sensitivity\nFrom a Single\nSample\nComparison of homeostasis\nmodel assessment (HOMA) and\nLn(HOMA) with minimal model\nanalysis\nAssessment of insulin sensitivity pro-\nvides a basic understanding about\ncommon metabolic disorders. Vari-\nous methods have been proposed to eval-\nuate insulin sensitivity in vivo. The eugly-\ncemic clamp study and minimal-model\nanalysis (MINMOD) are the standard\nmethods of estimating insulin sensitivity,\nbut the procedures are rather complex and\nexpensive (1\u00ad3). There is a need for sim-\nple indexes that assess insulin sensitivity\nfrom a single sample at diabetes clinics\nand in large-population studies. The\ninsulin resistance index assessed by home-\nostasis model assessment defined as the\nproduct of fasting plasma insulin and glu-\ncose divided by 22.5 (HOMA-IR) is an\nestimation of insulin sensitivity from a sin-\ngle sample (4). Matthews et al. (4) demon-\nstrated that HOMA-IR is closely correlated\nwith insulin resistance index assessed by\neuglycemic clamp (clamp IR) in type 2\ndiabetic patients. This estimation is suit-\nable for large-population studies. Very\nrecently, Emoto at al. (5) and Bonora et al.\n(6) also reported that HOMA-IR and log-\ntransformed HOMA-IR (Ln[Homa]) pro-\nvided a good correlation in the clamp\nstudies. In the present study, we applied\nMINMOD during frequently sampled\nintravenous glucose tolerance tests to\ncompare the estimates of insulin sensitiv-\nity with HOMA-IR and Ln(HOMA).\nWe examined 103 Japanese subjects\nwith normal glucose tolerance (NGT),\nimpaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and type 2\ndiabetes to assess insulin sensitivity. Glu-\ncose intolerance was diagnosed based on\nthe criteria of the World Health Organiza-\ntion (7). The BMI of the subjects with NGT,\ntively. MINMOD-derived insulin sensitivity\nindex (SI) was estimated as previously\ndescribed (8\u00ad10). The statistical analysis\nwas performed with the StatView 5 system\n(Berkeley, CA).\nWe observed a significant correlation\nbetween HOMA-IR and MINMOD SI in all\nof the subjects examined in this study (r =\ntion suggested a hyperbolic relationship\nbetween HOMA-IR and SI, we also ana-\nlyzed the correlation of Ln(HOMA) with SI.\nLn(HOMA) correlated more strongly with\nMINMOD SI than did HOMA-IR per se (r =\nson why HOMA-IR and Ln(HOMA) show\ndifferences in correlation coefficients, we\nanalyzed the relationship of HOMA-IR and\nLn(HOMA) with SI across the range of\nHOMA-IR. We divided the subjects into 3\ngroups according to the HOMA-IR values\nrelationship of HOMA-IR and Ln(HOMA)\nwith MINMOD SI is shown in Table 1.\nThere was only a slight difference between\nthe correlation coefficients of HOMA-IR\nand Ln(HOMA) with MINMOD SI when\nonly a slight difference between the correla-\ntion coefficients of HOMA-IR and\nLn(HOMA) with MINMOD SI when the\ntrast with HOMA-IR values 1 and from 1\nto 2, the correlation coefficient becomes\nhigher and the P value becomes significant\nwhen HOMA-IR is log-transformed in sub-\nIR value is a product of blood glucose and\ninsulin levels, it is possible that the estimates\nare slightly exaggerated and the values are\nscattered to a wide range, compared with\nthe standard estimates MINMOD SI when\nthe metabolic status of each individual\nincreases both glucose and insulin levels.\nThere is a frequent need of assessing\ninsulin sensitivity for clinicians during the\ndiet, exercise, and/or drug therapy. In addi-\ntion, HOMA-IR is a widespread index of\ninsulin sensitivity and a simplified evalua-\ntion without exaggeration as a number is\nTable 1--Comparison of HOMA-IR and Ln(HOMA) with MINMOD SI\nAll subjects HOMA-IR1 1HOMA-IR2 2HOMA-IR\nHOMA\nData are correlation coefficients (r) and P values (P) of HOMA-IR and Ln(HOMA) compared with MIN-\nMOD-derived SI.\nLetters\nnecessary (11,12).

Diabetes Care 23:\nPrevalence of\nGlucose Intolerance\nAmong Malays\nin Brunei\nIn newly industrialized countries, dra-\nmatic changes in economy and lifestyle\nmay result in changed eating habits,\nreduced physical activity, and increased fre-\nquency of obesity. These changes appear to\nlead to metabolic abnormalities, such as\nglucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, dys-\nlipidemia, hypertension, and obesity. As a\nconsequence, type 2 diabetes, heart disease,\nand stroke have become major causes of\nmortality in many of these countries (1).\nIn Brunei (North Borneo), the socioe-\nconomic development and the increase in\nwealth over the last 3 decades have led to\nrapid modernization processes. During\nthis time, Bruneians, particularly the ethnic\ngroup of Malays who constitute the major-\nity (75%) of the population, have adapted\nto an affluent lifestyle resulting from West-\nern influences. Among other things, this\nnew lifestyle has been characterized by a\nchange in diet and very little exercise.\nPrevious publications have indicated\nthat a relatively high prevalence of glucose\nintolerance correlates with the level of\nsocial development in this area. In West\nMalaysia, Malays with an urban lifestyle\nhave been reported to show a considerably\nhigher prevalence of type 2 diabetes com-\npared with Malays living a more rural way\nwise, Malays in Singapore showed a rela-\ntively high prevalence of type 2 diabetes\ntively) (3). These observations emphasized\nthe need for assessing the risk of glucose\nintolerance among Bruneian Malays.\nWe performed an oral glucose toler-\nance test on 100 randomly chosen\nselection criteria were ethnic origin and age,\nwhereas the exclusion criteria were preg-\nnancy, cancer, treatment with oral steroids,\nrecent surgery, and recent serious illness.\nVenous blood (10\u00ad20 ml) was collected just\nbefore the glucose challenge (75 g glu-\nmin afterward. Using the diagnostic criteria\nof the World Health Organization and the\nNational Diabetes Data Group, we classified\neach subject as having normal glucose tol-\nerance, impaired glucose tolerance, or type 2\ndiabetes. Serum insulin levels were mea-\nsured with an immunoradiometric assay\nnot susceptible for proinsulin cross-reactiv-\nity (Medgenis, Fleurus, Belgium), and\nserum C-peptide measurements were\ndetermined with a radioimmunoassay (Bio-\nlab/Serone, Milan, Italy). Statistical analysis\nof the insulin and C-peptide response to\noral glucose was based on one-way analysis\nof variance with repeated measurements\nfollowed by post hoc Tukey's test.\nWe observed that 13.5% of the total\ngroup was impaired glucose tolerant and\n6.5% was type 2 diabetic. Only the dia-\nbetic subjects showed increased fasting\nserum insulin and C-peptide levels. How-\never, both diabetic and impaired glucose-\ntolerant subjects revealed a delayed insulin\nand C-peptide response to oral glucose\nand a significantly prolonged exposure to\nelevated serum insulin and C-peptide lev-\nels during the 2-h testing period. The\nprevalence of glucose intolerance in rela-\nIn addition, we determined weight,\nheight, waist and hip circumference, and\nfat distribution based on bicep, tricep, sub-\nscapular, and suprailium skin-fold mea-\nsurements with a caliper. Anthropometric\nLetters\nclassification of the subjects according to\nthe percentage of body fat (%BF) indicated\nthat 54% of all male subjects and 96% of\nall female subjects were overweight or\nobese. Alternatively, classification accord-\ning to BMI revealed that 53% of all men\nand 56% of all women were overweight\nof the women who were classified as over-\nweight or obese based on %BF showed a\nBMI 25 kg/m2. Of all female subjects,\ncombination of a relatively high %BF and a\nhigh waist-to-hip ratio has been shown to\nbe related to upper body obesity, which is\nconsidered a major risk factor linked to dia-\nbetes and cardiovascular disease (4). The\nspecific phenomenon of too much central\nbody fat, even in women with a BMI 25\nkg/m2, has been found in Vietnamese (5)\nand Chinese (6) women as well.\nThis cross-sectional study represents\nthe first population-based data collection\non the prevalence of glucose intolerance\namong the Malay inhabitants of Brunei, and\nit indicates a high frequency of type 2 dia-\nbetes and impaired glucose tolerance.\nAlthough we cannot exclude a predisposi-\ntion for glucose intolerance in Bruneian\nMalays, environmental factors, such as diet\nand physical activity, might contribute to\nthe development of a multifactorial disease\nsuch as type 2 diabetes.

All\npatients with type 2 diabetes hospitalized in\nthe internal medicine wards of one hospital\nduring one month were candidates for\ninclusion in the study, regardless of the rea-\nson for hospitalization. Of these patients,\n165 were suitable and agreed to be inter-\nviewed and to undergo funduscopic exami-\nnation. The patients were asked if they\nknew about possible ocular involvement in\ndiabetes and if they ever underwent oph-\nthalmologic evaluation. All had a dilated\nfundus examination.

Although it has been\nshown that diabetic Japanese-Brazilian\nage who were analyzed in the Japanese-\nBrazilian Study Group of Bauru City, S\u00e3o\nPaulo, Brazil (1), had a smaller mean BMI\nthan the nondiabetic Brazilian population\n(2), they had a higher prevalence of dia-\nbetes (18%) than the the overall age-\nmatched Brazilian population (7.6%) (3).\nIn the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes,\ninstead of obesity affecting both insulin\nsecretion and insulin resistance, we know\nthat obesity may vary the relative impor-\ntance of insulin deficiency and insulin\nresistance in different ethnic groups (4).\nTo compare diabetes in Japanese-\nBrazilians with type 2 diabetes in non-\nJapanese Brazilians, we evaluated anthropo-\nmetric data, fasting plasma glucose mea-\nsurements (glucose oxidase method), total\nplasma insulin levels with a radioim-\nmunoassay (RIA) kit (Insulin-CT; CIS Bio\nInternational, Cedex, France), -cell func-\ntion with the homeostasis model assess-\nment (HOMA) ([20  insulin (\u00b5U/ml)/\nglucose (mmol/l) \u00ad 3.5]), and insulin resis-\ntance (HOMA-IR) ([insulin (\u00b5U/ml)  glu-\ncose (mmol/l)/ 22.5]) applied to fasting\ninsulin/glucose pairs in each individual.\nThe GAD65 autoantibodies were measured\nin the fasting serum by an RIA procedure\nusing a commercial reagent kit that used\nSan Clemente, CA).\nThese variables were studied in a sam-\nple of 49 Japanese-Brazilians with dia-\nbetes, 50 Japanese-Brazilians without dia-\nbetes, 47 non-Japanese Brazilians with\ntype 2 diabetes, and 45 non-Japanese\nBrazilians without diabetes.\nThe Ethics Committee of the S\u00e3o\nPaulo Hospital of S\u00e3o Paulo Federal Uni-\nversity approved the study. The classifica-\ntion of the patients and the control sub-\njects was in accordance with World Health\nOrganization criteria (5).\nAll groups were of the same age range\n(40\u00ad67 years).

Some of these patients have an abrupt\nonset of disease, whereas others have a\nslower onset that seems to represent insulin\nnecessity but not insulin dependence.\nThe HOMA score explores the sponta-\nneous homeostatic characteristics of a\nmetabolic system by inferring the degree\nof -cell function and insulin sensitivity\nthat is compatible with a particular blood\nglucose level. Although this method has\nsome limitations, comparing -cell func-\ntion and insulin resistance by HOMA is\nadvantageous when individuals have simi-\nlar basal fasting glucose levels (6).\nOur patients, diabetic Japanese Brazil-\nians and type 2 diabetic non-Japanese\nBrazilians, were age-matched (median 57\n40\u00ad65, respectively), they were within the\nsame range of metabolic control (fasting\n3.0 mmol\\l), and their times of clinical\ndiagnosis of diabetes were similar (median\nThe degree of HOMA-IR in type 2 dia-\nbetic non-Japanese Brazilians was higher\nthan that in their matched control sub-\njects, nondiabetic non-Japanese Brazilians.\nOn the other hand, as a total group, it was\nfound that the degree of HOMA-IR was\nsimilar in diabetic Japanese Brazilians and\nnondiabetic Japanese Brazilians. This simi-\nlarity also persists when taking their BMI\ninto account. However, intragroup analy-\nsis shows that the rise in BMI was associ-\nated with an increase in HOMA-IR only in\nthe diabetic cohorts, type 2 diabetic non-\nJapanese Brazilians, and diabetic Japanese\nBrazilians. These data reinforce that, in\nboth diabetic groups, obesity is only one\nfactor among others, such as hypergly-\ncemia, that is responsible for the difference\nin the insulin resistance level between dia-\nbetic and healthy nondiabetic individuals\nwhen they become obese.\nWhen this study was performed, as\nexpected in a clinical phase of diabetes, the\ndiabetic Japanese-Brazilian and the type 2\ndiabetic non-Japanese\u00adBrazilian groups\nhad lower -cell function in comparison\nwith their matched control groups, nondi-\nabetic non-Japanese Brazilians and nondia-\nbetic Japanese Brazilians, respectively.\nThe 3 Japanese-Brazilian healthy con-\ntrol subjects who were GAD65 autoanti-\nbody\u00adpositive had no diabetic first-degree\nrelatives and they were without autoim-\nmune disease. Therefore, without conduct-\ning follow-ups, we are unable to explain\nthis unexpected positivity to GAD65\nautoantibodies in these subjects.\nThe mean positivity for GAD65 auto-\nantibodies in type 2 diabetic non-Japanese\nBrazilians was 5.9%, which is similar to\nfindings of many studies of the literature\ntype of diabetes.\nInterestingly, we found an inverse asso-\nciation in the entire Japanese-Brazilian\ngroup between the tendency of reduction of\nthe -cell function and the titers of GAD65\nautoantibodies. The group of GAD65 autoan-\ntibody\u00adpositive individuals had lower levels\nof -cell function than the GAD65 autoan-\ntibody\u00adnegative individuals (P  0.05).\nWhen we performed a backward\nstepwise regression analysis of all of the\nindividuals included in the 4 study\ngroups, by considering the -cell function\nas the dependent variable and through the\ncombination of the variables, we could\npredict in the diabetic Japanese-Brazilian\ngroup GAD65-autoantibody titers (r =\nIn the type 2 diabetic non-Japanese\u00adBrazil-\nian group, though, only the time of dia-\nbetes diagnosis could be predicted (r =\nIn conclusion, these results show that,\nin comparison with non-Japanese Brazilian\nadults with type 2 diabetes, the Japanese-\nBrazilian individuals with diabetes showed\nthe same prevalence of GAD65, similar\ninsulin resistance, and similar -cell func-\ntion. In this sample of 40- to 67-year-old\nJapanese Brazilians, the individuals with\ndiabetes showed a lesser degree of -cell\nfunction once they had the same degree of\ninsulin resistance as their matched control\nsubjects. We can speculate that in the\nJapanese-Brazilian group, the GAD65 anti-\nbody levels, as well as the time of diagnosis\nof diabetes, is a factor that could be related\nto low -cell function.\nFrom the Divisions of Endocrinology (A.P.A.F\n.,\nD.L.M.B, S.A.D.) and Clinical Preventive Medi-\ncine (L.J.F\n.), Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o\nPaulo, Brazil.\nAddress correspondence to Sergio Atala Dib,\nMD, PhD, Disciplina de Endocrinologia, Escola\nPaulista de Medicina\u00adUNIFESP, Rua Botucatu, 740-\nE-mail: sadib@endocrino.epm.br.\nAcknowledgments -- This study was sup-\nported by grants from the National Council\nfor Scientific and Technological Development\nand Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e1 Pesquisa do\nEstado de S\u00e3o Paulo.\nReferences\n1.

Stumvoll et al.\n(3) recently disclosed that the oral glu-\ncose tolerance test (OGTT) can assess\ninsulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in\nnondiabetic subjects when compared\nwith the results derived from the eugly-\ncemic and hyperglycemic clamp studies.\nMoreover, they concluded that insulin\nsensitivity from euglycemic clamp proce-\ndure was best correlated with the meta-\nbolic clearance rate of insulin (MCR) and\nthe insulin sensitivity index (ISI) pre-\ndicted from the OGTT-derived equations.\nIn addition, they confirmed that the ISI\n(composite) proposed by Matsuda and\nhomeostasis model assessment insulin\nresistance (HOMA-IR) shown by Matthews\net al. (5) were also correlated to eugly-\ncemic clamp\u00adderived insulin sensitivity\nin nondiabetic subjects. On the other\nhand, -cell function derived from the\nhyperglycemic clamp method was best\ncorrelated with values predicted by equa-\ntions from the OGTT followed by area\nunder the curve (AUC) Ins/AUC Gluc,\nproposed by Matthews et al. (5), and\nedge, the validity of the OGTT to evaluate\ninsulin sensitivity and insulin secretion\nhas not yet been investigated in diabetic\nsubjects. To accomplish this, we calcu-\nlated insulin sensitivity and insulin secre-\ntion from the results of the OGTT and\nthen compared them with those obtained\nfrom the minimal-model approach in the\nJapanese diabetic populations.\nThere were 25 nonobese type 2 dia-\nbetic patients who participated in the\nstudy, after provision of informed con-\nTheir HbA1c\ndiagnosed based on the criteria of the\nWorld Health Organization (6).

None of the participants in\nthis study consumed alcohol or per-\nformed heavy exercise for at least 1 week\nbefore the test. For at least 3 days before\nthe test, their body weight was stable.\nAll subjects had ingested at least 150 g\ncarbohydrate for the 3 days preceding\nthe study.\nAfter an overnight fast, a butterfly\nneedle was inserted into the antecubital\nvein and maintained by a slow drip of\nphysiological saline.

The samples were obtained from\nthe contralateral antecubital vein at fre-\nquent intervals until 180 min as previ-\nously described (7). Plasma was frozen\nand stored at 20\u00b0C for subsequent\nanalysis. The subjects' plasma glucose\nlevels were measured in duplicate with an\nautomatic analyzer (Kyoto-Daiichi-\nKagaku, Kyoto, Japan) by the glucose\noxidase method. Immunoreactive insulin\nwas assayed in duplicate in using a\nPhadeseph insulin radioimmunoassay kit\n(Shionogi, Osaka, Japan). Insulin sensi-\ntivity was estimated by the minimal-\nmodel approach (1,7). Insulin secretion\nwas expressed as the area under the\ninsulin curve between 0 and 10 min after\nan intravenous glucose injection. The\nintegrated area of plasma insulin above\nbasal level was calculated using the trape-\nzoidal method (8). The statistical analysis\nwas performed with the StatView 5 sys-\ntem (StatView, Berkeley, CA). Pearson lin-\near regression analysis and analysis of\nvariance determined correlation. P \n0.05 was considered significant.\nISI obtained from the minimal-model\napproach was best correlated with the ISI\nour type 2 diabetic patients. On the other\nhand, insulin secretion during intravenous\nglucose tolerance test was best correlated\npatients. From these results, it may be con-\ncluded that our nonobese Japanese type 2\ndiabetic patients can estimate insulin sensi-\ntivity and insulin secretion from the results\nduring the OGTT.

New\nAssessment of\nInsulin Secretion\nFrom the Oral\nGlucose Tolerance\nTest in White\nPatients With\nType 2 Diabetes\nWe have recently proposed a method\nto assess insulin sensitivity and\ninsulin secretion using the oral glu-\ncose tolerance test (OGTT) in nondiabetic\nsubjects (including those subjects with\nimpaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) (1). The\neuglycemic-hyperinsulinemic and the\nhyperglycemic clamp technique validated\nthe models, respectively. In the letter by\nTaniguchi et al. (2), the idea was extended to\ninclude Japanese subjects with type 2 dia-\nbetes. Their models were validated by the\nminimal model approach (3). They found\nthat insulin sensitivity was best predicted\nby insulin sensitivity index composite\n(4) and insulin secretion by (Ins30\n)/\n). We applied the analogous\nmethodology to determine if insulin secre-\ntion as measured by the hyperglycemic\nclamp can be estimated from the OGTT in\nwhite patients with type 2 diabetes.\nAfter obtaining informed written con-\nsent from the subjects, we studied 28 white\npatients with type 2 diabetes (World Health\nOrganization criteria [5]) using the OGTT\nmin) as previously described (1). Their age\ninsulin 88 \u00b1 9 pmol/l. Plasma insulin was\ndetermined by radioimmunoassay (Pharma-\ncia, Piscataway, NJ) or microparticle enzyme\nimmunoassay (Abbott Laboratories, Tokyo),\nand plasma glucose was determined using a\nglucose analyzer (YSI, Yellow Springs, OH,\nor HemoCue, Aengelholm, Sweden). Indi-\nvidual phases of insulin secretion were deter-\nmined as previously described (1). In brief,\nthe first-phase insulin secretion was consid-\nered to be the sum of plasma insulin concen-\nhyperglycemic clamp experiment minus the\nmean basal plasma insulin concentration,\nand the second-phase insulin secretion was\ntaken as the average plasma insulin concen-\ntration during the last hour of the hypergly-\ncemic clamp minus the mean basal plasma\ninsulin concentration.\nSimple and stepwise multiple linear\nregression was performed with first- and\nsecond-phase insulin release as the depen-\ndent variables and demographic parame-\nters and glucose and insulin concentra-\ntions during the OGTT. The homeostasis\nmodel assessment (HOMA) secretion\nindex was calculated as Ins0\n 3.5) (6).

The authors investigated to\ndetermine if serum levels of advanced gly-\ncation end products (AGEs) and the gly-\ncoxidation product N-(carboxymethyl)-\nlysine (CML) are increased in subjects with\ntype 2 diabetes when compared with non-\ndiabetic control subjects, and whether lev-\nels of AGEs and CML differed in their\ncohort of 53 subjects with type 2 diabetes\nwhen coronary heart disease (CHD) was\npresent or absent. Levels of AGEs and CML\nwere significantly increased in patients with\ntype 2 diabetes compared with control sub-\njects. Moreover, AGEs were significantly\nhigher in subjects with type 2 diabetes with\nassociated CHD than in subjects with type 2\ndiabetes without CHD. The authors suggest\nthat AGEs may be involved in the develop-\nment of CHD in this population. Although\nthis is plausible, we feel that the methods\nused to screen for the presence of CHD in\nthis study are not sufficiently sensitive to\ndiscriminate between the presence or\nabsence of CHD in this population.\nThis last conclusion is based on the\ncapacity to evaluate accurately the presence\nof CHD in subjects with type 2 diabetes (2).\nAt baseline, the investigators diagnosed\nCHD on the basis of the following: 1) clini-\ncal examination and medical history of\nangina pectoris or myocardial infarction, 2)\nresting electrocardiogram (ECG) measure-\nments, and 3) exercise ECG measurements.\nDuring follow-up (median 5 years), CHD\nwas diagnosed solely according to resting\nECG measurements and new symptoms\nsuggestive of angina pectoris. No exercise\nECG was performed. The total number of\npatients with CHD corresponded to the\naddition of subjects at baseline and at fol-\nlow-up. Unfortunately, the authors did not\nprovide the number of new cases of CHD.\nIt is well known that diabetes is associ-\nated with silent ischemia (2,3), and sub-\njects with type 2 diabetes can often have a\nnormal resting ECG and still have suffered\na previous myocardial infarction. Further-\nmore, exercise testing and/or cardiac-imag-\ning techniques should be used to detect\nsilent ischemia without symptoms or exer-\ncise ECG ST segment changes (3\u00ad6). In the\nsame issue of Diabetes Care, Janand-\nDelenne et al. (7) have effectively demon-\nstrated that a significant number (21%) of\npatients with type 2 diabetes, with the\nabsence of clinical or ECG symptoms sug-\ngestive of CHD, had significant (50%)\nangiographic lesions. Moreover, 50% of\nthe subjects with type 2 diabetes were con-\nsidered ineligible for exercise testing, thus\nputting even more emphasis on the imag-\ning technique to properly unmask the\npresence of CHD in this population (3,7).\nIn summary, the absence of exercise\ntesting and/or cardiac imaging to detect\nCHD at follow-up make problematic the\nsuggestion that AGEs were higher in the\npatients with diabetes with CHD. There-\nfore, the importance of AGEs in the patho-\nphysiology of CHD in subjects with type 2\ndiabetes needs to be revisited.\nFrom the Cardiac Rehabilitation Program (P.P.),\nQuebec Heart Institute/Laval Hospital, Ste Foy,\nQu\u00e9bec, Canada; and the Lipid/Obesity Clinic\n(R.H.E.), University of Colorado Health Sciences\nCenter, Denver, Colorado.\nAddress correspondence to Paul Poirier, MD,\nFRCPC, Cardiac Rehabilitation Program, Qu\u00e9bec\nHeart Institute/Laval Hospital, 2725 Chemin Ste-Foy,\nSte-Foy, PQ, Canada G1V 4G5.

The diagnostic procedures for\ncoronary heart disease (CHD) in the pres-\nent study probably underestimate the num-\nber of patients with coronary atherosclero-\nsis.

Diabetes Care\nIs Testing Children\nfor Type 2 Diabetes\na Lost Battle?\nThe American Diabetes Association\nrecently issued a consensus statement\non type 2 diabetes in children (1).\nAlthough the consensus panel acknowl-\nedges that there are insufficient data to\nmake evidence-based recommendations,\nit also recommends testing for type 2 dia-\nbetes in children 10 years of age who are\noverweight and have at least 2 other risk\nfactors. Risk factors include the following:\n1) having a family history of type 2 dia-\nbetes in first- or second-degree relatives,\n2) belonging to certain race or ethnic\ngroups, and 3) having signs or conditions\nassociated with insulin resistance, e.g.,\nacanthosis nigricans, hypertension, dys-\nlipidemia, or polycystic ovary syndrome.\nFasting plasma glucose is the preferred test.\nWe assessed the implications of the\npanel's recommendation and used data\nfrom the third National Health and Nutri-\ntion Examination Survey (2) to estimate\nthe number of U.S. adolescents who\nwould qualify for testing as recom-\nmended. Fasting serum glucose was mea-\nage without known diabetes.\nage were overweight and had at least 2 of\nthe other risk factors (3\u00ad5) (Table 1). Thus,\n2.5 million adolescents would potentially\nqualify for type 2 diabetes testing.\nAmong those who met the criteria for\ning glucose (IFG) or undiagnosed dia-\nbetes, all in addition to being overweight.\nBecause of the small number of cases, we\ncould not estimate the number of adoles-\ncents with diabetes, but we still can use\nthe survey sample to illustrate these fig-\nwho met the criteria for testing. Within\nthat group of 199, 1 adolescent had undi-\nagnosed diabetes (fasting glucose 7\nmmol/l) and 4 others had IFG (6\nmmol/l). None of the 882 adolescents who\ndid not meet the criteria for testing were\ndiagnosed with diabetes, but 16 had IFG.\nThe recommendations for testing chil-\ndren for type 2 diabetes lead to testing a\nvery large number of children, while offer-\ning a rather small yield, due to the low\nprevalence of diabetes. To make matters\npotentially worse, we underestimated the\nnumber to test. Acanthosis nigricans, poly-\ncystic ovary syndrome, and family history\nin second-degree relatives for children 17\nyears of age were not assessed in the survey,\nchildren 10\u00ad11 years of age did not have\nglucose measured, and we did not consider\nhigh triglyceride and low HDL cholesterol\nlevels. In addition, although it is likely that\nthe prevalence of type 2 diabetes in chil-\nprevalence of most of these risk factors\nprobably followed a similar trend.\nIt is well demonstrated that type 2 dia-\nbetes is a devastating disease with lifelong\ncomplications and control efforts are badly\nneeded, especially for children (6). Rather\nthan challenging the need for testing chil-\ndren whose clinical features strongly sug-\ngest type 2 diabetes, the figures we present\nhere highlight at least the need for refining\nthe criteria for case finding in general.\nEfforts at early detection may, however,\nnot be cost-effective, and may divert\nresources away from more important and\ncost-effective interventions.\nFrom the Division of Diabetes Translation, Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.\nAddress correspondence to Anne Fagot-Cam-\npagna, MD, Division of Diabetes Translation, Cen-\nters for Disease Control and Prevention, 4770\nE-mail: adf8@cdc.gov.\nReferences\n1.

J Pediatr\nIs Testing Children\nfor Type 2 Diabetes\na Lost Battle?\nResponse to Fagot-Campagna et al.\nFagot-Campagna et al. (1) opine that the\nrecently published American Diabetes\nAssociation (ADA) consensus panel\nrecommendations on testing children at\nrisk for type 2 diabetes will lead to massive\novertesting, and they indicate that criteria\nfor better case-finding need to be refined.\nThe consensus report did, in fact, note that\nschool or community-based studies should\nbe carried out to demonstrate the value of\nindividual tests and to establish the strength\nand risk level of various factors that might\nbe influential in the development of type 2\ndiabetes. It was also emphasized that the\nstudies should be carried out in popula-\ntions with sufficient numbers of children\nwho are at high risk. This would also pro-\nvide an indication of the frequency of undi-\nagnosed type 2 diabetes in children, which\nis presently unknown outside certain\nNative American groups.\nThe data provided by Fagot-Cam-\npagna et al. (1) neither detract from the\nrecommendations of the consensus panel\nnor suggest alternatives. The data are diffi-\ncult to accept as representative or sufficient\nto derive the estimates that are provided.\nEven though the consensus panel rec-\nommendations on case-finding recognize\nthe need for a population-based study of\ntheir application, their immediate value\nand importance is to emphasize to the\nclinician the importance of testing chil-\ndren who have the noted risk factors. In\nfact, Fagot-Campagna et al. (1) state that\nthey do not challenge the need for testing\nchildren whose clinical features strongly\nsuggest type 2 diabetes. This is consistent\nwith the recommendations regarding the\nidentification of cardiovascular risk factors\nin obese children, as suggested by their\ncolleagues at the Division of Nutrition and\nPhysical Activity at the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (2). The most\nimportant reason for placing these recom-\nmendations before the public is to com-\nmunicate an awareness of the risk factors\nand the need to test those at risk.\nThe ADA consensus panel chose to\nnot make its recommendations restrictive\nby suggesting that clinical judgment\nshould be used to test patients who may\nnot meet these criteria. The criteria were:\noverweight (BMI 85th percentile for age\nand sex, weight for height 85th per-\ncentile, or weight 120% of ideal for\nheight) plus two other risk factors--family\nhistory of type 2 diabetes in first- or sec-\nond-degree relative; American Indian,\nAfrican-American, Hispanic, or Asian/Pacific\nIslander ethnicity; or signs of insulin resis-\ntance or conditions associate with insulin\nresistance such as acanthosis nigricans,\nhypertension, dyslipidemia, or PCOS. It\nwas recommended that testing begin at 10\nyears or at the onset of puberty if earlier,\nwith a frequency of every 2 years, and the\npreferred test was the fasting plasma glu-\ncose measurement. This is hardly a pre-\nscription for rampant overtesting.\nThe importance of the clinical judg-\nment disclaimer is emphasized by the last\n10 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes\nin our clinic. None had symptoms of dia-\nbetes. Five were under 10 years of age, 6\nwere white, and 4 had only one other risk\nfactor besides obesity (a family history of\ntype 2 diabetes) that resulted in their being\ntested. The rest were diagnosed because of\nthe incidental finding of glucosuria in 2\npatients, which was found while being\nstudied for vaginitis or dysuria (J.H. Silver-\nstein, personal communication). Such early\ndetection by alerting primary practitioners\nholds the promise of forestalling complica-\ntions, which appear to be particularly accel-\nerated in this patient group, and preventing\nhospitalization or death from hyperosmolar\nnonketotic coma.\nTesting children for type 2 diabetes is\nmost assuredly not a losing battle. Recog-\nnizing that children and adolescents with\ntype 2 diabetes are frequently asympto-\nmatic, case-finding in the at-risk population\nshould be considered good practice.\nFrom the Children's Medical Services Center and\nthe University of Florida College of Medicine,\nGainesville, Florida.\nAddress correspondence to Arlan L.

In their study,\nGary et al. (4) reported that behavioral fac-\ntors (e.g., diet, exercise, and self-monitor-\ning behavior) did not explain the relation-\nship between the Center for Epidemiologic\nStudies-Depression scale (CES-D)-assessed\ndepressive symptoms and metabolic con-\ntrol. They offered a possible explanation for\nthe observed relationship: that it might be\nLetters\nmanifested via a causal pathway that is\nindependent of behavioral factors (4).\nOther investigators have also suggested\nthat behavioral factors cannot fully explain\nthe relationship between stress, depres-\nsion, and metabolic control (6\u00ad9).\nMost recently, Mooy et al. (10)\nreported a significant association between\nstressful life events and prevalence of\nundetected type 2 diabetes in a popula-\ntion-based study. We take particular inter-\nest in this study because of our own obser-\nvations among a population-based sample\nof Native Hawaiians (11). We reported that\nCES-D\u00adassessed depressive symptoms\nwere associated with glycemic control,\neven after patients with a prior diagnosis of\ndiabetes were excluded from analysis (11).\nThe exclusion of patients with prior diag-\nnoses of diabetes in both of these studies\nsuggests that neither behavioral factors,\nsuch as treatment compliance, nor psycho-\nlogical reaction to a chronic condition can\nfully explain these associations. Further-\nmore, longitudinal studies have demon-\nstrated that depressive symptoms and\ndepression may increase the risk of devel-\nOur observations and those of Mooy\net al. agree with the theory by Bjorntorp et\nal. (9) that stressful life events or chronic\npsychological stress are associated with\nglucose intolerance. Several biological\nmechanisms have been posited to explain\nthe association. For example, depressive\ndisorders are associated with disruption\nof the sympathoadrenal system and dis-\nregulation of the hypothalamopituitary\nadrenal axis, each of which may impair\ncarbohydrate uptake, thereby leading to\nincreased blood glucose and glucose\nintolerance. Alternatively, glucose intoler-\nance and/or insulin resistance may cause\nchanges in the neuroendocrine system\nthat subsequently affect perceived stress\nor mood-state. Elevated glucose levels\nmay cause a heightened state of arousal,\nwhich may be reported as stress or\ndepressive symptoms (e.g., fatigue or lack\nof concentration). Finally, depressive\nsymptoms and glucose intolerance may\nshare a common pathogenesis. Bjorntorp\net al. reported that a common polymor-\nphism of the glucocorticoid receptor gene\nwas associated with abdominal obesity,\ninsulin resistance, and hypertension.

(1) reported that lower\nlevels of education are associated with\nan increased risk for metabolic syndrome\nin middle-aged women. This result con-\nfirms recent reports suggesting the link\nbetween socioeconomic factors and car-\ndiovascular disease and diabetes or its late\ncomplications (2\u00ad4). Because prior gesta-\ntional diabetes mellitus (GDM) seems to\nbe associated with the components of the\nmetabolic syndrome, or even is a predic-\ntor of it (5,6), it may be of importance to\ngain some information about a similar\nrelationship between socioeconomic fac-\ntors and metabolic syndrome in women\nwith prior GDM.\nTo study the previously mentioned\nconnection, we analyzed follow-up data of\n71% of the patients were treated with\ninsulin during pregnancy), randomly\nselected from a cohort of women cared for\nby our interdisciplinary team between\nLetters\nwomen with GDM who were considered\nto be in need of special care were referred\nto our center. For the evaluation of meta-\nbolic syndrome, the same components\nand methods (dyslipidemia, central obe-\nsity, hypertension, glucose intolerance)\nwere used as in the study of Wamala et al.\n(1), although the exact definitions differed.\nHypertension, however, was defined as\nsubjects were on blood pressure\u00adlowering\nmedication and glucose intolerance as\nantidiabetic therapy or abnormal result of a\n75-g OGTT according to the World Health\nOrganization criteria (7). Socioeconomic\nstatus (SES) was measured by education\nlevel (primary school, high school, or col-\nlege/university), current employment, and\nmarital status, or according to permanent\nresidence (urban or rural).\nAt least 2 components of the meta-\nbolic syndrome were detected in 49\n(45%) women at follow-up (dyslipidemia\nwith lower education (P  0.01) or who\nwere unemployed (P  0.01) had a\nhigher risk for metabolic syndrome (uni-\nvariate comparisons); however, marital\nstatus and residence showed no signifi-\ncant connection to it. The age-adjusted\nodds ratio for metabolic syndrome was\nlowest and highest educational levels,\ncomparing unemployment with employ-\nment. In a multivariate analysis (logistic\nregression including age, education,\nemployment, and residence), only lower\neducation level (P  0.05) and unem-\nployment (P  0.05) entered the model\nas independent covariates.\nIn a homogenous cohort of relatively\nyoung women with prior GDM, an almost\n4-times-higher frequency of metabolic\nsyndrome was found in comparison to\nthe results of Wamala et al. (1). Because\nthe selection criteria for this study were\nrelated to the patients' metabolic state,\nthere is no reason to suppose that selec-\ntion bias occurred during analysis. Our\nresults not only confirm the results of\nWamala et al. found in healthy women,\nbut also suggest that a similar relationship\nexists in women with prior GDM (i.e.,\nlow education and unemployment might\nincrease the existing risk of women with\nGDM for metabolic syndrome) (1,5,6).\nScreening for GDM, follow-up, and care\nfor women later in life is therefore of\nutmost importance, especially in those\nwith lower SES to prevent clustering of\ncardiovascular risk factors.\nFrom the National Center for Diabetes Care (Zs.K.,\nA.Gy.T., P.S., Zs.B., Gy.T.), Fourth Department of\nMedicine, Szent Imre Hospital (Zs.K., P.S.),\nBudapest; the Medical Faculty (A.Gy.T., I.K., Gy.T.),\nFirst and Third Departments of Medicine, Semmel-\nweis University, Budapest; and Szent Gy\u00f6rgy Hospi-\ntal (K.S.), Second Department of Medicine,\nSz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, Hungary.\nAddress correspondence to Zsuzsa Ker\u00e9nyi, MD,\nPhD, National Center for Diabetes Care, Szent Imre\nHospital, Fourth Department of Medicine, Diabetes\ngary.

McGrath\nand Curran's (1) observations\nfrom New Zealand about the high\namputation rates in Maori people with\ndiabetes after they began dialysis. We had\nsimilar findings in our work to reduce dia-\nbetic foot complications in Native Ameri-\ncan communities in northern Minnesota.\nAs we instituted measures to identify and\nprotect diabetic community members\nwith high-risk feet, we saw amputation\ndiabetic person-years in the periods from\nduced treatment guidelines to stage, treat,\nand refer foot ulcers according to well-\ndefined clinical pathways called Staged\nDiabetes Management, and amputation\npreviously (2). When we reviewed our\nregistry of amputations, we realized that\nthe residual amputations largely occurred\namong those on dialysis.\nWe postulated that dialysis patients\noften lost contact with care outside the dial-\nysis setting. Preventive foot care, early\ndetection of foot problems, and follow-up\ncare for foot ulcers after hospitalization off-\nreservation were not always a part of rou-\ntine dialysis care. Accordingly, we instituted\nan outreach wound care clinic to follow\nthose who had been referred off-reservation\nfor management of severe foot ulcers, and\nwe extended these services to diabetic\npatients who were receiving dialysis in the\nlocal reservation facility. In the 3 years\nprogram, amputation rates decreased to\nThese observations also led us to ask if\nour experience was unique. Medicare hos-\npitalizations in which a lower-extremity\namputation was performed were used to\nassess non-traumatic lower-extremity\namputation in all Medicare end stage renal\ndisease patients (3). The overall amputa-\ntion rate for dialysis patients in the U.S.\nbeneficiaries with diabetes, the annualized\nLetters\nAmericans with diabetes had the highest\nrates. Among nondiabetic dialysis patients,\nAfrican-Americans experienced the highest\namputation rates. Thus, it appears that all\ndialysis patients, particularly those with\ndiabetes, are at very high risk for lower-\nextremity amputation.\nIn summary, we found that McGrath\nand Curran's (1) observations are consis-\ntent with ours. Dialysis patients with dia-\nbetes and those on dialysis for other rea-\nsons have both neuropathy and vascular\ndisease that predispose them to foot ulcers,\npoor wound healing, and the cascade of\nevents that lead to amputation. Foot care is\noften not a priority in settings that are busy\nproviding dialysis. When we recognized\nthe problem and extended foot care specif-\nically to the dialysis setting, we observed a\ndecrease in amputation rates in diabetic\ncommunity members. Diabetic individuals\nworldwide receiving renal replacement\ntherapy are at high risk for amputation and\nthe rates can be reduced with interventions\ndesigned to reach them.\nFrom the Indian Health Service (S.R.-N.), Bemidji;\nand the U.S. Public Health Service (D.G.)

Although nonmydriatic fundus pho-\ntography was widely used for screening of\ndiabetic retinopathy, less attention has\nbeen directed toward the correlation\nbetween asymmetric retinopathy (i.e., more\nadvanced retinopathy in one eye and no\nretinopathy in the other) and carotid artery\ndisease. Here, we are reporting on a diabetic\npatient with asymptomatic internal carotid\nartery (ICA) occlusion who presented with\nsignificantly asymmetric retinopathy found\nby nonmydriatic fundus photography in\nour routine screening clinic.\nA 59-year-old man with a known his-\ntory of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and\ndyslipidemia for 10 years was regularly\nfollowed up in our hospital. Routine\nscreening with nonmydriatic fundus pho-\ntography found asymmetric retinopathy\nwith hemorrhagic and cotton wool spots in\nthe left eye and no retinopathy in the right\neye ground.(Fig. 1). After noting this find-\ning, we asked the patient about possible\nneurological symptoms. Only mild vision\ndeterioration in the left eye was noted in\nthe past 10 days. Because it did not hinder\nhis daily life, he had not paid attention to\nthe condition. He denied any other motor,\nsensory, or visual disturbances.

We further performed a carotid ultra-\nsound examination, and found total occlu-\nsion of the left ICA and mild plaque in the\nright ICA (Fig. 2).

A compre-\nhensive program for people with both\ndiabetes and vision impairment enabled\nparticipants to master self-care skills,\nsuch as administration of insulin injec-\ntions and blood glucose monitoring (4\u00ad6).\nWe evaluated the outcomes of this program\nextended to a more diverse population over\nimpaired participants were referred to the\nSt. Louis University Health Sciences Cen-\nter. Diabetes educators specializing in\nadaptive diabetes techniques met with the\nindividuals to 1) assess visual function,\n2) evaluate and update general diabetes\nknowledge, and 3) assist in the selection of\nappropriate self-management devices. The\nnumber and content of the sessions varied\naccording to the level of preexisting dia-\nbetes knowledge and time needed for\nacquisition of self-care skills.\nAssessment of visual function was\nobtained from medical records as well as\nfrom direct questioning about the subjects\nability to read standard and large-print\nmaterials, their need for special lighting,\nand their ability to recognize large objects\nor subtle details. Before introducing adap-\ntive self-care skills, the educators provided\ninstructions in basic diabetes knowledge\nand self-care. Visual function and manual\ndexterity were taken into consideration\nwhen choosing the most appropriate adap-\ntive devices among the available options.\nAdaptive equipment included syringe\nmagnifiers, syringe loading devices, and\nglucose monitoring systems with speech\ncapability and tactile aids for proper\nblood sample placement (7\u00ad10). Subjects\nreturned for final follow-up after procuring\ntheir own equipment. Demonstration of\nproficient self-care technique was consid-\nered a successful outcome. The protocol\nwas approved by the Institutional Review\nBoard of St. Louis University.\nData were analyzed by nonpaired tests\nand one-way analysis of variance, with sub-\ngroup analysis performed by the method of\nthe Newmann-Keuls post hoc test. Compar-\nisons of proportions were performed by 2\ntests. All data are described as means \u00b1 SD.\nThere were 163 participants.

Five refused training, 1 had a\nstroke, and 1 was lost to follow-up. Those\nwho were successful were younger (53.9 \u00b1\n14.0 years of age) compared with those who\ndivided into quartiles by age distribution,\nthose in the highest quartile (66 years of\nage [53%]) were the least successful in mas-\nLetters\nwith late visual impairment had a poorer\nsuccess rate (57%) compared with those\nwith early visual impairment success rate of\nan overall trend for poorer success with\nboth advanced age and advanced visual\nBefore the program, 49 people were\nattempting to manage their diabetes by\nthemselves, 89 required the help of a fam-\nily member, and 18 required professional\nhome health care. The latter group, who\nwere predominantly in the fourth age\nquartile, had the poorest success rate.\nIn conclusion, this adaptive diabetes\neducation program demonstrated effective-\nness in restoring independent diabetes self-\ncare practices among a diverse population.\nThose individuals least likely to succeed\nwere the elderly with the most advanced\ndegree of vision impairment. Even so,\napproximately half of the elderly were able\nto complete the program successfully.\nYounger individuals with advanced stages\nof vision loss were less likely to be deterred.\nIndividuals with early visual impair-\nment were more successful in completing\nthe program, suggesting that reliance on\nremaining vision may have facilitated acqui-\nsition of self-care skills. Early intervention in\nthe course of vision loss may empower the\nindividual with confidence and self-reliance\nto maintain learned skills as the vision loss\nprogresses.\nNational standards for diabetes educa-\ntion do not emphasize rehabilitative train-\ning and self-care techniques (11,12). How-\never, an adaptive diabetes self-care program\nallows individuals the opportunity to par-\nticipate in their diabetes management with\nthe same expectations as their sighted peers\n(7,9). This leads not only to improved self-\nreliance and quality of life, but also allevi-\nates the burden on the family and the home\nhealth care system (13). With appropriate\ninstruction, independent self-care is possi-\nble for the majority of individuals, includ-\ning many elderly people and those with the\nseverest degrees of vision loss.\nAll diabetes educators should have an\nunderstanding of the resources available\nfor visually impaired patients. The cost of\nacquiring all necessary adaptive demon-\nstration devices may be prohibitive for pri-\nvate offices and smaller centers (19). How-\never, all major diabetes programs should\nfunction as regional referral centers, offer-\ning the appropriate demonstration devices\nand trained educators.\nFrom the Department of Internal Medicine, Divi-\nsion of Endocrinology, St. Louis University Health\nSciences Center, St. Louis, Missouri.\nAddress correspondence to Marla Bernbaum,\nMD, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of\nEndocrinology, St. Louis University Health Sciences\nReferences\n1.

However, because the test is quite\nlabor-intensive, some researchers have\ninvestigated other less complex screening\nmethods. Reichelt et al. (1) recently\ndemonstrated that fasting glucose levels\npredict gestational impaired glucose intol-\nerance (GIGT) with a sensitivity of 81%\nand a specificity of 49% when using a\nthreshold of 4.5 mmol/l. So far, there has\nbeen no study to compare the prediction\nof GIGT with other less laborious tests.\nTherefore, we examined several screening\ntests in the prediction of GDM and GIGT\nand determined the optimal cutoff thresh-\nold for each screening method.\nrecruited from the prenatal clinic at the\nPrince of Wales Hospital. A 50-g GCT was\ngestation. Plasma spot glucose was mea-\nsured before the test and all patients were\nscheduled to have a 75-g oral glucose tol-\nerance test (OGTT) 2\u00ad4 weeks thereafter,\nregardless of the initial GCT results. A\nblood sugar series that included fasting,\n2-h postbreakfast, 2-h postlunch, 2-h\npostsupper, and midnight plasma glucose\nmeasurements was also performed either\nimmediately before or 1 week after the\nOGTT. Plasma fructosamine was also mea-\nsured during the blood sugar series. A\nthe study after the initial recruitment. Glu-\ncose intolerance (GIGT and GDM) was\ndiagnostic criteria of GDM and GIGT\nwere based on the recommendations of\nthe World Health Organization (2). The\naccuracy of predictions of GDM/GIGT\nusing the 1-h GCT, fasting plasma glu-\ncose, spot glucose, postbreakfast glucose,\nand plasma fructosamine values were\ncompared by receiver-operator character-\nistic (ROC) analysis using the test devised\nby DeLong et al. (3).\nwith a family history of diabetes and 15\n(1.5%) women with a previous macro-\nsomic baby. Only 1 patient (0.1%) had a\nprevious history of GDM. The incidence of\nglucose intolerance was significantly higher\nin women who were 25 years of age,\nwere obese, or had a family history of dia-\nsignificant increase in incidence among\nthose with a previous macrosomic baby.\nEach of the areas under the ROC\nSEM 0.025) were significantly greater than\nthat for random spot glucose and plasma\nfructosamine measurements. The areas\nunder the curves were not significantly\ndifferent among the GCT, fasting glucose,\nand 2-h postbreakfast values.\nThe optimal cutoff values were 7.0,\nfasting glucose, 2-h postbreakfast, and\nspot glucose, respectively. The selection of\nthe cutoff value is guided by the Youden\nindex, which is, in general, a compromise\nbetween the sensitivity and the specificity.\nAs we were looking for a good screening\ntest, the highest Youden index in which\nthe sensitivity was 70% was selected.\nIf the policy of selective screening cur-\nrently recommended by the American\nDiabetes Association (ADA) (4) were\nadopted, the number of blood tests could\nbe reduced by 23%. However, the sensitiv-\nfor the GCT, fasting glucose, and 2-h post-\nbreakfast tests, respectively, using the cut-\noff values previously determined. If selec-\ntive screening were performed according\nto the ADA recommendation of using the\nGCT cutoff of 7.8 mmol/l, a sensitivity of\nonly 50% would be achieved.\nTherefore, our findings support recom-\nmendations to offer universal screening to\nhigh-risk ethnic groups. Furthermore, the\nGCT has several disadvantages over the\nmore convenient use of a fasting glucose or\npostbreakfast value, which have similar pre-\ndictive values. Hence, we propose to discon-\ntinue the use of this nonphysiological test.\nAlthough both fasting and postbreakfast\nglucose levels performed as well as GCT in\nthe prediction of GIGT and GDM, fasting\nglucose is more convenient administratively,\nas it does not require timed blood collection.\nTherefore, we recommend the use of fasting\nglucose to replace the GCT as a screening\ntest for GIGT and GDM.\nFrom the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecol-\nogy, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin,\nHong Kong, China.\nAddress correspondence to Wing-Hung Tam,\nMRCOG, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecol-\nogy, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, New Territo-\nries, Hong Kong SAR, China.

Dia-\nShort-Term Oral\nAscorbic Acid\nImproves\nEndothelium-\nDependent\nVasodilatation in\nWomen With a\nHistory of Gestational\nDiabetes Mellitus\nCardiovascular complications are the\nprincipal cause of morbidity and mor-\ntality among patients with type 2 dia-\nLetters\nbetes, primarily as a result of acceleration of\natherosclerosis and increased thrombosis\n(1). One of the early signs in the develop-\nment of atherosclerosis is endothelial dys-\nfunction; abnormal endothelial function has\nbeen observed in patients with conditions\npredisposing to the development of athero-\nsclerosis, including diabetes (2). The mech-\nanisms of endothelial dysfunction in dia-\nbetic individuals are not known, but there is\nstrong evidence that inactivation of nitric\noxide by increased oxygen-derived free rad-\nicals could be responsible. There are studies\nin humans that show that abnormal\nendothelial function in type 2 diabetes has\nbeen restored by treatment with antioxi-\ndants, e.g., ascorbic acid (3). Women with a\nhistory of gestational diabetes mellitus\n(GDM) represent a group of individuals\nwho have insulin resistance and increased\nrisk to develop type 2 diabetes later in life\n(4). We have recently shown that these\nwomen have markedly abnormal endothe-\nlial function, even in the presence of normal\nglucose tolerance (5). Because ascorbic acid\nimproves endothelial function in patients\nwith type 2 diabetes, we hypothesized that\nabnormal endothelium-dependent vasomo-\ntor function in such subjects in a prediabetic\nstate might be improved by ascorbic acid.\nSeventeen women with a history of\nselected from a cohort of women, in whom\nendothelial dysfunction has previously\nbeen reported (5), were enrolled in this\nstudy. Ten of these women were nonobese\nwere otherwise healthy nonsmokers who\nwere not taking any medication at the time\nof the study. Basal insulin resistance was\ncalculated using homeostasis model assess-\nment (6). Each subject was assessed dou-\nble-blindly on 2 visits, 3\u00ad6 months after\ndelivery. On day 1, baseline flow\u00admediated\ndilatation of the brachial artery was esti-\nmated (7), and 2 g ascorbic acid (Cebion,\nMerck, Germany) or similarly appearing\nplacebo tablets were given orally; 2 h later,\nflow-mediated dilatation and nitrate-\ninduced dilatation were estimated. It is\nknown that oral ingestion of 2 g ascorbic\nacid normally leads to plateau plasma lev-\nels after 2 h; these remain elevated for 5 h\nafter ingestion. In addition, the 2-g dose\nproduces a significant increase in plasma\nascorbic acid levels within the physiologi-\ncal range. This dose and timing were thus\nselected, as previously recommended (8).\nOne week later (day 2), measurement of\nbaseline flow\u00admediated dilatation of the\nbrachial artery was repeated and the oppo-\nsite treatment (placebo or ascorbic acid)\nwas administered; 2 h later, flow-mediated\ndilatation and nitrate-induced dilatation\nwere assessed. Measurements obtained at\nbaseline, after ascorbic acid, and after\nplacebo, were compared by analysis of\nvariance for repeated measurements with\nNewman-Keuls post hoc test comparison\nof group mean values. Statistical signifi-\ncance was taken at a P value 0.05.\nFasting glucose concentration, glyco-\nsylated hemoglobin, and oral glucose tol-\nerance tests were all within normal range.\nAdministration of ascorbic acid had no\neffect on heart rate, blood pressure, resting\nblood flow, resting artery diameter, and\nthe degree of reactive hyperemia. Ascorbic\nacid resulted in a significant improvement\nof endothelium-dependent flow-mediated\nwhereas there was no improvement after\neffects of ascorbic acid on arterial smooth\nmuscle cell function, sublingual nitroglyc-\nerin produced arterial dilatation that was\nsimilar in the ascorbic acid and placebo\ncating the absence of a beneficial effect of\nascorbic acid on smooth muscle cell\nresponse to nitric oxide.\nThese findings suggest that ascorbic\nacid improved nitric oxide bioavailability in\nconduit arteries in response to hyperemic\nflow in women with previous GDM; the\nscavenging of free radicals and reduction of\nthe oxidative stress explain the improve-\nment observed after administration of\nascorbic acid. We have recently shown (5)\nthat women with previous GDM have\nmarkedly abnormal endothelial function\nthat is independent of obesity; an interest-\ning possibility is that endothelial dysfunc-\ntion in this setting could be related to the\nchronic insulin resistance known to charac-\nterize this group. A positive correlation\nbetween basal vascular endothelial nitric\noxide production and insulin sensitivity has\nbeen reported in healthy individuals (9),\nsuggesting a direct physiological link\nbetween endothelial function and insulin.\nAn interesting finding in our previous work\n(5) was an inverse correlation of serum uric\nacid levels and flow-mediated dilatation,\nindicating that oxidative stress in women\nwith previous GDM plays a role in the\npathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction. It\nis known that activation of the xanthin/xan-\nthinoxidase system causes generation of\nvascular oxygen radicals, which results in\nreduction of endothelium-dependent vaso-\ndilatation, because xanthinoxidase also\ngenerates uric acid; elevated serum uric\nacid levels appear to be a marker of\nincreased oxidative stress (10). Nitric oxide\nis inactivated by oxygen-derived free radi-\ncals, particularly superoxide anion, leading\nto endothelial dysfunction (11). Ascorbic\nacid is an effective antioxidant, which has\nthe ability to scavenge excess superoxide\nanions and thereby decrease nitric oxide\nIn conclusion, oral ingestion of ascor-\nbic acid acutely improves endothelial dys-\nfunction observed in women with previ-\nous GDM, suggesting that oxygen-derived\nfree radicals may play a role in the patho-\ngenesis of abnormal endothelial function\nin these women. Restoring endothelial\nfunction may have important implications\nfor reducing the risk of atherosclerosis in\nthese subjects. Further studies examining\nthe effects of the long-term administration\nof ascorbic acid on endothelial vasomotor\nactivity will be required before vitamin C\nsupplementation can be recommended in\nwomen with previous GDM and abnormal\nendothelial function.\nFrom the Department of Clinical Therapeutics\n(J.P.L., C.M.P., K.S.S., A.G.D., M.C.A., S.F\n.S.), Uni-\nversity of Athens; and the First Endocrine Section\nand Diabetes Centre (E.A.A., M.C.A.), Alexandra\nUniversity Hospital, Athens, Greece.\nAddress correspondence to John P.
