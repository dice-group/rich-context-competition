Their actions\nare largely driven by the premise that not only combatants\nbut entire civilian populations exposed to the adversities of\narmed conflict and war would require some form of humani-\ntarian assistance, which may include the provision of medi-\ncal and/or psychosocial services, such as psychotherapeutic\ncounseling, psychological aid, and emotional support (Allden\nThe origins of these practices can be traced back to the\nfrontline treatment (also called \"forward psychiatry\") pro-\nvided to combatants by military psychiatrists during World\nWar I, which continued during World War II driven by the\nprinciples of proximity (provision of services as close as pos-\nsible to the frontlines), immediacy (treatment as soon as pos-\nsible), and expectancy (rapid recovery and expected\nresumption of normal duties at the frontlines; Friedman,\nRitchie, & Watson, 2006). Three decades later, in France,\n\"informal\" psychotherapy sessions conducted among Latin\nAmerican torture victims of military regimes gave birth to\nwhat Stanislas Tomkiewicz--a psychiatrist survivor of the\nconcentration camps--described under the name of \"human-\nitarian psychiatry\" (Fassin & Rechtman, 2009).\nOver the last few decades, the assistance to war victims\nmoved the focus from the battle field to the civilian domain,\nleading to the establishment of different initiatives and vary-\ning responses ranging from \"relief operations,\" entailing the\n1McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada\n2King's College London, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nDuncan Pedersen, Douglas Mental Health University Institute, Research\nCentre, McGill University, 6875 Lasalle Blvd., Perry Pavillion, Montreal,\nEmail: duncan.pedersen@mcgill.ca\nSearching for Best Practices:\nA Systematic Inquiry Into the Nature\nof Psychosocial Interventions Aimed at\nReducing the Mental Health Burden in\nConflict and Postconflict Settings\nDuncan Pedersen1, Hanna Kienzler2, and Jaswant Guzder1\n Keywords\npsychosocial, medical and humanitarian interventions, best practices, war and armed conflict, psychological trauma\n2 SAGE Open\nprovision of the \"five essentials\" (protection/rescue, health,\nfood, water, and shelter) to more elaborate responses desig-\nnated variously as \"recovery,\" \"rehabilitation,\" \"post-con-\nflict stabilization,\" and \"peace-building\" operations (Abiew\nWhite & Cliffe, 2000). Humanitarian assistance aimed at the\nprovision of medical and psychosocial services was gradu-\nally adopted, either independently or as part of larger social\nreconstruction and development undertakings to support\npeace, justice, social equity, reconciliation, and reversion of\nthe social breakdown experienced as a result of war and mass\nviolence (Brennan & Nandy, 2001; Fletcher & Weinstein,\nIn the post\u00adCold War era, confronted by the emergence of\na different kind of armed conflicts and \"new\" wars (Kaldor,\n2001), a variety of humanitarian experiments were con-\nducted by the so-called \"new humanitarians\" (Weiss, 2012).\nAccording to T. G. Weiss (2012), these new wars had four\ndifferential features with the conventional wars of the past:\nfirst, the locus of war was no longer confined to a territory\nwith state borders; second, nonstate, nonmilitary actors\nplayed an increasing important role (i.e., war lords); third,\nthe economies of war were no longer supported by govern-\nment funding, but by illicit activities (i.e., drug trafficking,\norganized crime syndicates, etc.); and fourth, the death toll\nwas made up of increasing number of civilians as opposed to\nmilitary personnel.\nIn response to these wars, military interventions were\noften conducted against governmental wishes or without\nexplicit or meaningful consent. These interventions were\ncarried on the grounds of humanitarian principles with the\npurpose of preventing massive loss of life, genocide and\nmass atrocities, and widespread abuses of human rights.\nThe term of \"humanitarian interventions\" was coined and\nadopted in this particular sense, ranging across peace\nenforcement, coercive protection of civilians, and war\n1996). At the same time, the need for humanitarian assis-\ntance grew exponentially and new actors--represented not\nonly by UN agencies but also by governmental agencies\nand international nongovernmental organizations\n(NGOs)--sprang up with each crisis. Funding for humani-\n2013, the international community responded to the dra-\nmatic escalation of needs with a record US$22 billion in\nfunding. This was a significant increase from the 2 previous\nyears--and over US$2.5 billion more than the previous\nquake and the Pakistani floods (Global Humanitarian\nAssistance Report [GHA], 2014). The proliferation of\nagencies, actors, and funds brought along the need for\nestablishing norms and treatment practices, as well as set-\nting minimum standards for emergency response.\nHumanitarian assistance assumed a new identity no lon-\nger aimed to be palliative and politically neutral, but rather\nactively contributing to address structural problems and\nimprove the quality of life including, whenever possible, to\nconsolidate the peace process (Calhoun, 2010). While the\nprovision of food and control of communicable diseases\nwere the main focus of humanitarian assistance programs\nuntil the early 1990s, psychological trauma and the mental\nhealth consequences of human rights abuses gradually\nreemerged as a more salient feature and have since received\nincreasing attention as an area deserving effective collective\na direct consequence of this shift in both aims and composi-\ntion of humanitarian assistance, a wide range of interven-\ntions addressing mental health and psychosocial needs\nbecame the focus of attention of many Western-based\nexperts, social scientists, and health professionals (Bolton,\nDelVecchio, Abramowitz, Kleinman, & Panter-Brick, 2014;\nHobfoll et\nal., 2007; Inter-Agency Standing Committee\nBarbui, et\nal., 2011; M. Weiss, Saraceno, Saxena, & van\nThat is, besides the provision of basic health care, humanitar-\nian initiatives increasingly included psychological or psychi-\natric aid and emotional support, and offered information,\nsympathetic reassurance, and fostering of resilience and\nsocial cohesion in recognition of core mental health and psy-\nchosocial needs of the affected populations. Interestingly,\nthere remains substantial variance between researchers,\nmental health experts, first responders, clinicians, and practi-\ntioners over the nature, structure, and contents of psychoso-\ncial interventions aimed at reducing the mental health burden\nand suffering in war-torn and postconflict societies.\nMoreover, it has been argued that despite the many treatment\noptions available, there is an overall lack of evidence for\nmost psychosocial interventions currently being imple-\nTo gain insight into this dynamic field broadly defined as\n\"psychosocial\" and assess the qualitative evidence of the\nmost commonly used treatment modalities in collective\ninterventions aimed at civilian populations affected by armed\nconflicts and wars, we conducted a focused and systematic\nreview of the literature. The review and related discussion\nwas driven by the following questions: (a) What are the\nexisting paradigms supporting psychosocial interventions in\nmedical and humanitarian initiatives aimed at reducing the\nmental health burden of civilian populations in conflict and\npostconflict settings? (b) What are the main implementation\ngaps in the delivery of medical and psychosocial interven-\ntions? On what kind of evidence are practices currently\nbased? (c) In light of the above, which are considered best\npractices in individual and collective interventions aimed at\ncivilian populations exposed to armed conflict and war? The\nPedersen et al. 3\noverall aim of the review and critical appraisal was to inform\nreaders and stakeholders of the assortment and range of psy-\nchosocial and/or collective interventions aimed at civilian\npopulations, more specifically adults, exposed to armed con-\nflict and wars in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).\nA Short Genealogy of Psychosocial\nInterventions\nAs pointed above, the \"psychosocial\" construct in humani-\ntarian aid endeavors emerged toward the end of the 1900s, as\nan area of inquiry and practice combining both the psycho-\nlogical and social domains aimed at the modification of risk\nfactors and/or behaviors conducive to disease onset or recur-\nrence resulting from exposure to extreme adversities, such as\nwar or natural disasters. Since then, these practices have\nundergone multiple and successive changes and adaptations\nGlass (2000), \"psychosocial\" has been conceptualized as\none's psychological development within, and in dynamic\ninteraction with, a given social environment and implies the\nintimate connections existing between our social and our\npsychological and biological existence. In conflict and post-\nconflict settings, the attention of psychosocial advocates is,\ntherefore, focused on the stressful social and material condi-\ntions such as poverty and destitution, food insecurity, social\nconflicts within the community, and erosion of the social fab-\nric, including the marginalization and struggle of particular\ngroups such as former child soldiers, raped and sexually\nabused survivors, refugees, widows and the elderly, and peo-\nple with disabilities (Miller & Rasmussen, 2010).\nAs these conditions are believed to cause and exacerbate\ndistress and social suffering, interventions are designed\nwith the aim to alter the social context and its inherent ineq-\nuities. Psychosocial interventions are implemented at the\nlevel of the individual, the family, the social network, the\ncommunity, and/or at the wider population to improve\nhealth and mental health outcomes (International Federation\nof Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies [IFRC], 2009;\nReyes, 2006). For nonconflict settings, five broad types of\npsychosocial interventions have been identified focusing\non behavioral change, social support, disease management,\ndistress mitigation, and control/efficacy enhancement\n(Glass, 2000). A review of the currently employed extended\nmental health and psychosocial support practices in human-\nitarian settings shows that the most commonly used inter-\nventions are counseling, providing and facilitating\ncommunity-based social supports, structured social activi-\nties, provision of information, raising awareness, and psy-\nchoeducation (Tol, Barbui, etal., 2011).\nFor the purpose of this article, we have adopted the term\n\"psychosocial intervention\" to refer to activities designed as\ncollective interventions variously labeled as \"counseling,\"\n\"psychoeducational,\" and/or \"psychotherapeutic.\" These\ninterventions are aimed toward primary and/or secondary\nprevention, as well as exerting positive influence to the course\nand outcome of distress and illness, including the promotion\nof resilience and effective coping with major individual chal-\nlenges and social adversities. Such psychosocial interventions\nultimately aim at the resumption of normal life, facilitating\naffected people's convalescence and preventing pathological\nconsequences of potentially traumatic or stressful situations\nthreatening the integrity of the lives of individuals, families,\nand communities. Mollica and colleagues (2004) argue that\nwhile psychosocial interventions are primarily concerned\nwith the psychological and social well-being of individuals,\nthey go beyond to include the repair of collective social struc-\ntures. In other words, the term psychosocial implies the\ndynamic relations between psychological effects (e.g., emo-\ntions, behaviors, and memory) and social effects (e.g., altered\nsocial relations as a result of loss, separation, family, and\ncommunity breakdown; Mollica etal., 2004). However, until\nnow little is known about the evidence base sustaining these\ninterventions, their effectiveness and cultural appropriate-\nness, the planning and implementation processes followed, as\nwell as the ways in which current practices are rendered sus-\ntainable to aid the development of long-term restructuring of\nmental health systems in unstable or turbulent states.\nMethodology: Search Strategy and\nSelection Criteria\nWe decided to search the scientific literature published over\nthe last two decades. In view of previously published meta-\nanalyses and systematic reviews of randomized controlled\ntrials (RCTs) on the evidence base of mental health interven-\ntions in war and postwar contexts (McPherson, 2012; Meffert\nwe decided to avoid duplication of efforts by excluding all\nRCTs and systematic reviews of RCTs and meta-analyses\nfrom our review. Instead, we concentrated our search of the\nliterature on the middle and lower grades of evidence, as rep-\nresented by expert opinion, observational and qualitative or\nmixed-method studies, case reports, case control, and\ncommunity-based studies. We decided to sharpen our focus\neven further on the most commonly used treatment modalities\nin psychosocial interventions among civilian populations,\nbecause of the reported overall scarcity of studies on psycho-\nsocial support and best practices in humanitarian settings and\nthe exclusion of \"psychosocial wellbeing\" as an outcome in\nthe systematic reviews and meta-analyses already published\nAnother issue shaping our review is the tendency of sys-\ntematic reviews of RCTs to reflect clinicians' perspectives\nrather than patients'needs and community priorities for care.\nIn reviewing qualitative, observational, and community-\nbased studies, we aimed to restore patients' and community\nviews and priorities--as far as they were reported in the lit-\nerature reviewed--thus broadening our critical perspective\nto existing systematic reviews (Berkwits, 1998).\n4 SAGE Open\nTo gain insight into these particularities, we systemati-\ncally searched for references listed in the following elec-\ntronic databases: PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, and\nPubMed. For the search to be both sensitive and specific in\nrelation to our questions, we used the keywords: war AND\nmental health AND trauma. Then, we combined these key-\nwords variously with the search terms: treatment OR mental\nhealth interventions OR psychotherapy OR psychosocial\nOR posttraumatic stress disorder OR group therapy. Each\nsearch was, in turn, delimitated by the following criteria: (a)\nthe search period encompassed nearly two decades, from\nin English were included. This search identified a total of\nIn addition, we searched the following journals: American\nJournal of Public Health; British Journal of Psychiatry;\nBritish Medical Journal; Disasters; Intervention:\nInternational Journal of Mental Health, Psychological Work\nand Counseling in Areas of Armed Conflict; Journal of\nNervous and Mental Disease; Medicine, Conflict and\nSurvival; Social Science & Medicine; The Lancet; Journal of\nTraumatic Stress; and Transcultural Psychiatry. We also\nsearched the reference lists of particular journal articles. This\nmanual search resulted in 46 additional articles.\nAs a result, a total of 4,278 articles were screened through\na staged process. First, each electronic search was repeated to\nremove duplicates and exclude articles that contained the key\nwords--\"military,\" \"veterans,\" and \"refugees\"--to focus the\nreview on studies conducted in LMICs where most of the\nwars are currently raging and limit our search to adult civilian\npopulations. Additional reasons for excluding the above-\nmentioned vulnerable populations were that (a) there already\nexist a number of systematic literature reviews focusing on\nmental health and psychosocial interventions directed at mili-\ntary service personnel (i.e., Carlson etal., 2011; Institute of\nMedicine [IOM], 2008), refugees (i.e., Crumlish & O'Rourke,\nBarbui, etal., 2011), and (b) intervention strategies directed\nat these groups often follow particular designs that are not\neasily comparable with those devised for adult civilian survi-\nvors of armed conflict who recover in their respective\nTable 1.

Second, to remove duplicate records across\ndatabases (this could not be done electronically), we screened\nthe search results manually and were able to exclude another\n497. The total number of excluded articles (electronic and\nA total of 924 records were then manually assessed for\neligibility. In this process, we excluded all books, book chap-\nters, and dissertations (n = 215); studies conducted among\nveterans and military that had slipped through the electronic\nscreening (n = 55); studies on interventions conducted among\nchildren and/or adolescents (they are currently under review\nand will be published separately; n = 157); works reporting\non interventions in Western contexts (n = 37); meta-analyses\nand RCTs conducted in Western and non-Western contexts\n(n = 25); and epidemiological surveys reporting only on\nprevalence rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and\nother disorders (n = 77). We further excluded studies that\nwere irrelevant for our review (i.e., natural disasters; n = 3), and\nthose that did not report on any type of intervention did not\nprovide output measures or were purely descriptive, concep-\ntual, or theoretical (n = 215). We retained 28 full-text peer-\nreviewed articles describing individual or community-based\npsychosocial interventions directed at adult populations in\nwar and postwar contexts.\nThe procedure for data collection consisted of two con-\nsecutive rounds of independent readings conducted by the\nauthors. After the first round, we extracted basic information\nfor each study: source (journal/impact factor, author/s); tar-\nget group and country; study design and research tools (case\ncontrol study, community-based intervention, pharmacother-\napy, trauma healing workshop, etc.); type of intervention\n(two main categories: trauma-focused interventions and\nbroader psychosocial and community-based mental health\ninterventions) and treatment protocol adopted (i.e., nature,\ncontent, frequency of sessions); follow-up and assessment of\noutcomes; and main results. The classification adopted under\nmain results, expressed as beneficial or improved status,\ninconclusive and/or negative, and/or general recommenda-\ntions, is arbitrary and derived from the concluding remarks\nor assessment made by the author/s. For example, if the\nmajority of treated cases were reported as an improvement or\nas a symptom's relief, then the results were listed as benefi-\ncial. Conversely, if the authors of a case control study\nreported that \"no intervention effect was found,\" then the\nresults were listed as inconclusive.\nAs the process of independent readings was completed by\nthe two readers (main author and first coauthor), we com-\npared notes to ensure reliability of the data collected among\nFigure 1.

Any discrepancies in\nthe data collected and summarized were discussed, and if\nneeded, the opinion of the third author was requested to gain\nconsensus and conciliate the interpretation of results. These\nresults were then organized according to categories gener-\nated from the collected material, along themes (i.e., qualita-\ntive and quantitative research tools, individual and group\ntherapies used, ad hoc therapies, traditional healing and cop-\ning practices, etc.) and main results (i.e., beneficial, incon-\nclusive, recommendations, etc.).\nDuring the second round of readings, we performed an\nin-depth selective reading and critical appraisal of the study\ndesign, sample size, content of the intervention, provisions\nfor follow-up, and mental health outcomes, trying to find\nsupportive evidence and linkages between specific therapies\nand reported results. We also included in our review quanti-\ntative results, perceived barriers to treatment, and patients'\nself-assessment, if any. These results were then analyzed,\nand after data reduction and interpretation, we transfer it to a\ndata-recording matrix, which is now presented as a summary\nin Table 2.\nResults of the Literature Review\nThe literature review shows a wide range of intervention ini-\ntiatives at the individual and collective level, ranging from\nclinical and observational studies to community-based inter-\nventions, quasi-experimental case and control studies, and\ndescriptive studies outlining \"real-life\" interventions. The\ncountries in which these interventions were performed are\nequally as diverse, including Algeria, Angola, Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, Burma, Cambodia, Congo, Croatia, Gaza and\nthe West Bank, Guatemala, Guinea, India, Indonesia, Iraq,\nIsrael, Kosovo, Liberia, Mozambique, Nepal, Rwanda,\nSierra Leone, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.\nIn Table 2, we provide detailed summary information\nwith regard to the literature reviewed focusing on sources\n(author/s and year of publication), target group and country,\nstudy design and research tools, type of intervention, follow-\nup and assessment of results/outcomes, and main results and/\nor general recommendations.\nThe systematic review makes apparent that the study\ndesigns are extremely diverse. The research tools used range\nfrom validated clinical or screening questionnaires and scales\n(i.e., Beck Depression Inventory [BDI], Hopkins Symptom\nChecklist [HSCL], and Mini International Neuropsychiatric\nInterview [MINI]) to focus group discussions and semistruc-\ntured and open-ended interviews accordingly. The number of\ncommunity-based, observational and qualitative or mixed-\nmethod studies (20) prevailed over quasi-experimental, case\nand control study designs (8).\nThe literature review reveals a wide repertoire of inter-\nventions, including therapies used, ranging from various\nforms of psychotherapy and psychosocial counseling (Bass\nHercigonja, & Jambrosic, 2002; Mooren, de Jong, Kleber, &\nRuvic, 2003) to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; Morina,\nRushiti, Salihu, & Ford, 2010), Internet-based CBT (Wagner,\nSchulz, & Knaevelsrud, 2012), narrative exposure therapy\n(NET; Neuner etal., 2008), psychosocial support (Kozaric-\nKovacic etal., 2002), psychological support and assistance\nduring exhumations (Eppel, 2002), sociotherapy (Richters,\nmethods (Igreja, Kleijn, Schreuder, van Dijk, & Verschuur,\n2004), psychopharmacological agents and counseling\n(Nakimuli-Mpungu etal., 2013; Somasundaram, van de Put,\nEisenbruch, & de Jong, 1999), community-based mental\nhealth services and psychosocial interventions (Agani,\nShala, Sejdijaj, Odell, & Dabishevci, 2001; Mooren etal.,\nWestern and/or traditional healing practices (Eppel, 2002;\nMercer, Ager, & Ruwanpura, 2005; Somasundaram etal.,\nWhile the review shows a gamut of collective interventions\nemployed worldwide, it also reveals discrepancies between\ndifferent authors regarding treatment goals and best practices\nto deal with trauma-related emotional distress and mental\ndisorders. In fact, considering the extreme diversity of treat-\nment approaches used, it seems that we are far from reaching\nconsensus to date regarding effective psychosocial interven-\ntions in the early and/or late phases of exposure to traumatic\nexperiences. Our findings are supported by other literature\nreviews that have pointed to the fact that there exists substan-\ntial variance among researchers, mental health experts, first\nresponders, clinicians, and practitioners over the best prac-\ntices and an overall lack of evidence for interventions aimed\nat reducing the mental health burden in war-torn and postwar\nAccording to the type of intervention, it is worth noting\ntrauma-focused interventions are a clear minority (Fuertes,\nlisted above addressing broader psychosocial and community-\nbased mental health issues.

The absence of longitudinal data impoverishes\nfurther the reporting of results of the clinical encounter or\nintended intervention. Nevertheless, the majority of the stud-\nies (18) show beneficial or improved outcomes of the inter-\nvention, or were at least able to transform results into general\nrecommendations. A smaller number (10) of all reviewed\nstudies reported inconclusive results. We believe that the\nclaimed results need to be taken with caution as most studies\nincluded in our review have no control groups and, therefore,\nthe evidence shown is potentially weak and fails to demon-\nstrate that the treatments chosen for the various conditions\nare more (or less) effective than natural recovery. It should\nbe further acknowledged that in spite of the reported results,\nwe are still lacking clinical evidence from the literature\nreviewed about (a) who should (or should not) receive spe-\ncialized treatment when confronted with psychological\ntrauma; (b) what kind of intervention is best to be prescribed\nand what should be the optimal duration of treatment; and\nfinally (c) how and why a clinical intervention may work in\nsome cases and not in others (Mollica etal., 2004; Shalev,\nAnother finding of the review is that there seems to be a\ntacit agreement among the reviewed authors about the impor-\ntance of designing psychosocial interventions and evaluation\nstrategies in culturally appropriate ways to serve conflict-\naffected populations effectively. However, a closer look\nreveals that cultural adaptation is carried out and described to\nvarying degrees. Six studies outline psychosocial interven-\ntions that were developed from the ground up by local experts\nor the involvement of religious leaders, traditional healers,\nand the wider community (Anckermann etal., 2005; Doucet\negies are described as differing significantly from strategies\ndeveloped in Western settings as they are shaped by specific\nbelief and value structures, supported by local resources, and\nembedded into the available, albeit limited, infrastructure.\nFor instance, Doucet and Denov (2012) delineate particular\nstrategies with which social workers in Sierra Leone sup-\nported war-affected women and girls and highlight the\nimportance\nto advocate for supporting local capacities, as well as the\ninclusion of local helpers in internationally-funded programs,\nwhich will not only benefit war-affected individuals, but also\nwill help rebuild the social capital networks that may have been\nAnother example is the use of symbolic cleansing rituals for\nspiritual pollution (\"noro\"), and ceremonial gestures of rec-\nonciliation, resulting in significant improvement of mental\nhealth status, as perceived by elimination of symptoms,\nimproved emotions and stigma reduction among girls\nexposed to atrocities of war, and sexual abuse and rape in\nFive of the reviewed studies thoroughly describe cultur-\nally informed approaches to treatment by outlining how\nWestern approaches to care were modified through the inclu-\nsion of local resources; values, beliefs, and rituals; and medi-\nation and relaxation techniques (Agani etal., 2010; Doucet\nonly claim to have adapted their intervention strategies in\nculturally informed ways without providing any further\ninformation. Typical statements are as follows: \"The psycho-\ndynamic approach of trauma . . . was adapted by experts in\ntrans-cultural psychiatry to the Palestinian culture\"\ntrauma experts and participants adapted intervention tech-\nniques to the local culture\" (K. de Jong, Kleber, & Puratic,\nbased CBT framework, in conjunction with culturally sensi-\ntive and culturally relevant knowledge and activities\"\nther explain what cultural adaptation entails, how it can be\nachieved, and what the benefits or challenges of such an\napproach are.

[and] it was very\ndifficult to find meaningful words or phrases in the local\nlanguage for several other concepts related to \"affect,\"\n\"remembering,\" \"hearing\" and \"thinking.\" (p. 256)\nOn the contrary, Morina etal. (2010) reflect that to achieve\nbetter treatment results, it would have been important to\nadapt evidence-based treatment for survivors of war \"based\non their culture and life circumstances in order to recover\nfrom PTSD and experience general emotional relief\" (p. 79).\nFinally, it is interesting to note that not a single study\nincluded in this review has acknowledged the various interna-\ntional best-practice guidelines currently available. In part, this\nmay be due to the fact that about half (13 out of 28) of the\nstudies were conducted before international guidelines were\nmade widely available. However, as early as 2000, the Red\nCross World Disaster Report sharply criticized international\nmental health initiatives and issued a call for standards to bet-\nter structure relief and humanitarian efforts (IFRC, 2000).\nSince then, a growing number of international guidelines have\nbeen launched, such as the recently published Building Back\nHealth in Emergencies, the National Institute of Mental Health\n(NIMH; 2002) report on Mental Health and Mass Violence,\nand the Guidelines for International Training in mental health\nand psychosocial interventions (Weine etal., 2002).All guide-\nlines have specifically included agreed upon recommenda-\ntions for the provision of psychological \"first aid\" and mental\nhealth care as part of humanitarian assistance efforts (Kienzler\nNotwithstanding attempts to find the middle ground and\nset up standards for minimum psychosocial interventions,\nhealth care providers and frontline practitioners still criticize\nthe application of such standardized interventions, and their\neffectiveness continues to be contested based on the argu-\nments that they reflect both the experts' opinions and the\ngeneral common sense, but most often the recommended\ninterventions are insufficiently tested in real-field situations\nand little evidence of effectiveness or fitness-for-purpose\nexists (Gaboulaud etal., 2010; Litz, Gray, Bryant, & Adler,\nDiscussion\nThe consequences of exposure to intentional violence such\nas armed conflict and war are compounded by multiple fac-\ntors. Researchers and practitioners remain divided along a\ncontinuum as to the psychopathological effects attributable\nto the traumatic experience. While some tend to minimize\nthe psychological needs of individuals exposed to traumatic\nexperiences, others assume all of the exposed, including vic-\ntims and survivors, are in need of psychosocial assistance,\nincluding treatment and rehabilitation services. Depending\non the particular outlook, the planning and delivery of psy-\nchosocial interventions are therefore differently organized as\nwell as the nature and content of the interventions remain\nstrongly influenced by the context and an array of individual\nand collective factors, including resources available and\nfunding sources. Furthermore, as explained in the\n\"Introduction\" section, the delivery of mental health and\npsychosocial support is today no longer solely in the hands\nof governmental or multilateral agencies. Instead, NGOs, the\nprivate sector, religious-driven relief and advocacy\norganizations, and, more recently, the military and security\ncompanies are gradually assuming a pivotal role in conduct-\ning psychosocial interventions at various levels, under the\nlabel of humanitarian assistance (Joachim & Schneiker,\nactors, which are mostly based in high-income countries,\nusually promote off-the-shelf Western-based therapeutic\nintervention strategies, which are seldom properly adapted to\nthe needs and expectations of potential recipients and benefi-\nciaries, which in turn come from a highly diverse social and\ncultural range of LMICs and war-torn societies worldwide\nGiven these complexities, we decided to address some of\nthese issues by organizing our discussion under the three sets\nof questions guiding our focused and systematic review of\nthe literature, as postulated in the \"Introduction\" section to\nthis article.\n1. What are the existing paradigms supporting psycho-\nsocial interventions in medical and humanitarian ini-\ntiatives aimed at reducing the mental health burden\nof civilian populations in conflict and postconflict\nsettings?\nDespite the apparent consensus regarding the need for\nevidence-based psychosocial interventions in conflict and\npostconflict situations, our literature review reveals the coex-\nistence of competing paradigms among scholars and practi-\ntioners, unveiling a multiplicity of approaches with respect to\nindividual and collective best practices in planning, conduct-\ning, and evaluating psychosocial interventions. There are\nthose who seem to favor a narrower application, so-called\n\"trauma-focused intervention,\" addressing distress and\ntrauma primarily within medical or psychological paradigms\ntargeting individuals with protocols for screening, diagnosis,\ntion of wider, more comprehensive psychosocial approaches,\ntargeting communities and, at times, individuals at risk,\nadopting a \"bricolage\" of different therapeutic and psychoso-\ncial paradigms (Anckermann et\nMiller and Rasmussen (2010) postulate that fundamen-\ntally different assumptions underlie these two main\napproaches: For trauma-focused advocates, the critical factor\ninvolved in the causality chain is the single and direct expo-\nsure to a traumatic event, a belief which in turn is fueled by\nthe growing clinical field of psychotraumatology. In con-\ntrast, for those grouped as supportive of a wider psychosocial\napproach, the attribution of causality focuses primarily on\nthe overall stressful social and material conditions caused or\nworsened by armed conflict and war, including other prior or\ncoexisting conditions such as extreme poverty, poor housing,\nand food insecurity, and/or those derived from internal dis-\nplacement and refugee status often resulting in stigmatiza-\ntion, social exclusion, and partial or total loss of social and\nmaterial support.\nInspired by the Cambodian survivors of the Pol Pot period\nmay be seen as a new paradigm or theoretical framework com-\nbining three analytic approaches: (a) a multiaxial approach\n(with 11 analytic perspectives ranging from biology to the\nnature of trauma to the social context), (b) a \"typology of\nerrors\" that should be avoided to evaluate trauma in a cultur-\nally sensitive fashion, and (c) the \"multiplex models\" to show\nhow trauma symptoms are generated through biocultural\nmechanisms, and how trauma results in episodes of distress.\nThese may be seen as useful tools in examining trauma-related\ndisorders across different cultures, where local trauma ontolo-\ngies may be delineated and the cross-cultural study of these\nontologies advanced (Hinton & Good, 2015b). Through these\nthree analytic approaches, the researcher thus becomes aware\nof key processes to target in psychosocial interventions that\nseek to alleviate distress and build resilience of individuals\nand communities affected by conflict and war.\nGoing back to our discussion on \"Results of the Literature\nReview\" section, we are not implying that diverse--and at\ntimes competing paradigms--as well as the emerging multi-\nplicity of approaches followed by the different authors\nincluded in this review are necessarily counterproductive,\nbut this variability may simply reflect, on one hand, the dif-\nferent disciplinary backgrounds of public health experts,\nresearchers, and practitioners involved and, on the other, the\nneed to adapt and accommodate the intervention to the mul-\ntidimensional approaches discussed above and the ever-\nchanging contexts, the variable socioeconomic position of\nsurvivors, the polymorphic cultural expression of symptoms\nof distress, and the heterogeneity of trauma-related disorders\n(Young & Breslau, 2015), all of which defy or interfere with\nefforts for standardization of clinical diagnostic tools and\ntherapeutic protocols.\n2. What are the main implementation gaps in the deliv-\nery of medical and psychosocial interventions? On\nwhat kind of evidence are practices currently based?\nThrough our systematic review, we discerned at least four\nmain implementation gaps:\nFirst, the effective delivery of medical and psychosocial\ninterventions imply the timely identification of cases (case\nfinding) and the provision of services to people identified as\npositives (true cases), who are at greatest need for conditions\nor disorders for which proven therapies exist. In most psycho-\nsocial interventions conducted in humanitarian settings,\nincluding the ones under review, \"active\" case finding is rare,\nbut cases are usually identified by symptom checklists applied\nto persons demanding services at the point of delivery. The\nscreening of symptoms or triage does not necessarily make up\nfor a diagnosis, and therefore an unknown number of \"false\npositives\" may be misdiagnosed and prescribed a superfluous\nor unnecessary treatment. As explained above, we are still\nlacking enough evidence as to who should (or should not)\nreceive specialized treatment when confronted with massive\nIt has been further acknowledged the lack of evidence on\nthe efficacy of most psychotherapeutic modalities applied in\nhumanitarian settings (Lopes Cardoso, 2008; Patel et\nal.,\ning the inefficatious, but also potentially harmful, critical\nincident stress debriefing (Litz & Gibson, 2006; Litz etal.,\nal., 2003). Practitioners in the field of\nhumanitarian assistance largely agree that despite the pleth-\nora of available treatment options, there remains an absence\nof a solid evidence base for most mental health and psycho-\nsocial support interventions (Allden etal., 2009). A similar\nclaim was raised by the IOM, in their report following a sys-\ntematic review of the scientific evidence on treatment modal-\nities for PTSD among war veterans. The IOM report states\nthat for all drug classes and specific drugs reviewed in each\nof the classes, the evidence is inadequate to determine effi-\ncacy in the treatment of PTSD among war veterans. With\nregard to psychotherapies, the report states that only for\nexposure therapies (i.e., CBT), there is sufficient evidence to\nconclude its efficacy in the treatment of PTSD (IOM, 2008).\nDespite these assertions, most interventions included in\nthis focused and systematic review have used one or other\nform of psychotherapeutic treatment protocol. Most of these\ninterventions claim to have had beneficial or improved out-\ncomes--expressed as symptom reduction--more often than\nfailure. This may be explained by the fact that absence of evi-\ndence for a given treatment does not necessarily mean it is\ninefficacious. However, the qualification of beneficial has\nbeen most often made with a before and after design for which\nthe reliability of the measures used for symptom reduction is\nlikely to be low (Type II error), and in most cases of such\nexposure to extreme traumatic experiences, the remission of\nsymptoms may be a long and often unattainable treatment goal\nIn addition, people surviving exposure to armed conflict\nand war are expected to experience at least one, if not more\nthan one, morbid condition, and for many, comorbidity is the\nnorm. In stark contrast, the trauma-focused interventions\nreviewed here are aimed to deal with single morbid condi-\ntions and tend to separate mental and physical health care,\ndisregarding the principle of providing integrated care for\nboth aspects of collective health (Gunn, 2015).\nSecond, it is also noteworthy that in most of the reviewed\nstudies, neither early detection nor early interventions were\nconducted, and with a few exceptions, we could find no refer-\nences to the timeline between the initial assessment, the actual\nintervention, and the claimed postintervention response. As\nstated above in the presentation of results, we are still unsure\nas to what kind of intervention is best and what should be the\noptimal duration of treatment, as well as how and why a clini-\ncal intervention seems to work in some cases and not in others\nIn spite of the various forms of individual therapy avail-\nable (whether proven effective or not), most reported inter-\nventions outlined the provision of psychotherapy, trauma\ncounseling, or general psychological support, with little\nattempts to measure or systematically validate treatment out-\ncomes. For the most part, therapeutic aims remained ambig-\nuous, as some focused on distress mitigation and others\nfocused on management of trauma-related disorders or\nsymptom relief and reduction, as measured by self-reports or\nsymptom checklists or improved daily functioning. In the\nreview, we still remain uncertain of the mutative factors that\nlead to positive outcomes in some cases, but not in others.\nWhile it is possible that the mental health burden in the\nearly phase of conflict or postconflict might be partly reduced\nby medication and brief exposure therapy, in the case of pro-\ntracted violence and enduring social disruption, such focused\ninterventions are bound to have limited impact. Moreover,\nthe preventive efficacy of debriefing in trauma-related disor-\nders has not yet been clearly demonstrated (Bisson, 2003;\nRose etal., 2003). While most reported individual or group\ninterventions consisted of periodic (i.e., weekly) sessions,\nthus avoiding an abbreviated course, eight psychosocial\ninterventions did not specify the number of sessions con-\nducted during the implementation phase.\nIn addition, while most interventions were described as\npsychosocial or used psychodynamic principles (counseling,\nCBT, NET, etc.), only two studies (Nakimuli-Mpungu etal.,\nchotropic medications in conducting their clinical interven-\ntion, in combination with other therapies, with beneficial\nresults on the first study, but inconclusive on the second.\nTypically, most reviewed interventions were cross-sectional,\nwith no provisions made for medium- or long-term follow-up,\nwhich severely limits the understanding of long-term effects\nof exposure to violence and the process of natural recovery.\nThird, planning and conducting a clinical intervention as\npart of medical and humanitarian aid cannot be separated\nfrom the context, the social and cultural realities of the fam-\nily and the community. Informed by systemic and wider\nsocial agendas, the clinical team should be able to antici-\npate what may be harmful, neutral, or helpful and preserve\nthe needed therapeutic flexibility. Recovery from acute\ntrauma unfolds within a given context which often includes\nother severe daily stressors derived from overall insecurity,\nunresolved grief, and the adversities created by poverty,\nsocial exclusion, and the social breakdown, or severe attri-\ntion of social support networks (Kirmayer, Guzder, &\nSeveral of the studies reviewed here reveal that it would\nbe rather simplistic to regard survivors of armed conflict and\nwar as passive repositories of negative psychological\nexperiences and effects. However, the dynamic interaction of\nendogenous protective factors at play, such as resilience, and\ntheir influence in the process of healing, coping, and natural\nrecovery was rarely mentioned, let alone discussed in the lit-\nerature reviewed.\nThis lapse or omission may reflect an earlier treatment\nfocus on trauma psychopathology while relatively recent\nemerging notions on resilience capacity, posttraumatic\ngrowth, and positive coping were still little known and were\nnot a part of common practices (Almedom, 2005; Monnier &\nHobfoll, 2000; Ruiz-Casares, Guzder, Rousseau, &\nbereavement conducted among Chinese and U.S adults con-\ncluded that resilience does not necessarily have the same\nmeanings and raised questions whether or not different cul-\ntures may learn from each other about coping with traumatic\nexperiences and extreme adversity (Bonanno, Papa, Lalande,\nNanping, & Noll, 2005; Hinton, Hinton, Pich, Loeum, &\nPollack, 2009). As there may be a link between personality\nand resilient outcomes, resilient traits may be something\n\"relatively fixed\" and therefore not easily taught or trans-\nferred to others (Bonanno, 2010), and resilience paradigms\nsuch as \"mindfulness\" may require training and special skills\nto be effectively transported across cultures and meaning\nsystems.\nThe promotion of resilience appears to be a clear aim in at\nleast one case study of the literature review. This study was\nconducted by Agani (University of Pristina) and U.S.-based\ncollaborators, in postwar Kosovo (see Agani etal., 2010).\nThe Linking Human Systems (LINC) Community Resilience\nModel was grounded in indigenous resources, and family-\nfocused and community-based interventions culturally\nadapted and modified to the Kosovar situation. The aim of\nthis type of community intervention was to build resilience\nand empowerment by creating linkages at various levels of\nthe social network, and make it highly participatory, with\nreduced long-term professional involvement and sustainable\nover time.\nFourth, there is a persistent gap between the local cultural\nexpressions of distress and the PTSD construct held by\nWestern-based mental health professionals, usually assigned\nto conduct psychosocial interventions such as the ones under\nreview here. The nosologies of PTSD are problematic when\napplied across cultures, because emic studies suggest that the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual model of PTSD is not con-\ngruent with most trauma-related mental health constructs\nKienzler, 2008; Pedersen, Tremblay, Errazuriz, & Gamarra,\nSubstantial cross-cultural variation appears to exist\nreflecting diagnostic and symptomatic heterogeneity and no\nclear coherence on what constitutes symptoms of PTSD\nacross different cultures (Hinton & Good, 2015b). Rasmussen\netal. (2014) found clusters of trauma symptoms cannot be\ndistinguished by trauma versus chronic stress and loss, and\nthat while avoidance is conceptualized as psychopathology\nin the PTSD symptom list, it has no discriminant validity\nlinking it with impairment and may operate positively as a\ncoping mechanism post trauma or a culturally reinforced\ndefense strategy. The multiple sociocultural levels involved\nin this process may indeed inform and shape the fluidity of\nsymptom construction and interpretation, which are essential\ningredients for conducting a clinical intervention and assess-\ning success or failure of treatment (Kirmayer, Lemelson, &\n3. In light of the above, which are considered best prac-\ntices in individual and collective interventions aimed\nat civilian populations exposed to armed conflict and\nwar?\nWe must first acknowledge that developing a clinical\nevaluative framework for assessing individual and collective\ninterventions among civilian populations in conflict and\npostconflict scenarios is extremely challenging, given the\ncomplexity of mass trauma, the heterogeneity of trauma and\nits victims, and the array of possible outcomes most inter-\nventions potentially have (Shalev, 2006). In clinical natural-\nistic studies, it may be difficult to attribute improvement to a\ngiven set of treatment practices, without randomization and\ncontrols to compare with. In this case, the final outcome of\ntreatment may be influenced by other intervening factors, not\nnecessarily strictly related to the treatment itself. Carefully\ndesigned psychosocial interventions studies are expensive\nand complex undertakings, requiring careful planning, clear\ndefinition of expected outcomes, and a solid evaluation\ndesign (Glass, 2000), conditions which are seldom applica-\nble because of hectic and at times chaotic prevailing field\nconditions in conflict or postconflict settings.\nReports from clinical work conducted in recent war sce-\nnarios, where local populations were exposed to massive\ntraumatic experiences--such as in Sri Lanka--indicate that\nmeaning and narrative associated with trauma-related symp-\ntoms are culturally embedded (Somasundaram & Sivayokan,\n2013) and further complicated by the often-neglected issues\nof history, identity, power, and gender. Local practitioners\nare fully aware of these intricate complexities, while foreign\nexperts, clinicians, and first responders most often recruited\nand trained elsewhere remain oblivious to these issues.\nMoreover, the clinical management of trauma-related com-\nplaints among different cultures from our own, present clini-\ncians with complex problems and demand clinical decisions\nthat are extremely challenging. As symptoms are embedded\nin local systems of meaning and specific cultural explanatory\nframeworks, clinicians may have difficulties in understand-\ning reactions and patients' explanatory models, healing prac-\ntices, and coping behaviors. The clinical interpretation of\nthese interactive systems requires a solid knowledge of the\nlocal culture and their language, and the native taxonomies,\nincluding the local idioms of distress, local attributions of\ncausality, and healing traditions (Abramowitz, 2010;\nNevertheless, despite the many limitations and constraints\nencountered in the literature reviewed, a number of\napproaches and actions were revealed as desirable or poten-\ntially useful in leading to best practices. The psychosocial\ninterventions that were reported as beneficial were most\noften associated with the following features: (a) a primary\nconcern in identifying those persons at risk and in greatest\nneed for service (screening); (b) an implicit commitment to\navoid inflicting further damage, while ensuring minimal dis-\nruption of existing (and still sufficient) coping and protective\ninfluences; (c) gaining in-depth insight, identifying specific\ncultural resources at the local level: local idioms of distress,\nhealing practices (i.e., therapeutic rituals), and ways of cop-\ning with distress (i.e., symbolic as well as culturally signifi-\ncant ways of restoring social cohesion, religious practices,\netc.); (d) building on the existing endogenous resources (i.e.,\nkey informants, healers, religious traditions, etc.) rather than\nexclusive reliance on external solutions of poor social rele-\nvance and cultural consonance; and (e) promoting empower-\nment using participatory action research approaches, where\nthe community of actors and survivors is involved from the\nearly stages of every assessment and/or intended action or\nproposition for strengthening social cohesion and increasing\nresiliency, including the provision of psychological support.\nThe systematic and focused review of the literature (see,\nStepakoff etal., 2006) clearly shows improved or better men-\ntal health outcomes when community resources and survivors\nwere involved in the decisions regarding the support to be\noffered, Western and non-Western local cultural practices\nwere sensitively combined, and activation and mobilization of\nlocal social support networks such as symbolic restoration of\ncollective processes (i.e., for bereavement and grieving) were\nachieved, accompanied by the more general psychosocial sup-\nport, including follow-up at later stages.\nIn a recently published book on Tamil populations in\nNorthern Sri Lanka, Somasundaram (2014) makes a compel-\nling case in favor of indigenous coping strategies and cultur-\nally mediated protective factors like rituals, funerals, and\nreligious ceremonies, as crucial sources of collective\nstrength, support, and meaning. Culture-specific relaxation\ntechniques, such as the use of meaningful words according to\ndifferent religions (Hindu, Buddhist, Islam, Catholic, etc.),\ncombined with meditation, breathing exercises, andAyurveda\nor Siddha oil massages and muscular relaxation, represent\nculture-specific powerful tools for healing massive trauma\nand strengthening positive resilience and collective coping\nstrategies among the Tamils.\nOther additional measures which may be considered no\nless important, but complementary to the best practices\npointed above, have been postulated by Hobfoll and collabo-\nrators (2007) under the general title of \"best intervention\npractices,\" aimed at strengthening stress management and\npromote resiliency, as well as a series of supportive measures\nto restore the sense of safety, calm, self- and collective effi-\ncacy, connectedness, and hope (Hobfoll etal., 2007). Some\nbut not all of these practices were used in the reviewed litera-\nture (see, for example, Agani etal., 2010; Anckermann etal.,\nFinally, the discrepancies that have been made evident\nbetween some of the \"recommended\" best practices and the\nimperatives of conducting psychosocial interventions and\nclinical work on the ground arise from the vast divide exist-\ning between researchers, academic psychiatrists, and front-\nline clinicians (Litz & Gibson, 2006). Moreover, it becomes\napparent that there is a crucial imbalance in the reviewed\nstudies to effectively bridge the gulf that exists between\nresearch and action, or in other words between \"what is\nknown and what is done in practice, between scientific\nachievements and health realization\" (Pang, Pablos-\nLimitations of the Study\nThe potential for selection bias in this literature review is\nacknowledged. A large number of humanitarian assistance\ninitiatives conducted by multilateral and bilateral agencies,\nincluding international agencies, governments, and NGOs,\nare at risk of being underrepresented in our review.\nAssessments and research findings generated by such orga-\nnizations are most often to be found in the gray literature, in\nnonindexed reports, or on websites or other media. Children,\nrefugees, veterans, and the military were excluded and there-\nfore are not at all represented in our review.\nThe results that are published in peer-reviewed journals\nare mostly interventions funded and conducted by foreign\nnationals, with variable support and actual engagement of\nlocal practitioners or researchers, which introduces the risk\nof bias in detriment of the latter. Consequently, there is a lack\nof recognition of existing local knowledge production and\ndissemination efforts by practitioners and researchers from\nLMICs, who are also underrepresented. The insufficient or\nlimited participation of local practitioners and researchers\nmay explain the limited follow-up and poor sustainability of\nmost initiatives reviewed here.\nFinally, as shown above, because some studies were\nunclear as to the methodology or research design used,\nlacked details on the content and duration of the interven-\ntions, and did not specify the training received and degree of\nprofessionalization of participating health workers and prac-\ntitioners, the risks of misinterpretation remain moderate to\nhigh. At the same time, this also points to the fact that inno-\nvative approaches to research, capacity building, and\nknowledge translation are needed to achieve effective and\nsustainable psychosocial interventions in contexts affected\nby armed conflict and war.\nConcluding Remarks\nTo summarize our main findings, we would like to raise four\nkey issues of critical importance when considering psycho-\nsocial interventions and searching for best practices in con-\nflict and postconflict situations.\nFirst, while the concept of trauma in a given population\nafter exposure to traumatic events appears to be universal, it\nhas been described and experienced in many different ways\nacross cultures and specific populations throughout the past\nfew decades (Hinton & Good, 2015b). The metamorphosis\nand the ever-expanding and inclusive definition of the trauma\nconstruct have made the objective assessment of its exis-\ntence problematic and one should exercise caution when try-\ning to measure its occurrence and persistence over time in a\ngiven population. This \"over inclusiveness\" has been criti-\ncized by practitioners who point to the importance of distin-\nguishing between what constitutes a normal versus an\nabnormal or pathological reaction to experienced life threat-\nThe review of the literature shows that most interventions\nconducted in conflict and postconflict settings are bound to\nmiss, distort, or transform the local idioms of the victims\nwhile translating local expressions into professional lan-\nguages of complaint and restitution, which in turn are appro-\npriated by donors and humanitarian organizations for\npolitical and moral purposes (Kleinman, Das, & Lock, 1997).\nSecond, as it has been stated by Shalev (2006), the inter-\nface between \"stress theory\" and the theories of \"psychologi-\ncal trauma\" has not been convincingly articulated. This have\ncreated additional ambiguities when distinguishing distress\nfrom disorder and introduced competing and even contradic-\ntory diagnostic and treatment practices, which are evident in\nthe implementation gaps noted above. There is little doubt\nthat the complexity of mass trauma and its aftermath, as well\nas the relative lack of theorization, have both hindered the\nquality of responses and efficacy of the interventions and\ntherefore remained an obstacle to the emergence of best\npractices for wider application. First, responders and the\nmedical and allied professions are still confronted with a lack\nof sound theoretical platform that would provide a rationale\nfor the link between exposure, the psychosocial mechanism,\nand the end point of interest, introducing uncertainties and\nconstraints in the model of clinical practice, as well as in the\nindividual and collective interventions derived from it\nThird, our review of the qualitative literature ratifies to a\nlarge extent, what has been reported by Tol, Barbui, etal.\n(2011) in their meta-analysis of RCTs conducted in humani-\ntarian settings, that most interventions had no reliable base-\nline data against which to measure progress, lacked specific\noutcome measures for assessing effectiveness, and did not\nspecify length of time between exposure to traumatic experi-\nences, initiation, and duration of treatment, thus limiting the\nanalysis and interpretation of the findings. The various inter-\nvention designs reviewed here failed to specify the interven-\ntion target and expected outcomes in unambiguous terms and\ntherefore both outcomes and impact remained difficult to\nassess systematically. Under these conditions, it is unlikely\nthat some of the reviewed psychosocial interventions left\nbehind a significant and durable impact on current local\ninterventions and the model of clinical practice.\nFourth, the collected qualitative evidence does not sup-\nport a specific intervention model nor a set of standardized\nbest practices but reiterates the need for psychosocial inter-\nventions to remain flexible and adaptable to the prevailing\nsocial and cultural context and specific circumstances of the\nmassive traumatic experience (Hobfoll etal., 2007; Shalev,\nthe literature review shows some promising pathways to fol-\nlow, which may incrementally contribute to build-up empiri-\ncal evidence for more efficacious, compassionate, and\nsustainable interventions across the response chain. These\ninclude devising more sensitive tools for screening, early\ndetection, and treatment of those in need, discarding \"man-\ndatory\" Western-driven interventions, which are irrelevant,\nunwelcomed, or not required (\u00d8rner & Schnyder, 2003). We\nneed to develop culturally appropriate interventions, includ-\ning local practices to promote resilience and strengthen the\nprocess of natural healing and coping mechanisms, as well as\nfocus our attention on both primary and secondary preven-\ntion domains, which are most often missing.\nAll of these key issues need careful consideration to\ndevelop preventive measures and early interventions for\nreducing chronicity and the overall burden of illness among\nsurvivors. In addition, in the mid- and long term, we need to\nmove beyond the narrow psychological scope to restore the\nsense of safety, equity, and justice, while promoting agency\nand social cohesion among survivors. Aiming to normaliza-\ntion and resumption of everyday life, with the ultimate aim\nof reconstructing the social tissue, while, reducing inequali-\nties, addressing social injustices, and rebuilding of local\neconomies, appears to be the most appropriate course of\naction to prevent recurrent and endemic conflict and improve\nthe overall mental health status of the affected populations.\nOverall, the findings reported in this review are to some\nextent unexpected and may resonate well with scholars who\nhave criticized a strictly medicalized model of care, by sys-\ntematically offering psychiatric counseling and psychologi-\ncal support to people who have been exposed to traumatic\nexperiences despite they may not be in need of professional\ncare or assistance (Almedom & Summerfield, 2004; Jones,\n2002). At the same time, it should reinforce the need for fur-\nther research and innovation in the delivery of psychosocial\nsupport for those who just claim that the current responses\nare a rather insufficient or an \"imperfect offering,\" dispro-\nportionate to the magnitude of social suffering, despair and\nhopelessness survivors of mass trauma are confronted with\nThe future global mental health research agenda should\nbe focusing not only on the short-term impact but also the\nlong-term impact on those exposed to intentional and pro-\ntracted violence and traumatic events. We need to move\nbeyond cross-sectional studies and refocus our attention to\nprioritize research on naturalistic and longitudinal studies of\nthe clinical trajectory of posttraumatic adaptation as well as\nrisk and resilience factors involved, acknowledging the mul-\ntiple outcomes of trauma exposure. Moreover, we need to\ncontinue searching for new ways of preventing violence and\nconflict, reduce its sequelae and the short- as well as long-\nterm health burden, while addressing social inequalities and\npressing issues of social justice.\nFinally, turning to the general area of intervention research\nin conflict and postconflict settings, the growing multidisci-\nplinarity of research teams, the diversity of research para-\ndigms and approaches, as well as the tensions between\nfrontline health workers and clinicians, humanitarian agen-\ncies, donors, and researchers represent some of the main\nchallenges to conducting intervention research. These issues\nneed to be specifically addressed, especially in resource-poor\ncountries with ethical and cultural frames of reference differ-\ning from Eurocentric Western paradigms.\nIn this focused and systematic literature review, we con-\nclude that in spite of the many discrepancies and inconsisten-\ncies found, there is an emergent literature of positive\nempirical evidence being accumulated, derived not only\nfrom RCTs and meta-analysis but also from observational\nand qualitative studies, case reports, and community-based\nstudies, including specialized reports and guidelines. There\nis sufficient critical input derived from these studies to sup-\nport the continuing assessment, revision, and refinement of\ncurrent and future guidelines for best practices in the provi-\nsion of psychosocial care. This process of knowledge trans-\nfer should follow a rigorous scientific design and careful\nassessment of mental health outcomes, and subject to sys-\ntematic field testing prior to its application. The ultimate aim\nwould be not only the strengthening of humanitarian assis-\ntance policies and programs and improved psychosocial care\nfor civilian populations in conflict and postconflict settings\nbut should result in increasing the value and reducing the\nwaste of psychosocial intervention research prevailing today.\n"
