As\nin children, core features of adult ADHD include \ninattention,\nimpulsivity, distractibility, and/or hyperactivity (2). Adults\nwith ADHD commonly report procrastination, boredom\nintolerance, \nfrustration intolerance, disorganization, affect\ndysregulation, and heightened emotional reactivity (3).\nAdults with ADHD also have elevated rates of arrest histo-\nries, poor \nacademic performance, depression, anxiety, traffic\naccidents, occupational problems, tobacco use, and substance\nabuse (4). Less research has explored health problems associ-\nated with ADHD.\nObesity affects 31% of the US population (5) and certain\nmental disorders predict greater risk for obesity-related\n\ndisease. Mental disorders characterized by appetite and/or\naffect dysregulation such as binge eating disorder (BED) (6)\nand depression (7) have been the primary targets of study.\nHowever, a few studies have revealed rates of ADHD in\nweight treatment-\nseeking adults 5\u00ad15 times higher than rates\nin population samples (8\u00ad11). Whether ADHD is linked to\nincreased risk for obesity in the general adult population has\nnot yet been explored.\nADHD may be linked to obesity in children. One study found\nnearly twice as high as the general population in that age range.\nConsistent findings were reported in a study of children aged\n8\u00ad17 years who were hospitalized for obesity. Over half (57.7%)\nmet DSM-IV criteria for ADHD (8). A study of children aged\n3\u00ad18 years with ADHD, 29% were at risk for overweight (BMI\ntile) (12), which is two and three times higher than the \ngeneral\npopulation, respectively. Finally, a population-based study\nthose with ADHD symptomatology were 1.4 times as likely to\nbe obese than lean (13).\nAssociation Between Adult Attention\nDeficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Obesity\nin the US Population\nSherry L.

One study of obese patients seeking weight\nloss treatment revealed 27.4% met diagnostic criteria for\nADHD, a rate six times greater than what has been reported\nin the general population (9). Patients with ADHD also had\nsignificantly higher BMIs and lost significantly less weight\nduring weight loss treatment than those without ADHD.\nSimilar findings were reported in a study of 75 severely obese\nwomen referred for weight loss treatment. About 27% reported\nsymptoms of ADHD in both childhood and adulthood (10).\nFindings from these clinic-based studies suggest an associa-\ntion between adult ADHD and obesity. Population studies are\nneeded because rates of psychiatric disorders are typically\ninflated in clinic samples. Also, the extent to which depression\nand BED account for the relationship between ADHD and\nobesity should be explored given that each is independently\nof the present study was to examine the association between\nADHD and risk for overweight and obesity, and the degree to\nwhich the association is accounted for by depression and BED\namong adults sampled from the general US population.\nMethods And Procedures\nThe Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Studies (CPES),\n\nsponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health, include three\nnationally \nrepresentative surveys of US adults. These surveys were\ndesigned to provide epidemiologic data regarding mental \ndisorders\nusing standardized diagnostic criteria. The three surveys include the\nNational Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), the National\nStudy of American Life (NSAL), and the National Latino and Asian\nAmerican Study of Mental Health (17). Although independent\nsurveys, the CPES were designed to allow combining of the three\ndatasets by having shared scientific objectives, measurement tools,\nimplementation procedures, and sampling methodologies (18).\nThe core CPES questionnaire was based on the World Health\nOrganization's expanded version of the Composite International\nDiagnostic Interview. The present study included only the NCS-R\nand the NSAL because the National Latino and Asian American\nStudy of Mental Health did not assess ADHD.\nThe NCS-R was a cross-sectional survey designed to provide repre-\nsentative data of the noninstitutionalized population of English-speaking\na four-stage probability sampling method, first sampling Metropolitan\nStatistical Areas and counties, then area segments, followed by housing\nunits within the area segments, and finally eligible respondents within\nthe housing units (18,19). The recruitment method included a mailed\nintroductory letter and study brochure followed by a household visit\nby a trained interviewer to identify eligible respondents and provide\ninformed consent. The survey consisted of face-to-face computer-assisted\npersonal interviews. The interview included two parts. Part 1 included\nthe core diagnostic assessment of all 9,282 persons participating in the\nrespondents, including all who met lifetime diagnosis of a disorder and\na probability sample of all other respondents. Part 2 included questions\nrelated to disorders of secondary interest. Diagnostic questions for\nADHD were included in Part 2, and were asked only of persons aged\nThe NSAL was a cross-sectional survey conducted between 2001\nand 2003 that targeted English-speaking US adults who self-identified\nand non-Hispanic whites living in predominantly black neighbor-\nhoods (n = 891). A sampling method similar to that of the NCS-R\nwas used (18,20). Interviewers made household visits to obtain\n\nconsent and complete the computer-assisted personal interview. The\n\nmajority of CAPIs (86%) were completed face-to-face and the remain-\ning by phone. The response rate was 71.5%. The entire sample (n =\n6,082) completed all components of the computer-assisted personal\n\ninterview. Analyses were restricted to respondents aged 18\u00ad44 years\n(n = 3,538) to be consistent with the NCS-R. Analyses were performed\nThe analytic sample for this study included 6,735 respondents aged\nthe NCS-R, only a randomly selected sub-sample completed questions\nanalyses including the BED variable were conducted only among 5,210\ndata were missing at random, imputation methods for missing data were\nnot performed. This study was approved by the University of Massachu-\nsetts Medical School Institutional Review Board.\nMeasures\nRespondents self-reported their height and weight as part of the core\ninterview. BMI was calculated using the standard formula (weight\nin kilograms/height in meters squared). BMI was included in the\nCPES as a recoded six category variable: underweight (BMI 18.4);\nobesity (BMI 40.0). For the purposes of the present study, we\nrecorded BMI into a three category variable: normal/underweight,\noverweight, and obese.\nAs described elsewhere (1), childhood ADHD was assessed using a ret-\nrospective version of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for DSM-IV (21).\nRespondents who reported six or more symptoms of inattention or hyper-\nactivity were administered follow-up questions regarding the remaining\nDSM-IV criteria. If a respondent met criteria for childhood ADHD, they\nwere then asked whether problems persisted to the present. Clinical reap-\npraisal interviews were performed by clinical interviewers on a subsample\nof participants using the Adult ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale (22,23),\nthe ADHD Rating Scale (24), and an adaptation of the ADHD Rating\nScale. Respondents were diagnosed with adult ADHD if they endorsed\nsix or more symptoms of either inattention or hyperactivity within the\nlast six months (DSM-IV Criterion A), two or more Criterion A symp-\ntoms before age seven (Criterion B), impairment in two or more areas of\nliving within the past 6 months (Criterion C), and clinically significant\nimpairment in at least one of these areas (Criterion D). No attempt was\nmade to operationalize DSM-IV diagnostic hierarchy rules (Criterion E).\nInter-rater reliability for diagnosis was 0.78. The clinical reappraisal sub-\nsample was weighted to be representative of the US population in the age\nrange of the sample (18\u00ad44 years). A detailed description of the clini-\ncal reappraisal procedures is reported elsewhere (1,19). We grouped the\nADHD diagnoses into three mutually exclusive categories: never met\ndiagnostic criteria, met full childhood criteria with no current symp-\ntoms (childhood ADHD), and met full childhood criteria with current\nsymptoms (adult ADHD).\nMajor depressive disorder was diagnosed using the Composite Interna-\ntional Diagnostic Interview. Diagnoses were based on DSM-IV criteria.\nTwo non-overlapping probability samples were selected, one to com-\nplete a clinical reappraisal interview to evaluate lifetime diagnoses, and a\n\nsecond to complete a clinical reappraisal interview to evaluate 12-month\ndiagnoses. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (25) was used\nfor clinical reappraisal. Respondents were classified using three mutu-\nally exclusive categories: lifetime (meeting criteria for a major depressive\ndisorder at some point during their life), past 12 months (meeting criteria\nat some point in the past year), or never having met criteria.\nThe Composite International Diagnostic Interview was also used to\nassign diagnosis of BED; however, although DSM-IV requires binges\nto persist for 6 months, the Composite International Diagnostic\nInterview required only 3 months. In the present study, respond-\nents were classified into three categories: (i) lifetime, meeting cri-\nteria for BED at some point during their life; (ii) past 12 months,\narticles\nepidemiology\n\nmeeting criteria at some point in the past year; or (iii) never having\nmet criteria.\nRespondents were asked to bring in medication bottles for all\n\nmedications and medication status was recorded. Because use of\n\nstimulants and antidepressants could potentially influence the results,\nthe presence/absence of each medication type was dummy coded and\nentered as covariates in the analyses. Antidepressants were coded in two\nways: those with a weight gain side effect and all others. Demographic\nfactors assessed included age, gender, race/ethnicity and education level,\nand smoking status.\nStatistical analysis\nDistributions of BMI categories according to major depressive dis-\norder, BED, and ADHD status were compared using 2 statistics.\nMultinomial logistic regression was used to determine the odds of\noverweight and obesity compared to normal BMI among persons\nwith childhood ADHD and adult ADHD compared to those with\nno ADHD. A crude model was computed followed by a multivari-\nate model adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and\n\nsmoking status. To explore the possible impact of major depressive\ndisorder and BED on the association between ADHD and BMI,\nmediation models were conducted via methods developed by Baron\nand Kenny (26). Accordingly, mediation may be present if the fol-\nlowing four criteria are met: (i) the independent variable (ADHD) is\nassociated with the outcome (BMI), (ii) the independent variable is\nassociated with the hypothesized mediator (major depressive disorder\nand BED), (iii) the mediator is associated with the outcome, control-\nling for the independent variable, and (iv) the association between\nthe independent variable and the outcome variable becomes attenu-\nated or not statistically different from zero when controlling for the\nmediator. Mediation models were derived separately for BED and\nmajor depressive disorder. Each model controlled for demographic\nfactors and smoking status. Although originally proposed for longitu-\ndinal designs, mediational methods (26) may also be valid for cross-\n\nsectional data, although inferences of causality are limited (27).\nThe CPES dataset included respondent sampling probability weights to\nallow inference to the general US population of 18\u00ad44 years. The weights\ntook into consideration the multi-stage sampling methods used in each\nstudy and the over-sampling of Part I NCS-R respondents for Part II\nof the questionnaire. Weights for individual datasets and combinations\nof datasets were included. The analyses use weights for the combined\nNCS-R Part II and NSAL dataset.\nResults\nSample description\nThe mean age of the sample was 31-years old (s.e. = 0.25),\nblack and 7.4% Asian or other race, reflecting the population\nweighting of the data.

Results revealed\nthat having adult ADHD increased the odds of being over-\nweight and obese. Among individuals with adult ADHD, 33.9%\n21.6% respectively, of individuals with no history of ADHD.\nPast year or lifetime history of major depression did not affect\nthese associations; however, past year BED mediated the asso-\nciations between ADHD and both overweight and obesity.\nFindings might suggest mechanistic overlap between ADHD\nand obesity, which has been alluded to elsewhere (28,29).\nOne possible neurobiological mechanism is that both ADHD\nand obesity are linked to hypo-dopaminergic function in the\nbrain (30). In ADHD, hypo-dopaminergic function influ-\nences the prefrontal cortex, which is important for sustaining\nand dividing attention as well as inhibiting distraction (31).\nDopamine is also central to appetite regulation. Risk \ntaking,\nsubstance abuse, and eating pathology have been \nassociated\nwith DRD2 receptor dysfunction (32). Both ADHD and\nobesity have been characterized by deficiencies in the DRD2\nreceptors (28,32). Davis et al. (29) have suggested that because\npalatable energy-dense foods are known to activate dopamine\npathways, overeating among individuals with ADHD may\nbe an attempt at self-medication. Self-medicating behavior in\nADHD including alcohol and other substance abuse has been\nADHD symptoms might have implications for weight\n\nregulation. ADHD has been characterized as a problem of\nbehavioral disinhibition affecting memory, motivation, and\nself-regulation of affect (36). As a result, an individual with\nADHD might fail to plan meals ahead of time, frequently\nskip meals due to distractions, and/or lose sight of intentions\nto moderate food intake. Difficulties with sustaining complex\nbehaviors have been seen in persons with ADHD and are most\nnotable when there is no immediate gratification involved (37).\nWeight regulation is exceedingly difficult, requiring a great\ndeal of behavioral inhibition in light of the current obesogenic\nenvironment (29), and would seem especially challenging for\nindividuals with ADHD.\nA diagnosis of BED in the previous year mediated the rela-\ntionship between adult ADHD and obesity. Adults with ADHD\nhave difficulty regulating their emotions, and such \ndifficulties\nmay lead to eating reactively in response to unpleasant moods.\nFindings are also consistent with a study that revealed that\nADHD symptoms were associated with eating in response to\nnegative moods and environmental cues, as well as binge eating\n(29). Dysregulated eating could be a potential pathway between\nADHD and obesity. The present study is the first population-\nbased study revealing a comorbidity between ADHD and BED.\nThe present study has several limitations. Height and weight\nwere assessed via self-report, leading to underreporting due\nto social desirability biases (38). Features of ADHD such as\nimpulsivity and distractibility might result in less frequent self-\nweighing and therefore less accurate self-reports in those with\nADHD. Infrequent self-weighing could lead to underestimated\nself-reports because weight tends to increase over time. Both\npotential sources of misclassification would bias the associa-\ntion between ADHD and obesity toward the null. Also, BMI\nwas only available as a categorical variable in the CPES dataset.\nThere are limitations to the diagnostic measure of adult ADHD\nas discussed elsewhere (1) including reliance on DSM-IV cri-\nteria for ADHD which were developed for children, and that\ndirect evaluation was performed on a reappraisal subsample\nwith imputations performed for the remaining cases. However,\nno standard clinical evaluation of adult ADHD currently exists.\nAnother limitation is that although we test the mediating\neffect of depression and BED, causality cannot be \nestablished\nin cross-sectional studies. Despite the large total sample size,\nthe prevalence of conditions under study was low making it\ndifficult to assess interactions of major depressive disorder\nand BED on the association between ADHD and BMI or the\n\ninfluence of ADHD subtypes on risk for obesity.\nResults suggest that ADHD is linked to both obesity and\nBED in the US adult population. The presence of ADHD\nin overweight and obese patients has clinical implications,\nincluding difficulty with behavioral weight management skills\nsuch as self-monitoring, meal planning, and adhering to nutri-\ntion and physical activity goals. Given that BED mediated the\n\nassociation between ADHD and obesity, dysregulated eating\npatterns among adults with obesity and ADHD should be\nstudied further.\n"
