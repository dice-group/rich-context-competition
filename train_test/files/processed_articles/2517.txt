Although care management services can improve these\noutcomes [2], these services depend upon the availability of health\nprofessionals to provide between-visit monitoring and patient\neducation [3]. Mobile health (mHealth) services, including interactive\nvoice response (IVR) calls in which patients respond to automated\nprompts, may help address these barriers to effective care management\nSupport from informal caregivers also might improve diabetes\noutcomes. However, these support persons usually lack formal tools\nfor monitoring patients' health status and providing as-needed\nguidance [6], and they are at risk for burnout due to their caregiving\nburden [6,7]. Moreover, many patients live alone, with up to 7 million\nAmericans receiving \"long-distance\" caregiving [8]. While some\npatients have a geographically-distant support person, these caregivers\nusually receive infrequent and insufficiently-detailed updates about the\npatient's diabetes health status [9].\nIn response to these problems, we developed the mHealth system to\nautomatically provide weekly telemonitoring of diabetes patients. This\nservice also provides as-needed problem-tailored education to\npatients, and notifies their health care teams when patients experience\nsignificant difficulties. Finally, it provides a patient-designated\ncaregiver (the CarePartner, CP) with structured updates about the\npatient's status and as-needed guidance on supporting the patients'\nself-management. The results of a six-month patient preference trial\nindicate that this system provides clinical information that is reliable,\nvalid, and actionable [10]. Most scheduled IVR calls were completed,\nand attrition rate was only 13%. Importantly, patients became less\nlikely over time to report: (a) poor medication adherence, (b)\nabnormally high or low self-monitored glucose values, and (c)\nproblems with either monitoring their glucose or checking their feet\n[11]. After intervention, improvements were seen in long term\nmedication adherence, physical functioning, depressive symptoms,\nand diabetes specific distress [12]. Finally, among initially\nnonadherent patients who opted to involve a CarePartner support\nperson, adherence was significantly more improved than it was among\nthose who participated alone [13].\nProtocol Open Access\nJ Clin Trials\nBased on these encouraging preliminary results, we are now\nconducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Our primary\nhypothesis is that, relative to usual care alone, the mHealth system\n(mHealth+CP) improves the primary outcomes of glycemic control\nand diabetes related distress. We will also evaluate its potential benefits\nto the secondary outcomes of diabetes self-management, health-\nrelated quality of life, systolic blood pressure, and caregiver\nrelationships.\nMethods\nEligibility and recruitment\nIn order to participate, patients must: have type 2 DM\n(hospitalization or outpatient visit within 12 months for >2 ICD9\nyears' problem list), and be in poor glycemic control as indicated by a\nrecent HbA1c% >7.5%. Additionally, they were required to be  21\nyears of age; fluent in English, able to use a telephone touchpad; and\nable to identify an eligible CP. We exclude patients who are either in\npalliative care, on a transplant waitlist, at high risk for 1-year\nmortality, as well as those who screen positive for significant cognitive\nimpairment or an unstable psychiatric condition. Patients are being\nidentified from four community clinics. We search sites' electronic\nhealth records for patients who meet the first two criteria, and recruit\nthese patients using an introductory letter followed by telephone\nscreening to verify their eligibility. We obtain their written informed\nconsent in person during a research visit to their usual clinic.\nPatients are asked to nominate from one to four potential CPs.\nThey then rate each on a validated measure of social support (Norbeck\nSocial Support Questionnaire [NSSQ]) [14] to identify the most\nsupportive nominee for recruitment. (but within the continental US),\ncommunicate regularly with the patient (in person or by phone), have\na working home or mobile telephone number, be able to access to the\ninternet and communicate via e-mail, be free of psychiatric or\ncognitive impairment, be fluent in English, and be  21 years of age.\nAfter they provide verbal informed consent, eligible CPs are mailed\ninformation about the study along with a DVD-based training on\nsupportive communication. .\nPatient assessments\nClinical staff measure glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c, primary\noutcome) with the Siemens DCA Vantage Analyzer, which analyzes a\ndrop of fingertip capillary blood. If an enrolled patient cannot return\nto the clinic for follow-up HbA1c testing we use a mail-in testing kit\n(CoreMedica Laboratories). All self-report measures are being\nadministered over the phone by research staff. We measure diabetes\nrelated distress with the Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS), which has\ngood evidence of validity and reliability [15]. We measure the quality\nof the patient's relationship with their CP by asking patients to report\nthe frequency of communicating with their CP over the past two\nmonths, and their subjective evaluations of these discussions (feeling\nunderstood, comfort with self-disclosing, confidence in CP's ability to\nhelp, etc.) and perceptions of their CP's caregiving burden and stress\nlevel. Additionally, we are assessing patients' emotional response to\ntheir CP (e.g., appreciation, affection, indebtedness, frustration guilt,\netc), and the content of discussions with their CP (DM self-\nmanagement, medication use, appointment keeping, and other DM-\nrelated behavioral goals). We measure general physical and mental\nfunctioning with the Medical Outcome Study 12-Item Short Form\n(SF-12) [16], which is reliable and has been validated for use with\ndiabetes patients [17]. From SF-12 data we calculate the Physical\nComposite Score (PCS) and Mental Composite Score (MCS) for\nanalysis as secondary outcomes. We are measuring the frequency of\ndiabetes self-management behaviors (healthy eating, exercise, and\nglucose testing) with the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities\n(SDSCA) [18]. Evidence indicates its reliability, sensitivity to change,\nand convergence with other behavioral measures [18,19]. We assess\nmedication adherence with the Brief Medication Questionnaire\n90% sensitive to sporadic skipping [19], together with the reliable and\nwell-validated Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS) [20,21].\nWe measure the supportiveness of the CP using the Norbeck Social\nSupport Questionnaire (described above) [14]. We measure depressive\nsymptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9) [22].\nHealth literacy is being assessed by the Test of Functional Health\nLiteracy (Adults) [23]. Finally, we are using standard items to measure\npatients' age, gender, marital status, race/ethnicity, level of education,\nand yearly household income. All of these measures are administered\nat baseline, Month 6, and Month 12, except that sociodemographic\ndata are collected only at Baseline.\nCaregiver assessments\nWe are using single items to assess type and frequency of\ninteractions with the patient and between the CP and any in-home\ninformal caregivers. Portions of the Picot Rewards Scale [24] and\nCaregiver Reciprocity Scale [25] are being used to assess frustration,\nrespect, and conflict resolution. Caregiver relationship quality and\nsupport self-efficacy are assessed among caregivers by rewording\nselected items from the patient measures. We measure caregiver\nburden using the Modified Caregiver Strain Index, which has good\nreliability and validity [26]. Following the methods of Langa et al., [27]\nwe calculate caregiving opportunity costs using selected items from the\nChronic Illness and Caregiving Survey [28].\nAncillary data sources\nWe measure outpatient services, hospitalizations, and medication\nuse from site-specific administrative databases and patient self-report\nover six-month periods, from which we can estimate costs.\nIntervention costs include the costs of research personnel, supplies,\noverhead expenses and training costs. Facility based data are being\nused to estimate overhead costs, capital expenditures and telephone\ncharges. Medical comorbidity will be measured from patients' problem\nlists using Deyo's modified Charlson Comorbidity Index [29].\nTelephone contact between patients and clinicians is quantified from\nrecords and online logs. Our automated calling system provides data\non the outcomes of automated call attempts, e-mails, alerts, logins, and\npostings.\nRandomization\nAfter baseline assessment, we randomize patient-CP pairs to\nintervention (mHealth+CP) or usual care, with a 1:1 allocation ratio\nbased upon permuted blocking by clinical site.\nmHealth+CP intervention arm\nDuring each week that an IVR call is scheduled, the system makes\nup to three attempts to contact each patient on up to three different\npatient-selected day/time combinations (i.e., up to nine attempts per\nCitation: Piette JD, Sen A, Aikens JE (2014) Randomized Controlled Trial of mHealth Telemonitoring with Enhanced Caregiver Support for\nJ Clin Trials\nweek). Calls follow tree-structured algorithms and last between 5 and\n10 minutes, during which patients respond to questions about the past\nweek (using their telephone touchtone keypad) and hear messages that\ngive self-management messages based on the patient's responses. The\ncontent of questions and feedback messages was developed with input\nfrom experts on diabetes self-management, primary care services, and\nmHealth service design. Queries focus on symptoms of hypoglycemia\nand hyperglycemia, performance of fasting self-monitoring of blood\nglucose (SMBG), any SMBG results <90 mg/dL, hypoglycemia self-\ntreatment, three or more instances of SMBG in the prior week with\nresults > 300 mg/dL, possession of at least a two-week supply of\nantihypergycemic medication, adherence to antihyperglycemic\nmedication, and foot inspection. If patients report difficulty in any of\nthese areas, the system provides them with pre-recorded self-\nmanagement education specific to that issue. Even if patients do not\nreport any problems, they can still opt to hear self-management\neducational messages on healthy eating, physical activity, and\nmedication adherence. Further details on the content of IVR calls are\navailable from the authors.\nAfter each completed call, patients' CarePartners are automatically\nemailed a summary of the patients' call. If the patient reported self-\nmanagement problems during the call, then the report includes an\nexplanation, structured suggestions for how to support the patient's\nself-management, and an appropriate timeframe for interacting with\nthe patient.\nWhenever patients report a pattern of either abnormal blood\nglucose, abnormal blood pressure, or significant medication\nnonadherence, the system automatically faxes a notification to their\nprimary care team. The thresholds for triggering notifications were\nselected with clinician input to have a low false positive rate, provide\nactionable information, and efficiently use human resources for\nfollow-up without burdening clinicians. Finally, the calling system\nrecords detailed process data such as the outcome of each attempted\ncall which research staff monitor to ensure treatment delivery and\nparticipant engagement.\nEthical approval and public registration\nThis study was approved by Institutional Review Board at the\nUniversity of Michigan, and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov\nData analysis\nPower and sample size: For our main hypothesis, we predict a mean\nwhich is the mean impact of long-term educational and behavioral\ninterventions for poorly-controlled DM per a 2009 Cochrane's Review\n[30]. Per our previously published data [31], we assume a pooled\nstandard deviation (SD) of 1.72 and a 1-year within-subject correlation\nof 0.78. We also assume that mean baseline HbA1c will be 8.5% in\nboth groups, and anticipate this to drop 0.3% in the intervention arm\nby Month 6 and be maintained at that reduced level at Month 12.\nBased upon a two-time repeated measures analysis at alpha=0.025 to\nadjust for two comparisons (Baseline vs. Month 6, and Baseline vs.\nMonth 12), and assuming that controls' HbA1c will remain constant at\nMonths 6 and 12, we estimate that 190 subjects are required per arm to\nprovide 80% power to detect a group by time interaction. Assuming up\ntotal in order to achieve our necessary sample size.\nMissing data: The primary analysis will use only observed data,\nwhereas auxiliary analyses include imputed missing data. We will use\nlogistic regression to model the likelihood of missing data, define\nstrata in which values are missing at random, classify patients using\npropensities, randomly sample from observed distributions, and\nimpute missing data.\nPreliminary data analysis: We will test baseline differences in\nHbA1c, DDS, age, race, gender, etc., and adjust subsequent analyses\naccordingly. We will check the validity of IVR data against\ncorresponding self-report measures. Depending on the results of these\nchecks, we will report significant discrepancies and might adjust\nanalyses for extreme cases and/or measurement error, derive validity\nweights, impute modeled values or drop specific variables.\nHypothesis testing analysis: We will use a linear mixed-model\nanalysis to model HbA1c and DDS scores as a function of group\n(mHealth+CP vs. control) and time (Baseline, 6 months, 12 months).\nWe plan to interpret significant group X time interactions by plotting\nregression lines above and below the moderator median [32].\nAdjustments will be made for potential confounders including design\nfactors (e.g., site, presence of in-home caregiver) and baseline\ncharacteristics. We will use random intercepts to account for\nclustering within time and site. Likelihood ratio tests will be used to\nevaluate nested models. Alternative covariance structures will be\nevaluated using residuals and information criteria statistics. We will\nuse the same approach to evaluate whether mHealth+CP improves the\nsecondary outcomes of diabetes self-management, health-related\nquality of life, systolic blood pressure, and caregiver relationships.\nResults\nWe began recruiting patients in March 2013. To date, we have\nrecruited approximately 130 patient-participants (along with 130 of\ntheir CPs), which is 27% of our targeted sample. Twenty-four\nparticipants have completed their Month 12 assessment. We are\nscheduled to perform interim analyses in May of 2015. Given our\ncurrent recruitment rate, we project that the study will be closed to\nnew accrual by March 2016, and that data collection will be completed\nDiscussion\nAs described above, we are conducting an RCT in community\nclinics to determine the benefits of a mHealth diabetes telemonitoring\nand self-management program that includes a patient-selected support\nperson. The intervention is designed to: (a) monitor patients'\nsymptoms and self-management problems, (b) provide patients with\ntailored messages about diabetes self-management and medical help-\nseeking, (c) generate guidance on self-management support for\npatients' informal caregivers via structured emails, and (d) provide\npatients' clinicians with actionable feedback via faxed updates about\nselected patient-reported health and self-care problems [33].\nIn typical outpatient care, patients seldom receive corrective\nguidance until long after any poor self-management patterns have\nresulted in negative medical consequences. This temporal lag is a\nmajor barrier to behavior change, and can render medical\ninterventions ineffective. Accordingly, the design of our mHealth\nprogram is grounded in the assumption that informal caregivers and\nhealthcare teams will use problem-tailored advice to address emerging\nproblems before they escalate, and prophylactically help the patient to\nimprove their illness self-management behaviors. Automated data\nCitation: Piette JD, Sen A, Aikens JE (2014) Randomized Controlled Trial of mHealth Telemonitoring with Enhanced Caregiver Support for\nJ Clin Trials\ncollection is also a key strategy in our model, because it provides\nroutine \"asynchronous communication\" between the patient and\nothers that does not require their simultaneous availability. Because\npatients' supporters usually also juggle demands from their workplace,\nyoung children, and other sources [34], this flexibility should enhance\nthe intervention's translatability, uptake, and maintenance.\nPotential limitations\nOne noteworthy study limitation might be our inability to isolate\nthe unique additive effect of having a CarePartner above and beyond\nthe well-documented effects of telemonitoring alone. While an\n\"mHealth alone\" condition (without a Care Partner) would have\nprovided this comparison, we have already studied this variation and\nconcluded that having a CP probably improves telemonitoring\noutcomes [10-13]. Therefore, our main objective was to test the\nclinical effectiveness of the aggregated mHealth+CP package rather\nthan determine the efficacy of its subcomponents.\nA second potential limitation is that most of the variables are being\nmeasured by self-report which is prone to recall and social desirability\nreport biases. However, we have previously established that the\nintervention provides information that is reliable and valid [35].\nMoreover, most of the self-report instruments being used have strong\npsychometric characteristics, and three of our outcomes (blood\nglucose, blood pressure, and health care costs) are being assessed\nobjectively. While attrition is often a concern in clinical research, we\ndo not expect substantial dropout. We believe that attrition is being\nminimized by the general patient-centeredness of the calling system\nand its scripts. Patient engagement is probably also enhanced by\nscheduling the calls at each patient's preferred times and making up to\nnine calling attempts per week if needed.\nAnticipated implications\nTo our knowledge, this is the only mHealth intervention that\ninvolves a patient-selected support person. Although we project only\nsmall to moderate effect magnitudes, the intervention is probably\ninexpensive to implement, given that the majority of its costs are\nattributable to development and testing. Therefore, if this approach\nproves effective, then an innovative and sustainable new intervention\ncould potentially be made widely available. Its benefits might include\nnot only improved self-management and medication adherence, but\nalso long term improvements in glycemic control, functional\nimpairment and psychological distress. In sum, this research could\nultimately lead to major public health benefits, especially for\nvulnerable and isolated patients.\nConflicts of Interest\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' Contributions\nAll authors contributed to the design of the study and participated\nin preparing the grant application, JEA and JDP drafted the\nmanuscript, and AS designed the statistical analysis and edited the\ngrant application.\n"
