Pain is a primary reason for the majority of\npeople living with OA to seek treatment (Donovan & Blake,\nof Sanders, Donovan, and Dieppe (2002) on the social sig-\nnificance of OA, \"issues of identity and biography are cen-\ntral to the meanings ascribed to illness and aging\" (p. 247).\nIntervention is often sought for OA once symptoms are \"per-\nceived to interfere with life,\" indicating a need to gain a\ndeeper understanding about how OA pain affects the lives of\nBecause regular physical activity decreases OA pain over\ntime, it is included in clinical practice treatment guidelines\nHowever, therapeutic exercise for OA can acutely increase\npain (Badley & Papageorgiou, 1989; Farrell, Gibson,\nMcMeeken, & Helme, 2000; Focht, Ewing, & Gauvin,\n2002). Therefore, people with OA must decide whether to\nbegin or continue exercise when activity-related pain is\nexpected or occurs. Confusion about the meaning of activity-\nrelated pain can be a barrier to effective treatment (Clarke,\nMoreton, das Nair, Walsh, & Lincoln, 2014); people with OA\nfrequently report fear and avoidance of activity when they\nbelieve that exercise will further damage their joints or activ-\nity is to blame for their condition (Hendry, Williams,\nMarkland, Wilkinson, & Maddison, 2006; Thorstensson,\nRecent work has highlighted the underlying complexities\nassociated with characterizing the relationship between pain,\nfear, and activity avoidance. For example, McCracken and\nSamuel (2007) reported that some patients with chronic pain\nreport both high levels of physical activity and high levels of\nactivityavoidancedependinguponthesituation.Furthermore,\nwork by Kindermans and colleagues (2011) described two\ntypes of avoidance patterns and three types of persistence\npatterns of physical activity in people with chronic pain. The\nneed to individualize self-management programs has been\nemphasized in the literature, due to a growing recognition\nthat both the ability and desire for activity do not necessarily\nremain consistent throughout the life course (Moore,\nRichardson, Sim, Bernard, & Jordan, 2014; Ong, Jinks, &\nMorden, 2011). Based on these complicated findings, greater\nclarification of the contextual and individual factors that\ninfluence activity behavior is needed.\nResearch has only recently begun to consider the role of\nsocial and other contextual factors in the decisions of patients\nwith chronic pain to persist in therapeutic exercise. For\nexample, Mackichan, Adamson, and Gooberman-Hill (2013)\nhighlighted the importance of issues such as the patient's\n1University of Missouri, Columbia, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nAllison Kabel, School of Health Professions, University of Missouri, 511\nEmail: kabela@health.missouri.edu\nOsteoarthritis and Social Embarrassment:\nRisk, Pain, and Avoidance\nAllison Kabel1, Erin Alice Dannecker1, Victoria A.

Also, Torres's\n(2013) research team suggested that \"persistence\" with a\nphysical activity exists to \"avoid\" social disapproval. In\naddition, Graham, Kremer, and Wheeler (2008) described\nhow people with chronic diseases such as arthritis believe\nthat physical activity facilitates maintenance of their\nidentity.\nThe existing literature on identity and personhood can\nalso provide guidance on the role social factors play in cases\nof chronic pain. For example, social identity or personhood\nis \"bestowed by society\" and has to be \"earned by achieving\nand maintaining expected social roles and ideals\" (Luborsky,\ntribute to the \"diminishment of identity as a social person\"\nembarrassment, identity, and pain indicates that medical con-\nditions, which hinder function, occupation, independent liv-\ning, and physical appearance, can diminish an individual's\nsense of self (Hill, Dziedzic, & Ong, 2010; Kaptein et al.,\nSocial identity may be affected by contextual factors,\nsuch as expectations (Moore et al., 2014). Older adult\npatients as well as their health care providers expected\nincreased pain with aging, and may not interpret the OA\njoint pain and stiffness as something requiring medical\nintervention (Grime, Richardson, & Ong, 2010; Hendry et\nal., 2006). These beliefs may negatively affect their pain\nmanagement and motivation for full engagement in activity\n(Davis, Hiemenz, & White, 2002). Cultural and genera-\ntional expectations that go unmet or unrealized can lead to\nthe \"experience of inner chaos and disruption\" (Becker,\nshown to challenge the way people define themselves and\nchange their health-related decision making (Fenwick,\nChaboyer, & St John, 2012). Discrepancies between ideal-\nized and other \"versions\" of oneself can be a source of dis-\ntress among people living with chronic pain and may offer\ninsights into the motivations behind pain-related behavior\n(Huijnen et al., 2011). Similar insights may be gained from\na clearer understanding of how individuals define the con-\ncept of risk, especially as it relates to health-related behav-\nEmbarrassment is the feeling of self-consciousness,\ninadequacy, shame, and awkwardness in social situations or\nin public. Little is known about how embarrassment may\ninfluence physical activity patterns in the context of pain,\nlife disruption, and threats to personhood. To address this,\nwe examined the narratives of 10 people living with OA\nknee pain as part of a larger ongoing mixed-methods proj-\nect. This article focuses on the role that social pressure and\nembarrassment played in their activity-related decision\nmaking.\nMethod\nThis study was part of an ongoing mixed-methods research\nproject, which was approved by our university Institutional\nReview Board to discover and document the relationships\namong OA knee pain, physical activity, and emotions. The\nyears), and 70% of the sample were women, as is appropri-\nate given the increased likelihood and severity of OA in\nwomen (O'Connor, 2007). Ninety percent of the sample\ndescribed themselves as Caucasian. We used the following\ninclusion criteria: (a) 40 years old or older, (b) community\ndwelling, (c) self-reported physician diagnosis of unilateral\nor bilateral knee OA, (d) unilateral or bilateral knee pain\nthat increases with ascending and/or descending stairs, (e)\nrecommended to begin an exercise program by a health care\nprovider, (f) on a stable medication regime for 6 weeks, and\n(g) able to provide a physician clearance to participate in\nlower extremity resistance training. The exclusion criteria\nare the following: (a) unstable medical conditions, (b) hip or\nknee arthroplasty, (c) inability to independently transfer\nwith or without assistive device, (d) wheelchair dependence,\nof Mini-Mental State Examination (Roccaforte, Burke,\nBayer, & Wengel, 1992), (g) regular participation in a lower\nextremity resistance training program within the last year,\n(h) lower extremity intra-articular injections in the previous\n6 months, and (i) regular substance abuse within the previ-\nous 6 months.\nVolunteers who met the above-mentioned inclusion crite-\nria completed three lab visits, which lasted about 2 hr each.\nAt the initial visit, participants provided informed consent\nand completed questionnaires about demographics, health\nhistory, and self-care behaviors, including medications and\noverall physical activity. After the questionnaires were com-\npleted (during first visit), participants were invited to describe\nexperiences that explained or supported their responses to\nthe questionnaires via interview. The second and third lab\nvisits were held with 1 month in between, participants'\nheight, weight, and pressure pain threshold (PPT) were mea-\nsured again and they were asked to repeat the questionnaires\nabout their self-care behavior, physical activity, and knee\npain. In addition, they were asked to recall their knee pain\nfrom previous sessions. Furthermore, they completed five\nphysical activities with activity-specific assessments of\nexpected, actual, and recalled pain, harm, fear, and the prob-\nability that they would repeat the activity if it had been rec-\nommended by a health care provider.\nThe data described here were based on interviews by\ntrained research assistants to explore participants' decision-\nmaking process for appraising the safety of activity-related\nknee pain. These interviews were conducted during the first\nlab visit and were digitally recorded for subsequent tran-\nscription. An investigator (first author) inductively analyzed\nthe interview transcripts to identify and code themes using a\nKabel et al. 3\ngrounded theory (Charmaz, 2006) or constant comparative\nmethod. This thematic analysis produced the key findings\nupon which our study results were based.\nResults\nWhen asked questions about living with OA knee pain, par-\nticularly issues of physical activity, and emotions such as\nfear, frustration, and embarrassment, 6 of the 10 participants\nself-identified as having some type of embarrassment-related\nexperience, usually general embarrassment and frustration\nover their physical limitations due to the OA pain. When\nexplicitly asked about embarrassment, responses fell into\ntwo basic categories: (a) embarrassment-related experience\nfrom engaging in activity or (b) embarrassment-related expe-\nrience from avoiding activity. Within these two categories\nwere nested subgroups of those seeking to avoid embarrass-\nment and those seeking to avoid pain. The term risk is used\nthroughout the \"Results\" section. In these instances, risk\nmeans the chance of exposing oneself to an unfortunate or\nunwelcome outcome (e.g., the risk of social exclusion or the\nrisk of acute physical pain).\nRisk Pain and Embarrassment\nWhen asked about OA knee pain and embarrassment, one\nparticipant shared that she continued to be physically\nactive in her community, although she was concerned that\nothers perceived her as being far older than her chrono-\nlogical age. For her, embarrassment came while \" . . . get-\nting up and down in a restaurant or in church . . . it's like\nI'm 80 years old instead of 52.\" Another woman recalled\nfeeling embarrassment when she attempted to hike on a\nvacation with friends in the American Pacific Northwest\nbut dropped out: \"We were with . . . six other people, close\nfriends that we've known for years, and I really couldn't\nkeep going.\"\nRisk Pain, Avoid Embarrassment\nParticipants also gave examples of persisting with a pain-\nful activity and risking intensifying the pain because of\nsocial pressure or the desire to avoid embarrassment and\ndisapproval, self-imposed or otherwise. Comments such\nas \"Well, I was walking with a couple that came to visit\nand I was really in pain and I just kept going . . . I didn't\nwant to cop out.\" Similarly, this example from a yoga\nenthusiast:\nI was doing yoga last night and there was this awkward position\nand uh I sort of was reluctant and I had a feeling it was something\nI shouldn't be doing but I kind of wanted to fit in and I still did\nit, and uh I mean it wasn't a traumatic injury, but I was a little bit\nsore and just tender and fairly immediately knew that I had\nprobably made a mistake.\nAvoid Pain, Risk Embarrassment\nTwo participants, who were both hikers, reported limiting\neffects of OA knee pain and risking embarrassment to avoid/\nend pain. The first example comes from a participant who\navoided pain by slowing down while hiking, and as a result,\ncould not keep up with her companions. She continued the\nhike but did not feel comfortable pushing herself to keep\npace with her family: \"I couldn't keep up with everyone else\nand felt like I was dragging them behind or they felt like they\nwere with an old woman.\" A second hiking example came\nfrom a participant who accompanied friends to a local hiking\nattraction, only to discover her knee was not up to it:\n. . . I only walked until we got to the first set of stairs and then I\njust stuck around and waited for the rest of the crew to come\nback so, I wasn't even going to try and attempt all those stairs. I\nknew I would never make it.\nAvoid Pain and Embarrassment\nA grandmother shared fears and concerns regarding drop-\nping or falling on her grandchildren due to both hand and\nknee pain. She wished to avoid the pain and embarrassment\nand in this case, possibly harming loved ones, by avoiding\nthis very meaningful activity: \"I'd hate to fall on one of those\nbabies or drop one of them . . . . \" One male participant\nexpressed embarrassment due to his wish that he \" . . . could\nplay (basketball) better . . . I wish I could make the cuts and\njump and you know, rebound.\" He described sitting out and\njust shooting hoops rather than playing basketball with his\nfriends. He engaged in modified activity, not playing as\naggressively as he wanted to, to avoid pain but did not opt\nout of the activity completely.\nDiscussion\nThis study focused on embarrassment in the context of life\ndisruption, physical activity, and personhood in people with\nknee OA. This socially contextualized approach informs our\nperspective of the intersections of identity, risk, and pain.\nParticipants were explicitly asked about embarrassment and\nknee OA, and 6 out of our 10 participants reported some type\nof embarrassment-related experience. They shared that they\nrisked embarrassment by avoiding activity to the disappoint-\nment of themselves or their peers, or they risked embarrass-\nment by engaging in modified or uncompleted activity. These\nparticipants encountered situations where their OA knee pain\nthreatened to disrupt their sense of self and sense of person-\nhood by interfering with or preventing the pursuits and activ-\nities they found meaningful. The participant narratives\nprovided a context to better understand the role of embar-\nrassment within the complex patterns of pain-related physi-\ncal activity. The subgroups of responses, which vary by risk\nand avoidance of pain and physical activity, helped to\n4 SAGE Open\nilluminate the influence of embarrassment within the physi-\ncal activity avoidance and persistence phenomena.\nThe participants revealed both individually as well as\nsocially relevant experiences and frustration [an individual\norientation] and embarrassment [a social orientation] over\nthe OA knee pain, particularly regarding the physical limita-\ntions accompanying the pain. For example, the woman who\nattempted to hike, but was forced to sit idle, as well as the\nparticipant who was concerned about looking \"old\" in church\neach risked both pain and embarrassment by attempting to\nengage in meaningful activities. They had to adjust their\nexpectations of their abilities and themselves. These adjust-\nments described by our participants reflected the findings of\nstudy on hip pain and mobility challenges, and a study on\nchronic pain management barriers by Davis et al. (2002).\nParticipants in these studies reported embarrassment, disap-\npointment about looking \"old,\" self-perceived threats to dig-\nnity and social identity due to pain, compromised mobility,\nand dependence on adaptive devices (Davis et al., 2002; Hill\nof the individuals in our study (e.g., one of the hikers and the\nchurch-goer) did not opt out of physical activities, indicating\na reluctance to count themselves out of meaningful pursuits.\nThis reluctance hints at a larger tension between the abilities\nof the idealized version of themselves and their actual physi-\ncal capacities, as well as the desire to maintain social\nparticipation.\nParticipants who reported persisting with a painful activ-\nity for fear of embarrassment or disapproval mirrored the\npersistent chronic pain patients described by quantitative\ninvestigations in the literature (e.g., Kindermans et al., 2011;\nTorres et al., 2013). Multiple, co-existing interpretations of\nhow chronic pain may disrupt the life course and yet be con-\nsidered a normal or expected part of the aging process have\nbeen documented in previous studies (Sanders et al., 2002).\nFor instance, the behavior of the yoga enthusiast who \" . . .\nhad a feeling it was something I shouldn't be doing but I kind\nof wanted to fit in . . . \" represented a pattern of activity that\nexemplifies the need for context when attempting to interpret\npain-related behavior. Specifically, embarrassment, fear of\ndisapproval, or social exclusion was a motivating factor for\nactivity in specific instances.\nPhysical impairments can result in \" . . . an individual's\nidentity as a complete person [being called] into question\"\nactivity level changes among older adults, Mackichan et al.\n(2013) discovered facets of pain-related behavior that could\nnot be explained by the existing fear avoidance model. The\nfear of losing autonomy and independence influenced the\nactivity level of older adults with chronic pain, often causing\nthem to limit activity and social connectivity in what has\nbeen described as \"paradoxically result[ing] from a desire to\npreserve function\" (Mackichan et al., 2013, p. 7). Also, the\nuse of assistive or adaptive mobility devices to help them\nremain active may be an affront to their dignity and a cause\nfor embarrassment (Morgan, 2006). In fact, participants with\nchronic pain reported avoidance of meaningful activity once\nit became clear that they needed an adaptive device to con-\ntinue with the activity (Davis et al., 2002). The self-discrep-\nancies between ideal and actual abilities described by\nHuijnen et al. (2011) fall in line with this notion. For exam-\nple, OA pain may have interfered with participants' deeply\nheld notions of their ideal selves, threatening to alter the\nidentities they would like to continue promoting or the face\nthey would like to continue presenting to the world (Fenwick\nThe pattern of avoiding pain and risking embarrassment\nwas exemplified by our two hiking enthusiasts, who each\nreported feeling socially uncomfortable because of the limit-\ning effects of OA knee pain and the compromises they had to\nmake in terms of activity level. One of them discovered too\nlate that her knee was not up to hiking and chose to risk\nembarrassment or disapproval from their peers by limiting\nactivity. The second participant avoided pain by slowing\ndown, and as a result, could not keep up with companion hik-\ners. She continued on with the hike but did not feel comfort-\nable pushing herself to keep pace with her family. Both\nhikers in these examples appeared to be in the process of\nreadjusting life course expectations but experienced frustra-\ntion over the need to do so, in contrast to a study by Davis et\nal. (2002) who reported older adults expected pain and\nincreased mobility challenges as a normal part of aging.\nThese examples also illustrated the value of activities, such\nas hiking, that transcended the physical health-related advan-\ntages associated with them. In addition, they demonstrate the\ndistress caused by the threat of losing these abilities (Keysor\net al., 1998). Hiking was meaningful and beneficial for these\nparticipants and echoed other studies where restrictions on\nfavored physical activities \" . . . were a source of distress and\nsignaled a loss to their identity\" (Kaptein et al., 2013, p.\n1074). The woman who had to cut back on holding grand-\nchildren for fear her knees would give out expressed a sense\nof dissatisfaction in the lifestyle compromises OA pain\nrequired her to make. It is possible that her compromises\nregarding meaningful activities, such as holding grandchil-\ndren, indicate discrepancies between the culturally and gen-\nerationally engrained life course expectations and the current\nreality regarding her abilities (Becker, 1994). Her decisions\non how to manage these compromises and uncertainties\nreflect the notion of \"biographical embeddedness of health\nThe man who had to modify his sport-related activity, par-\nticularly basketball, indicated that making these adjustments\nto his game was about more than just avoiding getting injured\nor \"overdoing it\" on the basketball court. He was frustrated\nby the things he could once do so easily, much like the par-\nticipants in existing studies on physical activity, identity, and\narthritis (Kaptein et al., 2013). His modified persistence may\nhave been an attempt to minimize the discrepancy between\nKabel et al. 5\nhis actual and ideal abilities, as well as maintain engagement\nwithin his social group, allowing him to feel more connected\nto the \"ideal\" version of himself. These results resembled\nHuijnen and colleagues' (2011) work on self-discrepancy\nand activity-related behavior. The authors reported that peo-\nple with chronic pain who feel closer to the \"ideal\" versions\nof themselves are more likely to exhibit an activity pattern of\npersistence.\nIt is noteworthy that we found no example of a participant\ndiscussing risking pain and avoiding embarrassment by\navoiding activity. On the surface, it would seem reasonable\nthat one could not risk pain by avoiding physical activity.\nHowever, a paradox of inactivity exists (Mackichan et al.,\n2013) in that some people with knee OA report knowing that\nremaining active is important for pain control. Therefore,\nsome people with OA are knowingly risking pain by avoid-\ning physical activity. These examples shed light on need for\na holistic approach to the context and complexity required\nwhen managing chronic conditions (Morden, Jinks, & Ong,\n2012). This is especially relevant when considering pain-\nrelated avoidance and persistence behavior to expand our\ncurrent understanding of how embarrassment can influence\nphysical activity in people living with OA.\nThe small sample size and the fact that participant narra-\ntives were not accompanied by observations of physical\nactivity outside of the research setting are limitations to these\nfindings. Further research is required to determine whether\nor not multiple patterns of activity engagement and avoid-\nance co-exist within one individual, as has been indicated in\nother studies (Kindermans et al., 2011; Mackichan et al.,\nedge of these patterns of activity engagement, avoidance,\nand self-management are necessary for more effective indi-\nvidualized recommendations and clinical advice (Grime et\nal., 2010). Knowledge of patient expectations for activity\nthroughout the life course (Moore et al., 2014) is necessary\nto help patients identify when OA pain prevents them from\nbeing the person they want to be.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nArmstrong, M.
