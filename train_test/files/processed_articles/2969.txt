In light of the increasing prevalence of incur\u00ad able viral diseases, especially human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, modification of sexual behavior\nalso is emerging as a key intervention for STD preven\u00ad tion and contro l.1\u00b7 2 Knowledge of sexual behaviors\nwithin population subgroups is critical both for moni\u00ad toring disease transmission and targeting specific health education and risk reduction messages. The term \"sex\u00ad ual behavior\" involves many variables: current and life\u00ad time number of sex partners, age at first intercourse, frequency of intercourse, consistency of sexual activity, mode ofrecruitment of sexual partners, and duration of sexual unions. The distribution of these variables in the\n\n  The 1982 National Survey of Family Growth was designed and funded jointly by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), The National Institute for Child Health  and  Human  Development, and the Office of Population Affairs, all of which are U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nReprint requests: Sevgi 0.

Existing\nknowledge is based mostly on studies of college popula\u00ad tions3-5 or convenience sam ples.- 6 8 Two studies that\ncollected sexual behavior data from nationally represen\u00ad tative samples have focused on adolescent 9 10 and un\u00ad married females aged 20-29.11 As yet, no well estab\u00ad lished, empirically validated measures of sexual behav\u00ad ior are available to serve as indicators of STD risk, especially in aggregated analyses. Previous investiga\u00ad tions have used the crude index of sexual experience, defined as a person's ever having had sexual intercourse,\nas the best measure of sexual behavior.12\u00b713\n  The lack both of detailed, population-based data and validated behavioral measures has led to several as\u00ad sumptions about the impact of sexual behavior on STD which are only partially supported by empirical evi\u00ad dence. First, because of the inadequate conceptualiza\u00ad tion of the multiple sexual behavior variables, single\nmeasures have been implicitly accepted as an accurate indicator of other behavioral variables. 14\u00b715 This simplis\u00ad\ntic approach obscures the complexity of sexual choices that put individuals at risk of STD. Second, rates of STD and unwanted pregnancy have been used as general in\u00ad dicators of sexual behavior. These conditions are likely to be poor indicators of sexual behavior to the extent that they are affected either by preventive behaviors, as with unwanted pregnancy and incurable viral STD, or\nby health care seeking behaviors, as with curable bacte\u00ad rial STD.16 Third, findings from data based on either clinic populations 17 or on specific age groups, such as teenagers,9\u00b710 have been  generalized  to the entire sex\u00ad\nually  active  population,  in  spite  of  both the selective\nnature of clinic populations and the age-dependent na\u00ad ture of sexual behavior.18 Finally, the focus on statistical\n\n\n\n\n\nmeasures of central tendency, such as average age at first intercourse or mean number of sexual partners, has ig\u00ad nored the heterogeneity of sexual behavior across and within population subgroups. 19 Because of the existence of identifiable STD core populat ions,20 21 the more vari\u00ad able statistical measures of modality and skewness are probably critical to understanding the role of sexual be\u00ad havior as an STD risk factor.\n  In this article, we present estimates of sexual experi\u00ad ence, juxtaposed with measures of sexual activity from a large, population-based nationally representative sam\u00ad ple of women. We also analyze the consistency and fre\u00ad quency of sexual activity by age and race. We found that the usual index of sexual behavior-sexual experience\n-can be further refined to more specifically indicate STD risk, especially in women.\n\nMethods\n  We obtained data for this analysis from both a recent report22 and unpublished information from the  Na\u00ad tional Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), Cycle III, con\u00ad ducted in 1982 by the National Center for Health Sta\u00ad tistics (NCHS). The NSFG is a periodic survey of repro\u00ad ductive age women designed to provide information on factors affecting childbearing and maternal and child health.23 The Cycle III survey was carried out with a multistage area probability sample of7,969 women aged 15-44 in the United States.\n  The primary purpose of the NSFG is to measure de\u00ad terminants of birth and pregnancy rates. The data on exposure to intercourse were collected to measure the risks of contraceptive failure, unintended  pregnancy, and infertility. The data were based on responses  to three questions: first, women who had never been preg\u00ad nant and never been married were asked whether they had ever had intercourse; second, women who had ever had intercourse were asked which months during the 3\u00bd years before the interview they had not had intercourse during a period of one month or more; third, data on frequency of intercourse in the 3 months before the in\u00ad terview were collected to adjust contraceptive failure rates for differences in frequency and to permit analyses of data on women who are infertile or trying to become pregnant. To facilitate recall, these questions were em\u00ad bedded in a series of items on pregnancy history and contraceptive use history; moreover, they anchored key dates by relating them to the timing of significant repro\u00ad ductive events in the respondent's life.\n  From these data, we derived four measures of expo\u00ad sure to STD risk: the proportions of women who(]) ever had intercourse, (2) had intercourse in the past  3 months, (3) had intercourse in the past month, and (4) had intercourse at least once every month during the\n\npast 12 months. Our definitions of sexual  experience and frequency of intercourse are direct measures; the questions in the survey dealt specifically with this infor\u00ad mation. We used derived measures to determine levels of sexual activity, including sexually experienced inac\u00ad tivity and consistency of sexual activity. We constructed these measures based on the detailed data collected on periods of ;;;,a I month without sexual intercourse.\n  We defined sexual experience as a person's having had sexual \u00b7intercourse at least once in his or her lifetime. Women who had sexual intercourse at least once during the three months prior to the interview were defined as sexually active over a three-month period. Similarly, women who had sexual intercourse at least once during the one month prior to the interview were defined as sexually active over a one-month period. We defined those women who reported having sexual intercourse at least once every month during the 12 months prior to  the interview as being consistently sexually active over the 12-month period. Women who had sexual inter\u00ad course at least once in their lifetime but not over the I month prior to the interview were defined as sexually experienced but inactive (or as experienced abstainers).\n\nResults\nSexual Experience\n  Overall, 86% of women aged 15-44 were sexually ex\u00ad perienced. This proportion increased with  increasing age (table I). Teenagers were the least experienced. Among those aged 15-19, only 45% of the white women and 56% of women of other races had ever had sexual intercourse. Among women aged 20-24, 85% of whites and 90% of others were sexually experienced. For all other ages > 24, over 95% of women, white or other, were experienced. While younger white women were less experienced than younger women of other races, between ages 25 and 34 they had more experience.\n\nSexual Activity\n  Using three measures of sexual activity, teenagers again were the least active regardless of the specific ques\u00ad tions asked (table I). Sexual activity among teens ranged from 40% reporting sexual intercourse in the three months prior to interview to just one in seven having regular intercourse every month in the preceding year. The percentage of women who were sexually active in\u00ad creased with increasing age, until age 35. A slight de\u00ad crease in the percentage of sexually active women oc\u00ad curred among women aged 35-44 for whites and among women aged 40-44 for others.\n  For all age and race groups, a cascading decrease in sexual activity occurred as definitions became more\n\nTABLE 1.

More women were sexually experienced than reported sexual activity during the previous three months, 86% vs. 77% among whites and 88% vs. 78% among all other races, respectively. Sexual activity dur\u00ad ing the previous one month (71%) was less than that during the previous three months (77%), and consistent sexual activity every month over the previous year was the least frequently reported (57%). Among women aged 15-24, those of other races were more likely to be sex\u00ad ually active than white women, but among those aged 25-34 white women were more sexually active by all three definitions of sexual activity. When not stratified by age, the differences by race were small and generally not statistically significant.\n\nExperienced Abstainers\n  Conversely, regardless of measure used, teenagers were the most sexually inactive (table 2). Not only were they the least experienced, but teenagers also had a large percentage of experienced abstainers, as did those in the 20-24 age group. By any definition of experienced ab\u00ad stainer, during the teenage years, a larger percentage of white experienced women were abstainers than women of other races. For women aged 20-39 this pattern was reversed: white women were less likely than those of other races to be experienced abstainers.\n  The largest change in sexual activity among American women occurs between the teenage years and the late twenties. Both the accumulation of sexual experience and the increase in sexual activity rise markedly from ages 15- l 9 to ages 25-29. Among both whites and others, as age increases, the proportion of those who were both sexually experienced and active increased: the proportion of experienced abstainers declined from 38%\n\nto 12% for whites and from 31% to 17% for all other races between the teenage years and the late twenties.\nFrequency of Sexual Intercourse\n  Over half of sexually active reproductive women were having sexual intercourse once a week or more (table 3). Among whites the proportion who had intercourse this frequently was lowest (17%) among teenagers and high\u00ad est among those aged 25-29 (69%); it declined during later years to 59% by age 40-44. A larger proportion of whites (53%) compared to women of other races (44%) reported having sexual intercourse this frequently. The race differential occurred consistently at all ages.\nDiscussion\n  Our findings emphasize the vicissitudes of sexual be\u00ad havior. Both as a behavioral characteristic of a popula-\n\nTABLE 2.

Thus, the use of sexual experience alone in defin\u00ad ing the population at risk for STD is misleading.\n  These dimensions may also be affected by marital status. A recent publication from the NCHS22 presents a\ndetailed discussion of the effects of marital status on sexual activity in our data set. We have not considered marital status in our analysis for three reasons. First, a large proportion of unmarried women have had recent sexual activity; in 1982, 72% of white and 84% of black women who were not currently married had had sexual intercourse within the 3 months preceding the inter\u00ad view. Second, the cultural meaning of marriage differs drastically across subgroups of the population, and these differences are not sufficiently understood to allow accu\u00ad rate interpretations of subgroup differences in the data. Third, marital status is a poor indicator of the nature of sexual activity; for example, among unmarried women, black women were more likely than white women to have had intercourse during the 3 months preceding the interview; however, if they had had intercourse recently, they were less likely to have had intercourse fre\u00ad quently.22\n  Certain limitations of our data restrict our efforts to better define the population at risk for STD. First, our analysis represents a secondary use of existing data: the NSFG is designed to measure pregnancy and birth rates, not STD risk. Second, our data come from a cross-sec\u00ad tional survey. As such, we cannot differentiate between age and cohort effects. Thus, the age differences pre\u00ad sented here may reflect either age effects, cohort effects, or interactions between the two. Third, the data items included in the NSFG are limited in sexual behavior\n\ncontent. Information on numbers of sexual partners and types of sexual practices is important especially in rela\u00ad tion to STD risk. Unlike unplanned pregnancy, which depends on frequency of unprotected intercourse, STDs\nare only transmitted by an infected partner.24\n  The likelihood of contact with an infected partner is highly determined by the number of partners and who\nthe partners are.25\u00b726 Previous research  has contributed\nonly tangential findings in this area. The number of sexual partners within a specific time period, often one or three  months,  has been shown to be a risk factor  for\nherpes in fections, 30 hepatitis B virus,25 human papil\u00ad loma virus,31 and human immunodeficiency virus.32- 34\nLifetime number of sex partners is associated with the risk of cervical and other genital cancers.35 More re\u00ad\ncently, having a new sex partner within the past month was identified as a risk factor for chlamydial infection.28\nFinally, age at first sexual intercourse is negatively cor\u00ad related with STD risk. 36\n  Recent findings from population-based samples un\u00ad derscore two patterns about the important variable, number of sex partners: (J) it is differentially distributed across race and age groups; and (2) race differences in number of sexual partners do not parallel those in some other dimensions of sexual behavior. For example, compared with black women, white women have greater\nnumbers of sexual partners even though they initiate sexual activity later in life.11 Combined with findings\nthat white women also have greater numbers of casual and short duration sexual partnerships,11 the race differ\u00ad\nentials in number of partners challenge some of the sex\u00ad ual behavior explanations of race differences in STD rates. While of great importance, the number of partners is not the only determinant of likelihood of contact with an infected partner; the sexual behavior of partner(s) is increasingly recognized as an important sexual behavior variable in relation to STD. Infections in monogamous women  point  to the  choice  of sexual  partners as a risk\nfactor  for STD.16 This variable  is especially important\neither when bacterial infections are not cured quickly (due to inadequate utilization of health care or asymp\u00ad tomatic nature of infection) or when lack of cure leads to persistent viral infections.\n  Our data indicates that teenagers are generally less sexually active and less consistently so than older women. Similarly, except during the teen years, women of other races are less sexually active and less consis\u00ad tently sexually active than white women. Two possible explanations underlie these patterns: First, general sex\u00ad ual activity among teenagers and older women of other races is marked by sporadicity; second, relatively high levels of sexual activity occur in a relatively small subset of teenagers and women of other races over age 19.\n\n\n  What factors, then, explain the higher STD morbidity among teenagers and nonwhites? Based on our data, relatively higher levels of sexual activity of all members of these groups is not the explanation. Rather, subsets of these groups appear to account for a large proportion of the morbidity, a finding consistent with the \"core group hypothesis\" of STD transmission.20 The answer has to be either the existing high STD prevalence in these groups, which makes each unit of sexual activity carry higher risk, or the nature of sexual activity, e.g., number of partners or choice of partners, or both. In fact, the behavioral variables (1) number of partners, (2) indis\u00ad criminant choice of partners, (3) formation of core groups, and (4) high STD prevalence are probably highly and positively correlated.26\n  In conclusion, while our data provide refined infor\u00ad mation on the multiple dimensions of sexual behavior, they are still inadequate for accurately portraying the population at risk for STD. Further data on two aspects of sexual behavior-the distribution of number of sex\u00ad ual partners and factors influencing partner choice-are crucial to a better understanding of its effects on STD risk.\n\nReferences\n3.
