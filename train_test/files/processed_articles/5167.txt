However, published results on\nthe genetic association for the ACE I/D polymorphism are\ncontroversial and inconclusive.9\u00ad22 This may be due to\nsmall sample sizes, low statistical power, and/or clinical\nheterogeneity. In order to overcome the limitations of indi-\nvidual studies, resolve inconsistencies and reduce the like-\nlihood that random errors are responsible for false-positive\nor false-negative associations, we employed meta-analysis\nto further characterize the association. In the present\nstudy,23\u00ad25 we used meta-analysis to investigate whether the\nACE I/D polymorphism contributes to susceptibility to pso-\nriasis, vitiligo and RA.\nMaterials and methods\nIdentification of eligible studies and data\nextraction\nA literature search was conducted for studies that examined\nthe association between the ACE I/D polymorphism and\npsoriasis, vitiligo and RA. We utilized the MEDLINE and\nEMBASE citation indices to identify articles in which the\nACE I/D polymorphism was determined in patients and\ncontrols (up to October 2012). In addition, all references\nmentioned in the identified articles were reviewed to iden-\ntify studies not indexed by MEDLINE and EMBASE. The\nfollowing keywords and subject terms were searched:\n`angiotensin-converting enzyme', `ACE', `psoriasis', `viti-\nligo', `rheumatoid arthritis', and `RA'. Studies were\nincluded in the analysis if they: (1) were case control stud-\nies; (2) contained original data; and (3) contained sufficient\ndata to calculate odds ratios (ORs). No language restriction\nwas applied. We excluded the following: (1) studies con-\ntaining overlapping data; (2) studies in which the number\nof null and wild genotypes or alleles could not be ascer-\ntained; and (3) studies in which family members had been\nstudied because their analysis was based on linkage consid-\nerations. The following information was extracted from\neach identified study: author, year of publication, ethnicity\nof the study population, demographics, numbers of cases\nand controls and the frequencies of the genotypes and\nalleles of the ACE I/D polymorphism.\nEvaluation of publication bias and study\nquality\nFunnel plots are used to detect publication bias, but they\nrequire a range of studies of varying sizes and subjective\njudgments, and thus, we evaluated publication bias using\nEgger's linear regression test.26 The Egger's linear regres-\nsion test measures funnel plot asymmetry on a natural loga-\nrithmic scale of ORs. The chi-square test was used to\ndetermine whether observed genotype frequencies in con-\ntrols conformed to Hardy\u00adWeinberg (H-W) expectations.\nEvaluation of statistical associations\nWe performed meta-analyses using: (1) the allelic contrast\n(D vs. I); (2) the recessive (DD vs. ID + II); (3) the domi-\nnant (DD + ID vs. II); and (4) the homozygote contrast (DD\nvs. II) models. Point estimates of risks, ORs and 95% con-\nfidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for each study. In\naddition, within- and between-study variations and hetero-\ngeneities were assessed using Cochran's Q-statistic.\nCochran's Q-statistic test assesses the null hypothesis that\nall studies evaluated the same effect. The effect of hetero-\ngeneity was quantified using I2, with a range between 0 and\n100%, and represents the proportion of between-study vari-\nability attributable to heterogeneity rather than chance.27 I2\nlow, moderate and high estimates. The fixed effects model\nassumes that a genetic factor has a similar effect on disease\nsusceptibility across all studies investigated and that\nobserved variations among studies are caused by chance\nalone.28 The random effects model assumes that different\nstudies show substantial diversity and assesses both within-\nstudy sampling error and between-study variance.29 When\nstudy groups are homogeneous, the two models are similar.\nIf the study groups lack homogeneity, the random effects\nmodel usually provides wider CIs than the fixed effects model.\nThe random effects model is most appropriate in the pres-\nence of significant between-study heterogeneity.29 Statistical\nmanipulations were undertaken using a Comprehensive\nMeta-Analysis computer program (Biosta, Englewood, NJ,\nUSA). The power of each study was computed as the prob-\nability of detecting an association between the ACE polymor-\nphism and vasculitis using a significance level of 0.05 and\nassuming an OR of 1.5 (small effect size). Power analysis\nwas performed using the statistical program G*Power\n(http://www.psycho.uni-duesseldorf.de/aap/projects/gpower).\nResults\nStudies included in the meta-analysis\nTwenty studies were identified by electronic and manual\nsearches and 15 were selected for a full-text review based on\ntitle and abstract details.9\u00ad22,30 One study was excluded\nbecause it contained duplicate data.30 One eligible study\ncontained data on two different RA groups, and these were\ntreated independently.21 Thus, a total of 15 separate com-\nparisons met our inclusion criteria.9\u00ad22 These studies com-\nprised five each on psoriasis, vitiligo and RA. They\nconsisted of four European, three East Asian, three Arab,\nthree Turkish and two South Asian studies. In total the stud-\nof the individual studies are summarized in Table 1. The\nstatistical power of these 15 studies ranged from 16.4% to\n86.1%. One of the studies had a statistical power exceeding\nTable 1.

Publication bias causes a disproportionate\nnumber of positive studies, and poses a problem for meta-\nanalyses.

ACE plays an important role in RAS, and\nangiotensin II conversion, directly increases vascular\nsmooth muscle cell contraction and affects smooth muscle\nproliferation, monocyte adhesion, platelet adhesion, and\naggregation. Angiotensin II also acts as a potent pro-\ninflammatory modulator.7,31 The ACE I/D polymorphism is\nlocated on an intron of the ACE gene, and is in strong link-\nage disequilibrium with genetic factors that influence\nserum ACE levels.8 In fact, the ACE I/D polymorphism\naccounts for approximately one-half of the variance inACE\nplasma levels in humans. Furthermore, the polymorphism\nhas been studied in several diseases, including Alzheimer's\nFigure 1.

These studies also\nreported associations between susceptibilities to these dis-\neases and the DD genotype and D allele.9\u00ad22\nIn this meta-analysis, we combined evidence on the\nassociations between the ACE I/D polymorphism and sus-\nceptibility to psoriasis, vitiligo and RA.

Genetic studies have established that vitiligo\nsusceptibility has a genetic component.37,38 In the present\nstudy, we found no association between vitiligo and the\nACE I/D polymorphism. The lack of association between\nvitiligo and psoriasis is unclear. The difference may be due\nto small sample sizes or differences in the type of skin dis-\nease. These two disorders may follow different pathways at\nthe cellular and molecular levels. Relatively few studies\nreported the association between vitiligo and the ACE\nI/D polymorphism and their results were heterogeneous.\nFurther studies are required on this topic.\nACE, as a key regulator in inflammatory signal trans-\nduction pathway, has been considered to be involved in the\npathogenesis of RA.39 ACE levels are increased in RA syn-\novial fluid suggesting that locally produced ACE may con-\ntribute to the joint destruction of RA.40 ACE converts\nangiotensin I to angiotensin II, which has a role as a growth\nfactor and as a proinflammatory modulator. Angiotensin II\nmodulates the expression of many cytokines, chemokines,\nadhesion molecules, endothelin-1, prostaglandins, platelet-\nactivating factor, nitric oxide and cyclooxygenase-2.39\nOur results should be interpreted with caution due to the\nlimited number of studies included in this meta-analysis,\nwhich restricted further sub-group analyses. The relative\nimportance of the ACE I/D polymorphism during the\ndevelopment of autoimmune diseases may be dependent on\nethnicity. However, we were unable to perform ethnicity-\nspecific meta-analysis due to limited data. Thus, further\nstudies are required to allow meta-analysis by ethnic group\nto clarify the role of the ACE I/D polymorphism in various\nethnic populations.\nOur study has several limitations including potential\npublication bias, heterogeneity and confounding factors\nthat may have distorted the meta-analysis. Secondly, there\nare varying levels of severity for each disease and the activ-\nity level in each disease was unclear. Further research is\nTable 3.

Accordingly, our findings support the\nnotion that the ACE I/D polymorphism plays a role in the\npathogenesis of RA. Larger scale studies in populations\nwith different ethnicities are required to explore relation-\nships between polymorphisms of the ACE gene and the\npathogenesis of psoriasis and RA.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the Korean Healthcare\nTechnology R&D Project, Ministry for Health, Welfare and\nReferences\n1.
