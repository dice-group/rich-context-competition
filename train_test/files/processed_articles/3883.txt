Neither the precise temporal profile of\nthe cellular dynamics of spinal microvasculature nor the\npotential molecular effectors regulating this plasticity are\nwell understood. TGFb (transforming growth factor b)\nisoforms have been shown to be rapidly increased in\nresponse to SCI and CNS (central nervous system)\nischaemia, but no data exist regarding their contribution\nto microvascular dysfunction following SCI. To examine\nthese issues, in the present study we used a model of focal\nspinal cord ischaemia/reperfusion SCI to examine the\ncellular response(s) of affected microvessels from 30 min to\n14 days post-ischaemia. Spinal endothelial cells were\nisolated from affected tissue and subjected to focused\nmicroarray analysis of TGFb-responsive/related mRNAs 6\nand 24 h post-SCI. Immunohistochemical analyses of\nhistopathology show neuronal disruption/loss and astro-\nglial regression from spinal microvessels by 3 h post-\nischaemia, with complete dissolution of functional endfeet\n(loss of aquaporin-4) by 12 h post-ischaemia. Coincident\nwith this microvascular plasticity, results from microarray\nanalyses show 9 out of 22 TGFb-responsive mRNAs\nsignificantly up-regulated by 6 h post-ischaemia. Of these,\nserpine 1/PAI-1 (plasminogen-activator inhibitor 1) demon-\nstrated the greatest increase (.40-fold). Furthermore, uPA\n(urokinase-type plasminogen activator), another member\nof the PAS (plasminogen activator system), was also\nsignificantly increased (.7.5-fold). These results, along\nwith other select up-regulated mRNAs, were confirmed\nbiochemically or immunohistochemically. Taken together,\nthese results implicate TGFb as a potential molecular\neffector of the anatomical and functional plasticity of\nmicrovessels following SCI.\n",

Any\nperturbation of the normal functional and/or anatomical\nintegration of the microvasculature results in neural\npathology (Hawkins and Davis, 2005). Ultrastructural studies\nhave documented vascular pathology minutes after SCI\npersists throughout the acute injury phase (Whetstone et al.,\ncells to die following contusive SCI (Griffiths et al., 1978;\nCasella et al., 2006). These immediate vascular events,\nincluding increased permeability of the BSCB (blood-spinal\ncord-barrier), induce oedema and contribute to detrimental\nthe subacute phase of injury, the penumbral microvascula-\nture is also pathologically transformed by loss of astrocytic\ninvestment (Whetstone et al., 2003), regression of pericytes\n(Benton et al., 2008a) and the perivascular localization of\ninfiltrating inflammatory cells (Popovich and Jones, 2003).\nThis second and more prolonged phase of microvascular\ninstability has been hypothesized to be a primary event\nleading to chronic histopathology after SCI (Casella et al.,\nmicrovascular elements within penumbral microvasculature\nremains a largely unexplored therapeutic avenue due to a\nrelative lack of understanding of key molecular pathways\npathologically induced in smvECs (spinal microvascular ECs).\nThis is a critical issue as preservation of metabolic support of\nspinal tissue spared by the primary injury event should result\nin enhanced substrate for chronic recovery.\nA number of effectors influence BSCB function following\ntraumatic SCI, including the critical vasoactive molecules\nephs/ephrins, VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), and\nfunctionally related co-factor(s), the angiopoeitins (Sharma,\n2005). The neurotrophins BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic\nfactor), NGF (nerve growth factor) and NT3 (neurotrophin 3)\nalso modulate EC survival and proliferation in vivo (Ward and\nLaManna, 2004), but their role in SCI-induced microvascular\nplasticity is unknown. Several secreted cytokines, including\nTNFa (tumour necrosis factor a) and TGFb (transforming\ngrowth factor b) isoforms are increased following SCI and are\nthought to be potent regulators of EC survival, proliferation\nand function, as well as BSCB integrity (O'Brien et al., 1994;\nthe induction of VEGF expression (ten Dijke and Arthur,\n2007). Previous in vitro evidence suggests that TGFb1 can act\nin concert with VEGF to induce EC apoptosis (Ferrari et al.,\n2006), a surprising finding with potentially important\nimplications for microvascular stability in the injured spinal\ncord. Furthermore, MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases) are\nestablished regulators of vascular destabilization and EC\ndysfunction following SCI (Noble et al., 2002) and cortical\nischaemia (Cunningham et al., 2005). A pathological connec-\ntion may exist between TGFb1 and MMPs, as TGFb1 signalling\nincreases MMP expression (ten Dijke and Arthur, 2007).\nFurthermore, MMPs are activators of latent TGFb1 in various\nin vivo contexts (ten Dijke and Arthur, 2007), suggesting the\npotential for a potent, reciprocal, feed-forward pathological\nloop in the microvasculature following SCI.\nThus the principal goal of the present study was to\ndetermine whether ECs are induced by TGFb in the early\nphases of SCI utilizing multiple novel approaches. Using a\npreviously described model of focal spinal ischaemia (Benton\net al., 2005), we sought to replicate the non-traumatic stress/\nischaemia present in penumbral spinal tissue (i.e. immediately\nsurrounding the traumatic injury site). Furthermore, we\nutilized new methodology to isolate spinal cord microvascular\nECs (Benton et al., 2008b) from this ischaemic spinal cord.\nThese approaches lead to the identification of multiple TGFb/\nBMP (bone morphogenetic protein)-responsive/related\nmRNAs expressed in the EC compartment concomitant to\nthe onset of significant histopathology following spinal\nischaemia. Taken together, the present results indeed\nimplicate TGFb, known to be pathologically altered after\nSCI, in the acute pathological transformation of the spinal\nmicrovasculature.\nFocal ischaemic SCIs\nAll surgical intervention and subsequent care and treatment\nof all animals used in the present study were in strict\naccordance with the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of\nLaboratory Animals (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources,\nNational Research Council, 1996) and approved by the\nUniversity of Louisville IACUC guidelines.

Animals were randomized into groups\nreceiving a 0.75 ml microinjection of vehicle (saline+1 mg/\nml rat serum albumin) or rET-1 (rat endothelin-1; 15 pmol;\nSigma, E7764). A single midline incision was made in the\nexposed dura and rET-1 was delivered in one microinjection\ninto the anterior sulcus using bevelled glass micropipettes\ncustom-pulled to an external diameter of 50\u00ad60 mm. The\nincision sites were then sutured in layers and the topical\nantibiotic Bacitracin was applied to the incision site. Animals\nreceived prophylactic injections of gentamycin to prevent\ninfection [1 mg/kg, i.m.

Immediately following surgery and for\n48 h post-operatively, animals also received twice-daily\ninjections of buprenorphine [Bupronex; 0.075 mg/kg, s.c.\n(subcutaneously), b.i.d. (twice daily)] and their bladders were\nmanually expressed twice daily.\nIsolation of smvECs\nSpinal microvessels in control and injured rat spinal cords\nwere intravascularly labelled using 200 mg of FITC-conjugated\nLEA (Lycopersicon esculentum agglutinin) lectin (FL-1171, 2\nmg/ml; Vector Laboratories) as described previously (Benton\ndelivered systemically by intravenous injection into the\nsurgically exposed right external jugular vein at a rate of\nScientific). FITC\u00adLEA was allowed to circulate for 15 min prior\nto perfusion with saline. Spinal cord tissue containing\nintravascularly labelled microvessels was then processed for\nmicrovascular EC isolation. Briefly, 6 and 24 h post-SCI,\napprox. 1 cm of spinal cord tissue spanning the injection site\nwas isolated, and the ventral intact/lesioned grey matter was\ndissected and homogenized in ice-cold HBSS (Hanks balanced\nsalt solution). The crude homogenate was triturated using\nmultiple passes through 26 and 30 gauge needles and filtered\nthrough a 70 mm mesh. smvECs were purified by FACS using a\nMoFlo system (DAKO) using identical parameters with those\nenrichment of microvascular fragments is achieved using this\ntechnique.

For each\ngene, the fold-changes were calculated as the difference in\ngene expression between smvECs from control spinal tissue\nand that in smvECs from ischaemic spinal tissue.\nTissue processing and immunohistochemical\nanalysis\nAt multiple experimental timepoints post-ischaemia, animals\nwere perfused using 200 ml of 4% (w/v) PFA (paraformalde-\nhyde). Spinal cords were dissected and transversely sectioned\nat 20 mm on a cryostat. Sections were thaw-mounted on\nmicroscope slides and stored at 280\u00b0C. On the day of staining,\nslides were warmed at 37\u00b0C for 20 min and the mounting\nmatrix was removed with forceps. Tissue was blocked in 0.1 M\nserum for 1 h at room temperature (22\u00b0C).

Negative controls for each epitope consisted of\nexperimental tissue exposed to species-specific pre-immune\nIgG and did not result in significant staining. All photomicro-\ngraphs were captured using a Nikon Ti-E automated inverted\nmicroscope equipped with a DS-Ri1 digital camera or an LS-\n500 laser confocal microscope (Olympus) and Nikon Elements\nBR analysis software or an Eclipse C1 laser confocal microscope\n(Nikon Instruments). To eliminate the possibility of `cross-over'\nsignal, sequential excitation and capture was performed with\ntissue containing multiple fluorophores analysed by laser\nconfocal microscopy.\nuPA [urokinase-type PA (plasminogen activator)]\nzymography\nuPA enzymatic activity was determined as described prev-\niously (Benton et al., 2008b), which has been adapted with\nslight modification of an established protocol (Heussen and\nDowdle, 1980). Briefly, 5 mm of spinal tissue, centered on the\nET-1 injection site, was rapidly removed from the spinal\ncolumn. Tissue was then bisected into ventral and dorsal\nportions. Protein was extracted from the ventral tissue\nsample containing ischaemic grey matter. Total protein (10\nmg) from spinal cord tissues was resolved under non-reducing\nconditions on SDS/PAGE (10% gels) containing 0.01 unit/ml\nplasminogen and 1.5 mg/ml gelatin (Sigma).

The results of the present study show that neuronal\npathology occurs very early following focal spinal grey matter\nischaemia. Significant grey matter pathology is observed by 3\nh post-ET-1 injection, as demonstrated by the overt loss of\nMap2 (microtubule-associated protein 2)- and NeuN-\nimmunoreactivity (Figures 1B, 1E and 1F). Large spinal motor\nneurons (Figure 1D; arrowheads) were notably absent in the\nacute phase of insult in affected grey matter by 3 h following\nonset of ET-1-mediated ischaemia (Figure 1F). At early\ntimepoints following focal ischaemia, only grey matter\nperfused by target vessels emanating from the anterior\nspinal artery demonstrate significant pathology (Figure 1B).\nThis decreased Map2- and NeuN-immunoreactivity in\naffected spinal grey matter is the result of neuronal death\nand not down-regulation of epitopes as evidenced by loss of\nNissl-stained neurons in adjacent sections (Figures 1G\u00ad1J).\nTemporal course of astrocyte loss from\nmicrovessels affected by ischaemic SCI\nFollowing experimental stroke, loss of perivascular astrocytic\nendfeet has been documented by 6 h post-ischaemia,\nresulting in substantial permeability and oedema in and\naround affected microvessels (Polavarapu et al., 2007). In the\npresent study, we examined the temporal loss of functional\nastrocytic contribution to microvessels following spinal cord\nischemia by Aqp-4 (aquaporin-4) immunostaining\n(Figures 2A\u00ad2D; arrowheads). Aqp-4 is a water channel\nassociated with perivascular astrocytic endfeet (Abbott et al.,\n2006) and is characteristic of an intact BSCB. At 3 h post-\nischaemia, when overt neuronal pathology is initially\nobserved, affected microvessels begin to exhibit partial loss\nof astroglial investment, with most microvessels devoid of\nAqp-4 immunoreactivity (Figures 2E\u00ad2H). By 6 h post-\nischaemia, no GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein)- or Aqp-\n4-immunoreactive elements are observed in affected grey\nmatter (Figures 2I\u00ad2L). This astroglial loss becomes more\npronounced by 3 days post-ischaemia, with astrocytes\nbecoming limited to the perimeter of spinal white matter\nand completely absent from the ischaemic core as determined\nby GFAP-immunoreactivity (results not shown). Importantly,\nthis temporal course of astrocyte and anatomical/functional\ndecoupling from the EC compartment correlates with the\nappearance of abnormal EC tight-junctional phenotypes\n(results not shown), consistent with what is observed after\ncontusive SCI in the adult mouse (Benton et al., 2008a).\nSpinal endothelial expression of TGFb-related/\nresponsive mRNAs is induced concomitant with\nmicrovascular plasticity\nTable 2 summarizes the greatest magnitude changes in TGFb/\nBMP signalling-related mRNA expression acutely after SCI (see\nSupplementary Figure S2 at http://www.asnneuro.org/an/001/\nh post-ischaemia. Of these, nearly all were transcripts known to\nbe TGFb1-responsive. More specifically, several within this class\nwere significantly up-regulated at both 6 and 24 h post-\nischaemia including serpine 1/PAI-1 (PA inhibitor-1) (41- and\nTgif (7- and 3-fold). A smaller subset of mRNAs, including IL\nand Jun (2-fold), had significantly higher expression at 6 h, but\nnot 24 h, post-ischaemia. Interestingly, a number of the genes\nregulating TGFb superfamily signalling in the EC compartment\nresponded to ET-1-induced focal ischaemia by significantly\ndown-regulating transcript levels. For example, cystatin C\nFigure 1 Temporal course of neuronal loss following focal ischaemic SCI\nIntact spinal grey matter staining in the rostral lumbar spinal cord of a sham-\ncontrol rat (A).

At higher magnification, a dense network\nof neuronal processes in ventral grey matter can be seen (C), a pattern that is\ndiminished by 3 h post-ischaemia (E). Furthermore, NeuN-immunoreactive\nmotor neurons are apparent in control tissue (D; arrowheads), but are lost by\n3 h following ET-1 microinjection (F).

As early as 3 h post-ET-1\nmicroinjection, uPA proteolytic activity was significantly\nincreased, with levels further increasing by 6 h post-\nischaemia (Figures 3A and 3B). The temporal course of this\nincreased enzymatic activity parallels both the loss of\nastrocytic endfeet in affected microvessels (Figure 2), as well\nthe induction of TGFb activation of smvECs as demonstrated\nby microarray results. This result is important in that it\nimplicates uPA in the activation of TGFb within the ischaemic\ngrey matter and in ECs within affected tissue soon after the\nonset of ischaemic/reperfusive insult.\nMMP-9, a potent modulator of TGFb bioactivity,\nis expressed in affected microvessels\nIn most tissues, including the CNS, pools of TGFb exist in\ninactive forms within the pericellular space and may be\nrendered bioactive by one or more activators, which include\nproteases, integrins and thrombospondins (ten Dijke and\nArthur, 2007). Of these potential activators, expression and/or\nactivity of MMP-9 is induced in traumatic SCI (Noble et al.,\n2002). In control ventral grey matter, no MMP-9 expression\nwas observed in smvECs (Figures 4A and 4B). The earliest\ntimepoint post-ischaemia where MMP-9 immunoreactivity\nwas observed was 12 h, where a marked increase was seen in\naffected microvessels (Figures 4C and 4D), although some\naffected microvascular elements did not exhibit detectable\nimmunoreactivity (Figure 4D; arrowheads). By 24 h post-\nischaemia, levels of MMP-9 expression remained elevated in\nall affected microvessels (Figures 4E and 4F). This result\nsuggests a role for MMP-9 in regulation of TGFb activity in/at\naffected microvessels in the subacute phases, but not in the\nimmediate phase, of smvECs activation following ischaemic\nDetection of multiple TGFb-responsive proteins\nin spinal microvessels in ischaemic SCI\nThe rationale for the selection of mRNAs to validate at the\nprotein level was based upon (i) the magnitude of the\ntranscriptional changes revealed by microarray analysis and\n(ii) the novelty of their role in acute microvascular\ndysfunction in the context of SCI. Based on these criteria,\nwe chose to define the temporal dynamic of protein\nexpression levels of PAI-1, IL-6 and IGFBP-3, which represent\nthe three most highly up-regulated mRNAs examined in\nsmvECs acutely following ischaemic SCI.

This\nphasic response is consistent with that quantitatively\ndetermined for mRNA levels (Table 2).

This result suggests a transient\nrole for IGFBP-3 in the activation of the smvECs following\nischaemic SCI.\nThe most highly up-regulated mRNA observed in the\nTable 1) was that encoding the endogenous uPA inhibitor\nPAI-1. In sham-control spinal grey matter, no detectable PAI-\n1 expression was observed in spinal microvessels (Figure 6B).\nAs early as 3 h post-ET-1 microinjection, PAI-1 immuno-\nreactivity was associated with perfused microvessels in\naffected tissue (Figures 6C and 6D; arrowheads). This increase\nin PAI-1 expression was maintained throughout the subacute\nperiod post-ischaemia, with detectable levels of PAI-1\nexpression associated with activated smvECs at 2 and 3 days\n(Figures 6E\u00ad6H; arrowheads). Interestingly, 5 days post-\nischaemia, little PAI-1 immunoreactivity was observed in\nperfused microvessels in affected ventral grey matter\n(Figures 6I and 6J). These results implicate PAI-1 in\ncontributing to the early pathological activation of the\nmicrovasculature following focal spinal ischaemia. Moreover,\nthese immunohistochemical data showing correlative protein\nexpression and mRNA levels in ECs support the conclusion\nthat results obtained from FACS-isolated ECs reflect their\nin situ transcriptional state. This is an important issue\nconsidering the stress induced by the isolation protocol.\nFigure 4 Microvascular MMP-9 expression is induced by ischaemic SCI\nIn control ventral grey matter, no detectable MMP-9 immunoreactivity is\npresent in smvECs (A and B).

The use of ET-1 to induce vasospastic\nspinal cord ischaemia is based upon previous experimental\nmodels of ET-1-mediated stoke (O'Neill and Clemens, 2001).\nIn mammals, ET exerts its bioactivity via three structurally\nrelated peptides (ET-1, ET-2 and ET-3), which bind two\nsubtypes of G-protein-coupled receptors (ETA\nand ETB\n), which\nare highly conserved across multiple species (Schinelli, 2006).\nFigure 5 smvEC expression of IL-6 and IGFBP-3 after SCI\nBasal levels of expression for both IL-6 (A and B; arrowheads) and IGFBP-3 (C and D; arrows) were detected in the vasculature in\ncontrol spinal grey matter. Increased IL-6 immunoreactivity was observed in smvECs at 6 h post-ischaemia (E and F; arrowheads).\nInterestingly, this expression appeared to exhibit a biphasic pattern, with qualitative levels diminished at 1 day (I and J), but\nreappearing in activated microvascular profiles by 3 days post-ischaemia (M and N; arrowheads). Similar to IL-6 staining, levels of\nIGFBP-3 immunoreactivity were intensified by 6 h post-ET-1 microinjection (G and H; arrows). However, levels were then found to\ndiminish progressively beginning at 2 days post-ischaemia (K and L; arrows), with little IGFBP-3 immunoreactivity associated with\nperfused microvessels 5 days post-ischaemia (O and P; arrow).

The ET system is up-regulated in response to brain\nischaemia (Edvinsson, 2009), suggesting that it may play a\nrole in the aetiology of clinical stroke. While less is known\nabout the precise role of ET-1 in CNS trauma, blockade of ET-1\nreceptors has been shown to ameliorate tissue loss and\nfacilitate functional sparing following experimental SCI in rats\nFurthermore, blood levels of ET-1 are elevated in patients\nsuffering from traumatic SCI (Wang et al., 2007). These data,\ncombined with the results of the present study, support the\nidea that ET-1 does play a role in secondary injury cascades\nfollowing SCI.\nAlthough the primary action in nervous tissue is in\nregulation of intrinsic vascular tone (Schinelli, 2006), it has\nmore recently been implicated in the modulation of\nnociception and sensory function (Khodorova et al., 2009).\nAlthough this implicates direct activation of neurons, little\ndata exist demonstrating receptor-mediated neurotoxic\nactions of ET-1. Indeed, previous results show that direct\napplication of 1 mM ET-1 to mixed cultures of neonatal\nneurons and astrocytes results in neither cell death nor\npotentiation of excitotoxicity, whereas as little as 50 nM is\nsufficient for cellular activation, primarily via ETB\n(Benton\net al., 2005). In the present study, acute grey matter\npathology following ET-1 microinjection is limited to areas\ncorresponding to patterns of intrinsic blood supply of\ntargeted penetrating microvasculature (Mautes et al., 2000).\nThis supports the idea that the mechanism(s) of insult\nobserved is likely to be due to interruption of blood flow to\naffected grey matter and not a direct cytotoxic action.\nResults from the present study demonstrate early and\nrobust transcriptional activation of TGFb-responsive genes in\nthe EC compartment in response to spinal ischaemia/\nreperfusion injury. Previous studies have determined that it\nis primarily the TGFb1 isoform that is acutely increased\nfollowing traumatic SCI (Semple-Rowland et al., 1995; Streit\nclinical cases of SCI, TGFb1 appears to be primarily associated\nwith acute injury responses, with other isoforms being\nexpressed at more chronic phases of injury (Buss et al.,\n2008). Among the postulated effects of this early TGFb1\nresponse in traumatic SCI are included altered microglial\nchemotaxis (Yao et al., 1990) and astrocyte proliferation\n(Lindholm et al., 1992). Present results suggest that TGFb1\nactivation of the EC compartment in the early phase of spinal\ninsult may play a role in acute microvascular dysfunction/\nplasticity following SCI. Also, these results suggest conser-\nvation in the TGFb1 response in traumatic and atraumatic\nFigure 6 smvEC expression of PAI-1 is rapidly induced by ischaemic SCI\nNo detectable PAI-1 immunoreactivity was observed in control spinal grey\nmatter (B). As early as 3 h post-ischaemia, robust PAI-1 immunoreactivity is\nobserved in affected smvECs (C and D; arrowheads). This expression level is\nmaintained in smvECs for up to 3 days post-ischaemia (E\u00adH; arrowheads). By 5\ndays post-ischaemia, PAI-1 immunoreactivity returned to basal levels in\nperfused spinal microvessels (I and J). Confocal imaging definitively co-\nlocalizes PAI-1 to FITC\u00adLEA activated/perfused spinal microvessels in the xz\nand yz planes (F and H; arrows).

These observations support the\nconclusion that EC stimulation by TGFb results from EC\nexposure to extracellular sources of bioactive cytokine.\ntimes as much as other cells (Assoian et al., 1983). Early\nstudies of traumatic SCI established platelet aggregation as a\nprecipitating event in secondary vascular responses to injury\nobservations of acute platelet aggregation in acute ET-1\nlesions using CD61 immunohistochemistry shows little/no\ndetectable staining (results not shown). Other potential\ncellular sources for TGFb isoform(s) in this context include\ninflammatory cells (McTigue et al., 2000) and astrocytes\n(O'Brien et al., 1994). Additional experiments will be\nnecessary to definitively identify stimulatory cellular sources\nof TGFb in the acute smvEC response to SCI.\nAnother possibility supported by the present results, is that\nlocal inactive pools of TGFb are rendered bioactive by one of\nseveral potential pathways induced by focal spinal ischaemia.\nTGFb1 exists in a biologically inactive form in complex with\nthe remaining portion of its precursor molecule, LAP (latency-\nassociated peptide), which is bound to a LTBP (latent TGFb1\nbinding protein) (LTBP-1, 3 or 4) forming the LLC (large latent\ncomplex). Virtually all of the TGFb1 released from platelets\nand other cells is in the LLC (Annes et al., 2003). In the CNS,\nTSP-1 (thrombospondin-1) is a very potent activator of\nTGFb1, as are the proteases plasmin, mast cell chymase,\nmetalloproteases [including MMP-9 and MT1-MMP (mem-\nbrane-type 1-MMP)] and thrombin (ten Dijke and Arthur,\n2007). Interestingly, 24 h after contusive SCI in the mouse,\nup-regulated expression of both TSP-1 (58-fold) and uPA (21-\nfold) was observed in purified microvascular ECs (Benton\net al., 2008b). uPA cleaves plasminogen to plasmin which\ndirectly activates TGFb (Tkachuk et al., 1996) as well as\nindirectly by cleaving pro-MMP-9 to active MMP-9 enhan-\ncing bioactivation of TGFb from extracellular stores (Zhang et\nal., 2005). Thus not only is TGFb activated acutely after SCI, it\nis also done so in a positive-feedback loop further enhancing\nits actions. The results of the present study support the local\nactivation of TGFb by uPA in the immediate phase of\nischaemia/reperfusion, with other possible effectors includ-\ning, but not limited to, MMP-9, resulting in TGFb bioactivity/\nbioavailability in the subacute phase of microvascular\nplasticity in response to ischaemic SCI. Furthermore, these\nresults suggest that the molecular mechanism of NVU\ndysfunction (i.e. increased expression of uPA, MMP-9 and\nTSP-1) may be similar in both traumatic and atraumatic (i.e.\nischaemic and excitotoxic) forms of SCI.\nOf the TGFb-responsive genes examined, the largest\nchange was the 11-fold increase in IGFBP-3 24 h post-\nischaemia, a result also demonstrated at the protein level by\nimmunohistochemistry. The role of IGFBP-3 on EC function in\nthe injured spinal cord is unknown, but its overexpression\nmay have implications for smvEC plasticity following SCI.\nIGFBP-3 is normally expressed at high levels by hepatic ECs\n(Zimmermann et al., 2000) and is the most abundant\ncirculating binding protein (Guler et al., 1989). The main\nfunction of IGFBP-3 is to bind IGF, which results in enhanced\nbioavailability and activity (Guler et al., 1989). In addition,\nthere are a number of critical IGF-independent actions of\nIGFBP-3, including wound healing, cell adhesion/migration,\ngene transcription, cytosolic trafficking and neuronal pro-\ntection (for a review see Yamada and Lee, 2009). Data on\nEC-specific responses suggest a controversial and context-\ndependent role in vascular plasticity. IGFBP-3 accelerates EC\nsenescence in vitro (Kim et al., 2007) and inhibits angiogen-\nesis in HUVECs (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) and\nchick chorioallantoic in vitro models (Oh et al., 2006). By\ncontrast, IGFBP-3 enhances differentiation of EC precursors\nin vitro and enhances angiogenesis in an oxygen-induced\nretinopathy mouse model (Chang et al., 2007). IGFBP-3\nremains a poorly understood biomarker of CNS pathology.\nIncreased IGFBP-3 expression is associated with amyloid-b\nplaque formation in affected microvasculature in brains of\nAlzheimer's disease patients (Rensink et al., 2002).\nFurthermore, the IGF system has been implicated in both\nexperimental stroke recovery/susceptibility in patients.\nSpecifically, IGFBP-3 mRNA is acutely up-regulated in the\nmouse brain in response to transient ischaemia (O'Donnell\net al., 2002), a response that was associated with the post-\nischaemic inflammatory response. Interestingly, plasma levels\nof IGFBP-3 are inversely correlated with both increased risk of\nclinical stroke. Taken together, the latter findings suggest a\nprotective role for IGFBP-3 in CNS pathology. To date, no\nresults exist regarding the putative role of the IGF/IGFBP-3\nsystem in microvascular function and/or neuroprotection\nfollowing SCI.\nAlso of note is the present result demonstrating mRNA\nlevels of IL-6 to be significantly up-regulated in activated ECs\nfollowing SCI, with protein levels increased acutely, but not\nsustained beyond, 24 h post-SCI. With respect to IL-6, in\naddition to its role as a multifunctional pro-inflammatory\ncytokine involved in the regulation of the acute inflammatory\nresponse (Papassotiropoulos et al., 2001; Rose-John et al.,\n-induced cell death\n(Waxman et al., 2003). On the other hand, IL-6 induces tight\njunction dysfunction and hyperpermeability in rat heart\nmicrovascular ECs in vitro (Tinsley et al., 2008). In the context\nof traumatic SCI, IL-6 mRNA levels are increased 3\u00ad24 h post-\ninjury in astrocytes, neurons and resident microglia (Pineau\nresponse to permanent MCAO (middle cerebral artery\nocclusion) in rats, with expression peaking at 12 h post-\nischaemia (Wang et al., 1995). More recently, serum levels of\nIL-6 were shown to significantly increase 24 h following\ntransient MCAO (Martinez-Revelles et al., 2008). Similar\nresults have been observed in patients within hours following\nstroke onset, with a positive correlation seen between plasma\nTGFb activation of ECs in ischaemic SCI\nE 2009 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commerical use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nlevels of IL-6 and both infarct size and clinical outcome\ncurrently exist regarding whether the action of IL-6 is\ndeleterious in SCI, recent findings have linked IL-6 signalling\nin the EC compartment with blood\u00adbrain barrier failure in\nEAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis) (Linker et\nal., 2008). Additional investigations will be needed to\ndetermine the contribution of increased EC expression of\nIL-6 on inflammation and/or angiogenesis following SCI.\nThe temporal response of uPA mRNA and activity observed\nin the present study is consistent with observations made in\nexperimental stroke (Hosomi et al., 2001). Specific inhibition\nof uPA in experimental stroke decreases infarct size by\nprotecting blood\u00adCNS barrier integrity (Hamann et al., 2004).\nThe acute increase in uPA mRNA in the EC compartment\nobserved in the present study is likely to be of functional\nconsequence as uPA activity is increased in smvECs isolated\n72 h post-ischaemia (R. L. Benton, unpublished data).\nFurthermore, significant inductions of PAI-1 (mRNA and\nprotein) and uPAR (uPA receptor) (R. L. Benton, unpublished\ndata) in ECs after ischaemic SCI suggest a role for the PAS\n(PA system) in vascular dysfunction and secondary injury\nprogression following SCI, as has been established in stroke.\nThe implications of the response observed here, as well as in\nother types of neuropathology, are likely to be a fundamental\nevent underlying secondary degeneration. The PAS is best\nknown for its function in thrombolysis, but it also plays\nsubstantial roles in many cellular processes outside of the\nbloodstream, especially in the CNS (Zhang et al., 2005). The\ncentral active protease of the PAS is plasmin, which is\ngenerated by cleavage of plasminogen by the PAs, tPA\n(tissue-type PA) and uPA. While both PAs are secreted\nproteases, uPA is unique in that following secretion it binds\nits cell-surface receptor (uPAR) where it is then activated,\ndirecting proteolysis to the pericellular space (Cubellis et al.,\n1986). tPA appears to be the primary PA expressed in the\nintact CNS and is involved in neuronal migration and synaptic\nuPA expression is observed in the adult CNS in the absence of\npathology (Tsirka et al., 1997), with a single report\ndemonstrating uPA up-regulation in the injured spinal motor\nneurons (Minor and Seeds, 2008). The clinical relevance of\nthis observation is substantiated by the observation of\nincreased uPAR expression in ECs in human cases of both\nTBI (traumatic brain injury) and stroke (Beschorner et al.,\n2000). Furthermore, several members of the PAS (uPA, uPAR\nand PAI-1) are expressed in ECs and astrocytes within human\nIn conclusion, the increased TGFb signalling demonstrated\nin the present study might be a double-edged sword. On one\nhand, TGFb1 is known to confer neuroprotection against\nvarious insults, including stroke (Dhandapani and Brann,\n2003). However, increased TGFb signalling probably has\ndestabilizing actions in pathologically activated vessels, in\npart via induction of both VEGF and MMP expression (ten\nDijke and Arthur, 2007). While uPA and plasmin are likely\nregulators of the action of TGFb1 on spinal microvasculature\n2001), the present study suggests a comparable role for\nregulating spinal microvascular plasticity and/or dysfunction\nfollowing SCI. Furthermore, it may be possible that the\nactivation of the EC compartment by TGFb may be\ndownstream of a yet-to-be identified cytokine cascade,\ninvolving IL-6 and/or other growth factors. Acutely attenu-\nating the action of TGFb1 in microvessels following SCI may\nhave therapeutic potential.\n"
