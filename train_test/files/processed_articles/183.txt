Gallo,1 Lisa Cooper-Patrick,2 and Sandra Lesikar3\n'Department of Mental Hygiene, School of Hygiene and Public Health, Department of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry\nand Behavioral Sciences, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University; Baltimore, Maryland.\ndepartment of Medicine, School of Medicine, Department of Health Policy and Management,\nSchool of Hygiene and Public Health, Johns Hopkins University.\n'Department of Mental Hygiene, Johns Hopkins University.\nConsistent with prior work, our hypothesis was that older African Americans are less likely to report dysphoria than\nare older Whites. Study subjects were 968 participants aged 60 years and older in Baltimore, Maryland, and 1,486\nparticipants aged 60 years and older in the Durham-Piedmont region of North Carolina who identified themselves\nas African American or White and who had complete data on symptoms of depression active in the one month prior\nto interview, as well as several covariates thought to be related to depression. The effect of self-reported race on the\nendorsement of symptoms from the section on Major Depression in the Diagnostic Interview Schedule was esti-\nmated employing structural equations with a measurement model. Older African Americans were less likely to re-\nport dysphoria than older Whites, although this only achieved statistical significance by conventional standards at\nthe Durham-Piedmont site. Older African Americans at both sites were significantly more likely to report thoughts\nof death.\nENDORSEMENT of the symptoms of depression, in\ncontrast to a preoccupation with syndromes (Costello,\n1992), has not received a great deal of attention in the liter-\nature on ethnic differences in depression. For this reason,\nthe extent to which differential reporting of symptoms\nmight account for observed differences in diagnosis of\ndepression and other mental disturbances across ethnic\ngroups is not well studied. Despite concerns regarding\ncomparative studies of African Americans and Whites\ncompelling need to understand \"cultural differences in the\nexpression and classification of psychiatric symptoms\"\nThe results of studies that have compared the diagnoses\ngiven to White and African American patients support the\nnotion that depressive illness is relatively underdiagnosed\namong African American patients (Adebimpe, 1981; Jones\nfrom the National Institute of Mental Health Epidemiologic\nCatchment Area (ECA) Program were consistent with lower\nprevalence of depression among African Americans (Robins\n& Regier, 1991; Somervell, Leaf, Weissman, Blazer, &\nBruce, 1989), although the differential in rates of depres-\nsion were not as pronounced as in other studies (e.g., Ver-\nnon & Roberts, 1982, and in studies reviewed by Neighbors\nand colleagues [Neighbors, Jackson, Campbell, & Williams,\n1989]). Clinical investigators have noted the tendency to di-\nagnose African American patients with schizophrenia or\nschizoaffective disorder rather than depression (Jones &\nGray, 1986). Recognition of depression among African\nAmericans in primary care and other health care settings\nmay be hampered by an emphasis on somatic concerns\nStudies of differing symptom presentations are few.\nRaskin and colleagues found few differences in symptoms\nwhen comparing symptoms of 159 African American inpa-\ntients and 555 White inpatients (Raskin, Crook, & Herman,\n1975). After adjusting for age, social class, and gender, a\nmeasure of hostility was rated higher for African Ameri-\ncans than for White patients. African Americans, particu-\nlarly men, reported more suicide attempts than other per-\nsons in the sample. No differences in sleep disturbance,\nfeelings of guilt or worthlessness, hypochondriasis, or dys-\nphoria were found. Liss and coworkers, also working in the\nsetting of an inpatient psychiatry service, found relatively\nfew differences in depressive symptom reports when com-\nparing African Americans and Whites (Liss, Weiner, Robins,\npressed affect was the only symptom more common in\nWhites, while African Americans more commonly reported\ndull affect, delusions of bodily change, delusions of gran-\ndeur, delusions of passivity, auditory hallucinations, visual\nhallucinations, concrete interpretation of proverbs, de-\ncreased need for sleep, and increased speech. Broadhead\nand Garrison studied 102 patients in primary care and\nfound that somatic symptoms were endorsed at similar\nrates in African American and White patients (Broadhead\n& Garrison, 1991). In contrast, Brown and Schulberg found\nmore severe somatic symptoms in African American pri-\nmary care patients (Brown & Schulberg, 1996). These in-\nvestigations did not adjust comparisons for other personal\ncharacteristics such as age or gender.\nBaker has extended this work to older adults, calling at-\ntention to the different symptom patterns found in older\nAfrican Americans in contrast to Whites, as reflected in our\ninitial hypothesis; namely, that older African Americans with\ndepression are less likely to complain of dysphoric mood,\nbut instead have more somatic complaints (Baker, 1991). Ex-\namining responses from general medical outpatients, Baker\nand colleagues qualitatively examined the prevalence of de-\npressive symptoms among 66 African American medical pa-\ntients aged 50 years and older, finding that verbal statements\nof dysphoric mood were not typical for older African Ameri-\ncans (Baker, Parker, Wiley, Velli, & Johnson, 1995).\nDepression may be more common among minorities than\npreviously believed (Jones & Gray, 1986), but if there are\nethnic differences in the tendency to report symptoms\nthought to be salient for the diagnosis of depression, indi-\nviduals will tend to be misclassified and prevalence rates\nwill be biased. We have previously noted in our analysis of\ndepressive symptom variation according to age that the mul-\ntiple indicators, multiple causes (MIMIC) model implied a\nsignificantly increased level of depression among minorities\nat the Baltimore site but not Durham-Piedmont, in contrast\nto prior studies from the ECA employing prevalence data\n(e.g., Somervell et al., 1989) and incidence data (Anthony &\nsis was grounded in the DSM criteria for disorder, but we\ndid not require subjects to meet standard diagnostic criteria\nfor depression. Instead, we employed a latent variable\nmodel of depression that allowed us to examine symptom-\nlevel differences according to self-reported ethnicity. Now\nwe employ this model to test the notion that symptom clus-\nters thought to be essential for certain diagnostic categories\namong White subjects may not be valid among minorities\nConsistent with this prior work, we hypothesized that\nolder African Americans might be more likely to report\nsomatic or vegetative symptoms of depression, and less\nlikely to report symptoms of a psychological nature, espe-\ncially dysphoria, when compared to older Whites. To exam-\nine this issue, we used community data on depressive symp-\ntoms from older adults, and employed an analytic method\nderived from recent developments in evaluating test items\nfor differential item functioning, or bias, among groups of\nexaminees. Methods for the detection of bias in test items\nhave been of interest to test designers in the arena of\nachievement testing (Camilli, 1992; Camilli & Shepard,\nSwaminathan, 1993). In educational achievement testing,\nbias, or differential item functioning, occurs when an item is\nless likely to be answered correctly by one group of exami-\nnees, say girls compared to boys, even when examinees at\nthe same level of ability are compared (Muthen, 1988a). In\nthe domain of psychological testing, adjusting for the level\nof depression and potentially influential covariates should be\nconsidered when making comparisons of symptom endorse-\nment across groups defined by self-reported race or culture\nThis investigation differs from other studies of how\nsymptom reporting reflects ethnicity in several ways. Stud-\nies that examine psychiatric disturbances among different\nethnic groups, if they examine differences in the reporting\nof specific symptoms at all, are limited because they fail to\nstandardize recording of symptoms, are based on reports of\nindividuals under treatment with experience in the specialty\nmental health sector, and do not account for other covari-\nates that might influence the reporting of symptoms. The\nmethod we have used to compare symptoms of depression\naccording to self-reported race, the MIMIC model, has sev-\neral advantages over other methods that might have been\nused to compare item response, as discussed elsewhere\ngroup has previously applied this method to the analysis of\nthe symptoms of depression according to age (Gallo et al.,\n1994), so this study represents an extension of a line of re-\nsearch delineating the salience of the standard criteria for\ndepression across subjects defined by age, race, settings of\ncare, and other characteristics. This study differs from the\nprevious work (Gallo et al., 1994) because here the focus is\nplaced on the endorsement of symptoms by older African\nAmericans and Whites.\nMETHODS\nThe Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program (ECA) was\na series of epidemiologic surveys conducted by collabora-\nStates: New Haven, Connecticut (Yale University); Balti-\nmore, Maryland (Johns Hopkins University); St. Louis,\nMissouri (Washington University); Durham-Piedmont,\nNorth Carolina (Duke University); and Los Angeles, Cali-\nfornia (University of California, Los Angeles). At each site,\nECA collaborators used multistage probability sampling to\nstandardized interview, the Diagnostic Interview Schedule\n(DIS; Robins, Helzer, Croughan, & Ratcliff, 1981). The\nstandardized questions of the DIS were keyed to individual\ncriteria of the DSM-III case definition for Major Depres-\nsion (American Psychiatric Association, 1980).\nPositive responses to the questions were followed by fur-\nther questioning to determine whether a threshold for sever-\nity had been met and whether the symptom was plausible as\na psychiatric symptom; that is, the symptom could not be\nexplained by physical illness, medications, alcohol, or drug\nrespondents rated the onset and recency of syndromes, that\nis, clusters of symptoms, so that the timing of disorders\ncould be estimated. To meet the DSM-III diagnostic criteria\nfor Major Depression, an individual must have depressed\nmood (dysphoria) or loss of interest in things normally en-\njoyed (anhedonia) for two weeks or more, and at least four\nof eight additional criteria. However, a diagnosis of Major\nDepression was not required for inclusion in our analysis.\nIn Baltimore and in Durham-Piedmont, information on\nonset and recency was gathered at the symptom level, so\nthat data on recency of individual symptoms are available\nfor the criteria of DSM-III Major Depression (Von Korff &\nAnthony, 1982). If the respondent \"ever\" had the symptom,\nthe respondent was then asked when the last time the symp-\ntom was present. In this study, item parcels were created\nfrom the symptom-level data (West, Finch, & Curran,\n1995). Specifically, item parcels were created for the symp-\ntom criteria appetite disturbance, sleep disturbance, psy-\nchomotor retardation or agitation, concentration difficulty,\nand thoughts of death, as described in detail here.\nDetailed descriptions of the sampling design, the diag-\nnostic assessments, and other aspects of the ECA have been\npublished elsewhere, including several studies of DIS relia-\nbility and validity (Anthony et al., 1985; Eaton & Kessler,\nmonth prior to the interview were rated as \"present\" for the\ncurrent analysis.\nAnalytic Strategy\nThe analysis was restricted to household data from re-\nspondents aged 60 years and older at the Baltimore, Mary-\nland, and Piedmont, North Carolina, sites. The availability\nof two sets of data allowed us to compare differences in\nsymptom endorsement found at the Baltimore site with the\nresponses from the Durham-Piedmont site, that is, in two\nindependently gathered samples. Information on self-\nreported race was obtained by asking the following ques-\ntion: \"Would you please look at this card and give me the\nletter of the group that best describes your racial back-\nground?\" The respondent then selected from a list: American\nIndian, Alaskan Native, Asian, Pacific Islander, Black-Not\nHispanic, Hispanic, White-Not Hispanic. We restricted this\nstudy to persons who identified themselves as either\n\"Black-Not Hispanic\" or \"White-Not Hispanic.\" In addi-\ntion, only persons with complete data on symptoms along\nwith the covariates of gender, minority status, educational\nstatus, marital status, and mental status score were included\nin this analysis. The implication of selecting only individuals\nwith complete data is considered in our discussion of study\nresults.\nThe MIMIC model, described below, includes dichoto-\nmous variables for self-reported race (White = 0; African\nAmerican = 1), gender (male = 0; female =1), educational\nstatus (12 or more years of schooling = 0; fewer than 12\nyears = 1), marital status (married or living with someone\nas though married = 0; not currently married =1), and men-\ntal status score (above a standard criterion value = 0; below\nthe standard criterion value =1). The Mini-Mental State\nExamination (MMSE) score (range, 0 to 30; Folstein, Fol-\nstein, & McHugh, 1975) was employed as a measure of\nmental status (Tombaugh & Mclntyre, 1992). The decisions\non how to code the variables were reached after consider-\ning what variables might modify the tendency to endorse\nsadness or loss of interest or pleasure, but before any data\nanalysis was completed.\nThe MIMIC Model\nLazarsfeld and Henry (1968) and, later, Bartholomew\n(1987), defined latent variables as unobserved variables that\nexplain the association among a set of observed variables.\nThis definition is consistent with the notion of a factor in\nfactor analysis; the factor explains the observed correlations\nin the observed variables. The approach in standard factor\nanalysis assumes that variables are normally distributed and\nrelated to each other in a linear and additive fashion. How-\never, new analytical methods permit the appropriate use of\ndichotomous symptom data. We used a formulation of the\nThe MIMIC model is a special application of the latent\ntrait model which enables item bias to be detected across\ngroups of individuals, whether distinguished by race, gen-\nder, age, or other characteristics (Muthe\"n, 1989b). We have\nintroduced covariates to the MIMIC model in order to ex-\namine differential item functioning by self-reported race,\nadjusting for differences in the level of the latent trait and\nfor the effect of other covariates such as gender (Figure 1).\nIn addition to race, four covariates are introduced to adjust\nfor differences in level of depression due to gender, educa-\ntional status, MMSE score, and marital status, as defined\nearlier.\nFigure 1 illustrates the three components of the MIMIC\nmodel: (1) the measurement model; (2) the regression\nmodel; and (3) the estimate of the direct effect of ethnicity\non the reporting of individual symptoms. These compo-\nnents are estimated simultaneously, using the LISCOMP\nprogram's limited information generalized least squares\nIn the measurement model, the dichotomous symptoms\n(symptom present within one month of interview = 1, or\nnot present = 0) are considered to be the indicators of an\nunderlying latent dimension of depression. The estimate of\nthe latent variable for depression is based on the covaria-\ntion that the symptom items have in common, in contrast to\na simple sum of depressive symptoms. In the regression\nmodel, the latent variable depression is regressed on the co-\nvariates. As in ordinary multiple regression, the estimates\nof these regression coefficients represent the difference in\nthe value of the outcome variable for one group compared\nto another. Finally, the estimate of the direct effect for eth-\nnicity on a given symptom of depression represents a shift\nin the measurement characteristics for that symptom com-\nparing African Americans to Whites. A significant negative\ndirect effect implies that, even adjusting for other character-\nistics and the level of depression, compared to Whites,\nAfrican Americans endorse the symptom at a lower preva-\nlence than expected; that is, the symptom exhibits differen-\ntial item functioning. Conversely, a positive direct effect is\ninterpreted to mean that the symptom is more likely to be\nendorsed by African Americans than by Whites, all other\ncharacteristics considered. Further details of the statistical\nmodel employed can be found elsewhere (Gallo et al., 1994;\nRESULTS\ninterviewed in the household survey in Baltimore, while\nhold sample in Durham-Piedmont. These figures exclude\nsubjects who did not identify themselves as either African\nAmerican or White. After excluding persons without com-\nplete information on DIS symptom data and all covariates,\n968 subjects remained for analysis from the Baltimore site\nand 1,486 subjects remained from the Durham-Piedmont\nsite (Table 1). The African Americans in Baltimore tended\nto include fewer persons not living with a spouse compared\nto the African Americans in Durham-Piedmont (Table 2).\nAmong Whites, fewer persons in Baltimore reported less\nthan a high school education and fewer reported not living\nwith a spouse compared to Whites in Durham-Piedmont\n(Table 2).\nTable 3 contains the wording of the DIS questions used to\nmake operational the DSM-III criteria for depression as well\nas the one month prevalence of item parcels. Inspection of\nthe prevalences shown in the table reveals that, for the most\npart, the one month prevalence estimates for symptoms\nwere higher among African Americans than among Whites\nin Baltimore, but tended to be lower among African Ameri-\ncans compared with Whites in Durham-Piedmont.\nSimple tests of model fit based on the chi-square statistic\nare likely to reject good fitting models when the sample\nsize is large. For this reason, several alternative indices of\nmodel fit were calculated for the MIMIC models. Values\nfor the fit indices range from zero, indicating poor fit, to\nthe Baltimore analyses and 0.98 for the Durham-Piedmont\nanalyses. An adjusted goodness-of-fit index that accounts\nfor the number of model parameters was 0.97 for the Balti-\nmore analyses and 0.99 for the Durham-Piedmont analyses.\nThe calculated indices indicate good model fit.

The covariance structure of\nthe symptom level data from the two sites was consistent\nwith a single factor, as evidenced by a scree plot of eigen-\nThe parameter estimates for the MIMIC models using\nDIS data are presented in Tables 4 and 5. The first set of es-\ntimates relates to the regression of depression on the co-\nvariates of race, gender, education, MMSE score, and mari-\ntal status (Table 4). The interpretation of the significantly\nhigher estimate for African Americans at the Baltimore site\nwas that older African Americans are higher on the latent\ntrait of depression when compared with older Whites. At\nthe Durham-Piedmont site, older African Americans had\na mean level of depression that was lower than that of\nWhites. As anticipated, women, persons with less than a\nhigh school education, and persons who were not married\nalso reported higher levels of depression according to the\nMIMIC model, although these were not significantly differ-\nent from the null value for the estimates derived from the\nsymptom data obtained at the Baltimore site.\nFocusing attention on the Baltimore site, examination of\nthe estimates in Table 5 for the direct effect of ethnicity on\nthe symptoms of depression indicate several items with dif-\nferential item functioning according to self-reported ethnic-\nity. Examining the estimates from the Baltimore site, sleep\ndisturbance was less likely to be endorsed by African Amer-\nicans than Whites, given level of depression and the other\npotentially influential covariates. Difficulty with concentrat-\ning and thoughts of death were more likely to be reported by\nolder African Americans one month prior to interview, when\ncompared with older Whites. Older African Americans were\nless likely to report other symptoms, but the difference did\nnot reach generally accepted standards for statistical signifi-\ncance. The key symptom of sadness was noted to be less\nlikely to be endorsed by African Americans at both sites (the\npoint estimate for the direct effect is negative). We tested\nthe extent to which these results were replicable using re-\nsults in the responses from subjects in the Durham-Pied-\nmont sample. As indicated in Table 5, three symptoms\ndemonstrated statistically significant differences in African\nAmericans compared with Whites at the Durham-Piedmont\nsite; namely, sadness, loss of interest, and thoughts of death.\nThe finding regarding the item parcel of \"thinking about\ndeath or suicide\" deserves closer examination.

Only symptoms present in\nthe one month prior to the interview were rated as present for the current analysis. Data were gathered from the Baltimore and Durham-Piedmont Epi-\neel related to thoughts of death consisted of three questions\ndealing with thinking a lot about death, wanting to die, or\nthoughts of committing suicide (Table 3). While older\nAfrican Americans were more likely to endorse this item\nparcel than were Whites in the MIMIC model, the main dif-\nference in endorsement arose from the item about thoughts\nof death. Specifically, Whites in Baltimore and Durham-\nPiedmont endorsed thoughts of death at similar rates (6.04%\nand 6.32%, respectively), while African Americans in the\ntwo samples endorsed thoughts of death at higher rates than\nmont). In contrast, endorsement of wanting to die was simi-\nlar in Whites and African Americans (1.61% among Whites\nand 1.40% among African Americans in Baltimore, and\nin Durham-Piedmont). No African Americans at either site\nendorsed thoughts of committing suicide (compared to\nPiedmont).\nDISCUSSION\nOur results were not wholly consistent with our initial\nhypothesis regarding depressive symptoms reported by\nolder African Americans compared with older Whites. At\nboth sites studied, older African Americans were more\nlikely to report thoughts of death, but we failed to find any\npattern of older African Americans being more likely to\nreport symptoms of a somatic or vegetative nature (e.g., ap-\npetite disturbance). On the other hand, it is interesting that\nolder African Americans were generally less likely to report\nsadness than older Whites (although this difference failed\nto reach statistical significance by conventional standards in\nthe Baltimore sample). We used an analytic approach that is\ngenerally applicable whenever it is necessary to adjust for\nlevels of depression and potentially influential characteris-\ntics, such as gender, in estimating whether there is differen-\ntial item functioning according to race or culture. Few stud-\nies comparing responses of African Americans and Whites\nhave focused on item level differences in depression, as we\nhave done here.\nTable 4.

Second, the data on symp-\ntoms were collected in a standardized manner employing\nitems keyed to the criteria set forth in the third edition of\nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-III) of the\nAmerican Psychiatric Association (American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 1980), so that symptoms can be studied in re-\nlation to the standard diagnostic criteria, as opposed to\nsome general measure of psychologic distress. Third, we\nused an analytic strategy with advantages over other meth-\nods that have been developed to study heterogeneity in\nmeasurement (Muthen, 1989b), a strategy that allowed us\nto examine the relationship of race to particular symptoms\nwhile holding constant the influence of other characteris-\ntics, such as gender and the level of depression.\nOther methods employed to study group differences in\nitem response are limited in their ability: (1) to control for\nimportant covariates (e.g., methods based on the Mantel-\nHaenszel statistic; Nandakumar, Glutting, & Oakland, 1993;\n(2) to employ a latent variable model with explicit speci-\nfication of measurement error (e.g., logistic regression;\nor (3) to analyze sparse or skewed symptom data (e.g., mul-\nTable 5.

Standard er-\nrors for estimates are shown in parentheses.\nBaltimore\nDurham-Piedmont\ntiple-group factor analysis; Horn & McArdle, 1992). In ad-\ndition, most prior work on ethnic differences in symptoms\nhas been carried out among patients in the specialty mental\nWeiner et al., 1973), so that observed symptom differences\nthat might account for differing rates of diagnosis accord-\ning to race or ethnicity are confounded by differential ac-\ncess to health services. Other characteristics that influence\nthe reporting of symptoms, such as gender, or level of de-\npression, are rarely considered.\nNeighbors called attention to the assumption that instru-\nments measure the same construct when instruments devel-\noped among Whites are applied to African Americans or\nother minority ethnic groups (Neighbors & Lumpkin,\n1990); in other words, that measurement invariance holds.\nMeasurement invariance implies that symptoms have the\nsame relationship to an underlying psychiatric disturbance\nacross individuals, that the same construct is being mea-\nsured (Horn & McArdle, 1992). The focused aim of the\nstructural equation model employed here was to examine\nthe measurement characteristics of the DIS at the symptom\nlevel according to self-reported race. External and internal\nrelations among the variables and the construct of depres-\nsion were simultaneously estimated in the MIMIC model,\nproviding a model of external and internal construct validity\n(McArdle & Prescott, 1992). Furthermore, estimation pro-\ncedures were appropriate given the dichotomous nature of\nBefore discussion of the study results, a number of lim-\nitations must be addressed. First, certain assumptions about\nthe validity and assessment of the concept of ethnicity un-\nderlie the concept of \"race\" used in surveys (Hahn, 1992).\nWe have assumed that participants understand and respond\nconsistently to questions about ethnicity. Second, labels em-\nployed for ethnicity imply a homogeneity within groups. In-\nstead, it is likely mat differences ascribed to \"race\" reflect\nsocial more than genetic differences (Cooper & David,\nother hand, failure to account for heterogeneity in measure-\nment of depressive symptoms might be misleading in com-\nparing prevalence of symptoms or disorders according to\nethnicity (Neighbors & Lumpkin, 1990). Third, we could\nnot explicitly include in the model somatic complaints re-\nspondents may have experienced. We do not know the ex-\ntent to which African Americans ascribed their symptoms to\na physical illness; however, symptoms ascribed to a physical\nillness were not counted in the present analysis. Fourth,\nchronic medical conditions may also affect the pattern of de-\npressive symptoms endorsed and are not included in the\nmodel. Instead, we have chosen to adjust our estimates for\nother characteristics that can be assessed more reliably than\nself-report of medical diagnoses (such as level of educa-\ntional attainment) but which are themselves associated with\nfunctional and medical status. Fifth, the tendency to report\nsymptoms could have been affected in unknown ways by\nthe ethnic or racial background of the interviewer. It is pos-\nsible that African Americans were reluctant to report certain\nsymptoms to a White interviewer, or that White participants\nwere reluctant to report certain symptoms to an African\nAmerican interviewer. Finally, the MIMIC model itself is\nassociated with a number of limitations that are discussed at\nDespite limitations, the study calls attention to a key\nsymptom that appears to be differentially reported by African\nAmericans and Whites: sadness. Another important clue to\ndepression, sleep disturbance, was less likely to be reported\nby older African Americans than by Whites at the Baltimore\nsite. Older African Americans in Baltimore were more likely\nto report trouble concentrating when compared with Whites.\nAt the Durham-Piedmont site, older African Americans were\nless likely to report loss of interest. Thoughts of death were\nmore likely to be reported by African Americans at both\nsites. Differences between sites likely reflect characteristics\nof the samples that were not included in the model, such as\nrural-urban contrasts, or may simply reflect sampling fluc-\ntuation. Older African American adults at the rural site may\nbe generally more reluctant to report symptoms (the mean\nlevel of depression was significantly less than the null value\nof zero).\nOlder African Americans were more likely than older\nWhites to report thoughts of death, but not suicidal ideation,\ncompared with Whites in both samples studied. Thoughts of\ndeath (one's own or others) may not be inherently depressive,\nbut could be part of one's cultural world view and experi-\nences. Older adults may have increased thoughts of death as a\ndevelopmental consideration (Macdonald & Dunn, 1982), so\nthat thoughts of death per se may be nonspecific in detecting\ndepression. Suicidal ideation, however, is not developmen-\ntally normal for older adults. Environmental stress is insuffi-\ncient to produce suicidal ideation except in persons who per-\nceive few options (Bonner & Rich, 1988; Brown, Hentcleff,\n& Barskat, 1986). Associated with suicidal ideation are intol-\nerable pain, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, and a\n\"constricted\" cognitive state (Schneiderman, 1986). Cooper-\nPatrick and colleagues found that suicidal ideation was pre-\ndicted by hopelessness, guilt, depressed mood, and sleep dis-\nturbance (Cooper-Patrick, Crum, & Ford, 1994). In that study\nbased on all five ECA sites, African Americans were less\nlikely than Whites to report suicidal ideation. Although\nthoughts of death may be more common among the elderly,\nand suicide rates increase with age (La Vecchia, Lucchini, &\nLevi, 1994), suicidal ideation appears to be generally less\ncommon among older adults when compared with younger\nOther studies have focused on thoughts of death and sui-\ncidal ideation among older people. Based on a stratified\nsample of older primary care attenders, Callahan and col-\nleagues estimated the prevalence of suicidal ideation at 0.7%\nAmong patients reporting suicidal ideation, severity of\ndepressive symptoms and functional impairment varied\nwidely. Unfortunately, no demographic or clinical variables\ndistinguished depressed suicidal patients from depressed\nnonsuicidal patients (Callahan et al., 1996). Half the pa-\ntients with suicidal ideation reported a history of depres-\nsion. Skoog and colleagues (1996) found that, among per-\nsons aged 85 years and older living in Gothenberg,\nSweden, who did not have diagnosable mental disorders,\n0.9% reported thoughts of taking their own lives within one\nmonth of interview. Older patients with Major Depression,\nhowever, were much more likely to express thoughts of\ndeath or suicide. These studies that focused on older adults\ndid not examine differences in endorsement of symptoms\naccording to ethnicity as we have done here. Depression is\nthe psychiatric condition most often linked to suicide\namong older adults. Conwell and colleagues (Conwell &\nchological autopsy all suicides within a geographical re-\ngion, found that with increasing age, depression was more\nlikely to be unaccompanied by other psychiatric conditions,\nsuch as substance abuse. Up to half of the elderly victims of\nsuicide had seen their physician within one month of their\ndeath, the majority had seen their general physician within\nthree months of the suicide (Barraclough, 1971; Clark,\npresentations of depression according to ethnicity might\nhelp in identifying who may be at risk for worsening de-\npression or even suicide.\nCross-cultural heterogeneity in studies of depression may\ninfluence the symptoms expressed and, hence, the diagnosis\nof syndromal depression. Like all investigations with a phe-\nnomenological orientation, cross-cultural studies are com-\npelled to use multivariate statistical techniques to study\nsymptom patterns, avoiding a reliance on a priori diag-\nnostic categories (Blashfield, 1990; Marsella, Sartorius,\nJablensky, & Fenton, 1985). Some cultures do not have\nconcepts that are equivalent to a Western notion of depres-\nsion. The Hopi Indians of Arizona, for example, describe an\nillness similar to Major Depression but without dysphoria\n(Manson, Shore, & Bloom, 1985). People in some cultures\nhave difficulty finding the words to describe depression\n1973). Neurasthenic patients in China deny dysphoria, but\ndo exhibit the other symptoms of depression, such as psy-\nchomotor retardation and somatic complaints. Even when\nChinese neurasthenic patients report dysphoria, they see it\nas a result of pain they are experiencing, especially head-\nIn conclusion, our study did not support our initial hy-\npothesis that older African Americans would be more likely\nthan older Whites to report depressive symptoms of a\nsomatic nature and less likely to report symptoms of a\npsychological nature. Based on conventional levels of sta-\ntistical significance, only thoughts of death were more fre-\nquently reported by older African Americans in both sam-\nples studied. Consistent with prior studies, there was\nevidence that older African Americans were less likely to\nreport sadness when compared with older Whites. Close at-\ntention to symptom patterns is essential if subsyndromal\nforms of depressive illness are to be understood, and our\nfindings suggest that further work is needed on the issue of\nmeasurement invariance in psychiatric research.\n"
