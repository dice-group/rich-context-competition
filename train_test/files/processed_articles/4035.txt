The \"never catch\nup hypothesis\" was suggested by the blood pressure\nresponses reported in two trials,VALUE2 and ASCOT,3\nand was based on the premise that poor responses to mon-\notherapy are, in part, due to the reflex activation of coun-\nter-regulatory responses that may, in the longer term, affect\nBP control by combination drugs.\nPATHWAY 1, was a parallel group, randomised, dou-\nble-blind trial, carried out in hypertensive patients with\nuntreated home systolic BP > 150 mmHg or diastolic BP >\n95 mmHg. Six hundred and five patients were randomised\nin a double-blind study to sequential monotherapy with\neither hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg, or losartan 50 mg, or\ncombination therapy with the two drugs. After a period of\nfour weeks, doses of the drugs were doubled for a further\nfour weeks. The monotherapy arms then crossed over for a\nsimilar time period during which the combination therapy\narm continued on optimal dosage (phase 1). At the end of\nthe second monotherapy period all patients continued for a\nfurther 16 weeks on combination therapy (phase 2). The\nprimary endpoint was the difference from baseline in home\nSBP, compared between monotherapy and the combina-\ntion, first averaged across phases 1 and 2 and then at the\nend of phase 2. In a third phase of the study, additional\ndrugs could be added openly (amlodipine and doxazosin)\nin those who failed to reach target blood pressures.\nThis trial and indeed the other PATHWAY trials were\nunique in that they were the first trials to use home blood\npressure measurements as the basis for patient inclusion\nand management throughout the trial.\nThe results of PATHWAY 1 have been presented but\nawait publication. Whilst the underlying hypothesis was\nrejected by the finding that both arms of the trial achieved\nidentical blood pressure reduction at the time of evaluation\nof the primary endpoint, the time course for blood pressure\nreduction in those subject to sequential monotherapy was\nmuch slower than in those starting with combination treat-\nment. There was no excess of withdrawals from treatment\nin the combination treatment group; however, there were\nmore reports of symptoms suggesting hypotension on\ncombination therapy.\nThe implication of these findings is that new hyperten-\nsive patients embarking on treatment with traditional mon-\notherapy will be exposed to higher pressures for longer\ntime periods than those initiated with combination treat-\nment. At a population level this clearly will increase risk of\nmajor cardiovascular events.\nPATHWAY 24 was designed to investigate optimal\ntreatment for patients with resistant hypertension.\nGuidelines, notably the NICE Guidelines,5 provide treat-\nment algorithms for hypertensive patients which specify\nthe first three drugs (an angiotensin converting enzyme\ninhibitor [ACEI], or an angiotensin receptor blocker\n[ARB], a calcium channel blocker [CCB], and a thiazide-\nlike diuretic) together with recommendations for add-on\ntherapy for those who fail to achieve BP goals on three\ndrugs. There are, however, no trials of additional drug\ntreatment to provide insight into optimal treatment. This is\nWill the recent hypertension\ntrials change the guidelines?\nPeter Sever\nKeywords\nHypertension, trials, guidelines, patients, cost\nInternational Centre for Circulatory Health, National Heart and Lung\nInstitute, Imperial College London, UK\nCorresponding author:\nPeter Sever, International Centre for Circulatory Health, National\nHeart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, UK.\nEmail: p.sever@imperial.ac.uk\nCommentary\n2   \nparticularly important because there remain a substantial\nnumber of resistant hypertensive patients at high residual\ncardiovascular risk for whom there are no clear guidelines\nfor preferred treatment, but an increasing number of costly,\ninvasive interventions, advocated by many, but for which\nthere is doubtful objective evidence of real benefit.\nPATHWAY 2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled,\ncrossover study carried out in 348 hypertensive patients\nreceiving three antihypertensive drugs in optimal or best-\ntolerated doses, and whose BP was uncontrolled (clinic\nobserved drug ingestion and subsequent BP monitoring.\nPatients received sequential treatment with spironolactone\nmg) or placebo, assigned in random order, in addition to\ntheir baseline treatment. Each cycle was for 12 weeks\nduration with dose force titrated at six weeks. The hierar-\nchical primary endpoints were the difference in home SBP\nbetween spironolactone and placebo followed by the dif-\nference in home SBP between spironolactone and the aver-\nage of the two other active drugs and finally the difference\nin home SBP between spironolactone and each of the two\nother active drugs.\nSpironolactone was substantially more effective than\nplacebo (-8.70 mmHg), and significantly more effective\nA critical finding in this trial was that spironolactone\ncontrolled home SBP in almost 60% of patients (and an\neven greater percentage if clinic pressures were used). In\naddition, over 75% of patients had a > 10 mmHg reduction\nin SBP.\nThese observations, in conjunction with the fact that BP\nresponses to spironolactone were inversely related to plasma\nrenin, confirm the view that sodium retention plays a major\nrole in the pathophysiology of resistant hypertension.\nThese results should be viewed in the context of the\nmany invasive intervention trials in so-called drug-resist-\nant hypertension, particularly in the light of the fact that\nmany recruits into these trials were not receiving or had\nnot received a trial of spironolactone.\nIn PATHWAY 2, concerns about hyperkalaemia with\nspironolactone were not realized. Discontinuations due to\nrenal impairment, hyperkalaemia and gynaecomastia were\nnot increased in those assigned to spironolactone com-\npared with the other drugs.\nPATHWAY 36 was designed to explore whether the\naddition or substitution of a potassium-sparing diuretic\nwould prevent the glucose intolerance associated with a\nthiazide diuretic and improve blood pressure control.\nMany guidelines have advocated the use of low-dose thi-\nazide diuretics in the treatment of hypertension yet the evi-\ndence for cardiovascular event reduction was based on\ntrials of higher doses of thiazides, thiazide-like diuretics\n(chlorthalidone, indapamide) or combinations of diuretics\nsuch as hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)/amiloride.\nThe development of glucose intolerance associated\nwith thiazides appears linked to the development of\nhypokalaemia, and PATHWAY 3 addressed this issue with\na comparison of the metabolic effects of a thiazide, ami-\nloride and the combination.\nFour hundred and forty-one hypertensive patients with\none component of the metabolic syndrome, on background\nantihypertensive drugs requiring additional therapy, were\nrandomised to HCTZ 25 mg, amiloride 10 mg or the com-\nbination of HCTZ 12.5 mg/amiloride 5 mg. Doses were\ndoubled after 12 weeks of treatment for a further 12 weeks.\nThe primary endpoint was the difference in blood glu-\ncose measured two hours after a 75 g oral glucose load.\nSecondary endpoints included differences in home SBP,\nplasma electrolytes and renin.\nTwo-hour glucose rose on HCTZ, and fell on both ami-\nloride and the combination. A greater fall in home SBP at\n24 weeks treatment was seen on the combination (-19\nmmHg), than either HCTZ (-14 mmHg) or amiloride (-16\nmmHg) despite the combination being used in half the\ndoses of the individual components. Importantly serum\npotassium fell on HCTZ, rose on amiloride and was\nunchanged on the combination.\nThese observations clearly demonstrated that the glu-\ncose intolerance associated with thiazides was closely\nlinked to hypokalaemia and could be abolished when the\nthiazide was combined with amiloride. Given the well-\nestablished benefits of the HCTZ/amiloride combination\non cardiovascular outcome reported in the Medical\nResearch Trial in Elderly Patients7 and the International\nNifedipine GITS Study Intervention as a Goal in\nHypertension Treatment (INSIGHT),8 PATHWAY 3 pro-\nvides compelling evidence for this combination to replace\nthiazide and thiazide-like diuretics in clinical practice, par-\nticularly in those patients at increased risk of developing\nnew-onset diabetes (NOD). No doubt some will argue that\nNOD induced by thiazides does not carry the cardiovascu-\nlar risk associated with non-drug-induced diabetes;9 how-\never, this remains a highly controversial issue. Logic\nsurely dictates that if you can prevent major metabolic\nconsequences of a drug treatment by replacement with an\nalternative that carries no such risk, and for which there is\nexcellent evidence for outcome benefits, a combination of\nthiazide/amiloride should be the preferred choice diuretic\nfor most hypertensive patients.\nThese three trials were carried out over a period of five\nyears, in 12 secondary and two primary care centres in the\nUK. All were part of a framework established by the BHS.\nThe working party was established to address a number of\nimportant but unanswered questions in hypertension man-\nagement at a time when most antihypertensive drug classes\nwere available in generic formulation and there seemed lit-\ntle hope for industry sponsorship. In comparison with\nindustry-funded trials they were carried out at substan-\ntially lower cost, despite the requirements for meeting the\ndemands of the drug regulatory bodies for trial oversight\nand management. The trials were supported by a grant\nfrom the British Heart Foundation and the UK National\nInstitute for Health Research through infrastructure sup-\nport at regional level to the recruiting centres. The BHS\nworking party is now challenged with the design of and\nfunding for new studies to provide further insight into opti-\nmal management of patients with hypertension.\nOne objective of the PATHWAY Programme of trials\nwas to provide an evidence base for new guidelines for the\nmanagement of hypertensive patients.\nPATHWAY 2 clearly establishes the case for recom-\nmending spironolactone as the optimal 4th line drug in\nthe treatment algorithm for patients with resistant hyper-\ntensive patients, whilst PATHWAY 3 provides an impor-\ntant insight into the different metabolic effects of the\ndiuretics commonly used in hypertension treatment\nstrategies and evidence for the benefits of a thiazide/\namiloride combination. In some respects the outcome of\nPATHWAY 1 was disappointing in that the \"never catch\nup\" hypothesis was refuted. Had it been upheld then\nthe case for initial combination therapy as opposed to\nthe more traditional monotherapy would have been a\npowerful one. Nevertheless with increasing evidence\nthat failure to get to goal BP exposes patients to continu-\ning hypertensive risk of stroke and coronary heart dis-\nease events, PATHWAY 1 provides substantial evidence\nthat initial combination therapy achieves more rapid\nblood pressure reduction safely and with the vast major-\nity of patients reaching target BP within a few weeks of\nonset of treatment.\nSchematic of PATHWAY trials\nPATHWAY 1 and PATHWAY 3 parallel group comparisons.\nPATHWAY 2 randomised crossover design (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Schematic of PATHWAY trials.\nSystolic blood pressure intervention\ntrial: SPRINT\nFor more than a decade discussions have taken place on\nthe need for a trial designed to determine optimum systolic\ntreatment goals to prevent cardiovascular outcomes.\nDuring the 20th century, treatment thresholds and targets\nwere set by diastolic pressure readings, largely dependent\non the historical focus of diastolic as the more important of\nthe two blood pressure readings, the fact that older inter-\nvention trials in hypertension also used predominantly\ndiastolic thresholds and that guidelines had no hard evi-\ndence base on which to recommend optimal systolic blood\npressure targets. Treatment trials in the elderly more\nrecently focused on systolic thresholds but there has been\nno clear evidence that lowering systolic blood pressure\nmiddle-aged and elderly population. Guidelines have,\nhowever, consistently advocated a 140 mmHg target,\nwhilst admitting that the evidence base is lacking.\nThe dearth of new antihypertensive molecules and the\nwithdrawal by major pharma of investment in hyperten-\nsion research has meant that new trials addressing impor-\ntant unanswered questions about optimal treatment\nstrategies have been lacking. It was perhaps inevitable,\ntherefore, that the only independent funding body with\nsufficient resources to fund a systolic pressure intervention\ntrial designed to ascertain optimal treatment targets was\nthe US National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and,\ntogether with the coordinating committee, they are to be\ncongratulated for designing and conducting this long-\nawaited trial.\nSPRINT10 was an open label randomised parallel group\nclinical trial carried out in approximately 100 sites in the\nUSA. Nine thousand, three hundred and sixty-one adults\naged 50 years or older with systolic blood pressure >130\nmmHg and at least one additional cardiovascular risk fac-\ntor were randomised to either intensive treatment designed\nto achieve a systolic pressure of <120 mmHg, or less inten-\nsive treatment with a goal of <140 mmHg (Figure 2). The\n4   \nprimary outcome was a combination of non-fatal myocar-\ndial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, non-fatal stroke,\nheart failure and cardiovascular death. Follow-up was\nplanned for a maximum of six years.\nSystolic blood pressures at one year were 121.4 mmHg\nin the intensive group and 136.2 in the standard treatment\ngroup. The trial was stopped prematurely after 3.3 years\nowing to a significant benefit in the primary endpoint (HR\nSerious adverse events, including hypotension, syncope\nand renal complications were, however, increased in the\nintensive treatment group.\nThese are extraordinary outcomes for a number of rea-\nsons, the main reason being that the on-treatment analyses\nreported by the Blood Pressure Treatment Trialists\nCollaboration showed that in the non-diabetic hypertensive\npopulation there was no additional cardiovascular benefit\nparticipants. This raises the question as to whether the\nSPRINT population was different in any way from the\nusual hypertensive population within this age group and,\nmore particularly, whether the SPRINT results can be\nextrapolated to all hypertensives, particularly those with\nmuch higher initial pressures, and those with diabetes.\nOne of the main concerns about the methodology used\nin SPRINT was that blood pressure was measured in an\nenvironment in which there was no doctor or nurse pre-\nsent. This, more basal blood pressure, has been shown to\nbe equivalent to a routine clinic pressure of at least\n10-15mm systolic higher - thus reflecting a benefit of\nachieving a usual clinic blood pressure <140 mmHg, rather\nthan a blood pressure of <120 mmHg systolic !\nOn average, one additional drug was needed to achieve\nthe lower pressure targets. On the positive side the num-\nbers needed to treat to prevent one primary outcome, death\nfrom any cause and death from a cardiovascular cause dur-\nwas a significant excess of hypotension, syncope, electro-\nlyte disturbance and renal impairment in those assigned\nintensive treatment. The population excluded those with\ndiabetes, who in the ACCORD trial12 did not benefit from\nmore intensive treatment, although in that trial, in a sub-\ngroup analysis, there were some additional benefits of sys-\ntolic pressure reduction to <120 mmHg.\nMany patients in the standard care group in SPRINT\nhad antihypertensive drugs withdrawn in order to prevent\nthe achievement of lower systolic pressures and the conse-\nquences of this practice are unknown.\nWorldwide control of blood pressure in hypertensive\npatients is very poor. In many countries more than 50% of\ntreated patients fail to be controlled to <140 mmHg systolic\npressure. Whilst there are many reasons for poor control, the\nresults of SPRINT should encourage physicians to focus on\nsystolic targets, rather than diastolic targets, and aim to\nachieve control to at least 140 mmHg in the majority of their\npatients using published treatment algorithms and await fur-\nther evidence of benefits of achieving lower targets.\nAs the SPRINT investigators advocate, it is vital to\nassess achieved blood pressure comprehensively by multi-\nple measurements, ideally with home blood pressure\nmeasurements or 24-hour ambulatory recordings. Single\nclinic readings will grossly overestimate usual blood pres-\nsure and aggressive therapy based on unrepresentative\nreadings of blood pressure could result in adverse conse-\nquences of too low blood pressure.\nSPRINT study design\nObservations on the \"J\"-Curve\nrelationship\nSeveral observational studies and updated meta-analyses\nof the intervention trials in hypertension have been\npublished.13,14,15 These studies have addressed the issue as\nto whether low levels of blood pressure, particularly dias-\ntolic pressure, are associated with an increase in coronary\nand other CV events. Most of these studies, both observa-\ntional and interventional, have failed to show any evidence\nfor a \"J\"-curve relationship. However, a comprehensive\nobservational study in over 22,000 hypertensive patients\nwith established coronary disease, followed up over a\nperiod of seven years, demonstrated that those with low\ndiastolic pressures had an increase in CHD events and all-\ncause mortality, with a nadir of around 75 mmHg diastolic\npressure.16 Whilst these data are robust, the question is\nwhether the achievement of low diastolic pressures is a\ntreatment effect, or whether it is a phenomenon associated\nwith large artery pathology, an established marker for\nCVD events, i.e. reverse causation.\nWill the results of SPRINT influence\nnew guidelines for the management\nof hypertension?\nThe current treatment targets for most hypertensive\npatients is 140 mmHg systolic pressure - a goal that\nremains elusive for most patients in clinical practice.\nFigure 2. SPRINT study design.\nWhilst in North America it is likely that the results of\nSPRINT will be applied by many physicians to achieve\nlower targets, it remains to be seen whether the US\nGuidelines and new European Guidelines will urge cau-\ntion based on a critical review of the blood pressure\nassessment technique applied in SPRINT, and remain\nmore conservative in keeping with today's recommenda-\ntion of a goal of <140 mmHg systolic. For those with\ndiabetes there is evidence that, for stroke, a lower sys-\ntolic target of 130 mmHg is beneficial, but for other out-\ncomes there is no advantage below 140 mmHg. The\nrecent trials provide no new data for those with chronic\nrenal disease.\nThere remain many outstanding questions in relation to\noptimal patient management in hypertension. Several tri-\nals and observational studies have confirmed the impor-\ntance of blood pressure variability, rather than achieved\nmean blood pressure, as an important determinant of CV\noutcome, including stroke and myocardial infarction.17,18,19\nMoreover, it is clear that individual drugs have markedly\ndifferent effects on blood pressure variability and this may\nbe the underlying explanation for the benefits of the cal-\ncium channel blocker regimen compared with the beta-\nblocker regimen reported from ASCOT.3,20 No trials have\nbeen designed prospectively to compare outcomes based\non blood pressure variability and, thus, the evidence base\nrequired to influence future guidelines on blood pressure\nvariability is limited.\nNew guidelines should include a section on patient\nadherence, which is a major problem in hypertension, par-\nticularly in those with treatment-resistant hypertension,\nwhere as many as two thirds of patients are poorly adher-\nent to drug therapy.21\nWhilst recent trials have contributed to our better\nunderstanding of more optimal treatment strategies for\nhypertensive patients, the healthcare costs to the commu-\nnity associated with hypertension are largely influenced by\nunder-diagnosis and under-treatment. Unless a major\neffort is taken to address these problems, hypertension will\nremain a major contributor to poor health outcomes and a\nsubstantial burden on healthcare costs.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article:\nResearch grants and honoraria from Pfizer.\nReferences\n1.
