The present study investigates two factors that may influence the acquisition of medical Spanish vocabulary in such\npersons: native English vocabulary size and topic knowledge. Forty-four health care workers attended 12 hr of medical\nSpanish instruction. Prior to instruction, the Nelson\u00adDenny Vocabulary Test, a Medical Spanish vocabulary test, and an\nEnglish Medical Terminology Test (an indicator of topic knowledge) were administered. The Medical Spanish Vocabulary Test\nwas readministered at posttest. Individually, both English medical terminology knowledge and English vocabulary size were\nsignificant predictors of medical Spanish vocabulary acquisition, but English medical terminology knowledge explained most\nof the variance in medical Spanish vocabulary acquisition. The results are discussed in terms of the impact of expert memory\norganization on the ability to learn new labels in a second language. A curricular shift toward content-centered vocabulary in\nlanguage for specific purpose courses may be advantageous for some groups of foreign language learners.\n",

The need for foreign lan-\nguage instruction that is not general in nature is evidenced in\nprofessional areas such as engineering and medicine. A good\ngeneral knowledge of the target language does not necessar-\nily enable professionals to use the foreign language in spe-\ncific areas key to the specialty (Dlaska, 1997). Technical and\nsubtechnical vocabulary needed by professionals is rarely\nencountered in university foreign language classrooms\nother medical professionals in the United States have found\nthat general Spanish knowledge does not always equip them\nwith the vocabulary necessary for communicating with their\npatients (Burbano-O'Leary, Federico, & Hampers, 2003).\nSuch a need has motivated a growing number of medical\nschools and continuing education programs to offer Medical\nSpanish courses (Binder et al., 1988; Frasier, Davalos,\nUnfortunately, research describing the benefits of such pro-\ngrams is limited. However, Clapham (1996) has indicated\nthat university students learn a foreign language faster in the\narea of their expertise. As the area of foreign language learn-\ning for professional purposes is relatively new, approaches to\nmaximize acquisition of language for specific purposes\n(LSP) within these generally short courses have not yet been\nfully described.\n1University of Georgia, Athens, USA\n2Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nMarcia Foresee Drumhiller, School of Nursing, Emory University 1520\nEmail: hankdrum@aol.com\nInfluence of Native Language Vocabulary\nand Topic Knowledge on Foreign\nLanguage Vocabulary Learning in Health\nCare Providers\nMarcia Foresee Drumhiller1,2 and Paula J.

Language has been\ncharacterized as an amalgam of vocabulary and grammar\n(Lewis, 1997) that is combined with factors such as context,\nstrategic and background knowledge, and pragmatics\n(Douglas, 2000). Vocabulary has been shown to be a good\nobserved that if the proportion of unknown words in texts is\ntoo high, comprehension is disrupted. Probably more impor-\ntant to those who most often communicate orally, Nation\n(2001) posited that learners who listen need to know at least\n95% of the words in oral input to have reasonable success at\nguessing from context. In fact, the theorists Dubin and\nOlshtain (1986) have postulated that possessing a good\nstock of vocabulary is what enables many learners to use\ntheir knowledge of language effectively and in ways that fit\ntheir specific needs. Vocabulary's importance to the typical\nlanguage learner cannot be overlooked (Coady & Huckin,\n& Roberts, 2003). Thus, it makes sense that the ability to\ncommunicate in a second language depends upon vocabu-\nlary also.\nAs the learner increases his foreign language vocabulary\nknowledge, both the learner's native and second language\nvocabulary base may facilitate the learning of new words.\nThe facilitating effect on second language vocabulary acqui-\nsition has been attributed to shared storage in long-term\nmemory. The second language version is stored in the same\nconcept representation as the native vocabulary equivalent or\nconnected adjacent to that representation affording econo-\nmies of time and effort in language acquisition (Kroll & de\nGroot, 1997). Having a large vocabulary size appears to\nafford an advantage for adult foreign language learners, as\nthey do not need to expend much effort on organizing the\nconceptual component of new vocabulary in memory. A fur-\nther advantage of the established native vocabulary for lin-\nguistically related languages may be that it can expedite the\nentry of certain words which are similar in form and meaning\n(cognates) into the vocabulary base.\nRecently, researchers have been in nearly uniform agree-\nment that native language is the foundation upon which the\nsecond language is built, an idea popularized by Cummins's\n(1981) Linguistic Coding Differences Hypothesis. Cummins\nnoted that elementary school bilingual children learned\nEnglish only as well as they knew their native language.\nSince then, the relationship between the first and second lan-\nguages has been shown in diverse groups, including adults\n(Nation, 2001). Therefore, second language researchers have\ninvestigated a number of factors contributing to native lan-\nguage acquisition: word memory, phonological memory,\nbackground knowledge, and the recognition of grammar.\nThese have been found to hold true for second language\nNative language may facilitate second language vocabu-\nlary acquisition through a number of routes. One is through\nperception of word forms. Gathercole and Baddeley (1993)\nhave suggested that having a large vocabulary would\nenhance phonological skill by increasing the number of\napproximations to unfamiliar words in memory. Large\nnative vocabularies in languages such as English include\nloan or root words that are written or pronounced in a simi-\nlar enough manner as to aid acquisition of a second lan-\nguage vocabulary. Thus, language learners who have a\nlarge volume of word representations offered by ortho-\ngraphic and phonologic exemplars in the native language\nare able to use these to assist in their acquisition of a second\nlanguage vocabulary.\nAnother route through which native language vocabulary\nmay influence vocabulary acquisition is through the ability\nto identify those words possessing conceptual/vocabulary\nequivalents already in long-term memory and storing the\nnew versions in the same or adjacent to the native concept.\nIndeed, recent models of bilingual memory posit that words\nin both languages are located in a shared conceptual memory\n(Kroll & de Groot, 1997). In such a model, it is predicted that\nvocabulary development in a second language would be\nmore efficient for concepts already created in the native lan-\nguage. Thus, acquisition of a new second language word\nwould simply involve relabeling rather than constructing\nnew concepts. In sum, native vocabulary facilitates second\nlanguage acquisition by circumventing the need for concept\nformation.\nSome research demonstrates the facilitative effect of first\nlanguage vocabulary on second language acquisition in gen-\neral. Proctor, August, Carlo, and Snow (2006), in studying\nEnglish reading comprehension in 135 Spanish\u00adEnglish\nbilingual fourth-grade students, found faster English reading\nby those children who had more Spanish vocabulary knowl-\nedge. A study by Sparks et al. (1997) of intermediate high\nschool students studying in foreign language study showed\nthat native language vocabulary as assessed by the Peabody\nPicture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-R; Dunn & Dunn, 1981) was\na significant predictor, actually a better predictor, of overall\nproficiency than the Modern LanguageAptitude Test (Carroll\nonce nonword repetition ability (a measure of phonological\nmemory) was controlled for, acquisition of foreign language\nwords was associated with native language vocabulary size.\nIt is clear, then, that native language vocabulary itself con-\ntributes to foreign language acquisition, but its role in facili-\ntating the acquisition of foreign language vocabulary per se\nhas not been distinctly established. For example, native lan-\nguage vocabulary may not have as much of a facilitative\neffect when the two languages are linguistically distinct\n(Kahn-Horwitz, Shimron, & Sparks, 2005).\nDrumhiller and Schwanenflugel 3\nLSP\nSpecific-purpose language learners are distinct in their need\nfor low-frequency vocabulary and subtechnical (formal\nvocabulary as in academics) and their depth of content\nknowledge in a specific realm. It has been said that LSP rep-\nresent the interaction of language ability and background\nknowledge (Douglas, 2000). Second language learning tradi-\ntionally covers a broad curriculum, characterized by the use\nof high-frequency words applicable to general communica-\ntions. However, the focus on high-frequency vocabulary in\nthe second language is not adequate for optimal functioning\nin most professional endeavors. Professionally specific\nvocabulary is needed as well. Furthermore, while traditional\nforeign language instruction does not provide appropriate\nvocabulary for learners for specific purposes, it also ignores\nthe relative benefits of conceptual and topic knowledge\nwhich distinguishes the special purposes learner.\nThe potential advantage of capitalizing on the conceptual\nnature of professional vocabulary words and their related\ntopic knowledge in instruction has been supported by a num-\nber of studies. Ganschow, Sparks, Javorsky, Pohlman, and\nBishop-Marbury (1991) showed that adults who are poor\nforeign language learners access semantic representations of\ntarget words in their knowledge base to aid in foreign lan-\nguage acquisition. Furthermore, Lin (2003) has observed\nthat the understanding of technical words facilitates English\nacquisition in Chinese university. Thus, both specific vocab-\nulary knowledge and topic knowledge may be helpful and\nneeded to expeditiously acquire a second language for spe-\ncific purposes. While language ability in general has been\nhighly researched, its relationship to background knowledge\nand expertise has not.\nTopic Knowledge and Expertise\nVocabulary knowledge and topic knowledge are related\n(Bedard & Chi, 1992). For example, it is not unusual in a\nbeginning science course for teachers to instruct the vocabu-\nlary in an area to promote understanding of topic knowledge.\nA specific concept is delineated in identifying those critical\nfeatures that make each word unique. In addition to the con-\nvergence of specific semantic features, each word is situated\nin an organized vocabulary base in experts.\nThe conceptual linkages have been characterized as inter-\nacting knowledge structures stored in long-term memory,\ncalled schemata (Rumelhart & Ortony, 1977). These \"build-\ning blocks of cognition\" are the framework to which new\ninformation is linked (Rumelhart, 1980). They have been\nshown to guide comprehension and interpretation of events\nand their linguistic (oral and written) interpretation (Carrell,\n1983).Whereas a disorganized conceptual schema will\nimpede word retrieval (Crutcher, 1998), related schemas of\nassociated words in a knowledge base will facilitate retrieval\nby oral or written communication guide the listener as to\nhow he should construct the intended meaning from his or\nher own previously acquired knowledge (Carrell, 1983).\nTopic vocabulary can trigger conceptual knowledge, or sche-\nmata in experts, making it no surprise that researchers have\nchosen topic vocabulary knowledge as an indication of\nThe influence of topic knowledge on the learning of\ndomain-related vocabulary in the native language was stud-\nied directly by De Marie,Aloise-Young, Prideaux, Muransky-\nDoran, and Gerda (2004) in undergraduate education and\nbusiness majors. Students were asked to recall three lists of\n20 general, education, and business terms. They were then\ncategorized according to the number of courses students had\ncompleted in one of three majors. The greater number of\ncourses taken in the domain predicted vocabulary recall of\ndomain-related words. It makes sense that topic knowledge\nwould be related to the acquisition of new second language\nvocabulary as well.\nA Specific Case of LSP: Medical Spanish\nLearning and the Current Study\nThe acquisition of medical Spanish affords an opportunity\nto study facilitated foreign language acquisition as well as\nacquisition of LSP. It is known that first language vocabu-\nlary predicts second language vocabulary acquisition, but it\nis unclear how important first language vocabulary is to the\nlearning of a second language vocabulary in contrast to\nother contributing factors such as general topic knowledge\nand expertise. The role of topic knowledge and expertise in\nthe acquisition of a second language is unknown. Learners\nof foreign languages for professional purposes possess\nvocabulary-related advantages over other learners. First,\nmany students of science already know words similar to\ntarget language words in their native language and they\nmay have topic knowledge that will allow them to supply\nmeaning when vocabulary is unknown. Second, as edu-\ncated people, medical professionals are likely to have rea-\nsonably good native language vocabulary skills that they\ncan bring to the acquisition of a second language, which has\nshown to be influential by previous research. Therefore,\nthis article studies the acquisition of medical Spanish\nvocabulary in health care providers to address the follow-\ning questions:\n1. Is there a relationship between the vocabulary size of\nthe adult learner whose native language is English\nand his or her ability to acquire beginning medical\nSpanish vocabulary?\n2. Is there a relationship between the topic knowledge\nof an English-speaking health care professional and\nhis ability to acquire beginning medical Spanish\nvocabulary?\n4 SAGE Open\n3. Is topic knowledge or native language vocabulary\nmore important in the acquisition of medical Spanish\nby English speakers? Do the two interact to produce\nbetter medical Spanish vocabulary learning?\nIn this study, employees of medical and public health\nfacilities who wanted to acquire some basic facility in medi-\ncal Spanish took a short course in medical Spanish.\nParticipants were given a standardized test of English vocab-\nulary to assess the extent to which general English vocabu-\nlary size predicted their Spanish vocabulary acquisition\noutcome. They also were given a medical terminology test in\nEnglish to measure their background knowledge in medi-\ncine. Finally, they were given a pretest and posttest of medi-\ncal Spanish vocabulary to measure their medical Spanish\nvocabulary acquisition. In this way, we were able to contrast\nthe relative contributions of specific topic knowledge and\ngeneral English vocabulary on the acquisition of medical\nSpanish vocabulary.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe present study included 44 employees of two public\nhealth departments and one university hospital in Georgia.\nAll individuals were native speakers of English between 18\nand 64 years of age (90% female). According to a question-\nnaire completed at the beginning of the study, most had some\nprevious Spanish language classroom experience, but not all.\nSome, but not the majority, had previous experience with\nSpanish-speaking patients. The majority of the employees\nwere medical professionals as nurses and nutritionists but\nmany also held clerical and technical positions. Of the sam-\ntheir associate degree or some college, 27.3% received their\nbachelor's degree, and 31.8% had postbaccalaureate gradu-\nate or professional training. Forty-eight percent had no for-\nyears), and 33% had no formal foreign language experience\nParticipants were volunteers recruited through public\nhealth and hospital system Internet announcements. The\ncourses were free to all participants, and major incentives for\nattending the class included enhanced job performance, con-\ntinuing education credit, and personal enrichment.\nMaterials and Procedures\nParticipant testing and instruction occurred in rooms desig-\nnated by the institutions for instruction. Participants attended\nat least 8 class sessions out of 10 offered over a period of 5 to\n6 weeks with total instructional time totaling 12 hr. The\nEnglish vocabulary skill test and medical Spanish vocabu-\nlary pretest were administered before the 1st hour of\ninstruction, and the medical terminology test within the 1st\nhour of instruction. The instructor administered the medical\nSpanish vocabulary posttest on the final day of instruction.\nStudents had as much time as needed to complete the test,\nwhich took approximately 20 min.\nClasses were taught by the first author, an instructor of\nmedical Spanish for more than 10 years who had advanced\ntraining in a health allied discipline and who is a certified\nmedical interpreter. Classes generally began with the presen-\ntation of Spanish vocabulary by the instructor. Students were\ngiven two to three vocabulary lists of approximately 40\nwords total which they pronounced as a class. One list of 15\ninfinitives used in health care settings was first presented.\nLater, a list of nouns and adjectives/adverbs/prepositions\nused in health care was presented. The instructor subse-\nquently supplied the meaning if no student volunteered it.\nNext, students were asked to translate five to eight English\nsentences containing those words in written and then oral\nformat as a class. A grammar sheet covering the immediate\nfuture, present, or past perfect tense, requiring approximately\n20 min to complete, was given to students on 5 days of the\ncourse. In general, only first- and third-person plural com-\nmunications were presented. Classes emphasized medical\nSpanish listening and speaking skills, with vocabulary intro-\nduction involving the learners writing Spanish equivalents of\nEnglish words separately or in short phrases.\nAssessments. There were three main assessments of interest\nin the study: (a) the Nelson\u00adDenny Vocabulary Test, which\nserved as a measure of English vocabulary skill; (b) the Med-\nical Terminology Test, which served as a measure of medical\nbackground knowledge; and (c) the Medical Spanish Test, an\nexperimenter-constructed test. The vocabulary assessments\nwere as follows:\na.\nMedical Spanish Vocabulary Test. Medical Spanish\nvocabulary can vary depending upon the specificity of\nthe topic and its intended use. The professional status\nof medical Spanish interlocutors determines whether\nthe vocabulary required is highly technical or merely\nsubtechnical. Similarly, as speech tends to be less for-\nmal than text, the vocabulary requirements of conver-\nsation are less technical than those that may be read.\nMedical English corpus, made three divisions in med-\nical English vocabulary-- basic English, fundamental\nmedical English, and specialized medical English.\nUnfortunately, no such corpus exists for oral medical\nEnglish. Given the greater degree of informality in\nspoken language and the diminished need for techni-\ncal (highly specialized medical) words when patient\u00ad\nhealth provider conversations are the focus, the\nheaviest vocabulary requirement is for semitechnical\n(fundamental medical) words. Accordingly, because\nthe purpose of the course was for medical\nDrumhiller and Schwanenflugel 5\nprofessionals to be better able to communicate with\npatients, the Medical Spanish Vocabulary Test empha-\nsized subtechnical words. All Medical Spanish\nVocabulary Test words were taught explicitly by the\ninstructor (the first author) during the course.\nBecause medical, oral Spanish has not been well\nresearched, we relied on research on written technical com-\nmunication, professionals functioning in the health care\ndomain, and general oral Spanish in formulating the Medical\nSpanish Vocabulary Test. Nation (2001) identified technical\nvocabulary words as those not normally found in other\ndomains or found more frequently in a particular domain\nthan elsewhere that are particularly useful for communica-\ntion in the domain. This technical vocabulary, he suggests,\nshould be composed after consulting domain area experts.\nThus, first, to create a medical Spanish vocabulary list, we\ncomposed a list of 300 words found in four currently used\nmedical Spanish texts and translated these terms into English.\nWe then asked 20 nurses and medical students to rate their\nimportance to communication with patients on a scale of 1 to\n5 with 1 being the most important. Next, all words with a\nmean rating of 3 or higher were selected to form a pool of\npotential test words, yielding approximately 200 medically\nrelated words. Only words that were not in the top 2,000\nmost frequent words in Spanish according to Davies (2005)\nwere considered technical or subtechnical medical Spanish\nwords to be used in this list. This list would later be used as\na repository from which to select relatively technical and\ngeneral vocabulary words for the Medical Spanish Test and\nfor instruction. Forty-nine of these important, low-frequency\nmedical Spanish terms were included in the Medical Spanish\nVocabulary Test.\nThe number of items was kept low as to not overwhelm\ninitial students in testing. To communicate, however, it is\nimportant to have nontechnical as well technical words in\nmost frequent words of a language be acquired prior to\nstudying technical vocabulary in a foreign language.\nCommonly occurring words found in medical Spanish text-\nmost common words were also selected for the assessment.\nFifty randomly chosen items from this list of common words\nwere included in the Medical Spanish Vocabulary Test.\nExpertise in a foreign language may be demonstrated by\nthe ability to produce communications through expressive\nvocabulary. Accordingly, the Medical Spanish Test used in\nthis study (Appendix A) required the students to produce a\nSpanish translation of their English equivalent. The Medical\nSpanish Vocabulary Test was administered prior to and at the\nend of the course, and took approximately 25 min to\ncomplete.\nb.\nEnglish Vocabulary Skill Test. Because the learner\npopulation ranged from high school graduates to\nemployees with graduate degrees, the Nelson\u00adDenny\nEnglish Vocabulary Test, Form G (Brown, Fishco, &\nHanna, 1993b) was given as a measure of English\nvocabulary skill. This instrument is designed for sec-\nondary students and adults and is widely used in\ndiverse settings to measure native English vocabulary\nknowledge. Test scale reliability ranges from .88 to\n.95 according to the test manual (Brown, Fishco, &\nsible definitions presented in a multiple-choice for-\nmat with five possible responses. It was administered\nimmediately prior to the first class session.\nParticipants were given 25 min to complete the test,\nas directed by the test manual.\nc.\nMedical Terminology Test. To determine the extent of\nmedical topic knowledge in these public health\nemployees, a medical terminology test was adminis-\ntered prior to instruction in medical Spanish. The test\n(Appendix B) consisted of 50 items drawn from\nGlossary of Technical and Popular Medical Terms in\nEnglish (1995). The first and fifth entries from each\nof 26 lists were selected, omitting words with multi-\nple meanings or that were closely related. Students\nwere asked to supply English written definitions for\neach single English medical term. Students were also\nasked to use the word in a sentence and this sentence\nwas used in cases where the definition was not clear.\nCorrect responses by the students were recorded, and\nmedical background was determined by a continuum\nResults\nEach test was graded against a key and the raw score totals\non each instrument were calculated. Bivariate scatterplots\nwere examined for outliers. Furthermore, studentized residu-\nals, Df Betas, and Cook's D were calculated to identify outli-\ners. Those residuals greater than 3.3 were considered to be\noutliers. Only one outlier was omitted from the data. Another\nparticipant was missing the medical English test and was\nalso dropped from the analysis. Table 1 shows the descriptive\nstatistics for the variables in the study. Table 2 shows the\nPearson correlation matrix for all variables in the study.\nDescriptive statistics of the student scores on the tests reveal\nthe heterogeneity of the study population in all but medical\nbackground. No excessive skewedness or kurtosis was\nfound.\nHypothesis 1\nThe first hypothesis tested predicts that general English\nvocabulary skill should significantly influence medical\nSpanish acquisition. To test this hypothesis, we used a hier-\narchical regression analysis in which the Spanish pretest was\nentered in the first step to control for a priori Spanish\n6 SAGE Open\nknowledge and regressed on Spanish posttest scores. Then,\nwe entered English vocabulary scores on the Nelson\u00adDenny\nVocabulary Test in a second step in this analysis.\nTable 3 presents unstandardized coefficients, standard\nerrors of the coefficient, and R, R2, and F statistics for this\nmodel. As can be seen, English vocabulary skill accounted\nfor substantial variance in medical Spanish acquisition\nbeyond that accounted for by the pretest, as predicted by this\nof the English Vocabulary variable was significant before the\naddition of the variable representing English medical knowl-\nedge. However, when English medical knowledge was added\nto the model, it was a significant additional predictor to the\naffected between addition of English vocabulary and medi-\ncal English was significant. Thus, this analysis provides sup-\nport for the view that native language vocabulary skill does\ninfluence the acquisition of a foreign language vocabulary,\nbut not when other factors are considered.\nHypothesis 2\nThe effect of medical background knowledge on medical\nSpanish vocabulary acquisition was also investigated. That\nis, this hypothesis predicts background content knowledge\nshould facilitate the learning of content vocabulary in a sec-\nond language. It was predicted that English Medical knowl-\nedge would significantly predict Medical Spanish vocabulary\nacquisition. Those learners employed in a health care facility\nwithout an extensive background in the allied health disci-\nplines were predicted to score significantly worse on the\nposttest for Spanish than those who had extensive medical\ntraining. The scores on the medical English terminology\nexam were used to serve as an indication of the medical\nbackground of the employees.\nTable 4 presents unstandardized coefficients, standard\nerrors of the coefficient, and R, R2, and F statistics for this\nmodel.As can be seen, English medical knowledge accounted\nfor substantial variance in medical Spanish acquisition,\nbeyond that accounted for by the pretest as predicted by this\nEnglish to the model produced a highly significant change in\nR2, the change affected in R2 was not significant with the\nsubsequent addition of the English vocabulary variable.\nThus, there is substantial support for the view that content\nknowledge influences the acquisition of a foreign language\nvocabulary, even when other factors such as native language\nvocabulary skills are considered.\nHypothesis 3\nThe third hypothesis investigates the nature of the relation-\nship between medical terminology knowledge and English\nvocabulary size on two predictor variables on the acquisition\nof medical Spanish vocabulary. It was predicted that both\nEnglish vocabulary and medical terminology would be sig-\nnificant predictors of medical Spanish vocabulary acquisition\nTable 1.

Determination of how\nthe two predictor variables influence medical Spanish acqui-\nsition, and how they would interact, if at all, was first investi-\ngated through multiple regression procedures. Interaction\nbetween the two major predictor variables of Spanish acquisi-\ntion was investigated by introducing interaction as a predictor\nbeyond the main effects of the variables entered individually.\nTable 5 presents unstandardized coefficients, standard errors\nof the coefficient, and R, R2, and F statistics for this model.\nWhen medical terminology knowledge was entered after the\nSpanish pretest variable into the model, the R2 change was\nhighly significant. The addition of the English vocabulary\nvariable to the model did not produce a significant change in\nR2, nor did the subsequent addition of the interaction variable\nto the model. As can be seen, when this interaction term is\nadded, it does not account for additional variance beyond that\naccounted for by the other variables. Thus, we have little evi-\ndence that the interaction between the two variables account\nfor the learning of medical Spanish beyond that accounted for\nby the contribution of the variables by themselves. In sum,\nfrom the analyses above, it seems that there is best support for\nHypothesis 2, the view that medical background knowledge\nis the best predictor of vocabulary learning in the acquisition\nof medical Spanish.\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of the present study was to examine the influ-\nence of two factors believed to influence foreign language\nacquisition--native language vocabulary base and subject\nbackground knowledge. Specifically, we were interested in\nthe influence of native English vocabulary size (as measured\nby a standardized test of vocabulary skill) and medical back-\nground knowledge (measured as knowledge of medical ter-\nminology) on medical Spanish vocabulary acquisition.\nBoth measures, medical knowledge and English vocab-\nulary size, were significant predictors of medical Spanish\nvocabulary acquisition, by themselves. Although both\nTable 3.

No patterns\nwere found to suggest that a higher level of education\nalone was a predictor of medical Spanish vocabulary\nacquisition. Of course, English vocabulary size could be\nrelated to higher educational levels in some populations,\nbut the majority of the learners in this study had postsec-\nondary education. The finding that medical vocabulary\nknowledge is the primary predictor of medical Spanish\nvocabulary acquisition expands our knowledge of factors\nto be considered regarding individual differences in the\nacquisition of a second language.\nAn explanation of why general vocabulary size and to a\ngreater degree topic knowledge influence second language\nvocabulary learning may lie in their processing for storage in\nmemory. Levelt's (1989) speech processing model postulates\nthat lexical representations in short-term memory are stored as\nunits of meaning and phonological units. Furthermore,\nColtheart, Curtis, Atkins, and Haller (1993) posited that pho-\nnological lexical representations in short-term memory are\nconverted to semantic representations in long-term memory.\nThis conceptualization is reflected in recent native language\nacquisition models that suggest that phonology ceases to\nbecome the major avenue for vocabulary acquisition after the\nestablishment of a vocabulary base in long-term memory. Our\nstudy supports the view that medical professionals may utilize\nan elaborated semantic representational base in their native\nlanguage (in terms of vocabulary size and medical knowledge)\nto accelerate second language vocabulary learning.\nAnother possible contributor to the demonstration that\nmedical professionals rely on prior vocabulary and medical\nknowledge is the method we used to evaluate second lan-\nguage vocabulary growth in this study. Many studies evalu-\nating the growth of vocabulary knowledge have used\nevaluations of receptive, rather than productive, vocabulary\nReceptive vocabulary has been characterized by its feed for-\nward relationship with phonology in short-term memory\nwhereas productive vocabulary has been associated with\nprior lexical experience or long-term semantic stores\n(Coltheart et al., 1993). We measured Spanish acquisition\nthrough productive vocabulary which may have called on\nour learner's deep, elaborated conceptual organization and\nestablished vocabulary base.\nThis reliance by our participants on previously learned\nvocabulary and medical knowledge supports the view (De\nBot, 1992) that bilingual conceptual memory is generally\nshared by the bilingual's two languages. The model predicts\nthat second language vocabulary acquisition proceeds more\nefficiently for concepts already created in the native language\nbecause conceptual knowledge is not stored separately in the\ntwo languages. It is posited that because conceptual knowl-\nedge is easily retrievable in either language, the reduced load\non working memory results in automaticity (fluency). Our\nresults mirrored this model, finding that those learners with\ngreater background knowledge in medical terminology relied\non it more than on general vocabulary skills to learn Spanish.\nTable 5.

Sparks et al. (1997), for example,\nfound that native language vocabulary was a significant pre-\ndictor of overall foreign language proficiency (Spanish,\nFrench, and German) in high school students after 2 years of\nstudy, although after 1 year of study, decoding ability (a mea-\nsure of phonological and orthographic knowledge) was a bet-\nter predictor. Similarly, Masoura and Gathercole (1999)\nfound that phonological memory skills in Greek children\nlearning English were highly correlated to vocabulary\nknowledge in both languages, but that English vocabulary\nlearning was related to Greek vocabulary in ways not\naccounted for by phonological memory alone. The present\nstudy, while agreeing with the importance of native language\nvocabulary on the acquisition of a second language, suggests\nthat in some beginners, other factors such as topic knowl-\nedge might come into play and might be utilized in some\ninstructional settings.\nThe influence of topic knowledge on foreign language\nvocabulary acquisition has been studied in multiple con-\ntexts. As early as 1937, Chapman and Gilbert noted that\nEnglish speakers could more easily learn Hindustani nouns\nif they could define them in English. Similar results were\nfound by Paribakht (2005) in Farsi-speaking college stu-\ndents when students were exposed in text to English equiva-\nlents of words known to them in their native language. The\npresent study measured topic knowledge through medical\nterminology knowledge and did find a highly significant\nrelationship between medical terminology knowledge and\nmedically related foreign language (Spanish) vocabulary\nacquisition. All of these studies add credence to the model\nproposed by Kroll and de Groot (1997) that conceptually\nsimilar words sharing the same conceptual store are more\neasily acquired.\nDepth of topic knowledge and its relationship to vocabu-\nlary acquisition has been investigated in the native language\nand in general foreign language learning. De Marie et al.\n(2004) found that native language vocabulary (English)\nlearning could be predicted in university undergraduates by\nimportance of vocabulary to their major area of study. De\nMarie et al. noted that there was a threshold for predicting\nvocabulary acquisition and that a sufficient amount of\ncoursework needed to be completed to have an effect.\nClapham (1996) found that specific topic vocabulary knowl-\nedge affected the second language text comprehension\nscores. Results of the present study agree with these studies\nin that specific topic knowledge is a highly significant pre-\ndictor of Spanish acquisition.\nThis study indicates that language learners rely upon\ntheir background knowledge when they have expertise. Our\nfindings suggest that current models of bilingual memory\nmodel must include information regarding the organization\nof native language concepts in long-term memory.Although\nmost of the health care employees were not advanced\nforeign language learners, many of them were, on the\nwhole, already acquainted with the concepts that the words\nrepresented. To date, most foreign language acquisition\nresearch has been devoted to the study of adolescents or\ncollege students, novices with little expertise in any area.\nWhile the students may have substantial experience with\nforeign language learning at the adolescent level, they are\nnot experts in content knowledge. The present study indi-\ncates that increased foreign language vocabulary retrieval\nis in part dependent on the strength of conceptual structures\nin adults. Thus, prior research, by focusing on language\nlearning in adolescents and young adults generally without\nextensive levels of expertise in subject matter area, has\nlargely missed the key importance of content knowledge in\nthe acquisition of LSP.\nIn sum, this study suggests that certain learner popula-\ntions may profit from topic knowledge in learning foreign\nlanguage vocabulary related to their areas of expertise.\nExtent of background knowledge in certain areas of exper-\ntise may predispose individuals to rely more on conceptual\nknowledge than, say, symbol/sound representations\nemphasizing phonology. Medical vocabulary requirements\nare likely greater than those of nontechnical disciplines.\nFor example, Ulijn and Strother (1995) observed that con-\ntent words were more important to the comprehension of\nscientific texts than that of general academic texts. Thus,\nlearners with greater facility in medical terminology than\nthe adult population in general, such as those in the present\nstudy, may profit more from their understanding of medi-\ncal concepts over other factors such as native language\nvocabulary and phonology in acquiring Medical Spanish\nvocabulary.\nThe role of topic knowledge in the acquisition of medical\nSpanish vocabulary is supported by findings from studies of\nexpert knowledge. Experts have been shown to have highly\norganized concepts in long-term memory. These highly orga-\nnized conceptual structures may serve to free learners'work-\ning memory so that they can attend to and learn new labels in\nanother language. Researchers have posited that expert con-\ntent knowledge is characterized by an organization that pro-\nmotes deep understanding and is thus more easily retrievable\n(Bransford, Brown, & Cocking, 2003). As Schneider and\nShiffrin (1985) observed, novices must expend greater atten-\ntional effort and are substantially handicapped in learning\nnew terms, and so may show a disadvantage here when both\nconcept and foreign language label must be learned simulta-\nneously. Therefore, the savings in attentional effort when the\nconcept is well understood may be conserved for enhanced\nforeign language learning.\nImplications for Pedagogy\nOur findings have implications for foreign language educa-\ntors and to training professionals. Our findings suggest that a\ncurricular shift toward content-centered vocabulary may be\nwarranted for adult early foreign language classes. Instructors\nof LSP courses and ESL (English as a Second Language)\nprograms may find that less emphasis on general vocabulary\nand more on the topic vocabulary needed in key communica-\ntion scenarios encountered by professionals can secure more\nrapid acquisition of core vocabulary and, hopefully, subse-\nquent fluency. Businesses contemplating training employees\nwho will communicate with foreign language speakers may\nwish to include professional terminology knowledge as a key\ncriterion for selection of LSP training personnel and identify\nwith some clarity the vocabulary to be taught in the training\nprograms.\nLimitations and Generalizability of Findings\nThe present study evaluated a population of foreign language\nlearners that has not yet been well studied. Unfortunately,\nour sample size, although acceptable, was not as large as we\nwould have ideally liked. Increased sample size might have\nincreased our ability to detect an independent effect of native\nlanguage vocabulary, above and beyond the overwhelming\ninfluence of topic knowledge on medical Spanish vocabulary\nacquisition. The fact that the majority of learners were female\nmay limit the transferability of the findings in male health\ncare providers. On the positive side, though, our sample con-\ntained three separate groups of health care employees. Two\npublic health departments and employees of a large private\nuniversity hospital were represented. The learners' occupa-\ntions ranged from clerks to technicians, nutritionists, epide-\nmiologists, and nurse practitioners with varying levels of\nmedical background and patient contact. The fact that the\nstudy included both hospital employees and public health\nemployees allows us to generalize the study's findings to\nhealth care employees in general.\nA second possible limitation is that we used an\nexperimenter-created medical terminology test as an indi-\ncator of prior knowledge. However, terminology knowl-\nedge is only one aspect of expertise. Unfortunately, full\nassessment of our participants' expertise was not practical.\nFurthermore, the psychometric properties of this test were\nnot as well established as in the Nelson\u00adDenny Vocabulary\nassessment. On the positive side, there was a strong cor-\nrelation between the Medical Spanish posttest scores and\nthe medical terminology test. This would indicate that, to a\ngreat extent, the medical terminology test was a valid indi-\ncator of medical vocabulary knowledge. Furthermore, the\nreliability of the English Medical Terminology Test was\nexcellent.\nDifferences in the format of the three tests may have\nimpacted the study results. While the Spanish and Medical\ntests were both of short-answer format, the English vocab-\nulary test was multiple choice. The form of the response, to\na certain extent, determines the nature of the knowledge\nbeing assessed. The Spanish and medical tests measured\nproductive knowledge. The Nelson\u00adDenny Vocabulary test\ncould be considered less a measure of receptive knowl-\nedge. It may be that productive vocabulary bears a greater\nrelationship in learning vocabulary in a second language\nthan receptive vocabulary does. Therefore, future research\nshould determine whether our finding that topic knowl-\nedge is more important than native vocabulary size gener-\nalizes to native language productive vocabulary size as\nwell.\nThe Spanish pre- and posttest results cannot be consid-\nered as indicators of Spanish vocabulary acquisition, but\nonly as vocabulary learning. The attention required of the\nstudents to increase Spanish vocabulary scores was accom-\nplished in a structured, rather than in an informal setting in\nthe present study. Thus, the increases may not adequately\nreflect incidental vocabulary gains in a more authentic lan-\nguage setting.\nFinally, the pre- and posttest used was a paper\u00adpencil test\nand not the potentially more valid situation of using oral\nvocabulary to communicate with others. For example, a test\nevaluating the use of vocabulary in a medical setting would\nlikely be a more valid indicator of vocabulary learning than\nthe test used here. Therefore, the Spanish vocabulary test\nshould be considered as exploratory. The intricacies of for-\nmal and informal oral interactions in health care settings\nhave not been addressed in this study. The reliability and\nvalidity of the test in those settings cannot be claimed. It is\npossible that vocabulary deployed in a more realistic medical\nsetting situation might be shown to be more differentially\naffected by general vocabulary skill than that was displayed\nin this study.\nDirections for Future Research\nThe finding of the role of topic knowledge on the acquisi-\ntion of foreign language vocabulary acquisition suggests\nthat future research should be directed toward other expert\npopulations outside of the university community to more\nclosely ascertain how various types of expertise are\nexploited to facilitate the acquisition of new second lan-\nguage vocabulary during the working years. Second, this\nstudy had a relatively short duration between the acquisi-\ntion of the vocabulary through coursework and testing.\nFuture studies could examine the influence of topic knowl-\nedge versus general first language vocabulary skill acquired\nover a longer period of time. It may be that, at longer peri-\nods of time, general vocabulary skills come into play. Last,\nas long-term retention of a foreign language is important,\nfuture studies should include a long-term Spanish posttest\nto measure the amount and nature of the vocabulary\nretained.\nIn sum, we find that foreign language vocabulary acqui-\nsition is driven by the information that precedes it.\nAccordingly, all language learners are not alike; they chose\nDrumhiller and Schwanenflugel 11\nthe path that is to their best advantage. Foreign language\nlearning is the product of memory systems that preferen-\ntially select new information most compatible with that\nalready stored.\nAppendix A\nSpanish Test\nPlease supply a one or two word Spanish translation.\n1.hour_________________________________\n2. son__________________________________\n3. head _________________________________\n4. heart ________________________________\n5. hand ________________________________\n6. foot _________________________________\n7. eye _________________________________\n8. mouth _______________________________\n9. little (amount) ________________________\n10. small ________________________________\n11. large ________________________________\n12. pain ________________________________\n13. day _________________________________\n14.
