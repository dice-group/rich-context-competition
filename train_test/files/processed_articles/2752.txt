J Am Geriatr\nKey words: aged; dementia; longitudinal studies;\nolfaction disorders; smell\nOlder adults with dementia have been found in cross-\nsectional studies to have a greater prevalence of\nolfactory dysfunction than those without dementia,1 but in\nthe few longitudinal studies that have assessed whether\nolfactory dysfunction precedes the development of Alzhei-\nmer's disease (AD), the most-common type of dementia,2\u00ad7\nnot all found a significant predictive relationship. More-\nover, subjects in these longitudinal studies were from\nat-risk groups, relatively small samples, or homogenous\npopulations. In some studies, it was also possible that the\napparent predictive power of olfaction was an artifact of\nits association with cognitive abilities at baseline and did\nnot have predictive power in addition to the predictive\neffects of baseline cognition itself. Thus, it is uncertain\nwhether olfactory dysfunction is a predictive marker of\nsubsequent dementia in the diverse general population of\nolder U.S. adults. We investigated the relationship between\nolfactory dysfunction and a diagnosis of dementia within\n5 years in the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Pro-\nject (NSHAP), a nationally representative probability sam-\nple of home-dwelling Americans aged 57 to 85.\nMETHODS\nStudy Population\nWe studied 2,906 NSHAP respondents who were inter-\nFrom the *Section of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University\nof Chicago; Department of Psychology, Northeastern Illinois University;\nDepartment of Public Health Sciences; \u00a7Department of Comparative\nHuman Development; \u00b6Institute for Mind and Biology; and **Section of\nGeriatrics and Palliative Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of\nChicago, Chicago, Illinois.\nSee related Editorial by Thielke.\nAddress correspondence to Jayant M.

Both\ninterviews included assessments of demographic, social,\npsychological, and biological measures, including olfactory\nability. To select its sample, NSHAP followed a standard\nmultistage area probability sample design, covering all geo-\ngraphic areas of the United States. This sample is represen-\ntative of the U.S. home-dwelling population aged 57 to 85\nand data collection are published elsewhere.9 By design,\nthe population was cognitively intact at baseline (mean\nShort Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ)\nscore 9.2 \u00c6 1.0 out of 10). Additional baseline characteris-\ntics of the population are presented in Table 1. The insti-\ntutional review boards at NORC and the University of\nChicago approved this study.\nOlfactory Assessment at Baseline\nObjective odor identification ability was evaluated at base-\nline using a validated five-item test.10,11 Odors were pre-\nsented using odor pens (Sniffin' Sticks, Burghart\nMesstechnik, Wedel, Germany), and respondents were\nasked to identify each odor by choosing from a set of four\npicture or word prompts. Refusals were coded as incorrect.\nUsing previously validated cutpoints10,11, respondents who\nidentified four or five odors correctly were classified as\nnormosmic, whereas those who identified three or fewer\nodors correctly were classified as having some form of\nolfactory dysfunction. Using these criteria, 22.0% of older\nU.S. adults had objective olfactory dysfunction, a percent-\nage that aligns with other estimates of olfactory dysfunc-\nInterval Dementia Diagnosis at 5-Year Follow-Up\nAt 5-year follow-up, we determined physician diagnosis of\ndementia during home interviews with the respondent, or\na proxy if the respondent was too sick to interview or had\ndied. Prior studies have found that proxy reports of date\nand cause of death match or exceed the accuracy of infor-\nmation from death certificates and that proxy reports of\ndementia are reasonably accurate when compared with\nProxy interviews were unattainable for 296 respon-\ndents (10.2%). We classified these respondents conserva-\ntively as normal. We found similar effect sizes and\nsignificance levels when we classified all of them as having\ndementia or excluded them altogether.\nPotential Confounding Variables\nOur analyses accounted for numerous potential con-\nfounders, including age, sex, race and ethnicity, education,\ncomorbidity, and baseline cognition (Supplementary\nTable S1). Age and sex have long been known to be asso-\nciated with olfactory function.12 Race, an established\nolfactory risk factor,17 was measured according to\nself-report using standard National Institutes of Health\nquestions. Respondents were classified as white, black, or\nHispanic. (Those who reported their race as black or Afri-\ncan American and answered \"yes\" to Hispanic ethnicity\nwere classified as black.) Small sample sizes necessitated\ncombining those reporting their race as American Indian\nor Alaskan Native, Asian, or other into a single \"other\"\ncategory. Education was measured according to highest\ndegree or certification earned. Comorbid diseases were\nmeasured using the Charlson Comorbidity Index modified\nfor the NSHAP survey.\nIt is likely that baseline cognitive function of respon-\ndents may influence subsequent development of dementia.\nWe previously reported in a cross-sectional analysis that\nolfaction is associated with cognition within the normal\ncognitive range.18 Therefore, cognitive function at baseline\nwas included as a covariate to test the hypothesis that\nolfactory dysfunction would predict development of\ndementia after accounting for baseline cognition itself.\nCognitive function at baseline was measured using a modi-\nfied version of the Short Portable Mental Status Question-\nStatistical Analysis\nNSHAP used a national probability sample of home-dwell-\nTable 1.

In addition, NSHAP oversampled blacks, His-\npanics, men, and older individuals to obtain roughly equal\nnumbers of sampled individuals in each of six sex-by-age\ncategories.8 Respondent-level weights were calculated to\nadjust for differential nonresponse to survey participation\nand the planned oversampling based on race and ethnicity,\nsex, and age. This permits estimation of parameters for the\nU.S. population of older home-dwelling adults.10,11 All\nvalues presented use these respondent-level weights.\nDesign-based standard errors were calculated using the lin-\nearization method together with the strata and Primary\nSampling unit indicators provided with the dataset. Sensi-\ntivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and nega-\ntive predictive value were calculated using standard\nformulas. All statistical analyses were conducted using\nStata version 14.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX).\nWe tested the association between baseline olfactory\ndysfunction and an interval dementia diagnosis using mul-\ntivariate logistic regression, controlling for age, sex, race\nand ethnicity, education, comorbidities, and baseline cog-\nnitive function. We tested the incremental risk attributed\nto each additional odor identification error using a 1\u00adde-\ngree of freedom linear trend test. Results are presented as\nodds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Sta-\ntistical significance was set at P < .05.\nRESULTS\nAt 5-year follow-up, 4.1% of older adults reported a new\nphysician diagnosis of dementia (Supplementary Table S2).\nThe sensitivity of olfactory dysfunction was 47%; nearly\nhalf of older adults reporting a new physician diagnosis of\ndementia had had olfactory dysfunction on testing 5 years\nbefore. Specificity was 79%; more than three-quarters of\nolder adults without a new dementia diagnosis had had\nnormal olfactory testing 5 years before. The PPV of olfac-\ntory dysfunction in predicting a dementia diagnosis 5 years\nlater was 9%, and the negative predictive value was 97%.\nThus, older adults with olfactory dysfunction had\nmore than twice the odds of developing dementia 5 years\nage, sex, race and ethnicity, education, comorbidities, and\nbaseline cognitive function (Table 2).\nAs expected, better cognitive function at baseline was\nassociated with lower likelihood of interval dementia diag-\ndementia was more likely to develop in older adults\nvalidity of our diagnostic measure. Nonetheless, olfactory\ndysfunction had a predictive value in addition to that of\nbaseline cognition, equivalent to aging 13 years; each addi-\ntional odor identification error increased the odds of\ndementia independent of all of the covariates (P = .04,\nFigure 1).\nAs a stronger test of the predictive effects of olfaction\nindependent of baseline cognition, we restricted our analy-\nsis to older adults who, at baseline, tested within the nor-\nmal cognitive range. In case those with impaired cognition\nat baseline drove the initial findings, we excluded\nrespondents whose baseline SPMSQ scores were below the\ntraditional cutoff for likely dementia (<8). The sensitivity\nof olfactory dysfunction was similar; 43% of older adults\nreporting a new dementia diagnosis had had olfactory dys-\nfunction on testing 5 years before. Furthermore, for older\nadults who tested within the normal cognitive range, poor\nolfaction continued to strongly predict an interval demen-\nDISCUSSION\nWe show for the first time that home-dwelling older U.S.\nadults with more difficulty identifying odors have greater\nodds of receiving a new physician diagnosis of dementia\n5 years later (based on respondent or proxy reports). The\nstrengths of this study include a design that represents the\ngeneral U.S. population, demographic diversity, the largest\nsample size to date, and control of important covariates.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate the predictive power of olfac-\ntion in addition to cognition by including baseline\nTable 2.

An additional\nstrength that gives this study its broad implications is that\nolfaction is predictive of dementia even in cognitively\nintact older adults, extending prior work with high-risk\npopulations and smaller, more-homogenous samples.1\u00ad7\nWhy would olfactory dysfunction precede the develop-\nment of dementia? One potential explanation is that the\nneuropathology underlying dementia, such as AD (amy-\nloid-b plaques and paired helical filament tau tangles),\nmay begin earlier in the olfactory system than the cor-\ntex.19\u00ad21 If so, this type of neuropathology in the olfactory\nsystem would impair its function before the detrimental\neffects in other parts of the central nervous system, includ-\ning cognition. A postmortem study of brains obtained at\nautopsy of older adults who had completed olfactory test-\ning before death (mean \u00c6 standard deviation of\n2.2 \u00c6 1.2 years before death) found that neuropathologi-\ncal findings associated with AD accounted for 12% of the\nvariation in odor identification ability.22 The association\nbetween olfactory dysfunction and dementia could also\narise from other shared pathological mechanisms to which\nthe olfactory system is more vulnerable, such as decreased\nage-related regenerative capacity, reduced physiological\nrepair, or worsening immunopathology. Additional studies\nwill be needed to test and fine-tune these hypotheses.\nOn a practical basis for clinicians, a validated five-\nitem odor identification test10,11 can potentially serve as an\nefficient, low-cost component of the physical examination\nthat provides useful information in assessing older adults\nat risk of dementia. This tool is a noninvasive biomarker\nthat provides additional information to other relevant clin-\nical information, established risk factors, and neuropsycho-\nlogical testing to aid in an earlier diagnosis of dementia.\nThe ability to identify individuals at risk of dementia\nbefore overt cognitive impairment would allow for earlier\nintervention, with the potential to improve outcomes, and\nwould offer individuals and their families more time to\nplan ahead.\nIn addition to olfactory testing, several biomarkers for\ndementia have been proposed, including cerebrospinal fluid\nbiomarkers (e.g., amyloid-b and tau concentrations), struc-\ntural brain imaging (hippocampal volume23), and inflam-\nmatory molecules.24 We found that our five-item odor\nidentification test had a sensitivity of 47% and a specificity\n79% 5 years in advance of any evidence of cognitive\nimpairment. These characteristics compare reasonably with\nother proposed dementia biomarkers when cognitive\ndecline is already in process; for example, a recent\nCochrane Review found that, in individuals with mild cog-\nnitive impairment, amyloid-b in cerebrospinal fluid has a\nsensitivity of 81% at the median specificity of 64% for\npredicting conversion to AD.25 Mild cognitive impairment\nis considered to be a precursor to AD, but despite efforts\nto identify biomarkers for dementia, none of the candidate\nbiomarkers have achieved the appropriate screening char-\nacteristics to recommend their use in the general popula-\ntion.26 The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gives\nscreening for cognitive impairment in older adults an \"I\"\ngrade, concluding that the current evidence is insufficient\nto assess the balance of benefits and harms. More-detailed\nstudy of the additional value of olfactory testing in this\nclinical context is warranted.\nWe found that the PPV of olfactory dysfunction in\npredicting a dementia diagnosis within 5 years was 9% in\nhome-dwelling older Americans, meaning that 91% of\nolder adults who failed our olfactory test did not develop\ndementia within the 5-year follow-up period. The PPV of\na test depends on the prevalence of disease in the popula-\ntion studied, indicating that the PPV of olfactory dysfunc-\ntion will be greater in at-risk populations. Furthermore, it\nis likely that the PPV will improve as the follow-up period\nincreases, given that risk of dementia increases with age.\nFurther research is needed to determine the test char-\nacteristics of olfactory dysfunction in different populations\nand over different follow-up periods. Regardless of test\ncharacteristics, primary care physicians will need to\nthoughtfully evaluate when olfactory testing is appropriate\nfor their individual patients, taking into consideration the\nbenefits of early dementia risk stratification given the lack\nof available therapies and the emotional and financial\nharms that can result from misdiagnosis.\nBeyond aiding in earlier diagnosis of dementia by\nalerting physicians to consider other factors that may\naffect disease development, olfactory testing may help dis-\ntinguish clinically between different dementia subtypes.\nCross-sectional studies have shown associations between\nolfactory dysfunction and vascular dementia and fron-\ntotemporal dementia.27,28 Prior studies suggest that differ-\nent types of olfactory disability (e.g., odor identification,\nodor discrimination, odor threshold) may be associated\nwith different forms of dementia.28 Finally, olfactory test-\ning may be useful in predicting progression of disease and\nresponse to treatment.29 This remains to be tested in future\nwork.\nOur study has several limitations. As our primary out-\ncome, we rely on interview reports of physician-diagnosed\ndementia, and we are therefore most likely underestimat-\ning the incidence of new dementia cases, although proxy\nreports of dementia are reasonably accurate when com-\npared with psychometric testing.14\u00ad16 It is likely that psy-\nchometric testing would reveal a greater incidence of\ndementia were it not infeasible in a time-limited, many-\nitem, and omnibus nationally representative survey.23 In\naddition, although we controlled for many known con-\nfounders, as in any cohort analysis, there may be addi-\ntional confounders associated with olfactory function and\ndementia that are unaccounted for in our analyses, such as\nsmoking and depression.\nIn summary, older adults with olfactory dysfunction\nwere twice as likely to develop dementia 5 years later as\nthose with normal olfaction. Use of simple olfactory test-\ning in the primary care setting may provide an opportunity\nfor targeted early interventions to reduce the attendant\nmorbidity and public health burden of dementia.\n"
