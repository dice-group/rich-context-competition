    "abstract": "Abstract\nInteractions between the albedo and the gloss on a surface are commonplace. Darker surfaces are\nperceived glossier (contrast gloss) than lighter surfaces and darker backgrounds can enhance\nperceived lightness of surfaces. We used maximum likelihood conjoint measurements to\nsimultaneously quantify the strength of those effects. We quantified the extent to which albedo\ncan influence perceived gloss and physical gloss can influence perceived lightness. We modeled the\ncontribution of lightness and gloss and found that increasing lightness reduced perceived gloss by\nabout 32% whereas gloss had a much weaker influence on perceived lightness of about 12%.\nMoreover, we also investigated how different backgrounds contribute to the perception of\nlightness and gloss of a surface placed in front. We found that a glossy background reduces\nslightly perceived lightness of the center and simultaneously enhances its perceived gloss.\nLighter backgrounds reduce perceived gloss and perceived lightness. Conjoint measurements\nlead us to a better understanding of the contextual effects in gloss and lightness perception.\nNot only do we confirm the importance of contrast in gloss perception and the reduction of\nthe simultaneous contrast with glossy backgrounds, but we also quantify precisely the strength of\nthose effects.\n",

However, experiments on\nsimultaneous interactions of more than one dimension are scarce. Conjoint measurement\nallows us to study the joint influences of two or more dimensions on a single perceptual\ndecision process to be described as a Gaussian signal detection model and estimated the\nunderlying perceptual scale values using maximum likelihood. This technique has recently\nbeen successfully applied to study the contribution of luminance contrast, contour frequency\nand amplitude on the watercolor effect (Gerardin et al., 2014), to study the joint influences of\nlightness and chroma in color perception (Rogers et al., 2016) and to study the contribution\nof mesoscale and microscale roughness on the perception of gloss (Qi et al., 2015).\nIn the initial work by Ho et al. (2008), the authors investigated the simultaneous influence\nof surface texture and physical gloss on perceived texture and perceived gloss. They used a\nconjoint measurement model that captured precisely the interaction of texture and gloss and\nthey obtained the relative magnitude of the contamination on a single perceptual judgment.\nThe aim of the present study is to investigate the simultaneous influence that physical\ngloss and albedo have on perceived gloss and perceived lightness. For this purpose, we\nused the conjoint measurement as described in Ho et al. (2008) and Knoblauch and\nIt is well known that lightness and gloss interact with each other. Darker surfaces also\nappear glossier in comparison with lighter surfaces although the specularly reflected light is\nthe same (Ferwerda et al., 2001; Hunter & Harold, 1987). Glossy objects appear darker since\nthey have steeper shading gradients, creating dark specular lowlights (Kim et al., 2012) and\npositively skewed images tend to be glossier and darker (Motoyoshi et al., 2007) at the same\ntime. However, this view was later challenged by Anderson and Kim (2009) and Kim and\nAnderson (2010). They showed various glossy images that had negatively skewed histograms\nand emphasized that all geometric information is lost in the luminance histogram. The\ninfluence of the albedo of the background into perceived lightness has already been\ndescribed extensively in the context of the simultaneous contrast (first described by\nbackground increases perceived lightness of the center. This effect seems to be reduced if\nthe background is glossy or at least contains the same contrast and luminance distribution\n(Schmid & Anderson, 2014), thus somehow improving lightness constancy.\nIn the presented study we had two goals. First, we wished to quantify the exact strength of\nthese interactions between gloss and lightness on single surfaces that varied in albedo and\nphysical gloss. In a second experiment, we extended this to also investigate the contextual\neffects of albedo and physical gloss on perceived lightness and perceived gloss. In this second\nexperiment, we use a simultaneous contrast display with a constant central patch and a\nbackground that varies in albedo and gloss.\nMaterial and Methods\nStimuli\nIn a first experiment that we label baseline condition, we presented the observer with single\nsurfaces varying in albedo and gloss. In the second experiment which is the main focus of the\npresent research, each stimulus consisted of a squared centered surface with a background\nsurface that is taken from the first experiment. This latter stimulus is similar to the classical\nsimultaneous contrast display.\nEach surface was a fronto-parallel plane that was slightly deformed along the surface\nnormal. We created three different Perlin noise images (Figure 1) in Matlab R2014b (The\nMathWorks Inc., Massachusetts, US) and used those procedural textures to generate three\ndifferent random bumpy surfaces. The luminance value of each pixel in the texture image\ndefined the height on the surface and deformed it accordingly. The surface was then\nsmoothed using the built-in Smooth operator (Factor: 0.5, 50 repeats) and rendered using\nthe Cycles Render Engine in Blender 2.74. We illuminated the surfaces using the Uffizi\nenvironment map (Debevec, 1998). Each surface was rendered with a mixed shader with\n90% diffuse and 10% gloss. Our renderings were based on a Microfacet model using\nGGX to describe the microfacet distribution function D and Smith to describe the\nshadowing and masking function G (see Walter et al., 2007 for details). We manipulated\nthe width parameter in the distribution function to obtain different gloss levels (alpha\nbetween 0.5 and 0.029). All gloss levels were chosen such that two consecutive levels were\napproximately perceptually equal by using a single maximum likelihood difference scaling\nscaling (MLDS; Maloney & Yang, 2003) dataset. MLDS offers an elegant way to estimate\nthe possibly nonlinear relationship between physical and psychological dimensions (here\ngloss and albedo). Two separate experiments were conducted with either varying albedo or\nvarying gloss while keeping the other dimension constant. We chose a set of 10 surfaces for\neach experiment. Based on the fitted physical-to-perceptual transformation, new physical\nstimulus magnitudes for gloss and albedo were selected and the final surfaces for the\nexperiment were rendered. Following this procedure, the perceptual differences between\nthe five albedo and the five gloss levels were thus perceptually equal. The blue line in\nFigure 4(a) and the red line in Figure 4(b) demonstrate that the procedure was successful\nin making perceptually equal differences between the stimuli.\nIn addition, we rendered each surface with one of five different albedos, ranging from dark\ngray to light gray. We did not render an entirely black and white surface to preserve the\nvisibility of the shape and the highlights. Concerned with the problem of tone mapping,\nhistograms of the lightest surfaces were plotted to check that the brightest highlights were\nnot clipped. The maximum luminance value in the image corresponded to 97% of the\nmaximum luminance of the screen. All differences between the albedo levels were also\nchosen so that they were perceptually equal to the next level based on data from an initial\nmaximum likelihood difference scaling experiment, as described earlier.\nIn total, we obtained 75 different surfaces (5 Albedos \u00c2 5 Gloss Levels \u00c2 3 Shapes) that\nwere used as the background images. The centered surface was always a mid-gray ('l\n) and\nFigure 1. Perlin noise images used as procedural textures.\nHansmann-Roth and Mamassian 3\nmid-gloss surface ('g\n) and was also rendered with one of the three different Perlin noise\ntextures.\nA smaller square was then cut and placed in front of larger background images (Figure 2).\nHowever, we ensured that the small central square out was not cut from the same larger\nsurface, so that the center and background were always distinguishable even when they had\nthe same albedo and gloss level.\nThis technique led to 75 different images that always consisted of a mid-gray and mid-gloss\ncenter in front of one of the 75 possible background images.\nApparatus\nEach surface was displayed on a 24-in. calibrated LED monitor (Viewsonic V3D245) with a\nlinearized gamma. The resolution was set to 1920 \u00c2 1080. All stimuli were displayed using\nMatlab R2010a (The MathWorks Inc., Massachusetts, US) and Psychtoolbox-3 (Brainard,\nProcedure\nWe conducted two experiments: In the first experiment, the baseline experiment, observers\nwere presented with the background images only. In the second study, we used the center-\nsurround display described earlier.\nAll observers were seated 56 cm away from the monitor inside a dark experimental booth\nand viewed the stimuli with both eyes. The images did not contain binocular disparities, so\nfrom a stereoscopic perspective, the stimuli were consistent with flat objects. They passed a\nfamiliarization phase consisting of 25 trials to practice the procedure of the experiment. Each\nexperiment contained 900 trials (300 Different Stimuli Pairs \u00c2 3 Repetitions, Without Self-\nComparisons). Both experiments consisted of the same procedure: Each trial started with a\nfixation cross for 200 ms followed by the presentation of the first surface for 500 ms, followed\nby a 200-ms interstimulus interval and the presentation of the second surface for 500 ms.\nAfter each trial, observers were prompted to indicate which surface appeared to be lighter\nFigure 2. Two typical stimuli from Experiment 2.\n(Experiments 1a and 2a) or which surface appeared to be glossier (Experiments 1b and 2b).\nAfter pressing the appropriate response key, the next trial began.\nObservers\nTwelve observers (6 observers in Experiment 1a and 6 observers in Experiment 1b)\nparticipated in the first study and 12 (6 observers in Experiment 2a and 6 observers in\nExperiment 2b) observers participated in the second study. One participant from\nExperiment 1a also participated in Experiment 1b. All observers were nai\u00a8ve to the purpose\nof the study and had all normal or corrected-to-normal vision. They all gave written,\ninformed consent. All experiments were done in agreement with the local ethics committee\nfrom Universite\n\u00b4 Paris Descartes and the Declaration of Helsinki.\nAnalysis\nIn a nutshell, we consider three different models. The first model, the independent observer\nmodel, considers that only the physical dimension of interest (e.g., surface gloss) can influence\nthe perception of that dimension (e.g., perceived gloss). The second model, the additive\nobserver model, considers that a physically irrelevant dimension (e.g., surface albedo) can\ninfluence the perception of the dimension of interest (e.g., perceived gloss), but only by an\namount that only depends on the irrelevant dimension (e.g., a dark gray surface increases all\nperceived gloss levels by 10%). Finally, the third model, the full observer model, is similar to\nthe additive model except that it allows for an additional interaction term between the\ndimension of interest and the irrelevant one.\nFollowing the procedure used by Ho et al. (2008), we define the additive observer model\nand tested it against the independent observer model and the full/saturated observer model.\nIn the following, we describe the principle based on an experiment judging gloss, but the same\napplies to lightness judgments.\nEach of the two surfaces which are presented during one trial has a fixed gloss level 'g\ni\n, 'g\nk\nand lightness level 'l\nj\n, 'l\nl\n. When observers are asked to indicate which surface is glossier, an\nestimate of perceived gloss g is computed for both surfaces. This perceptual estimate\ndepends on the perceived gloss and also potentially on the perceived lightness:\ng\nij\n\u00bc g\ni\n\u00fe l\nj\nBoth estimates from the two presented surfaces are then compared and the difference is\ncomputed:\n\u00c1 i, j, k, l\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\n\u00c0\ng\ni\n\u00fe l\nj\n\u00c1\n\u00c0\n\u00c0\ng\nk\n\u00fe l\nl\n\u00c1\nwhere \" is an unbiased normally distributed judgment error: \" $ N 0, 2\n.\nIn this additive model, the conjoint measurement technique assumes an additive\ncontribution of both lightness and gloss, and in addition, the contamination of a second\nfeature on the first feature is independent of the level of the first feature. In other words, here,\nthe albedo contamination on perceived gloss is independent of the gloss level. For each\nmaterial, the difference is computed separately and then the differences are added together\nto make a final decision. For each lightness and gloss level, we need to estimate the\nparameters g\ni\nand l\nj\nfrom the data. With five different lightness and five different gloss\nlevels and the variance 2, we need to fit 11 parameters. However, from Equation (2) we can\nHansmann-Roth and Mamassian 5\nconclude that any parameter will account equally well if we add or multiply it by a constant c.\nTherefore, l\nand g\ncan be set to zero and 2 will be set to 1. The eight parameters are\nestimated using maximum likelihood estimations. In the following analysis, however, we will\nset l\nand g\nto zero rather than l\nand g\n. This choice comes from the fact that the center\nof the surface was always rendered with lightness and gloss level 3. Therefore, in some trials\nthe surround and the center exhibited the same lightness and gloss levels.\nIf the lightness of the surface has no additional influence on perceived gloss, we are left\nwith the independent observer model:\n\u00c1 i, j, k, l\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc g\ni\n\u00c0 g\nk\nFor a full model, perceived lightness and glossiness are modeled with an interaction factor,\nbringing the number of free parameters to 24 that are linked as follows:\n\u00c1 i, j, k, l\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc g\ni\n\u00fe l\nj\n\u00fe gl\nij\n \n\u00c0 g\nk\n\u00fe l\nl\n\u00fe gl\nkl\n \nWe used the framework from Ho et al. (2008) where the model makes no assumption\nabout the direction of the effects: Estimated parameters can be positive or negative and the\nfunction could also be nonmonotonic. We analyzed our data using the maximum likelihood\nconjoint measurement (MLCM) package (Knoblauch & Maloney, 2012, 2014) in the open\nsource software R (R Development Core Team, 2012) to estimate the perceptual scale values\nand model the contribution of both features, albedo and gloss. All three models are nested\nwithin each other and were tested against each other using a likelihood ratio test of nested\nmodels using the x2-statistic.\nResults\nExperiment 1: Baseline Experiment\nIn the baseline experiment, observers are presented with single surfaces only. We first present\nthe raw data in a matrix format where each cell of the matrix corresponds to one stimulus\npair comparison. Each conjoint proportion plot contains all stimulus combinations and\nindicates the proportion that stimulus Skl\nis judged to be lighter than Sij\n. As an illustration\nof this matrix format for lightness judgments, we show a simulated independent observer that\nis using only surface albedo and not surface gloss in its judgments (Figure 3(a)). Lightness\njudgments averaged across all observers are shown in Figure 3(b). Observers are fairly similar\nto the simulated independent observer, albeit a bit more variable. Figure 3(c) and (d) shows\nsimulated and observers gloss judgments. The results point to strong deviations away from\nthe independent observer that estimates gloss with no contaminations from the varying\nalbedo levels (some 5 \u00c2 5 checks are not uniformly gray). The influence of the lightness is\nthe strongest when the difference in gloss between the two surfaces to be compared is small\n(see the 5 \u00c2 5 checks just above the diagonal). In that case, observers judged the darker\nsurface to be glossier (gradient of gloss judgments within the 5 \u00c2 5 small checks from top-\nleft to bottom-right).\nA nice way to summarize the data of Figure 3 is to fit the additive model to the data.\nFigure 4 shows the parameter estimates under this additive model averaged across all\nobservers. For each observer, the parameter estimates were normalized to the maximum\nvalue to describe the relative magnitude of the contribution. The influence of the primary\ndimension (red curve in Figure 4(a) and blue curve in Figure 4(b)) was close to linear. This is\nnot surprising given that all levels were based on a preliminary MLDS experiment, so that\ndifferences in the albedo and gloss level were perceptually equivalent. In both experiments, we\nfound a negative correlation between the secondary dimension and the perceptual judgment\nindicating that an increase in albedo reduced perceived gloss and an increase in gloss reduced\nperceived lightness. To investigate whether observers' judgments were significantly\ncontaminated by the irrelevant material property, we tested whether the parameter\nestimates of the secondary dimension deviated away from zero. Therefore, we fitted the\nindependent observer model to the data in which the irrelevant property was set to zero\nand compared it to the additive model using a nested hypothesis test. The independent model\ncould be rejected, at the Bonferroni-corrected level (p < .0083), for 5 out of 6 observers\n(1 observer: p \u00bc .012). Although the contribution of gloss on perceived lightness is small, it\nis significant. In addition, we tested whether lightness had a significant influence on perceived\ngloss. Figure 4(b) already shows that the contribution of lightness on perceived gloss is larger\nthan the influence that gloss has on lightness (Figure 4(a)). Comparing the independent with\nFigure 3. Conjoint proportion plots for Experiment 1. Each plot shows the proportion of stimulus Skl\nto be\njudged lighter (glossier) than stimulus Sij\n. The left matrices show conjoint proportion plots from a simulated\nindependent observer which is uncontaminated by the irrelevant cue of the surface and the right matrices the\ndata averaged across all participants. The gloss level i and k are indicated by the large numerical labels (large\nchecks) and each check is subdivided into smaller 5 \u00c2 5 checks indicating the lightness levels j and l (small\nnumerical labels).\nHansmann-Roth and Mamassian 7\nthe additive model revealed that the independent model had to be rejected for all our\nobservers (p < .0081). Glossy surfaces reduced lightness judgments by an average of 12%\nand gloss judgments were reduced on lighter surfaces by an average of 32%.\nThe additive model assumes that the contribution of both properties is additive and that\nthis contribution of the second dimension is independent of the first dimension. The full\nmodel includes an interaction term, which depends on the levels of both stimulus\ndimensions and therefore allows for nonlinear interactions. To compare the additive with\nthe full model, we first fitted the full model to the data and then compared the fits from the\nadditive model using a nested hypothesis test. Figure 5(a) compares the additive with the full\nmodel when observers judged the lightness and Figure 5(b) compares the additive and full\nmodel when gloss was judged. The nested hypothesis test verified that for most observers the\nfull model did not describe the data better than the additive model (4 observers: ns, 2 observer\np < .0011). For our two observers when lightness was judged, the gloss contamination was\nsignificantly stronger for higher gloss levels.\nAlbedo influenced gloss in a similar manner (Figure 5(b)). Gloss judgments of highly\nglossy surfaces were more affected by the albedo of the surface than for the low gloss\nsurfaces, which is visible as a change in slopes in Figure 5(b). However, this is only\nstatistically significant for one out of six observers (1 observer: p < .0001; 5 observers: ns).\nExperiment 2\nIn Experiment 2, all stimuli contained a central patch that had constant albedo and gloss\nproperties, while the background surface had varying gloss and albedo. Participants had to\njudge the appearance of either the albedo or the gloss of the central patch while the albedo\nand gloss levels of the background were manipulated.\nWe start with lightness judgments. Figure 6(a) shows the simulations of an observer who is\njudging the constant albedo of the central patch and is only influenced by the albedo of the\nbackground. In other words, its lightness judgments are uncontaminated by the gloss of the\nbackground. We assume that this observer is subject to the simultaneous contrast\nphenomenon whereby a dark background increases the perceived lightness of the center\nFigure 4. Normalized parameter estimates averaged across all observers under an additive model.\n(a) Estimates for the lightness judgments (n \u00bc 6) and (b) parameter estimates for the gloss judgments (n \u00bc 6).\nThe lightness estimates are plotted in red and the gloss estimates are plotted in blue. Error bars indicate the\nstandard error of the mean.\n(this produces a gradient within the 5 \u00c2 5 small checks from top-left to bottom-right).\nFigure 6(b) shows the results averaged across our observers when they judged the lightness\nof the central patch. While the general pattern expected from simultaneous contrast is\npresent, there are small deviations that are caused by the varying gloss levels of the\nbackground.\nLet us now consider the glossiness judgments. Figure 6(c) shows the simulations of a\nplausible observer based on a combination of simultaneous contrast and the results of\nExperiment 1. According to simultaneous contrast, a darker background produces a\nlighter center, and according to Experiment 1, a lighter center should decrease perceived\ngloss. When we described the results of Experiment 1, we estimated the parameters for\nperceived lightness and gloss under the additive model, and these parameters were used to\nmake the predictions shown in Figure 6(c). Figure 6(d) shows the results for the glossiness\ntask averaged across all observers. There are large discrepancies between these results and\nFigure 6(c), indicating that our simulated observer is not appropriate.\nIn an attempt to gain more insight from the results of Experiment 2, we estimated the\nparameters for perceived lightness and gloss under the additive model, similarly to what we\nhave done for Experiment 1. Figure 7 shows these parameter estimates averaged across all\nobservers.\nFor lightness judgments (Figure 7(a)), judgments of the lightness of the central patch were\ninfluenced by both the albedo and gloss of the background, in spite of the fact that the albedo\nof the central patch was kept constant. As expected from simultaneous contrast, perceived\nlightness of the center monotonically decreased with the lightness of the background (red\nline). We also found a smaller gloss contribution that also monotonically decreased:\nperceived lightness of the center decreased with glossier backgrounds (blue line). A nested\nhypothesis test verified that this contribution was significant. We therefore rejected the\nFigure 5. Comparison of the additive and full model averaged across all observers.

Given that the judged central patch is\nalways identical, participants could have answered randomly. Instead, we found that both the\ngloss and the albedo of the background had significant effects on perceived gloss of the\ncenter. Perceived gloss of the center decreased as a function of the albedo level of\nthe background: Darker backgrounds lead to a glossier appearance of the center.\nFigure 6.

For this simulated observer, darker backgrounds lead to a lighter\ncenter, and lighter surfaces in turn reduce glossiness. (d) Results from the glossiness judgments averaged\nacross the 5 observers.\nThe contribution of the gloss of the background on the perceived gloss of the center is more\ncomplex and asymmetric. Matte backgrounds decrease perceived gloss of the center, whereas\nglossy backgrounds have almost no effect on perceived gloss of the center.\nFigure 8 plots a comparison between the additive and full model for the lightness and gloss\njudgments. Figure 8(a) plots the additive and the full model of the lightness judgments. Most\nof the curves for the additive model overlap the curves for the full model. This is confirmed by\na nested hypothesis test, at the Bonferroni-corrected level (.0083), that indicates that for most\nof our observers the simpler additive model is sufficient to describe the data (5 out of 6\nobservers: ns; 1 observer: p < .001). Figure 8(b) plots a comparison between the additive\nand full model for the gloss judgments. The nested hypothesis test at the Bonferroni-\ncorrected level (.0083) verified that the additive model was sufficient for most of our\nDiscussion\nWe used the MLCM technique to quantify the interactions of albedo and gloss on a surface\nfor the perception of lightness and gloss. In baseline experiments, we quantified the strength\nof the contamination of both of these dimensions on single extended surfaces. Darker\nsurfaces are perceived glossier and glossier surfaces also tend to be seen as darker. Our\nresults clearly confirm these interactions that have been reported before in the literature\nMLCM technique helped us quantify the strength of these effects. Parameter estimates\nrevealed that enhancing the albedo would decrease perceived gloss by more than 30%.\nContrast gloss which has already been described by Hunter and Harold (1987), indeed\nseems to be a crucial dimension in gloss perception.It has also been proposed by\nPellacini et al. (2000) to be one of the main dimensions when estimating gloss. Glossy\nsurfaces also sometimes decrease perceived lightness of the surface. In particular, glossy\nobjects appear darker when there is evidence in the image for dark specular lowlights (Kim\net al., 2012) that can be a cue for the perception of gloss. Even though we do not have\nFigure 7. Normalized parameter estimates averaged across all observers under the additive model.\n(a) Estimates for the lightness judgments (n \u00bc 6) and (b) parameter estimates for the gloss judgments (n \u00bc 6).\nThe contribution of the albedo of the background is plotted in red and the contribution of the gloss of the\nbackground is plotted in blue. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean.\nHansmann-Roth and Mamassian 11\nlowlights in our images, it is plausible that glossy surfaces appearing darker is a general\nprinciple.\nIn our main experiments, we used the conjoint measurement technique to investigate the\ninfluence that contextual albedo and physical gloss have on perceived lightness and perceived\ngloss of another surface. For this purpose, we used a stimulus akin to the one used in\nsimultaneous contrast experiments, in which we kept the material properties of a central\nsurface patch constant and manipulated the background material properties (both albedo\nand gloss). Given that the center was made out of the same material, one could have expected\nthat participants always responded randomly. This is in contrast to the MLCM experiment of\nHo et al. (2008) where there were clear first and second dimensions that were expected to\ndrive the percept. In spite of having identical material properties, the lightness and gloss of\nthe central patch appeared different when it was placed in the middle of different\nbackgrounds. The significant results we obtained in the objective MLCM tasks were\nconfirmed by subjective informal reports of the observers who all reported seeing\ndifferences between the two centers in a pair of stimuli, most dramatically in terms of\nlightness.\nLightness comparisons of the two centers indicated a standard simultaneous contrast that\nwas reduced when the background surface was glossy. Those results replicate recent findings\nby Schmid and Anderson (2014). They investigated lightness constancy with rocky 3D\nbackground, 2D variegated and phase-scrambled backgrounds. Results indicated that\nlightness constancy was improved for test patches that were surrounded by glossy, bumpy\nsurfaces compared to test patches that were embedded into matte, bumpy surroundings.\nHowever, the authors obtained a similar improvement in lightness constancy with\nbackgrounds that were phase-scrambled, which preserved the spatial frequency content\nand appeared more like grainy textures with variations in pigment. The improvement in\nlightness constancy, that was similar for the glossy and phase-scrambled backgrounds,\nFigure 8. Comparison of the additive and full model averaged across all observers.

Error bars indicate the standard error of the\nmean.\nseems to not be based on the information from the specular highlights itself, but low-level\ninformation like contrast and albedo distribution that is preserved in the phase-scrambled\nimages (Schmid & Anderson, 2014). An increase in lightness constancy with greater\narticulation has been initially reported by Katz (1935) and later been replicated with\nGloss comparisons of the two central patches are more complex. Both the albedo and the\ngloss of the surround had strong effects on perceived gloss of the center. Backgrounds that\nvary in albedo will induce the simultaneous contrast effect. Even though observers are asked\nto judge the gloss, there will be a compulsory effect in perceived lightness too. We presented a\nplausible simulated observer for whom a dark background enhances perceived lightness in\nthe center, which then reduces perceived gloss of the center. Our results from the baseline\nexperiment indeed showed that an increase in albedo lead to a decrease in perceived gloss.\nHowever, as the results from the second experiment shows, this is not the case. An alternative\ninterpretation of our results can be found from the perceived range of albedo in the center\nimage. Because of simultaneous contrast, a dark background increases the overall perceived\nbrightness of the center image, including the brightness of the highlights that have the highest\nluminance values in the image. A dark background might therefore increase the perceived\ngloss of the center image and thus account for the results obtained in Experiment 2.\nThe effects that glossy backgrounds produce on perceived gloss of the center are still puzzling.\nOur results resemble an assimilation effect, in which a matte background reduces the perceived\ngloss of the center, whereas a glossy background has only a negligible effect on perceived gloss of\nthe center. Clearly, more work is needed to better understand this aspect of our study.\nThe central patches of the simultaneous contrast display were cut out of larger surfaces so\nthat the center and background were noncontinuous. We believe that continuous surfaces\nthat maintain the shape and change albedo in the center will increase the likelihood that a\ntransparent layer is perceived in front of the center of the surface. The underlying continuous\nshape induces X-junctions that would cause the appearance of transparency (Adelson &\nAnandan, 1990; Anderson, 1997). In order to prevent this effect that is segmenting the\nimage into two surfaces at different depth that in turn could influence gloss perception, we\nelected to present only surfaces that were noncontinuous.\nIn Experiment 2, participants were asked to rate the central patch of the simultaneous\ncontrast display. We could not prevent our participants from rating the background surface.\nHowever, when comparing the results from Experiments 1 and 2, we can reject this\ninterpretation. If participants would have judged the background surface instead the results\nfrom Experiment 2 should resemble the perceptual scale from Experiment 1. This is not the\ncase. In Experiment 1, we found a decrease of perceived gloss for lighter colored surfaces but an\nincrease in perceived gloss of the center when the background was lighter colored.\nOverall, the MLCM method offers the opportunity of quantifying possible cues to gloss\nperception. Rather than analyzing their contributions in isolation, cues can be varied\nsimultaneously on single surfaces and then analyzed to weight each of their contributions.\nThese weights are valuable information for any model that attempts to explain the\ncomplexity of human gloss perception. Even though no such model is presented here, it is\nclear that such a model will need to account for the way albedo and gloss interact and\ninfluence other nearby surfaces.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nHansmann-Roth and Mamassian 13\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article: SHR and PM were supported by the EU Marie Curie Initial Training\nReferences\nAdelson, E.
