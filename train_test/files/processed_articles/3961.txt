We describe the formal structure of pictorial space purely in the\nphenomenological domain, without taking recourse to the theories of optics which properly apply to\nphysical space--a distinct ontological domain.

Then the vantage point is--for all practical purposes--the center of\nrotation of the eyeball (Graham 1965; von Helmholtz 1856). It is conventionally regarded as\nthe task of vision to coordinate depth with range as well as possible. This is the mainstream\nideal of veridical perception (Marr 1982). Perhaps unfortunately, this turns the bulk of depth-\nrelated vision research into a normative, rather than descriptive, enterprise.\nThere are conceptual problems with this view. For instance, as Wittgenstein (1921)\nobserves in Tractatus (our translation):\n5.632 The subject is not in the world, but is a boundary of the world.\n5.633 Where in the world does one find a metaphysical subject? You say, it is much\nlike the case of the eye and the visual field. But you don't really see the eye. No\nfeature of the visual field allows you to conclude that it is seen from an eye.\nOne arrives at the paradoxical situation that depth is supposed to be a correlate of range,\nwhereas the eye and the object are not even together in visual awareness. The mainstream\n(1)One often uses \"distance\" instead of range. We refrain from this in order to avoid certain inconsisten-\ncies. For instance, distances in three-dimensional Euclidean space are properties of nonoriented line\nsegments, whereas range is a property of a direction which is obviously oriented. This is a categorical\ndifference. The literature rarely makes the distinction.\n542 J J Koenderink, A J van Doorn, J Wagemans\nview is that of an external observer. It fails to apply to the content of visual awareness, which\nis necessarily a first-person account.(2)\nA truly phenomenological account of depth--from the inside out, as it were--is required\nin order to arrive at the beginning of a psychological theory.\nFor the case of pictorial space this is the only rational starting point, because the notion\nof range is irrelevant to visual awareness. Only for the case of vision-in-the-world does one\nalso require the relation to range. We have studied this extensively in our earlier work (Hecht\n2008). The theory of physical range is already in place. It is Euclidean geometry (for Euclid,\nsee Burton 1945). What are needed in order to handle depth are forms of psychophysical\nbridge hypotheses and ways of operationalization of various aspects of depth.\nThere is a pervasive trend to consider pictorial vision as a limiting case of vision-in-the-\nworld (Gibson 1950). This involves treating the picture as a window on a physical scene--\nso-called \"Alberti's window\" (Alberti and Grayson 1972; Pirenne 1970). This would indeed\nput the eye in pictorial space (eg, at the \"perspective center\") and thus reduce all problems\nof pictorial perception to generic visual perception. Although thus highly attractive to the\nmainstream, it is a limiting, artificial case that can be approached only in laboratory settings.\nIt is too restricted to be of much interest in the study of pictorial vision per se.(3),(4)\nIn this paper we attempt to construct an account of depth from the inside out, and we\nconsider bridging hypotheses and aspects of various operational definitions of depth.\n2.1 Depth as feeling\nPhenomenologically, perhaps the most basic meaning of depth is as a general feeling of\nseparateness from the self, or remoteness. One is indeed tempted to say \"remoteness from the\nself\", but in immediate visual awareness the self does not necessary figure at all. Immediate\nawareness is of the nature of \"presentation\", something just happening, out of voluntary\ncontrol, and prereflective.\nIn this sense remoteness, or separateness, occurs in all modalities, though perhaps in\nsome more readily than in others. In humans it most prominently occurs in vision and\naudition, to a lesser extent in touch, and to an even lesser extent in gustatory and olfactory\nawareness. It is likely to be different in your cat or dog, and so forth. We can only guess with\nrespect to sonar in bats, electroperception in sharks, and the like (Nagel 1974).\n(2) Even this is saying too much because visual awareness does not imply the notion of an ego.\n(3) We find repeatedly (Koenderink et al 2009) that human observers treat the \"visual directions\" as\nbeing lines perpendicular to the picture plane, thus all mutually parallel. Notice that this would place\nthe eye at \"minus infinity\"--that is to say, outside pictorial space proper.\n(4) A good operational definition of the pictorial mode is to move your head or body. If you move\nsomewhat in front of a painting, nothing much changes in pictorial space. In contradistinction, if\nyou move your head when you presume to look into a window, you will notice peculiar, nonrigid\ndeformations. This is a common experience when viewing baroque ceiling paintings. These are often\nof great extent and at considerable distance. If well painted, then they easily beat any \"virtual reality\"\nsetup we have ever seen. The famous example (due to Pirenne 1970) is Pozzo's ceiling painting in the\nchurch of Sant'Ignazio at Rome, but Europe (especially Germany, Austria, and Italy) is full of examples\nlike this. Such deformations signify that your visual awareness is that of a window to which your eye is\nattached. On the other hand, the absence of such deformations when viewing a painting shows that\nyour visual awareness is that of looking at a picture. Your eye is attached to the picture plane, but not\nto the pictorial space.\nThe feeling of separateness is perhaps induced through the feeling of being acted upon.\nAction and suffering(5) are common to all life forms, including the most primitive ones\nVisual awareness can be more or less articulate. As one looks into a Ganzfeld the awareness\nis that of a luminous foggy atmosphere (Metzger 1953). It is indeed \"out there\" (remote), but\nthe remoteness has no \"value\" (in a numerical sense). In perhaps more common cases visual\nawareness tends to be more articulate. In such cases the mere feeling of remoteness admits\nto degrees and can often be correlated with a scale.\nIf you articulate the visual field, for instance by presenting a statistically uniform\narrangement of polka dots instead of a uniform field (Ganzfeld), most observers become\naware of a surface (Koenderink et al 2009).(6) The surface is apparently at a particular depth,\nbecause it is \"thin\" and \"located\", but it is entirely undetermined what that depth is. The very\nnotion of \"(absolute) location in depth\" is alien to the awareness. The surface just is--who\nknows where exactly?\nFrom a formal, geometrical point of view one concludes that depth seems to have a single\ndimension, no obvious limits, and no origin (anchor) or unit (yardstick). A suitable model\nmight be the geometrical line without additional properties.\nThat depth admits of something like a \"location\" becomes clear when you add various\n\"cues\". By cue we mean any aspect of image structure that happens to influence the depth\nexperience, not necessarily admitting of a physical or physiological \"explanation\" (Berkeley\n1709). For instance, if we--in the aforementioned example--vary the individual sizes or\ncolors of the polka dots, one tends to become aware of modulations of depth. The simplest\nexample is the basic figure\u00adground distinction. The figure is experienced as \"in front of\" the\nground. This may lead to arbitrarily long sequences of depths (Figure 1); thus it introduces\nan ordinal depth scale.\nFigure 1. The picture at left is usually seen as a series of square tiles, stacked in depth. This depth order\nis roughly as shown in the volumetric view at center. The red arrow indicates the direction of view. In\nthe alternative configuration at right one has a stack of rectangular tiles, with the right--instead of the\nleft--one nearest to the viewer. This is another interpretation of the same picture at left. Both center\nand right interpretations of the picture at left are equally \"valid\" (both yield the projection shown at\nleft), although the depth orders are mutually reversed.\nFrom a formal, geometrical perspective the depth line becomes near-/far-polarized and\nadmits of a serial order of points.\n(5) Being acted upon, perhaps through the encounter of a resistance to an action, may be denoted\n\"suffering\", because it is not self-initiated.\n(6) In our experiment one out of eighty observers became aware of a volume filled with spheres,\nwhereas all others reported to see a surface.\n544 J J Koenderink, A J van Doorn, J Wagemans\nNotice that such a depth order is defined only locally. Globally, the depth order (if any) is\nonly a partial order (Figure 2). Thus it is possible to speak of the depth order (which may or\nmay not be defined or may be ambiguous) of points in the visual field, though not necessarily\nof a depth order of extended objects.\nFigure 2. The red ring is neither fully in front nor fully behind the blue beam. Locally, both cases occur.\nIn many cases one is aware of a depth order that appears to be more strongly developed than\njust ordinal. \"Absolute depth\" is a meaningless notion in any case, but it is often possible to\nmutually compare depth differences, and perhaps there is even a notion of depth difference\nmagnitude.\nFrom a formal, geometrical point of view this implies that one has an affine scale. This\ninvolves a numerical measure, say a real number, characterizing the depth. Since the depth\ndomain has no obvious boundary, this number may be taken to range from minus to plus\ninfinity. For any given point two observers will most likely come up with different numerical\ndepth values. But this does not mean anything in the absence of a natural origin and unit\nmeasure. One might capture this by saying that the depth is only relevant modulo(7) an\narbitrary offset and unit (see Figure 3). Then the depth values assigned by the two observers\nno longer count as distinct.\nFigure 3. The notion of \"affine line\". The red point has coordinate 0.5 in the upper, but 1.666... in\nthe lower scales. These scales are fully equivalent. They have different origins and units. Every affine\nproperty works equally well in either scale. For instance, the midpoint of the segment defined by two\narbitrary points can be calculated (by taking the average) on either scale. Although the numbers (the\ncoordinates) will differ, the point (as located on the corresponding scale) will be the same.\nAt the close of the 19th century the German sculptor Adolf Hildebrand (1901) noticed that\nhuman observers have difficulty discriminating work \"in the round\" from work \"in relief\".\n(7)Modulo is a standard technical term used in formal discussions. It means \"disregarding certain\nvariations regarded as irrelevant\". For instance, a geometrical configuration modulo position, size, and\nspatial attitude is \"shape\".\nIn his ground-breaking book The Problem of Form he argued that the actual depth relief is\nlargely irrelevant to human vision, though--of course--not to touch.(8)\nFrom a formal, geometrical point of view this implies that an augmented transformation\nthat not only adds an arbitrary shift but also scales depth by an arbitrary (but positive)\namount leaves the description invariant. This means that the depth domain is the \"affine\nline\"--that is, the real numbers modulo an arbitrary scaling and offset.\nIn the 1990s we (empirically, and only by accident!) discovered another basic ambiguity\n(Koenderink et al 2001). Human observers largely agree in their depth judgments modulo a\ntransformation of an even further augmented type than with only scaling and offset--namely,\nwith additional changes of the apparent frontal plane. In many cases their numerical depth\njudgments fail to correlate in a straight regression, whereas a multiple regression including\nthe picture plane coordinates, perhaps surprisingly, reveals that the correlations are typically\nvery high! This implies that the depth scales differ systematically for various points in the\npicture plane.\nEach point of the picture plane carries the full depth dimension. We denote these depth\ndimensions \"depth threads\". Thus pictorial space is a sheaf of depth threads. The structure of\nthe picture plane serves to parameterize (label) them. Each thread carries its own ordinal\ndepth scale. The finding mentioned above implies that these depth scales are different\n(a straight regression of depths reveals no correlation), though somehow coordinated (a\nmultiple regression including the label \"which thread\" yields a high correlation).\nConsider a plane in pictorial space that meets every thread just once. Any generic plane\nwill do. Such a plane implies a depth value at every point of the picture plane. The results\nof depth measurements for different observers typically differ by exactly such an \"additive\nplane\". It is as if observers may take different planes to be the (or their) \"frontal plane\".(9) This\nis an unexpected, and from a mainstream perspective surprising, finding.\nA geometrical way to put this is to say that observers impose a \"gauge\" (or \"gauge field\")\non their pictorial space that can be represented as a pair of mutually parallel planes (see\nFigure 4). Such a gauge imposes an origin and unit point on all threads. It serves to mutually\ncoordinate the depth scales on the various threads. Each observer (or the same observer at\ndifferent occasions) applies an idiosyncratic gauge. As a consequence one cannot merely\nconsider depth as such (that is to say, per visual direction), but one is forced to consider\npictorial space as an integral entity. This has very important consequences for the analysis of\npsychophysical results. Perhaps unfortunately, the literature has been slow to take this up.\nA naive analysis will use a default gauge that assigns the picture plane as base plane, con-\nventionally denoted frontal plane. Unfortunately, observers often do not comply. Moreover,\ndifferent observers make different choices. Failure to pick up on this is an important cause of\ntrouble with literature results.\nA gauge has four degrees of freedom. It can be thought of as composed of a shift in\ndepth (one parameter), a scaling of depth (another parameter), and an additive plane (an\nadditional pair of parameters). For zero shift, unit scaling, and a fronto-parallel additive plane\none obtains simply the identity.(10) If you apply two of these transformations in succession (a\nconcatenation of gauges), you obtain just another gauge. Formally, one says that the gauge\n(8)The reason is that Hildebrand (1901) defines \"pure vision\" (or \"artistic vision\") as vision based on a\nsingle viewpoint. In contrast, binocular vision and motion parallax are more like touch in the sense of\nproviding multiple (simultaneous or successive) viewpoints.\n(9) This representation of the depth domain is formally identical to the \"bas-relief ambiguity\",\nsometimes called \"relief scaling and additive plane\", of computer vision (Belhumeur et al 1999).\n(10) An identity is a transformation that leaves everything the same. Such transformations are\nconventionally designated \"identities\" in formal discussions.\n546 J J Koenderink, A J van Doorn, J Wagemans\nFigure 4. A \"gauge\" is a pair of parallel planes, a \"base plane\" B (in red), and a \"unit plane\" U (in\nblue). The gauge induces a scale in every depth thread (such as aa and bb ), the intersection with\nthe base plane being the \"origin\" and the intersection with the unit plane the point at unit distance\nfrom the origin. Notice that the gauge serves to mutually relate the depth scales of all threads. The\ngauge induces different origins on the threads and synchronizes their units. In this picture the depth\ndimension extends vertically; the top and bottom planes of the box suggest a default gauge, which is\nparallel to the picture plane. The points on the thread have unit spacing. They serve to define depth\nnumerically (as illustrated on aa and bb ), though for each thread individually. Each thread has its\nown scale as defined by the gauge.\ntransformations form a group,(11) which may be called the group of \"depth similarities\". If\nthe scaling is constrained to be one, you obtain a subgroup of \"depth motions\". The group of\ndepth motions is commutative;(12) it does not matter in what order you apply motions, the\nresult is always the same.\nThe gauge imposed by observers was already intuited by Hildebrand (1901), who\nsuggested that one should conceive of depth as of the relation of an object with respect\nto two mutually parallel glass panes. This is just an implementation of a gauge. The insights\nof Hildebrand are surprising in view of the fact that modern science (early 21st century), has\nstill to catch up with him!\n2.4 The abacus model\nThe group of depth motions by definition leaves the structure of pictorial space invariant, by\nexactly the same philosophy that underlies the notion of \"congruency\" in Euclidean space:\nif two configurations can be superimposed through a motion, then they are considered to\nbe geometrically identical. Notice that changes of gauge (the depth similarities) conserve a\ndepth thread (visual direction) as a whole; they merely shift depth values along the threads\n(visual directions).\nThis gives rise to an intuitive model of pictorial space that we will refer to as the \"abacus\nmodel\". Remember that an abacus is a frame with a set of parallel wires on which you may\nshift beads. In the model we usually consider only a single bead per wire. The wires signify\nthe depth threads, or visual directions, whereas the beads indicate depth values. Shifting the\nbeads mimics the process in microgeny(13) that establishes pictorial depth. Thus this part of\n(11) It is not hard to work out the nature of multiplication in the group, and one easily constructs the\ninverse of a gauge. The inverse always exists, and is unique.\n(12)The full group of similarities is not commutative (or Abelian), though.\n(13) \"Microgenesis\" is the term in phenomenological analysis that designates the process that generates\nvisual awareness. It remains itself unconscious and is known only through its result.\nNotice that each location of the visual field(14) carries its own thread (depth direction)\nand that all threads are mutually isolated from each other. Thus the wires of the abacus are\nmutually unconnected and never merge. If we push all beads to their resting position (thereby\n\"forgetting\" all depth values), we \"project\" pictorial space on the picture plane. The artist\nwho--for compositional purposes--views his or her painting as a quilt of colored patches\napplies such a projection. This feat takes practice, and most naive observers (nonartists)\nnever achieve it.(15)\nThe abacus model is evidently some kind of three-dimensional space. The essential\ndifference between the abacus model and, for example, the familiar Euclidean three-\ndimensional space is that the visual directions are mutually isolated. Thus you cannot\nrotate about a line in the picture plane, as this would \"mix up visual directions\". Such a\nrotation would reveal the back of the head of a portrait painted en face, thus such a constraint\ncertainly makes good sense. But remember that you can apparently (mentally) \"rotate\"\nthe apparent frontal plane! It merely takes a change of gauge. Fortunately, this is a non-\nEuclidean transformation that does not mix up visual directions, as will be shown below. In\nthe abacus model the picture plane is \"given\", whereas the microgenetic process underlying\nvisual awareness shifts depth values along the visual directions as beads along the strings of\nan abacus. In this Glasperlenspiel such shifts are supposedly induced by the various cues\nidentified by the microgeny (Figure 5).\nFigure 5. An impression of the \"abacus model\" of pictorial space. The yellow \"base space\" is the picture\nplane; the red spheres indicate some fiducial locations in the picture plane. The gray vertical rods are\nthe \"wires\" of the model; they stand for the depth threads (visual directions) associated with the points.\nThe blue spheres indicate the \"beads\" of the model; they can be shifted to indicate depth values. Each\nbead slides only over its own wire. Here microgeny has placed the beads in the position of an additive\nplane. This \"cross-section\" indicates a pictorial relief (which is flat in this case!).\nThe final presentation, and the cues on which it is based, develop together, in close\nsynchrony. Thus one cannot say that the presentation is a result of some algorithm applied to\n(14)We let the picture plane double for the visual field for the sake of this paper.\n(15) Formally, the abacus model is a \"fiber bundle\" over the Euclidean plane (\"base plane\", here the\npicture plane), the \"fibers\" (the threads are technically known as \"fibers\") being the affine line (the\nvisual directions) and the \"bundle projection\" the projection mentioned here (Husem\u00f6ller 1994).\n548 J J Koenderink, A J van Doorn, J Wagemans\nsome set of pre-established cues, which is perhaps closest to the current mainstream notion.\nRather:\nthere is no presentation without cues, but neither are there cues without the\npresentation.\nThis is an essential point that tends to be ignored in mainstream accounts.\nThe geometrical entities that make up pictorial space are defined as the invariants of the\ntransformations (Klein 1893) in the abacus model discussed above. That is to say, they have\nan existence that is independent of the actual description in terms of depth per se. They are\ndefined in terms of what remains untouched after you subject that description to arbitrary\ntransformations of the group of motions or similarities. Empirically, we have encountered\nfrequent examples where observers of the same picture did not agree at all in terms of their\ndepths, but very well in terms of the implied geometrical entities (Koenderink et al 2001).\nThis should be crucial in any account of pictorial perception. A simulated example is shown\nFigure 6. At left a set of depth values, each on their own depth thread. At right the same configuration\nhas been changed through an \"additive plane\". The additive plane is indicated with the red line. The\nconsequences of the additive plane are discussed in the next figure (Figure 7).\n2.5 Geometry of pictorial space\nMuch additional geometrical structure can easily be grafted on the abacus model.\nRegard two distinct points of pictorial space. We define their \"proper distance\" as the\nfamiliar Euclidean distance of their projections on the picture plane. This makes sense,\nbecause it is obviously invariant with respect to the group of depth similarities.\nBut what if this distance vanishes? Then the points might still be distinct! Such points we\ncall mutually parallel. In such a case of \"parallel points\" we define their \"special distance\" as\nthe depth difference of these points. (We use quotes to indicate that these are not Euclidean\nterms.) Notice that this makes sense only if the proper distance vanishes, for otherwise a\ndepth motion could change this special distance. Finally, we define \"the\" distance as either\nthe proper or the special distance, according to which one applies. This distance is evidently\nan invariant of any pair of points, whether parallel or not.\nFigure 7. At left the depth values corresponding to the cases illustrated in the previous figure (Figure\n6) are shown in a scatter plot. Notice that the additive plane has destroyed the correlation, as the\ncoefficient of variation is rather low. At right a multiple correlation that includes the position in the\npicture plane. This serves to \"correct for\" the different gauge. It is seen that the two depth distributions\nare after all identical. Gauges often suffice to \"explain\" the differences in depths for different observers.\nIn such cases we say that the observers are aware of the same depth configuration and differ in only\ntheir \"mental perspective\" on it. Failure to notice this would lead to the (erroneous!) conclusion that\nthe observers have fully different geometrical structures in visual awareness.\nThe shift parameter does not affect the proper distance, and acts the same on all wires\nof the abacus. It may thus be interpreted as a depth \"translation\". However, the additive\nplanes do act differently on different wires. We will show that they are naturally interpreted\nas (non-Euclidean) rotations. Finally, Hildebrand's relief parameter can be interpreted as a\nkind of scaling,(16) because it changes all special distances by the same factor. A \"change of\ngauge\" implies both a motion (translation and rotation) and a scaling.\nThe slant difference of two lines with the same projection in the pictorial plane may be\ndefined as the special distance of any parallel points on them, divided by the proper distance\nof these points to the intersection of the lines (Figure 8). In this definition a rotation adds the\nsame amount to the slopes of all lines that project on the same direction in the picture plane.\nThis justifies both the definition of \"rotation\" and of \"slant\" (that is, non-Euclidean angle,\nThe slant of a plane is defined as the maximum slant of any line contained in it, whereas\nthe tilt of a plane is defined as the direction in the picture plane of that maximally slanted\nline.\nA pure rotation leaves a certain line in the picture plane invariant (which may be called\nthe axis of rotation) and changes the slopes of all lines perpendicular (in the picture plane)\nto the axis by the amount of the rotation.\nNotice that slants span the range of minus to plus infinity, thus the angle measure is not\nperiodic as in Euclidean space. As mentioned earlier, this forces pictorial objects always to\nshow their same side. You can never see their back sides, no matter what rotation you apply.\n(16)We say \"kind of scaling\" because one may also scale the proper distances by changing just the size\nof the picture. Thus pictorial space allows of two distinct types of scaling. This is different from the\nEuclidean case because Euclidean angles--being periodic--cannot be scaled.\n550 J J Koenderink, A J van Doorn, J Wagemans\nP\nQ\nu\nv\n!uv\nFigure 8. The angle, or slant, in the abacus model. Consider a point A (here in the base plane that does\nnot matter) and two lines u and v through A. We consider \"the angle between u and v\", but consider a\nwire that meets the lines u and v in P and Q, respectively. Let the common projection of P and Q be\nB. Both P and Q have proper distance AB (in red) to the point A, whereas their special distance is PQ\n(in blue). We define the angle subtended by the lines (in blue) as PQ/AB. As explained in the text, this\nangle is not periodic (because continued turning will not bring an object to its initial position), but\nfalls within the range of minus to plus infinity.\nFigure 9. A protractor for the abacus model. The angles run from minus to plus infinity; the angle\nmeasure is not periodic. This figure is the analog of a Euclidean wheel (shown at right). \"Turning the\nwheel\" in the abacus model means translating the vertical scale rigidly along itself; this corresponds\nto a rotation. Different from the Euclidean wheel, which repeats its attitude after a full turn, the\nnon-Euclidean wheel cannot turn around. This geometry is in many respects similar to Euclidean\ngeometry. However, the differences are crucial.\nPatches of the visual field(17) often occur as pictorial relief in visual awareness--that is to\nsay, as coherent surfaces in pictorial space.(18)\nSurfaces often occur in awareness as the boundaries of coherent (volumetric) regions.\nFor instance, a treetop is such a globular volume. Such surfaces occur as \"smooth\" on some\nlevel of detail, but typically (like the treetop) will show up additional detail that appears\n(17)Notice that we do not differentiate between the visual field and the picture plane in this paper. We\nwould be more careful in an extensive discussion.\n(18)For the geometer such surfaces are technically known as \"cross-sections\" of the fiber bundle.\nas \"roughness\" in the next finer resolution, and perhaps disperse in a flock of subobjects\n(leaves and twigs) on an even finer level of resolution. Such boundaries are two dimensional\nand therefore match the dimension of the visual field. They usually act as proxies for the\nvolumetric regions themselves, since many pictorial objects are opaque.(19)\nTechnically, a pictorial relief in terms of the abacus model is a surface that meets every\nwire only once. If such a surface is not planar, then one may attempt to assign it a \"shape\".\nThe shape should be invariant with respect to proper movements--that is, transformations\nwith unit (that is, no) scaling but arbitrary translation and rotation.\nReliefs are typically patches of limited extent. If the reliefs are boundaries of volumetric\nobjects, then the relief boundary can be of two categorically different types. One is a \"contour\",\nwhich is the projection of a \"rim\". A rim is a locus of points where the tangent planes have\ninfinite slope. Such tangent planes are degenerate in the abacus model; you cannot even\nproduce them on a physical abacus. For smoothly bounded volumetric regions the rim is a\nsmooth, closed, twisted space curve. (See Figure 10, where the rim is planar.)\nFigure 10. The simplest example of a contour. The plane at the bottom is the picture plane; depth\nruns upwards. For clarity, most of the wires of the abacus model have been omitted. Only half of the\norange surface of a globular volume is visible. The projection of the visible region in the picture plane\nis bounded by the yellow curve. This is the contour. It is the projection of the red curve--the boundary\nof the visible part of the surface, called the rim. The right figure is simply a rotated version of the left\nfigure: the rim is different; the contour is identical. In these figures the \"invisible part\" has been partly\nomitted. It is not \"optically specified\", but is present in awareness, especially near the rim: it becomes\ngradually more uncertain the farther it is removed from the rim. \"Present in awareness\" means that\nthe observer (prereflectively) entertains certain expectations. This can be demonstrated--in the case\nof vision-in-the-world--by rotating the object in physical space, thus revealing previously hidden\nparts. When expectations fail to meet, the observer will show surprise, thus revealing the presence of\nthe expectation.\nThe contour is a curve that may contain self-intersections and cusps. The contour as\nprojection of the rim is somewhat of an \"ideal\" object, in that not all parts of it are necessarily\nvisible (Koenderink and van Doorn 1982).\nThe other type of boundary is an \"occlusion boundary\". It happens where another object\noccludes the fiducial one. In a sense the occlusion boundary does not belong to the fiducial\nobject, and in visual awareness the fiducial object is represented as passing behind the\noccluder. These simple cases are slightly complicated through the possible existence of self-\nocclusions. Occlusions proper and self-occlusions imply that the visible contour is limited\n(19) Such regions may be called \"amodal\" in the sense that they are somehow \"posed\" by the microgeny,\nbut are not represented at all in the optical structure. One is always aware of the backsides of objects\n(they are \"real\" in some sense). This can even be shown experimentally (van Lier and Wagemans 1999).\n552 J J Koenderink, A J van Doorn, J Wagemans\nto only part of the projection of the rim. Visibility toggles at \"T-junctions\" and cusp points\nFigure 11. The simplest example of a T-junction. The plane at bottom is the picture plane, depth\nruns upwards.

The projections of the visible region in the picture plane\nhave been colored brownish and greenish. In this case one of the surfaces is partly occluded by the\nother. Thus the brown region is bounded by contour alone, whereas the green region is bounded\npartly by its contour, partly by the occluding contour, which is the contour of the other surface. The\nsingle depth direction that has been drawn is tangent to both surfaces. Its projection is a so-called\n\"T-junction\".\nFigure 12. The \"ending\" contour. The plane at bottom is the picture plane; depth runs upwards. For\nclarity, the wires of the abacus model have been omitted. Only part of the greenish, checkered surface\nis visible because it \"folds over itself\". The rim is a piecewise smooth curve. In this case its projection\nin the picture plane has a sharp \"cusp\". Only one branch of the cusp is visible, the other branch being\noccluded by the surface itself. Thus one sees a contour that ends at the red point; the projection of the\npoint on the surface that marks the end of the pleat.\nIn the interior of a pictorial relief the depth is defined at any point; thus one has a\ncontinuous depth field. In visual awareness this is the essence of \"surfaceness\"--smooth\nsurfaces and smooth depth fields being one and the same. This increases the number of\nlocal, depth-related quantities that may--in principle--be addressed via psychophysical\nmethods. The most important ones are local depth proper, the spatial attitude of the local\ntangent plane, and the local shape.\nIn the simplest case one studies the shape in the immediate neighborhood of a point--\nthis is conventionally known as its curvature. The simplest way to do this is to apply a\ntransformation that rotates the local tangent plane so as to be fronto-parallel. You may also\napply a translation, both in depth and in the picture plane, to move the point to the (arbitrarily\nassigned) origin. Near the origin you study the shape of the curves of equal depth (Koenderink\nand van Doorn 1998b; Figure 13). Generically, these will be either concentric ellipses or\nconcentric hyperbolae, corresponding to elliptic (convex or concave) and hyperbolic (saddle\nshaped) surface curvature. These quadrics are known as \"indicatrices of Dupin\" (Koenderink\n1990) and geometrically specify the local curvature.(20) The indicatrix of Dupin has the shape\nof the \"wound\" inflicted to a region if you cut its surface with the blade held parallel to\nthe tangent plane at the fiducial point. For instance, cutting chips off a sphere produces all\ncircular wounds, illustrating the fact that the spherical surface is curved identically in all\nFigure 13. (a) At left a relief in the abacus model. At center the curves of equal depth in the picture\nplane. Suppose the red point is currently of interest: at right we show the level curves of depth in the\nimmediate neighborhood of the point. Notice that the point is \"located on a slope\". (b) This continues\nthe situation illustrated in (a). We applied a depth motion such that the tangent plane of the fiducial\npoint becomes fronto-parallel. At left the rotated relief in the abacus model. At center the curves of\nequal depth in the picture plane. Remember that the red point is currently of interest. At right we\nshow the level curves of depth in the immediate neighborhood of the point. Notice that the point is\nno longer located on a slope. It has turned into an extremum of depth. The level curves have become\nmore or less concentric ellipses (the \"indicatrix of Dupin\" at the fiducial point), whose sizes and\nshapes represent the local curvature at this point. Generically one obtains either ellipses (like here),\nrepresenting convexities or concavities, or hyperbolae (saddle shapes).\n3 Geodesy in pictorial space\n(20)To be more precise: for a given depth value the numerical curvature is inversely proportional to\nthe diameter of the indicatrix in the direction of curvature. The directions of principal curvature are\nthe axes of the indicatrix. From this one easily obtains the \"shape index\" (Koenderink and van Doorn\n554 J J Koenderink, A J van Doorn, J Wagemans\nHow to practice geodesy in pictorial space? This is obviously an important topic in visual\npsychophysics. It is also a very elusive one because pictorial space is a mental entity. You\ncannot introduce the familiar tools of the geometer--such as yardsticks, carpenter's squares,\ncalipers, or what have you--into this space. In fact, you cannot introduce anything physical\ninto pictorial space, you can introduce only pictorial objects--that are mental entities--into\npictorial space.\nFortunately, it turns out to be quite easy to put pictorial objects into pictorial space. You\nsimply superimpose the picture of the object over the fiducial picture. If the picture of the\nobject is much smaller than the fiducial picture, then the object will be sucked into the\npictorial space evoked by the latter until it hits the nearest obstacle, to which it attaches\nitself. This is a matter of common observation. For instance, if you draw a black blotch on\nthe poster of some person, it will attach to the pictorial person. Examples include beauty\nspots on cheeks, black teeth, moustaches, and so forth on the pictorial faces of politicians\nand movie stars. If you are a city dweller, you will be only too familiar with this. The trick is\nsimply to put the blotch at roughly the suitable place in the picture plane. A little practice\nwill soon give you a feel for the basics. The actual structure of the mark is hardly important,\nas a little exercise on a portrait of your most-hated politician will soon teach you.\nOnce you are able to put whatever you fancy into pictorial space, the gate is opened\nwidely to a variety of geodesic methods. We will discuss a few in this section, though rather\ncursorily, since the main thrust of this paper is to discuss the essential differences between\nsuch methods, especially of methods that all purport a single geometrical property--say\ndepth. This is--or at least it should be--a major issue in psychology because if one depth is\nontologically distinct from the next one, then the difference should not be the cause of mere\ncontroversy but should give rise to attempts at integration and improved understanding.\nPerhaps unfortunately, this is still a distant target.\n3.1 Varieties of geodesy\nWhat can be measured at all, and what might be viable methods of praxis of geodesy in\npictorial space? In this subsection we take a quick look at both issues.\n3.1.1 What can be measured?. One way to arrive at a toolbox is to consider geometrical enti-\nties of various dimension, as well as their interrelations. In pictorial space one distinguishes\npoints, curves (lines, orbits), surfaces (planes, reliefs), and volumetric regions (solid shapes).\nPoints are characterized by depth; the simplest geometrically relevant entity is the special\ndistance. When points are close their depth difference may be of interest. Lines have slants\nand curves have changing slants--that is, curvature. Slants may be changed by rotations,\nwhereas curvatures are invariant. The incidence of a point and a line or curve is nongeneric,\nthus remarkable. Planes and reliefs have spatial attitudes that may be changed by rotations;\nreliefs have invariant \"curvature landscapes\". The incidence of reliefs with points or curves is\nnongeneric, thus remarkable. Curves generically intersect reliefs in points, and two reliefs\ngenerically intersect in a curve. Volumes of limited size may or may not contain certain\npoints, and so forth. This yields a rich set of possible relations to explore. Any of these is a\npotential target for research. We have been able to sample only a few instances thus far.\nAn important distinction is between submanifolds, which are smooth curves or surfaces,\nand configurations of discrete elements, such as sets of mutually independent points or\nplanes. In the case of submanifolds one meets with important constraints. For instance, if\nyou sample local surface attitude (eg, slant and tilt) along some closed curve on the surface,\nthen you should arrive at the same attitude after traversing the full curve. Such \"surface\nintegrability conditions\" play an important role in the formal theories of cues such as shape\nfrom shading. Moreover, the continuity allows such basic operations as smoothing and\ninterpolation, which are very important in the statistical analysis of empirical data. In the\ncase of discrete configurations you may also meet constraints, but only if you measure more\nparameters than are needed to specify the configuration. The latter condition is common\nenough, though. For instance, if you measure the depth relation (closer or more remote?)\nfor all point pairs in a point configuration, you sample many more responses than there are\ndepths. Geometrical constraints are very valuable in permitting a check on the consistency\nof empirical data; thus they play an important, often crucial, role in the analysis.\nHow to measure? There are numerous possibilities, although these possibilities have\nremained largely unexplored.\nMethods may be distinguished in a variety of ways. One is whether the method addresses\nlocal or multilocal properties. Notice that \"local\" may involve more structured entities than\nmere location; think of the spatial attitude of tangent planes or curvature, for instance.\nAnother, important, distinction is whether the \"probes\" applied to the picture merely indicate\nspatial presence or mimic some geometrical structure, allowing a nontrivial notion of \"fit\".\nIn this section we offer some examples of the various possibilities, though by no means\nexhaustively so.\nOne of the simplest methods is based on the pairwise comparison of entities. For instance,\ngiven two points, one may ask which one is closer (van Doorn et al 2011). This technique\nmay be almost arbitrarily articulated. For instance, one may ask whether a given point lies\nin front or behind the plane implied by a triple of other points, and so forth. The simple\ncomparison judgment is subject to enormous variation. It includes (important) judgments\nof incidence. Any of these methods depends on only the identification of points. They can be\nimplemented by putting simple marks (say colored dots) on the picture plane. These dots\nsimply serve to indicate a location--there is no notion of \"fit\".\nAnother generic method is that of fitting a \"gauge figure\". The idea is simply that in order\nto measure something (anything!), you compare it with a standard. For instance, you measure\nthe length of a body by putting a yardstick next to it, you measure the weight by comparing\nit with a standard weight using scales, you grade grains by means of sieves, and so forth. In\nall such cases the observer merely has to judge the fit of a pictorial entity with respect to\nsome \"gauge object\".(21) For such methods you need to overlay a picture of the gauge object\nover the fiducial picture. In many cases you will need to grant the observer control over the\npicture of the gauge figure. A simple example involves an elliptical gauge figure to measure\nthe spatial attitude of a planar patch of relief (or the tangent plane at a point of a pictorial\nrelief; Koenderink et al 1995). Here the task is to judge whether the gauge figure appears as a\n\"circle painted on the pictorial surface in pictorial space\" (Figure 14). This samples surface\nattitude, usually parameterized by the slant and tilt angles. Notice that this parameterization\nis fully irrelevant in the actual perceptual judgment. The observer need not even be familiar\nwith these parameters. A fit is a fit when it looks like one, and that is all there is to it. When\na fit is established, the result of the measurement is taken to be the current gauge in some\nparameterization. This is simply an operational definition. This is how the ancients measured\nthe weights of things, although they were sorely lacking a reasonable theory of gravitation or\nmass. It is not essentially different in psychophysics.\nThis general technique of judging the fit of some gauge object is capable of almost\nboundless variation and can be used to measure a large variety of geometrical properties.\n(21)The method of fit is familiar to physicists: It has been the major method of quantification in\nclassical physics. It is often misunderstood in cognitive science, though. One speculates that the\nobserver judges both the object to be measured and the gauge figure separately, and subsequently\njudges whether these two partial judgments agree. The idea ultimately derives from the (mistaken)\nnotion that everything mental has to be cognitive. This again leads to attempts to calibrate the gauge\nfigure by some independent method. From the perspective of the physicist this is nonsensical.\n556 J J Koenderink, A J van Doorn, J Wagemans\nFigure 14. Portrait of an angel by Albrecht D\u00fcrer (completed 1506) with superimposed gauge figure.\nThis particular gauge figure is made up of the picture (in orthographic projection) of a circle with an\n\"axle\" sticking out at right angles from the plane of the circle. The axle has the same length as the radius\nof the circle. The task is to make the picture of the circle, which is elliptical due to foreshortening,\nlook like a circle \"painted\" on the surface, in this case the angel's cheek. If the observer is satisfied, the\nspatial attitude of the gauge figure is taken as a sample of the tangent plane of the relief (the cheek)\nlocated at the center of the gauge figure.\nYet another method involves multilocal properties (notice that the gauge figure methods\nare essentially local). One introduces objects at two or more distinct locations and lets the\nobserver judge (or adjust) a multilocal fit. A simple example involves pointing from one point\nto another, obviously an important operation in practical geodesy. In this case one overlays a\npicture of a pointer on one location and a picture of a target on the other (Figure 15). The\nobserver then adjusts the picture of the pointer so as to \"point from one point to the other\"\nin pictorial space (Wagemans et al 2011). That this should be possible is evident from the\nfact that one easily follows visual directions of pictorial persons. For instance, in paintings by\nPeter Paul Rubens the pattern of \"who looks at whom\" in sizable groups of persons tends\nto be very well established. It was an important part of the mature baroque style (Andersen\nAnother example of a multilocal method deploys \"depth cues\" such as relative size or\natmospherical perspective. One simply superimposes a circular blob (say) over each location\nand lets the observer adjust either relative size or relative color such that the blobs (they tend\nto look like \"spheres\") look \"the same\" in pictorial space (Figure 16; van Doorn et al 2011).\nThese methods are also capable of considerable variation and development.\nFigure 15. A scene from Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West (a well-known movie from 1968),\nwith superimposed target and pointer. (In an actual application these superimposed objects will be\nsmaller.) The observer controls the spatial attitude of the pointer and is supposed to make it \"look as if\nit points at the target in pictorial space\". When the observer is satisfied, the attitude of the pointer is\ntaken as the direction in pictorial space from the location of the pointer to that of the target.\n4 Some empirical results\n4.1 Relation between various differential depth orders\nIn the case of depth reliefs one has a variety of possible geometrical entities at one's disposal\nthat might be sampled empirically. For instance, consider\n\u00b7 sampling the depth order for pairs of points on the surface;\n\u00b7 sampling the spatial attitude of the local tangent planes;\n\u00b7 sampling the local curvatures.\nIn these cases one measures different properties of the same surface;(22) thus the resulting\ndata are expected to stand in certain relations to each other. Of course, the empirical relations\nare likely to be predictable from the formal, geometrical relations.\nIf the depth of all surface points is known (a \"depth field\") up to a common offset, then\nthe surface attitude can be calculated through spatial differentiation. Conversely, if the\nspatial attitude is known throughout (a \"surface attitude field\"), then the depth field can be\ncalculated by integration. There is a possible hitch, though. An arbitrary field of attitudes\nneed not be integrable (need not be a \"gradient field\"). This is up to empirical verification. If\nintegrability fails, then no consistent pictorial relief can be said to exist.(23)\nSimilar considerations apply to the relations between depths, attitudes, and curvatures.\nIt is a priori unclear in what way--if any--surfaces are represented in visual awareness.\nThis issue can be addressed empirically. For instance, if the depth field can be predicted from\nthe attitude field, but not vice versa, then this is an indication that not depths per se, but\nrather attitudes are represented.\n(22)Formally, this involves the various orders of differential description. Depth is the zeroth order,\nattitude the first order, curvature the second order, and so forth.\n(23)Notice that this would count as a valuable empirical result.\n558 J J Koenderink, A J van Doorn, J Wagemans\n!\nFigure 16. A capriccio (imaginary landscape) by Francesco Guardi (1712\u00ad93) with two yellow blobs\nsuperimposed on it (copy by Anne-Sophie Bonno; see http://www.atelier-bonno.fr/galerie-copies-\narts-graphiques.html). Notice that they tend to look like spheres in pictorial space. The task is to adjust\ntheir relative size so as to make them \"look the same size in pictorial space\". If the observer is satisfied,\nwe take the logarithm of the size ratio as a measure of the depth difference between the locations\nidentified by the blobs.\nIn one study we found that attitudes are represented more precisely than depths and\nthat the attitude field is a gradient field (Koenderink et al 1992, 1996). We are still uncertain\nwhether curvatures might take priority over attitudes, which remains certainly a possibility.\nIf one samples depth priority for nearby locations, one finds results that can be predicted\nfrom attitude samples. When the points are located far from each other, one might expect\ntheir depth priority to be predictable via integration of the attitude field. We find empirically\nthat such is not the case, though. It works in case the points are located on a single slope, but\nit fails if there runs a depth ridge, or rut, inbetween them (Koenderink and van Doorn 1995).\nWe conclude that observers have no immediate access to the integrated attitude field at all.\nNotice that this would be the global depth field. This is the case even though the depth field\nwas obtained from the observer's own responses, which is perhaps surprising. Such findings\nrather immediately address the geometrical structure of visual awareness.\nRelations such as these are very intricate, and science is still far removed from a\ncomprehensive understanding of them. Even so, such an understanding must be considered\nto be of paramount importance to our understanding of pictorial vision.\n4.2 Comparison of operationally defined depths\nThe simplest depth scale is ordinal. One distributes a number of points over the pictorial\nscene and collects pairwise depth ranking judgments. For a reasonable number of points\n(roughly fewer than 50) one may let the observer judge all (orderless) pairs within an hour or\nso.(24) For coherent pictures (we tried a classical landscape) one finds that the final ranking\nis coherent,(25) and stable over sessions (van Doorn et al 2011). The resulting rank order\ntypically (over a number of observers) has about 40 distinctly different levels. Thus observers\nnotice quite an articulate depth structure in such a landscape picture.\n(24)The time limit is important because observers tend to apply different transformations (rotations\nand scalings) from day to day.\nIn a method of relative size comparison the observer has a more complicated task.\nOne again tests on pairs of locations, each trial involving the adjustment of relative size\nof probes. We find that a session may comprise about 20 locations, implying 190 adjustments\n(van Doorn et al 2011). Again, we find a consistent structure,(26) both within and over sessions.\nFinally, in a pointing task the observer has the even more complicated task, involving two\ndegrees of freedom, of pointing a pointer to a target. In this case one can use only fewer than\n10 locations (we used 5, involving 20 trials). In all cases one points once either way, because\nit turns out to be the case that the observer \"points by arcs\" rather than straight lines. The\nresult is again consistent within (27) and over sessions (Wagemans et al 2011).\nThe latter two methods yield numerical scales, the former one only an ordinal scale. We\nfind that the rank correlation between all methods is very high, and the same is found for the\nPearson correlation coefficient between the numerical scales; this is the case for all observers.\nWe do find high correlations between observers--apparently they all use more or less the\nsame cues--but very significant differences between the depth ranges obtained with the\nlatter two methods (van Doorn et al 2011). On first blush this appears surprising, given the\nfact that all observers appear to resolve a similar number of distinct depth levels.\nConsider the relative size method. What we did was to take the natural logarithm of\nthe size ratio adjusted by the observer as a measure of the depth difference between the\ntwo fiducial locations. The rationale for this choice is simple enough. When you scale\nboth probes by the same factor, the depth difference of the corresponding locations is\nnot supposed to change. Hence the depth difference may depend upon only the ratio of\nthe sizes. Moreover, the depth differences should combine additively, whereas size ratios\ncombine multiplicatively. Hence one should consider the logarithm of the ratio. The base of\nthe logarithm is arbitrary, and thus one obtains the depth up to some unknown factor (the\nsame for all observers), and an arbitrary offset. The latter is irrelevant--we arbitrarily set the\naverage of the depths obtained over the session to zero.\nNotice that the depth scale obtained in this way is unrelated to the dimensions as\nmeasured in the picture plane. This is fine, because the proper depth motions of pictorial\nspace conserve the visual directions; thus there is no principled way to compare the\nmagnitude of distance in the picture plane and depth. What one may do is find the slant\nof the line that connects the points in pictorial space. It is the depth difference divided by\nthe distance of the points in the picture plane. This slant is subject to the relief ambiguity\ndescribed by Adolf Hildebrand. All slants are ambiguous because they may be arbitrarily\nscaled with a common factor. The total depth range is subject to the same ambiguity. Since\nthe common factor must be assumed to be essentially idiosyncratic, this is not necessarily at\nodds with the fact that all observers resolve similar numbers of depth levels.\nThe relative size cue has nothing to do with any \"ratio of ranges\"--after all, the eye is\nnot even in pictorial space. The observer somehow uses the size cue \"smaller is farther\naway\", even in the absence of a clear \"distance from the eye\". It seems a priori likely that this\nwill be highly dependent upon the particular style of the picture. For instance, in Persian\nminiatures--where the size\u00adrange relation is apparently ignored, and the major depth cues\nare height in the picture plane and overlap--things might well be expected to work out quite\ndifferently. There lies a vast field of enquiry open here.\nNext consider the pointing method. It differs essentially from the relative size method in\nthe respect that the measure of distance of the points in the picture plane does matter. In\n(27)This is not trivial. One accounts for twenty (5\u00d7[5-1]) settings in terms of four (5-1) degrees of\nfreedom.\n560 J J Koenderink, A J van Doorn, J Wagemans\nthis case one measures the depth difference between two locations in terms of their mutual\ndistance in the picture plane. If one abstracts from the fact that the two-way pointings yield\nslightly different results, (28) then the depth difference is simply the distance in the picture\nplane times the slant adjusted by the observer. (29) This slant is defined as the tangent of the\nEuclidean slant angle used in the computer graphics generation of the picture of the pointer.\nNotice that this is intuitively reasonable in view of the definition of the non-Euclidean slant\nin pictorial space. Whereas the Euclidean slant angle is in the range of minus to plus ninety\ndegrees (positive meaning away from the observer), its non-Euclidean analog ranges from\nminus to plus infinity. The tangent is just a number, whereas one measures distances in\nthe picture plane in pixels, visual angle, or centimeters--they have units. Then the depth\ndifference will also be expressed in pixels, visual angle, or centimeters.\nDoes this mean anything?\nYes and no. In one possible view the result is again subject to Adolf Hildebrand's relief\nscalings. Thus one draws similar conclusions as in the case of the relative size probe. The\nresults of both methods may be normalized by dividing by the total range or depth standard\ndeviation before comparison. When one does so, the results are almost indistinguishable.\nHowever, another view is possible in which one puts more value on the habitus of the\npointer as a function of its slant.\nThe picture of the pointer is constructed via standard computer graphics. It is the\northographic projection of a three-dimensional arrow. The shaft and head of the arrow\nhave been dimensioned in such a way that small variations in slant are readily apparent in\nany spatial attitude of the pointer. When looking at the arrow in various attitudes, one can\nroughly estimate its slant angle in degrees. In doing this one of course has to assign a depth\nscale. It seems likely that one does this on the basis of the implicit assumption (which is\ncorrect) that the arrow is a rotational symmetric body in Euclidean three-dimensional space,\nseen in orthographic projection. When the image of the pointer is superimposed over the\nfiducial image, the arrow is perceived as a pictorial object in the pictorial space of the fiducial\npicture (a classical landscape). One may still look at the pointer and readily estimate its slant\nangle in degrees.\nDoes this imply that observers setting different slant angles experience different depth\ndifferences? It seems to us that one may take this as an operational definition that this is the\ncase. Accepting this implies that the experienced depth range is independent of the depth\nresolution. One might say, then, that the pictorial depth calibration is a form of mental paint.\n5 Depth and range\nIn this paper we have developed the topic of geodesy in pictorial space without any reference\nto the structure of physical space. We believe this to be the proper procedure, because a\npicture (in terms of its structural complexity) in no way depends upon any physical space.\nHere Maurice Denis's (1890) manifesto (my translation), is very appropriate:\nRemember that a painting--before being a battle horse, a nude woman, or\nsome anecdote--is essentially a planar surface covered with colors in a certain\narrangement.\nThis is trivially obvious in the case of Mondrian's later paintings, but to many people it\nis rather less obvious in the case of \"realistic paintings\" or even photographs. Visual artists\nunderstand Denis's statement very well, though, especially painters. The painter's craft is to\n(28)It can be shown that this problem is easily resolved by using the average slope of the two empirically\ndetermined slants.\n(29)The tilts are simply discarded in this calculation as they involve only the picture plane per se.\napply pigments on a planar carrier in such a way as to trick their potential customers to build\ncertain constrained hallucinations in their visual awareness. The planar arrangement is in\nno way superseded by these, though.\nThe \"composition\" has an important effect. That is explicit to the artist although it remains\nlargely implicit to the naive observer. One might say that the observer is being brainwashed\nby the artist. We mean this quite literally.(30) This is--in principle--not different from what\nhappens in musical composition.\nIn the context of vision-in-the-world the relation between the space in awareness, and\nthe physical space that contains the observer is of importance, of course. It then makes sense\nto look for possible correlations between properties of depth and those of range.\nFor the restricted setting of the static, monocular observer--only eye movements, no\nmotion in the environment--the case is not that different from that of pictorial vision, the\nmain difference being that \"ground truth\" is overwhelmingly present.\nFor this restricted case one may deduce the possible structure of visual space from first\nprinciples (Koenderink and van Doorn 2008). One predicts that depth is correlated with\nthe logarithm of range and that the structure of visual space must admit a certain group of\nsimilarities that is essentially the same as we deduced above on phenomenological grounds.\nThe exploration of the empirical structure of this visual space is far from completed yet. This\nposes a rich field of endeavor in its own right.\n6 Conclusions\nPictorial vision is a niche area of vision research that remains relatively unexplored, either\ntheoretically or empirically. This is the case despite the fact that this apparently limited setting\noccurs very frequently in our current society. Just think of the evacuation plans the airlines\nare legally forced to bring to your attention at the beginning of their flights. A considerable\npart of communication and teaching still depends heavily on material presented as still\npictures. Moreover, much of our historical documents come as either texts or still pictures.\nThere is no way technology might change this, for in the medieval authors simply had neither\nstereoscopes nor video. Thus a thorough understanding of pictorial vision, its dependence\non the pictorial material, and the differences between members of the general population\n(perhaps graded with respect to age and gender) should be of considerable interest.\nUnfortunately, the understanding of pictorial vision is typically regarded as a rather\nimmediate derivative of the--immensely more important--understanding of vision-in-\nthe-world. This is a consequence of the understanding of pictures as being essentially\nwindows on some physical space. Such a view introduces the observer into the picture,\nthus converting the viewing of a picture as a limited instance of vision-in-the-world. For\ninstance, the experiential quality depth is interpreted as the physical range. That is to say,\none understands \"veridical vision\" as implying an intimate correlation between depth and\nrange. In our view this is nonsensical, because of the ontological chasm between these\nconcepts. Moreover, the normative emphasis is anthropocentric and clashes with a biological\n(thus evolutionary) account. However that may be, the fact remains that pictorial vision is a\nworthwhile field of scientific endeavor in its own right.\n(30)We know this may sound odd, but artists understand it very well. As one of many examples\nremember the famous dictions by Edgar Degas:\nA picture is something which requires as much knavery, trickery, and deceit as the\nperpetration of a crime. Make it untrue and add an accent of truth ... Even working\nfrom nature you have to compose ... Drawing is not what you see but what you must\nmake others see.\n562 J J Koenderink, A J van Doorn, J Wagemans\nWe have shown how a formal theory of depth can be developed through pure phenomeno-\nlogical deduction. We have also indicated how one may design and implement methods of\ngeodesy that can be applied in the empirical investigation of structures in pictorial space.\nSuch methods have hardly been explored in any detail thus far. There is ample room for\nfurther development.\nPerhaps not unexpectedly, it is fair to say that a great many open problems remain,\nespecially of a conceptual nature. Pictorial vision is quite different from vision-in-the-world\nbecause the conventional perception\u00adaction cycle does not apply to it. Thus the definition of\nvision as \"optically guided behavior\", which is quite acceptable to much of the mainstream,\nfails to apply too. It has to be changed into \"optically constrained awareness\", which lifts it\non a different ontological level. The study of pictorial vision has to rely on phenomenological\nmethods, rather than physiological or \"hard-core\" psychological ones.(31)\n"
