    "abstract": "Abstract\nEvidence does not support the use of restraint and seclusion (RS) to contain patients on psychiatric inpatient units, yet these\npractices continue to be used and defended. Use of RS often results in serious injuries to patients and psychiatric health care\nworkers. Media exposure and legal challenges have led to negative opinions about RS but not their elimination. Substance\nAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration set a firm goal to permanently eliminate the use of RS, emphasizing\nthat such practices are non-therapeutic. There is agreement that prevention is central to eliminating RS. The aims of this\ngrounded theory study were to understand the contextual processes in preventing RS and the facilitators and barriers to\nprevention practice. Barriers include lack of resources at the micro-level, mismanaged messages at the institutional level, and,\nat the policy level, belief that all simply need a \"change of heart.\" Participants in this study did not think that they had adequate\nstaffing, facilities, or education to prevent RS. Most were unaware of RS prevention policies.\n",

Persons exposed to these prac-\ntices express a range of negative responses from terror or\nrage, to feeling stripped of their humanity and overpowered\ndence that the use of restraint and seclusion (RS) offers an\neffective treatment strategy for psychiatric health care work-\ners to manage persons hospitalized with severe mental ill-\nness (Muralidharan & Fenton, 2006). Sailas and Fenton\n(2012) conclude that no recommendation can be made about\nthe effectiveness, benefit, or harmfulness of RS use based on\nrandomized controlled studies, and the use of RS should be\nminimized because narrative studies have described adverse\nphysical and psychological harm to patients and staff.\nFatalities and serious injuries to patients and nursing staff\ncontinue to be attributed to the ongoing use of RS (Ferreira,\neconomic costs associated with RS are sizable and have not\nbeen adequately measured.\nLiterature Review\nDefinitions of RS use are imprecise and how interventions are\ntranslated into practice is not universally understood. Some\nclassify RS as treatment failure, whereas others view RS as\neffective tools for averting injuries during crises and emer-\ngency situations (Geller & Glazer, 2012). These practices\ninclude various physical holds, leather straps, bed nets,\nrestraint beds, and isolation rooms. The Centers for Medicare\nand Medicaid Services (2006) define restraint as \"any man-\nual method, physical or mechanical device, material, or\nequipment that immobilizes or reduces the ability of a patient\nto move his or her arms, legs, body, or head freely\" and\nseclusion as the \"involuntary confinement of a patient alone\nin a room or area which the patient is physically prevented\nIt was estimated that the U.S. Mental Health System\nspends more than US$375 million yearly on the conse-\nquences of conflict and containment on inpatient psychiatric\nsettings (Flood, Bowers, & Parkin, 2008). As the cost of psy-\nchiatric care has shifted largely from the states to the jointly\nfunded federal-state governmental program of Medicaid, the\ndistribution of quality psychiatric care and inpatient work\nenvironments has not been adequately tracked or evaluated\n(Hanrahan, Aiken, McClaine, & Hanlon, 2010).

Hall1\n Keywords\nmental health nursing, psychiatry, Bourdieu, work environment, trauma, violence\n2 SAGE Open\nhypothesized that the use of RS originates in the wider, more\nglobal systemic problems of psychiatric care, finance, and\ntreatment. Despite widespread interest in the phenomenon,\nknowledge deficits related to processes that produce change\nor reductions in RS use remain static. Translation of best\npractice has been slow, complicated by the complex and\nuncontrollable environmental variables inherent in RS use\non inpatient psychiatric units (Johnson, 2010). Public poli-\ncies play a critical, but often overlooked role in improving\nbedside practices and fidelity of public health interventions\nthat lead to improved outcomes across all health care treat-\nment settings (Mirvis, 2009). Ideally, inpatient psychiatric\nsettings provide a safe, structured environment, and nursing\ncare around the clock for persons who are in need of this\nViolence in health care is a serious international chal-\nlenge, and in mental health settings violence is considered\nas \"the portal\" to RS use, while, conversely, RS use contrib-\nutes to workplace violence. This tri-directional cycle of vio-\nlence occurs on the individual (practice), institutional\n(management), and regulatory (public policy) levels. Krug,\nMercy, Dahlberg, and Zwi (2002) argue that violence pre-\nvention is within the realm of public health, not only because\nof the enormous effect violence has on health and health care\nservices but also due to the roles public policy and regulation\ncan play in mitigating the consequences. Social values influ-\nencing whether interpersonal violence is endorsed or frowned\nupon are expressed in the social and economic policies that\npreserve socioeconomic inequality and cultural norms, such\nas those associated with male dominance over women,\nparental dominance over children, and the acceptance of vio-\nlence as a way to deal with conflict. For all types of violence,\nprevention efforts need to be tailored to social, cultural, and\neconomic contexts (Krug et al., 2002). Institutional values\nplay a key role in the ways in which psychiatric health care\nworkers and patients treat one another interpersonally, and\ninfluence the everyday social norms and attitudes of the\ntreatment environment.\nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services\nAdministration (SAMHSA) set a firm goal to permanently\neliminate the use of RS, emphasizing that such practices are\nnon-therapeutic. Findings contained in a SAMHSA (2010)\nmeta-analysis suggest that next step to implementing evi-\ndence-based best practices involves understanding the con-\ntextual factors that contribute to an organization's capacity to\nimplement prevention strategies. More recently, SAMHSA's\nNational Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices\ndetermined that the clinical model called Six Core Strategies\nto Prevent Conflict and Violence: Reducing the Use of\nSeclusion and Restraint scored an overall rating of 2.8 on the\nreadiness for implementation scale, reflecting a value just\nbelow being adequate for dissemination. Reviewers found\nthe availability of implementation materials and availability\nof training and support resources to be lacking (Huckshorn,\n2012). This study contributed to the RS prevention science\nby identifying contextual variables that modulate facilitators\nand barriers to RS prevention practices, and by discovering\nnew gaps in the translation of national policy and evidence-\nbased best practices.\nAims\nThe purpose of this grounded theory method (GTM;\nCharmaz, 2006) study was to understand the complex pro-\ncesses that psychiatric health care workers engage in to pre-\nvent the use of RS within the multidimensional context of the\ninpatient psychiatric unit. For this research, psychiatric\nhealth care workers were defined as registered nurses (RNs),\nlicensed practical nurses (LPNs), nurse managers (NMs),\nmedical doctors (MDs), nurse practitioners (NPs), mental\nhealth counselors (MHCs), administrators (ADMs), activity\ntherapists (ATs), and policy makers (PMs). PMs with exper-\ntise in RS prevention were also included. Exploring pro-\ncesses involved in preventing the use of RS in the\npsychiatrically hospitalized population of the Southeastern\nUnited States from the standpoints of psychiatric health care\nworkers, along with significant gray literature (information\ncontained in government, academic, or business reports that\nlie outside the domains of published books and journals) and\npolicy texts, provided information about a region that is\nmostly overlooked in the literature. Specific aims of this\nGTM study were to\n1. understand contextual processes in preventing RS,\n2. determine how resources are used or not in eliminat-\ning the use of RS,\n3. explore the role of prevention policies, and\n4. describe the facilitators and barriers to prevention\npractice.\nFor the science of RS prevention, SAMHSA (2010) iden-\ntified understanding the contextual factors determining an\norganization's capacity to implement effective strategies as a\ncrucial next step toward elimination.\nMethod\nTheoretical Framework\nThis study was founded on Bourdieu's (1977) critical theory\nof practice. Bourdieu (1977) emphasizes that mastery of the\nsymbolism of social interaction, and the language and actions\nof practical, everyday know-how, occurs through a continu-\nous decoding of the perceived, but not consciously noticed\nrules and structures of everyday life and practice. Bourdieu's\n(1977) dynamic heuristics of practice, habitus, and field\ndirected the development of micro-, meso-, and macro-anal-\nysis. The study involved semi-structured interviews with 21\nparticipants, and a specific grounded theory process used\nCarlson and Hall 3\nHuman Subjects\nPrior to recruitment, the study protocol was approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board at the University of Tennessee,\nKnoxville, TN. Before each interview, elements of informed\nconsent (IC) were explained and the participant's level of\nunderstanding was assessed. After the oral explanation, par-\nticipants read and signed the IC statement and received a\ncopy. Data were collected from September 2011 through\nMarch 2012. There were no adverse events during the study\nrelated to rights of participants in research. Participants'\nidentities were protected and names were altered on all\nresearch data. Researchers and transcribers signed confiden-\ntiality forms.\nData Collection\nThe logic of GTM guided the system of data collection\nknowledge made available and practices engaged in are\n\"made real in collective and individual life\" (p. 514).\nParticipants from various health care professions, psychiatric\nfacilities, and Southeastern states were sought to provide a\nrich data source. Interviews were conducted with ADMs,\nPMs, and frontline psychiatric care providers. Codes and cat-\negories emerged during the data gathering and concurrent\nanalysis processes.\nInterviews\nTime and place were determined by the participant.\nInterviews were conducted in library rooms and other private\nareas, away from the inpatient environment to ensure confi-\ndentiality. Participants were not paid for the interview time\nitself but received a US$25 gift card. All psychiatric health\ncare workers were required to have been employed by a psy-\nchiatric health care facility in the Southeastern United States\nwithin the past 5 years, as the regulations governing the use\nof RS in psychiatric hospitals in the United States were set\nforth by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\n[CFR] Part 482). Participants were asked to fill out a demo-\ngraphic form and a 16-item Life Events Checklist (LEC) fol-\nlowing the interview. Interviews lasted 30 to 120 min and\nwere audio recorded with permission, then transcribed\nverbatim.\nParticipants were asked, \"Tell me about a time when you\nsaw a patient who could potentially be restrained or secluded.\nWhat did you or other staff members do to prevent it?\"\nSubsequent questions and discussion related to the use of\nresources, the awareness of prevention policies, and the\nfacilitators and barriers to prevention practice.\nPolicies and laws at the state and national levels were\nexamined to construct a more accurate account of the phe-\nnomenon and to interpret contextually how policies affect or\ndo not affect practice. Categories of knowledge generated\nfrom the individual (micro), institutional (meso), and organi-\nzational (macro) standpoints were compared. Contrasted,\ndeconstructed, and reconstructed meanings from interview\ndata were also compared with gray literature.\nLEC\nUnderstanding potential traumatizing effects of staff expo-\nsure to RS is critical to prevention practice (Stromberg,\nitems that ask about exposure to 16 different potentially trau-\nmatic events known to produce post-traumatic stress disor-\nder or other post-traumatic problems. The mean kappa\ncoefficient for all LEC items is 0.61, and the retest correla-\ntion at 1 week is r = .82 (Gray, Litz, Hsu, & Lombardo,\n2004). The rationale for LEC use was the importance of trau-\nmatic exposure to RS use and the subsequent psychiatric\nhealth care workers' effectiveness with patients, and the\nassociation between workplace violence and RS use. It was\nadministered after the interviews.\nParticipants\nThe study participants included eight RNs, one LPN, one\nNM, one MD, two NPs, three MHCs, two ADMs, one AT,\nand two PMs. A total of 21 participants were interviewed\nfrom the states of Virginia, North Carolina, Florida,\nTennessee, and the District of Columbia. The majority 81%\nwere from Tennessee. Participants were recruited from com-\nmunity contacts, educational conferences, and professional\norganizations. Flyers were distributed and participants were\ncontacted via phone and email.\nSixteen participants were female and five were male. The\nSeventeen were older than 35 years. One participant was\nAfrican American. This was an educated group with 16 hav-\ning earned at least a baccalaureate. Two had high school\ndiplomas, one had a technical school certification, two had\nassociate's degrees, five had master's degrees, and three held\ndoctorates.\nData Analysis\nPrior research showed that there were differing levels of\nawareness regarding how to successfully prevent and elimi-\nnate RS, and that prevention policies regulating RS use differ\ndrastically among states and facilities. Data gathering and\nanalysis focused on creating a theoretical representation of\nhow psychiatric health care workers prevent and eliminate\nRS from various individual, institutional, and organizational\nstandpoints. As data gathering and analysis continued,\n4 SAGE Open\nquestions about policy and resources emerged. ADMs and\nPMs were recruited. According to Charmaz (2006), GTM\nworks best when the grounded theorist collects and analyzes\nthe data, ensuring that nuances of meaning, structure, and\nprocess are explored concurrently. Data analysis was ongo-\ning with the assistance of the University of Tennessee\n(Knoxville), College of Nursing Grounded Theory Research\nGroup.\nTheoretical sampling at all phases aided clarification of\ncategories and concepts (Charmaz, 2005). After completing\nfive interviews, data were coded and analyzed (Charmaz,\n2006). Participants offering a more diverse account of the\nphenomenon of RS prevention, such as those working in dif-\nferent types of health care organizations, were recruited. This\ndata gathering led to a systematic exploration of RS preven-\ntion policies and how they are implemented by psychiatric\nhealth care workers from several institutions in a locale.\nTheoretical sampling included the use of policy and regu-\nlatory texts, along with interviews of PMs at the state and\nfederal levels. Theoretical sensitivity called for a more\norganic, emergent process of data collection. This heteroge-\nneous sample improved the understanding of process catego-\nries from the individual (micro), institutional (meso), and\norganizational (macro) levels.\nCategories related to RS prevention practice were devel-\noped. Coding included identification of the language of\naction related to the practice of RS prevention. As categories\ndeveloped, focused coding was used to find the broader cat-\negories summarizing detailed processes described by partici-\npants. Many of these practice actions could not be explained\nwithout examining how they fit together with other catego-\nries (Saldana, 2009). The completed theory must give a con-\ncise understanding of a social world, confronting problems\nand processes within it (Charmaz, 2005). Trustworthiness\nimproved via consulting the University of Tennessee\n(Knoxville) Phenomenology Research Group.The University\nof Tennessee (Knoxville) Grounded Theory Research Group\nassisted in the ongoing analysis process and helped deter-\nmine data saturation. Constant comparison was used to\nexplore categories as they related to individual, institutional,\nand organizational levels (Charmaz, 2006).\nAs collection and analysis progressed, policy implications\nat the state and federal levels were explored to interpret how\npolicies affect or do not affect practice. Categories generated\nfrom individual (micro), institutional (meso), and organiza-\ntional (macro) standpoints were developed systematically,\nand formed a theoretical analysis of the phenomenon that fit\nwith Bourdieu's theory of practice (Bourdieu, 1977). NVivo\nqualitative data analysis software, QSR International Pty\nLtd. Version 9, 2010, was used to assist with organizing and\ncoding the transcribed interviews and policy texts, as well as\nestablishing an audit trail. Initial models for theory develop-\nment and concept analysis were prepared using this\nprogram.\nFindings\nFindings are organized at the micro-, meso-, and macro-lev-\nels corresponding to Bourdieu's triune analytics, arranged\nfrom individual, institutional, and organizational\nperspectives.\nMicro\nOn an individual level, facilitators to prevention practice\nincluded personal characteristics such as being respectful,\nstaying calm, and caring about patients. Barriers were con-\nversely identified as being prideful, jumping the gun, and not\nunderstanding mental illness. The individual strengths iden-\ntified by participants related to personal attributes of the staff\nincluded believing that RS prevention and elimination is\npossible, using humor and focusing on self. Individual weak-\nnesses attributed to staff consisted of characteristics such as\nbeing burnt out, lacking patience, having no confidence or\nbeing fearful, and behaviors such as rigidly enforcing rules,\nbeing prideful, exhibiting intolerance, disrespecting patients,\nor insisting on maintaining control.\nKnowing or not knowing what works.The established civil\nrights of psychiatrically hospitalized persons include the\nprinciple that patients have the right to experience the least\nrestrictive means of treatment. On the surface, this concept\nappears straightforward. In practice, \"distinguishing among\nthese interventions on the basis of restrictiveness proves to\nbe a purely subjective exercise fraught with personal bias\"\nblurry, processes determining the least restrictive interven-\ntions are abstruse. The majority of participants answered the\nopening interview question using normalized psychiatric\ntreatment language such as de-escalating, redirecting, dis-\ntracting, talking, removing stimuli, self-regulating, and\nlistening.\nFirst, I try to go and talk to the patient and see what's going on,\nsee what their needs are. Maybe if something's bothering them,\nor just try to talk and listen. If the patient starts to get aggressive,\nthen we have an alarm that we can hit for the other staff to come.\n(Male, MHC)\nParticipants expressed tension between knowing what\nto do to prevent RS yet always being ready to do it. Four\nparticipants stated unprompted that they would not work\nin a facility where the use of RS was not an accepted\noption.\nReading the signs.Almost all participants referred to some\nway of observing or reading changes that signaled the emer-\ngence of a volatile situation, potentially resulting in RS use.\nHowever, not all participants believed that RS prevention\nand elimination is possible.\nCarlson and Hall 5\nParticipants described the signs they look for in patients\nhaving a hard time, cueing staff members that there is poten-\ntial for RS:\nA change, not quite calm, but not yet escalated: a change in tone\nof voice. Maybe they are responding to internal stimuli,\nsometimes they just get a stare, like they are seeing something\nthat is not part of what's there or they see right through me.\nMaybe they have just thrown a hot drink. Pacing, that's a big\none. (Female, RN)\nI'm looking at their facial expressions, their tone of voice,\nlooking at the escalating kind of things that are going on, their\nbody movements, just trying to read them that way. Does it look\nlike they're going to come at me and hit me? Or does it look like\nthey are open to talking? Do I need to come closer or back away?\n(Female, RN)\nKontio et al. (2012) suggest that psychotic behavior is the\nNumber 1 reason RS are used, whether the behavior is\naggressive or not. According to Sadock and Sadock (2007),\nin conditions such as acute schizophrenia, severe agitation\noccurs due to frightening hallucinations and delusions which\nare made more complicated by a sense of paranoia, which in\nturn is made worse when the trauma of RS use is added.\nExhibiting symptoms is a way patients attract attention, let-\nting psychiatric health care workers know that they are strug-\ngling emotionally or losing touch with outside reality.\nOne participant described reading the signs as a form of\ngambling, with knowledge of the patient as the unknown\ncard.\nFor boys who we kind of knew were posturing, we would\nchallenge them. I've got in people's faces and said, \"Go ahead.\nCarry out your threat!\" I was gambling and guessing based on\nmy relationship with them. I'm looking for tension in the\nshoulders, the shoulders hunched up, fists clenched, tone of\nvoice, volume of voice, yelling, the language; are they cursing\nversus are they just kind of speaking more normally or pacing,\nshadow boxing, feet boxing, punching the air, kicking things on\nthe ground, stomping. (Male, MHC)\nParticipants talked about de-escalation training as being\nhelpful. Some had negative reactions to their coworkers use\nof RS, rather than knowingly using skills learned in de-esca-\nlation trainings to prevent RS. Reading the signs also per-\ntained to coworkers who add to the tension in a pre-crisis\nsituation, increasing the probability of RS use occurring with\na patient which eventually leads to more work for the staff.\nTheir [staff] pride gets in the way.And those are the restraints that\nmake me sick, the ones that occur because of staff. (Male, MHC)\nI feel like sometimes it's [RS] used as a punishment. Like,\n[whispers: No one will know what I'm saying right?]. Because\nafterwards it's, \"Ok, they won't mess with us again. They won't\ndo that again\" but you know, \"put them in a bed net and we\nwon't have this problem again.\" So I think it's used as a\npunishment instead of de-escalating a person, which is what the\nintent of it [de-escalation training] is. To keep them safe. To\nkeep us safe. There's a perception that it is less work to do a\nrestraint or seclusion, even though it is a lot of extra paperwork.\n(Female, RN)\nPsychiatric health care workers who are educated to read\nthe signs, with persons who are at risk of becoming aggres-\nsive and know how to prevent RS use, are less apt to become\nvictims of patient assaults (Schwecke, 2007).\nThere was a staff member that got hurt, busted her ear. She\nworked at a prison, and she said, \"If I could have just done this\nhold [demonstrating], I could have stopped everything. It would\nhave worked alright! It wouldn't have involved so many people.\"\nWe can only do approved holds. There was a basket hold and\nthen the one where you grab around, but it just depends on the\nsize of the person. There's a new hold that we're doing where\npatients lay on their back, arms out, and then someone curls\naround the person's thighs. I could not get my arms around a\ngirl's thighs! That hold is just horrible. Plus, your face is right\nthere. It's just--that hold, is just--and the guys have to put their\nknees between the person's elbow [laughs]. But, in the meantime,\nthere's a lot of chaos and these things are hard to do. (Female,\nKnowing how to prevent RS use can be confusing when\nthe emphasis is placed on how to use RS instead. Stromberg\n(2012) suggested that traditional \"de-escalation\" trainings\nare insufficient to change the kind of normative culture of\ncare where the use of RS is commonplace.\nFacing challenging moments without resources. The vast major-\nity, 19 participants, did not feel that they had the resources to\nprevent RS use. Staff shortages, along with a lack of educa-\ntion and time, and feeling de-valued by their institutions\nwere often cited as problems endemic to the workplace. This\nwas described by health care workers as receiving low pay\nand not having the resources to do a good job. The physical\nenvironment, architectural layout, staff time, staffing pat-\nterns, institutional culture, and unit space were found to be\ndeficient.\nThe staff were upset, so the patients pick up on that. No matter\nhow hard they [staff] try to hide it, they [patients] pick up on it,\nand are a bit more on edge. In my case, the layout of the building\nand staff not being able to see me or what was going on was the\nreason the assault happened. It could have been lethal. (Male,\nThis staff person has been hit more than once. I've seen the way\nthis staff has talked to patients and approached patients. Maybe\nthat could have been prevented. I don't think he got enough\ntraining, because his preceptorship lasted just a few days. I\nreally don't think they're [administration] allowing new staff to\nwork with someone long enough. (Female, RN)\n6 SAGE Open\nIf there is a unit that ought to be aesthetically pleasing, positive,\ntherapeutic, it's ours, but it's not. It looks like a broken down\nmotel. (Male, MD)\nSeeing others hurt, experiencing fear.Patients experiencing\nfear are often met by health care workers who are also afraid.\nFear has been identified as a challenging barrier to trans-\nforming psychiatric health care workers'orientations to more\nrecovery-oriented paradigms (Ashcraft & Anthony, 2008).\nAlmost all the participants had seen patients or other staff\nmembers injured during a restraint or seclusion. Seventeen\nparticipants reported on the LEC that they had themselves\nbeen the victim of a physical assault; for example, being\nattacked, hit, slapped, kicked, or beaten up at some point in\ntheir lifetime. Two participants had firsthand knowledge of\npatient deaths from asphyxiation that were the result of using\nsome type of restraint.\nSeveral participants revealed that they had family mem-\nbers who had been hospitalized on psychiatric units and felt\nthat they had a stake in improving the experiences of patients\nand families on these units. However, the lack of knowledge-\nable staff, resources, time, and support from ADMs left these\nparticipants often at odds with their respective institutions\nvalues and priorities when it came to issues of quality of\npatient care and value-based priorities.\nMeso\nFacilitators to RS prevention identified at the institutional\nlevel were meeting people where they are and attending to\nsafety risks. Participants viewed education, leadership,\nadministrative support, and appropriate staffing to be the\nvalue-based priorities that facilitated RS prevention.\nObstacles included the perception of scant resources allo-\ncated to specific RS prevention practices, staff not being lis-\ntened to or included in policy-making processes or\ndecision-making; and fearing loss of employment.\nBeing unaware of prevention policy. More than half, 16 partici-\npants were unaware of any RS prevention policies. All par-\nticipants knew of some policies related to how to use RS, but\nfew had specific knowledge of institutional prevention poli-\ncies. The discussions on policies often centered on policies\nthat were \"passed down\" to psychiatric health care workers\nfrom their administration, or from state and federal PMs.\nFour participants had participated in the creation of preven-\ntion policies.\nThere are the cattle prods of Joint Commission and CMS, cattle\nprods are extremely strong, if you are in administration in a\npsychiatric facility. I will say that our leadership, the\nadministrators of the hospital and other people were all very\nfocused on restraint and seclusion. These were things that were\nrecorded at every leadership meeting, probably monthly. We had\nextensive data. We wanted to be on the cutting edge of every\nnew practice or strategy that could happen. It was an absolutely\nstrong focus at the hospital. Now, whether that translated into\nmuch better results, I don't know right this minute. (Female,\nThe message my staff get from me is that restraints are\nconsidered failure in treatment. So, if you're using restraint,\nthere's a failure in treatment. When we talk about restraints or\nusing restrictive interventions, we talk about what we could\nhave done differently. Could we have maybe got somebody that\nknows the patient better to talk with them beforehand, did the\npatient meet the criteria for seclusion? So why did the patient go\ninto restraint, rather than seclusion? Seclusion is least restrictive.\n(Female, ADM)\nFindings at the meso-level demonstrate that the policy of\nRS elimination originates at the federal level. Material con-\ntained in the Seclusion and Restraint: National Action Plan\n(SAMHSA, 2008) is mismanaged at the intersectional, insti-\ntutional level, while participants described a wide range of\nmisinformation used to justify unclear outcomes. For exam-\nple, ADMs expressed being pushed into compliance by uti-\nlizing data without fully comprehending the contextual\nnuances that underpin prevention practice and demonstrated\nmisunderstandings about the use of the least restrictive inter-\nventions. If policies are not well understood at the institu-\ntional level, implementation on the practice level is near\nimpossible.\nMacro\nAccording to Tovino (2007), high-quality psychiatric health\ncare treatment is not distributed evenly, and problems related\nto access and finance figure prominently. Policy translation\nand implementation are contingent upon what has value to\nthe society at large, the legislative bodies, the regulatory\nagencies, the institutional cultures, and the professional stan-\ndards of those engaged in psychiatric practice. People have\nbetter or worse mental health depending on where they live\nand how their communities are structured and organized\nLeveling the playing field. Federal PMs expressed lofty goals\nand ideals in contrast to frontline psychiatric health care\nworkers. Trauma-informed care was identified as a way to\nrespectfully approach patients and staff to level the playing\nfield.\nSo it has to be trauma informed care for everyone, you know, to\nlevel the playing field. Trauma informed care is really about\nbeing respectful, respectful to everyone including staff. I mean it\nhas to be the direct care staff, you know, that's who needs it most\nin the industry. (Female, PM)\nSeclusion and restraint, first off, are non-evidence-based,\nhistorical interventions that more mimic assault than they do any\nCarlson and Hall 7\nkind of clinical therapy. There is no evidence for it that they\nhave any therapeutic benefit. They generally should only be\nused as safety measures of last resort in the face of imminent\ndanger, but over the last fifty, sixty, seventy years they've\nbecome way overused. They were always fairly unregulated and\nhave caused not only a lot of emotional trauma to both the\npeople being restrained and secluded but also to the staff being\nasked to do it. They've also caused many accidents, serious\ninjuries and a multitude of deaths. (Female, PM)\nBecause as far as private hospitals here, they don't think we\nhave any business in their business. So it's going to be interesting.\nBut with the USDOJ kind of quietly in the background, and the\nfact that these private hospitals are living on Medicaid clients,\nI'm going to try and do it. We're going to fix our regulations this\nnext year. (Female, PM)\nRegulation was identified by one participant as the only\nviable route to RS prevention and elimination. Providing\nhealth care workers with adequate support and resources to\nprevent RS should be a condition for facilities receiving\nMedicare and Medicaid payments.\nBourdieusian Analysis and Core Categories\nBecause the micro- (practice), meso- (habitus), and macro-\n(field) levels were analyzed, three major themes constitute\nthe core categories of the theory (see Figure 1). The follow-\ning analysis is a sequential synthesis of these multilevel\nfindings in more abstract and theoretical terms. These are\ndetailed below. This includes an appraisal of how thoroughly\nfederal policy has influenced the creation of institutional cul-\ntures of RS prevention practice and non-violence in the field\nof practice, which are identified as essential to RS prevention\nideology, and how fully psychiatric health care workers have\nbeen involved in implementing evidence-based best prac-\nIt's Just the Business We Are in\nOn the individual practice level, there are unseen conse-\nquences to the violent encounters experienced by psychiatric\nhealth care workers in environments where the use of RS is\ncommonly practiced. Health care workers distance them-\nselves and react without thinking in response to repeated\nexposure to violent and traumatic events. These workers cre-\nate personal meanings based on an evaluation of the level of\nthreat, harm, or challenge experienced; and, by an evaluation\nof their perceived options and abilities to mitigate the effects\nof the potentially traumatic situation (Van der Kolk, 1996).\nCarlsson, Dahlberg, Lutzen, and Nystrom (2004) suggested\nthat the way the psychiatric health care worker copes with\nand handles his or her sense of fear is a decisive factor in how\na potentially violent encounter will progress. Emotional dis-\nconnection or distancing is a predictable response to pro-\nlonged stress or fears.

Examining these reemerging codes and categories\nrelated to resources such as staffing patterns, time, and space,\nthe in vivo quote, \"It's just the business we are in,\" summed\nup the tensions between and among (a) the belief in and the\nknowledge of the possibility of prevention practice actions\nand (b) the acceptance of structurally defined and objectively\nimposed limitations on prevention practice.\nThe in vivo quote, \"It's just the business we are in,\" points\nto the objective meaning that this business of RS prevention\nhas for participants. The more psychiatric health care work-\ners incorporate the language of economics and the metaphor\nof business, and accept the hegemonic forces of the market,\nthe less time and other resources are perceived to be avail-\nable to make moral decisions about the human beings in their\ncare. The more the business model is emphasized in practice,\nwith a focus on its limited resources, whether it be real or\nperceived, the more psychiatric health care workers think\nthey must act out of necessity, rather than acting out of a\nsense of moral freedom, or duty to care for their patients. The\nfollowing participant quote depicts what it means to be in the\nbusiness we are in:\nWe don't have the space [to prevent RS], and I think\nadministration gets frustrated with that too. You know, dealing\nwith a building that really just, that needs, we need, I mean it's\nawful. It's painfully obvious. I even know that engineering gets\nfrustrated trying to keep up. You know, it's just the business we\nare in, but it takes a lot [money] to get a new building. (Female,\nIn attempting to reconcile, literally and physically, what\ngets in the way of RS prevention practice, this participant\nbrings up the building she works in. Not only does she reveal\nher frustration about the space, she alludes to this lack of\nresource as being \"painfully obvious.\" Looking to the future,\nshe does not have confidence that there will be enough\nresources allocated to fix the dilapidated building in which\nshe works, because it will take a lot of money. Everyone is\nfrustrated trying to keep up with the physical and structural\ndeterioration of the building. The aging, outdated building\ntakes on symbolic meaning and delivers a message that is\nunmistakable. It is asking too much to prevent RS use when\nthe structures around you and your coworkers are decaying.\nFatalistically, she declared, \"It's just the business we are in.\"\nIn other words, it cannot or will not be changed by those in\nhigher positions in the organization.\nMismanaging the Message\nOn the institutional level, definitions of RS are not uniform\nacross psychiatric facilities and ADMs are not well versed in\nthe most up-to-date best practices. Another participant did\nnot believe that there are adequate supplies needed for her to\nengage patients in meaningful activities because she works\nin mental health. Thus, working in mental health means there\nis a natural consequence of going without the resources you\nneed. At this institutional level, RS prevention is not well\nunderstood or valued as a determining factor in creating an\nethic of care. While finances are perceived to be scarce, the\nmessages passed down to frontline workers are confusing\nand paradoxical, especially when it comes to providing\nenough resources to maintain an ethic of care on psychiatric\nunits, including adequate staffing.\nThe business of RS prevention includes the way psychiat-\nric health care workers see RS prevention practice in relation\nto psychiatric patients, the way the message of RS preven-\ntion practice gets managed structurally in institutions, and\nthe way federal-level policy is interpreted. Participants felt\nconstrained by their environments, further limiting their abil-\nity to experience their work or RS prevention as important or\nworthy of investment. Psychiatrically hospitalized people\nand the health care workers caring for them are at the mercy\nof the profits of market forces, which ultimately determine\nhow RS prevention or use is practiced. Psychiatric health\ncare workers often receive mixed messages from leaders: Do\nnot use RS, but however, do it with the inadequate resources\nyou have in terms of buildings, staffing, and assistance.\nIt's a Change of Heart\nIn direct contrast to mid-level ADMs and frontline workers,\ntop-level PMs did not see RS prevention as a costly under-\ntaking. In practice, psychiatric health care workers expressed\ndespair describing their surroundings and lack of support and\nresources. At the institutional level, there was a mismanag-\ning of the message of RS prevention. PMs at the top of the\nfield considered RS prevention nothing more than a \"change\nof heart.\"\nIt doesn't really cost any extra money. It's a cultural and\nattitudinal shift, it's a change of heart. It doesn't cost anything.\nIt's a culture. What we do is free, there is no dollar sign attached.\nNot only that, to tell you the truth, it would be more cost efficient\n[to prevent RS]. I mean look what happens with worker's\ncompensation, or staff injuries or calling out [sick]. When you\nhave restraints and seclusions it's as traumatizing to the staff as\nit is the patients who are being restrained. So I would have to say\nCarlson and Hall 9\nthat the staff, even if they are not bleeding, what happens to\nthem psychologically? Because they are in an environment\nwhere--what they are doing to people all the time affects them.\nThat's the long term effects of violence. There is nothing\ntherapeutic about that. (Female, PM)\nThe messages of violence prevention and trauma-\ninformed care are espoused in the ideological spin off.\nHowever, as the macro message starts in the heart and soul of\nculture, where the less visible structures organize practice, it\nends up in the mundane world of business as the message\nincreases in dross and loses meaning.\nWhile examining meanings, it was important to first see\nthe social in the individual. What people do and think, and\nhow they interact at the individual and local levels, informs\ntheir everyday ideologies and determines their paths of par-\nticipation in the social world (Charmaz, 2006). These psychi-\natric ideologies are translated through action into the world\nof practice where these ideas are produced and reproduced.\nThe language of psychiatric care processes takes on the ver-\nnacular of business as usual.\nThe first research question examined practice norms and\nactions that psychiatric health care workers perform in their\nsocial worlds to prevent RS use. On the surface, this is a\nsimple question. However, what participants reveal about\nhow they view their practice environments, their coworkers,\nand their workplace hierarchies shed more light on what is\nmissing for them in their practice worlds than what steps\nthey take to prevent RS use. Difficult and complex patient\ncare decisions concerning RS use are made without support,\nin chaotic environments where participants feel rushed to act\nout of a habit of necessity, acquiesced to, and justified by a\nlack of adequate resources. This reveals a notable gap in the\ntranslation of best practices in the area of RS prevention on\ninpatient psychiatric units. The messages of trauma-\ninformed, patient-centered, strength-based, and family-cen-\ntered care in the facilitation of quality preventive care and\ntreatment are not being adequately translated into practice.\nThere is a disconnection between the ideal types of care pro-\nmoted by SAMHSA and real-time practice. Access to quality\ncare and how care is financed figure prominently in this\nConclusion\nThe connections among the micro-, meso-, and macro-level\nanalysis, in concert with the relational characteristics of\npractice (individual), habitus (organizational), and field (pol-\nicy), form a complex web of facilitators and barriers influ-\nencing RS prevention practice (see Figure 2). At each level\nof analysis, the core categories are at cross purposes, while\nespousing intent to prevent RS use. Concepts, meanings, and\nideologies are put in motion, reproduced and made to work\nin the social world of psychiatric RS prevention and use\n(Bourdieu & Wacquant, 1992). This was a descriptive study\nconducted in one region of the United States, and results may\nnot be transferable to other regions.\nImplications\nAccording to these participants, psychiatric health care\nworkers are not always prepared to prevent RS due to mul-\ntiple barriers, including a lack of resources, time, space, and\neducation, and (mis)managed policy implementation.\nEnvironments of care are poorly designed. Few strategies for\nimprovement are given. Only one participant, who worked in\nan adolescent facility, described any state-level regulations\nor oversight from any state agency. The following describes\nsome possible solutions to these practice-level barriers.\nPolicy and Procedure\nInvolving psychiatric health care workers in the crafting of\nRS prevention policy is one low-cost, high-impact interven-\ntion that has the potential to increase both patient satisfaction\nwith psychiatric care and staff members' satisfaction with\ntheir job-lives. Opportunities for nurses, MHCs, and other\ndirect care staff to offer suggestions and to work interprofes-\nsionally on quality improvement projects create positive rela-\ntionships that change culture. By engaging direct care workers\nin creative projects, organizations invite budgetary savings\nrelated to the use of RS, worker's compensation, liability, and\nstaff turnover (Lebel, 2011). Investing in this simple interven-\ntion makes sense, while raising the consciousness of psychi-\natric workers by helping them reorganize their priorities to\nalign more closely with the RS prevention agenda, rather than\nwith the objective finality and economic fatalism invoked by\nthe business model. However, without the cooperation of\nstate-level regulators, insisting on this level of quality control,\nbusiness as usual will predominate.\nTrauma-Informed Care\nTrauma-informed care involves a reorganization of ideology,\na paradigmatic shift in thinking that can only occur by chang-\ning the structures of care and caring, both visible and invisi-\nble. This involves translating the message that RS use is\ntraumatizing to both patients and psychiatric health care\nstaff, including understanding the roles that violence and vic-\ntimization play in the lives of psychiatrically hospitalized\npersons. This challenges the business as usual model of psy-\nchiatric care by transforming the power dynamics among\nstaff and patients into a more collaborative model of coop-\neration, rather than forced compliance. Trauma-informed\ncare includes the psychiatric health care workers in the equa-\ntion by helping them examine their own vicarious traumas\nrelated to violence on inpatient units (Stromberg, 2012).\nAccording to the LEC, 80% of these participants have been\nvictims of physical assault, and almost all have seen other\nstaff members or patients injured during a RS.\nSpecific Mandates\nThere are clear and purposeful actions that the psychiatric\nhealth care professions are well situated to carry out, in rela-\ntion to the business of preventing RS use. First, the informa-\ntion and research forming the growing evidence base that RS\nuse is dangerous and ineffective needs to be compiled and\nwidely disseminated through education, and applied in prac-\ntice. Second, research is needed to develop a body of alterna-\ntive intervention strategies to counter the effects of the\nlanguage of business deployed in psychiatric care. Third,\nnursing and other disciplines have a duty to join together and\nsupport scholarship that reinforces the ethical argument\nagainst the business model of mental health care that sup-\nports the continued use of RS as a valid treatment interven-\ntion. This includes advocating for this vulnerable population\nof hospitalized persons at the community, state, and federal\nlevels to assure that they are being cared for in the most\nhumane and least restrictive manner possible. The preven-\ntion of violence in mental health treatment and the promotion\nof healing environments are public health priorities. This\namounts to more than just the business we are in.\nAuthors' Note\nKelly Carlson is now at Dr. Lillian R. Goodman Department of\nNursing, Worcester State University.\n"
