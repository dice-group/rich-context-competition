    "abstract": "Abstract\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a perplexing and pervasive developmental disorder characterized by social difficulties,\ncommunicative deficits, and repetitive behavior. The increased rate of ASD diagnosis has raised questions concerning\nthe genetic and environmental factors contributing to the development of this disorder; meanwhile, the cause of ASD\nremains unknown. This study surveyed mothers of ASD and non-ASD children to determine possible effects of labor and\ndelivery (L&D) drugs on the development of ASD. The survey was administered to mothers; however, the results were\nanalyzed by child, as the study focused on the development of autism. Furthermore, an independent ASD dataset from the\nSouthwest Autism Research and Resource Center was analyzed and compared. Indeed, L&D drugs are associated with ASD\n(p \u00bc.039). Moreover, the Southwest Autism Research and Resource Center dataset shows that the labor induction drug,\nPitocin, is significantly associated with ASD (p \u00bc.004). We also observed a synergistic effect between administrations of L&D\ndrugs and experiencing a birth complication, in which both obstetrics factors occurring together increased the likelihood of\nthe fetus developing ASD later in life (p \u00bc.0003). The present study shows the possible effects of L&D drugs, such as Pitocin\nlabor-inducing and analgesic drugs, on children and ASD.\n",

There has been ongoing research to ascertain the\netiology of ASD; it is generally acknowledged that autism\nhas a genetic basis, based on the evidence of a high level\nof heritability and high concordance rates in monozygotic\nversus dizygotic twins (Ronald et al., 2006; Hallmayer\net al., 2011). However, this genetic basis is likely strongly\ninfluenced by environmental factors (Deth et al., 2008;\nThis study examines one possible environmental risk\nfactor: Exposure of the fetus to labor and delivery (L&D)\ndrugs during labor and the birthing process. There has\nbeen a marked increase in the use of epidurals and labor-\ninducing drugs in the past 30 years, during which time-\nframe higher rates of autism diagnosis began occurring\nbeen reported that, although there is not sufficient evi-\ndence to claim independent risk factors, obstetric condi-\ntions were associated with an increased risk of autism,\nwhen factored along with parental age (Kolevzon et al.,\n2007). The two most commonly utilized classes of drugs\nin the L&D process are labor-inducing drugs and anal-\ngesic epidurals. The focus of this study analyzes uses of\ntwo classes of drugs that can be administered during the\nbirthing process: induction and analgesic drugs. For\nexample, Pitocin is a labor-inducing drug that has been\nBupivacaine is a local analgesic often used as an epidural,\nwhich is capable of crossing the placental barrier\nand Halpern, 2002). There have been a few contradictory\nstudies concerning the role L&D drugs might have in the\ndevelopment of autism. For example, data published\nwithin the past decade indicate the labor-inducing drug,\nPitocin, may increase the risk of developing autism (Juul-\nother recent publications contradict such findings and\nsuggest there are no associations between the use of\nlabor-inducing drugs and the risk of having a child diag-\nnosed with autism at a later date (Gale et al., 2003;\nConsequently, further research is needed to understand\nthe possible role of L&D drugs in the development of\nautism. Additionally, these previously published studies\nonly focus on labor induction drugs and not analgesics,\nwhich are commonly administered (Gale et al., 2003;\nTherefore, using data collected from a survey con-\nducted with mothers who have children with and without\nautism, we aimed to use this study to determine the effects\nof L&D drugs on the development of an autistic pheno-\ntype. The results of this study could have significance not\nonly for the scientific community but also for the general\npopulation, namely expecting parents. This research has\nthe potential to shed light on the possibility of environ-\nmental effects, specifically drugs administered during\nlabor, on the development of autism. Greater under-\nstanding of the factors that may increase the risk of\ndeveloping ASD could lead to changes in drug adminis-\ntration practices during the birthing process.\nMaterial and Methods\nStudy population. The study was granted approval by the insti-\ntutional review board at the Trinity University in San Antonio,\nTX. Participants provided written consent and responses to\nthe survey were kept anonymous. Surveys were verbally\nadministered through in-person or phone interviews.\nParticipants were comprised of mothers with children\nbetween the age of 2 and 25 who have been diagnosed\nwith ASD. Mothers with age-matched neurotypical chil-\ndren served as controls. The participants completed a\nquestionnaire aimed at collecting information regarding\nthe labor experience for mother and children (Table 1).\nAlthough mothers served as participants to provide retro-\nspective experiences, the study group of interest was the\nchildren. Therefore, the study included 49 children with\nan ASD diagnosis and 104 children who do not meet\nASD diagnosis criteria.\nAdditionally, a dataset of 101 ASD cases was obtained\nfrom the Southwest Autism Research and Resource\nCenter (SARRC). This dataset was collected and ana-\nlyzed independently, using our nonautistic sample as a\ncontrol for comparison.\nData analysis. Questionnaire data were analyzed using\nFisher's test to determine significance between children\nTable 1.

To determine if two inde-\npendent factors could potentially have a confounding effect,\nthe Cochran\u00adMantel\u00adHaenszel (CMH) test was performed,\nfollowed by the Tarone post hoc test. All analyses were\nperformed using the R (3.1.1) program with significance\nResults\nLabor & Delivery Drugs and Autistic Children\nBased on the questionnaire completed by mothers of aut-\nistic and nonautistic children, it was found that 28% of\nchildren without autism and 12% of children with autism\nwere not exposed to L&D drugs during childbirth, while\n72% and 88% of each group, respectively, were exposed\nto an epidural, Pitocin, or a combination of the two\nduring delivery (Figure 1). Moreover, it was found that\nindividuals within the drug-exposed condition were 2.77\ntimes more likely to exhibit an autistic phenotype than\nindividuals who had not been exposed to L&D drugs\nduring childbirth (p \u00bc .039). The data received from\nSARRC only included exposure to Pitocin. Therefore,\nto compare our findings to the SARRC data, we analyzed\nmothers who only received Pitocin during the child birth-\ning process to mothers who did not receive any drugs.\nWithin our dataset, labor induction was not significantly\nassociated with ASD (p \u00bc .354). However, within the\nindependent SARRC dataset, there was a significant rela-\nChildren with ASD in the SARRC sample were 2.32\ntimes more likely to have undergone labor induction\n(Figure 2).\nAlthough our population of participants who were\ndiagnosed with autism exhibited a higher proportion of\nL&D drug exposure than the control participants, there\nwere still a sizable number of individuals in the exposed\ncondition who remained neurotypical. This indicates that\nL&D drug exposure cannot be an independent factor\naccounting for the development of autism, suggesting\nthat an additional factor(s) must be present or occur in\norder for the L&D drugs to have an impact on the devel-\nopment of an ASD phenotype. We sought to determine\nwhether the duration of drug exposure during childbirth\ncould play a role in risk of autism; however, our results\nshowed duration of L&D drug exposure was not signifi-\ncantly associated with the development of ASD (p \u00bc .2;\nFigure 3).\nWithin our dataset, birth complications were also\nfound to be significantly associated with the development\nof ASD later in life. We observed that children with ASD\nwere more likely to have experienced birth complications\nSince birth complications increase the likelihood of a\nmother receiving L&D drugs, we sought to determine\nFigure 1.

Our results from the CMH analysis\nrevealed that there was no confounding effect, and birth\ncomplications and L&D drug exposure had a synergistic\neffect on the development of ASD (CMH \u00bc 12.97,\nFigure 2.

Additionally, as depicted in Table 2,\nthe SARRC dataset verified our findings (CMH \u00bc 19.26,\nDiscussion\nA Mother's Choice During Labor\nIt has been reported that the use of an epidural (either as\nan analgesic for labor pains or to perform a caesarean\nsection) during the birthing process was more common to\nmothers of children with a diagnosis of ASD, as com-\npared with controls (Glasson et al., 2004). Additionally,\nprevious studies have suggested that epidurals can nega-\ntively impact the fetus, including impacting fetal core\ntemperature and leading to low Apgar scores at birth\n(Glasson et al., 2004). Likewise, labor induction com-\nmonly occurs in obstetrics during the birthing process.\nWhile the role of oxytocin on pregnancy and labor has\nbeen well studied, the effects of administering exogenous\noxytocin (Pitocin) during labor have not been well\nstudied. Moreover, there have been conflicting reports\nregarding the role Pitocin might play in the development\nof ASD (Kenkel et al., 2014). Therefore, we analyzed the\npotential impact epidurals and Pitocin might have on the\ndevelopment of autism.\nResults of our human survey study showed that chil-\ndren in the drug-exposed condition during labor were 2.77\ntimes more likely to exhibit an autism phenotype. While\nthe SARRC dataset only contained labor induction infor-\nmation, it was observed that mothers who received Pitocin\nduring the birthing process were 2.32 times more likely to\nhave a child diagnosed with autism later in life.\nThe fact that not all children exposed to an epidural\n(e.g. Bupivacaine), Pitocin, or both later developed an\nautism phenotype suggests interaction with other factors,\nwhich current research is attempting to elucidate. We\nfound that the duration of the L&D drugs was not\nFigure 4. Mothers of children with ASD are more likely to experience birth complications. ASD (n \u00bc 49) and non-ASD (n \u00bc 104) children\nwere compared based on the experience of a birth complication. Using the Fisher's exact test, children with ASD were 2.83 times more\nlikely to have been born after experiencing a birth complication, *p \u00bc.004, OR \u00bc 2.83. These findings were supported by the SARRC\nTable 2.

These findings are supported\nby the independent dataset obtained from SARRC as well\nas a previous study, which shows children diagnosed with\nautism experienced more complications during birth, as\ncompared with controls (Glasson et al., 2004).\nFurthermore, the L&D drug and the birth complications\nassociations were found to have a synergistic impact as it\nrelates the development of an ASD phenotype.\nLimitations and Future Directions\nWe conducted a study that explored the possible role\nL&D drugs might have in the increased prevalence of\nASD, in attempts to better understand possible environ-\nmental factors and their connection to ASD. The results\nfrom our study demonstrate an association between the\nexposure to L&D drugs and the development of an\nautism phenotype, in support of previous reports with\nKenkel et al., 2014). However, it is very unlikely that\nL&D drugs alone would cause an autism phenotype;\nlike any environmental factor, assessment of risk in the\ncontext of genetic predisposition should be performed.\nFurthermore, we acknowledge that the current study\nhas a few limitations. The first limitation is the sample\nsize. We tried to address this limitation by including an\nindependent dataset, the SARRC dataset. However, the\nSARRC dataset did not include all of the variables\nfound in our survey (e.g., information about analgesic\nused during the birthing process). Furthermore, due to\nthe sample size limitation, when the data were stratified\nfor the type of L&D drug among the ASD group,\nthe Pitocin only group comprised 6% of our dataset,\nwhile the Epidural only group comprised 48% and the\nEpidural \u00fe Pitocin group comprised 31%. This is in com-\nparison to the SARRC dataset, where the Pitocin-exposed\nchildren comprised 64% of their dataset. Therefore, the\ndivergent findings are likely due to the smaller sample\nsize in our dataset. While this highlights the importance\nof a future independent study with a larger dataset to\nverify such associations found within the SAARC dataset,\nit does not reduce the significance of such findings.\nHowever, in the future, we would like to conduct a\nlarger study to include collaborations with hospitals in\norder to recruit patients for prospective studies, which\nwould also include data analyzed from medical records.\nA second limitation is the fact that the data analyzed\nwere questionnaire data, which can be subject to recall\nbias. An inherent known problem with association/case\u00ad\ncontrol studies is recall bias. However, it has also been\nshown that the major problem with association studies\nthat use parental reporting is not recall bias, but\nnondifferential misclassification (Infante-Rivard and\nJacques, 2000). Two attempts were made to avoid this\nlimitation: (a) careful selection of the questions included\nin the questionnaire (e.g., Yes or No questions or numer-\nical ratings of 1 or 2) and (b) the included control group.\nFurthermore, while recall bias could possibly impact\ncase\u00adcontrol studies, such studies have been extremely\ninformative within the scientific community, despite\nsome on the inherent limitations. Since the results from\nour human study demonstrate a relationship between the\nuse of Pitocin and/or epidurals and the development of\nan autism phenotype, a future independent study with a\nlarger sample size should be conducted.\n"
