    "abstract": "Abstract\nAcross different times and cultures, parents exercise considerable influence over their children's mate choices. When they do\nso, parents are looking for specific traits in a prospective daughter- and son-in-law. Using a sample of 674 parents, the current\nresearch investigated in-law preferences in China. Participants rated 88 different traits, which were clustered in 10 different\npreference domains. In-law preferences were found to be contingent on the sex of the in-law and the sex of the parent. The\ndata from the current study were compared with data from a different study which took place in the Republic of Cyprus. It\nwas found that preferences varied in the two samples, but specific cultural differences were identified. It was also found that\nfor both samples, the 10 different domains clustered in two supra-domains. The first supra-domain, where personality traits\nclustered, was preferred more by both Chinese and Greek-Cypriot parents than the second domain, where the rest of the\ntraits clustered.\n",

In preindustrial societies, it is usually the case that\nparents choose directly spouses for their children through\nthe institution of arranged marriage (Broude & Green,\ninfluence mate choice indirectly through using manipula-\nSussman, 1953). To guide their in-law choices, parents\nhave well-defined in-law preferences (Apostolou, 2007a).\nThese preferences have been examined in Western postin-\ndustrial societies (Apostolou, 2015b) as well as in prein-\ndustrial societies (Apostolou, 2010a), but there is limited if\nany research in non-Western postindustrial societies.\nAccordingly, the first goal of the current study is to exam-\nine in-law preferences in the Chinese culture. Moreover, in-\nlaw preferences are not rigid mechanisms, but adaptable to\nthe prevailing ecological conditions, which means that cross-\ncultural variation is expected (Apostolou, 2014b). Thus, the\nsecond goal of the current study is to examine variation in\nin-law preferences between the Chinese and the Greek-\nCypriot culture. We will start by discussing the evolutionary\nlogic of in-law preferences.\nIn-Law Preferences\nEvidence from anthropological studies on contemporary pre-\nindustrial societies indicates that parents exercise strong control\nover their children's mate choices (Broude & Green, 1983;\nStephens, 1963). In particular, in preindustrial societies which\nbase their subsistence on hunting and gathering, the most com-\nmon mode of long-term mating is arranged marriage, where\nparents choose spouses for their children (Apostolou, 2007b).\nThis is also the case in preindustrial societies that base their\nsubsistence on agriculture and animal husbandry (Apostolou,\n2010b). It is likely that the typical patterns of mating in con-\ntemporary preindustrial societies have also been typical in\nancestral preindustrial societies (Apostolou, 2014b; Ember,\n1978). This argument is consistent with historical evidence,\n1 Fudan University, Shanghai, China\n2 University of Nicosia, Nicosia, Cyprus\nCorresponding Author:\nMenelaos Apostolou, University of Nicosia, 46 Makedonitissas Ave., 1700\nNicosia, Cyprus.\nEmail: m.apostolou@gmail.com\nEvolutionary Psychology\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/evp\nCreative Commons CC BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nwhich indicates that in historical preindustrial societies,\narranged marriage was the typical mode of long-term mating\n(Apostolou, 2012). It is also supported by evidence from phy-\nlogenetic studies which attempt to reconstruct the ancestral\nhuman condition (Walker, Hill, Flinn, & Ellsworth, 2011).\nAccordingly, there are good reasons to believe that during\nmost of human evolutionary time, parents have been facing the\nevolutionary problem of choosing beneficial in-laws, that is to\nsay, to screen prospective daughters- and sons-in-law for those\nwho had the most beneficial traits. This problem translated into\nexercising selection pressure that would favor mechanisms that\nenabled parents to perform this screening. Such mechanisms\nare in-law preferences: Parents would tend to find fitness-\nincreasing traits (i.e., traits that would make a positive contri-\nbution to the surviving and reproductive success of parents and\ntheir genetic relatives) desirable and fitness-decreasing traits\nOne study examined in-law preferences in 67 preindustrial\nsocieties and identified 13 traits, such as \"Good character\" and\n\"Good family background,\" that parents found desirable in\nprospective daughters- and sons-in-law (Apostolou, 2010a; see\nalso Koster, 2011). Some traits were reported as important\nmore frequently than others, suggesting that parents had a hier-\narchy of importance in their in-law preferences.\nIn postindustrial societies, studies in the United Kingdom and\nthe United States found that parents had a well-defined hierarchy\nof in-law preferences (Apostolou, 2007a; Perilloux, Fleischman,\n& Buss, 2011). However, these studies employed instruments that\nwere originally developed to study mate preferences and, thus,\ncould not capture the full range of in-law preferences. To address\nthis limitation, one study administered an open-ended question-\nnaire in a sample of Greek-Cypriot families and identified 86\ndesirable traits (Apostolou,2011). On the basis of anthropological\nevidence, a subsequent study added two more traits in this list and\naskedasampleofGreek-Cypriotparentstoindicatehowdesirable\nthey considered each of the 88 traits separately in a prospective\nson-in-law and in a prospective daughter-in-law (Apostolou,\n2014a). Principal components analysis found 11 trait domains for\na daughter-in-law and a son-in-law.\nA larger scale study employed a large sample of Greek-\nCypriot parents who were asked to rate how desirable they\nwould consider the 88 traits in a prospective spouse for their\nchildren (Apostolou, 2015b). Principal components analysis\nrevealed 10 in-law preferences domains. This research needs\nto be extended, however, because there are only two studies\nthat have attempted to examine the structure of in-law prefer-\nences, and additional replication is needed. Also, to our\nknowledge, there is no study that has attempted to examine\nthe structure of in-law preferences in non-Western postindus-\ntrial societies.\nContingencies\nDaughters-in-law versus sons-in-law. Men and women differ in\ntheir capacities and in the social goals ascribed to them (Whyte,\n1978). For instance, women face menopause, and as a\nconsequence, their reproductive value declines more sharply\nthan men's with age (Buss, 2017). To use another example,\nacross different societies, wealth is controlled predominantly\nby men (Whyte, 1978). Such differences suggest that it would\npay for parents to differentiate their preferences depending on\nthe sex of the in-law. In these examples, it would beneficial for\nparents to ascribe more value to youth in a daughter-in-law\nthan in a son-in-law and more value to wealth in a son-in-\nlaw than in a daughter-in-law. In this way, parents would divert\ntheir limited resources in getting daughters-in-law who are\nyoung and more likely to give them grandchildren and\nsons-in-law who control resources and can assist them in their\nsurvival and reproductive effort. Overall, certain traits make\ndifferent contributions to the fitness of parents depending on\nwhether they are found in a daughter-in-law or in a son-in-law.\nThese differences translate into selection pressures to be\nexercised making in-law preferences contingent to the sex of\nEmpirical evidence is consistent with this prediction. In pre-\nindustrials societies, traits such as \"Good economic prospects\"\nand \"Wealthy\" were reported as important significantly more\nfrequently in a son-in-law than in a daughter-in-law (Apostolou,\n2010a). On the other hand, \"Chastity\" was reported significantly\nmore often in a daughter-in-law than in a son-in-law. Studies in\npostindustrial societies found that traits such as wealth and a\ngood social standing were preferred more in a son-in-law than\nin a daughter-in-law, while traits such as good looks and good\nhousekeeping abilities were preferred more in a daughter-in-law\nMothers versus fathers. Certain traits in a prospective in-law are\nlikely to give different fitness benefits to fathers and mothers.\nFor example, due to internal gestation, women are more certain\nthan men that their children are actually their own (Buss,\n2000). Accordingly, if a prospective in-law harms their chil-\ndren and grandchildren, the fitness cost would be potentially\nhigher for mothers than for fathers, as the former are more\ncertain that their children and grandchildren are actually their\nand emotional stability, which predict how well a prospective\nin-law will treat their children, could be more fitness increasing\nfor mothers than for fathers. In this respect, selection pressures\nmay have resulted in in-law preferences diverging depending\non the sex of the in-law. However, since most of the traits in a\nprospective in-law are expected to give the same benefits to\nboth parents, mothers' and fathers' preferences are predicted to\noverlap considerably (Apostolou, 2007a).\nMost studies in postindustrial societies found almost a com-\nplete overlap in preferences between mothers and fathers\nfound that \"From a wealthy family\" and \"Wealthy\" traits were\npreferred more by fathers than by mothers, while mothers val-\nued kindness in a prospective son-in-law more than in a pro-\nspective daughter-in-law (Apostolou, 2016a). Thus, additional\nstudies are required in order to examine the degree that moth-\ners' and fathers' preferences overlap.\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nCultural variation. The prevailing evolutionary conditions affect\nthe importance of traits in an in-law. For instance, if in a given\ncontext there is very limited surplus wealth, the wealth an\nindividual possesses is of little relevance to parents. In a dif-\nferent society, where much surplus wealth is produced and is\nunequally distributed, the wealth an individual possesses is of\nmuch higher importance to parents. The ecological conditions\nthat parents found themselves into during human evolutionary\ntime were, most likely, not static which means that the fitness\ncontribution of different traits would vary. For instance, a\nperiod of plague would increase considerably the fitness value\nof being healthy in an in-law, while following the end of the\nplague, its fitness value would decrease. In the same vein, in a\nperiod of war, the fitness value of traits such as physical\nstrength would increase and the same value would decrease\nfollowing a period of peace.\nConsequently, it would not be optimal for parents to have\nevolved rigid in-law preferences, that is, to prefer specific traits\nirrespectively of the prevailing conditions. It would be more\noptimal for parents to have evolved dispositions that would\nenable them to prefer fitness-increasing traits in a prospective\nin-law, but these preferences would be flexible and adjustable\nto local conditions. This being the case, parents would share a\nsimilar structure of in-law preferences across different cultures\n--they would prefer the same basic traits, but the weights they\nascribe to each trait would differ.\nOne study examined differences in preference between pre-\nindustrial societies of different subsistence types (Apostolou,\n2010a). Comparison between societies which based their sub-\nsistence on hunting and gathering with societies that based\ntheir subsistence on agriculture and animal husbandry indicated\nthat being wealthy and coming from a good family background\nwere reported more frequently as important in the latter than in\nthe former. To our knowledge, there has not been any study\nthat attempted to examine cross-cultural variation among post-\nindustrial societies.\nOverall, although our understanding of in-law preferences\nhas increased considerably over the last years, there are\nconsiderable gaps in the literature. To begin with, in-law pre-\nferences have not being investigated in non-Western postindus-\ntrial societies. In addition, there has been only one attempt to\nexamine the structure of in-law preferences, and additional\nreplication is needed. Last but not least, there has not been any\nattempt to examine variation in in-law preferences across dif-\nferent postindustrial societies. The current article contributes in\nclosing the gap to our knowledge by examining in-law prefer-\nences in China and comparing these findings with the findings\nof a different study on in-law preferences in the Republic\nof Cyprus.\nMore specifically, on the basis of the evolutionary frame-\nwork developed above, we can make the following predictions:\n(a) Chinese parents would have a well-defined hierarchy of in-\nlaw preferences; (b) these preferences would be contingent on\nthe sex of the in-law; (c) Chinese fathers and mothers would\nhave largely overlapping in-law preferences, but there would\nbe specific differences; and (d) the structure of Chinese and\nGreek-Cypriot in-law preferences would be similar, but there\nwould be differences, reflecting predominantly ecological dif-\nferences between the two cultural settings.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe participants of the study completed an online survey. More\nspecifically, we recruited students registered in courses in psy-\nchology in a Chinese university, who contacted their parents\nabout taking part in a research on mate and in-law choice.\nParents who agreed to participate were forwarded the link of\nthe study. To distinguish between couples, each family was\nascribed a number, and participants would enter this number\nwhen answering the survey.\nEach participant received a certain payment after complet-\ning the survey (i.e., 3.0 \u00a5,yu\u00e1n). Overall, 674 Chinese parents\nparents had only one child. The male children had a mean age\nMoreover, 13.2% of the participants lived in a rural area,\n25.5% lived in a small town, and 61.3% lived in an urban area.\nWith respect to education, 11.0% of participants had completed\nhad a bachelor degree, and 8.8% had a postgraduate degree.\nFinally, all of the participants were married.\nMaterials\nThe survey had two parts. In the first part, participants were\nasked to fill their demographic information (such as sex, age,\neducational level, marital status, and sex of child). In the next\npart, the participants were asked to rate how desirable they\nconsidered a set of 88 traits in the prospective child-in-law,\nusing a 4-point Likert-type scale (0 = unimportant, 1 = some-\nhow important, 2 = important, 3 = indispensable). The 88 traits\nto measure in-law preferences have been identified by previous\nresearch (Apostolou, 2011). Please note that the order of pre-\nsentation of the 88 traits was randomized across participants.\nResults\nIn order to classify traits in broader preference domains, princi-\npal components method for factor extraction and direct\noblimin as the rotation method were used. Direct oblimin was\nchosen because the assumption of noncorrelated preferences was\nunlikely to hold (Field, 2013). The results suggested a 10-factor\nsolution (eigenvalue > 1), and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO)\nstatistic was .97, indicating a very good sample adequacy. The\nfactors and the respective loadings were presented in Table 1.\nThe scales produced by this procedure were checked by means\nof reliability analysis. The internal consistency (Cronbach's )\nWang and Apostolou 3\nIn order to construct a hierarchy of preferences, we estimated\nthe means and standard deviations for each extracted factor by\nsumming the traits that composed each factor and dividing them\nby their number. The results were presented in Table 2. The \"Reli-\nable,\" \"Family oriented,\" and \"Kind and understanding\" topped\nparticipants' preferences. The \"Strong personality,\" \"Exciting per-\nsonality,\" \"Well-off,\" and \"Good cook\u00adhousekeeper\" were found\nin the middle of the hierarchy. Finally, the \"Chastity,\" \"Good\nlooks,\" and \"Similar religious and ethnic background\" were found\nat the bottom of the preferences hierarchy.\nContingencies\nIn order to examine whether parents' preferences were contin-\ngent on the sex of the in-law, and whether mothers and fathers\nTable 1.

We have also included the Chinese terms that were used in the study.\n4 Evolutionary Psychology\nwere in agreement over what they looked for in a prospective\nin-law, we run a series of Doubly Multivariate Analysis on\neach extracted factor. This analysis was similar to multivariate\nanalysis of variance, but it allowed the independent factors to\nbe within subsects. In this case, because the current study\nemployed a within-family design, the answers of mothers and\nfathers should not be considered independent, and participants'\nsex needed to be treated as a within-subjects factor. Also, par-\nticipants gave ratings only for one in-law (e.g., son-in-law), so\nthe sex of the in-law would be treated as a between-subjects\ndesign. Accordingly, the traits that composed each factor were\nentered as the dependent variables, and the sex of the in-law\nwas entered as the independent between-subjects factor, and\nthe sex of the parent was entered as the within-subjects inde-\npendent factor. Overall, 10 tests were performed. Multiple tests\nwere likely to inflate the  level. Accordingly, Bonferroni cor-\nresults were presented in Table 2.\nDaughters-in-law versus sons-in-law. In most cases, the sex of the\nin-law came significant with a large effect size. An examina-\ntion of the means for the significant domains indicated that\nthese traits were preferred more in a son-in-law than in a\ndaughter-in-law. The exception was the \"Good looks,\" where\nthe means overlapped. In this case, the significant difference\ncame predominantly from the \"Tall\" and the \"Athletic\" com-\nponents of this domain that were preferred more in a son-in-law\nthan in a daughter-in-law.\nThese findings were inconsistent with our original predic-\ntions. In particular, we predicted that certain traits would be\npreferred more in son-in-law and others more in a daughter-in-\nlaw, but we found that most traits were preferred more in a son-\nin-law than in a daughter-in-law. We believe that this finding\ncould be explained by the unbalanced sex ratio currently pre-\nvailing in China. More specifically, the one-child policy pre-\nvented parents from having more than one child, and most\nparents favored male children, resulting in more young men\nto be available as grooms and fewer young women available as\nbrides (Deng, 2000). Such difference allowed parents with\ndaughters to be more selective than parents with sons, which\nwas reflected in the stronger preferences for sons-in-law.\nThis argument is consistent with the argument that in-law\npreferences are adjustable to prevailing conditions (here, the\nunbalanced sex ratio). However, the unbalanced sex-ratio effect\nmay have potentially masked evolved in-law contingencies. Par-\nents may have evolved to prefer certain traits more in a daughter-\nin-law than in a son-in-law, but the unbalanced sex ratio resulted\nin parents placing extra weight to the ones in a son-in-law\nwhich, in turn, could result in these traits not to come significant\n**and/or to come significant in favor of sons-in-law.\nWe can apply a simple way to remove the unbalanced sex-\nratio effect, so that we can better examine the contingencies in\nin-law preferences. More specifically, in a balanced sex-ratio\nscenario, the overall preference strength would be the same for\ndaughters- and sons-in-law. The observed divergence in prefer-\nences would be due to the unbalanced sex-ratio effect, so if this\ndifference could be estimated, it could be removed from the data.\nFor this purpose, we added all scores for the 88 traits that parents\ngave for a son-in-law and all scores they gave for a daughter-in-\nlaw, and we divided them by their number. The grand mean for a\n(SD = .44). The difference between the two was .117 units in our\n4-point scale. On this basis, we can assume that the unbalanced\nsex-ratio effect resulted in in-law preferences for parents with\ndaughters to increase by about .117 units.\nWe have deducted from all the scores for a son-in-law the\n.117, and we have repeated the analysis above. The results\nwere presented in Table 2. We can see that the \"Reliable\" and\nthe \"Family oriented\" came no longer significant. The \"Good\nlooks\" came significant, but this time because most of the\ncomposing traits were preferred significantly more in a daugh-\nter- than in a son-in-law.\nTable 2.

Moving on to fathers and mothers, there\nwas considerable agreement between the two, as only 2 of the\n10 domains were preferred differently. For the \"Strong person-\nality,\" the \"Intelligent,\" \"Dynamic,\" and \"Longsighted\" sub-\ncomponents were preferred more by mothers than by fathers.\nFor the \"Well-off,\" the \"Good provider\" and the \"Educated\"\nwere preferred more by mothers than by fathers, while the\n\"Good economic prospects\" was preferred more by fathers than\nby mothers.\nIn addition, a significant interaction was found between the\np\n= .024. In particular, mothers gave a higher score\nfor a son-in-law than for a daughter in-law, but fathers gave a\nhigher score for a daughter-in-law than for a son-in-law.\nCultural Effects and Similarities\nIn order to examine cross-cultural difference and similarities in\npreferences, we employed evidence from a study conducted in\nthe republic of Cyprus. More specifically, this study employed\nevidence from Greek-Cypriots parents to rate the same 88 traits\nwe employed here, in a prospective daughter- or son-in-law\nWe can start by comparing the factor structure derived here,\nwith the factor structure derived in Apostolou (2015b) study.\nThe factor structure was very similar across the two groups.\nMore specifically, the \"Family oriented,\" \"Good looks,\"\n\"Exciting personality,\" \"Good cook\u00adhousekeeper,\" and \"Simi-\nlar religious and ethnic background\" were found in both set-\ntings. The \"Kind and understanding\" found here was very\nsimilar to the \"Kind, understanding, and cooperative,\" with the\nmain difference being that the cooperative component did not\nload here. The \"Reliable\" found in the current study was very\nsimilar to the \"Reliable and tolerant\" but without the tolerant\ncomponent to load in the Chinese case. Moreover, the \"Well-\noff\" was similar to the \"Good economic prospects,\" with the\ndifference that the family background components did not load\nto the latter. Also, there was overlap between the \"Strong\npersonality\" and the \"Spontaneous and selfless.\" The \"Well-\noff\" family background found in the Apostolou (2015b) study\nwas not found here, but it seemed to have been integrated to the\n\"Well-off\" domain. Finally, the \"Chastity\" found in the current\nstudy was not found in the Apostolou (2015b) study, but it was\nfound in the Apostolou (2014a) study which also employed a\nGreek-Cypriot sample. Overall, although there are differences,\nthe structure of in-law preferences appears to be very similar in\nthe two cultures.\nWe can now proceed to investigate cultural differences in\nmore detail. In order to make comparisons possible, we needed\nto employ a common factor structure, and for this purpose, we\nused the factor structure produced for the Chinese sample.\nAccordingly, we estimated the means and standard deviations\nfor the Greek-Cypriot sample, and we ranked them next to the\nChinese sample (Table 3). In order to examine similarity, we\napplied Spearman's correlation between the ranks for each\nsample. The correlation was significant and very strong,\nof in-law preferences across the two samples was very similar.\nIn order to examine differences further, we applied Doubly\nMultivariate Analysis on each domain. In particular, the traits\ncomposing each factor were entered as the dependent variables\nand the sex of the in-law and the sample (Chinese/Greek-\nCypriot) were entered as the between-subjects factors and the\nsex of the parent as the within-subjects factor. Please note that\nin the Greek-Cypriot sample, if parents had two adult children\nof different sexes, they would give ratings for both prospective\ndaughters- and sons-in-law. In order to make comparisons\nbetween samples possible, we dropped these cases (about 8%\nof the Greek-Cypriot sample). The results of this analysis were\npresented in Table 3.\nWe can see that the sample came significant in all cases. The\n\"Reliable\" and the \"Kind and understanding\" were preferred\nmore by the Chinese than by the Greek-Cypriot parents. For\nthe \"Family oriented,\" the means overlapped; the results indi-\ncated that the \"Wants children,\" \"Loves children,\" and \"Good\nparent\" subcomponents were preferred more by Greek-Cypriot\nTable 3.

The\nremaining seven domains were preferred more by Greek-\nCypriot than by Chinese parents.\nThe effect sizes indicated that the largest difference was\nover \"Similar religious and ethnic background,\" where Chinese\nparents indicated a very weak interest in comparison to Greek-\nCypriot parents. The second largest difference was over\n\"Strong personality\" which was considered important in both\ncultures, but as more important in the Greek-Cypriot culture.\nMoreover, for 6 of the 10 domains, a significant interaction\nwas found between the sex of the in-law and the sample. We\nhave plotted the interaction using grand means (i.e., adding\nthe domains together and dividing them by their number) in\nFigure 1. We can see that the interaction came predominantly\nfrom Chinese parents giving higher scores for prospective\nsons-in-law than for prospective daughters-in-law, which was\nnot the case for Greek-Cypriots. Finally, significant interactions\nbetween the sample and the sex of the parent were found for\nthe \"Well-off\" and the \"Strong personality.\" In these cases,\nwhen we moved from the Chinese to the Greek-Cypriot sam-\nple, the scores increased for both parents, but more for fathers\nthan for mothers.\nSecond-order factor structure. We would like to examine whether\nthe 10 different domains clustered in even broader supra-\ndomains. For this purpose, we applied second-order principal\ncomponents analysis. In particular, we estimated 10 new vari-\nables by summing and dividing by their number the traits that\ncomposed each domain. We subsequently applied principal\ncomponents analysis on these variables, with direct oblimin\nas the rotation method. We performed this analysis twice, once\nfor the Chinese sample and once for the Greek-Cypriot sample.\nFor the Chinese sample, the results suggested a two-factor\nsolution (eigenvalue > 1), and the KMO statistic was .88,\nindicating a very good sample adequacy. The scales produced\nby this procedure were checked by means of reliability analy-\nsis. The internal consistency (Cronbach's ) was .91 for the\nfirst supra-domain and .81 for the second. For the Greek-\nCypriot sample, the results also suggested a two-factor solu-\ntion. The KMO statistic was .82, and the internal consistency\nwas .94 for the first supra-domain and .76 for the second. The\nsupra-domains and the respective loadings were presented\nin Table 4.\nThe personality domains clustered in the first supra-domain,\nwhile the rest of the traits clustered to the second supra-\ndomain. In order to assess importance, we estimated the means\nfor each supra-domain. For the Chinese sample, the personality\nsupra-domain was considered more important (M = 2.17,\nSD = .32) than the other traits supra-domain (M = 1.36,\nSD = .42). This was also the case for the Greek-Cypriot sample\nbe interpreted to indicate that parents cared predominantly\nabout the personality of their prospective in-laws and second-\nary about the rest of their prospective in-laws traits.\nIn order to examine contingencies in these factors, we run\na four-way mixed design analysis of variance, where in-law\npreferences were entered as the dependent variable, the sex of\nthe parent and the domain type were entered as the within-\nsubjects factors, and the sample (Chinese/Greek-Cypriot) and\nthe sex of the in-law were entered as the between-subjects\nfactors. The results indicated several significant interaction\nand main effects.\nTo begin with, there was a significant main effect of the sex\np\nmothers gave overall higher scores (M = 1.86, SD = .39) than\nfathers (M = 1.81, SD = .40).

In addition, there was a significant\ninteraction between the sex of the parent and the domain,\np\ndecreased when we moved from mothers to fathers and\ndecreased more for the other traits supra-domain than for the\npersonality supra-domain.\nFinally, there was a significant three-way interaction\nbetween the sex of the parent, the sex of the in-law, and the\np\nabove, for the other traits supra-domain the scores for the two\nin-laws were similar, but when we moved to the personality\nsupra-domain, the score increased more for a son-in-law than\nfor a daughter-in-law. This increase was more pronounced for\nfathers than for mothers.\nDiscussion\nOur results indicate that parents in China had a well-defined\nhierarchy of in-law preferences. Their preferences were con-\ntingent on the sex of the in-law, while mothers and fathers had\nlargely overlapping preferences. In-law preferences were also\nfound to be contingent on the cultural context, as comparisons\nbetween the Chinese and Greek-Cypriot samples indicated con-\nsiderable similarities but also specific differences.\nIn more detail, the primary concern of Chinese parents was\nthe personality of their prospective in-laws. The first 5 of the\n10 preferences domains referred directly to personality and\nclustered to a single personality supra-domain. This is not\nsurprising, as personality predicts a wide range of human\nconduct (Buss & Hawley, 2010) which is relevant to in-law\nchoice (Apostolou, 2014a). Reliability ensures that parents\nhave in-laws who will be consistently there for them and their\nfamily, kindness ensures that in-laws will treat parents and\ntheir children well, family oriented ensures stability in mar-\nriage, strong personality ensures success in fitness-increasing\ngoals, and exciting personality ensures successful integration\nto the family unit.\nFigure 2. The figures depict the three-way interaction between the domain type, the sample, and the sex of the in-law. We can see the first\nsupra-domain the scores of Chinese and Greek-Cypriot parents converged. However, when we moved to the second supra-domain the\nscores decreased, but more for the Chinese than for the Greek-Cypriot parents. This decrease was more pronounced for a daughter-in-law\nthan for a son-in-law, that is to say, the scores of Chinese parents dropped more sharply in the former than in the latter case.\nTable 4. The Factor Loadings for the Second-Order Principal Com-\nponents Analysis.\nFactor Loadings\nSupra-Domains Chinese Greek-Cypriot\nSupra-domain 1\nSupra-domain 2\n8 Evolutionary Psychology\nParents also cared to have in-laws who were well-off and\ncame from well-off families and could bring to their family\nunit monetary resources. The well-off domain was in the mid-\ndle of the in-law hierarchy, below personality traits, indicating\nthat Chinese parents valued personality more than wealth and\nfamily background. One possible explanation is that person-\nality constitutes a more reliable predictor of resources than the\nactual resources one controls, as money can be spent or lost,\nbut personality traits that lead to money making cannot.\nMoreover, in the Chinese context, as well as in other post-\nindustrial societies, families are relative independent, so alli-\nances with other families become less important than in a\npreindustrial context.\nThe looks of a prospective in-law did not appear to be\nimportant for parents. Similarly, parents did not care about\nsimilarity in ethnic and religious background, which was\nlocated at the bottom of the in-law preferences hierarchy.\nOther studies have found that similarity was important for\nparents, one reason for this being that it enables effective\nintegration to the family unit (Apostolou, 2014b). This find-\ning should not be interpreted, however, as indicating that\nChinese parents did not look for similarity, but that they did\nnot look for similarity in these traits. We believe that the main\nreason for this finding is that China is relative homogenous in\nterms of ethnicity and religion, so prospective in-laws are\nunlikely to vary in these dimensions, turning them irrelevant\nto in-law choice.\nMoreover, it was found that parents gave higher scores for\ntheir prospective sons-in-law than for their prospective\ndaughters-in-law. We have argued that this difference was due\nto the unbalanced sex-ratio effect; that is, the one-child policy\nin China has resulted in more young men than young women\nto be available as spouses, which allowed parents with daugh-\nters to be more selective than parents with sons. This finding\nindicates that in-law preferences can adjust to local condi-\ntions. This being the case, we can predict that this effect will\nreside in the future. In particular, the one-child policy has\nbeen recently relaxed (see the Communist Party of China the\nfifth Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee\nBulletin, 2015), which is likely to lead to a more balanced\nsex ratio that, in turn, will result in parents with daughters not\nbeing able to be that selective.\nThe unbalanced sex-ratio effect has probably masked\nevolved contingencies in in-law preferences. Accordingly,\nwe have attempted to remove this effect from the data. We\nfound that when doing so, good looks were preferred more in\na daughter-in-law than in a son-in-law, while being reliable\nand family oriented was valued the same in both in-laws. Yet,\non the basis of previous research and evolutionary theorizing\nexpect that chastity and housekeeping/cooking capacities\nwould be preferred more in a daughter-in-law than in a son-\nin-law, but such sex differences were not found. We have to\nsay that our method of removing the unbalanced sex-ratio\neffect was crude, and this may explain the nonsignificant\ndifferences. Future research may attempt to control better this\neffect, by replicating this study in areas of China where the\nsex ratio is balanced.\nThe preferences of mothers and fathers largely overlapped.\nIn the cases where differences were found, mothers gave higher\nscores than fathers. In addition, the aggregate scores of mothers\nwere significantly higher than the aggregate scores of fathers.\nOne possible interpretation of this difference is that mothers are\nmore selective than fathers when it comes to in-law choice.\nOne reason may be the difference in parental uncertainty. Since\nmothers are more certain than their children are actually their\nown, they may have more at stake in the mate choices of their\nchildren and so they may be more selective over in-law choice\n(Apostolou, 2015a). If this difference constitutes an evolved\npredisposition, it should also be found in other cultures. Con-\nsistent with this prediction, it was also found in both samples,\nbut more cross-cultural replication is needed.\nComparisons between Chinese and Greek-Cypriot samples\nindicated that in-law preferences were very similar across sam-\nples. First-order principal components analysis indicated a very\nsimilar factor structure across samples, and second-order prin-\ncipal components analysis indicated an identical factor struc-\nture across the two samples. In addition, correlational analysis\nindicated that the hierarchy of in-law preferences was very\nsimilar across the two samples. Yet, specific differences have\nbeen found in the two samples.\nThe primary differences were that Chinese parents gave\nhigher scores for their prospective son-in-law than for their\nprospective daughters-in-law, and Greek-Cypriot parents\nplaced considerable more emphasis on the similarity in reli-\ngious and ethnic background. Starting from the former differ-\nence, the sex ratio in Cyprus is much more balanced, which\nmeans that, as opposed to Chinese parents with daughters,\nGreek-Cypriot parents with daughters could not afford to be\nmore selective than parents with sons.\nMoving on to the second difference, the Republic of Cyprus\nis much less homogenous than China in terms of ethnicity and\nreligion, as there are many different ethnic groups of different\nreligious backgrounds in the country. Accordingly, marriage\nwith prospective in-laws of different ethnic and religious back-\ngrounds is much more probable in Cyprus than in China, which\nmakes these dimensions much more important in the former\nthan in the latter. Finally, parents in both cultures converged in\ntheir preferences for the personality supra-domain, but they\ndiverged for the other traits supra-domain. The latter difference\ncan be partially explained by the difference in preferences for\nsimilarity over religious and ethnic background. The former\nconvergence can be interpreted to indicate that the personality\nof a prospective in-law is of high fitness relevance for parents\nin both contexts.\nConsistent with our theoretical framework, our findings sug-\ngest that parents share the same basic in-law preferences, but\nthese preferences adjust to the local conditions. They also sug-\ngest that personality is the most important concern for parents\nin both prospective daughters- and sons-in-law in a postindus-\ntrial context. Still, more cross-cultural work and replication is\nrequired in order to reach more definite conclusions.\nWang and Apostolou 9\nThis work is not without limitations. One advantage of this\nresearch was that it was online, which gave privacy to individ-\nuals who, in turn, were more likely to give honest answers\n(Kreuter, Presser, & Tourangeau, 2008). The drawback was,\nhowever, that the sample is not representative of the popula-\ntion, as people who were younger, more educated, and more\nopen-minded were likely to be overrepresented (Ross,\nM\u00e5nsson, Daneback, Cooper, & Tikkanen, 2005). Future\nstudies need to attempt to replicate these findings using\ndifferent research methods. Moreover, this is a self-report\nstudy, so there is the possibility that people may behave\ndifferently from the way they have indicated here, when the\nsituation in question actually arises.\nLast but not least, for the purposes of this study, we have\nemployed an instrument that was developed in a different\ncultural context. Thus, although this instrument is inclusive,\nthere is the possibility that it does not capture preferences for\ntraits which may have only local relevance. In particular,\nthere may be traits which are important for Chinese parents,\nbut which were not present in our instrument, because it has\nbeen developed in a different culture, where they were not\nimportant. Future qualitative research that can construct an\ninstrument specific for the Chinese cultural context can\naddress this limitation.\nStudying in-law preferences, especially in a non-Western\ncontext, has received little attention from researchers. The cur-\nrent article contributes toward closing this gap in our knowl-\nedge by providing evidence about in-law preferences and their\ncontingencies in China, as well as differences and similarities\nbetween Greek-Cypriot and Chinese parents. However, more\nresearch is required in order to fully understand in-law prefer-\nences and how they vary across cultures.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study\nwas supported by the Social Science Fund of the Faculty of Social\nDevelopment and Public Policy, Fudan University.\nReferences\nApostolou, M.
