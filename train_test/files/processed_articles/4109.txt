It aims to\nanalyze how compulsory hospitalization of the youth has\nbeen used as a tool for public security and violence preven-\ntion. We attempt to problematize discourses about protection\nand care that have surrounded compulsory hospitalization by\nevidencing its use as a control and punishment mechanism\nthat increases the social vulnerability of young drug users.\nFor such problematization, we have relied on theoretical\nand methodological tools of social psychology from a post-\nstructuralist perspective, particularly related to Michel\nFoucault's thought. We have considered the author's analysis\nof discourses and the emergence of knowledges in articula-\ntion with mechanisms and technologies of power. We discuss\nthe emergence of the \"addicted youth\" as a social problem\nthat has invited psychology and law to produce a range of\nknowledges and strategies of intervention and management\nof this population. This affects both the conduction of public\npolicies and the ways through which the juveniles are sup-\nposed to see and relate with themselves and the others.\nThe research has been based on the analysis of lawsuits\ninvolving juveniles who were consigned to psychiatric insti-\ntutions for drug addiction treatment as a protection measure\nin the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil. Through the\nanalysis of documents, we have attempted to identify the\nrelationships established between fields of knowledge and\nmechanisms of power that contribute to the maintenance of\ncertain truths about the \"addicted youth\" which have sup-\nported the legitimization and updating of the compulsory\nhospitalization strategy.\nThe analysis of the materials has evidenced discourses\nthat have circumscribed young drug users and constructed\nthis population as potentially dangerous subjects as well as a\npopulation category at risk. In this sense, we point out how\ncompulsory hospitalization has emerged out of the lawsuits\nas a tool for prevention of juvenile delinquency, as most of\nthe reasons for hospitalization are not linked to health issues,\nbut rather to the field of public security.\nThe Construction of the Addicted Youth\nas a \"New\" Social Problem\nTen years ago, there was no case in the State. We estimate that\nthere are 50 to 60 thousand crack users nowadays.\nThis statement by the former Health Officer of the State of Rio\nGrande do Sul1 is representative of the ways in which the rela-\ntionship between youth and drug use has been presented as a\n1Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil\nCorresponding Author:\nCarolina dos Reis, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Rua Cap\u00e3o\nda Canoa, 20/201, Bairro Ipanema, Porto Alegre, RS, Cep\nEmail: carolinadosreis@gmail.com\nPreventing Juvenile Delinquency:\nCompulsory Hospitalization as a Public\nSecurity Tool\nCarolina dos Reis1 and Neuza Maria de F\u00e1tima Guareschi1\n Keywords\njuvenile delinquency, drug use, psychiatric compulsory hospitalization, public security, risk\n2 SAGE Open\nnew problem to be faced by different social actors. Ten years\nago, crack was hardly found and sold in the State, and the\npopulation was significantly smaller; however, the even rarer\nmental health services intended to assist children and adoles-\ncents were already overcrowded with users of lolo2 and other\nnarcotics. Hence, neither the existence of a large number of\ndrug users in the State, which has undoubtedly become even\nlarger, nor the need for health services to assist such popula-\ntion can be seen as something new. Therefore, it is strange that\nyouth drug use has emerged as a huge problem affecting soci-\nety today and demanding action from the State government as\nwell as answers from some fields of knowledge.\nSilva, Hartmann, Scisleski, and Pires (2008), aiming to\nevidence changes in what has been defined as pathology in\nchildren and adolescents, analyzed records of S\u00e3o Pedro\nPsychiatric Hospital3 patients from its foundation in 1884 to\n1937. They also performed a comparative analysis address-\ning the present situation and concluded that drug addiction is\nnow the main symptom found in hospitalization records, and\npoverty and referral by the Judiciary are prevailing charac-\nteristics of the hospitalization processes. Poverty and this\njudicial policing device have remained constant over the\nyears and are still found in the hospitalization procedure,\nthus evidencing that the relation between juridical and psy-\nchiatric knowledges about childhood and youth has a long\ntradition. Hospitalization has appeared as a mechanism to\nguarantee the public order and ensure the organization and\nhygienization of poverty: There are records of children and\nadolescents hospitalized because of something known as\n\"behavior disorders,\" rather than for mental health.\nIt is not by chance, then, that the emergence of this new\nproblem is associated with the spread of the image of \"drug\naddicted youth\" linked to violence caused by lack of emo-\ntional control, drug abuse, or the need to obtain money or\nother things that may be used to buy more narcotics.\nFurthermore, this young population, marked by drug addic-\ntion, has been described as socially vulnerable and character-\nized as either victims or protagonists of such social problem.\nIn addition, drug-related criminality became one of the most\ndiscussed topics on the last decade, comprehending both pre-\nventive and repressive actions, as well as costs and benefits\nimplied in social protection.\nFreitas (2009) has pointed out that increased juvenile vio-\nlence and drug use often make us seek for their foundational\ncause. The effect of this is that experts and productions by\nfields of knowledge such as psychology, psychiatry, psy-\nchopedagogy, social service, and law, among others, by pro-\nviding explanations, contribute to the very construction of the\nproblem they attempt to elucidate. This perspective of knowl-\nedge production is based on the belief that there is a nature to\nbe cured and recovered in those young individuals.\nIn an attempt to rehabilitate the subject regarded as devi-\nant, psychology and law have ended up contributing to the\nconstruction of a way of being a drug user subject who is\nmarked by an alleged \"drug addicted/dependent/vicious/\nviolent\" identity. This is how young drug users have been\ncharacterized as a big social problem, and these are the strat-\negies designed to solve it. As we stated before, although vio-\nlence and youth drug use are nothing new, this problem now\nemerges as a novelty. Therefore, innovation is not in this\nissue itself, but rather in the relationships established with it.\nWe emphasize that, even though the meanings attributed to\n\"drug addicted youth\" are historically marked, some fields of\nknowledge that have corroborated the construction of such\nmeanings try to delete historicity by attributing an essential-\nist character to their statements as discoveries of a nature that\nhas been the basis of a social and individual problem rather\nthan a discourse that constructs the drug user subject (Reis,\nMethod\nResearch Context\nTo discuss such issues, we considered a research that ana-\nlyzed lawsuits filed in different cities in Rio Grande do Sul\nagainst juveniles who were consigned to psychiatric institu-\ntions for drug addiction treatment as a protection measure.\nInstruments\nFourteen lawsuits involving 12- to 18-year-old female and\nmale subjects were analyzed from March to July 2011 in two\nbig cities in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, which have special-\nized courts focused on the protection of children and adoles-\ncents' rights; hence, cases addressing this specific issue\nwould be more easily found. The cities were chosen due to\nthe fact that they have special courts for lawsuits related to\nthe protection of children and adolescents' rights, which\nfacilitated the search for court cases that address this specific\nissue. The criterion used to establish the amount of lawsuits\nto be analyzed was data saturation (Bauer, 2002). This crite-\nrion emerged during the analysis of the lawsuits and has been\nregarded as an important analyzer on its own merit. Through\nthe documents--written by professionals from health, social\ncare, and education services--that compose the lawsuits, the\nlives of those young drug users have been translated into a\ntechnical language, which is characterized by writing stan-\ndardization and repeated use of some explanatory models.\nMoreover, certain selectivity marks the episodes of the\nyouths' lives in the documents, which both highlight actions\nregarded as drawbacks in their behavior and justify the need\nfor other hospitalizations. As the cases under review were\nnot bringing any new data to the research process, this situa-\ntion was taken as data saturation.\nProcedures\nThe analysis was conducted by the authors as part of a mas-\nter's research in social and institutional psychology. The\ndos Reis and Guareschi 3\nlawsuits were consulted at Youth Courts in both cities. We\nselected lawsuits involving juveniles in the age group previ-\nously mentioned who had compulsory hospitalization deter-\nmined and no formal record of misdemeanor. We attempted\nto focus on practices used in the name of care. Therefore, we\ntried to distantiate from those directly linked to punitive\npractices of the social-educational system. The documents\nwere randomly selected from lawsuits with the described\ncharacteristics that were available in the Courts during the\nperiod under consideration.\nThe documents were examined and manually copied at\nthe Courts, as neither the removal nor the reproduction of the\nmaterials was authorized. The excerpts from lawsuits pre-\nsented in this study were modified to avoid their identifica-\ntion, preserve the subjects and their family's anonymity, and\nrespect judicial secrecy. Likewise, the professionals'identity,\nand specificities of both the institutions involved and the cit-\nies in which the materials were collected have also been pro-\ntected. This research was approved by the Research Ethics\nCommittee.\nAnalysis of Materials\nThe analysis was conducted from a Foucauldian perspective,\ninspired by the analysis of discourse and the emergence of\nknowledge in its articulation with power mechanisms and\ntechnologies. We tried to identify relationships between\nfields of knowledge and mechanisms of power that affect the\nmaintenance of certain truths about the so-called \"drug\naddicted youth\" that have supported the legitimization and\nupdating of the compulsory hospitalization strategy.\nParticularly, we attempted to highlight the articulations\nestablished between the fields of health and justice that have\nprovided the compulsory hospitalization practice with both\nfoundation and acceptability.\nTo do that, we analyzed all the documents4 that compose\nthe lawsuits by considering the following questions: how and\nwhen did the drug use by adolescents start to be described as\na social problem? Which professionals, fields of knowledge,\nand institutions have been called to speak about, guide, and\nsolve the drug use problem? Which strategies, procedures,\nand techniques have been created to solve the so-called prob-\nlem? How is it related to Brazilian political, economic, and\ncultural issues?\nBy looking more carefully at the contents of the lawsuits\nand the documents that compose them, we noticed the exis-\ntence of a strategic relationship among the juridical, psychi-\natric, and pedagogical fields which contributes to the\nformation of a \"protection network\"5 around different aspects\nof juveniles' lives. In this sense, by examining the docu-\nments, we sought to problematize this provision of protec-\ntion and care by considering the contradictions that pervade\nthe maintenance of discourses about protection in the\nresearch materials. This led us to ask additional questions\nsuch as \"What do these lawsuits make us say about those\njuveniles?\" and \"What kinds of practices do they mobilize\naround such population?\"\nPresentation and Analysis of Results\nThe presentation of research findings includes a detailed\ndescription of the lawsuit structure and its contents, as well\nas excerpts of the lawsuits. We understand that the very\nstructure of the lawsuit produces a certain way of talking\nabout those youths and their families that highlights their dif-\nficulties and problems and exclude the healthy and positive\nrelations they have established along their lives.\nThe Admission\nThe lawsuits under consideration, in general, are filed by\neither the Department of Public Defense or the Public\nProsecutor's Office--Childhood and Youth Division. In the\nfirst case, the adolescent's family voluntarily requests assis-\ntance from the justice system along the hospitalization pro-\ncess.The family regards this as necessary when the adolescent\nrefuses treatment or there is shortage of beds in mental hos-\npitals and the family cannot find an adequate place for treat-\nment in the city health network.\nThe admission to hospital occurs through the Department\nof Public Defense6 if the family is unable to afford the cost of\na lawyer; in this case, the family has to prove its eligibility by\npresenting a determination of indigence or an unemployment\ncertification. The Public Prosecutor's Office, in turn, as the\nagency in charge of protecting children and adolescents, can\nalso request public defense services. In general, the Child\nProtection Council or other services belonging to the health\nand social assistance network refer cases of violation of\nrights to the Public Prosecutor's Office. Besides that,\nalthough the lawsuit is filed by the Department of Public\nDefense, the intervention by the Public Prosecutor's Office is\nalso required to ensure the lawsuit validity. Thus, the pro-\ncesses are initiated by the statement of financial failure of the\nfamily and their admitted inability to take care of the\nadolescent.\nThe Lawsuits\nPleadings\nA lawsuit consists of different procedures and stages. First,\nthe Department of Public Defense or the Public Prosecutor's\nOffice writes a document, which is composed of three parts\ncomprehending\na. Description of the basic facts of the case: it is the\nconstruction of the case, or maybe a characterization\nof the situations presented as a case. It is a summary\nof certain points of the narrative of the adolescent's\nand his or her family's lives in what makes them the\n4 SAGE Open\nobject of Justice and State action. Reports of viola-\ntion of rights in the subject's lives are highlighted.\nTherefore, when we wonder what those lawsuits say\nabout the juveniles, it is possible to point out vio-\nlence, neglect, abandonment, aggression, absence,\nfailures, abuses, and misdemeanors that would jus-\ntify the insertion of that family in the Justice System\nand even their insertion in multiple State protection\ninstitutions, which comprehend social assistance,\nhealth, and education, among others. In general, this\nfirst part of the lawsuit contains literal excerpts taken\nfrom appraisals and reports written by physicians,\npsychologists, advisors, and social assistants. These\nexcerpts, which are displaced from their original\ncontexts, stress how indispensable and urgent the\nintervention of the Judiciary in that subject and fam-\nily is.\nThe juvenile is drug addicted and uses crack, which potentializes\nhis aggressive behavior. Besides that, he steals objects to sell\nand obtain drugs. He is totally out of control, thus risking his\nlife and his relatives. The family life is unbearable. His\nguardian has to stay permanently at home to prevent him from\nselling her belongings. According to her, the juvenile becomes\naggressive when he does not have money to buy drugs. While\nunder the effect of the substance, he becomes extremely violent\nand aggressive to his family, both verbally and physically. The\njuvenile does not accept to undergo voluntary treatment, and\nsays he is not a drug user. Although he does not acknowledge his\nstate of hopelessness and extreme necessity, in an extreme lack\nof control, his life as well as his relatives are at risk. His\nhospitalization is indispensable and, after detoxification, he\nmust be referred to a drug rehabilitation centre. (Excerpt from\npleadings written by the prosecutor)\nThe picture shows violence, aggression, and lack of con-\ntrol, a desperate family that does not know what to do and\nask for the State assistance. There is a warning of early mis-\ndemeanors, such as stealing family belongings. The word\nalready often appears in the lawsuits to warn of the develop-\nment of harmful behaviors from a premonitory perspective.\nIt is noteworthy that the adolescents are subjects in development;\nthat is why removing them from the environment in which they\nare becomes imperative e urgent. (Excerpt from Pleadings\nwritten by the prosecutor)\nThe mother was visibly under the influence of psychoactive\nsubstances when she was admitted to hospital, and she has been\ninvolved in prostitution and drug abuse since she was 8 years\nold. She had already been hospitalized and should have gone to\na therapeutical community where her son could stay with her,\nbut she fled to avoid losing her boyfriend. As a teenager, she\nhad been using drugs and wandering on the street. She was\nreferred to shelter and medical treatment for drug addiction. Her\nyounger brother, who is under the tutelage of their oldest brother,\nhas already shown behavior problems. (Report addressing the\ncustody of the baby of a young drug user--signed by a\npsychologist, a social worker, and the coordinator of the service)\nIt has been three years since the teenagers quit school. They\nhave refused health care. Their mother exerts no control over her\nchildren. One of them has already committed offenses against\nproperty. They remain on the streets and occasionally return\nhome to eat and sleep. (Excerpt from pleadings written by the\nprosecutor)\nThe notion of risk is constructed not only in relation to the\njuvenile's life; this risk, which can still be limited to the fam-\nily, may be potentially spread to the public sphere.\nThe teenagers were in the shelter due to parental neglect. Since\n2007, they had been living on the street, begging and\ncompulsively using crack. At home, they were attacked by\ntheir mother, who was also a drug addict. They were\nhospitalized and returned to the streets, and the outpatient\ntreatment was discontinued. The institutional attempts to\nreinsert the adolescents in their family as a measure of\nprotection have been unsuccessful due their addiction, which\ncauses them to return to the streets. The therapeutical plan has\nindicated the necessity of detoxification treatment in a\nTherapeutical Community for a period of at least six months\nand return to their grandparents' house. Both girls have already\nundergone outpatient treatment, which has proved to be\ninsufficient. (Excerpt from pleadings written by the prosecutor)\nThe second case evidences a story of family failure, and\nthe home environment appears as an unbearable space that\ncauses the adolescents to go to the streets and use drugs. The\nfamily is shown as a driving element leading those juveniles\nto drug abuse. However, the family is not the focus of the\nintervention; in this story, it appears as a symptom, rather\nthan a cause.\nAs Donzelot (1986) pointed out, interventions in those\nfamilies have become a real fight between services and users.\nThere is always the assumption that the family is trying to\nfool the professionals and they are always willing to show\nthat they are not naive.\nThe mother spoke the truth under pressure. She must be\nmentally impaired due to long-term drug abuse. (Statement\ntaken by the social worker at the Justice System)\nThe adolescent gave birth to a boy. She arrived visibly altered\nand was aggressive, in poor hygienic conditions, without\nidentification documents, and refused to give information. She\narrived with another woman, who claimed that she only knew\nthat the girl was a crack user; she was responsible for the\nadolescent's hospitalization. The woman said that the girl had\nmedical care during pregnancy but had no proof of it. The\nadolescent said that the woman was her sister and would take\ncare of the child; contradictorily, the woman said she was just\na friend. The child was born with congenital syphilis. (Report\nprovided by the hospital in which a young drug user gave birth\nto her child--signed by the psychologist and the social worker)\ndos Reis and Guareschi 5\nThe doctor said that the boy wanted to be admitted to the\nPsychiatric Clinic just because it has a swimming pool. He\nsuggested that the boy should go to a shelter, saying it was not a\ncase for admission. (Report from the Social Assistance Service,\ndenouncing the attitude of a doctor who refused to hospitalize an\nadolescent--signed by a psychologist, a social educator and the\ncoordinator of the Service)\nb. Presentation of rights: it points out the rights that\nhave been violated and need to be guaranteed. In this\npart, the right to health and some excerpts from both\nthe Federal Constitution of Brazil and the Child and\nAdolescent Statute are presented to give legal sup-\nport to the intervention.\nArt. 227. It behooves the family, the society and the State to\nguarantee children, adolescents and youth, with total priority,\nthe right to life, health, food, education, leisure, work, culture,\ndignity, freedom and family and community life, besides\nprotecting them from all kinds of neglect, discrimination,\nexploitation, violence, cruelty and oppression. (Brasil.\nPresid\u00eancia da Rep\u00fablica. Casa Civil, 1988). (Excerpt from\npleadings written by the prosecutor)\nArt. 7 Children and adolescents have the right to protection, life\nand health by means of effectuation of public social policies\nthat allow birth and development with health and harmony,\nwith dignified living conditions. (Brasil. Presid\u00eancia da\nRep\u00fablica, 1990). (Excerpt from pleadings written by the\nprosecutor)\nOn one hand, Article 227 of the Federal Constitution is\nused to justify the right to health by means of compulsory\nhospitalization; on the other hand, this kind of health protec-\ntion puts other rights at risk, such as the right to freedom and\nfamily and community living. This implies that, among those\nrights, there is a \"greater good,\" which is to keep biological\nhealth, despite the forms of discrimination, violence, cruelty,\nand oppression that the compulsory hospitalization may gen-\nerate. If the guarantee of constitutional rights were the only\nissue at stake, we should be discussing programs of compul-\nsory housing, compulsory employment, compulsory nour-\nishment, compulsory culture, and compulsory leisure, as\nmentioned by Dartiu Xavier (2011).7 Health is a right, but\ncompulsory hospitalization is not; rather, it is a duty for those\njuveniles.\nc. Presentation of requests: it states the objective of the\nlawsuit. The Judiciary is required to authorize\ncompulsory hospitalization by means of law enforcement, if\nnecessary. Afterwards, referral to a drug rehabilitation centre\nfor a six-month stay, at least, with law enforcement, if\nnecessary. The patient should stay under medical custody until\nhis rehabilitation. (Excerpt from pleadings written by the\nprosecutor)\nrequest for search and seizure to preserve the adolescent's\nphysical and psychological integrity and assess his mental\ncondition. If the need exists, hospitalization for substance abuse\ntreatment should be immediately determined. The officer may\nrequire assistance from the juvenile's mother or enforce the\nlaw. (Excerpt from pleadings written by the prosecutor)\nWe should highlight that the possibility of using law\nenforcement is mentioned in the presentation of requests.\nThis characterizes the adolescent as a potentially dangerous\nsubject, but it is also evidence of authoritative restriction of\nfreedom exerted on those subjects. Somehow, the adoles-\ncents are expected to react to the compulsory hospitalization,\nbut the meaning attributed to this reaction implies the impos-\nsibility of objection beforehand. Such backlash just reaffirms\ntheir loss of control over drug use and non-"
