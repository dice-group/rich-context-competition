This visual motion pattern, called optic flow, contributes to the perception\nand control of the direction in which we are heading during self-motion (cf. Gibson,\n1950). Optimal optic flow creates a compelling perception of self-motion, even if the\nobserver's body is actually static. This illusory perception of self-movement induced by a\nvisual stimulus is known as vection (e.g., Brandt, Dichgans, & Koenig, 1973; Palmisano,\nAllison, Schira, & Barry, 2015). Broad empirical knowledge regarding vection has\naccumulated, and the research field has shown remarkable divergence (cf. Palmisano et al.,\nVarious motor responses, which may relate to the control of self-motion, are induced by\noptic flow in very young individuals; infants show postural compensation in response to optic\nflow (e.g., Lee & Aronson, 1974), and even 3-day-old neonates show similar compensatory\npatterns in head movements (Jouen, Lepecq, Gapenne, & Bertenthal, 2000). However,\nprevious research has shown that vection (the subjective experience of self-motion induced\nby visual stimuli) seems to change over time. Lepecq, Giannopulu, and Baudonniere (1995)\nshowed that 7- to 11-year-old children experienced vection under experimental conditions.\nMore recently, Shirai, Seno, and Morohashi (2012) indicated that early school-age children\n(6\u00ad12 year olds) reported vection with significantly shorter latency and stronger saturation\nthan adults, even when the children and adults observed the same visual displays. Similar\nresults were obtained in slightly older children. Shirai, Imura, Tamura, and Seno (2014)\ntested children in junior high school (13\u00ad15 year olds) and found that they experienced\nsignificantly stronger vection than did adults. The fact that school-age children tend to\nexperience more rapid or stronger vection than adults do suggests that the developmental\nchange in vection continues beyond childhood.\nAlthough the latency or saturation of vection changes significantly from childhood to\nadulthood, it is unclear whether other aspects of vection follow a similar developmental\ntrend. Previous studies reported that the experience of vection can be modulated\nsignificantly by specific changes in visual stimuli, such as changes in direction of the\nstimuli. For instance, vection is typically more easily induced by radially contracting visual\nmotion than by expanding motion (e.g., Andersen, 1986; Apthorp, Nagle, & Palmisano,\nShibata, 2005; Seno, Ito, Sunaga, & Nakamura, 2010) and by upward than by downward\nmotion (Ito & Takano, 2004; Seya, Shinoda, & Nakaura, 2015). In addition, horizontal\ntranslational (rightward and leftward) vection is weaker than vertical (upward and\nMohler, Schulte-Pelkum, & Bu\n\u00a8 lthoff, 2009). That is, changes in the direction of visual\nmotion patterns can alter the vection experience, even if other physical properties of visual\nmotion patterns, such as mean speed or pattern size, are constant. It is unknown whether\n2 i-Perception\nsuch asymmetries in vection are also observed during childhood; therefore, investigating the\ndevelopment of such asymmetries in vection is an important task to aid in the understanding\nof the entire developmental process of vection.\nThe primary aim of the current study was to examine whether asymmetry in vection with a\nradial expansion or contraction visual motion pattern is observed in school-age children.\nIn addition, we sought to replicate the asymmetry of the expansion or contraction flow in\nvection. Inconsistent results regarding expansion or contraction asymmetry in vection have\nbeen reported. Although many studies have reported the advantage of contraction flow (e.g.,\n2005; Seno et al., 2010), others have reported an advantage of expansion flow (Reinhardt-\nRutland, 1982) or no significant asymmetry between expansion and contraction flows\nMethods\nEthics Statement\nThe current study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Psychological Research at\nNiigata University. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the principles of\nthe Declaration of Helsinki.\nParticipants\nWe included three age-groups: younger children (6\u00ad8 years old), older children (9\u00ad11 years old),\nand adults (20\u00ad22 years old). We initially tested 60 participants (20 in each age-group) and\nscreened out several participants that were extreme outliers according to the following criterion:\nparticipants with a mean individual value greater (or smaller) than the mean \u00c6 3 standard\ndeviations (SD) of their age-group for any of the three measurements (latency, duration, or\nsaturation; see the Procedure section). As a result, two younger children and one older child\nwere excluded from the final analysis (for details, see online data https://nyu.databrary.org/\nvolume/468). No participants in the adult group met the exclusion criterion. The final sample\nwas composed of data obtained from 18 younger children (11 females, mean age \u00bc 7.84 years,\ncorrected-to-normal vision; none had a history of visual or vestibular system disease.\nApparatus and Stimuli\nThe experiment was conducted in a dark chamber (width \u00bc 1.8 m, height \u00bc 1.8 m,\ndepth \u00bc 5.4 m). Visual stimuli were generated by a computer (MB543J/A; Apple,\nCupertino, CA, USA) displayed on a 50-in. video screen (Vsync \u00bc 60 Hz, resolution \u00bc\nCosta Mesa, CA, USA). The computer was placed outside the experimental chamber and\noperated by an experimenter during the experiments. The video screen and projector were\nplaced in the chamber. Participants sat on a chair in front of the screen (viewing\ndistance \u00bc 57 cm) without any supportive equipment, such as a head or chin rest. The size\nof the visual stimulus was 102 in width and 76 in height. The visual stimuli were almost\nidentical to those used by Seno et al. (2010) and Shirai et al. (2012) with the exception that\nnot only an expanding optic flow pattern (the same stimulus as that of previous studies) but\nShirai et al. 3\nalso a contraction optic flow pattern was used. The expanding (or contracting) optic flow\npattern was composed of 16,000 dots randomly positioned inside a simulated cube\n(20 \u00c2 20 \u00c2 20 m) in which the virtual viewpoint of an observer moved forward (or\nbackward) at 16 m/s. All stimuli were created using OpenGL (https://www.opengl.org/).\nOn the video screen, 1,240 randomly positioned dots per frame appeared. The dots\nvirtually formed no density gradient. This was partially achieved by reusing dots that\nmoved off the video screen (dead dots) to refill areas of the screen with the lowest dot\ndensity. Therefore, the number of dots over space-time was maintained constant (i.e.,\n1,240 dots in a frame). This means that there were fewer dots at greater distances from the\nsimulated viewpoint. In addition, we varied the lifetime of each dot according to its distance\nfrom the viewpoint; dots farther from the viewpoint were given shorter lifetimes. Thus, dots\nthat appeared to be at a greater distance in the simulated three-dimensional space tended to\ncluster around the central area in the projector screen. The shorter lifetime given to more\ndistant dots in the three-dimensional space resulted in the more frequent death of dots in the\ncentral area of the projector screen and contributed to respawning the dead dots in areas with\nthe lowest dot density. Therefore, in theory, there were no static depth cues available from the\ndot-density gradient, and the only moving depth cue was motion parallax. Each dot was of\nconstant size on the screen and subtended a visual angle of 0.03 to 0.05, depending on its\neccentricity on the screen.\nProcedure\nWritten informed consent was obtained from all participants (and their parents in the case of\nchildren) before starting the experiments. All participants engaged in two experimental\nconditions: expansion and contraction. Five trials were conducted for each condition; thus,\neach participant took part in 10 trials. Trials in the expansion and contracting conditions\nwere conducted in an alternating pattern for each participant, and the order of the conditions\nwas counterbalanced across the participants in each age-group. In the expansion\n(or contraction) condition, each trial consisted of the presentation of an expanding (or\ncontracting) flow pattern lasting for 40 s. The participants were instructed to fixate on the\ncenter of the screen during each trial while remaining relaxed. No fixation point was\npresented.\nThree measurements regarding vection (latency, duration, and saturation) were adopted in\nthe current study. Participants were instructed to press one of the assigned buttons on a\ncomputer mouse connected to the computer when they perceived self-motion during each\ntrial, so that the latency of vection and the cumulative duration of vection in each trial could\nbe recorded. After each trial, the participants were asked to rate the saturation of vection\nusing a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS; 100 mm in length) printed on paper. The observers drew\na short orthogonal line segment on the VAS to estimate the saturation of vection.\nThe distance (in mm) from the left edge of the VAS to the intersection was regarded as\nthe rated saturation; thus, a longer distance indicated higher saturation. All participants were\ninstructed that if they did not feel their body move, they should draw a short vertical line at\nthe left edge of the VAS, while if they felt their body move like real locomotion, they should\ndraw a short line at the right edge of the VAS as a benchmark rating. We did not use any\nstandard stimuli for this estimate of subjective vection saturation, as previous studies (Shirai\net al., 2012, 2014) reported that this method is appropriate for children of similar ages to\nthose who participated in the current study.\nTwo experimenters, the main experimenter (S. E.) and an assistant, were involved in each\nexperiment. The main experimenter was outside the experimental chamber and managed\n4 i-Perception\nthe personal computer, selecting and running the appropriate experimental program for each\ntrial. The assistant stood behind the participant inside the experimental chamber during each\nexperimental trial and supervised the participant's engagement. At the beginning of each\ntrial, the assistant confirmed that the participant was looking at the projector screen as\ninstructed and was holding the computer mouse. After each trial, the assistant gave the\nparticipant a VAS and a pen and then confirmed that the participant marked the analog\nscale as instructed. All communications between the main experimenter and the participants\nduring experiments were made via the assistant (e.g., if the participant wanted to take a short\nrest before starting the next trial, she or he asked the assistant, who then asked the main\nexperimenter to delay the next trial). It should be noted that the assistant was nai\u00a8ve regarding\nthe purpose and the hypothesis of the current study. Thus, possible experimenter effects were\nminimized in the current experimental setting.\nResults\nThe mean latency for vection in each age-group is shown in Figure 1(a). We conducted a two-\nway mixed analysis of variance (age vs. flow direction) for the latency data and found that\nFigure 1. Experimental results.

First, the significant main effect of flow direction\nand the lack of a significant interaction between age and flow direction in the latency data\nindicate that the onset of vection was faster under the presentation of contracting optic flow\nthan that of expanding optic flow in all age-groups. That is, the asymmetry of expansion or\net al., 2010) was replicated even in school-age children. The second finding is that, overall, the\nchildren reported significantly shorter or higher latency or saturation than the adults did.\nWe discuss the two main findings in the following sections.\nPossibility of Experimenter Effects in the Current Results\nOne might be concerned about the possibility that participants' responses were affected by\nthe experimenters' expectations in the current study. This would render the current findings\nmainly a product of artifice related to the experimenter effect (e.g., if the participants were\nsusceptible to the experimenters' demands, they may have endorsed the asymmetric responses\nin vection; children, in particular, may have been more susceptible to the experimenters'\ndemands, and their reports of more rapid or stronger vection than adults may reflect this\nphenomenon).\nIt should be noted that, because the assistant who directly communicated with the\nparticipants during experiments was nai\u00a8ve regarding the purpose and the hypothesis of the\ncurrent study, such an experimenter effect would be somewhat reduced under the current\nexperimental setting (for details, see the Procedure section). In addition, a comparison\nbetween the current study and a previous study that investigated automatic motor\nresponses to optic flow in children and adults is relevant to this concern. Baumberger,\n6 i-Perception\nIsableu, and Fluckiger (2004) measured postural sway in response to approaching or receding\nground flow patterns in children and adults. They reported that, overall, children showed\nsignificantly different postural sway patterns in response to the onset and the offset of the\nflow patterns than did adults. Specifically, the children showed significantly longer or shorter\nlatency to the onset or offset of the approaching flow than the adults did. Moreover,\nthe children showed asymmetrical developmental trends in the sway latency between the\napproaching and receding flows. Furthermore, there were significant differences in\nthe sway latencies in response to both the onset and offset of the approaching (but not the\nreceding) flow among both children and adults. Although the current study and that of\nBaumberger et al. (2004) used different measures (verbally instructed responses vs.\nautomatically generated motor actions), both studies reported similar results: Children and\nadults responded significantly differently to flow patterns that represented self-motion, and\nresponses to expanding or contracting (or approaching or receding) flows were asymmetric.\nThe similarity between the current results (based on verbally instructed responses) and the\nresults of Baumberger et al. (2004, based on the automatically produced motor actions)\nimplies that both sets of findings reflect a common developmental trend in the mechanisms\nfor processing optic flow and self-motion perception or control in childhood. Thus, although\nthe possibility of experimenter effects on the current results cannot be completely ruled out, it\nis plausible that the current results mainly reflect the developmental process of the\nmechanisms related to processing optic flow and the perception or control of self-motion.\nExpansion or Contraction Flow Asymmetry in Vection Observed in Latency Data\nIn the current study, significant asymmetry in the expansion or contraction flow in vection\nwas found in the latency measure but not in the other two measures, duration and saturation.\nIt is possible that, due to the finding's reliance on only one of the three measures, the\nobserved asymmetry is not a compelling result. Indeed, several previous studies with adult\nparticipants reported significant expansion or contraction asymmetry in vection as measured\nby more than one of the three measures (e.g., Bubka et al., 2008; Seno et al., 2010).\nThe fact that the asymmetry was observed only in the latency data in the current study\nsuggests that our experimental procedure, specialized for investigating children's vection,\nmight be best for tapping expansion or contraction flow asymmetry using latency but not\nduration and saturation. For instance, because young children are not tolerant of long\nexperimental sessions, we adopted a relatively short presentation time (40 s) for each\nexperimental trial. On the other hand, Seno et al. (2010), who reported longer duration\nand stronger saturation of vection for a contracting than for an expanding flow, used a\nlonger visual stimulus presentation time (60 s). The presentation time used in the current\nstudy may have been long enough to pick up the asymmetry in latency data but too short to\nproduce pronounced differences in duration and saturation between the expansion and\ncontraction flows. Interestingly, another previous study (Bubka et al., 2008) succeeded in\nfinding expansion or contraction asymmetry not only in latency but also in saturation using a\nmuch shorter presentation time (30 s) than was used in the current study. This might be due\nto the use of a more sensitive experimental procedure than ours for estimating vection\nsaturation; participants in Bubka et al. estimated the saturation of vection in real time\nusing an analog slider during each experimental trial, whereas the participants in the\ncurrent study estimated vection saturation using analog visual scales after each trial. It is\nplausible that estimating vection saturation in real time by handling an analog slider would\noffer a more sensitive and direct way for adult participants to perform this task (although\nyoung children seem to have more difficulty engaging in such complex tasks than adults do).\nShirai et al. 7\nMoreover, inconsistency among the three independent measures (latency, duration, and\nsaturation) has often been reported in vection studies; thus, it is believed that the three\nmeasures tap into different aspects of the vection experience (cf. Seno et al., 2017). For\ninstance, vection latency is thought to represent the time required to resolve visual\u00ad\nvestibular conflict (i.e., visual information representing motion by the observer vs.\nvestibular information identifying the observer's static state; e.g., Palmisano, Allison, Kim,\nrequired to suppress the default visual processing regarding object motion before vection\nemerges (e.g., Palmisano et al., 2015). Duration is often thought to be an index of the strength\nor resilience of vection, with longer durations representing stronger and more resilient vection\nexperiences. Although saturation is also thought to be an index of vection strength, it may\nreflect other aspects of subjective experience (e.g., convincingness, intensity, and realism) and\nmay be more susceptible to experimenter expectations and observer cognitions than are\nlatency and duration (e.g., Palmisano & Chan, 2004).\nIn summary, although the current experimental procedure, which was mainly designed\nfor children, was useful for examining expansion or contraction asymmetry related to one of\nthe several aspects of vection, namely, latency, the procedure may not be optimal for\ninvestigating asymmetry related to the other aspects of vection (i.e., duration and\nsaturation). A young-child-friendly experimental procedure for measuring vection\nsaturation in real time during the presentation of a visual stimulus will be necessary in\nfuture investigations.\nRelationship Between Expansion or Contraction Asymmetry in Vection\nand Flow Sensitivity\nIn this section, we discuss the possible relationship between the known asymmetric detection\nsensitivity to expansion or contraction flow and the similar vection asymmetry observed in\nthe current latency data.\nMany studies have reported that the human visual system has asymmetric sensitivity to\nradial expansion or contraction flow, although the reported results are mixed; some\nstudies have indicated an advantage in the detection of expansion flow (e.g., Gilmore,\nTakeuchi, 1997), whereas others have indicated an advantage in the detection of\ncontraction flow (Edwards & Badcock, 1993; Edwards & Ibbotson, 2007). Although the\nreason for the inconsistent results regarding asymmetric sensitivity to radial expansion or\ncontraction remains unclear, sensitivities to expansion and contraction may be\nindependently adaptive visual functions that contribute to detecting and processing\necologically important information contained in radial optic flows (cf. Shirai,\nKanazawa, & Yamaguchi, 2006). For instance, because expansion flow represents an\nobject approaching or an observer's own forward movement, expansion detection seems\nto have obvious value, namely, in the possibility of avoiding or intercepting an\napproaching object or of controlling the direction of self-motion. On the other hand,\ncontraction flow represents an object receding from an observer or the observer's own\nbackward body movement. The advantage of detecting contraction may be the\ncontribution it affords to guidance of hand movements during reaching (Edwards &\nBadcock, 1993) or secure adjustment to backward body tilt (Edwards & Ibbotson,\n2007). The asymmetry of radial expansion or contraction flow detection has been\nobserved even in the first few months of life (advantage of expansion detection: Shirai\n8 i-Perception\ndetection; Shirai et al., 2006, 2009). Thus, it is plausible that both adults and school-age\nchildren have an asymmetric sensitivity to radial expansion or contraction flows.\nPresumably, the observed contraction advantage in our latency data may be related to the\ncontraction detection advantage previously reported in both adults (e.g., Edwards &\n2009). Edwards and Ibbotson (2007) suggested that the contraction detection advantage\ncontributes to maintaining body balance during postural sway. It is easier to step forward\nto compensate for postural sway when our body is tilted forward than to step back when our\nbody is tilted backward. Thus, our visual system should be more sensitive to a contraction\nflow, which represents backward postural sway, than to an expansion flow, which represents\nforward sway. The fact that more rapid vection for contraction than for expansion flow was\nobserved in the current study fits well with the perspective of Edwards and Ibbotson (2007):\nBecause backward body movements are more dangerous than forward body movements,\nbackward movement should be detected more rapidly than forward movement.\nWhy Did the Children Show More Rapid and Stronger Vection Than the Adults?\nThe current finding that the children had faster and stronger vection than the adults\nis consistent with a previous vection study in children of a similar age (Shirai et al., 2012;\n6\u00ad12 year olds). The consistency between the present and previous studies suggests that\nschool-age children tend to experience stronger vection than adults, and that vection is\nmore easily induced in school-age children than in adults. However, the reason that\nstronger or more rapid vection is observed at younger age remains unclear. Shirai et al.\n(2012) inferred that a potential difference in the size of the effective visual field between\nchildren and adults might affect their experience of vection. Stronger vection can be\ninduced by a larger sized visual stimulus (e.g., Leibowitz, Post, Rodemer, Wadlington, &\nLundy, 1980; Ohmi, Howard, & Landolt, 1987). Because the effective size of the visual field is\nsmaller in school-age children than adults (e.g., Holmes, Cohen, Haith, & Morrison, 1977;\nLakowski & Aspinall, 1969), a visual stimulus might be seen as larger in a child's relatively\nsmall visual field than in an adult's larger visual field, even if the children and adults observe\nexactly the same visual stimulus; thus, induced vection may be greater for children than for\nadults, even if the children and adults observe the same visual stimulus.\nAlternatively, children of this age may rely more on visual information than adults to\nperceive movement of their own body. When we move through the environment, we perceive\nself-movement through vision and other sensory information, such as vestibular data. Several\nstudies have shown that human adults integrate those multisensory inputs to perceive the\nheading direction during self-motion (e.g., Bertin & Berthoz, 2004; Butler, Smith, Campos, &\nBulthoff, 2010; Harris, Jenkin, & Zikovitz, 2000). Presumably, school-age children use less\nnonvisual information than visual information to estimate self-motion. Evidence suggests\nthat vestibular sensitivity is still immature until later school age; vestibular sensitivity\ndevelops slowly through toddlerhood and childhood (3\u00ad4 years and 14\u00ad15 years), and even\n14- to 15-year-old children showed significantly lower vestibular sensitivity than adults\n(Hirabayashi & Iwasaki, 1995). In addition, Lepecq, Giannopulu, Mertz, and Baudonniere\n(1999) suggested that individual differences in vestibular sensitivity can affect the vection\nexperience. They found that the latency of reported vection tends to be shorter in\nobservers who have lesser vestibular sensitivity than those who have higher vestibular\nsensitivity. Taken together, stronger and more rapid vection in school-age children\ncompared with that in adults may stem from lesser vestibular sensitivity in school-age\nchildren.\nShirai et al. 9\nPotential Limits of the Visual Display Used in the Current Study\nIt should be noted that, because the viewing distance in the current study was relatively short\n(57 cm) to ensure that the visual stimulus was large in size, the visual display might have\nproduced some unnatural effects as participants viewed the simulated space. For instance,\nthere were inconsistencies in the depth structure simulated by moving dots, and various depth\ncues (e.g., binocular disparity, vergence, and accommodation) were available from the\nsurface of the projection screen. In addition, the relatively lower resolution of the images\n(1024 \u00c2 768 pixels) projected on the relatively large projection screen might have produced\nthe ``screen door effect,'' a phenomenon in which gratings composed of edges of pixels appear\nin front of a displayed image. Such unnatural features of the visual stimuli might have\naffected the observers' perception of the depth structure of the visual scene and of their\nown movement. Thus, the reported vection in the current study may have been distorted\ndue to the unnatural look of the visual stimuli. Future studies using a larger display and\nhigher pixel resolution with a longer viewing distance will be necessary to examine this issue.\nSuch stimuli will reduce the inconsistencies between the simulated depth structure and the\nview projected on the screen as well as the screen door effect.\nConcluding Remarks and Future Directions\nThe current results indicate the presence of the known asymmetry for expansion or\ncontraction of optic flow in vection in school-age children. This suggests that the\nexperience of vection seems to be comparable between children and adults in some\nrespects. In contrast, the latency or saturation of vection was significantly shorter or\nstronger in the children compared with the adults regardless of the difference in the visual\nmotion pattern. This suggests that experienced vection can be more rapid or stronger in\nchildhood than adulthood, as was also shown in previous developmental research (Shirai\net al., 2012, 2014). Therefore, although the overall trend in vection seems to change over the\nlifespan (possibly beyond later childhood), the directional asymmetry in vection may emerge\nduring an earlier stage of our lives (potentially early school age or younger).\nFuture research should investigate the development of other asymmetries in vection with a\nvariety of directional patterns, such as upward versus downward motion or horizontal versus\nvertical motion. In addition, it would be interesting to examine the asymmetries in vection in\nolder individuals. Haibach, Slobounov, and Newell (2009) reported that the saturation of\nvection is stronger in younger (mean age \u00bc 18.5 years) than in older adults (mean age \u00bc 64.9\nand 75.0 years). Determining whether the asymmetries in vection are weaker in older adults\nas the saturation of vection will be a fruitful task to understand the entire developmental\nprocess of vection over the lifespan.\n"
