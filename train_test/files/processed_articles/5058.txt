A qualitative research\nmethodology was utilized to analyze the writing of the two groups to reveal the points of strengths and weaknesses in their\nwriting. The results of the study indicated that there was a notable difference between the natives' and the students' use of\ncohesive devices in terms of frequency, variety, and control. While L1 English users' writing displayed a balance between the\nuse and frequency of various types of cohesive devices, the students overused certain types (repetition and reference) while\nneglecting to use the others, thereby often, rendering their written texts noncohesive.\n",

Enkvist (1990) considered the achieve-\nment of cohesion in writing as an indefinable, obstruct, and\ncontroversial concept which is difficult to teach and difficult\nto learn.\nDiscourse unity, according to Tanskanen (2006), can only\nbe established via the use of cohesive devices that contribute\nto text cohesion. Consequently, a text, according to Halliday\nand Hasan (1976), is \"any passage, spoken or written, of what-\never length, that does form a unified whole\" and \"is best\nregarded as a semantic unit\" (p. 1). Halliday and Hasan (1976)\nperceived cohesion as the only factor that distinguishes texts\nfrom nontexts. This position was supported by Alarcon and\nMorales (2011), who stated that cohesion refers to the linguis-\ntic features which help make a sequence of sentences a text.\nThe mastery of cohesive devices is a crucial element of effec-\ntive academic writing and essential for academic success in\nany university program where English is the medium of\ninstruction. Consequently, the utilization of cohesive devices\nin academic writing has attracted the attention of many\nresearchers who are endeavoring to address the issue of lack of\ncohesion in students' writing, especially in those countries,\nsuch as Oman, where English is taught as a foreign language.\nA number of studies focusing on cohesive devices have\nbeen conducted in different countries where English is taught\nas a foreign language. Liu and Braine (2005) investigated\ncohesive features in argumentative writing produced by 96\n1st-year Chinese undergraduate students. The study showed\nthat students were incapable of using cohesive devices profi-\nciently in their writing. Thus, the authors stressed the need\nfor further research in the area of teaching writing to enhance\nthe awareness of students regarding the significance and\nimplementation of cohesive devices in their texts (Liu &\ncohesive devices by 15 each of 1st- and 3rd-year English\nmajors from Wuyi University in China. The findings of the\nstudy demonstrated that proficiency levels did not influence\nthe students' implementation of cohesive devices in their\nwriting. Furthermore, the researcher indicated that repetition\nwas more significantly used than other types of lexical cohe-\nsion. Yang and Sun (2012) investigated the cohesive devices\nin argumentative writing by 2nd- and 3rd-year undergraduate\nChinese EFL (English as a foreign language) learners at dif-\nferent proficiency levels. The researchers emphasized that\nthe writing quality of the students determined the appropriate\nuse of cohesive devices regardless of their EFL proficiency\nlevels.

The study's cor-\npus consisted of 514 essays that were collected from graduat-\ning Hong Kong high-school students at seven different grade\nlevels. The study's analysis stressed the notion that profi-\nciency did not produce texts that were more cohesive, though\nthey constructed texts that were more linguistically\nsophisticated.\nIn Saudi Arabia, Al-Jarf (2001) investigated the use of\ncohesive devices by 59 Arab EFL students from King Saud\nUniversity. Substitution was deemed to be the most problem-\natic form of cohesion for the students followed by reference\nand ellipsis. Furthermore, the outcome of the study also indi-\ncated that \"cohesion anomalies were caused by poor linguis-\ntic competence, especially poor syntactic and semantic\nawareness, and poor or inaccurate knowledge of the cohe-\nIn Egypt, Ahmed (2010) researched students' cohesion\nproblems in EFL essay writing. The participants in the study\nwere Egyptian student-teachers. The researcher concluded\nthat the low English proficiency of the students caused their\nnoncohesive writing.\nIn Nigeria, Olateju (2006) examined the use of cohesive\ndevices in the essays of 70 final-year students of Ooni Girls\nHigh School in Osun State. The researcher concluded that\nalthough the students had 6 years of intensive English\ninstruction at the secondary-school level, they lacked the\nability to properly use cohesive devices in their essays.\nThe phenomenon of cohesion and coherence in L2 English\nwriting has been the focus of attention for several researchers\nin different nations. However, no research has been con-\nducted with Arabic L1 users in the Sultanate of Oman inves-\ntigating Omani student-teachers' use of cohesive devices in\ntheir written discourse. Moreover, to the best knowledge of\nthe writer, this study can be considered the first one that con-\nducts two types of comparison. First, it compares the writing\nof two different levels of students in the same program to\nexamine whether proficiency level positively affects their\nwriting. Second, it compares the writing of native speakers\nof English and the Arabic L1 students to identify how far the\ntwo groups differ in the implementation of cohesive devices.\nSpecifically, the study was carried out to investigate the pro-\nficiency of 60 1st- and 3rd-year Omani student-teachers' use\nof cohesive devices in their writing, and to identify how their\nwriting qualitatively differs from native speakers' regarding\nthe appropriate use of cohesive devices.\nTheoretical Framework\nCohesion and Coherence\nWhen one writes, he or she has to take a number of factors\ninto account. These factors include: making meaning from\navailable information, personal knowledge, and the cultural\nand contextual frames around which the writer is situated. If\na native speaker of English hears or reads a passage of the\nlanguage which is more than one sentence in length, he or\nshe can normally decide without difficulty whether it forms\na unified whole or is just a collection of unrelated sentences\n(Halliday & Hasan, 1976, p. 1). To use writing as a means of\ncommunication, it is necessary to go beyond sentence-level\nmanipulation to the production of paragraphs and subse-\nquently to multi-paragraph compositions. Once people are\ninvolved in writing two or more interconnected sentences,\nthey have to use cohesive devices and coherence as a means\nof linking sentences together. They should also have the abil-\nity to organize ideas into a unified whole. Cox, Shanahan,\nand Sulzby (1990) supported the idea that cohesion is impor-\ntant for the reader in constructing meaning from a text and\nfor the writer in creating a text that can be easily compre-\nhended. Connor (1984) defined cohesion as the use of\nexplicit cohesive devices that signal relations among sen-\ntences and parts of a text. This means that the appropriate use\nof cohesive devices enables readers and listeners to capture\nthe connectedness between what precedes and what follows.\nThis means that the dependency of the linguistic elements on\neach other in a text constructs a semantic unit. This shows\nthat connectedness is an indispensable element in any writ-\nten or spoken discourse. Consequently, linguists dealing with\ndiscourse analysis have been striving to help students achieve\ncohesion in writing.\nCohesion is usually thought of as one of the most crucial\ndefining characteristics of the quality of writing and thus has\nbeen central in recent research. Witte and Faigley (1981)\nasserted that the types of cohesive devices and their fre-\nquency commonly reflect the invention skills of the writers\nas well as the influence of the stylistic properties on the texts\nthey write. While some studies (Ahmed, 2010; Connor,\nbetween cohesion and writing proficiency levels, other stud-\ntradictory results.\nThe present writer, relying on his vast experience as a\nteacher of English writing to Arab L1 users, suggests that\ncohesion can be achieved if the writer of a text appropriately\nuses a variety of well-placed cohesive devices that the text\nrequires. This opinion seems to be in keeping with the notion\nstated by Salkie (1995) that cohesive devices play the role of\nthe glue that holds different parts of a text together. Increasing\nthe cohesion of a text facilitates and improves text compre-\nhension for many readers (Gersbacher, Varner, & Faust,\n1990). This connectedness of ideas in the text will definitely\ncreate a cohesive whole text which facilitates the reader's\ncomprehension, particularly low knowledge readers\n(McNamara, Kintsch, Butler-Songer, & Kintsch, 1996).\nAny researcher, and the present writer is not an exception,\nwho wants to deal with cohesion will inevitably find himself\nor herself confronting the related notion, coherence. It is gen-\nerally accepted in the literature that while cohesion is primar-\nily related to structural linguistics, coherence has been\nstudied with the fields of linguistics, discourse psychology,\nand cognition science (Sanders & Maat, 2006), which all\nfocus on issues beyond the structures of a text. Malmkjaer\n(2001) noted that \"a coherent extended text is the result of\ninteraction between the reader's world and the text, with the\nreader making plausible interpretations\" (p. 549). Thus, a\nreader or writer constantly endeavors to make sense of the\ntext depending on the shared background knowledge beyond\nthe text.\nThough some researchers state that cohesion and coher-\nence are two faces of the same coin (Fitzgerald & Spiegel,\ntionship between the two (Bamberg, 1984; Tierney &\ndistinctness between cohesion and coherence is empha-\nsized by Winterowd (1985), who stated that cohesion in a\ntext can be accomplished without coherence and vice versa,\ndepending greatly on the reader of the text. This notion was\nsupported by Oller and Jonz (1994), who stated that the use\nof many cohesive devices does not necessarily create a\ncoherent and comprehensible text. To prove this, Enkvist\n(1990) provided the example, \"my car is black. Black\nEnglish was a controversial subject most people have\nretired. To retire means `to put new tires on a vehicle.'\nSome vehicles such as hovercraft have no wheels. Wheels\ngo round\" (p. 12). Though cohesive devices, such as lexical\ncohesion and repetition, are used, the text lacks coherent\nmeaning. On the contrary, a text with no cohesive devices\nmay be considered coherent as in the example presented by\nKoshik (1999), \"Someone came my house. Says give me\nmoney. Husband take gun shoot. Go outside die. Call\npolice. Emergency 911. Policeman come. Take black man\ngo hospital die\" (p. 11).\nDespite the above concerns, the present paper's focus will\nbe on cohesion as the preponderance of evidence indicates\nthat the appropriate use of various cohesive devices in aca-\ndemic and descriptive writing ultimately leads to coherence.\nRationale of the Study\nThe personal motivation of the writer to deal with this sub-\nject stems from two sources. First, as a teacher of English\nwho has been working with Arabic L1 users for approxi-\nmately 20 years, I have seen first-hand difficulties that L1\nArabic users face in English academic writing, especially in\nutilizing cohesive devices which are fundamental to create\ncohesively unified texts. Consequently, despite the fact that\nOmani student-teachers have studied English for approxi-\nmately 14 years at tertiary level, they have shown an evident\nweakness in writing, in general, and in achieving cohesion,\nin particular. Second, to the best knowledge of the writer, no\nsimilar study has been carried out in the Sultanate of Oman.\nTherefore, to improve the student's utilization of cohesive\ndevices, the writer set out to conduct this research aiming to\nanswer the following four questions:\n1. What types of cohesive devices are used by Arabic\nL1 student-teachers in their written discourse?\n2. How frequently do those students use these cohesive\ndevices in their writing?\n3. To what extent do these student-teachers differ from\nnative English speakers in the use of cohesive\ndevices?\n4. What problems do these students face in using cohe-\nsive devices to achieve cohesion?\nAnalytical Framework\nAlthough researchers have identified several types of cohe-\nframework was adopted in this study due to the comprehen-\nsiveness of its well-developed taxonomy. A cohesive device,\nHalliday and Hasan (1976) noted, comprises two interrelated\nelements that cross a minimum of one sentence boundary.\nWhile one element is presupposing, the other is presupposed.\nFor instance, a pronoun is the presupposing element, while\nits referent represents the presupposed element. Halliday and\nHasan (1976) stated that cohesion can be established by five\nproperties which are presented in Table1.\nMethod\nThis paper utilized qualitative research methodology, which\nas Denzin and Lincoln (2000) argued, is achieved when\n\"qualitative researchers study things in their natural settings,\nattempting to make sense of, or to interpret, phenomena in\nterms of the meanings people bring to them\" (p. 3).\nQualitative data produces a reliable view of the social setting\nwhich suggests that \"categories/representations produced\nthrough research are socially and historically located and\nParticipants\nThe study sample consisted of three groups. The first group\ncomprised 30 1st-year students who joined the English\ndepartment after they had finished their foundation year. The\nsecond group consisted of 30 3rd-year students who had\nalready completed the foundation year and five semesters\nduring which they had studied several courses in writing and\ndiscourse analysis. The 3rd group comprised 29 native\nspeakers of English who were working at Sohar University\nin the Foundation Program and other faculties. None of these\nparticipants was a professional writer.\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 1. Cohesive Devices.\nCohesive devices\n1.

Lexical cohesion\nSynonyms\nRepetition\nSuperordinates\nAntonyms\nTo achieve cohesion in texts, writers tend to use the same\nwords. Specifically content words, such as nouns, adjectives,\nadverbs, and main verbs which are used by writers to help a\ntext to be coherent. For instance, the people of this country\naren't stupid. They know when politicians are lying to them.\nThey know when newspapers are not giving them the full\npicture.\nThis method is used to avoid repeating exactly the same word\nby using a word that is very close in meaning, for example,\n\"The doctor told me I'd been working too hard and I\nneeded at least six weeks off work to get my strength back.\"\nAmanda's employer, however, was less sympathetic. \"My boss\ntold me it was redundancy money--two weeks' pay--$280. I\nwas shocked.\"\nAnother way of creating cohesion is to refer back to a word\nby using its superordinate. General words are referred to\nas \"superordinates\" and the more specific ones are called\n\"hyponym.\" Such as, I love all dogs, especially Collies.\nAntonyms, according to O'Grady, Dobrovolsky, and Katamba\n(1996), are \"words or phrases that are opposites with\nrespect to some components of their meanings\" (p. 705). For\ninstance, that car is big, compared to the small one I have.\nResearch Design\nThe instrument used by the researcher to collect the data was\nstudents' and natives' essays. The teachers of writing and\ndiscourse analysis at Sohar University explicitly cover all\ntypes of cohesive devices to encourage students to use them\nin their writing so that they can achieve cohesiveness in their\ntexts. In all writing courses and discourse analysis at all lev-\nels, the importance of this textual feature is stressed.\nSubsequently, the three groups were asked to write an\nessay of around 300 words on \"A Day to Remember.\" This\ntopic was chosen among a large number of alternatives that\nwere deemed to be similar to the topics studied in class or\nassigned in class, since it did not necessitate special back-\nground knowledge. All the subjects were given a week to\ncomplete their task outside of class to offer them sufficient\ntime to think and write creatively. Moreover, to encourage\nthe students to write a well-written text, their writing teach-\ners told them that their texts would be assessed and given\nmarks. However, the students were encouraged to rely\nentirely on themselves during the writing to give their teach-\ners the chance to be familiar with their mistakes in writing to\ndesign some remedial work to improve it.\nTo answer the four questions previously mentioned, the\nwriter thoroughly examined the papers written by the stu-\ndents as well as those written by native speakers.\nSubsequently, all the correct cohesive devices that indi-\nviduals in the three groups used were recorded. Then a\nthorough comparison was conducted to find out how dif-\nferent or/and similar the groups were in implementing\ncohesive devices in their writing to achieve a cohesive\nwhole text.\nDiscussion of Findings\nTo answer the first two questions of the study, Tables 2 and 3\nare presented.\nThese two tables contain all tallies of the various types of\ncohesive devices used by the two groups of students. A total\nof 1,498 cohesive devices were used by all students to\nachieve cohesive writing. Whereas 1st-year students used\ncentages of the 1st- and 3rd-year students, it can be con-\ncluded that the two groups do not vary greatly in the\nfrequency of their use of cohesive devices. This is despite the\nlonger period the latter have spent at the university during\nwhich they studied \"Advanced Writing 1,\" \"Advanced\nWriting 2,\" \"Report Writing,\" and \"Discourse Analysis.\" It is\nof note that though 1st-year students used a larger number of\ncohesive devices than 3rd-year students, this does not mean\nthat they are better at using cohesive devices to achieve\ncohesion in their texts. When analyzing the writing of the\ntwo groups, the writer arrived at the conclusion that the over-\nuse of certain cohesive devices by the 1st-year students\ncauses their writing to be more redundant and sometimes dif-\nficult to decipher.\nTable 2 clearly shows that the most distinctive difference\nbetween the two groups is in the use of repetition. While\n1st-year students used this device 361 times, 3rd-year stu-\ndents used it 264 times. This indicates that 3rd-year students\ntended not to use repetition because of their extended knowl-\nedge of writing, which elucidates the perception that repeti-\ntion generally causes boredom to the reader. What attracts\nthe attention in the tables is the number of synonyms and\nantonyms utilized by the two groups. Third-year students\nshould perform better here, because they should have a bet-\nter repertoire of synonyms and antonyms after the length of\ntime they have spent learning English. However, there is\nlittle difference between the groups in terms of the use of\nsynonyms and antonyms.\nTable 3 shows that the outstanding difference between the\ntwo groups is in the use of reference. Whereas 1st-year stu-\ndents used 212 personal and demonstrative pronouns, 3rd-\nyear students used them 284 times. This, of course, relates to\nthe phenomenon of repetition previously mentioned. Third-\nyear students are more capable than 1st-year students in\navoiding repetition by using personal and demonstrative pro-\nnouns. Since 1st-year students do not yet have such ability in\nthe essays examined, they mainly resorted to repetition.\nAlthough the two tables show some sort of difference\nbetween the two student groups in the frequency and the\ntypes of cohesive devices they used, the variance is not that\nnoteworthy. This suggested that proficiency of English of\nthese L1 Arabic using student-teachers does not positively\naffect their use of English cohesive devices. This notion cor-\nrelates with findings of other studies such as Xuefan (2007),\nSubsequently, the writer moves to answer the third ques-\ntion to find out how far native speakers of English and Omani\nstudent-teachers at Sohar University are similar or different\nin the frequency and types of cohesive devices they used.\nTable 4 illustrates the differences.\nAlthough Witte and Faigley (1981) emphasized that \"dis-\ncourse is context bound-to the demands of the subject matter,\noccasion, medium, and audience of the text\" (p. 202), and\nthat there is no evidence of correlation between cohesive ties\nand writing quality, they found in their study that highly\nrated essays were generally defined by the rich density of\ncohesive ties compared with low-rated essays. Consequently,\nit should not come as a surprise to learn that native speakers,\nwho produced much better-written output than both groups\nof students in this study's context, used significantly more\ncohesive devices than both groups of students.\nTable 2.

The use of lexical cohesion by the three groups of\nparticipants.\nTable 4 shows the difference in balance between lexical\ncohesion and other types of cohesion. While the two percent-\nages of the first two groups in this table are rather close to\neach other, the difference between them and the third group\nis noticeable. This gives us the impression that student-\nteachers use the four types of lexical cohesion (repetition,\nsynonyms, superordinates, and antonyms) more than the\nnative speakers. On the contrary, native speakers use the\nother kinds of cohesive devices more than the lexical cohe-\nsion. These results are parallel with the results presented by\nKafes (2012), who emphasized that lexical cohesion, specifi-\ncally repetition, was predominantly used by Turkish students\nin their English written essays. Mojica's (2006) study, which\ninvestigated the academic writings of 30 Filipino graduate\nEnglish as a Second Language (ESL) students, indicated that\nlexical cohesive devices were most frequently used by the\nstudents. Moreover, Khalil (1989) also emphasized that Arab\nstudents overuse lexical cohesion in their written work. This\nphenomenon is further depicted in Figure 1.\nThis figure indicates that 1st- and 3rd-year students face\ndifficulties in appropriately using cohesive devices. However,\n3rd-year students'performance is better because, unlike their\n1st-year juniors they, to some extent, depend on a wider\nrange of cohesive devices significantly more than 1st-year\nstudents who are rather fixated on lexical cohesive ties.\nHence, 3rd-year students are rather closer to native speakers\nin using both types of cohesive devices than 1st-year stu-\ndents (Table 5).\nTable 5 shows the vast difference between the types and\nnumbers of cohesive devices used by the students and the\nwritings of 1st- and 3rd-year students, respectively, all the\nother three types of lexical cohesion in their writing comprise\nonly 3.2% and 6.7% correspondingly. This is quite different\nfrom the percentages for the four types for native speakers\nwho, unlike the students, keep a sort of balance between the\nuses of the four types. This obviously elucidates the fact that\nstudent-teachers lack the repertoire of synonyms, antonyms,\nand superordinates. Figure 2 captures this phenomenon.\nAs it was previously mentioned, English native speakers\ntend to resort to using types of cohesion other than lexical\ndevices in achieving cohesion in descriptive texts. This is\nevident in the three total percentages shown in table 6. What\nis of note is the noticeable difference between the percent-\nages of connectives. While the English L1 users' percentage\nis 46.4%, the percentages of the 1st- and the 3rd-year stu-\ndent-teachers are 43% and 32.9%, respectively. This illus-\ntrates the fact that the English L1 users tend to use the four\ntypes of connectives, additives, adversatives, causal, and\ntemporal more than the nonnatives speakers. These connec-\ntives are commonly used by native speakers to relate what\nfollows to what precedes. The table also shows a vast differ-\nence between students' and natives' use of reference. While\nthe percentages of 1st- and 3rd-year students of reference\nguage users' percentage is 30%. This indicates that the stu-\ndents are familiar with personal and demonstrative pronouns\nwhich they tend to overuse to achieve reference in their\nwriting. Figure 3 depicts this phenomenon.\nThe tables, figures, and the discussion of results presented\ngive a clear answer to Question 4 of the study.

Table 7 is an analysis of the\nwriting of 10 random students.\nThis table supports what is stated in the presented tables\nand figures that Omani student-teachers tend to use repeti-\ntion and reference more than the other types of cohesive\ndevices. This results in the vast difference between their\nwritings and those of the natives. The following examples\nrepresent instances of students'inappropriate use of cohesive\ndevices:\nTwo months before the league, we started preparing for this\nleague. We were very excited and waiting for this league. A\nweek before the league we had a meet with our couch telling us\nabout the main plan that we will do during the league.

But one of these memories has been diged in my\nmind . . ..\nThe present research reveals that writing as a skill, should\nbe tackled in a totally different way. Textbook writers and\nteachers whether at schools or departments of English should\ndevise alternative strategies for teaching cohesive devices to\nequip their learners with the knowledge required to be com-\npetent in writing cohesive whole texts.\nThe specific problems that students face when writing a\ntext in English can be summarized as follows:\n1. The students overuse certain types of cohesive\ndevices, e.g. repetition, reference, and connectives,\nwhile ignoring the other types. This overuse of par-\nticular cohesive devices is counterproductive, that is,\nit results in tediousness and redundancy in their writ-\nten work.\n2. The students do not achieve a balance between the\nuse of the various types of cohesive devices, that is,\nthey overuse some types and ignore others.\n3. The problem that appears to be quite obvious to any-\none who goes through the students' writing is the\ninappropriate use of the different types of cohesive\ndevices. This means that, in some cases, the students\nuse a certain cohesive device where it is not required.\nIn other cases, some parts of the text need cohesive\ndevices, but the students do not use them.\n4. It seems obvious that the students are not familiar\nwith all types of cohesive devices to the same degree,\nso they only utilize those that they are familiar with\nbecause they find them easy to implement. Therefore,\nthey use repetition and reference in over abundance.\nPedagogical Implications\nTo help students improve their use of cohesive devices to\nachieve better cohesion in writing, the writer recommends\nseveral pedagogical implications. First, the types of prob-\nlems stated above, especially the overuse of certain types of\ncohesive devices, namely, repetition and reference, while\nignoring or misusing the others, encourage the writer to state\nthat the student-teachers are in urgent need of being taught\nhow to think in English while writing in English rather than\nthinking and preparing their ideas in Arabic and then\nTable 6.

The negative transfer caused\nby stylistic, rhetorical, educational, and cultural differences\nleads to the appearance of incoherence in most of the texts\nwritten by the student participants. What worsens the situa-\ntion is that they are not aware that logic and rhetoric are not\nuniversal, that is, rhetorical processes vary from one culture\nto another. Despite the fact that some of the participants,\nespecially 3rd-year students, have mastered syntactic struc-\ntures, they still demonstrate an inability to compose cohesive\ntexts. This fact has been asserted by Holes (1984), who stated\nthat though some of the texts written by the nonspeakers of\nEnglish are relatively free from gross grammatical errors,\nthey do not feel English.\nTo solve the aforementioned problem, the writer suggests\nthe students receive a great deal of exposure to English texts\nwritten by native speakers which they can critically and ana-\nlytically comprehend.\nThe persistent need for novel methods to teach writing,\nwhether in schools or universities, is due to the importance of\nthis skill as a thinking tool. This fact was asserted by Bjork\nWe highlight the importance of writing in all university curricula\nnot only because of its immediate practical application, i.e. as an\nisolated skill or ability, but because we believe that, seen from a\nbroader perspective, writing is a thinking tool. It is a tool for\nlanguage development, for critical thinking and, extension, for\nlearning in all disciplines. (p. 8)\nIn the light of what has been stated above, the writer sug-\ngests a reconsideration of the place cohesion and cohesive\ndevices should occupy in the curriculum and the way teach-\ners deal with it, especially the employment of cohesive\ndevices to help their learners write effectively.\nSecond, the inappropriate use of cohesive devices by the\nparticipants can be related to teaching methods. The writing\nsamples suggest that the students have not received sufficient\ntraining in writing English which helped them become famil-\niarized with the rhetorical means of writing in that language.\nBecause teachers tend to rely on the deductive teaching of\nwriting mechanics and practice at the sentence level, stu-\ndents do not write descriptive passages very often. Moreover,\nteachers rarely intervene in the writing processes to guide or\nhelp their students, with few of them providing detailed feed-\nback on the written work done.\nThird, there is a need for teachers of writing and discourse\nto avoid focusing on the word and sentence levels, because\nthis will definitely result in noncohesive texts. Instead, they\nhave to go beyond structure-level analysis and focus on\nwhole texts which can shift the learners' attention to dis-\ncourse features that are fundamental in achieving unity.\nFourth, exposing students to a wide range of cohesive\ndevices and the way they are implemented by native speakers\ncan help the students avoid overemphasizing certain types\nand ignoring other types because over-reliance on one or two\nstrategies results in redundancy and misunderstanding.\nFifth, it has been shown by teachers of writing and dis-\ncourse that teaching the various types of cohesive devices in\nisolation does not help the learners to use them appropriately\nthere is a need for teachers to focus on the way cohesive\ndevices are used in novels written by native speakers of\nEnglish where a demonstration of all those devices is made\nmanifest in writing. A teacher should also point out the\nsemantic consequences of particular patterns of language use\nto help their students become fully aware of the organization\nof relevant meanings in relation to each other in a text. In this\ncase, the students will become familiar with the crucial role\ncohesive devices can play in the logical development of the\nwho stated that to enhance students' awareness of cohesion,\nit is essential to incorporate reading activities into writing\nclasses. This enhances the students' awareness of the charac-\nteristics of good writing, including cohesion.\nFinally, teachers can motivate their students to enlarge\ntheir repertoire of vocabulary which will help them use syn-\nonyms, antonyms, and superordinates rather than overem-\nphasizing repetition as it was indicated by the findings of this\nstudy. An effective strategy suggested by Thurston and\nness of lexico-grammatical patterning of text is to introduce\ncorpora to students. According to the two writers, corpus-\ninformed syllabi can be combined with writing courses. This\nhelps the students to solve their lexical problems through\nconcordances and collocation samples.\nTaken as a whole, therefore, it becomes apparent that\nexplicit in-service teacher training is required for current\nEnglish language teachers to ensure they are aware of this\nissue in their English writing and are trained to deal with it.\nThis has further implications for how trainee teachers are\ntaught how to teach writing which needs to be addressed in\nOmani English language teacher training institutions.\nConclusion\nIn this study, Halliday and Hasan's (1976) cohesion frame-\nwork was adopted to analyze college students'use of cohesive\ndevices. The data of the study was qualitatively analyzed\nthrough identifying the numbers and types of cohesive devices\nused by the two groups (natives and nonnatives) and by evalu-\nating the overall quality of essays written by those two groups.\nAccording to the discussion of results presented hereinbefore,\nthere is a vast difference between the natives'and the students'\nuse of cohesive devices in frequency, variety, and control.\nWhile L1 English users kept a balance between the use and\nfrequency of various types of cohesive devices, the students\noverused certain types (repetition and reference) and neglected\nto use the others. This is certainly caused by lack of compe-\ntence in their use of cohesive devices and their limited reper-\ntoire of vocabulary despite the fact that they have been exposed\nto English reading and writing texts over many semesters.\nThough the students tend to utilize only a limited range of\nthe many cohesive devices available, their texts appear to be\ndifficult to understand because even the few cohesive devices\nthey utilized were inaccurately used. The study reveals that\nthe misuse of cohesive devices is prominent in the writing of\nthese Arabic L1 students. This phenomenon not only creates\ndisorganized texts but also renders the content incomprehen-\nsible to the reader.\nThe overuse of certain cohesive devices by the students\ndefinitely causes redundancy in their writing and renders\ntheir written texts difficult to decipher. The students might be\nencouraged by their teachers of writing and discourse to use\nas many cohesive devices as possible to create cohesive\nwhole texts. This, in turn, will certainly result in less redun-\ndancy and incomprehension.\nFurthermore, the students, unlike the English L1 users,\nmainly focus on the word and sentence level and ignore the\nrelations of meaning that exist within the text. This linking is\nachieved through relations in meaning that exist within and\nacross sentences. The result of this tendency is the absence of\nconnectedness which makes the flow of thoughts meaningful\nand clear for readers. Cohesion gives a sequence of sentences\na coherent texture as it shows how semantic relationships are\nset up by lexical and syntactic features.\nAs such, this study has shown the difficulty Omani stu-\ndent-teachers of English commonly face in their English\ndescriptive writing, and how in particular their use of cohe-\nsive devices is in need of attention. This conclusion is similar\nto those of previous studies that investigated the use of cohe-\nsive devices by students in the context where English is taught\nas a foreign language. These studies include Khalil (1989),\nKafes (2012). Further research needs to be carried out to\nexamine the effectiveness of various approaches to teaching\nthese devices, as it is clear that the present approaches have\nnot equipped the students with the linguistic resources neces-\nsary to write descriptive texts successfully.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAhmed, A.
