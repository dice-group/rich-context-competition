    "reduced_content": "OBJECTIVE -- Distributions of serum concentrations of insulin among adolescents and\nyoung adults are poorly understood in the U.S. The objective of this study was to describe the\ndistribution of serum insulin across demographic characteristics of U.S. adolescents and young\nadults.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- A total of 1,791 male and female subjects\naged 12\u00ad19 years who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys\nRESULTS -- Among male participants, serum concentrations of insulin increased from age 12\nto 14 years before decreasing. Among female participants, concentrations were highest at age 13\nyears before decreasing steadily through age 19 years. Among participants aged 12\u00ad17 years but\nnot those aged 18\u00ad19 years, females had higher mean log-transformed concentrations than\nmales (P, Wald, F  0.038 and 0.125, respectively) after adjusting for age and ethnicity. After\nadjusting for age and BMI percentile, mean log-transformed concentrations were higher in\nAfrican-American females aged 12\u00ad17 years than in white or Mexican-American participants. No\nsignificant ethnic differences were found among female participants aged 18\u00ad19 years or male\nparticipants aged 12\u00ad19 years. Concentrations of insulin increased strongly with increasing\nlevels of BMI.\nCONCLUSIONS -- These results provide detailed information about serum concentrations\nof insulin in a representative sample of U.S. adolescents and young adults and may be useful to\nmonitor future trends of this risk factor for diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\nThe increase in obesity among chil-\ndren in the U.S. has generated great\nconcern about their future health\nbecause of the increased risk of cardiovas-\ncular disease and diabetes associated with\nobesity (1,2). Obesity is associated with\ninsulin resistance, a state characterized by\nthe body's resistance to the actions of in-\nsulin, which results in increased insulin\nproduction by the pancreas and hyperin-\nsulinemia. Measures of adiposity are gen-\nerally strongly related to concentrations\nof insulin (3). In children and adoles-\ncents, elevated concentrations of circulat-\ning insulin are associated with risk factors\nfor cardiovascular disease such as high\nblood pressure, dyslipidemia, inflamma-\ntory markers, endothelial dysfunction,\nand cardiovascular reactivity (4 \u00ad12).\nThus, early increases in insulin concen-\ntrations may promote early vascular\nchanges that lead to early onset of cardio-\nvascular disease. Furthermore, because\nhigh concentrations of insulin may serve\nas a surrogate marker for insulin resis-\ntance (13), a step on the road to diabetes,\nchanges in circulating concentrations of\ninsulin may serve as early indications of\nfuture trends in diabetes incidence and\nprevalence.\nThese considerations suggest that\nsurveillance of circulating concentrations\nof insulin may be of critical importance\nduring a time in world history when in-\ncreases in the prevalence of obesity are\noccurring in many countries and are ex-\npected to continue (14). Such informa-\ntion may be useful in anticipating which\nparticular population groups may be at\nincreased risk for developing adverse\nevents and may help target resources for\nintervention programs. In general, how-\never, such data are not available in most\ncountries, and even more rarely are such\ndata available from nationally representa-\ntive samples of the population of country,\nincluding the U.S. Our objective was to\ncharacterize serum concentrations of in-\nsulin for adolescents and young adults in\nthe U.S.\nMETHODS -- We examined data\nfrom National Health and Nutrition Ex-\nDetailed information about the methods\nand procedures of this survey is available\nelsewhere (15,16).

We\nexcluded females who were pregnant,\nand participants with diabetes. We in-\ncluded age, sex, ethnicity, and BMI per-\ncentiles as covariates. We categorized age\nyears. This categorization was done for\nseveral reasons. First, the gap in terms of\nmaturation between a 12 year-old and a\n19 year-old is substantial. Second, the di-\nvision was based on sociocultural reasons.\nThird, using a cut point of 18 years may\nfacilitate comparisons of the results from\nthe present analyses with those of other\nstudies. Finally, having adequate sample\nsize for analyses also played a role in de-\ntermining how many age categories were\nfeasible.

However, in one study, the ethnic dif-\nference was eliminated after adjustment\nfor fat mass quantified using dual energy\nX-ray absorptiometry (26). Factors that\nmay account for the difference between\nAfrican-American and white children and\nadolescents include lower insulin clear-\nance, lower insulin sensitivity, and higher\ninsulin secretion (24\u00ad28). Given the high\nprevalence of diabetes among African\nAmericans and Mexican Americans com-\npared with whites in the U.S. and the high\nmortality rates from coronary heart dis-\nease among African Americans compared\nwith whites, the high concentrations of\ninsulin among these groups, especially fe-\nmales, underscore the fact that the roots\nfor these diseases can often be traced back\nto childhood. Our findings also under-\nscore the wisdom of trying to prevent the\ndevelopment of disease and risk factors at\nan early age.\nFewer studies have compared con-\ncentrations of insulin among Hispanic\nFigure 2--Geometric mean (95% CI) concentrations of insulin among 1,791 participants aged\nfor age and BMI percentile.

In a\nstudy of 403 third graders in Corpus\nChristi, Texus, median concentrations\nwere higher in Mexican Americans than\nin whites (29). Among children from the\nLos Angeles area, concentrations of insu-\nlin were higher among 28 Hispanic chil-\ndren than 14 among Caucasian children\naged 2\u00ad3 years from New York City, con-\ncentrations of insulin were higher in girls\nthan in boys (11). In the San Diego Study\nof Children's Activity and Nutrition, con-\ncentrations of insulin were higher in 54\nMexican American children than in 29\nwhite children at age 11 years (30). Al-\nthough the median concentration of insu-\nlin was still higher in Mexican American\nchildren than in white children, 6 years\nlater the difference was not significant.\nMost studies conducted in U.S. youth\nhave also shown that concentrations of\ninsulin are higher in females than in males\naged 5 and 10 years, concentrations of\ninsulin were similar in boys and girls aged\n5 years but were higher in girls than in\nboys at the age of 10 years (32). In addi-\ntion, many studies conducted in other\ncountries have also reported higher circu-\nlating concentrations of insulin in females\nstudies no sex differences were found\nOur results showing a large increase\nin fasting concentrations of insulin in\nthose who were overweight compared\nwith those who were not reiterate some of\nthe negative physiological consequences\nof excess weight. In addition, the signifi-\ncant increase in concentrations of insulin\namong those who were at risk for being\noverweight shows that even this degree of\nexcess weight produces unfavorable\nphysiological changes.\nA limitation of our study is the lack of\ndata on pubertal status and serum andro-\ngens, estrogens, or growth hormone.\nSuch information would be helpful to de-\nscribe the difference in distribution of in-\nsulin concentrations among teens at\ndifferent pubertal stages, when elevated\nvalues may reflect either a normal physi-\nological state or a pathological one. For\nnow, our results suggest that fasting se-\nrum insulin concentrations peak earlier in\ngirls than in boys. The lack of insulin val-\nues for subjects 12 years of age, when\nsome youth, mostly girls, may enter early\npubertal development, precludes our\nability to comment on the distribution of\ninsulin among preadolescent children.\nPrevious NHANES surveys did not collect\nserum insulin on adolescents, so compar-\nisons to a group of U.S. teens that were\nless overweight than this sample are not\npossible.\nAlthough the relative merit of surrogate\nmarkers for insulin resistance continues to\nbe researched, fasting concentrations of\ninsulin correlate about as well with mea-\nsures of insulin resistance determined by\ngold standard methods as other surrogate\nmarkers. In four studies, correlation coef-\nficients between fasting concentrations of\ninsulin and measures of insulin sensitivi-\nty/resistance determined by gold standard\n42).
