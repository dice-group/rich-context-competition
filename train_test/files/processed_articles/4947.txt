Many consequences of the\ndisease are attributed to neuronal dysfunction, but roles\nof astrocytes in its pathogenesis are not well understood.\nAstrocytes are extensively coupled via gap junctions, and\nabnormal trafficking of metabolites and signalling molecules\nwithin astrocytic syncytia could alter functional interactions\namong cells comprising the neurovascular unit. To evaluate\nthe influence of amyloid-b on astrocyte gap junctional\ncommunication, cultured astrocytes were treated with\n(1 mmol/l) for intervals ranging\nfrom 2 h to 5 days, and the areas labelled by test compounds\nwere determined by impaling a single astrocyte with a\nmicropipette and diffusion of material into coupled cells.\nAmyloid-b-treated astrocytes had rapid, sustained 50\u00ad70%\nreductions in the area labelled by Lucifer Yellow, anionic\nAlexa FluorH dyes and energy-related compounds, 6-NBDG\n(a fluorescent glucose analogue), NADH and NADPH.\nAmyloid-b treatment also caused a transient increase in\noxidative stress. In striking contrast with these results,\nspreading of Lucifer Yellow within astrocytic networks in\nbrain slices from three regions of 8.5\u00ad14-month-old control\nand transgenic Alzheimer's model mice was variable,\nlabelling 10\u00ad2000 cells; there were no statistically significant\ndifferences in the number of dye-labelled cells among the\ngroups or with age. Thus amyloid-induced dysfunction of\ngap junctional communication in cultured astrocytes does\nnot reflect the maintenance of dye transfer through\nastrocytic syncytial networks in transgenic mice; the\npathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease is not appropriately\nrepresented by the cell culture system.\n",

The physiological\nfunctions of cell-to-cell transfer of energy-related metabo-\nlites within the astrocytic syncytium in brain are not well\nunderstood, but astrocytes have important roles in brain\nenergetics (Hertz et al., 2007). Sharing among astrocytes of\nfuel and redox compounds and rapid elimination of metabolic\nby-products may be essential astrocytic responses to brain\nactivation. For example, the astrocytes that remove glutamate\nand potassium from an active synaptic cleft incur an increased\ndemand for energy that would be reduced if the neurotrans-\nmitters and electrolytes quickly diffuse into neighbouring\ngap junction-coupled astrocytes.

For assays of 6-NBDG\ngap junctional transfer, efflux of the fluorescent tracer from\nastrocytes via glucose transporters was blocked by cytochalasin\nB, a glucose transport inhibitor (Speizer et al. 1985); we pre-\nviously observed that glucose transporter-mediated efflux of\nthe NBDG reduced the NBDG-labelled area by ,50% (Gandhi\net al., 2009a). For these assays, the perfusion medium\ncontained 10 mmol/l cytochalasin B, 10 mmol/l glucose (to\ncompete for re-uptake of any tracer that leaked out of cells)\nand an excess level of pyruvate (10 mmol/l) was included as\noxidative fuel to compensate for glucose transport blockade\nduring dye-transfer assays.

Single astrocytes were impaled\nwith micropipettes using a MP-225 manipulator (Sutter\nInstruments), and tracers were diffused for 2 min into cultured\nastrocytes or for 5 min into astrocytes in brain slices before the\nmicropipette was removed. Separate groups of control\nastrocytes grown in low glucose were assayed for dye transfer\nwith and without pretreatment with 0.6 mmol/l octanol for\n10 min to inhibit gap junctional transfer. Fluorescence was\ndetermined before (background) and immediately after\ndiffusion of the test compound into a single astrocyte, and\nthe areas labelled by the probes were determined with\nMetaVue software. Further details of the experimental\nprocedures are described in our previous studies (Ball et al.,\nCounts of the number of dye-labelled cells in brain slices were\ncarried out as follows. The 250 mm-thick brain slices that\nwere previously injected with Lucifer Yellow were removed from\nthe microscope stage and immediately fixed by immersion in 4%\nparaformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4), quickly followed by mixing\nfor 30 s, then gentle shaking for 30 min at room temperature\n(approx. 20\u00b0C) before being stored at 4\u00b0C.

DCF fluorescence was, therefore, assayed to\nevaluate the extent of amyloid-b-induced oxidative stress in\nthe low-glucose cultures. DCF fluorescence approximately\ndoubled after 2 h exposure to amyloid-b, but the increase did\nnot persist at 24 h, and a slight decrement was evident at 5\ndays (Figure 3). The rapid onset of reduced dye transfer\n(Figures 1 and 2) and low, transient increase in oxidative\nstress with amyloid treatment (Figure 3) sharply contrast\nthe responses of hyperglycaemic astrocytes. These cells had\na rapid, progressive rise in DCF fluorescence, but there was a\n3\u00ad5 day delay before the onset of inhibition of dye transfer,\nsuggesting that other factors mediate the effects of amyloid-\nb on dye transfer.\nAmyloid-b impairs gap junctional transfer of\ncompounds with different size or charge\nCell-to-cell transfer of anionic dyes that are either larger\nwhen ionized; Figures 4c and 4d) than Lucifer Yellow VS (536\nDa when ionized; Figures 1 and 2) is also markedly lowered by\namyloid-b treatment.

Interpretation of the\ninhibitory effects on glucose metabolic pathways, glutamate\nuptake, signalling pathways, gap junctional communication\nand other processes that have been ascribed to amyloid\npeptides in other studies are complicated by the use of\nastrocytes that were cultured in media containing 25\u00ad40\nmmol/l glucose (Parpura-Gill et al., 1997; Me\ninformation regarding medium glucose concentration (Meske\nglucose level of 25 mmol/l is approx. 10-fold greater than that\nin normal rat brain, and it exceeds that in diabetic rat brain by\n3.6-fold; it is well known that prolonged hyperglycaemia\ncauses oxidative stress, glycation reactions and sorbitol\nproduction (Gandhi et al., 2010 and references cited therein).\nIn fact, astrocytes grown in high-glucose medium oxidize\nglucose and lactate at a rate half that of those grown in\nlow glucose (Abe et al., 2006).

Notably, non-\nactivated mixed cultures had similar dye-labelled areas as\nastrocyte cultures (Me\nmicroglia that remained in our non-activated astrocyte\ncultures (.90% are GFAP-positive cells) are unlikely to have\ncontributed to dye-transfer inhibition.\nHigh calcium levels can close gap junctions, but the\nphysiological relevance of the level required is not clear\n(Rozental et al., 2001). Amyloid peptides are thought to form\ncalcium channels in the astrocytic membrane, giving rise\nto intracellular calcium signals and oxidative stress due to\nactivation of NADPH oxidase (Abramov et al., 2004). Exposure\nof astrocytes to amyloid-b1\u00ad42\nincreases intracellular calcium\nconcentration, as well as the amplitude, velocity and travel\ndistance of mechanically induced calcium waves (Haughey\ncauses\nFigure 8 Representative images of Lucifer Yellow diffusion among\nastrocytes in slices from three brain regions of aged Alzheimer's transgenic\nmice\nBrain slices (250 mm thick) were prepared from hippocampus (a\u00adb), cerebral\ncortex (e) and inferior colliculus (f) of aged Alzheimer's transgenic mice.\nAstrocytes were identified as sulforhodamine-positive cells (a), then impaled\nwith a micropipette (b) containing Lucifer Yellow that was allowed to diffuse\ninto the astrocyte for 5 min (c).

In our gap junction assay\nprocedure, impaling an astrocyte would initiate calcium\nwaves, but dye spread does occur in control and amyloid-\ntreated cells, and the contribution of calcium to differential\nchannel closure in these two groups of cells, if any, is not\nclear. Other factors, such as amyloid-induced alterations in\nmembranes that may modify Cx function or level, altered\nsignalling cascades, and shifts in gene expression, may also be\ninvolved at different times after addition of monomerized\n. The basis for the inhibitory bioactivity of amyloid-b\non gap junctions in cultured astrocytes remains to be\nestablished in future studies.\nSurprisingly, the robust blockade of dye transfer within\nnetworks of amyloid-b-treated cultured cerebral cortical\nastrocytes did not occur in cerebral cortex, hippocampus or\ninferior colliculus of APP-transgenic mice (Figures 8\u00ad10). These\nfindings indicate that: (i) amyloid treatment alone is not\nsufficient to represent the more complex pathophysiology of\nastrocytic networks in the aged APP mouse brain, (ii) there may\nbe compensatory responses that maintains syncytial connec-\ntivity in APP mouse brain, beyond the localized up-regulation\nof immunoreactive Cx43 observed in human amyloid plaques\n(Nagy et al., 1996a) and (iii) global compared with regional\ndifferences do not explain the different results in cultured cells\nand brain slices. Discordant results in tissue culture-brain slice\nassays were not, however, an issue in our recent study of\nexperimental diabetes, in which both model systems exhibited\nreduced dye coupling and increased oxidative stress in spite of\nlarge differences in glucose level, time of exposure to high\nglucose and syncytial size (Gandhi et al., 2010). In the diabetic\nrat literature, plasma and brain glucose levels rise an average of\napprox. 3-fold to 27 and 7 mmol/l respectively (Gandhi et al.,\n2010), and the normal adult rat inferior colliculus has up to\ncultured cortical astrocytes (Ball et al., 2007 and references\ncited therein). In the present study, most slices from aged\ncontrol and APP mice had .100 coupled cells, with an average\nregional number of dye-coupled cells ranging from approx.\nthan in young adult rats. Peters et al. (2009) recently\ncharacterized properties of astrocytes in aged Alzheimer's\ntransgenic mice and observed modest syncytial labelling\ninto cells for 20 min via patch clamp pipettes containing a\n0.5% (13 mmol/l) solution] in young control mice and aged\nAlzheimer's mice, with no apparent relationship to distance of\nthe injected cell from an amyloid plaque. In contrast, their\naged control mice (.12 months) had no detectable networks\nin cerebral cortex and only three out of 20 cells in hippocampal\nslices were coupled. The reasons for lower coupling in aged APP\nmice and very poor dye transfer in their aged controls are\nnot known. Conceivably, differences might arise from the\ngenotype of the mice used in the studies by Peters et al. (2009)\nand by us, or from age-related differences in transfer of\nbiocytin compared with Lucifer Yellow VS. Also, it is important\nto recognize that changes in transfer of a specific dye do not\nnecessarily predict the passage of other compounds. For\nexample, when diffused into single astrocytes in culture or in\nbrain slices, hexose-6-phosphates are very poorly transferred\nthrough gap junctions compared with various fluorescent dyes\nthat were used as internal permeant standards in the same\nassays (Gandhi et al., 2009a). Our dye-transfer assays used high\nconcentrations of Lucifer Yellow VS to maximize sensitivity for\ndetection of astrocytic coupling and to more easily count\nlabelled cells in brain slices, since dye-labelled nuclei are more\nprominent with Lucifer Yellow VS compared with Lucifer\nYellow CH. Dye leakage from impaled cells is unlikely to cause\nsignificant labelling due to washout via the perfusion\nsolution and to negligible labelling by extracellular mem-\nbrane-impermeant dye; labelling of brain slices caused by\nmicropipette insertion or by damaging an impaled cell is very\nlow. Also, in our previous studies, Lucifer Yellow labelling of\ncultured astrocytes located at some distance from the scrape-\nload site was negligible (Gandhi et al., 2010), and efflux of\nLucifer Yellow (and, by inference, uptake from extracellular\nsources) from pre-loaded cells was not detectable unless cells\nwere exposed to a divalent-cation-deficient medium to open\n`hemichannel' or pannexin pores (Gandhi et al., 2009a). To\nsummarize, astrocytic gap junctional communication in\ndifferent model systems for Alzheimer's disease varies\nconsiderably, and in vivo responses may be influenced by\namyloid burden, age, local cytokine level, oxidative stress and\nother unidentified factors.\nMetabolite trafficking and brain imaging in\nAlzheimer's disease\nThe hippocampus and cerebral cortex are involved in memory\nand cognition, and these brain regions are, therefore,\nFigure 10 Dye transfer as function of age in control and Alzheimer's mice\nValues from all structures and all slices in Figure 9 are plotted as a function\nof age of the animal.\nNF Cruz, KK Ball and GA Dienel\n210 E 2010 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\ncommonly used as experimental systems for studies of\nAlzheimer's disease and loss of higher brain function.\nHowever, other brain systems are also involved in the disease,\nand, for example, Alzheimer's patients have hearing impair-\nment (Palmer et al., 1999) and abnormal auditory evoked\npotentials and latency responses associated with midbrain\u00ad\nbrainstem auditory processing (O'Mahony et al., 1994). The\ninferior colliculus, an auditory structure with the highest\nmetabolic rate in brain (Sokoloff et al., 1977), has amyloid\nplaques (Sinha et al. 1993) and a lower level of cytochrome\noxidase (Gonzalez-Lima et al. 1997), indicating a reduced\ncapacity for oxygen utilization. Dye transfer was therefore\nexamined in these three brain structures after testing a\nvariety of fluorescent compounds in tissue culture. Assay of\nlocal rates of glucose utilization using [18F]FDG-PET\n([18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography) has\nbeen an important tool to evaluate the progression and\ntreatment of Alzheimer's disease (Alexander et al., 2002), and\nmagnetic resonance spectroscopic studies using [13C]glucose\nare increasingly used to study brain diseases because fluxes of\nlabelled carbon into different pathways can be evaluated.\nProgressive mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired oxidative\nmetabolism of glucose in brain of Alzheimer's patients\n(Gibson et al., 2008) would increase lactate production and\nrelease from brain. Incomplete retention of labelled lactate\nand other diffusible compounds in regions of interest during\nmetabolic assays would contribute to underestimation of\nglucose utilization rates determined with labelled glucose\ncompared with fluorodeoxyglucose, the products of which\nare phosphorylated and trapped intracellularly. Also, increases\nin glycolytic flux in the early stages of the disease to\ncompensate for energy deficits arising from mitochondrial\ndamage could give the false impression that cellular function\nis normal, when, in fact, cellular damage is evolving, and\nby the time glucose utilization rates fall, the damage may\nbe irreversible or reflect cell death. For these reasons, it is\nparticularly important to use different approaches to\nevaluate functional metabolism in diseased brain. Our\nprevious studies have focused on evaluating the cellular\ncontributions to discordant images of auditory activation in\nrats derived from labelled glucose and deoxyglucose (Cruz\net al., 2007). The results strongly support the conclusions\nthat: (i) lactate release from activated brain accounts for\nmost of the `missing' glucose metabolites, (ii) lactate\ntransporters and astrocytic gap junctional trafficking are\ninvolved in this process and (iii) release of some glucose,\nlactate, other metabolites and amyloid-b occurs by lymphatic\ndrainage from the inferior colliculus through perivascular\nchannels to the cervical lymph nodes (Dienel and Cruz, 2008;\ndeposits accumulate in the parenchyma and perivascular\nspace in brain of animals with Alzheimer traits (e.g. Figure 7)\nand in Alzheimer's patients, and partial blockade of\nperivascular fluid flow is postulated to contribute to the\npathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (Carare et al., 2008;\nWeller et al., 2008). In diabetic patients, cerebrovascular\ndisease and thickening of the extracellular matrix would\nexacerbate this condition by impairing vascular elasticity,\ndiminishing arterial pulsations that power perivascular fluid\nflow and reducing the distribution within brain of fuel,\nsignalling molecules, neurotransmitters and electrolytes, as\nwell as clearance of metabolic by-products from activated\nregions. Further work is necessary to: (i) evaluate astrocytic\nnetworks in aged control brain compared with aged\nAlzheimer's brain and (ii) determine whether changes in\nmetabolite trafficking and functions of the neurovascular\nunit (i.e. interactions of astrocytes, neurons and endothelial\ncells involved in cerebrovascular and metabolic regulation)\ninfluence the outcome and interpretation of brain imaging\nand spectroscopic studies in Alzheimer's patients.\n"
