This study\napproaches performance from a broader perspective and examines whether the emotional intelligence competencies (EICs)\nof SPs, the leadership style of team leaders, social capital among team members, and human resource management (HRM)\npractices of software firms affect performance of SPs. It also tests whether the value of and opportunities for knowledge\nsharing moderate such relationships. Data were collected from 441 Indian SPs in a questionnaire survey. Fifty-five team\nleaders assessed the performance of SPs, and SPs assessed the other constructs. Results revealed that EICs, transformational\nleadership style, social capital, and HRM practices positively affect performance. EICs are the most important predictors\nof performance. Under high (low) value of and high (low) opportunities for knowledge sharing, the antecedents influencing\nperformance are strengthened (attenuated or nullified). The value of and opportunities for knowledge sharing are quasi-\nmoderators. These findings have significant implications for organizing effective work teams.\n",

The job performance of SPs and the\nemployment in information technology (IT) industry have\nincreased the contribution of the IT sector to India's gross\nEconomic Times, 2012). Despite this, the antecedents and\nfacilitators of SPs' performance are hardly examined. The\nresearch literature has provided a rich set of variables that\naffect their performance in the workplace. However, the\nways in which those variables affect productivity and perfor-\nmance are not well understood. The purpose of this study is\nto develop an integrated model of variables that determine\nSPs' performance. We begin with an overview of the con-\nstructs of productivity and performance described in the\nresearch literature. Following that, the known effects of spe-\ncific variables on performance will be used to motivate the\nproposed model.\nMeasuring SPs' Performance\nAssessing the performance of SPs is a difficult task. In some\ncontexts, performance is operationalized as input\u00adoutput\nproductivity. This approach to assessing performance is\nrather tenuous, as the inputs and outputs of projects can take\na month to a year or even more. In the software industry, SPs\nsimultaneously work on many projects and produce different\noutputs--graphics, expert systems, web traffic control, and\nmaintenance packages--that are difficult to specify in terms\nof quantity of inputs and outputs (Kemppila & Lonnqvist,\n2003). Objective measures of SPs' productivity (such as\nkilo-lines/man-months) are narrow and focus on lower order\nsingle constructs. Some indirect factors that influence pro-\nductivity cannot be easily measured, such as management\nculture, disturbances at work, and problems in information\nflow. There is no uniform procedure for assessing software\nproductivity that follows a normal distribution pattern that\nwould afford subsequent calibration. Software firms have\nsynonymously used measures of effectiveness, efficiency,\nquality, innovation, and profitability (Chilton & Hardgrave,\nThomas & Baron, 1994) for measures of productivity, and\nthey have linked these measures to SPs' performance.\n1Manipal Institute of Technology, India\n2Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India\n3Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nDamodar Suar, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian\nInstitute of Technology Kharagpur, West Bengal 721 302, India.\nEmail: ds@hss.iitkgp.ernet.in\nAntecedents and Moderators of Software\nProfessionals' Performance\nShiva Prasad H.

It includes not only the activi-\nties related to accomplishment of core job tasks but also a set\nof behaviors that employees contribute both directly and\nindirectly to organizational goals (Rich, LePine, & Crawford,\n2010). Performance requires a set of criteria for its evalua-\ntion depending on the nature of the job.\nTheoretical Framework for a\nPerformance Model\nGoleman (1995) has proposed that emotional intelligence\ncompetencies (EICs) can alone contribute to four fifths of\njob performance against one fifth of cognitive/rational intel-\nligence. In support of this assertion, Boyatzis, Goleman, and\nRhee (2000) have reported that employees with high levels\nof EICs are 3 times more effective than those with low levels\nof EICs. This is a strong assertion. However, there are coun-\nterclaims (Antonakis, Ashkanasy, & Dasborough, 2009). A\nmeta-analytic study (Van Rooy & Viswesvaran, 2004) reports\nonly a correlation of .19 between emotional intelligence and\nperformance outcomes. Accordingly, the position in this arti-\ncle is that group and enterprise level constructs may also play\na significant role in conjunction with individual level con-\nstructs of EICs, to determine workplace performance.\nLeadership is a predominant factor in influencing perfor-\nmance among group behaviors (Bass, 1985). Fostering social\ninteractions and attributes of trusting, sharing, and recipro-\ncating among SPs incorporated in social capital can build\nrelationships, resolve conflicts, and smooth group processes\nto improve performance. Enterprise level constructs are\nthose that are regulated by the top management. Among\nstructure, design, and culture of the enterprise, human\nresource management (HRM) practices can contribute to\nemployees' welfare, development, and commitment, which\ncan boost up performance as well. Given the meta-analytic\nfindings contrary to Goleman's (1995) claim, this study will\ntest an integrated model to simultaneously examine the affect\nof EICs, leadership, social capital, and HRM practices on\nSPs' performance and the constructs that boost the anteced-\nent\u00adconsequent relations. Furthermore, most of the studies\non SPs have been carried out in individualistic Euro-\nAmerican cultures. This study strives to extend those find-\nings to the collectivist culture of India to gauge whether the\nfindings from different cultural contexts reinforce each other.\nPotential Variables Influencing the\nPerformance of SPs\nMulti-Factor Performance\nA study on Indian SPs revealed six dimensions of perfor-\nmance (Prasad & Suar, 2010): (a) work-efficiency, (b) per-\nsonal resourcefulness, (c) inter- and intra-personal sensitivity,\n(d) productivity orientation, (e) timeliness, and (f) business\nintelligence. Work-efficiency focuses on independent think-\ning, ability to work on various projects simultaneously, pro-\ngramming skills, and customer orientation. Personal\nresourcefulness incorporates the abilities of SPs to be inno-\nvative and efficient, thereby adding value to the customer\nthrough products and services. Inter- and intra-personal sen-\nsitivity show not only individuals' responsibility at work but\nalso cooperativeness with the team members to complete the\njob. Productivity orientation entails the concern for quantity\nand quality of software along with overtime work. The time-\nliness dimension incorporates taking decisions and meeting\ndeadlines in completing the projects. Business intelligence is\na personal attribute for business sustenance in a competitive\nenvironment through advocating new ideas for improving\nproducts, services, and showing concern for profitability.\nMeasures of these six dimensions operationalize the con-\nstruct of performance in this study.\nEmotional intelligence was developed by Salovey and Mayer\ntency\" model. It is the ability of a person to cognitively\nassess emotions within oneself and recognize them in others,\nso as to modulate behavior (Salovey & Mayer, 1990). Simply,\nit is the use of emotions intelligently. EICs incorporate\n(a) self-awareness, (b) self-management, (c) social-aware-\nness, and (d) relationship management (Boyatzis et al.,\n2000). The former two entail personal and the latter two\ninter-personal competencies.\nBy understanding their own experiences, thoughts, and\nactions, self-aware persons realistically self-evaluate them-\nselves (Wynekoop & Walz, 2000) and openly express their\nfeelings, viewpoints, and focus on customer requirements\nmanagement includes self-control, drive for achievement,\ninitiatives, transparency, and personal goal-setting. SPs who\nhave higher self-management competencies can take initia-\ntive, exhibit creativity, and improve software quality, thereby\nfacilitating the success of software projects (Baddoo, Hall, &\nSocial-awareness includes empathy, service orientation,\nand organizational awareness. Empathy is not only reading\nthe subtleties of body language, but also grasping the unheard\nvoice beneath the spoken words (Goleman, 1998). Empathic\nemployees are trained to adopt themselves to a service orien-\ntation, treating clients and co-workers as important custom-\ners (Witt, 1999). Organizational awareness is the\nunderstanding of priorities and work processes. SPs, having\ngreater social-awareness, can interact and communicate with\noffshore clients, and show sensitivity to cross-cultural eti-\nquettes and different ethnic and religious backgrounds.\nRelationship management is a set of competencies that\ndeal with inspiring, influencing, resolving conflicts, collabo-\nrating with teams and acting as change agents. Inspiring is a\nPrasad et al. 3\nprocess of communicating, encouraging, and persuading oth-\ners, and elevating them to a higher plane. Conflict resolution\nis an ability to tactfully deal with the incompatible demands\non or off the job. Change-catalyst competence is necessary to\nadapt to the changing software specifications of clients. The\nabove discussion suggests that personal and inter-personal\ncompetencies in the workplace can positively affect\nperformance.\nLeadership Style\nThe prototype of leadership is transformational leadership.\nTransformational leaders possess the characteristics of char-\nismatic, ethical, and servant-leaders (Shiva & Suar, 2012),\nand are found to be universally effective (Atwater &\nBass and Avolio (1990a) have identified four dimensions\nof transformational leaders: (a) idealized influence (attribute\nand behavior), (b) inspirational motivation, (c) intellectual\nstimulation, and (d) individualized consideration. Leaders,\nhaving idealized attributes and behavior, are found to have\nprofound power and extraordinary influence on followers\n(Bass, 1985). Idealized actions of the leader transcend self-\ninterests for the benefits of the organization. Through com-\nmunication, the leader aligns the values and goals of the\norganization to subordinates. Intellectually stimulating lead-\ners encourage followers to view the world from new perspec-\ntives, that is, they question old assumptions, paradigms, and\nbeliefs. They appeal to followers' intellects by instilling\n\"problem awareness and problem-solving capabilities.\"\nBecause of intellectual stimulation, followers conceptualize\nand comprehend the problems they face and solve them.\nSuch a leader (Avolio, Gardner, Walumbwa, Luthans, &\nMay, 2004) through episodes, dialogues, and various actions\ntakes the followers to a higher plane, and they release their\nefforts accordingly. A leader displaying individualized con-\nsideration understands the employees' needs, aspirations,\nabilities, and accordingly provides different types of train-\ning, coaching, counseling, and opportunities for their partici-\npation in goal-setting, decision-making, and problem-solving\n(Avolio, Bass, Walumbwa, & Zhu, 2004). In the process,\nsubordinates improve their skills. A transformational leader\ngenerates positive work attitudes, mobilizes the minds of\nsubordinates, and empowers and enhances their performance\nresearch concluded that transformational leaders lead not\nonly their individual subordinates but also their teams and\norganizations to achieve higher levels of performance\nSocial Capital\nSocial capital incorporates (a) group characteristics, (b) gen-\neralized norms, (c) togetherness, (d) everyday socializing,\n(e) volunteerism, (f) trust, and (g) reciprocity (Narayan &\nCassidy, 2001). Group characteristics facilitate group mem-\nbers to carry out social activities. Generalized norms involve\ncompliance with group standards through which participants\nof the network improve their performance to match with the\nstandard. During a crisis, togetherness evokes strong social\nties in the network and, thus, improves confidence to per-\nform the job better. Everyday socializing strengthens friend-\nships and helps gathering current information about software\nprojects that assist SPs to make and execute decisions.\nVolunteerism goes with altruism. Volunteers commence their\nwork without seeking help from others. Such activities keep\nclients happy and build long-term relationships. Trust is an\nact of agreement about certain conditions and standards\ncan improve SPs' performance. Reciprocity is an attitude of\nhelping when employees are in distress (Portes, 1998) and\nresponding to customers' needs. Because SPs are clustered\ninto groups according to projects, domain expertise, and cus-\ntomers' base, they reciprocate within their network.\nA software project roughly passes through task definition,\ndesign specification, coding, installation, and maintenance.\nIt is less likely to succeed without task-related internal com-\nmunication (Brodbeck, 2001), cooperation, trust, and reci-\nprocity among team members when standardization of\nmethods and tools is low. Accordingly, the more social capi-\ntal among SPs, the more effective will be the project success\nthrough employees' performance.\nHRM Practices\nHRM practices include (a) rewards that drive performance;\n(b) development of skills, knowledge, and attitudes through\ncontinuous training to improve employees' performance;\n(c) manpower with requisite skills and competencies to exe-\ncute jobs; and (d) supportive workplaces (Appelbaum,\nrized that if the firm closely links rewards to performance,\nemployees are more likely to show high performance\n(Adams, 1965). Training and development activities for SPs\nfocus on multi-skilling, developing domain expertise, teach-\ning the right ways to do the job, and reducing dysfunctional\nbehavior, all of which are likely to improve their work behav-\nior vis-\u00e0-vis performance. Earlier studies affirm that HRM\npolicies and practices have positive effects on firm perfor-\nmance and productivity (Delaney & Huselid, 1996; Huselid,\n1995). Firm performance and productivity are outcomes of\nemployees'performance. Also, as the employees receive and\nperceive favorably the HRM practices, their performance\nSoftware firms focus on obtaining qualified people and\nrotating them across different jobs to make them multi-\nskilled. Staffing procedures bring into vacant positions peo-\nple with the required skills and knowledge to do the job.\nPromoting employees from within the firm is likely to\n4 SAGE Open\nprovide a strong motivation for employees to work harder to\nbe promoted. It signals that the firm considers its employees\nas long-term assets.\nAsupportive workplace includes the provisions of employ-\nees' stock-option plans, physical evidence, safety, security,\nand offshore assignments. Employees can work hard to\nincrease the quality of software products, so that the stock\nprice of the software firm does not decrease. As long as the\nstock price increases, employees can continue their jobs.\nPhysical evidence improves the decor of the workplace.\nAccording to the stimulus\u00adorganism\u00adresponse theory\n(Mehrabian & Russell, 1974), physical evidence (stimulus) of\nthe software firm can influence employees'(organism) behav-\nior (response). Physical evidence differentiates between\nfirms' interior decor through comfortable seating arrange-\nments, pleasant lighting, temperature, and cleanliness. It elic-\nits approach behavior toward places such as desire to stay,\nexplore, work, and affiliate. For example, Google (Inc.) pro-\nvides opportunities to SPs in architectural design to modify\ntheir workplace interiors. After global threats on the health\nand life of SPs, more and more software firms have focused\non improving employees' safety and security by providing\nsafe drinking water and high value insurance policies. With\noffshore assignments, SPs get exposed to different cultures,\npeople, and different ways of managing software. Software\nfirms with all such practices can promote employees' perfor-\nFacilitators of Performance\nIn knowledge-intensive software firms, SPs evaluate tasks\nand seek opportunities to gain useful information from col-\nleagues and group members. Valuing knowledge sharing\nreinforces SPs to exchange knowledge that will be cogni-\ntively and emotionally satisfying to colleagues. Avenues for\nknowledge sharing provide a platform and equal opportuni-\nties to all to learn, grow, and leverage their performance.\nValue of Knowledge Sharing\nKnowledge sharing enables communication, coding prac-\ntices, and reuse of software, which contribute to the effec-\ntiveness of SPs (McDougall & Beattie, 1998). The value of\nknowledge sharing includes the feeling and action for shar-\ning knowledge among colleagues (Minbaeva, 2008). When\nemployees value knowledge sharing, it brings more insights\nto software projects, helps sorting out project complexities,\nand increases performance (Jarvenpaa & Staples, 2001; Lin,\n2007).At times, even negligible pieces of knowledge become\nhighly valued benefactors in R&D projects (Armbrecht,\nconnect people (Spinello, 2000), and contribute to the proj-\nect success. Sharing valuable knowledge with peers and the\nteam leader makes SPs more committed, motivated, and pro-\nductive (Hislop, 2002). SPs who highly value knowledge\nsharing improve their performance compared with those who\nfind little value in knowledge sharing.\nOpportunities for Knowledge Sharing\nOpportunities for knowledge sharing through the Internet,\nintranet, group discussions, narrative experiences, blogs, and\nsocial networking create an environment of mutual trust,\ncooperation, and goodwill (Cheng, Hailin, & Hongming,\n2008). Such opportunities allow employees to collate, store,\nshare, modify, and use relevant knowledge. Employees share\nknowledge to meet the demands for new knowledge to\naccomplish project goals. Employees not only share difficul-\nties and hidden pitfalls in software projects, but also their\nintuitions and hunches based on \"experiential learning\"\n(Kolb, 1984). By sharing knowledge, employees learn the\nnitty-gritty of projects and clients'requirements from knowl-\nedge repositories (Bobbitt & Dabholkar, 2001; Gibbert &\nKrause, 2002). With positive attitudes, commitment, trust,\nand reciprocity among employees, knowledge sharing will\nincrease. With more opportunities for knowledge sharing,\nthe EICs of SPs, the transformational style of team leaders,\nthe social capital among SPs, and the HRM practices of firms\ninfluencing performance will be strengthened. The reverse\nwill happen with fewer opportunities for knowledge sharing.\nIn the absence of opportunities for knowledge sharing, it is\nimpossible to build knowledge repositories and encourage\nemployees to take initiative to share knowledge, integrate\nwork problems, supervisors' efforts, and teams' difficulties\nand successes.\nHypotheses and Proposed Model\nIn consideration of the existing research associated with\npotential variables affecting performance, the following\nmulti-part hypothesis (H) is proposed:\nHypothesis 1a (H1a): EICs of SPs will directly affect\ntheir job performance.\nHypothesis 1b (H1b): Transformational leadership of\nteam leaders will directly affect SPs' job performance.\nHypothesis 1c (H1c): Social capital among SPs will\ndirectly affect their job performance.\nHypothesis 1d (H1d): HRM practices of software firms\nwill directly affect SPs' job performance.\nVariables modifying antecedent\u00adconsequent relationships\nare called moderators. It is further proposed that\nHypothesis 2a (H2a): (i) Values of knowledge sharing\nand (ii) opportunities for knowledge sharing will have a\npositive moderating effect on H1a (EICs  job\nperformance).\nHypothesis 2b (H2b): (i) Values of knowledge sharing\nand (ii) opportunities for knowledge sharing will have a\nPrasad et al. 5\npositive moderating effect on H1b (leadership  job\nperformance).\nHypothesis 2c (H2c): (i) Values of knowledge sharing\nand (ii) opportunities for knowledge sharing will have a\npositive moderating effect on H1c (social capital  job\nperformance).\nHypothesis 2d (H2d): (i) Values of knowledge sharing\nand (ii) opportunities for knowledge sharing will have a\npositive moderating effect on H1d (HRM practices  job\nperformance).\nThe model, depicting the hypothesized relations, is illus-\ntrated (Figure 1). To sum up, the goal of this research was to\nassess and model the impact of the EICs of SPs along with\nthe transformational style of team leaders, the social capital\namong SPs, and the HRM practices of firms on performance\nof SPs. A related question is whether a high value of knowl-\nedge sharing and more opportunities for knowledge sharing\nboost such relationships.\nMethod\nParticipants\nSoftware engineers and senior software engineers were sur-\nveyed through questionnaires at three IT hubs: Bangalore,\nHyderabad, and Kolkata in India. The lists of employees\nwere procured from the human resource (HR) managers of\neight software firms at these places. A total of 1,400 software\nengineers and senior software engineers who had at least\n2 years of experience in the software firm were selected.\nThey were contacted through telephone calls and emails.\nWith their consent, 1,313 persons were personally handed\nover the questionnaire, and the questionnaire was sent to the\nremaining 83 persons through emails. They were assured\ncomplete anonymity of their responses. They were asked to\nreturn the questionnaire after a fortnight. In all, 371 SPs\nreturned the completed questionnaires when the researcher\npersonally approached them and 70 sent the completed ques-\ntionnaires through emails (effective return rate = 31.5%). An\nadditional 35 incomplete questionnaires received were\ndeleted from the database.\nThe sociodemographic profiles of the two groups of SPs\nwere compared with F and 2 tests (Table 1).

SPs reported the name of\ntheir team leaders, and accordingly in each questionnaire the\nname of the SP was included and given to the respective\nteam leader for assessing performance. Response categories\nwere given on a ladder with 10 steps ranging from poor (0) to\nexcellent (9). Validation of the scale to assess performance\nwas reported by Prasad and Suar (2010). In that validation,\nratings of SPs by team leaders were subjected to exploratory\nfactor analysis, and six factors were extracted that explained\n60.42% of total variance. The first factor loaded significantly\non 4 items of \"independent thinking,\" \"handling of multiple\nprojects,\" \"mastery of skills and techniques,\" and \"focus on\ncustomers.\" This factor was termed as \"work-efficiency.\"\nThe second factor loaded significantly on 3 items of \"effi-\ncient at work,\" \"creating value to customers,\" and \"creativ-\nity/innovation\"thatwasnamedas\"personalresourcefulness.\"\nThe third factor loaded on 2 items of \"responsible at work\"\nand \"cooperativeness with team members\" that was termed\nas \"inter- and intra-personal sensitivity,\" which can be\nrenamed as \"personal and group responsibility.\" The fourth\nfactor loaded on 3 items of \"working overtime to complete\nprojects,\" \"quantity concerned,\" and \"quality conscious-\nness,\" which was termed as \"productivity orientation.\" The\nfifth factor loaded on 2 items of \"taking decisions\" and\n\"meeting deadlines\" that was termed as \"timeliness.\" The\nlast factor loaded on 2 items of \"advocating new ideas for\nimproving product\" and \"showing concern for profitability\"\nthat was termed as \"business intelligence.\" High additive\nscores on items of a factor indicated more presence of that\nfactor.\nEICs.EICs were assessed with a 110-item scale developed\nby Boyatzis et al. (2000). The scale had four dimensions:\n(a) self-awareness, (b) self-management, (c) social-aware-\nness, and (d) relationship management. A sample item on (a)\nself-awareness includes \"I can recognize the situation that\narouses my emotion\"; (b) self-management includes \"I stay\ncomposed and positive, even in difficult moments\"; (c)\nsocial-awareness includes \"I can make myself available to\ncustomers/clients\"; and (d) relationship management\nincludes \"I identify and use opportunities to meet new people\nand develop new contacts.\" All items were rated on a Likert-\ntype scale--not at all true (0) to always true (4). High addi-\ntive scores on items of a dimension indicated more presence\nof that dimension.\nTransformational leadership.\nThe Multifactor Leadership\nQuestionnaire (Bass & Avolio, 1990b) was used to assess the\nextent of transformational leadership of the team leader. The\nscale had four dimensions: (a) idealized influence (attitude\nand behavior), (b) inspirational motivation, (c) intellectual\nstimulation, and (d) individualized consideration. A sample\nitem on (a) idealized influence includes \"My team leader\ngoes beyond self-interest for the good of the group\";\n(b) inspirational motivation includes \"My team leader talks\noptimistically about the future\"; (c) intellectual stimulation\nincludes \"My team leader suggests new ways of looking at\nhow to complete assignments\"; and (d) individualized con-\nsideration includes \"My team leader spends time teaching\nand coaching me.\" Response descriptions against each item\nwere given on a Likert-type scale ranging from strongly dis-\nagree (0) to strongly agree (4). High additive scores on items\nof a dimension indicated a more favorable evaluation of that\ndimension.\nSocial capital.Social capital was assessed using a 32-item\nscale developed by Narayan and Cassidy (2001). The scale\nhad seven dimensions: (a) group characteristics, (b) general-\nized norms, (c) togetherness, (d) everyday socializing,\n(e) volunteerism, (f) trust, and (g) reciprocity. A sample item\non (a) group characteristics includes \"I often participate in\nTable 1. Sample Profile.\nVariable Descriptive statistics Software engineers Senior software engineers\nGender\nMarital status\nNote. INR = Indian rupees.\nPrasad et al. 7\nthe activities of the group to which I belong\"; (b) generalized\nnorms includes \"I always attend frequent meetings arranged\nby the group\"; (c) togetherness includes \"I feel I am getting\ncloser to my network\"; (d) everyday sociability includes \"I\ntalk to my neighbors over the cubicle\"; (e) volunteerism\nincludes \"I volunteer myself for cultural programmes\";\n(f) trust includes \"I trust members of my sports community\";\nand (g) reciprocity includes \"I reciprocate to the community\nneeds.\" Response descriptions against each item were on a\nLikert-type scale--from a very small extent (0) to a very\nlarge extent (4). High additive scores on items of a dimen-\nsion indicated a more favorable evaluation of that\ndimension.\nHRM practices.HRM practices were assessed using the\ninstrument developed by Dechawatanapaisal (2005). The\ndimensions of HRM practices were (a) performance-linked\nincentives, (b) training and development, and (c) staffing.\nAnother dimension added to the construct was (d) quality of\nwork life. A sample item to measure (a) performance-linked\nincentives includes \"Whenever I do a good job, my perfor-\nmance is noticed and rewarded\"; (b) training and develop-\nment includes \"Management in my software firm stresses the\nimportance of training and development\"; (c) staffing\nincludes \"Staffing process in my firm is rigid\"; and (d) qual-\nity of work life includes \"My company has the policy to send\nemployees for offshore projects.\" Response descriptions\nagainst each item were given on a Likert-type scale--\nstrongly disagree (0) to strongly agree (4). High additive\nscores of items on a dimension indicated a more favorable\nevaluation of that dimension.\nValue of knowledge sharing. Four items developed to measure\n\"value of knowledge sharing\" include (1) \"purpose of shar-\ning knowledge,\" (2) \"content of sharing knowledge,\"\n(3) \"clarity of sharing knowledge,\" and (4) \"utility of knowledge\nsharing.\" Response options for each item used four 10-point\nbipolar adjectives--unpleasant\u00adpleasant, harmful\u00adbeneficial,\nbad\u00adgood, and worthless\u00advaluable, respectively. High additive\nscores on items indicated more knowledge sharing.\nOpportunities for knowledge sharing.This was assessed on\neight items developed by Lin (2007). A sample item includes\n\"I take initiation to set up group meetings to exchange rele-\nvant information.\" All positively keyed items were rated on a\n5-point Likert-type scale--highly unpleasant (0) to highly\npleasant (4). High additive scores on items indicated greater\nopportunities for knowledge sharing.\nThe convergent and discriminant validity of the constructs\nwere tested by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The\nAmos 4.0 software package was used (Arbuckle & Wothke,\n1999). We conservatively used the factor loading of an item\nto be  .3 for retention in a construct. The purpose was to\nidentify and eliminate poorly performing items. Along with\ndescriptive statistics, various fit measures of comparative fit\nindex (CFI), goodness of fit index (GFI), normed fit index\n(NFI), and root mean square error of approximation\n(RMSEA) are given in Table 2.\nAlong with the validity of items, the inter-item consis-\ntency of each item was reported. Barring a few dimensions\non performance (Prasad & Suar, 2010), Cronbach's alpha\nreliability was acceptable in all constructs (>.60).\nThe mean of each variable was estimated considering the\nadditive score of the items on a variable and dividing that by\nthe number of items in that variable to keep the score within\nthe range of the scale. The validity of all the scales was\nacceptable. CFI and GFI indices were above 0.80, except for\nthe dimensions on EICs. Although the constructs did not\nreach ideal fit levels (0.90), the constructs could not be con-\nsidered invalid because the minimum fit of the model was\nachieved and the regression coefficients from the observed\nvariables to the latent construct were significant.\nProcedure\nA cross-section of 441 SPs responded to a questionnaire sur-\nvey on sociodemographic variables, EICs, transformational\nleadership, social capital, HRM practices, value of knowl-\nedge sharing, and opportunities for knowledge sharing.\nFifty-five team leaders assessed the performance of SPs.\nResults\nPearson's correlations among the studied variables (Table 3)\nrevealed the following relationships:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Six dimensions of performance directly inter-related\namong themselves significantly suggesting that the\nincrease in one dimension of performance went with\nthe increase in other dimensions of performance.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Barring a few relations, dimensions of EICs including\nself-awareness, self-management, social-awareness,\nand relationship management varied positively with\nthe six dimensions of performance.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The transformational leadership dimensions of inspi-\nrational motivation and intellectual stimulation fre-\nquently and directly increased with the six dimensions\nof performance.

Barring few excep-\ntions, the reported relations supported the hypothe-\nsized directions.\nLatent variable structural equation modeling (LVSEM)\nwas adopted to test the hypotheses. LVSEM reveals anteced-\nent\u00adconsequent relationships that are unobserved in bidirec-\ntional correlations. It incorporates measurement models and\nstructural relationships. It controls measurement errors--\n(a) random and (b) systematic. Random errors occur due to\ndifficulties in measuring the constructs accurately. The con-\nvergent and discriminant validity of each indicator variable\nwas established with its significant loading on the respective\nlatent construct using CFA. Systematic errors occur due to\nfactors such as social desirability, common method bias (e.g.,\nscale type, rater, or context), and response biases (e.g., leni-\nency, yea-saying, or nay-saying). Systematic errors\n(Podsakoff, MacKenzie, & Podsakoff, 2003) were controlled\nprocedurally, collecting data on job performance of SPs from\ntheir team leaders and on other variables from SPs at differ-\nent time periods using different questionnaires.\nIn LVSEM, the standardized path coefficients are similar\nto standardized beta values in multiple regression analysis.\nThe standardized paths from observed variables to latent\nconstructs were significant, suggesting that the observed\ndimensions of EICs, transformational leadership, social capi-\ntal, and HRM practices were measuring their latent construct.\nSupporting four parts of the first hypothesis, an increase in\nEICs, transformational leadership, social capital, and HRM\npractices improved the job performance of SPs (Table 4).\nFrom the standardized regression weights of all con-\nstructs, it was observed that EICs of SPs were the most\nimportant antecedent to determine their job performance.\nThe standardized regression weight of EICs alone was about\n2 times greater than the combined standardized regression\nweights of transformational leadership, social capital, and\nHRM practices (Figure 2).\nTo test the second hypothesis depicting moderator effects,\ntwo groups of structural equation modeling were performed\nusing median split samples for value of and opportunities for\nknowledge sharing because each moderator was an observed\nvariable. The same structural equation modeling as shown in\nFigure 2 was estimated for high (above median) and low\nTable 3. Inter-Correlations Among Studied Variables.\nNote.

For a\nmore rigorous comparison, two tests for each high and low\ngroup were conducted for each moderating variable, based\non four corresponding models A, B, C, and D proposed by\nDabholkar and Bagozzi (2002). Four models using SEM\nwere constrained in terms of error variances explained by\nlatent variables and path coefficients among latent con-\nstructs. Model A was constrained to be the same across high\nand low groups in error variances and path coefficients. In\nModel B, only error variances were constrained and in Model\nD only path coefficients were constrained. With regard to\nModel C, both path coefficients and error variances were free\nacross the two groups. Comparing the constrained with free\nmodels, if the 2 differs significantly between models such as\nA and B (or C and D), this could be from path coefficients\nand if the 2 differs between A and D (or B and C), this could\nbe from error variances in the dependent variable. Therefore,\nif the variable of interest is a true moderator, Models A and B\n(or C and D) should be significantly different.\nAccording to the results, 2 differences between pairs of\ngiven models indicated that there were significant differ-\nences between Models A and B on value of knowledge shar-\ning and opportunities for knowledge sharing for both the\nhigh and low groups (Table 5). This suggested the presence\nof moderating effects.\nTesting was carried out to verify whether the changes in\ncoefficients were due to group differences and not due to\nmeasurement error. If the chi-square difference between the\nhigh and low groups divided by the change in degree of free-\ndom (2 / df) was significant, then there were significant\nmoderating effects across the low and high groups. The high\nand low groups on value of and opportunities for knowledge\nsharing differed significantly because the 2 difference for\none degree of freedom was significant. Thus, the moderators\nat high and low values affected differently the antecedent\u00ad\nconsequent relationships (Table 6). Only after obtaining evi-\ndence of this, standardized regression weights were compared\nacross the high and low group levels.\nThe path coefficients suggested that with high values of\nknowledge sharing and opportunities for knowledge sharing,\nit followed that EICs, transformational style, social capital,\nand HRM practices influencing performance were strength-\nened, and with low values of knowledge sharing and oppor-\ntunities for knowledge sharing, such relationships were\nattenuated or nullified. Value of knowledge sharing varied\ndirectly with performance dimensions of personal resource-\nfulness and timeliness, and opportunities for knowledge\nsharing positively related to performance dimensions of\nwork-efficiency, productivity orientation, timeliness, and\nbusiness intelligence. Because value of knowledge sharing\nand opportunities for knowledge sharing varied positively\nwith the dimensions of performance (Sharma, Durand,\n& Gur-Arie, 1981), they were quasi/partial moderators\n(Table 7). These findings supported the four components of\nthe second hypothesis.\nThe full hypothesized model stating the relations between\nthe antecedents and consequences along with the moderators\nis shown in Figure 3.\nBI\nTI\nPO\nPGR\nPR\n\n\n\n\n\nQWL\n\n\n\n\nST\nTD\nPLI\nTLS\nSC\nPER\nIS\nIC\nII\nTR\nGC\nGN\nTO\nES\nVO\nRE\nIM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOA\nSM\nRM\nSA\nFigure 2.

Findings suggest that EICs of SPs, trans-\nformational leadership style of team leaders, social capital\namong SPs, and HRM practices provided by software firms\nincreased SPs' performance. EICs of SPs were found to be\nthe most important predictor of performance. EICs, transfor-\nmational leadership, social capital, and HRM practices influ-\nencing job performance were strengthened (attenuated or\nnullified), under high (low) value of and opportunities for\nknowledge sharing.\nAntecedents of Performance\nJob performance of SPs is the criterion that guides decisions\non their training, coaching, counseling, participation, trans-\nfer, promotion, pay-rise, and even demotion and lay-off. If\nthe SPs evaluate their performance, they are more likely to\nover-rate themselves. Accordingly, the team leader evaluated\nthe performance of SPs in his or her team. In earlier studies\n2012), supervisors similarly evaluated the performance of\nsubordinates' on a set of behaviors including core job tasks.\nThis procedure arrested common method bias because the\nperformance of SPs was assessed by team leaders at a differ-\nent time compared with the responses of SPs to other con-\nstructs of the study.\nCorroborating earlier findings that job performance is\ndetermined more by emotional intelligence than cognitive\nintelligence (Boyatzis & Sala, 2004; Cherniss & Goleman,\nstudy suggest that SPs having high EICs are better perform-\ners. The model suggests that SPs with high EICs show\nbehavior consistent with job demands when the job and orga-\nnizational environment call for high job performance\n(Boyatzis, 1982). Self-awareness and self-managerial skills\ntune the SPs emotional framework to be adjustive, resilient,\nand responsive to customers' demands. This intra-personal\ncompetency includes not only personal attributes of confi-\ndence, optimism, proactivity, self-control, emotional matu-\nrity, and tolerance for ambiguity but also contextual\nfacilitative attributes of strategic goal-setting, team building,\nand customer focus. All these in tandem increase\njob performance. SPs with more inter-personal competency\nbetter synchronize their self-generated emotions with emo-\ntions of peers, clients, and team leaders. Empathizing with\npeers during pause-periods helps SPs to overcome fatigue\nand focus more on software quality. SPs' emotional attach-\nment with clients on successive interactions inspires rework-\ning software products to satisfy clients. An emotional\naffection in the workplace helps cultivate organizational and\ncultural etiquettes when dealing with clients from different\nethnic and religious backgrounds.\nThe findings concur with the earlier results that SPs writ-\ning open source code increased their job performance work-\ning under transformational team leaders (Li, Tan, & Teo,\n2012). Informal discussion with the SPs revealed that their\nteam leaders were senior to them. They and their team lead-\ners had worked as colleagues in the past. The team leaders\ninfluenced colleagues and juniors to achieve project objec-\ntives. Through their deeds, they were able to mobilize the\njuniors, build trust, and bring the SPs'talent to the surface for\nachieving goals of projects vis-\u00e0-vis software firms.\nThe model further suggests that SPs become confident,\nachievement driven, and courageously take up challenging\ntasks of software development under transformational team\nleaders. Team leaders enhance SPs' effectiveness encourag-\ning innovative ways to do the job, inspiring and elevating\nthem to a higher plane, and removing deficiencies through\nteaching, training, and counseling. SPs can withstand the\nchallenges posed by clients' requirements because the team\nleaders have intellectually stimulated and encouraged SPs to\nthink critically and do the job in novel ways. This is parallel\nto the \"Pygmalion effect.\" The team leader inspires, stimu-\nlates, and expects higher performance from SPs, and SPs\nperform accordingly.\nThe model also suggests that SPs overcome the pressure\nof performance through cooperation, mutual support, and\nnetworking with others (Taeube, 2005). They practice togeth-\nerness with colleagues and peers, interacting with them and\ncollecting insightful information about the project that helps\nimprove performance. With freedom of expression and inter-\naction with talented engineers, SPs improve their knowledge\nabout how to contribute to the project.\nThisstudycomplementstheevidence(Dechawatanapaisal,\n2005) that improved HRM practices do increase perfor-\nmance. The model indicates that HRM practices motivate\nTable 7.

SPs conscientiously attend training and\ndevelopment programs offered by the firm to improve their\ndomain expertise and multi-skilling abilities. Performance-\nlinked incentives reinforce engagement in work activities,\noffering excellent services to the clients/customers, adhering\nto norms of firms, and bringing discipline to the workplace.\nThe staffing function hires the right people to handle the job.\nThrough staffing, SPs design more bug-free and more agile\nprograms with appropriate lines of code. The top manage-\nments of software firms are quick to respond to needs of\nemployees about quality workplace. A case in point is the\nMicrosoft Company (Redmond, USA). SPs are given a free\nhand to purchase and place orders for any item that they con-\nsider essential to improve the quality of the workplace with-\nout hierarchical hassles (Microsoft, 2006). If the SPs are\nmore reciprocated, satisfied, trained, and provided incentive\nin accordance with performance, they are more likely to\nmeet clients' requirements. When the needs of SPs' are met\nin a conducive work environment, their performance\nincreases to meet the requirements of external clients (Kotler,\nCognitive intelligence assesses analytical and language\nabilities. Although it can ensure quality and quantity of per-\nformance, SPs are less likely to vary in it because they have\nto continuously pass through a series of such tests. Supporting\nthe observation of Boyatzis et al. (2000), EICs are found to\nbe the most important predictor of job performance.\nModerators of Performance\nValue of and opportunities for knowledge sharing make the\nexchange of knowledge easier among SPs (Minbaeva, 2008).\nOpportunities for knowledge sharing have reciprocally ben-\nefited the individual employees as well as others in innova-\ntion and idea generation. Under favorable conditions, EICs,\ntransformational leadership style, social capital, and HRM\npractices have increased performance. Contrarily, when such\nfavorable conditions are lower, the antecedents have attenu-\nated or nullified their relationship with job performance.\nImplications and Limitations\nThis study contributes to current knowledge of variables\naffecting SPs' performance, and it has implications for the\nworkplace. EICs are found to be the most important predic-\ntor of performance. In addition, EICs, transformational lead-\nership style, social capital, and HRM practices influencing\nthe SPs' performance can further improve performance with\nhigh value of and more opportunities for knowledge sharing.\nWhile recruiting and selecting potential SPs, a HR manager\ncan select those having high EICs to maximize workplace\nPER\nBI\nTI\nPO\nPGR\nPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh/low OKS\nHigh/low VKS\n\n\nTLS\nSC\nHRMP\nQWL\nST\nT\nD\nPLI\n\n\nIS\nIC\nII\nTR\nGC\nGN\nTO\nES\nVO\nRE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOA\nSM\nRM\nSA\nIM\nFigure 3.

After recruitment and selection, fine-tuning the\nleadership style, and improving social capital and HRM\npractices can further boost performance. Moreover, aware-\nness about the value of knowledge sharing in complex soft-\nware projects and exchange of work-related information\nthrough group discussions, blog, networking, You Tube, and\nFacebook can help SPs to augment their knowledge vis-\u00e0-vis\nperformance.\nThere are certain limitations of this study. First, the indi-\nvidual level construct of EICs of 441 SPs, the group level\nconstruct of transformational leadership and social capital\nof 55 teams, and the enterprise level construct of HRM prac-\ntices of eight firms call for a multi-level statistical analysis.\nHowever, the relatively small number of companies could\nnot yield sufficient statistical power to conduct a three-level\nanalysis. However, depending on group members' behav-\niors, including communication, politics, and conflicts, the\nperception of leadership style, social capital, and HRM\npractices will vary from one SP to another. Moreover, job\nperformance, the outcome construct of the study, was\nassessed individually. Therefore, the SP was the unit of\nanalysis.\nSecond, the data have been collected from IT hubs at\nBangalore, Hyderabad, and Kolkata in India. Moreover, the\nLVSEM includes five latent variables studied through 27\nobserved variables (Note: Four for EICs, four for transfor-\nmational leadership style, seven for social capital, four for\nHRM practices, and six for performance. In addition, there is\none observed variable for value of knowledge sharing and\nanother for opportunities for knowledge sharing.). Estimating\nand 27 observed variables requires a minimum of 463\nrespondents if one wishes to detect effects with a statistical\npower level of .8 and with a small effect-size of .10 (Cohen,\nof the model. Although the sample-size is adequate for the\nstructural model, LVSEM falls short by 22 respondents to\ndetect effects. Therefore, caution must be exercised in gener-\nalizing the findings.\nConclusion\nReviewing the literature from individualistic Euro-American\ncultures, a model of SPs'performance was proposed specify-\ning the antecedents and facilitators of performance. Analysis\nof information collected from the collectivist culture of\nIndian SPs supports the model suggesting its cross-cultural\nvalidity and application in work settings.\nExtending Goleman's (1995) proposition, transforma-\ntional leadership, social capital, and HRM practices in soft-\nware firms along with SPs' EICs are found to improve the\nperformance of SPs. Such relationships are also found to be\nelevated under high values of and opportunities for knowl-\nedge sharing.\n"
