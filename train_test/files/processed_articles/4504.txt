    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis qualitative study examines membership processes in groups operating in\nan uncertain environment that prevents them from fully predefining new mem-\nbers' roles. I describe how nine elite high-end, cutting-edge culinary groups in\nthe U.S. and Europe, ranging from innovative restaurants to culinary R&D\ngroups, use negotiated joining--a previously undocumented process--to sys-\ntematically construct and fill these emergent, open-ended roles. I show that\nnegotiated joining is a consistently patterned, iterative process that begins with\na role that both aspirant and target group explicitly understand to be provisional.\nThis provisional role is then jointly modified and constructed by the aspirant and\ntarget group through repeated iterations of proposition, validation through trial\nand evaluation, and selective integration of validated role components. The ini-\ntially provisional role stabilizes and the aspirant achieves membership if enough\nrole components are validated; otherwise the negotiated joining process is\nabandoned. Negotiated joining allows the aspirant and target group to learn if a\nmutually desirable role is likely and, if so, to construct such a role. In addition,\nthe provisional roles in negotiated joining can support absorptive capacity by\nallowing novel role components to enter target groups through aspirants'\nefforts to construct stable roles for themselves, while the internal adjustment\ninvolved in integrating newly validated role components can have the unin-\ntended side effect of supporting adaptation by providing opportunities for the\ngroups to use these novel role components to modify their role structure and\ngoals to suit a changing and uncertain environment. Negotiated joining thus\nreveals role ambiguity's hitherto unexamined beneficial consequences and pro-\nvides a foundation for a contingency theory of new-member acquisition.\n",

Existing theories based on selection\nprocesses assume that organizations have or can develop predefined roles with\nwhich to acquire new members. Because organizations operating in uncertain\nenvironments often cannot fully predefine the roles their new members will\nhave to perform (reviewed in Singh, 2008), these roles are necessarily emer-\ngent and open-ended. Consequently, existing theories cannot--and were not\nintended to--fully address situations in which organizations must acquire new\nmembers whose roles are open-ended or the dynamics of membership in elite\ngroups that must be staffed from elite aspirant pools and that face uncertain\nfuture demands, for instance, partnership groups within professional service\nfirms, tenured faculty ranks within prestigious academic departments, and top\nmanagement teams within firms operating in rapidly changing industries.\nThese observations generate the broad question that motivates this study:\nWhat systematic processes and practices do such organizations use to acquire\nnew members when their roles are open-ended and mostly non-predefined? I\nanswer that question by documenting the previously unexamined process of\nnegotiated joining in a setting in which external uncertainty often necessitates\nopen-ended roles for new members: elite groups working in cutting-edge, high-\nend cuisine. I begin by examining previous research on selection and job defini-\ntion to develop a theoretical framework for understanding how organizations\nmight construct and fill open-ended roles. I then present a process model of\nnegotiated joining and its distinctive characteristics, subprocesses and associ-\nated practices, and enabling conditions.\nA member's role in an organization consists of the functions he or she per-\nforms: formal and established functions (the job specification), informal and\nemergent functions, and self-defined and socially defined functions (Ilgen and\nthat target groups create roles for new members before roles are matched\nthe roles they want to perform in specific target groups (Granovetter, 1995;\nJudge and Cable, 1997), and these target groups are assumed to acquire new\nmembers by selecting for best fit from among the aspirants that they have\nattracted (Jovanovic, 1979). This study concentrates solely on the latter: the\nprocesses target groups use to systematically acquire new members.\nIn selection, the target group's goal is to optimize two types of new-member\nsimple fit with a predefined role (Arthur et al., 2006). The greater the fit\nbetween the selected individual and the predefined role, the more successful\nthe target group is at selection. Selection is conceptualized as a linear process\nof applying appropriate selection methods (summarized in Stewart and Carson,\ntion methods cannot work without a predefined set of criteria for deciding\nbetween aspirants to a given predefined role. Due to this fundamental require-\nment and assumption, research and theory in selection were not intended to--\nand cannot--address situations in which roles are open-ended. Theories of\nhow jobs are defined and shaped, however, provide some limited insight into\nhow emergent, open-ended roles might be constructed and filled. Three per-\nspectives in this area are particularly relevant: research on idiosyncratic jobs, on\njob assembly, and on job crafting.\nIdiosyncratic jobs. Selection has traditionally been presented as a\nsystematic, managerially driven, top-down process. Research on idiosyncratic\njobs offers an alternative view that encompasses two phenomena:\n(1) opportunistic hiring into jobs specifically created to fit new members and\n(2) evolution of incumbents' jobs during their tenure (Miner and Estler, 1985;\nMiner, 1987). These jobs are identified as idiosyncratic because they are highly\npersonalized and also because they result from individual action by hiring\nmanagers (in the case of opportunistic hiring) and incumbents (in the case of\nrole evolution). Idiosyncratic jobs have been found to be associated with\nincreased mission ambiguity and resource uncertainty and are thought to be\nthe product of adaptive actions by managers and incumbents, possibly\nrepresenting ``intelligent action in the face of uncertainty and ambiguity''\n(Miner, 1987: 334). This perspective suggests that open-ended roles can be\nconstructed not only from the top down by managers acting on behalf of the\nfirm but also from the bottom up by individuals acting out of self-interest\nJob assembly. Whereas selection requires predefined integral roles, job-\nassembly theory suggests that jobs are put together out of multiple tasks\n(Cohen, 2012). These tasks can enter groups through active search and passive\nreception; they can also be generated by the learning that occurs in the course\nof work or be part of existing ideas about jobs. Job-assembly theory thus indi-\ncates that job design is an ``evolving response to the ebb and flow of informa-\ntion and interactions'' within organizations (Cohen, 2012: 450). This perspective\nsuggests that the construction of open-ended roles is likely to be an iterative\nand evolutionary process operating on the components of roles rather than on\nmonolithic roles.\nJob crafting. In contrast to the static roles that selection depends on,\njob-crafting theory proposes that roles are plastic and can be shaped by role\nincumbents. Research in this area documents how employees use interactions\nwith coworkers to modify the task, cognitive, and relational boundaries of\ntheir prescribed jobs ``to create work with which they are more satisfied''\n(Wrzesniewski and Dutton, 2001: 181). This perspective suggests that role con-\nstruction can be driven by individuals motivated to expend effort to modify their\nroles to increase their satisfaction. It also indicates that a significant part of role\nconstruction happens through interactions and interpersonal sensemaking and\nnegotiation (Wrzesniewski, Dutton, and Debebe, 2003).\nThese three theoretical perspectives suggest that open-ended roles are\nlikely to be constructed and filled through iterative and evolutionary processes\nthat (1) operate on role components rather than on monolithic roles, (2) are\nmotivated by individuals' desire for satisfying work, (3) are responsive to exter-\nnal uncertainty and ambiguity, and (4) happen in the course of interpersonal\ninteraction. The interactive, constructive nature of these processes is consis-\ntent with theories of organization around emergent relationships (Stewart and\nCarson, 1997), of the continuous social interpretation of organizational compo-\nthe potential for negotiation to generate novel social understandings interac-\ncrafting, job assembly, and idiosyncratic jobs remains insufficient to explain\nhow an organization that must construct and fill new open-ended roles can do\nso systematically.\nExisting research depicts emergent jobs as the product of individual, unco-\nordinated action without top-down organizational involvement (Miner, 1987,\n1990), though the widespread nature of emergent roles in some settings sug-\ngests that they can also result from systematic processes stemming from\nintentional organizational action. Job assembly focuses on formal tasks, though\nnon-task role components (Parsons, 1956) are likely to be especially important\ncomponents of an individual's role in a group facing high levels of external\nuncertainty (Ilgen and Hollenbeck, 1991). Job crafting focuses on employees'\nmotivations and actions and tells us little about how job crafting affects (and is\naffected by) other members and the group as a whole, though these contextual\neffects are likely to be significant (Berg, Wrzesniewski, and Dutton, 2010).\nFinally, all three perspectives consider only role-shaping actions taken by\nemployees who are already members of the organization, leaving aspirants out\nof the picture.\nThis paper attempts to answer some questions left unasked by previous\nresearch: What systematic processes do organizations use to acquire new\nmembers when task and non-task components of their roles are open-ended,\nnot predefined? What processes allow these open-ended roles to be con-\nstructed and filled, and how do they affect the roles of both aspirants and\nincumbents? And, finally, what practices are associated with these processes?\nSuch questions deal with poorly characterized processes and are best\naddressed in settings in which the phenomena under investigation are likely to\nbe clearly observable (Pettigrew, 1990). This study therefore begins to answer\nthese questions in an unconventional setting (Bamberger and Pratt, 2010) in\nwhich open-ended roles are the rule rather than the exception: elite groups\nworking in high-end, cutting-edge cuisine. Though these elite groups range\nfrom small restaurant operating teams to culinary R&D labs, open-ended roles\nare common to them all.\nHigh-end, Cutting-edge Culinary Work\nAmong high-end culinary groups, innovation has become a key differentiating\nfactor and source of competitive advantage, the latest stage in the constantly\nevolving identity work that has characterized the institutionalization of high-end\nculinary work in recent history (Rao, Monin, and Durand, 2003). Because novel\noutput is now so important, the elite groups working in high-end, cutting-edge\ncuisine invest considerable time and effort in innovation, often organizing their\noperations and service models around research and development. These elite\ngroups work on creating new ingredients, cooking processes, and equipment,\nwith the intent of eventually creating new dishes and dining experiences\nBecause their identity depends so much on being perceived as innovative,\nthese elite groups generate novel ideas rapidly. They must also constantly\nrespond to the work of competing groups to differentiate themselves and\nreach and remain at the high end of the industry. As a senior chef at a\nEuropean restaurant said, ``We're not in a world where you can learn the tech-\nniques and then coast for years anymore. Now there's, like, something new to\nhave to think about every day. We're running just to stay in place'' (I-46).1 The\nstate of the art in this industry changes so quickly that demands placed on\nthese groups are unpredictable, making individual members' roles difficult or\nimpossible to define in advance--an ideal setting in which to examine how\ngroups acquire new members with open-ended roles.\nMETHODS\nThis study focuses on how elite culinary groups--the target groups to which\npotential members aspire--manage new-member acquisition from their\nrespective aspirant pools instead of how and why aspirants choose the particu-\nlar target groups they apply to. Consequently, my unit of analysis is the joining\nprocess through which a stable role was constructed for and by the aspirant or,\nconversely, through which the target group and aspirant realized that a stable\nrole was unlikely. I treat each individual moving through this process at a partic-\nular group as a case, analyzing the narratives within each case (Dyer and\nWilkins, 1991) to describe similarities in the processes aspirants go through.\nI developed the cases from in-depth, unstructured interviews with 88 individ-\nuals working in high-end cuisine and more than a thousand hours of ethno-\ngraphic observation time spent with nine internationally renowned task-\noriented groups in North America and Europe working in high-end cuisine. In-\ndepth interviews and extended ethnographic observation (Becker et al., 1976;\nGeorge and Bennett, 2005) are appropriate for investigating and theorizing\nabout processes such as negotiated joining that are not yet thoroughly\nresearched (Edmondson and McManus, 2007). These cases incorporated per-\nspectives from both the focal aspirant and multiple incumbents from the target\ngroup, and the set of cases contained both cases that resulted in stable roles\nfor the aspirants and those that did not. This multi-perspective, multiple-case\nanalysis was an attempt to mitigate the tendency to misjudge the extent to\nwhich a single case is generally representative (Tversky and Kahneman, 1986).\n1 I = an incumbent in a target group and A = an aspirant who hopes to join the target group; the\nnumber following denotes an individual respondent in this study. I-46 is the 46th of 55 incumbents.\nData Collection\nI acquired respondents and observation sites using snowball referrals (as\ndescribed in Biernacki and Waldorf, 1981) from initial contacts who were promi-\nnent in and familiar with the industry. I interviewed 88 respondents in total, in\nmany cases in multiple interviews. A few were dedicated interviews, but most\nwere real-time interviews conducted ad hoc in the course of work or casual\nInterview times with respondents ranged from 45 minutes to over three\nhours, and 33 respondents were prospective members (``aspirants,'' labeled\nA-1 through A-33 in the following analysis), while 55 respondents were current\nmembers of a group (``incumbents,'' labeled I-1 through I-55). Of the 33 aspir-\nants, 14 were stagiaires--people working temporary and usually unpaid stints\nat observation sites. Respondents' locations were about evenly divided\nbetween North America (48) and Europe (40), and their gender and age makeup\nwas approximately representative of cutting-edge, high-end culinary groups: 74\nrespondents were male, and 68 were in their 20s and 30s (two were in their\nI initially recorded interviews whenever my respondents permitted me to do\nso, taking notes during the interview and transcribing selectively afterwards,\nbut I soon discovered that kitchen background noise made audio recordings of\ninterviews largely unusable. I eventually abandoned the recording apparatus\nwhenever I was interviewing someone in a working environment and relied\ninstead on pen-and-paper field notes or, at some sites, field notes written\ndirectly into an on-site lab computer. I combined partial interview transcripts\n(when available) with notes written up during and after interviews and analyzed\nthem for instances of joining. At several points in the analysis, I contacted\nrespondents to ask clarifying questions about the setting.\nOver a four-year period, I gained research access to nine groups and visited\neach group several times, each visit lasting between ten days and six weeks.\nTable 1 summarizes information about these field sites, including observation\ntime spent at each location. Of the nine groups, five operated a single restau-\nrant, two conducted R&D for restaurant groups, and two conducted R&D\nindependently--reflecting three distinct models of high-end, cutting-edge culin-\nary work.\nI arranged my visits to coincide as much as possible with the presence of\naspirants at various points in the joining process. I spent more than a thousand\nhours on site (approximately 14 working weeks of 14- to 18-hour days) obser-\nving these groups and their incumbents in the course of their work, in the pro-\ncess of evaluating aspirants, and in their pre- and post-work social interactions.\nNearly every respondent had experience as both an aspirant and an incumbent.\nOf the 33 respondents who were aspirants during my data collection, 32 were\nworking at field sites; I was able to observe them in the negotiated joining pro-\ncess. Nineteen of them achieved a stable role at their respective sites, while\n13 abandoned the process. As often as was possible, I spoke with both aspir-\nants and incumbents to obtain both perspectives about aspirants' movements\nthrough the negotiated joining process. While on site, I took digital photographs\nand kept short-form notes in a notebook and on-site computer. I wrote nightly\nlong-form syntheses of field notes, weekly summaries, and analytic\nmemoranda at the end of each field visit (approximately as described in\nData Analysis and Reduction\nData coding and analysis occurred in tandem, in two major stages. The first\nstage was connected to data collection. My fieldwork began as a series of in-\ndepth interviews from which I developed some retrospective cases--incum-\nbents' accounts of their previous experiences as aspirants. Preliminary analysis\nof these cases revealed the unusually protracted nature of recruitment in these\ngroups. I then returned to the field over the course of four years to observe\nrecruitment processes in real time, focusing on data relating to the schemas\nand frames emerging from the analysis of interview data. These first-stage\ncodes clustered around key themes emphasizing the importance of provisional\nroles, the negotiated nature of stable roles, and the extended process of devel-\noping a role in a target group. I used this rough coding in the field as I collected\nthe observational data and conducted new interviews. While at these sites, I\ncontinued to interview new respondents and re-interview previous respon-\ndents. The cases I developed out of field observations and new interviews vali-\ndated and added nuance to the retrospective cases.\nI began the second stage of coding and analysis after completing fieldwork.\nI reviewed the cases to identify similarities in process and practice across\nthem. From this, I produced a list of codes for the sequential subprocesses\n(proposition, trial, evaluation, and integration) and associated practices\ndescribed below. My subsequent analysis of the patterning of these codes\nacross all cases revealed the sequential ordering of the subprocesses and the\niterative nature of negotiated joining as a whole process. At several points in\nboth stages of the analytic process, I asked people working in similar settings\nTable 1.

The first challenge was learning if a mutually\ndesirable role--a set of role components that the aspirant would find desirable\nto undertake and that would satisfy the target group's emerging set of needs--\nwas likely for a given aspirant\u00adtarget group combination. The second challenge\nwas constructing such a mutually desirable, stable role. Negotiated joining had\ndistinctive characteristics, subprocesses and practices, and enabling\nconditions.\nDistinctive Characteristics\nAspirants had to apply to the target groups and be selected to participate in\nnegotiated joining. But respondents said that this initial selection process by\nthe target group involved a small set of selection criteria and that selection did\nnot mean that the aspirant had been hired into a permanent job. In fact, the\nopposite was true: incumbents at every target group said that they screened\nre\n\u00b4sume\n\u00b4s of potential aspirants with ``some idea of what we're looking for'' but\nneeded to spend time working with the aspirant ``to give us an opportunity to\nfind out more about him but also so that we give him time to learn about us\nTable 2. Evidence for Distinctive Characteristics of Negotiated Joining*\nDistinctive characteristic Evidence\nInitially provisional roles ``Of course [the new member's role] is a bit floating, a bit [makes hand-waving\ngesture]--I know a little bit what I want the new person to do but stuff happens\nso fast around here that it'd be silly to try to put too much structure in at the\nstart. It's better to wait and see.'' (I-17)\nEmphasis on learning whether a\nmutually desirable eventual role\nwas likely\n``You have to figure out a job that you're happy with that [the target group] is also\nhappy with. That's the important thing about it. If you can't make it work out,\nit's probably best to just move on.'' (A-9)\nEmphasis on constructed role fit ``. . . it's not like my previous job [in software product management] where once I\ngot the job I had pre-set expectations of what I needed to deliver and my bonus\nwas pegged to that. . . . here, to get the job I have to build it. [The target group]\ndoesn't have a clear idea of what I can do for them, so I have to put that picture\ntogether and really sell it.'' (A-17)\nRole construction occurred through\niterative role negotiation\n``You don't figure it out straight away . . . it takes a while to try things out not only\nfor you but also for [the group] to see if you're good at it. And of course if it's\nuseful for them.'' (A-29)\nAbandonment of negotiated joining\nframed as learning about\npreferences\n``[A particular aspirant] left because we couldn't figure out something for him to do\nthat he found worthwhile. . . . it was clear when we were working together that\nhe was good at the [R&D] part of things but it turned out that we couldn't give\nhim enough [of that work] and he didn't really enjoy [working] service enough to\nmake it worthwhile.'' (I-12)\n* I = incumbent, A = aspirant; the number following denotes an individual respondent in this study. Thus, I-17 is\nand tell us how he thinks he'll fit in with what we do'' (I-34). They described\nselection in this setting as a precursor to ``the real work of joining the group\nand making a place for yourself'' (I-10).\nTarget groups used this first selection process to choose aspirants to enter\na consistently patterned, systematic negotiated joining process with five dis-\ntinctive characteristics: (1) aspirants' initial roles were mutually explicitly\nacknowledged to be provisional, (2) aspirants and target groups both empha-\nsized the importance of learning whether a mutually desirable eventual role\nwas likely, (3) aspirants and target groups both emphasized the importance of\nconstructed role fit, (4) mutually desirable roles were constructed through itera-\ntive rounds of role negotiation, and (5) both aspirants and target groups framed\nabandoned negotiated joining processes as valuable learning experiences\ninstead of failures. Table 2 presents evidence for these key characteristics of\nnegotiated joining.\nRoles explicitly and mutually acknowledged to be initially provisional.\nTarget groups recognized that they did not or could not know in advance the\ncomplete set of functions they needed new members to perform.\nConsequently, the aspirant's initial role was meant to be a starting point rather\nthan the intended end state. Though the aspirant's role was initially provisional,\nit was neither completely undefined nor unintentionally undefined. Many\nrespondents described how a part of their eventual role was clearly defined\nfrom the beginning. But even when there were specific expectations about an\naspirant's eventual role, part of that role was explicitly and intentionally left\nopen to change or definition. Respondents said that both the aspirant and the\ntarget group had to explicitly and intentionally acknowledge the initial role's pro-\nvisionality for negotiated joining to take place. When this was not the case,\nnegotiated joining could not proceed: ``. . . there wasn't any flex for me to do\nanything interesting . . . they knew what they wanted from me but I wasn't into\nit enough [for me] to want to stay'' (A-1, recalling previous aspirant\nexperience).\nEmphasis on learning about the likelihood of a mutually stable role. Because\nroles were open-ended, neither aspirants nor target groups knew in advance\nexactly what a new member's role would be or if it would be mutually desirable.\nRespondents said that an important aspect of negotiated joining was therefore\nto learn whether a mutually desirable role was likely: ``. . . there's no way to\nknow for sure [if or what your stable role will be]; you have to be pro-active\nand put some time into figuring out if [a particular target group] is the place for\nyou'' (I-1).\nA mutually desirable role was one the aspirant wanted to perform that was\nalso relevant and useful to the group. Aspirants highlighted the importance of\n``figuring out a job that is satisfying'' (A-6), while incumbents highlighted the\nimportance of ``making sure that [the aspirant] brings something useful to the\ntable'' (I-30). Crucially, a role had to fulfill both criteria simultaneously to be\nmutually desirable and thus stable: many respondents echoed one incumbent's\nexplanation that ``what's important . . . is getting to the point where [both the\ngroup and the aspirant] know that we've got a good thing going'' (I-22).\nEmphasis on constructed role fit in addition to simple role fit and cul-\ntural fit. Respondents said that negotiated joining helped them identify both\ncultural fit and simple fit with predefined roles: ``. . . spending time working\ntogether is essential to see if we can work together, if [the aspirant] works in\nthe same way that we do'' (I-11). But they emphasized that constructed role fit\nwas the most important part of negotiated joining. Respondents described their\nroles as modular assemblages of role components and ``figuring out a role'' as\ninvolving putting role components together to produce a mutually desirable role\n(I-2). These roles were thus tailored to both the aspirant and the target group.\nThese role components were sometimes novel to the group but could also be\nmodifications of existing role components that were then assembled into novel\nconfigurations. Negotiated joining allowed aspirants and target groups to pro-\npose and validate both novel role components and novel configurations of exist-\ning role components. Respondents said that most of the stable roles\nconstructed were novel in that each stable role was the first instance of that\nparticular configuration of role components in the target group. For example,\none incumbent, describing a colleague's role, said,\n[He's] the first sous chef we've ever had who spends so much time managing our\n[hundreds of] supplier relationships . . . he spends very little time in the [service]\nkitchen compared to the other sous [chefs]. At first [the head chef] didn't think it\nwould be worth it to spend a person on this job but he just started doing the work\nanyway and it quickly became obvious that having one person manage all of [the sup-\npliers] makes a huge difference. (I-36)\nThis role combined new and existing role components in a configuration novel\nto the group, and the role was stable because it was both personally satisfying\nto the aspirant who eventually filled it and relevant to the group's goals.\nRole construction through iterative rounds of mutual role negotiation.\nRespondents said that aspirants' roles gradually accumulated out of only vali-\ndated role components over the course of multiple rounds of negotiation. Role\nnegotiation was consistently described as a mutual process that operated\nthrough routine work interactions, with the aspirant acting to ``show [the target\ngroup] that you're good enough to perform [a particular role component]'' (I-52)\nand the target group acting to evaluate the aspirant's performance of that role\ncomponent and ``see if [the role component] is useful [to the target group]''\n(I-2). When aspirants I observed managed to construct a stable role (19 cases\nout of 32), the role only stabilized after repeated sequences of negotiation,\nmost of which resulted in a validated role component that was then incorpo-\nrated into the aspirant's stable role.\nAbandonment of negotiated joining framed as a learning experience. In\n13 of the 32 cases, the negotiated joining process was abandoned after a\nsequence of mostly unsuccessful attempts to negotiate role components--in\n12 of these 13 cases, the aspirant made the decision to abandon the process.\nEighty-three out of 88 respondents said that they had gone through negotiated\njoining at least once in their careers, and those who had been in the industry\nlonger said that they had abandoned multiple negotiated joining processes.\nAcross all respondents, however, these abandoned negotiated joining pro-\ncesses were not framed as failures. Instead, respondents reported that aban-\ndoned negotiated joining processes allowed them to learn about their skills and\ninclinations as well as the types of groups they would likely be happy in. A\nsenior incumbent with extensive industry experience said that ``you can only\nlearn about the work you want to do by trying it out. Most of the time, it's not\nquite right . . . you have to be disciplined about learning what you can from the\nsituation and moving on'' (I-16). This was also true from the target group's per-\nspective: ``. . . even after years of doing this we still don't know what kind of\nperson will work well here. . . . So you have to keep an open mind as a [group].\nBut the more people come through, the more we know about what kind of per-\nson probably won't work so well here'' (I-52).\nBoth aspirants and incumbents said that they interpreted abandonment of\nnegotiated joining as indicating either (1) poor fit with the target group's exist-\ning culture or with predefined role expectations or (2) that the aspirant and/or\nthe target group believed that no mutually desirable role could be constructed:\nI went into [a previous target group] knowing that they were trying to build an R&D\nteam but weren't sure exactly what kind of work they were trying to do. While I was\nthere, we tried [a few different approaches] but in the end the only things [that\nturned out to be viable for them] were things that I found fundamentally uninterest-\ning. (A-18, describing an earlier abandoned negotiated joining process)\nRespondents said that selection was relatively unimportant in this context\ncompared with negotiated joining. Moreover, selection could not be substituted\nfor negotiated joining because it was impossible to fully or mostly predefine a\nnew member's role:\n. . . when they hired [a new R&D head from a traditional R&D management back-\nground], he asked us all to write out detailed job descriptions to streamline opera-\ntions and become more efficient. That's when everything really began to go to shit.\nIt's very satisfying at first to have these long lists of roles and responsibilities. It defi-\nnitely feels very efficient and like you're getting something done. But does it work in\nreal life? No. There's no point being efficient and hiring for a very detailed job descrip-\ntion if the job changes every day. That's being efficient about the wrong things. (I-37)\nRespondents consistently reported that negotiated joining was an iterative\nprocess--distinct from selection--that mediated the transformation of an ini-\ntially provisional role into a stable, mutually desirable one, or the discovery that\nno stable role was likely. My analysis revealed the subprocesses, practices,\nand enabling conditions of negotiated joining.\nFor aspirants, negotiated joining was experienced at any given moment as\npotential involvement in and resolution of multiple role-component negotia-\ntions. This role negotiation consisted of and was interwoven with the daily rou-\ntines of work. Through work interactions like preparing a consomme\n\u00b4,\nbutchering a fish, jumping in during a busy service, volunteering to do inven-\ntory, and countless others, aspirants and incumbents engaged in a constant\nstream of negotiations about various role components--some concrete, some\nabstract, some major, some minor.\nNegotiated joining entailed four conceptually distinct subprocesses that\nwere consistently patterned and sequentially ordered and were associated with\nTable 3. Evidence for Practices Associated with Negotiated Joining Subprocesses\nPractice Evidence\nProposition\nProblematizing routine work ``. . . the best thing to do is to keep thinking about problems. . . . It's about training\nyourself to have that mindset of looking at everything [the target group is doing] and\nseeing past the routine. . . . that's your chance to show us that you can make our\nkitchen work better.'' (I-17)\nIntegrating aspirants into\nincumbent workflows\n``. . . it's hard not to notice if someone is really good or bad at doing something [if you're\nworking in the same room]. Like, [a particular stagiaire] is a complete mess. . . . all\nthe wrong instincts for service. . . . But he's actually really useful if there's a question\nlike, I don't know, how do I make this foam more stable? We were working on\nsomething like that the other day and he's got an instinct for that stuff.'' (I-30)\nTrial\nClearly stated trial parameters ``. . . [trials] work best when it's clear what you're testing. [As an aspirant] I figured out\nquickly to set up [the trial] so that it's obvious what I'm doing and how it's affecting\nthe result . . . if I'm going to be evaluated for something, it better be the right thing.''\nScheduling frequent and\nroutine trial opportunities\n``I feel a lot more comfortable bringing stuff for feedback [when everyone is planning to\nbe there anyway]. It helps that [the feedback session] doesn't feel like a super special\nthing where the stakes are high.'' (A-24)\nEvaluation\nUsing mutually understood\nevaluation standards\nA-30 has been asked to work on developing a sauce for a new dish. I-37 tells A-30 to\nfocus on the texture of a sauce he is developing: ``Remember that egg custard [the\npastry chef made] last week? Aim for that kind of texture.'' As A-30 worked, he could\nrapidly eliminate many development pathways from consideration because he had an\naccurate and precise idea--from a shared experience of the desired evaluation\nstandard--of the desired outcome. (Field notes from observation at a European\nrestaurant)\nLarge group evaluations The role component A-33 was trialing during service was his ability to execute many\norders accurately under time and psychological pressure. At the post-service\ndebriefing, the head chef's evaluation of A-33's performance was that it was ``a\ndisaster,'' due to his lack of ``awareness of [the progression of] service.'' During the\nlarge group debriefing, other incumbents provided information the head chef did not\nhave about mitigating circumstances beyond A-33's control--this changed the group's\nprevailing interpretation of his performance to a potentially favorable one. (Field notes\nfrom observation at a European restaurant)\nInvolving focal and non-focal\nparticipants in evaluations\n``. . . having other [non-focal] people [in the group] be part of the feedback process is\nvery useful . . . [because they can] see what kinds of questions we're asking and\nwhat the mindset and our priorities are when we're trying to refine a recipe. That's\nhard to learn except by failing and watching other people fail.'' (I-17)\nIntegration\nGradual commitment ``It's not a `you're in, you're out' situation [with this role component]. It's got to be baby\nsteps. This last batch of recipes tested out but if [the head chef] asked me to go out\nnow and do these on my own I wouldn't be confident.'' (A-29)\nHaving as many incumbents\nas possible attend\nevaluations\n``I always make people come to group feedback sessions if they are in [the restaurant]. .\n. . You can't learn if you're not present and if you don't learn, you can't change how\nyou do your job.'' (I-49)\nHaving non-focal incumbents\nparticipate in evaluations\n``. . . when you have to give feedback on someone, you can't just say `I like it' or `That\nsucks.' Gotta give reasons, you know, justifications . . . having to explain why\nsomething [the aspirant] did is good or bad, it helps convince other people in the\ngroup . . . and it makes you think harder about the feedback too.'' (I-6)\nspecific practices: (1) the proposition of role components, validation of pro-\nposed role components through (2) practical trial, followed by (3) evaluation of\ntrial results, and (4) selective integration of only validated role components into\nthe aspirant's role. The process moved through the subprocesses in sequence,\neach iteration potentially adding validated role components to the aspirant's\nrole. The iterations continued until a mutually desirable role was constructed or\nthe aspirant decided to abandon the process and leave the group. Table 3 pre-\nsents evidence for the four subprocesses and their associated practices.\nSubprocess: Proposition\nProblematizing routine work. In the initial stage of each iteration of negoti-\nated joining, either the aspirant or the target group developed and then pro-\nposed a role component that might--conditional on successful testing,\nevaluation, and integration--become part of the aspirant's eventual role.\nAspirants were motivated to develop and propose relevant role components\nout of a desire to convert an initially provisional role into a stable one, thus\nobtaining membership in a personally aspirational group. Respondents said that\na role component that was relevant to the target group was more likely to be\nvalidated and contribute to the aspirant obtaining membership: ``. . . it would be\ngreat to [work] here but it can't just be like a lame job, yeah? It has to be some-\nthing that keeps me excited but it has to work for them too'' (A-5).\nRespondents reported that aspirants who were in the habit of problematizing\nthe target group's system of routines and norms were more likely to see func-\ntional gaps in their target groups and were thus able to identify more relevant\nrole components to propose. Respondents also said that role components could\nemerge serendipitously: ``. . . [my present role] is just how we split up the work,\nand then we realized it was working quite well and . . . we kept on splitting up\nthe work the same way'' (I-34). Interactions during routine work allowed aspir-\nants and incumbents to identify and propose role components like these.\nIntegrating aspirants into incumbent workflows. At the three sites where\nincumbents and aspirants worked in close proximity (though rarely interdepen-\ndently), incumbents seemed to propose role components for aspirants more fre-\nquently than at the three sites where incumbents' and aspirants' workflows were\nnot as well-integrated. The more interaction, the more opportunities incumbents\nhad to observe aspirants working, identify potential role components, and pro-\npose them for specific aspirants: ``. . . if I see that [a particular aspirant] is rocking\nout [a particular set of tasks], I'm going to keep sending them his way'' (I-49).\nConstant interaction also encouraged aspirants to present their abilities honestly:\nrespondents said that being closely observed was ``not a situation where you can\ntry to pretend to be good at doing something because you're going to get called\non it'' (A-29). Aspirants in highly integrated workflows were thus more likely to\nact in ways that would allow incumbents to make well-informed role propositions\nfor them. The practice of integrating aspirants into incumbents' workflows thus\nappeared to support effective incumbent-driven role proposition for aspirants.\nMany role components proposed for or by aspirants were already performed\nby incumbents, but aspirants sometimes proposed role components that were\nentirely novel to the target group. For instance, I observed an aspirant (A-3) at a\nU.S. restaurant use his previous work experience to propose a role component\nas the group's first bread-and-yeast specialist. These novel role components\nsometimes had broader implications for other incumbents and the group as a\nwhole--as I discuss below in describing the integration subprocess--but the\nend result of the proposition subprocess was that a role component was pro-\nposed either for or by the aspirant. This initiated the next subprocess in negoti-\nated joining: practical testing of the proposed role component.\nSubprocess: Trial\nProposed role components were validated in action, through trial and evaluation\nof the aspirant's performance of the role component in the context of group\nwork and group goals. Trials of role components took many forms but nearly\nalways looked ``just like regular work'' (I-14). Any work interaction could func-\ntion as a trial if it simultaneously provided an opportunity to evaluate an aspir-\nant's performance of a role component and the aspirant and target group\nincumbents treated it as a trial to be evaluated. Trials were either implicit or\nexplicit: a junior and a senior chef working on a fish soup recipe deciding to\ncompare their preferred methods of clarifying fish stock to see which one\nworked better (an implicit trial observed at a European restaurant), or a junior\nchef demonstrating to more senior colleagues what he asserted was a more\nefficient method of filling a large number of micro-pipettes with aromatized oil\n(an explicit trial observed at a U.S. restaurant group). In both cases, the interac-\ntion served both the task at hand (clarifying stock or filling pipettes) and evalua-\ntion of a proposed role component.\nPractical trials of role components allowed the aspirant and the target\ngroup to learn about the performance of a proposed role component through\nconcrete experience instead of mere assertion. Consequently, target groups\ncould and did use them to evaluate an aspirant's fit with a predefined role.\nBut trials performed more than just this selection-oriented function: they were\nalso used by the target group as a source of information about those aspirants'\nsuitability for novel role components or novel configurations of role\ncomponents.\nClearly stated trial parameters. Trials were rife with misunderstandings.\nAspirants and target group incumbents didn't always share the same assump-\ntions about when a work interaction was a trial and when it was not.\nRespondents often mentioned aspirants who ``weren't treating [the work] as a\nchance to prove that they're capable'' (I-5) and viewed these as ``wasted oppor-\ntunities'' on the part of the aspirants concerned (A-4). Also, aspirants and\nincumbents did not always have the same understanding about the nature of\nthe role component being tested: ``I always try to be clear about what the point\n[of the trial] is but sometimes it just doesn't get across [to the aspirant]'' (I-9,\ncommenting on a just-completed trial). Aspirants and incumbents both said that\nmaking the effort to clearly state trial parameters reduced the occurrence of\nboth types of misunderstandings.\nScheduling frequent and routine trial opportunities. Frequent, routinely\nscheduled trial opportunities seemed to reduce aspirants' perceived and actual\nbarriers to committing to a trial of a role component--this practice seemed to\nincrease the total number of trials each aspirant undertook and accelerate the\ntrial subprocess. Five of the nine sites had weekly recurring meetings during\nwhich all aspirants and incumbents would meet regardless of whether any\ntrials had been prearranged, and any aspirant or incumbent could bring work\n(such as a prototype of a recipe under development) to these meetings for\nfeedback from other attendees. An aspirant in one of these groups said that\n``the bar for showing something [for feedback] seems low. Everyone's going\nto come [to the session] anyway and lots of other people are showing stuff\ntoo . . . there's not much pressure'' (A-1). In contrast, aspirants at the other\nfour sites had to organize trials ad hoc. Respondents at these latter sites said\nthat the logistical challenges of scheduling a trial and ``getting [all the incum-\nbents together] to give feedback [on a trial] is a massive pain in the ass'' (A-30).\nThey were consequently more reluctant to propose and test role components\nand seemed to do so less frequently.\nSubprocess: Evaluation\nEvaluation was conceptually distinct from trial even though the two subpro-\ncesses could (and often did) occur at the same time: evaluation entailed target\ngroup incumbents interpreting a trial's outcome and assigning meaning and\nvalue to it. This interpretive process required incumbents to come to an agree-\nment about the aspirant's competence at the role component.\nUsing mutually understood evaluation standards. Evaluation was\nstraightforward when aspirants and incumbents both shared the same under-\nstanding of the standards by which the trial performance would be evaluated,\nfor instance, when an aspirant and an incumbent agreed to use a liqueur they\nhad both sampled together previously as the standard for the acid\u00adsugar bal-\nance of a new sauce on which the aspirant would be working (observed at a\nU.S. restaurant). Using mutually understood standards for evaluating trial per-\nformance seemed to significantly enhance an aspirant's ability to iterate rapidly\ntoward a desired output for any given trial and thus to improve a trial's accuracy\nin testing a particular role component. Nonetheless, this practice was the\nexception rather than the rule--I observed it frequently at only one of the nine\nfield sites.\nRole components with more abstract standards for performance required\nmore interpretive work. An aspirant said that ``it's not like . . . seeing if some-\none can break down [into usable pieces] a side of beef. I couldn't tell you what\nit means to have an R&D mindset like what [the senior incumbent in the group]\nsays we all need to have. I don't think he could tell you either. It all depends on\nwhat the specific problem is that we're trying to solve. So it's also hard to\nshow [the incumbents] that you have what it takes to do the job'' (A-9). The\nrelated practices of holding large group evaluations and debriefings and of\ninvolving both focal and non-focal participants in trial evaluations were espe-\ncially useful for trials of abstract role components.\nLarge group evaluations. Evaluating more abstract role components\nrequired incumbents to accumulate multiple pieces of confirming or\ndisconfirming evidence of competence: ``you can't tell about these things from\njust a few [trials]. It takes time . . . you have to see if they always perform the\nsame way in similar situations'' (incumbent, chef at a U.S. restaurant).\nIncumbents also had to deliberate interactively and collectively assign meaning\nand value to trial outcomes for more abstract role components. For instance, all\nthe senior incumbents with R&D responsibilities at a particular target group\ndebated at length a particular aspirant's ability to ``develop new recipes in the\nspirit [of the group]''; these debates took place through a series of discussions,\neach associated with one of a series of dishes the aspirant developed and pre-\nsented for tasting and feedback over the course of a few weeks (observed in a\nEuropean restaurant). Collective deliberation allowed incumbents to obtain and\nsynthesize disparate perspectives and pieces of information on the aspirant's\nperformance.\nInvolving focal and non-focal participants. Evaluations usually took the\nform of discussions of events that had taken place during service or feedback\nsessions on particular dishes, and they involved up to four possible types of\nparticipants: focal incumbents (who were primarily responsible for giving eva-\nluations), focal aspirants (whose work was being evaluated), and non-focal\nincumbents and aspirants (who were peripheral to the particular trial being\nevaluated). Evaluation sessions consisted, at a minimum, of focal aspirants\nand focal incumbents. But sessions that also involved non-focal incumbents\n(three of the four types of participants) allowed information from more\nincumbents' perspectives to be incorporated into the evaluation. This\nseemed to permit more complete evaluations of the focal aspirant's perfor-\nmance. Group evaluations that also included non-focal aspirants (i.e., all four\npossible types of participants) were even more useful: respondents said that\nparticipating in these sessions allowed non-focal aspirants to better under-\nstand the target group's work practices and approach, which improved their\nability to propose mutually desirable role components for themselves. These\nlatter two practices also supported the integration of newly validated role\ncomponents.\nSubprocess: Integration\nIntegration of a validated role component occurred at three levels: that of the\naspirant, the incumbent, and the group as a whole. Integration of an aspirant's\nrole component sometimes resulted in unintended but profound changes to\nthe target group's goals and role structure.\nAspirant-level integration: Working out parameters of a role\ncomponent. Respondents said that even after role components were vali-\ndated by evaluation, it ``could take a while'' (I-10) for aspirants to learn the para-\nmeters of a particular role component--the range of situations in which an\naspirant was expected to perform that role component. This was particularly\ntrue for more abstract role components.\nGradual commitment. Aspirants integrated these abstract role components\nvoluntarily, initiating additional trials of the role component in situations of\nincreasingly significant consequence; in other words, additional iterations of\nnegotiated joining for the same role component. Aspirants described these\nadditional trials in similar ways: ``baby steps'' (A-29), ``keeping the training\nwheels on for now'' (A-14), and ``easing in'' (A-3). One aspirant said,\nI have to come up with dishes that channel [this restaurant's] ethos but are creative\nand new at the same time. It would be dumb to imagine that having [the head chef]\nbe excited about the three or four dishes I've come up with [in the last few weeks]\nmeans I'm now ready to fly solo. . . . I'm going to keep doing more small projects. I\nhave to slowly get a feel for [this group] . . . and they have to get used to my particu-\nlar sensibility in food. (A-29)\nThis gradual commitment gave the aspirant and target group more opportuni-\nties to test a role component under different circumstances--this generated\nmore reliable information for the target group about the aspirant's competence\nand more information for the aspirant about the circumstances under which\nthat role component might be applicable.\nIncumbent-level integration: Modifications to incumbents' roles. Incumbents'\nroles almost always changed when a role component was allocated to an aspir-\nant. Respondents consistently said, and I observed, that they took it for granted\nthat incumbents' roles were only relatively stable and might change at short\nnotice due to an aspirant's role negotiations. They took considerable pride in\nhow their roles were constantly in flux and how, as one incumbent put it, ``you\nhave to stay on your toes in this business'' (I-33).\nWhen an aspirant was allocated a role component already performed by\nincumbents, those incumbents either relinquished that role component or\nshared responsibility for it with the aspirant. The evidence of competence pro-\nduced by the proposition\u00adtrial\u00adevaluation sequence was crucial to this integra-\ntion and adjustment. Incumbents said that such responsibility transfers were\nusually non-contentious because the aspirant's competence was demonstrated\nthrough practical trial: ``the nice thing is that we can all see if [the aspirant] is\nbetter than we are at something or not. [Having gone through a series of trials\nand evaluations, we know] she's got the chops to take on [a role component I\ncurrently claim]. I respect that'' (I-6).\nHaving as many incumbents as possible--including non-focal incumbents--\nattend evaluations. Respondents said that having as many incumbents as pos-\nsible attend trial evaluations promoted integration by quickly spreading person-\nally verified knowledge about aspirants' competence at specific role\ncomponents among incumbents. Respondents also said that the practice dis-\ncussed earlier of non-focal incumbents participating in trial evaluations sup-\nported integration because it forced incumbents to justify their interpretations\nof an aspirant's trial performance both to themselves and others, producing\ngreater consensus in evaluation among incumbents. These two practices also\nsupported adjustments by incumbents when the allocated role component was\nnew to the group. For instance, an aspirant who demonstrated a more effective\nand reliable way to modify the surface texture of cooked vegetables immedi-\nately prompted several members of the group to change the sets of tasks they\nroutinely performed to prepare ingredients for each day's service because\nsome of those tasks had been rendered obsolete by the aspirant's new tech-\nnique (observed at a restaurant in Europe).\nAspirants with industry experience were often said to bring in role compo-\nnents representing incremental process or conceptual innovations that stimu-\nlated adjustment within the group. But respondents distinguished these\nincremental innovations from the much-rarer disruptive innovations ``from way\nout in left field . . . [that] profoundly, fundamentally changed how we worked''\n(I-49). Role components representing non-incremental innovations, respon-\ndents said, were more likely to come from aspirants who had work experience\noutside the culinary field (i.e., who were less experienced in terms of culinary\nskill but not necessarily always younger).\nGroup-level integration: Adaptation and change. For disruptive role com-\nponents, respondents said that integration and adjustment occurred not just\namong aspirants and incumbents but for the group as a whole. This unintended\nbut widely recognized side effect of negotiated joining was generated by aspir-\nants when they managed either implicitly or explicitly to persuade incumbents\nthat the group's existing system of goals and roles was suboptimal for the\nexternal environment and that the integration of the aspirant's disruptive role\ncomponent (with attendant adjustments to incumbents' roles and group goals)\nwould be a change for the better. One incumbent echoed a majority of respon-\ndents when he told me that ``[aspirants] sometimes come up with things that\nwe would never have thought of ourselves that somehow are just right for\nwhat we like . . . sometimes, spending time with these new people who might\njoin our team, it helps us to understand that they can bring us where we don't\neven know we want to go yet'' (I-52).\nIncumbents framed these disruptive role components as new resources that\ncould be combined with existing group resources in ways that had been previ-\nously inconceivable. It was a rare aspirant who brought in this type of role com-\nponent that let the group ``solve a problem that we didn't know was good to\nsolve before'' (I-52), but nearly every senior incumbent could recall at least one\ninstance of such a major change. For instance, an incumbent at a U.S. R&D lab\nreported that an aspirant's set of newly assigned role components triggered ``a\nnew way of thinking that changed the way we thought about what we do as a\ngroup. Suddenly, we had [someone on the team who was a Ph.D.-trained phy-\nsicist and chemist] and we could imagine working on things that needed that\nspecialized knowledge'' (I-2).\nBecause novel role components introduced by aspirants could fundamentally\nchange group goals, respondents said that integration in these situations could\nbe radical and affect many or even all incumbents in the group: ``[Having a new\nperson on the team like this] forces you to re-think your job. . . . [A current\naspirant], for instance, is doing some biz dev for us. If he comes on board, we'll\nbe all about partnering to develop new products or starting a restaurant, but we\nwere researchers before that so now we're wondering how we can still be rel-\nevant, what our new jobs should be'' (I-15). This adaptation was possible only\nbecause of the incumbent-centric adjustment and integration process and the\nassumption that a new member's entry would likely trigger reconfiguration of\nincumbents' roles.\nNegotiated joining consisted of proposition, trial, evaluation, and integration--\nfour separate subprocesses associated with specific practices that, in\nsequence, allowed aspirants and target groups to mutually propose and vali-\ndate role components, allocate them to aspirants, and integrate them into the\nexisting role structure of the target groups.\nFigure 1.

The first occurred after evalua-\ntion, when the aspirant and the target group had to decide if the role compo-\nnent (and the aspirant's performance of it) was mutually acceptable. The\nsecond occurred after integration, when again both had to decide if the aspir-\nant's role had become stable and mutually satisfactory with the addition of the\nnew role component. If the aspirant's role had not yet stabilized, both aspirant\nand target group had to make a third decision: whether the aspirant would\nremain in negotiated joining and initiate another iteration or abandon the pro-\ncess. Figure 1 illustrates the entire iterative negotiated joining process and\nshows the relationship between the subprocesses and the decision points in\nnegotiated joining.\nSelectively retaining only validated role components resulted in roles that\nwere stable because they comprised role components that both the aspirant\nand the target group wanted the aspirant to perform: good role fit due not only\nto accurate selection by the target group (simple role fit) but also to a mutual\nprocess of role negotiation and role construction (constructed role fit). The\nundefined part of the aspirant's role gained definition and stabilized as it ``filled\nup'' with validated role components. Yet even these roles were considered sta-\nble only in relation to aspirants' initially provisional roles: incumbents said that it\nwas normal for them to adjust their roles to integrate aspirants' newly validated\nroles, and I observed this continual adjustment among incumbents at every\nfield site.\nEnabling Conditions\nNegotiated joining was universally said to be costly in time and effort for both\naspirants and target groups. It was also potentially fraught: aspirants and\nincumbents had to work together for extended periods to construct aspirants'\nroles and adjust incumbents' roles, which should have resulted in turf battles\nbetween incumbents and aspirants. But respondents' accounts and my obser-\nvations suggested that negotiated joining was used at all sites for all aspirants\ndespite its high cost and was regarded as unexceptional both at my field sites\nand in the industry as a whole. Moreover, extended role negotiation provoked\nfew serious interpersonal or role-related conflicts. Though respondents all\nregarded negotiated joining as unsurprising, it seems reasonable to wonder\nwhat motivated aspirants and target groups to go through such an uncertain,\ntime- and effort-intensive job search process, and how groups using negotiated\njoining managed to avoid collapsing under the burden of role-related conflict.\nThree conditions seemed to enable negotiated joining in this setting: (1) expli-\ncitly provisional initial roles, (2) framing outcomes as personal choices, and\n(3) prevailing norms and expectations.\nExplicitly and mutually acknowledging the provisionality of initial\nroles. Role conflict can arise when an aspirant's expectations about his or her\nrole are violated or when an incumbent's expectations about an aspirant's role\nare violated. The explicit provisionality of the aspirant's role minimized these\nexpectations and seemed to remove this major potential source of conflict. A\nsenior incumbent said that ``people don't get in a pissing contest about [the\nroles they perform] when they don't really know what they're supposed to be\ndoing yet'' (I-50). Provisionality also motivated the aspirant--respondents said\nthat the possibility of a stable eventual role combined with the explicitly provi-\nsional nature of the initial role prompted aspirants to invest time and effort in\nnegotiated joining processes.\nFraming negotiated joining outcomes as personal choice. Respondents\nsaid that those who chose high-end culinary work generally had greater ambi-\ntion and more advanced skills, giving them multiple employment options: ``any\none of the stagiaires we have working for free tonight could go off and run a\nkitchen at some two-bit club and make way more [money]. But they're doing\nthis because they want something more, right?'' (I-38). Respondents consis-\ntently said that their top priority was ``doing work worth doing in a restaurant\nworth working in'' (A-27) and that ``once you get used to [working with people\nof this quality] you can't go back'' (I-39). Consequently, they only described\nthemselves as having significant attachment to roles that they had validated as\nbeing mutually desirable and were frequently ``willing to walk away if it's not\nthe right place'' (I-43). Respondents treated the considerable time and effort\nthey spent on negotiated joining at various target groups as a worthwhile\ninvestment in eventually creating the right role for themselves there or else-\nwhere. This framing converted what might have been a point of interpersonal\nconflict--invalidation of a previously desired role or role component-- into a\nless-conflictual personal choice.\nProfessional norms and expectations. Probably the main enabling condi-\ntion in this setting is that high-end, cutting-edge culinary groups and workers\nare part of a community of practice in which the norm is for aspirants' roles to\nbe provisional and in which recruitment is almost universally managed through\nnegotiation-dominant joining processes. My respondents thus used negotiated\njoining by convention, not by choice, generating the two enabling conditions\nexplained above. Incumbents and aspirants both said that investing time and\neffort in negotiated joining was not seen as a deliberate decision but simply\n``how things are done in [this industry]'' (I-22).\nDISCUSSION\nPrevious studies take selection into predefined roles as the default model for\nsystematically acquiring new members, consequently regarding incompletely\npredefined roles and other apparent departures from selection as idiosyncratic\nexternal uncertainty; their new members' roles were necessarily open-ended,\nand these groups therefore could not and did not depend solely on selection\nprocesses to acquire new members. But the unsystematic, irrational, individua-\nlistic opportunistic hiring by managers predicted by previous theory did not\nensue. On the contrary, these groups managed the acquisition of new mem-\nbers systematically using an iterative process new to the literature: negotiated\njoining.\nThe characteristics of negotiated joining described earlier reveal that it is dis-\ntinct from selection as currently theorized. Table 4 summarizes these differ-\nences. Nonetheless, negotiated joining was systematic, consistently patterned,\nand allowed groups to achieve constructed role fit for new members with\nopen-ended roles. While the pattern of practices associated with negotiated\njoining in elite culinary groups reported here is setting-specific and unlikely to\ngeneralize, the underlying negotiated joining process has broader applicability\nfor managing membership in elite groups.\nGeneralizability\nNegotiated joining's distinctive characteristics and enabling conditions suggest\nthat it is more likely to be observed where target groups and aspirants recog-\nnize that roles must be emergent and open-ended. This is the case for groups\nthat experience external uncertainty, which makes members' roles difficult to\npredefine. Additionally, aspirants and target groups must be willing and able to\nallocate large amounts of time and effort to role negotiation. Large payoffs from\ngroup membership allow groups to have surplus resources to spend on negoti-\nated joining and also incentivize aspirants to attempt to join these groups.\nSimilarly, high-quality aspirants who are in short supply are more likely to be\nable to invest time and effort in negotiated joining, and groups are more likely\nto be incentivized to invest resources in constructing roles around them.\nThese three conditions--necessarily open-ended roles, large payouts from\ngroup membership, and high-quality aspirants in short supply--characterize\nelite groups that must be staffed from elite-aspirant pools and that face uncer-\ntain future demands. Groups in this category include prestigious academic\nfaculties seeking high-quality scholars for tenure, professional service firms\nseeking new equity partners, and top management teams in new or rapidly\nchanging industries seeking new senior management. The process theory\ndeveloped here suggests that these elite internal groups are likely to acquire\nnew members from their aspirant pools using negotiation-dominant processes\nmarked by initially provisional roles and iterative role-negotiation through propo-\nsition, trial, evaluation, and integration.\nBy the same reasoning, negotiated joining is too costly and uncertain to be\nthe primary mode of new-member acquisition in all contexts. Groups with pre-\ndefinable roles operating in relatively stable environments, with minimal\nTable 4.

Selection-dominant pro-\ncesses are both more appropriate and more likely to be observed in such\nsettings.\nContributions\nMembership dynamics in elite groups. Current research in this area\nfocuses on group, individual, and role characteristics that predict membership\nthat this research agenda should be expanded to also examine the processes\nand dynamics that lead to membership in internal elite groups. The example of\nmanagement consulting firms is illustrative. While these consulting firms are\nusually considered elite organizations in their own right (Rivera, 2014), equity\npartnership groups within these firms represent an even more exclusive type\nof group. Equity partners have relatively stable roles and domains of expertise;\nby contrast, pre-partnership employees have provisional roles (they are\nemployed understanding that they either move ``up or out'') and should be con-\nsidered potential aspirants to partnership. Negotiated joining helps make sense\nof the pre-partnership trajectory, in which an aspirant must develop a ``plat-\nform'' for election to partnership: domain expertise comprising a unique config-\nuration of role components and individual client relationships that takes\nadvantage of the aspirant's skills and inclinations and is relevant to the firm's\nneeds. These role components are validated through multiple client engage-\nments and interactions with partners and other colleagues over the course of\nmany years. Attrition rates are high, and examining these setting-specific nego-\ntiated joining practices may better explain who becomes a partner at these\nfirms and why.\nAdditionally, my findings suggest that the more dominant negotiated joining\nis in these elite groups' membership processes, the more likely that initial roles\nin these groups will be provisional and stable roles will be customized to fit a\ncombination of group needs and individual inclinations. Negotiated-joining the-\nory predicts a performance benefit for target groups that offer aspirants more\nopportunities to mutually construct their roles, because these groups will be\nmore likely to acquire new members who perform well.\nScope conditions for beneficial role ambiguity. Negotiated joining also\nupdates previous research that uniformly construes role ambiguity as being\nunpleasant for the focal individual, detrimental for group performance, and gen-\nerally undesirable (Rizzo, House, and Lirtzman, 1970; Ilgen and Hollenbeck,\ninitial roles were ambiguous because aspirants and target groups mutually and\nexplicitly agreed on their provisionality. This provisionality allowed roles to be\nconstructed that were desirable to both the aspirant and the target group and\nsometimes allowed aspirants to import novel, disruptive role components into\ntheir target groups. As described earlier, these disruptive role components\nchanged group goals and role structures, and respondents reported that these\ninternal changes allowed groups to adapt to changing demands from the exter-\nnal environment. Explicitly ambiguous roles, such as provisional roles, could\ngenerate good role fit through construction as well as promote group adapta-\ntion to external uncertainty. The present study suggests a scope condition for\nrole ambiguity by showing that symmetrically explicit role ambiguity can be\nbeneficial for both individuals and groups.\nA Contingency Theory of New-member Acquisition\nNegotiated joining has implications beyond extending our understanding of the\nmembership dynamics of elite groups and the potential benefits of role ambigu-\nity. The dominance of selection in previous research has led to the generally\nunquestioned assumption that systematic new-member acquisition is a norma-\ntively and descriptively non-contingent process. The existence of negotiated\njoining as a viable alternative to selection calls this assumption into question\nand demonstrates the utility of a contingency theory of new-member acquisi-\ntion. While previous theory has called for incorporating environmental assess-\nment into the process of strategic job analysis as a precursor to applying\nselection methods (Singh, 2008), I argue that the method of new-member\nacquisition itself should be contingent on the nature of the environment.\nContingency theories focus on the fit between organizational characteristics\nand organizational environments and use degree of fit to explain organizational\nperformance (Van de Ven, Ganco, and Hinings, 2013). In this case, fit is\nbetween how an organization acquires new members and the degree of prede-\nfinability of new members' roles, while performance is the organization's con-\ntinued ability to survive and flourish by adapting to the demands of the\nenvironment.\nIn stable environments, actions map consistently to outcomes; organizations\ncan therefore learn from experience and optimize their processes and struc-\ntures (Sorenson, 2003) by developing consistent roles and routines (Levitt and\nMarch, 1988). In contrast, action\u00adoutcome mappings change unpredictably in\nunstable, uncertain environments; roles in organizations operating in such envir-\nonments are necessarily emergent and open-ended. Under these latter condi-\ntions, a rigid structure of roles and routines is suboptimal (Burns and Stalker,\n1961). Instead, organizations and their members must have adaptability--the\ndynamic capability to detect external change and change internally in response\nMassini, and Peeters, 2011)--to survive and flourish in uncertain environments\nNegotiated joining both accommodates open-ended roles and can promote\nadaptability by stimulating ongoing adjustments to group structure and goals,\nwhich is an unintended side effect of integrating newly validated role compo-\nnents. Negotiated joining therefore enables organizing through emergent rela-\ntionships within groups (Stewart and Carson, 1997) and serves as a previously\nunidentified mechanism for increasing absorptive capacity (Zahra and George,\nfor target groups to adapt by absorbing novel skills and information that aspir-\nants bring in from the external environment.\nWhereas previous research has assumed and prescribed that selection is\nthe sole and normatively preferable method for acquiring new members, this\nstudy introduced external uncertainty and the resulting difficulty in predefining\nnew members' roles as a condition that affects an organization's choice of\nnew-member-acquisition processes. Negotiated joining and selection are not\nmutually exclusive, and my findings show that selection and negotiated joining\ncan be used in combination: no group I observed relied exclusively on negoti-\nated joining, and every group relied primarily on negotiated joining supplemen-\nted with conventional selection processes such as re\n\u00b4sume\n\u00b4 reviews and\ninterviews. Consequently, in a contingency theory of new-member acquisition,\nthe appropriate balance between selection and negotiated joining depends on\nthe level of uncertainty in the external environment: more uncertain environ-\nments require less-predefined, more open-ended roles and call for more\nnegotiation-dominant membership management processes.\nLimitations and Future Research\nThis paper set out to document the understudied phenomenon of negotiated\njoining in the setting of elite cutting-edge culinary work. To do so, I examined\nestablished groups in this setting and focused on finding similarities across\ncases. It is therefore beyond this paper's scope to explain variations in process\noutcomes across groups or individuals. To extend our understanding of how\nnegotiated joining works, future research should explore the phenomenon in\nother settings and pose questions that this study did not address.\nElite cutting-edge culinary groups were an ideal research setting in which\nthe general process mechanism of negotiated joining was clearly observable.\nBut because negotiated joining happens in the course of routine work interac-\ntions, the specific practices that support negotiated joining are likely to vary\nconsiderably across settings. For example, a venture capital firm seeking a new\ngeneral partner is likely to use very different negotiated joining practices than\nan academic department seeking a new tenured faculty member. Future\nresearch could document negotiated joining practices in different work and pro-\nfessional settings to explore areas of similarity and difference. The contingency\nmodel of new-member acquisition developed above indicates that these efforts\nshould focus especially on settings marked by high uncertainty.\nThe type and amount of data I collected--interviews and short-duration\nobservations--prevented me from examining how and to what extent negoti-\nated joining affected individual and group outcomes beyond what respondents\nreported. Respondents said that negotiated joining produced roles that were\nmutually desirable, implying greater job satisfaction and longer tenure. They\nalso said that negotiated joining could stimulate group adaptability, implying\ngreater group longevity. Future research should explicitly test these proposi-\ntions. One possible study could compare groups using negotiation-dominant\nmember acquisition processes with groups using selection-dominant pro-\ncesses to see if there are systematic differences in group longevity and in\nmembers' tenure and satisfaction. Another study could investigate individual\nand group outcomes associated with negotiated joining using longer-term\nobservations of groups and aspirants. Also, recent research on new ventures in\nan uncertain environment shows that new firms with more formal structures\n(and thus more clearly predefined roles) outperform those with less formal\nstructures (Sine, Mitsuhashi, and Kirsch, 2006)--a third study could examine if\nand how the effects of negotiated joining vary across organizations at different\nstages of development.\nFinally, I focused on negotiated joining as a membership process used by\ntarget groups, but my respondents were worthy of study as well: they were\nuniformly willing to accept provisional roles and the high likelihood of not con-\nstructing stable roles for themselves. Respondents indicated that unsuitable\nindividuals would self-select out, which could suggest systematic differences\nbetween individuals who are effective participants in negotiated joining and\nthose who are not. Personality is probably part of the explanation: individuals\noriented toward uncertainty and open to new experiences (Hodson and\nSorrentino, 1999) will be more likely to embrace the uncertainty in negotiated\njoining, and those who are relatively high in conscientiousness and emotional\nwill be more likely to handle the interactions involved in negotiated joining\ngracefully. The aspirants in this study were drawn from elite pools of individuals\nwith high ability and flexibility, consistent with previous theorizing that organiz-\ning around emergent relationships would be associated with individuals who\nhad greater general mental ability (Stewart and Carson, 1997). A research pro-\ngram could thus focus on the individual level to identify personality and other\ncharacteristics that make individuals more or less likely to be predisposed to\nparticipate in negotiated joining rather than looking for predefined roles they\ncan fill.\n"
