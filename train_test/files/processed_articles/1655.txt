Several research reports indicate that\nfood-insecure individuals are at higher risk of overweight\nand obesity (OWOB) and obesity-related health pro-\nblems(3,4). Intermediate levels of FI are associated with\nhigher BMI in women(5\u00ad7) and in some cases men(5,8).\nThese associations have been observed to vary by the level\nand severity of FI(9). The mechanisms responsible for the\npositive association between FI and BMI in women have\nnot been established but several plausible explanations\nhave been offered, including socio-economic deprivation,\nadaptive coping behaviour and lack of access to resour-\nces(7,10\u00ad12). However, these are characteristics indicative of\nlow socio-economic status, which is associated with shorter\nTo our knowledge, nutritional indicators that reflect\nearlier life experiences, such as HT, have not been\ndocumented among food-insecure adults living in the\nUSA. Short HT arising from inadequate nutrition has been\nobserved in developing countries for several dec-\nades(14,16). Long-term nutritional deficiencies among vul-\nnerable populations such as the food-insecure engender\nHT deficits in adults(13,16). Inadequate nutrition can result\nin inadequate intakes of nutrients essential for linear\ngrowth, including iodine, Zn, Ca, vitamin A, protein and\nenergy, one consequence of which is HT deficits in\nadults(16,17). Studies show that people who experience\nundernutrition at a young age recover in weight but not\nBioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is one method\nused for the assessment of percentage body fat\n(%BF)(20\u00ad22). Whereas researchers have examined the\nassociations between FI and OWOB using BMI, to our\nknowledge none have examined the associations using\n%BF derived from BIA. If a positive association exists\nbetween FI and BMI among women, a positive associa-\ntion between FI and %BF in women would be expected.\nThe purpose of the present study was to examine the\nassociations between FI and %BF and BMI, and whether\nthese associations vary by HT.\nMethods\nStudy sample and data sources\nCross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutri-\nfor the present study.

Stratified, multistage probability\ncluster sampling methods were used in the NHANES. It is\nan ongoing survey that covers the non-institutionalized\nUS civilian population.\nBecause prior researchers have reported associations\nbetween FI and OWOB in adults, those 18\u00ad50 years of\nage were selected for the present analysis. In addition,\nthis age range was selected because body composition\nand HT vary markedly in younger and older persons(23,24)\nand the use of BMI to assess adiposity in older adults has\nFrom the baseline sample of 4048 who had complete\n1909 women were included after meeting various inclusion\ncriteria, i.e. has complete data on age, body weight, food\nsecurity status, gender and HT, and not having extremely\nlow or extremely high %BF. Twenty-two subjects, com-\nprising 0?54 % of the baseline sample, did not satisfy the\ninclusion criteria and thus were excluded from analysis. Of\nthe twenty-two subjects who did not meet the inclusion\ncriteria, two subjects had missing data for body weight. Six\nand fourteen had extremely low and high %BF respec-\ntively, were clear outliers and thus were excluded from the\nstudy. The NCHS Ethics Review Board approved the survey\nprotocols and informed consent was obtained from all\nsubjects. The procedures for the present study were\napproved locally by the Institutional Review Board, Office\nof Human Subjects Research, Auburn University, Alabama.\nFood security measure\naffirmative answers to a subset of ten items pertaining\nto adults from the core eighteen-item US food security\nsurvey module, subjects were assigned to one of four\nfood security levels: (i) fully food-secure; (ii) marginal\nfood security (affirmative answers to one or two of the\nquestions about food security, suggesting a risk for FI);\n(iii) food-insecure without hunger (reported uncertainty\nabout food supply, a need to adapt food management\nstrategies or indicative of a decrease in diet quality); or\n(iv) food-insecure with hunger (both quality and quantity\nof food decreased to the extent that there was repeated\nexperience of the physical sensations of hunger)(2,8).\nFood security questions asked during the survey referred\nto food-related circumstances in the past 12 months prior\nto administration of the food security questionnaire(2).\nBody fat and height assessment\nA bioimpedance spectrum analyser (HYDRA ECF/ICF\n4200; Xitron Technologies, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was\nused for BIA, which involved tetrapolar measurement\nof whole-body electrical resistance. In the NHANES\nhealth technicians in the mobile examination centres\n(MEC)(27). In the present study, BIA values at 50 kHz\nelectrical current were used to estimate fat-free body\nmass (FFM) by utilizing a prediction equation for adult\nmen and women which has been validated against dual-\nenergy X-ray absorptiometry(22). Utilizing this equa-\ntion(22), fat-free mass was estimated as:\nwhere H2/R is HT squared divided by resistance (cm2/V).\nFrom the estimated FFM, the %BF was calculated as\n%BF \u00bc \u00bd\u00f0body weight \u00c0 FFM\u00deCbody weight \u00c2 100:\n%BF values were calculated separately for men and\nwomen.

Further details\non HT and other anthropometric measurements are\navailable elsewhere(29).\nStatistical analysis and covariates\nTo correct for MEC sampling design and to apply MEC\nsampling weights(30), the STATA statistical software\npackage version 10?0 (StataCorp., College Station, TX,\nUSA) was used to estimate all descriptive and inferential\nstatistics. Due to reported differences in the association\nbetween FI and body weight status between men and\nwomen, all analyses were stratified by gender(5,10).\nFor categorical data, Pearson's x2 test of independence\nwith Rao and Scott correction was used, whereas for\ncontinuous variables, the overall F test was used to test\nfor significant bivariate associations across levels of food\nMultiple linear regression models were used to examine\nthe associations between FI and %BF, BMI and HT.

Due to small sample sizes, race/ethnicity was\ncollapsed into three categories: Black non-Hispanic;\nMexican-American and other Hispanics; and White\nrespondents who reported they currently smoked at least\n100 cigarettes, a pipe twenty times and a cigar twenty\ntimes in their lifetime were classified as current smokers.\nOthers who reported previous smoking were classified as\nex-smokers. Those who reported never smoking to all\nwere classified as never smokers.\nIn testing for associations between the main exposure\nvariable (food security status) and the outcome variables\n(%BF, BMI and HT), the fully food-secure category was\nthe referent group and did not include the marginal food\nsecurity category. The significance of the independent\nassociation of FI was assessed by means of a t test on the\nb coefficients. In all statistical tests, significant differences\nResults\nSample characteristics\nBackground characteristics of the subjects are presented\nmen and 48 % were women. Subjects who were fully\nfood-secure made up 82?01 % of this sample. The mean\nistics of the subjects across the four levels of food security\nare shown in Table 1.\nPercentage body fat, BMI and height\nThere was significant interaction between food security\nstatus and HT in the association between FI and BMI as\nindicated by the adjusted Wald test, P , 0?038. This result\nindicates that the trends in the association between FI and\nBMI were different at different levels of HT.\nTable 2 shows the %BF of men and women by food\nsecurity status. Men who were food-insecure without\nhunger or with hunger had significantly lower %BF than\nmen who were fully food-secure. This pattern did not\nchange after HT stratification in men (Table 3). Compared\nwith fully food-secure women, FI was not significantly\nassociated with %BF among women, not even after HT\nstratification (Table 3).\nMen who were food-insecure without hunger or with\nhunger had significantly lower BMI than men who were\nfully food-secure (Table 2), irrespective of HT (Table 3).\nDifferent patterns of association were observed among\nwomen. Before HT stratification, there was only a mar-\nginally significant positive association between FI and\nBMI (Table 2) among women. However, after HT strati-\nfication, women who were marginally food-secure and\nwere below median HT had an approximately 2 kg/m2\nhigher BMI compared with their fully food-secure\nfully food-secure counterparts, no significant differences\nin BMI were observed among women who were of\nmedian HT or taller.\nMen who experienced FI without and with hunger had\nsignificantly shorter HT by about 2 cm compared with\nfully food-secure men. Among women, marginal food\nsecurity was associated with approximately 1?3 cm shorter\nHT, P5 0?016. Although insignificant, there was a tendency\nfor women in the other food-insecure categories to be\nshorter than their fully food-secure counterparts.\nDiscussion\nA significant finding in the present study is that women\nwho were marginally food-secure and were below\nmedian HT had significantly higher BMI, but women\nwho were of median HT or taller did not. Although not\nstatistically significant, BMI showed a tendency towards\nhigher values among food-insecure women who were\nbelow median HT. Among women, no association was\nfound between FI and %BF which is a more sensitive\nmeasure of adiposity. Our results indicate that, unlike\nBMI, %BF did not vary by HT among women. The\nimportance of HT in FI and BMI analysis was observed\nearlier and included as a control variable in a study which\nreported a moderate (P 5 0?06) but positive association\nbetween FI and BMI(11). Our results suggest that HT\nshould be considered when examining the association\nbetween FI and BMI.\nWe observed that marginal food security was asso-\nciated with shorter HT in women. In the case of men, it\nwas the extreme forms of FI, food-insecure without and\nwith hunger, which were significantly associated with\nshorter HT. The observation that FI was associated with\nshorter HT among men and women was not unexpected\nbecause HT deficits result from chronic under-\nnutrition(14,16), which is a possible consequence of FI. It\nwas difficult to glean from available data whether women\nwho were below median HT in the present study had\nexperienced FI for a longer duration than those who were\nof median HT or taller. However, an earlier report indi-\ncated that about two-thirds of food-insecure persons in\nthe USA experience FI as recurring while one-fifth\nexperience it as frequent or chronic(35).\nLow-income individuals, who largely include those who\nare food insecure, are associated with shorter HT(13,15),\nprobably due to difficulties in obtaining optimum nutrition\nnutrition by alleviating FI would improve adult HT and\nperhaps help to ameliorate its influence on the develop-\nment and progression of obesity. Improvement in adult\nHT is exigent because several disease risks have been\nassociated with short HT in adults. Short adult HT is\nassociated with risk of CHD and stroke mortality(31,37).\nFood insecurity, body fat and height 1857\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

A\nsignificant association between short HT and higher\nincidence of prostate cancer has been reported(39). Pre-\nvious studies have shown food-insecure individuals to\nbe at greater risk of developing many of these chronic\ndiseases(4,40,41). Our finding that FI was associated with\nlower HT underscores the public health importance of\nnutrition programmes that target individuals during the\ncritical times of growth. The positive influence on infant\nlength and well-being through participation in federal\nfood assistance programmes has been reported(42,43).\n%BF and BMI showed similar trends across food security\nlevels in men but not in women. Physiological adaptation\nin women such as leptin-mediated maintenance of critical\nfat mass for reproduction may contribute to obscure\ndifferences in %BF across food security levels(44). The\nlevels of FI observed in this population may not indicate\nenergy shortage among women(45). In addition, differences\nin %BF among women might have been obscured by the\nalready elevated %BF of the referent group, fully food-\nsecure women, in the present study.\nThe strengths of our study lie in the fact that we\nassessed two indicators of adiposity, %BF and BMI, to\nTable 2 Anthropometric characteristics of the study sample categorized by gender and adult food security status\nFood security status-\nFully food-secure-\n-\nMarginal food security Food-insecure without hunger Food-insecure with hunger\nMeasure Mean SEy Mean SEy Mean SEy Mean SEy\n*Significantly different from the fully food-secure category, P , 0?05.

Another strength is that the\nstudy accounted for important covariates including smok-\ning status, which is common among food-insecure persons\nand influences their dietary intake and composition(46,47)\nand body weight(48,49). Available literature indicates that,\nunlike the present study, only a few controlled for smoking\nin the study of the associations between FI and BMI(50).\nHowever, there is significant inverse association between\nsmoking and body weight(49). In the present study, food\nsecurity status information covered a reference period of\n12 months to improve sensitivity and to provide a more\nreliable assessment. Another important strength is that the\nstudy comprised a large sample of persons in the USA and\nthat the conduct of the study was carefully standardized.\nIn the present study, we observed a significant inter-\naction between food security status and HT in the asso-\nciation between FI and BMI. This observation indicates\nthat the trend in the association between FI and BMI was\ndifferent at different levels of HT. This observation further\nunderscores the fact that HT should be considered when\nexamining the association between FI and BMI as an\nindex of obesity.\nA limitation of the study is that the relationships between\nFI and %BF and BMI were based on cross-sectional data\nwhich do not permit inferences related to causality(5,11).\nBIA is a well-recognized method for %BF assessment(20\u00ad22).\nHowever, assessment of %BF using BIA may not be\nappropriate for individuals who have extremely low or\nextremely high BMI because %BF does not increase line-\narly with increasing body weight(51,52). Even though our\nsample size is large, it must be noted that the present study\nis based on a subsample of the subjects in the larger\nbe representative of the larger NHANES sample.\nThe present study shows that FI is associated with\nlower %BF, BMI and HT in men, and marginal food\nsecurity is associated with shorter HT in women. A sig-\nnificantly positive association of BMI with marginal food\nsecurity was found among women who were below the\nmedian HT. These observations highlight the need for\nmore vigorous public health efforts to alleviate the effects\nof FI and to improve food security in this population.\nLongitudinal studies, which should include repeated\nmeasures of FI, HT, weight and adiposity indicators across\nthe life cycle, are needed to further elucidate the asso-\nciations between FI and %BF, BMI and HT.\n"
