The aim of this article is to get insights\ninto how cooperating teachers and teacher educators express and understand their educational partnership and mutual\ncontribution to the practicum in PETE. Focus group interviews with cooperating teachers and physical education teacher\neducators (teacher educators) were analyzed by drawing on sensitizing concepts from figurational sociology. As such, the\nstudy has intended to identify networks between the two groups, as well as the interdependent nature, and consequent\npower relations in the partnership. The research may shed light on understanding why it seems difficult to reach the aim in\nthe national curriculum of a mutual partnership of the two groups in practicum.\n",

Practicum--that is, the periods of school\nplacement that student teachers have in the course of their\neducation--is considered an essential aspect of physical edu-\ncation teacher education (PETE) (Chambers & Armour,\nideal setting, student teachers are supported during the pract-\nicum by both teacher educators and cooperating teachers.\nThese three groups are referred to as the practicum triad\n(e.g., Belton, Woods, Dunning, & Meegan, 2010).\nAlthough practicum in PETE has been an object for inves-\ntigations, this line of research has mainly focused on the stu-\ndent teachers' points of view (e.g., Booth, 1993; Dunning,\nMeegan, Woods, & Belton, 2011; Jenkins, Garn, & Jenkins,\nStidder & Hayes, 2006; Tinning, Jenkins, Collins, Rossi, &\nBrancato, 2012). These investigations have established that\nstudent teachers value the practicum aspect of their education\nconsiderably higher than the university-based aspect of their\nteacher education programs. In fact, it is reported that student\nteachers claim to have difficulty seeing the relationship\nbetween these two contexts (Larsson, 2009; Mordal-Moen &\nthis situation is that student teachers find it difficult to make\nmeaningful connections between the theoretical coursework\nand its practical application in the teaching of PE during\nIn two recent articles, Standal et al. (2014) and Moen and\nStandal (2014) have explored what and how student teachers\nlearn during the PETE practicum. Similar to earlier findings,\nMoen and Standal (2014) found that the students were not\ninclined to reflect on the practicum experiences with a\nsocially critical perspective, but it was also found that the\nstudents were inclined to think critically about their own\nteaching performance as well as on the cooperating teachers'\nway of teaching. That is, contrary to earlier research (e.g.,\nVelija et al., 2008), the practicum was not found to be a site\nwhere student teachers uncritically digest everything they\nare told or shown.\nCompared with research on the student teachers, the per-\nspectives of teacher educators and cooperating teachers have\nreceived lesser attention in the literature. Although teacher\neducators appear highly appreciative of the significance of\nthe practicum element of PETE, studies reveal that they play\na very distant role during the practicum period (Larsson,\n1Hedmark University of Applied Sciences, Elverum, Norway\n2Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, Oslo, Norway\nCorresponding Author:\nKjersti Mordal Moen, Hedmark University of Applied Sciences, Postboks\nEmail: kjersti.mordal.moen@hihm.no\nPracticum in Physical Education Teacher\nEducation: An Educational Partnership?\nKjersti Mordal Moen1 and \u00d8yvind Standal1,2\n Keywords\nphysical education teacher education, practicum, cooperating, teachers, teacher educators, Norway\n2 SAGE Open\net al., 2008). In the Norwegian context, teacher educators are\ninvolved in the practicum in the role as a \"contact teacher,\"\nwhich means that they visit schools when student teachers do\nthat the teacher educators question the suitability and viabil-\nity of the role as contact teacher. For example, some view\npracticum visits as a needless use of time because they\nalready know the cooperating teacher and, by implication,\nknow what and how the mentors will perform their roles.\nRegarding the cooperating teachers, research has indi-\ncated that--much like student teachers--cooperating teach-\ners express a need for the students to spend more time in\nteaching practice to adequately prepare them for their future\nrole as PE teachers (Hynes-Dusel, 1999). It has also been\nshown that the mentoring process is hierarchical in the sense\nthat the mentors played the dominant role and the student\nteachers were subservient (Wang & Ha, 2012). Thus, power\nis an aspect of the mentoring process, and a topic we will\nreturn to later. Other studies report that the student teachers'\npre-conceived beliefs about what constitutes a qualified PE\nteacher are not challenged by cooperating teachers during\nas Velija and co-workers argue that if students are not ade-\nquately supported to make the connections between theory\nand practice, student teachers may end up accepting \"the\nideologies of those whose knowledge they value and which\nwill help them get by school-based mentors\" (Velija et al.,\nBased on the reviewed literature, it appears that teacher\neducators have a distant role in the practicum. This is also\nunderscored through research findings indicating that it is\nthe knowledge preferences of cooperating teachers, such as\nthe procedural, knowledge-in-practice (Hegender, 2010),\nwhich dominates the mentoring process in practicum. Thus,\nquestions can be raised about the nature and extent of the\ncooperation between the three parts of the practicum triad.\nAs a consequence, there have been calls for improved coop-\neration between the parties to ensure the students' learning\noutcomes (e.g., Moen & Standal, 2014). Chambers and\nArmour (2011) argue that \"in order to support PETE student\nlearning more effectively in Ireland, school and university\npersonnel must work in an effective partnership to educate\nPETE students\" (p. 541). To meet this challenge, an Irish\nresearch team has investigated the impact of a program\ndesigned to enhance the cooperation by supporting the\nmembers of the practicum triad. In three articles, presenting\nthe perspectives of the student teachers, teacher educators,\nand cooperating teachers, respectively, the program was\nfound to support the cooperating teachers in defining their\nrole (Belton et al., 2010). It also provided a framework to\nsupport the role of university supervisor (teacher educator;\nMeegan, Dunning, Belton, & Woods, 2013), and it led to\nbetter learning experiences for the student teachers (Dunning\nThe purpose of the present study was to explore the per-\nceptions and viewpoints of teacher educators and cooperat-\ning teachers on the practicum aspect of PETE in Norway. As\nsuch, our study can be seen as an attempt to cross-validate\nthe findings from the Irish research just presented. In addi-\ntion, research on the practicum in PETE has been compart-\nmentalized, dealing with the different groups of the practicum\ntriad in relative isolation. To the best of our knowledge, no\nresearch has been reported that has examined the perspec-\ntives of both teacher educators and cooperating teachers in\nthe same study.\nResearch Question and Perspective\nIt is well known that there exists a theory\u00adpractice fragmen-\ntation in PETE (e.g., Hegender, 2010; Moen & Standal,\n2014), where the practical aspects of teaching performances,\nsuch as planning and delivering lessons or class manage-\nment, are highly valued whereas the more theoretical aspects\nof PETE are given less value. Spendlove, Howes, and Wake\n(2010) suggest that the different roles of school and univer-\nsity \"represent a division of labour, which can be character-\nised as theory on the one hand, and practice on the other\"\n(p. 66). More precisely, they describe theory and practice as\nbelonging to separate worlds. Given that the official PETE\ncurriculum in Norway (Utdannings- og forskningsdeparte-\ncum is intended to be carried out in a partnership between\nstudent teachers, cooperating teachers, and teacher educa-\ntors, our research interest has been in the relationship\nbetween the cooperating teachers and teacher educators. Our\ninterest--as researchers and teacher educators--has been in\nhow teacher educators and cooperating teacher best can\nenable the student teachers to learn from the relationship\nbetween practicum and the other parts of the educational pro-\ngram. More specifically, we have been interested in how\nteacher educators and cooperating teachers see themselves as\nparticipants in a network (or not). Therefore, our research\nquestion has been how do cooperating teachers and teacher\neducators express their educational partnership and (poten-\ntial) mutual contribution to the practicum of PETE in rela-\ntion to the networks, interdependencies and power relations\nthey are a part of?\nFor the purpose of this study, we have drawn on resources\nFigurational theory emphasizes the need to locate people, in\nthis case, teacher educators and cooperating teachers, as\nparts of various networks or figurations. Figurations are the\nnetworks or \"webs\" of social relations (Elias, 1978) of which\npeople are inevitably a part. In other words, people are\nrelated to a large number of other individuals, groups and\nprocesses, past and present, which may be recognized or\nunrecognized and which amount to \"a structure of mutually\nAt the local level, teacher educators as well as cooperating\nMoen and Standal 3\nteachers are likely to have complex professional figurations,\nand they are involved in a web of relationships, which will\ninfluence their professional life and development. In the con-\ntext of PETE, this web of relationships is a process that has\nbeen formed from early childhood and school experience\n(acculturation), in sport training, during education (profes-\nsional socialization), and on-the-job experiences (occupa-\ntional socialization; Moen, 2011). As such, the webs of\nrelationships have formed a framework not only for the per-\nson's habitus but also for their socialization.\nTo discuss the research question and empirical material\ngenerated for this article, we have found sensitizing concepts\nfrom figurational theory; networks, interdependencies and\npower relations (Elias, 1978) to be relevant. In addition, the\nmore mainstream sociological term roles served as a sensi-\ntizing (Roberts, 2009). Although figurational theory has\nbecome increasingly commonplace in the sociology of sports\nover the last quarter of a century, it was only applied to PE\nGreen, Smith, & Roberts, 2005). Nonetheless, there has been\na steady subsequent growth of figurational studies on PE\nVelija et al., 2008). The sensitizing concepts applied on this\nparticular study will be elaborated in the discussion.\nPETE in Norway\ntaken, there were three different educational routes to become\na PE teacher in Norway. The first was to acquire 30 or 60\ncredits PE as a part of general teacher education (GTE). The\nroute enables the graduates to teach PE in primary and ele-\nmentary school (ages 6 to 16). Another route was to take a\nbachelor's degree in PE and sports (BAPE), a 3-year course\nof stud PE full-time in which students acquired the title sub-\nject teacher in PE. The route enables the graduates to teach\nPE in primary, elementary, and upper secondary schools as\nwell as at the \"folkeh\u00f8gskole.\"1 The third route to graduating\nas a PE teacher was to take a bachelor's degree in, for exam-\nple, sports sciences, outdoor studies, or fitness and then com-\nplete a further 1-year (60 credits) Practical and Didactical\nEducation (PDE) qualification, which qualifies the students\nas subject teachers in PE. The students are qualified to teach\nin primary, elementary, and upper secondary schools, but not\nat the folk high school.\nAll three routes into PE teaching are based on the national\nprogram.\nThe national curriculum for GTE (UFD, 2010) states that\nthere is a common responsibility between the cooperating\nteacher and the teacher educators regarding practicum and\nassessment of the student teachers in the practicum. In terms\nof the various roles of those involved in the practicum, it is a\nrequirement that the institutions develop a plan for the practi-\ncum in cooperation with the practicum school. The responsi-\nbilities of the university teacher, the cooperating teacher, and\nthe students have to be clarified in the local curricula, which\neach institution has to develop based on the national\ncurricula.\nMethod\nThe findings presented in this article are part of a larger study\nthat investigates the practicum aspect of PETE at three insti-\ntutions in Norway. More specifically, the overall study has\ninvestigated the perceptions, experiences, and viewpoints of\nteacher educators, cooperating teachers, and student teach-\ners, respectively. Whereas our two previous publications\nexplored the student teachers' perspective, this article\nexplores how cooperating teachers and teacher educators\nunderstand or express their educational partnership (mutual\ncontribution) in PETE.\nParticipants\nThree different university colleges (UC; called UC 1, 2, and\n3 for anonymity) were enrolled in the umbrella study, which\nconsisted of focus group interviews of student teachers,\ncooperating teachers, and teacher educators in each of the\nthree UCs participating in the study. The institutions invited\nto participate in the study were chosen on the basis of (a)\nproviding at least two of the three routes to become a PE\nUC including both small and large university collages, and\n(c) geographic location so as to include UCs located in both\nurban and rural settings. Two of the UCs were located in\nmore rural areas of Norway whereas the third was situated in\na large city. The size of three UCs varied considerably; how-\never, the size of the PE teacher educations programs was\nsomewhat similar. The rationale for this sample was to cover\nthe complexity in the Norwegian higher education system in\nHere, we draw on two focus group interviews of cooperat-\ning teachers and three focus interviews of teacher educators.\nThe cooperating teachers at the two UCs were all informed\nabout the study by our contact person at the UC, and invited\nto take part in the study. From those who volunteered to par-\nticipate, we randomly drew a selection of eight participants\nat each institution, four from each gender. Of the 16 cooper-\nating teachers asked to take part in the interviews, 12 (seven\nwomen and five male) actually took part in the study (see\nThe head of department at the three different UCs were\ncontacted by the first author. Subsequently, the head of depart-\nment gave information about the study to the teacher educa-\ntors and invited them to participate in the study. Among those\n4 SAGE Open\nwho volunteered to take part in the study, we made a random\nselection of eight participants from each institution, who were\nasked to attend the group interview. Of the 24 teacher educa-\ntors asked to participate in the interviews, 18 (seven women\nand 11 male) took part in the study (see Table 1).\nThe group sizes of the focus group interviews with both\ncooperating teachers and the teacher educators varied from\nfive to seven participants (see Table 1). This is fewer than we\nhad intended, but the numbers are still within the group size\nrecommended for focus group interviews (Malterud, 2012).\nAlthough we were able to facilitate focus group inter-\nviews of teacher educators from all three UCs, it was diffi-\ncult to get hold of cooperating teachers to attend the focus\ngroup interviews. We experienced difficulty for the cooperat-\ning teachers to find time to meet for group interviews, not\nleast because of the long distances from their schools to the\nUC (some had to travel more than 1 hr to attend), as well as\nbusy timetables in their everyday lives as teachers.\nConsequently, we only managed to complete focus group\ninterviews of cooperating teachers at two of the UCs.\nInterview Procedure\nThe focus group interviews with the teacher educators and\nthe cooperating teachers were semi-structured. Two key\nthemes (and related questions) formed the basis of inter-\nviews: (a) the teacher educators' and the cooperating teach-\ners' ideas about and perceptions of PE and PETE and (b)\ntheir viewpoints and experiences regarding the practicum in\nPETE. These themes are grounded in the research questions\nof the study and our knowledge of the research literature on\nthe topic. One researcher conducted all five interviews. The\ninterviews took place in quiet meeting rooms and were\naudiotaped with the teacher educators' and cooperating\nteachers' oral consent. All three interviews with the teacher\neducators lasted 1 hr and 30 min, whereas the two interviews\nwith the cooperating teachers lasted 1 hr and 10 min. Before\nstarting the interview, the interviewer gave a brief, standard-\nized explanation of the nature of the research. Furthermore,\nall participants signed a consent form where they agreed that\nthe information supplied could be used in publications by the\nresearch group if anonymized. This is in accordance with the\nethical guidelines of the Norwegian Social Sciences Data\nService who had previously endorsed the project.\nData Analysis\nThe interviews were transcribed verbatim and subjected to\nan explorative thematic analysis (Kvale & Brinkman, 2009).\nThe analyses were performed jointly by the two authors and\ntook place in steps where we independently read the tran-\nscripts and met on several occasions to discuss re-current\nthemes in the interviews. In the first stage, we independently\nread the transcripts with the aim of doing a meaning conden-\nsation (Kvale & Brinkman, 2009). This meant that relevant\nquotes from the interviews were highlighted and the immedi-\nate meaning in them expressed in shorter sentences. The\nresearch questions for the project as well as the main themes\nin the interview guide were guiding this first and initial step\nin our analysis. On the basis of our separate meaning conden-\nsation, we agreed on five main focused codes supporting the\nnext step in the analyzing process: \"just visiting,\" \"the differ-\nent roles,\" \"competence,\" \"cooperation and control,\" and\n\"problems and conflicts.\"\nIn the next step of the analysis, all interviews were re-read\nby the researchers independently having these five focused\ncodes and the sensitizing concepts roles, networks, interde-\npendencies, and power relations as a background, before we\nmet again to discuss the analyses. Thus, at this stage, the ana-\nlytical story moved in a theoretical direction. As a result of\nthis process, we decided on two main themes, \"just visiting\"\nand \"cooperation--polarization,\" as relevant to present our\nfindings. In the final part of the analysis, we discussed what\nquotations could best guide the story revealed from the\nanalyses.\nTrustworthiness\nTo ensure the trustworthiness, our use of investigator\ntriangulation (Brantlinger, Jimenez, Klinger, Pugach, &\nRichardson, 2005), as described in the \"Analysis\" section of\nthis article, strengthens the credibility of the study. The pres-\nent article is part of a larger research project involving other\nresearchers. We discussed the conceptualization of the study\nas well as the analyses and results with other members of the\nresearch team as well as colleagues who work in PETE. This\nhas functioned as a form of peer debriefing (Brantlinger\net al., 2005). During the analyses, we were all the time look-\ning for disconfirming evidence (Brantlinger et al., 2005) in\nall stages of the analyzing process, for example, by trying to\nfind statements that contradicted or nuanced the emerging\ncodes and categories. However, observational studies on the\npracticum visits would have improved our study, and we sug-\ngest future studies to implement observational elements.\nMultiple interviews of the subjects could also have increased\nthe trustworthiness of the study. However, we opted for inter-\nviewing several groups of teacher educators and cooperating\nTable 1. Information About Institutions and Numbers and Sexes\nof Teacher Educators and Mentor Teachers Participating in the\nFocus Group Interviews.\nTeacher educators Mentor teachers\n Female Male Female Male\nNote. UC = university colleges.\nMoen and Standal 5\nteachers, thus enabling us to explore their viewpoints and\nexperiences across different UCs.\nFindings\nJust Visiting?\nOne way of facilitating the cooperation between cooperating\nteachers and teacher educators is to organize meetings such\nas practicum preparation where cooperating teachers gather\nat the UC prior to practicum. Another meeting point was\ncommonly referred to as \"practicum visits,\" where teacher\neducators went to practicum schools to observe students\nholding lessons as well as take part in evaluations of these\nlessons. The purpose of the latter visits was described as to\n\"see that it actually works and that the cooperating teacher\ntakes the students seriously and does what we expect them to\ndo\" (Teacher educator [TE]-UC3).\nThe focus of the teacher educators during these visits is not\nso much on the individual lesson, as to get an overall impres-\nsion about how things work for the students and to see how the\ncooperating teachers follow up the students: \"I often think that\nthe supervision sessions are more interesting than the lessons,\nbecause there I get the impression of how things are going\"\n(TE-UC3) or \"When we visit practicum we are more interested\nin what they have worked with in the entire period, not neces-\nsarily what went on in the specific lesson we got to see. More\nhow the students have developed through period\" (TE-UC1).\n\"Visiting\" can be thought of as an expression that does not\nhave any meaning beyond it being an innocent notion used\nby all groups about the teacher educators' appearance at the\npracticum site. However, the word visit also contains impli-\ncations about the interdependency between cooperating\nteachers and teacher educators. For instance, our analysis\nclearly shows that the teacher educators are much more con-\ncerned about these visits than the cooperating teachers. This\nis evident in the sense that discussions about the visits were\nmore prevalent in the interviews with teacher educators.\nWhen cooperating teachers talked about visits, it was in rela-\ntion to rare cases where students were seen as unfit as teach-\ners, and they had to report this to the teacher educators.\nFor the teacher educators, these visits had a different\nmeaning. The visits meant that they had to leave their home\ninstitution and travel to the practicum site. It involved more\nof an effort for the teacher educators as compared with the\ncooperating teachers. More importantly, however, we find\nthat the teacher educators'experience being away from home\nin the sense that they have to behave as visitors. This becomes\nparticularly salient when difficulties arise:\nThe moment I visit their home court--I am visiting!--then I\ndon't want to step on their toes. I feel in a way that I come from\nthe university college and--Mrs. know-it-all! . . . I can ask\nquestions, but in a way I have to laugh at the same time. I don't\nwant to provoke them. (TE-UC1)\nThe teacher educator has a distinct sense of not wanting to\noffend the hosts that she visits and that she is afraid to use her\ncompetence both because she does not want to be perceived\nas someone who knows better and because she does not want\nto insult the cooperating teacher(s) she visits. This was found\nin all the interviews with teacher educators: \"I have some-\ntimes wondered about issues that have come up, but I haven't\nconfronted it in the situation\" (TE-UC2). Their strategy is\nrather to discuss it with colleagues when they come back to\nthe UC and possibly say that this or that cooperating teacher\nis not suitable for the job: \"If it is a serious problem, then we\nraise it internally [at the UC] and we don't request [that\nteacher] next year\" (TE-UC2)\nCooperation or Polarization?\nThe national curricula describe an ideal practicum as a joint\nenterprise carried out in cooperation between teacher educa-\nPrevious research, however, has portrayed what goes on at\nthe university and in practicum as two separate worlds\nbeen framed in terms of a theory\u00adpractice distinction. This\nwas to some extent also the case in our material: \"Lots of\ntheory is relevant, but the paradox is that we still have the\nseparation. For many it is only logical that theory is here [at\nthe university college] and practicum out there in the school\"\n(Cooperating teacher [CT]-UC2). In addition, one cooperat-\ning teacher stated that\nI would have liked them [the students] to visit us prior to the\npracticum. Now, they just jump right in and it is quite hectic.\nThey could have been prepared by seeing what we do and we\ncould have discussed and shown them different stuff . . . Because\nit is like theory and practice. Some of those who teach here [at\nthe university college] have hardly been working in the schools.\nIt is lots of theory. The everyday is very different. (CT-UC1)\nThe last quote illustrates not only the view taken by many\ncooperating teachers that the students should have been\nobliged to visit them prior to their practicum, it also\nexpresses a commonly held skepticism among cooperating\nteachers toward the degree to which teacher educators have\nmuch practical experiences with teaching PE. It is clear\nfrom the material we have analyzed that from the cooperat-\ning teachers' perspective, an essential purpose of the practi-\ncum is to experience and see what it is like to really be a\nteacher. As such, cooperating teachers manage a very impor-\ntant knowledge resource for the students' learning. It is also\nimportant to note that this view is held not only by cooperat-\ning teachers, but also by teacher educators: \"[The purpose of\npracticum] is to practice the role as a teacher with every-\nthing that goes with it . . . You have to be in a school to\npractice the role as teacher\" (TE-UC2), or as another teacher\neducator put it,\n6 SAGE Open\nFor me, the cooperating teachers are not colleagues, but\nimportant informants. Because it is many years since I worked\nas a PE teacher . . . I learn a lot from the cooperating teachers\neither from practical tips or whatever, really. (TE-UC1)\nIn line with the view expressed in the last quote, that par-\nticular teacher educator was quite critical toward the aca-\ndemization of PETE:\nIn the pursuit of doctoral degrees and professors, we have\nmissed out on that close contact with the field of practice and\nwith the cooperating teachers. We had one guy working here,\nwhose contract wasn't extended because he didn't have [a PhD],\nbut he was working well with the cooperating teachers and was\nwriting popularized texts about practical activities . . . And that\nwas shame because it was really a man who was focusing on all\nthis and really had something we needed. But most [teacher\neducators] are concerned with teaching other subject areas or\nqualifying for a higher academic level. I think it is a loss.\nThus, an opposition toward theory and an academic per-\nspective on PE(TE) is not only found among cooperating\nteachers, but also among the ranks of teacher educators.\nAlthough some cooperating teachers emphasize the useful-\nness of theoretical perspectives--\"one should approach the\npractical everyday work with theory . . . so a combination of\nboth theory and practice belongs [to practicum]\" (CT-UC3),\nteacher educators at all institutions expressed a view that the\ncooperating teachers to a larger extent should provide stu-\ndents with a meta-perspective on teaching PE:\nHow can you [i.e., the student] develop as a PE teacher in terms\nof who you are in a given school context. . . . Being able to see\nbeyond one's daily work as a cooperating teacher seems to be\nchallenging. (TE-UC1)\nOr as another said,\nThe cooperating teachers should familiarize themselves with\nwhat the students work with theoretically, what they should\nknow and what should be expected from the student. That it is\nnot only \"you did this and that well,\" but also reflect \"why did\nyou this or that,\" That is, make them reflect instead of always\ngiving them the answer. (TE-UC2)\nIn opposition to the quote above where one teacher educa-\ntor stated that cooperating teachers are informants and not\ncolleagues, the notion of a collegial relationship between the\ntwo groups was expressed by other teacher educators as well\nas by cooperating teachers. Some of the teacher educators\nhave backgrounds as PE teachers as well as cooperating\nteachers, \"so I definitely feel like a colleague\" (TE-UC3).\nOthers again express this collegial relationship as grounded\nin their common efforts to educate future PE teachers.\nHowever, there are different understandings as to how the\npartnership is implemented and realized. One teacher educa-\ntor said,\nBefore practicum we have a discussion between [us] and\ncooperating teachers and students. The cooperating teachers\nalways ask \"what are we going to focus on in this period. What is\nthe order?\" The experience is that when they get guidelines . . .\nthey are quite open to try them out. If we have wishes, then they\ntake care of them quite well. That's at least what I feel. (TE-UC1)\nThe intention to pull in the similar direction was also found\namong cooperating teachers: \"so I have to read their curri-\ncula and their plans for what we should focus on\" (CT-UC2).\nHowever, it was also expressed in the interviews that the\nteacher educators give the cooperating teachers rather free\nreins: \"They do it differently, and we have given them free\nreins as well. We have the overall [responsibility], but the\ncooperating teachers do it their way and have their own pri-\norities\" (TE-UC2). On one level, this might be an expression\nof different ways teacher educators work with the cooperat-\ning teachers. It was for instance expressed that \"it is a goal\nthat there should be close contact [between us] in order to\nhave understanding and respect and so on\" (TE-UC2).\nHowever, it might also be understood in the sense that the\ncontent and the purpose of the practicum are unclear, or as\nwe have highlighted above, that the different groups have\ndifferent views about what is most important during practi-\ncum. This disagreement is, for instance, expressed through\nthe emphasis put on trying out the everyday work of PE\nteachers in contrast to the need for reflection and meta-\nperspective on the practicum experiences.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, our interest has first and foremost been how the\nteacher educators and cooperating teachers understand or\nexpress their educational partnership in PETE. Based on our\nfindings, we argue that the teacher educators and the cooper-\nating teachers are involved in networks at a national level in\nthe sense that they refer to reading the national curricula. In\nearlier articles reporting student teacher data from this proj-\nect, we found, however, that the practicum was organized dif-\nferently not only between, but also within, the various UCs\nthat the national guidelines result in highly different practices\nacross UCs. In this present study, the most prevalent network\nidentified between the cooperating teacher and the teacher\neducators was at a local level in the sense that networks\nbetween teacher educators and cooperating teachers seem to\nexist as personal cooperation between the two groups.\nHowever, we have identified different types of personal coop-\neration between the two groups as well as within the groups in\nhow these networks are expressed. Before discussing the\nnature of these networks, we want to discuss how the two\ngroups perceived their roles in relation to practicum.\nMoen and Standal 7\nConsidering the roles, a concept that in sociological terms\nis understood as \"the pattern of behaviours and expectations\nshows that the teacher educators and the cooperating teacher\nfirst and foremost have a common understanding that the\nteacher educators take care of the students' theoretical\nknowledge development, whereas cooperating teachers\nfocus on the reality aspect of teaching. This is consistent with\nwhat earlier research describes as the theory\u00adpractice frag-\nmentation in teacher education. The fragmentation is\naddressed in the national curricula where the aim of an inte-\n2010). However, despite such aims in policy documents, our\nstudy shows that there still is a polarization on how cooperat-\ning teachers and teacher educators expressed their contribu-\ntion to the practicum in PETE. This came to the surface with\nregard to how the teacher educators were more inclined to\ntake a meta-perspective on the practicum experiences,\nwhereas the cooperating teachers focused on the everyday\nlife of teaching. Thus, based on our analysis, it can be sug-\ngested that despite intentions in the national curricula, the\nroles expressed by cooperating teachers and teacher educa-\ntors, respectively, seem to reinforce a traditional theory ver-\nsus practice dichotomy.\nThe traditional theory\u00adpractice fragmentation expressed\nin our material is one where there is a sharp, but rather na\u00efve,\nseparation of theory belonging in UCs and practice in the\nschools where practicum takes place. This is indeed also a\nfinding from other studies of practicum (Hegender, 2010).\nOur point here is not to analyze the epistemological assump-\ntions held by the groups involved in the practicum, but to\ndiscuss whether and how this way of talking about theory\nand practice can be seen as an expression of an educational\npartnership. One issue we would like to raise here is that in\nthe context of PETE, there is an added dimension to such a\ntheory\u00adpractice discussion as compared with GTE, because\nthe line of conflict between theory and practice proponents\n(to use an overly crude distinction) does not only run between\nthe prioritization of pedagogy and subject matter. In PE(TE),\nit is also a point that the subject matter is itself practical (that\nis, PE is one of the practical\u00adaesthetical subjects). This, we\nsuggest, may make the polarization between theory and prac-\ntice slightly different from that in GTE. Hence, the point of\nour analysis is not how our informants talk about theory and\npractice but that this talk expresses commitment to the roles\nas \"someone taking care of theory\" or \"someone taking care\nof practice.\" PE in higher education has, similar to other pro-\nfessional groups, seen an increased academization in the\nsense that there has been a growing number of PhDs and\nmore focus on research (Backman & Larsson, 2013). What\nwe found in this study was a tension between those who align\nthemselves with this academization and those who are more\nconcerned with the craftsmanship of teaching. Despite the\nmost common finding of polarization between the two\ngroups, some cooperating teachers and teacher educators\nhighlighted the need for more collegial relationship between\nthese two groups. Hence, some of them expressed their roles\nas providing mutual contribution toward PETE in line with\nthe expectations in the national curricula (UFD, 2003a,\ntion of PETE was criticized not only by cooperating teachers\n(e.g., the point that teacher educators have little or no real\nexperience teaching PE) but also by teacher educators. Thus,\nwhen it comes to the power struggles of what PETE should\nbe about, it is not so much the roles that are in opposition to\neach other as it is the viewpoints held by members of the two\ngroups.\nOur study revealed differentiated understandings of how\nthe cooperating teachers and teacher educators view their\nroles and respective contribution in PETE. On a practical\nlevel, our study identified differentiated forms of personal\ncooperation or networks between the two groups. In figura-\ntional theory, interdependency is a central concept (Elias,\n1978). Focusing on interdependencies within particular net-\nworks enables the researcher to conceptualize the relation-\nships between various people, in this case, between teacher\neducators and cooperating teachers. The most obvious coop-\neration or network we identified was the meetings that took\nplace during practicum: the practicum visits of the teacher\neducators. In line with the differentiated understanding of\ntheir roles, our findings suggest that the cooperating teachers\nand teacher educators also had different understandings of\nthe intention or relevance of these visits. Although the coop-\nerating teachers rarely talked about these visits, the teacher\neducators experienced the visits as important to check out\nhow the students were taken care of in practicum. However,\nif they experienced problematic issues, they did not address\nthese during the visit. Hence, a clear finding in our study is\nthe interdependent nature and consequent power relation\nbetween the two groups.\nIn figurational theory, power is viewed as an inevitable\naspect of all human relationships and exists within all figura-\npower is viewed as an aspect of relationships between peo-\nple. There is always a certain balance of power within a net-\nwork, involving struggles between interdependent and\nmore-or-less powerful groups. Supporting earlier research\n(Mordal-Moen & Green, 2014; Velija, Capel, Katene &\nHayes, 2008), our study shows that the cooperating teachers\nand, to some extent, the teacher educators, think the cooper-\nating teachers manage the most important knowledge base\nfor the students to achieve in PETE. This is also in line with\nthe findings from, for instance, Hegender (2010) who found\nthat in the context of practicum, it was the procedural knowl-\nedge in practice that was prioritized over propositional\nknowledge for practice. In this sense, it appears that the\ncooperating teachers are the ones in position of power in the\ncooperating teacher\u00adteacher educator relationship.\nOur study also shows that the cooperating teachers have\nmuch autonomy in defining their role. To capture the reality\n8 SAGE Open\nof day-to-day power relations and interdependencies within\ncommunities, Elias has developed a model for social rela-\ntions resolving around the concept of relations between\nestablished and outsider groups, which refer to uneven power\nbalance between these two groups, where the former group is\nthe powerful (van Krieken, 1998). Related to our study, two\nissues are relevant. On one hand, the teacher educators\nexplicitly expressed that they were in charge of practicum\nand that they gave instructions to the cooperating teachers of\nwhat to focus on in practicum. This might be an indication\nthat they viewed themselves as the insiders and powerful\nplayers in the cooperating teacher\u00adteacher educator network.\nHowever, a much more prevalent finding, which gives an\nimpression that the teacher educators were more of an out-\nsider in the network, was the fact that they gave the cooperat-\ning teachers rather free reins when it came to the content in\npracticum. This impression of the teacher educators being\nthe outsiders was also strengthened by the emphasis teacher\neducators put on being and acting as visitors at the practicum\nschools. Adding to this, it appears that teacher educators\navoid conflicts if they experience difficult issues when visit-\ning in practicum. On the other hand, teacher educators have\na certain possibility to end the contract with schools or coop-\nerating teachers who do not fulfill the requirements expected,\nas one teacher educator mentioned. However, this requires\nthat the UCs indeed can pick and choose which schools and\ncooperating teachers they send students to. In cases where\nthe UCs are in shortage of schools and cooperating teachers,\nthe threat implied by the teacher educators is not very real.\nIt is an aim that PETE has to be an integrated teacher edu-\ncation where teacher educators and cooperating teachers act\nin mutual partnership. We question whether the uneven\npower balance between the outsiders (teacher educators) and\nthe established groups (the cooperating teacher) identified in\nthis study is productive to fulfill the aim of an ideal practi-\ncum as a joint enterprise carried out in cooperation between\nteacher educators and cooperating teachers (UFD, 2003a,\nteachers to integrate practical experiences and theoretical\nknowledge in PETE (Larsson, 2009; Mordal-Moen & Green,\nof the power imbalance between cooperating teacher and\nteacher educators may shed light on why the students are left\nalone to make the connection between theory and practicum\n(practice).\nConcluding Remarks\nA limitation of the present study is that it only involved\nfocus group interviews of cooperating teachers from two of\nthe three UCs in our sample. Another limitation is the fact\nthat the focus groups interviews were held separately\nbetween the two groups. Although we experienced that both\ncooperating teachers and teacher educators were willing to\nshare their experiences, arranging focus groups with the two\ngroups together may have revealed more in-depth under-\nstandings of their contrasting viewpoints regarding their\neducational partnership. However, putting them together\nmay also have limited their opportunity to speak freely\nabout the viewpoints and experiences of the other group, as\nwe think they have been able to in this project. For further\nresearch, we suggest focus group interviews of teacher edu-\ncators and cooperating teachers together in the same inter-\nview to be an interesting project, as well as observational\nstudies, which emphasize the practicum visits of the teacher\neducators.\nAlthough practicum emerges as an important part of\nPETE, little research is devoted to specifically investigate\nthe practicum, and research on how cooperating teachers and\nteacher educators understand or express their educational\npartnership, or mutual contribution, to the practicum aspect\nof PETE is absent from the literature. The aim of this project\nhas been to shed light on the interdependent networks\nbetween these two groups. Drawing on sensitizing concepts\nfrom figurational sociology, our study has identified that the\ncooperating teachers are the powerful players (insiders) in\nthe cooperating teacher\u00adteacher educator network. Hence,\nthe aim of a mutual cooperation between the groups in pract-\nicum seems not to be fulfilled. Our research may help us\nunderstand why it seems hard to reach the aim in the national\ncurriculum of a mutual contribution (partnership) in practi-\ncum. In particular, we want to draw attention to our findings\nshowing the power struggles between the two groups, as well\nas the differentiated understandings the cooperating teachers\nand the teacher educators have of their roles related to practi-\ncum. In this regard, our study highlights many of the same\nchallenges for cooperation as found in the Irish cooperating\nphysical education teacher program (COPET) (Belton et al.,\nthe cooperation around shared workshops and documents\nappears to be a promising route to follow. What our study has\ncontributed with is the realization that the teacher educators\nand cooperating teachers do not necessarily represent two\nisolated and polarized camps: There are commitments to\nideas about the nature and purpose of practicum that cut\nacross membership to the groups. This, in our view, increases\nthe need to develop programs and models similar to COPET.\nHowever, such models must take into account national and\nlocal policies.\nThe policy implications of this kind of research appear\nclear-cut: For teacher educators to have greater influence--\nin the sense of being more involved about what student\nteachers experience during practicum--it may be necessary\nfor them to be more involved in teaching in the schools their\nstudent teachers are placed, perhaps even alongside the stu-\ndent teachers and cooperating teachers. Further, we suggest\nthat inviting the cooperating teachers to teach on campus\nmay help reduce the gap between the insiders (cooperating\nteachers) and the outsiders (teacher educators) identified in\nthis study.\nMoen and Standal 9\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNote\n1.
