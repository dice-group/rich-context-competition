A number of studies\nhave tested the hypothesis of genetic similarity by\nshowing that spouses and close friends are more\nsimilar than randomly paired individuals and that the\nfriends and spouses of more genetically related indi-\nviduals (e.g., monozygotic [MZ] twins) are more\nsimilar to each other than are those of less genetically\nrelated individuals (e.g., dizygotic [DZ] twins; Baker\nIn this analysis, we test the hypothesis of genetic\nsimilarity shared by best friends among adolescents\nusing MZ twins, DZ twins, and full siblings as well as\ntheir best friends collected by the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add\nHealth; Harris et al., 2003). Our analysis makes at\nleast three contributions. First, we use data on both\ngenetically related individuals and their friends\ndirectly. In almost all previous empirical tests, friends\ndata are reported by genetic relatives. The perceptions\nof others' behavior have been considered unreliable\nbecause the reporters tend to project their own behav-\nior onto others (Bauman & Ennett, 1996). In Add\nHealth, both the siblings and their friends are partici-\npants of the study. Second, we perform statistical tests\nto find out whether the friends of MZ twins are sig-\nnificantly more similar to each other than are those of\nDZ twins. No previous study appears to have per-\nformed such a test. Third, we provide a detailed\ndescription and examination of the biometrical\nresearch design for the hypothesis testing.\nSimilarity Among Friends\nIt has long been recognized that friends or peers tend\nto hold similar attitudes, exhibit similar attributes, or\nengage in similar behaviors.

Friends are found to be similar in height\n(Berkowitz, 1969), activities, needs, attitudes, and per-\nsonality (Berscheid & Walster, 1978). The incidence of\ndelinquent behavior was found to be associated with\nthe delinquency of the peer group (Matsueda 1982;\nMatsueda & Heimer, 1987). Girls who had low-risk\nfriends in their immediate circle of friends or in their\npeer groups were much less likely to experience sexual\nintercourse or pregnancy than girls who had average-\nor high-risk friends (Bearman & Bruckner, 2000).\nLazarsfeld and Merton (1954) introduced the term\n`homophily' to describe the similarity in attitudes,\nattributes, and behaviors among close friends.\nFriends Effects Versus Selection Effects\nScholars have offered two interpretations for the\nobserved similarity between friends. The traditional\nview tends to view influences from peers and friends\nas causal. That is, friendship changes the behaviors of\nthe individuals in the friendship and makes them more\nsimilar to each other. Adolescent behavior is consid-\nered especially vulnerable to the influences of friends\nand peers. One well-publicized view (Harris, 1995)\nargued recently that socialization mainly takes place in\nthe peer groups of childhood and adolescence and, in\ncomparison, parents do not have any important long-\nterm effects on child development.\nEarlier psychological literature often considered\nsocial or peer pressure the primary process of influ-\nargued that peers can change children's behavior\nbecause they put pressure on them. Later work has\ndemonstrated a whole spectrum of influence mecha-\nnisms from coercive pressure at one extreme to\nsomething very close to a reasoned debate at the other\nMost researchers acknowledge that not all the simi-\nlarity among friends is due to friend influence (second\ninterpretation). Two individuals may become friends\nbecause they are similar in some characteristics to each\nScarr and McCartney (1983) argued that children are\nnot only influenced by environment, they also actively\nparticipate in the creation of their own environment.\nChildren tend to seek the right environment that\nmatches their own genetic propensities. Friends and\npeers are a natural part of an adolescent's environment.\nPart of the similarity between friends may thus be\ndue to selection rather than influence. Researchers\ngenerally use the term `selection' to describe all\nprocesses, conscious or not, in which individuals\nsimilar in certain characteristics become friends\n(Berndt et al., 2002). Sociological (Bearman &\n(Bauman & Ennett, 1996) literature also refer to this\nas an issue of friends versus selection effects.\nEconomists sometimes treat this as the problem of\nendogenous group membership (Moffitt, 1998).\nSelection effects have been shown empirically to\nbe present for a wide range of adolescent behaviors.\nKandel (1978) reported that prior homophily on a\nnumber of behaviors and attributes is a determinant\nof friendship formation. Billy and Udry (1985) and\nBilly et al. (1988) provided evidence that both white\ngirls and white boys have a tendency to choose same-\nsex best friends whose sexual experiences are similar\nto their own. Psychological literature suggests that\nthe strength of friends' influence is exaggerated\nwhenever it is estimated by the association between\nchildren's characteristics and their friends' character-\nout two decades ago that ignoring the selection effect\nwould vastly overestimate the influences of friends.\nKandel's analysis suggests that the prominent work\nby Duncan et al. (1972) assessing the effect of friends\non educational aspirations exaggerates the estimates\nEvidence for our hypothesis will have implications\nfor the debate of friends versus selection effects. If best\nfriends are, indeed, to some extent, genetically similar,\nit would suggest a genetic role in friendship selection\nand formation even though our data can't inform on\nthe mechanisms of the selection and formation.\nFriends Data From Add Health\nA common methodological issue in the research on\nfriends' influence is using the same children to report\non both their own attitudes and behaviors and their\nfriends' attitudes and behaviors. In a study on school\ninvolvement and disruptive behavior, Berndt and\nKeefe (1995) showed that the estimates of friends'\ninfluence are generally higher for measures derived\nfrom students' reports on friends than for measures\nderived from the friends' self-reports. The discrepancy\nexists because children believe they are more similar to\ntheir friends than they actually are (Aboud &\nMendelson, 1996). When children are asked to report\ntheir friends' attitudes and behavior, they tend to\nproject their own attitudes and behavior onto their\nfriends. Previous work in sociology comparing mea-\nsures on perception of behavior with measures on\nactual behavior has also demonstrated this projection\ntendency for sexual behavior among boys (Wilcox &\nUdry, 1986) and for smoking and drinking behavior\namong male and female adolescents (Fisher &\nResearch Design\nTo investigate genetic similarity with respect to a trait\nsuch as cognitive ability among friends, an ideal\napproach is to identify the specific genes associated\nwith the trait. Evidence that the genes of friends were\nsignificantly more similar than the genes of nonfriends\nwould suggest a genetic basis for homophily with\nrespect to the trait. In the absence of such measures, we\nturn to indirect methods that take advantage of the\ninformation contained in genetically related individuals.\nGuang Guo\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Each\nunit consists of four individuals: Person A (A), Person\nB (B), A's friend (AF), and B's friend (BF). A working\nsample was contructed for each trait analyzed; a\nworking sample typically contains several hundreds of\nsuch units. Previous work suggests that A and AF are\nlikely to be similar with respect to certain personal\ncharacteristics (B and BF is equivalent to A and AF,\nand will be omitted when appropriate). However,\nsimilarity between friends may not be evidence for\ngenetic basis for friendship. For a test of whether best\nfriends share a genetic similarity, advantage was taken\nof data consisting of four types of units described by\nFigure 1: (1) units in which A and B form a MZ twin\npair, (2) units in which A and B form a DZ twin pair,\n(3) units in which A and B form a same-sex full sibling\npair, and (4) units in which A and B are unrelated\nsame-sex pairs randomly selected from the Add\nHealth data. After type (2) units are analyzed alone,\ntypes (2) and (3) units will be combined to increase\nsample sizes; types (2) and (3) units can be combined\nbecause DZ twins and full siblings share the same\namount of genetic material.\nOur hypothesis is primarily interested in the rela-\ntionship between A and AF. However, a direct\nestimation of the similarity or correlation between A\nand AF does not provide evidence on whether the rela-\ntionship is genetic or not. For the hypothesis testing,\nwe rely on the research design described in Figure 1.\nThe design can be viewed as a quasi `experiment' in\nwhich we vary the genetic relatedness between A and\nB, and record any corresponding systematic variations\nin the similarity between AF and BF with respect to\nsome individual characteristics. The crucial feature of\nthe research design is that the two structures ([1] a\npair of MZ twins with their best friends, and [2] a\npair of DZ twins with their best friends) are the same\nexcept that the amount of genetic material shared\nbetween MZ twins are twice as much as that between\nDZ twins. Therefore, if the MZ twins' friends are\nmore similar than DZ twins' friends, genetic factors\nmust be implicated.\nIt is assumed that (1) the genetic similarity between\nA and AF (if it exists) does not vary by whether A and\nB are MZ or DZ twins, (2) the environments for iden-\ntical twins are no more similar than the environments\nfor fraternal twins (the usual equal environments\nassumption for twin analysis), and (3) there is a\ngenetic contribution to the four traits/behaviors\n(Grade Point Average [GPA], the version Peabody\nPicture Vocabulary Test [PPVT] designed for Add\nHealth [AHPVT], aggression and depression) exam-\nined in this analysis.\nTable 1 is constructed to illustrate the reasoning.\nTo fix the idea, two cases are considered: the case in\nwhich a genetic similarity is, indeed, shared by A and\nAF, and the case in which a genetic similarity is not\nshared. In both cases, regardless of the type of twins\nused, correlation between AF and BF for certain traits\nand behaviors will be expected because (1) A and B\nare correlated since they are DZ or MZ twins and\nshare genetic and common environmental factors, and\n(2) best friends (A and AF) are correlated whether or\nnot genetic factors are involved (first column of the\nexpected empirical results). However, if a genetic simi-\nlarity is shared among best friends, the correlation\nbetween AF and BF for MZ twins will be stronger\nthan that of the DZ twins. The source of this stronger\ncorrelation is the greater genetic relatedness between\nMZ twins (between A and B) than DZ twins.\nWe will deem our hypothesis of a genetic similarity\namong best friends supported if empirical evidence\nshows a stronger correlation between AF and BF for a\ngreater genetic relatedness between A and B. Our\nhypothesis will predict that when A and B are a ran-\ndomly selected pair, AF and BF should not be more\nsimilar than randomly paired individuals; when A and\nB are DZ twins, AF and BF are substantially more\nsimilar than a randomly selected pair, and that when\nA and B are MZ twins, AF and BF are significantly\nmore similar than when A and B are DZ twins. The\nimportance of the role genes play is signified by the\nextent of the increase in similarity between AF and BF\ncorresponding to the increase in genetic similarity\nbetween A and B.\nAt least two other factors can influence the results\nof the `experiment'. First, genetic similarity between\nfriends is likely to be trait-specific. Our objective is\nnot to investigate the role the entire genome plays in\nfriendship formation or whether friends as whole\npersons are genetically similar. Rather, we investigate\nwhether genetic heritage for a number of personal\ntraits is implicated in friendship formation.

Individuals may want their friends to be\nlike themselves on some characteristics, but not\nothers. Individuals are likely to seek friends who are at\na similar level of academic performance. On the other\nhand, individuals may or may not want to seek friends\nwith a similar level of depression.\nSecond, criteria for selecting same-sex friends may\nbe different from criteria for selecting different-sex\nfriends. A same-sex friendship is when A and AF or B\nand BF are of the same sex. The level of academic\nperformance should be an important factor for same-\nsex friends as well as different-sex friends, but we\nexpect stronger results from the same-sex friends than\ndifferent-sex friends.\nTo avoid this potential confounding effect, an\nadjustment was made at two levels. At the level of the\nunit of analysis as described in Figure 1, we made sure\nthat the full sibling pair in each unit of analysis was of\nthe same sex. Then at the analysis level, all outcomes\nwere analyzed twice: once using same-sex friends and\nonce using different-sex friends (A and AF are of the\nsame sex).\nData and Analytical Methods\nSample and Measures\nThe data for the analysis come from the sibling sample\nwithin the Add Health, which is a school-based study\nthat focuses on the health-related behaviors of stu-\nStates. Add Health has deliberately incorporated the\nbehavior\u00adgenetic designs as components in an other-\nwise traditional survey. The sibling sample is\ncomposed of six groups: MZ twins, DZ twins, full\nbiological siblings, half biological siblings, cousins,\nand biologically unrelated adolescents living in the\nsame household. The result is an unprecedented\ngenetic sample for a national study of this magnitude.\nof the twins into MZ pairs and DZ pairs was based\nprimarily on self-reports of confusability of appear-\nance. At Wave III in 2002, DNA samples were\ncollected from a subset of the Add Health sample. The\nsubset consisted of 2574 MZ twins, DZ twins, and\nfull biological siblings. For these individuals, genomic\nDNA was isolated from buccal cells using a modifica-\ntion of published methods. The zygosity of the twins\nwas then redetermined at the DNA level through a\ncomparison of their match on 12 unlinked STR\n(http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/).\nIn the analysis, MZ twin pairs, DZ twin pairs, and\nfull biological sibling pairs were drawn from `in-home'\nAdd Health data. Different-sex DZ twin pairs and dif-\nferent-sex full sibling pairs were removed from the\nanalysis (when A and B are of different sex, see Figure\n1) because the nature of the relationship between two\nfemale friends (A and AF) may be considerably differ-\nent to the relationship between two male friends (B\nand BF).\nRespondents in Add Health were asked to nominate\nsame-sex and different-sex friends starting with the\nclosest friend, including girlfriends and boyfriends. To\nconstruct the unit of analysis described in Figure 1, one\nsame-sex and one opposite-sex friend were selected\nfrom these nominations for each adolescent in the\ngenetic pair samples. The grades from which GPA were\ncalculated were gathered in both the school question-\nnaire and the in-home interview. On the other hand,\nAHPVT, aggressive behavior, and depression were only\navailable in the home interview. Since fewer friends\nhave data on these measures, our analyses of these mea-\nsures contain fewer cases than the analysis of GPA.

The test was given to\nadolescents present at the in-home Wave I survey.\nPPVT has been used widely as a measure of academic\nperformance in social sciences (e.g., Duncan &\nAggression was measured by the average of the\nresponses to four questions. Respondents reported\nhow often during the past year they had (1) gotten\ninto a serious fight, (2) hurt someone badly, (3) used\n(or threatened to use) a weapon, and (4) taken part in\na gang fight. The response categories ranged from 0\n(never) to 3 (five or more times).\nThe depression variable was intended to measure\npsychological health based on the adolescents'\nresponses to questions from the CES-D Scale (Radloff,\ninterview questions pertaining to the respondent's\ngeneral health (see Appendix A). The depression\nindex, which represents the mean item score across 23\nitems that measure different aspects of depressive\nsymptoms, has a reliability of .879. Original responses\nwere ordinal in nature, ranging from 1 (never) to 4 (all\nthe time). Thus, a higher depression index score indi-\ncates more depressive symptoms.\nStatistical Models\nCorrelation coefficients were used to measure the\nhomophily between AF and BF with respect to a per-\nsonal characteristic. For exploratory purposes, this\ncan be accomplished by Pearson's correlation proce-\ndure. But for calculating correlation coefficients while\ncontrolling for age, regression methods were used. The\nstructural equation model (Neale & Cardon, 1992)\nhas been the standard method for analyzing twin and\nsibling data. More recently, Guo and Wang (2002)\nshowed that the mixed model or the multilevel model\n(which has long been established in statistical litera-\net al., 1992]) and included as a standard procedure in\nmany major statistical packages including SAS and\nSPSS) can be used for the analysis of biometrical data.\nGuo and Wang (2002) demonstrated that the mixed\nmodel generally yielded results equivalent to those\nfrom the SEM/Mx. Skrondal and Rabe-Hesketh\n(2004) showed the equivalence between the structural\nequation models and the multilevel models.\nA genetically informative sibling sample is essen-\ntially a sample of correlated observations with the\ncorrelation created by shared environmental and\ngenetic influences among siblings. The following\nmixed model estimates correlation coefficients while\ntaking into account the age of the siblings:\nY\nij(t)\n= \n+ \nage\nij\n+ u\nj(t)\n+ e\nij(t)\nwhere Y\nij(t)\nis the trait for adolescent i in pair j for\npair type t (MZ twins, DZ twins, DZ twins and full\nsiblings), \nis the intercept, \nis the coefficient for\nage, u\nj(t)\nis the pair-specific random effect for pair\ntype t, and e\nij\nis the individual-specific random effect\nor the ordinary least squares-like error term. The\nstandard assumptions are that u\nj\nand e\nij\nare mutually\nu\ne\n) random variables.\nThe within-pair correlation between AF and BF,\nadjusted for age, for sibling type t can be obtained\nfrom an \nt\nut\nut\net\n). Our hypothesis is that\n\nMZ\nis significantly larger than \nDZ\nand than \nDZ + fullsib\n.\nA formal comparison can be carried out via sta-\ntistical hypothesis testing using the null hypothesis\nH\n: \nMZ\n \nDZ\nor H\n: \nMZ\n \nDZ + fullsib\n. We carried out\nthis test using the bootstrapping method (Efron &\nTibshirani, 1993), which has long become a standard\ntool in the statistical literature for a wide range of\nstatistical problems. The computationally intensive\nbootstrapping method resamples the data by pair\n(without breaking up the pairs) with replacement for\n2000 times, each time reestimating the mixed model\nand recalculating \nMZ\n\u00ad \nDZ\n\nMZ\n\u00ad \nDZ\nare then ranked.

The correlation coefficients are estimated\nseparately for friends of MZ twins, friends of DZ\ntwins, and friends of DZ twins and full siblings as well\nas friends of randomly paired individuals from the\nsibling sample of the Add Health.

The former is generally stronger than the\nlatter. For example, the correlation between the MZ\ntwins for GPA is .68 as compared with the correlation\nof .55 (Table 2) between the friends of the MZ twins.\nSimilarly, the two estimated correlation coefficients for\nfor the friends of the MZ twins, respectively.\nDiscussion\nOur analysis has produced evidence that the resem-\nblance between AF and BF is stronger when A and B\nare MZ twins than when A and B are DZ twins or\nwhen A and B are DZ twins or full siblings. As\nexpected, the evidence only comes from the analysis of\nsame-sex friends. Of the four traits or behaviors under\nconsideration, GPA and aggression have yielded statis-\ntically significant results by the bootstrapping\nprocedure, that is, the difference in correlation\nbetween MZ and DZ twins is significant. So is the dif-\nference between MZ twins and the combined sample\nof DZ twins and full siblings. The results for AHPVT\nare only significant for MZ twins versus the combined\nsample of MZ twins and full siblings. The difference\nbetween MZ and DZ twins for AHPVT is close to but\nnot quite significant. For depression, the analysis of\nsame-sex friend pairs did not yield a statistically sig-\nnificantly stronger correlation for MZ twins.\nWe consider these findings evidence for a genetic\nsimilarity shared by best friends among adolescents in\nthe United States. The MZ twins, DZ twins, and full\nsiblings have isolated genetic from environmental cor-\nrelation among best friends and provide an instrument\nthrough which the genetic similarity between A and\nAF can be identified.

If AF\nis completely unrelated to A genetically, the increased\nsimilarity due to increased genetic relatedness alone\nbetween A and B will not be reflected in the increased\nsimilarity between AF and BF.\nThese data must be interpreted with caution. Even\nif friends are, indeed to some extent, genetically alike,\nfriends do not receive the same genes the way biologi-\ncally related siblings receive the same genes from their\nparents. A substantially greater variety of patterns\nmust exist with respect to genetic relatedness among\nbest friends than among biological relatives. For\nexample, friendship decisions are probably based on\nphenotype rather than genotype recognition, suggest-\ning a role by genetic heterogeneity, defined as distinct\ngene sequences at the same locus (allelic heterogeneity)\nor different loci (nonallelic heterogeneity) responsible\nfor indistinguishable phenotypes. Not all individuals\nseek friends who are similar to themselves in certain\ntraits and behaviors. Among those who do seek\nfriends similar to themselves, not all individuals look\nfor the same set of traits and behaviors in their\nfriends. Our results are an average of all extant pat-\nterns observed in the sample.\nThe suggested genetic basis for homophily among\nfriends is trait-specific. The existence of a genetic basis\nfor measures like GPA and cognitive test scores does\nnot necessarily imply a genetic basis for another trait.\nDepression could be one of those traits. We have rea-\nsoned that the larger the gap between the correlation\nfor the MZ twins' friends and the correlation for DZ\ntwins' friends, the larger the role genes might have\nplayed in friendship formation. But we do not know\nthe exact size of the genetic role because no heritabil-\nity can be derived from the correlation estimates for\nthe trait in question.\nMore MZ twins (15.7%) than DZ twins (7%)\nnominate the other twin as a best friend. However,\nthis does not necessarily lead to an overestimation of\nthe genetic component. Indeed, if there is a genetic\ncontribution to friendship formation, we would expect\nthe number to be larger for MZ twins than DZ twins.\nOur empirical findings are in support of Rushton's\n(1989) hypothesis of genetic similarity at least in the\ncase of best friends among adolescents. Recognizing\nthe genetic contribution for homophily in adolescent\nfriendships has also important implications for under-\nstanding the nature of friend or peer influences. Social\nscientists have long suspected an essential role of peer\ninfluences in shaping the behavior of adolescents.\nAbundant evidence has been found linking individu-\nals' behavior with their friends' behavior. The\ntraditional approach tends to attribute all of this\nlinkage to friends' influence. While recognizing that\npart of the linkage may well be friends' influence,\nmore recent work argues that part of the linkage may\nbe due to selection and that ignoring selection would\nexaggerate friends and peer influences. Our analysis\nhas not only provided evidence for the selection argu-\nment, but has also shown that part of the selection\nmay be genetically based.\n"
