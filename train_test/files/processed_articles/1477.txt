It is unknown if CRP polymorphisms are\nassociated with CKD progression or modify the effectiveness of anti-hypertensive therapy in delaying CKD progression.\nDesign, setting, participants, & measurements: We genotyped 642 participants with CKD from the African American Study\nrs3093058. We compared the minor allele frequencies (MAF) of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in AASK to MAFs\nof African Americans from NHANES III.

Among AASK participants, the rs3093058_T allele predicted higher CRP concentrations (P <\ncompared with the AA genotype (P  0.002). Participants with the rs2808630_GG genotype on angiotensin converting enzyme\ninhibitors (ACEIs) versus  blockers had increased risk of progression (P  0.03).\nConclusion: CRP SNPs that were associated with higher levels of CRP did not predict CKD progression. The rs2808630_GG\ngenotype was associated with higher risk of CKD progression, and in patients with this genotype, ACEIs did not slow\nprogression.\nFamilial clustering of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and\nESRD has been reported in populations throughout the\nworld for most types of nephropathy (1\u00ad6). This genetic\npredisposition to ESRD seems to be strongly associated with\nrace (7,8). Compared with people with no family history of\nkidney disease, African Americans with a first-degree relative\nwith ESRD have a nine-fold increase in the risk of ESRD com-\npared with a three- to five-fold increase in whites (8). Recently,\nthe candidate gene MYH9 has been identified as associated\nwith nondiabetic ERSD in African Americans, and this associ-\nation explains some of the disparity in incidence of ESRD\nobserved between whites and African Americans (7,9).

Additionally, we examined whether these\npolymorphisms modify the renoprotective effects of angioten-\nsin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), a drug class known\nto have anti-inflammatory effects (26\u00ad28). We hypothesized\nthat patients with polymorphisms associated with higher levels\nof CRP would benefit most from ACEIs.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy Participants\nThis study included participants from the African-American Study of\nKidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) trial and The Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). The AASK\ndesign and results have been previously described (9,29). Briefly, par-\nticipants were self-identified African American, 18 to 70 yr, with hy-\npertension defined by diastolic BP 95 mmHg and a GFR between 20\nExclusion criteria included (1) identifiable cause of CKD other than\nhypertension; (2) diabetes mellitus (DM); (3) urine protein/creatinine\nratio 2.5; (4) accelerated or malignant hypertension within 6 mo; (5)\nsecondary hypertension, (6) serious illness; and (7) specific contraindi-\ncation to a study drug. The protocol for genetic testing was approved\nby the institutional review board at each center, and written informed\nconsent was obtained. Similarly, an Ethical Review Committee from the\nCDC was obtained for the NHANES III genetic information.\nThe AASK trial followed a 3  2 factorial design. Participants were\nrandomized to  blockers (BBs; metoprolol 50 to 200 mg/d), calcium\nchannel blockers (CCBs; amlodipine, 5 to 10 mg/d), or an ACEI\n(ramipril, 2.5 to 10 mg/d) and to two levels of BP: low (mean arterial\n(29). Data were collected for the following comorbidities: cancer, liver\ndisease, congestive heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, arrhyth-\nmias, and cardiovascular disease. An interim analysis at 3 yr halted the\namlodipine arm because patients with proteinuria (Upr/Cr  0.22)\ntaking amlodipine had faster GFR decline. DNA samples were avail-\nable for 670 AASK participants that entered the trial. Serum CRP\nconcentrations were measured in the AASK participants by nephelom-\netry using a high-sensitivity assay (Dade Behring BN I). All measure-\nments were done by a central laboratory at the Cleveland Clinic labo-\nratory.\nThe NHANES are surveys conducted by the Centers for Disease\nControl to provide national estimates of the health of the U.S. civilian\nnoninstitutionalized population. In the second phase of NHANES III\n7159 consenting participants. We used genetic data from NHANES III\nparticipants that were self-identified African American, had GFR 60\nml/min, did not have DM, and had a UP/Cr ratio 2.5. For the\nNHANES III, we defined DM as self-reported physician diagnosis of\nDM, use of DM medications, fasting glucose 126 mg/dl, or a random\nCRP Polymorphism Genotyping\nFive tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected\nbased on variation data for 23 European Americans and 24 African\nAmericans resequenced by Seattle SNPs (pga.gs.washington.edu)\nprevious reports of its association with decreased CRP levels. Geno-\ntyping was performed using TaqMan Assays By Design (Applied Bio-\nsystems, Foster City, CA) under standard conditions. All markers had\na 95% or higher genotyping efficiency.\nOutcomes\nThe main outcome for the AASK and for this study was a composite\nendpoint of (1) GFR event defined as halving of the baseline GFR or a\nwas measured at baseline, at 3 mo, and every 6 mo thereafter. The\nfollow-up of the trial ranged from 3.5 to 6.5 yr. Additionally, we\ncompared at baseline the allele frequencies of each SNP in the AASK\nparticipants with those in the African Americans from the NHANES III\nwith normal kidney function as described previously (21).\nStatistical Analysis\nAll analyses were completed using SAS/Genetics 9.1 (SAS Institute,\nCary, NC) and STATA 9 (College Station, TX). Each of the CRP SNPs\nwas assessed to determine whether the observed genotype frequencies\nwere in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Marker-marker linkage disequi-\nlibrium was assessed using r2, calculated for all pairwise SNP compar-\nisons in the AASK dataset. We considered significance for a two-sided\nBonferroni's correction for the number of genotype comparisons. CRP\nwas log-transformed, and the distribution was checked for normality.\nCox proportional hazards and Kaplan Meier plots were used to test the\nassociation between SNP and the composite outcome. Variables were\nselected a priori for the multivariate analysis. Haplotypes were inferred\nfrom tagSNPs using the expectation-maximization algorithm provided\nby SAS/Genetics 9.1, which also provides the probabilities for each\nindividual's inferred haplotype pair for subsequent regression analy-\nses. Common haplotypes (5% frequency) were determined from the\nmost likely pair of haplotypes inferred by the expectation-maximiza-\ntion algorithm. This study was an ancillary study to AASK, and as such,\nthe analyses were not performed by the AASK Data Coordinating\nCenter.\nResults\nParticipant baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1.

No CRP haplotype was associated with the composite\nendpoint.\nDiscussion\nThe primary goal of this study was to evaluate the role of\nCRP polymorphisms in CKD progression. AASK represents an\nideal population to study these associations because CKD pro-\ngression occurs four times faster in African Americans (32).\nAlthough our study suggests that some common mechanisms/\ngenetic susceptibilities to ESRD may share a common pathway,\nit is important to acknowledge that distinct renal diseases may\ninvolve other independent factors. Our study is performed in a\ncohort of African Americans with hypertensive kidney disease.\nwith increased levels of CRP in the CKD population (TT versus\nAT and AA genotypes) and is consistent with what has been\nshown in the general population (20\u00ad24).\nassociated with increased CRP levels, was marginally higher in\nthe AASK population than community controls, this was not\nstatistically significant. More importantly, we found no associ-\nation between this allele and CKD progression. On the other\nhand, we showed a strong association between the\nlevels of CRP (21,22), and both baseline CKD (higher in AASK\nthan in controls) and CKD progression, as reflected by the\ncomposite endpoint. Additionally, we showed that individuals\nwith this genotype assigned to ACEI progressed faster than\nthose assigned to BBs.\nTable 8.

Although\nepidemiologic data support the role of inflammation, including\nCRP in the pathogenic process (11,13\u00ad15), CRP is a surrogate\nmarker of the inflammatory process (33). CKD patients have a\nhigh burden of comorbidities, and reverse causation may ex-\nplain the associations with CRP. However, studies of non-CRP\ninflammatory cytokine gene polymorphisms could provide a\nlink between inflammatory genes and pathways with CKD.\nThe underlying mechanisms regarding the association be-\nendpoint in this study remains unclear. Despite adjustment for\nmultiple comparisons, it is possible that this association repre-\nsents a false-positive finding. A potential explanation is that the\nanother functional SNP associated with ESRD not genotyped\ndirectly in our study. Using the Genome Variation Server\n(gvs.gs.washington.edu/GVS/), we surveyed a 50-kb region\nnational HapMap Project (34). No SNP was in high linkage\ndisequilibrium (defined as r2  0.80), and 12 intergenic SNPs\nwere in moderate linkage disequilibrium (defined at r2  0.50).\nFine mapping and functional studies will be needed to identify\nthe causal SNP underlying the association described here.\nresponse to reno-protective interventions. Our hypothesis was\nthat individuals with chronic inflammation will benefit the\nmost from ACEIs (26\u00ad28,35). Albeit small sample size, individ-\nuals with the most common genotype AA and UP/Cr ratio\n0.22 benefited from ACEIs. Individuals with the less common\ngenotype, GG (low inflammatory profile), were at an increased\nrisk for the primary endpoint even when allocated to ACEIs\ncompared with BBs (9). These findings should be considered\npreliminary and need to be confirmed in larger studies.\nThe main strength of our study is that it was performed in an\nrandomized controlled trial primarily designed to address CKD\nprogression, and therefore, outcome ascertainment was opti-\nmal. GFR, for example, was performed using the gold standard\niothalamate clearance. Also, the longitudinal nature of the\nstudy allowed us to evaluate the genotype effect in disease\nprogression among high-risk patients with CKD stages 3 and 4.\nOur study is not without limitations. First, our study results\nare limited to African Americans with hypertensive CKD and\ncannot be extrapolated to other populations or other diseases.\nIn addition, neither the AASK nor the NHANES III dataset\ncurrently has ancestry informative markers to adjust for admix-\nture. Our main focus is CKD progression within the AASK\ncohort, which was a multicenter study across the nation, and\nancestry background should be similar. However, admixture\nmarkers will need to be performed in the AASK cohort for\nfuture comparisons with other populations.\nFinally, a limitation of our study is the lack of replication for\nthe association of CRP polymorphisms and CKD progression in\nother independent cohorts. However, our study represents an\nindependent replication for the association of CRP polymor-\nstudies in racially diverse CKD progression cohorts will be\nnecessary to substantiate the new findings.\nIn conclusion, CRP SNPs that are associated with higher\nlevels of CRP were more common in African Americans with\nhypertensive CKD than in African Americans without CKD;\nhowever, these SNPs were not associated with CKD progres-\nsion. Additionally, we showed an association between the\nbaseline CKD and the risk of CKD progression and potential\nloss of renal benefit from ACEIs. Larger studies in African\nAmericans are needed to further explore the role of CRP poly-\nmorphisms in response to ACEI and CKD progression.\n"
