    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe birth of Prince William's son in July 2013 was the occasion for an outpouring of media speculation about the fate of the\nroyal baby's foreskin. The possibility that he might be circumcised was connected to a purported tradition of circumcision\nwithin the British royal family, said to be have been initiated either by Queen Victoria or by George I. In this article, we\ntrace the origins and evolution of these stories and assess their validity. Our conclusion is that belief in a royal circumcision\ntradition derives from the reported circumcision of Prince Charles by the mohel Jacob Snowman in 1948, and the efforts of\nthe British Israelite movement to concoct a \"lost tribes of Israel\" origin for the British race. These elements merged into a\nfully developed narrative that was widely disseminated from the late 1990s. The initially separate claim that the tradition was\nimported from Hanover by George I can be sourced precisely to 2012. We further show that these stories are inventions,\nand that the royal family circumcision tradition should be regarded as a classic instance of a contemporary legend or urban\nmyth.\n",

When the\ncultural heritage of royalty is combined with the rituals of an\nancient religion, the result is likely to be a fertile source of gos-\nsip and stories, both factual and invented. A case in point was\nthe media commentary on the birth of Prince William's son in\nJuly 2013 and the breathless (not to say prurient) speculations\non the fate of his penis. As routine circumcision lost favor in\nBritain during the 1950s, one's natural assumption was that the\nbaby would be treated like any other British-born boy; but\naccording to London's Daily Telegraph there is something\n\"odd\" about the British royal family that placed a question mark\nover his foreskin (Wallop, 2013). That something is the family's\nalleged \"tradition of circumcision.\" The tradition is usually\nstated to have begun with Queen Victoria, but in the media free-\nfor-all inspired by Prince George's birth, some news outlets and\ncommentators pushed it right back to the beginning of the 18th\ncentury and the first of the Hanoverians. What is striking about\nthe media and the online commentary is that nobody seems to\nhave questioned the veracity or even the likelihood of these\nclaims--a deficiency that we aim to correct in this article.\nThree Versions of the Legend\nIn their contemporary presentation, accounts of the royal\nfamily's circumcision tradition take three forms:\n1. Queen Victoria believed the British royal family, and\nthus herself, to be descended from King David, and\naccordingly circumcised all her male children, begin-\nning with Albert Edward (later Edward VII). This\nstory was retold in countless media features, websites\nand blogs at the time of Prince George's birth, and\ncan also be found in several academic publications,\nsuch as Shalom Goldman's God's Sacred Tongue\nAs late as the mid-nineteenth century influential British\naristocrats . . . adopted a \"British Israelite\" ideology.. . . Though\nthis group later discredited itself with its reactionary politics and\nthinly veiled anti-Semitism, certain of its ideas still persist in the\nupper reaches of British society.. . . some insist on a biological\nconnection between English royalty and the ancient Davidic\nkingship. Queen Victoria seems to have subscribed to this\nDavidic theory and had her male children circumcised by a\nJewish ritual circumciser, a mohel.

(p. 21)\nGoldman's source for these claims is an article in a popular\nJewish magazine by Edgar Schoen (1997), a retiredAmerican\nMD with strong pro-circumcision sympathies, a point to\nwhich we shall return. Brian Morris, a professor of molecular\nbiology at the University of Sydney, similarly states on his\nwebsite Circumcision: An Evidence-Based Appraisal,\nThe British Royal Family and the upper classes are circumcised\nand the lower classes and those who left school before 17 much\nless so. Queen Victoria believed her family descended from\nKing David (of the Biblical Old Testament) and sanctioned\n2. A version of Queen Victoria story in a recent American\npregnancy manual takes a slightly different angle:\nCircumcision was unheard of by Christians in Europe orAmerica\nuntil after 1841, when Queen Victoria's doctor (who had travelled\nthrough Africa and the Middle East) advised her to circumcise\nbaby Prince Albert [i.e., Edward]. Victoria did, was happy with\nthe results, and the British royal family has kept the tradition ever\nHere it is not Victoria's belief about her ancestry that\ndetermined her decision, but a recommendation from her\nmedical advisor. On the face of it, this story has greater plau-\nsibility, though it is by far the least commonly heard, and\nsurfaced only briefly on Twitter at the time of Prince George's\n3. A third version of the story seems to have been newly\nminted in response to the birth of Prince William's\nbaby in July 2013, namely, that the circumcision tradi-\ntion was introduced by George I on his arrival from\nHanover in 1714. According to an article in the\nJerusalem Post, widely copied in other (especially the\nUnited States) media,\nmembers of the Royal House of England have been ritually\ncircumcised.. . . Queen Victoria, known for her more prudish\nsentiment, was certainly not amused by foreskin and had all her\nmale offspring circumcised. (Weiniger, 2013)\nNot surprisingly, the article gives no source for these\nclaims, and does not tell us whether the Hanoverian dynasty\nwere already practicing circumcision back in Germany, or\nwhether \"the tradition\" started only on their arrival in England.\nRoyal Circumcision Tradition: Birth of\na Contemporary Legend\nIt is not clear when the Queen Victoria story first emerged;\nlike all urban legends its origins are obscure and perhaps\nimpossible to pin down. An early sighting is the article by\nEdgar Schoen cited by Professor Goldman, \"The circumci-\nsion decision,\" in which Schoen laments the decline of rou-\ntine circumcision in the United States, stresses the medical\nbenefits supposedly associated with it, and hopes/predicts\nthat the trend away from circumcision will reverse. Along\nthe way he adds historical tidbits on the connection between\ncircumcision and royalty:\nQueen Victoria, convinced that the British royal family was\ndescended from King David, had her male offspring circumcised.\nThis tradition continued through Edward VII, the Duke of\nWindsor, and Charles, the current Prince of Wales, who was\ncircumcised by a well-known physician and mohel, Dr. Jacob\nHe also states--mistakenly (Androutsos, 2002)--that\nLouis XVI of France was circumcised because of a tight\nforeskin, and regrets that the British tradition came to an end\nwith Princes William and Harry, neither of whom he believes\nwere circumcised. Schoen repeats this story, minus the\nDavidic lineage, in a later booklet advocating widespread\nroutine infant circumcision:\nIt seems that since the time of Queen Victoria all males of the\nBritish Royal Family were circumcised shortly after birth. In\nkeeping with this tradition, the circumcision of the infant Prince\nCharles was carried out at Buckingham Palace by Dr Jacob\nSnowman, a well known London physician, who was not only a\nsurgeon, but an Orthodox Jew and a Mohel, a religious\ncircumciser. But the new Royal young couple decided to end\nthis traditional circumcision practice, and both of their sons, the\nPrinces William and Harry, were left \"intact,\" the word used by\nthe opponents of circumcision to describe the uncircumcised\nSchoen introduces this information in the context of an\nattack on NOCIRC, a community-based American organiza-\ntion campaigning against nontherapeutic (routine) circumci-\nsion of infants, as is common in the United States (Owings,\nUddin, & Williams, 2013). He goes on to deplore the disap-\npearance of routine circumcision in Britain, and to make\nvarious guesses as to the reasons for this development,\namong which are a fashion (favored by Princess Diana) \"to\ntry avoiding all discomfort to newborns,\" and a feeling that\n\"the uncircumcised penis was . . . considered `genital chic.'\"\nSchoen--a medical practitioner with no expertise in medical\nor cultural history--gives no references for his own claims,\nand one questions the propriety of a scholar such as Goldman\nciting such an unreliable source in an academic publication.\nWhen we asked him about his own source, however, Schoen\nwas very forthcoming:\nI got the info regarding Queen Victoria indirectly from Dr Jacob\nSnowman, the London physician and Mohel, who, as you noted,\nperformed Prince Charles' circumcision.. . . I didn't get the\ninformation directly from Dr Snowman, who was already dead\nwhen I found about his royal role. Rather I found out about it\nDarby and Cozijn 3\nfrom Dr Morris Sifman, who was also a London physician and\nMohel. In 1996 Dr Sifman wrote me to say that he had read\nsome of my work and asked if I had suggestions as to how he\ncould deal with an active anti-circumcision group, which\nincluded some secular Jews, that was harassing him and getting\na good deal of media attention in England. As you may be aware\nthe British medical establishment has long been outspoken\nagainst circumcision, so he couldn't get help from them. Over\nthe next couple of years I communicated with Dr Sifman and\nactually met with him on a trip my wife and I took to London.\nDr. Sifman was probably the most active Mohel among the\nOrthodox Jewish community in London at the time. Snowman\nhad died and he seemed to be his successor. Although Sifman\ndidn't mention being called upon by royalty, he knew Snowman\nwell. He mentioned that Snowman had told him that before\nPrince Charles he had circumcised other less prominent royal\nfamily members and other nobility males, and that he was aware\nof Mohels before him who had also circumcised royal family\nmembers. It was Snowman's understanding that the practice\nwent back to Queen Victoria's era, which was about the time that\nnewborn circumcision started to become the practice in the US\nas well, mainly among the upper classes. (E. Schoen, personal\nThis account is fascinating as an archetypal instance of\nhow an urban (or contemporary) legend emerges and spreads.\nFirst there is an oral tradition within a defined community;\nthen there is hearsay as the story is passed on to others\n(Dr. Sifman heard it from Dr. Snowman; he told me;\nSnowman believed that . . .); next the story is put into print\nby somebody with sufficient intellectual authority to get\naway with not giving a source; and finally the information is\ncited as a fact by others. All the elements of a classic urban\nlegend are present, including absence of a definite source;\nprima facie plausibility; and deep significance for those cir-\nculating it--in this case, prominent members of the Anglo-\nAmerican Jewish communities who would appear to feel that\na royal tradition validates their own commitment to circum-\ncision and confirms their status as respected insiders (Pfeffer,\n2012). There is even an implicit moral: If circumcision is\ngood enough for the royal family, it is good enough for\neveryone. Indeed, in a subsequent book Schoen suggests that\n\"universal newborn circumcision is becoming an achievable\ngoal,\" because the Chinese could simply order everyone to\nbe circumcised, and it would happen:\nIn China there is a powerful and increasingly prosperous central\ngovernment ruling 1.2 billion people, and once a decision is\nmade there is the will and the wherewithal to quickly and\ndecisively implement any circumcision program, whether\ntargeting high risk men or involving the entire population.\nWhat is also interesting is that Schoen describes his source\nas oral transmission and does not seem to be aware of another\nprinted source--a compendium of Jewish religious/lifestyle\npractice compiled by Alfred Kolatch, published in 1981: \"In\nEngland, the Royal House has a long tradition requiring that\nall royal male children be circumcised by the Jewish mohel\nthe book, published 14 years later, the passage is repeated\nwith significant additions:\nIn England, the Royal House has a long tradition, dating back to\ncircumcised by the Jewish mohel of London. The tradition has\nnot been followed in recent decades, and the younger members\nof the British royalty have not been circumcised. (Kolatch,\nKolatch has now added the specification to Victoria, and\nthe qualification that the tradition has been abandoned \"in\nrecent decades.\" There is no mention of any belief in Davidic\nlineage or specifically of Diana and Princes William and\nHarry--though that is what is presumably meant by the ref-\nerence to the tradition having been abandoned. Again we can\nobserve the process by which a legend grows, as details aim-\ning to create verisimilitude are added: If a firm origin for the\ntradition can be cited, it adds to the credibility of the claim.\nThe question now becomes the source of Rabbi Kolatch's\ninformation. It may be that earlier published sources will\nturn up, but since this is (so far) the earliest sighting of the\nstory in print, we may provisionally conclude that he heard\nthe story or was informed of it by letter, possibly by Sifman,\nor by others with whom he had been in contact. Whatever the\nsource, the appearance of the story in a widely distributed\nbook facilitated its spread.\nIn this context, it is perhaps significant that the refer-\nence to Queen Victoria was not always on Professor\nMorris's website, but was added some time after March 3,\nsource was either Kolatch's book or Schoen's article, but\nsince the former does not mention the Davidic lineage and\nit is our impression that Morris had not seen Schoen's arti-\ncle until we drew it to his attention, it is more likely that it\nwas an internet source, such as the British page on Circlist.\ncom, a prominent pro-circumcision site. Although the cur-\nrent iteration of the site (August 2013) does not mention\nthis version of the tradition, it did so in considerable detail\nas early as 2004, as evidenced by a full text transcription of\nCirclist's then British page, published by the magazine of\nBrit-Am, a Zionist splinter group of the British-Israelite\nmovement (Brit-Am Now, 2004b). Among other novel\ndetails, the then Circlist page asserted that Prince William\nhad recently been circumcised \"at his request at a private\nsurgical clinic\" and that Charles's younger brothers had\nbeen circumcised by Snowman (a matter to which we shall\nreturn). The same magazine had two issues earlier pro-\nvided a link to the 1997 Schoen article (Brit-Am Now,\n2004a) as republished on the website of a well-known New\nYork mohel (Shoulson, n.d.). It is thus evident that\nSchoen's original article diffused rapidly among interested\nparties, further mutating as it spread.\n4 SAGE Open\nAs for Morris, he now states that he believes the story to\nbe no more than folklore, but that he is impressed by recent\nmedia reports that the tradition was initiated by George I. He\nhas foreshadowed further changes to the wording on his\nwebsite, confirming the malleability of these stories\n(B. Morris, personal communication, August 5, 2013b).\nQueen Victoria and Her Medical\nAdviser\nThe second version of the myth, recounted in the American\npregnancy manual, is most likely a garbled version of the\nfirst or a piece of creative reinvention on the part of the\nauthors, and thus not in need of any refutation. But let us take\nit seriously for a moment and see where it leads us. The doc-\ntor in question was presumably (Sir) James Clark (1788-\n1870), appointed as physician to the Duchess of Kent in\n1835, and who became Victoria's personal physician on her\naccession to the throne. He had indeed traveled, but accord-\ning to his entry in the Oxford Dictionary of Biography, only\nto France, Italy (where he practiced for several years in\nRome, and treated the dying poet Keats), and later in\nGermany. There is no mention of any trips to Africa or the\nMiddle East, and no suggestion that he had any interest in, or\nhad even heard of, circumcision. In reply to our request for a\nsource on the book's Facebook page, one of the authors\nreplied: \"I read about six books on circumcision history for\nthat little part (ugh!), likely it is from one of them\" (Jones,\n2013). Uncertainty over sources did not stop the same author\njoining the feeding frenzy that followed George's birth with\nthis July 23 tweet: \"Fun fact: British heirs to the throne have\nall been circumcised starting with Queen Victoria's sons, but\nDiana refused to circumcise William or Harry\" (Jones, 2013).\nGeorge I and the Hanoverians\nUnlike the stories about Queen Victoria having initiated a\ncircumcision tradition, recent assertions that the practice\noriginated with the Hanoverians can be documented quite\nexactly. The first appearance of the claim was on June 1,\n2012, when the Israeli newspaper Haaretz carried a feature\non the relationship between the royal family and British\nJewry that led off with the statement that Prince Charles had\nbeen circumcised by Snowman, and then continued:\nthe fact that the delicate act was performed upon the royal\nprinces by a Jewish practitioner, a custom dating back to George\nI, who brought it over from his native Hanover, has long been a\nsource of pride within the local community. (Pfeffer, 2012)\nThe apparent source for this claim was British historian\nand journalist Professor Geoffrey Alderman who, the article\nreveals, was also circumcised by Snowman.\nThis quite novel claim of Hanoverian origin for a royal\ncircumcision tradition would probably have slipped back\ninto well-deserved obscurity in the normal course of events;\nwhat brought it into prominence was the announcement of\nthe pregnancy of the Duchess of Cambridge some 6 months\nlater. Searching for a new angle on this momentous event,\nthe London Evening Standard dug up the Hanoverian origin\nand the Queen Victoria--Davidic lineage claims, and related\nthem sequentially as if they were seamlessly part of the same\nstory.\nThe so-called \"tradition\" only dates back to George I, who\nimported the custom from his native Hanover. Queen Victoria,\nconvinced that the British royal family was descended from\nKing David, had all her male offspring circumcised. The\ntradition continued through Edward VII, the Duke of Windsor\nand Prince Charles, who was circumcised by Rabbi Jacob\nSnowman at Buckingham Palace in 1948. His brothers Andrew\nand Edward were also circumcised. (Anonymous, 2012)\nThe toothpaste was now well and truly out of the tube:\nWhen the baby did in fact turn out to be a boy, there ensued\na tsunami of speculation about the fate of his foreskin, all\nasserting the existence of a \"tradition\" whose supposed ori-\ngin was either the Queen Victoria's beliefs about her ances-\ntry, or the Electors of Hanover or, in many cases, both.\nProfessor Alderman himself wrote an opinion piece for\nHaaretz on the occasion of the birth in which he asserted\nquite confidently: \"It was also thanks to the Hanoverians that\nthe custom arose of having royal sons circumcised by Jewish\nmohelim\" (Alderman, 2013c), though in subsequent corre-\nspondence with us he adopted a more guarded tone: \"This\npractice may have been introduced by George I, as I believe\nthe Electors of Hanover so practised\" (G. Alderman, per-\nsonal communication, August 4, 2013a; emphases added).\nWhen asked for the source of this belief, he did not refer to\nscholarly works or historical documents but to a private con-\nversation: \"I was told of the Hanoverians by the late\nDr. Cecil Roth (Bearsted Reader in Post-Biblical Jewish\nHistory at Oxford), who taught me there (Oxford) in the\nearly 1960s. I will try and track down a reference for you\"\n(G. Alderman, personal communication, August 5, 2013b).\nRoth (who died in 1970) was a distinguished scholar and\nauthor of numerous books on the history of the Jewish peo-\nple, especially in England, but his publications do not sug-\ngest that he had any special knowledge of the Hanoverians.\nAs editor of the Standard Jewish Encyclopedia (Roth, 1959),\nhe was in a position to ensure that this information was\nincluded in the entries for circumcision, or England, or\nHanover, but neither of the first two mention Snowman,\nVictoria or Prince Charles, and the last merely gives a brief\naccount of Jewish fortunes in that region (Roth, 1959). Nor is\nthere any mention of either the Queen Victoria or the George\nI stories in the vast Encyclopedia Judaica of which Roth was\neditor-in-chief, and for which he wrote the entry on Jewish\nlife in England (Roth, 1972). These silences could have sev-\neral explanations: Roth not believing such details to be\nDarby and Cozijn 5\nimportant enough to include, not feeling that they were suf-\nficiently documented, or lack of space; but the most likely\nexplanation is that the legend of a royal circumcision tradi-\ntion had not yet coalesced and that the Hanoverians did not\ncircumcise their sons.\nEven if Roth had told the young Geoffrey Alderman that\nthe Hanoverians did observe such a practice, a little reflec-\ntion would have brought out the improbability of the sugges-\ntion. The future George I was born in 1660; his father, the\nDuke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, was not elevated to the cov-\neted position of prince-elector until 1698 but died before the\nappointment became official. George I therefore became the\nfirst installed Elector of Hanover 15 years after the birth of\nhis first and only son, born in Hanover in 1683, the future\ncumcision, therefore, it is difficult to see how the \"Electors\nof Hanover so practiced,\" and on whom, before their arrival\nin England. As of this writing (September 15, 2013), despite\na considerable exchange of emails, Professor Alderman has\nnot produced any references for this improbable belief.\nGiven the marginal and often despised status of the Jews in\ncentral Europe until the emancipation of the 19th century, it\nappears incredible that a mohel or Jewish physician would\nhave been permitted to impose the distinctive mark of Jewish\nidentity on any Christian, let alone the members of a princely\nhouse; and if it was a practice among the Hanoverians we\nwould expect the fact to be better documented than a hazy\nrecollection of what an elderly don said in conversation some\n50 years ago. It seems extraordinary that a tenured professor\nof history should make such a specific and unambiguous\nempirical claim in public debate without having firm docu-\nmentary proof.\nThe Lost Tribes and Prophecy\nGiven their evident falsity, why are these stories so readily\nbelieved and so widely circulated? The answer lies partly in\ntheir prima facie plausibility; partly in the glamour of royalty\nand the popular obsession with celebrity; and partly in the\ncontroversial status of circumcision--a hot topic in contem-\nporary society. The factors giving the stories credibility were\n(a) the reported circumcision of Prince Charles in 1948 and,\nlying behind this, (b) the efforts of the British Israelites to\nconcoct an Israelite ancestry for the British race and a\nDavidic lineage for the royal family.\nTo take the second point first, the Queen Victoria story\ngrew out of the efforts of an assortment of unstable \"proph-\nets,\" culminating in the rise of the British Israelites as an\norganized religious-political movement, to prove that the\nBritish race was descended from the 10 lost tribes of Israel.\nThere is no detailed history of the British-Israel delusion,\nbut the major scholarly study by Tudor Parfitt traces the ori-\ngins of the movement to the misery that accompanied the\nearly Industrial Revolution, the breakdown of traditional\nagrarian society, and the Napoleonic wars (Parfitt, 2002).\nThe consequent rise of millenarian protest movements\nspawned many self-proclaimed prophets, including Richard\nlife and love; in his compensatory tract A Revealed\nKnowledge of the Prophecies and Times (Brothers, 1794), he\nasserted that the lost tribes of Israel had found their way to\nBritain, and that he himself was a direct descendant of the\nbiblical King David, via James I. (This treasonous assertion\nlanded him in a lunatic asylum for the next 20 years.)\nBrothers was followed by numerous imitators and would-\nbe cult leaders, such as Joanna Southcott, whose claim that\nshe was about to give birth to the Messiah drove the London\npress into a fever of excitement nearly as great in 1814 as the\nrecent obsession with the fate of Prince George's penis.\nBitter was the disappointment when she died without having\ngiven birth to anything. Then there was her disciple John\nWroe, a fanatical hunchback with pedophile tendencies\n(according to Parfitt), who founded an ascetic cult that\nadopted many Old Testament ritual practices, including\nobligatory circumcision of converts and children. In 1824,\none of his followers was charged with manslaughter after a\nboy whom he had circumcised in Bedford died from the\nhad always shown a strong Old Testament consciousness,\nand the Puritan sects, in particular, were fond of comparing\nthemselves with the Israelites held captive in Egypt. This\ndoes not mean that there was any widespread adoption of\npractices such as circumcision, but that biblical literalism,\nespecially in relation to the more apocalyptic passages of the\nOld Testament, was common currency.\nThe British Israelites and Queen\nVictoria\nThe text that the British Israelites came to regard as their\nfounding document was Our Israelitish Origin, by\nJohn Wilson, the unemployed son of an Irish weaver. This\nmade no mention of ritual observances such as circumcision,\nbut sought to show that the Saxons were descended from the\nlost tribes of Israel via certain Scythian peoples who had\nfound their way to north-west Europe (Wilson, 1840). Our\nIsraelitish Origin went through four editions in Wilson's life-\ntime and was quite widely read among the less educated sec-\ntors of the public, and with variations and additions it became\ncanonical, but it made no mention of any Davidic origin of\nthe British monarchy. This notion--that the British monar-\nchy was somehow descended directly from King David--\nwas not introduced until the 1860s, in England, the Remnant\nof Judah and the Israel of Ephraim: The Two Families Under\nconsulate in Cologne,\" Frederick Glover, and it was not until\nthe 1870s that the myth took its final, elaborated form in\nJ. C. Stevens' Genealogical Chart Showing the Connection\nbetween the House of David and the Royal Family of Britain\n(1877). Together with the wildly popular Twenty-Seven\n6 SAGE Open\nIdentifications of the British Nation With Lost Israel by\nRichard Hines (1871), these texts spurred the formation of\nthe British Israelites as an organized movement, with news-\nletters, offices, meetings, and branches in other Anglo coun-\ntries, including the United States.\nAlthough British-Israelism (BI) had quite a large follow-\ning in the late 19th and early 20th century, the movement was\nalways a fringe preoccupation, rather less respectable than\nscientology or belief in alien abductions today. The\nEstablishment held it in contempt, and the Church of England\n(of which the English monarch is Supreme Governor) pub-\nlished several condemnations of it as erroneous and even\nheretical (Goudge, 1934). None of this has prevented the\nmost popular form of the circumcision myth having as its\ncentral plank the claim that Queen Victoria was a convert to\nBI, and particularly to belief in the direct Davidic lineage of\nthe English monarchy; and further that she therefore circum-\ncised all her sons, starting with the future Edward VII (born\nThere are two immediate problems with these\npropositions:\n1. There is a conspicuous lack of evidence that Queen\nVictoria ever adhered to any form of British-\nIsraelism. Although she wrote about 2,500 words a\nday in her diaries throughout her adult life, purveyors\nof the story have been unable to come up with a sin-\ngle sentence in support of their claims. The fact that\none of her many granddaughters, Princess Alice,\nCountess of Athlone, agreed to be a patron of the\nmain BI organization when it consolidated in 1920\ntells us nothing about Victoria's own views. By that\ntime British-Israelism was associated with a range of\nEmpire unity movements, including Imperial\nFederation and efforts at closer ties between Britain\nand the United States--many of which had a White\nsupremacist and increasingly anti-Semitic flavor\n2. There is no evidence that Edward VII or his younger\nbrothers were circumcised as infants or at any time in\nlater life.\nBut we can go further than the mere absence of evidence.\nAlthough Wilson's founding text was published suggestively\nclose to Edward's birth, there are three fatal objections to\nmaking a link between these two events:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Wilson's \"theory\" rested on the proposition that \"peo-\nple of Israel\" now inhabiting northern Europe were\nnot Jews (whom he identified as the \"people of\nJudah\"), but Gentiles--who did not, therefore, follow\nJewish ritual observances. It was a racial, not a cul-\ntural, theory. Accordingly, it would have been as non-\nsensical for Europeans to adopt circumcision as it\nwould be for them to stop eating bacon or to refrain\nfrom work on Saturdays.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Wilson did not expound, or even mention, anything\nabout the Davidic lineage of the monarchy until the\nfifth edition, published posthumously in 1876. This\nidea was introduced in Glover's book, not published\nuntil 20 years after Edward's birth, and only became a\nBI tenet in subsequent decades. In other words, even\nif Victoria had fallen for the claim that she was\ndescended from King David, it could not have been\nuntil long after her child-bearing years, when all her\nmale children were grown up and beyond her reach.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Finally, there is the hemophilia factor--a rather\nimportant medico-scientific fact that the mythmakers\nentirely ignore. Victoria was a carrier of the fatal gene\n(Potts & Potts, 1995), and her fourth and last son\n(Leopold, born 1853) was hemophiliac. But since this\n6, he clearly could not have been circumcised as an\ninfant; if he had been, the hemophilia would have\nbeen discovered then. But if Leopold was not circum-\ncised it is highly unlikely that any of his brothers\nwere.\nThe inescapable conclusion is that Victoria did not sub-\nscribe to the myth of the royal family's descent from the\nHouse of David, and did not have her sons circumcised. That\ntenured professors at leading universities should repeat such\nstories without verification is unfortunate, but is perhaps evi-\ndence of how readily the admixture of blood rites and blood\nroyal can generate narrative. Although Morris presents the\nstory as an established fact, when first asked for a source he\nreplied, \"I am sorry to say I have no reliable publication on\nthis\" (B. Morris, personal communication, August 2, 2013c).\nIt is well known that Morris is a leading promoter of routine\ninfant circumcision as a \"biomedical imperative for the 21st\ncentury,\" and thus would be expected to have a certain inter-\nest in maximizing the extent of the practice (Frisch, 2012;\nMorris, 2007). Goldman's claims show all the signs of\nextreme carelessness:Amohel who could circumcise Edward\nVII (born 1841), the Duke of Windsor (i.e., his grandson,\nEdward the abdicated, born 1894), and Prince Charles (born\n1948) must have enjoyed remarkable longevity. Even so fer-\nvent a believer as Professor Morris has never suggested that\nthe benefits of circumcision include a biblical life span.\nThe Prince and the Snowman\nThe other factor giving the Victoria and the George I stories\ncredibility was the reported circumcision of Prince Charles\nby Dr. Jacob Snowman in December 1948. Although the\nbest-known evidence for this is an unsourced statement in\nAnthony Holden's biography (Holden, 1979), it has not been\nseriously questioned, and may be taken as fact.1 Charles thus\nremains the only Royal for whom we have reliable evidence\nof circumcision,2 but if he was circumcised it is possible that\nhis grandfather and great uncles (George VI, Edward VIII,\nand the other sons of George V) were also done, and\nDarby and Cozijn 7\nconceivably some lesser royals and aristocrats, as reported\nby Dr. Sifman. Although it did not reach its peak of popular-\nity until the 1920s, circumcision was coming into vogue\namong the middle classes and those aspiring to middle class\nrespectability during the Edwardian period, and it is possible\nthat the royal doctors recommended the operation as the lat-\nest medical advance available to the rich, assuring the anx-\nious parents that it was a sure preventive of such feared\nproblems as masturbation, phimosis, syphilis, and cancer.\nBut British doctors were not, on the whole, strongly in favor\nof routine circumcision, often lacked confidence in their\nability to perform the surgery, and sometimes recommended\nthe traditional Jewish method as safer and neater than any-\nthing a GP or surgeon could manage (Darby, 2005). In such\ncircumstances, an experienced mohel might well have been\nseen as the first choice of a rich and well-connected parent. If\nthese operations were performed by mohelim who were also\nleading physicians, that might explain why the palace called\nreputation extended beyond the Jewish community and\nreports, as a matter of pride, that \"he was called upon for\nthe circumcision of members of the Royal Family and per-\nformed the operation on Prince Charles\" (Anonymous,\n1959). But the fact that Charles was circumcised tells us\nnothing about the fate of his own sons, and most commen-\ntators agree (either sadly or gleefully, depending on their\nperspective) that William and Harry were spared. It is often\nstated (e.g., by the Evening Standard article referenced\nabove) that Charles's brothers (Andrew, born 1960, and\nEdward, born 1964) were also circumcised; if so, it was not\nUrban Legends, Myths, and Factoids\nAlthough the myth of the royal family's circumcision tradi-\ntion is of recent invention, the process by which the narra-\ntives developed will be better understood if we briefly\nconsider the differing shades of meaning conveyed by the\nterms urban myth, urban legend, contemporary legend and\nfactoid. Following Jan Brunvand (1981), Wikipedia usefully\nsummarizes an urban legend, urban myth, urban tale, or con-\ntemporary legend as\na form of modern folklore consisting of stories that may or\nmay not have been believed by their tellers to be true. As with\nall folklore and mythology, the designation suggests nothing\nabout the story's veracity, but merely that it is in circulation,\nexhibits variation over time, and carries some significance that\nmotivates the community in preserving and propagating it.\nSuch stories usually emerge through oral transmission\nand can rarely be traced to an original source. Brunvand\nnotes that such items of folklore retain a central core yet\nconstantly change as they are transmitted, thus creating\nnumerous variants that differ in length, detail, and style. He\nprefers to call modern stories of this type legends rather than\nmyth so as to indicate that they involve real people rather\nthan gods or monsters, are widely believed (or are at least\nbelievable), and that they thus represent a kind of \"quasi-\nhistory.\" Tales with relatively recent or modern origins now\ntend to be referred to as contemporary legends (D\u00e9gh, 1991;\nSimpson, 1998). Significantly for our purposes, Brunvand\n(1981) points out that in order to flourish, such stories \"must\nfill some genuine need,\" such as \"an entertaining escape\nfrom reality, or a desire to validate by anecdotal examples\nsome of the culture's ideals and institutions\" (pp. 3-12). Both\nthese needs were met by the story of the royal family's cir-\ncumcision habit.\nA factoid is a questionable or spurious (unverified, false,\nor fabricated) statement presented as a fact, but without sup-\nporting evidence. The Oxford English Dictionary defines\nfactoid as \"something that becomes accepted as a fact,\nalthough it is not (or may not be) true; spec. an assumption or\nspeculation reported and repeated so often that it is popularly\nconsidered true; a simulated or imagined fact,\" and refers to\nNorman Mailer's definition in his biography of Marilyn\nMonroe: \"facts which have no existence before appearing in\na magazine or newspaper, creations which are not so much\nlies as a product to manipulate emotion in the Silent\nMajority.\" A number of such factoids have been collected by\nmedical historian Lesley Hall, such as the Victorian mother's\nadvice on her daughter's wedding night: \"Just lie back, dear,\nand think of England (or Britain),\" variously attributed to a\n(nonexistent) Lady Hillingham or to Queen Victoria herself,\nand supposedly emblematic of Victorian attitudes to sex\n(Hall, n.d.). An even more relevant example is the story that\na style of penis piercing/infibulation known as a Prince\nAlbert was so named because Prince Albert had one, either\nbecause he wanted to hide the bulge in his trousers or (even\nless plausibly) because Queen Victoria did not like his penis\nand (by some twisted logic) imagined that such an installa-\ntion would make it less noticeable. It is now accepted that the\nterm was invented by Doug Molloy, a Californian body arts\nIt may now be seen that the royal family's \"circumcision\ntradition\" exhibits all the characteristics of a classic urban\nmyth or legend: absence of evidence, uncertain origin, varia-\ntion on a set of basic themes, change over time and signifi-\ncance to those who circulate it. Not being anchored in\nevidence or any factual base, the story is free to grow and\nmutate as the fancy of its numerous re-tellers dictates; in the\nage of social media and the blogosphere, their capacity for\nrapid evolution is vastly enhanced. The discrete elements\n(such as Queen Victoria believing herself to be descended\nfrom King David; or that the Electors of Hanover circum-\ncised their sons) may be regarded as factoids, while the\nmutating narrative as a whole may be seen as a contemporary\nlegend. A perfect example is provided in the explanation for\n8 SAGE Open\nthe sudden surge of interest in Prince George's penis given in\nan interview by royal watcher and editor of the Kensington\n& Chelsea Review, Coco Khan, to an enthralled American\naudience:\nIt's actually a little bit of a sort of a falsity that's going around.\nI mean they haven't been circumcising very long, it's only been,\nit's a tradition that's about 150 years old, and by British standards\n150 years old isn't a tradition. It started with George I, who,\nwell, he started it off, and then it was carried on by Victoria, who\nwas obviously one of our most influential monarchs, and she\nbasically got it into her head that her children were the sons of\nDavid. So, I'm not entirely sure she made that decision in, you\nknow, out of a sense of science, but that was carried on and then\nDiana put a stop to it. So it's very unlikely we're going to be\nseeing it [a circumcision] this time around. (Khan, 2013)\nThe key elements of the story are here, embedded in the\nusual anecdotal style (well, you know, basically, etc.), and\ncombined with a striking absence of evidence and a very\nhazy sense of history: 150 years would take us back to the\n1860s and the middle of Victoria's long reign (but well after\nthe birth of her last male child, Prince Leopold, in 1853). As\nfor George I, he was born in 1660 and ascended to the English\ndent fascination with the story expresses their obsession with\ncircumcision and the glamour that the English monarchy\nholds for their ritual-hungry public and their increasingly\ndynastic political elite (Kelley, 1997).\nEvolution of a Contemporary Legend\nWe are now in a position to see how the Queen Victoria leg-\nend emerged and grew. The core of fact around which it\naccreted was Snowman's circumcision of Prince Charles and\npossibly some other members of the royal family, identities\nunknown; the rest is creative inflation, deriving largely from\nstories told and transmitted informally among elite members\nof the Jewish community, beginning with Snowman himself.\nAs Alderman commented, the Jewish community in England\nhas always taken considerable pride in Snowman's royal\nrole, and it is natural that some might wish to give it a deeper\nhistorical pedigree. It is perhaps significant that Alderman\nand Harry Wallop, writing in the Daily Telegraph (Wallop,\n2013), felt moved to mention, and were evidently proud of,\nthe fact that they, too, were circumcised by the same operator\nwho had done the future Prince of Wales. In the immediate\naftermath of this notable procedure, however, there was\nnothing in print and probably nothing in writing about a \"tra-\ndition.\" Yet Snowman must have been pleased about the\nroyal patronage and did not keep it secret; he told his friends\nand associates, they told their friends, and as the information\npassed by word of mouth or personal letter, the message\nbecame distorted, details were added, and exaggeration\noccurred. After Snowman's death in 1959, the story\ncirculated for about 20 years within the Anglo-American\nJewish communities before emerging in print, in Kolatch's\nbook of 1981--ample gestation time for one mohel's cir-\ncumcision of a few royals to become \"a long tradition requir-\ning that all royal male children be circumcised by the Jewish\nmohel of London.\" A few years later, following the birth of\nPrinces William and Harry, but without any explanation, the\ntradition is sourced to Queen Victoria--possibly because the\nauthor has a dim awareness of the British Israelite contribu-\ntion, or perhaps for no reason other than a desire to give the\nstory more depth and thus credibility. By the 1980s, it was\nreceived wisdom that the Victorian age was antisex, and well\nknown that late 19th century doctors favored circumcision\nas a means of discouraging masturbation (Darby, 2005,\nchap. 9). That being the case, it might be thought natural that\nVictoria had also favored it back in the 1840s.\nYet even by 1995, circulation of the story is still fairly\nlimited, largely confined to Jewish circles; the bridge from\nthere to the wider society is provided by Edgar Schoen, first\nin his 1997 article, and for a broader audience in his book on\ncircumcision published in 2005. Once Schoen had put the\nnew amalgam into print, the stories spread fast, for he was a\nprolific contributor to medical and other journals, and promi-\nnent asAmerica's most determined advocate of routine infant\ncircumcision. In addition, we had arrived at the age of the\ninternet, meaning that information was now disseminated\nmore rapidly and more widely than ever before. As soon as\nthe story appeared on websites, it was there for journalists,\nop-ed writers, and anybody else using search engines to find,\nand without anyone taking the trouble to investigate, it\nbecame accepted as a historical truth. It is unclear who first\nconjured up the motivation for Victoria's \"decision\" in the\nform of an illusory belief in her Davidic lineage, except that\nthe first published sighting is Schoen's 1997 article and, as\nhe said in his correspondence with us, \"it makes sense to\nme.\"\nConclusion\nIt is thus clear that there is no tradition of circumcision\namong the British royal family. If Prince Charles and the\nsons of George V were circumcised, it was not because\nVictoria believed herself descended from King David, and\ncertainly not because a family circumcision tradition was\nintroduced by George I. If Snowman or another practitioner\nperformed the operation on them it was because circumci-\nsion was a common practice among the British middle and\nmended as a sensible hygienic precaution, and the monarchy\nwas following middle class fashion and the prevailing medi-\ncal wisdom. That the palace doctors were able to call upon\nthe services of so distinguished a surgeon is not evidence of\nany tradition, but simply another instance of the royal fami-\nly's privileged status.\nDarby and Cozijn 9\nNotes\n1. In support of Holden's account, there is a press report from\n1948 reproduced on several websites, which reads as fol-\nlows: \"London (JTA)--Crown Prince Charles, son of Princess\nElizabeth and heir to the British throne, was circumcised in\nBuckingham Palace by Rev. Jacob Snowman, official Mohel\nof the London Jewish community, the Mizrachi News Bureau\nreported. Rev. Snowman, who is a noted Jewish scholar spe-\ncializing in the poetry of Bialik, has been ritual circumciser\nin London for many years\" (I. J. Barzak, personal commu-\nnication, n.d.). The Jewish Telegraphic Agency is unable to\nascertain in which newspapers this dispatch appeared, but the\nconsensus is that it appears to be authentic (A. Soclof, personal\n2.
