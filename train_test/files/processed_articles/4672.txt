In light of the benefits of parent involvement, policies\nto close the achievement gap have required school systems to\ndevelop comprehensive parent involvement and family\u00ad\nschool partnership strategies (e.g., \"No Child Left Behind\nAct,\" 2002). Educators face unique challenges in their efforts\nto increase parent involvement as children transition from\nelementary to middle school. Compared with elementary\nschools, middle schools are both larger with respect to their\nphysical size and their student body, and parents must inter-\nact with an increased number of teachers to stay abreast of\ntheir adolescents' academic progress. These more imper-\nsonal school environments may present difficulties to par-\nents as they attempt to develop new relationships and to\nunderstand how to be involved (Hill &Tyson, 2009; Seidman,\nLambert, Allen, & Aber, 2003). Furthermore, young adoles-\ncents may discourage particular parent involvement activi-\nties when they perceive the activity as diminishing their\nautonomy (Stevenson & Baker, 1987). In addition, this is the\nage at which there are changes in both adolescents' and par-\nents' beliefs about the boundaries of parental authority,\nwhich then leads adolescents to engage their parents less and\nparents to decrease their engagement with their children\nThe impact of school and developmental transitions on par-\nent involvement is compounded by a multitude of school and\nparent factors that serve as barriers to middle school parent\ninvolvement (e.g., Eccles & Harold, 1993; Gonzalez-DeHass\nlow incomes and low educational attainment face consider-\nable parent involvement barriers (Halle, Kurtz-Costes, &\nWilliams & Sanchez, 2013), and may experience these barri-\ners to a greater extent than more advantaged parents or White\nparents do (Frew, Zhou, Duran, Kwok, & Benz, 2012; Griffith,\n1998). In the current study, we identify barriers to middle\nschool parent involvement among a sample of predominately\nAfrican American parents with low incomes and low levels of\neducational attainment whose children attend urban public\nmiddle schools. We also identify facilitators to parent involve-\nment in middle school, factors that have been examined in\n1Annie E.

Murray1, Nadine Finigan-Carr2, Vanya Jones3,\nNikeea Copeland-Linder4, Denise L. Haynie5, and\n Keywords\nparent participation, middle schools, urban, violence\n2 SAGE Open\nonly a handful of studies on African American parent involve-\nment (e.g., Archer-Banks & Behar-Horenstein, 2008).\nWhat Is Parent Involvement?\nParent involvement represents parents' commitment of\nresources and time to the academic sphere of their children's\nlives. Epstein (1995) identified six forms of parent involve-\nment: (a) establishing home environments that support learn-\ning, (b) facilitating effective communication between school\nand home, (c) helping the school and supporting students, (d)\nlearning at home, (e) participating in school decision-making\nprocesses, and (f) working with other stakeholders (i.e., stu-\ndents, school staff, community) to strengthen the school.\nScholars usually group these parent involvement activities\ninto two broad categories: home-based parent involvement\nand school-based parent involvement (SBPI; Deplanty,\nCoulter-Kern, & Duchane, 2007; Deslandes & Bertrand,\nparent involvement includes practices related to children's\neducation that take place outside of the school, usually within\nthe home. These practices may be directly related to school-\nwork, including assisting with homework, responding to\nchildren's academic choices, and talking about academic\nissues (Eccles & Harold, 1993). SBPI occurs when parents\nactually make contact with the school and includes partici-\npating in general school meetings, communicating with\nteachers and administrators, attending school events, and\nvolunteering at the school (Herrold & O'Donnell, 2008).\nResearchers have also proposed that parents'positive atti-\ntudes about education and their communication of expecta-\ntions concerning academic achievement to their children\nrepresent additional components of parent involvement\nand Tyson (2009) identified academic socialization as a form\nof parent involvement examined in the literature. Academic\nsocialization includes parenting practices such as communi-\ncation of expectations about educational attainment, cultivat-\ning academic and career aspirations, connecting schoolwork\nand current events, and discussing learning techniques with\nchildren (Hill & Tyson, 2009). In their meta-analysis on the\nextant research on middle school parent involvement, Hill\nand Tyson (2009) found that, although academic socializa-\ntion was the strongest predictor of academic success, SBPI\nhas also been associated with academic achievement and\nother measures of doing well in school. However, the bene-\nfits of these forms of parent involvement may not be widely\nrealized in the middle school years. As mentioned previ-\nously, parent involvement declines in middle school (Herrold\n& O'Donnell, 2008) compared with elementary school, per-\nhaps due to diminished opportunities (Dauber & Epstein,\ntion of barriers and facilitators to parent involvement pres-\nents an opportunity to inform the development of strategies\nto increase middle school parental engagement, particularly\namong populations at greatest risk for low involvement.\nIdentifying Barriers and Facilitators to\nParent Involvement\nCentral to the identification of barriers and facilitators is a\nfocus on factors that influence parents' decisions to engage\nin parent involvement. The Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler\nmodel of the parent involvement process (Hoover-Dempsey,\nWalker, Wilkins, Dallaire, Sandler, & Hoover-Dempsey,\n2005) describes the specific processes that influence parents'\ndecisions to engage in parent involvement. This model of\nparent involvement process also explicates how they contrib-\nute to the forms of parent involvement implemented and to\nchild outcomes. The current study focuses on the first two\nlevels of this model, which describe the processes that influ-\nence parents' decisions to engage in parent involvement and\nhow parents become involved (i.e., the forms of parent\ninvolvement). Hoover-Dempsey and colleagues posit that\nparents' decisions to engage in parent involvement are influ-\nenced by three motivational factors: (a) motivational beliefs,\n(b) parents' perceptions of invitations to become involved,\nand (c) parents'personal life context. We organize the review\nof the literature on barriers and facilitators to parent involve-\nment by these three motivational factors.\nEvidence suggests that African American parents, espe-\ncially those of lower socioeconomic status (SES), may expe-\nrience greater barriers to parent involvement than more\nadvantaged parents or White parents do (e.g., Griffith, 1998).\nThis highlights the salience of race as a potential factor shap-\ning parent involvement. Thus, the literature review addition-\nally identifies studies regarding how parents' perceptions of\nracism may influence motivational factors for parent involve-\nment. This inclusion of studies related to parents' experi-\nences with and perceptions of racism in the schools is in line\nwith Critical Race Theory (CRT; Delgado & Stefancic,\n2001), which has as a central tenet the notion that racism is\nendemic to American society. CRT has been used to analyze\naspects of education such as instruction and curriculum\nthrough a lens that recognizes the pervasiveness of racism in\nschools and seeks to understand how racism shapes school\npolicies and practices (Ladson-Billings, 1998).\nMotivational Beliefs\nMotivational beliefs are first determined by parental role\nconstruction or parents' attitudes and beliefs about their role\nas a parent in fostering their child's educational success\nrole construction represents parents' beliefs about what they\nshould do regarding parent involvement (Hoover-Dempsey\nparental role construction is an important motivational factor\nfor parents of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds (see\nHoover-Dempsey et al., 2005, for a review). Other motiva-\ntional factors are thought to translate into the parent's taking\naction to become involved. This is particularly true of the\nMurray et al. 3\nsecond motivational belief: parents' self-efficacy. This refers\nto parents' belief that they are capable of helping their child\nachieve in school (Hoover-Dempsey et al., 2005, Walker et\nal., 2005). Parents' self-efficacy for involvement may be a\nbarrier to parents of low SES. For example, parents of lim-\nited educational backgrounds may lack the confidence to\ninteract with teachers and navigate the school (Kim, 2009;\nKoonce & Harper, 2005). For low-income African American\nparents, perceptions of racism as well as their own negative\nschool experiences may shape their self-efficacy and serve to\ndistance them from schools (Van Velsor & Orozco, 2007).\nPerceptions of Invitations to Become\nInvolved\nParents' perceptions of invitations to become involved\ninclude specific invitations from the child. Child invitations\nfor involvement may be both explicit (e.g., child asking par-\nent to help with a fund-raiser) or implicit (e.g., parent\nobserves that her child is struggling with a class and talks\nwith the teacher; Walker et al., 2005). Invitations may also\noriginate from the school through specific teacher invitations\n(e.g., teacher invites the parent to volunteer in a classroom)\nand general invitations for involvement from the school\n(Walker et al., 2005). There is evidence that some teachers\nmay not invite parent involvement because of their frustra-\ntion with low-achieving, low SES students (Eccles & Harold,\nfamily as the source of their students' achievement problems\nings include teachers' negative perceptions about the effi-\ncacy and capacity of low-income parents and teachers'\nbeliefs in the effectiveness of parental involvement with this\npopulation (Kim, 2009). Parents are more likely to partici-\npate in school activities when they feel empowered by their\ninteractions with the school staff (Baker, 1997). However,\npower differentials related to educational achievement and\nprofessional expertise may lead to unequal relationships\nbetween parents and school staff, thereby marginalizing low-\nincome parents instead of empowering them (Barton, Drake,\nAfrican American parents' lack of confidence in their skills\nand capacity to interact with teachers (Lareau & Shumar,\n1996) and perceptions of racism may further distance them\nfrom the schools even when invitations to the school are\nGeneral invitations for involvement from the school relate\nto the general atmosphere or climate of the school (Walker\net al., 2005). Establishing a welcoming school climate and\neffectively publicizing school events to parents are examples\nof ways schools invite parental involvement (Green, Walker,\nHoover-Dempsey, & Sandler, 2007; Hoover-Dempsey &\nSandler, 1997). For African American parents, a positive\nschool climate is an important component of general school\ninvitations for involvement. In a qualitative study of African\nAmerican parents, Archer-Banks and Behar-Horenstein\n(2008) found that, although parents viewed parent involve-\nment as important, the school environment (particularly\nschool personnel's expectations, practices, and policies)\ninfluenced their level of involvement. In addition, research\nsuggests a responsive middle school environment could\neliminate barriers existing between middle schools and\nAfrican American parents (e.g., teacher's low expectations\nfor children's academic potential and parental involvement;\nArcher-Banks and Behar-Horenstein, 2008; Overstreet,\nSchool violence is one dimension of school climate that\nhas particular relevance to parents whose children attend\npublic schools in urban communities. Urban schools have\nbeen shown to have higher levels of violent incidents in\nschools compared with suburban and rural schools (Neiman,\nschool violence and parent involvement have not been\nwidely examined, existing evidence suggests that school\nsafety is associated with greater levels of parent involvement\n(Griffith, 1998; Kandakai, Price, Telljohann, & Wilson,\n1999). School violence as a factor influencing parent involve-\nment has broad implications because school violence is a\nnational problem (Schonfeld, 2006). According to the most\nrecent published findings of the national School Survey on\nCrime and Safety, approximately 73% of schools reported at\nschool year (Neiman, 2011). Moreover, both the percentage\nof schools reporting student bullying daily or at least once a\nweek and the rate of violent incidents was higher for middle\nschools than for elementary and high schools (Neiman,\n2011). Examining the extent to which school violence, con-\nceptualized as a specific component of the school climate,\nhinders or fosters parent involvement will add to the knowl-\nedge base regarding the role of school invitations in motivat-\ning parent involvement.\nPersonal Life Context\nPersonal life context refers to parents' skills and knowledge\nand the perceived time and energy parents can expend to\nbecome involved (Walker et al., 2005). Research suggests\nthat the personal life context of low SES parents may present\na plethora of barriers to parent involvement. For example,\nparents with low educational attainment may lack the requi-\nsite sets of skills and knowledge to assist their children with\nassignments especially beyond the elementary school grades\n(Trotman, 2001). Work often serves as a barrier for low-\nincome parents to devote time to attend school meetings,\nvolunteer at the school, or participate in other parent involve-\nment activities (Mannan & Blackwell, 1992; Van Velsor &\nOrozco, 2007). Although work affects the ability of parents\nto participate in SBPI activities regardless of income group,\nwork barriers differentially affect low-income parents. Low-\nincome parents are more likely to have inflexible work\n4 SAGE Open\nschedules, multiple jobs, and/or positions without paid leave\nbenefits (Mannan & Blackwell, 1992; Van Velsor & Orozco,\nLimited resources, such as lack of transportation, have\nalso been shown to hinder SBPI (Reglin, King, Losike-\nLimited resources, moreover, hinder low-income parents'\nability to address the basic needs of children and other rela-\ntives with special needs (e.g., old parents) contributing to\nfurther time constraints that negatively affect low-income\nparents' involvement (Baker, 1997). In addition to financial\nand time constraint barriers, low-income parents may also\nexperience psychological barriers. For example, low-income\nparents who struggle to provide for their families' basic\nneeds may experience negative mental health effects includ-\ning depression, which may limit parents' capacity to engage\nin school activities (Van Velsor & Orozco, 2007).\nThe Present Study\nThe purpose of this study was to explore barriers and facilita-\ntors to SBPI in a sample of predominately African American\nparents living in low-income urban communities whose chil-\ndren attend public middle schools. One of the goals of this\nqualitative study was to understand parental school engage-\nment in an effort to inform parent\u00adschool collaboration\nefforts. We used the Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler model of\nparent involvement processes as an organizing framework to\nunderstand how barriers inhibit and facilitators foster par-\nents' motivation for involvement. In previous studies,\nresearchers have largely relied on teachers and administra-\ntors to identify barriers and solutions to improving educa-\ntional outcomes through enhanced parent involvement\nhandful of studies have examined the viewpoint of parents\n(e.g., Williams & Sanchez, 2013). This study contributes to\nthe literature by examining the perspectives of parents and\nother caregivers who are predominately African American\nand reside in urban, low-income communities.\nMethod\nParticipants\ntructured interviews with parents who previously consented\ntigation testing the impact of a violence prevention curricu-\nlum on early adolescent aggressive behaviors at three public\nmiddle schools in Baltimore City. In the academic school\nyear prior to this study, two of the three participating schools\nwere on probation for the federal designation of \"persistently\ndangerous,\" a label based on the numbers of student expul-\nsions and suspensions for violent offenses (Maryland State\nDepartment of Education, 2007b). These two schools are\nalso located in communities characterized by poor indicators\nof child health and safety including substantial numbers of\njuvenile arrests (Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators\nAlliance, 2014).All three schools served significant numbers\nof low-income students; between 75% and 89% of students\nqualified for free or reduced-cost school lunch during the\nEducation, 2006). Although data regarding the race/ethnicity\nof personnel at each school are unavailable, system-level\ndata indicate that 59.7% of Baltimore City Public School\nteachers were African American, 35.6% were White, and\nyear (Maryland State Department of Education, 2007a).\nThe original child eligibility criteria included (a) first-\ntime sixth grader and (b) not in self-contained special educa-\ntion classes. The children of participants in the qualitative\nstudy were either in the seventh grade (enrolled in the prior\nyear) or sixth grade (enrolled in the current year) and were\nstill participating in the Steppin'Up study's follow-up assess-\npation rate) consented to participate in the larger Steppin'Up\nstudy at the time of the qualitative study. The Institutional\nReview Boards of the Johns Hopkins University and the\nNational Institute of Child Health and Human Development\n(NICHD) and the city school district review board approved\nthis study.\nRecruitment for the qualitative study was targeted to par-\nents of seventh graders at one school (first cohort) and par-\nents of sixth graders at all three schools (second cohort; N =\n381). Using a randomized contact list, staff contacted parents\nthrough a combination of telephone calls and letters. Blocks\nof 10 parents at a time were contacted until the recruitment\ngoal was met. When staff documented 10 consecutive unan-\nswered phone calls, a visit was made to the parent's home. If\nno one answered the door, a postcard was left with instruc-\ntions on how to contact staff. Parents had to be English\nspeaking to participate. Fifty-one parents were reached and\nasked to participate. A total of 44 parents agreed to partici-\npate (30 mothers, 5 fathers, and 9 other caregivers, including\ngrandmothers and aunts). Although the contact list was ran-\ndomized, the 44 participants represent individuals who self-\nselected to participate. A little more than one half were\nparents of sixth graders (n = 23), and the remaining\nwere parents of seventh graders (n = 21). On average, parents\nwere 41 years of age. The sample was predominately African\nAmerican (n = 39), followed by White (n = 2), Latino (n = 1),\nPacific Islander/Native Hawaiian (n = 1), and Other (n = 1).\nMost participants (63%) had a high school diploma/GED or\nyear.\nData Collection\nThree interviewers were researchers with prior experience\nconducting semistructured interviews, and the fourth inter-\nviewer was a postbaccalaureate research intern with some\nMurray et al. 5\nprior research experience. Prior to fielding, the two most\nexperienced interviewers led a 2-hr training on the protocol\nand interview techniques. Researchers alternated roles as\ninterviewer and notetaker, with the two most experienced\nresearchers conducting the initial interviews to facilitate\ntraining. Continued supervision and weekly meetings\nbetween interviewers and senior staff ensured interview pro-\ntocol adherence.\nResearchers developed a semistructured interview guide\nto examine aims associated with the larger adolescent aggres-\nsion study and, to a lesser extent, secondary aims associated\nwith the current parent involvement study. Using this inter-\nview guide, researchers asked parents to discuss their views\nabout violence, what they communicate to their children\nabout violence and fighting, and what parents, schools, and\ncommunities can do to keep their children safe. Parents were\nalso asked a series of questions about their current involve-\nment in their child's education and school. The interview\nguides were pilot tested with three parents recruited to the\nSteppin'Up study. All interviews were digitally recorded and\nthe notetaker wrote down participant responses, capturing\nimpressions from body language as well as providing a\nbackup data collection measure. The interviewer and\nnotetaker met following the interview to debrief and com-\nplete a field interview observation form. Although the major-\nity of interviews were held in parents'homes, a small number\nof parents requested their interview take place at a commu-\nnity location (i.e., a private room at the child's school). The\ninterviews lasted about 1 hr and parents were provided finan-\ncial remuneration for their time.\nData Analysis\nWe compared the transcribed and recorded interviews for\naccuracy and completeness. Parent interview transcript files\nwere uploaded into hyperRESEARCH 2.7\n(HyperRESEARCH, 2009). We used a grounded theory\napproach for data coding (Strauss & Corbin, 1998). These\ndata were coded by looking for themes that emerged from\nparticipants' statements. A team of three researchers identi-\nfied themes using the first 12 transcribed parent interviews.\nFirst, an experienced primary coder (D.H.) with expertise in\nqualitative research methodology open coded and consulted\nwith two experienced qualitative coders Vanya Jones (V.J.)\nand Nikeea Copeland-Linder (N.C.). A coding manual was\ndeveloped based on the initial 12 interviews and modified as\nsubsequent interviews were coded. Each new idea generated\na code; similar codes were grouped by themes. The experi-\nenced primary coder Denise L. Haynie (D.H.) trained three\npostbaccalaureate research interns and a doctoral student\n[Kimberly Chambers (K.C.), Amanda McEnery (A.M.),\nElizabeth Noelcke (E.N.), Kantahyanee Murray (K.M.)], and\nall five individuals coded the transcripts. We utilized a dou-\nble coding approach for each transcript to improve reliabil-\nity. Two coders were responsible for coding a transcript and\nthen meeting to compare every instance of coded text. The\ntwo coders achieved consensus on all instances of coding\ndiscrepancies by discussing the merits of the codes selected.\nWhen coders could not agree on the appropriate code for a\nparticular text, these instances of text were noted and dis-\ncussed in coding progress meetings led by the experienced\nprimary coder (D.H.) who resolved all coding disagreements.\nCodes relevant to parent involvement in the child's educa-\ntion were examined in the current study. The overarching\nthemes represented by these codes are shown in Table 1. The\nHoover-Dempsey and Sandler model of parent involvement\nprocesses was applied to the themes as an organizing\nframework.\nResults\nThemes related to the three motivational factors for parent\ninvolvement proposed in the Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler\nmodel of parent involvement processes are described in the\nfollowing sections. The three motivational factors are\n(a) parents' motivational beliefs, (b) parents' perceptions of\ninvitations for involvement from others, and (c) parents' per-\nceived life context. First, we provide a description of the\nthemes related to parents' motivational beliefs. Next, we\norganize the remaining themes that describe parents' percep-\ntions of invitations for involvement from others and parents'\nperceived life context under two sections: facilitators and\nbarriers. Some themes included both facilitators and barriers.\nWe organized these themes in the barriers section because\nthe findings were predominately those that described imped-\niments to engagement in SBPI.\nParents' Motivational Beliefs\nParental role construction.Nearly all parents indicated that\nbeing involved in their child's school was an important role\nthat parents should play in their child's education. The fol-\nlowing parent's statement exemplifies this attitude:\n[Parents] certainly play the most important role [in their\nchildren's education], I think. And, we should always be active\nin everything that's going on with them more than just checking\nhomework and just making sure that the homework is done.\nVolunteering (e.g., aiding teachers in the classroom and\nchaperoning field trips) and attending PTAand similar school\nmeetings were frequently mentioned as SBPI activities that\nparents should be a part of at their child's school. However,\nthe majority of parents reported low levels of actual engage-\nment in volunteering and attending school meetings. One\nmother explained, \"Every so often I've been to a PTA meet-\ning or two. And I've spoken to my child's teacher once or\ntwice. But not as often as I think it should be, as often as I\nwould like to be\" (Mother, age 48).\n6 SAGE Open\nNearly three quarters of parents discussed the importance\nof supervising their child's academic progress and social\nbehavior. For some parents, this belief translated into SBPI\npractices. For example, one third of parents reported going to\nthe school to check up on their child. This involved observ-\ning their child in the classroom or other locations in the\nschool (e.g., lunchroom or cafeteria).\nI'll go up to the school to check his progress. I will peek in on\nhim, even if I don't let him see me. I will always talk to the\nteachers, but I just peek my head in to make sure he's sitting\ndown at his desk. (Mother, age 30)\nIn addition to motivational beliefs, parental involvement\npractices are also influenced by child invitations for involve-\nment, teacher invitations for involvement, general school\ninvitations for involvement, and parents' perceived life con-\ntext. In the next two sections, we describe the facilitators and\nbarriers related to these components of the parent involve-\nment process model.\nFacilitators\nChild invitations for involvement. Child invitations for involve-\nment are one way that parents perceive they are invited to\nbecome involved. In this sample, explicit and implicit child\ninvitations for involvement contributed to parent engage-\nment in SBPI. For example, three parents mentioned visiting\nthe school to follow-up on their child's claim that a teacher\nwas treating them inappropriately (e.g., unfair punishment or\nharsh reprimands).\nIf he saying he's having trouble with a teacher, I want to see for\nmyself, how does that teacher come across to me when I'm\ntalking to him or her. So that would be one reason I would go up\n[to the school]. (Grandmother, age 61)\nFive parents indicated implicit child invitations for\ninvolvement that involved initiating communication with\nteachers to address problems related to their child's academic\nprogress or behavioral problems. One grandmother described\ntalking with teachers about her child's conflict with another\nstudent at the school:\nI went down to [the school], but they weren't for pleasant\nreasons. I went down there because I tried to avoid--you know,\nI could see an incident blowing up, blowing up with [my\ndaughter] and the girls down there. I went down there to talk to\nthe teacher about it. (Grandmother, age 66)\nTeacher-specific invitations for involvement and general\nschool invitations for involvement are the other ways parents\nperceive they are invited to become involved. In this sample,\nthe themes that emerged for these two components of the\nparent involvement process model represented barriers to\nparent involvement.\nBarriers\nTeacher-specific invitations for involvement.Teacher invita-\ntions for involvement were infrequently mentioned. When\nteacher invitations for involvement were extended, they\nwere generally to address the child's disruptive behavior\nproblems. One parent described her perception that teacher\ninvitations for involvement were both rare and behavior-\nproblem focused:\nYou've got to talk to these teachers. Just be involved. Because a\nlot of the times, teachers don't even--if your child does not have\na behavior problem, but they could still be in the class not doing\nwhat they're supposed to do, you won't get a phone call. The\nonly time they give you phone calls is if it's a behavior problem\nthat's affecting them. (Mother, age 26)\nTable 1. Overarching Themes Relevant to School-Based Parent Involvement Examined in the Current Study.\nThemes Refers to statements about parent's . . .\nParent role in school Beliefs and practices around supervising child's education and homework, providing\nacademic assistance, participating in PTA, volunteering at the school, and other\nactivities to support children's education.\nParent involvement in school Practices and activities the parent does at the school, including going to the school\nto talk to teachers, making unannounced visits. Distinctions were made between\nteacher/staff-initiated contact and parent-initiated contact.\nParent contact with other parents Interactions with other parents (i.e., limited to problem, little/none and would like\nmore, little/none preferred).\nImpression of school Overall impressions of the school (i.e., positive to neutral, negative staff focused,\nnegative student focused, negative parent focused, negative school facility focused,\nperception that school discipline is unfair/inconsistent).\nBarriers/challenges to school involvement Descriptions of factors that inhibit involvement in the child's school, including\nschedule, work issues, transportation barriers. Student behavior and lack of\nopportunity at the school were also mentioned.\nChallenges raising an early adolescent Descriptions of the difficulties they face raising their sixth or seventh grader, including\ndevelopmental issues, school issues, increased misbehavior or opportunities for\nmisbehavior, and youth lack of disclosure about friends, school, peers, or problems.\nMurray et al. 7\nThis quote illustrates some parents' perceptions that\nteachers do not invite parents to become involved when their\nchild has difficulties not related to problem behavior in the\nclassroom. This absence of teacher invitations to become\ninvolved impedes SBPI; that is, teachers'failure to make par-\nents aware of particular problems with their children limits\nparents' opportunities for SBPI.\nTen parents reported teacher invitations to come to the\nschool because their child was involved in a conflict (typi-\ncally a fight) with another child or exhibited behavior prob-\nlems in class. In these cases, parents were visiting the school\nto participate in parent\u00adteacher conferences that were often\nmandatory.\nApproximately one half of parents indicated having nega-\ntive impressions of teachers in the school and generally dis-\ncussed unfriendly and hostile interactions with teachers.\nSome of these parents reported instances when teachers were\ndisrespectful to or inappropriately communicated with their\nchildren.\nGeneral school invitations for involvement.Most parents indi-\ncated that their children's school offered opportunities for\nSBPI. However, parents indicated that opportunities for\ninvolvement were not communicated in a timely, organized\nfashion. For example, some parents reported not learning\nabout opportunities including school assemblies and meet-\nings until it was too late for them to rearrange their schedule\nor until after they had occurred. One mother said,\nCommunication is lackadaisical and next to none. When she's in\ntrouble, they're quick to pick up the phone, but I don't hear\nnothing about PTA meetings . . . [T]hey're going on a field trip\nand they sent the permission slip home like two, maybe three\ndays before the trip. I've seen a few pieces of paper from time to\ntime, but again, anything regular or anything that I can like put\nmy hands on and make a calendar from, it doesn't happen.\nAlthough two parents indicated that their child failed to\ngive them flyers and other materials publicizing activities,\nthe majority of parents attributed poor communication to\ninadequate organization and communication channels at\ntheir child's school. Other less commonly discussed SBPI\nissues included parents'perception that the school offered no\nSBPI opportunities, offered them at inconvenient times, such\nas during the workday, and an impression that the PTA was\nineffective.\nNearly all parents mentioned having a negative impres-\nsion of one or more aspects of the school climate at their\nchild's school. More than one third of parents mentioned\nhaving an overall negative impression of the school, includ-\ning their perceptions of the school's discipline and safety\nproblems and criticisms of the administration's inability to\neffectively address school challenges. Furthermore, 16 par-\nents expressed negative impressions of students in their\nchild's school. These parents generally discussed the high\nlevels of aggressive and disrespectful student behavior in the\nschools. One father stated,\nThe teachers and administration had no control at all. It was\nalmost like a three-ring circus, kids cussing, threatening,\nfighting, running, throwing stuff; you name it, knocking people\nout of the way. No respect. (Father, age 53)\nParents' displeasure with aggressive and disrespectful\nstudents was reported as an obstacle to engaging in SBPI.\nOne parent said, \"I don't want to go [to the school] because\nsometimes you can't deal with other people's children . . .\nThey [are] disrespectful and they get smart with you in a\nminute\" (Mother, age 32). Furthermore, other parents in the\nchild's school were described in a negative light. One mother\ndescribed how she perceived other parents as antagonistic\nand difficult to engage when resolving child behavior-related\nproblems:\nWhen you do have little problems with children at the school\nand you try to go to this parent, you don't want to go--they get\nmad when you approach their child when [they are] not around.\nBut then [these parents are] nowhere to be found when I need to\ntalk . . . about my child's problem. (Mother, age 26)\nTen parents reported wanting little or no contact with\nother parents, an attitude that impedes engagement in\nSBPI. Parents' desire to avoid potentially negative interac-\ntions was the most common reason parent-to-parent con-\ntact was not wanted. Although parents generally reported\nnot knowing other parents, one half were interested in\nmeeting other parents. Parents' reasons for wanting to get\nto know the parents of their children's friends included\nhaving a way to keep track of their child's whereabouts\nand activities when unsupervised and building relation-\nships to facilitate communication about issues relevant to\ntheir child's schooling.\nParents' Perceived Life Context\nTime and energy. Work and scheduling issues were the most\nfrequently reported barriers to SBPI. One common response\nby parents was that they had no time to participate in SBPI\nconsistently or at all because of their demanding work sched-\nules and the absence of paid leave benefits. Therefore, they\nwere unable to or could not afford to take time off to partici-\npate in school activities. Often the combination of work\nissues and family responsibilities synergistically created\nmore obstacles to SBPI. One parent explained,\nI mean, basically [parents] just don't have time, unless they go\n[to the school] like early in the morning or whatever . . . I really\ndon't have time because when I get off work or go to my other\njob, or have to come home, clean up. Like right now, I'm\nwashing, and I have to cook dinner. I really don't have time. But\nI would like to, I really would, but I'm not rich. (Mother, age 45)\n8 SAGE Open\nDespite such multifaceted work and scheduling chal-\nlenges, a small number of parents described strategies or sac-\nrifices made to overcome these SBPI barriers. One mother\nsaid,\nSo yes, I do have to forgo some sleep sometimes. You know,\nwhen I was working during the day, there were days when I\nwould let my boss know the day before. \"Look, I'm going to be\nlate coming in because I have to go and visit my child's school.\"\n(Mother, age not disclosed)\nSkills and knowledge.There were no study findings directly\nrelated to parents' skills and knowledge (or attitudes regard-\ning their skills and knowledge) as it pertains to engagement\nin SBPI. Rather, the findings related to parents' skills and\nknowledge were directly relevant to home-based parent\ninvolvement (e.g., attitudes that endorsed providing aca-\ndemic assistance, linking their children to trusted family\nmembers and trusted adults in the community who could\nprovide academic help).\nDiscussion\nGuided by the Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler model of par-\nent involvement processes (Hoover-Dempsey et al., 1997;\nWalker et al., 2005), we identified barriers and facilitators to\nSBPI among parents who lived in low-income urban com-\nmunities and whose children attended three public middle\nschools. Our findings support previous research demonstrat-\ning links between motivational factors (i.e., motivational\nbeliefs, invitations for involvement, and personal life con-\ntext) and the frequency and types of parent involvement\nimplemented (Deslandes & Bertrand, 2005; Green et al.,\nmotivational beliefs for parent involvement were expressed\nin the form of parents' positive role construction regarding\ntheir function to support their child's educational endeavors.\nHowever, the quality of invitations for involvement by teach-\ners and the school as well as parents' personal life context\npresented a number of barriers. One important contribution\nof this study is the finding that students' aggressive behavior\nin the school not only contributed to some parents' negative\nperceptions of the school climate but in fact it also hindered\ntheir engagement in SBPI. Overall, the barriers identified\nhelp to explain why parents in the current study indicated\ninfrequent involvement in SBPI activities.\nMotivational Beliefs\nParents overwhelmingly reported positive attitudes and\nbeliefs regarding their role in fostering their child's educa-\ntional success. Consistent with previous research examining\nparental role construction (Baker, 1997; Drummond &\nexpressed that they have a role in their child's education and\nwere interested in being involved in their child's education at\nhome and at school. In the current study, parents'perceptions\nof their self-efficacy, the second component of motivational\nbeliefs, were not reported. Some research suggests that par-\nents' self-efficacy may be low among parents with limited\neducational attainment (Kim, 2009; Koonce & Harper,\n2005). However, in a sample of parents of diverse ethnic and\nSES backgrounds, Green et al. (2007) found a negative asso-\nciation between self-efficacy and SBPI. This finding sug-\ngests that parents who are less confident about their capacity\nto help their child in school may interact with the school\nmore often to obtain support (Green et al., 2007). Additional\nresearch in this area may help to elucidate the relationship\nbetween self-efficacy and SBPI specifically among popula-\ntions more similar to the sample in the current study.\nParents' Invitations for Involvement\nParents reported invitations for SBPI from their children and\ntheir teachers. Invitations from children were facilitators to\nSBPI in that they involved parental initiation of contact with\nteachers and other school staff, often to address problems\nincluding their child's difficulties with schoolwork or behav-\nior. Most parents indicated that their initiation of contact\nwith teachers was less common than teacher's invitations for\nSBPI involvement. Yet, parents indicated that teacher's invi-\ntations for SBPI involvement were often mandatory parent\u00ad\nteacher conferences. Regardless of the source of invitation\nfor involvement, parents generally reported negative and\nsometimes hostile interactions with teachers and other school\nstaff that can present barriers to future parent involvement\nthat is up to their discretion. This finding is similar to previ-\nous research indicating that unfriendly and hostile relation-\nships frequently characterize parent and school personnel\ninteractions in predominately low-income, minority samples\nMoreover, some parents in this sample noted instances\nwhen teachers were inappropriate or disrespectful to their\nchildren. Despite these negative experiences, parents\nexpressed little reticence about interacting with teachers and\nstaff. This finding contrasts that of previous studies that iden-\ntify barriers such as parents' lack of confidence when inter-\nacting with teachers and staff and perceived racism as\nhindrances to parent involvement (Kim, 2009; Koonce &\nceived racism based on SES or race was not explicitly\nexplored in the current study, the absence of barriers related\nto these factors is uncertain. The exploration of African\nAmerican parents' experiences with racism in their interac-\ntions with school personnel merits additional research.\nQualitative research that allows African American parents to\ntell their stories about racism they have experienced in their\nchildren's school reflects another central tenet of CRT (i.e.,\ncounterstorytelling; Delgado & Stefancic, 2001) and prom-\nises to yield rich data for critical analysis through a CRT lens.\nPresent study findings indicate that many parents held\nnegative impressions of the school. Parents reported that\nMurray et al. 9\ngeneral school invitations for SBPI about school events and\nmeetings were poorly coordinated. Information about SBPI\nopportunities were communicated inconsistently or too late\nfor parents to plan appropriately. This poor communication\nof SBPI opportunities may worsen parents' perceptions of\nthe school climate. Aggressive and disrespectful students\ndissuaded some parents from visiting the school, and interac-\ntions with other parents were viewed unfavorably. One find-\ning of the study suggests that the school climates of the three\nmiddle schools in this study were not welcoming. Given that\na welcoming school climate is an indicator of general school\ninvitations for parent involvement (Green et al., 2007;\nschool climate may have diminished parents' perceptions of\ngeneral invitations for parent involvement from the schools.\nStudy findings suggest the centrality of student behavior in\nparents' perceptions of the qualities of the school environ-\nment. In particular, the perceived school safety risks that\nstemmed from aggressive and disrespectful students seemed\nto repel some parents in the current study from visiting the\nschool rather than encourage more frequent visits. This inter-\npretation is in line with prior research indicating a positive\nassociation between school safety and parent involvement\nIt is also noteworthy that the current study described par-\nents' lack of contact with other parents at the school. This\nfinding is consistent with research indicating that the social\nnetworks of low-income parents do not prominently include\nother parents at their children's schools (Lareau & Shumar,\n1996). This lack of social connection limits parents'ability to\nlearn information about the school or their children's educa-\ntional process and may play a role in parents' decisions to\nOn the whole, the parent invitations for involvement find-\nings demonstrate that the parents in this study generally had\nnegative experiences with the schools. It is interesting to\nnote that parents' negative experiences with the school both\nfueled and thwarted SBPI. For example, the prospect of hav-\ning hostile interactions with teachers reduced the appeal of\nSBPI for many parents; however, a child experiencing\nteacher disrespect and antagonism was a catalyst for SBPI.\nSimilarly, the negative school climate repelled parents, yet at\nthe same time, the deleterious school climate contributed to\nthe ubiquitous nature of classroom conduct problems and\npeer conflicts. Thus, engaging in SBPI to address such prob-\nlems was a common experience for a number of parents in\nthe study. Such parent invitations for involvement findings\nexemplify the transactional nature of the interactions between\nparents, their children, teachers, administrators, as well as\nother students and their parents.\nPersonal Life Context\nWork and scheduling issues were the most commonly identi-\nfied barriers. Parents indicated various scheduling issues that\npresented a challenge to school involvement including work,\nraising children, and family responsibilities (e.g., preparing\ndinner, picking up more than one child from school). These\nbarriers are consistent with previous research on SBPI indi-\ncating that inflexible work schedules, multiple jobs, and the\nabsence of leave benefits are tremendous obstacles to paren-\ntal involvement for parents in single-headed households or\nof lower SES (Archer-Banks & Behar-Horenstein, 2008;\nParents also conveyed how demanding work schedules and\nmultifaceted family responsibilities diminish their physical\nenergy, thus, inhibiting their ability to engage in SBPI. Some\nparents reported having the flexibility to rearrange work\nschedules for school events; however, they reported that their\nchild's school's untimely communication of events pre-\nvented them from having enough time to rearrange their\nwork schedules. Unlike previous research (Lareau & Shumar,\ntransportation) were mentioned infrequently as barriers to\nSBPI. The availability of resources such as transportation\nand child care was not probed in this qualitative study.\nTherefore, it is unclear why limited resources failed to\nemerge as a frequent barrier among parents in the current\nstudy.\nAnother element reported was that parents'perceptions of\ntheir skills and knowledge in the context of SBPI were not\nreported. In a study of parents from diverse ethnic and SES\nbackgrounds, skills, and knowledge were unrelated to SBPI\n(Green et al., 2007). However, other findings from the same\nstudy suggest that parents with low self-efficacy regarding\ntheir capacity to help their child in school may engage in\nSBPI more often to obtain support (Green et al., 2007). As\nmentioned above, parents'self-efficacy for involvement may\nbe a barrier to parents of low SES (Hoover-Dempsey et al.,\nwith the school may be influenced by their educational\nindicators of knowledge and skills. Additional research on\nthe role of self-efficacy in predicting SBPI should also incor-\nporate measures of knowledge and skills as well as analyses\nthat explore both direct and indirect relationships among\nthese factors.\nPolicy Implications\nFor schools, building strong parent\u00adschool partnerships\nrequires practical steps that aim to enhance general school\ninvitations and teacher invitations for involvement. Schools\ncan also tailor SBPI activities to address the barriers experi-\nenced as a result of parents'personal life context. For example,\nschools can help increase SBPI by implementing more reliable\nand timely methods of communication (e.g., utilization of\nsocial media or texting), scheduling school meetings and\nevents at varied or multiple times, and soliciting parents'ideas\non other ways to overcome work- and scheduling-related\nbarriers. In addition, school counselors, social workers, and\nother human service professionals can play a pivotal role in\nfostering positive parent\u00adteacher relationships. On one\nhand, these professionals can educate teachers and other\nschool staff about the positive role construction and other\nassets (i.e., problem-solving skills and access to resources in\nparents' social networks) parents can bring to collaborative\nprocesses. On the other hand, these professionals can\nencourage parent visits by greeting and orienting them to\nSBPI opportunities, thus, boosting the positive aspects of\nthe school climate. Given parents' concern about aggressive\nstudents in the schools, offering opportunities to inform\nschool safety promotion programs and policies may be a\ngood approach to engaging parents in school improvement\nefforts. Finally, the parent concerns expressed about nega-\ntive interactions with other parents and students highlights\nthe need for activities that promote community building,\nshared goals, and positive interactions with the schools.\nLimitations\nIt is important to note that major school system policy\nchanges since the study period have resulted in the imple-\nmentation of new parent engagement initiatives at the local\nand state levels. Thus, compared with parents in the present\nstudy, current parents of students attending these middle\nschools may have a different impression of parent involve-\nment barriers and facilitators. Study findings should be con-\nsidered in light of several other limitations. First, only the\nperspectives of parents and other caregivers were examined.\nThe perspectives of teachers and other school personnel in\naddition to parents may provide a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of issues and solutions. Second, the absence\nof specific interview questions regarding race as a potential\nbarrier to parent involvement may mean that important race-\nbased dynamics were not identified and explored. It is also\nunlikely that the attitudes and practices reported by the cur-\nrent study participants fully represent those of the parents\nwho participated in the larger intervention study as well as\nthe larger pool of parents whose children attended the three\nmiddle schools. Because our recruitment strategy primarily\ninvolved contacting parents by telephone, parents with dis-\nconnected or inconsistent telephone service were underrep-\nresented in the study. This may have biased the sample\ntoward including parents with relatively higher incomes and\nmore resources. Although attempts were made to contact\nparents during both day and evening hours, parents who\nworked more than one job or with higher family manage-\nment demands may have been more difficult to reach.\nParents whom staff were unable to reach or who refused to\nparticipate may have been those experiencing more exten-\nsive barriers to SBPI. Findings should be interpreted with\ncaution given the limited generalizability of the study\nfindings.\nConclusion\nMore barriers than facilitators emerged in this exploration of\nfactors that inhibit or foster parents'motivation for SBPI in a\nsample of predominately African American parents who\nhave low incomes and whose children attend urban, public\nmiddle schools. The negative quality of parents' interactions\nwith teachers, the schools, other children and parents, as well\nas work and scheduling challenges were factors that hindered\nSBPI. In spite of this, the positive motivational beliefs par-\nents expressed, parents' responses to child invitations for\ninvolvement, and the interest of some parents to get to know\nother parents are foundations to build on for the development\nof stronger, parent\u00adschool partnerships characterized by col-\nlaboration and shared power (Powell & Batsche, 1997).\nFuture research directions should include further examina-\ntions of the role of school climate (including factors related\nto students and other parents in the schools) in motivating\nparent involvement among African American parents of chil-\ndren attending middle schools with school safety risks. In\npredominately African American samples, an emphasis on\nunderstanding the role of racism in shaping policies that con-\ntribute to unsafe school climates may particularly help to\ninform initiatives to improve the school environment.\nAuthor's Note\nThe contents are solely the responsibility of the authors and do not\nnecessarily represent the official views of the funding agency.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: This publication\nwas supported by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of\nChild Health and Human Development (NICHD) Contract No.\n(Cheng), the NICHD Intramural Research Program (Haynie) and\nfrom the National Institute on Minority Health and Health\nDisparities (Cheng).
