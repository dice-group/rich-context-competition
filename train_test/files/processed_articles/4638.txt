    "abstract": "Abstract\nTwo hypotheses have been advanced in the recent literature with respect to the so-called\nInterlanguage Speech Intelligibility Benefit (ISIB): a nonnative speaker will be better understood by\na another nonnative listener than a native speaker of the target language will be (a) only when the\nnonnatives share the same native language (matched interlanguage) or (b) even when the\nnonnatives have different mother tongues (non-matched interlanguage). Based on a survey of\npublished experimental materials, the present article will demonstrate that both the restricted\n(a) and the generalized (b) hypotheses are false when the ISIB effect is evaluated in terms of\nabsolute intelligibility scores. We will then propose a simple way to compute a relative measure for\nthe ISIB (R-ISIB), which we claim is a more insightful way of evaluating the interlanguage benefit,\nand test the hypotheses in relative (R-ISIB) terms on the same literature data. We then find that\nour R-ISIB measure only supports the more restricted hypothesis (a) while rejecting the more\ngeneral hypothesis (b). This finding shows that the native language shared by the interactants biases\nthe listener toward interpreting sounds in terms of the phonology of the shared mother tongue.\n",

It is commonly recognized that native\nspeakers and native listeners outperform foreign speakers and listeners of the language. For\ninstance, native (L1) listeners generally find fellow native talkers more intelligible than\nnonnative (L2) talkers, particularly in noisy conditions (Munro, 1998; Munro & Derwing,\n1995). L1 speakers cause fewer word perception errors than foreign speakers of the language\ndo. In a classical study, word recognition by native listeners for Serbian-, Japanese- and\nPunjabi-accented English was some 36% poorer than for native English speech in a range\nof signal-to-noise ratios and filtering conditions (Lane, 1967). More recently, it was shown\nthat the word error rate of English spoken with a Mandarin accent was 11% against a mere\n4% for native American control speakers, when in both cases the listeners were Americans\n(Munro & Derwing, 1995). Using a different methodology, native-speaker superiority was\nmeasured in terms of the speech reception threshold, that is, the noise level at which 50% of\nthe words in the test materials are correctly recognized. Speech reception threshold was found\nto be at a 4-dB poorer signal-to-noise ratio when the Dutch listeners responded to Dutch\nspeakers, than when the speakers were British learners of Dutch (Van Wijngaarden, 2001).\nBy the same token, L1 listeners have better scores, faster recognition times, and withstand\nmore adverse listening conditions than L2 listeners do -- at least when the test materials are\nrecorded from fellow L1 speakers. Native listeners are better at recognizing degraded speech\n(telephone speech, synthetic speech, speech in noise) than nonnative speakers. For instance,\nDutch listeners could recognize Dutch words from shorter onset portions than English\nlearners of Dutch, even if the latter had resided in the Netherlands for 20 years or more\nIn the studies summarized earlier, information is exchanged between a native speaker and a\nnative listener as the control condition and a native/nonnative pair of interactants for the\nexperimental condition. In this comparison the native/nonnative pair is consistently\noutperformed by the native/native control pairs. Note that the comparison does not involve\npairs of interactants who are both nonnative speakers of the language used. Somewhat\nsurprisingly, it has been observed that nonnative speakers may be more intelligible than native\nspeakers when the listener is also nonnative. Indeed, second-language learners often report that\nthe speech of a fellow nonnative talker is easier to understand than the speech of a native talker.\nBent and Bradlow (2003) advanced two hypotheses with respect to this phenomenon. The first\nhypothesis holds that a foreign talker of a language is more intelligible to any foreign listener of\nthat language than a native speaker is. This is what Bent and Bradlow call the non-matched (or\n``mixed'') interlanguage speech intelligibility benefit (ISIB). Early evidence in support of this\nhypothesis has been provided by Nash (1969). The second, more restricted, hypothesis predicts\nthat a foreign talker will be more intelligible to a foreign listener (than a native talker would be)\nonly if the foreign talker and listener share the same mother tongue. This is what Bent and\nBradlow call the matched (or ``shared'') interlanguage benefit.\nThe theoretical underpinning of the unrestricted hypothesis seems tenuous. It has been\nobserved that nonnative talkers speak rather slowly and hesitantly, which would benefit\nanyone who would have problems with decoding the message (e.g., Derwing & Munro,\n2001). The slow speed of delivery and the insertion of pauses when the speaker is looking\nfor words would allow the nonnative listener time to integrate what has been heard and to\npredict upcoming words. The beneficial effect of insertion of pauses (with compensation for\nslower rate of delivery) has been demonstrated for low-quality Dutch speech synthesis and\nfor natural Dutch speech in noise (Scharpff, 1994; Scharpff & Van Heuven, 1988; Van\nHeuven & Scharpff, 1991), as well as for Danish perceived by Swedish listeners (Gooskens\n& Van Bezooijen, 2014). Moreover, the foreign talker will use a fairly restricted vocabulary\ncomprising high-frequency words only (e.g., Cervatiuc, 2008; Milton & Meara, 1995) so that\nthe listeners will not often be confronted with unfamiliar words. The benefit will probably\ndisappear, we would argue, if the test materials were produced by a native speaker of the\ntarget language and manipulated such that the words and sentence structures (after minimal\ncorrection) and the gross temporal organization (speed of delivery as well location and length\nof pauses) would be the same as that used by the nonnative talker. We are not aware of any\nsuch study, however, so that our objection remains speculative.\nArguments supporting this more restricted hypothesis have been provided by many\nWijngaarden, Steeneken, and Houtgast (2002), Imai, Flege and Walley (2003), Wang and\nthe statistical regularities at all linguistic levels (sounds, syllables, morphemes, words, and\nsentences) and skillfully use any redundancy that may exist in the native language system\n(Cutler, 2012). These skills are much less developed in nonnative listeners. The sound\ncategories of the target language are less well defined in the perceptual representation of\nnonnatives, and transitional probabilities that allow the native listener to predict upcoming\nsounds (or restore sounds that were missed) are not known to (let alone used by) the\nnonnative listener. This does not only apply to nonnative listeners who have learned the\nforeign language as adults, but it has been shown that even the sound categories in a second\nlanguage that was acquired before the age of four (i.e., by so-called early bilinguals) are less\nwell defined than for monolingual listeners (Sebastian-Galles & Soto Faraco, 1999).\nBent and Bradlow (2003) tested both hypotheses in one integrated experiment and claim that\nthey found evidence in support of both. They point out that specific combinations of foreign\nspeaker and listener language backgrounds yield better intelligibility scores than combinations\ninvolving a native speaker or listener, both when language backgrounds of the foreign speakers\nand listeners are mixed and when they are shared. However, the authors do not quantify the\neffect in a way that allows the reader to determine the magnitude of the interlanguage benefit, nor\nto check whether the benefit is larger for the shared interlanguage than for the mixed\ninterlanguage situation. We would argue that this is an undesirable state of affairs. In fact, it\nis our contention that in none of the studies we are aware of (see below) has the ISIB been\nquantified and tested in an adequate way. More specifically we criticize the implicit choice in the\nliterature to examine the ISIB in terms of absolute scores obtained by groups of listeners. This is a\nstatistically inadequate and nai\u00a8ve way of testing the ISIB. Rather, we will argue that the ISIB\nshould be evaluated in a relative manner, using insights from linear modeling, such that the\nrelative ISIB (R-ISIB) is defined as the magnitude of the statistical interaction term that is needed\non top of the main effects of speaker and listener language in order to make an error-free\nprediction of the absolute scores. We will demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of our\napproach by making a systematic comparison of ISIB and R-ISIB values in a reanalysis of a\nnumber of published studies (in fact, all published studies that exist and speak to the issue).\nWe will briefly introduce the basic idea behind linear modeling and explain the difference\nbetween main effects and interactions. We will illustrate the (simple) computational method\nto express the magnitude of the (shared or mixed) interlanguage benefit and then reanalyze\nthe results of a number of earlier studies on these phenomena. This meta-analytic exercise will\nshow, first of all, that the proposed relative measure of the interlanguage benefit yields the\npredicted effects (much more clearly so than when some absolute measure of the benefit is\napplied), and that the benefit is indeed larger when speakers and listeners have a shared native\nlanguage between them than when the interactants have different native languages.\nMoreover, the meta-analysis will reveal that the mutual intelligibility is poorest when one\nof the interlocutors (whether speaker or listener) is native and the other is nonnative. We will\ncall this the case of the native-speaker handicap.\nWang and van Heuven 3\nA Relative (R-ISIB)\nLinear modeling is a statistical technique that allows a researcher to decompose the relationship\nbetween stimulus properties and response scores into main effects and interactions between\nTable 1 presents data taken from a study described in more detail by Wang (2007), Van\nHeuven and Wang (2007), and Wang and Van Heuven (2014) -- see also Meta-Analysis:\nTesting the ISIB Hypotheses on Aggregated Data section. In an experiment, one\nrepresentative male and one female speaker were selected from a larger peer group\ncomprising 10 male and 10 female speakers for each of three native language\nbackgrounds, that is, Mandarin-Chinese, Dutch, and American English. These speakers\nhad produced the vowels of English in a fixed/hVd/context, which were then offered for\nforced choice identification to groups of Chinese, Dutch, and American English listeners\n(N \u00bc 36 for each listener group). Per speaker group the one male and female speaker had\nbeen selected with the shortest Euclidean distance from the peer group centroid in a two-\ndimensional plane defined by correct vowel identification and correct consonant\nidentification by listeners in an earlier experiment who shared the language background of\nthe speakers (shared interlanguage).\nThe linear model decomposes the scores in each of the nine cells (as listed in part of\nTable 1) in terms of their deviation from the grand mean, both in the speaker dimension\nand in the listener dimension (part B). The grand mean of the nine scores equals 49.\nSubtracting the grand mean from all cell scores does not affect any of the differences\nbetween cell scores, it just adjusts the grand mean to zero. In linear modeling, the cell\nscores are then represented as the arithmetic addition of three components: (a) the main\neffect of speaker group, that is, the deviation from xi\n\u00fe (b) the main effect of listener group,\nthat is, the deviation from yj\n\u00fe , (c) the interaction between speaker and listener group, that is,\nwhatever adjustment is needed to make the addition of all three components match the cell\ncontents. The interaction term for each cell is what is needed to bridge the gap between the\ncell score that is expected on the basis of the linear addition of the main effects of speaker\ngroup and listener group (the ``expected'' score) and the actual ``observed'' score for that cell.\nWe argue that the interaction component, that is, the difference \u00c1 between the expected and\nobserved score for a cell in Table 1 is the magnitude of R-ISIB.\nTable 2 rearranges the scores in Table 1 in a format that is better suited to illustrate how\nthe components of the linear model are obtained. The observed scores (column marked\nTable 1. Correct Vowel Identification Scores (%) Obtained by Three Groups of Speakers (Chinese, Dutch,\nAmerican) Based on the Responses of Three Groups of Listeners (Chinese, Dutch, American).\nSpeakers\nListeners\n(a) Raw (absolute) scores (b) Deviations from grand mean\nCh. Du. Am. xi\nxi \u00c0 x Ch. Du. Am. xi\nxi \u00c0 x\nyj\nyj\n``Obs.'') are the mean percent correct vowel identification scores for each of the nine\ncombinations of speaker and listener language backgrounds, copied from Table 1. In\nabsolute terms, the best intelligibility scores are obtained when both speakers and listeners\nare native (75% correct vowel identification). It is not the case, however, that native-\nnonnative speaker-listener combinations yield consistently poorer intelligibility scores than\npairs exclusively involving nonnative interactants -- in contradistinction to what the\ninterlanguage intelligibility benefit hypothesis predicts. In fact, the poorest results are\nobtained when both speakers and listeners are Chinese (30%), and the best result is found\nfor the combination of Dutch listeners to American speakers (61%). Nor is it the case that\nnonnative speaker-listener combinations that share the same language between them (30%\nfor Chinese\u00adChinese and 59% for Dutch\u00adDutch) yield consistently better scores than mixed\nnonnative combinations (34% and 40% for Chinese\u00adDutch and Dutch\u00adChinese,\nrespectively). Clearly, then, testing the ISIB hypothesis in absolute terms fails miserably.\nNow let us look at these results in rather more relative terms. I argue that the 30% correct\nvowel identification obtained by the Chinese-Chinese speaker-listener combination, although\nthe lowest score of all in absolute terms, is in fact much better than should be expected in\ncomparison with the other scores. Table 2 shows that the 30% vowel identification score is\nbetter than what would be expected on the basis of the linear addition of the main effects\nof speaker group and listener group. The difference is, in fact, 8 points, that is, a R-ISIB\nvalue of 8.\nThe computation involves the following steps.\n(1) Compute the grand mean score across all speaker\u00adlistener combinations. This is 49%\ncorrect in the present example (see bottom row).\n(2) Next, compute the mean score for each of the speaker groups (by averaging over the\nlistener groups). For instance, the mean score for Chinese speakers is 39 (see column\nTable 2. Expected Vowel Identification Scores (% Correct) on the Basis of Grand Mean (\u00bc 49%) and Main\nEffects for Listener and Speaker L1.\nInterlocutor's role\nExp. Obs. \u00c1\nListener Speaker\nNative language Mean Effect Native language Mean Effect\nNote. Means for listener groups and speaker groups are specified, as well as the effect of group membership (i.e., group\nmean\u00adgrand mean). The expected scores (Exp.) are found by subtracting the effects of listener group and speaker group\nfrom the grand mean. Observed scores (Obs.) and residuals (\u00c1) are indicated. Shaded rows contain speaker\u00adlistener\ncombinations with a shared interlanguage. Bolded delta's represent the shared interlanguage (or native language) benefit. All\npercentages have been rounded off to the nearest integer.\nWang and van Heuven 5\nspeaker-mean), which is the mean of Chinese speakers combined with Chinese, Dutch,\nand American listeners, with scores of 30%, 40%, and 50%, respectively (see column\n(3) Likewise, compute the mean scores for each of the listener groups, averaged over\nspeakers. This yields mean scores of 33%, 53%, and 61% for Chinese, Dutch, and\nAmerican listeners, respectively (see column listener-mean).\n(4) Then compute the deviation of the speaker means from the grand mean by subtraction.\nFor instance, the mean of the Chinese speaker group (39%) is 10 points below the grand\nmean of 49%, hence a deviation of \u00c010 (see column speaker-effect).\n(5) Similarly, compute the deviation of each listener group mean from the grand mean.\nThe mean of the Chinese listener group (33%) is 16 points below the grand mean,\nhence a deviation of \u00c016 (see column listener-effect).\n(6) Then compute the expected score for each speaker\u00adlistener combination, by adding the\nspeaker group deviation and the listener group deviation to the grand mean. In the\ncase of the Chinese-Chinese speaker-listener combination this would be 49% (grand\nmean)\u00c016 (listener group deviation)\u00c010 (speaker group deviation) \u00bc 22% (see column\n(7) Finally, compute the prediction error (``residual'') for each speaker\u00adlistener combination,\nwhich is the difference between the expected and the observed score. This gap between\nexpected and observed scores is then closed by the interaction component in the linear\nmodel. For the Chinese\u00adChinese combination, we expect 22% (top data row, column\nExp.) but find 30% (same row, column Obs.), so that the residual equals \u00fe8 points (same\nrow, column \u00c1). This is the value for R-ISIB.3 Note that the mean R-ISIB for each row\nand each column in the matrix, as well as for the matrix in its entirety, should always add\nup to zero, since positive and negative prediction errors should cancel each other out.\nWhen the listeners are Chinese, Dutch, and American, the expected mean scores are \u00c016,\n\u00fe4, and \u00fe12 relative to the grand mean; for the three speaker language backgrounds, the\nexpected mean should be additionally corrected with \u00c010, \u00fe3, and \u00fe7, respectively.\nNote here that the size of the increments/decrements is larger for listener language\nbackground than for speaker language background, that is, the listener effect is larger than\nthe speaker effect.\nGenerally, the observed scores are correctly predicted or even overestimated by the linear\naddition of the two main effects. Only in three combinations of factor levels is the observed\nscore substantially better than the prediction. These are precisely the conditions in which the\nlisteners are confronted with vowel tokens spoken by their fellow countrymen (``shared\ninterlanguage'', shaded rows in Table 2). The native or interlanguage benefit is 4 to 8\npercentage points better than the expected score. It appears that there is no need to\ndifferentiate between communication between a native speaker and a native listener (with a\nR-ISIB of \u00fe7 points, which could be called a ``native-language benefit'') and communication\nbetween a nonnative speaker and a nonnative listener who share the same native language\n(\u00fe4 and \u00fe8 points for Dutch and Chinese matched interlanguage groups, respectively): in\nboth situations the residual is of comparable, positive magnitude.\nIn the case of a speaker\u00adlistener combination with a mixed interlanguage, the R-ISIB is\nvery close to zero: \u00c01 for Dutch-Chinese and \u00c02 for Chinese-Dutch). This would indicate\nthat, indeed, the shared interlanguage yields a substantially greater benefit than the mixed\ninterlanguage. There are too few observations to run any meaningful statistics on the\ndifference; this we will do in the next section of this article where we will test this effect on\ndata aggregated over a number of studies.\nR-ISIB is most negative when the speaker\u00adlistener combination involves one native and\none nonnative party. Here the R-ISIB ranges between \u00c01 and \u00c06 points. Again, we will defer\nstatistical testing of the significance of this native-language handicap until we have sufficient\naggregate data.\nIn the next section, we will first provide some background on the idea of linear modeling and\nthen explain the computational procedure that should be applied to compute the proposed\nrelative measure of interlanguage benefit. Here we will use an example taken from Wang\n(2007). In the later sections, we will reanalyze earlier results by Smith and Rafiqzad (1979), by\nBent and Bradlow (2003) and the set of six tests used by Wang (2007). As far as we have been\nable to ascertain, these are the only studies that have been published on mutual intelligibility in\nEnglish comparing speaker and listener groups from more than just two (i.e., native English vs.\none nonnative language group) different nonnative language backgrounds.\nMeta-Analysis: Testing the ISIB Hypotheses on Aggregated Data\nIn this section, we will test the restricted (shared interlanguage) and generalized (mixed\ninterlanguage) versions of the ISIB hypothesis on a collection of data taken from three\nstudies that address the issue. Where individual studies contain too few data to do any\nmeaningful statistical evaluation of the versions of the hypotheses, we claim that aggregate\ndata from multiple studies do afford this possibility. In the next subsection, we will briefly\ndescribe the studies that underlie the meta-analysis, then formulate quantitative predictions\nand proceed with a statistical analysis of the aggregate data.\nLiterature Data\nSmith and Rafiqzad (1979). The earliest study to compare the intelligibility of native and\nnonnative English in a sufficiently complete matrix of speaker and listener groups with a\nvariety of language backgrounds was probably done by Smith and Rafiqzad (1979). In this\nstudy, the authors recorded materials from educated L2 speakers of English in seven Asian\ncountries, viz. Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Nepal, and the Philippines.\nSimilar materials were collected from native speakers of American English. Unfortunately,\nthe design was incomplete in that no materials of any speaker group were presented to\nAmerican native listeners. There were also nonnative listener groups that were never used\nas speakers -- these I pruned from the matrix below.4 The materials were presented to the\nseven relevant listener groups in a Cloze test, in which listeners saw a printed version of the\naudible text, with every sixth word replaced by a blank to be filled in. A detailed analysis of\nthe results both in terms of ISIB and of R-ISIB, as was demonstrated for the Wang's (2007)\nvowel identification experiment in A Relative R-ISIB section, is presented in Van Heuven\n(2015; Tables 2 and 3). Here we will not dwell on the intermediate steps but concentrate on a\ncomparison of effects across all meta-analytic data.\nBent and Bradlow (2003). Bent and Bradlow (2003) examined the interlanguage benefit in a\ndatabase with mutual intelligibility scores in English obtained for five types of speakers: one\nhigh-proficiency and one low-proficiency Korean L2 speaker of English, one high-proficiency\nand one low-proficiency Chinese L2 speaker of English, and one native speaker of American\nEnglish. Sentences produced by these five (female) speakers were presented to four groups of\nlisteners with Chinese (N \u00bc 21), Korean (N \u00bc 10), American (N \u00bc 21), and mixed-foreign\n(N \u00bc 12) backgrounds. Intelligibility scores were determined for all 5 \u00c2 4 \u00bc 20 combinations\nof speaker and hearer L1 backgrounds.\nWang and van Heuven 7\nThe scores were not expressed in percentages but in rationalized arcsine units (RAUs).\nThe arcsine transform was applied by Bent and Bradlow to unwarp the bottom and top\nranges of the percentage scale in order to compensate for bottom and ceiling effects. After\n``rationalisation'' the transformed scale extends between \u00c017 and \u00fe117 RAU; 50\nRAU \u00bc 50% (Studebaker, 1985). For the purpose of this meta-analysis, we will treat the\nRAU scores as if they were percentages. This decision is motivated by the consideration that\nwhatever distortion the arcsine transformation may have introduced, the choice between\npercentages and RAUs will not affect the difference between absolute and relative ISIB.\nFor details of the results, see Van Heuven (2015: Tables 4 and 5). The absolute and\nrelative (R-ISIB) scores were transferred to the aggregate data.\nWang (2007). Wang (2007) ran a large study on the mutual intelligibility of Dutch, Mandarin,\nand American speakers of English. Twenty speakers (10 males, 10 females) from each of these\nthree different native-language backgrounds produced materials in English, that is, (a) vowels\nin a /hVd/ context, (b) consonants and (c) consonant clusters in intervocalic contexts, (d)\nsemantically unpredictable sentences, (e) semantically meaningful sentences with final target\nwords in unpredictable (``non-pregnant''), and (f) predictable (``pregnant'') contexts.\nThe materials of one representative male and one female speaker for each of the three\nlanguage backgrounds were then offered for identification (of vowels, consonants, and\nclusters) or recognition (of words in sentences) to 36 listeners in each of three countries 36\nlearners of English at Changchun University (Mandarin language area), 36 learners of\nEnglish at Leiden University (Netherlands), and 36 American native listeners at the\nUniversity of California Los Angeles (UCLA), so that all nine possible combinations of\nspeaker and listener backgrounds occurred equally often in the experiment.\nPredictions\nWe will now perform a statistical analysis across all data that were discussed above. We will\nspecifically test two related hypotheses. The first is that (1a) there will be a strong\ninterlanguage intelligibility benefit such that two nonnatives with the same mother tongue\nTable 3. Mean (Absolute) ISIB and R-ISIB Broken Down by Four Types of Speaker\u00adListener Group\nCombinations, Aggregated Over all Experiments Reviewed in This Article.\nSpeaker\u00adlistener\ncombination\nAbsolute (ISIB) Relative (R-ISIB)\nMean SD N Mean SD N\ninterlanguage\ninterlanguage\nPosthoc\n(Bonferroni, a \u00bc .05)\nISIB \u00bc interlanguage speech intelligibility benefit; R-ISIB \u00bc relative-interlanguage speech intelligibility benefit;\nANOVA \u00bc analysis of variance.\nwill understand each other in English best when speaking a foreign language (shared\ninterlanguage), (1b) two nonnatives with different native language backgrounds will\nunderstand each other more poorly (mixed interlanguage), and (1c) the poorest\nintelligibility will be observed when a nonnative communicates with a native speaker\n(whether as speaker or as listener). The second hypothesis is that these predictions will be\nborne out more clearly when using the relative measure of the ISIB than when looking at\nabsolute intelligibility scores.\nResults of the Meta-Analysis\nThe aggregate data contain 130 cases, that is, the total number of speaker\u00adlistener group\ncombinations accumulated across the studies reviewed in the preceding subsections, that is, 7\n(listener language backgrounds) \u00c2 8 (speaker language backgrounds) \u00bc 56 combinations\ntaken from Smith and Rafiqzad (1979), 4 \u00c2 5 \u00bc 20 combinations from Bent and Bradlow\nWang (2007). The six tests from Wang (2007) were treated as independent, on the strength\nof the observation that there were no significant correlations between the scores obtained on\nthe six tests (see Wang 2007, chap. 10). Table 3 presents the mean ISIB and R-ISIB values for\nfour types of speaker\u00adlistener group combinations, that is, combinations yielding (a) shared\ninterlanguage, (b) mixed interlanguage, (c) native/nonnative pair, and (d) native-native pairs\n(as a control condition).\nIn terms of absolute interlanguage benefit, the results indicate that native-speaker-native-\nlistener pairs yield near-ceiling intelligibility scores (93%), which is about 30 percentage\npoints better than any of the three combinations involving one or two nonnative\ninteractants; these three speaker\u00adlistener combinations do not differ from each other by a\nposthoc comparison of means (Bonferroni-corrected, after one-way analysis of variance, see\nTable 3). The results obviously contradict the hypothesis that there is any benefit to be gained\nby nonnatives, whether they do or do not share an interlanguage: all nonnatives are equally\nhandicapped, whether communicating with a native or with each other.\nIn relative terms, however, the situation is much more as predicted. First of all, nonnatives\nwith a shared interlanguage enjoy the same intelligibility benefit as two natives, with positive\nR-ISIB values of 6.8 and 7.0, respectively. Moreover, when speaker and listener have a non-\nmatched (mixed) interlanguage, the R-ISIB is negative (\u00c02.4). There is a clear difference,\nthen, between the matched and the non-matched interlanguage pairs to the effect that no\nbenefit remains when speaker and listener have different native languages. The idea of a\nnative speaker handicap, however, is not supported by the aggregate data. It is not the\ncase that a nonnative listener is at a greater disadvantage when communicating with a\nnative speaker than when communicating with a nonnative with whom he does not share\nthe native language background. Not only are the R-ISIB results more in line with the\nhypotheses formulated in the literature, they are also statistically more reliable, given that\nthe effect size (Z2) of the speaker\u00adlistener combination is roughly three times stronger in\nrelative (R-ISIB) than absolute (ISIB) scores (see Table 2).\nConclusion and Discussion\nOn the basis of the literature, we formulated two hypotheses with respect to the effect of the\nspecific composition of a speaker-listener pair involving different combinations of native and\nnonnative interactants. The first hypothesis predicted (1a) that two nonnatives will\nunderstand each other in English best when they have the same native-language\nWang and van Heuven 9\nbackground (i.e., shared interlanguage) and (1b) will perform better than when they have\ndifferent native language backgrounds (mixed interlanguage). These subhypotheses proved\nfalse when tested in absolute terms but were clearly supported by the data when evaluated in\nrelative (R-ISIB) terms. In fact, in relative terms, nonnative speaker-listener pairs enjoy the\nsame interlanguage benefit as native speaker-native listener pairs -- as long as speaker and\nlistener have the same mother tongue. One more subhypothesis, (1c), which was formulated\non the basis of earlier analyses of Wang's (2007) data, cannot be upheld in the meta-analysis:\nit is not the case that communication between native and nonnative interactants is poorer\nthan between two nonnatives with different language backgrounds. On the strength of this\nlatter finding, hypothesis (1c) has to be rejected.\nThe above state of affairs suggests that the earlier tripartite division of interlocuters in\nterms of (a) native speakers and listeners, (b) nonnative speaker-listener pairs with a shared\ninterlanguage, and (c) those with non-shared, that is, mixed, interlanguages is not supported\nby our R-ISIB results. The meta-analysis boils down to a very simple and clear-cut binary\ndivision in intelligibility between native and nonnative speakers of a language. When two\ninteractants share the same native language, they enjoy the advantage of a shared phonology.\nIn this sense native speakers communicating with native listeners also share a common\ninterlanguage, namely the ideal (near) perfect grammar/phonology of the native speaker/\nlistener. When two interactants do not have the same mother tongue, their mutual\nintelligibility is poorer. Here, it does not matter whether both interactants are nonnative\nor whether a foreigner communicates with a native -- the point is that they do not share\nany interlanguage.\nAlso Hypothesis (2) predicted that the effects would be stronger when evaluated in relative\nrather than in absolute scores. The analysis of variance indicated an effect size in R-ISIB that\nwas three times larger than when analyzed in absolute scores. Hypothesis (2) is therefore\nconfirmed: relative scores work better than absolute scores.\nAs we pointed out in the introduction, it has been observed that nonnative listeners of\nEnglish often have the intuition that they understand a fellow nonnative talker, that is,\none with whom they share a common mother tongue, better than a native speaker of\nEnglish. This intuition is supported by the experimental data, but only when the\nintelligibility scores are expressed in relative terms, that is, in terms of the R-ISIB\nmeasure that was explained in A Relative R-ISIB section. We conclude, therefore, that\nthe proper way of evaluating the concept of the ISIB, as formulated by Bent and Bradlow\n(2003), is in relative rather than in absolute terms. We would suggest that future research\non communication between native and/or nonnative interactants should analyze the\nresults in terms of our R-ISIB measure, either as the only ISIB measure or at least as\na measure supplementary to comparing absolute ISIB values as has been the common\npractice in the literature.\nIn summary, we now have at our disposal a way to quantify the ISIB in a way that works\nand that matches intuitions that were formulated in the literature (which were not matched\nwhen absolute intelligibility scores were examined earlier). Also, we now know that there is a\nclear (and motivated) difference between communication that involves interactants who share\nthe same native language (whether speaking in their mother tongue or in a nonnative\nlanguage) and communication involving interactants who do not share the interlanguage.\nThis refutes the earlier hypothesis (entertained and not rejected by Bent & Bradlow, 2003)\nthat any nonnative speaker should be more intelligible to a nonnative listener than a native\nspeaker is. This insight is new. Together these two points constitute the contribution this\narticle adds to what was known about factors that determine speech intelligibility among\nnative and nonnative interlocutors.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article: The authors acknowledge the financial support by the Ministry of Education,\nHumanities and Social Sciences Planning Project, 14YJA740036; The Department of Education of\nTechnology Innovation Committee Basic Research Project, 007570.\nNotes\n1. On face value, these three numbers should average out at 40% instead of 39%. The discrepancy is\ndue to rounding errors.\n2. On the basis of the values presented in Table 1, an expected value of 21% would be expected. The\nslight discrepancy is due to greater rounding accuracy in the computations underlying the table.\n3. The numbers presented in this table deviate slightly from what was published in Wang (2007) and\nVan Heuven and Wang (2007). The present numbers are correct.\n4. Smith and Rafiqzad (1979) have been criticized for other reasons as well. It has been pointed out that\nthe materials produced by the speaker groups differ substantially in terms of conceptual\ncomprehensibility -- so that no straightforward comparisons between speaker and listener groups\ncan be made. This criticism, of course, is no longer valid once we apply the concept of R-ISIB. When\nthe speaker of a language is more difficult to understand, for whatever reason, this will affect the\nmain effect of speaker but not the speaker by listener interaction, that is, not the R-ISIB.\nReferences\nBent, T., & Bradlow, A.
