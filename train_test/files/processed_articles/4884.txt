    "abstract": "Abstract\nMore and more individuals are turning to the mass media in search of information related to health care. Moreover, health\ncare accounts for an important percentage of modern economies and household expenses. Since the 1990s, this demand has\nbeen to a degree satisfied by free healthcare magazines that offer useful advice and information related to health services and\nwellness. As the article argues, Spain can be a representative case for analyzing the health care magazine phenomenon. Using\na methodology based on quantitative and qualitative variables, the article synthesizes the results of a broader research project\ncarried out between 2012 and 2015, focusing on the news content and advertising in three free health and wellness magazines\naimed at the general public in Spain: El Peri\u00f3dico de la Farmacia (The Pharmacy Newspaper), Estar bien (Feeling Well), and\nHealth 21 (Salud 21). The conclusions discuss the main features and dimensions of these publications from an educational\nand social viewpoint, considering their fight for survival in an environment conditioned by financial crisis, competition from\nonline publications, and the decrease in advertising and marketing specializing in health.\n",

In Spain, concretely, the latest barometers of the Centre\nof Sociological Studies (CIS) show an increase in concern\nabout the health services in general. According to the 2014\nHealth Barometer (CIS; January-December), health is the\nsixth area of interest to the citizenry, whereas the CIS\nBarometer of December 2015 reports that health is the sixth\nproblem of greatest concern (11.9%), a figure that has risen\nconsiderably since 2007, when it stood at 5.8%, according to\nthe same source. It should also be recalled that health is a\nregular topic of informal conversation among the population.\nNaturally, for many years, the mass media have responded\nto the citizens' interest in acquiring useful data and knowl-\nedge to improve their quality of life. In reality, the mass\nmedia have always offered content, suggestions, and guide-\nlines that readers can apply at a given moment, which is\ndirectly related to the so-called \"social responsibility\" of the\npress (Scott, 1987, p. 3). Furthermore, over the last decades,\nthere has been an increase in health content in all media and\nmedia formats, in addition to the appearance of new journals\non health and wellness (Salmon & Atkin, 2003). This expan-\nsion has been attributed to different circumstances, such as\nthe boom in consumption, the aging of the population or the\ntrend of body worship, and the consumption of information\nand products on beauty, nutrition, and aesthetics (Pe\u00f1afiel,\nThe usefulness, or service, provided by such media con-\ntent on health and wellness appears to be closely linked to\ntheir preventive and educational function (Scott, 1987). It is\na question of placing emphasis on the need to act before dis-\neases occur, laying the foundations so that society incorpo-\nrates healthy habits into its lifestyle, insofar as \"preventive\nmeasures contribute necessary advice to avoid contracting\npossible thanks to the use of an easily understandable lan-\nguage with the aim of informing, interpreting, and explain-\ning the facts clearly and impartially.\nThis article analyzes the information and advertising on\nhealth and wellness in non\u00addaily free magazines, aimed at\nthe general public and published in Spain, with a clearly\n1University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Department of Journalism,\nBarrio Sarriena, Leioa, Biscay, Spain\nCorresponding Author:\nAinara Larrondo Ureta, Senior Lecturer, Department of Journalism,\nGureiker Research Group, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU),\nEmail: ainara.larrondo@ehu.eus\nFeatures and Dimensions of Health Care\nJournalism: A Case Study on Spanish Free\nMagazines\nAinara Larrondo Ureta1 and Teresa Santos Diez1\n Keywords\nhealth care, journalism, magazines, education, Spain\n2 SAGE Open\neducational and preventive intention. These are magazines\nthat readers request free of charge, typically distributed in\nbulk to hospitals, pharmacies, nursing homes, sports centers,\nand other public locations linked to health and wellness.\nPreviously published research on health journalism dif-\nfers from our main objective, as it examines the coverage of\nhealth issues either from the viewpoint of specialized profes-\nsional publications or from the perspective of periodical pub-\nlications aimed at the general public that are not free of\nSeale, 2003). Although it is true that there have been numer-\nous studies on free-distribution publications aimed at the\nies have analyzed media content on free health publications,\nat least not with a direct approach to the question (Mart\u00ednez,\nThat is why this research aims to contribute to filling a\nvacuum and to deepening understanding of this phenomenon\non health media content. With this purpose, the study consid-\nered the following specific research questions:\nResearch Question 1: What are the characteristics of\nfree-distribution health and wellness magazines?\nResearch Question 2: Do these free magazines promote\ngenuine health journalism?\nResearch Question 3: What is their significance from the\nviewpoint of the health-focused advertising and manage-\nment strategy?\nThis study is of interest due to the current need to under-\nstand the keys to the communicative phenomenon of free\nmagazines with health content. Not only in the media context\nof the web, where there has been a proliferation of content on\nhealth in recent years, but most especially in the traditional\nfield of the printed press, an area conditioned by a business\nmodel in crisis that is acquiring particular features in the case\nof the free press.\nSpecifically, this research on the process of elaborating\ninformation on health and wellness has taken account of the\nneed of determining the role played by the publications ana-\nlyzed as an instrument that channels the interest of citizens in\nhealth questions.\nThe main hypothesis of the research suggests that the free\ndistribution of these publications determines a distinctive\neducational and preventive approach closely related to an\nadvertising and marketing aim and, in general, to the sales\nobjectives of those companies related to health from a gen-\neral point of view (pharmaceutical, health tourism, services\nfor the third age, etc.). In this sense, their content offers\ninformation on general aspects, but in a proportion that\nmakes it possible to fill the existing vacuum in health cover-\nage in the general press. The study, thus, considers other\npremises, such as the importance of specialized advertising\nfor the survival of printed publications in times of crisis, in\ncontrast to the sustained and growing consumption of web-\nsites carrying information on health.\nStudy Case Description and Context\nIn the light of the objectives and hypothesis described above,\nthe study consisted in analyzing three free health care maga-\nzines with less than a decade of existence--El Peri\u00f3dico de\nla Farmacia (The Pharmacy Newspaper; 2005), Estar Bien\naudited by the PGD (Publicaciones Gratuitas Ejemplares\nDistribuibles), the Spanish Office of Free Publications and\nDistributable Copies1 (Table 1). In this respect, similar pub-\nlications that were not audited by the PGD were omitted,\nsuch as Farmaex (2002), a publication distributed in the\nregion of Extremadura.\nIn December 2005, the Publishing Group Sanidad\nEdiciones, S.L. (Saned) and the distributor Cofares launched\nEl Peri\u00f3dico de la Farmacia. This publication is distributed\nin some 13,000 pharmacies, although its content is also\navailable in an online edition. When this magazine first came\nout it had an average of 48 pages per month, although\n2012, it carried out another adjustment and began to publish\nonly 16 pages per month. El Peri\u00f3dico de la Farmacia came\nper month in 2012, as certified by the PGD.\nThis publication has six main sections--disorders,\nhealthy mind, better to prevent, learn to, women's health, and\nexercise. The greater part of its informative content covers\neverything related to women's health, especially from the\npoint of view of the most common diseases and the most\ninnovative diagnostic techniques. In fact, in its readers' pro-\nfile, there is a predominance of women (66%) in comparison\nwith men (33%), with an age group of readers between 35\nand 54 years. It is also relevant that 63% of its readers take\nthe journal home, which raises the audience figure to 4.29\nreaders per copy. Besides being monitored by the PGD, this\npublication belongs to the Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de la Prensa\nGratuita (AEPG; Spanish Free Press Association). In the\nyear 2015, El Peri\u00f3dico de la Farmacia began to be distrib-\nuted monthly, and finally closed in December. As stated by\nits editor, Alicia Mart\u00ednez, this magazine was the leader in\nthe sector in 2011 according to the OJD (Oficina de\nJustificaci\u00f3n de la Difusi\u00f3n, Circulation Audit Bureau). As\nthe interviewed pointed out, this magazine aims to offer a\nservice to those communities in which it is distributed, main-\ntaining a good relationship with different agents, such as\nnonprofit organizations. The journal Estar Bien, published\nby Contenidos e Informaci\u00f3n de Salud, S.L. until April 2014\nand by Wecare-U from this date onward, was first published\nLarrondo and Santos 3\nvery wide network of distribution points, in the last years this\nmagazine reduced these to pharmacies and centers where\nsporting activities were practiced. Its print run in 2012 was\nand its number of pages per month fell to 32, until its\nclosure.\nAccording to data obtained from the in-depth interview\nwith its editor, Luc\u00eda Barrera, Estar Bien can be considered\nas the \"first health newspaper\" with \"information inviting\nyou to improve the quality of life and enjoyment of leisure.\"\nThe aim of this magazine is to reach the entire public through\nstrategic points. In fact, as the interviewee pointed out, its\nlaunch sought \"a new form of understanding information on\nhealth,\"', as it was \"a newspaper that tackled wellness in its\nwidest sense, from the prevention of disease to care and the\npromotion of healthy habits. These were our principles.\"\nEstar Bien came out with a weekly periodicity and a national\ncopies that were distributed in hospitals, hotels, health\nresorts, pharmacies, and much-frequented places, like means\nof transport. From 2012 onward, the publishing company\ndecided to concentrate the publication at strategic points like\nfitness and wellness centers, and pharmacies. In fact, in\nJanuary 2012, the publication defined itself as a \"free maga-\nzine on lifestyle.\" In the words of Barrera, the change at this\nstage went further than what can be seen at first sight. From\nthis time onward, the publication gave increasing importance\nto strategies of transversal collaboration with other media\nlike the Intereconom\u00eda television channel, as well as to strat-\negies on social networks, especially on Twitter and Facebook.\nIn its pages, Estar Bien includes the following sections:\ncommunication, looking after yourself well, menus, drinks,\nsport, feeling well, prevention, living well, and travel. With\nrespect to the profile of its readers, the majority of its public\nwith higher education. This reader type is concerned about\nbodily well-being, regularly practices some type of sport,\ntravels, and consumes beauty products. She or he dedicates\napproximately 28 min to reading Estar Bien, and 60% decide\nto take the copy home.\nThe third publication analyzed, Salud 21 de la Regi\u00f3n de\nMurcia, was launched in March 2008, with a fortnightly\nperiodicity and a print run of 26,000 copies, on the initia-\ntive of the company Ediciones Vitalidad y Progreso, S.L.\nAccording to its editor, Alfonso Celestino, this magazine\nhas managed to maintain its print run at 29,000 copies. In\n2014, its number of pages increased and from then on it has\npublished between 64 and 80 pages. This magazine carries\nout most of its distribution at the entrances of the big hospi-\ntals in Murcia with the aim of reaching health personnel\nand patients. The promoter interviewed defined this maga-\nzine as a health newspaper, whereas its front page currently\ndescribes it as \"The newspaper of wellness.\" As in the case\nof Estar Bien, an evolution can be seen in the concept and\naims pursued by this publication, distributed in health-\nrelated centers--public and private hospitals, health insur-\ners, old people's homes, hotels, health resorts, and\npharmacies in urban areas of Murcia. Starting in May 2010,\nSalud 21 diversified its business toward sectors related to\nthe trade in medical, orthopedic, optical equipment and\ninstruments, cosmetics, hygiene, and herbal remedies. Like\nthe other publications of this type, Salud 21 also has a web\nedition that is updated weekly.\nSeveral criteria were followed in the process of testing the\nrepresentativeness of the publications examined. First, the\nstudy considers all the free health care magazines published\nin Spain with quality control auditing (PGD).\nTable 1.

Elaborated by the authors using information from the Data from the PGD Office (Publicaciones Gratuitas Ejemplares Distribuibles), the Spanish\nOffice of Free Publications and Distributable Copies.\n4 SAGE Open\nSpecifically, the media studied are classified as periodical\nprinted publications of thematic interest (health and well-\nness), whose aims are focused on the general public (custom-\ners of pharmacies, hospital patients, and residents of old\npeople's homes), made available to the public at regular\nintervals of time, with the same title, in a continuous series,\nwith the date and correlative numbering. This characteriza-\ntion makes it possible to differentiate the publications exam-\nined from others that are apparently similar in their subject\nand aims, but very different due to their classification. Such\nis the case of publications that are classified differently as\n\"pharmacy periodicals,\" which is the case with Consejos de\ntu Farmac\u00e9utico (Advice From Your Chemist), published by\nthe Grupo Difusiones Tecnol\u00f3gicas de Mercado (DTM). In\naddition, the publications selected are differentiated from\nothers with a greater degree of specialization, as they are\npublications aimed at an expert and professional public.\nBesides their large print run and their diffusion being\naudited by the PGD, the publications were considered\naccording to the following indicators:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Characteristics of their promoters: These are consoli-\ndated companies with a wide presence and experience\nin the publishing sector on health, with specialized\npublications both for qualified health personnel and,\nin the case of the publications analyzed in this article,\nfor the general public.3\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 They represent different geographical settings, that is,\nnational and regional coverage.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Easy access by the public, given that they are free and\ndistributed through pharmacies and other centers\nrelated to health.\nIt is important to call attention to the fact that the maga-\nthe economic crisis was already a reality at the world level\nand was causing a clear fall in advertising investment, which\nplaced publishing companies in a difficult situation. Even so,\nwhile the free general information newspapers were obliged\nby market contingencies to close delegations, sack person-\nnel, reduce the number of their pages, and print run, the pub-\nlications examined have managed to survive and remain on\nthe market by taking certain measures--concentration of dis-\ntribution points in strategic zones of cities, cutting costs,\nlengthening the periodicity of distribution, and reduction in\nthe number of fixed pages.\nSampling and Method\nThis study considers a sample of issues published in different\nphases, between the months of August 2012 and August\nple procedure aimed to analyze representative issues from\ntwo relevant phases: The first phase refers to a moment of\nordinary development and circulation, whereas the second\none refers to the opening of a period of crisis, due to several\nfactors considered in the study and explained below. In total,\ndivided as follows: El Peri\u00f3dico de la Farmacia (22 issues,\nde la Regi\u00f3n de Murcia (53 issues, 1,624 pages). These three\npublications represent free press models that have been able\nto adapt to market circumstances, constantly seeking more\nadequate solutions to subsist. Some of them have also shown\na thematic and functional evolution, such as Estar Bien,\nwhich has progressed from being considered a health maga-\nzine to one focused on \"lifestyle.\"\nMethodologically, the study adopted the qualitative and\ndescriptive technique of content analysis (Hsieh & Shannon,\npublished texts in a systematic and objective way, as well as\nfor quantifying the materials of the research To apply this\nqualitative procedure, we opted for the case study, with the\nunderstanding that this analytical form is more suitable for\nobtaining an in-depth understanding of what is subjected to\nresearch, and also due to its validity for establishing general\nWith the purpose of completing the main results of the\nstudy, other qualitative techniques were applied, such as\nsemistructured interviews with those in charge of these pub-\nlications. Interviews were carried out with the editors of the\nfree-distribution publications analyzed. Questions were\nrelated to the characteristics of these publications, such as\ntheir aims, objectives, and financing, as well as to other ques-\ntions, such as their relationship with advertisers and their\ngeneral viewpoint on the sector of free-distribution publica-\ntions and health.\nThe analysis was also completed by consulting different\nsources like the AEPG and the PGD)of the OJD, as well as\ndifferent documents such as health reports, reports by official\nbodies, and other sources related to the question.\nThe information or media content was codified according\nto 13 representative thematic categories related to health and\nwellness: general health, specialized women's health, spe-\ncialized men's health, specialized children's health, special-\nized third age health, agenda, current affairs on news,\nnutrition, beauty and wellness, psychiatry/psychology, lei-\nsure, sports, and others (Table 2). Following the same line,\nadvertising was analyzed on the basis of the following cate-\ngories: medicines, nutrition, beauty, reforms, clinics, sales,\ninstitutional, vehicles, banks, telephony, funerary, old peo-\nple's homes, lawyers, leisure, clairvoyance, orthopedic, and\nself-advertising.\nResults\nAlthough all the front pages of the publications analyzed\ndeal with health content, their approaches vary significantly\n(Table 2). Thus, in El Peri\u00f3dico de la Farmacia, questions\nrelated to alimentation and beauty stand out in equal\nLarrondo and Santos 5\nproportion, although questions dedicated to women's health\nare the priority. Estar Bien also prioritizes alimentation, as\nwell as questions of psychiatry and psychology, with a\ngreater proportion than the other publications. In Salud 21,\ncurrent affairs in health account for the greatest percentage\nof content.\nTo achieve the publication's educational aim, and so\nthat its message on health reaches a nonspecialized gen-\neral public with clarity and without creating confusion or\nfalse expectations, it is important for there to be qualified\npersonnel in the newsroom. This is the only way to ensure\nthat the information is rigorous and focuses on basic ques-\ntions, excluding irrelevant data that might lead to sensa-\ntionalism or create false expectations in the audience. In\nthis context, the journalist's role must be focused on\n\"reporting with the peculiarities of health language, char-\nacterized by the technical terms of the scientific area,\" but\nmaking it into a language that is understandable to the\npublic in general.\nWith respect to the authorship of the news reports (Table\n3), only in El Peri\u00f3dico de la Farmacia is the authorship of\nthe information not given in any cases, in spite of the fact that\nthe group that publishes it, Saned, has over 50 professionals\nand 400 external collaborators, including specialists in com-\nmunication, \"medical writers,\" experts in marketing, health\nmanagers, designers, and programmers. News agencies only\nhave a significant presence in Salud 21.\nAs Table 4 shows, the magazines examined provide\nhealthy guidelines and habits with suggestions aimed at\nimproving frequent health problems and diseases like osteo-\nporosis, rheumatism, osteoarthritis or lower back pain, sleep-\ning problems, obesity and how to deal with it through\nbalanced diets, exercise, and, as a last resort, surgical inter-\nvention. Regardless of the ailment they are dealing with, they\ndescribe the disease, risk factors, symptoms, prevention, and\nrecommendations.\nWomen's health is considered by dealing with the different\nstages of their lives. Particular attention is given to gyneco-\nlogical specialties (assisted reproduction, pregnancy, meno-\npause, etc.). Salud 21 dedicated a special 11-page monograph\nto such content. The specific ailments of men are also cov-\nered, although to a lesser degree. Specific guidelines and\ninformation are included for elderly people dealing with the\ncharacteristic ailments of that age, such as dementia, dental\nhealth problems, infectious processes, cardiovascular altera-\ntions, osteoarthritis, and pain--the most frequent reasons for\nmedical consultations among the population over 65 years.\nThe content of Salud 21 is directed at older people, and it\nis thus not surprising that its pages deal with these frequent\ndiseases with instructions on how to prevent them or improve\ntheir condition. Nor is the childhood stage ignored, with\nadvice and suggestions for preventing diseases.\nThe diary of events and organizations is also a service\nworth highlighting in this type of publications. Salud 21 pro-\nvides a complete guide to associations of people with ail-\nments, like Adirmu (diabetes), On-Off Association\n(Parkinson's disease), Asociaci\u00f3n de Ayuda al Enfermo\nRenal (ADAER) (renal patients), Asociaci\u00f3n Murciana Virus\nInmunodeficiencia Humana (AMUVIH) (HIV patients),\nMultiple Sclerosis, among others. In addition, it provides\nnumerous addresses of health centers and hospitals in the\nprovince.\nIn the texts analyzed, all aspects of nutrition and alimenta-\ntion are dealt with; advice on a balanced diet is provided, but\nthe need for support from a health professional is taken into\nconsideration. This content shows the health benefits con-\ntributed by fruits and vegetables, among other foodstuffs.\nAlso included are recommendations from experts for reduc-\ning arterial inflammation. This content is completed with\ncookery recipes, which include the ingredients needed to\nfeed four people, the steps to follow throughout the process,\nand necessary observations for elaborating the dishes.\nTable 2.

Elaborated by the authors.\n6 SAGE Open\nIn addition, all the publications show an interest in current\nhealth innovation, such as new techniques being applied in\nsurgical operations and new treatments.\nWith respect to current health issues, content is adapted\nto the season in all the publications analyzed, which show\ndisorders and diseases related to the time of year con-\ncerned. They provide detailed explanations of their pathol-\nogy, accompanied by guidelines and recommendations\nwith the causes, symptoms, and ways of preventing disor-\nders, such as spring asthenia, for example. In summer,\nadvice is given on how to combat heat and thirst with a\ncompendium of recommendations and suggestions for the\nseason, such as natural remedies for reducing the amount\nof body sweat, refreshing oneself to satisfy thirst when the\nsun is hottest, the importance of good hydration, and car-\ning for the skin protecting it from the sun, thus avoiding\nmelanomas and patches. In autumn, recommendations are\ngiven on the use of exfoliating creams and moisturizers to\nreduce the risk of suffering from different lesions. In win-\nter, flu and cold are a recurrent topic. They include\nsymptoms and the most used medicines, like analgesics,\nantipyretics, decongestants, and antihistamines. Relevant\ndates like New Year are also considered.\nIn the section on beauty, there is concern for the skin with\nnatural active products and vitamins to mitigate stains and\nimperfections. Psychiatry and psychology also find a space\nin their pages. Guidelines are given that can help in overcom-\ning difficult moments in life and raising morale. Attention is\ngiven to situations of stress and disorders like anxiety,\ndepressions, obsessions, and other pathologies, which might\nbe due to the current crisis and require specific therapies. The\npages of the publications are completed with other issues of\ncurrent interest in society, like ecology.\nAnalysis of the advertising in the publications of the sam-\nple provides dissimilar results, as can be seen in Table 5. While\nthe majority of the advertising in El Peri\u00f3dico de la Farmacia\nis about medicines, in Estar Bien the greater number of adver-\ntisements is related to nutrition and aesthetics. With specific\nreference to advertisements on medicines, it should be recalled\nthat the publisher of El Peri\u00f3dico de la Farmacia belongs to\nthe pharmaceutical sector and distributes this publication in\npharmacies. This type of advertising focuses on medicines for\nTable 3. Authorship of Content (%).\nArticle II.

In Salud 21, advertising\nfor medicines, nutrition, and beauty accounts for a small minor-\nity, as opposed to advertisements for clinics, orthopedics, and\nreforms, which are nonexistent in the case of the other two pub-\nlications.Also characteristic of Salud 21 is advertising that spe-\ncializes in equipment and systems for assisting problems of\nreduced mobility that are characteristic of the third age (scoot-\ners, wheelchairs, lifts, articulated beds, etc.). Also outstanding\nin Salud 21 is advertising on old people's homes, funeral, and\njuridical services, as well as advertising on product sales (digi-\ntal tension meters, 20 language translators, television surveil-\nlance sets, steam cleaners, etc.). As Table 5 shows, in the three\npublications, the majority of the advertising specializing in\nmedicine focuses on the common cold (head, lower back,\njoints, etc.) and sight (opticians, medicines, eye drops, etc.).\nAdvertising plays a decisive role in the publications in our\nstudy as a source of funding. Not for nothing is the Grupo\nSaned, the publisher of El Peri\u00f3dico de la Farmacia, a global\nservices company, responsible for advising and training\nhealth professionals. For its part, Cofares, the distributor of El\nPeri\u00f3dico de la Farmacia, is a leader in pharmaceutical mar-\nketing in Spain, with over 4,500 pharmacies as clients and\n9,654 pharmacists as cooperation partners, with a turnover in\nde Salud, S.L., the publisher of Estar Bien, is a novel business\nmodel, which works in research and in the creation, consul-\ntancy, design, and publishing of information related\nto the sciences of health, medicine, bioscience, pharmacy,\nveterinary science, and other related professions. Starting in\nMay 2010, the company Ediciones Vitalidad y Progreso, S.L.,\nresponsible for Salud 21 de la Regi\u00f3n de Murcia, diversified\nits business toward sectors related to the retail marketing of\nmedical, orthopedic, optical, photographic instruments and\ncosmetic products (Table 6).\nDiscussion and Final Remarks\nFollowing the main hypothesis of the study, the results\nobtained make it possible to conclude that the free-distribution\npublications on health and wellness aimed at the general pub-\nlic to fulfill a priority aim: to support the activities of their\nparent companies in fields outside publishing, directly through\nadvertising (medicines, products for the third age, etc.) and\nindirectly by educating the public, and arousing its interesting\nin such questions that are directly related to \"quality of life.\"\nAdvertising in these publications provides important sup-\nport for products related to a healthy life. As occurs in the\ncase of the main content, we can also note differences among\nthe publications in the case of advertising. Thus, El Peri\u00f3dico\nde la Farmacia mainly dedicates its advertising space to\nmedicines, whereas Estar Bien gives priority to products\nrelated to nutrition, and Salud 21 to advertising on clinics\nand old people's homes.\nWithin the general treatment that the publications analyzed\ngive to questions related to health, it is possible to observe\nslight specializations that give a particular personality to each\nof these media. Although the publications examined dedicate\ntheir pages to questions related to health, it is difficult to find a\ntopic that attains a similar index of presence in the three\nTable 5.

Elaborated by the authors.\n8 SAGE Open\npublications. Thus, differences can be noted with respect to\nthe agenda of the main content, both on the front and inner\npages. While El Peri\u00f3dico de la Farmacia pays special atten-\ntion to nutrition and beauty, Estar Bien gives priority to nutri-\ntion and questions of psychiatry and psychology, and Salud 21\nhighlights current health issues. The content they include is\nclearly useful, as they provide healthy guidelines and habits,\nwith suggestions and standards aimed at making life better.\nThis usefulness is also shown in content aimed at performing\na preventive function. With respect to the thematic preferences\nof these publications, there is also a noticeable tendency in El\nPeri\u00f3dico de la Farmacia and Estar Bien to increasingly\nequate health with wellness or quality of life.\nThe publications analyzed emerged in the midst of the\neconomic recession and, with the exception of Salud 21, they\nhave not managed to subsist in the print market unlike other\nfree-distribution publications, which is very interesting. The\nsurvival of Salud 21 has been possible through adaptations\n(print run, periodicity, etc.), although it is still too soon to\nknow if these measures will continue to be effective in the\nlong-term. In this respect, their online versions seem to be\nthe solution. In their online versions, the three publications\nhave continued to exist, and they have sufficient potential to\ndevelop a specific type of publication defined by greater\ndynamism, thematic breadth, and interactivity.\nIn line with what the editors noted, journalistic content on\nhealth aims to provide answers, offer guidelines, and provide\norientation to the reader facing a problem that directly affects\nhis or her life. Stated in other words, this is content that edu-\ncates the population on health, with messages that are educa-\ntional and useful.Thus, the general interest of the publications\nthat form our object of study lies in their presenting content\nthat is immediately useful to people, that serves to help in\ndaily life, encompassed in what is known as \"service journal-\nism.\" One decisive factor is that these publications deal with\ndiseases and ailments that are suffered by a very significant\npart of the population and that receive special recognition\nthrough World Days. As a suggestion for future research, we\npropose widening this type of analysis to other media like the\nradio and television, which will also make it possible to carry\nout comparative studies.\nOne of the main keys to the emergence of the publications\nstudied lies in their offering content related to health that\nclosely concerns the reader, employing positive approaches\nthat also have an educational aim, even if they entail a mar-\nketing or advertising aim. The increase in information on\nquestions related to health in recent decades would thus be\ngiving a new boost to periodical publications dealing with\nthese issues, as well as to health-sector advertising.\nNevertheless, as a final summary, and in accordance with\nthe main hypothesis, the study highlights the great influence of\nadvertising and marketing in health journalism. This seems to\nbe specially significant in the case of free-distribution publica-\ntions that are committed to providing educational and service\ninformation on general and specialized health (women's and\nmen's health, etc.), as, for such publications, the decrease in\nsales does not represent a sword of Damocles. In fact, in view\nof the study results, it is possible to conclude that the publica-\ntions analyzed are presented to the public as being concerned\nwith health education and service, while their purely marketing\nand advertising aims are concealed. Continuous changes in\nperiodicity and number of pages clearly evidence this lack of\ncommitment to service information and, in contrast, a consider-\nable preference for doing business through advertising.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article:\nTable 6.
