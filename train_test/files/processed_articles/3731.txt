    "abstract": "Abstract\nMedicare Advantage (MA) has grown rapidly since the Affordable Care Act; nearly one-third of Medicare beneficiaries now\nchoose MA. An assessment of the comparative value of the 2 options is confounded by an apparent selection bias favoring\nMA, as reflected in mortality differences. Previous assessments have been hampered by lack of access to claims diagnosis data\nfor the MA population. An indirect comparison of mortality as an outcome variable was conducted by modeling mortality\non a traditional fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare data set, applying the model to an MA data set, and then evaluating the ratio\nof actual-to-predicted mortality in the MA data set. The mortality model adjusted for clinical conditions and demographic\nfactors. Model development considered the effect of potentially greater coding intensity in the MA population. Further\nanalysis calculated ratios for subpopulations. Predicted, risk-adjusted mortality was lower in the MA population than in FFS\nMedicare. However, the ratio of actual-to-predicted mortality (0.80) suggested that the individuals in the MA data set were\nless likely to die than would be predicted had those individuals been enrolled in FFS Medicare. Differences between actual and\npredicted mortality were particularly pronounced in low income (dual eligibility), nonwhite race, high morbidity, and Health\nMaintenance Organization (HMO) subgroups. After controlling for baseline clinical risk as represented by claims diagnosis data,\nmortality differences favoring MA over FFS Medicare persisted, particularly in vulnerable subgroups and HMO plans. These\nfindings suggest that differences in morbidity do not fully explain differences in mortality between the 2 programs.\n",

A recent systematic review published by the Kaiser\nFamily Foundation described the evidence regarding the\nrelative impact of MA on actual objective health outcomes\nand mortality as outdated and characterized by insufficient\ncontrol for selection bias.3 Some studies comparing mortal-\nity and/or switching rates between MA and FFS Medicare\nhave concluded that differences suggest selection bias\nfavorable to MA, but authors have also acknowledged that\nthe lack of publicly available claims diagnosis data for the\nMA population limits comparisons between the 2 popula-\ntions.

Mendes, Actuarial--Corporate Division, Humana Inc,\nEmail: smendes@humana.com\nself-reported morbidity data collected through the 1996 and\n1998 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey.\nThe present study compared mortality between the MA\npopulation covered by Humana Inc, a large health and well-\nness company with more than 1.9 million MA enrollees as of\nMedicare sample with correction for selection bias through\nadjustment for chronic conditions and demographic factors,\nwith consideration of the potential for bias due to greater\ncoding intensity in MA plans. Further analysis calculated\nratios for subgroups. The study builds on previous research\nby conducting an evaluation from a recent time frame and\nwith adjustment for morbidity.\nMethods\nModeling Design\nAn indirect comparison of mortality between MA and FFS\nMedicare was conducted by modeling person-level mortality\non an FFS Medicare data set, applying the model to an MA\ndata set, and then evaluating the ratio of actual-to-predicted\nmortality rates in the MA data set. The predicted MA mortal-\nity rate would represent the probability of mortality if the\nindividuals were enrolled in FFS Medicare, that is, the rate\nthat one would expect to observe if enrollment in MA had no\nimpact on mortality.\nData Source and Populations\nThe FFS Medicare data comprised 5% Limited Data Set\nsamples from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS),\nsamples represented 4\nused from the MA data set were equivalent to those available\nin the FFS Medicare data set. The MA sample represented\nrecent data available at the time the study was initiated.\nMortality data were derived from CMS denominator files for\nthe FFS Medicare data set and from CMS Monthly\nMembership Reports for the MA data set. Individuals with\nend-stage renal disease (ESRD), non-US residence, Medicare\nsecondary coverage, a group Medicare plan, or recognizably\nmissing data were excluded.\nAs this study was conducted as part of the insurer's nor-\nmal business operations, it did not meet the Department of\nHealth and Human Service's regulatory definition of research\ndid not require institutional review board approval or a\nHealth Insurance Portability andAccountabilityAct (HIPAA)\nexemption--either for analysis of the insurer's MA data or\nfor analysis of the CMS 5% Limited Dataset. The authors\nhave access to patient identifying information in the insurer's\nMA claims and enrollment databases through the course of\ntheir daily job responsibilities and have accessed such data to\ncomplete this work. Corporate policy forbids analysts from\naccessing more than the minimum protected health informa-\ntion (PHI) data necessary to fulfill specific business needs.\nPatient confidentiality is further protected by avoiding the\nreporting of data for subgroups with 10 or fewer individuals.\nThe FFS data, provided in a CMS 5% Limited Dataset, were\nde-identified. In addition, the data use agreement with CMS\nadditionally required that aggregate data be reported for no\nfewer than 11 individuals.\nModel Development and Analysis\nIn the first step, the FFS Medicare data set was partitioned\ninto 3 independent groups: a calibration (derivation) set\nand 2 testing sets, designed to all be comparable with\nrespect to average calculated CMS risk score. The predic-\ntor variables in CMS risk score models are Hierarchical\nCondition Categories (HCCs), which are based on prior-\nyear claims and reflect diagnosis as well as severity, and\nseveral demographic factors. The CMS model for the risk\nscore considered in this study was based on a set of 70\nHCCs (see Table 1).\nNext, a logistic regression model was designed, using\nSAS Enterprise Guide 5.1, to define the probability of death\nin a given year for the calibration group in the FFS Medicare\ndata set. Demographics, Medicare eligibility characteristics,\nmorbidity data (chronic conditions, CMS risk score, HCC\ncount), and prior-year claims dollars (as a proxy for health\nrisk) were considered for inclusion in the model as covariates\n(predictor variables).\nEach possible predictor variable was considered for its\npotential to create bias in the model. As risk-adjusted pay-\nments create an incentive for MA plans to more completely\ndocument beneficiary diagnoses than is typical in FFS\nMedicare, inclusion of diagnosis-based variables as model\npredictors might elevate predicted mortality in the MA data\nset and thus artificially reduce the actual-to-predicted mor-\ntality ratio, creating a bias in favor of MA. To reduce this\npotential bias, CMS risk score was omitted from the list of\nvariables eligible for the model. However, a variable for an\nindividual's total number of HCCs (HCC count) remained\neligible for the model, as did several variables reflecting the\npresence of chronic or acute conditions (see Table 1).\nVariables for diabetes and renal disease were omitted because\nof pending changes with respect to these disease areas in the\nCMS HCC model.9 Next, a forward stepwise selection pro-\ncess was used to determine which of the eligible variables\nwould be included in the final model. Each variable was\nassessed for contribution to the overall model fit using the\nresidual chi-square test with a significance requirement of\nP = .05. Of the variables considered, only heart arrhythmia\nand panel year were omitted from the final model. In the\nfinal model, each variable had a P value <.01 according to\nthe chi-square test.\nBeveridge et al 3\nA final sensitivity analysis was then conducted by assess-\ning the accuracy of models with different combinations of\nvariables. The final model with the retained condition vari-\nables plus HCC count had greater accuracy at the individual\nlevel (80.2% concordance) than that of a model with the\nchronic conditions only (78.7% concordance) and that of a\nmodel with demographic variables only (71.2% concor-\ndance). Furthermore, the actual-to-predicted ratio in the\nmodel with condition variable plus HCC count was less\nfavorable to MA (ratio, 0.8042) than the model with demo-\ngraphics only (ratio, 0.7875). Thus, inclusion of the selected\nmorbidity measures actually yielded a more conservative\nestimate of MA-FFS differences, despite potential coding\nbias. The tau-c statistic for the final model was 0.809, which\nsignified a relatively strong association between predicted\nand actual mortality rates.\nAlthough prior-year claims dollars was considered as a\npredictive variable, it was ruled out due to its potential as a\nsource of bias. While prior-year spending has been shown to\nbe a good predictor of morbidity, differences in spending\nbetween MA and FFS Medicare would be confounded by\ndifferences in reimbursement models, types of benefits, and\nout-of-pocket spending caps.\nAfter selection of the predictor variables, the model was fit\nsented in Table 1. The resulting odds ratios for the calibration\ngroup are presented inTable S1 in the Supplementary Material.\nWhen applied to the first FFS Medicare testing group,\nthe model produced an actual-to-predicted mortality ratio\npredictions were off only by 49 deaths, producing a Z score\nof 0.21. The actual-to-predicted ratios by subgroup (eg,\nsubgroups defined by HCC count or gender) were checked\nto assure that the model maintained group-level accuracy\nacross the subgroups as well as for the overall testing group.\nthe extremes being tied to relatively small subgroups), and\n37 of 40 Z scores were within 2 standard deviations. Given\nthese indications of group-level accuracy in the first testing\ngroup, the model was not tested in the second testing group.\nA plot showing model accuracy at various levels of pre-\ndicted mortality is included in Figure S1 in the\nSupplementary Material. This revealed some bias for indi-\nviduals at the highest level of predicted mortality, but with\na good model fit overall.\nFinally, the resulting model was applied to the MA data\nset to yield the expected mortality rate had the MA enroll-\nees been in FFS Medicare. Additional analysis was con-\nducted according to subgroups defined by gender, age,\nrace, dual eligibility in the prior year, HCC count, plan\ntype, duration of Medicare eligibility, and the basis of eli-\ngibility for Medicare (age or disability). The statistical sig-\nnificance of the difference between actual and predicted\nmortality overall and within each subgroup was assessed\nby Z scores.\nTable 1.

FFS\nMedicare participants were more likely to have dual eligibility\nmore heavily concentrated in the South (64% vs 40% of FFS\nMedicare participants). More than 66% of MA participants\nwere in newer, non-HMO plan types. Population characteris-\ntics are presented in Table S2 of the Supplementary Material.\nPredicted Versus Actual Mortality in MA\nWhen the mortality regression model was applied to the MA\ndata set, predicted mortality was 3.7%, whereas actual mortal-\nity was 2.9% (P < .001 for the difference). These results com-\npare with both a predicted and an actual rate of 4.3%\nence in predicted mortality between MA and FFS Medicare\n(3.7% vs 4.3%) suggests that the MA members were healthier,\nwhich could explain the lower actual mortality in the MA pop-\nulation versus FFS Medicare (2.9% vs 4.3%). Nevertheless, the\nMA participants were less likely to die in a 1-year time frame\nthan would have been expected for individuals with a similar\nrisk profile enrolled in FFS Medicare. These results suggest\nthat factors other than demographics and morbidity are respon-\nsible for mortality differences.\nDemographic Subgroups\nActual-to-predicted mortality ratios were lower (more favor-\nable to MA) in individuals above the age of 50 compared\nwith younger members and lower in women compared with\nmen, but ratios favored MA in both women and men. All\nsubgroups with known race had actual mortality rates that\nwere lower than predicted. Compared with the white sub-\ngroup, nonwhite subgroups (black, other) exhibited consid-\nerably lower actual-to-predicted ratios even though predicted\nmortality was comparable between the black and white sub-\ngroups. The actual-to-predicted ratio was also lower in the\nsubgroup with dual eligibility in the prior year, compared\nwith other participants (see Table 2).\nBeveridge et al 5\nMorbidity Subgroups\nThe difference between actual and expected mortality was\nmore pronounced among those individuals with the highest\nmorbidity, as represented by number of HCCs. Members\nwithout any HCCs had low and similar predicted and actual\nmortality rates. As the number of HCCs increased, both\nactual and predicted mortality increased, but actual mortality\nincreased more gradually so that the absolute difference\nbetween them grew. Relative differences, expressed as\nactual-to-predicted ratios, consistently favored MA in indi-\nviduals with an HCC count 1 (see Figure 1).\nSubgroups Defined by Plan Type and Eligibility\nCharacteristics\nIndividuals with Local Preferred Provider Organization (LPPO)\nand Regional Preferred Provider Organization (RPPO) plan\ntypes had the lowest actual and predicted mortality rates. Those\nwith an HMO plan had the highest predicted mortality but the\nlowest actual-to-predicted ratio, suggesting that the greatest\neffect relative to FFS Medicare occurred in HMO plans. The\nPrivate Fee-For-Service (PFFS) subgroup showed the least dif-\nference between actual and predicted mortality. Actual-to-\npredicted mortality ratios were lower in members who had been\neligible for Medicare for more than 1 year compared with mem-\nbers who had become eligible in the current year. No difference\nin actual-to-predicted mortality was shown between individuals\nwho qualified for Medicare because of disability and those who\nqualified on the basis of age (see Table 3).\nPost Hoc Analysis\nAs the analysis consistently showed lower than expected\nmortality rates in the MA population, a post hoc analysis\nwas conducted to investigate participation in a relatively\nnew care management service as one possible driver of this\nimprovement. This holistic service is designed for individu-\nals who not only have serious medical needs but who also\nare expected to benefit from assistance with a range of other\nneeds. For the year 2013, the first year of the program with\nsubstantial participation, members who were eligible and\nparticipating in the program experienced a mortality rate\nthat was 3.1 percentage points lower than that for those who\nwere eligible but not participating (6.4% vs 9.5%), while\nboth groups had a similar predicted mortality rate (partici-\npating, 7.3%; not participating, 7.2%). The actual-to-pre-\ndicted ratio for participants favored MA, but the ratio for\neligible nonparticipants did not, suggesting that the benefit\nof MA for this subgroup was mediated through the care ser-\nvice. However, these findings may reflect selection bias as\nparticipation is voluntary, and these early findings may not\nbe replicated as the program matures. Furthermore, the\naccuracy of the model in this subgroup with high morbidity\ncould not be tested during model development because there\nwas no way to identify a comparable subgroup in the FFS\nMedicare data set.\nDiscussion\nActual mortality in the MA data set was less than risk-\nadjusted, expected mortality, both overall and in most sub-\ngroups. Some of the largest differences between actual and\npredicted mortality were observed in certain vulnerable sub-\ngroups defined by race or income, and in HMO plans as\nopposed to PFFS or PPO plans. Although subject to the pos-\nsibility of unmeasured confounders, these findings provide\nan important contribution to the sparse body of literature\nevaluating the relationship between MA participation and\nmortality.\nFigure 1. Mortality by Hierarchical Condition Category count.\nNote. P < .001 for all absolute differences between actual and predicted mortality, except in the subgroup of HCC count 0 (P < 1.000).\nFindings in the Context of Other Research\nOnly 1 other study published since 2000 has compared gen-\neral mortality as an outcome measure between FFS Medicare\nand MA.8 Dowd and colleagues found no difference in 2-year\nmortality between FFS Medicare and MA HMOs when con-\nsidering observed confounders. In contrast, the present study\nsuggested that MA is associated with lower adjusted mortal-\nity. Several aspects of the Dowd study and the present study\nmay explain the discordant findings (Dowd vs present study):\nlargely self-reported versus objective observed confounders,\nson-years, all MA providers versus a single provider, and\nexclusion versus inclusion of individuals in Medicare\nbecause of disability and individuals eligible for Medicaid.\nSome comparative studies have evaluated mortality pri-\nmarily as a baseline indicator of health status rather than as\nan outcome. Krumholz et al found that the difference in mor-\ntality rates between the fee-for service and MA populations\ncompares with an unadjusted difference of 1.4%, also favor-\ning MA, in the present study. Song has shown that as MA\nattracts a greater share of the market, the health status of MA\npopulations improves relative to FFS Medicare populations.7\nThe studies by Krumholz et al and Song suggest the possibil-\nity of a selection bias favoring MA, but in contrast to the\npresent study, neither adjusted for morbidity. The authors of\nboth studies noted that their analysis could not assess the\nextent to which MA plans contribute to the health of their\nmembers as opposed to attracting healthier members.\nUnobserved Confounding and Other Factors\nAffecting Mortality Differences\nmize favorable selection in MA. To the extent that favorable\nselection persists, it may have created bias in the present study\nin favor of MA and thus reduced the actual-to-predicted mor-\ntality ratio. One group investigating the impact of these policy\nchanges has concluded that although some selection bias favor-\ning MAplans remains, it has been substantially reduced.10-13 In\nthe present study, predicted mortality was indeed lower in the\nMA population than in the FFS Medicare population, which\nsuggests that healthier individuals do tend to choose or remain\nin MA. However, the actual-to-predicted mortality ratios sug-\ngested that differences in baseline morbidity do not fully\nexplain mortality differences; that is, either program factors or\npatient factors other than baseline chronic disease are likely\nresponsible for the observed findings favorable to MA.\nVarious aspects of MA plans may explain lower mortality\nrates, such as the use of alternative payment models or empha-\nsis on preventive care and disease management. In this study,\nthe greatest reduction from predicted mortality was in HMO\nplans, which account for the majority of MA participants\nacross all contractors, suggesting that HMO plans are particu-\nlarly effective relative to the other plan types assessed.\nHowever, as the HMO subgroup also had the highest pre-\ndicted mortality, further study is needed to assess whether a\nbenefit was observed in this subgroup simply because MA is\nparticularly effective in less healthy individuals.\nAlternatively, it is possible that the observation of lower\nmortality rate in MA, even after correction for differences in\nmorbidity, reflects unmeasured patient factors that favor\nMA. For example, individuals who choose or stay in MA\nmay have better lifestyle habits or health-seeking behaviors\nthat help them achieve better outcomes even when demo-\ngraphic and clinical factors put them at risk. Interestingly, an\nadditional analysis in the aforementioned study by Dowd\net al8 used novel statistical techniques to adjust for potential\nunobserved as well as observed confounders and showed\n2-year mortality to be lower in MA, whereas analysis based\nonly on observable confounders had shown no difference\nbetween MA and FFS Medicare. Statistical significance\nin the analysis that included unobservable confounders\nTable 3.

Dowd and colleagues described these\nfindings as evidence of a selection bias against MA.8 Other\nexamples of assessing the effect of unmeasured confounders\nin comparisons of MA and FFS Medicare were not identified\nin the literature.\nSome research has suggested that mortality differences\nbetween FFS Medicare and MA reflect the fact that switch-\ning from MA to FFS Medicare is more common than switch-\ning in the reverse direction among individuals in nursing\nhomes or inpatient facilities, that is, among individuals most\nlikely to die in the near term.4 The present study's findings\nneither contradicted nor supported those findings but rather\nshowed that for a given MA panel, mortality was lower than\nmorbidity and demographic risk would predict.\nSubgroups\nImportant findings from this study included evidence that MA\nmay be especially effective in addressing health care dispari-\nties in vulnerable subgroups: nonwhite groups and individu-\nals with low income as reflected by dual eligibility. Previous\nresearch has also suggested relatively greater MA benefits for\nminorities.14,15 These findings are relevant in light of national\npolicy. The Healthy People Initiative of the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) has set a goal of elim-\ninating health disparities by 2020 in groups that are disadvan-\ntaged due to factors such as race/ethnicity, socioeconomic\nstatus, and disability.16 In keeping with these concerns, the\nCMS Office of Minority Health recently released for the first\ntime MA quality data stratified by race/ethnicity.17\nLimitations\nCertain factors may detract from the comparability of the\nMA and FFS Medicare data sets. The Northeast and the West\ngeographic regions were underrepresented in the MA study\npopulation due to low membership in those areas, and the\nFFS Medicare data set was not selected to match the geo-\ngraphic distribution of the MA population. However, a visual\ninspection of state-specific actual mortality rates showed that\nin both the FFS Medicare and MA data sets, states in the\nNortheast and West regions were more likely to have rela-\ntively lower mortality rates. Thus, any bias that might have\nresulted from these geographic differences would likely have\nincreased the observed MA actual-to-predicted mortality\nratio, making results less favorable to MA. In addition, pre-\nvious research has shown that when patients in FFS Medicare\nmoved to another hospital referral region, the increase in the\naverage number of diagnoses was considerably greater if\nthey moved to a region characterized by high-intensity prac-\ntice patterns (reflected in utilization as well as coding).18 If\nthe 2 populations differed with respect to the mix of regions\nwith low-intensity and high-intensity practice patterns, irre-\nspective of whether patients were in FFS Medicare or MA,\nresults could be biased in one direction or the other. The\n3-year time frame differed by 1 year between the 2 data sets,\nbut the authors do not know of a reason this would have sub-\nstantially altered results, given the stability of mortality rates\nin both FFS Medicare and MA in recent years.5 Finally, dual\neligibility status represents a limited means of adjusting for\nsocioeconomic differences between the 2 populations.\nSeveral limitations inherent to study design apply to this\nwork. First, as noted previously, unmeasured confounding\nmay have biased results. Second, some individuals in the MA\ndata set may not have been enrolled long enough for their\nsurvival to be attributable to participation in the plan.\nHowever, as the average tenure within any 1-year panel of\nindividuals in the insurer's MA plans is approximately 4\nyears, findings can reasonably be assumed to reflect an effect\nof participation in MA. The analysis may in fact underesti-\nmate the eventual benefit as the total cumulative enrollment,\nover time, is substantially greater than 4 years for the MA\npopulation evaluated by this study.\nClaims data (whether from FFS Medicare or an MA plan)\nare subject to missing values and incorrect coding, and the\nFFS Medicare sample may have been more likely than the MA\ndata set to have missing morbidity data. The extent of this dis-\ncrepancy is unknown, but selection of predictor variables was\ndesigned to minimize the difference and sensitivity testing,\nusing models with and without morbidity variables, suggested\nthat study results could not be fully attributed to coding bias.\nThe authors acknowledge that the results may not be gener-\nalizable to MApopulations served by other insurers. However,\none advantage of the model derived from the CMS sample is\nthat it can be applied to other MA populations to generate\nactual-to-predicted ratios specific to those populations.\nConclusion\nOverall, this study showed an association between enrollment\nin the insurer's MA plan and reduced mortality after adjust-\nment for demographics and morbidity. The differences\nbetween actual and predicted mortality were particularly pro-\nnounced in low income, nonwhite race, and HMO plan type\nsubgroups. These findings suggest that differences in morbid-\nity do not fully explain differences in mortality between the 2\nprograms. Findings should be interpreted with some caution\nbecause of the previously acknowledged study limitations.\nAdditional research is needed to more directly assess the\neffect of MA on mortality. Longitudinal cohort studies track-\ning concurrent MA and FFS Medicare groups for several\nyears are needed. The apparent greater effect of MA in sub-\npopulations with more chronic disease merits further explo-\nration to identify the operant factors. The impact of duration\nof enrollment on mortality differences might also be explored\nto better assess the plausibility of a causal relationship\nbetween MA participation and reduced mortality. Methods\nfor assessing the effect of selection bias are needed. As the\npresent study applied to a single MA provider's population,\nsimilar analyses in other MA populations are needed to help\nestablish the effect of MA enrollment.\nAuthors' Note\nAt the time the manuscript was completed, Dr Meredith C.
