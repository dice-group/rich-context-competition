Mexican-born\nwomen and men had the smallest waist circumference (90.4 cm, 94.0 cm\nrespectively), US-born English-speaking women and men had intermediate waist\ncircumference (93.6 cm, 97.3 cm), and US-born Spanish-speaking women and\nmen had the largest waist circumference (96.9 cm, 97.7 cm), after accounting for\nage, education, per cent of energy from dietary fat, leisure-time physical activity,\nand smoking. All women had high prevalences of abdominal obesity, particularly\nUS-born Spanish-speaking women (68.7%).

For example, the San\nAntonio Heart Study showed that Mexican\u00adAmerican women\nliving in more affluent suburbs had a mean BMI of 24.5 while\nthose living in the most socioeconomically disadvantaged\nneighbourhoods had a mean BMI of 28.3.13 Corresponding\nBMI levels for Mexican\u00adAmerican men in these areas were 26.9\nThere are additional variations in obesity among populations\nthat have migrated to new countries, suggesting that factors\nassociated with the migration process (e.g. change in diet, exer-\ncise, and stress) may adversely influence body weight. Prospec-\ntive studies have shown significant BMI increases following\nimmigration to a new country. A prospective study of 654 adult\nTokelauans who migrated to New Zealand because of a natural\ndisaster showed that their BMI levels increased from 24.1 to\n8-year prospective study from Sweden showed a significant net\nincrease in BMI levels among men who immigrated from South\nEurope to Sweden compared to a reference group of men who\nhad not immigrated (BMI levels for immigrant men increased\nmen, after adjustment for age, leisure-time physical activity,\nsmoking, education, and health status).5\nIn addition to the possible adverse effects of migration on\nbody weight, several studies have suggested that the degree to\nwhich people acculturate to the majority culture following\nmigration may influence weight. A cross-sectional analysis of\nMexican\u00adAmerican women and men from the Hispanic Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) showed that\npreference for speaking Spanish (indicating a lower level of\nacculturation) was associated with a significantly higher BMI in\nmultidimensional aspects of acculturation and its association\nwith body weight by constructing the following three accultura-\ntion scales: functional integration with mainstream American\nculture, worth placed on conserving Mexican culture, and\nattitudes toward traditional family structure. The scales showed\ndifferent associations with body weight, with the first scale (low\nfunctional integration) showing the strongest association, but\nonly for women and not for men.23 In contrast, the well-known\nstudy on acculturation and weight, which involved a cohort of\n4653 men of Japanese ancestry living in Hawaii, found that\nmen who were most traditional had significantly lower levels of\nBMI (mean of 23) than those who were more acculturated\nIn this analysis we used data from the Third National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a large\nnational sample of women and men living in the US. We\nexamined whether abdominal obesity differed among three\ngroups of Mexican\u00adAmerican women and men who reflect\ndifferent stages of migration and acculturation: those born in\nMexico, those born in the US whose primary language was\nSpanish, and those born in the US whose primary language was\nEnglish. We also examined whether among those with\nabdominal obesity, risk of associated CVD risk factors (indicated\nby high serum insulin, NIDDM, high blood lipids, and hyper-\ntension)25\u00ad27 varied according to the three migration/\nacculturation groups.\nWe chose waist circumference as our measure of abdominal\nobesity for the following reasons. First, waist circumference is\nmore strongly related to the metabolically active visceral adipose\ntissue and therefore more biologically interpretable than the\nmore widely used measure of abdominal obesity, the waist to\nhip ratio (WHR).28,29 Second, several studies have concluded\nthat waist circumference alone is more closely associated with\nthe amount of abdominal, visceral obesity than the WHR, and\nrecommend that waist circumference should be used to esti-\ntive study revealed that waist circumference was the best\npredictor of NIDDM compared to BMI, WHR, triceps and sub-\nscapular skinfolds in Mexican\u00adAmerican women and men.32\nMethods\nthe National Center for Health Statistics, was designed to collect\ninformation to assess the health status of the US civilian non-\ninstitutionalized population aged 2 months.33 The NHANES\nIII sample design is similar to that of the previous NHANES,\nwhich used a stratified multistage probability design.34,35 It\nincluded an oversampling of both the Mexican\u00adAmerican and\nblack American populations so that the sample could produce\nstatistically reliable health estimates for the two largest ethnic\nminority groups in the US.\nThe NHANES III data were collected via standardized ques-\ntionnaires administered by bilingual interviewers and exam-\niners at participants' homes, and laboratory tests conducted at\nNHANES mobile examination centres. Of the 40 600 people\ninvited to participate, 86% completed the home questionnaire,\nand 78% completed both the medical examination and the\nThe sample for our analyses includes 1387 Mexican\u00ad\nyears of age, who completed both the home questionnaire and\nmedical examination. We used age 25 as our lower age cut-\npoint because educational attainment (a covariate in our multi-\nvariate regression models) is often not completed before this\nage. We used age 64 as our upper age cut-point because of life-\nstyle changes associated with retirement and ageing after 65.36\nWe excluded data for pregnant women (n = 69) and surveys\ncoded as unreliable (n = 3). Missing data were as follows for the\noutcome variables; waist (4.0%), BMI (0.4%), serum insulin\n(3.6%), NIDDM (0.2%), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol\n(4.3%), serum triglycerides (3.7%), and hypertension (4.4%).\nDefinition of variables\nMigration and acculturation status were indicated by country\nof birth and primary language spoken at home. Race-ethnic\ngroups were based upon combinations of the race and ethnicity\nreported by the participants. Respondents who chose Mexican\nor Mexican\u00adAmerican ethnicity are included in this analysis.\nWaist circumference was measured with the person in the\nerect position, with an inelastic tape at the level of the natural\nwaist (the most narrow part of the torso).37 Abdominal obesity\nwas defined as a waist circumference of 102 cm for men and\n88 cm for women, these cut-points representing a substan-\ntially increased risk of future adverse health outcomes and CVD\nrisk factors.10,38 As a measure of general obesity, a risk factor\nassociated with CVD, we used BMI.\nThe CVD risk factors were defined as follows. Non-insulin\ndependent diabetes mellitus was defined as having an 8-hour\nfast and plasma glucose levels 126 mg/dl and/or a medical\nhistory of diabetes (other than during pregnancy) with an age\nof onset 25 years.39 Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol\n(non-HDL-C) was calculated as the difference between total chol-\nesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Non-HDL-C,\nwhich may be a better indicator of atherogenic lipoprotein par-\nticles than indirectly estimated low-density lipoprotein chol-\nesterol,40 does not require fasting blood samples and therefore\nallowed the use of the entire NHANES III sample. Non-HDL-C\n(mmol/l), insulin (U/ml), and triglycerides (mmol/l) were\nmeasured from serum specimens. All blood specimens were\nobtained by a venipuncture. High insulin levels were defined as\nmean + 2 standard deviations (SD) for the entire NHANES III\nsample. High non-HDL-C cholesterol and high triglyceride\nlevels were defined as 4.0 mmol/l and 2.26 mmol/l, respec-\ntively.41 Blood pressure was measured on the right arm by\nhealth examiners or physicians while the participant was seated\nduring the medical examination; the mean of the second and\nthird of three blood pressure readings was used. Hypertension\nwas defined as systolic blood pressure 140 mmHg and/or\ndiastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg and/or current use of\nantihypertensive medications.42\nData analysis\nPrimary analyses, using linear models, were carried out in\nSUDAAN, to adjust for the complex sample design of NHANES\nIII.43 All analyses incorporated sampling weights that adjusted\nfor unequal probabilities of selection. Sample weights were also\nadjusted for non-respondents' characteristics. Analyses were\nrun separately for women and men. The primary outcome vari-\nable was waist circumference; the predictor variables were\ncountry of birth and acculturation status (three groups--born in\nMexico and used as the reference group, born in the US and\nSpanish-speaking, born in the US and English-speaking). The\nfollowing potential confounding factors were included as\ncovariates in the linear models: age (in years, centred at the\nsample mean to aid in the interpretation of the regression\ncoefficients), years of education (continuous and centred), per\ncent of energy from dietary fat (based on a single 24-hour\ndietary recall and administered by trained dietary interviewers);\nno leisure-time physical activity (based on whether individuals\nhad engaged in any leisure time physical activity in the past\nmonth, including exercises, sports, or physically active hobbies--\nthose who reported no leisure-time activities were considered\nphysically inactive); and current cigarette smoker (determined by\nself-report and based on whether individuals had smoked 100\ncigarettes during their lifetime and whether they were current\nsmokers). We validated self-reported smoking by examining a\nbiochemical measure, serum cotinine, and found that under-\nreporting did not differ significantly between the three groups\nfor either women or men. We included all first order inter-\nactions between predictor variables in the linear models.\nResults\nIndividuals born in the US who were Spanish-speaking were\nolder, less likely to live in urban areas, and more likely to live\nin the South (predominantly Texas), than their counterparts\n(Table 1). Mexican\u00adAmericans born in the US who were English-\nspeaking had substantially higher levels of education, lower\nlevels of poverty, and higher employment rates than the other\ntwo groups. Although all groups reported moderately high\npercentages of energy from total fat, those born in Mexico\nreported the lowest percentages. Women born in Mexico\nreported the lowest levels of leisure-time activity and were the\nleast likely to be current cigarette smokers.\nBoth country of birth and, to a lesser degree, acculturation\nstatus (indicated by primary language spoken) were signifi-\ncantly associated with waist circumference in the linear model\n(Table 2). After adjustment for age, education, per cent of energy\nfrom dietary fat, leisure-time physical activity, and smoking,\nwaist circumference was significantly larger in US-born women\nand men who spoke English or Spanish than Mexican-born\nwomen and men, indicating an influence of country of birth.\nThere was also a significant difference in waist circumference\nbetween Spanish- and English-speaking US-born women\n(P-value = 0.04), indicating an influence of acculturation\n(evident when examining further contrasts in the linear model).\nThere was no significant difference between Spanish- and\nEnglish-speaking US-born men.\nThe magnitude of the differences in waist circumference by\ncountry of birth was large; for example the beta coefficient of\n6.5 for the comparison of US-born Spanish-speaking women to\nMexican-born women indicates that the former group had, on\naverage, a waist circumference that was 6.5 cm larger than the\nMexican-born women having comparable age, education, smok-\ning, leisure-time physical activity and energy from fat. There\nwere two modestly significant interactions for men, but when\nexamined in more depth, neither were clinically meaningful.\nTable 3 presents the unadjusted and adjusted means for waist\ncircumference and BMI by country of birth and acculturation\nstatus. After adjustment for age, education, dietary fat, leisure-\ntime physical activity, and smoking, Mexican-born women and\nrespectively), US-born English-speaking women and men had\nintermediate waist circumference (93.6 cm, 97.3 cm), and US-\nborn Spanish-speaking women and men had the largest waist\ncircumference (96.9 cm, 97.7 cm).

It is important to note the sub-\nstantially higher levels of abdominal obesity in women than\nmen for all subgroups.\nHigh insulin levels, NIDDM, elevated cholesterol and trigly-\ncerides, and hypertension are among the main risk factors asso-\nciated with CVD.44 In Table 4 we present the percentages with\nhigh serum insulin (mean + 2 SD), NIDDM, high non-HDL\ncholesterol (4.0 mmol/l), high triglycerides (2.26 mmol/l),\nand hypertension among those with abdominal obesity.10,38\nAlthough there were some inconsistencies among the indi-\nvidual risk factors, women born in the US who were Spanish-\nspeaking and who had abdominal obesity were significantly\nmore likely to have one or more CVD risk factors than their\ncounterparts. Among men, there were no significant differences.\nDiscussion\nIn this analysis of a large national sample of Mexican\u00adAmerican\nwomen and men living in the US, we found important and sig-\nnificant clinical differences in waist circumference and abdom-\ninal obesity among three population groups, suggesting that\ncountry of birth (for both women and men) and acculturation\nstatus (for women only) are associated with the pathogenesis of\nobesity. We found that Mexican-born women and men had the\nsmallest waist circumference, English-speaking US-born women\nand men had intermediate waist circumference, and Spanish-\nspeaking US-born women and men had the largest waist cir-\ncumference, when age, education, per cent of energy from dietary\nfat, leisure-time physical activity, and smoking were taken into\naccount. The prevalence of abdominal obesity paralleled these\nfindings, and showed that 68.7% of Spanish-speaking US-born\nwomen and 39.5% of Spanish-speaking US-born men had\nabdominal obesity, indicating substantial risk of CVD.\nIt is well-known that obesity is strongly associated with\nbehavioural, cultural, and societal factors.5,45\u00ad48 This associa-\ntion has been established, in part, by migration studies that\nhave shown increasing levels of obesity among populations that\nmigrate, as well as those that have low levels of acculturation to\nthe majority culture.5,20,49 Mechanisms proposed as possible\nof educational or occupational opportunities,47,48,53 and/or other\nstructural inequalities.50\nOur findings of an association between country of birth and\nabdominal obesity (waist circumference) are consistent with\nfindings from the Hispanic HANES that showed that BMI was\nlarger for second and third generation Mexican\u00adAmericans than\nfor first generation Mexican\u00adAmericans.21 In addition, Hispanic\nHANES found that Mexican\u00adAmerican women with a prefer-\nence for the English language had significantly lower levels of\nBMI than those with a preference for the Spanish language, a\nfinding which agrees with the present study. The San Antonio\nHeart Study also demonstrated that Mexican\u00adAmerican women\nwith lower acculturation levels (low functional integration) had\nhigher levels of central obesity (subscapular-to-triceps skinfold-\nthickness ratio) than women with higher acculturation levels.23\nTable 3 Waist circumference and body mass index (BMI) by country of birth and acculturation status, Mexican\u00adAmerican women and men, ages\nBorn in US, Born in US,\nBorn in Mexico English-speaking Spanish-speaking White, Non-Hispanicc\nUnadjusted Adjustedb SD Unadjusted Adjusted SD Unadjusted Adjusted SD Unadjusted Adjusted SD\nWomen\nMen\na Source: National Center for Health Statistics, NHANES III, 1988\u00ad1994.

Waist\nUnderlying mechanisms\nIt is possible that the biological pathway between migration,\nacculturation, and abdominal obesity may be mediated by a\nlong-term stress reaction.54\u00ad56 Stress can result in either an\nacute fight or flight reaction, the first leading to control and the\nsecond leading to a long-term defeat reaction, characterized by\ndepression or helplessness.57,58 Abdominal obesity has been\nshown to be associated with the long-term defeat reaction, in\nwhich the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is activated with\nan increase of cortisol levels, which changes fat metabolism and\ncan result in a central distribution of fat.26,59\u00ad61 Migration,\nwhether forced by poverty or persecution, leading to settlement\nin a different social, political and cultural context, might result\nin a long-term defeat reaction regardless of previous health. In\naddition to migration stress, not speaking the language of the\nmajority culture may indicate a separation from the majority\nculture and create long-term acculturative stress.\nIt is unlikely that the differences in abdominal obesity that we\nfound between the three migration/acculturation groups can be\nexplained solely by genetic differences. Although it is estimated\nthat genetic factors may explain from 30% to 70% of cases of\nobesity in the US, the rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity\nover the last two decades is likely due to environmental factors\nsince the gene pool has been stable over the same time inter-\nval.62 Furthermore, in a population of Mexican\u00adAmerican\nadults from the San Antonio Heart Study, it was estimated that\ngenes accounted for only 15% to 30% of the phenotypic varia-\ntion in measures of obesity.63 Although genes may play an\nimportant role in the metabolism of adipose tissue, the large\ndifferences in weight-related outcomes that we observed within\na single ethnic group of Mexican\u00adAmericans suggests that the\ncurrent epidemic of obesity is largely environmental, either\ndirectly or via an interaction with genetic influences.\nOur findings that a high proportion of women and men have\nabdominal obesity suggest that many Mexican\u00adAmericans may\nbe at risk for additional CVD risk factors and metabolic compli-\ncations.64 Bj\u00f6rntorp26 suggested that the primary factors in the\n`syndrome of visceral obesity' or the metabolic syndrome, are\novereating, physical inactivity, smoking, and stress. These may\nact via neuroendocrine pathways to induce insulin resistance,\nincreased serum insulin and abdominal obesity, which can lead\nto diseases such as diabetes. The Metabolic Syndrome could be\ncalled a `Civilization Syndrome' because of its strong relation-\nship with an urban sedentary lifestyle and a positive energy\nbalance (overeating and lack of leisure-time physical activity).10\nWe suggest that the severe stress that can be associated with\nlack of acculturation to the majority culture and secondary life-\nstyle changes may induce an increase in weight, consistent with\nthe findings in the present study.\nStrengths and limitations\nThe NHANES III study is one of the most comprehensive\nnational surveys to date. Extensive and complete data are avail-\nable from both the home survey and medical examination, includ-\ning standardized measures of waist circumference. As noted\npreviously, response rates were high and there was minimal\nmissing data. Unlike many surveys, NHANES III represents a\nsample of the US population and therefore results are generaliz-\nable to the population of Mexican\u00adAmericans living in the US. It\nalso included an oversampling of Mexican\u00adAmericans to ensure\nthat large numbers would be available for analyses. In addition,\nNHANES III assessed BMI as well as waist circumference, which\nmay be a stronger predictor of obesity complications than BMI.65\nDespite these strengths, there are several limitations to the\nNHANES III survey. First, it is based on a cross-sectional survey\ndesign that does not allow one to draw inferences about causal\npathways. Second, there were limitations to several of the\nvariables we used, including our outcome measure, waist cir-\ncumference. Although exact methods exist for measuring the\nvisceral adipose tissue accumulation, such as magnetic reson-\nance imaging and computerized tomography, NHANES III did\nnot use these more exact methods. However, studies of\nanthropometric correlates have found that waist circumference\nis the preferred clinical and epidemiological method to use\nbecause of its association with visceral adiposity, low cost and\nTable 4 Cardiovascular disease risk (CVD) factors among Mexican\u00adAmerican women and men with abdominal obesity, ages 25\u00ad64, NHANES III,\nWomenb Menb\nBorn Born Born Born\nin US, in US, White, in US, in US, White,\nBorn in English- Spanish- Non- Born in English- Spanish- Non-\nMexico speaking speaking Hispanicc Mexico speaking speaking Hispanicc\n% with high non-high-density\na Source: National Center for Health Statistics, NHANES III, 1988\u00ad1994.

An asterisk indicates a significant (P  0.01) difference for the indicated group compared to the group with the highest value.\nc Data for white, non-Hispanic women and men are presented for reference and not included in the pairwise 2 tests.\nIn addition, NHANES III lacks measures of physical activity at\nwork, which may influence the gender differences that we\nfound for leisure-time physical inactivity (significant for women\nbut not for men, Table 2). Finally, our measure of acculturation,\nindicated by primary language spoken at home, is a static factor\nthat does not measure core beliefs and practices in relation to\nspecific CVD risk factors or medical conditions, and does not\nconsider the social context of behaviour.66,67\nIn summary, we found substantial variation in waist cir-\ncumference and abdominal obesity among three subgroups of\nMexican\u00adAmericans living in the US, distinguished by country\nof birth and acculturation status. All women, but in particular\nUS-born Spanish-speaking women (68.7%), had high preval-\nence of abdominal obesity. The variation we found in abdominal\nobesity illustrates the heterogeneity of the Mexican\u00adAmerican\npopulation and suggests that both country of birth and\nacculturation status influence indicators of obesity. To address\nthese variations, social and economic interventions are needed\nas well as lifestyle and public health policy interventions, such\nas those that influence food consumption patterns and stim-\nulate physical activity.66,67 As with all interventions, there is a\nneed for primary prevention efforts that begin early in life that\nare linguistically and culturally appropriate.\n"
