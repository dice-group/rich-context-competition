The authors used data from the Third\nNational   (1988\u00ad1994) to investigate the relation between glucose\ntolerance test response and other measures of glucose homeostasis and lung function in an adult population\nwithout a clinical diagnosis of diabetes. Plasma glucose level 2 hours after oral administration of 75 g of glucose\nwas inversely related to forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1\nconfidence interval: \u00ff231.9, \u00ff57.4) for persons in the highest quintile of postchallenge glucose compared with\nthe lowest. Similar inverse associations with FEV1\nwere found for other measures of glucose autoregulation. Lung\nfunction did not appear to be related to fasting glucose level. Similar associations were seen for forced vital\ncapacity (FVC) but not for the FEV1\n:FVC ratio. In the total study population, persons with previously diagnosed\ndiabetes had an FEV1\nThis effect was greater in those with poorly controlled diabetes.

For this reason, we used data from the Third\nNational  \n(NHANES III) in a population without a diagnosis of\ndiabetes to investigate the relation between response to\na glucose tolerance test and lung function as measured by\nand the FEV1\n:FVC ratio.

The\non the survey design and examination procedure have been\npublished by the National Center for Health Statistics (18).\nAll adults aged 20\u00ad60 years were eligible for inclusion in\nthe analyses. In the main analysis, persons with a known\ndiagnosis of diabetes (defined as a physician's diagnosis or\nthe regular use of diabetic medications) were excluded, as\nwere those with missing data for lung function, plasma\nglycemic markers, and potentially confounding variables\n(figure 1). However, persons who had undiagnosed diabetes,\nas demonstrated by their fasting plasma glucose level or\nglucose tolerance test response, were included in the study\npopulation. In addition, to comply with standardized\nprocedures for the measurement of fasting plasma glucose\nlevel and glucose tolerance testing (19), we included in\nthese analyses only those participants who had undergone\nexamination in the morning and had fasted for 8 hours\nor more.\nData collection\nBlood samples were obtained for biochemical assays, and\nanthropometric measurements were taken, including mea-\nsurement of height and weight and spirometric factors\n(including FEV1\nand FVC), using standardized techniques.\nWe extracted data on various markers of glucose regulation,\nincluding levels of fasting glucose, glycosylated hemoglo-\nbin (hemoglobin A1c), insulin, and C-peptide and, for\npeople over age 40 years, results of oral glucose tolerance\ntesting, in which the subject's initial plasma glucose level\nwas measured at baseline and 2 hours after oral adminis-\ntration of 75 g of glucose (Dextol\u00e4 or Trutol\u00e4). Insulin\nresistance was calculated from the measurements by means\nof a formula devised for use in epidemiologic studies:\nfasting glucose (mmol/liter) 3 fasting insulin (lU/ml)/25\n(20). A detailed description of laboratory methods has been\npublished elsewhere (21).\nStatistical analyses\nThe main population studied was persons with no clinical\ndiagnosis of diabetes. We also studied a larger population\nincluding persons with a clinical diagnosis of diabetes to\nassess the impact of diabetes on lung function. Using self-\nreported information on smoking history, we classified\nsubjects as never smokers, ex-smokers, or current smokers\nand quantified total cigarette smoking in pack-years. We\nmodeled measures of lung function with adjustment for\nage, sex, height, smoking (status and pack-years), and race/\nethnicity to derive the most parsimonious model that mini-\nmized variance. We examined a variety of more complex\nmodels for lung function that included higher-order variables\nfor age, height, pack-years of smoking, and body mass index\n(weight (kg)/height (m)2), including interaction terms, but\nthese did not improve the fit of the model; therefore, we chose\nthe simplest model.\nGlycemic markers were arbitrarily categorized into\nquintiles, and the relations between measures of glycemic\nstatus and lung function were explored using multiple linear\nregression. We fitted the models with quintiles of glycemic\nmarkers as both ordered and unordered factors and com-\npared the two models for evidence of departure from\nlinearity. The p value for linear trend is presented where\nthere was no departure from linearity, and the p value from\na test of heterogeneity is presented where the data demon-\nstrated evidence of departure from linearity. Many of the\nmarkers demonstrated nonlinear relations; therefore, the\nresults are presented in quintiles. We also divided the fasting\nblood glucose values according to the World Health\nOrganization definitions of normal glucose tolerance, im-\npaired glucose tolerance, and diabetes (19). Normal values\nfor fasting plasma glucose are those less than 110 mg/dl;\nFIGURE 1. Flow diagram for selection of study subjects, Third\n7,045 subjects excluded to meet World Health Organization (WHO)\ncriteria for glucose tolerance testing, 79% of those who did not meet\nthe WHO criteria were excluded for having an afternoon or evening\nexamination, and the remaining 21% were excluded because of\nmissing data on the time of examination or the period of fasting. FEV1\n,\nforced expiratory volume in 1 second.\nLung Function and Glucose Metabolism 547\nvalues equal to or above 126 mg/dl indicate diabetes. The\nnormal values for plasma glucose 2 hours after a 75-g oral\nglucose challenge are those less than 140 mg/dl; values for\nvalues equal to or above 200 mg/dl indicate diabetes. The\nimpact of these clinical definitions of impaired glycemic\ncontrol on FEV1\n, FVC, and FEV1\n:FVC ratio was examined.\nWe examined a number of confounding factors, such as\nbody mass index, waist:hip ratio, poverty index ratio, and\nlevels of serum triglycerides, serum antioxidants, and C-\nreactive protein (fitted as continuous or categorical variables\nas appropriate), to determine whether they altered the\nregression coefficients.\nTo obtain additional data, we also used the same\nmodeling strategies to study the effect of a known diagnosis\nof diabetes on lung function using all persons with and\nwithout diagnosed diabetes who had data available. In\naddition, we examined the impact of the degree of glucose\nregulation in persons with known diabetes by stratifying\nthese persons into two groups defined by a glycosylated\nhemoglobin concentration of <7 percent versus 7 percent.\nA factor was considered a confounding factor if its addition\nto the model changed the size of the effect by 15 percent or\nmore. Because of the complex, multistage probability\nsample design of NHANES III, we accounted for the survey\ndesign in calculating estimates, using the specialized survey\ncommand within Stata/SE 8.0 (Stata Corporation, College\nStation, Texas). Because certain age groups and ethnic\ngroups were oversampled in the NHANES III study\npopulation, we also repeated the analyses using weighting\nvariables to establish the descriptive population corrected to\nbe representative of the general US population.\nRESULTS\nA total of 12,496 adults were eligible for the initial\nanalyses. Reasons for exclusion are outlined in figure 1. Six\nhundred and eighteen (5 percent) of those excluded from the\ninitial analysis had a clinical diagnosis of diabetes, and 7,045\nsubjects (56 percent) were excluded because they failed to\nmeet World Health Organization criteria for glucose testing.\nOur study population was similar to the excluded population\nin terms of demographic characteristics (table 1). A total of\nof glucose control, and 1,612 (13 percent) had data on serum\nglucose level 2 hours after a glucose load. The mean age of\nthe population was 37 years; 54 percent were female. The\nmean levels and distributions of the various glycemic\nmarkers are presented in table 2.\nFor the 1,612 participants who had data on glucose\ntolerance testing, an inverse dose-response relation with\nTABLE 1.

A\nsimilar relation was seen with increasing fasting insulin,\nplasma C-peptide, insulin resistance, and glycosylated\nhemoglobin, although there was no clear association\nbetween fasting plasma glucose and FEV1\n.\nAdjusting the above associations for body mass index (in\ncategories) and waist:hip ratio slightly decreased these\nassociations between measures of glucose control and\n. Adjusting for other possible confounders, such as\nplasma antioxidants, vitamins A, C, and E, poverty index\nratio, C-reactive protein, and triglycerides, did not appre-\nciably alter these associations (data not shown). Stratifying\nthe results according to age did not produce any noticeable\ndifference in effect across the age categories, and there were\nno significant interactions between smoking and glycemic\nmarkers. Restricting the analysis to persons who had never\nsmoked did not significantly alter these associations.\nThe relation between glycemic markers and FVC was\nsimilar to the results shown for FEV1\n, although the size of\nthe effect was greater for FVC (table 4). However, no\nconsistent association was seen between the different\nglycemic markers and the FEV1\n:FVC ratio (table 5).\nWhen we compared persons with impaired glucose\ntolerance and persons who had clinical diabetes defined by\nglucose tolerance testing with persons whose values fell\nwithin the normal range, the differences in FEV1\nfasting glucose and diabetes as defined by fasting glucose\nlevel were associated with decreases in FEV1\nhemoglobin A1c concentration had an associated decrease\nIn examining the effect of diagnosed diabetes on lung\nfunction, we found that persons with diabetes had a 119.1 ml\nin com-\nparison with the rest of the population (table 7). Persons\nwith suboptimal diabetic control, as determined by a glyco-\nsylated hemoglobin concentration of 7 percent, had lower\nlung function than persons with well-controlled diabetes.\nCorrection for the selective oversampling of certain age\nand ethnic groups in NHANES III using models that\nincluded the weighting variables did not change the\nqualitative nature of the results. Correction for weighting\ndid increase the effect size of the association between\nmeasures of glycemic control and lung function, and it also\nincreased the confidence intervals in the analyses of\na smaller sample population, as shown in tables 6 and 7.\nWe thus elected to present the data using the more\nconservative regression models derived from the data\navailable for each eligible individual.\nDISCUSSION\nWe have demonstrated that in adults without a diagnosis\nof diabetes, impaired glucose regulation as indicated by\nglucose tolerance testing, higher levels of glycosylated\nhemoglobin, plasma insulin (a marker of insulin resistance\n(22)), and C-peptide (a by-product of insulin production),\nand an epidemiologic measure of insulin resistance are\nassociated with impaired lung function in a dose-response\nmanner. However, fasting plasma glucose was not associ-\nated with lung function. We have also demonstrated that\npersons with a clinical diagnosis of diabetes have impaired\nlung function, a finding that is consistent with previous work\nin this area (3\u00ad17). These findings were not explained by\nobesity or increasing age. This relation was seen throughout\nthe nondiabetic values of these markers of glucose auto-\nregulation, which suggests that the relation between glucose\nand lung function is not just an association seen in persons\nwith overt diabetes. A similar association was also seen\nbetween glycemic markers and FVC but was not seen\nconsistently with the FEV1\n:FVC ratio; this suggests that the\neffect is primarily an effect on lung function and does not\ninfluence the development of obstructive lung disease (as\nseen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).\nThe strength of this study was the use of biologic markers\nof glycemic control and physiologic measurements of lung\nfunction in a well-defined population with no clinical\ndiagnosis of diabetes and no knowledge of the hypothesis\nbeing tested. NHANES III had a high participation rate,\nwith 86 percent and 78 percent of those invited to participate\nin the questionnaire survey and the medical examination,\nrespectively, taking part (18). However, the population\nstudied for the effect of fasting glucose, C-peptide, insulin\nTABLE 2.

It is unlikely that\nthose who were included in this group had lower lung\nfunction than those who did not fast for 8 hours or\nunderwent examination in the afternoon. We do have to\nconsider the potential for confounding, especially by\nsmoking, antioxidants, and early life development. Because\nan association between smoking and diabetes has been\ndemonstrated (23, 24), smoking status may confound the\nrelation between impaired glycemic control and lung\nfunction (25). However, we rigorously adjusted for self-\nreported smoking history using both current smoking status\nand total pack-years of smoking, additionally restricting our\nanalysis to persons who had never smoked, and this did not\nalter our findings. Another risk factor that is associated with\nboth diabetes (26) and reduced lung function (27) is\nTABLE 6.

An association has been\ndemonstrated between low body weight in early life and\nimpaired glucose control, insulin resistance (28, 29), and\ndecreased lung function (30). It is thus possible that our\napparent association between poor glucose regulation and\nreduced lung function is a consequence of confounding by\ngrowth in early life, although no effect of birth weight on\nlung function was reported in a recent study (9). Alterna-\ntively, it may be that poor glycemic control lies within the\ncausal pathway explaining the association between low birth\nweight and decreased lung function. The use of data from\na cross-sectional study such as NHANES III does not permit\ntemporal relations to be considered; therefore, we cannot\nexclude the possibility of reverse causality--that is, lower\nlung function's leading to impaired glucose regulation.\nThe absence of an effect of fasting plasma glucose on\nin the presence of a negative effect of increasing\nlevels of other markers of poor glycemic control is\nanomalous and difficult to explain. Over 95 percent of our\nstudy population was in the nondiabetic ranges for fasting\nplasma glucose, and we theorize that there may be greater\nrandom variation of fasting plasma glucose within these\nlevels, while the other measures of glycemic control provide\na more consistent measure of glycemic control. Although\nwe have been unable to find data in the literature to\nsubstantiate this, the association of a gradient of decreasing\namong persons with fasting plasma glucose levels in\nthe ``impaired'' or diabetic ranges (table 4) demonstrates\na consistency with the rest of the data, suggesting that this\nmay be the case. The mechanism by which impaired\nglycemic control may lead to a reduction in lung function\nis uncertain, though it has been suggested that the increased\nsystemic inflammation associated with diabetes (31) may\nresult in pulmonary inflammation (4) and hence airway\ndamage (32). Alternatively, a reduction in antioxidant\ndefenses resulting from increased oxidative activity associ-\nated with diabetes (26) may lead to a secondary reduction in\nthe antioxidant defenses of the lung and hence increased\nsusceptibility to environmental oxidative insults, resulting\nin subsequent loss of lung function. In addition to an\nincrease in intracellular oxidative stress, increased nuclear\nfactor-jB, and inflammatory mediator expression, long-\nterm hyperglycemia causes an increase in collagen molecule\nsynthesis and cross-linking via the accumulation of ad-\nvanced glycosylation end products, which may also ad-\nversely influence lung function (33). The observation that\nincreasing insulin level and insulin resistance is associated\nwith loss of lung function suggests that insulin may have\na direct negative effect on airway function (34).\nThe initial studies of diabetes and lung function were\nsmall and had little statistical power, which may explain\nsubsequent larger population-based studies have been\nmore coherent, demonstrating reduced pulmonary func-\ntion in persons with an elevated plasma glucose level and\na diagnosis of diabetes. Enright et al. (43) reported a small\nreduction in FEV1\nof 23 ml among persons with diabetes\nin the Cardiovascular Health Study. Analysis of 3,254\nmembers of the Framingham Offspring Cohort showed\nassociations of both diagnosed diabetes and elevated\nplasma glucose with reduced FEV1\n(4). The results\ndemonstrated that persons with diabetes had an FEV1\nml lower than that of persons without diabetes and that\npersons in the highest quartile of plasma glucose had an\n85 ml lower than that of persons in the lowest quartile\n(4). The cross-sectional data from the Copenhagen City\nHeart Study demonstrated a reduction in FEV1\namong diabetics who required insulin and a reduction of\n117 ml among diabetics treated with oral hypoglycemic\nagents (3) in comparison with nondiabetics. In an analy-\nsis of persons without diagnosed diabetes, an inverse\nassociation was observed between an elevated nonfasting\nplasma glucose level (200 mg/dl) and lung function;\nthere was a difference in FEV1\nwith persons with normal fasting plasma glucose levels\n(3). The longitudinal analyses of the same population\ndemonstrated an association between a new diagnosis of\ndiabetes and impaired pulmonary function, with the newly\ndiagnosed diabetics having an annual decrease in FEV1\nof\n25 ml more than control subjects (44). A similar increased\ndecline in lung function among persons with poor diabetic\ncontrol has been reported elsewhere (45), although follow-\nup at 15 years demonstrated that the decline in FEV1\namong those with diabetes was the same as that among\nthose without the disease. Similarly, in the Normative\nAging Study, Lazarus et al. (10) demonstrated an associ-\nation between decreased FEV1\nand increased insulin\nresistance, although persons with lower baseline lung\nfunction were observed to be more likely to develop\ninsulin resistance 20 years later (11)--a result that was\nalso seen for the development of diabetes elsewhere (46).\nHowever, these relations were not seen in analysis of\nadults aged 51\u00ad95 years in the Rancho Bernardo Study\n(47), where lung function was not associated with fasting\nblood glucose level; this may have been a consequence of\nstudying an older population. Interestingly, a small cohort\nstudy of 18 subjects with type I diabetes who were using\nan insulin pump to achieve normoglycemia in comparison\nwith conventional therapy suggested that intensive insulin\ntreatment, and hence better glycemic control, may pre-\nserve pulmonary function, although the absence of\nbaseline pulmonary function measurements limited the\ninterpretation of these data (48).\nWe have demonstrated that increases in the glucose\nresponse to a glucose tolerance test, glycosylated hemoglo-\nbin, serum insulin, and a marker of insulin resistance are all\nassociated with a reduction in lung function as assessed by\n(and FVC). This effect is not explained by confound-\ning due to obesity. The observation that persons with\ndiagnosed diabetes that is poorly controlled have worse\nlung function than persons with diagnosed diabetes who\nhave good glucose control is consistent with the hypothesis\nthat good control of diabetes is associated with preserved\nlung function. Further understanding of the effect of glucose\nregulation on the lungs would be obtained by assessing lung\nfunction in participants from a trial of intensive glucose\nregulation, such as the Diabetes Control and Complications\nTrial, where beneficial effects on diabetic nephropathy are\nseen 7\u00ad8 years after the end of the intervention (49).\nAlthough smoking is the main risk factor for loss of lung\nfunction, there is an urgent need to understand other factors\nthat contribute to a reduction in lung function, as demon-\nstrated by the 95 percent excess mortality among persons\nwho have never smoked but have reduced lung function in\ncomparison with those with normal lung function (50). In\naddition, the emergence of novel risk factors such as\nhyperglycemia will lead to increased understanding of the\npathogenesis of worse lung function and hence new\npossibilities for intervention. In view of the public health\nimportance of lung function in health and the increasing\nprevalence of diabetes, this is a subject that warrants further\ninvestigation.\n"
