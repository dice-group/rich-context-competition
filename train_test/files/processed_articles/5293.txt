    "abstract": "Abstract\nThere are several accounts of the genealogy and manifestations of the myriad governance crises, which Nigeria continues\nto face five decades after independence. Although no single account is sufficient to explain the governance misadventures,\none key point resonating is that progress and development have proved elusive over the years. In this article, we seek to\nmove away from the dominant characterization of this governance crisis as deriving directly from the consequences of a\nmonolithic oil economy, a deeply fractured and volatile political terrain, or even corrupt and patrimonial rule. Instead, the\narticle locates the root of Nigeria's governance crisis in the queer pattern of the emergence, reinvention, and manipulation\nof proto-nationalisms characterized not by any nationalistic quest for independence and spatial liberation but one pursued\nto gain foothold in governance and to partake in its perquisites. Invariably, the post-colonial nation-states that emerged at\nindependence in many African countries, for the most part, neither followed through with any logical expression of genuine\nnationalism nor mobilized toward a shared vision of nationhood. The article shows how individuals and groups within the\npolity soon became locked in contested and irreconcilable positions that further made the construction of a truly nationalistic\nidentity difficult, if not forlorn. This article submits that successive post-colonial administrations unimaginatively followed the\ndivide-and-rule traditions of the colonial state and thus failed to mobilize the popular support required for the construction\nof a broad-based national identity that is key to managing the protracted governance crises the country has experienced\nsince independence.\n",

Thus, at the lowering\nof the British Union Jack on the midnight of September 30,\nexpectations were understandably high-pitched that Nigeria\nhad all it might take to lead Africa, not just as an emerging\nfirst superpower but also as a stabilizing force on the conti-\nnent (Siollun, 2009). In the gratifying words of Sir Abubakar\nTafawa Balewa, the first Prime Minister, to the departing\nBritish Governor-General, Sir James Robertson, Nigerians\n\"are grateful to the British officers, whom we have known as\nmasters, and then as leaders, and finally as partners, and\nthe prospect of a vibrant nation, especially one with the larg-\nest concentration of Black people in the world and an appar-\nently sound agrarian economy with bountiful oil reserve\nwaiting to be tapped, was more real than apparent.\nBefore long, however, the country once toasted by the\ninternational community as the beacon of liberal democratic\nvalues in Africa and the economic powerhouse of the African\ncontinent became the subject of economic difficulty, political\nviolence, and growing poverty among Nigerians (Wittaker,\n1Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria\nCorresponding Author:\nTaiwo Akanbi Olaiya, Faculty of Administration, Obafemi Awolowo\nEmail: olaiyapoju2@yahoo.co.uk\nProto-Nationalisms as Sub-Text for the\nCrisis of Governance in Nigeria\nTaiwo Akanbi Olaiya1\n Keywords\nAfrica, area studies, humanities, political economy, economic science, social sciences, comparative politics, political science,\nethnicity and politics, intersectional politics, political history, politics and humanities, social movements and activism, rationality\nand society, sociological theory, sociology, comparative/historical sociology, peace, war, and social conflict, political economy\nof the world-system, political sociology\n2 SAGE Open\n1991). Within the first few years of independence, the new\ncountry became convulsive, at least politically, beginning\nwith the degeneration of the constitutional crisis in the\nWestern Regional House of Assembly. Thereafter, and in\nquick succession, other politically driven conflicts began to\nerupt: the suspension of the Constitution and declaration of\nstate of emergency in the Western Region, intense intra-party\nand inter-party rivalries, trumped up treason charges against\nvociferous opposition leaders, and the general overheating of\nthe polity reflecting in political violence and the attendant\nstate repression, to mention a few.\nBut, then, it would seem that the contentious political\nclimate that the country degenerated into was not antici-\npated, certainly not by the generation of nationalist leaders\nthat painstakingly--but also enthusiastically--negotiated\nthe country's independence. Indeed, there were indications\nthat the erstwhile nationalists on whose laps the mantle of\npolitical powers fell were fully committed to the tenets of\nliberal democracy, albeit the British Westminster variant.\nAlthough there were moments of mixed feelings during the\nseries of conferences to negotiate independence (Crowder,\n1987), especially over the terms of engagement between\nand among the component political units, there was unfor-\ntunately also an implicit convergence of interest among the\nregional governments and their dominant political parties\nthat several critical issues were either overlooked or swept\nunder the carpet.\nBy any means, however, Nigeria was not a political bas-\nket case as the political events that unfolded in the country\nalso resonated across Africa. For the most part too, the\nattainment of independence did not fundamentally trans-\nform the structure of governance in most African states.\nJust as well, the political class that replaced the departing\ncolonial officers--having been tutored in the best traditions\nof colonial administration--was only committed to the pro-\ntection of the \"colonial legacy\" rather than to pursue any\nradical agenda to uproot and replace it. Apart from uphold-\ning the colonial legacy, the nationalists embraced the\nauthoritarian bureaucratic practices of their predecessors;\ngrosso modo, the new independent African states retained\nthe forces of authoritarianism and detachment from the\npublic that were the key hallmarks of colonial rule. Rather\nthan come to terms with and transcend the contradictions of\nthe notorious past, the post-colonial states and the political\nelite that ran them after independence retained the essential\nattributes, idiosyncrasies, and characteristics of their colo-\nnial mentors.\nIt is against the backdrop of the earliest experiences of\ngovernance misgivings that faced Nigeria, and other African\ncountries, that this article is set. Although there are several\naccounts of the genealogy and manifestations of the myriad\nof governance crises which Nigeria continues to face five\ndecades after independence, our point here is that no single\nfactor is sufficient to explain the country's governance mis-\nadventures. Yet, one key point of convergence is that\nprogress and development have so far eluded it due to its\nplethora of perennial and burdensome governance problems.\nIn this article, we seek to move away from the dominant\ncharacterization of the governance crisis facing Nigeria as\nbeing a direct consequence of her perverted oil economy, a\ndeeply fractured and volatile political terrain, or even corrup-\ntion and patrimonial rule. Instead, the article locates the root\nof the country's governance crisis in the queer pattern of the\nemergence, reinvention, and embrace of proto-nationalisms\ncharacterized not by the any nationalistic demand for inde-\npendence for its sake but that which simply, and implicitly,\nfavored gaining a share of government and its perquisites\nwithout any serious commitment to values such as integrity\nand service.\nHistorical facts revealed that the so-called nationalists\nhad dissipated little or no effort toward anticipating the fate\nof the state to be bestowed to them (Geddes, 2010; Olaiya,\n2014). Ironically, they were prominent figures in the inter/\nintra-ethnic crisis that pervaded in the period of pre-indepen-\ndence jostling. Writing on the political experiences of\nNigeria, Geddes observed that the supposedly crucial period\nof struggles for state formation was in fact characterized by\n\"bitter and tempestuous\" engagement between leaders of\nNorth and South:\nStrong resentment amongst minority ethnic groups at the\norganisation of the new state . . . rivalries which developed\nbetween the major ethnic groups and their parties in the pre-\nindependence period . . . strong antipathies and resentments on\nthe part of the citizens. He argued that these resentments and\ntensions were to result in the destabilisation of both regional and\nfederal governments . . . [and] as Anifowose says, \"It was against\nthis back-ground of deep-rooted distrust and conflict among\nNigerian politicians, that Nigeria became independent.\" (Geddes,\nNotes on Nationalism and\nProto-Nationalism in Nigeria\nNationalism as a political and social philosophy begins from\nthe premise that the welfare of the nation-state is at the epi-\ncenter of the discourse on politics and governance. Basically,\nthe notion of nationalism describes a collective state of mind\nor consciousness in which people believe that their primary\nduty and loyalty is to the nation, with a lot of emphasis placed\non national superiority and glorification of certain national\ncultural virtues. Although the idea of nationalism has an ata-\nvistic past, its modern-day reincarnation is sometimes traced\nporary times, the idea of nationalism operates alongside for-\nmal legal and institutional frameworks of society as\ningredients for the construction of political order and social\ncohesiveness in any state. For a group of people to express\nnationalism, they must first identify themselves as belonging\nto a nation, that is, a large group of people with shared identi-\nties based on common history, religion, language, race, to\nname a few (Ajala, 2009). In other words, where common\nidentity and formal authority structure over a large territory\n(i.e., the state) exist, nationalism becomes possible.\nAlthough nationalism is unique to the modern world,\nsome of its elements can be traced throughout history. The\nearliest roots of nationalism are probably to be found among\nthe ancient Hebrews who conceived of themselves as a cho-\nsen people, that is, a people superior to others and with a\ncommon culture and history. The ancient Greeks also felt\nsuperior to all other peoples, apart from their shared loyalty\nto the political community. The growth of the middle class\nand the thirst of that group for political power, in turn, paved\nway for democratic theory and practices closely connected\nwith the emergence of modern nationalism. Drivers of the\nFrench Revolution, for instance, insisted on establishing\nfreedom, equality, and liberty; effectively, they viewed the\nnation as inseparable from the people. The idea propounded\nby the French revolutionaries glorified the nation, and in\ndoing so, brought nationalism into the political domain for\nthe first time.\nThis article tinkers with the complexity of the problem\nexerted by the nature and structure of African nationalism\nand how that has contributed in great measure to the failure\nof governance in the post-colonies. We bear in mind here the\ncaution against infinite number or loose use of what\nBarrington (1997) called \"`something' nationalisms.\" Yet,\nthe adoption of the term proto-nationalism is in line with the\ncoinage of Crowder (1987), which he used to demarcate\nactual nationalists whose ultimate aim is to struggle for\nnational identity and autonomous political community that is\ncapable of self-determination from the opportunistic nation-\nalists whose aim is to gain the rein of government. We there-\nfore found the concept of \"proto-nationalism,\" as enunciated\nin Crowder (1987), appropriate to describe the uncritical and\nhasty acceptance of (conditions of the) nations handed over\nto the so-called nationalists at independence. Nationalism, as\nBarrington (1997) rightly argued, is not about the patriotism\nto the nation-state within the framework of international\nstate system but a people's loyalty to the ideal of shared cul-\ntural identity and self-determination. As we have thus argued\nlater in this article, such movements hardly conform to\nnationalism, properly so called, which \"is about two things-\ndefining the nation and defining its territory\" (Barrington,\nin Nigeria particularly was not geared toward ethnic or cul-\ntural identity but about a collective mobilization of all forces\navailable for power shift from White rulers to Black ones.\nThis is the concept of proto-nationalisms, described in\nCrowder's (1987) epic book and adopted in the work.\nIn particular, it brings to the fore the fundamental point\nthat the nationalism that was marshaled in the struggle for\nindependence and state making in these former colonies did\nnot conform with known temperament of nationalism in\nwhich nationhood forms the primary motive and in which\ncommon custom and ancestry form the bedrock for struggles\nto gain \"territorial autonomy and sovereignty\" (Barrington,\ntext of territoriality arbitrarily demarcated by colonialists--\nbut that which did not correspond with the realities of each\ngroup--the boundaries either dismantled or completely oblit-\nerate existing primordial nations and replaced it with carved\nterritories for easy administration (Olaiya, 2014). For\ninstance, a considerable part of northern Nigeria \"was part of\na north African caliphate, with a number of well-organised\nemirates whose territories existed within and overlapped parts\nof the current nations of Nigeria, Chad, Sudan and Cameroon\"\n(Geddes, 2010, p. 2). The same largely predominates in the\nsouthern Nigeria where \"a number of independent kingdoms\nexisted,\" which also often extended beyond present national\nand regional boundaries (p. 2).\nNationalism certainly cannot mean the bandying together\nof strange bed-fellows or attempt to mix \"oil with water\"\nThe naivety of planners was evident in the way in which\npotential problems were handled in the lead-up to independence.\nDespite the early warnings of writers like Awolowo and\nexperiences of other West African postcolonial countries, it was\nassumed that with the establishment of democracy, tribalism and\nethnic difference would fade as people learned to identify\nthemselves primarily with the nation rather than with their own\nethnic communities. (p. 3)\nConsidering the huge difference of ethnological, religious,\nand political conditions of the inhabitants (Clifford, 1921),\nthe nationalists could have indeed seen beyond the artificial\nnations created from colonies. In his book titled Path to\nNigerian Freedom, Awolowo (1947) argued that the uncriti-\ncal acceptance and nature of the colonial territory known as\nNigeria is bound to be fatal. According to him,\nThere are various national or ethnical groups in the country . . .\nThere is as much difference between them as there is between\nGermans, English, Russians and Turks for instance. The fact that\nthey have a common [Colonial] overlord does not destroy this\nfundamental difference . . . All these incompatibilities among\nthe various peoples in the country militate against unification\n. . . It is evident from the experiences of other nations that\nincompatibilities such as we have enumerated are barriers which\ncannot be overcome by glossing over them. (Awolowo, 1947,\nThe colonialists deliberately played down on ethnic\ncoalescing for reasons good for selfish, albeit contingent,\npurposes of hitch-free administration while the \"national-\nists\" equally played along for obvious reason of opportunis-\ntic rule beyond their kinsmen (Olaiya, 2014). As expected,\nin West Africa, the \"nationalists\" preferred to identify them-\nselves as Nigerians rather than Yoruba, Hausa, or Igbo; Gold\nCoaster rather than Akan, Ewe, or Guan; Senegalese rather\nthan Wollof; Ivoirians rather than Baoules (Crowder, 1976,\n4 SAGE Open\npp. 405-407). However, the intention of the colonialists was\nnot to eradicate ethnicity but to stem the expressions of\nnationalism they produce and perhaps also to prevent tribal\nconflicts. Thus, the acceptance of the arbitrary colonial bor-\nders (and subsequent location of the processes of nation\nbuilding within them) smacks of naivety and/or willful\nacquiesces, which became a major factor underlying the\ngovernance crisis that erupted thereafter. The colonial rulers\nand successors in governments desired independence with-\nout properly interrogating the inter-territoriality and intra-\nboundary peculiarities of the people of banded communities,\ntheir identities, and ethnic idiosyncrasy. For the most part,\nthe emerged nation-states were so incongruent and strange\nto the peoples that rather than lead to the liberation of those\nparticular spaces, the people interacted more in open aggres-\nsion cum conflict or, at best, mutual suspicion (Davidson,\n1992). As noted elsewhere, countless African leaders con-\ntinued abrasively in the misapplications and, in fact, aggra-\nvated them with added patrimonialism and corruption\nthat it might be factual that the emerged \"leaders hanged\nthemselves and their fellow citizens, the rich countries often\nAn immediate implication of this lack of convergence\nbetween nation and territoriality was that it conferred on the\nnascent post-colonial leadership the right of appropriation,\nnot just that of territory but also of unlimited discretion to\nexercise power. In any case, the acceptance of these frontiers\nalso automatically created the necessity to cope with the\nforging minuscule nationhood from the disparate ethnic and\nsub-ethnic nationalities. It appears not accidental therefore\nthat the pluralism of ethnicity in post-colonial Africa tow-\nered well above any other factor in fomenting crises of gov-\nernance on the continent (Mkandawire, 2005). It might be\nthat the nationalists also recognized the potential centrifugal\nimpacts of ethnic pluralism but only as part of the \"divide-\nand-rule\" ploy of their colonial oppressors bent on denying\nthem independence (Mkandawire, 2005). They failed to\ncome to terms with the deeper structural meaning and impli-\ncations of plural ethnicities for politics and governance then,\nand now. Perhaps they also appreciated, rightly so, that the\nethnic groups in existence at the dawn of independence were\njust too tiny, ill developed, and in some instances thinly\nspread across colonial boundaries, to stand alone as modern\nstates, not thus swayed by the implications that the situation\nmight portend for the construction of nationhood. Another\nfactor that seemed to have bothered pioneer nationalists was\nthe language barrier; with scores of distinctive but mutually\nunintelligible dialects coexisting side by side. While they\nsaw this heterogeneity as a recipe for disaster, they were\nfilled with the illusion of nationhood and that was all that\nwas necessary--if not sufficient--to bring disparate groups\ntogether under the same political umbrella, albeit one that\ncould not be trusted with longevity and protection. They\nsolicited an essentially European imagery of nationhood; one\ninclined toward the myth of one language, one culture, one\nidentity. It was too cumbersome to contemplate an alterna-\ntive idea of nationhood protruding from a multiethnic, multi-\nlingual, and multicultural political clime. For instance, the\nRichards Constitution of 1946 had advocated \"unity in diver-\nsity\" but in practice had to contend with the underbellies of\ndiversity between and among the nationalities that made up\nmodern Nigeria.\nMany critics have argued that the scissors effect of proto-\nnationalism and pan-Africanism merely celebrated the inde-\npendence of African nations while ignoring, for the most\npart, the ethno-social and cultural basis of their existence and\nsurvival. While absolving themselves of the responsibility of\naggravating governance problems in the immediate post-\ncolonial era, the political leaders of the nascent African states\nwere quick to remind their people that \"political indepen-\ndence could only have meaning if it was accompanied by\nhistorical independence\" (Ogot, 1976, p. 1). In spite of the\nfact that the independence of African states was defective\nfrom birth, Patrice Lumumba1 was enthusiastic--even\nthough economical with the truth--in proclaiming that\nhistory will have its say one day--not the history they teach in\nBrussels, Paris, Washington or United Nations, but the history\ntaught in the countries set free from colonialism and puppet\nrulers. Africa will write her own history, and both north and\nsouth of the Sahara, it will be a history of glory and dignity.\nBecause of the enormous challenges they faced, espe-\ncially in rallying their disparate citizens toward genuine and\nhome-grown nationalisms, post-independence African lead-\ners refused to acknowledge that the states they inherited were\nundifferentiated and amorphous entities (Ochwada, 2005).\nThey grossly simplified the character and directions of the\nstruggles they are engaged in (Mkandawire, 2005). The real-\nity, of course, was that nationalism as a homogenizing and\nunifying factor did not take adequate cognizance of the\ndiverse composition of groups on ground in most African\nnations. Even with the much-touted \"unity in diversity\" pro-\ngram of Governor Richards in Nigeria and his post-colonial\nsuccessors to date, other identities along class, gender, and\nethnicity lines continue to thrive, often with unpleasant out-\ncomes (Mama, 2005). The situation, in turn, resulted not\nonly in the unending challenges of nation building and devel-\nopment but also that of social injustice, economic misman-\nagement, and deep-seated governance crisis.\nIt was precisely for this reason that Ngugu Wa Thiong'o\nonce warned that for any country in Africa to advance and\nescape the vestiges of underdevelopment--as well as nurture\na sharper vision of the future--the collective memories of its\npeoples (leaders and citizens, alike) must be rescued from\nthe clutches of the colonial past (Mkandawire, 2005).\nUnfortunately, Nigerian nationalism did not uncritically\nembrace wholesale the \"modernity\" prescribed by the\ncolonial masters; none of the partakers that emerged within\nthe radicalized environment of nationalist struggles, from\nGhana to Tanzania, sought to an ideology and identity that\nwould give governance and development in their respective\ncountries an African soul. Witness, for instance, Kwame\nNkrumah's \"African Personality,\" Leopold Senghor's\n\"Negritude,\" Julius Nyerere's \"Ujamaa\" (African Socialism),\nas well as the likes of Amicar Cabral and Frantz Fanon in\nGuinea Bissau and Algeria (Mkandawire, 2005).\nIn Tanzania, for instance, President Nyerere had\ndeployed Ujamaa as the philosophical template for national\ndevelopment through the fostering of national self-reliance\nbased on the transformation of economic and cultural atti-\ntudes. Economically, it required that everyone worked for\nthe group as well as the self. Culturally, Tanzanians must\nlearn to free themselves from dependence on European\nideas and powers, including learning to do things for them-\nselves and be satisfied with what was achieved. It also\ninvolved the implementation of free and compulsory edu-\ncation for all Tanzanians to sensitize them to the principles\nof Ujamaa. Despite the innovative ideas behind it, Ujamaa\nhas been blamed for the catastrophic collapse of the econ-\nomy, which left several people close to starvation and\ndeath. At the least, the wide acceptance of the idea and\npractice--unlike Nnamdi Azikiwe's \"irredentism\" and\nObafemi Awolowo's \"socialism\" that never reached\nnational limelight in Nigeria--pointed to the feasibility of\nidioms of nationalism on the continent, if property contex-\ntualized and mobilized (Iweriebo, 1996).\nOur intention here is not to rehearse the literature of\nnationalism in Nigeria per se; we, in fact, acknowledge the\nsheer diversity and quality of scholarship on the subject mat-\nter. Instead, the concern is to solicit fresh and alternative per-\nspectives on why the post-colonial state has been a victim of\nseemingly endless crisis. Essentially, this article located the\nroots of state failure in Nigeria in the queer character of mod-\nern state formation occasioned as it were, not by true nation-\nalism but by the pursuit of parochial agenda masquerading as\nnationalism. The notion of proto-nationalism, in our view,\nbest defines this strange, largely fake, typology of national-\nism. In his seminal work Nations and Nationalism since\n1870: Programme, Myth, and Reality, the British social his-\ntorian E. J. Hobsbawm provided a strong theoretical anchor\nto moor the discourse on proto-nationalisms (Hobsbawm,\n2004). According to him, proto-nationalism describes the\n\"bonds\" existing in human beings with tangential collectivi-\nties or community of interest and purpose, pursuing mem-\nbers' goals on a macro-political scale to the exclusion of\nothers, whom they regard as strangers. For Hobsbawm,\nmembers in these \"bonds\" may not necessarily belong to the\nsame ethnic group but still share certain feelings of collective\nbelonging, which they vigorously pursue. Another point\nfrom his conceptualization of proto-nationalisms is that the\nselect groups are eventually capable of converting their\nbonds and vocabularies of mobilization into generalizations\nabout their desires for and engagement with the state, colo-\nnial and post-colonial.\nFurthermore, another core attribute of proto-nationalism,\naccording to Hobsbawm, is that the elites and their proto-\nnationalist ideas are often insulated from ethnicity, racism, or\n\"negative views of others\" (2004, p. 18). He, however, raised\na caveat that although racism or ethnicity may not be impor-\ntant in developing proto-nationalism, its role become essen-\ntial in gaining mass appeal by the elites, most especially\nwhen the need to democratize nationalism arises (Hobsbawm,\n2004). At these crucial times, it would seem that proto-\nnationalists would not hesitate to draw on xenophobic senti-\nments for reinventing the idea of national superiority to\nmobilize the masses. Significantly, this perspective identi-\nfied a positive correlation between archetypes of nationalism\nand mobilization against those considered to be out-group,\narguing, in fact, that \"there is no more effective way of bond-\ning together the disparate section of restless peoples than to\nunite them against outsiders\" (p. 18). In one instance, there-\nfore, proto-nationalists could express repulsion against eth-\nnicity or racism, while in another, non-hesitant to mobilize\nthem to attract mass consciousness.\nOnly two out of the plethora of developments associated\nwith proto-nationalism are particularly relevant here, espe-\ncially given the manner in which they have assumed rele-\nvance and resilience, for good or bad, in post-independence\nNigeria: religion and ethnicity (Norbu, 2005). It has long\nbeen established that a strong linkage exists between nation-\nalistic struggle and religion (Hvithamar, 2009). Hobsbawm\n(2004, p. 68), again, insisted that religion is an ancient and\nwell-tried method for establishing communion through com-\nmon practice and sort of brotherhood between people, who\notherwise have nothing in common. In terms of how the\npower configuration of nationalism affects the masses, he\nargued that religion is an issue around which members of\ncommunities coalesced in the era of proto-nationalism\nsubmission of Denzer (2007). In his article titled \"Anti-\nColonial Movements, Sub-Saharan Africa\" published in the\nEncyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice, the author\ndescribed how \"[R]eligious institutions were especially resil-\nient vehicles for the organisations of widespread resistance\nthat often cut across ethnic groups and colonial boundaries\"\n1928, the Nyabingi religious cult successfully organized and\nprosecuted recurrent inter-colonial rebellions in British\nUganda and German (later Belgian) Rwanda. However, the\nstruggle for independence in Nigeria hardly involved reli-\ngious coloration. Except probably in the northern part, where\ncall for unity centered on Islam as Attahiru, the Caliph of\nSokoto, famously \"attempted to evade certain British con-\nquest by conducting hijira\" in 1903 (p. 6), the major item of\nconflict during the decolonization period was ethnicity. It is\nessential to be added, however, that after independence, reli-\ngion surfaced as the instrument of unity and force for the\n6 SAGE Open\npromotion of sectional interest and of violence (Olaiya,\n2014). Religious intolerance is thus a major institutional fail-\nure in Nigeria, and despite the entrenchment of secularism in\nues to wreck ominous havoc on the Nigerian governance.\nIn this regard, the notion and practice of ethnicity, some-\ntimes with religious undertone, is rampant (Omotola, 2010).\nSince independence, Nigeria has experienced \"a catalogue of\nethno-religious conflicts that resulted in an estimated loss of\nover 3 million lives and unquantifiable psychological and\nmaterial damages\" (Salawu, 2010, p. 1). Nigeria has more\nthan 400 ethnic groups, distributed among two major reli-\ngions of mainly Christianity and Islam (Salawu, 2010).\nDespite these formidable statistics, it does not mechanically\nfollow that the sheer large number of the ethnic groups and\ntribes should translate to tribalism and ethnocentrism (Ukeje\n& Adebanwi, 2006). A possible explanation must therefore\nbe in the hasty and uncritical manner in which the proto-\nnationalists accepted the state making without making neces-\nsary recourse to work on the psyche of the populace as a\nnation. As propagated by writers on proto-nationalism, mod-\nernization is a feature of proto-nationalism (Hobsbawm,\n2004), but the Nigerian case runs to the contrary. Ethnicity\namong the majority groups and minority groups in both pre-\nand post-independent era has challenged the popular linkage\nbetween proto-nationalism and advent of modernization.\nThere are countless cases of clashes among the ethnic groups,\nin which properties and city monuments are destroyed.\nOn the political scene, an institution of zoning formula is\nused to adopt candidates for important party positions, elec-\ntive and appointive offices, without respect for democratic\nvalues or acumen. Hence, Nigeria's political and economic\nperformance falls below par in comparison with other coun-\ntries of comparable size and resources. The \"federal charac-\nter\" principle introduced by the 1979 Constitution, and\ncontinued in 1999 Constitution, was designed to ensure the\nequitable representation of various ethnic groups in the\nnational affairs, most especially insofar as federal appoint-\nments are very much concerned. Related to the quota system\nand Federal character policy is the educationally disadvan-\ntaged states clause,2 which opportune indigenes of states so\nlabeled to be considered for admission into federal educa-\ntional institutions at grades far less than merit point.\nHowever, the implementation of this principle leaves so\nmuch to desire. The problem is obviously more than the fact\nthat \"it tends to sacrifice merit for mediocrity leading to disaf-\nis the non-recognition of the cultural needs and true demo-\ngraphic strength of the ethnic groups. Thus apart from the\nclueless implementation of the policy, its conception took no\ncognizance of the diverse ethno-cultural peculiarities of the\nnationalities and their drive and needs in which, for instance,\nthe educational infrastructural needs of each state differ, and\nin some cases, very tremendously. The general implication of\nethno-religious politicking is that ethnocentrism and lack of\npatriotism reign supreme. The political atmosphere is domi-\nnated by \"big men\" rather than \"big institutions,\" as identified\nby President Barrack Obama of the United States.3 The vast\nmajority of the populace is politically relegated to passive\nonlookers, not even voters, as the votes do not count again\ndue to widespread electoral malpractices.\nIn the light of all the above, a recurrent implication of the\nresilience of proto-nationalism has been the characteristic\nlack of politicization in terms of social communication and\nmass mobilization in a manner that could easily key the citi-\nzenry into any broad national agenda, in a manner that is\nsustainable, \"own-able,\" and patriotic. Thus, when a society\nis constructed from the crucible of proto-nationalism, it is\nunlikely for it to transcend the challenges of frequent--often\ndivisive--particularistic interests, as the post-colonial expe-\nriences of Nigeria in the section that follows reveal.\nProto-Nationalism and the Governance\nMisadventures in Nigeria\nThere is a particularly critical genre of scholarship that\nargued that nationalism never took place in Nigeria (Norbu,\n2005), at least, going by the definition of the concept not as\npopular loyalty to the states manufactured from colonial ter-\nritories and its legalistic and Eurocentric characteristics dic-\ntated by colonialism but as a distinctive type of politicized\nsocial consciousness originating from within the core of the\nsocietal fabrics (Norbu, 2005). According to Norbu, nation-\nalism connotes the mobilization of broad-based national--\nrather than group--consciousness to wrest power from (not\nto wrestle with) the imperialists. In this regard, it is seen as a\n\"specific historical phenomenon\" involving the holistic\nreconfiguration of the social consciousness of a nation, and\nbeyond this, the spillover of such consciousness in the politi-\ncal and economic sphere as a prelude to the emergence of an\nindustrial society (Norbu, 2005). The integration would nat-\nurally increase social communication among members\nwithin a given society. He wrote that\nnationalism is the resultant ideological expression of a highly\norganized and politicized society, with its both rational and non-\nrational foundations. Its non-rational aspects which provide\nprotein for nationalism predates the modern nation-state and\nwithout such a psychic core, nationalism would be practically\ninconceivable in the modern era. In short, nationalism cannot be\ninvented by a minority; it has to be passionately felt by the\nmajority. (p. 29, emphasis added)\nThe thrust of Norbu's (2005) argument, therefore, was\nthat nationalism in its essentialist form never really occurred\nin Nigeria not only for the predominantly bourgeois charac-\nter of the struggle for independence but also for the fact that\nthe focus was on capturing power instead of real national\nemancipation. This is an often ignored perspective, but one\nthat is critical in understanding why the operators of the\ncommercial and industrial segments of the colonial infra-\nstructure did not feel sufficiently threatened to leave with\ntheir political, military, and consular counterparts as soon as\nindependence was achieved. It seemed obvious to them that\nthe three dominant regional political parties were divided in\npurpose and only eager to occupy the political space leaving\neconomic space, like the British firms like the UnitedAfrican\nCompany (UAC), John Holt, Leventis, intact (Crowder,\n1987). The peculiar brand of African nationalism and its con-\nnotations have been aptly canonized by Frantz Fanon in\n1966. Even though Fanon was referring to Africa as a whole,\nhis narrative bespoke the circumstances surrounding nation-\nalism in Nigeria, more than elsewhere (Mkandawire, 2005).\nFanon argued vehemently against bourgeois anti-colonial\nnationalism whose goal he saw as \"quite simply . . . [to]\ntransfer into native hands . . . those unfair advantages which\nare the legacies of colonialism.\" Their mission, according to\nhim, \"has nothing to do with transforming the nation; it con-\nsists, prosaically, of being the transmission line between the\nnation and a capitalism, rampant though camouflaged, which\ntoday puts on the mask of neo-colonialism\" (quoted in\nBecause British colonialism formed Nigeria through a\nprocess likable to political artificial insemination, which\nbrought a disparate group of peoples and regions together,\nthe nationalism that became a political factor in Nigeria dur-\ning the interwar period derived less from any sense of com-\nmon nationality than pan-Africanism (Mkandawire, 2005).\nIndeed, the initial goal of this struggle was not self-determi-\nnation but simply to secure greater participation in gover-\nnance at the regional level. Inconsistencies in British policy\nreinforced cleavage along regional lines as regional elites\nsimultaneously struggled to preserve the indigenous cultures\nof each area while embracing modernity (British ways of\ngovernance). In the North, however, the widespread appeal\nof Islamic religion did not only uphold the rule and legiti-\nmacy of the emirs but also ensured that the bourgeoning\nnationalist sentiments were decidedly anti-Western. In the\nSouth, however, the largely westernized nationalist elites\nopposed indirect rule, considering it an anathema for exclud-\ning them from the political space.\nThe Nigerian state has certainly passed through a number\nof hard times. Much and recurrent as the problems are, there\nhave never been a dearth of attempts to locate the bottom\nline. Generally, much of the criticisms have been leveled\nagainst the politicians, who have purportedly derailed the\nlegacy of liberal democracy inherited from the colonial mas-\nters, and the military, who have ruled the nation much more\nthan the civilian administration and have perpetuated more\nsocioeconomic atrocities. In terms of governance dividends,\nthe report cards of the military have been worse than that of\nthe politicians considering all indices for measurement of\ngovernance. The \"high hope\" that Nigeria will emerge as a\ndominant power bloc was soon truncated by military coup\n(Siollun, 2009). The military have wrecked most havoc in\nthe Nigerian governance crisis as all indices of institutional\ncollapse received more knocks even after the advent of \"cor-\nrection\" regimes. This complements, to an extent, the belief\nin some quarters that the military in politics are agency of\nconservatism and destabilization, as well as that of economic\nright quotation about the Nigerian military from Professor\nBilly J. Dudley, as follows:\n. . . their (the military) incapacity to rule derives, not from the\nfact that they lack legitimacy, but that, like the politicians they\nhave ousted, they get caught in the cross current of personal,\nlineage, clan, ethnic and other loyalties and sentiments which\ninfluenced and shaped the actions of politicians. (p. 98, emphasis\nin original)\nHowever, we intend to posit that military advent and the ulti-\nmate misadventure into the Nigerian politics are products of\ncolonization, decolonization, and queer nationalistic strug-\ngles all of which jointly and severally configured the state of\nNigeria. Broadly, we intend to argue that the origin of mili-\ntary rule in Africa lied with nature and style adopted in the\ncolony, when most political resistance were finally resolved\nby military incursions and where constabulary police are\nused freely to silence all voices of dissents. A renowned his-\ntorian argued that\nthe many studies of resistance to colonial occupation have\nshown that for the most part the colonial state was conceived in\nviolence rather than by negotiation. This violence was often\nquite out of proportion to the task in hand, with burnings of\nvillages, destruction of crops, killing of women and children and\nthe execution of leaders . . . The colonial state was not only\nconceived in violence, but it was maintained by the free use of it\n. . . Indeed if the colonial state provided a model for its inheritors\nit was that government rested not on consent but force. [And]\nnot a few of those who eventually inherited power knew from\nThis claim becomes robust by the assertion that military\nofficers who trained and served under the colonial armies in\nWest Africa impelled the proliferation of military coups in\nthe sub-region; a situation that only worsened the problem of\ncorruption (Kieh & Agbese, 2004). However, military mis-\nrule originated from the nature of colonial rule in its \"delib-\nerate discouragement of mass politics as all military and\nquasi-military regimes are liable to do\" (Ekeh, 1996, p. 35).\nwhatever legitimacy . . . the colonial authorities possessed\nderived . . . from the monopoly of the means of the means of\nviolence . . . Colonial administrators were in fact \"praetors\" and\nthe system of rule was authoritarian and dictatorial. (p. 35)\nFrom the above, it seems clear that the seed of military incur-\nsion and their misrule and most certainly the civilian lack of\n8 SAGE Open\nrespect for rule of law had been sown during the colonial era\nonly waiting to be [and did get] activated after independence.\nCorruption is yet another problem for which Nigerian\ngovernance crisis has been explained. There can be no doubt\nthat corruption and lack of accountability pervade Nigerian\npublic and private institutions, and the corrupt practices have\ntaken an adverse toll on the governance of the nation. We\nhowever argue that corruption in Nigeria is more of a product\nof modern governance system established and continually\nfanned by the embers of colonial aristocratic heritage,\nwhereby the rulers live large at the expense of the people. For\ninstance, the colonial Governor \"enjoyed to the full the out-\nward trappings of power, living in an imposing palace, driven\nin large limousines flying the flag, deferred to by all, and on\nceremonial occasions dressed in cocked hat and plumes and\ntherefore be appropriate to argue that lack of accountability\nfor public fund resulting in such affluent lifestyle on the part\nof European officers coupled with lack of proper institution\nof necessary checks, which made such impunity impossible\nin the home countries of the colonial masters, and which the\nhurried circumstances of the independence disallowed in the\nnew states, are germane factors for the entrenchments and\npervasiveness of corruption in the sub-region.\nAs far as policy failure is concerned, public policies are\nnot arrived at by trial and errors made without the historical\nor socioeconomic preconditions (Mkandawire & Soludo,\n1999). According to them, the initial conditions must neces-\nsarily take into cognizance the \"nature of colonial rule and\nthe institutional arrangements it bequeath the former colo-\nnies, the decolonization process, and the economic interests\nand policies of the erstwhile colonial masters\" (Mkandawire\n& Soludo, 1999, pp. 2, 3). It therefore follows that to avoid\nthe invidious socioeconomic and political manifestations\nafflicting most African states, a painstaking appreciation in\nthe initial condition is essential, and that wrongly specifying\nthese initial conditions can undermine the potentials of the\npolicies.\nNationalism and Governance Crisis in\nNigeria\nA number of explanations have been outlined for the recal-\ncitrance of governance or state failure in Nigeria. A good\nstarting point is that there is need for a development para-\ndigmatic shift, which would explain and offer solutions to\nproblems of industrialization, agriculture, and other eco-\nnomic development component. Nationalism is deeply con-\nnected to economic development (Mkandawire, 2005).\nNationalist project is an important key to nation building\nand economic development; the two are virtually insepara-\nAnother opinion is that development idea fostered on the\neconomy is alien and therefore forlorn; an opinion that is as\nfalse as it is insulting to Nigerian intellectuals and political\nleaders who have toiled relentlessly to seek material progress\nto the Nigerian society. In fact, looking at the nationalism\nhistoriography, it is clear that development, described as the\neradication of \"unholy trinity of ignorance, poverty, and dis-\nfocus of nationalist agenda. Indeed, a common slogan against\ncolonialism was the failure to provide clear development\nframework for industrialization and mechanization of agri-\nculture (Crowder, 1987). Yet, upon the attainment of inde-\npendence, the central objectives of those lofty development\nideas, muted and vituperatively propounded were derailed by\nthe nationalists themselves from the blueprints to fulfill neo-\ncolonialist agenda.\nNigeria's social pluralism is understandably a cog in\nterms of modernization, nation building, development, and\ngovernance. Babangida (2002) argued that colonialism and\nthe political economy of the post-colonial state have engen-\ndered several dimensions of \"pluralism, complexity and cor-\nporatism in the country.\"According to him, the social classes,\nwhich have accelerated in development since the Nigerian\nCivil War in response to public policies on the economy,\nhave multiplied the segments of social stratification.\nNigeria's nationalists may have recognized the fissiparous\npotential early and chose to ignore or banish any political or\neconomic idea based on these identities by accepting the\nnational frontiers as outlined by the colonialists. There were\nsharp disagreements among the nationalists during various\ndebates for independence, especially between Sir Ahmadu\nBello and Chief Obafemi Awolowo on issues bordering on\nethnic interest (Aboro, 2005); yet, they carried on with the\nproject \"Nigeria.\" Even Hugh Clifford (1921), the colonial\nGovernor who took over from Lord Lugard \"the amalgam-\nator\" of the southern and northern Protectorates, accepted\nthat the project was a mistake when he said the amalgama-\ntion was like \"mixing oil with water\" (p. 12). However, the\nBritish colonialists encouraged tribalistic or regional poli-\ntics. It is also recognized that regional politics introduced\nduring the colonial era remains the bane of the modern poli-\ntics (Balarabe-Musa, 1996). Therefore, there can be nothing\nprogressive about such politics as it tends to create in the\npolitical space the divisive, obscurantist, and retrogressive\nforces. Most significantly, he declared that the British did\nthis to ensure that the political hegemony continues to serve\nforeign powers, \"who keep us [Nigerians] divided so that\nthey can subjugate us and exploit our human and natural\nThere are more compelling reasons to indict that the seed\nof ethnicity was hatched by the British colonialists. For\ninstance, that the term minority was practically unknown to\nthe Nigerian political system (Ekeh, 1996). The term only\nthat prepared Nigeria for independence from British imperial\nrule. But the majority/minority dichotomy that was to\nbecome the apocalypse in the political system was sown with\nthe introduction of indirect rule. As the \"master principle of\ngovernance\" in British colonies, the doctrine was actually a\npolitical instrument for organizing power in colonial Nigeria\nand served to recognize the cultural distinctions in each kin-\nship grouping. However, the doctrine granted limited politi-\ncal space and interaction by restricting administrative actions\nwithin each locality, which explains the lack of inter-ethnic\npolitical interactions among the various ethnic groupings\nprior to the 1950s in Nigeria. Apart from intra-ethnic politi-\ncal apathy that indirect rule engendered, by dint of one rule\nor the other, it imposed restrictions on inter-ethnic relations\neven in more severe manner than it obtained prior to coloni-\ndevotion to the theory and practice of Indirect Rule not only\nossified . . . development in Nigeria, it retarded constitutional\ngrowth . . . [This is especially the case with Northern Nigeria\nwhich] continues [to exist] in peaceful isolation from the South,\nscreened from . . . outside influences by [British] political\nofficers and the dogma of Indirect Rule. (p. 36)\nDuring the decolonization period of the 1950s, the major-\nity ethnic groups dominated the politics in each of the three\nregions, except in the northern region where the dominant\nforce was actually in firm grip of the minority Fulani (Ekeh,\n1996). In the South, demographic advantage worked in favor\nof the Yoruba and Igbo to become political power holders\nrespectively in Western and Eastern Regions, while other\nethnic groupings, including Benin, Ijaw, and Efik, became\nminority ethnic groups. In the North, power was comfortably\nin the hands of the minority Fulani who exercised dominance\non the Hausa, Nupe, and Ilorin-Yoruba, whom they con-\nquered, and on the Tiv and other northern ethnic groups,\n\"whom the Fulani did not conquered\" (p. 37). In the end, the\nBritish imperialists were the gainers while the Nigerians, due\nlargely to ethnic struggles, were largely uncoordinated and in\nfact unaware of the need to be.\nIn addition, indirect rule created a gulf between the\nfavored traditional elites, who ruled the people, and the side-\ntracked educated elites, in vanguard of the people. Although\nit has also been argued that most of these educated elites\nthemselves, having been schooled abroad demonstrated\nmore of \"external referential framework\" and a \"compro-\nmised and ambivalent psychological and ideological disposi-\ntion toward the methods and objectives of the national\nliberation struggle\" (Iweriebo, 1996, p. xv). Thus, it suffices\nto argue that the Nigerian nationalism lacked the pedagogy\nand iconography necessary for a nuanced pragmatism and\nconsummate demand for independence. Nigeria emerged\nfrom British colonial rule with a multiparty system, which\nordinarily should promote democratic governance. However,\napart from the crucial fact that the political parties were not\ndifferentiated or distinguished from each other by any politi-\ncal or economic ideology, they were essentially ethnic and\nregionally based, and were preoccupied with promoting eth-\nnic and regional interests. Two of the largest parties, the\nNorthern Peoples' Congress (NPC) and the Northern\nElements Progressive Union (NEPU), represented and pur-\nsued the interests of the predominantly Muslim Northern\nNigeria. The other leading parties, the National Council of\nNigerian Citizens (NCNC) and the Action Group (AG), were\npreoccupied with the interests of the southeast and southwest\nwhere they were, respectively, based. It follows inductively\ntherefore that the political parties were prone to (and did)\nmanipulate Nigeria's constitutional set up in their respective\ncontrol, to wield the country's national wealth and power in\nfavor of ethnic and regional advantage and well-being rather\nthan distributing the nation's power and resources equitably\namong its nationality groups. Unfortunately, this issue con-\ntinues to dominate Nigerian politics in spite of the formation\nof more comprehensive national parties in the late 1970s and\nearly 1990s. The formation of the self-acclaimed \"largest\nparty in Nigeria\" (PDP), among other major parties with\nsemblances of national outlook, hardly removed the procliv-\nity for ethnic sentiments.\nGoing by the crop and pedigree of the personalities\ninvolved in the struggle for independence, it is expected that\nthey recognize \"divide-and-rule\" tactics of the colonialists to\nfoster the colonial hegemony yet acquiesced to the pluralism\nego by forming political parties in the wake of independence\nalong ethnic background. With the formation of these major\nparties--NPC for Northern agenda, Action Congress for\nWestern agenda, and NCNC for Eastern agenda--the seed of\nintense ethnic crisis that later culminated in the formation of\narmed ethnic militias was sown. To depict more of the lack of\nnational consciousness in the Nigerian nationalist move-\nment, there was no conscious effort on the part of the move-\nment to entrench it in school curriculum for bottom\u00adup\norientation. For instance, it was only in 1969 in Nigeria,\nmuch after independence, that a \"reference was made to\nunity, nationalism, patriotism, and the like in any of our\nNationalism colored economic policies in particular ways\n(Mkandawire & Soludo, 1999). First, the nation-state was\npolicy's unit of analysis. As such, the state's preoccupation\nwas with the perceived welfare of its citizens not with maxi-\nmizing some global welfare function. Second, the state\nwould tend to favor nationals or would try to remedy inher-\nited imbalances in the ownership of property or access to\neconomic resources. Third, in lieu of an indigenous capitalist\nclass, the state would assume many entrepreneurial tasks\nregardless of its overall ideological position. Much has been\nwritten on the relationship between nationalism, the exigen-\ncies of nation building, and policy (Mkandawire & Soludo,\n1999). Suffice it to note that nationalist impulses partially\nexplain the policies that have been identified exclusively\nwith rent seeking (nationalization, import substitution,\nexpenditure on education, pan-territorial pricing, etc.). Thus,\nnationalism could simultaneously account for some of the\nsacrifices and commitment behind successes and some of the\nchauvinism and xenophobia behind disasters. Significantly,\nnationalism influences the perceptions that policies are exter-\nnally imposed or likely to compromise national sovereignty\nPerhaps Nigerian nationalism as movement for political\nemancipation, like her cohorts in Africa, also lacked the nec-\nessary identity originality that could galvanize it and translate\nto development and curb governance crisis. If we go by Wole\nSoyinka's (1977) semiotic nationalism4 on the construction of\nAfrica and the misgivings he proclaimed in the word \"Africa\"\nas a basis for lack of identity and nay Africa's governance\ncrisis, then an extrapolation to the Nigerian context would be\napt. Soyinka argued, in a speech delivered at the 1977 Second\nWorld Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture\n(FESTAC), that the moniker \"Africa\" lacked the indigenous\nmateriality, reality, and distinctiveness.Another author argued\nthat the name is, at best, a \"discursive fantasy, an unstable and\nambivalent sign that cannot provide a foundational basis for\nan identity, an invention prey to and prime for deconstruc-\nlacked identities, just as it did language, and that most of the\nstates are European inventions, mutually constitutive existen-\ntial and epistemic construction. As inventions, the states are\ndenaturalized of cultural artifacts and practices and striped of\nprimordial authenticity and essentialism. In other words,\nAfrica is as much a superficial entity as it is a construct whose\nboundaries--geographical, historical, cultural, and represen-\ntational--have shifted according to the prevailing concep-\ntions and configurations of colonially created identities and\npower, and proto-nationalism that followed it, including pre-\nand post-independence pan-Africanism.\nThe case of Nigeria follows logically. That the name\n\"Nigeria\" was coined by a British journalist (Flora Shaw)\nwho later became the wife of the first Governor-General of\nlack of definite identity. Accordingly, \"the name was sug-\ngested for the collection of protectorates and colonies around\nRiver Niger\" (Ajala, 2009, p. 1). Apart from the claim that\nNigeria is \"like mixing oil with water\" by one of the authors\nand finishers of the amalgamation of Nigeria as a state, there\nare indications that the nationalists themselves were well\naware of the identity crisis. For instance, Chief Obafemi\nAwolowo argued in 1964, while expounding his thesis on\nfederalism, that\nNigeria is not a nation. It is a mere geographical expression.\nThere are no Nigerians in the same sense as there are English,\nWelsh, or French. The word \"Nigerian\" is merely a distinctive\nappellation to distinguish those who live within the boundaries of\nNigeria from those who do not. (Quoted in Olayode, 2005, p. 9)\nEthnicity, Nationalism, and Emergence\nof Governance Crisis in Nigeria\nThere is a striking similitude in the emergence of states in\nAfrica and how lack of national consciousness is a serious\nissue afflicting the governance of these states. Almost across\nboard, the endurance of the nation-state culture as an over-\narching political culture is closely tied to how ethnicity is\nproduced, transformed, and twisted in response to different\ncircumstances and situations (Zeleza, 2006). In Ethnicity: An\nAfrican Predicament, Francis Deng observed that virtually\nall modern African governance crises (and conflicts) have\nethno-regional dimension (Deng, 1997). In contemporary\nAfrica, the role of ethnicity in political systems received a\nknock with the ambition of Western-trained education elite\n\"proto-nationalist,\" to accept the frontiers of the emergent\nindependent African states constructed by colonial rule as\nAfrica, the \"nationalists\" identified themselves as Nigerians\nrather than Yoruba, Hausa, or Igbo; Gold Coaster rather than\nAkan, Ewe, or Guan; Senegalese rather than Wollof; Ivoirians\nthe intention of the colonialists was not to eradicate ethnicity\nbut to stem the expressions of nationalism they produce and\nperhaps also to prevent tribal conflicts. Thus, as a creation of\ncolonial rule ethnicity was partly responsible for sowing the\nseeds of democratic and governance misadventures that soon\nbecame rampant in post-colonial Africa. European colonial-\nists set Africans against Africans by hand picking pliable col-\nlaborators, constituted by the group that Frantz Fanon (1980)\ncalls the \"benis oui oui\" or the \"yes yes men\" (Fanon, 1980,\np. 23). It also facilitated the subjugation of African masses\nbecause ethnic strife provided an excuse for repressive mili-\ntary and police actions by colonial authorities--develop-\nments that, in turn, triggered the spate of coup d'\u00e9tat in most\nWest African states.\nClearly, also, the states so formed, its citizens, officials,\nand indeed the political parties, lacked a strong sense of\nnationhood that placed them on the threshold of disastrous\ncollapse at different times (Clifford, 1921). As, from the\nforegoing, most post-colonial West African states are not\nfashioned as public property but to serve parochial and eth-\nnic interest of those who created and control them, confusion\nroutinely developed between notions of statehood vis-\u00e0-vis\nnationhood. In Nigeria, key ethnic militia groups Oodua\nPeoples'Congress(OPC),theMovementfortheActualization\nof the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), the Arewa\nBoys, the Egbesu Boys, the Movement for the Survival of\nOgoni Peole (MOSOP) successfully defined and controlled\npolitical outcomes in their respective regions, including the\nformation and administration of political parties (Ajala,\n2009). But, then, ethnicity by itself is not the problem (Ukeje\n&Adebanwi, 2006). Instead, the problem of ethnicity derives\nfrom the manner in which it is mobilized by the political\nelite. The point had been pursued by noting,\nBecause access to state power is recognized by most ethnic\ngroups as a requisite for self and collective motivation,\nexpression and reproduction, the local elites and ethnic\nentrepreneurs within group set the tone and agenda of politics in\nways that are parochial, beneficial to themselves principally and\nthen to the larger group. When the opportunity to access state\npower is forestalled, therefore, one of the first defensive\nmechanisms that an ethnic group readily mobilizes is that of\ncollective, non-violent action but it scales up steadily towards\nmilitancy and violence. (pp. 2-4)\nIndeed, the Tiv ethnic protest on the eve of Nigerian indepen-\ndence (Crowder, 1987) runs deep to indicate that not all eth-\nnic groups were carried along in the independence debates. It\ncould also portend that not all germane issues were exhaus-\ntively ironed out during the decolonization process. At the\nvery time, the Nigerian flag was being hoisted to replace the\nUnion Jack, a deadly riot was taking place in Tivland. Thus,\neven if ethnicity is not a problem of its own, a mishandling\nof the mechanics for amalgamation of peoples of disparate\ncultures and tempers can only be a time bomb waiting to\nexplode. It was thus argued that the 1914 amalgamation \"was\na token . . . which did not truly bring them [the two regions]\ninto a meaningful relationship with each other\" (p. 18).\nPerhaps one area where the lingering effect of this dys-\nfunctional post-colonial development most vividly expresses\nitself has been in the formation of political parties along eth-\nnic lines, with the bigger and dominant political parties\ncoming from the largest ethnic groups while smaller ethnic\ngroups produce weaker political parties. The formation of\nethnically motivated political parties, mostly through the\nactive connivance of colonial officials, led to the implosion\nof political parties with evident lack of internal democratic\nculture and values that is at the root of the generic failure of\ndemocracies in the sub-region. In Nigeria, for instance, the\nthree major political parties formed during the heydays of\nindependence were along ethno-regional lines: the NPC,\nAG, and National Council of Nigerians and the Cameroons\n(NCNC) dominated by Hausa/Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo,\nrespectively. During the Second Republic, the major politi-\ncal parties were also formed along ethnic lines with the\nNational Party of Nigeria (NPN), Peoples' Redemption\nParty (PRP), and Great Nigeria Peoples' Party (GNPP) rep-\nresenting the North, the Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN), and\nNigerian People's Party (NPP) representing the South-West\nand South-East, respectively. Although the nascent political\nculture that is under construction since the return to civilian\nrule in 1999 has shown pan-Nigeria tendencies, especially\nwith membership and the activities of the key political par-\nties (PDP, AC, All Progressives Grand Alliance [APGA],\nProgressive Peoples Alliance [PPA]) cutting across tradi-\ntional sectional divides, ethnicity continues to show a\nremarkable resilience in political discourses and contesta-\ntions as the recent hot debate on zoning within the ruling\nparty, the PDP, shows. The inevitable, even if tentative, con-\nclusion is that in spite of recent developments associated\nwith the transition to multiparty rule in the sub-region, the\nold pathologies associated with ethnicity and other sectional\nexpressions have not receded--in some instances, indeed,\nthey have witnessed a resurgence in a manner that threatens\npolitical and governance process. There is a considerable\nagreement that formation of parties along ethnic lines is\ncapable of creating \"real tension among the ethnic groups\n. . . mutual distrust among competing communities . . . and\nconflict of interest,\" which \"often escalated into political\naccording to him, is that in many instances, the political vio-\nlences created in the polity have \"led to fundamental shifts\nin the Nigerian political system and political instabilities.\"\nConclusion\nment of \"strong men\" rather than \"strong institutions\"\nthrough manipulation of the ballot box or the barrels of the\ngun, the expropriation of the resources of the state by the few\nand the apparent progressive immiseration of the masses as a\nresult are the lots of Nigeria in the 50 years as an independent\ncountry. Within these years, Nigeria appropriates a ready\nappellation and the signification of a country where there is\nlittle if any hope in all spheres of governance and economic\nindicators. Rule of law is practically ostracized, personal and\nmaterial security is at low ebb, violent and irrepressible reli-\ngious and ethno-nationalist struggles are on the progressive\nrise, the economy cannot compete favorably even within the\nregion, using various economic measurements, despite the\nhuge petro-dollar revenue accruing since the early 1970s,\nand, worst of all, the political environment is antithetical.\nMost of the above have been attributed to the plethora of\nmilitary rule, invariably staged in the name of cleansing the\nstate but which left the nation worse-off. Nevertheless, the\nrespite of brief elective form of government between 1979\nthe nation's political history, deepening further the much-\npublicized lack of prospect for liberal democracy bestowed\nby the British colonial masters.\nDevelopment economists too have advanced the\nresource curse argument and Dutch disease syndrome as\nthe bane of the country's oil economy that led to a mono-\nlithic economy that retarded development and bred corrupt\npractices and violent politics. This article debunked each\nof the claims in these theses and asserted that the root is\nindeed the colonial heritage of disparate nationalities cob-\nbled together 50 odd years before and the insular nature of\nthe nationalist that led to the queer nature of state making\nin Nigeria. Given the paucity of attention given to building\nnational political and economic structure by the colonial\nrulers, the agitation for more involvement to participate in\nthe political governance by the nationalists, which derailed\nthe conscience of Nigerian nationalism, and the elitist\nnature of the decolonization process, which precluded dia-\nlogue by all stakeholders, the present governance crisis is\nnot far-fetched.\nIt was precisely for this reason, as the article argued, that\nsuccessive post-colonial administrations, following the\ndivide-and-rule traditions of the colonial state, have failed to\nmobilize the type of popular support and collective resources\nrequired to construct a truly broad-based and inclusive\nnational identity required to manage and transcend protracted\ncrisis of governance in Nigeria. The article therefore advo-\ncates a composite political dialogue of all stakeholders where\nthe stakes and shares will be exhaustively thrashed out.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1.
