Moreover, a great reduction of DHEAS concentration is\nfound under conditions of extreme physical stress, such as with severe burns\nlevels consistently occurring under adverse health conditions have led to the\nThe work described here was accomplished with the assistance of Berrilyn Branch and Greg Rose.\nThe research was funded by grants to the author from the Office of Naval Research and the Veterans\nAdministration.\nAddress correspondence to David Diamond, Department of Psychology, University of South Florida,\nddiamond@chuma1.cas.usf.edu\nsuggestion that supplementation with DHEAS may serve a preventive role in\nameliorating the adverse symptoms of aging, disease, and stress. DHEAS ad-\nministration, therefore, has been evaluated as a potential therapeutic agent\nin the treatment of a broad range of maladies, including AIDS (Clerici\net al., 1997; Araghi-Niknam et al., 1998), Alzheimer's disease (Wolkowitz et al.,\nFor these reasons, there is a large market for DHEAS, which is sold without\na prescription as a dietary supplement. However, whereas the literature on\nthe evidence of low endogenous DHEAS levels in various disease states is ex-\ntensive, the evidence that DHEAS supplementation is of therapeutic value is\nGeertsma and Derksen, 2003). The purpose of this paper is to review and\nsummarize work from my laboratory on the effects of DHEAS supplemen-\ntation on memory and the brain in rats. Specifically, we have investigated\nthe effects of DHEAS administration on cognitive and electrophysiological\naspects of the functioning of the hippocampus, a brain structure that is impor-\ntant for learning and memory processes (Eichenbaum, 2001; Burgess et al.,\ninconsistent effects of DHEAS on mental and physical health in people.\nThere is extensive evidence to indicate that DHEAS has potent modu-\nlatory effects on the nervous system. DHEAS increases synaptic excitability\nPark-Chung et al., 1999). This increase in excitability is particularly important\nbecause neurophysiological models of memory have shown that a reduction\nof GABAergic inhibition can enhance the physiological processes that un-\n1999). Moreover, NMDA receptor activation is a critical component of the\nHere again, DHEAS exerts an effect that is consistent with its role as a memory\nVallee et al., 2001). DHEAS enhances NMDA channel activity and increases\nthe number of NMDA receptors in the hippocampus (Bergeron et al., 1996;\nin the adult hippocampus across a broad range of species, including rats\nand people, and the neurogenesis process appears to be important for new\nDHEAS appears to facilitate this process by stimulating additional neurogen-\nesis and promoting the survival of newly formed cells (Karishma and Herbert,\n2002). Taken together, there is strong evidence that DHEAS supplementa-\ntion exerts a profound facilitating effect on hippocampal functioning in the\nadult.\nDHEAS and Hippocampal Functioning 373\nOn this background of evidence of DHEAS as a positive modulator of hip-\npocampal functioning, my colleagues and I studied the effects of DHEAS ad-\nministration on an electrophysiological model of memory, which is referred\nto as primed burst (PB) potentiation (Rose and Dunwiddie, 1986; Diamond\net al., 1988). The idea in this area of research is that electrical stimulation of\nthe hippocampus mimics the changes in synapses that occur during mem-\nory formation. Thus, a DHEAS-induced modulation of PB potentiation may\nprovide insight into how DHEAS affects learning and memory.\nIn recordings from adult male Sprague Dawley (Charles Rivers) rats, we\nfound a U-shaped dose-response function between DHEAS and PB potentia-\ntion. That is, whereas intermediate doses (24 and 48 mg/kg) of DHEAS given\nintraperitoneally increased both the magnitude and incidence of PB poten-\ntiation, the highest (96 mg/kg) and lowest (6 mg/kg) doses had no effect\n(Diamond et al., 1996). This work provided the first evidence of nonlinear\ndose-response characteristics of DHEAS actions on hippocampal synaptic\nplasticity.\nIn the next phase of the research, we administered DHEAS chronically\nto rats in their drinking water and then tested their spatial learning and\nmemory in the Morris water maze. In this task, rats learn to escape from\nwater immersion by learning and then remembering the location of a fixed\nplatform, which is hidden just beneath the surface of the water (Brandeis\net al., 1989). Rats learn spatial information rapidly and are highly motivated\nto escape from the water. Thus, a reduction in the time to escape across\ntraining trials indicates that a rat has the motivation to escape the water and\nhas learned the location of the hidden platform.\nRats were given the vehicle (lemonade-flavored water) or one of two doses\nweek prior to water maze training. The rats were given five training trials on\nday 1 in which they had up to 2 min/trial to learn the location of the hidden\nplatform. On the second day of training all rats were given a single memory\ntest trial. Rats that remembered the platform location took less time to find\nthe platform than rats that had impaired memory of the platform location.\nOn the first day of training, all three groups reduced their time to find\nthe hidden platform equally over the course of the five training trials, in-\ndicating that they had equivalent learning abilities and that they were all\nmotivated to escape from the water. A difference in performance was ob-\nserved on the 24-h memory test trial. As can be seen from the right-hand\nside of Figure 1, rats given 100 \u00b5g/100 ml of DHEAS-treated water, but not\nthose given 400 \u00b5g/100 ml, were superior (that is, had lower escape laten-\ncies) to rats treated with the vehicle or 400 \u00b5g/100 ml of DHEAS. Thus,\nFIGURE 1 A lower, but not a higher, dose of DHEAS enhanced spatial memory and hippocampal PB\npotentiation. Rats administered 100 \u00b5g/100 ml of DHEAS in their drinking water exhibited superior\nspatial memory (i.e., less time to swim to the hidden platform) to the control (vehicle) and the high-\ndose (400 \u00b5g/100 ml) groups (right-hand side). The group of rats with superior memory also exhibited\nsignificantly greater PB potentiation (left-hand side) than the controls and the group treated with 400 \u00b5g/\n100 ml. Overall, the group chronically treated with 100 \u00b5g/100 ml of DHEAS in their drinking water\nexhibited superior memory and greater hippocampal plasticity.\nthe intermediate dose of DHEAS produced superior spatial memory perfor-\nmance compared to the other two groups (Diamond and Fleshner, 1999).\nWhat might be the basis of the DHEAS-induced enhancement of mem-\nory? To address this question, we recorded PB potentiation in the same an-\nimals that had been trained in the water maze. Once water maze training\nhad been completed, the rats continued to receive DHEAS in their drinking\nwater until the day in which the electrophysiological recordings took place.\nOn that day, the rats were anesthetized with urethane (1.5 g/kg, ip) and PB\nwas recorded in the CA1 region of the hippocampus according to methods\nThe left-hand side of Figure 1 shows the magnitude of PB in the vehicle- and\nDHEAS-treated groups. The dose of DHEAS that enhanced spatial mem-\nory (l00 \u00b5g/100 ml) also increased the magnitude of PB potentiation. The\nmagnitude of PB potentiation was relatively small in the control and high-\ndose groups (21 and 18% increases, respectively) and significantly greater\nin the group that received the intermediate dose (Diamond and Fleshner,\n1999). Thus, the enhanced memory observed in the rats that received the\n100 \u00b5g/100 ml dose may have resulted from the enhanced expression of\nDHEAS and Hippocampal Functioning 375\nhippocampal synaptic plasticity (PB potentiation) occurring selectively at\nthis dose.\nSUMMARY\nI have presented findings on the complex dose-response functions of\nDHEAS on cognitive and electrophysiological aspects of hippocampal func-\ntioning in rats. My group reported that there is an inverted U-shaped re-\nlationship between acute administration of DHEAS and the magnitude of\nsynaptic plasticity (PB potentiation) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.\nIn addition, chronic oral administration of DHEAS produced a complex\ndose-response function, in which the lower dose of DHEAS enhanced both\nmemory and PB potentiation and the higher dose had no effect on either\nmeasure. These findings of complex nonlinear dose-response functions be-\ntween DHEAS and hippocampal functioning may be relevant to the incon-\nsistent effects of DHEAS administration on brain, behavior, and pathological\nconditions in people.\nREFERENCES\nAraghi-Niknam M, Ardestani SK, Molitor M, Inserra P, Eskelson CD, Watson RR.
