Using resulting factors in sex-stratified\nmultivariate negative binomial regression models, we tested for confounding of associations between built and\nsocioeconomic environment characteristics and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Finally, we used\nknowledge gained from factor analysis to construct replicable environmental measures that account for inter-\nrelationships and avoid collinearity.\nResults: Using factor analysis, we identified three built environment constructs [(1) homogenous landscape; 2)\ndevelopment intensity with high pay facility count; 3) development intensity with high public facility count] and two\nsocioeconomic environment constructs [1) advantageous economic environment, 2) disadvantageous social\nenvironment]. In regression analysis, confounding of built environment-MVPA associations by socioeconomic\nenvironment factors was stronger than among built environment factors. In fully adjusted models, MVPA was\nnegatively associated with the highest (versus lowest) quartile of homogenous land cover in males [exp(coeff) (95%\n(Simpson's diversity index, count of pay facilities, count of public facilities, median household income, and crime rate)\nrepresenting each environmental construct replicated associations with MVPA.\nConclusions: Environmental characteristics are inter-related. Both built and SES environments should be incorporated\ninto analysis in order to minimize confounding.

However, built\nand SES environments are theoretically and empirically\ncorrelated; for example, physical activity facilities are\nmore common in wealthier neighborhoods [11] and\nstreets may be more connected in the poor inner-city\n[12]. Therefore, neighborhood health studies that exam-\nine single or narrow sets of environmental characteristics\nare vulnerable to confounding by other environmental\nvariables.\n* Correspondence: pglarsen@unc.edu\n1 Department of Nutrition, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of\nNorth Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nBoone-Heinonen et al.

Pattern analysis techniques such as\nfactor analysis is a common strategy for overcoming col-\nlinearity and accounting for potentially interactive effects\nof environmental characteristics [12-16], but are limited\nin that they are data-driven and population specific. Fur-\nther, extant replicable \"walkability\" and \"urban sprawl\"\nindices [17,18] do not incorporate other potentially\nimportant environmental features such as facilities [2,11].\nFinally, most work has been in constrained geographic\nareas [18] or has used large geographic units such as\nWhile correlations between neighborhood SES and\nbuilt environment characteristics may result from com-\nplex and dynamic relationships, they may also reflect\nindependent clustering of characteristics in space. For\nexample, a suburban neighborhood may exhibit low\nstreet connectivity and higher SES, but low street con-\nnectivity does not necessarily result from having more\nsocial and financial resources. Therefore, we conceptual-\nize the built and SES environments as independent influ-\nences on physical activity, which allows comparison of\nbuilt and SES environments and separation of more mod-\nifiable built environment from less modifiable SES envi-\nronment factors.\nUsing nationally representative data on US adolescents,\na group at risk for dramatic decline in physical activity\n[19,20], we sought to: (1) describe inter-relationships\nbetween a large set of built and SES environment mea-\nsures in a nationally representative sample of adolescents,\n(2) quantify the extent to which inter-related environ-\nment measures confound associations with moderate to\nvigorous physical activity (MVPA), and (3) demonstrate a\nstrategy for using pattern analysis results to construct\nreplicable environment measures that accounts for inter-\nrelationships and avoids collinearity.\nMethods\nStudy population and data sources\nWe used cross-sectional Wave I data from The National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a\ncohort study of 20,745 adolescents representative of the\nple plus subsamples of selected minority and other\ngroupings collected under protocols approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board at the University of North\nCarolina at Chapel Hill. The survey design and sampling\nframe are described elsewhere [21].\nNeighborhood-level variables were created using a\nGeographic Information System (GIS) that links commu-\nnity-level data to Add Health respondent residential loca-\ntions in space and time. Residential locations for\nadolescents in the probability sample (n = 18,924) were\ndetermined from the following sources, in order of prior-\nity: (1) geocoded home addresses with street-segment\ntroid match (n = 205), (4) respondent's geocoded school\nlocation (n = 243). Residential locations were linked to\nattributes of the circular area within 1 and 3 kilometers\n(k) of each respondent residence (Euclidean neighbor-\nhood buffer), block group, tract, and county attributes\nfrom U.S. Census and other federal sources, and Add\nHealth survey data.\nTo facilitate national representation of adolescent\nneighborhood environments, missing environmental data\n(n = 630, 3.3%) was the only exclusion criterion for envi-\nronmental patterning analyses, resulting in 18,294 ado-\nlescents. In estimating associations with MVPA,\nexclusions included self-reported pregnancy (n = 401) or\nmobility disability (n = 122) and Native Americans due to\nsmall sample size (n = 156); of the remaining sample\nmissing individual-level variables, 578 missing environ-\nmental variables, 17 missing both) were also excluded for\nStudy variables\nGIS-derived environmental characteristics\nWe examined built and SES environment measures with\nconceptual relevance or evidence of physical activity rela-\ntionships in existing literature; see Table 1 for variable\ndefinitions and data sources and additional details below.\nWe defined neighborhoods (e.g., 1 or 3 k buffer, or Cen-\nsus tracts) consistent with the strongest associations with\nMVPA in prior analysis (Boone-Heinonen J, Gordon-Lar-\nsen P, Song Y, Popkin BM: What is the relevant neighbor-\nhood area for detecting built environment relationships\nwith physical activity?, submitted).\nWe obtained PA facility counts from a historical data-\nset of U.S. businesses with high overall agreement\nbetween commercial and field data [22] and classified\naccording to 8-digit Standard Industrial Classification\ncodes into overlapping types (Table 1).

Individual-level\nsociodemographic control variables included age at Wave\nI interview, self-identified race (white, black, Asian, His-\npanic), parent-reported annual household income and\nhighest level of education (<high school, high school or\nGED, some college, college degree), and administra-\ntively determined U.S. region (West, Midwest, South,\nNortheast). Distributions of these variables in the analyti-\ncal sample are reported in the Appendix (see Table A1;\nadditional file 1).\nStatistical analysis\nExploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)\nWe used EFA to describe inter-relationships across a\nlarge set of built and SES environment characteristics\n(Table 1). We used the principal factors estimator\nbecause it did not impose distributional constraints,\noblique rotation (oblimin, gamma = 0) because environ-\nmental constructs are theoretically and empirically corre-\nlated, and Kaiser Criterion (Eigenvalue > 1), scree plots,\nand interpretability to determine the number of factors.\nVariables with weak loadings (<0.4) on all factors and\nvariables of interest with substantial cross-loadings (>0.3)\nwere removed from the EFA model. If two or fewer vari-\nables loaded strongly on a single factor, corresponding\nvariables were removed from analysis. To address nega-\ntive Eigenvalues, percent variance explained by each fac-\ntor was calculated using the trace of the correlation\nmatrix as the divisor [30]. EFA of SES environment vari-\nables was conducted separately using the same proce-\ndure.\nRegression analysis\nWe fit two sets of regression models to estimate the rela-\ntionships (1) among the resulting built and SES environ-\nment factors and (2) between the built and SES\nenvironment factors and MVPA. Because street connec-\ntivity measures did not load onto factors but were rele-\nvant to our analysis, we examined one index (alpha) as a\nsingle variable in our models that was not highly corre-\nlated with the built environment factors.\nBuffer-based measures are individual-level variables.\nWhile census tracts and counties could comprise a sec-\nond level in multi-level analysis, they are not nested\nwithin schools, the primary sampling unit and a more\nimportant source of clustering. Additionally, our data\nwere sparse and unbalanced (mean = 8, range = 1-275\nrespondents per census tract), so multilevel analysis may\nhave produced biased estimates [31]. Intraclass correla-\ntions for ln(MVPA) were minimal (0.03; ICC's are not\ndefinable for Poisson distributed outcomes). We there-\nfore used single-level regression models, which corrected\nfor complex survey sampling and were weighted for\nnational representation.\nWe conducted all statistical analyses in Stata version\n10.1. First, in a descriptive analysis examining the associ-\nation between built and SES environments, we used\ncrude linear regression to model each built environment\nfactor and street connectivity (alpha index) as a function\nof SES environment factor quartiles. Second, to investi-\ngate confounding of built environment-MVPA associa-\ntions by other environment variables, we fit a series of\nnegative binomial regression models estimating weekly\nMVPA bouts as a function of built environment factor\nquartiles, controlling for cumulative sets of variables in\nModels 1-3: Model 1 included individual-level sociode-\nmographic variables and one built environment factor or\nalpha; Model 2 added all three built environment factors\nand alpha; Model 3 added a 1-dimensional SES environ-\nment factor. In Model 4, a 2-dimensional SES environ-\nment construct replaced the 1-dimensional factor.\nModels were sex-stratified due to sex differences in phys-\nical activity determinants [32].\n% college educated CT Percent of persons 25 years and older with at least a college education\nMedian household income CT Median household income\n% homeowners CT Percent of households who own (versus rent) their homes\nCrime rate Co Number of non-violent and violent crimes per 100,000 population\n1From the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health Obesity Environment Database\n21 k, 3 k = 1 and 3 kilometer Euclidean buffer; CT = census tract; Co = County. Selected neighborhood definitions were selected because they\nyielded the strongest associations between environment measures and physical activity in previous analysis.\n3Examined in exploratory factor analysis but excluded from final factor solutions based on criteria described in Methods\nTable 1: Built and socioeconomic environment measures:1 data sources and variable descriptions (Continued)\nBoone-Heinonen et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2010, 7:45\nTo account for non-linear relationships, we examined\nquartiles of the environment factors and measures. In\ncontrast to continuous variables with higher-order terms,\nquartiles facilitated comparability with parallel analysis\nusing single measures representing each factor (described\nbelow). For interpretability, results are reported as expo-\nnentiated coefficients, representing the proportion\nincrease in MVPA bouts compared to the lowest quartile.\nConfounding was objectively defined using a >\u00b120%\npercent change in coefficient criterion [100*(current\nmodel-previous model)/previous model]; Models 3 and 4\nwere compared to Model 2. Because large percent\nchanges reflect negligible absolute changes when coeffi-\ncients are very small, our confounding definition was\nmore stringent than the conventional 10% change thresh-\nold. Additionally, percent change was not reported if\ncoefficients remained within \u00b10.04, corresponding to the\napproximate magnitude of marginally statistically signifi-\ncant coefficients.\nAs suggested by Riitters and colleagues [33], we evalu-\nated single environmental measures (guided by strength\nof factor loadings and conceptual considerations) that\ncould potentially serve as proxies for their respective con-\nstructs by replicating Models 1-4 above using single mea-\nsures representing each factor. We selected Simpson's\ndiversity index to represent the homogenous landscape\nfactor. For the intensity factors, the counts of each type of\nfacility were unstable, so non-overlapping pay facility\ntypes (instruction, member, and public fee) were\nsummed. For public facilities, public (rather than youth)\nfacilities were selected due to relevance across age\ngroups. Because the preceding analyses suggested that\nresource counts represented general density of develop-\nment, we separated the availability of resources from den-\nsity by using alternative facilities variables calculated as\nthe number of facilities per 1,000 population in Model 5.\nResults\nPatterning of the built and socioeconomic environments\nThe variability of built and SES environment measures\nincluded in the final factor solutions and subsequent\nanalyses (Table 2) demonstrate the geographic diversity\nof the Add Health population. Percentile values and\nlarger mean (versus median) values illustrate the right-\nskewed distribution of many measures.\nBuilt environment measures were inter-correlated,\nloading onto three factors explaining 70.9% of variation\n(Table 3). Landscape variables loaded onto a single homo-\ngeneous landscape factor (high scores indicate non-\ndiverse landscape) and two development intensity factors\nrepresenting the degree of high intersection and popula-\ntion density and counts of either pay or public physical\nactivity facilities (high scores indicate high development\nintensity). Conceptually, we expected correlation among\nfacilities counts and density variables, so population and\nintersection density were retained despite cross-loadings.\nUnweighted correlations with homogeneous landscape\nintensity (public facilities), respectively; and 0.58 between\nthe two intensity factors. Other street connectivity indi-\nces did not load onto any factors and were therefore\nremoved from factor analysis.\nTwo SES environment factors (Table 4) (unweighted\nsistent with our theorized constructs: one represented\nadvantageous economic environment (high scores indi-\ncate low poverty, high college and median household\nincome), the other represented characteristics typically\nassociated with less desirable health outcomes (disadvan-\ntageous social environment; high scores indicate high pro-\nportion of racial/ethnic minorities and renters and high\ncrime). Because the second factor marginally met inclu-\nsion criteria (Eigenvalue = 0.83), a 1-dimensional SES fac-\ntor was also examined (41.9% of variation explained).\nRelationship between built and SES environments\nUsing factor scores generated from factor analysis, we\nexamined built environment constructs within quartiles\nof the 2-dimensional SES environment constructs. Built\nenvironment factors or alpha street connectivity index\n(analyzed as a single variable because street connectivity\nvariables were not derived into the final factor solution)\nvaried across quartiles of SES factors (Table 5). The two\nSES environment factors were inversely related, but posi-\ntively associated with the intensity factors. SES factors\nwere negatively associated with less homogeneous land-\nscape, whereas the disadvantageous social environment\nfactor was positively associated with connectivity.\nMVPA and built and SES environment factor scores:\nassociations and confounding\nNext, we examined MVPA as a function of built and SES\nenvironment factor scores. By sequentially adjusting for\nadditional variables in Models 1 through 4, we tested for\nconfounding by different sets of environmental charac-\nteristics, quantified by the percent change in coefficients.\nIn males, models adjusted for individual-level sociode-\nmographics (Table 6, Model 1) showed that weekly\nMVPA bouts were 8% lower for males living in areas with\nthe highest versus lowest landscape homogeneity score\nquartile. Analogous results for females showed relation-\nships counter to theory: compared to the lowest quartiles,\nthe highest intensity (pay facilities) and alpha street con-\nnectivity index quartiles were associated with 7% and 8%\nlower MVPA bouts, respectively (Table 7, Model 1).\nWhile inclusion of all four built environment measures\nindicated confounding by other built environment fea-\ntures according to our objective definition, the absolute\nBoone-Heinonen et al.

Comparison of Model 2 to Models 3 and 4\nindicated confounding of MVPA associations with alpha\nand, in females, intensity (public facilities) by SES envi-\nronment measures. The 2-dimensional SES factor (Model\n3) influenced these associations to a greater extent than\nthe 1-dimensional SES factor (Model 4), although abso-\nlute changes in estimates were small.

For example, intersection density is a\nfacilities counts are often used to indicate access to\nresources. However, dense, gridded streets are common\nin city centers [37], which represent a multitude of built,\nsocioeconomic, and other features, and it is intuitive that\nmore physical activity facilities are located in otherwise\ndensely developed areas. Indeed, Cervero and colleagues\n[16] introduced the concept of intensity, representing\ndense population and resources and interpreted as a mea-\nsure of density. Consistent with this conceptualization,\nour study demonstrated that counts of physical activity\nfacilities were strongly linked with population and inter-\nsection density, suggesting that it is important to adjust\nfor density in estimation of physical activity facilities'\neffects. Yet statistical adjustment may be inappropriate\ndue to strong correlation between density measures and\nfacilities counts. Instead, we found that ratios of physical\nactivity facilities per 1,000 population was a useful strat-\negy for separating density from count of facilities, similar\nto Diez Roux and colleagues [2].\nIn contrast, other street connectivity measures did not\nload onto factors in our study, indicating that they were\nnot strongly correlated with each other or with other\naspects of the built environment. Our results contrast\nwith other studies showing constructs with multiple con-\nnectivity index indicators [12,14]. This discrepancy may\nbe explained by the national scope of Add Health as\nopposed to one or more metropolitan areas in the studies\nnoted. Connectivity indices are ratios of various compo-\nnents such as number of intersections, street segments,\nand route alternatives, so they may reflect different con-\nstructs in areas with high versus low component values.\nLikewise, Ewing et al [17] reported a single principal\ncomponent representing urban sprawl characterized by\nresidential density, land use mix, and street accessibility\nin a national sample, but their study was also limited to\nmetropolitan areas and used block size measures rather\nthan connectivity indices to represent street accessibility.\nAlternatively, our buffer-defined areas may influence\nintersection and street segment counts, particularly in\nrural areas with few streets, altering the meaning of the\nconnectivity indices.\nDimensionality of environmental constructs\nFactor solutions distinguished dimensions of similar con-\nstructs, which in turn were differentially related to\nMVPA. Factor analysis identified two types of facilities\nwhich were related to MVPA in different ways.

Likewise, two SES environment factors emerged,\none reflecting economic and education characteristics,\nthe other reflecting social characteristics. These factors\nwere correlated but appear to be differentially related to\nthe built environment and MVPA.\nImportance of incorporating many aspects of the\nenvironment when estimating neighborhood effects on\nphysical activity\nFactors allowed a wide range of environmental measures\nto be simultaneously incorporated into the analysis,\nrevealing confounding by SES and built environment\ncharacteristics:\nConfounding by SES environment characteristics\nIn particular, built and SES factors were strongly associ-\nated, and adjustment for SES environment factor(s)\nresulted in changes to several built environment-MVPA\nassociations. Further, the 2-dimensional SES environ-\nment construct was a stronger confounder of associations\nbetween MVPA and intensity (public facilities) and, to a\nlesser extent, street connectivity, compared to the 1-\ndimensional construct. Such confounding could reflect\nplacement of public facilities in areas of greatest need.\nLikewise, high street connectedness is common in poor\ninner-city areas where physical activity may be influenced\nby social contexts particularly relevant to females such as\ncrime [38], which is better captured by the 2-dimensional\nSES environment construct.\nThese results support our conceptualization of the SES\nenvironment as a confounder of the built environment-\nMVPA association. However, relationships between the\nbuilt and SES environments may be bidirectional and\ndynamic. For example, crime may mediate, rather than\nconfound, relationships between built and SES environ-\nment measures and physical activity. Furthermore, the\nsocial and economic resources of a community may influ-\nence where built environment features are situated, social\nnorms with regard to health behavior [39], and perceived\nand objective safety; ultimately, the SES environment\nmeasures may be surrogates for a multitude of influences\non MVPA. While future research should investigate and\naccount for these complexities, examination of the SES\nand built environments as independent influences on\nMVPA is valuable for documenting SES disparities and\ninvestigating the potential benefits of modifying the built\nenvironment while accounting for inter-correlation with\nthe less modifiable SES environment.\nConfounding by built environment characteristics\nWhile built environment characteristics met our objec-\ntive definition of confounding, absolute changes to esti-\nmates were small and did not change study conclusions\nregarding the relationship between the built environment\nand MVPA. One possible explanation for weak confound-\ning is that our built environment factors were multidi-\nmensional and account for correlations between built\nenvironment measures; individual built environment\nmeasures may confound other measures loading onto the\nsame factor. However, strong correlations preclude for-\nmal testing of this hypothesis. Additionally, the degree of\nconfounding by built and SES environment characteris-\ntics in our study may have been minimized by weak built\nenvironment-MVPA relationships.\nImplications\nThese findings suggest that failure to adjust for both eco-\nnomic and social aspects of the SES environment may\nlead to biased estimates of some built environment-\nMVPA associations. Fortunately, census variables are\nreadily available. In contrast, relatively weak confounding\nby other built environment characteristics is encouraging\nfor studies without the wide range of measures used in\nthis study. However, in several cases, simultaneously\nadjusting for multiple built environment measures mag-\nnified the associations. Furthermore, in studies showing\nstronger associations or examining one-dimensional built\nenvironment measures, omission of additional built envi-\nronment characteristics may lead to more substantial\nunderestimation of effects. Finally, even small degrees of\nconfounding may influence conclusions drawn from gen-\nerally weak associations in the extant literature.\nForging ahead with replicable measures into longitudinal\nsettings and external populations\nMultidimensional built and SES environment constructs\nidentified from factor analysis allowed us to simultane-\nously examine a large set of measures with respect to\nMVPA. In a next step, we used the knowledge gained\nfrom factor analysis to create simplified measures (Tables\n8 &9) that incorporate inter-relationships, yet are more\neasily replicable in future studies. We emphasize that our\nsimplified measures represent the set of variables identi-\nfied using factor analysis and should be interpreted as\nsuch. In fact, replication of regression results with single\nindicators demonstrates that these measures, which are\noften analyzed on their own, may act as proxies for\nunderlying environmental constructs.\nTwo branches of investigation are needed to better\nunderstand the potential causal effects of these measures.\nFirst, these simplified measures can be used in longitudi-\nnal analyses and examination in external populations. As\nopposed to other strategies such as scale measures, they\nare readily understandable and examined in prior\nresearch, and selection of single indicators reduces the\nnumber of measures needed to replicate findings in other\nstudies.\nBoone-Heinonen et al.

International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2010, 7:45\nSecond, investigation of mechanisms leading to the\nobserved associations will help to distinguish between\nproxies and policy-relevant determinants of physical\nactivity. For example, crime replicated associations\nbetween the disadvantageous social environment factor\nand MVPA, but how crime might influence physical\nactivity, or if yet another characteristic is the causal agent,\nis unknown. Research incorporating psychological mea-\nsures (e.g., self-efficacy and perceived barriers) or\ndetailed audit-based environment data (e.g., aesthetics\nand quality of facilities) can improve understanding of\nbehavioral mechanisms. Such research may reveal addi-\ntional layers, possibly showing our multidimensional\nenvironment constructs as proxies for more qualitative\ninter-personal or cultural aspects of the environment.\nDetermining whether patterning of environmental\nmeasures is similar in other populations is an important\nnext step. If patterning in other age groups differs sub-\nstantially from our nationally representative sample of\nadolescents, our simple measures may have limited ability\nto represent the constructs identified in this study and\nthus must be tested before applying them in other popu-\nlations.\nWe found differences in built environment-MVPA\nassociations by sex, which is consistent with previous\nstudies examining walkability and physical activity\nbe a negative correlate of MVPA for males but not\nfemales, possibly because males may be more likely to be\nactive outdoors [42] with less regard to safety or other\nconcerns. Intensity (pay facilities) was associated with\nlower MVPA in females but not males. On the other\nhand, count of public facilities corrected for population\nwas associated with higher MVPA in females but not\nmales, perhaps also due to safety concerns addressed by\naccess to facilities. Such differences by sex may shift as\nadolescents age into adulthood, when overall physical\nactivity levels are lower [19], or decrease among adoles-\ncents over time as physical activity promotion efforts in\nrecent decades may have addressed barriers such as safety\nor provided additional sex-neutral activity opportunities.\nFurther investigation of the dose-response relationship\nbetween the built environment and MVPA is another\nopportunity for future research. We found non-linear\nassociations between four aspects of the built environ-\nment and MVPA. The strongest associations were gener-\nally observed for the largest quartile, which, due to data\nskewness, contained very large factor score or measure\nvalues. Using quartile measures allowed comparability\nbetween associations with factors versus single indica-\ntors, but closer examination of dose-response and shape\nof the relationship is warranted. Shifts in the shape of the\ndose-response relationships - sometimes alternating\nbetween monotonic and U-shaped - with additional cova-\nriates add complexity and should be further examined.\nLimitations and Strengths\nLimitations include cross-sectional study design, which\ndoes not imply causality. Yet, we identified replicable\nmeasures that set the stage for longitudinal analyses,\nwhich can establish temporality and better address bias\ndue to residential self-selection [43,44]. Second, there was\nsome temporal mismatch between individual-level inter-\nproviding historical data approximately contemporane-\nous with multiple survey waves. Our county-level crime\nmeasure was crude, yet it provided an objective measure\nof safety available across the US that was strongly associ-\nated with MVPA. Third, while we analyzed an extensive\nnumber of environmental variables, we did not consider\nquality of facilities, perceived environment measures, or\nother potential psychological mediators.\nFourth, we examined overall leisure time MVPA fre-\nquency, which does not distinguish between possible\nbehavior-specific effects [45] or incorporate physical\nactivity duration or intensity. Our built and SES environ-\nment measures may show stronger relationships with\nspecific types of physical activity. For example, stronger\nrelationships may be present between alpha street con-\nnectivity and active transportation behaviors, or between\npay or public facilities and team sports or exercise.\nClearly, future research should examine behavior-specific\nassociations while accounting for complex patterning of\nthe environment.\nFinally, we did not address urbanicity, which may be an\nimportant moderator [46] of built environment-MVPA\nrelationships. However, our study informs a growing\nbody of work using national datasets by addressing envi-\nronment patterning and confounding in broad range of\nneighborhood environments as well as examining mea-\nsures applicable longitudinally during periods in which\nindividuals may move in or out of urban areas. Addition-\nally, the wide range of existing urbanicity measures are\ngenerally based on environment characteristics of inter-\nest (e.g., population density), thereby obscuring practical\napplications such as modification of the built environ-\nment in suburban areas to more closely resemble urban\nareas. Nevertheless, analogous analysis stratified by some\nmeasure of urbanicity is an important next step.\nAdditional strengths include examination of a wide\nrange of environment measures in a nationally represen-\ntative sample of adolescents, an understudied population.\nWe explicitly examined and compared built and SES envi-\nronment characteristics, which were strongly related.\nFinally, we used pattern analysis methods to not only\nBoone-Heinonen et al.
