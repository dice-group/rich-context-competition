Although the number of cases is small\nand exposure may be misclassified, the prospective na-\nture of the study design strengthens the results of the\nKey words: multiple myeloma (etiology),antigens, aller-\ngens, bacterial infections, inflammation, autoimmune\ndiseases, prospective studies.\nMultiple myeloma is a malignant neoplasm of plasma\ncells. The monoclonal origin of malignant plasma cells\nis accepted on the basis of the homogeneity of the se-\ncreted immunoglobulin.w There is increasing evidence\nthat the initial malignant transformation occurs in a cell\nthat is a precursor to both B-lymphocytes and T-lym-\nphocytes. Multiple myeloma develops in a multistep\nprocess starting with a monoclonalgammopathy of un-\ndetermined significance, a benign proliferation of\nmonoclonal cells. In some patients, monoclonal gam-\nmopathy of undetermined significance progresses to\nsymptomatic multiple myeloma.' Etiologicfactors gov-\nerning the initiation and subsequent progression to\nclinically apparent myeloma remain unknown.\nA causal relationship between antigenicconditions\nand multiple myeloma was originally suggested on the\nbasis of case reports that identified concurrent disease\nin myeloma case^.^-^ Although controlled studies have\nidentified associations with individual conditions that\ncause chronic or recurrent stimulation of the immune\nsystem, they have failed to support a unified mecha-\nnism.\nSeveralcase-control studies of the antigenicstimu-\nlation hypothesis of multiple myeloma have relied on\nhospital-based controlgroups. Thesecontrolgroupsare\nsusceptible to selection factors that may mask a true\nassociation of myeloma with other medical conditions.\nIn the current study, we used the First National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANESI) cohort\nto examine prospectively the hypothesis that chronicor\n   /Bourguet and L o p e 2149\nrecurrent conditions that stimulate the immune system\nare risk factors for multiple myeloma.6\nMethods\nThe data for the study comefrom the NHANESIEpide-\nmiologicFollow-upStudy, which was conducted by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics. The NHANES I\ncohort consists of a probability sample of the civilian\nnoninstitutionalized U.S. p~pulation.~,'\nThe NHANES I baseline questionnaire was com-\nwith each study member. Two waves of follow-up data\nand the second in 1986.At both follow-up waves, vital\nstatus was determined and death certificates were ob-\ntained for deceased cohort members. Living cohort\nmembers or proxies were reinterviewed.\n25 to 74 years at the time of the NHANES I, were con-\ntacted. Cohort members or a proxies responded to a\nmembers age 55 years or older at the initial interview\ncontacted. A half-hour telephone interview was con-\nducted with each member.'\nAt the time of the follow-up interview, each cohort\nmember or proxy was asked to list all episodesof hospi-\ntalization. Respondents authorized release of medical\nrecords to the National Center for Health Statisticsfor\nthe purposes of the Details of the hospitaliza-\ntion, including the discharge summary, were requested\nfrom each hospital.\nFor the current study, the hospitalization data and\nthe death certificate data were used to identify the\nmembers with multiple myeloma. All diagnoses listed\nfor each hospitalization and all cause-of-death codes\nwere searched for International Classification of Dis-\neases code 203 (MM).Date of hospitalization for multi-\nple myeloma was used as the best available surrogate\nfor date of diagnosis. If date of hospitalization was not\navailable, date of death was used.\nstandardized medical history covering various topics.\nThe health-condition list was used to construct four a\npriori categories of conditions that result in chronic or\nrecurrent stimulation of the immune system:(1)allergic\nconditions-asthma, hives, hay fever, food allergies,\nand other allergies;(2) autoimmune conditions-arthri-\ntis, rheumatic fever, diabetes, thyroid disease and/or\nmedication, and pernicious anemia; (3) chronic bacte-\nrial conditions-tuberculosis, chronicbronchitis or em-\nphysema, chronic cough, and ulcers; and (4)inflamma-\ntory conditions -gout, gallstones, pleurisy, and recur-\nrent or chronic enteritis. The interview ascertained the\npresence of each disease condition at time of interview,\na history of a condition no longer present, and the time\nsince the person first had the condition. The Appendix\nshows the questionnaire items that were used to con-\nstruct each category.\nTo control for confounding factorsby age and year\nof birth and to reduce computer processing time, we\nrestricted the data analyses to cohort members who\nwere born in the same study years as the persons with\nmultiple myeloma. Crude incidence rate ratios (RR) as-\nsociatedwith a history of allergic,autoimmune, chronic\nbacterial, or inflammatory conditions were calculated.\nIncidence RR and 95% confidence intervals adjusted\nfor potential confounders were estimated using a pro-\nportional hazards model by means of the PHGLM pro-\ncedure in the SAS (Cary, NC) statistical software.\",\"\nFor the data analysis, the risk factors were struc-\ntured to indicate a disease category present at any time\nbefore or at the time of interview, present at the time of\nthe interview,and total timesinceinitiation of the medi-\ncal conditions in the category. Although all persons\nwith myeloma had denied any malignant tumor at the\nbaseline interview, the possibility of prevalent my-\neloma at the time of interview exists. Consequently, the\ndata were reanalyzed after restricting the cases to those\npersons who had 5 or more years of follow-up after the\nbaseline interview.\nAfter two waves of follow-up, 94% of the cohort\nhad been traced and their vital status was known.\nNinety-seven percent of the death certificateswere ob-\ntained for the 2,657 cohort members who had died.\nwere reinterviewed.'\nThe completeness of the hospitalization data can\nonly be estimated, because cohort members may have\nreported hospitalizations that did not fall within the\nno hospital record was obtained for 22% of persons\nwho reported at least one hospitalization.**'*\nthe hospital records could not be obtained for 28% of\nthe reported hospitalization episodes.'\nResults\nEighteen cases of multiple myeloma were found in the\nNHANES I cohort. Nine cases were identified by both\nhospital and death records, eight cases by hospital re-\ncords only, and one case by death certificateonly.\nTable 1.

One person was diagnosed with myeloma within\n1 year of the interview. Because undiagnosed disease\nmay have been present at the interview, these four\ncases were excluded and the analyses were repeated.\nThe associationof inflammatoryconditionswith multi-\nple myeloma risk was strengthened (one condition, RR\nwith an inflammatory condition initiated 10 or more\nyears before the interview.Theassociationwith allergic\nconditions was also strengthened, although it was not\nstatistically significant (one condition, RR = 2.2; two\nconditions, RR = 4.9; P = 0.39).In this analysis,neither\nbacterial nor autoimmune conditionsshowed an associ-\nation with myeloma.\nDiscussion\nPreviousstudiesof the antigenicstimulationhypothesis\nfor the etiology of multiple myeloma are difficult to\ninterpret. Prospective data have been reported from the\nrheumatoid arthritis cohort of Isomaki et al.13and from\nthe Adventist Health Study.14 Koepsell et al.\" and\nDoody et a1.16reported population-based case-control\ndata. Other reports come from hospital case-control\nstudies.\n''-\"\nProspective studies have found an association of\nmultiple myeloma with specific medical conditions.\nIsomaki et al. found twice the expected incidence of\nmultiple myeloma in a rheumatoid arthritis cohort.13\nThe relative risk of myeloma after a history of any al-\nlergyin the Adventist Health cohort was l.7.However,\nthis was not a statistically significant in~rease.'~\nMcWhorter examined the incidence of combined\nlymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma in a subset of the\nsame NHANES I cohort used in the current study. He\nfound an increased incidence of these neoplasms\namong patients who had a history of allergy.23\nMcWhorter's data involves follow-up up to 1984 only\nand is limited to an examination of allergies as a risk\nfactor. The risk of myeloma is not reported separately,\npresumably because only a small number of cases had\noccurred at the first wave of follow-up.\nTwo population-based case-control studies pro-\nvide little support to an etiologic role of chronic anti-\ngenic stimulation. Koepsell et al., using cases from the\nSurveillance,Epidemiology,and End Results Reporting\nsystem and population-representative controls, found\nlittle support for the hypothesi~.'~\nOf many potential\nrisk factors, associations with fever blisters, urinary\ntract infections, and rheumatic fever were found.\nDoody et al. concluded that their data from a Kaiser\nPermanente cohort did not support a role for chronic\nantigenic stimulation in the etiology of hematopoietic\nmalignancies. They did, however, find an elevated risk\nof myeloma with a history of eczema or musculoskele-\ntal condition.'6\nBoffetta et al. reported a case-control study nested\nwithin the American Cancer Society prospective co-\nhort. They found an associationof myeloma only with\ndiabetes among eight conditions examined. Although\nthese exposuredata were collectedbefore diseasedevel-\nopment, the cohort consisted of volunteers who may\nhave been self-selectedinto the study accordingto per-\nceived health statusz4\nHospital-basedcase-control studieshave givenlim-\nited support to the antigenic stimulation hypothe-\nsis.17-22 However,becauseof the selectionphenomenon\nknown as Berkson bias,\" hospital-based case-control\nstudies are unsuitable for assessingan association with\npreexistingmedical conditions. If the presence of multi-\nple clinicalconditionsincreasesthe probabilityof hospi-\ntal admission, the hospital-based control group will\nhave a higher prevalence of concurrent disease condi-\ntions than the background population. As a result of\nthis selectionprocess, a true association of multiple my-\neloma with other conditionsmay be masked in a hospi-\ntal-based case-control study.\nIn the current analysis of data from the NHANES I\ncohort, we found evidence of increased risk of multiple\nmyeloma among persons who reported at baseline in-\nterview that they had suffered from autoimmune or\ninflammatory conditions. The primary strength of the\ndata results from their prospective nature. Data col-\nlected for a prospective cohort avoid the problems of\nselectionbias associated with hospital-based case-con-\ntrol studies. Theyalso avoid biased recall by the patient\nand interviewer bias, which can occur when a patient\nwith a known condition is interviewed.\nThese findings are not conclusive. The results are\nbased on only 18multiple myeloma cases. Because the\nactual date of diagnosis was unavailable, the date of\nhospitalization or, for one case, date of death was sub-\nstituted. The risk factorcategories had to be constructed\nfrom the data that had been collected at the baseline\ninterview. Therefore, the disease conditions that were\nincluded in the analysis are not a definitive list of dis-\neases in each category.\nBecause the baseline data were collected for an-\nother purpose, a single questionnaire item could com-\nbine conditions with differing etiologies. For example,\nalthough only rheumatoid arthritis is thought to have\nan autoimmune component, the NHANES I item\nwould include rheumatoid and osteoarthritis. The\nquestionnaire item \"arthritis\" was included in the au-\ntoimmune categoryon the assumption that osteoarthri-\ntis would be randomly distributed between cases and\ncontrolsand that, if an associationwas seen, it would be\ndue to rheumatoid arthritis. Chronic or recurrent enter-\nitis was thought to represent Crohn disease. Thyroid\ndisease may represent Graves disease or other autoim-\nmune thyroiditis. Both persons with multiple myeloma\nwho reported thyroid disease also reported takingregu-\nlar thyroid medication. Assumptions of this nature,\nwhich may result in misclassification of exposure, in-\ntroduce a conservativebias by weakening the ability of\nthe study to detect true associations.\nTen percent of patients with multiple myeloma\nmay exhibit primary amyloidosis, which can manifest\nas amyloid induced arthritis or carpal tunnel syn-\nWhen we limited the data analysis to persons\nwho developed disease 5 or more years after the base-\nline interview, the associationwith autoimmune condi-\ntions disappeared. This suggests that the elevated rela-\ntive risk found for autoimmune conditions present at\nthe interview may be a spurious result of early disease\nsymptoms.\nIncreasedmultiplemyelomarisk was associatedini-\ntially with higher educational levels.27\nThese earlyfind-\nings may have been an artifact of under-diagnosed dis-\nease in less-educated person^.^^,^^ In the current study,\npersons with less than a high schooleducationhad a 6.6\ntimes increased risk of multiple myeloma compared\nwith persons with at least a high school education.\nKoepsell et al. and Boffetta et al. also reported\nan increased risk of myeloma at lower educational\nlevel^.'^,^^\nThe biologic mechanism linking lower educational\nstatus with increased myeloma risk remains unclear.\nMyeloma has been associatedwith several occupational\nand chemical exposure^.^'^^^^^^^^^ These may be more\ncommon among persons with less education and may\nexplain part of this association.\nBoice et al. have recentlyreported anincreasingrisk\nof multiple myeloma associated with increasing num-\nbers of diagnostic radiograph^.^' Persons at the highest\nexposure level (a mean of 35 diagnostic radiographs)\nhad relative risks of approximately four for multiple\nmyeloma. Radiographs are used in the differential\ndiagnosis of virtually all inflammatory conditions and\nmany autoimmune conditions. Confounding by diag-\n   /Bourguet and L o p e 2153\nnostic radiographs could explain part of the association\nwith immune-stimulatingconditionsseenin the current\nstudy, and the reverse might also be true. Additional\nstudiesshould be designed to delineate the possible in-\ndependent contributions of antigenic conditions and\ndiagnostic radiographs to the etiology of multiple my-\neloma.\nClearly, allhuman beings are exposedto many an-\ntigensdaily.Someof the medical conditionsincluded in\nthe current study are quite common. Persons who de-\nvelop multiple myeloma may be characterized by a\nunique response to common exposures. The data of\nLeech and colleague^,^^ who reported an excess of hu-\nman leukocyteantigen-Cw5 amongblack patients with\nmyeloma, and the numerous reports of family aggrega-\ntion of multiplemyeloma3'suggest that genetics play a\nrole in increased risk. However, it will be a challengeto\ndetermine if genetic characteristics of the individual,\nenvironmentalexposures, or behavioral factorsinteract\nwith relatively common antigenic stimulation to place\nthe individual at risk.\nThe data reported here, drawn from a nationally\nrepresentative prospective study, show an association\nof inflammatoryconditionswith multiplemyeloma. In-\nflammatory conditions show a dose-response relation-\nship with number of conditions and time since initial\ninflammatory condition. These findings give limited\nsupport to the role of chronic stimulation of the im-\nmune system in the etiology of multiple myeloma. Be-\ncause only a smallnumber of myeloma caseswere pres-\nent in the cohort, the data lackthe power to detectweak\nassociations. Consequently, although there were no\nconsistent associations of allergic, autoimmune, or\nchronicbacterial conditionswith multiplemyeloma, no\nconclusionsabout those risk factorscanbe drawn based\non these data.\nReferences\n1.
