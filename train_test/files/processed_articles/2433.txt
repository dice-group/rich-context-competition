The purpose of this work was to examine long-term tra-\njectories of self-reporting bias in a national sample of American youth. With 3 waves of data from the National Lon-\ngitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (1996\u00ad2008), we used growth curve models to examine self-reporting bias in\ntrajectories of weight gain across adolescence and early adulthood (ages 13\u00ad32 years). We investigated whether\nself-reporting bias is constant over time, or whether adolescents become more accurate in reporting their weight as\nthey move into young adulthood, and we examined differences in self-reporting bias by sex, race/ethnicity, and\nattained education. Adolescent girls underreported their weight by 0.86 kg on average, and this rate of underreport-\ning increased over early adulthood. In contrast, we found no evidence that boys underreported their weight either in\nadolescence or over the early adult years. For young men, self-reports of weight were unbiased estimates of mea-\nsured weight among all racial/ethnic and educational subpopulations over adolescence and early adulthood.\nadolescence; bias; measurement; self-report; trajectories; weight; youth\nAbbreviation: Add Health, National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.\nAlthough some population-based surveys use direct an-\nthropomorphic measurements to track trends in obesity (1),\nmany studies rely on self-reported measures of weight and\nheight (2). Objective measurement of weight and height can\nbe prohibitively expensive in large population-based surveys,\nand even impossible for studies that rely on telephone or mail\nsurveys. Self-reported data are easy and relatively inexpen-\nsive to collect (3), but the validity of self-reports has been\nquestioned. Although biases in self-reported height are gen-\nerally small (4\u00ad7), differences between self-reported and\nmeasured weight are more marked. A number of studies have\ninvestigated bias in self-reported weight in adult populations\nand have generally found self-reports to be similar to mea-\nself-reports of weight are consistently lower than measured\nweight and also vary by individual characteristics, with\nwomen and younger adults tending to underreport their\nweight more than men and older adults (8, 9, 12).\nThere is comparatively less research examining self-\nreported weight in adolescence and young adulthood--\ncritical periods of the life course for research on obesity\n(13). Although some studies suggest that adolescents' reports\nof weight are valid and reliable (14\u00ad16), others have raised\nconcerns (17\u00ad21). However, most of this research has been\nlimited to select, geographically defined samples. The Na-\ntional Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health)\nprovides a unique opportunity to examine reporting bias dur-\ning youth, because it includes measures of both self-reported\nand measured weight in a nationally representative sample of\nAmerican adolescents followed repeatedly into their young-\net al.

They found that\nboth males and females slightly underreported their weight\nat both time points, but because underreporting was fairly\nconsistent, a measure of weight change was not biased by\nself-report.

Because measured weight data are only available\nbeginning in wave 2, we restricted our analyses to 19,238 re-\nspondents who participated in any wave after wave 1. Thus,\nrespondents contributed anywhere from 1 to 3 observations\nto the analyses.

Following the computer-assisted interview,\nrespondents were asked to remove their shoes and any\nitems from their pockets, and weight was measured to the\nnearest 0.1 kg using a Health O Meter 844KL high-capacity\ndigital scale (Jarden Corp., Rye, New York) (26). Thus, we\nhave 2 measurements of weight at each wave in which a re-\nspondent was interviewed, generating up to 6 observations\nper person across all 3 waves. (Data were excluded for re-\nspondents who were pregnant at the time of interview.) A\ndummy variable was used to distinguish between measured\nand self-reported weight in the data, and in the analysis, it\ncaptures the difference between the 2 (e.g., underreporting)\nover time.\nTime-invariant covariates included sex and race/ethnicity\n(captured using 4 dummy variables contrasting non-Hispanic\nblack, Hispanic, Asian, and other race/ethnicity (e.g., Native\nAmerican) with white respondents).

Girls weighed 58 kg on av-\nerage at age 13 years, and they gained weight at an average\nrate of 1.2 kg per year to age 32 years. There was significant\nvariation in weight between girls at age 13 years and signifi-\ncant variation in the rate of weight gain over time (variance\ncomponents). Model B indicates a significant quadratic term,\nwhere weight increased rapidly early in adolescence and then\nattenuated with age. Adolescent girls underreported their\nweight by 0.86 kg on average at age 13 years (model C),\nand this rate of underreporting increased with age.\nTable 2.

In adolescence, young women who do not\neventually graduate from college weigh significantly more\nthan those who do and exhibit a more rapid rate of weight\ngain over early adulthood (model E). For example, compared\nwith women with a college degree, women with a high school\neducation gained 0.78 kg more per year of age, although this\nwas attenuated at later ages as a function of the age2 term ( =\n-0.02). There was also evidence of differential underreporting\nof weight by attained education; young women with onlysome\ncollege education underreported their weight by 0.29 kg more\nthan college graduates (models D and E).\nTrajectories of weight gain among young men\nTable 2 presents a similar set of models for young men. In\nearly adolescence, boys weighed 67.7 kg on average, which\nwas 9.7 kg more than girls at the same age. Boys also gained\nweight more rapidly than girls, gaining 1.5 kg per year of age\n(model A). Similar to the results for females, there was evi-\ndence of a quadratic form to the model, with more rapid\nweight gain early in adolescence that tapered off with increas-\ning age (model B).

Although some con-\nsider self-reports to be valid and reliable (12, 15, 22), others\nurge caution on the basis of findings that suggest a consistent\nunderreporting of weight, especially among adolescent girls\n(7). Although most of the existing research has used cross-\nsectional data (or data from 2 time points (23)), this study\nexamined trajectories of self-reporting bias in weight over\nadolescence and young adulthood using multiple, repeated\nobservations from a nationally representative sample over a\nConsistent with previous research (7), we found notable\ndifferences in self-reporting bias by sex. Adolescent girls un-\nderreported their weight, and underreporting increased over\nearly adulthood. The rate of underreporting was the same\nfor African American, white, and Hispanic young women,\nbut Asian women showed no evidence of self-reporting bias.\nIn contrast, we found no evidence that boys underreported\ntheir weight either in adolescence or over the early adult\nyears. Nor did we find any evidence of self-report bias among\nyoung men by racial/ethnic group or attained education.\nMany researchers urge caution when interpreting popula-\ntion trends in obesity and overweight on the basis of self-\nreported weight data (4, 16, 20) and even apply a correction\nfactor to empirically adjust for self-report bias (33\u00ad35). Our\nfindings suggest that adolescent boys are accurate in reporting\ntheir weight and remain consistently accurate throughout the\ntransition to young adulthood. Any correction for self-report\nshould, therefore, be reserved for young women. However,\nsuch a correction factor should not be applied to young\nAsian women, who were consistently accurate in reporting\ntheir weight over time. Underreporting of weight in this\nstudy may have been minimized because respondents were\ninterviewed in person. This study was also unable to explore\nthe role of other factors, such as social norms, which have\nbeen shown to affect misreporting of weight (36) but are\nnot available in the Add Health data.\n"
