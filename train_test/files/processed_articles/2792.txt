We\nevaluated associations between e-cigarette use and progression to established smoking\namong adolescents who had already tried cigarettes.\nMETHODS: Among participants (age 12\u00ad17 years) in the nationally representative Population\nAssessment of Tobacco and Health survey who had smoked a cigarette (1 puff) but not\na function of baseline e-cigarette use: (1) having smoked 100 cigarettes (established\nsmoking), (2) smoking during the past 30 days, and (3) both having smoked 100 cigarettes\nand past 30-day smoking (current established smoking). Survey-weighted multivariable\nlogistic regression models were fitted to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence\nintervals (CIs) adjusted for smoking risk factors.\nRESULTS: Versus e-cigarette never use, having ever used e-cigarettes was positively\nassociated with progression to established cigarette smoking (19.3% vs 9.7%), past 30-day\nmodels, e-cigarette ever use positively predicted current established smoking (OR: 1.80;\nCONCLUSIONS: Among adolescent cigarette experimenters, using e-cigarettes was positively\nand independently associated with progression to current established smoking, suggesting\nthat e-cigarettes do not divert from, and may encourage, cigarette smoking in this\npopulation.\nabstract\nNIH\naCenter for Tobacco Control Research and Education, dPhilip R.

In cross-sectional studies,\ne-cigarette use is associated with established youth\nsmoking.\nWhat This Study Adds: Among youth who already\nexperimented with cigarettes but were not yet established\nsmokers, having used e-cigarettes was prospectively\nassociated with onset of current established cigarette\nsmoking. For these youth, e-cigarettes appear to\nencourage progression to established smoking.\nTo cite: Chaffee BW, Watkins SL, Glantz SA. Electronic\nCigarette Use and Progression From Experimentation to\nElectronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes)\nare increasingly popular among\nmiddle and high school students used\ne-cigarettes than any other tobacco\nproduct, including conventional\ncigarettes.1 All currently available\nlongitudinal studies have revealed\nthat among never-smoking\nadolescents and young adults,\ne-cigarette use is associated with\nsubsequent cigarette smoking.2\n\u00ad\nThis association was shown in\nstudies taking place in California,\nHawaii,\n2 and the Mid-Atlantic\nregion,\n7 as well as in nationally\nrepresentative US samples,\n\nand the United Kingdom.5 Seven of\nthese studies were summarized in a\nrecent meta-analysis, revealing more\nthan a threefold increase in the risk\nof cigarette smoking initiation when\ncomparing youth e-cigarette ever\nusers to never users.9 Although this\nassociation between e-cigarettes\nand smoking initiation has been\nconsistent across the literature\nand could be explained by using a\nproposed \"catalyst\" model,\nhave argued that the relationship\npartly reflects a shared propensity\nfor experimentation with different\nnicotine-containing products.11\nMany individuals at low risk of\nsmoking initiation may be included\nin studies of baseline cigarette\nnever-users. In contrast, youth\nwho have already begun cigarette\nexperimentation represent a\npopulation at high risk of progression\nto greater levels of cigarette use\nlater in adolescence and into\nadulthood. Although smoking even 1\ncigarette is concerning, becoming an\nestablished smoker in adolescence\nis of substantial clinical and public\nhealth concern and is strongly\nassociated with continuing to smoke\nregularly.12 Therefore, in the present\ninvestigation we consider high-risk\nyouth, as evident by having already\ntried smoking (ever smoked 1 puff)\nbut not yet smoked 100 cigarettes,\nand evaluate whether e-cigarette\nuse in this population predicts\nprogression from experimentation to\nestablished cigarette smoking 1 year\nlater.\nIn a previous cross-sectional analysis\nTobacco Surveys (NYTSs), among\nyouth who had ever smoked a\ncigarette, ever use of e-cigarettes was\nassociated with being an established\ncigarettes), including after adjusting\nfor socio-demographic variables.13\nHowever, the cross-sectional design\nof that analysis precluded causal\nconclusions because of uncertain\ntemporal sequencing between\ne-cigarette use and established\nsmoking.\nIn the current study, we used\nthe nationally representative\nPopulation Assessment of Tobacco\nand Health (PATH) Study14 Waves\nto examine these same relationships\nprospectively. We hypothesized that\namong PATH youth participants\nwho had already tried cigarette\nsmoking but not yet smoked a total\nof 100 cigarettes, use of e-cigarettes\nwould be positively associated with\nbecoming an established cigarette\nsmoker within 1 year.\nMethods\nResearchers from the PATH Study\nselected participants using a 4-stage\nstratified probability design with\noversampling for tobacco users,\nAfrican Americans, and young adults\nsample consisted of adolescents (up\nto 2 per household) whose parents\nwere selected for the PATH adult\nsample.14 Researchers from the\nretention (unweighted) at Wave 2\nIn-home in-person computer-\nassisted interviews were conducted\nin administering the PATH\nquestionnaire. In separate sections,\nparticipants were asked about their\ntobacco use (eg, ever use, number\nof lifetime uses, and number of days\nused in the past 30 days) for 8 types\nof tobacco and nicotine-containing\nproducts, including cigarettes and\ne-cigarettes. Tobacco use questions\nwere repeated during the Wave 2\ninterview, including for individuals\nwho reached age 18 before follow-up\nand were therefore administered the\nWave 2 adult questionnaire.\nIn the present analysis, we included\nyouth who had smoked 1 cigarette\npuff but had not yet smoked 100\ncigarettes at baseline (smoking\nexperimenters), with known smoking\nexamined 3 outcomes at follow-up as\na function of baseline e-cigarette use:\n(established smoking), (2) smoking\nduring the past 30 days, and (3)\nboth having smoked 100 cigarettes\nand past 30-day smoking (current\nestablished smoking). We categorized\ne-cigarette use in 2 ways: (1) ever\nuse or never use, and (2) never use,\nnonpast 30-day use (former use), or\nLogistic regression models (Stata\n14; StataCorp, College Station, TX)\nwere used to adjust for hypothesized\nconfounding variables in 3 stages.\nFirst, 6 separate unadjusted models\nwere fitted to cover each combination\nof independent variable (Wave 1\ne-cigarette never or ever use and\ne-cigarette never or former or past\n30-day use) and dependent variable\n(Wave 2 established smoking,\ncurrent smoking, and current\nestablished smoking). In the second\nstage, we added sex, age (in years),\nand race and/or ethnicity (Hispanic\nand/or Latino, non-Hispanic white,\nnon-Hispanic African American,\nother) as covariables in all models,\nmatching the confounders used in\na previous cross-sectional analysis\nof NYTS data.13 In the third stage,\nparent education (1 parent with a\nChaffee et al\nbachelor degree or greater), urban\nresidence (based on sampling units),\nhousehold tobacco use (lives with\n1 tobacco user), alcohol ever use,\ntobacco advertisement receptivity15\n(can recall brand of favorite\nadvertisement), sensation-seeking\nscore (scale from 3 to 15), cigarette\nwarning label exposure (Likert-\ntype scale), interview time of year\n(summer versus all other months),\nand ever use of any other tobacco\nproduct (ie, cigars, pipes, hookah,\nbidis, kreteks, snus, dissolvable\ntobacco, and conventional moist\nsnuff or chewing smokeless tobacco)\nwere also included in additional\nadjusted models. A sensation-\nseeking score was a composite of 3\nLikert-type items (liking frightening\nthings, willingness to break rules,\nand preference for exciting and\nunpredictable friends) and has\nbeen shown to correlate with youth\ntobacco use.16 Interview time of year\nwas included because, for youth,\nthe scholastic calendar may play a\nrole both in opportunity and social\npressure to experiment with tobacco\nproducts.\nAll models were weighted for\nsampling design and nonresponse by\nusing balanced repeated replication\nto be representative of the Wave\n1 target population.17 Multiple\nimputation was performed for\nmissing observations (0.7% of data),\nwith variance estimates adjusted\naccordingly.\nAn institutional review board at\nthe University of California, San\nFrancisco reviewed and designated\nthe study protocol exempt for this\nanalysis of deidentified survey\ndata.

Fully adjusted associations\nwith e-cigarette ever use were\nstatistically significant for 1\ndefinition of established smoking\n(current established smoking; P =\n.035) but fell just short of the a priori\nthreshold for statistical significance\nfor established smoking (P = .055)\nThe ORs in the present longitudinal\nanalysis were in the same direction\nbut smaller in magnitude than in the\nprevious cross-sectional analysis\nof NYTS data13 in which new trials\nof e-cigarettes among previously\nestablished smokers could have been\ncaptured.\nRegardless of how Wave 1 e-cigarette\nand Wave 2 smoking variables were\nspecified, positive associations\npersisted after statistical adjustment\nfor sex, age, and race and/or\nethnicity. Adding the full set of\nconfounding variables to models,\nsuch as household tobacco use,\nwarning label exposure, and baseline\nuse of other tobacco products,\nreduced the strength of some of the\nobserved associations to below the\nthreshold for statistical significance.\nHowever, all associations remained\npositive in direction and similar\nin magnitude across different\ndefinitions of e-cigarette exposure\nand the smoking outcome.\nSuggested in these results is that\ne-cigarette use is more likely to\nencourage youth smoking than to\ndivert youth from smoking when\nconsidering individuals who have\nalready experimented with cigarette\nuse. Unlike adults, particularly\ncigarette smokers, who commonly\nreport a desire to quit smoking as a\nmain motivator for e-cigarette use,\nyouth are more likely to cite curiosity\nas a reason to try e-cigarettes.19\nE-cigarette use was not associated\nwith cigarette quit attempts or with\nquit contemplation among US middle\nand high school students in any NYTS\nIn existing studies of youth who had\nnever smoked a cigarette at baseline,\nthose who tried e-cigarettes were\nmore likely to initiate cigarette\nsmoking in the future.2\n\n9 In addition\nto smoking initiation among youth\nnever-smokers, we demonstrate in\nthe current study that e-cigarette use\nwas also associated with progression\nto current established smoking\namong youth smoking experimenters.\nIn a study of California 10th grade\nstudents that included never smokers\nand current smokers at baseline,\ngreater frequency of e-cigarette\nuse at baseline was associated\nwith subsequently greater levels of\nsmoking frequency (days smoked\nin past month) and heaviness\n(cigarettes smoked per day) 6\nmonths later.21 Similarly, in a school-\nbased study of adolescent never\nand current smokers in Canada,\nbaseline past 30-day e-cigarette\nuse was associated with initiation\nof daily smoking 1 year later.4 In\nthe results of a school-based study\nof baseline cigarette ever smokers\nin Hawaii, a statistically significant\nchange at follow-up in smoking\nfrequency (measured as numerical\ncategories) between baseline\ne-cigarette ever and never users\nwas not yielded.2 However, in a\nschool-based study of adolescents\nin the United Kingdom, ever use\n(versus never use) of e-cigarettes\nwas associated with \"escalation\" to\nsmoking sometimes or usually among\nbaseline nonsmokers who had used\ncigarettes in the past.5 Authors of\nthat study reported an adjusted OR\nthat was similar to the current study\nChaffee et al\nstatistically significant (P = .13) in a\nThe smoking outcomes evaluated\nin the current study represent\nintensity levels of clear clinical and\npublic health concern. Although\nsmoking as infrequently as 1 day\nin the past month in adolescence is\npredictive of adult smoking,\nwho reach higher levels of smoking\nare even more likely to continue\nto smoke.12 Additionally, although\nmore recent (past 30-day) e-cigarette\nuse was a stronger predictor of\nfuture established smoking than\nformer e-cigarette use in unadjusted\nmodels, this pattern did not\nnecessarily persist in fully adjusted\nmodels. We suggest that any level\nof e-cigarette use among adolescent\ncigarette experimenters may be a\nmeaningful risk indicator of smoking\nprogression.\nSeveral study advantages\nstrengthened the conclusions that\ncan be drawn from this research. The\nlarge, prospective, and nationally\nrepresentative nature of the PATH\nStudy enhanced generalizability and\ncertainty regarding the temporal\nsequence between exposure and\noutcome. The PATH questionnaire\nwas rigorously pilot tested and\nadministered under a consistent\nprotocol.14 Furthermore, the\nmagnitude of associations found in\nthis study was largely consistent\nacross different specifications of\ne-cigarette and cigarette use. Among\nother study aspects to consider,\nin-home administration of the PATH\nquestionnaire could have led to\ndifferences in estimated tobacco\nuse compared with school-based\nsurveys. However, results of this\nanalysis were qualitatively similar to\nprevious work in which NYTS data\nwas used.13 As with all observational\nstudies, residual confounding from\nunmeasured variables cannot be\nruled out, although associations\nremained positive and at the\nthreshold for statistical significance\nafter adjustment for an extensive set\nof variables known to predict youth\ncigarette smoking.23\nAdministration announced a plan for\ntobacco and nicotine regulation that\ndelayed federal e-cigarette regulation\nlocal governments have taken\nregulatory action of e-cigarettes.\nCalifornia, ordinance prohibits the\nsale of flavored tobacco products,\nincluding e-cigarettes, with the\nintention of reducing the appeal of\ntobacco products to youth.25 It is\nindicated in our results that among\nyouth cigarette experimenters, those\nwho have also used e-cigarettes are\nmore likely to progress to current\nestablished smoking than those\nwho tried cigarettes alone. As long\nas e-cigarettes remain attractive to\nyouth, concern persists that these\nproducts contribute to greater\ncombustible cigarette smoking\namong adolescents.\nConclusions\nAmong youth cigarette\nexperimenters, using e-cigarettes\nwas positively and independently\nassociated with future onset of\ncurrent established smoking,\nsuggesting that e-cigarettes do not\ndivert from, and may encourage,\ncigarette smoking in this population.\nIn weighing the overall public health\nimpact of e-cigarette availability,\nregulation, and use, the potential\nto increase combustible cigarette\nsmoking by youth deserves special\nconsideration.\nReferences\nJamal A, Gentzke A, Hu SS, et al.\nTobacco use among middle\nand high school students\u00adUnited\nWills TA, Knight R, Sargent JD, Gibbons\nFX, Pagano I, Williams RJ.
