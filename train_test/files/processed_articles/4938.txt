It has improved the morbidity and\nmortality associated with HIV, turning it into a chronic dis-\nease. However, cART, together with the virus itself,\nincreases the risk of various metabolic complications,\nincluding obesity,1 type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and\ncardiovascular disease (CVD).2 Indeed, CVD is the lead-\ning cause of death in HIV-infected patients on cART with\na linear increase in the incidence of myocardial infarction\nobserved with long-term cART exposure.3\nInsulin resistance (IR) is central to the development of\ncardiometabolic disease,4 being present in 21% of HIV\npatients on antiretroviral (ARV) therapy.5 In vitro as well\nas single-drug studies in both healthy6 and HIV-infected\npatients7 have shown that IR can be induced by both pro-\ntease inhibitors (PIs) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase\ninhibitors (NRTIs). Although newer ARVs are increas-\ningly used in clinical practice, IR still remains an impor-\ntant problem; HIV patients (n\n=\ntenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine (TDF/3TC) with\nTelmisartan reverses\nantiretroviral-induced adipocyte toxicity\nand insulin resistance in vitro\nSudeep P Pushpakom1 , Antonysunil Adaikalakoteswari2,\nAndrew Owen1, David J Back1, Gyanendra Tripathi3,\nSudhesh Kumar2, Philip McTernan2 and Munir Pirmohamed1\n Keywords\nHIV, antiretroviral, insulin resistance, metabolic disease, telmisartan, adipocyte\n1Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, The Wolfson\nCentre for Personalised Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool,\nUK\n2Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK\n3Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Westminster,\nLondon, UK\nCorresponding author:\nSudeep P Pushpakom, Department of Molecular and Clinical\nPharmacology, The Wolfson Centre for Personalised Medicine,\nUniversity of Liverpool, Block A: Waterhouse Buildings, 1-5 Brownlow\nStreet, Liverpool L69 3GL, UK.\nEmail: sudeepp@liverpool.ac.uk\nOriginal Article\neither boosted atazanavir (ATV) or boosted darunavir or\nraltegravir showed a 1.9-fold increase in homeostatic\nmodel assessment\u00adIR (HOMA-IR) within 4\nImportantly, HIV-associated metabolic disease results in\nincreased healthcare burden; a recent study in the United\nStates identified the management of IR/diabetes to be the\nbiggest contributor to the cost burden and resource use\namong all HIV-related adverse events studied.9\nAdipose tissue is an important determinant of IR and\nmay therefore play a key role in cART-associated meta-\nbolic disease. Adipose tissue has also been shown to be a\nreservoir for HIV and a source of chronic inflammation.10\nClinical interventions to arrest or reverse cART-associated\nadipose-mediated IR are a potential strategy to reduce the\nincidence of T2DM and CVD in HIV-positive patients. To\nthis end, insulin sensitisers such as thiazolidinediones and\nmetformin have been trialled, but results from randomised\nclinical trials in HIV-positive patients have been disap-\npointing and sometimes deleterious.11\u00ad13 There is therefore\na need for novel clinical interventions that can reduce\ncART-induced IR in HIV-positive individuals.\nPreliminary in vitro studies have suggested that tel-\nmisartan (TEL), an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB),\nreduces cART-induced adipose dysfunction by inhibition\nof the renin\u00adangiotensin system (RAS).14 In addition to\nbeing an ARB, TEL is also a partial agonist at the peroxi-\nsome proliferator receptor-gamma (PPAR) receptor,15 a\nkey regulator of adipose tissue metabolism.16 In this arti-\ncle, we further evaluate the effect of TEL on cART-induced\nadipocyte dysfunction and IR in a novel chronic in vitro\ntoxicity model, in addition to assessing its concentration\u00ad\nresponse relationship.\nMaterials and methods\nMaterials\nMurine 3T3-F442A cells were a kind gift from Prof Karen\nChapman (University of Edinburgh). Primary human\nabdominal subcutaneous preadipocytes were obtained\ncommercially from age- and sex-matched healthy donors\n(n=3;bodymassindex<25kg/m2;Promocell,Heidelberg,\nGermany). Collection of adipose tissue was approved by\nlocal ethics committee and all donors gave informed con-\nsent. None of the donors had any known medical condi-\ntions (i.e. hypertension, CVD, thyroid disorders, renal\ndisorders, diabetes or chronic pain conditions) or were on\nendocrine, anti-inflammatory, statin, thiazolidinedione or\nantihypertensive therapy. Lopinavir (LPV), ritonavir\n(RTV), ATV and rosiglitazone (ROSI) were purchased\nfrom Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX, USA) and\nTEL was provided by Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH\n(Ingelheim, Germany). Adipocyte media were obtained\nfrom PromoCell. TaqMan gene expression assays [PPAR\nand lipin 1 (LPIN1)] and TaqMan Gene Expression Master\nMix were purchased from Life Technologies Ltd (Paisley,\nUK). Singleplex and multiplex enzyme-linked immuno-\nsorbent assays (ELISAs) for adipokines [adiponectin,\ninterleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-)\nand resistin] were obtained from Merck Millipore\n(Hertfordshire, UK) and Life Technologies Ltd. A colori-\nmetric assay for free fatty acid release was obtained from\nAbcam (Cambridge, UK). Estimation of phospho-Akt\n) and total Akt was performed by sandwich\nELISA kits obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific\n(Paisley, UK).\nMethods\nIn vitro chronic adipocyte toxicity model:ARVs accumulate\nextensively within the adipocytes,10 and thus, we used a chronic\nin vitro toxicity model to mimic this. Briefly, both 3T3-F442A\nmurine cells and primary human subcutaneous adipocytes\nwere cultured, induced to differentiate as described\npreviously,17 and treated with PIs with or without TEL\nand/or ROSI throughout adipocyte differentiation. For\n3T3-F442A, the cells were cultured with Dulbecco's Mod-\nified Eagle's medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK) and\n10% foetal calf serum followed by the initiation of differ-\nmg/mL insulin (Sigma-Aldrich). Pri-\nmary human preadipocytes were cultured in a Preadipocyte\nGrowth Medium which is a low-serum (5%\nv/v) medium\noptimised for the expansion of human preadipocytes. Once\nthe cells became 70%\u00ad80% confluent, differentiation was\ninduced by culturing them in the Preadipocyte Differentia-\ntion Medium, a serum-free medium, for 3\ndays followed\nby further maintenance of differentiating adipocytes in the\nAdipocyte Nutrition Medium. Drug treatment was started\n48h post initiation of differentiation and carried out every\nmary human adipocytes). The effects of PIs were tested\nover a wide concentration range (1\u00ad20\u00b5M) including their\nnear-Cmax values (RTV and LPV: 10\u00b5M; ATV: 4.4\u00b5M).\nWe initially selected two different concentrations of TEL\nfurther dose characterisation of TEL, we tested a range of\nconcentrations (0.5\u00ad20M). TEL was coincubated with\neach of the PIs and added at the same time. ROSI (10M),\na PPAR agonist, was coincubated with LPV only in the\nprimary human adipocyte model as a comparator.\nMeasurement of cell viability.Viability of differentiating\n3T3-F442A and primary human adipocytes was assessed\nzolium bromide (MTT) assay.

Free fatty acid concentration in the\nconditioned media of primary human adipocytes was\ndetermined using the Free Fatty Acid Quantification Assay\nKit as per manufacturer's instructions (Abcam). Briefly,\npalmitic acid standard (1nmol/L) was used to prepare the\nstandard curve dilution; the reaction plates were prepared\nand incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30min\nand the absorbance was measured using a microplate spec-\ntrophotometer (Beckman Coulter DTX880 Multimode\nEstimation of adipokines.Adipokine (adiponectin, IL-6,\nresistin and TNF-) concentrations in the conditioned\n(primary human adipocytes) post differentiation using\nbead-based Milliplex Mouse Sandwich Multiplex ELISA\nkits (Merck Millipore) and Human Singleplex ELISA kits\n(Life Technologies Ltd), respectively.

Briefly, the diluted\nlysates were applied to 96-well plates containing immobi-\nlised monoclonal antibodies specific for human Akt and\nincubated for 2h at room temperature.

TEL significantly reversed\nLPV-induced inhibition of adiponectin at 1, 5 and 10\u00b5M\nconcentrations; for PPAR, the effect of TEL was\n\u00b5M only. Importantly, in both\ninstances, the maximal response for TEL was observed at\n5\u00b5M with TEL showing a non-monotonic dose response\n(Figure 6(a) and (b)).\nDiscussion\nWe have confirmed the previously reported toxic effect\nof PIs on adipocytes and also identified how PIs affect\nnovel adipokines such as LPIN1 and resistin. We also\nfound that TEL results in a partial but significant reversal\nof ARV-induced adipocyte toxicity and, for the first time,\ncharacterised the concentration of TEL that elicits the\nmaximal metabolic effect in vitro. We used 3T3-F442A\ncells as they are one of the most widely used in vitro\nmodels to study adipogenesis and are committed to dif-\nferentiating into adipocytes.20 They have also been shown\nto develop a homogeneous population of mature adipo-\ncytes that are morphologically and biochemically similar\nto adipocytes in situ.20 The chronic drug treatment design\nenabled repeated drug exposure to the adipocytes over\nthe entire period of adipocyte differentiation; this mim-\nicked the in vivo situation where the long-term ARV drug\ntreatment may result in cumulative adipocyte toxicity.21\nLPV and RTV were toxic to adipocytes in both in vitro\nmodels, while ATV, a more lipid-friendly PI,22 was not,\nsuggesting that the accumulation of certain ARVs over\ntime may reduce cell viability in differentiating adipo-\ncyte populations in vivo and potentially deleteriously\naffect the fat cell turnover and thereby adipose tissue\ndistribution.\nBoth LPV and RTV decreased lipid accumulation and\nmessenger RNA (mRNA) expression of the adipogenic\nmarkers, PPAR and LPIN1, consistent with their anti-\nadipogenic effects. By contrast, ATV did not show any\nFigure 5. (a) Lipolysis and (b) expression of pAktSer473\nin\nhuman primary adipocytes following incubation with PIs\nwith or without TEL or ROSI.

The contrasting effects of ATV support clinical\ndata,22 which show that ATV has very little effect on body\nfat distribution in HIV patients. This is the first study to\nreport an effect of PIs on LPIN1, a gene that encodes a\nmagnesium-ion-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphohy-\ndrolase enzyme involved in triglyceride synthesis23 and a\nkey factor in the maturation and maintenance of adipocyte\ndifferentiation.24 LPIN1 is also a key transcriptional\nregulator of PPAR and various genes involved in lipid\nmetabolism.25 Interestingly, LPIN1 mutations cause differ-\nent types of severe human lipodystrophy syndromes26\nalthough our previous work has failed to identify any asso-\nciation between LPIN1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms\nand HIV lipodystrophy (HIVLD).27 The inhibitory effect\nof lipotoxic PIs on LPIN1 could potentially be one of the\nmechanisms involved in the transcriptional downregula-\ntion of PPAR caused by these drugs.\nLPV and RTV had a profound effect on the secretory\ncharacteristics of the adipocyte regardless of the model\nused. Our results on adiponectin, IL-6 and TNF- further\nhighlight how certain PIs may interact with the adipokine\nnetwork and regulate their transcription leading to adipo-\ncyte dysfunction and interference with insulin signalling.\nIn addition, LPV and RTV but not ATV showed a signifi-\ncant reduction in the expression of phosphorylated form\nof Akt (Ser473); Akt is a serine/threonine kinase and a\ndownstream target of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)\nsignalling, and phosphorylation of its serine residue at\nposition 473 is an important step in the insulin signalling\nThis study also explored the effects of PIs on resistin,\nan adipocyte-secreted protein which is implicated in IR.\nWhile higher circulating levels of resistin have been impli-\ncated in the development of IR29 and diabetes,30 its role in\nHIVLD is inconclusive. Some cross-sectional studies have\nreported an increase in circulating resistin levels in HIVLD\npatients,31 while other studies failed to find an association32\nor even reported a reduction in resistin levels.33 We\nobserved a significant reduction in the amount of resistin\nsecreted by the adipocyte with all PIs including ATV\nalthough the ATV effect was comparatively less than those\nof other PIs. If resistin was involved in IR or adipocyte\ndysfunction, we would have expected its level to increase;\nour results suggest that secreted resistin might not be con-\ntributing directly to IR or adipocyte dysfunction in this\nARV-treated cellular model. Previous clinical studies have\nreported a decrease in plasma resistin with TEL in diabetes\npatients;34 however, neither TEL nor ROSI had any effect\non resistin in these in vitro models. It should be noted that\nin humans, resistin is primarily produced by cell popula-\ntions other than adipocytes,35 including peripheral blood\nmononuclear cells, macrophages and bone marrow cells.\nThis could potentially explain the discrepancy in resistin\nlevels between clinical and in vitro studies.\nTEL is widely used as an antihypertensive because of\nits ability to antagonise the effect of angiotensin II.\nHowever, TEL is highly lipophilic, and it has been sug-\ngested that its off-target effect on PPAR could be benefi-\ncial in the treatment of metabolic disease and CVD.36\u00ad38 In\nthis study, TEL was able to partially reverse the PI-induced\ninhibition in adipogenesis (lipid accumulation, expression\nof PPAR and LPIN1), improve PI-induced reduction in\nadiponectin and expression of pAktSer473\n(effect on insulin\nsensitivity), and reverse PI-induced upregulation in the\nsecretion of proinflammatory markers, IL-6 and TNF-. A\nprevious in vitro study had shown that TEL improves adi-\npocyte function following incubation with ARVs through\nblockade of the adipose RAS.14 It should be noted that\nPPAR is also a modulator of adipocyte RAS and activa-\ntion of PPAR using full/partial agonists like ROSI or TEL\ncould potentially counter the effects of RAS. By testing a\nwide range of concentrations of TEL (0.5\u00ad20M) on two\nexemplar markers, PPAR gene and adiponectin protein,\nwe observed TEL to show a non-monotonic response with\nthe maximal effect observed at 5M in the primary human\nadipocyte model. This dose response shown by TEL here\nis different to that seen on blood pressure, which is linear\nand mediated by the angiotensin receptor, AT1R. It might\nvery well be that both RAS and PPAR play an independ-\nent role in the development of PI-induced adipocyte dys-\nfunction; given that PPAR full agonists such as ROSI\nsuffer from serious adverse effects, ARBs such as TEL\nwith dual activity on both PPAR and RAS may offer an\nopportunity to reduce PI-induced toxicity.\nLimitations of the study\nThis study has not investigated the effect of ARVs (with/\nwithout TEL) in mature adipocytes; of course, the adipo-\ncyte population in vivo is a mixture of differentiating and\ndifferentiated adipocytes, but we felt it was important to\nfocus on differentiating adipocytes, as harmful effects\nhere would ultimately affect the population of differenti-\nated adipocytes. This study did not assess the effect of PI\ndrug combinations as used in the clinic; relating the con-\ncentration\u00adresponse relationships in vitro to the in vivo\nsituation is challenging because of differences that can\noccur in protein binding and drug distribution. It should\nbe noted that we have only used three replicates (biologi-\ncal replicates) for each experiment in this study, but there\nwas a high degree of reproducibility within the experi-\nments. Taken together, our findings support the beneficial\nmetabolic effects observed with TEL and open up the\nintriguing possibility that TEL could be used to prevent the\nincrease in IR that is seen in HIV-infected individuals\ntreated with ARVs.\nConclusion\nThis study has shown that TEL has beneficial metabolic\neffects on adipocytes when given in combination with PIs\nand therefore has the potential to reverse adipocyte toxic-\nity and IR mediated by PIs. The study also, for the first\ntime, has characterised the dose response of TEL in human\nprimary adipocytes. These in vitro findings now need to be\nvalidated in a clinical study which preferably not only\nevaluates, in a randomised fashion, the ability of TEL to\nreduce IR in vivo, but also identifies the optimal dose. This\nis currently being pursued in a phase IIb adaptive design\n"
