This helps us understand when and why cooperation will arise, and\napplied research shows how these pressures can be harnessed to promote various types of\ncooperation. In particular, recent evidence shows how opportunities to acquire a good\nreputation can promote cooperation in laboratory and applied settings. Cooperation can be\npromoted by tapping into forces like indirect reciprocity, costly signaling, and competitive\naltruism. When individuals help others, they receive reputational benefits (or avoid\nreputational costs), and this gives people an incentive to help. Such findings can be applied\nto promote many kinds of helping and cooperation, including charitable donations, tax\ncompliance, sustainable and pro-environmental behaviors, risky heroism, and more.\nDespite the potential advantages of using reputation to promote positive behaviors, there\nare several risks and limits. Under some circumstances, opportunities for reputation will be\nineffective or promote harmful behaviors. By better understanding the dynamics of\nreputation and the circumstances under which cooperation can evolve, we can better design\nsocial systems to increase the rate of cooperation and reduce conflict.\n",

Humans regularly incur great costs to help\nkin and non-kin. In terms of formal helping, in Canada in 2007 alone, 46% of people\nvolunteered 166 hours, on average, and 84% of people donated a total of almost 10 billion\ndollars (Hall, Lasby, Ayer, and Gibbons, 2009). This formal help is dwarfed by the vast\namount of informal helping performed in favors, information exchange, tips, and even\nrestraint from performing selfish behaviors. Canadians are by no means alone in their\ngenerosity, so we must ask: why are humans so generous to others, even towards non-kin?\nHarnessing the power of reputation\nA first pass glance at natural selection would suggest that helping others would be\ndisfavored when there are costs associated with helping, because those who avoid the costs\nwould have an advantage over those who pay them. Evolutionists have long known that\norganisms do not act \"for the good of the species\". Nevertheless, costly helping is\nubiquitous, so the question is: why? What factors have caused cooperative sentiments to\narise? This is a central puzzle in evolution. An answer to this question can help us to foster\nhelpful behaviors by creating situations to promote helping. Given the importance of\ncooperation on both local and global scales, it is crucial to understand the selective\npressures that maintain all forms of cooperation.\nWhy a Functional Approach is Necessary for Promoting Cooperation\nMuch research seeks to identify the proximate psychological mechanisms that\ntrigger helping behavior within individuals (e.g., neural pathways, specific emotions like\nempathy (Batson et al., 1997) or \"warm glow\" (Andreoni, 1990)). Other research examines\nhow these psychological mechanisms develop within an individual's lifetime (e.g., learning\n(Clark, 1975), gene-environment interactions (Knafo and Plomin, 2006)). These are both\nimportant questions, but it is also important to understand the function of these cooperative\nsentiments. Why do they exist at all? What are the advantages of possessing them? And\nwhat selective pressures cause them to persist? Together, these three research areas \u00ad\nmechanism, development, and evolutionary function \u00ad represent three of Tinbergen's\n(1968) four \"Levels of Analysis\" (the fourth being phylogeny), and an understanding of all\nfour levels is necessary.\nIn particular, it is important to understand evolutionary function in order to produce\nsocial change. By understanding the function of cooperative behavior, we can change social\nsituations to allow for more of that behavior. For example, which would be more effective:\na) understanding what selective pressures have caused cooperative sentiment to arise, and\nthen using that knowledge to create (or mimic) situations that are conducive to long-term\ncooperation because those selective forces are present; or b) investigating what specific\nemotions are involved in charity in order to trigger those emotions, hoping that the\ntriggered emotional response is specific enough to affect charitable behavior, and hoping\nthat it is not subject to habituation or extinction from a lack of reinforcement? Compared\nwith the former, the latter seems hopelessly indirect, temporary, and possibly ineffective.\nThis is why identifying the function of cooperative sentiment is paramount for producing\nlasting change.\nTo understand function, we need to know what consequences a cooperative person\ntends to experience. Our evolved prosocial sentiments cause us to perform helpful\nbehavior, so how do others respond to this? I argue that cooperative behavior often\nproduces reputational benefits, which outweigh the costs. However, it is important to note\nthat not every instance of helping will result in such benefits, nor does it need to. Our\nevolved sentiments may occasionally be triggered in ways that do not advance our fitness\n(Haley and Fessler, 2005; West, El Mouden, and Gardner, 2011), and occasional errors are\ninevitable in any decision-making process (e.g., Nesse, 2005; Todd, 2001). Instead,\nprosocial sentiments like empathy are adaptive on average, because reputational\nHarnessing the power of reputation\nopportunities are often present and important, and the average reputational benefits of\nacting on those sentiments outweigh the costs of occasionally helping when one cannot\nacquire a reputation (Delton, Krasnow, Cosmides, and Tooby, 2012). As such, reputation\ncan continue to have a powerful effect on helpful behavior as long as real reputational\nconsequences arise frequently enough to make such helping occasionally worthwhile.\nWhy Generalized Helping?\nThere is much research on helping that benefits kin (e.g., Hamilton, 1964), has\ndirect personal benefits to the helper (e.g., Diekmann, 1985, K\u00fcmmerli et al., 2007),\nbenefits someone whom the helper has some stake in (Kokko, Johnstone, and Clutton-\nBrock et al., 2001; Roberts, 2005), or is directly reciprocated by the recipient (Axelrod,\n1984; Trivers, 1971). These situations are well-studied in evolutionary studies, and I have\nreviewed them and their applications elsewhere (Barclay, 2011a; Barclay and Van Vugt, in\npress). Because humans also cooperate with those who are neither kin nor reciprocal\npartners, I will focus on one specific and particularly selective pressure \u00ad reputation \u00ad in its\nvarious forms. By understanding these selective pressures, we can learn to harness them to\nincrease helpful behaviors.\nIndirect Reciprocity\nPeople who help others tend to receive help when they need it. Some of this help is\ndirectly reciprocated by the recipient in the manner of \"you scratch my back and I'll scratch\nyours\" (i.e., \"direct reciprocity\") (e.g., Axelrod, 1984). In addition, help is often indirectly\nreciprocated by people other than the recipient (i.e., \"indirect reciprocity\") (Nowak and\nSigmund, 2005). Helpers earn a good reputation, and this makes them more likely to\nreceive aid than non-helpers. This pattern is shown to be evolutionarily stable in many\nmathematical models and game theoretical simulations (reviewed by Nowak and Sigmund,\n2005), and many experimental and field studies have shown that those who give are more\nlikely to receive, even from those whom they have never personally given to (e.g., Bolton,\nKatok, and Ockenfels, 2005; Gurven, Allen-Arave, Hill, and Hurtado, 2000; Milinski,\nMilinski, 2000). There is even evidence for indirect reciprocity in cleaner fish: client fish\navoid cleaners who are observed to give \"bad service\" to other clients; good cleaners\nreceive more clients (Bshary and Grutter, 2006).\nPunishment\nThose who refuse to cooperate do not only face a lack of rewards; they may also\nexperience active punishment from others. Such punishment can include monetary fines\n2002), negative gossip (Piazza and Bering, 2008), and possibly physical threats. These\npunishments promote cooperation because they make it costly to refuse to cooperate. In a\nrecent example, the British government shamed comedian Jimmy Carr into stopping a\ndubious tax avoidance scheme; this reputation-based shaming had strong tangible\nconsequences because it exposed actions that risked alienating his audiences (thereby\nHarnessing the power of reputation\nreducing his income).\nLaboratory and field data show that people are very willing to impose costs upon\nothers who do not contribute their fair share of time, effort, or money to a common cause\nYamagishi, 1986). Studies using brain-scanning technology suggest that people experience\npleasure when non-cooperators receive punishment (de Quervain et al., 2004; Singer et al.,\n2006). Punishment and indirect reciprocity can work together to promote cooperation\n(Rockenbach and Milinski, 2006), though punishment may be more cost-effective in\nsituations where unanimous cooperation is required (Oliver, 1980). But why be the one to\nperform the punishment, given the personal costs in terms of time, effort, and retaliation\nrisk (Oliver, 1980; Yamagishi, 1986)? One solution is that punishers receive reputational\nbenefits by signaling their dislike of unfairness, ability to punish, and intolerance of being\nBarclay, 2008). Altogether, punishment supports cooperation by targeting those with bad\nreputations, and reputation can support punishment itself.\nCostly Signaling\nSuppose that you possess a desirable quality that you want to advertise to others,\nsuch as wealth, genetic quality, or good character. How can you do so believably? One way\nis to perform or possess something that would be too costly to be worth it for someone who\ndid not honestly possess that quality (Searcy and Nowicki, 2005). For example, a peacock's\ntail is very costly to build, and the benefits of possessing a big one are only worth it for a\nhigh quality peacock (Zahavi and Zahavi, 1997). Similarly, Ferraris and mansions likely\nfunction as an honest display of wealth in humans (Veblen, 1899/1994). Such signaling\nneed not be conscious, just as a peacock does not consciously grow its tail to attract mates.\nExtravagant generosity may similarly function as a (probably unconscious) display\nof abilities or resource-holding potential. For example, philanthropy requires money to\nspare, and Bill Gates and Warren Buffett are known in North America as much for their\nphilanthropy as for their wealth. Hunting big game requires many abilities, and good\nhunters receive widespread recognition when they share their kills (e.g., Smith and Bliege\nBird, 2000); as a result, they have higher reproductive success than non-hunters (Smith,\n2004), including more extra-marital affairs (Kaplan and Hill, 1985). Heroes are praised for\nsuccessfully taking physical risks for others, and recent evidence suggests they are more\ndesirable as mates (Farthing, 2005; Kelly and Dunbar, 2001). Audiences attend and\nrespond to such acts because they carry useful information about the helper's abilities\nand/or resources, and the possibility of receiving something makes such acts particularly\nattractive to attend to (Smith and Bliege Bird, 2000).\nIn addition to signaling resources or abilities, helpful behavior can signal\ncooperative intent and concern for others. In long-term interactions, helpful behavior at\ntime A would not be worth it for someone who intends to defect at time B and face mutual\ndefection in each subsequent interaction (Andr\u00e9, 2010). As such, one's helping at time A\npredicts one's helping at time B, albeit imperfectly (e.g., Kurzban and Houser, 2005). Not\nsurprisingly, people are more trusting of those who give money to charities or to fellow\nHarnessing the power of reputation\nKeser, 2003). The costs of religious rituals may also function as signals of cooperative\nintent because the subjective costs would not be worth it for non-believers. As a result,\ncostly religious rituals are associated with higher levels of trust (Sosis, 2004). Charitable\ndonations are often religious donations (Hall et al., 2009). It is also possible that other\ngroups require costly rituals, volunteering, or philanthropy in order to screen out\nuncooperative applicants (e.g., fraternities, Masons, medical schools). For a more thorough\nreview of cooperation as an honest signal of abilities, resources, and cooperative intent, and\nthe empirical evidence for each, see Barclay (2010b).\nHarnessing the Power of Reputation\nThe three theories above have their differences, but they all rely on people acquiring\nreputations for (non-)cooperation. As such, their most obvious prediction is that people will\nbe more cooperative when they can acquire a good reputation (e.g., if their cooperation gets\nannounced to others, or if they receive some badge indicative of their cooperation). This\nprediction has been abundantly confirmed in many domains, including experimental games\n(e.g., Barclay, 2004; Hardy and Van Vugt, 2006; Hoffman, McCabe, Schachat, and Smith,\n(Bereczkei, Birkas, and Kerekes, 2007), contributions towards educating others about\nclimate change (Milinski, Semmann, Krambeck, and Marotzke, 2006), charitable donations\nLarimer, 2008), blood donations (Low and Heinen, 1993), socially responsible purchasing\n(Kimura et al., 2012), and simulated tax donations (Coricelli, Joffily, Montmarquette, and\nVilleval, 2010). Making people think about status can increase benevolence (Griskevicius\net al., 2007). Even fear of gossip or disapproval can stimulate cooperation (Masclet,\nThis increased cooperation is sometimes strategic (Semmann, Krambeck, and Milinski,\n2004; Barclay and Willer, 2007), but not always; observation might even cause a genuine\nincrease in cooperative sentiments such as empathy, shame, or guilt. Whether strategic or\ngenuine, it should be easy to add reputational opportunities to many systems, which will\nincrease people's cooperation (e.g., announcing people's cooperation in any domain, or\ngiving identifiable cues or badges to cooperators) (Griskevicius, Cant\u00fa, and Van Vugt,\n2012; Low and Heinen, 1993). For an additional review of this work, see Griskevicius and\nPeople are so sensitive to their reputations that they will respond to minimal cues of\nbeing observed. Haley and Fessler (2005) showed that people donated more money to their\npartners in an experimental game when there were stylized eyespots on their computer\nscreen than when such eyespots were absent. These results have been replicated numerous\ntimes with other types of eyes (Burnham and Hare, 2007; Mifune, Hashimoto, and\nYamagishi, 2010) including three dots in an eyes-like configuration (Rigdon, Ishii, Watabe,\nand Kitayama, 2009), and seem to be driven by implicit expectations of a good reputation\n(Oda, Niwa, Honma, and Hiraishi, 2011). Field experiments have shown that the presence\nof eyes increases the amounts that people pay for coffee on an \"honour system\" (Bateson et\nal., 2006) and reduces the amount of litter that people leave in cafeterias (Ernest-Jones,\nHarnessing the power of reputation\nNettle, and Bateson, 2011). This all suggests that reputation can be harnessed even with\nminimal cues, though the effects of such minimal cues may only be transient (see limitation\n#3 below; Sparks and Barclay, submitted).\nPeople give more when observed, and they give the most when competing over\npartnerships (Barclay and Willer, 2007). Engaging in competitive altruism makes people\nmore desirable as partners and gives them greater access to social partnerships (Barclay,\nincluding romantic partnerships (Barclay, 2010a; Iredale, Van Vugt, and Dunbar, 2008). In\nsuch a market for partners, it pays to \"keep up with the Joneses' generosity\" and possibly\nexceed it in order to get access to the best partners. Generosity is a relative term: someone\nwho gives more than average looks good, whereas someone who gives less than average\nlooks bad and risks losing the competition for partners. As such, people are highly sensitive\nto others' cooperation, for example, they give more money to radio fundraising when told\nabout others' high contributions (Shang and Croson, 2006), and make more pro-\nenvironmental decisions like cutting energy usage or re-using hotel towels when told that\nmost others do so (Allcott, 2011; Goldstein, Griskevicius, and Cialdini, 2007). Competitive\naltruism explains why people are so sensitive about appearing less generous, as well as why\ngenerosity can sometimes escalate. People are naturally competitive, and we can harness\nthis to foster competitive altruism including competitive sustainability (Griskevicius et al.,\n2012). For example, we can advertise the contributions of the best cooperators, publicly\nname the biggest philanthropists or the most prosocial individuals and corporations (Duffy\nand Kornienko, 2006; Griskevicius et al., 2012), and increase people's ability to meet high\ncooperators and assort into the most cooperative groups and partnerships (Barclay, 2011b).\nReputations are also important in business and consumerism (Frank, 2004). Many\ncompanies and consumers are aware of this, and trader reputations are already used to\nfacilitate trust on Internet sites such as eBay, Amazon, and TripAdvisor. Consumers may\nengage in \"conspicuous conservation\" when buying \"green\" products like a Toyota Prius\n(Sexton and Sexton, 2011), especially after they are primed to think about their own\nreputations (Griskevicius, Tybur, and Van den Bergh, 2010), or when they are presented\nwith social comparisons about what others do (Allcott, 2011; Goldstein et al., 2007). For\nexample, people purchase more fair trade products when being observed (Kimura et al.,\n2012). Because of this, we can harness reputations to promote socially responsible\nconsumerism (or at least less harmful consumerism). This can affect corporate behavior;\ncompanies often care about their reputation and this indicates that they are aware of the\nneed to appear somewhat socially responsible (or at least not harmful). After all,\ncorporations respond to market demands, and consumer boycotts have had some success at\ninfluencing corporations. Having more competitors will increase companies' need for\nsocial responsibility (or appearance thereof), as market size affects how generous one needs\nto be in social competition (Barclay, 2011b). Furthermore, individual CEOs can be made to\ncare about their personal reputations if they are seen as responsible for the socially harmful\nor beneficial policies of their companies. Thus, attaching reputations to socially\n(ir)responsible products can alter both consumption and production patterns.\nHarnessing the power of reputation\nWhen Will Reputation Work?\nThe effectiveness of reputation at promoting an action will depend on how that\naction is viewed. If an act is seen as \"good\", then reputational opportunities will result in\npeople performing it more often. In particular, \"good\" people will perform it more often\nwhen the costs deter \"bad\" people, such that the act carries useful information about a\nperson's character. Also, \"good\" people should not do \"bad things\" knowingly (though see\nlimitation #7 below).\nWhat determines whether an act is seen as \"good\", \"bad\", or \"neutral\"? This\nquestion is not always easy to answer. Some acts are almost intrinsically good, such as\nsaving others' lives. Other acts are potentially ambiguous: is public smoking good, bad, or\nneutral? What about drunk driving? Recycling? Purchasing biofuels? Supporting Cuba?\nOne must have information on how these acts help or harm others, otherwise they may\nappear neutral. Someone who knows the harms (or benefits) of an act but does (or does not\ndo) it anyway can be inferred to be a \"bad\" person. Drinking and driving campaigns have\nbeen successful at broadcasting these harms and creating reputational pressures against\ndrunk driving, and campaigns against littering and second-hand smoke have also enjoyed\nsome success. British propaganda in World War II generated social norms about\nconservation. One can imagine similar campaigns to increase awareness of the social harms\nof pollution, unsustainable consumption, and buying socially irresponsible products, and to\nshame those who take part in these activities. Similarly, one could educate about the shared\nbenefits of sustainability, recycling, public transit usage, full tax compliance, tree-planting,\nvoting, social action, or any other campaign (see also Kazdin, 2009).\nThis education effectively increases reputational pressures. For example, people are\nparticularly likely to donate to the fight against climate change when they are non-\nanonymous if they have already been educated about the dangers of climate change\n(Milinski, van Dijk, DeCremer, and Wilke, 2006). Thus, education and reputation work\ntogether such that education creates the reputational pressures, and reputational pressures\ngive people a big reason to care. Without reputational pressures, cooperation can decline\neven among people who are fully aware of the effects of their actions - this is the logic of\nthe \"tragedy of the commons\" that reputation \"solves\" (Hardin, 1968; Milinski et al.,\nLimitations and Unknowns about Harnessing Reputation\nThere are currently several important limitations and unknowns associated with\nharnessing reputation, all of which could undermine or reverse any attempts to promote\npositive behavior. The following limitations are in approximately increasing order of how\nproblematic each one is, and includes potential remedies (see also Barclay, 2011a).\n1) Reputational benefits must outweigh the cost of helping\nTo be effective, incentives must be sufficient to outweigh costs of acting. This\npoint, although obvious, is easy to forget in practice. If the expected reputational benefits\ndo not outweigh the costs of helping, then they will not be effective at eliciting helping, and\nHarnessing the power of reputation\nmay even suppress helping (see \"crowding out\" in limitation #6).\n2) Reputational cues must be stronger than other situational factors\nSome cues of reputation are very strong, like immediate monetary consequences or\na large audience of attractive members of the opposite sex. Other cues are relatively weak,\nlike eyespots in the background of one's environment (Haley and Fessler, 2005). Naturally,\nstronger situations or cues should have more impact than weaker ones (e.g., Xiao and\nHouser, 2009; see also Cooper and Withey, 2009). When non-reputational factors are\npresent and strong, like strong internalized social norms in a situation, then these may\noverwhelm weak reputational cues. More research should determine which cues (e.g., sex,\nstatus, and group membership of audiences) are most important to reputation.\n3) People may habituate to non-informative cues of reputation\nHumans are excellent learners, which includes eventually ceasing behaviors that\nreceive no reinforcement. If cues of reputation are not eventually followed by actual\nreputation that matters, then people should eventually come to ignore these cues. For\nexample, eyespots are a (false) cue of reputation, and Sparks and Barclay (submitted) found\nthat eyespots lose their effectiveness at eliciting cooperation in experimental games if the\neyes are constantly present. Soetevent (2005) found that reputational cues were only\ntemporarily effective in eliciting church donations. We might also predict that people will\neventually respond less to the scrutiny of audiences who do not react to cooperation or free-\nriding, or who cannot have any tangible effect on one's status or fitness (including by\ncommunicating with fitness-relevant audiences). To remain effective, false cues of\nreputation (e.g., eyespots) must be changed frequently, or occasionally followed by real\nobservation, and observation must occasionally be followed by reaction.\n4) Not everyone values reputation\nSome people may not need or value reputation (Barclay and Reeve, 2012; Rege and\nTelle, 2004), such that reputational incentives will not work on them. These can include\nindividualists, high status people, autistic people, or psychopaths. These types may require\nobvious, tangible, immediate, and strong reward or punishment. Alternately, social systems\nshould be designed to avoid having these non-responders drag down the cooperation of\nothers, possibly by focusing on the most cooperative people rather than the least\ncooperative.\n5) Reputation only pays off in the long-term\nIt is only worth acquiring a reputation if one will be around long enough to\neventually benefit from it. Accordingly, people who devalue the future tend to cooperate\nless in experimental games (Harris and Madden, 2002), and are predicted to value\nsustainability less (Griskvicius et al., 2012). Luckily, people's valuation of the future can\nvary adaptively according to situational cues (Wilson and Daly, 2004) and life\ncircumstances (reviewed by Griskevicius et al., 2012). As such, anything that increases a\nperson's perceived \"shadow of the future\" should increase their sensitivity to reputation,\nincluding a perceived future within a group.\nHarnessing the power of reputation\n6) Extrinsic incentives \"crowd out\" intrinsic motivations\nMany people seem to have internalized norms about helping others such that they\nHowever, much research shows that extrinsic incentives can reduce people's intrinsic\nmotivations (for reviews, see Deci, Koestner, and Ryan, 1999; Bowles, 2008). In addition\nto being ineffective, extrinsic incentives can make situations even worse: Gneezy and\nRustichini (2000) found that parents were more likely to be late to pick up their children\nfrom daycare when there were fines present. Similarly, punishment of non-cooperators\nundermines trust, possibly because it obscures people's motivations for cooperating\n(Mulder et al., 2006). Because of this, would-be social engineers must be very careful that\nany extrinsic reputational benefits do not reduce or \"crowd out\" intrinsic motivations for\ncooperation. One solution is to use implicit incentives like verbal rewards, which do not\nreduce intrinsic motivations (Deci et al., 1999), yet can still be effective at promoting\npositive behaviors (Barr, 2001; Masclet et al., 2003). Another solution is to give people\nopportunities to create their own informal sanctions rather than relying on top-down\nexplicit incentives (though see limitation #4 above).\n7) Reputation can promote negative behaviors\nWealth and power are often signaled through non-generous behaviors, such as\ndisplays which do not benefit others. Furthermore, individuals may also need to establish\ntheir toughness, unwillingness to tolerate exploitation, or risk-acceptance (e.g., Chagnon,\nopportunities can increase negative behaviors such as aggression (Griskevicius et al., 2009)\nand risk-taking (Chen, Baker, Braver, and Li, 2000). In environments where such traits are\nvalued, would-be social engineers must ensure that they only create reputational\nopportunities for positive behaviors (e.g., broadcasting people's cooperation but not their\nother behaviors) or they must allow negative behaviors to be channeled toward good ends\n(e.g., signaling toughness by punishing non-cooperators: Barclay, submitted).\n8) Reputations can be manipulated\nPeople will sometimes give to others when observed, only to be selfish when\nanonymous (Barclay and Willer, 2007; Semmann et al., 2004). Gossip can also be used to\nfalsely increase or decrease someone's reputation (Hess and Hagen, 2006). Corporations\nare well aware of this: \"green-washing\" refers to attempts to make environmentally harmful\nproducts or actions appear environmentally responsible, and companies may try to\nmanipulate their online reputations on internet sites like eBay, Amazon, or TripAdvisor.\nThe greater the reputational pressures, the more worthwhile it is to manipulate one's\nreputation or the reputation of one's competitors, even at significant cost. Potential\nsolutions to this include: increasing reputations to include all information necessary to\njudge an issue, using public costly signals to guarantee honesty and commitment, or\nincreasing the degree of partner (or consumer) choice to make it easier to replace a\npotentially dishonest partner with a genuine one. On a more public scale, increased funding\nfor watchdogs such as \"Truth in Advertising\" would help maintain the accuracy of the\nHarnessing the power of reputation\ninformation that people use to make their consumer choices.\n9) Identifying reputational incentives may reduce them\nIf you thought that someone was acting morally solely to receive social benefits,\nwould you still trust them as much? Probably not. When someone's motivation for helping\nis unclear, it can reduce the reputational benefits that he or she receives because it makes\nthe helping less effective as a signal of good character. People may even deliberately call\nattention to such benefits in order to downplay the generosity of their competitors. This\nmay be currently difficult to resolve because there is little theoretical or empirical work on\nthe details of how signals of cooperative intent work. Some potential solutions include: a)\ncreating subtle opportunities for reputational benefit while strictly avoiding mention of\nsuch benefits; b) announcing people's generosity on their behalf so they can avoid\n\"shameless self-promotion\"; c) comparing people who acquire a reputation via helping\nwith people who don't help at all, or with people who acquire a reputation in less positive\nways like conspicuous consumption. A focus on the appropriate comparisons should help\nmaintain at least some reputational benefits.\nConclusions\nReputation represents a largely untapped resource for eliciting all types of\ncooperative behaviors. The above limitations and unknowns about reputation are not\ninsurmountable problems, as careful planning can circumvent them. Some may inspire\nmore theoretical and empirical research about the dynamics and creation of reputation.\nBecause reputation focuses on the ultimate function(s) of cooperation instead of merely its\nproximate psychological causes, a mature science of reputation can help to produce long-\nlasting solutions for promoting cooperation.\n"
