    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe main aim of the study is pilot evaluation of the life skills program REBOUND in a school context focusing on substance\nuse, risk perception, and knowledge about psychoactive substances ( nIG CG\nM\nage\n= 14.8, range 14-18) for the total sample and in the subgroups gender, age, and school type. Main goal of the study is\ncollecting evidence for program optimization. A controlled study was carried out with repeated measurement before and\nafter the intervention (4-6 months). Multilevel analyses, ANCOVA, and logistic regression analyses were applied to measure\nthe effects. Overall, significantly lower incidence rates of drunkenness (odds ratio [OR] = .55; p = .033), improved knowledge\nabout psychoactive substances (p = .006), lower personal (p = .013) and general tobacco risk perception among users\n(p = .002), and lower general tobacco (p = .018) and cannabis (p = .000) risk perception in non-users were found in the total\nintervention group. In subgroups, significantly lower rates for the incidence of drunkenness can be shown for males (p =\n.008) and for younger participants (p = .004). Students at academic high school (German Gymnasium) showed a decrease in\n30-day prevalence for alcohol (p = .017) and cannabis (p = .014), and they improved in their knowledge about psychoactive\nsubstances (p = .000). In vocational high school classes (German Realschule), there was an increase in the relative alcohol risk\nperception of the students (p = .019). REBOUND contributes to a controlled use of alcohol and increases knowledge about\npsychoactive substances. REBOUND has various effects on the examined subgroups age, gender, and school type: Males,\nyounger students, and students in academic high school benefitted more from the course regarding consumption-related\ncriteria. We suggest a program optimization specific to school form and age, inclusion of a tobacco intervention, and the use\nof more gender-segregated interventions.\n",

It is a self-regulative strategy\nsensu Bandura (2005) and can be seen as a part of health\nFour dimensions were hypothesized as constituting risk\ncompetence: (a) self-reflection and risk reflection, (b) verifi-\nable knowledge about psychoactive substances and their use,\n(c) control, that is, the intention to and success with limiting\none's use, and (d) an orientation toward positive goals in the\nfuture that exclude destructive substance use.\nChallenges for the promotion of risk competence are for\nexample delaying the onset of use, which is an important pre-\ndictor for later addiction (Chou & Pickering, 1992; Laucht &\n1985). Others are the heterogeneous consumption habits at\nthis age, differences in gender, and school-form consumption\npatterns that need to be considered for intervention and call\nfor the analysis of subgroups in evaluation (Rothwell, 2005).\nFor example, male gender is associated with higher con-\nsumption of psychoactive substances (Kulis, Yabiku,\nMarsiglia, Nieri, & Crossman, 2007; Lev-Ran, Le Strat,\nThe participants of the present study were from voca-\ntional high school (Realschule) and academic high school\n(Gymnasium). Studies have shown different prevalences of\nsubstance use at different types of schools (Bundeszentrale\nf\u00fcr gesundheitliche Aufkl\u00e4rung, 2012; O'Malley, Johnston,\nHypotheses\nWe assume that the participation in REBOUND has a posi-\ntive effect on risk competence that will lead to no or a\ndecreased consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis;\npromote adequate risk perception; and increase participants'\nknowledge about psychoactive substances. In addition, we\nexamine whether the reported effects in predefined sub-\ngroups hold for REBOUND; that is, participants benefit\nmore from the program, when they are younger, female, and\nstudents at academic high school.\nMethod\nStudy Design and Setting\nA controlled study with repeated measurements was con-\nducted in southern Germany from September 2011 to July\n2012. In this naturalistic field study, the intervention group\n(IG) consisted of school classes (ninth and 10th graders)\ntaking part in the program over a period of 4 to 5 months.\nThe control group (CG) consisted of classes of the same age\ngroup. Twenty-nine course instructors were trained for the\npilot phase and implemented the program for their first time.\nDue to the number of participating schools in the program's\ndevelopmental phase, randomization in this quasi-experi-\nmental design was conducted by classrooms, rather than by\nthe low number of schools in the development phase and did\nnot succeed in all cases, due to the practical fact that some\nschools were not able to adjust their class schedules in such\na way that the REBOUND teachers could be assigned to the\nrandomized classes. Blind randomization was not possible\nbecause students, parents, and trainers would know which\ngroup participated in REBOUND and which did not.\nThe survey was conducted online using EFS-Survey 8.1\n(D\u00e9cieux, Heinz, & Jacob, 2011). It took place within 1 week\nbefore and after the intervention (M processing time 29 min;\nSD = 6.6). Response to all questions was mandatory with the\nexception of irrelevant subordinate questions.\nIntervention\nThe 16 units of REBOUND were integrated into school cur-\nricula and taught in weekly sessions of 90 min. The sessions\nwere facilitated by trained course instructors teaching at the\nparticipating school. They were optionally assisted by peer\nmentors. The intervention is described in detail in Kr\u00f6ninger-\nJungaberle, Nagy, von Heyden, DuBois, and the REBOUND\nREBOUND integrates best-practice elements, such as\npromotion of life skills, information about psychoactive sub-\nstances, the use of peer mentoring, and normative education\nIn addition, its developers created innovative methods, most\nnotably \"explorative film work\" consisting of joint scenario\nanalysis of videos depicting risk behaviors in realistic con-\ntext. The latter is based on Bandura's (2005) self-regulation\napproach and aims to enhance cooperation and risk assess-\nment among students. In the course of the sessions, health-\npromoting norms are identified by reflecting healthy and\nharmful cognitive\u00ademotive and behavioral patterns. For\nexample, the classroom would frequently talk about the abil-\nity to take a conscious break from weekly alcohol consump-\ntion or the necessity of training general self-control, body\nawareness, and peer-pressure resistance skills, if thinking\nabout trying a psychoactive substance.\nMeasures\nOur large questionnaire contained five different groups of\nitems relating to socio-demographic variables, substance\nuse, risk perception, knowledge about psychoactive sub-\nstances, and possible confounding covariates.\nThe following socio-demographic variables were collected:\nschooltype,gender,age,housing,familysetting,pocket money,\nJungaberle and Nagy 3\nparents' occupation, recreational activities, and satisfaction\nwith school performance. Satisfaction with school perfor-\nmance was measured using a 7-point Likert-type scale rang-\ning from 1 = not at all satisfied to 7 = very satisfied.\nThe frequency of alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use was\nmeasured by lifetime, 6-month-, and 30-day prevalence. The\ninformation concerning the 6-month prevalence was gath-\nered using a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 = not at\nall to 6 = 40 times or more. Thirty-day prevalence was equiv-\nalent to the number of consumption days in a month (0 to\n31). In addition, frequency of drunkenness and binge drink-\ning were ascertained for the last month. Binge drinking was\ndefined as the consumption of at least five alcoholic drinks\non one occasion. Finally, the intensity of last alcohol intoxi-\ncation was measured on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging\nfrom 1 = only slightly tipsy to 7 = so drunk that I could hardly\nremain standing on my feet. The items were adapted from a\nsurvey among 12- to 25-year-olds in Germany conducted by\nthe Federal Centre for Health Education (Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr\nThree different kinds of risk perception were measured:\nthe general--\"how risky is it for everybody?\" personal--\n\"how risky is it for me?\" and relative--\"how risky is it for me\ncompared with for other people?\" These were assessed for\nuse of alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis. We also asked non-\nconsumers about their perception of the risk for the general\npopulation. All were done using a 7-point Likert-type scale\nfrom 1 = harmless to 7 = very dangerous.\nWe developed a 40-item test to assess knowledge about\nalcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and psychoactive substances in\ngeneral with 10 items for each category (e.g., nicotine improves\nconcentration and short term memory; answers given as true,\"\nnot true, do not know). The do not know answers were counted\nas wrong answers. Cronbach's alpha for the total scale was .80\nbefore and .85 after the intervention.\nThe following covariates were measured on a 5-point\nLikert-type scale from 1 = not at all true to 5 = absolutely\ntrue: normality of the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and\ncannabis in the peer group (e.g., drinking of alcohol is com-\npletely normal in my peer group), parental acceptance of\none's own use of alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis (e.g., for my\nparents, it's ok, if I smoke), not being liked by peers (I am not\nliked by other kids), being bullied (other students often make\nfun of me), behavioral problems in school (I have had fre-\nquent problems in the school, e.g., fighting, disturbing the\nlesson), perceived bio-psycho-social stress (compared with\nother people my family and I have more problems such as\ndivorce, illness, financial problems), and the perceived rela-\ntionship with parents (in general, I have a good relationship\nwith my parents).\nStudy Sample\nWe were able to include 1,148 students in 48 school classes in\nfive schools in the quasi-experimental design. Twenty-three\nstudents chose not to participate. IG: n = 679 students in 29\nschool classes, CG: n = 446 students in 19 school classes.\nThe sample was constituted by students of academic and\nvocational high schools; other German school types were\nunderrepresented (n = 16 students) and therefore excluded.\nThe quasi-experimental design resulted in a lack of equiva-\nlence between IG and CG regarding a number of variables.\nHence, propensity score matching (Rosenbaum & Rubin,\n1983) was carried out to achieve equivalence between IG and\nCG, using the \"nearest\" algorithm of the R-package \"MatchIt\"\nwithin the framework of the statistical software R.2.15.2 (Ho,\nImai, King, & Stuart, 2011). This achieved equivalence on all\ntest variables except \"amount of pocket money a month\"\nTable 1). Due to the matching procedure, the sample decreased\nThe analyzed sample became after Attrition as follows: n =\nMultilevel structure.The data have a hierarchical structure\n(Level 1 = students, Level 2 = classes). Because of the similar\ncontext, higher correlations within the classes were expected\nthan between them (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] ).\nTherefore, at first, the ICC of the study variables (difference\nvalues between the pre- and post-measurements: T2-T1) was\ncomputed. This procedure was necessary to calculate the design\neffects (DE), so that the appropriate analytical methods could be\ndetermined (conventional vs. multilevel analyses). DE is a func-\ntion of the ICC and the average cluster size (m), which allows\nadjusting the sample size at excessive ICC. DE is calculated\naccording to the formula 1 + (m - 1) \u00d7 p. In the case of a DE >\n2, the application of a multilevel analysis is recommended (B.\nO. Muth\u00e9n & Satorra, 1995). In addition, determining the ICC\nwas necessary for the post hoc calculation of the discoverable\neffect sizes for hierarchical data. For two covariates and five\ndependent variables, DE > 2 was found.The rest of the variables\nyielded an average ICC after Fisher's Z transformation of .024\nand 3 in the two columns on the right side.\nControl of Covariates\nTo statistically control the influence of covariates on the rela-\ntionship between group membership and intervention effects,\ncovariates were selected that showed a high correlation with\nat least three of the dependent variables, but low correlations\namong each other.\nThese conditions were met by the following 11 variables,\nwhich were subsequently used as covariates: type of school\n(due to no variance at the cluster level not used in multilevel\nregression analysis [MLA]), gender, traditional family set-\nting (living with both biological parents), high socioeco-\nnomic status, satisfaction with school performance, leisure\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 1.

For each DV, a difference value of\npre- and post-measurement was calculated to reflect the indi-\nvidual change in the outcome variables. In the MLA, a fixed-\neffect model was used with a dummy-coded predictor\n(group) and random intercept specified for each DV. The\ninfluence of covariates was statistically controlled in the\nmodel.\nFor dependent variables with a DE < 2, we applied univari-\nate analyses of covariance and logistic regression analyses\nusing SPSS 0.20. Logistic regression analyses including group\nas the predictor and the covariates were used for the analysis of\nintervention effects on the incidence rates of alcohol, tobacco,\ncannabis, and drunkenness. The intervention effects on the\npre\u00adpost difference values of continuously scaled variables\nwere examined using fixed-factor group ANCOVAs.\nSubgroup analyses. The sample was divided into subgroups:\ngender, age (aggregated samples of 14- to 15-year-olds and\n16- to 17-year-olds), and school type (vocational and aca-\ndemic high school). Alpha error accumulation in multiple\ntests was countered by reducing the number of consumption\nvariables. The 30-day prevalence of alcohol, tobacco, and\ncannabis use and the lifetime prevalence of drunkenness\nwere included in the analyses.\nThe following variables did not show equivalence\nbetween IG and CG before the course (T1) and were excluded:\n30-day prevalence of alcohol in the subgroup of vocational\nand 30-day prevalence of tobacco use in the subgroup of aca-\ndemic high school students ( MIG = 1.53, MCG = .64, t =\np = .007), and general cannabis risk perception in drug users\n M SD n % M SD n % Statistics (df) p ICC DE\nNormality of the PAS--consumption among friends\nAcceptance of the PAS consumption by the parents\nNote.

First, interaction effects were examined between gen-\nder, age, and school type as well as between membership in\nthe IG and CG. ANOVAs and logistic regression analyses\nwere conducted.\nSome variables were dichotomous such as \"drunkenness\"\n(yes/no). The incidence rate of these was calculated using\nlogistic regression analyses. Again, we controlled for the\ninfluence of the four covariates. In each subgroup, seven\ntests were carried out, which contributed to the accumulation\nof the alpha error. Thus, sequential Bonferroni correction\nsensu Holm (1979) was used, which is less conservative than\nthe usual Bonferroni correction.\nResults\nAttrition\nOf the total sample (N = 2,153 pre- and post data sets in the\nIG and CG), 709 (36 %) student data sets were missing\nwere caused by having no match between pre- and post-data\ndue to absent or deviant identification codes.

Based on the adjusted effect sizes (partial 2) of\nthe predictor group, effect sizes f were calculated. A signifi-\ncant influence of the predictor group was found regarding the\nT2 - T1 difference values of the DV for personal risk per-\nception of tobacco use for users (AMD = -.85, F = 6.28,\nThese results indicate that after participating in\nREBOUND, users of tobacco rated their tobacco consump-\ntion as less dangerous than tobacco users in the CG.

The results of the ANCOVA and logistic\nregression analyses are presented in Table 5 and Figure 3 for\nall subgroups.

To determine the discoverable effect\nsizes in the subgroup analyses, sensitivity analyses (Faul,\net al., 2007) were conducted. Detectable effect sizes of d >\n.146 were calculated for the subgroup of students at academic\nhigh school (ANCOVA with two groups (df = 1), four covari-\nates, 1 \u00ad  = .80, and  = .05.

The probability for initiating first drunken-\nness was 0.44 times higher than in the control group.\nDiscussion\nSummary of Results\nThe present study examined effects of the life skills and risk\neducation program REBOUND on substance use, risk per-\nception, and knowledge about psychoactive substances. The\ntotal sample and the subgroups gender, age, and school types\nwere examined.\nIn the total sample, fewer students initiated first drunken-\nness compared with controls. The decreased initiation of\ndrunkenness directly after the course can be interpreted as a\nfirst indication of risk competent dealing with alcohol and\nnot just a change of cognitions. Similar effects were found\npreviously in life-skills programs (Botvin, et al., 2003;\nAfter the course, the personal risk perception in smokers\nand the general tobacco and cannabis risk perception in non-\nusers decreased, but remained on a high level. However, no\nincrease in the incidence of tobacco or cannabis consumption\nwas found, although the average age of onset in tobacco con-\nsumptioninGermanycurrentlyisat14.3years(Bundeszentrale\nf\u00fcr gesundheitliche Aufkl\u00e4rung, 2012); this is when the\ncourse starts. This decrease in risk perception could be inter-\npreted as iatrogenic effect, which would need to be cared for\nin a program revision. The alternative view is seeing it as a\ndesirable reduction in unrealistic high-risk perception (pre-\nsumably acquired through scare tactics). Such a dispropor-\ntionate risk perception may trigger a trivialization of risks\nwhen actually being confronted with the reality of drug use\n(see switching-risk effect; Zwick, 2005). This is particularly\ntrue for cannabis with its polarized public image. Given the\npolitical changes in cannabis politics, further research is\nneeded to determine such effects. In providing science-based\ntrustworthy and balanced information, REBOUND supports\nan autonomous and more adequate assessment of risks in this\nage group.\nSubgroup analyses showed that male students in the inter-\nvention group were less likely to initiate first drunkenness.\nThis indicates increased risk competence with regard to the\ncontrol of alcohol. Because the risk for alcohol-related prob-\nlems in males is generally increased (Lev-Ran, et al., 2013),\nthis finding represents an important component of the effec-\ntiveness of REBOUND. The program also had a stronger\ninfluence on the consumption behavior of academic high\nschool students (Gymnasium) compared with vocational\nhigh school students: The 30-day prevalence was reduced for\nboth alcohol and cannabis use in this school type.\nStudents in academic high school after the course show\nincreased substance knowledge, indicating better handling of\nobjectively verifiable information. This education bias con-\nfirms findings in previous studies showing that students with\nstronger cognitive and linguistic capacities benefit more\nfrom prevention courses (e.g., O'Malley et al., 2006).\nIn vocational high school, REBOUND contributed to\nincreasing the relative alcohol risk perception, suggesting a\nreduction of the self-serving bias (underestimation of one's\nown vulnerability compared with others; Weinstein, 1980)\nand indicating an increase in critical reflection and success-\nful risk pedagogy.\nAfter the course, the subgroup of younger participants\n(14- to 15-year-olds) had a lower incidence of initiating\ndrunkenness. This is a favorable effect considering the\nincreased risk of a pathological development connected with\nearly onset of alcohol consumption (Chou & Pickering,\nThe results of the subgroup analyses allow for a more pre-\ncise interpretation of the findings in the total sample. The\nincrease of knowledge in the total sample predominantly\noriginates from the participants in academic high school, and\nthe decline in incidence of drunkenness is due to the younger\nand male course participants.\nMethodological Strengths and Weaknesses of the\nStudy\nThe methodological strengths of the study are the multilevel\nanalyses, the propensity score matching, and the control of\ncovariates. These strengths can counteract the disadvantages\nof the study design. In this first evaluation of REBOUND,\nonly a small number of schools participated. This weakness,\nas well as school internal organizational issues, made only a\npartial randomization at the class level possible. Due to this\npilot design, a spillover effect could have happened\n(Angelucci & Di Maro, 2015), that is, a possible exchange of\nthe course content between IG and CG, and was not con-\ntrolled for. Randomization problems are well known regard-\ning educational settings. Due to the small sample size and the\nstrong dropout, only small effects (0.10 < f < 0.24) could be\nfound. More students with consumption experiences dropped\nout from the CG or were excluded in the matching proce-\ndure. Parts of the systematic dropout can be explained by low\ncompliance of those students who did not participate in the\ncourse.\nStrengths of the subgroup analyses are the examination of\nthe interactions between subgroups and intervention in rela-\ntion to the dependent variables, the statistical controlling of\nthe influence of covariates, and the Bonferroni\u00adHolm adjust-\nment. The sample equivalence was checked for all study\nvariables, and intervention effects were examined only for\nthose variables for which no differences between IG and CG\nwere found before the course. This meant only a few crite-\nrion variables could be examined.\nConclusion and Practical Implications\nThere is a need for life skills programs that include substance\nuse addressing young people in late adolescence and early\nadulthood (Foxcroft & Tsertsvadze, 2011; Thomas & Perera,\nbased programs typically are working with inhomogeneous\ngroups with significant differences regarding resilience and\nrisk behaviors.\nConceptually, the program is geared toward medium-\n(after 2 years) and long-term (over 5 years) self-regulation\n(Bandura, 2005). First improvements of risk competence were\nfound concerning knowledge and initiation of drunkenness in\nthe total sample; in subgroups, frequency of cannabis use was\nreduced. The negative effects on risk perception occurred with\nno negative effects on consumption measured after the course.\nREBOUND intends to stimulate a qualitative change of func-\ntions and social contexts of consumption (Franzkowiak, 2001;\nKoller, 2004), which has yet to be proved. Long-term effects\nof REBOUND as well as the long-term impact of the mea-\nsured risk perception changes should be analyzed in follow-up\nstudies. Future evaluation with a larger school sample should\ninclude program effects on life skills and resilience variables.\nTeacher and parent outcomes should be added.\nRisk education components of the program should more\nintensely consider the issue of tobacco use (Faggiano, et al.,\n2005), which is also strongly related to the consumption of\nThe first REBOUND program evaluation shows encour-\naging results for prevention programs that are risk compe-\ntence\u00adbased and not grounded on scare tactics or abstinence\norientation. The results as well as an analysis of a large quali-\ntative data set also provided information for the adaptation\nREBOUND is now ready for a new randomized controlled\ntrial (RCT) study and a multimethod evaluation of long-term\neffects. It is a promising self-regulation and risk competence\nprogram for age groups starting at 14 years which are\nengaged in multiple risk behaviors.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAjzen, I.
