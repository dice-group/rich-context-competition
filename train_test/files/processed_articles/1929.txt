They also evaluated the extent\nto which these biomarkers account for the female advantage in survival. Estimates from logistic regression models\nimproved discriminatory power in comparison with a base model that adjusted for demographic characteristics,\nsmoking, and baseline health status. The set of disease progression markers and the set of nonclinical markers\neach provided more discriminatory power than standard risk factors.

More than 3 centuries later, scholars in both fields are\nstill engaged in mortality prediction, with demographers\nfocusing on the influence of social, demographic, and be-\nhavioral factors and epidemiologists on risk factors for\nchronic disease. The recent proliferation of ``biosocial sur-\nveys'' that obtain sociodemographic information through\ninterviews along with biologic markers based on physical\nassessments and laboratory analyses (2) provides new op-\nportunities for enhancing mortality prediction.\nMost population-based studies of all-cause mortality (3\u00ad7)\nfocus on a set of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and\nmetabolic syndrome that are typically measured in preven-\ntive health examinations. More recent population-based\nstudies have included ``new'' measures, but most focus on\ncardiovascular mortality, and many include only a small\nnumber of biologic measures (8\u00ad14). Although cardiovascular\ndisease remains a leading cause of death in many countries,\nincluding Taiwan, an examination of a single set of causes is\nunlikely to provide a sufficiently general explanation of over-\nall mortality.\nIn this study, we used data from a national sample of older\nadults in Taiwan to integrate biologic and self-reported\nmeasures into models of all-cause mortality over a 6-year\nperiod. Our first goal was to evaluate the links between\nmortality and 3 sets of biologic measures: 1) standard risk\nfactors related to cardiovascular and metabolic function;\n2) markers of disease progression; and 3) markers of neu-\nroendocrine and immune function. We focused on the extent\nto which the latter 2 clusters enhanced mortality prediction.\nOur second objective was to provide insight into the sex\ndifference in mortality at older ages.

Numerous investigators have also\nused cause-of-death data and self-reports of morbidity to ex-\namine the sources of the sex difference (15, 19\u00ad21). By con-\ntrast, few investigators have used biologic measures to identify\nthe physiologic pathways that underlie excess male mortality.\nData\nThe 2000 Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging\nStudy (SEBAS) comprised a nationally representative sam-\nple of persons aged 54 years or older in Taiwan; elderly\npersons (ages !71 years) and urban residents were over-\nsampled (22). As Figure 1 shows, SEBAS was based on\na random subsample of respondents interviewed during\nthe 1999 wave of the Taiwan Longitudinal Survey of Aging\n(sometimes referred to as the Survey of Health and Living\nStatus of the Near-Elderly and Elderly in Taiwan). Written\ninformed consent was obtained for participation in both the\nin-home interview and the hospital visit; all protocols were\napproved by human subjects committees in Taiwan and at\nGeorgetown University (Washington, DC) and Princeton\nUniversity (Princeton, New Jersey).\nOn a scheduled day several weeks after a household in-\nterview, participants collected a 12-hour overnight urine\nsample (7 PM to 7 AM). They fasted overnight and visited\na nearby hospital the following morning, where medical\npersonnel drew a blood specimen and took blood pressure\nand anthropometric measurements. Compliance was ex-\ntremely high: 96% of participants fasted overnight and pro-\nvided a urine specimen deemed suitable for analysis.\nwent the physical examination (68% of those interviewed).\nparticipate based on exclusion criteria (e.g., serious illness).\nDisproportionately high nonparticipation rates were found\namong the healthiest and least healthy respondents, with\npersons who underwent the medical examination reporting\nthe same average health status as those who did not. Results\npresented elsewhere (23) demonstrate that, in the presence\nof controls for age, estimates from the medical examination\nportion of SEBAS are unlikely to be seriously biased.\nBlood and urine specimens were analyzed at Union Clin-\nical Laboratories in Taipei, Taiwan. In addition to the rou-\ntine standardization and calibration tests performed by the\nlaboratory, 9 persons (outside the target sample) contributed\nFigure 1.

Details regarding the\nremaining assays are provided elsewhere (22).\nSurvival status was ascertained through linkage with the\ndeath certificate file maintained by the Taiwan Department\nof Health and the household registration file maintained by\nthe Ministry of the Interior. After exclusion of 1 person with\nunknown vital status, those with proxy interviews (n \u00bc 17),\nand respondents with missing data on covariates (n \u00bc 72),\nBiomarker selection\nThe first cluster of biomarkers comprised 6 standard risk\nfactors related to cardiovascular and metabolic function:\nhypertension, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein\ncholesterol, body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2),\nwaist circumference, and glycosylated hemoglobin. Many\npopulation-based studies have established a link between\nthese risk factors and all-cause mortality (4, 24\u00ad27).\nThe 4 markers in the second group are used to evaluate\nand monitor disease. Creatinine clearance is a key indicator\nof kidney function. Albumin, the major protein found in\nplasma, represents a nonspecific but highly sensitive mea-\nsure of disease progression (28). Leukocyte (white blood\ncell) count is an indicator of cellular response to inflamma-\ntion (29). Neutrophils, the most abundant type of white\nblood cell in humans, are generally associated with acute\ninflammation. All 4 of these measures have been found to\nbe associated with mortality in population-based samples\nThe third group of biomarkers included 4 neuroendocrine\nmeasures--epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, and dehy-\ndroepiandrosterone sulfate--and 2 immune markers--\ninterleukin-6 and insulin-like growth factor 1. We refer to\nthis group as nonclinical because these measures are not\nwidely used in clinical practice and do not have well-\nestablished cutoffs. Nevertheless, recent population-based\nstudies have shown that these markers are associated with\nmortality (34\u00ad38), and a 3-year follow-up in Taiwan sug-\ngested that they may be stronger predictors than the standard\nBiomarker and control variables\nVariables based on the 3 groups of biomarkers are shown\nin Table 1. Classifications for the standard risk factors were\nbased on established cutoffs where appropriate (40, 41).\nDiastolic and systolic blood pressure were calculated as\nthe average of 2 seated readings (1 minute apart) taken by\na registered nurse (using a mercury sphygmomanometer on\nthe right arm) at least 20 minutes after the respondent ar-\nrived at the hospital. The classification for body mass index\nconformed to the categories used by the Taiwan Department\nof Health (42). The cutoffs for waist circumference were\nthose recommended for Asian populations (43, 44). Glyco-\nsylated hemoglobin was parameterized as a continuous vari-\nable because reference ranges vary across laboratories (45).\nTwo dichotomous measures captured data on the use of\nantihypertensive and hypoglycemic medications.\nFour markers of disease progression were obtained from\nthe fasting blood sample. Creatinine clearance was esti-\nmated from the formula of Cockcroft and Gault (46), which\nis based on the level of serum creatinine, taking into account\nage, sex, and body weight. Serum albumin, white blood cell\ncount, and the percentage of white blood cells comprised of\nneutrophils were measured as continuous variables.\nBecause there are no established cutoffs, the nonclinical\nmeasures were also treated as continuous variables. Epi-\nnephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol measurements were\nobtained from the overnight urine specimen, which pro-\nvided integrated values of basal operating levels during a pe-\nriod when most participants were resting; values are\nreported in micrograms per gram of urinary creatinine to\nadjust for body size. Levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sul-\nfate, interleukin-6, and insulin-like growth factor 1 were\nbased on the fasting blood sample.\nSociodemographic control factors included in each model\ncomprised age, sex, ethnicity (mainlander vs. Taiwanese),\neducation, and urban residence. We tested a quadratic term\nfor age to capture possible nonlinear effects; because it was\nnot significant, we excluded it from the final models. We\nalso included 6 measures of baseline health status: 1) num-\nber of current health conditions; 2) number of mobility lim-\nitations; 3) cognitive function score; 4) Center for\nEpidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (47) score; 5) global\nself-assessed health; and 6) recent smoking status.\nAnalytical strategy\nIn the initial stage of the analysis, we fitted both logistic\nregression models of the probability of dying between 2000\nand 2006 and Cox proportional hazards models based\non age-specific mortality rates over the 6-year period.\nDiagnostic checks indicated that the proportional hazards\nImproving Mortality Prediction 771\nassumption was violated for sex and several other covari-\nates. Thus, although a hazard model has the advantage that\nage can be used as the time scale, there would be no well-\nidentified procedure for obtaining estimates of biomarker-\nspecific contributions to excess male mortality in a model\nTable 1.

Moreover, be-\ncause we did not have additional information on biomarkers\nwithin the 6-year period to consider time-varying covariates\nand because all respondents were followed for the same time\nperiod, the logistic model did not present serious drawbacks.\nThus, we focused the analysis on estimates derived from\nlogistic regression, but below we describe the similarity of\nresults from the 2 approaches.\nIn order to adjust for the clustered sampling design of the\nTaiwan Longitudinal Survey of Aging and SEBAS, we in-\ncorporated into the logistic regression models a random ef-\nfect for the primary sampling units. Model 1 included\nsociodemographic variables and measures of baseline health\nstatus that may affect both biomarkers and mortality. Each\nof the subsequent 3 models added 1 cluster of biomarkers:\ncardiovascular/metabolic markers (model 2), markers of\ndisease progression (model 3), and nonclinical markers\n(model 4). Model 5 included all 3 clusters of biomarkers.\nBecause previous research has demonstrated that risk is\noften associated with both low and high levels of biomarkers\nor, more generally, that the associations between some bio-\nmarkers and mortality are nonlinear, we tested quadratic\nterms for the continuous biomarkers. We retained the 4 terms\nthat were statistically significant (P < 0.05, 2-sided): creat-\ninine clearance, white blood cell count, epinephrine, and\ninterleukin-6. To test the robustness of our findings, we\nrecoded our continuous biomarkers into categories based\non quintiles of the observed distributions and found that\nthe substantive results were unchanged (results not shown).\nWe calculated the receiver operating characteristic curve\nto evaluate the accuracy of the models in discriminating\nbetween decedents and survivors. The area under the re-\nceiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) summarizes\nthe performance of a model, with higher values indicating\nbetter accuracy. Chi-square tests based on the AUC values\nwere used to determine whether inclusion of a given set of\nmarkers yielded a significant improvement over the base\nmodel.\nFinally, we examined the contribution of each biomarker\nin accounting for the sex difference in mortality. Before\ndetermining the model to use for this exercise, we added\ninteraction terms between each biomarker variable and sex\nto models 2\u00ad4 to assess whether the effects of the bio-\nmarkers differed by sex. Because the interaction terms were\nsignificant (P < 0.05, 2-sided) for only 2 biomarkers (white\nblood cells and interleukin-6)--little more than what we\nwould expect by chance--we did not include these interac-\ntions in the model.\nIn light of a substantial body of literature that attributes\na large fraction of excess male mortality in industrialized\ncountries to smoking, we calculated the contribution attrib-\nutable to smoking as a benchmark. Thus, our base model for\ndetermining the mortality odds ratio (OR) for males relative\nto females (ORbase\n) included all of the sociodemographic\nand health-status variables shown in model 1 except smok-\ning. Because males have higher mortality than females in\nTaiwan, ORbase\nexceeds 1 and provides a measure of the\ndegree of excess male mortality after adjustment for the\ncontrol variables. Subsequently, we added a biomarker,\nwhich may have comprised more than 1 variable for bio-\nmarkers that were categorical, had a quadratic term, or in-\ncluded an associated variable denoting medication use, to\nthe base model. The resulting odds ratio for males\n(ORw/marker\n) was used to calculate the percentage change\nin excess male mortality attributable to that biomarker:\n% change \u00bc\n\nORw=marker\n\u00c0 ORbase\nORbase\n\nA negative percent change implied that inclusion of the bio-\nmarker accounted for some of the excess male mortality,\nwhereas a positive percent change indicated that inclusion\nof the biomarker exaggerated the sex difference. Corre-\nsponding calculations were performed for the smoking vari-\nable and for the 3 clusters of biomarkers.\nTo examine the robustness of our findings, we repeated\nthis analysis including information in the base model on\nwhether the respondent smoked. Because the effect of\nsmoking on excess mortality could not be estimated in this\nexercise, the estimates of percent change were larger for\nalmost all of the biomarkers. However, the relative impor-\ntance of the biomarkers remained essentially unaltered--for\nexample, the 3 biomarkers associated with the largest re-\nduction in the sex difference were the same regardless of\nwhether smoking was included in the model. Stata 10.1 was\nused for all analyses (Stata Corporation, College Station,\nTexas).\nRESULTS\nTable 2 presents estimated odds ratios for the 5 logistic\nmodels. Among the standard risk factors, only low body\nmass index (underweight) was significantly associated with\nprogression and 3 nonclinical measures (epinephrine,\ninterleukin-6, and, in model 5, cortisol) were significantly\nassociated with 6-year mortality.\nThe receiver operating characteristic curves for models\n1\u00ad4 are presented in Figure 2. Chi-square tests based on the\nAUC values (bottom of Table 2) indicated that inclusion of\neach of the 3 sets of markers significantly improved discrim-\ninatory power in comparison with the base model (model 2:\ndisease progression and nonclinical models (models 3 and\n4) had larger AUC values than the standard risk factor model\n(model 2). Additional comparisons (not shown) between\nthe AUC value for model 2 and the AUC values for models\nthat added the disease progression or nonclinical markers to\nmodel 2 revealed that both sets of markers significantly in-\ncreased the predictive power of model 2 (P \u00bc 0.003 and\nP \u00bc 0.002, respectively). Comparisons across the models\nrevealed that only the disease progression variables ac-\ncounted for a substantial fraction of the increased risk of\ndying with age (the odds ratio for age decreased from 1.12 in\nmodel 1 to 1.07 in model 3) or the level of excess male\nmortality (the odds ratio for male sex decreased from 1.58\nWe fitted models similar to those in Table 2 using Cox\nproportional hazards (results not shown). The Cox models\nwere stratified to permit different baseline hazards for men\nImproving Mortality Prediction 773\nTable 2.

The 2 sets of estimates\nwere very similar. For example, the AUC values for each of\nthe 5 models differed by less than 0.01 between the 2 ap-\nproaches. Similarly, for both the logistic models and the Cox\nmodels, the disease progression and nonclinical models\nyielded larger improvements over the baseline model than\nthe standard risk factor model.\nTable 3 reveals that an indicator of whether the respondent\nhad smoked during the past 6 months accounted for more\nthan half of excess male mortality: The base model implied\nthat the odds of dying were 2.3 times greater for men than for\nwomen, but ORmale\nwas reduced to 1.6 (and no longer sig-\nnificant) after the model controlled for smoking status. That\nis, more than half of excess male mortality resulted from a\nhigher prevalence of smoking among men than among\nwomen in this sample (41% vs. 2%). Two markers of disease\nprogression (albumin and neutrophils) and 1 nonclinical\nmarker (interleukin-6) each explained more than 10% of\nthe sex difference in mortality, but these reductions were\nmuch more modest than those from smoking.\nIn contrast, ORmale\nincreased after adjustment for many\nof the standard risk factors and for all of the nonclinical\nmarkers except interleukin-6. Because women are generally\nmore likely than men to have high risk levels of these\nmarkers, the model predicts that excess male mortality\nwould be even greater if men and women had the same\naverage levels of these biomarkers.\nDISCUSSION\nOur analyses addressed 2 important questions. First, do\nvarious clusters of biomarkers improve our prediction of\nSensitivity\n1 \u00ad Specificity\nFigure 2.

Sec-\nond, do measurements of these biomarkers shed any light\non differences in mortality between men and women at\nolder ages?\nWe found that each of the 3 clusters of biomarkers im-\nproved discriminatory power in comparison with the base\nmodel. In addition, after adjustment for the standard risk\nfactors, the markers of disease progression and the nonclin-\nical markers each significantly improved mortality\nprediction.\nWe also determined that smoking accounted for 55% of\nexcess male mortality. This estimate is consistent with sev-\neral studies in the United States and Western Europe that\nfound that, averaged over a broad range of adult ages, the\nsex difference in all-cause mortality attributable to smoking\nmarker in our study had such a dramatic effect, 3 markers--\ninterleukin-6, albumin, and neutrophils--each accounted\nfor more than 10% of the excess male mortality in our\nsample. Thus, measures related to inflammation and the\npresence or progression of disease may provide some in-\nsight into why males experience higher mortality at these\nages. For example, markers of kidney (creatinine and\nalbumin) and liver (albumin) function may reflect life-\nthreatening conditions that are more common among men\nthan among women.\nThis study had several advantages over earlier efforts to\nenhance mortality prediction in general populations. Fore-\nmost, SEBAS was based on a nationally representative sam-\nple of older Taiwanese. The survey collected data on an\nextensive set of biomarkers, was linked with verified\nTable 3.

Biomarkers were measured on a single oc-\ncasion--either overnight prior to the medical examination\nor during the examination--and may have been affected by\nmedication use or diet. The reference periods associated\nwith these markers vary enormously (e.g., glycosylated he-\nmoglobin reflects the previous several months, whereas in-\nterleukin-6 can vary widely within a single day). Moreover,\nthe restriction of SEBAS to persons aged 54 years or older\nmay limit the generalizability of these results to younger age\ngroups. For example, the estimates in Table 2 demonstrated\nthat low body mass index predicted mortality whereas high\nbody mass index did not; this finding probably arose be-\ncause of the association between disease and weight loss\nat older ages and is consistent with other studies of older\nadults (51\u00ad53). The relations between mortality and other\ncardiovascular risk factors--particularly cholesterol and\nblood pressure--have been shown to weaken or reverse di-\nrection with increasing age (53\u00ad55). However, estimates\nbased on separate analyses of respondents aged 54\u00ad69 and\n!70 years (not shown) indicated that the standard risk fac-\ntors, considered as a group, were equally strong predictors\nfor both age cohorts in Taiwan.\nAnother potential shortcoming is that our estimates were\nbased on the assumption that the effects of the biomarkers\non survival are the same for men and women. This assump-\ntion is consistent with findings from 2 large-scale popula-\ntion-based studies (13, 53) and leads to a parsimonious\nmodel, but it may understate the contributions associated\nwith indicators of disease and inflammation. This specula-\ntion is based on exploratory analyses which suggested that\nboth white blood cell count and interleukin-6 have larger\neffects on mortality among men than among women and the\nfact that the Cockcroft-Gault formula used to estimate cre-\natinine clearance incorporates an implicit sex interaction.\nHad we used unadjusted values, serum creatinine would\nhave accounted for a nontrivial proportion of excess male\nmortality. In future studies with sufficient statistical power,\ninvestigators need to reexamine sex-specific associations\nbetween the biomarkers and survival despite the potential\ncomplexity (i.e., the estimated contribution to excess male\nmortality would vary by the levels of the biomarkers).\nOur findings are consistent with previous research in\n2 respects. First, our results suggest that measures beyond\nstandard risk factors are predictive of survival in generally\nhealthy populations--a conclusion supported by a growing\nbody of literature on the association between interleukin-6\nand mortality in Western population-based samples (12, 35,\n38, 56) and links between overall mortality and 1 or more of\nthe following markers: epinephrine, creatinine, albumin,\nour results demonstrate that these biomarkers cannot ac-\ncount for the observed sex difference in mortality. Although\nsurprising at first glance, this outcome is in line with a com-\nparative study that demonstrated that the female advantage\nregarding standard risk factors was smaller in Taiwan than\nin the United States and that sex differences in hormonal\nmarkers embodied a substantial female disadvantage in both\ncountries (58). Fried et al. (53) reached a similar conclusion\nregarding the failure of biomarkers to explain excess US\nmale mortality, despite adjustment for cardiovascular risk\nfactors, measures of clinical and subclinical disease, and\nfunctional and cognitive impairments.\nThese results suggest that we and other researchers may\nbe missing critical physiologic systems or pathways that\nunderlie excess male mortality. Alternatively, the sex differ-\nence in survival may operate through huge numbers of po-\ntentially unobservable or unmeasurable physiologic effects.\nOur results underscore the importance not only of including\nan expansive set of biologic measures in survival models but\nalso of examining the ``social pathways'' through which\nbiologic effects may operate differently for men and\nwomen, such as risk-taking behaviors (other than smoking),\nutilization of health services, and compliance with medical\nprotocols.\nWhether the additional explanatory power of any set of\nbiomarkers is substantively important lies not in any statis-\ntical analysis or test but in the eye of the beholder. For\nexample, if the standard risk factor model is viewed as an\nimprovement over a demographic model of mortality, then\nwe need to recognize that the nonclinical and disease pro-\ngression biomarkers provide enhancements in prediction\nthat are at least as notable. Some researchers have argued\nthat selected ``new biomarkers'' yield only a minor im-\nprovement in all-cause mortality prediction (13) and that\nthe estimated cost of measurement does not justify their\nuse as a general screening tool (59), whereas others have\nreported that such biomarkers substantially improve mortal-\nity prediction (14). In the present study, we found that the set\nof disease progression markers and the cluster of markers\nreflecting neuroendocrine and immune function each 1) sig-\nnificantly improved mortality prediction over a model that\nincluded standard risk factors and 2) provided more discrim-\ninatory power than the standard risk factors. From a theoret-\nical perspective, the inflammation and disease progression\nmarkers provide a foothold for understanding the sources of\nsex differentials in mortality in industrialized countries, as\nwell as increases in mortality risk with age. On the other\nhand, from a practical perspective, we recognize that some\nof these measures may not be causally linked to survival,\nthat we lack information on preventive interventions based\non these markers, and that potential interventions may not\nbe cost-effective.\n"
