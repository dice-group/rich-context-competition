Eight carers attended and four who\nmet the eligibility criteria agreed to be interviewed. Participants experienced the arts group as providing a sense of\nfreedom and respite, strengthening identity through promoting achievement, offering social support through a collective\nfocus on art- and craft-making and increasing resilience for coping with caring. Some found the 5-week programme too\nshort. Benefits were linked to the security of knowing that loved ones with dementia were close by, being well cared for.\nFurther research is needed into the long-term benefits of creative arts groups for promoting carer well-being.\n",

Outreach tutors from a South London art gallery\nconducted four 90-minute art- and craft-making sessions\nwithin a Healthy Ageing Caf\u00e9 in an inner London borough.\nThe programme was designed in conjunction with carers\nwho attended the caf\u00e9 with their loved ones affected by\ndementia. During the carers' arts programme, the people\nwith dementia were cared for elsewhere, within the familiar\nenvironment of the caf\u00e9. The four sessions were followed\nby a joint art gallery visit for caregivers and their loved\nones with dementia, where they saw the group's creative\nproducts on public display alongside other artwork from\nthe gallery's collection.\nWhile informal caregivers are recognised as a crucial\nresource for people with dementia, many experience consid-\nerable stress and health problems. They report more depres-\nsion and anxiety than demographically matched people\nwithout caring responsibilities (Lavela and Ather, 2010),\nand are at greater risk of depression than those who care for\nolder people with other chronic conditions (Schoenmakers\net al., 2010). Some spouse caregivers describe struggling to\npreserve a sense of connectedness within their marital\nrelationship, a loss of identity and inability to meet their\nown needs (Gahagan et al., 2007; O'Shaughnessy et al.,\n2010). These losses may be compounded by reductions in\nleisure, social activities and other meaningful occupations\negivers, in particular, may feel unable to accept day-time\nrespite services from feeling that, as women, they are\nobliged to care and unentitled to leisure (Strang, 2001). In\naddition to experiencing stress and loss, caregivers of peo-\nple with dementia are also more vulnerable to declining\nphysical health (Pinquart and S\u00f6rensen, 2007), particularly\nin contexts of socioeconomic hardship and inadequate sup-\nport. Nonetheless, positive aspects of dementia caregiving\nalso need "
