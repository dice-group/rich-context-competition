Studies in recent years\nhave documented antioxidative and anti-inflammatory\nproperties of fruits and vegetables and herbs and indicate\nthat some of these can maintain brain health during aging\nunderstand the molecular mechanisms underlying their\nmode of action.\nSutherlandia (Sutherlandia frutescens [L.] R. Brown or\nLessertia frutescens [L.] Goldblatt & J.C. Manning), also\nknown colloquially as cancer bush, is widely used in\nsouthern African traditional and contemporary remedies\nfor a variety of chronic ailments, including cancer, arth-\nritis, digestive disorders, and diabetes, and more recently,\nbehavioral symptoms of HIV/AIDS such as depression\nand anxiety (Mills et al., 2005; van Wyk and Albrecht,\n2008). Studies with cell and animal models have demon-\nstrated its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties\nJiang et al., 2014). Although some evidence supports\nSutherlandia's benefit for mitigating stress (Prevoo\net al., 2004) as well as drug-induced seizures (Ojewole,\n2008), little is known about its broader effects against\nneurodegenerative diseases and stroke. Results from a\nrandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in\nhealthy adults of consumption of Sutherlandia for\n3 months showed it was well tolerated (Johnson\nConsumption of elderberry including the North\nAmerican subspecies (Sambucus nigra L. subsp. canaden-\nsis [L.] Bolli) has increased in recent years, mainly for its\nclaimed ability to combat symptoms of common flu and\nother viral infections (Zakay-Rones et al., 1995;\n``Sambucus nigra (elderberry),'' 2005; Vlachojannis\net al., 2010). Elderberries are widely cultivated in\nEurope, Asia, North Africa, and North America\n(``Sambucus nigra (elderberry),'' 2005). Elderberry fruit\ncontains flavonoids and anthocyanins (Lee and Finn,\nbeneficial effects of human health, especially cardiovascu-\nlar functions and anticarcinogenic, antiviral, and anti-\ninflammatory effects (Prior and Wu, 2006; Zafra-Stone\net al., 2007).

Despite\nthe increasing interest regarding these secondary\nmetabolites, little is known whether elderberries alleviate\nstroke damage.\nStroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide\nand is the primary cause of acquired disability in the\nUnited States (Davis and Donnan, 2012). Although the\npathophysiology of ischemic damage is complex, exten-\nsive studies have focused on the underlying mechanisms\nof oxidative stress and inflammatory responses following\nStudies have demonstrated the role of NADPH oxidase\nand activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase\n(MAPK) pathways in production of reactive oxygen spe-\ncies (ROS) and signaling events leading to mitochondrial\ndysfunction and activation of apoptotic pathways (Chen\nin vivo models of cerebral ischemia, the murine bilateral\ncommon carotid artery (BCCA) occlusion model has\nbeen documented to cause damage in the hippocampal\nYoshioka et al., 2011a). Previous studies with the gerbil\nglobal BCCA occlusion model demonstrated protective\neffects of botanicals such as curcumin and grape polyphe-\nnol extracts against neuronal cell death and glial cell acti-\nvation in the hippocampal CA1 area (Wang et al., 2002;\nBoth Sutherlandia and elderberry share the capacity to\nrelieve oxidative stress and suppress inflammatory\nresponses. In this study, the murine global cerebral ische-\nmia model was used to demonstrate that dietary supple-\nmentation by Sutherlandia and American elderberry offer\nprotection against ischemia-induced neuronal damage and\nglial cell activation and neurobehavioral dysfunctions.\nMaterials and Methods\nMaterials\nAntibodies used for immunohistochemical staining\nCruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and mouse anti-\nphospho-ERK1/2 (phosphorylated extracellular signal-\nSignaling, Beverly, MA). Cell-type-specific antibodies\ninclude rat anti-CD11b (cluster of differentiation mol-\nrabbit anti-Iba-1 (ionized calcium-binding adapter mole-\nRichmond, VA) for microglia, and rabbit anti-glial\nfibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibodies (G9269;\nSigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for astrocytes.\nSecondary antibodies include goat anti-mouse IgG-\n(A11007; Life Technologies/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).\n2 ASN Neuro\nAnimals, Diets, and Ischemia Protocol\nAdult male C57Bl/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar\nHarbor, ME) at age 8 weeks were housed 4/cage and\nmaintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at\n7:00 a.m.) with unrestricted access to food and water.\nPrior to surgical BCCA occlusion, mice were fed for 2\nmonths with a nutritionally complete experimental diet\nAIN93G with or without supplement of either 1% by\nweight of freeze-dried, ground Sutherlandia-dried vegeta-\ntive material or 2% by weight of freeze-dried, ground\nwhole ripe fruit of American elderberry, based on empir-\nical estimates of mouse equivalents of human consump-\nfor complete composition of the control and test diets).\nSutherlandia vegetative material was purchased from Big\nTree Nutraceutical (Fish Hoek, South Africa) and stored\nat \u00c020C in an air-tight container in the dark. The elder-\nberry fruits were harvested in 2010 from a germplasm\nrepository in southwest Missouri (United States) and\nfrozen in zippered plastic freezer bags. Berries were\nlater de-stemmed and cleaned, lyophilized, and ground\ninto fine powder before addition to diets. A mixture of\nseveral American elderberry genotypes was used in this\nstudy. Botanical vouchers confirming the taxonomic\nidentity of plants were deposited into the herbaria of\nthe University of Missouri or the Missouri Botanical\nGarden (St. Louis, MO). Average food intake was\n2.6 \u00c6 0.05 g/day/mouse; and average diet consumption\nmonitoring of body weight indicated no differences in\nweight between any of the groups at any time during\nthe course of the study. Approved animal protocols\nwere obtained, and all treatment steps were in accordance\nwith University of Missouri and the National Institutes\nof Health guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory\nAnimals.\nFor the study, mice were divided into four experimen-\ntal groups: (a) sham animals with AIN93G control diet\n(Sham/CD, n \u00bc 7), (b) BCCA occlusion-induced ischemia\nwith AIN93G diet (Isch/CD, n \u00bc 7), (c) BCCA occlusion-\ninduced ischemia with AIN93G diet containing 1%\nSutherlandia (Isch/SD, n \u00bc 7), and (d) BCCA occlusion-\ninduced ischemia with AIN93G diet containing 2% elder-\nberry (Isch/ED, n \u00bc 7). To conserve on animal numbers,\nsham operation was performed only on animals with the\ncontrol diet. Animals were subjected to a transient global\ncerebral ischemia by BCCA occlusion as described previ-\nously with minor modifications (Lin et al., 2000; Chen\net al., 2011a). To initiate the surgical protocol, mice\nwere placed in a holding chamber and anesthetized with\n4% isoflurane, and continuous anesthesia during surgery\nnitrogen and 30% oxygen with a face mask. During the\nsurgery, rectal temperature was monitored and main-\ntained at 37 \u00c6 0.5C with a thermostat-controlled heating\npad. BCCA occlusion was accomplished by applying\nmicroaneurysm clips on both common carotid arteries\nTable 1. Composition of the Control AIN93G and Diets Supplemented With Sutherlandia and Elderberry.\nIngredient\nControl diet 1% Sutherlandia diet 2% Elderberry diet\ng/kg of diet % of total g/kg of diet % of total g/kg of diet % of total\naYork and Bob Gordon cultivars (60:40 ratio) were harvested at the peak of ripeness, freeze-dried, then ground into a fine powder, and mixed with an equal\nweight of corn starch to prevent clumping. The amount of this mix added to the diet was actually twice that shown in the table.\nbSutherlandia was sourced Big Tree Nutraceutical (21 First Avenue, Fish Hoek 7975, South Africa). Prior to its incorporation into the diet, the chopped\nleaves were grounded into a fine powder using a handheld coffee bean grinder.\nChuang et al. 3\nfor 30 min followed by release of the clips and a 3-day\nreperfusion. Reestablishment of blood flow was con-\nfirmed by direct observation. Sham operation animals\nwere subjected to the identical surgical procedures\nexcept for application of micro-aneurysm clips. After sur-\ngery, animals were placed in cages above a heating blan-\nket to maintain rectal temperatures above 36C for 1\u00ad2 h\nwith active monitoring.\nAssessment of Sensorimotor Functions\nAssessment of sensorimotor functions was carried out by\nthe rotarod test as described previously with modifica-\ntions (Simonyi et al., 2012). Two days prior to BCCA\nocclusion, mice were trained on the rotarod (Med\nAssociates, St. Albans, VT) in the acceleration paradigm\nintertrial interval (see Figure 1(a) for the experimental\ndesign with BCCA occlusion set as Day 0). Latency is\ndefined as the time spent on the accelerating rotating\nrotarod without falling off or gripping and spinning\nrather than walking. Preoperative baseline values were\nobtained by determining average of the three best\nperformances. Postoperative testing (three trials) were\nperformed 24 h after I/R, and the means were used for\ncalculation of rotarod performance. Latencies measured\nat 24 h after I/R were expressed as % of performances\nreached before surgery.\nBrain Tissue Processing, Histochemical Staining, and\nAssessment of Neuronal Damage\nThree days after I/R, mice were euthanized with isoflur-\nane and brains were sectioned for histochemical staining\nand assessment of neuronal damage using a well-\nestablished protocol as described previously (Cui et al.,\ndially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 100-mM\nphosphate buffer, and brains were dissected and pre-\nserved for 24 h in the same buffer. Serial coronal sections\nMicrosystems, Inc., Bannockbum, IL). In most instances,\nbrain were collected into 24-well plates. Serial brain sec-\ntions 200-mm apart were mounted on poly-L-lysine-\ncoated glass slides and followed by staining with cresyl\nFigure 1.

(b) Accelerating rotarod assessment\nreveals amelioration of behavioral deficits from transient global cerebral ischemia by dietary supplement of Sutherlandia and elderberry.\nRotarod performance is expressed as percent of time the mouse can stay on the accelerating rotarod compared with pre-ischemia as the\nbaseline values. Four groups of mice were divided into (i) AIN93G control diet (Sham/CD), (ii) BCCA occlusion-induced ischemia with\ncontrol diet (Isch/CD), (iii) BCCA occlusion-induced ischemia \u00fe Sutherlandia diet (Isch/SD), and (iv) BCCA occlusion-induced ische-\nmia \u00fe elderberry diet (Isch/ED).

Briefly, whole slide images\n(WSI) of the cresyl violet-stained brain sections were\nobtained using an automatic multifocus plane, high-\nthroughput digital pathology system (Aperio ScanScope\nCS digital scanner, Vista, CA). Extent of neuronal\ndamage in the brain sections were analyzed in a double-\nblind manner using the following criteria for the grading\nscale: 0: no observable neuronal damage; 1: damaged neu-\nrons populate 0% to 25% of area; 2: damaged neurons\npopulate 25% to 50% of area; 3: damaged neurons popu-\nlate 50% to 75% of area; and 4: damaged neurons popu-\nFluorescence Immunohistochemistry\nFluorescence immunohistochemistry was carried out on\nbrain sections for astrocytes (with GFAP) and microglia\np47phox and phospho-ERK1/2. Briefly, fixed coronal\nsections from the area of interest were washed with phos-\nphate-buffered saline (PBS) and permeabilized with 1%\nTriton X-100 in PBS for 30 min. Sections were incubated\nwith Pro-Block (PBK125; ScyTek, Logan, UT) for 5 min\nto eliminate the need to match species with the fluores-\ncence conjugated antibody, followed by 10% normal goat\novernight with 0.5% normal goat serum in 0.05% Triton\nX-100 in PBS containing the primary antibodies (GFAP,\nphospho-ERK 1:500). The next day, sections were\ncontaining the appropriate fluorophore-conjugated sec-\nondary antibodies (1:300; goat anti-mouse IgG-\nLife Technologies/Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) for 2 h\nand counterstained in a solution of Hoechst dye 33342\nDiego, CA). Fluorescence photomicrographs of the\nareas of interest were captured by a Leica DMI 6000B\nautomated epifluorescence microscope (Leica\nMicrosystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL), and the high mag-\nnification photomicrographs were processed using the\nAF6000 stitching program and intensity analysis with\nthe ImageJ program. For quantification of immunofluor-\nescence intensity, five representative areas in the striatum\n(coordinated approximately to Bregma 0.78 mm) were\nselected bilaterally (as indicated in the Figure 4(a)), and\nthe microphotographic images of the immunostained\nbrain sections were captured. All microphotographic\nimages for examining each set of the experimental\ngroups were taken under the same camera and micro-\nscope settings including the dimension, voxel size, and\nexposure parameters (intensity, exposure time and gain\nfor each channel, as well as threshold values for black as\nStatistical Analysis\nData are presented as mean \u00c6 standard error of the mean\n(SEM). Results were analyzed by one-way analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni's posttest (V4.00;\nGraphPad Prism Software Inc., San Diego, CA).\nStatistical significance was considered for p < .05.\nResults\nDietary Supplementation With Sutherlandia or\nElderberry Ameliorated Motor Impairment in Mice\nAfter Transient Global Cerebral Ischemia\nA time line of the experimental protocol, showing feeding\nof mice at 2 months of age, presurgery and postsurgery\nrotarod tests, and sacrifice for brain pathology is shown\nin Figure 1(a). In this experiment, sensorimotor functions\nin the sham, ischemia, and ischemia with Sutherlandia\nand elderberry diet groups were assessed using the accel-\nerating rotarod paradigm. In the pre-ischemia rotarod\ntests, no differences were observed in sensorimotor func-\ntions between controls and the different dietary groups\none-way ANOVA). Rotarod performance was unchanged\nin the sham-operated group but was significantly impaired\nin the ischemia group assessed 24 h after reperfusion\n(Figure 1(b)). Consumption of the Sutherlandia or elder-\nberry supplemented diets for 2 months ameliorated the\nsensorimotor deficits by prolonging rotarod latencies.\nConsumption of Sutherlandia and Elderberry Diets\nDecreased Neuronal Damage After I/R\nCresyl violet staining of brain sections revealed substan-\ntial damage in neuronal morphology after BCCA occlu-\nsion (Figure 2(a)): While normal healthy neurons were\nround with pale-stained cytoplasm, many neurons in\nthe ischemic regions in cortex, hippocampus, and stri-\natum were angular in shape with condensed cell bodies\n(see higher magnification insets in Figures 2(b), (d), and\n(f), respectively). The zoomable WSI photomicrographs\nwere acquired from approximately 30 to 35 serial tissue\nsections with 200-mm interval per brain.

Quantitation of the cellular\ndamage in each region revealed that I/R resulted in\nsevere neuronal damage in the hippocampal but those\nin the striatum/thalamus/basal ganglia area and the cor-\ntical regions were also damaged albeit to a lesser extent\n(Figure 2(b) and (c)). Dietary supplementation with elder-\nberry significantly decreased the neuronal damage in all\nthe brain regions examined (Figure 2(c), (e), and (g)). To\na lesser extent, decrease in neuronal damage was also\nobserved in these brain regions on supplementation\nwith Sutherlandia.\nImmunostaining of Microglial Cells and Astrocytes\nNeuronal damage after I/R is often accompanied with\nincreased neuroinflammatory responses including astro-\ngliosis and microglial activation (Wang et al., 2006;\nthese responses 3 days after I/R by immunostaining\nbrain sections with Iba-1 for microglia and GFAP for\nastrocytes. Immunofluorescent analysis with Iba-1\nrevealed low immunoreactivity in sham controls but a\nrobust and widespread increase in the ischemic brain,\nespecially in the hippocampal and striatal regions\n(Figure 3(a), Isch/CD). Both Sutherlandia and elder-\nberry diets attenuated the Iba-1 immunoreactivity in\nthe cortex and striatum (Figure 3(a), Isch/SD and\nIsch/ED).\nWe also examined brain sections immunostained with\nGFAP as a marker for activated astrocytes.\nImmunoreactivity of GFAP was low in sham controls\nbut increased after I/R. The pattern for GFAP immunor-\neactivity appeared to be more spread out and diffuse as\ncompared with those stained with Iba-1 immunoreactiv-\nity (Figure 3(b)).\nSutherlandia and Elderberry Consumption\nAttenuated I/R-Induced Activation of Microglia but\nNot Astrocytes in the Striatum\nBecause the striatal region is more homogeneous, we\nselected five representative subregions for further exam-\nine cell immunoreactivity and morphology (Figure 4(a)).\nImmunoreactivity of Iba-1 expressing microglial cells in\nthe sham-operated group appeared mostly in the resting\nramified form with small round cell bodies and thin pro-\ncesses (Figure 4(b)), whereas those in the ischemic regions\nbecame amoeboid shape with irregular cell bodies and\nthick processes (see insets in Figure 4(b)). By assessing\naverage fluorescence intensity of Iba-1 in these striatal\nregions, significantly lower immunoreactivity of microglia\nin mice fed the Sutherlandia or elderberry diets as com-\npared with the ischemia group on the control diet\n(Figure 4(c)).\nSimilarly, fluorescence intensity of GFAP in the\nstriatal regions indicated a significant increase in\nGFAP immunoreactivity after BCCA occlusion as\ncompared with sham controls (Figure 4(d)).\nHowever, both Sutherlandia and elderberry diets did\nnot attenuate GFAP immunoreactivity as compared\nwith the ischemia group on the control diet\n(Figure 6(d)).\nFigure 3.

Scale\nChuang et al. 7\nSutherlandia and Elderberry Consumption Inhibited\nI/R-Induced Increases in p47Phox Expression in the\nStriatum\nA number of studies have demonstrated involvement of\nNADPH oxidase in ROS production during I/R (Wang\np47phox, an NADPH oxidase subunit, with GFAP for\nastrocytes and CD11b for microglial cells showed that\np47phox immunoreactivity did not colocalize with the\nGFAP expressing astrocytes (Figure 5(a)), but instead\nwith the CD11b expressing microglia (Figure 5(b)).\nQuantitation of the p47phox immunoreactivity was\ncarried out in the five selected areas in the bilateral stri-\natal regions. A significant increase in p47phox immunor-\neactivity was observed in the striatum (Figure 6(a)) as\nwell as in the hippocampus (data not shown) of the ische-\nmic brain at 3 days after I/R. Measurement of fluorescent\nintensity from different areas in the striatal and caudate\nputamen region indicated that mice given either botanical\ndiet had a significant decrease in p47phox immunoreac-\ntivity as compared with the ischemic group (Figure 6(b)).\nSutherlandia and Elderberry Consumption Inhibited\nI/R-Induced Phospho-ERK1/2 Expression in\nMicroglial Cells\nRecent studies with cultured microglial cells demon-\nstrated involvement of ERK1/2 in the oxidative/nitrosa-\ntive pathways associated with stimulation by\nlipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon gamma (IFNg;\nChuang et al., 2013). Based on the observations of\nincreased p47phox immunoreactivity and activated\nmicroglial cells in striatum after I/R, we further examined\nphospho-ERK1/2 expression in the ischemic brain sec-\ntions and compared immunoreactivity with the groups\nsupplemented with Sutherlandia and elderberry diets.\nDouble immunostaining for phospho-ERK1/2 and\nmicroglial marker CD11b indicated increased phospho-\nERK1/2 immunoreactivity colocalized with many\nFigure 4.

Fluorescence intensity analysis showed sig-\nnificant decrease in phospho-ERK1/2 immunoreactivity\nin both dietary groups as compared with the ischemia\ncontrol group (Figure 7(b) and (c)).\nDiscussion\nThis study demonstrates that dietary Sutherlandia and\nelderberry mitigate behavioral deficits and pathology\ninduced by BCCA occlusion in mice. These results\nagree with and extend our earlier studies using the\nMongolian gerbil model demonstrating botanicals such\nas curcumin, apocynin, and grape polyphenols protect\nfor 5 min causes extensive neuron cell death and glial\nactivation in the hippocampal CA1 area 4 days after\nI/R (Wang et al., 2002). More recent studies by others\nusing the murine model, and BCCA occlusion for 22 min\nresulted in damage in the hippocampal area as well as the\nstriatal area (Yoshioka et al., 2011b). In the present\nstudy, we adopted the moderately severe murine BCCA\nocclusion model to investigate effects of dietary\nSutherlandia and elderberry on I/R injury. BCCA occlu-\nsion for 30 min and followed by reperfusion for 3 days\nresulted in severe neuronal damage in the hippocampus,\nand sporadic cell death in the cortex as well as in the\nstriatal/thalamus/basal ganglion regions. Using digital\npathology and the 5-point scoring system on cresyl\nviolet-stained brain sections, the results demonstrated\ndietary Sutherlandia and elderberry significantly mitigate\nthe I/R-induced neuronal damage in all three brain\nregions.

In previous studies with the gerbil model, a 5-min\nBCCA occlusion followed by reperfusion for 4 days led\nto prominent activation of astrocytes and microglial\ncells around the hippocampal CA1 region, where pyr-\namidal neurons are extensively damaged (Wang et al.,\nstantially greater activation of microglial cells at 3 days\nafter a 30-min BCCA occlusion. The pattern of micro-\nglial cells activation reflects the areas where neurons are\ndamaged. Alteration in microglial cell morphology\ntoward the phagocytic form at this time after reperfu-\nsion is in agreement with the notion that microglia are\nactively responding to neuronal injury and cell death.\nThe observation that mice consuming the Sutherlandia\nor elderberry diets showed significantly less microglial\nactivation as compared with the ischemic brains of\nmice consuming control diet supports the capacity of\nthese diets to mitigate neuron damage and microglial\nactivation.\nWith the BCCA occlusion model, significant increase\nin astrocytes can be observed in the ischemic brain 3 days\nafter I/R. Unlike the focal ischemia model where exten-\nsive astrogliosis is found in the penumbral area, astro-\ncytes in the BCCA brain are more widespread in\ndifferent brain regions. Furthermore, there is no signifi-\ncant difference in GFAP immunoreactivity comparing\nischemic mice given the Sutherlandia or elderberry diets\nwith control diets. These results further demonstrate\neffects of Sutherlandia and elderberry to protect ischemic\ndamage through inhibiting neuron cell death and micro-\nglial cell activation. Although these results suggest an\nintimate relationship between neuronal damage and acti-\nvation of microglial cells, more studies are needed to\nbetter understand mode of communication between\nthese two cell types.\nIncrease in oxidative stress is an important factor in\nreperfusion injury; and several studies have implicated\nthe involvement of NADPH oxidase as an important\nsource of ROS (Chen et al., 2009; Yoshioka et al.,\n2011a). Although mechanisms for ROS produced by\nNADPH oxidase in neurons and glial cells are not well\nunderstood, our and other's studies (Brennan et al., 2009)\ndemonstrated rapid production of ROS in primary neu-\nrons (minutes) on stimulation by the ionotropic glutam-\nate receptor agonist (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid, NMDA;\nShelat et al., 2008); however, production of ROS in\nmicroglial cells follows a delayed process in hours\n(Chuang et al., 2013). When botanicals such as honokiol\nand Sutherlandia extract were used to test antioxidative\neffect on neurons (stimulated with NMDA) and\nmicroglial cells (stimulated with LPS), neurons were\nmore sensitive to the antioxidative action than microglial\nNADPH oxidase in ROS production in neurons was\ndemonstrated by using neurons from p47phox-deficient\nmice, which showed diminished response to ROS produc-\ntion in response to excitotoxic agents (Brennan et al.,\n2009). In the mouse model of global cerebral ischemia,\nan increase in p47phox immunoreactivity was observed in\nmouse striatum 3 days after I/R (Yoshioka et al., 2011a).\nIn the present study, we further localize the I/R-induced\nincrease in p47phox immunoreactivity to microglial cells.\nAgain, the significantly lower expression of p47phox\nimmunoreactivity in mice given the Sutherlandia and\nelderberry diets as compared with that given the control\ndiet is in agreement with the observation of decreased\nmicroglia activation.\nIt has been reported that I/R stimulates activation of\nMAPK pathways, in particular, the p38 MAPK and the\nRas/MEK signaling (Nito et al., 2008), which are attrib-\nuted to activation of the aquaporin-4 channel responsible\nfor astrocyte swelling (Nito et al., 2012). Other studies\nalso demonstrated upregulation of the MAPK/ERK1/2\npathway in brain after stroke (Sawe et al., 2008; Yenari\nimportant member of the MAPK family capable of med-\niating a range of cellular responses, including motility,\ninflammation, and cell survival as well as cell death\n(Sawe et al., 2008). In our recent study with microglial\ncells, IFNg not only stimulates the canonical Janus\nkinase-Signal Transducer and Activator of\nTranscription (JAK-STAT) pathway but also the\nMAPK/ERK1/2 pathway, and in turn, phospho-ERK1/\n2 is linked to activation of a number of cytoplasmic pro-\nteins including p47phox of NADPH oxidase for ROS and\ninducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) for nitric oxide\n(NO) production (Chuang et al., 2013). Subsequently,\nIFNg-induced NO and ROS production pin a dose-\ndependent manner (Chuang et al., 2013). Our recent\nstudy also demonstrated the capacity of Sutherlandia\nextracts to inhibit IFNg-induced phospho-ERK1/2 and\nsubsequently mitigate ROS and NO production in micro-\nglial cells (Jiang et al., 2014). Botanical polyphenols, for\nexample, the active ingredient of green tea, epigallocate-\nchin-3-gallate, also attenuates NO production through\ndownregulation of ERK1/2-associated proteins including\nALDH2, ANXA1, and LGALS1 in LPS-stimulated BV-2\nmicroglial cells (Qu et al., 2014). Other studies also dem-\nonstrate a critical role of the MAPK/ERK pathway in\nneuron excitation (Simon et al., 1984) and MEK/ERK\ninhibitors mitigating brain damage in the stroke model\nof this study further support the important role of phos-\npho-ERK1/2 expression in microglial cells after I/R, and\nsuppression in mice fed diets supplemented with\nSutherlandia and elderberry.\nBecause Sutherlandia is widely used in southern\nAfrica for symptoms of HIV/AIDS and elderberry diet-\nary supplements are among top selling products in\nEurope and North America, these studies provide\nnew insights into use of these herbs as neuroprotective\nagents. In summary, we have demonstrated significant\nprotective effects of dietary elderberry and Sutherlandia\nagainst global cerebral ischemia-induced functional\nmotor deficits and neuropathological changes, including\nneuronal cell death and microglial activation.\nResults further support the hypotheses that these\nbotanicals exert beneficial effects against ischemic\ndamage through suppression of oxidative and proin-\nflammatory pathways in neurons and microglial cells.\nThis study provides strong rationale to further investi-\ngate the active components and mechanisms of action\nand to determine whether their consumption amelior-\nates ischemic damage as well as neurodegenerative\ndiseases.\nSummary\nThis study demonstrates that Sutherlandia and American\nelderberry botanicals ameliorate ischemia/reperfusion\n(stroke)-induced behavioral dysfunction, neuronal\ndamage, and oxidative stress and inflammatory responses\nin microglial cells.\nAuthor Contributions\nJ.
