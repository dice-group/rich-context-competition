Phytoestrogens with the highest mean urinary levels were enterolactone (512 ng/ml), daidzein (317 ng/\nml), and genistein (129 ng/ml). In serum, the concentrations were much less and the relative order was reversed, with genistein having the highest mean\nlevel (4.7 ng/ml), followed by daidzein (3.9 ng/ml) and enterolactone (3.6 ng/ml). Highly significant correlations of phytoestrogen levels in urine and\nserum samples from the same persons were observed for enterolactone, enterodiol, genistein, and daidzein.

Introduction\nDecreased risks for heart disease and cancer are associated\nwith certain diets. This protective effect may result from\ndietary micronutrients, macronutrients, biologically active\nnon-nutrients, or a combination of these and other factors.\nThe human diet contains a complex array of naturally\noccurring bioactive compounds called phytochemicals.\nAmong these phytochemicals are phytoestrogens, a broad\ngroup of plant-derived compounds of nonsteroidal structure\nthat can mimic estrogen. The largest dietary dosage of\nphytoestrogenic activity results from two classes of com-\npounds: lignans and isoflavones. These groups modulate\nmany biologically relevant processes, including sex hormone\nintracellular enzyme levels (Adlercreutz et al., 1993), protein\nsynthesis, malignant cell proliferation, cellular differentiation\nAlthough the physiologic relevance of some of these proper-\nties is questionable, consumption of foods rich in phytoestro-\ngens is associated with significantly reduced risk for cancer,\nosteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and severity of meno-\nAdditionally, certain lignans (Saarinen et al., 2001) and\nisoflavones reduce carcinogen-induced cancer in laboratory\nanimals (Lamartiniere et al., 1995a, b).\nAlthough considerable health benefits are associated with\ndiets rich in phytoestrogens, little information is available\nabout the actual phytoestrogen concentrations in the general\nUS population. Phytoestrogen excretion in urine varies with\nthe type of diet (Adlercreutz et al., 1986; Hutchins et al.,\ninclude whole grains, flax, and some fruits and vegetables.\nIsoflavone diets consist primarily of legumes, such as\nsoybeans and soy-based products (Adlercreutz et al., 1991;\nphytoestrogens are ingested in their natural beta-glycosidic\nforms, which are hydrolyzed to their aglycones in the\nintestine, absorbed, and then glucuronidated in the intestinal\nwall. The major circulating forms of the isoflavones are the\nglucuronidated metabolites, and the glucuronidated forms\nalso predominate in the urine (Setchell et al., 2001). The half-\n1.

The largest reported phytoestrogen\nexposure assessment study measured urinary levels of\nphytoestrogens in an ethnically diverse population of 50\nyoung women in one geographic area, the San Francisco Bay\nArea (Horn-Ross et al., 1997). We measured the serum and\nurinary levels of the lignans (matairesinol, enterolactone, and\nenterodiol); isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, O-desmethylan-\ngolensin (O-DMA), and equol); and coumestrol (in urine\nonly) in a larger and more geographically diverse US\npopulation of adults of different race/ethnicity and both\ngenders with different dietary habits.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy subjects\nUrine and serum samples were obtained from a subset of\nsamples from adult participants of the Third National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), 1988\u00ad\n1994. This subset was chosen at random from individuals\nwho volunteered to give an extra blood and urine sample.\nThe samples were taken at various times of the day and do\nnot represent fasting samples. This population subset was not\ndesigned to be representative of the US population but rather\nto serve as a reference range group of civilian, noninstitutio-\nThe gender distribution was 61% female. Race/ethnicity of\nthese samples was as follows: non-Hispanic white 29%; non-\nHispanic black 43%; Mexican American 23%; and other\n5%. The paired urine and serum samples from 66 people\nwere simply based on the availability of samples for which we\nhad adequate volume of both matrices.\nMethod\nsamples were analyzed for phytoestrogens using solid-phase\nextraction (SPE) followed by HPLC and tandem mass\nspectrometry, as previously described (Valenti\u00b4n-Blasini et al.,\ncollection. Genistein, coumestrol, and daidzein were pur-\nchased from Indofine Chemical (Somerville, NJ, USA). The\nremaining phytoestrogens and the labeled phytoestrogens,\nexcept for daidzein, were purchased from Professor Kristina\nWa\n\u00a8 ha\n\u00a8 la\n\u00a8 of the University of Helsinki, Finland; daidzein was\npurchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover,\nMA, USA). All samples were spiked with a mixture of stable\nisotope labeled internal standards, isotopic purity: ([2H6\n]-\n]-\n]-O-DMA,\n]-genistein, 90%), and\ndeconjugation internal standards (4-methylumbelliferone\nglucuronide and 4-methylumbelliferone sulfate, Sigma Che-\nmical, St. Louis, MO, USA). Serum was diluted and\nbuffered with ammonium acetate (1 ml of 250 mM, pH 5).\nConjugated analytes were hydrolyzed by the addition of b\u00ad\nglucuronidase/sulfatase (Helix pomatia, H-1, Sigma Chemi-\ncal) and incubated overnight at 371C. Serum deconjugated\nsamples were extracted with Oasis HLB SPE (60 mg HLB,\n3 ml, Waters Scientific, Beverly, MA), and urine samples\n120 mm pore size); the concentrated extract was resuspended\nin mobile phase. The phytoestrogens in the extracted samples\nwere separated by reversed-phase HPLC (50 mm Prism\ncolumn, Keystone Scientific, Bellafonte, PA, USA) and\nmeasured by tandem mass spectrometry (Sciex API III,\nPerkin-Elmer Sciex Instruments, Wellesley, MA, USA) using\nheated nebulizer atmospheric pressure chemical ionization in\nthe negative ion mode.\nUrinary concentrations of the phytoestrogens are reported\nas nanograms of phytoestrogen per milliliter of urine (ng/ml)\nand as micrograms of phytoestrogens per gram of urinary\ncreatinine (mg/g); serum concentrations are reported as ng/\nml. Quality control samples (spiked serum or urine) and\nstandards were analyzed along with unknown samples. To\ndiminish the high degree of skewness of the data, the\nconcentrations (mg/g creatinine) were graphed using a\nlogarithmic scale. Geometric means were determined with\nthe values corrected by urinary creatinine concentrations.\nFor statistical purposes, nondetectable values were treated as\nthe limit of detection divided by two (LOD/2). Detection\nlimits were in the low ng/ml (Valenti\u00b4n-Blasini et al., 2000).\nStatistical analysis of the correlation of each of the\nphytoestrogen concentrations in urine and serum from the\nsame individuals was performed using a Spearman's rank\ncorrelation analysis. Multivariate statistical analysis (annual\nincome, education, age, ethnicity, rural or urban residence,\nand gender) was accomplished using PROC GLM in SAS\n(SAS User's Guide: Statistics, 1982 Edition.

For comparisons among the various\ndemographic factors, the urinary creatinine-adjusted data\nwere log transformed because the data were not normally\ndistributed, but were right-skewed.\nWithin our reference range population, we observed the\nhighest levels of phytoestrogens in non-Hispanic whites, with\nthe exception of matairesinol being found highest in non-\nHispanic blacks. Statistically significant differences among\nethnic groups were observed only for equol (p \u00bc 0.0001) and\nmatairesinol (p \u00bc 0.019). For equol, the levels were signifi-\ncantly higher in non-Hispanic whites followed by non-\nHispanic blacks (p \u00bc 0.0002). For matairesinol, the levels\nwere significantly higher in non-Hispanic blacks than in\nData analysis regarding urinary levels of lignans revealed\nseveral statistically significant findings. The lignans present in\nhighest urinary concentrations, enterolactone, and entero-\ndiol, showed significant interaction with income, gender, and\nage. For enterolactone, data analysis showed a significant\ninteraction (p \u00bc 0.046) between gender and income, and a\nnominally significant interaction (p \u00bc 0.0646) between educa-\ntion and income. For males with 12 or fewer years of\neducation, enterolactone urinary levels decreased proportion-\nally with increasing income; conversely, for females with 12\nor fewer years of education, enterolactone levels increased\nproportionally with increasing income. For males with more\nthan 12 years of education, enterolactone levels increased\nproportionally with increasing income, but at half the rate of\nfemales with more than 12 years of education. Data analysis\nfor enterodiol showed that the levels of enterodiol increase as\nincome increases. Similar to the enterolactone data, the\nincrease is much larger for females than for males and also\nmuch larger for persons living in urban areas, compared to\nthose living in rural areas. The enterodiol levels increase\nfor persons with more than 12 years of education but not\nfor persons with 12 or fewer years of education.

Matairesinol showed significant\ninteraction between education and residence. On average,\nurban subjects with 12 or fewer years of education had higher\nlevels than urban subjects with more education, but the\nreverse was true for rural residents.\nData analysis on isoflavone levels provided far fewer\nsignificant findings. In fact, the major isoflavones, daidzein\nand genistein, showed no significant correlations with any of\nthe demographic variables examined.

Table 3 summarizes the Spearman\ncoefficients obtained for the concentrations of different\nphytoestrogens in urine and serum samples taken from the\nsame 66 individuals.\nDiscussion\nWe report urinary and serum concentrations of selected\nphytoestrogens in this NHANES III subset of adults living in\nthe US. Previous studies have reported urinary and serum\nphytoestrogens levels for various populations. Most of these\nstudies focused on populations of specific ethnic groups,\ndietary habits and/or gender, and with a low number of\nsubjects (Herman et al., 1995). Even though our results do\nnot represent the composition of the general population, our\nreported values are from a diverse adult US population, a\nbroader population base than previous studies. Of the eight\nphytoestrogens we measured, the highest arithmetic mean\nurinary levels were observed for enterolactone (512 ng/ml),\nThe finding of enterolactone having the highest levels in this\nsubsample is consistent with a general US diet that is higher\nin whole grains or cereals than in soybean sources of\nphytoestrogens. The large difference in the concentrations of\nthese phytoestrogens between the 75th percentile and the\nmaximum levels is probably due to a relatively small number\nof people taking food supplements containing these phytoes-\ntrogens or having a dietary intake with very high concentra-\ntions of them. Owing to the skewness of the data, it may\nbe more important to estimate the general population by\nexamining the geometric means or medians (50th percentile)\n(Table 1), which both decrease in the same order as the\nmeans. In the case of coumestrol, only nine urine samples\nhad detectable amounts suggesting a very low dietary\nexposure to this phytoestrogen.\nTo compare our urinary phytoestrogen results with those\nof previous studies, we transformed the geometric mean\nvalues (mg/g creatinine) to similar units used in these studies\nTable 2.

Assuming an average excretion amount per day\nfor creatinine of 2.145 g, the values were converted to mmol/\nday (Diem and Geigy, 1962). Levels of the lignan\nenterolactone (1.04 mmol/day) were similar to the published\nlevels for Latina women in the San Francisco Bay Area\n(SFBA) study (Horn-Ross et al., 1997) and for Japanese\nOn the other hand, they were approximately two times lower\nthan published levels reported in omnivorous US and\nFinnish women. Levels of enterodiol (0.16 mmol/day) were\nsimilar to those found in post-menopausal omnivorous and\nlacto-ovovegetarian US women but were two to three times\nlower than for Japanese men and women. The enterodiol\nlevels were two times higher than in Latina women in the\nSFBA study but four times lower than in white SFBA\nwomen. The levels were similar to the levels for persons\nconsuming a soy experimental diet that was high in\nisoflavones and low in lignans (Kirkman et al., 1995).\nFor the isoflavone, genistein (0.22 mmol/day), the levels\nwere two times higher than in persons exposed to a\ncarotenoid or cruciferous experimental diet and six times\nlower than those eating a soy diet. The carotenoid diet and\ncruciferous diet correspond to a diet with a higher intake of\nlignans and minimum amount of isoflavones. The levels\nobtained in our population reflect a diet with a low isoflavone\nexposure. When compared with the SFBA study, the levels\nwere similar to white US women but three times lower than\nin Latina and four times higher than in African-American\nwomen. For daidzein (0.49 mmol/day), similar values have\nbeen observed for vegetarian Finnish women and SFBA\nLatina women. The levels were higher than levels reported\nfor a carotenoid experimental diet but lower than a\ncruciferous diet. The levels were dramatically lower than\nreported for a soy diet. For example, Japanese women\nconsuming approximately 16 and 30 mg/day of daidzein,\nof each of these isoflavones in their urine (Arai et al., 2000).\nFor O-DMA (0.049 mmol/day) the levels were similar to\nJapanese in the SFBA; two times higher than in white in\nSFBA, Helsinki, and Boston omnivorous women; two times\nlower than in vegetarians in Boston; and nine times lower\nthan macrobiotics in the same study. Compared with a soy\nexperimental diet, the levels of O-DMA in our population\nwere seven times lower. The relation between the dose and\nurinary excretion is linear for many of the phytoestrogens\nmeasured, except for equol (Karr et al., 1997). Since\nexcretory half-lives are reported to be in the range of 3\u00ad\nconsumption.\nIn general, in our study the concentrations for lignans\ncorrelate with levels reported for other populations, while the\nisoflavone concentrations in our study reflect a diet low in\nisoflavones. If we compare our population subset in terms of\nthe different ethnic groups with a study also conducted in the\nUS, the SFBA study, the following is observed. In our study,\nthe levels of the isoflavones found in non-Hispanic whites\n(n \u00bc 55) were two to five times higher, while the levels of the\nlignans were three times lower than in the SFBA population\ngroup (n \u00bc 15). For non-Hispanic blacks (n \u00bc 83), the\nisoflavones in our subset were two to five times higher while\nthe lignans were two times lower. For Mexican Americans\n(n \u00bc 45), the reverse is observed: the lignans were one to two\ntimes higher in our group, but the isoflavones, genistein and\ndaidzein, were two to three times lower. O-Desmethylango-\nlensin was consistently higher in our population subset; in\nparticular, Mexican Americans had three times higher levels\nthan the Latina group (n \u00bc 15) in the SFBA study.\nThe geometric mean concentrations in our study were\nobtained from an ethnically diverse population, representing\na broad distribution of dietary habits, ages, incomes, and\nresidences that could explain possible differences between the\nvalues. Most of the differences within population could be\nattributed to different dietary habits. Other factors could\ncontribute to the observed differences, such as basal diet\ncomposition, phytoestrogen content of plant foods or food\nproducts consumed by residents of different geographic\nareas, as well as cultural differences in food composition,\npreparation and consumption. Factors other than dietary\nintake, such as metabolism by intestinal bacteria, endogenous\nhormones, and antibiotic use also influence phytoestrogens'\nexcretion (Adlercreutz et al., 1986). Gut absorption of\nphytoestrogens is influenced by the composition of gut\nmicroflora, which is influenced by dietary habits, and it could\ndiffer between two persons eating the same diet (Knight and\nEden, 1996). For example, some persons cannot metabolize\ndaidzein to equol, resulting in a low equol excretion.\nDaidzein metabolism to equol varies considerably among\npeople and is influenced by other dietary components, such\nas carbohydrate intake. High carbohydrate intake leads to\nhigher production of equol than does low carbohydrate\nintake (Setchell and Cassidy, 1999; Bennetau-Pelissero et al.,\n2000). In the NHANES III population, variables like this\ncould not be assessed, which could contribute additional\ninformation to the interpretation of differences between\ndifferent populations and possibly add insight in the broad\nvariability observed. However, we did observe that the ratio\nof daidzein to equol urinary levels was less in Mexican\nAmericans (5.7) and non-Hispanic whites (6.4) compared to\nnon-Hispanic blacks (13.2), suggesting lesser conversion of\ndaidzein to equol in the latter population. We also observed\nthat for all ethnic groups, the ratios of enterodiol to\nenterolactone, which can interconvert, were less than 1. This\nfinding of higher excretion amounts of enterolactone is in\nagreement with other human studies (Adlercreutz et al.,\nmarginally higher levels of enterodiol and lower levels of\nenterolactone, while the opposite was true for males.\nDifferences might be related to variations in the composition\nUrinary and serum phytoestrogens levels in reference populations\nValenti\u00b4n-Blasini et al.\nof the colonic bacteria affecting the further oxidation of\nenterodiol to enterolactone or to a higher intake of\nenterodiol. Similar results were observed in a study of lignan\nand isoflavonoid urinary excretion in men and women\nconsuming the same diets (Kirkman et al., 1995).\nThe concentrations of the phytoestrogens were much lower\nin serum than in urine (Tables 1 and 2), which points to the\nfast clearance of these chemicals from the body. In addition,\na higher number of samples had nondetectable concentra-\ntions in serum than urine. For matairesinol and equol,\nnondetectable concentrations were obtained for most of the\nserum samples. Detectable levels of equol in serum have been\nreported in previous studies, but the reported values were\nbelow our method's limit of detection (Adlercreutz\nof the blood sample is an important variable for the\ndetermination of phytoestrogens because of their short half-\nlives (King and Bursill, 1998). NHANES III obtained\nsamples from the subjects without consideration of elapsed\ntime after meals.\nThe range of levels in serum for the multiethnic population\ncovers one to three orders of magnitude depending on the\nanalyte. The highest mean level of 4.7 ng/ml was observed for\ngenistein, followed by daidzein with 3.9 ng/ml, and enter-\nolactone with 3.6 ng/ml. When compared with other\npopulations, total isoflavone concentrations, except for\nequol, were approximately two to five times higher than the\nvalues reported for omnivorous Finnish women, and two to\nthree times lower than levels observed for vegetarian Finnish\nwomen. For lignans in our study, enterolactone was\napproximately three times lower, and enterodiol was two\ntimes higher than the values reported for omnivorous Finnish\nHighly significant correlations of the levels in serum and\nurine were observed in the 66 people with matched serum and\nurine samples for daidzein, enterodiol, enterolactone, and\ngenistein (Table 3). All Spearman correlation coefficients\nwere significantly different from zero (p \u00bc 0.0001, except for\nO-DMA p \u00bc 0.0007). Since the method was not adequately\nsensitive for detecting equol and matairesinol in serum, these\nlevels could not be compared with urinary levels. The high\ncorrelations between urine and serum levels for the other\nmeasured phytoestrogens suggest that urine levels can be used\nto assess phytoestrogen human exposure without the need for\ninvasive phlebotomy, especially in cases where it is difficult to\nobtain a blood sample, for example, infant exposure studies.\nThe values reported here provide a reference range for a\nmultiethnic adult US population. The differences in phy-\ntoestrogen levels between ethnic groups might be largely\ninfluenced by differences in dietary intake and/or metabo-\nlism. The high correlation observed for urinary and serum\nlevels validates that noninvasive collection techniques, such as\nthose used for urine, can be used to assess phytoestrogen\nexposure. The assessment of phytoestrogen exposure in large\npopulations will help elucidate the potential role of\nphytoestrogens in protecting against hormone-dependent\ndiseases. This study increases insight into the actual dietary\nexposure to these biologically active compounds in the US\npopulation.\n"
