    "abstract": "Abstract\nSpirituality is important when caring for the whole human being. Earlier research found Love in connectedness to be a core\ncategory in spirituality. The study aim is to deepen our understanding of Love in connectedness, and contribute to the theoretical\nknowledge development of the concept of spirituality from a caring science perspective. The method was a review of 20\nresearch articles concerning connectedness and love, which were interpreted through a Gadamerian-based hermeneutical\napproach. Emerging themes were three forms of connectedness, compassion, and the risk of losing love in caring for the\npatient. In addition, we reflected on love and ethics, based on the writings of Tillich. According to Tillich, love is a drive\ntoward unity of the separated. This drive can be seen in both connectedness with others, in connectedness with something larger\nthan oneself, and may indirectly apply to connectedness with oneself. We find that both connectedness and love are key concepts\nin caring for the patient.\n",

Through concepts, the\ntheoretical structures of nursing may become visible, and\nthis knowledge may as well guide observations and nursing\nAccording to Meleis (1992), nursing theory development\nis important and may contribute with knowledge that is rel-\nevant for many health care professions. Within caring sci-\nence, knowledge development is of significance to all\npersonnel involved in caring for the patients and their next of\nkin. However, nursing theory development should be elabo-\nrated within the structure of an explicit framework (Cody,\n1999). The theoretical basis for our research is the humanis-\ntic tradition of caring science and the caritative caring theory\nof Eriksson (Lindstr\u00f6m, Lindholm, & Zetterlund, 2010). In\ncaring science, the human being is viewed as an indivisible\nentity of body, mind, and spirit (Eriksson, 2002). It is essen-\ntial in caring to include the spiritual dimension so that the\npatient may feel whole as a human being, and this may be\nviewed as a premise for dignity and health (Eriksson, 2002;\nLindstr\u00f6m et al., 2010). The basic motive for caring is cari-\ntas, and caring implies alleviation of suffering in charity,\nlove, faith, and hope (Lindstr\u00f6m et al., 2010). As stated by\nR\u00e5holm and Lindholm (1999), caritative caring ethics means\nbeing there and confirming the patients' dignity, which is\nseen as a manifestation of the love that \"just exists.\"\nThis study focuses on spirituality, and there is compelling\nevidence supporting spiritual care as a force in health and\nAlthough the concept of spirituality and the provision of\nspiritual care are recognized as fundamental aspects of nurs-\ning care, it is however challenging to incorporate spiritual\nthe perspective from which spirituality is investigated is of\nimportance (Florczak, 2010). Earlier research in light of car-\ning science found Love in connectedness to be a core cate-\ngory in spirituality (Rykkje, Eriksson, & R\u00e5holm, 2011).\nLove in connectedness concerns the presence of a\ntranscendent or universal love, which can be viewed as a\n1\u00c5bo Akademi University, Vasa, Finland\n2Stord/Haugesund University College, Norway\n3Sogn og Fjordane University College, F\u00f8rde, Norway\nCorresponding Author:\nLinda Rykkje, Department of Nursing, Stord/Haugesund University\nEmail: linda.rykkje@hsh.no\nLove in Connectedness: A Theoretical\nStudy\nLinda Rykkje1,2, Katie Eriksson1, and Maj-Britt R\u00e5holm3\n Keywords\nconnectedness, compassion, love, spirituality\n2 SAGE Open\npower and a potential health resource. Love is a motivator\nand the \"glue\" that enables human beings to form durable\nconnections with their inner space, others, community,\nHigher Powers, and nature. Love in connectedness motivates\nspiritual thoughts and actions, and provides inner strength.\nUniversal love is present in caring relationships and concrete\ncaring acts, presented by phenomena of both receiving and\ngiving love. Inherent in love is compassion, concern, being\nseen, and being confirmed (Rykkje et al., 2011).\nThe study aim is to deepen our understanding of Love in\nconnectedness, and thereby to contribute to the theoretical\nknowledge development of the concept of spirituality from a\ncaring science perspective.\nMethod\nThere are different ways to contribute to theory develop-\nment, and the development of qualitatively derived concepts\nand theories is challenging (Morse, Hupcey, Penrod, &\nMitcham, 2002). We chose to perform a review of research\narticles pertaining to care, and to explore connectedness and\nlove separately. Reviews may be the basis of theory develop-\nment because of the potential to integrate research findings\ninto broader theoretical accounts of the investigated topic\n(Kirkevold, 1997). To deepen the understanding of Love in\nconnectedness, we chose also to reflect on some philosophi-\ncal issues regarding love and ethics, based on the writings of\nthe theologian and philosopher Tillich.\nSelecting Literature\nSearches in CINAHL and Medline were conducted during\nMarch\u00adSeptember 2013, and some articles were found by\nexploring cited references. Inclusion criteria were as follows:\n(a) Connectedness or love was found in the abstract or was\ncentral in the article, and (b) the theoretical perspective of the\narticle was relevant to caring science, and our research aim.\nAfter reading the abstracts, 17 and 23 articles about connect-\nedness and love, respectively, were selected for further read-\ning. Nine articles about connectedness and 11 articles about\nlove were found to be the most relevant, and thus included in\nthe final analysis. Table 1 presents an overview of the\narticles.\nInterpretation\nWith the purpose of gaining a deeper insight into the meaning\nof connectedness and love in relation to caring science, the\narticles were interpreted through a Gadamerian-based herme-\nneutical approach. According to Gadamer (2004), under-\nstanding is always interpretation, and involves applying the\ntext to be understood to the interpreter's present situation.\nThus, to support the trustworthiness of the analysis, it was\nimportant to clarify the study's horizon of understanding and\nthe theoretical framework from the start. The hermeneutical\nreading was a search for meaning through the dialectic\nmovement of interpretation and understanding of the parts in\nrelation to the whole, and the chosen theoretical framework\n(Eriksson & Lindstr\u00f6m, 2007). Then, the essential features\nof the text were placed into preliminary themes. In this pro-\ncess, the first author drafted the preliminary findings, and the\ninterpretation was then commented on by the co-authors in\nseveral rounds of dialogues. The major themes that emerged\nwere three basic forms of connectedness, compassion, and\nthe risk of losing love in caring for the patient.\nWe find, in agreement with Gadamer, that there cannot be\nan understanding free of all prejudice. Hermeneutical read-\ning and interpretation involve application, \"so that a person\nreading a text is himself part of the meaning he apprehends\"\nto reflect the main findings against the study's theoretical\nhorizon.\nFindings and Reflections\nFirst, we portray findings regarding connectedness and love\nthrough reflective summaries, and then we reflect on the\nfindings in light of Tillich's view of love. In addition, we\nreflect on how Love in connectedness may deepen our under-\nstanding of human spirituality, in relation to patient care.\nConnectedness\nThe selected articles portray connectedness as a concept of\ngreat significance inherent in human spirituality. Burkhardt\n(1994) describes spirituality as a unifying force permeating\nall of life, a force expressed in one's being, in one's knowing,\nand in one's doing, and manifested through one's becoming\nand connecting. Register and Herman (2010) portray being\nspiritually connected as one major category of connected-\nness, whereas Pesut (2008) claims that connectedness is an\nimportant aspect of spirituality. Bellingham, Cohen, Jones,\nand Spaniol (1989) point out that connectedness and spiritual\nhealth are vitally and integrally related.\nConnectedness is described by Register and Herman\n(2010) as an ultimate expression of human existence that\ncomes from within and determines how people engage in the\nworld. Furthermore, connectedness concerns the growth\nthrough and toward relationships, both inside and beyond\noneself, and may be understood as the extent to which a\nhuman being experiences shared and meaningful relation-\nship, and engage life in meaningful, positive, and purposeful\nScharer, 2010). Connectedness is also a central feature in the\nconcept of self-transcendence, as found in human develop-\nment or maturity based on enhanced awareness of the world\naround us, and an orientation toward broader perspectives\nabout life. Teixera (2008) views the essence of self-transcen-\ndence as the capacity to connect with self, others, the uni-\nverse, and beyond. Self-transcendence may foster peace,\nRykkje et al. 3\nTable 1.

(continued)\n6 SAGE Open\noneself may result in self-alienation, which is linked to cul-\ntural norms of \"going it alone\" that may lead to increased\nisolation. One example is from the American society: The\nmore persons fulfill their commitment to individualism,\ncompetition, and independence, the more they become dis-\nconnected, bored, and lonely (Bellingham et al., 1989). We\nreflect on the importance of being in balance and in touch\nwith one's inner space as human beings, and if not, the self-\nalienation can be experienced as spiritual suffering.\nYounger's (1995) starting point is that suffering affects an\nindividual's sense of community and connectedness with\nothers. Transcendence is considered the most powerful way\nin which human beings are restored to connectedness and\nwholeness after an injury. Suffering may bring closer a\ntranspersonal source of meaning, which locates the human\nbeing in a far larger landscape (Younger, 1995). Our reflec-\ntion is that suffering may be the result of losing connected-\nness with oneself; however, there are many forms of\nsuffering. Other research support that suffering may trigger\nspiritual awakening or a search for the greater answers in\nlife, which may lead to peacefulness (R\u00e5holm & Eriksson,\nThe reestablishing of connectedness may include soli-\ntude. Furthermore, Younger (1995) refers to Tillich, stating\nthat estrangement is part of life and the step immediately pre-\nceding connectedness is solitude. Solitude is being alone but\nnot lonely, sensing the eternal presence that includes every-\nbody and everything from which we are separated. Just being\nwith oneself gives opportunities of thoughtfulness, creativ-\nity, and rest. Sources of solitude can be nature, poetry, music,\nor pictures (Younger, 1995). Solitude can easily become\nloneliness if it obscures connectedness. However, solitude or\ndisconnectedness does not equate loneliness, because loneli-\nness implies a longing or anxious, painful yearning for some-\none or something (Bellingham et al., 1989). We reflect on\nthat the process of finding meaning is somewhat a lonely\njourney, meaning that the person's inner search requires\n\"quiet moments\" in solitude (R\u00e5holm & Eriksson, 2001).\nSolitude as a means for spiritual search should not be mis-\ntaken as loneliness.\nConnectedness with others.Connectedness with others may\ninclude loved ones, particularly family, friends, or acquain-\ntances, as well as the society or culture (Bellingham et al.,\nis a sense of membership and belonging in the human com-\nmunity, of recognizing unity between self and others, that is,\na sense of being part of a group, a country, or even the world\n(Younger, 1995). Being connected with others necessitates\ncreating a space that people can visit and a willingness to\ncome out of that space to visit others (Bellingham et al.,\nPhillips-Salimi, Haase, and Kooken (2012) aimed to clar-\nify the concept of connectedness in social relationships.\nAttributes of connectedness are caring, being affectionate\ntoward others, experiencing warmth from others, and dis-\nplaying concern for the well-being of others. Respect, feeling\nvalued, and/or displaying value for others are also important\nattributes. Connectedness also implies reciprocity, mutual\naffection, and interest that people have in one another. Based\non these attributes, connectedness is the degree to which a\nperson perceives that he or she has a close, intimate, mean-\ningful, and significant relationship with another person or\ngroup of people. This perception is characterized by positive\nexpressions that are both received and reciprocated, either by\nthe person or between people, through affective and consis-\ntent social interactions (Phillips-Salimi et al., 2012). Our\nreflection is that connectedness with others is expressed\nthrough caring acts of both receiving and giving, and such\nconnectedness can contribute to confirm the individuals'\nConnectedness with something larger than oneself.Connected-\nness is being at one with timelessness and a sense of being in\ntouch with the eternal, of being a part of something that is\ngreater than oneself (Younger, 1995). It can be connected-\nness with the environment (Register & Herman, 2010; Teix-\nIt can also be connectedness with a larger meaning or pur-\npose, that is, an Ultimate Other--God or Higher Power/\n2008) or with a power or divine being that does not need to\nbe limited to God, or a universal consciousness (Pesut, 2008;\nRegister & Herman, 2010). Being connected to something\nlarger than oneself or one's surroundings is perceived as a\nbasic human need and necessitates having a profound pur-\npose in life. Purpose can be equated to meaning, direction,\nmission, or duty; it is a person's larger goal (Bellingham et\nBellingham et al. (1989) believe that emptiness and mean-\ninglessness may result in anxiety. These authors refer to\nTillich who relates anxiety to the loss of an ultimate concern,\nof a meaning, which gives meaning to all meanings. This\nanxiety is aroused by the loss of a spiritual center, and of\nanswers to the question of the meaning of existence. Being\nconnected to something larger requires being an active par-\nticipant in the creative aspects of life. Losing connectedness\nwith one's guiding principles may bring feelings of perva-\nsive dread or boredom (Bellingham et al., 1989). Thus, we\nreflect on that loosing connectedness with a larger meaning\nmay result in spiritual suffering.\nLove\nDuring the hermeneutical interpretation of the articles, we\nfound love as a key concept in caring for the patient.\nHowever, there are many forms of love and different under-\nstandings of this concept. In the English language, love is\nRykkje et al. 7\noften misunderstood as sexual desire, whereas the classical\nGreek language distinguishes between the love that is Eros\nand that of Agape. Moreover, the word charity, which\ndescribes both the state of and the manifestation of love\nthrough caring for another, is often reduced in contemporary\nnotions to organizational activities (Stickley & Freshwater,\n2002). In this article, we focus on Eriksson's notion of cari-\ntas, which means human love, compassion, and charity, man-\nifested through caring for others (Lindstr\u00f6m et al., 2010).\nBased on the emerging themes from the selected articles, we\ncenter our reflections on compassion and the risk of losing\nlove in caring for the patient. In addition, we reflect on love\nand ethics based on the writings of Tillich.\nCompassion. Love in the form of compassion for the suffer-\ning human being is an idea that has shaped caring for hun-\ndreds of years (Thorkildsen, Eriksson, & R\u00e5holm, 2013).\nVon Dietze and Orb (2000) claim that the English word com-\npassion has been used since the 14th century, and is derived\nfrom the Latin com (together with) and pati (to suffer), liter-\nary to suffer with. They find that although compassion may\ncontain or require emotion, it also holds the notion of delib-\nerate altruistic participation in another person's suffering.\nHence, our reflection is that compassionate care is quite rel-\nevant in relation to connectedness with others.\nCompassion embraces more than emotions, and concerns\nthe ways we relate to other people and demands that we act\n(Von Dietze & Orb, 2000). The nature of compassion sug-\ngests that caregivers are able to provide attentiveness, listen-\ning, confronting, involvement, helping, presence, and\nunderstanding in relations with patients (van der Cingel,\n2011). Von Dietze and Orb point out that empathy can put a\ndistance between the nurse and the patient, whereas compas-\nsion implies that there is a deeper level of participation in the\nsuffering of the other. Compassion deliberately seeks to\navoid paternalistic care and is not to be misunderstood as\npity (Von Dietze & Orb, 2000). Although both pity and com-\npassion are used to refer to an emotion that indicates a feel-\ning of being sorry, feeling sorry in pity victimizes a patient\nand evokes powerlessness (van der Cingel, 2011). Von Dietze\nand Orb (2000) states that compassionate care is not \"sim-\nplistically about taking away another person's pain or suffer-\ning, but is about entering into that person's experience so as\nto share their burden in solidarity with them and hence\nenabling them to retain their independence and dignity\" (p.\n169). Compassion may represent an internalized motivation\nfor doing good, which impels and empowers people to not\nonly acknowledge but also act toward alleviating another\nhuman being's suffering or pain (Schantz, 2007). Love is an\nethical act, and compassion is a mutual experience given two\nor more people who act together for its realization\n(Thorkildsen et al., 2013). We assume that compassion is a\nprerequisite for experiencing connectedness with others, not\nonly in caring relations but also in all meaningful relation-\nships between human beings.\nThe risk of losing love. Several authors are concerned about\nhow love seemingly has lean times in patient care. The arti-\ncles point to how love or compassion in some contexts may\nsound threatening and unprofessional, and that to care with\nlove has been considered subservient and of inferior value in\ncaring for the patient, a weakness, or even a taboo subject\nVon Dietze & Orb, 2000; Wahlin, Wieslander, & Fridlund,\n1995). Western-style health care systems are critiqued for\nlimiting professional caring and loving possibilities, leaving\ncaregivers who love in the practice of caring to go beyond\nthe role definition of the duty of care (Fitzgerald & van\nHooft, 2000). Consequently, the lack of love is causing the\nintuitive and natural part of life to get lost. Altruistically\nmotivated caregivers are said to take responsibility and being\nsupportive because they feel love, concern, and responsibil-\nity for the other person (Sand, Olsson, & Strang, 2010).\nHowever, the innocent altruism and desire to genuinely care\nfor people in need are challenged by the attitudes of perhaps\nmore cynical colleagues and governments requesting patient\ninvolvement without providing adequate resources. Love is\ndiscrete and modest, appreciated in the silence of a genuinely\ncaring relationship. This means that rewards of loving are\ninvisible, and nurses may even fear reprisals for demonstra-\ntion of love (Stickley & Freshwater, 2002).\nStraughair (2012) claims that today, in the profession of\nnursing, some of the ethos of the compassionate nursing\ncharacter is seemingly lost in favor of technical skills based\ntoo heavily on evidence-based practice. The religious origin\nof compassion, since Nightingale formed her ideals for the\nprofessional nurse, has been challenged in contemporary\nhealth care. This is supported by evidence suggesting that\nnurses have a decreased affinity with the ethos of altruism\nand reports from patients who experience lack of compas-\nsionate nursing care. According to Straughair (2012), there\nare forces to reendorse the concept of compassion as a core\nand fundamental nursing value, and restore the image of the\nnurse who responds to patients with humanity and kindness\nthrough high-quality compassionate care.\nWahlin et al. (1995) observe that the primary cause for\npain and distress is a lack of love, and that the path of coming\nto wholeness and healing is the ability to accept and give\nunconditional love. Where caregivers are genuinely con-\ncerned for the whole person, love is evident and the prospect\nfor healing increases (Stickley & Freshwater, 2002). Arman\nand Rehnsfeldt (2006) argue that the offering of unselfish\nloving care to someone explicates the core of the character of\nhuman beings. The ability to care originates in man's natural\nbehavior and encompasses the appreciation of both the giv-\ning and the receiving of loving care. The mediating force of\nlove has an ability to make connections, heal, and make\nwhole (Arman & Rehnsfeldt, 2006). Love as fundamental\nfor a being brings human beings in touch with themselves\nand enables binding to other people (Thorkildsen et al.,\n2013). Hence, our reflection is that love must be a fundament\n8 SAGE Open\nin connectedness with oneself as well as in connectedness\nwith others. Furthermore, movement and change are crucial\nqualities of love, and love has the capacity to move beyond\nthe limitations of an individual standpoint and surrender to a\ngreater reality. The experience of love can therefore bring\nabout a sense of moving toward greater harmony and unity\n(Kenny, 2011). Thus, it seems that love also is a fundament\nin connectedness with something greater than oneself.\nTillich's view of love.It is highly relevant to be concerned\nabout the lack of love in caring for the patients (Straughair,\nlosing love as an important ethical and ontological value, and\nfind that it is necessary to search for love's ontological basis.\nWe have chosen to reflect on Tillich's writings about love as\nan ontological concept. In our opinion, Tillich provides a\nmeaning of love that is consistent with the understanding that\nlove and connectedness are interrelated. In the book Love,\nPower, and Justice, Tillich (1954) elaborates on these three\nbasic concepts and their interrelated relationships. His con-\ncern is that none of these concepts can be understood in a\nbroad sense without an ontological analysis of their root\nmeaning. This means that one must ask about how these con-\ncepts are rooted in the nature of being as such. Bringing the\nfull potential of Tillich's text is not possible in this article,\nand we base our reflections on the ontological or root mean-\ning of the concept of love. Tillich reminds us that no human\nrelations exist in a void; there are contextual structures\nbehind all encounters. Perhaps what is most interesting in\nTillich's text is how he brings the ontological root meaning\nof the concepts together with the concepts of concrete and\ncontextual meaning in personal encounters.\nTillich (1954) believes love is a driving force and a con-\nstitutive element of life, as being in actuality. This is the\nontological nature of love. He states that love is \"the drive\ntowards the unity of the separated\" (p. 39). Tillich argues that\nthe central core in being is love as a driving force toward\nunity of that which originally have been units, but that have\nbeen separated. There is no question of uniting the strange,\nbut a reunion of the estranged. Alienation presupposes origi-\nnal unity, and love's greatest power is where it overcomes the\nseparation that makes us independent individuals. Our reflec-\ntion is that this can be understood from a perspective in\nwhich human beings are part of the infinite universe, and that\nall people are \"one.\" It can be viewed as an experience of\nunity with something universal that we all belong to, and this\nis consistent with connectedness with something greater than\nourselves.\nLove, according to Tillich (1954), is a constitutional ele-\nment in life itself, and the individual is separated and at the\nsame time carries the most powerful love. This is reminiscent\nof Watson (2003) who points out that our human existence is\ngrounded in love for each other. Love overcomes the separa-\ntion between people, although without separation, neither\nlove nor life itself can exist (Tillich, 1954). This is, however,\na necessary contrast whereby the individual is preserved as a\nself-centered self in person-to-person relationships, and at\nthe same time, the reunion with others in love is actualized.\nOur reflection is that love reunites individual persons, and as\nsuch, love must be part of connectedness with others.\nTillich (1954) points out that love involves passion and\nemotion. Love as an emotion may ontologically be viewed as\nthe expectation about reunion that takes place in every rela-\ntion based on love. Although love involves more than just\nemotions, there is no love without the emotional element. He\nexplains that the human movement against the other\nexpresses itself in emotional ways. A prerequisite for love's\nemotions is the separation of the self-centered self, which is\nseen in the human ability to relate oneself as an \"I\" to a\n\"thou.\" Thus, the human being can be preserved as both a\nsubject and an object of love. At the same time, Tillich points\nout that people also have an innate propensity to continue to\nexist and enhance themselves, an intrinsic motivation toward\na fulfillment of oneself through union with others. Thus,\nthere is an element of passion and desire in man, in the sense\nof self-fulfillment of one's own potential. Tillich claims that\nlove as a desire can be understood from its ontological basis.\nHe is opposed to desire only for pleasure, but points out that\nall living beings strive for fulfillment of their desires. This\nprocess in life is wrongly understood if it means that life\nessentially consists of fleeing from pain and striving for plea-\nsure. However, desire, according to Tillich, is a normal drive\ntoward vital self-fulfillment, and desire is a true quality in\nany love relation. Both the intimate and romantic love called\neros and the love of family and friends called philia are\nunited with the desire of love in the meaning of vital self-\nfulfillment (not pleasure). Furthermore, Tillich views self-\nlove as a metaphor that in itself cannot bring meaning if love\nis the drive toward reunion of the separated. He finds that\nself-love could be replaced by three different and contradic-\ntory senses: in the sense of natural self-affirmation, in the\nsense of selfishness, and in the sense of self-acceptance,\naccording to the given context. Our reflection according to\nthis is that love also is a fundament in connectedness with\noneself.\nTillich (1954) believes that the concept of love also has a\nstrong ethical character, and states that it is love that shows\nwhat is just in the concrete situation. The relationship\nbetween justice and love in personal encounters is described\nby three functions for creative justice: listening, giving, and\nforgiveness. No human relationship is possible without\nmutual listening. The other calls on us and urges us to listen,\nand understanding the other's intrinsic claims and justice of\nbeing can only be given through the love that listens.\nListening love is the first step toward justice in person-to-\nperson encounters. Giving as an expression of creative jus-\ntice serves the purpose of reuniting love, and it belongs to the\nright of anyone we encounter to demand something from us,\nat least the minimum of acknowledging the other as a person.\nForgiving is a paradoxical form in which justice is united\nRykkje et al. 9\nwith love. To forgive unjust actions is a fulfillment of justice\nbecause it is the only way to reunite those who are estranged\nby guilt. Without reconciliation, there can be no reunion\n(Tillich, 1954). We reflect on love's ethical character as an\nimportant basis for compassionate patient care, and this we\nwill elaborate further in the next section.\nReflections of Love in Connectedness\nThis article attempts to explore how Love in connectedness\nmay deepen our understanding of human spirituality. In this\nsection, we elaborate further on how love and connectedness\nmay be interrelated and work together as a life-giving force\nSpirituality is considered an inner strength and a potential\nwe believe that Love in connectedness is a powerful resource\ninherent in human spirituality. In light of Tillich (1954), one\ncan describe love as the moving power of life. In this article,\nwe have tried to portray love as a vital part in spirituality and\nconnectedness. Mok, Wong, and Wong (2010) found in their\nstudy about spirituality that receiving and giving love in rela-\ntionships and connectedness are part of finding meaning in\nlife. Thus, we suggest that love may be a force that can alle-\nviate spiritual suffering caused by meaninglessness and emp-\ntiness, as described by Bellingham et al. (1989). According\nto Kenny (2011), there is a quality of spontaneity within love\nthat creates the conditions for mind and body to become\nmore integrated. Love as a life-giving force comprises move-\nment and a restoring power (R\u00e5holm & Eriksson, 2001). It\ncan seem that love is a vital force both in connectedness with\nothers and in feeling like a whole human being.\nArman and Rehnsfeldt (2006) claim that if love is seen as\nthe ontological basis for caring and ethical acts, then caregiv-\ners' practices and expressions of love can enhance the\npatient's understanding of life as well as give relief to their\nsuffering. In this regard, Tillich's reflections about the onto-\nlogical meaning of love may provide insights into how love\ncan be a creative force in caring for the patient. Love is\nviewed as the drive toward unity of the separated, and we\nfind that this drive can be seen in both connectedness with\nothers, and in connectedness with something larger than\noneself. It might not straightforwardly apply to connected-\nness with oneself, although Tillich (1954) points out that love\nof oneself may be described by self-affirmation and\nself-acceptance.\nPerhaps the most intriguing about Tillich's (1954) point of\nview is the ethical function of love in personal encounters.\nSomehow, love is both a force in creating relations between\nthe caregiver and the patient, and the ethical guide to caring\nactions through creative listening, giving, and forgiving. We\nbelieve love is present in caring relationships and concrete\ncaring acts (Rykkje et al., 2011). The literature on love is,\nhowever, concerned about a lack of compassionate care for\nthe patient. Von Dietze and Orb (2000) claim that compas-\nsion involves moral choices, and that it requires shared\nexperiences and actions. We find this to be in line with the\nnotion of connectedness with others, meaning that the care-\ngiver may touch the patient through genuine concern and\ncompassionate care. According to Schantz (2007), the power\nof compassion in promoting healing lies in the health person-\nnel's development of a relationship of confidence and trust\nwith the patient. Our reflection is that love as a reuniting\nforce (Tillich, 1954) should be present in all caring\nrelationships.\nThe Relevance for Clinical Practice\nWe would like to highlight how the power of love can pro-\nvide a confirmation of the individuals' worth in clinical\npractice; however, love should include both giving and\nreceiving. Family members supporting patients in palliative\ncare reported about deepened relationships and increased\nawareness about life values (Sand et al., 2010). Acts of\ngoodness and compassion may provide a sense of dignity,\ngrowth, and an inner feeling of joy or pleasure because one\nfeels like a \"better\" human being (Arman & Rehnsfeldt,\n2006). Spirituality may manifest itself and grow when the\npatients experience both receiving and giving love, as found\nin fulfillment of duties and in service to others or a God\n(R\u00e5holm & Eriksson, 2001). To maintain human dignity,\none important duty in life is to be able to serve or to be there\nfor another human being (Eriksson, 2001). Compassionate\ncare is in the light of our own research, rooted in dignity in\nterms of being \"valuable\" meaning that the patient experi-\nence being of importance for others, and that others show\nthat the patient does mean something for them. Thus, we\nsuggest that Love in connectedness in caring for the patient\nis about relationships built on mutual love. This is part of the\nvery foundation of loving care, that there is a reciprocity in\nthe relationship between the patient and the caregiver\n(Rykkje et al., 2011). Staff must be involved so that love\nreunites by enabling the patient to both give and receive\ncompassionate care. Hence, the caregiver must make room\nso that the patient can also give others loving care, and not\njust be a care recipient.\nAccording to Eriksson (1997), professional caregivers\nshould be able to recognize and meet the individual patient's\nspiritual needs. Therefore, health professionals must have\nknowledge about spirituality and awareness for the spiritual\ndimension in life. Caring for the whole human being presup-\nposes that we understand and confirm the patient's spiritual-\nity (Lindstr\u00f6m et al., 2010). To care for the patient's spirit is\nimportant to maintain human dignity, and therefore, it may\nbe viewed as an ethical obligation. We would like to portray\nspiritual care as to listening to the patient in caring relation-\nships of true presence, and trying to understand the situation\nfrom the patients' point of view. Compassionate care, just\nbeing there, and confirming the patients' dignity (R\u00e5holm &\nLindholm, 1999) may foster the patients' spiritual develop-\nment and enable them to feel whole as human beings\nClosing Reflections\nTillich puts forward that love is unity, and as such, it is the\nmoving power of life. We find that both connectedness and\nlove are key concepts in caring for the patient. Connectedness\nis found to be central in spirituality, and the literature sup-\nports that love understood as compassion is relational and\nthus fundamental in connectedness. Bringing these concepts\ntogether in the category Love in connectedness has provided\na deeper understanding of how love is a life-giving force in\nspirituality. We also view Love in connectedness as a resource\nin the patients'becoming in health, and in the maintenance of\nhuman dignity.\nAuthors' Note\nThe first author conducted the search for articles.
