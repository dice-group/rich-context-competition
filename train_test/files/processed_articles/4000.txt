The work of Sigmund Loland is typ-\nical in this regard (Loland, 1999, 2001). These insights into equality of opportunity\nin sport resonate with the work of contemporary political philosophers on the com-\npetition for scarce jobs and positions in society (see, for example, Fishkin 1983;\nto understand what makes sporting competitions fair the aforementioned theory of\nequality of opportunity does not suffice. It is no less important to consider what\nis at stake in competitions in terms of their prize structures. The crude choice is\nbetween a winner-takes-all prize structure, in which the competitor who finishes\nfirst in the competition gets everything while the losers get nothing, and a losers-\nget-something prize structure, in which there are prizes for first place, second place,\nthird place, and so on, competitors.1\nThere may well be important instrumental reasons to favour losers-get-something\nprize structures over winner-takes-all prize structures. One such reason begins from the\nrealisation that ideals of fair competition are seldom fully satisfied in practice given the\nproblems of background inequality, hidden procedural unfairness and human errors in\nadjudication.2 So ensuring that even losers receive something can be a way of mitigat-\ning various forms of unfairness relating to inequalities of opportunity that are a com-\nmon and perhaps inevitable feature of actual competitions, sporting or otherwise.3 The\nproblem with this reason, however, is that it makes the case for broadening the spread\nof prizes between winners and losers of derivative importance. A fairer prize structure\nis depicted as a remedy for unequal opportunity and not as a fundamental issue of con-\ncern in its own right.\nThe main aims of this article, therefore, are threefold: first, to make the case that\nsporting prize structures matter in their own right from the perspective of fairness; sec-\nond, to add precision to the general idea that for many sporting competitions losers-get-\nsomething prize structures provide greater stakes fairness than winner-takes-all prize\nstructures by identifying a range of governing principles of stakes fairness; third, to\nestablish a mechanism for pairing up appropriate principles of stakes fairness with given\nsporting competitions. My argument shall proceed as follows. I start by fleshing out the\nidea of stakes fairness, being careful to distinguish three different aspects of the idea.\nFollowing on from that I identify a range of principles of stakes fairness (ten in total)\nthat could be used to regulate sporting prize structures. I then address the questions of\nthe justification and appropriateness of such principles for sporting competitions. Specif-\nically, drawing on existing theories of the point and purpose of competition in general, I\nidentify various different types of rationale for holding sporting competitions in partic-\nular and I try to demonstrate how these rationales can provide a useful guide for match-\ning appropriate principles of stakes fairness to given sporting competitions. I then clarify\nand work through some of the implications of the method for a sample of real world con-\ntroversies over sporting prize structures. I also seek to refine the method in response to\ntwo possible objections from indeterminacy and relativism. Finally, I compare and con-\ntrast my conclusions with more general philosophical debates about justice.\nThe idea of stakes fairness\nThe term `stakes fairness' was coined by Lesley Jacobs in his book Pursuing Equal\nOpportunities: The Theory and Practice of Egalitarian Justice (Jacobs, 2004).\nEquality of opportunity is, I suggest, an ideal for the normative regulation of competitions\nthat distribute valuable opportunities in society. It is possible to distinguish three dimen-\nsions of fairness that might guide this regulation. Procedural fairness reflects a concern\nwith the basic rules of procedure that guide a competition, including the determination of\nthe winners. Background fairness reflects a concern that there be a level playing field for\nall competitors. Stakes fairness focuses on the prizes or what is at stake in the competition.\n[ . . . ] My three-dimensional model of equal opportunities as a regulative ideal is innovative\nbecause it adds the dimension of stakes fairness. (Jacobs, 2004: 4)\nStakes fairness reflects a concern with the distribution of benefits and burdens within a com-\npetition. The issue here is with whether it is fair to have, for instance, a winner-take-all\nIn fact, Jacobs goes on to explain that stakes fairness has three distinct aspects. First,\nthere is a concern with `the fairness of the effect or outcome within the sphere of com-\npetition' (Jacobs, 2004: 44). This is a matter of how the prize structure marks the differ-\nence between winning and losing or, in a more fine-grained way, between first place,\nsecond place, and so on, such as whether the winner takes all or whether the losers also\nget something and how much. Second, there is a concern with `limiting the effects of one\ncompetition on another' (Jacobs, 2004: 43). This echoes Michael Walzer's principle of\n`complex equality', which is designed to secure the autonomy of different spheres of dis-\ntribution.4 Third, there is a concern with `how much is at stake in a given competition'\n(Jacobs 2004: 43) or, more specifically, `the concern that there should be constraints on\nthe risks that participants in competitions are exposed to' (Jacobs, 2010: 257). Expecting\nprofessional boxers to fight bare knuckle and for an unlimited number of rounds, for\ninstance, would seem to make the stakes too high in terms of risk to life and limb.\nJacobs insists that it is the first aspect `that is at the very core of stakes fairness'\n(Jacobs, 2004: 44), and so it will be my central focus here. According to Jacobs, achiev-\ning core stakes fairness depends on `promoting a wide distribution of benefits' (Jacobs,\nit is the norm for professional boxers to share the prize, the difference between the winner\nand loser being their proportion of the prize. This example expresses the insight that winner-\ntake-all stakes for competitive opportunities are rarely fair. (Jacobs, 2004: 38)\nNorms of stakes fairness are not limited to sporting competitions. Jacobs argues that\nequal pay legislation `remedies a form of stakes unfairness women experience in the\nlabour market' (Jacobs, 2004: 208). Workfare schemes `are capable of addressing the\nstakes unfairness of labour market competition with regard to job assets' (Jacobs,\n2004: 164). Widening opportunities to provide and perform medical and legal services\nwithout a university degree neutralises what would otherwise be the stakes unfairness\nof winner-takes-all competitions for scarce places at law and medical schools (Jacobs,\nof divorce settlements do not get everything while the losers get nothing (Jacobs,\n2004: 16). Although this article is mainly about sporting competitions, I shall return\nto some of these wider issues of distributive or social justice in the final section.\nDespite Jacobs' illustrations, however, what constitutes a `wide distribution' of ben-\nefits remains vague. As John Baker puts it, `[i]f stakes fairness really matters, we surely\nneed a clearer account of what it is' (Baker, 2004; see also Voorhoeve, 2005; Brown,\n2008). In a more recent article applying his ideas to the field of educational policy Jacobs\noffers the following response to the imprecision objection.\nIn my view, the imprecision objection stems from mistaken expectations about an equal\nopportunities approach that functions as a regulative ideal. The distinction I have in mind\nis between educational policy and an ideal that regulates that policy. The ideal sets the para-\nmeters on that policy, but within those parameters it does not specify the content of the pol-\nicy. From this perspective, a three-dimensional equal opportunities approach through the\nlens of procedural, background and stakes fairness sets the parameters on the objectives\nof educational policy and how they can be pursued. The imprecision objection is grounded\non mistaken expectations in the sense that it seeks, from a regulative ideal, precise answers\nNevertheless, Jacobs underestimates what is required for something to operate as an\neffective and, therefore, adequate regulative ideal. It is true that a regulative ideal is not\nthe same as a set of rules that when applied to the facts deliver complete, determinate\nanswers to detailed policy questions. But in order to set the parameters on the objectives\nof policies a regulative ideal must be more than a mere idea; it must also be a principle.\nAccording to Jacobs, the core idea of stakes fairness reflects a concern with widening\nthe distribution of good outcomes within competition prize structures and the putative\ninsight that winner-takes-all prize structures are rarely fair. However, this idea is not yet\nan adequate regulative ideal, since it does not provide parameters that guide the forma-\ntion of policy with regards to how wide the distribution of good outcomes should be and\nsheds no light on the rare cases when winner-takes-all prize structures are fair. What is\nrequired here is a principle or set of principles of stakes fairness that can act as a govern-\ning standard to be met for particular competitions. I aim to add this specificity to the phi-\nlosophy of stakes fairness.\nThe principles of stakes fairness to be discussed in this article are regulatory princi-\nples of justice in the sense that they specify normative governing standards or instru-\nments of assessment for sporting prize structures which in theory could be codified,\nimplemented or complied with by governing bodies, agents, promoters, tournament\ndirectors, and so on. In other words, regulatory principles of stakes fairness are con-\nceived so that they might guide and where necessary constrain institutions, rules and\npractices surrounding the design and implementation of actual sporting prize structures.5\nUnless otherwise stated I shall use the term `prize' to refer to the monetary rewards that\ncompetitors receive. The term `prize structure' will refer to how much of the available\nprize money goes to winners and losers respectively. I should stress, however, that the\nnotion of stakes fairness is not only applicable to prizes and prize structures in the narrow\nsenses with which this article is primarily concerned. Elite athletes are not motivated\nonly and simply by money but also by titles, prestige and plaudits. Whilst these things\ncan be difficult to quantify, they are also issues of stakes fairness. Furthermore, in the\ncase of multi-round competitions what is at stake in each round is not merely a monetary\nprize but also entry into the next round of competition.6\nPrinciples of stakes fairness in sport\nGiven the diverse range of sporting competitions which principles of stakes fairness might\nbe expected to regulate and the fact that the principles are intended to be bespoke for sport-\ning competitions, it is highly unlikely that a single principle of stakes fairness could appro-\npriately regulate all competitions. In what follows I shall identify ten principles in total. It\nshould be borne in mind from the outset that different principles may be appropriate for\ndifferent competitions, and that the list is intended to be instructive rather than exhaustive.\nWhen reflecting on the stakes fairness of sporting prize structures it may seem natural\nto start with principles that focus on the positions in which competitors are ranked at the\nend of the competition. I begin with the principle of stakes fairness that Jacobs rejects.\nThe Principle of Ranking-Based Winner-Takes-All. Whichever competitor is ranked in first\nplaceat the end ofthe competition shouldtakethe whole prize, while the losersreceive nothing.\nWhether or not one thinks that this principle is plausible in general terms,7 it only takes\na moment of reflection to see that relatively few actual sporting competitions conform\nstrictly to it. Across the diverse world of professional sports, from snooker to body-\nbuilding, competitors have more than just a single top prize for which they compete.\nI shall try to explain and justify why this should be the case in the section on `rationales\nfor sporting competition.\nBut by the same token, relatively few competitions operate under the terms of this\nalternative principle.\nThe Principle of Strict Equality. All competitors receive the same prize, irrespective of their\nranking as winners and losers and whether or not such a ranking is employed.\nThat is not to say that there are literally no competitions or games which adhere to this\nprinciple. The game of pin\n~ata played at children's parties or the Caucus Race in Lewis\nCarroll's Alice in Wonderland are possible examples. Rather, the point is that in the\nworld of professional sport the vast majority of prize structures operate somewhere\nbetween the extremes of winner-takes-all and winners-and-losers-get-the-same.\nOne typical principle is this.\nThe Principle of Ranking-Based Lexicality. Every competitor should receive a share of the\nprize pot, but whichever competitor is ranked in first place at the end of the competition\nshould take the largest share of the prize pot, the competitor who is ranked in second place\nshould take the second largest share of the prize pot, and so on.\nThis principle departs from the winner-takes-all model of prize structures in a par-\nticular way. It ensures that shares are staggered from the winner all the way down to\nthe competitor who finishes in last place. This principle seems apt for many of the\nworld's most famous and beloved professional sporting competitions: from the\nworld of team sports consider the Football Association (FA) Premier League in Eng-\nland and Wales or the Fe\n\u00b4de\n\u00b4ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) Formula One\nWorld Championship.\nHowever, not all governing bodies or individual tournaments that adopt or adhere to\nthe Principle of Ranking-Based Lexicality do so all the way down. From the world of\nindividual sports, consider the four Major Championships in golf. After two rounds the\nfield of competitors is split in two: those who `make the cut' continue on in the tourna-\nment and compete in the final two rounds; those who `miss the cut' are eliminated and\ntheir competition is over. For the players who do make the cut the prize structure is lex-\nical, whereas the players who miss the cut receive no prize money. For the purposes of\nthis article I shall treat this sort of bifurcated prize structure as exemplifying a sub-\ncategory of the Principle of Ranking-Based Lexicality. In such cases there may be a com-\ning together of different rationales that support this special, split strategy. I shall say\nmore about this later.\nIn addition to this, however, the Principle of Ranking-Based Lexicality has a feature\nthat could prevent it from being universally suitable for all sporting competitions. Put\nsimply, it may be insensitive to nuances surrounding the differing degrees of perfor-\nmance of the winners and losers. Imagine a governing body that brings together the\nworld's top eight exponents of its sport at the end of the season to compete in a\nknock-out tournament for a total prize fund of $5,000,000. The current principle permits\na prize structure according to which the winner receives $2,000,000, the runner-up\n$250,000. Under this prize structure the winner receives twice as much as the runner-\nup, the runner-up receives twice as much as the losing semi-finalists, and so on. Yet this\ncan seem unfair if it is not the case that the performance of the winner is twice as good as\nthat of the runner up, and so on.\nIn the light of this it might sometimes be more appropriate, all things considered, for\nprinciples of stakes fairness to reflect more closely the differing degrees of performance\nof the winners and losers during the competition, where the differing degrees of perfor-\nmance are based on doing better or worse along a set of dimensions that reflect the partic-\nular set of intricate skills associated with the sport. I leave it open whether doing better or\nworse is measured in absolute or relative terms. To this end, consider this further standard.\nThe Principle of Performance-Based Proportionality. All competitors should receive shares\nof the prize pot that are proportional to their differing degrees of performance.\nThis principle implies that the best performer may receive a prize that is larger than the\nsecond best performer's prize but not a prize that is disproportionate to the difference in\nperformance between the two. Only if the best performer actually performed twice as\nwell as the second best performer should they receive a prize that is twice as large.\nBecause this principle depends on information about actual performances, a tournament\norganisation that wished to adopt it would not be able to determine in advance how much\neach of the eventual winners and losers should receive. The distribution of prizes must be\nsettled after the competition based on actual performance. Here the prize structure might\nstart to resemble a complex system of performance-based bonuses. Nonetheless, the\ntournament organisation must set out its parameters beforehand \u00c0 for example, that if\na winner achieves performance indicators within a certain range or outperformed the\nloser by a certain amount, then a given prize will be awarded. The parameters might\ndraw upon customary sporting measures such as time, distance, height, weight, number\nof goals scored, points tallied, and so on.\nHowever, one drawback with the Principle of Performance-Based Proportionality is\nthat it overlooks something special about being the winner of a competition, regardless\nof the degree of performance. So there may be reason to favour this alternative.\nThe Principle of Winner-Weighted Performance-Based Proportionality. The winner of a\ncompetition may take a share of the prize pot that is disproportionate to his or her degree\nof performance.\nIn addition to this, the Principle of Performance-Based Proportionality is insensitive to\nthe special significance that might be attached to finishing in last place in a sporting com-\npetition. A society that has some special reason to reward glorious failure might adopt\nthis standard.\nThe Principle of Loser-Weighted Performance-Based Proportionality. The competitor who\nfinishes in last place at the end of a competition may take a share of the prize pot that is\ndisproportionate to his or her degree of performance.\nThis principle would permit a tournament organisation to give a significant prize even to\na competitor whose level of performance was very poor. At first glance, this principle\nwould appear to be antithetical to the spirit of competition; but, as I shall discuss later,\nsometimes there are particular rationales for rewarding the underdog.\nSo far I have assumed that the prize pot is not dependent on who is taking part in the com-\npetition. However, this is often not the case and this fact may have significant implications\nfor stakes fairness. To illustrate, Jacobs uses the example of professional boxing to explain\nthe nature of stakes fairness, but he misconstrues the prize structure involved. He writes this.\nIn, for instance, professional boxing, the stake is prize money. The practice is to have the\n($250,000). The justification typically is that this is fairer than a winner-take-all prize of\n$1,000,000. The dimension of fairness drawn upon here is what I mean by stakes fairness.\nWhilst it is the norm for professional boxers to share the prize money, typically in the\ncase of world championship and elimination fights this is not done on the basis of a split\nbetween winner and loser. For instance, Rule 2.12 of the World Boxing Council (WBC)\nRules and Regulations (`Division of Proceeds in a Purse Offer') states:\nThe net purse offer (after deduction of the WBC certification fees) shall be divided as\nfollows:\na) 70% for the champion and 30% for the challenger.\nb) 50% to each contender in the case of vacant titles or elimination bouts.\nc) 55% to the champion and 45% to the interim champion, in the event of such a bout.\nd) Notwithstanding the terms of subparagraphs a), b) and c) above, the Board of Governors\nmay, in its discretion and by a majority vote, modify the division of purse offer proceeds\nbetween boxers in a purse offer in unusual or special cases, like the consideration of the out-\nstanding marketing value of one of the boxers. The modification of the split will be limited\nrespectively, except in the most exceptional circumstances, in which the split may be mod-\nThe term `net purse' refers to the monies that are collected in box office and merchandise\nsales, television rights, endorsements and advertising deals, and so forth, minus the pro-\nmoter's cut and a myriad of other fees, taxes and expenditures relating to putting on the\nfight. The WBC rules regulate the terms of bout agreements and make it clear that the net\npurse should be split between champion and contender rather than winner and loser. This\nis to reflect the fact that in most instances the champion has greater marketing value than\nthe contender and so the champion is likely to contribute more to the net purse than the\ncontender. For example, at the WBC's annual convention in Cancun in November 2010\nit was agreed by the boxers involved, the promoter Don King and various other interested\nparties that the then WBC Heavyweight Champion, Vitali Klitschko, would face the win-\nner of a final eliminator contest between Ray Austin and Odlanier Solis on the basis that\nKlitschko would receive 70% of the net purse and either Austin or Solis would receive\n30%. This 70\u00ad30 split in favour of Klitschko reflected his greater marketing value as\nmeasured by the ratio between the average net purse of Klitschko's previous three fights\nand the average net purses of the two contenders' previous three fights.\nIn order to better understand what a more appropriate principle might look like it is\nuseful to draw a distinction between input stake and output stake. The input stake is the\nparticipant's contribution to the prize pot. In the case of boxing, a fighter's input stake is\nthe proportion of the net purse that is due to his appearance in the fight. The output stake,\nby contrast, is the amount which each participant stands to receive from the prize pot. In\nthe case of boxing this tends to be some fixed percentage of the net purse. The principles\nof stakes fairness identified above focus on the relationship between a competitor's rank\nor performance and his or her output stake. So, consider instead a principle that high-\nlights the relationship between a competitor's input stake and his or her output stake.\nThe Principle of Contribution-Based Proportionality. Each competitor should receive a\nprize that is proportionate to his or her contribution to the prize pot.\nAt this point the distinction between prizes and honours becomes relevant. In boxing the\nprize is the net purse, whilst the honour is the championship title or, in other instances,\nthe prestige of maintaining an undefeated record or simply the kudos of being the best\nfighter on the night.8 In the case of championship elimination bouts winning the right\nto fight for a title might be thought of as not quite a prize nor an honour but instead a\nvaluable opportunity. Whilst the Principle of Contribution-Based Proportionality may\nbe appropriate for regulating prizes, the Principle of Ranking-Based Winner-Takes-\nAll is perhaps more fitting for honours and valuable opportunities.\nAlthough the current principle has the merit of enabling competitors to receive in\nprize money an amount that is proportionate to what they directly or indirectly put into\nthe prize pot, it is also rather restrictive. Specifically, it removes an element of gambling-\nbased accumulation from sporting prize structures. In other words, it prevents someone\nfrom putting down a relatively small input stake in the hopes of gaining a much larger\noutput stake if he or she wins the competition. In the case of some professional sports\nor games, therefore, it may be more suitable to give competitors a chance of winning\nan output stake that far exceeds their input stake. Here the right principle might be this.\nThe Principle of Contribution-Based Winner-Weighted Proportionality. The winner of a\ncompetition may receive a prize that is disproportionate to his or her contribution to the\nprize pot.\nThen again, this principle opens the door to a scenario in which someone makes a pal-\ntry contribution to the prize pot but comes away with the lion's share. Although it may\nseem fair for winners to receive more than they contributed, it might be unfair if they\nonly contributed a negligible amount in the first place. So we may need a principle that\nprevents this sort of carpet-bagging. One such principles is this.\nThe Principle of Equity-Stake Contribution-Based Winner-Weighted Proportionality. The\nwinner of a competition may receive a prize that is disproportionate to his or her contribu-\ntion to the prize pot, but only if he or she has contributed an equal amount to the prize pot.\nBut perhaps this principle goes too far. Making it a requirement that persons con-\ntribute equal stakes in order to be entitled to win disproportionately large winning\nprizes places a barrier to entry for persons who are unable to match the stakes of other,\nwealthier entrants. This might be stakes fairness for certain competitions, but it raises\nconcerns over background unfairness. The Principle of Equity-Stake Contribution-\nBased Winner-Weighted Proportionality seems to be one that rich people could\nembrace as a way of keeping competitions to themselves.9 In the case of stakes horse-\nracing, for example, adopting this principle would lock out the least wealthy owners\nand trainers, preventing them from competing for the sorts of top prizes that would\nenable upwards mobility into the higher echelons of the sport. Background fairness,\nin the sense of a level playing field, would seem to imply that the winning prize should\nbe open to richer and poorer participants alike. Therefore, for the sake of overall fair-\nness we may need a principle that is sensitive to concerns about both the problem of\ncarpet-bagging and the problem of background unfairness. Thus bear in mind one final\nprinciple.\nThe Principle of Minimum-Stake Contribution-Based Winner-Weighted Proportionality. The\nwinner of a competition may take a prize that is disproportionate to his or her contribution to\nthe prize pot, but only if he or she has contributed a minimally adequate amount to the prize\npot.\nUp to this point I have explained the idea of stakes fairness in the context of sporting\nprize structures and differentiated ten principles of stakes fairness. In the next section\nI consider the justification and appropriateness of such principles. But before doing\nso, I should reiterate that the foregoing list of ten principles is intended to be illustrative\nrather than exhaustive. Some possible principles are left out. On a libertarian conception\nof fairness, for example, the `fair' prize structure is identical to whatever prize structure\nis mutually agreed upon by consenting adults and organisations absent coercion, fraud,\ncartels, and so on.10 However, this conception renders mysterious a good deal of the lan-\nguage that is used by sports writers and sports fans around the world and that can be\nfound in sports magazines and Internet discussion forums. For instance, in boxing it is\ncommonplace for people to question the fairness of actual as well as proposed purse\nsplits despite knowing that the splits have been contractually agreed. As such I do not\nintend to discuss it further in this article.\nJustification and appropriateness\nI begin with the question of justification. As with any principles of justice, the principles of\nstakes fairness cannot be taken for granted but must be supported by compelling reasons or\njustificatory arguments. Jacobs implies that his three-dimensional model of equal oppor-\ntunities could be arrived at and justified in the same way that John Rawls arrives at and\njustifies the Two Principles of Justice in A Theory of Justice, that is, through a process\nof `reflective equilibrium' (Jacobs, 2004: 39n.73). For Rawls, the aim of reflective equili-\nbrium is to find a coherence or `fit' between basic ideas found in the public political culture\nof a `well-ordered society', principles of justice that could regulate `the basic structure' of\nsuch a society, and considered judgements about justice in particular cases, where nothing\nlines, Jacobs (2004: 31\u00ad32) begins with what he calls `the principle of status equality'\n(`Status equality identifies a starting position \u00c0 the same status for each and no higher\nmoral standing possible \u00c0 in a competition that all individuals should enjoy') and then\ntries to develop a conception of justice for the regulation of various competitions for scarce\ngoods within civil society that reflects this principle and, moreover, that will conform to\n`widely held views' and `common sense' judgements about fairness (Jacobs, 2004: 39).\nAmong the views and judgements to which Jacobs appeals are the following.\nImagine, say, divorce settlements that were structured [as winner-take-all]. Most of us\nwould object that this is unfair because it is wrong to have the stakes so high; while it may\nbe acceptable to have the winner receive more benefits, it is unfair that the loser receive\nImagine a competitive Olympic sport such as figure skating. The stakes are familiar: the\ngold, silver and bronze medals. Three levels of medals entail a wider distribution than sim-\nply winner-take-all. The results of this competition conform to widely held views of stakes\nThere is much that could be said about Jacobs' appeal to considered judgements, but I\nshall limit myself to making three brief points. The first is that although it may be pos-\nsible to describe examples in which the judgement that winner-takes-all stakes are unfair\nseems plausible, there may be other examples where this is not the case. There are exam-\nples and there are examples. Consider the game of musical chairs, routinely played at\nchildren's parties. Few people complain that its prize structure is unfair, even though\nonly one child ends up with a prize. The same can be said of winner-takes-all poker tour-\nnaments. Just because winner-takes-all is rarely fair does not mean that it is never fair.\nSo, if no judgements are immune from revision, one would have to be sure that one is\nrevising the right judgements. This brings me to my second point. Whereas Rawls\nappeals to the theoretical device of `the original position' to show how it is possible\nto achieve reflective equilibrium between basic political ideas, principles of justice and\nconsidered judgements in particular cases,11 Jacobs provides no similar mechanism for\nconnecting together the abstract principle of status equality, the idea of stakes fairness\nand considered judgements in particular cases. Thus there is an open question about the\nnature of the connections which underpin any coherence that might be achieved. My\nthird point is that there are some important differences between Jacobs' examples.\nWhilst people tend to enter into sporting competitions consensually, whether for amuse-\nment (amateurs) or to make a living (professionals), people can be effectively entered\ninto divorce competitions without their consent; and they typically do so neither for amu-\nsement nor as careers (gold-diggers aside). So, different moral considerations may be\ndriving people's considered judgements in different cases, even if the generalised con-\nviction that winner-takes-all prize structures are rarely fair stays the same. I shall return\nlater to explain how I think reflective equilibrium might be better put to use.\nHaving briefly considered the problem of how the idea of stakes fairness might be\njustified, the next step is to figure out which particular principles of stakes fairness are\nappropriate for any given sporting competition. One could take two different approaches\nat this stage. The first abstracts from the competition in question and proceeds on the\nassumption that one of the above principles is the best principle of stakes fairness tout\ncourt. One just has to decide which principle that is and then having made this determi-\nnation find some way of applying the principle to whichever sporting competitions one\nhappens to be confronted with at any given time. In contrast to this, a second method\nbegins with reflection on the particular details and features of different sporting compe-\ntitions in order to try to pair up given competitions with appropriate principles of stakes\nfairness. In the context of his discussion of various competitions for scarce goods in civil\nsociety Jacobs adopts the second of these two approaches. In doing so he takes on board\nRawls' dictum that `the correct regulative principle for anything depends on the nature of\nCivil society is characterized by extensive diversity and plurality in the opportunities it\noffers. There appears to be no essentializing or defining feature of the institutions and prac-\ntices that make up civil society. Therefore, when egalitarians envision a regulative ideal for\ncivil society, it must be an ideal that is sensitive to this pluralism and diversity in opportu-\nnities. The shift from equal opportunity to equal opportunities meets this demand. In civil\nsociety, pursuing equality means focussing on particular institutions and practices and the\nopportunities they engender. Each extension of the three-dimensional model requires\nattending to the particular details and features of the individual competitions and involves\nHowever, it is one thing to say that in pairing up competitions with appropriate prin-\nciples of stakes fairness, or even pioneering new principles of stakes fairness for\nunusual competitions, we should be attending to the particular details and features\nof given competitions, it is quite another to explain which details and features we\nshould be attending to and why. Jacobs' account of stakes fairness is missing a method\nof connecting particular competitions to appropriate principles of stakes fairness. It is\nto this project that I now turn.\nRationales for sporting competition\nI believe that a useful method for connecting particular competitions to appropriate\nprinciples of stakes fairness is to explore the underlying point and purpose of the\ncompetitions in question. The basic thought is that if we can discern the rationales for\nholding different competitions then this should tell us something, or provide a basis\nfor reasonable inferences, about which particular principles of stakes fairness would\nbe appropriate for which particular competitions. This method is not to be confused\nwith Walzer's approach in Spheres of Justice, which looks further back to the social\nmeanings of the goods in question in order to identify whether or not a competition\nor some other distributive mechanism is appropriate for it (Walzer, 1983). That being\nsaid, sometimes in order to understand the rationale for a particular competition it will\nbe necessary to look into the social meaning of the benefit which it is designed to\ndistribute.\nNot surprisingly, there is a range of possible rationales for holding a competition; or,\nto be more exact, a range of ideal types of what competition is for. Jonathan Wolff enu-\nmerates one such list in his article, `The ethics of competition' (Wolff, 1998).12 Although\nit is not specifically designed with sporting competitions in mind, it does provide a plau-\nsible framework for thinking about sport.13 One type of rationale identified by Wolff has\nto do with what he calls `the side-effect of activity': `a competition is held for the exter-\nnal effects of people engaging in the activity that the competition draws out or\nencourages' (Wolff, 1998: 90). What principles of stakes fairness might be appropriate\nto such rationales? This question is made more difficult by the fact that the side-effect of\nactivity rationale is itself extremely varied. In examples of sports or games which\ninvolve soft competition, such as pin\n~ata or the Caucus Race, the competition is held for\nthe purposes of sharing out sweets or small toys amongst equally deserving people or for\nthe even more basic effect of giving everyone a good time. Here it would appear that the\nPrinciple of Strict Equality aptly serves the rationale.\nThe side-effect of activity rationale can also be seen in the world of professional sport,\nbut here the desired side-effect is much less altruistic. So, for example, when the govern-\ning bodies in tennis and snooker choose to hold increasing numbers of tournaments in\ndifferent parts of the world the driving motivation is to advance the profile of these sports\nor games internationally and to get more amateurs interested in playing and more\nspectators watching. The governing bodies also understand that the higher the quality of\ncompetition, the greater the public interest, and the greater the public interest the higher\nthe fees which can be commanded for the rights to broadcast the tournaments on televi-\nsion or through the Internet and the higher the revenues that can be obtained from spon-\nsorship deals. Over time the revenues generated by successful tournaments underpin\nthe prize funds to be shared among the competitors.14 The upshot is that the prize struc-\ntures must be designed to ensure various things: for example, that the best players are\nattracted to the tournaments; that once at the tournaments all the competitors are moti-\nvated to perform at their best so as to create the most thrilling spectacles possible; that\nthe less gifted players are still able to earn enough to maintain themselves on the tour,\nso that there is sufficient strength in depth in the professional sport or game to make a\nlarge number of tournaments worldwide economically viable. All of these things are\ninstrumental to achieving the overall side-effects of promoting the game and making\nmoney. Given these looked-for direct and indirect side-effects in tennis and snooker,\nwhat would be some appropriate principles of stakes fairness? Consider the Principle\nof Ranking-Based Lexicality. It requires that all competitors receive an amount for\nplaying in the first round and earn more the further they progress in the tournament.\nThe increments of prize money ensure that competitors are motivated to try as hard\nas possible to make it to the next round, meaning that spectators can enjoy fierce com-\npetition at every stage of the competition. But this prize structure also makes it possible\nfor a wide pool of players to make ends meet as professionals without ever progressing\nto the end of tournaments.\nThere is a related reason why many governing bodies and tournament directors\nsanction or actively endorse lexical prize structures rather than winner-takes-all prize\nstructures. For example, in order to remain solvent and in control of its professional\nsport a football governing body must serve the interests of the football clubs that it reg-\nulates, and these clubs in turn must satisfy the interests of their owners or shareholders.\nIt is unlikely that a winner-takes-all prize structure would be in the long-term interests\nof football clubs. The economists Robert Frank and Philip Cook provide a general rea-\nson \u00ad but one that is also applicable to the present example \u00ad why this should be the\ncase in their book, The Winner-Take-All Society (Frank and Cook, 1995). If there is\nonly one prize at stake, winner-takes-all competitions generate an irresistible incentive\non the part of every competitor to invest more money than the rival competitors in try-\ning to finish in first place. This creates a `positional arms race' in which competitors\ninvest ever larger amounts in order to come out on top. Ultimately they can reach a\npoint where their marginal investments are greater than the prize at stake and so what-\never happens they lose money. By adopting a prize structure that distributes money to\nwinners and losers on a lexical basis a football governing body encourages clubs to\nmake more efficient investments.15\nIn other professional sports, however, the side-effect of activity rationale for holding a\ncompetition may work slightly differently. In the case of professional golf, for example,\nthe prize structure in the Major Championships and in most large international tourna-\nments is bifurcated, meaning that only the players who make the cut gain access to the\nlexical prize structure, while those who miss the cut receive no prize money. Here the\nrationale of creating sporting drama points in the direction of ensuring that players in\nthe middle and at the bottom end of the field have the maximum possible incentive to\ncompete hard. With a very large field at the start of the tournament all players have to\ncome out in the first two rounds playing at their best. The very large field also enables\nthe tournament directors to invite a diverse range of players, from older, seasoned pro-\nfessionals to younger, up-and-coming players, from the colourful characters to the rel-\natively unknown players from the fastest growing golf economies \u00c0 all in an attempt to\nplease audiences and sponsors alike. Finally, there is an element of branding. Golf is a\nsport which seeks to portray an air of prestige and sporting excellence, both of which\nmay be incompatible with seemingly rewarding failure.\nTo give another example, for many competitors in international poker tournaments\nthe driving motivation is not to try to win back slightly more than the `buy in' or input\nstake (that is, a good chance of a small return) but to win big prize money (that is, a small\nchance of a large return). So what is special about some poker tournaments \u00c0 their\nunique selling point one might say \u00c0 is the extreme difference between the buy in and\nthe prize money. In such cases the rationale behind holding the competition is perfectly\ncompatible with and may even be predicated upon it being the case that virtually all of\nthe competitors will end up losing money and the whole competition encourages impru-\ndent investments. Therefore, the organisers of such tournaments may find the Principle\nof Ranking-Based Winner-Takes-All more appropriate than the Principle of Ranking-\nBased Lexicality.\nProfessional boxing operates differently again. Because the sport tends to be struc-\ntured around one-off events rather than routinised tournaments, the broadcasting and\nsponsorship deals that can be commanded by a promoter for any particular bout depend\ncrucially on the ability to predict with confidence how many spectators and viewers will\nbe attracted. Thus principles of stakes fairness are adopted in order to ensure not only\nthat competitors will take part but also that prizes structures themselves reflect the mar-\nketable value of the boxers. Here the desired side-effect of the activity favours the Prin-\nciple of Contribution-Based Proportionality. In the case of the `Rumble in the Jungle',\nfor instance, Muhammad Ali and George Foreman agreed to a 50\u00ad50 split in the purse,\nmeaning that they would each receive $5,000,000, win or lose. This was the split that\nDon King needed to put on the table in order to tempt each of the fighters to risk their\nrecords, reputations and future marketable value.\nThe side effect of activity rationale may work in yet another way in the case of stakes\nhorseracing, where some or all of the prize pot on offer is made up of the `entry fees' or\ninput stakes put up by the owners of the horses. As in poker, part of the motivation for\nentering a horserace is to take a gamble; but it is also about the prestige and sheer enjoy-\nment that comes from owning a racehorse. Without something like this motivation few\npeople would be willing to bear the very high costs associated with keeping, training\nand racing horses. The rationale for organising stakes races is to make money both by\nenabling racehorse owners to fulfil their motivations and by attracting audiences, cor-\nporate sponsorship, bookmakers, and so on. Much of this points in the direction of the\nPrinciple of Contribution-Based Winner-Weighted Proportionality. That being said, it\nis also in the interests of entrants to prevent carpet-baggers from making virtually no\ncontribution to the prize pot whilst retaining the same opportunity to walk away with\nthe top prizes. At the same time, the organisers may have a reason to ensure that the\nbarriers to entry into the competition, including the entry fees required to compete, are\nnot such as to exclude all but the very wealthiest competitors, thus making for fewer\nrunners and riders. This elitism may be appropriate in some instances, but not if\nthe organisers are trying to capture the imagination of the grass roots of the racing fra-\nternity. So, reflecting the aim of achieving the widest field of participants possible\nwhilst at the same time guarding against carpet-bagging, the Principle of Minimum-\nStake Contribution-Based Winner-Weighted Proportionality may be apposite.\nA second type of rationale for holding a competition focuses on `activity enhance-\nment': `a competition for a prize is presented as a way of enhancing an activity already\nthought valuable in itself' (Wolff, 1998). Consider the skill of archery, which during the\nElizabethan period (1558\u00ad1603) was one of the most popular pastimes, practised at all\nlevels of English society. Practicing the skill of archery was deemed to be of great impor-\ntance to the country because it meant that ordinary citizens could be called upon with\ngreater confidence in times of war. Making a tournament out of the skill, including\nbestowing prizes upon the most skilled archers, was thus a way of enhancing an activity\nalready thought valuable in itself. Indeed, during this time a law was passed which\nrequired Englishmen to practice the sport of archery (Singman, 1995: 155).\nA third type of rationale for holding a competition is to achieve what Wolff terms a\n`weighted lottery': `the competition is arranged so that someone who achieves best on\na scale designed to reflect some underlying trait will be awarded the scarce resource'\n(Wolff, 1998: 90). This is not a `pure lottery' in the sense of an allocation of a scarce\nresource which reflects only chance, where success or failure does not, and is not meant\nto, reflect any underlying trait or ability. Instead the competition is weighted such that\na certain trait or ability tends to be rewarded. However, there is still an element of\nchance, in the sense that results are not solely determined by the trait or ability and the\nresults on the day cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.16 In his article, `Sport\nand justice' Loland provides an interpretation of sport that exemplifies this rationale\n(Loland, 2007). According to Loland, sport's ostensible goal is to measure, compare\nand rank competitors according to their performances. If this is true, then it may lend\nsupport to both the Principle of Ranking-Based Lexicality and the Principle of\nPerformance-Based Proportionality.\nA fourth type of rationale for holding a competition is to achieve or promote `pure\ncompetition': `competitive behaviour is considered desirable in itself, and so turns an\nactivity of no value in itself into something of value' (Wolff, 1998: 90). If the rationale\nfor holding a sporting competition is simply for the sake of competition, the question\narises as to which principle of stakes fairness would be appropriate. Presumably it is\nwhichever principle best reflects or promotes the spirit of competition and this, of course,\nis something that is likely to attract a different social meaning at different times and in\ndifferent places. Sporting competition has always been adopted and co-opted by people\nwho imbue it, intentionally or unintentionally, with particular meanings \u00c0 meanings that\nresonate with core aspects of their culture (values, beliefs, traditions, and so on) includ-\ning in some cases grandiose hopes and dreams about the standing of their society in the\nworld. It might be central to the meaning of pure competition in the USA, say, that win-\nning is crucial to competing. This culturally-specific attitude is summed up in the words\nof the highly successful American football coach, Vince Lombardi (after whom the\nSuper Bowl trophy is named), `Winning isn't everything \u00ad it is the only thing'. Or con-\nsider the catch-phrase of Dale Earnhardt, the NASCAR driver who won seven champion-\nships, `Second place is just the first place loser'. The emphasis placed on winning may be\nso great that it becomes appropriate to adopt the Principle of Ranking-Based Winner-\nTakes-All.\nHowever, the ideal of pure competition can also have very different implications. In\nsome professional sports certain benefits are distributed to teams in reverse order based\non the previous season's win\u00adloss records, with the team achieving the worst record\nreceiving the top benefit. Consider the system used by the National Football League\n(NFL) in American football to allocate valuable college draft picks. The team with the\nworst record is given the first pick in each round, the team with the second-worst record\nthe second pick, and so on, down to the winning team of the previous year's Super Bowl,\nwhich receives the last pick in each round. Here the rationale is a kind of forward-\nlooking pure competition: a deliberate attempt to level the playing field and improve the\nquality of competition during the next season. In this way the stakes fairness of one com-\npetition merges into the background fairness of another. Of course, the NFL also pays\nprize money to successful teams on the basis of Ranking-Based Lexicality. This has\nenabled certain franchises to build dynasties of prolonged success despite the draft han-\ndicap. Compare the Pittsburgh Steelers, who have won more Super Bowls \u00ad six \u00ad than\nany other team, despite having only received first pick in the draft on three occasions\nsince its inception in 1936, and the Cleveland Browns, who have never even appeared\nin a Super Bowl and have received the first round pick on more occasions \u00ad eight times\n\u00ad than any other franchise.\nBeing the worst competitor can also have a particular cultural meaning and value in\nsome societies. Sometimes the ideal of pure competition does not mean that winning is\nthe be-all and end-all; it also matters if a competitor has a never say die attitude and a\ndesire to compete even when there is no hope of victory. Consider the accolade `Lanterne\nRouge' given to the rider who finishes in last place in Le Tour de France (`The Tour') at\nthe end of each day. During each stage of the tour those riders who do not finish within\nthe day's time limit (through illness, injury, exhaustion or lack of performance) are elim-\ninated and forced to abandon The Tour. The art of the Lantern Rouge is to always finish\njust inside the elimination time. Whilst it is not included among the official `classifica-\ntions' of The Tour (general, points, mountains, young rider, team, combativity), there is a\ndistinction or honour associated with occupying this position and those riders who do so\ncan earn more in appearance and interview fees than those who finish in higher positions\noverall. The public has embraced this award as being intimately connected with the true\nmeaning of competition and the values associated with a stubborn refusal to quit and a\ndrive to compete against all the odds. Perhaps the Principle of Loser-Weighted\nPerformance-Based Proportionality would be an appropriate operative principle here.\nThat being said, this conception of pure competition also places internal limits on the\nextent of value that may be placed onfinishing in last place. For, if the prize for the weakest\nresult were too great, rivalling the prize for the strongest result, competition would gradu-\nally degenerate. Racers without clear winning chances would all go for the loser's prize.\nThese internal limits may explain why the organisers of The Tour, Socie\n\u00b4te\n\u00b4 du Tour de\nFrance, have never attached an official honour or prize money to the Lanterne Rouge and\nwhy, over the years, some race directors have even tried to stamp out any mention of the\naccolade, claiming that it makes a mockery of The Tour (Strickland, 2008).\nA similar dilemma faces the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as a result of its\npolicy of allowing persons to compete in the Olympics who have not achieved the estab-\nlished minimum qualifying standards. Presumably the rationales for this policy have to\ndo with activity enhancement and promoting athletics throughout the world (that is, to\ngive small nations a chance to participate in the Olympics whilst they develop their local\nOlympic programmes and seek out talented youngsters). Given these rationales, should\nthe IOC augment the standard gold, silver and bronze medals with a fourth medal\nwhich would recognise outstanding effort or endeavour? Such a medal might have\nbeen used to formally recognise the performances of people like Eddie `The Eagle'\nEdwards, the British ski jumper who became the most memorable participant in the\n1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary despite finishing a distant last place in both the\n70 m and 90 m ski jump events, or Eric Moussambani, the swimmer from Equatorial\nGuinea who achieved folk hero status at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney pre-\ncisely because he barely managed to complete the full distance in the men's 100 m\nfreestyle event. However, it is one thing to admire the plucky spirit of these individ-\nuals; it is quite another to think that it is fair to recognise their efforts in the prize\nstructure itself. Perhaps it would be fairer to reserve Olympic medals for excellence\nin performance and find alternative ways of marking the achievements of distant\nlosers, such as through television and radio appearances, advertising campaigns, sports\nambassadorial roles, Twitter followers, and so forth.\nClarifications and implications\nThus far I have set out a range of principles of stakes fairness in response to a lack of\nprecision in the literature. I have also outlined a certain sort of method for working out\nwhat is the right principle of stakes fairness in a given situation. The method involves\nidentifying the rationales, including the social meanings, behind particular competitions\nand making inferences as to appropriate principles of stakes fairness for those competi-\ntions. I have also offered a number of tentative suggestions in concrete cases. In this sec-\ntion, however, I shall offer some important clarifications of the method and the\nconclusions I seek to draw from it.\nMy first clarification has to do with the nature of the sporting rationales. Sporting\nrationales are interpretive properties of the practices of those involved in given sports\nin the sense that they seek to help us understand why the rules, regulations and practices\ntake the forms they do. It is not assumed that these rationales are explicitly adopted. They\nare also critical properties in the sense that they are taken to be norms that could inform\nthe reflections of governing bodies, tournament directors, and so on, as they seek to\nimprove their rules, regulations and practices over time, and that can provide a basis for\nexternal evaluation, positive or negative, along the lines of whether agencies are or are\nnot doing enough to honour and serve the implicit rationales of the sports they regulate.17\nWhat implications does this have for some of the real world controversies that have\nemerged in relation to fairness in sporting prize structures? In some instances the method\nprovides a basis for commending a governing body for its stance over a particular\ncontroversy, or rebutting criticisms levelled at parties involved in negotiations over the\nprize structure of certain sporting events. Consider once again professional boxing. Since\n2010 the world's two highest paid athletes, boxers Manny Pacquiao and Floyd May-\nweather, have been in protracted, on\u00adoff negotiations to stage a `mega-bout'. In early\n2012 the negotiations supposedly stalled because Mayweather refused to agree to the\nnormal 50\u00ad50 split in the case of a bout between two defending champions, with some\nreports that Mayweather was holding out either for a 70\u00ad30 split in his favour or a deal\nin which Pacquiao received a flat-fee of $40,000,000 rather than a percentage of the\npay-per-view money and other variable earnings. Many boxing fans who were eager\nto see the fight took the opportunity on various websites to attack Mayweather's\nreported demands as `unfair', claiming that it would be wrong for any of the four orga-\nnising bodies to sanction the bout under Mayweather's terms. Some even accused\nMayweather of looking for excuses to avoid the fight. Hopes for the fight were raised\nonce again later in the year when, having unexpectedly lost his WBO Welterweight\ntitle to Timothy Bradley, Pacquiao indicated that he would accept a 45\u00ad55 split, with\nMayweather taking the larger percentage. But, soon afterwards, Pacquiao lost another\nfight, this time to Juan Manuel Ma\n\u00b4rquez. I believe that focusing on the relevant sport-\ning rationale offers a path through the morass. The customary expectation that two\nchampions split a purse flows from the assumption that, other things remaining equal,\ntwo champions will contribute roughly the same in terms of generating revenues. How-\never, the reality in the case of the proposed Mayweather\u00adPacquiao fight was that in\n2012 Mayweather had a significantly better track record in attracting paying custom-\ners. Forbes.com calculated that Mayweather's previous six fights had averaged 1.4\nmillion pay-per-view buys, while only one of Pacquiao's fights had ever reached that\nfigure (Badenhausen, 2012). So, if the rationale of the governing bodies in boxing was\nand is to enable agents and promoters to put on fights which attract as many paying\ncustomers as possible over time, it does not seem unfair for them to sanction May-\nweather's demands for the higher percentage. Recall part (d) of Rule 2.12 of the WBC\nRules and Regulations quoted above: `the Board of Governors may, in its discretion\nand by a majority vote, modify the division of purse offer proceeds between boxers\nin a purse offer in unusual or special cases, like the consideration of the outstanding\nmarketing value of one of the boxers'.\nIn other instances my method supports a critical stance, for instance when a rationale\npermeates part but not all of a governing body's rules and practices, making it possible to\nrebuke the body concerned for not fully realising its rationale. Consider the rationales\nbehind the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF) Diamond League\nwhich are to reward those athletes who are able to be consistently excellent throughout\na season (activity enhancement) and to enhance the worldwide appeal of athletics (side-\neffect of activity) by pitting the world's top athletes against one another as individuals\nover a series of events held in different parts of the world, with points accumulated on\na league table or Diamond Race. Here the onus is on individual athletes to perform well\nat each and every event, thus giving the spectators throughout the world the best possible\nsporting action. In 2012 the prize money for the event winners at each of the 14 meetings\nThis meant that in principle an athlete who focused on winning a number of events\nwithout competing at every Diamond League meeting and without winning the Diamond\nRace could have accumulated similar levels of prize money to an athlete who appeared in\nevery event and won the Diamond Race on aggregate points. Arguably the rationale\nwould have been even better served by putting more of the total prize money into the\nDiamond Race itself, thereby fairly rewarding what was supposed to be a true test of con-\nsistency in performance throughout the season.\nMy second clarification has to do with the nature of the supporting connections that\nI have indicated between given rationales for sporting competitions and appropriate prin-\nciples of stakes fairness. It is that the supporting connections involve moralised practical\nreasoning of the following form. If the rationale for a given sport is R, there is a rationale-\norientated reason to believe that an appropriate principle of stakes fairness for that sport\nis P, where a rationale-orientated reason is one that either shows that P is consistent with\nR (a weak reason) or that P advances R (a strong reason). A principle P is consistent with\na rationale R if ultimately the enforcement of P is expected to be not counter-productive\nto R, in the sense that P is likely not to undermine or detract from R relative to a baseline\nof no principle. A principle P advances a rationale R if P is likely to push forward or\nadvance the cause of R relative to a baseline of no principle.18\nThe discovery or construction of rationale-orientated reasons involves, amongst other\nthings: careful reflection on the constituent features of possible rationales (which may be\namenable to a combination of methods from across the humanities and social sciences\nincluding but not limited to sociology, psychology, economics and philosophy); identi-\nfication of a relevant metric by which it is possible to judge whether or not, or the extent\nto which, a principle is consistent with or advances a given rationale; detailed assessment\nof evidence about causal links between the enforcement of a principle and resulting\nstates of affair including intricate examination of probability and risk. Naturally, then,\nthe project of discovering or constructing rationale-orientated reasons is neither simple\nnor error-free. In the case of side-effect of activity rationales, for example, the metric\nmust reflect the intended side-effect which stimulates the sport, but it is still possible\nto make mistakes as to what the likely consequences of enforcing a given principle will\nbe. This is why I have described the suggestions made in the previous section as `tenta-\ntive': at best they reflect preliminary or provisional rationale-orientated reasons. The\nproject of working through a set of sound reasons based on comprehensive analyses is\nbeyond the scope of this article, the aim of which is to motivate and sketch a general\nframework.\nUp to this point I have only provided rationale-orientated reasons for given principles\nbased on particular instances or tokens of four main types of sporting rationale. This\nraises an obvious question: would it be possible to draw any meaningful generalisations\nlinking each of the four types of sporting rationales with particular principles of stakes\nfairness? And, further, what would such generalisations look like? Table 1 provides a\nrough approximation of one possible set of generalisations that could in theory emerge\nfrom the sort of detailed examination described in the previous paragraph, based on a\nsufficiently large sample of sports. With the four types of sporting rationale listed across\nthe top and the ten principles of stakes fairness listed down the left-hand side, `S' denotes\na strong connection between a type of rationale and a principle (that is, that the principle\nis likely to advance the type of rationale if enforced), `W' stands for a weak connection\n(that is, that the principle is merely consistent with the type of rationale) and `N' indi-\ncates a negative connection (that is, that the principle is likely to undermine or detract\nfrom the type of rationale if enforced).\nSeveral things may be immediately striking about Table 1. One is that it proposes the\nexistence of strong, weak and negative connections between the side-effect of activity\nrationale and each of the ten principles. This hedged generalisation (or non-generalisa-\ntion) reflects the wide range of rationales that can be captured within the side-effect of\nactivity family of rationales, such that whether the connection is strong, weak or negative\nfor any particular case will depend crucially on the particular external effect being aimed\nat. In addition, Table 1 suggests a negative connection between the activity enhance-\nment, the weighted lottery and the pure competition rationales and the Principle of\nContribution-Based Proportionality. Recall that `contribution' has a technical meaning\nin my framework, namely, what each participant contributes to the prize fund. So, basing\nthe prize structure solely upon contributions is likely to detract from these rationales,\nbecause they are each geared towards rank and performance rather than contribution.\nHowever, the three winner-weighted contribution-based principles might be weakly con-\nnected (that is, consistent) with these same three rationales simply by virtue of the sig-\nnificance these principles place on the winning rank or performance over and above\ncontribution. Table 1 also states that the Principle of Strict Equality is negatively con-\nnected with the weighted lottery and pure competition rationales but can be weakly con-\nnected, strongly connected or negatively connected with activity enhancement\ndepending on the motivations of the competitors. This has to do with the fact that within\nat least some sporting contexts competitors may be motivated to engage in the desired\nactivity by the idea of winning prizes regardless of whether or not it is the sort of prize\nthat everyone wins. Finally, Table 1 posits a weak connection, but not a strong connec-\ntion, between the activity enhancement, weighted lottery and pure competition rationales\nSide-effect\nof activity\nActivity\nenhancement\nWeighted\nlottery\nPure\ncompetition\nStrict Equality S or W or N S or W or N N N\nRanking-Based Winner-Takes-All S or W or N W W W\nRanking-Based Lexicality S or W or N S or W S or W S or W\nPerformance-Based Proportionality S or W or N S or W S or W S or W\nWinner-Weighted Performance-Based\nProportionality\nS or W or N S or W S or W S or W\nLoser-Weighted Performance-Based\nProportionality\nS or W or N S or W S or W S or W\nContribution-Based Proportionality S or W or N N N N\nContribution-Based Winner-\nWeighted Proportionality\nS or W or N W or N W or N W or N\nEquity-Stake Contribution-Based\nWinner-Weighted Proportionality\nS or W or N W or N W or N W or N\nMinimum-Stake Contribution-Based\nWinner-Weighted Proportionality\nS or W or N W or N W or N W or N\nand the Principle of Ranking-Based Winner-Takes-All. The basis for doing so is that giv-\ning the entire prize to the winner tends to be a missed opportunity to honour or push for-\nward those rationales for all concerned. A winner-takes-all prize structure might\nrecognise enhancements in the activity of the winner but not of the losers or lower ranked\ncompetitors, tracks the differential traits and qualities between the winner and the losers\nbut not between or among the losers, and valorises the competitive spirit demonstrated\nby the winner but ignores a similar spirit demonstrated even by the lower ranked\ncompetitors.\nObjections\nIn this section I identify two possible objections to my method and its conclusions and\nindicate how the method might be further developed in response. The first objection\nhighlights the problem of indeterminacy. Having suggested that the underlying ratio-\nnales for holding sporting competitions can provide useful guides for identifying appro-\npriate principles of stakes fairness it also demands attention that sometimes the answer to\nthe question, `What is the most appropriate principle of stakes fairness for a given\nsport?', remains partially indeterminate. By this I mean two things. First, it may be pos-\nsible to read more than one rationale and social meaning into a sporting competition at\nthe same time. Call this rationale pluralism. Such pluralism need not always pose a prob-\nlem, of course, as when two rationales point to the same principle. However, in some\ninstances having two or more rationales can suggest the appropriateness of two or more\nprinciples of stakes fairness which if applied concurrently would entail entirely different\nprize structures. This problem reflects the fact that the rationales and meanings of most\nsocial practices are complex and dynamic and subject to disagreement. What strikes\nsome interpreters as a plausible rationale for a sporting competition may appear to other\ninterpreters as without genuine value to the participants or spectators. This is not all that\nsurprising given a pluralism of views in society about the value of competition.\nSecond, even when it is possible to fix upon a single rationale and social meaning as\nbest capturing the underlying purpose or value of a sporting competition, it remains pos-\nsible, likely even, that one and the same rationale and social meaning will support more\nthan one principle of stakes fairness. So, for example, even if the rationale and social\nmeaning behind a sporting competition is activity enhancement and this points in the\ndirection of a performance-based principle rather than a contribution-based principle,\nthis rationale and social meaning may not in itself determine that any one of the alterna-\ntive performance-based principles is the most appropriate. The objection, therefore, is\nthat if there is no emergence of a single principle of stakes fairness, then the method\nI have outlined would be hard to use as an action-guiding method. This objection presup-\nposes a wider phenomenon in the interpretation of value concepts: contestation as to the\ncorrect meaning of a concept and what that meaning implies for precisely how agents\nought to act in given circumstances.19\nThe question I need to consider, therefore, is whether or not these two forms of partial\nindeterminacy fatally weaken the practicality of the method. In other words, could one\nsay that the method is not sufficiently helpful to those governing bodies, administrators,\ncompetitors and fans associated with sporting competitions who are committed to the\nidea of stakes fairness and need to know which particular principle of stakes fairness to\nadopt? One possible answer to this question that I shall not seek to rely upon here denies\nthe premise of the question: that it is one of the tasks of philosophy to be practical. This\nresponse is not equivalent to the denigration of philosophy as irrational or to the claim\nthat it cannot provide genuine knowledge of value concepts. Rather, it is the view that\naction-guidance is not the job of philosophy, not least because invariably a social prac-\ntice will reek of more than one value or else there is more than one way to satisfy the\nrequirements of that value because it is essentially contested. However, I shall assume\nthat it is reasonable to ask a philosopher of stakes fairness for tools that can be used both\nto identify the operative rationale and to narrow down the field of appropriate principles\nonce a rationale has been identified.\nWhat needs to be emphasised, I think, is not that the method must be fully determinate\nbut rather that it is determinate enough to be sufficiently helpful in a significant number\nof cases. It is possible, I believe, to reach the desired level of sufficiency by bolstering the\nmethod with certain provisos \u00c0 provisos which enable the philosopher of stakes fairness\nto light upon the operative rationale in a systematic, non-arbitrary way and which pro-\nvide guidance on the selection of the most appropriate principle(s) for a given rationale.\nWhile it may be possible to make a case for several provisos I shall limit myself to just\ntwo. The first tries to capture the idea of reflective equilibrium discussed earlier.\nThe Reflective Equilibrium Proviso. Identifying an operative rationale for a sporting com-\npetition is partly a matter of seeking a coherence or fit between a given rationale, a principle\nor principles of stakes fairness and considered judgements about stakes fairness in particular\ncases, where nothing is immune from revision.\nIn most of the examples developed in the previous sections I started with a rationale or\nrationales for a sporting competition and then worked forwards to identity a principle or\nprinciples of stakes fairness that would be consistent with or serve the rationale or ratio-\nnales. However, the Reflective Equilibrium Proviso reminds us that the process of trying\nto find a fit among various possible rationales and principles works in both directions:\nthat it is not simply a matter of which principle is most appropriate for a rationale but\nalso which rationale is most appropriate for a principle, all the while factoring in consid-\nered judgements of stakes fairness in relevant cases.\nSometimes, although not always, achieving coherence or fit requires the ruling out of\nsome rationales. When considered judgements are particularly strong about relevant\ncases and a certain principle seems self-evident, it may be possible to work backwards\nto settle upon an operative rationale that best fits the principle. Consider the ancient\nOlympic games. The games were shrouded in myth and legend, with historians such\nas Pausanias and Pindar telling different stories of their origins, typically making use\nof the legends of the Greek Gods. Non-mythical histories of the games of ancient Greece\nalso vary in their accounts of the central function they served (compare Kyle, 2007; and\nSpivey, 2005). There is the theory that the games helped to build and maintain truces\nbetween the peoples of warring city states and their aggressive warrior classes. Better\nwarriors face each other in a sporting arena than on a battlefield. This side-effect of activ-\nity rationale seems to favour the Principle of Ranking-Based Winner-Takes-All \u00c0 `to the\nvictor belong the spoils'. Then there is the thesis that at a very basic level the ancient\nGreeks were instinctively competitive, believing as they did in the intrinsic value of agon\n(contest). This rationale of pure competition also seems to support the Principle of\nRanking-Based Winner-Takes-All. But, then again, there is the hypothesis that the\ngames were initiated and maintained in order to enhance a range of physical activities\nthat were already deemed valuable. This account emphasises the institution of public\ngymnasiums, where persons would meet together to practise and perfect their running,\njumping, throwing, wrestling, and so on. The games were an extension of these institu-\ntions and enhanced further those physical activities that partly constituted what it meant\nto lead a flourishing life or eudaimonia (that is, self-fulfilment through personal excel-\nlence) within that culture. This rationale might seem to favour the Principle of\nPerformance-Based Proportionality. So, which is the operative rationale for the purposes\nof judging the stakes fairness of the ancient Olympics? Starting with considered judge-\nments about the actual prize structures of the games may provide a way of narrowing\ndown the rationales. It seemed right to the ancient Greeks that during the games compet-\nitors from city-states across the region would compete in events for which there was but a\nsingle winner who would receive a prize of a crown or wreath made from an olive\nbranch. So they favoured the Principle of Ranking-Based Winner-Takes-All. What does\nthis tell us about the operative rationale? It tells us, I suggest, that the operative rationale\nwas not to promote or enhance the sort of physical activity and perfection that was\nalready valued in Greek society. For, if that were the purpose it is difficult to explain why\nprizes were not given to all competitors who demonstrated improved performance or, for\nthat matter, why the prizes did not take a form, such as money or training, that could help\npersons to improve.20 The practice is also difficult to fathom on the relevant side-effect\nof activity rationale. To honour a single athlete is to symbolise the victory of one city\nover another. In fact, in many instances the victor would return to his city to receive fur-\nther valuable opportunities including the command of an army and the honour of leading\nhis city into real battle. So the games continued to Balkanize, especially when stories\nwere told by athletes from other city-states during or in the build up to warfare, of cheat-\ning during the games. None of this is easy to square with the rationale of diffusing\ntension. Arguably the best explanation as to why the Principle of Ranking-Based\nWinner-Takes-All was an appropriate principle of stakes fairness for the ancient Olym-\npics is the deep and profound commitment to pure competition in Greek culture. In this\nway reflective equilibrium can be used to narrow down appropriate rationales for sport-\ning competitions as well as appropriate principles of stakes fairness.\nHowever, what about instances in which it is the rationale that seems self-evident and\nthere is more than one principle on the table? A second proviso addresses this other form\nof indeterminacy.\nThe Comparative Support Proviso. In the event that there is a supporting connection\nbetween a given rationale and two or more principles of stakes fairness, priority should\nbe given to a principle grounded by a strong rationale-orientated reason over a principle\ngrounded by a weak rationale-orientated reason, and the order of priority among two prin-\nciples both grounded by strong rationale-orientated reasons depends upon the extent to\nwhich each of the proposed principles serves the rationale comparatively speaking.\nIn order to see how this proviso might work consider the Prizefighter Series in boxing. In\nApril 2008 the UK boxing promoter Barry Hearn put on a new boxing tournament which\naired on the successful subscription channel, Sky Sports. Eight professional boxers com-\npeted in knockout stages (quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final) during a single night of\nboxing. The rationale behind the tournament had to do with the side-effect of activity: to\nmake boxing more exciting, to increase television audiences and, ultimately, to generate\nwealth for everyone associated with the tournament \u00ad including the boxers, the trainers,\nthe venue proprietor, the broadcaster, the advertisers and, of course, the promoter him-\nself. So far, so straightforward. However, Hearn opted to base the prize structure not on\nthe standard rules and regulations of the main governing bodies in relation to champion-\nship bouts and eliminators, which speak to the marketing value of the boxers and which\nuphold the Principle of Contribution-Based Proportionality. Instead, Hearn opted for a\nstructure that reflected the Principle of Ranking-Based Lexicality. The winner of the\nand the losing quarter-finalists \u00a33,000. Now it may have been possible to make a case\nfor either of these rival principles of stakes fairness based on strong rationale-\norientated reasons: the likelihood is that both of the principles and associated prize struc-\ntures would have advanced Hearn's aim of putting on an exciting tournament and\ngenerating wealth, relative to a baseline of no tournament. In that sense it is not possible\nto say that Hearn's chosen prize structure was fairer than an alternative, contribution-\nbased structure. However, the Comparative Support Proviso calls for fine-grained com-\nparisons of two or more strong rationale-orientated reasons wherever possible. How is\nthis done? In the first instance it is a matter of identifying a relevant metric by which\nto judge the extent to which a principle advances a given rationale. Since the rationale\nin this case was wealth-focused, the relevant metric is money. So the question is: adher-\ning to which principle of stakes fairness would have generated the greatest amount of\nmoney for those involved? Based on this shared rationale arguably the stronger of the\ntwo rationale-orientated reasons is the one favouring the Principle of Ranking-Based\nLexicality. Hearn's aim was to generate both incremental incentives on the part of the\nboxers and mounting audience excitement in the tournament as the rounds progressed,\nwhich, in all probability, would have been harder to achieve had the winners of each\nof the stages not been guaranteed to receive larger prizes than the losers (that is, had\nHearn adopted more conventional contribution-based principles).\nOf course, using the Comparative Support Proviso may not always yield a unique,\nmost appropriate principle, especially when two or more principles serve a rationale for\nwhich there is no obvious metric or the advancement of which is a matter of fundamen-\ntally uncertain probabilities. But the approach does not need to yield uniqueness in every\ncase to be sufficiently helpful. That the method substantially narrows down the field of\npossibilities in a significant number of cases is consistent with its sometimes being fully\nindeterminate. In the latter cases one can simply accept that there is no unique, most\nappropriate principle.\nIt is now time to consider a second objection. The method I have outlined selects\nappropriate principles of stakes fairness using a particular sort of moralised practical rea-\nsoning seasoned with the aforementioned provisos. However, the objection might be\nraised that appealing to the existing rationales and social meanings of given sports cannot\nprovide acceptable premises for moralised practical reasoning, because accepting what-\never exists just because it does exist is dogmatic or arbitrary, in the sense that it is not\nsufficiently critical of the rationales that animate sports. After all, in some cases one might\nthink that the rationale of a sport is morally pernicious. The further worry is that without\ncritical reflection on the rationales any conclusions reached as to the appropriateness of\nprinciples of stakes fairness will be relative to the assumed rationales and as such these\nconclusions could only give credence to a form of value relativism in stakes fairness.\nMy response to this objection is to stress that mine is not an uncritical account of\nrationale-orientated reasons. Indeed, by using the word `appropriate' I was deliberately\nintending to connote more than simply whatever principle serves a rationale. Instead,\nI meant a principle and rationale that are both morally fitting in a broader sense. So\nI propose two additional provisos to address the objection head-on.21 The first is this.\nThe Autonomy Proviso. When it comes to selecting an appropriate principle of stakes fair-\nness it is necessary that a principle is consistent with or serves a rationale which participants\nin the sport have chosen to adopt or if they cannot choose would choose to adopt if they\ncould. One of the clearest signs of autonomy is that those engaged in the sporting compe-\ntition can be interpreted as though they were co-authors of the rationales.\nThe power of the proviso is most evident whenever rationales have been externally\nimposed on sport. In China during the early 1950s, for example, Chairman Mao pre-\nscribed sport or `physical culture' as something that helped individuals to be physically\nstrong and consequently better able to `Serve the People' through agricultural and mate-\nrial production or in the military (the side-effect of activity). By edict he also elevated\ntable tennis to the status of the national sport of China as a symbol that post-\nrevolution it could compete with and defeat the world's leading nations (the side-\neffect of activity). Other sports or games were banned on the grounds that they embodied\nundesirable rationales. For instance, Mah-jong was banned in 1949 as a gambling activ-\nity which signified the excesses of capitalism. In 1959 Mao also criminalised boxing by\nvirtue of its violent and wicked nature, again citing its links to capitalism and capitalistic\ntraits. Later, during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, the government dis-\ncouraged people from engaging in certain martial arts, which, because they were based\non traditional philosophies and clan lineages, were denounced as counter-revolutionary.\nDuring this period a new emphasis was placed on sport's function in creating unity and\ncooperation (the side-effect of activity). Anticipating a loss to a visiting American table\ntennis team, the Party promoted the slogan, `Friendship First, Competition Second'.\nNevertheless, historians have observed that people continued to play competitive games\nand sports such as Mah-jong and various styles of martial arts due to rationales that pre-\ndated the founding of the People's Republic of China. Mah-jong continued to be a fun\nway to pass the time, whether for participants or for spectators gambling on the outcomes\n(the side-effect of activity), and the idea persisted that martial arts embodied the values\nof individual accomplishment (activity enhancement) and sublime human contest (pure\ncompetition). (These various historical interpretations rely on Clumpner and Pendleton,\nexample enables the philosopher of stakes fairness to rule out rationales that the Maoist\nregime attempted to impose on the Chinese people: to say that the relevant governing\nauthorities did not make of sport something that the people chose or would have chosen\nif they could. In turn, the proviso blocks the claim to appropriateness of any principles of\nstakes fairness which reflect only non-autonomous rationales.\nThis proviso is necessary but not sufficient for the identification of an operative ratio-\nnale, however. For, a rationale can be autonomous in the above sense yet nevertheless\nfail to capture a value that anyone could have reason to care about. Thus I also propose\na further proviso.\nThe Objective Value Proviso. For the purposes of selecting an appropriate principle of\nstakes fairness it is necessary that a principle serves an interpretive rationale that is itself\nobjectively valuable. A rationale is objectively valuable only if it can stand as a basis for\na sporting competition without depending on a particular view of what has value that would\nbe unconscionable to any reasonable, morally cognisant human being.\nThis proviso is designed to address the possibility that a group of persons could believe\nthat a certain principle of stakes fairness is appropriate for a given sporting competition\neven though the rationale it serves is one that any right-thinking person would find\nabhorrent. Suppose a group of twisted individuals invent a sport the purpose of which\nis designed to enhance their torture techniques (torture being something they already like\nto do). The aim of the torture game is to score more points in the infliction of pain and\nsuffering on unwilling victims than the other competitors. The scoring system reflects\nperformance parameters such as the intensity and duration of the pain and suffering\ncaused, the elegance and innovation of the torture devices and techniques employed, the\nability to keep the victims conscious and alive for long periods of time whilst inflicting\nmaximum pain, and so forth. Now, there is a sense in which one or more of the ten prin-\nciples of stakes fairness could be appropriate for this sport given its rationale. Consider\nthe Principle of Performance-Based Proportionality, for example. However, there is\nanother sense in which no principle of stakes fairness is `rightful' and this is the sense\nI intend to capture with the Objective Value Proviso. Because the competitors in the\nsport actively embrace the rationale of activity enhancement, the Autonomy Proviso\ndoes not rule it out. Nevertheless, so long as the rationale assumes a set of motives, incli-\nnations and consequences that are objectively wicked, the prize structure fails to satisfy\nthe proviso and cannot be viewed as genuinely appropriate.22\nBut to what extent is the Objective Value Proviso sensitive to cultural differences? In\nanswer to this question, I read the proviso as speaking to motives, inclinations and con-\nsequences that are seen as wicked in virtually every human society \u00ad and if they are not\nviewed as such by some outlier societies it is because those societies are not signatories\nto basic standards of human rights as normally conceived. However, even within the\nrange of what is an acceptable rationale for organising or participating in sporting com-\npetitions there will be cultural differences such that some societies may have rationales\nfor engaging in sports that other societies find it hard to fathom. Even so, I believe that it\ndoes remain possible to accommodate the fact of cultural diversity within more general\ndescriptions of valuable rationales that are ubiquitous throughout the world. So, for\nexample, consider the traditional Inuit game of ear-pulling, which is designed to test not\nhow much pain a competitor can inflict but rather how much pain a competitor can\nendure.23 At first glance, it might not be possible for non-Inuit spectators to see the value\nin a game which involves pulling on ears with such force as to cause bleeding. Yet it\nmight still be possible to reach a shared understanding on the value of any sport which\ntests the competitors' bravery and fortitude in the face of physical discomfort. So, if\nmembers of Western cultural communities can recognise the general value in competi-\ntors attempting to run 26 miles non-stop in the shortest possible time and sometimes in\nwarm conditions and on hard road surfaces, in spite of the loss of toe nails, torn muscles\nand even severe dehydration and exhaustion, then upon further reflection they might be\nable to see the same general value in ear-pulling.\nFurthermore, the Objective Value Proviso is not violated simply because some people\ntake a dim view of a rationale. Consider people who regard it as immoral to put on sport-\ning competitions, such as boxing, which carry serious health risks for the competitors,\nprimarily for the purpose of making money. They might say that this is treating the com-\npetitors purely as means and not as ends in themselves. Or, borrowing from Jacobs'\ninsights about all aspects of the concept of stakes fairness, someone could argue that the\ninput stakes in boxing are too high because of the physical risks involved. If this sort of\njudgement is correct, then it raises questions about a range of other, inherently dangerous\nand life-threatening professional sports, everything from transatlantic sailing to motor\nsport and alpine skiing, despite the fact that competitors freely consent to participate.\nHowever, I shall assume that such cases do not violate the Objective Value Proviso pro-\nvided that they can be fitted into more general rationales that are universally valued (for\nexample, allowing autonomous persons to choose to take risks in order to realise their\nrational life plans, or enhancing the ability of human beings to achieve great feats of\nendurance, skill and physical bravery) and, more importantly, provided that they do not\ninvolve or amount to universally recognised abuses of human rights. No doubt the line\nbetween the two sorts of cases may sometimes be difficult to draw and could depend\nupon whether or not reasonable safety precautions can be agreed upon.\nThe place of equality and desert\nIn this final section I want to look at some of the associations and disassociations\nbetween the above discussion of stakes fairness in sport and more general philosophical\ndebates about justice. In order to give the section a sharper focus I shall concentrate on\ntwo concepts that continue to be central to those debates: equality and desert.\nFor Jacobs, the core idea of stakes fairness reflects a concern with widening the dis-\ntribution of good outcomes within competition prize structures and the putative insight\nthat winner-takes-all prize structures are rarely fair. This aspect of stakes fairness shares\nsome features, but is not identical, with the now familiar `luck egalitarian' distinction\nbetween equality of opportunity and equality of outcome.24 To demand stakes fairness\nis to demand more than equality of opportunity, more than background and procedural\nfairness. It demands that the prize structure or framework of outcomes is fair. However,\nprinciples of stakes fairness are also supposed to regulate certain competitive opportuni-\nties that by their nature yield winners and losers or unequal outcomes. For this reason\nstakes fairness rarely demands simple equality of outcome. This can be seen in Jacobs'\ndiscussion of what we owe to the unemployed. Jacobs defends, on the grounds of stakes\nfairness, the importance of widening the distribution of `the assets of having job', which,\naccording to Jacobs, cannot be reduced to mere income but may also include `social net-\nworking, mental and physical health, self-esteem, and so on.' His policy conclusion is\ndramatic: `The analysis suggests to me [.] that the most effective means to deliver the\nassets of having a job to the unemployed is precisely by supplying them with jobs'\n(Jacobs, 2004: 164). In fact, it is a conclusion not too far removed from what Rawls says\nin his later work about the institutions required for stability in a pluralistic society.\n[.] d. Society as an employer of last resort through general or local government, or other\nsocial and economic policies. Lacking a sense of long-term security and the opportunity for\nmeaningful work and occupation is not only destructive of citizens' self-respect but of their\nsense that they are members of society and not simply caught in it. This leads to self-hatred,\nbitterness and resentment. (Rawls, 1996: lvi\u00adlvii)\nTwo features of this debate about equality call for attention. The first is that neither\nJacobs nor Rawls is advocating that all competitors receive the same prize. Society as an\nemployer of last resort through workfare schemes providing public jobs or training to the\nlong-term unemployed very rarely provides job assets of the same quality or value as are\nsecured by those individuals who win the competition for work and occupation in the\nlabour market. Instead, it makes sense to think of job assets as existing on a scale from\nhigher to lower quality or value; as first, second, third, and so on, prizes. So, the relevant\nprinciple here is not the Principle of Ranking-Based Winner-Takes-All but neither is it\nthe Principle of Strict Equality. Rather, it is perhaps the Principle of Ranking-Based\nLexicality. The second feature is that Jacobs and Rawls both reach a broadly similar con-\nclusion about a fair prize structure in the competition for work and occupation, but do so\nby drawing on different rationales. For Jacobs, a major part of the concern is pure fair-\nness: that it is intrinsically unfair for persons to compete for scarce job assets under a\nwinner-takes-all prize structure. He also plays on the problem of the results of the com-\npetition for jobs unduly influencing the competition for other scarce goods. For Rawls,\nby contrast, the rationale is the following. First, widening the distribution of work and\noccupation serves the Second Principle of Justice,25 which is part of a general conception\nof basic structure justice as distinct from Jacobs' much narrower conception of justice\nwhich focuses on various individualised competitive opportunities in civil society.26\nSecond, widening the distribution of jobs and occupations is necessary for ensuring sta-\nbility, meaning that the scheme of cooperation is self-supporting by virtue of the fact that\nthe principles of justice which regulate the scheme tend to incite rather than deter regular\ncompliance with the basic structure over time (Rawls, 1971: 6). The fact that both Jacobs\nand Rawls can arrive at similar sorts of policy conclusions based on very different ratio-\nnales speaks to the phenomenon of rationale pluralism \u00c0 a phenomenon which arose in\nmy account of stakes fairness in sporting prize structures.\nTurning to desert, reflecting on the ten principles of stakes fairness discussed above it\nis apparent that seven of the principles (denoted by the word `proportionality') have\nsomething in common with the Aristotelian idea that unequal treatment of agents ought\nto stand in a reasonable relationship or `geometrical proportion' to the extent of\nfairness are all instances of a more general principle of justice which Mark Reiff calls\n`the principle of proportionality': `that when two competing claims have unequal moral\nweight, we should divide the good so that the parties each receive a share of the good that\nis proportionate to the relative strength of their competing claims' (Reiff, 2009: 11).\nAs one might expect, considerations of proportionality routinely figure in philoso-\nphical debates about justice, especially debates couched in terms of `desert'. I have in\nmind everything from debates about just punishment and compensation in law to the\njust distribution of income and bonuses in the labour market and, further, to the just\nallocation of praise and blame in personal ethics. As a result, proportionality-\nsensitive principles of just deserts tend to focus on talent, effort, virtue, intent, personal\ncircumstances, egregiousness of action, and so forth, as bases of desert. Furthermore,\nthere are philosophers who maintain that something can qualify as a desert-base for a\ngiven individual only if that person is responsible for it (see, for example, Cupit, 1996:\ntrate on rank, performance and contribution to the prize pot as bases for the just alloca-\ntion of prizes. If these principles are plausible then they suggest that stakes fairness in\nsport has little to do with deeper philosophical concerns about virtue and moral respon-\nsibility. Examining the various rationales for actual sporting competitions can help us\nto see why this should be the case. Competitors do not need to be virtuous or morally\nresponsible for their rank, performance or contribution to the prize pot in order to justly\nreceive prizes governed by principles of stakes fairness when the latter serve rationales\nconstituted by the side-effects of activity, activity enhancement, weighted lottery and\nperhaps even pure competition.\nOf course, that is not to say that issues of virtue and moral responsibility are absent\nfrom judgements of background and procedural fairness. I do not rule out the possibility\nthat such issues are more pressing for these other aspects of fairness. For example, I do\nnot mean to ignore the disquiet that most people interested in sport perpetually show for\nthe problems of cheating, both in cases of bending the rules (for example, `diving' in\nfootball) and in cases of directly flouting the rules (for example, taking banned\nperformance-enhancing drugs in athletics or cycling).27 However, it seems to me that\neven here the discussion is primarily about the sorts of traits and abilities that societies\ndeem valuable and which the rules and prize structures of sporting competitions ought to\ntrack, as distinct from a concern for the finer philosophical questions of whether moral\nresponsibility is a necessary condition of desert and whether moral responsibility is com-\npatible with hard determinism, for example.28 In most ordinary debates about sporting\nfairness, if there are any desert-bases steering our judgements about what people do\nor do not deserve they tend to be desert-bases that reflect widespread social norms\nregarding valuable behaviour. This may also be true of various other competitions for\nsocial and economic advantages. Think of the granting of scarce jobs and positions to\npeople most likely to perform productively. Here, the thought is that a person can be\nintelligibly said to deserve a job or position by demonstrating dispositions and behaviour\nthat society deems valuable in relation to the successful performance of that job or posi-\ntion, even if the individual concerned cannot claim to be responsible for the dispositions\nand behaviour in the sort of pristine or robust sense that preoccupies metaphysicians and\nsome ethicists.29 If this thought is accurate, then it chimes with all of the rationales for\nsporting competitions identified in this article.\nNotes\n1. In this article I intend to focus on questions of intra-competition fairness or comparisons\nbetween competitors within the same competition rather than on questions of inter-\ncompetition fairness or comparisons between competitors in different competitions. The lat-\nter questions include the following. Is it fair that professional skateboarders earn on average\n$20,000 in prize money per year given that competitors who get knocked out in the first\nround of the US Open Tennis Championships singles events earn $20,000 for losing a single\nmatch? Is it fair that the winner of the men's singles competition at the US Open Tennis\nChampionships earns the same prize money as the winner of the women's singles competi-\ntion given the fact that men's matches are played over five sets as compared to three sets for\nwomen meaning that women can receive nearly twice as much prize money as men per\ngame? Is it fair that female professional golfers participating in the US Women's Open Golf\nChampionship on average earn a fraction of the prize money paid to their male counterparts\nat the US Men's Open Golf Championship even though male and female competitors toil\nover exactly the same number of holes?\n2. It is a further question whether brute luck (for example, the tennis ball hits the net and dribbles\nover for a winner) should be considered the enemy of fair competition in sport. In a sense we are\ndealing here with a universe of possible outcomes within the framework of the rules and the per-\nformances of the competitors and so it is not necessarily a matter of fairness at all. Indeed, some\nsports embrace brute luck realising that it adds to the spectacle. In other words, it is accepted that\nalthough winning and losing should be closely related to performance, outcomes need not be\nimmunised from `the rub of the green'. It is this random aspect of sport that can make it so thril-\nling for spectators and maddening for competitors of course. However, there may come a point\nat which too much brute luck ruins a sport, turning what should be a game of skill into a pure\nlottery. Take the case of the dreaded `kick' in professional snooker. (The term `kick' refers to an\nunintended and unexpected contact between the cue ball and object ball causing one or both to\njump in the air, taking the pace out of the cue ball and sometimes sending the object ball offline.)\nTo date the governing body of snooker, the World Professional and Billiards and Snooker Asso-\nciation (WPBSA), has invested relatively modest resources into diagnosing and eradicating the\nkick, which is hated by the players but viewed by many spectators as a source of high drama. If\nthe kick became a far more regular occurrence and actually diminished the enjoyment of the\naudience, one might expect the WPBSA to take a more radical approach. What is less clear\nis whether the radical approach would involve changing the prize structure.\n3. I mean to claim that restructuring prizes might be one way to mitigate these forms of unfair-\nness, not that it is the only way or even the absolute fairest way. A more radical alternative is to\nsimply abandon the attempt to judge competitions by relevant differences in performance and\n4. Take the case of competition for valuable offices. `If individual men and women are to plan\ntheir lives, to shape careers for themselves, there is no way to avoid the competition for office\nwith all its triumphs and defeats. But one can reduce the frenzy of the competition by lowering\nthe stakes. Offices are at stake and nothing more' (Walzer 1983: 164).\n5. I do not intend to discuss whether these principles of regulation are themselves underpinned by\nfundamental principles of stakes fairness. For one possible account of the differences between\nregulatory principles of justice and fundamental principles of justice, see Cohen (2003).\n6. This explains the oft-cited sporting dictum, `You can't win the tournaments in the first round\nbut you can certainly lose it.' One of the perceived problems with sporting tournaments which\nemploy a random draw rather than a seeding system is that one or more `top' performers could\nbe drawn against each other in an early round, meaning that early-round losers are unduly\npenalised by the luck of the draw. To ameliorate this problem, some tournaments operate a\nsystem of second-chances or rescues. Track athletics operates a `fastest losers' rule for qua-\nlification into subsequent rounds, and both Olympic judo and rowing operate a repechage sys-\ntem which allows competitors who have lost or failed to qualify during earlier rounds to\ncompete again for places in the latter rounds. Indeed, sometimes second-chances are offered\nacross different competitions within the same sport. An example of this can be found in Eur-\nopean club football: teams who lose their qualifying game to enter into the prestigious and\nhighly lucrative European Champions League are automatically entered into the second-tier\ncompetition, The Europa League.\n7. For a discussion of some of the generic reasons that are sometimes given in favour of winner-\ntakes-all prizes structures, see Reiff (2009).\n8. I thank Ana FitzSimons for helping me to clarify this difference.\n9. I owe this point to an anonymous Politics, Philosophy and Economics reviewer.\n10. I am indebted to Bob Sugden for posing challenges to me that resulted in the inclusion of this\ncaveat.\n11. Under the terms of the original position parties are placed behind a `veil of ignorance' where\nthey must select principles of justice in ignorance of factors that might otherwise bias their\nselection, such as class, race, gender, talent, and so on. See Rawls (1971: 12).\n12. I discuss only some of the rationales outlined in Wolff's article, focusing on those particularly\nrelevant to the issue of stakes fairness.\n13. To be clear, I draw on Wolff's list not because it is the only such list, but because it strikes me as\ncoming closest to capturing the main rationales of both amateur and professional sport. For an\nalternative list of possible `meanings' of sport which emphasises sport as `valuable', sport as a\n`surrogate' for other human needs or expressions, and sport as `language', see Gaffney (2007).\n14. In the case of the major tennis and snooker tournaments, unlike boxing events, the size of the\ntotal prize fund is not directly dependent upon the appearance of any one or two competitors.\nBut even in the case of tennis and snooker some highly marketable competitors (for example,\nRonnie O'Sullivan in snooker) or sporting rivalries (for example, Federer vs. Nadal in tennis)\ncan make a special contribution to the buzz associated with any tournaments in which they\nappear. This explains why it is that outside of the major tournaments certain top players can\ncommand significant appearance fees over and above the normal prize structure.\n15. Of course, even with lexical prize structures some clubs still choose to gamble by buying play-\ners they cannot yet afford to pay the wages of in the hopes of winning higher prizes at the end\nof the season.\n16. I am grateful to Barbara Goodwin for pressing me to add this clarification.\n17. I have in mind something akin to what Ronald Dworkin calls an interpretive attitude within his\nphilosophy of law. To say that the practices of sporting governing bodies are interpretive, in a\nDworkinian sense, is to say that those engaged in them implicitly adopt a dual attitude to what\nit is they are doing (that is, something that makes sense of the practice and which they could\naccept if it were pointed out to them). First, they believe that the practice has a real point or\nrationale in the sense that it serves some genuine interest or purpose or respects some general\nprinciple or ideal that has independent bearing and importance, where the practice is refined\nover time in the light of this point or rationale. Second, they believe that this point or rationale\nis partly constitutive of the practice, which is to say that the fact that it serves this point or\nrationale is integral as opposed to incidental to what it is. The task for the philosopher is to\nidentify a point or rationale that could plausibly stand as a genuine interest or purpose or\nenforce some valuable general principle or ideal for the practice in question. See, for example,\n18. A rationale-orientated reason is not identical with or reducible to either a constraint-orientated\nreason (that is, a reason orientated towards upholding the sort of normative rule that places\nside-constraints on how we may act) or an end-orientated reason (that is, a reason orientated\ntowards the pursuit of a valuable end or goal). This is because the rationale of any social prac-\ntice, including a sporting competition, can contain aspects which place limits on how that\npractice may be realised, aspects which set goals to be pursued and aspects which are neither\nconstraints nor goals but sheer reasons for doing.\n19. Some philosophers, of course, argue that the many value concepts which underpin our inter-\npretation of social and political practices (for example, democracy, justice, rule of law, citi-\nzenship, dignity) are not merely contested but `essentially contested'. Consider W. B.\nGallie's famous example of `the champions' (Gallie, 1955\u00ad6). Critics of Gallie, however,\nhave argued, amongst other things, that his account points in the direction of a moral and\nconceptual relativism that is both unattractive and at odds with our best understanding of\nnormative concepts. For further discussion, see Gray (1977), Clarke (1979), Swanton\n20. Contrast this with the modern Olympic movement. Today most national Olympic associations\nprovide performance-based payments to athletes. In the UK, for example, payments are made\nto `Podium Level' athletes on the basis of criteria ranging from medalling, to finishing top\neight or simply achieving the required performance standards to compete at major champion-\nships including European and Commonwealth Games, the World Championships and the\nOlympics. Smaller payments are also made to `Development Level' athletes on the basis of\nnational competition performance and the achievement of relevant performance milestones.\n21. I thank an anonymous Politics, Philosophy and Economics reviewer for pressing me to set out\nmy provisos more clearly.\n22. Once again, I owe an intellectual debt here to Dworkin's method of critical interpretation.\nConsider, for example, his discussion of the question of whether or not the Nazi's had a\nlegal system. He writes: `We need not deny that the Nazi system was an example of law,\nno matter which interpretation we favor of our own law, because there is an available\nsense in which it plainly was law. But we have no difficulty in understanding someone\nwho does say that Nazi law was not really law, or was law in a degenerate sense, or was\nless than fully law. For he is not using ``law'' in that sense; he is not making that sort of\npreinterpretive judgment but a skeptical interpretive judgment that Nazi law lacked fea-\ntures crucial to flourishing legal systems whose rules and procedures do justify coercion.\nHis judgment is now a special kind of political judgment for which his language, if the\npoint here is that the Nazi conception of law most likely fails to animate law with a point\nand purpose that is objectively valuable.\n23. I thank an anonymous Politics, Philosophy and Economics reviewer for suggesting this\nexample.\n25. The Second Principle of Justice has two parts: `Social and economic inequalities are to be\narranged so that they are both: (a) to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged [.], and (b)\nattached to positions and offices open to all under fair equality of opportunity' (Rawls,\n1971: 302). Interestingly, society as an employer of last resort serves the first, not the second,\npart of the Second Principle. This institutional response to unemployment is one component of\nwhat Rawls terms `the social bases of self-respect' (Rawls, 1971: 440).\n27. The cases of Ben Johnson in athletics and Lance Armstrong in cycling, for example,\nsparked widespread ethical debate even among people without a particular interest in\nsport. For a comprehensive academic discussion of these issues, see Morgan (2007: Parts\nII and III).\n28. One exception might be the controversy surrounding the use of hypnosis in sport. For exam-\nple, in 1996 the Irish boxer Steve `The Celtic Warrior' Collins confounded the odds to beat the\nthen defending WBO Middleweight Champion, Chris Eubank. In the aftermath of the bout the\nEubank camp, along with many of his fans and some neutral observers questioned the fairness\nof the result, on the grounds of a story which had circulated in the build up to the contest that\nCollins had been hypnotised to believe he could not lose. Eubank, who knew of the story going\ninto the bout, claimed that despite knocking Collins down in the tenth round he did not seek to\n`finish off' his opponent for fear of killing him. As such, some supporters of Eubank claimed\nthat Collins had gained an unfair advantage: the implicit reasoning being that Collins did not\ndeserve to win because he was not responsible for the confidence, fortitude and bravery he\ndemonstrated in order to win. In response, the Collins camp insisted that the story was a hoax\ndesigned to play mind games with Eubank. Collins won the rematch. This case is special\nbecause it seems to unite deeper philosophical questions about the nature and importance\nof virtue and moral responsibility, on the one hand, and the more ordinary sporting intuition,\n`may the best man win', on the other hand.\n29.
