    "abstract": "Abstract\nAnimals with front facing eyes benefit from a substantial overlap in the visual fields of each eye, and\ndevote specialized brain processes to using the horizontal spatial disparities produced as a result of\nviewing the same object with two laterally placed eyes, to derived depth or 3-D stereo\ninformation. This provides the advantage to break the camouflage of objects in front of similarly\ntextured background and improves hand eye coordination for grasping objects close at hand. It is\nwidely thought that about 5% of the population have a lazy eye and lack stereo vision, so it is often\nsupposed that most of the population (95%) have good stereo abilities. We show that this is not\nthe case; 68% have good to excellent stereo (the haves) and 32% have moderate to poor stereo\n(the have-nots). Why so many people lack good 3-D stereo vision is unclear but it is likely to be\nneural and reversible.\n",

Even though 3-D movies, 3-D television technology,\nand 3-D apps for mobile devices are commonplace, the percentage of the general population\nthat possesses normal stereopsis is a matter of controversy. Although it is commonly believed\nstereoanomalous. Having made laboratory measurements of different aspects of stereo vision\nover the last 30 years, the first author has been surprised by how difficult it is to find subjects\nwith otherwise normal vision who have good stereo sensitivity, unlike other 2-D visual\nfunctions, such as contrast sensitivity, color sensitivity, motion sensitivity, where this is not\nthe case. Here, in two related studies (one in the general population and the other in a first-\nyear university student class), we tested the stereo acuity of over 600 people using an online\nrandom dot stereo test in which the task was to discriminate (with unlimited viewing time)\nwhether a square area defined by horizontal disparity alone was in front or behind the screen\nplane; one of the simplest tests of stereo function.\nMethods\nStereo Depth Judgment Task\nThe hybrid 2-AFC task involved, on each presentation, searching for the location (upper\nright, lower right, upper left, lower left) of a square box (see Figure 1(b)) that was defined\nonly by disparity (and surrounded by zero disparity regions) and determining whether it was\nin front or behind the zero disparity fixation plane (monitor screen plane). There was no time\nlimit, and the observer's response which was indicated by a button press controlled when the\nnext presentation occurred.\nStimulus Generation\nEach stimulus was a 1,024 \u00c2 768 pixel rectangle image made up of random noise patterns.\nThe noise pattern comprised square dots. Each square dot was a three-by-three group of\npixels. We generated a stereo subregion (394 \u00c2 384 pixels; width \u00c2 height) using horizontal\ndisparity. The screen resolution and color depth were obtained by Javascript running on the\nclients' web browsers.\nThe subjects' viewing distance varied from 40 cm to 200 cm as input by each viewer\n(see Figure 1(a)). In some cases, we used the height information input by each viewer to\nestimate the arm length span.\nTest Procedure\nThere were 11 disparity levels, ranging from 1 to 11 pixels. At the largest disparity of 11\npixels, the simulated depth was very obvious to stereo normal observers. We conducted two\nseparate experiments.\nCanadian broadcasting corporation experiment. The Erst experiment was intended to be a rapid\ntest suitable for screening a large subject sample with a simple stopping criterion to determine\nthreshold. The stimuli were presented in increasing order of difficulty, starting from the\neasiest (i.e., largest disparity). To pass each level of difficulty, correct answers on two stimuli\n(of the same disparity) were required. At each presentation, a stimulus was drawn randomly\nfrom a set of eight pregenerated images (of the same disparity, where the box was in front or\nbehind with equal probability at the four possible locations). The possible responses were ``In\nFront,'' ``Behind,'' and ``Not Sure.'' A test session terminated upon one of the following\nconditions:\n. First incorrect answer\n. Two consecutive ``Not Sure'' answers\n. Correct answer at the most difficult stimulus.\nFigure 1. (a) Standardization for the testing distance for the web-based measurement.

(c) Distribution of stereoacuities and their age dependence for the general population\n(n \u00bc 531). The results are well fitted by two different distributions, those with normal stereo acuity (blue) and\nthose with poor stereo acuity (red). (d) Similar results for a student population (n \u00bc 95) but with a smaller\npercentage with poor stereopsis and a narrow age range.\nHess et al. 3\nThe chromaticity of the stimuli was designed to provide dichoptic stimulation with amber-\nblue anaglyph glasses. The website can be accessed at 3d.mcgill.ca.\nMcGill psych100 experiment. A similar experiment was then repeated among the students\nattending Psych-100 class at McGill University with a narrow age range (around 20 years\nof age). We used a different set of anaglyph, red\u00adgreen glasses, and hence, the chromaticity of\nstimuli was adjusted accordingly. Aside from this change, the order of stimulus presentation\nand stopping criterion remained the same.\nData Analysis\nTo ensure valid entries, we filtered the entries using a number of criteria including the date of\nthe entry (limited to one month), e-mail address (for the student group, only valid McGill\naddresses), IP address (limited to one for each subject), age (10\u00ad90 years), and indicated\nvisual distance (>40 cm). This conservative approach greatly reduced our number of\nparticipants but increased the reliability of the web-based approach we used.\nResults\nThe results displayed in Figure 1(c, upper frame) are broadly distributed extending over a\nrange of approximately 2.0 log units and can be modeled by two overlapping populations;\none with a peak at 1.983 log arcsec (the haves) and another with a peak located at 2.845 log\narcsec (the have-nots). There is no age dependence (lower frame).\nA similar study within a student population (first-year psychology class at McGill\nUniversity) produced similar results (Figure 1(d, upper frame)). Thus both groups exhibit\na loss of stereo capabilities that extent to a large proportion of the population.\nDiscussion\nThese results are surprising in that they suggest that there is a large percentage (32%) of\npeople with below normal stereopsis. These stereo acuities vary over a 300:1 range with 24 to\n40% of the population being 10 times worse. It is known that 5% of the population has\namblyopia (lazy eye) and would be expected to have either poor or immeasurable stereo\nvision. It is hard to explain the current result in terms of subjects' performing poorly due to\nlack of task comprehension because the student population exhibited a comparable\ndichotomous behavior. Another issue to consider is uncorrected refractive error as this\nwould reduce stereo performance. However, this seems an unlikely explanation for two\nreasons. First, only a unilateral refractive error difference is likely to reduced stereo and to\naccount for this degree of difference (approximately 1 log unit), it would need to be in excess\nof four dioptres, which is rare (incidence 1.9%; Mohammadi et al., 2013). Second, the\nstudents are less likely to have uncorrected refractive errors compared with the general\npopulation and yet they display comparable results. Oculomotor instability may also be a\npotential reason for the poor stereo performances as we assume subjects could adequately\nconverge in the screen which represented zero disparity. Media opacities and age-related\nchanges may also limit stereopsis if they are unilateral in the older age group, but the\ndichotomy reported here is not dependent on age.\nWe speculate that at the very least there is a large range of stereo capabilities in the normal\npopulation and that its likely cause is neural. It is likely that this is related to the original\ndeficient, lacking either crossed or uncrossed disparity detectors. Our stimuli are very\ndifferent from those used by Richards (1970, 1971), being global random dot stereograms,\nrather than local vertical lines, but like Richards (1970, 1971) our method also involves a\nsigned disparity judgment. Studies that don't use a signed disparity judgment, relying instead\non the detection of depth or depth-defined shape, do not report high levels of stereo anomaly\nwithin the normal population (Birch et al., 2008). Nevertheless, it is surprising that stereopsis\nshows such individual variability when other visual sensitivities do not. The adult brain\nmaintains a degree of neural plasticity, and it has recently been demonstrated that\nstereoscopic sensitivity in adults can be improved by training (Astle, McGraw, & Webb,\n2011), so it remains a possibility that the have-nots can be transformed into haves with the\nright training.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by research grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research\nReferences\nAstle, A.
