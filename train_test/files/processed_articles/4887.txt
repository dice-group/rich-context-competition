Recently, endosonography-\nguided ethanol ablation (EUS-EA) has been\nattempted as a nonsurgical treatment for PCLs\nwith low risk of malignancy \u00ad namely, no high-\nrisk stigmata, no definitive mural nodule or main\nduct feature on endoscopic ultrasound.8\nFeasibility and efficacy of EUS-EA have been\nconfirmed through several studies.9\u00ad12 The com-\nplete remission (CR) rate of PCLs through\nCR rate using ethanol and paclitaxel is reportedly\nThe long-term follow-up results suggest that the\ntreatment effect is also well maintained.9,14\nHowever, there are still some limitations in previ-\nous studies that must be overcome to ensure the\nvalidity and utility of EUS-EA for PCLs with low\nrisk of malignancy. First, it is difficult to deter-\nmine what clinical benefits they would have in\npractice because patients received EUS-EA for a\nnumber of PCLs with indolent courses such as\nSCN or pseudocyst.9 Second, the definite thera-\npeutic effects of EUS-EA were proven,11 but it is\ndifficult to confirm the clinical benefits of\nEUS-EA compared to a surveillance strategy. It is\nnecessary to determine whether the clinical out-\ncomes actually improve the survival gain through\nthe prevention of malignancy, maintenance of\nquality of life (QOL) through avoidance of unnec-\nessary surgery and achievement of true CR.\nIn this study, we evaluated the clinical benefits of\nEUS-EA therapy for PCLs with a low risk of\nmalignancy, and compared these with those of\nthe natural course (NC) of PCLs using a surveil-\nlance strategy.\nMethod\nStudy design and patients\nThis retrospective study investigated patients who\nvisited Seoul National University Hospital with\nPCLs diagnosed through image modalities.\nPatients' data, including age, sex, Adult\nComorbidity Evaluation-27,17 initial and last size of\nPCLs, characteristics of PCLs and surgical reports\nwere collected from a retrospective chart review.\nPatients were divided into two groups, an NC\ngroup that did not undergo surgery for initial\ntreatment and an EUS-EA group that received\nethanol ablation therapy. In the NC group,\npatients who were diagnosed with PCLs from\nthe EUS-EA group, the procedure was performed\nof the EUS-EA were as follows: (1) clinically non-\npseudocyst PCLs; (2) cystic size was 2\u00ad5 cm\nwithout communication with the main pancreatic\nduct. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1)\nmatic PCLs; (4) planned surgery at the time of\ndiagnosis; (5) PCLs associated with genetic dis-\nease; (6) clinically suspicious pseudocysts; (7)\nPCLs with high-risk stigmata (obstructive jaun-\ndice, enhanced solid component, or main pancre-\natic duct more than 10 mm);8 (8) main duct type\nor mixed type IPMN; (9) cystic degeneration of\nsolid tumors.\nThis study was approved by the institutional\nreview board (IRB) of the Seoul National\nUniversity Hospital, Korea (IRB No. H-1606-\nwaived by the IRB.\nProcedure steps of EUS-EA\nEUS-EA is simultaneously performed with cystic\nfluid aspiration for PCLs because a split\napproach has two limitations: (1) two invasive\nprocedures can increase the economic burden\nand risk of complications; (2) the required wait-\ning period for the procedure because of reduc-\ntion of cystic size after diagnostic cystic fluid\naspiration.\nThe study patients received EUS-EA from three\ngastroenterologists who were experts in interven-\ntional EUS.

EUS-EA for PCLs was\naccomplished using the following protocol: (1)\nthe longest diameter was measured; (2) 80% of\nthe cystic fluid was aspirated, after which 99%\nethanol was injected and stored in the cyst for 3\u00ad5\nmin; (3) step number 2 was repeated twice; (4) all\ninjected ethanol and remnant cystic fluid was\naspirated.\nCategorization of PCLs by cystic fluid analysis\nThe characteristics of PCLs in the EUS-EA group\nwere evaluated by location, size, and measure-\nment of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and\namylase level from the aspirated cystic fluid. The\nPCLs of the EUS-EA group were categorized\nbased on analysis of cystic fluid: SCN (CEA <5\nng/mL, amylase <800 U/L), pseudocyst (CEA\nPCLs that did not meet these criteria (5 ng/mL \nCEA < 200 ng/mL) were categorized as indeter-\nminate cysts.\nStudy outcome and definition of events\nAll outcomes were evaluated with propensity\nscore matching (PSM) data. The primary out-\ncome of the study was comparison of overall sur-\nvival (OS) in both groups. The secondary\noutcomes were the rate of surgery in both groups,\nand the CR rate in the EUS-EA group.\nThe survival status was updated in June 2017.\nData from living patients were considered cen-\nsored for survival analysis. CR was defined as no\nvisible PCLs on repeated imaging studies per-\nformed during the follow-up period. The follow-\nup period was calculated from the time of the\ndiagnosis to the death or most recent outpatient\nvisit.\nStatistical analysis\nWe conducted PSM analysis between the\nEUS-EA and the NC groups to construct a rand-\nomized experiment-like situation and minimize\nselection bias. A logistic regression model was\nconducted to calculate the propensity score of the\nfollowing covariates: age, sex, follow-up duration,\ninitial cystic size, and number of initial worrisome\nfeatures except size. Based on the propensity\nscore, 1:1 matching was performed between the\nEUS-EA group and the NC group. For matching,\nnearest neighbor matching with a caliper width of\nshowed that the structure of the two groups was\nsimilar and the matching was successful (p = 0.983).\nThe L1 of the multivariate imbalance measure on\nthe matching equilibrium was 0.912 before\nmatching and 0.738 after matching. There were\nno unbalanced covariates with an absolute value\n>0.25 in the standardized mean difference.\nSurvival was analyzed using the Kaplan\u00adMeier\nmethod and log-rank test. Continuous variables\nwere analyzed by the Student's t test and cate-\ngorical variables were analyzed using the Chi-\nsquared test or Fisher's exact test. p values\n<0.05 were considered significant. Statistical\nanalyses were performed using SPSS v.23.0\n(IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). PSM for\nSPSS (version 1.0), which was programmed by\nFelix Thoemmes (Cornell University), was used\nwith the underlying R packages (MatchIt,\nResult\nBaseline clinical characteristics\nA total of 649 patients were classified as patients\nin the NC group, while 51 patients with follow-up\nduration <1 year, 83 patients with only one\nimage, and 56 patients with insufficient medical\nrecords were excluded. Finally, 428 patients were\nincluded in the NC group, with exclusion of other\ndisease by additional evaluations such as acces-\nsory spleen, metastatic cancer, neuroendocrine\ntumor (NET) and main duct or mixed type\nIPMN.

Two patients\nwere described as having a specific finding, with\ndegeneration with foamy histiocytic infiltration in\none, and grayish fibrosis around pericystic paren-\nchyme in the other. There was no recurrence after\nsurgery during the study period (Table 3). In addi-\ntion, there were no difficult operations due to the\nsevere fibrosis or adhesion and no evidence of dis-\nsemination related to EUS-EA. The duration from\nmonths and the duration from EUS-EA to surgery\nwho underwent surgery, postoperative chronic\ndyspepsia was confirmed in three patients. Surgery\nwas performed for various reasons, including con-\nstantly or rapidly growing cysts, newly developed\nrisky features, patient concern and planned simul-\ntaneous laparotomy for another tumor. A patient\nwho underwent EUS-EA for SCN was found to\nhave liver metastases during follow up and the\nresults of liver biopsy revealed they were metastatic\nlesions of the NET. Surgery was performed and\nSCN with traces of EUS-EA adjacent to 1.1 cm of\nNET (grade 3, pT3N0) without cystic change\nwere identified.\nTreatment response of EUS-guided ethanol\nablation for PCLs\nTreatment responses of the EUS-EA group\nbefore matching (n = 118) are shown in Figure\n3. No patient underwent more than one EUS-EA\nfor the same lesion. The ratio of the last and\ninitial size was calculated to evaluate the treat-\nment response. The CR rate of each PCLs was\nindeterminate cysts. The ratio of over half size\nand 51.3% for indeterminate cysts. There were\nonly three cysts more than twice as large as the\ninitial size after EUS-EA. Seven patients under-\nwent surgery who had been treated with\nEUS-EA. One patient underwent EUS-EA and\nwas followed up for sustained cyst. Because the\nsize of the cyst slowly increased and a mural\nnodule was observed, the patient underwent\npylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy at\n88.6 months after EUS-EA and IPMN-\nassociated invasive carcinoma (pT1N0M0) was\ndiagnosed. All other patients were found to have\nno malignant portion.\nThe comparison data for the two groups after\nPSM for the change in size are as follows: the size\nreduction differed significantly between groups [p\ngrowth showed no significant difference (p =\nDiscussion\nSurgery for PCLs is the only curative and the most\nimportant treatment, but it can lead to a deterio-\nration in QOL. Some patients underwent unnec-\nessary surgery because of the ambiguity of exact\nsurgical indications. As understanding of the NC\nand malignant potential of PCLs develops, the\nmanagement has gradually become more conserv-\native.8,20,21 Several studies of feasibility and safety\nof EUS-EA have been conducted and have shown\na certain amount of CR (Table 4). However, there\nhas been no comparative analysis of how EUS-EA\naffects clinical benefits such as survival gain and\nmaintenance of QOL. This study showed that\nEUS-EA might not be able to provide survival\ngain, but it is able to provide clinical benefits\nincluding maintenance of QOL by avoidance of\nunnecessary surgery and a certain level of CR for\nPCLs with low risk of malignancy.\nTreatment of PCLs with EUS-EA did not signifi-\ncantly improve survival compared with the NC\ngroup in this study. Survival in these patients\nseems to be determined by the severity of the\naccompanying comorbidities, because patients\nwhose cause of death could be identified were\nfound to have died because of worsened underly-\ning disease or newly developed fatal disease.\nModerate to severe levels of comorbidity were\nfound in 40% of the mortality cases, which was\nsignificantly higher than that of the whole patients.\nThese results are in line with those of previous\nstudies that showed most of the PCLs without\nany risk factors were unlikely to cause mortality or\nmorbidity because of their benign disease course\nsuspicious features had a lower risk of pancreatic\nmalignancy in recent studies than in previous\nstudies based on surgical series.

(Continued)\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 11\n10 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\nof surgical mortality and malignancy detection\nrate in the surveillance group has significant\nimplications.1,23 Therefore, it is very important to\nconsider the patient's QOL when treating PCLs.\nThe QOL of patients with PCLs may have been\ndetermined by morbidity caused by surgery,\npsychological anxiety for malignancy, and medi-\ncal economic burden. The long-term adverse\nevents associated with postoperative morbidity\nwere significantly less in the EUS-EA group\nthan in the NC group. We estimated the average\neconomic burden, including the procedure or\nsurgery fee, hospitalization fee, and surveillance\nfee per patient, of the EUS-EA group to be\n$3146 (USD) and that of the NC group to be\ndiagnosis based on the Korean medical price\nand our medical policy (p = 0.102). Therefore,\nmanagement of PCLs including EUS-EA seems\nto reduce the medical economic burden while\nalso reducing the possibility of the patient suf-\nfering from morbidity due to surgery. We believe\nthat EUS-EA can be considered a minimally\ninvasive treatment option in the management of\nPCLs with low risk of malignancy and clearly be\nhelpful to the patient by preventing deteriora-\ntion of QOL by reducing unnecessary surgery.\nDespite expected advantages with guaranteed\nfeasibility and safety of EUS-EA, some experts\nhave a negative view of the real long-term efficacy\nof EUS-EA because of the low CR ratio in muci-\nnous neoplasm.22 Moreover, controversies exist\nregarding the potential for missing proper surgery\nfor premalignant lesions.26,27 The PSM compara-\ntive analysis in this study produced the following\nmeaningful findings. First, it seems possible to\nmanage PCLs without unnecessary surgery by\nproviding additional treatment options (4.8%\nand 36.4% of mucinous cysts with low-grade dys-\nplasia did not require surgery according to the\nsurgical pathology of the NC group. In our opin-\nion, unnecessary surgery was more likely to be\nperformed in the NC group because there are\nonly two options in the treatment of PCLs: sur-\ngery or surveillance. Second, the results of surgi-\ncal pathology suggest that the treatment strategy\nwith EUS-EA showed no tendency to miss the\nappropriate treatment opportunity for malignant\ntransformed PCLs. It seems possible to opt for\nFigure 3.

Patients with PCLs\nreaching CR may be able to increase the interval\nof examination and relieve the psychological pres-\nsure regarding malignant transformation.\nHowever, it is difficult to use EUS-EA as an alter-\nnative treatment for surgery for three reasons.\nFirst, the effects on some types of PCLs has been\nshown to be low based on data from this and pre-\nvious studies. The results of defining the CR\nusing the volume criteria show that the success\nrate is high, but the actual volume decreased to\n<5%, indicating that about one-third of the\nlength was sustained. Therefore, follow up is not\nterminated even for PCLs with CR based on vol-\nume criteria after EUS-EA. Second, it has not\nbeen confirmed that EUS-EA can actually pre-\nvent malignant transformation. DeWitt and col-\nleagues reported in molecular-level studies that\nEUS-guided ablation with ethanol and paclitaxel\nmay eliminate mutant DNA in PCLs,15 but fur-\nther molecular-level and pathologic data are\nneeded to reach a conclusion. Third, EUS-EA\nwill proceed with uncertain diagnosis at the time\nof the procedure. Depending on the presumed\ndiagnosis, which is confirmed afterwards by cystic\nfluid analysis, it is possible to predict the response\nafter EUS-EA and the decision about the neces-\nsity for surgery or close follow up. If a center is\navailable with confocal laser endomicroscopy,\nthis will provide more accurate information about\nthe diagnosis and help to determine whether or\nnot to perform the procedure.28,29 Considering\nthese aspects, it is more reasonable for EUS-EA\nto act as an affordable and feasible treatment\noption with its own indications rather than as an\nalternative to surgery.\nThis study has several limitations. First, there are\ndefinite limitations to application of the data for\na comparative study because this was a retrospec-\ntive observational study. However, PSM was per-\nformed to minimize differences in baseline\nclinical and lesion characteristics between study\ngroups. Second, the results in this study are\nbased on the presumed diagnosis of PCLs by\nimaging studies or cystic fluid analysis. It is\nimportant to note that decision-making should\nbe made under uncertain situations in real\npractice. Third, the evaluation of the EUS-EA\nresponse was conducted by comparing the\nsize of the first and the last image. We did not\nanalyze whether the size increased after decline,\nTable 4.

Fourth,\nQOL was not quantitatively assessed, and the\nexact causal relationship between QOL and post-\noperative morbidity of the patients who under-\nwent surgery was not investigated in our study.\nIn order to compensate for this, we have also dis-\ncussed the economic aspects of EUS-EA as\nclosely as possible to suggest that it has a positive\neffect on the maintenance of QOL.\nThere are several strengths of this study. First, we\nfocused on the clinical implications of EUS-EA\nrather than the success of the procedure itself,\nunlike previous studies. Second, as far as we\nknow, this is the first comparative study of long-\nterm clinical benefits such as survival gain, avoid-\nance of surgery and CR in a large number of\npatients. The prospective randomization compar-\nisons of EUS-EA that could respond to CR and\nsurveillance without treatment seemed to be ethi-\ncally unacceptable. Third, the outcomes are more\nrobust based on the PSM method than those\nreflected in previous single-arm studies. Fourth,\nCR criteria were strictly defined and analyzed\nbecause of the slow-growing nature of PCLs and\nlimited ways to verify the absence of a viable por-\ntion after EUS-EA.\nIn conclusion, EUS-EA might not be able to pro-\nvide a survival benefit, but could be able to gener-\nate clinical benefits including maintenance of\nQOL by avoidance of unnecessary surgery and a\ncertain level of CR in patients with PCLs with low\nrisk of malignancy. Based on the first comparison\ndata for treatment of PCLs, EUS-EA could be\nconsidered a useful treatment option for PCLs\nwith lower risk of malignancy and a complemen-\ntary treatment option for patients with high risk of\nsurgery, but careful application is needed because\nof the limited effects when applied to some types\nof PCLs.\nAuthor contributions\nJin Ho Choi: acquisition of data, analysis and\ninterpretation of data, drafting of the manuscript,\nstatistical analysis.
