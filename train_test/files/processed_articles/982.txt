Pearson correlation coef\u00aecients were\ncalculated to identify nutrient intake correlates of energy density. Replacing energy density with its nutrient\ncorrelates (3 day mean estimates of fat, protein, \u00aeber and water intakes) in the models predicting energy intake and\noverweight status, the independent effects of speci\u00aec nutrients were investigated.\nResults: Energy density was positively and signi\u00aecantly associated with energy intake and overweight status.\nEnergy density was signi\u00aecantly correlated with every nutrient examined, although the correlations were weak for\nmost variables except water intake. Only water intake behaved consistently across analyses. It was negatively\ncorrelated with energy density, negatively, signi\u00aecantly and independently associated with energy intake as well as\noverweight status. Despite positive associations with energy intake, fat and protein intake were not signi\u00aecant\npredictors of overweight status. Fiber intake was strongly and positively associated with overweight status.\nConclusions: Of the nutrients examined, only water intake appeared to explain the effects of energy density on\nenergy intake and overweight status.\nDescriptors: energy density; overweight; water intake; China\nIntroduction\nAlthough high-fat diets have been linked with hyperphagia\nas well as overweight status and obesity, the causal\nmechanisms underlying this relationship have not been\nelucidated. In recent reviews of the clinical andaor epide-\nmiologic literature, several authors have concluded that\nhyperphagia related to high-fat diets cannot be attributed\nsimply to the fat content of the diet (Poppitt, 1995; Prentice\nPoppitt (1995) writes `recent evidence from both animal\nand human studies has shown that over-consumption on a\nhigh-fat diet is not due to the fat content per se, but rather\nin combination with the high energy content. It is only\nhigh-fat, high-energy foods, not high-fat foods alone that\nlead to hyperphagia'. Efforts to pinpoint the causal factor(s)\nhave been confounded by the effects of energy density and\nnutrient colinearity.\nPrentice & Poppitt (1996), in their review of all long-\nterm ( b 24 h) diet manipulation studies, conclude that\nchanges in energy density appear to be crucial to the\ncontrol of energy intake. When the energy density of all\nexperimental foods is manipulated, the obligatory change\nin energy density is directly related to change in energy\nintake. `When selecting an energy-dense diet, individuals\nreadily consume a suf\u00aecient weight of food to maintain a\nhigh energy intake. However, when selecting a low energy-\ndense diet, individuals appear unable to eat suf\u00aecient\nweight of food to maintain a high intake and consequently\nenergy intake falls. The management of weight mainte-\nnance andaor weight loss may be achieved by eating a diet\nof low energy density (p 169)'. Results from existing\nclinical studies of covertly manipulated energy density\n*Correspondence: J Dunmeyer Stookey, Carolina Population Center, CB\nNo. 8120 University Square, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,\nE-mail: jstookey@email.unc.edu\nGuarantor: JD Stookey.\nContributor: Hypothesis, data analysis and manuscript preparation all\ncompleted by JD Stookey.\nwww.nature.com/ejcn\n1991) show a positive association between energy density\nand weight change. If energy density consistently predicts\nenergy intake and weight change, what then is the under-\nlying mechanism?\nIdentifying the mechanism(s) underlying the consis-\ntently observed effects of energy density on energy intake\nand weight change is complicated by the amorphous nature\nof energy density. Unlike speci\u00aec nutrients such as vitamin\nC, the structure of energy density is not a constant. Energy\ndensity, the energy content per weight or volume of food,\nhas many determinants (energy intake, total bulk, volume\nor weight), and can re\u00afect a spectrum of diets of different\ncompositions. The above referenced studies of energy\ndensity have involved qualitatively different experimental\ndiets, produced by the addition or subtraction of water,\narti\u00aecial sweeteners, thickeners, andaor butterfat to liquid\ndiets, or by altering the fat, pasta or vegetable content of\nsolid diets. Although not reported in most studies, the\nintended dietary manipulation (eg subtractionaaddition of\nfat) necessarily caused shifts in the macro-, micro- and non-\nnutrient pro\u00aeles of the experimental diets. Lissner et al\n(1987) report shifts in macronutrient composition from\ncarbohydrate, respectively, on the medium-fat diet to 15 \u00b1\ndiet, respectively. Using thickening agents in their dietary\nmanipulations, Stubbs et al (1998) found signi\u00aecant\nchanges in water and \u00aeber intakes, as well as protein, fat\nand carbohydrate intakes. Since any of the component\nalterations could ultimately be responsible for the observed\neffects, it is not clear what mechanism mediates the effects\nof energy density. Studies that alter energy density by\naltering only one dietary component at a time are needed\nto tease apart the effects.\nThis paper uses observational data to explore what dietary\nconstituents might be responsible for associations between\nenergy density, energy intake and weight status among free-\nliving individuals. Nutrient correlates of energy density are\nincluded together in multivariable models to evaluate each\nnutrient effect holding the other nutrients constant.\nMethods\nData\nCross-sectional data from the 1991 China Health and\nNutrition Surveys (CHNS) for adults aged 20 \u00b1 59 y were\nused for this analysis. The CHNS was designed to study\nfactors affecting individual food choice, nutrient intake and\nnutritional status, with a focus on dietary patterns asso-\nciated with nutritional de\u00aecit or excess. The sampling\nframe and survey methodology have been described in\ndetail previously (Popkin et al, 1995; Paeratakul et al,\n1998). Trained Chinese interviewers obtained detailed\nindividual-level diet data via 24 h recall for three consecu-\ntive days as well as household-level information on\nchanges in food inventory. The household-level data was\nused to estimate individual consumption of edible oil (Guo\net al, 1999), as well as to cross-check the diet recall data. In\naddition to the dietary data, information was available on\nage (y), gender, income, urbanarural residence (according\nto the Chinese census de\u00aenition), smoking status (past,\nnever), height, weight and physical activity. Body weight\nand height were measured on each individual by trained\nhealth workers. Physical activity was determined based on\nregular daily occupations, and recorded as a multilevel\nvariable (very light, light, moderate, heavy). Very light\nactivity was characterized by working in a sitting position\nor as an of\u00aece worker; light activity as work in a standing\nposition; moderate activity as work carried out by drivers or\nelectricians; and heavy activity as the work of farmers. The\nactivity variable was designed by the Chinese Nutrition\nSociety to re\u00afect total energy expenditure, and intended for\nuse in calculating the Chinese RDAs. The variable sig-\nni\u00aecantly predicts energy intake and weight status among\nChinese adults (Paeratakul et al, 1998). The CHNS follows\nhuman subjects approval procedures that have been\napproved both by the University of North Carolina\nSchool of Public Health and Chinese Academy of\nPreventive Medicine human subjects protection committees.\nThe 1991 food composition table (FCT) for China\n(INFH-CAPM, 1991) was used to calculate mean daily\nenergy and nutrient intakes from the food consumption data\nfor each individual. Energy density was calculated by\ndividing the reported mean energy intake by the total\ngrams consumed. Energy intakes from all of the foods\nand beverages included in the 1991 FCT were included in\nthe calculation of total energy intake. As the FCT and\nassociated CHNS datasets only include a few beverages\n(milk, coconut juice, sugarcane juice, spirits, beer, wine,\nchampagne and brandy), the energy intake estimates in this\npaper speci\u00aecally include energy from foods, milk, coconut\njuice, sugarcane juice and alcohol. The mean water and\n\u00aeber (non-starch polysaccharide) intakes were expressed\nper unit of energy intake to distinguish between diets high\nand low in these nutrients. Body mass index (BMI) was\ncalculated as weight (kg)aheight (m2). Subjects were clas-\nsi\u00aeed as normal or overweight using the World Health\nand subjects with missing data were excluded from the\nStatistical analyses\nEffect of energy density on energy intake and weight\nstatus. Separate ordinary-least squares (OLS) regression\nmodels were \u00aet to evaluate the relationship between energy\ndensity (kJag) and mean daily energy intake, and energy\ndensity and total amount of foods consumed. These models\ncontrolled for age, gender, income, urbanarural residence,\nsmoking status, activity level and height. Height was\nincluded in the models as a proxy for body-size-related\ndietary requirements.\nEnergy density, energy intake and overweight status\nJD Stookey\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nCrude and multivariable logistic regression models were\n\u00aetted to test for a positive association between energy\ndensity and overweight status. Again, age, gender,\nincome, urbanarural residence, smoking status, activity\nlevel and height were included in the multivariable\nmodels as covariates. Energy intake was not included in\nthese models, since it is intermediate along the hypothe-\nsized causal pathway between energy density and over-\nweight status. In epidemiologic analyses, it is considered\ninappropriate to control for intermediate variables (Roth-\nman, 1986). In an additional model, the total amount of\nfoods consumed, a potentially independent factor regulat-\ning energy intake, was also controlled. If determined by\nvisualalearned portion size cues or limitations of stomach\nsize or gastric emptying (Hunt, 1980), the total amount of\nfood consumed may lead to overweight by a causal path-\nway independent of energy density. Given that the amount\nconsumed correlates with energy density, this potentially\nindependent determinant might confound the association\nbetween energy density and weight status. Holding constant\nthe quantity consumed, the additional model focuses on the\neffect of qualitative differences in the composition (energy\ndensity) of reported diets. The total amount consumed was\nnot included in models predicting energy intake, since\nenergy intake is the product of this covariate and energy\ndensity, (g consumed)*\n(kJag consumed).\nNutrient \u00b1 energy density intercorrelations. Given that\nprevious researchers have reported shifts in fat, protein,\ncarbohydrate, \u00aeber and water intakes with changes in\nthese nutrients were identi\u00aeed as potential correlates andaor\ndeterminants of energy density. Each of these nutrients\ncontributes to energy intake or to the bulk, weight or\nvolume of the food consumed. Poppitt (1995) has shown\nthat the fat content of foods listed in the McCance &\nWiddowson food composition table varies directly with\nenergy density. Figure 1 illustrates that the fat, carbohy-\ndrate, protein, \u00aeber and water contents of foods listed in the\n1991 Food Composition Table for China also vary with\nenergy density. To determine to what extent the overall\nnutrient intakes (the nutrient content of the whole diet as\ndistinct from the nutrient contents of speci\u00aec foods) line-\narly covary with energy density in this sample, Pearson\ncorrelation coef\u00aecients were calculated.\nAlthough the following analyses focus on fat, protein,\ncarbohydrate, \u00aeber and water intakes, we realize that these\nnutrients may serve as proxy measures for other nutrient\ncorrelates of energy density. Macro- and micronutrients are\nknown to correlate with energy intake and the quantity\nconsumed \u00d0 greater food consumption leading to higher\nintakes in general (Willett & Stampfer, 1998a,b). Nutrients\nand non-nutrients that are correlated with energy density\nmay be represented by one or more of the selected\nnutrients, eg fat-soluble nutrients by fat intakes, and\nwater-soluble vitamins, minerals and electrolytes by water\nintake. To get a sense of between-nutrient intercorrelations,\nPearson correlation coef\u00aecients were also calculated for\nother available nutrient intakes.\nIn recognition that high-fat, high-energy (HFHE) diets\nhave been an important and controversial focus of research\non appetite regulation and weight control (Bray & Popkin,\nHFHE diets were examined and compared with diets\nlower in fat and energy. Diets with fat and energy intakes\nabove the 75th percentile for this sample (32% of energy\nand 13 080 kJ, respectively) were compared with diets\nmedium in fat and energy (MFME: 25 \u00b1 75th percentile\nfor both nutrients) and diets low in fat and energy\n(LFLE: ` 25th percentile for both nutrients).\nEffects of nutrient correlates of energy density on energy\nintake and overweight status. Next, the OLS and logistic\nregression models with energy density as the main expo-\nsure (described above) were re-\u00aetted with energy density\nreplaced by its nutrient correlates. Fat (percentage of\nenergy), protein (percentage of energy), \u00aeber (gakJ) and\nwater (gakJ) intakes were entered as independent variables\npredicting energy intake and overweight status. Carbohy-\ndrate intake was included in these models by default as the\nreference category. The models are essentially what Willett\nand Stampfer (1998b) refer to as `multivariate nutrient\ndensity models', which are useful for the study of the\neffects of several nutrients simultaneously. These models\nexamine the effects of speci\u00aec nutrients holding other\nnutrients constant. Model speci\u00aecation was chosen so as\nnot to violate model assumptions as well as retain clear\ninterpretation of the results. The nutrients were entered as\nuntransformed continuous variables, since the nutrient-out-\ncome bivariate distributions did not violate the model\nassumptions for linearity. All nutrients were rescaled so\nthat their minimum value was zero and the reference\ncategory for these models was diets with the lowest\npercentage energy from fat and protein, lowest \u00aeber and\nwater content. The reference category, thus, consists of\ndiets high in carbohydrate, low in protein, fat, \u00aeber and\nwater. Explicitly, a one-unit increase in fat or protein intake\nin these models necessarily implies a shift in diet composi-\ntion of a 1% decrease in energy from carbohydrate. Since\n\u00aeber and water intakes are not energy-yielding nutrients, a\none-unit increase in either of these nutrients does not imply\na shift in energy from carbohydrate. Model coef\u00aecients for\nwater and \u00aeber intake re\u00afect the comparison between diets\nhigh in carbohydrate, low in protein, fat, water and \u00aeber\nand diets high in carbohydrate, low in protein and fat, but\nhigher in water or \u00aeber. Age, gender, income, urbanarural\nresidence, smoking status, activity level and height were\nincluded in the models as covariates. Lastly, to replicate\nprevious analyses of fat intake and overweight status where\nnutrient covariates were not held constant, protein, fat and\nwater intakes were dropped from the full model predicting\noverweight status.\nThe Stata statistical program (StataCorp, 1999) was used\nfor all of the above analyses.\nEnergy density, energy intake and overweight status\nJD Stookey\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nResults\nDescriptive sociodemographic and dietary intake data are\nshown in Table 1. Overweight subjects consumed sig-\nni\u00aecantly less energy and total grams of food. The diets\nof overweight subjects were higher in energy density\nwith a P-value of 0.06. On average, overweight subjects\nhad higher fat, protein and \u00aeber (as percentage of\nenergy) intakes, and signi\u00aecantly lower carbohydrate\nand water intakes than normal-weight subjects. Consis-\ntent with current knowledge, overweight status was\nassociated with older age, female sex, urban residence,\nFigure 1 Correlations between fat, protein, carbohydrate, \u00aeber and water contents and energy density for foods in the 1991 China Food Composition Table.\nEnergy density, energy intake and overweight status\nJD Stookey\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nhigher income, non-smoking status, and reduced activity\nlevel.\nEnergy density as predictor of energy intake and\noverweight status\nThe mean (s.d.) energy density of foods consumed by this\n(0.4) kcalag). Energy density was positively and signi\u00ae-\ncantly associated with energy intake. Adjusting for age,\ngender, urban residence, income, smoking status, activity\nlevel and height, a one unit increase in energy density\n(kJag) was associated with an increase in energy intake of\nthis effect, the difference in predicted energy intake for\nsubjects at the 25th and 75th percentiles of the energy\ndensity distribution (9.5 and 11.9 kJ, respectively) for this\nsample was 734 kJ. Energy density was also negatively and\nsigni\u00aecantly associated with the total amount of foods\nconsumed (g), controlling for the same covariates (model\n2). The results from sex-speci\u00aec models did not differ (data\nnot shown).\nCrude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) were calculated to\nestimate the effect of increasing energy density on over-\nweight status (see Table 2, models 3 and 4). For a one unit\nincrease in energy density (kJag), the crude likelihood of\n1.08). For a one unit increase in energy density expressed\nas kcalag, the crude likelihood of overweight increased by\ngender, urban residence, income, smoking status, activity\ndensity was expressed in kcalag units. Energy density\nappeared to be even more strongly associated with over-\nweight status after also controlling for the total amount of\nCorrelations between energy density and speci\u00aec nutrients\nEnergy density was signi\u00aecantly correlated with the fat,\nprotein, carbohydrate, \u00aeber and water content of the diets\nconsumed (see Table 3). While total fat intake was posi-\ntively correlated with energy density, the other four nutri-\nents were negatively correlated. The strongest of these\ncorrelations (r  0.91) was observed between energy den-\nsity and water intake (see Figure 2). The remaining nutri-\nent-energy density correlations ranged between 0.10 and\n0.20. Not surprisingly, Table 3 also indicates that fat-\nsoluble vitamin E and cholesterol covaried with fat\nintake, and water-soluble calcium, potassium and vitamin\nC correlated with water intake. Table 4 shows the nutrient\npro\u00aeles of diets varying in fat and energy composition. The\nHFHE diets differed signi\u00aecantly from the lower fat\nand energy diets in several respects. HFHE diets were\nTable 1 Characteristics of adults aged 20 \u00b1 59 y participating in the 1991 China Health and Nutrition Surveys\nNormal weight Overweight\nMean (s.d.) Mean (s.d.)

Results are presented for both\nsexes together, as the results of sex-speci\u00aec models did\nnot differ and sex interactions in the combined model were\nnot statistically signi\u00aecant. Multicollinearity was not\nobserved in the multivariate nutrient density models (var-\niance in\u00afation factors ` 10). Models 1 and 5 (Tables 2 and\n5) explained a similar proportion of the variation in energy\nintake (adjusted R2 % 17%). Controlling for age, gender,\nheight, activity, smoking status, urban residence, income,\nfat and protein intakes (as percentage of energy) were\nindependently, positively and signi\u00aecantly (P ` 0.10 for\nprotein) associated with energy intake.

To\nbrie\u00afy summarize the results: in this sample of Chinese\nadults, energy density was positively and signi\u00aecantly\nassociated with energy intake and overweight status.\nEnergy density was signi\u00aecantly correlated with every\nnutrient we examined, although the correlations were\nweak for most variables except water intake. When\nenergy density was replaced by its nutrient correlates in\nmodels predicting energy intake, fat and protein intake\nappeared positively associated with energy intake, while\n\u00aeber and water intakes were negatively associated with\nenergy intake. Despite their signi\u00aecant or almost signi\u00aecant\nassociations with energy intake, fat and protein intake were\nnot signi\u00aecant predictors of overweight status. Contrary to\nexpectation, given the negative correlation with energy\ndensity and energy intake, \u00aeber intake was strongly and\npositively associated with overweight status. Water intake\nwas the only nutrient to behave consistently across ana-\nlyses. It was negatively correlated with energy density, and\nnegatively, signi\u00aecantly and independently associated with\nenergy intake as well as overweight status.\nIn an attempt to understand how dietary energy density\nexerts its effects, we took advantage of detailed multi-\nfaceted data from the CHNS to examine the big picture of\nenergy density in a single sample of adults \u00d0 how energy\ndensity covaries with the quantity consumed, various nutri-\nent intakes and weight status in a single sample of adults.\nTo date, this is the only study in free-living individuals of\nthe effects of energy density on both energy intake and\nweight status that also controls for relevant covariates.\nPrentice & Poppitt (1996) report the existence of associa-\ntions between energy density and energy intake in data\nfrom the Cambridge Family Food Survey and the MRC\nNational Survey of Health and Development, but do not\nshow these results, and explicitly state that the associations\nwere not adjusted for activity or body size. There is no\nTable 3 Pearson correlation matrix of energy density with selected nutrient intakes\n*Statistically signi\u00aecant pearson correlation coef\u00aecient (P ` 0.05).\nTable 4 Nutrient pro\u00aeles associated with diets differing in fat and energy content reported by free-living Chinese adults in the 1991 China Health and\nNutrition Survey\nDiet patterns de\u00aened by fat and energy intake\nMean (s.d.)

These authors\nreport \u00aending no signi\u00aecant relationship between energy\ndensity and energy intake in two of the community data\nsets they examined. Marti-Henneberg et al (1999) found a\nsigni\u00aecant correlation between energy density and BMI in\nadult males, but not in females in Spain. Given that the\nestimated effect of energy density on weight status changed\nling for covariates in this study, it seems that known risk\nfactors for overweight status may confound unadjusted\neffect estimates. Cox and Mela (2000) report correlations\nbetween BMI and energy density for some methods of\ncalculating energy density, but not others. Confounding\nbias or differences in the types of data used to calculate\nenergy density may explain divergent results across studies.\nAs energy density increased, the grams of total food\nconsumed decreased for this sample population. The results\nsuggest that, holding all other variables constant, the total\namount of food consumed decreased with increasing fat\ncontent, but increased with increasing water and protein\ncontent. These results are not entirely consistent with the\nclinical \u00aending of no signi\u00aecant difference in weight or\nvolume of food consumed with experimental diets of\nvarying energy density (Prentice & Poppitt, 1996). The\napparent compensation in the amount consumed, while not\nlarge enough to eliminate the effect of energy density on\nenergy intake, might be related to portion size cues or to\nregulatory mechanisms. Subjects consuming higher-fat\nfoods may have consciously attempted to eat less. Indeed,\nthe signi\u00aecantly lower energy intakes and total grams\nTable 5 Associations between determinants of energy density, energy intake, the total quantity consumed, and\nlikelihood of overweight status in free-living Chinese adults\nOutcome\nModel 5 Model 6 Likelihood of overweight status\nEnergy intake (kJ) Total amount consumed (g)\nIndependent variables b (s.e.) b (s.e.)

If subjects\nunder-reported consistently across all foods, they would\nhave under-reported both the numerator and denominator\nof the energy density variable (both the energy and the\ngrams consumed), and the error would cancel out. If, on the\nother hand, overweight subjects disproportionately under-\nreported foods higher in energy density, the effect would be\nto weight the energy density for the whole diet towards\nlower-energy-density foods, reducing the observed energy\ndensity, and thereby weakening any association between\nenergy density and overweight status.\nEnergy density signi\u00aecantly predicted overweight status\nafter adjusting for known covariates, including the total\namount of foods consumed. Age, gender, activity, body\nsize, socio-economic differentials, portion size, stomach\nsize- or gastric-emptying-related factors do not explain\naway this association. Energy density appeared to be\nassociated with energy intake and weight status in this\nlarge free-living population as it does in more restrictive\nclinical settings.\nAs expected, all of the nutrient intakes examined were\nsigni\u00aecantly correlated with dietary energy density. Energy\ndensity directly covaried with fat intake and indirectly\ncovaried with water and \u00aeber intakes. Considering that\nprotein contributes to total energy intake and is positively\ncorrelated with fat intake, the negative correlation between\nprotein intake and energy density was unexpected. The\nweak correlations between energy density and all of the\nnutrients, except water, were also unexpected. These\nunexpected results may be related to true aspects of\nChinese food consumption patterns (ie protein may\nbe consumed with energy-dilute foods such as vege-\ntables), to measurement errors or limitations of the food\ncomposition table.\nThe between-nutrient correlations and between-diet\ncomparisons of nutrient pro\u00aeles illustrate the complex\nnature of this nutritional epidemiologic problem. Energy\ndensity covaries with a spectrum of nutrients, making it\ndif\u00aecult to pinpoint which nutrient is responsible for the\nobserved effects. Nutrients covary with other nutrients,\nagain making it dif\u00aecult to interpret the effect of a parti-\ncular nutrient. Is one nutrient acting as proxy for another?\nIn this paper, fat-soluble nutrients were found to covary\nwith fat intake, and water-soluble nutrients to covary with\nwater intake. Thus, theoretically, before ruling out potential\nroles for such nutrients, it would be premature to conclude\nfrom the present results that fat or water intakes mediate the\neffects of energy density.\nThe models in this paper essentially examine the effects\nof water and water-soluble nutrient intakes holding con-\nstant fat and fat-soluble nutrient intakes, protein and \u00aeber.\nConsistent with the literature on HF, HE diets (Poppit,\nWillett, 1998), high energy intakes were not attributable to\nfat and fat-soluble nutrient intakes in this study.\nGiven the strong positive association observed between\n\u00aeber intake and overweight status, it is unlikely that \u00aeber\nintakes explain the protective effects of energy-dilute diets.\nWater intake and its correlates are left as the most likely\ncandidates for further research. Clinical studies of water\nincorporated into foods and satiety provide support for a\nkey role for dietary water intake (Rolls et al, 1999).\nThe results of this study \u00aet well with the data on water\nincorporated into foods. The water intake variable used in\nthese analyses was calculated from data on foods and\nenergy-yielding beverages consumed over a 3-day period\nfor the purpose of studying energy intake, nutritional\nde\u00aecits or excess. This data was carefully cross-checked\nagainst changes in household food inventory. Despite the\ndetailed quality of this data, information on water intake as\na beverage may be lacking since this non-energy yielding\nnutrient was not a focus of this survey. The only beverages\nincluded in the survey were coconut juice, sugarcane juice,\nmilk and alcoholic beverages. The water intake variable\nused for these analyses is more representative of food water\nintake than of total water intake. According to results from\nRolls et al (1999), the available variable may be the\nbiologically relevant exposure, however. These authors\nfound that consuming foods with a high water content\nmore effectively reduced subsequent energy intake than\ndrinking water with food. Although a preload of soup\ndecreased subsequent energy intake, a casserole containing\nthe same ingredients (type and amount) that was served\nwith water did not affect satiety. Cox and Mela (2000) also\nreport that energy density calculated from all food, milk\nand alcohol (the same components as the variable in this\nstudy), excluding other non-alcoholic beverages was sig-\nni\u00aecantly associated with obesity.\nEnergy density appears to in\u00afuence the regulation of\nenergy intake and weight control even under covert condi-\ntions when portion size cues or learned behaviors are\nKendall et al, 1991). The underlying biological mechanism\nmust therefore involve regulatory processes. Although\nspeculative, the tight regulation of water intake, hydration\nstatus, and water metabolism may be involved in regulating\ndietary intake. Unlike fat intake, which has been shown to\nbe poorly regulated (see Prentice & Poppitt, 1996), water\nintake, hydration status and water metabolism are tightly\ncontrolled at several levels by osmoregulatory mechanisms,\nthe renin \u00b1 angiotensin system, intracellular signaling cas-\ncades, and gene transcription (Yancey et al, 1982; McMa-\n1996). That water metabolism is a function of osmolytes\nmay explain why water incorporated into foodsasolution\nhas a different effect from water intake alone. Future\nstudies might examine how energy density and energy\nintake vary with vasopressin levels.\nIn conclusion, this observational study explored the\neffects of nutrient correlates of energy density on energy\nintake and overweight status among Chinese adults. Of the\nnutrients examined, only dietary water intake appeared to\nEnergy density, energy intake and overweight status\nJD Stookey\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nexplain the effects of energy density on energy intake and\noverweight status. The generalizability of these \u00aendings to\nother populations may be limited given the relatively high\ncarbohydrate and low fat intakes prevalent in China. Long-\nitudinal studies are needed to con\u00aerm the associations\nobserved in this cross-sectional study.\n"
