In this article, the word visualization refers to\nthe graphic display of information and knowledge. From a\npragmatic point of view, a compilation and classification of\npitfalls of visuals can be used as an instructional tool, to pro-\nvide a comprehensive list, a vocabulary and definition of rel-\nevant terms related to the risks of visualization. Practitioners\ncould profit from such a classification by using it as a check-\nlist, against which they can test images and improve document\ndesign, infographics, or digital images.\nDespite the notable number of publications on the bene-\nfits of using visual representations in a variety of fields\n(Meyer, H\u00f6llerer, Jancsary, & Van Leeuwen, 2013), few\nstudies have systematically investigated the possible pitfalls\nthat exist when creating or interpreting visual representa-\ntions. Some information visualization researchers, however,\nhave raised the issue and called to action: \"Articles on limita-\ntions and pitfalls [of visualization] are scarce.

We argue that this is an\nimportant step in visualization research to use as a basis for the\nfuture development of guidelines and rules for visualization\ndevelopers and users, and for instructors. To compile a list of\nrisks of visualization, we have screened studies from multiple\nrelated research domains. We have focused on the visual repre-\nsentation of information and thus did not analyze areas such as\nfine arts, photography, film, or scientific imaging.\nWe structure the article by starting with a review of visual-\nization literature. In the third section, we provide a classifica-\ntion populated with reported disadvantages of visualizations.\nWe then present examples of how to utilize the classification\nfor evaluating and improving graphic representations of\ninformation. We end with the conclusions and an outlook for\nfuture research.\nOur aim with the present work is not to diminish the poten-\ntial of visualization. It is rather an attempt to deepen and struc-\ntureourunderstandingofitspossiblelimitationsandconstraints.\nThis is relevant not only to avoid or detect mistakes in the pro-\nduction and interpretation of visualization applications, but\nalso as a teaching tool to foster visual literacy.\nA Review of Literature\nTo survey the current state of research on the pitfalls of visu-\nalization, we have analyzed 51 articles published in peer-\nreviewed journals and books in 6 main fields of research\nrelated to visual representations: (a) statistical graphic repre-\nsentations, (b) visual literacy and visual communication, (c)\ninformation visualization and human\u00adcomputer interaction\n(HCI), (d) management studies, and (e) cross-cultural studies\nrelated to visualization. These fields have been selected for\ntheir coverage of characteristics of visual representations.\nAlthough several other fields have addressed the effects of\nvisualization--such as film studies, sociology, architecture,\nor education--we have consciously chosen to set the bound-\naries of this classification to those areas that are closely\nrelated to the graphical displays of information. In Table 1,\nwe have compiled a list of all the pitfalls of visualization\nfound in the research reviewed in these fields.Abrief descrip-\ntion of each disadvantage is provided in the Table 2.\nWe witness the earliest and most comprehensive collec-\ntions of visual representation pitfalls in the area of statistical\ngraphic representations. The main approach in this area has\nbeen to showcase particularly bad examples of visualized sta-\ntistical information and to learn from them. This has been\n2007) popular books in which he highlights numerous ways\nin which visualization falls short of its potential. In his works,\nhe uses several anecdotal examples of graphics that fail to tell\nthe truth. He goes on to explain why and how they fail, for\nexample, by measuring their \"lie factor\" (given by the size of\nthe effect shown in the graph divided by the size of the actual\neffect found in the data). Similarly, Wainer points out 10\ntypical pitfalls in visualizing information in his article, \"How\nto display data badly\" (Wainer, 1984). His ironic counter-\nrecommendations are as follows: (a) Minimize the data den-\nsity, (b) minimize the data\u00adink ratio, (c) ignore the visual\nmetaphor altogether, (d) only order matters, (e) graph data out\nof context, (f) change scale in mid-axis, (g) ignore the impor-\ntant, (h) jiggle the baseline, (i) Austria first! (ordering graph\nitems alphabetically), and (j) label illegibly, incompletely,\nincorrectly, and ambiguously. Other similar publications in\nthe field, as the popular book, \"How to Lie with Statistics\"\n(Huff, 1993), emphasize how information visualization can\nbe used to mislead.\nIn the fields of Visual Literacy and Visual Communication,\nauthors have discussed the heterogeneous interpretation of\nvisual material due to differing prior experience (Avgerinou\nof visual conventions (Avgerinou, 2007), and different cul-\nsame time, Knox's (2007) study has shown emerging con-\nventions in visual design, whereas Machin and Van Leeuwen\n(2007) have discussed the increasing institutionalization of\nvisual cues in global media (in Meyer et al., 2013).\nIn the rich and rapidly evolving domain of Information\nVisualization, we can find a broad discussion on the proper-\nties of graphic representations and their positive use, but\nfewer considerations of their potential drawbacks. In particu-\nlar, Ware (2004) identifies the underlying mechanisms of\ninformation visualization perception and brings to light\npotential issues of visualization use, including change blind-\nness, wrong salience, wrong use of color, visual stress, cul-\ntural differences, and breaking conventions. Conversely,\npsychologist Kosslyn (2006) focuses on specific formats of\ngraphic design (e.g., pie charts, bar and line graphs) and dis-\ncusses graphic representation dangers such as defocus (dis-\ntraction) and over-complexity. Van Vijk's (2006) \"Views on\nVisualization\" is one of the few articles that explicitly con-\nsiders \"consequences and limitations of visualization.\" He\nfinds that visualization can have high initial cost to be under-\nstood (when new techniques are developed), is at times sub-\njective, and can be wrong and misleading. Cawthon and\nVande Moere (2007) studied the aesthetics of data visualiza-\ntion and found that information visualizations may trigger\nunwanted emotions or distractions. Few (2006) has exten-\nsively addressed the pitfalls of graphic dashboards used in\norganizations, addressing issues such as wrong use of color,\nlow accuracy, useless decoration, and so on. Also in the spe-\ncific area of visual analytics (Thomas & Cook, 2005) and\ncollaborative visual analytics (Heer & Agrawala, 2008), the\npositive and negative mechanisms underlying the effective-\nness of visualizations are examined. In the subdomain of\nVisual Languages, researchers have examined disadvantages\nof diagrams and of notations, as for example, unevenness\nreliability appearance (Crilly, Blackwell, & Clarkson, 2006).\nIn the study of diagrams, authors have discussed the\nBresciani and Eppler 3\nlimitations and possible restrictions of a specific format, for\nexample, in the seminal study by Larkin and Simon (1987)\nand in the study on visualization over-determinism by\n(Shimoijma, 1996). In the related field of HCI, a few authors\nhave considered the potential drawbacks of interactive visu-\nalizations, but only in the context of user interfaces--and\nhow they inform or confuse users (Shneiderman, 1998).\nThe recent stream of management focusing on boundary\nobjects and sociomaterial practices explores the potential\n(and to a much lesser extent, the risks) of using visualization\nAl-Kassab, Ouertani, Schiuma, & Neely, 2014; Roos, Bart,\n& Statler, 2004). These studies typically highlight visualiza-\ntion advantages through case evidence. A subset of manage-\nment studies analyzes specifically the positive and negative\neffects of visualization for collaboration (Ewenstein &\nHales, & Tidd, 2007), also in computer-mediated settings\n(DeSanctis & Gallupe, 1987). For instance, the political use\nof images in collaborative setting may provide unequal pos-\nsibilities to contribute to the discussion (Henderson, 1995;\ncal behavior of the discussants (Nicolini, 2007) who might\npay more attention to the visual rather than to the facial\nexpressions of the group participants.\nCross-cultural studies have also addressed the differing\ninterpretation of visual representations caused by cultural\nvariations: Already in 1966, Segall, Campbell, and\nHerskovits (1966) have described the influence of culture\non visual perception. Nisbett (2003) and Nisbett and\nMiyamoto (2005) have shown through eye-tracking studies\nhow Westerners and East Asians look at images differently,\nwith Westerners focusing on the main central objects and\nEast Asians paying attention also to the background. Chan,\nLi, Diehl, and Terlutter (2007) have described cross-cultural\nvariations in consumers' response to emotional images. A\ncomprehensive review of cultural factors influencing the\nreception of visual representations of information has\nrecently been published (Bresciani, 2014), which include,\namong others, the different meaning of colors and symbols\nacross cultures, the appropriate use of visual humor in\ndiverse cultural setting, and reading direction (right to left\nfor Arabic and some Asian languages).\nIn total, we have identified more than 50 articles and\nbooks that discuss the potential pitfalls of graphic represen-\ntations of information and knowledge. We have consciously\nnot considered disadvantages related to the mere functional-\nities of specific visualization environments or software pack-\nages, instead concentrating our compilation of disadvantages\non a higher level of granularity (e.g., more conceptual short-\ncomings). From this literature review, a number of concepts\nhave emerged (see Table 1 for the complete list), with\ndiffering levels of abstraction and scope. In the next section,\nwe cluster the results in a 3 \u00d7 2 classification.\nProposed Classification of Visualization Pitfalls\nIn this section, we propose a classification of visualization\nerrors or disadvantages to structure the many factors that can\nmake a graphic representation dysfunctional, and we populate\nit with the pitfalls that we have found in the literature. A clas-\nsification of the large quantity of concepts that we have col-\nlected is necessary to structure them in an efficient and\nrelevant way, as well as to make them usable and accessible.\nThe classification that we propose, shown in the follow-\ning table (Table 1), is a matrix based on two causes of pit-\nfalls, the designer or the user, and three types of (negative)\neffects: (a) cognitive, (b) emotional, and (c) social (Buergi &\nRoos, 2003). The concepts we have collected from the litera-\nture are classified and referenced in the six resulting cells. A\nshort definition of each concept can be found in Table 2.\nMore specifically, the cause of a visualization problem\ncan be twofold: the encoding (that is, caused by the designer/\ndeveloper) or the decoding (that is, caused by the reader/\nuser; Avgerinou, 2007). In the latter case, the person who\nreads the image makes a mistake in the interpretation (Tufte,\n1986). The designer can intentionally or unintentionally\nintroduce mistakes or drawbacks in a visual representation.\nToday's interactive technologies have substantially contrib-\nuted to empowering everyone to become a designer and\nswiftly create visual representations: The classification is\nthus useful especially for non-professional creators of visual\nrepresentation who might not be familiar with design prin-\nciples. These digital technologies, especially when utilized\nin social media platforms, allow users to both consume and\ncreate visual representations: Nevertheless, the classification\nis still valuable because a person can be either the user or the\ncreator of a specific visual representation at a given time\n(although on a platform, a person can be both a user and a\ndeveloper but of different visuals). The distinction between\nproducer and user becomes even more meaningful when\nimages are shared on social media (Neher, 2013) because\ndifferent meaning can be attributed to the same visual by dif-\nferent users: It is thus important to find the origin of the\npotential problems (that is, the visual or the viewer). The dis-\ntinction between designer and user-induced mistakes is par-\nticularly valuable in pragmatic terms, as it can give immediate\ninsights for the producers and for the evaluators of visualiza-\ntions, respectively. Visualization designers should look at the\nencoding section of the schema in Table 1, while users should\npay attention to the pitfalls in the decoding section (or col-\numn) of the schema.\nConversely, the distinction between intentional and\nunintentional pitfall is at times difficult to classify, as it is not\nalways possible to discern intentionality by merely observ-\ning a visualization. Thus, intentionality cannot be used for\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 1.

(continued)\nclassification purposes, as it is often impossible to determine\nwhether a designer or author has made a genuine mistake, or\nwhether he or she intended to mislead.\nConsidering the second criterion of the classification, the\neffect of visualization drawbacks, we adopt the threefold dis-\ntinction of cognitive, emotional, and social effects (Buergi &\n2004). Similar categorizations include Norman's classification\nof the design field (Norman, 2004): He distinguishes the vis-\nceral level (corresponding to emotions), the behavioral level\n(corresponding to usability), and the reflective level (regarding\nthe meaning of things, or the self-image). This classification is\nalso consistent with social interdependency theory, developed\nin the educational context, which distinguishes cognitive,\nbehavioral, and social dimensions (Johnson & Johnson, 2005).\nOur proposed classification includes the often neglected\n\"social\" effects of visualization following the emerging trend\non collaborative information visualization (Bresciani,\nconsidered supports for collaborative sense-making and under-\nstanding. Along the same line of thought, Heer and Agrawala\n8 SAGE Open\nalthough most research to date assumes a single-user focus on\nperceptual and cognitive processes, in practice, sensemaking is often\na social process involving parallelization of effort, discussion, and\nconsensus building. Thus, to fully support sensemaking, interactive\nvisualization should also support social interaction. (p. 49)\nWe can observe that in Table 1, the list of cognitive disad-\nvantages is the most extensive section. Most of the studies\nhave focused on the cognitive effects of visualization,\nneglecting its social or emotional consequences. In the con-\ntext of visualizing organizational strategy, Roos et al. (2004)\nalso confirmed this impression: \"While social and emotional\nmodes of experience are involved in strategy process, in gen-\neral they are suppressed in favour of cognitive elements\" (p.\n551). The emotional category is referring to the most visceral\nimpact of visualization on the user's feelings, whereas the\nsocial category includes disadvantages caused by the collab-\norative use of visualizations.\nThe categorization presented has implications for practice,\nas it can support visualization users and producers to prevent,\nreduce, or eliminate visualization threats. In this sense, it can\nbe used as a negative checklist. Designers as well as research-\ners are supported by having a comprehensive view of the most\ncommon cognitive problems as well as the often overlooked\nsocial and emotional issues that may exist when using graphic\nrepresentations of information. Visualization users can utilize\nthe table as an instrument to control or reflect on their own\npotential biases as well as a designer's quality of work.\nWe do not claim that all the elements identified in the\ntable are always problematic. There may be instances where\none or several of the listed issues are productively used on\npurpose. Visual ambiguity, for example, may lead to the cre-\native re-interpretation of a graphic representation and thus\nlead to new insights (Eppler et al., 2008). Another example\nof a visualization risk that may provide a benefit is the shock-\ning or disturbing effect of a graphic or an emotionally exag-\ngerated visualization that, as a benefit, would be remembered\nfor a long time (e.g., Figure 3). Furthermore, a high level of\ncomplexity should not be considered negative in absolute\nsense; rather, it depends on the familiarity and training of the\ntarget audience. Table 2 provides a brief description of each\nof the visualization pitfalls, based on the literature.\nIn the next section, we provide examples of the applica-\ntion of the classification for the evaluation of visualizations.\nExamples\nThe aforementioned classification can be used as a reference\npoint for evaluating and improving visualizations. To sim-\nplify this task for practitioners, the classified list of pitfalls is\nprovided also in the pragmatic format of \"Questions to Ask\"\nin the appendix, which can be used as a checklist by visual-\nization producers and users.\nIt is worth noticing that we do not expect to find issues\nwith all the characteristics listed in the classification when\nlooking at specific examples, but rather only with a few of\nthem for each analyzed image. We will provide two exam-\nples of visual representations that present problems, and we\nwill analyze the first from the point of view of the designer\n(an encoding problem), and the second from the point of\nview of the user (a decoding problem), following the cause-\nrelated criteria proposed in the classification.\nWe start by analyzing Figure 1, reported and discussed by\nWainer (1984) and representing U.S. imports and exports,\ntaking the point of view of a designer who receives the task\nof reviewing and improving the visual. We conduct an ana-\nlytical evaluation of visualization problems based on the\nclassification (with each identified disadvantage reported\nwitin quotes), and we use the evaluation as a guideline to\ndescribe the solutions to counteract the negative effects.\nFor this task, we need to consider the \"encoding\" section\nof the classification, as we want to identify issues induced by\nthe designer (the left column of Table 1). The classification\ncan simply be used by considering the list of pitfalls, one by\none, against the visual representation to be analyzed. In the\nproposed example (Figure 1), we find issues with \"breaking\nconventions\" (which is the second listed issue in the classifi-\ncation of pitfalls, based on Ware, 2004): Both the axes vary\nbetween the two graphs. Specifically, the y-axis is doubled in\nvalue in the graph on the right-hand side (US$3.000 million\ncompared with US$6.000 million): The reader would expect\nthe same scales on both graphs for comparison purposes.\nContinuing with comparing the list of negatives with the\nimage, we see that there is \"inconsistency\" (Cawthon &\ning the imports and exports are inconsistent between the\nright-hand side and left-hand side graph. In particular, in the\ngraph about China trades, the imports are depicted in black\nand the exports in white, whereas in the graph on Taiwan\ntrades (on the right-hand side), the meaning of the color is\nreversed. Next, we find a problem with \"misleading/distort-\nFigure 1. U.S. trade with China and Taiwan.\nBresciani and Eppler 9\nFigure 2.

Proceeding with the list,\nthe visual representation, as the data refer to the same quanti-\nties (time and millions of dollars): Higher efficiency could be\nachieved by depicting all the data on one single graph (to\noptimize the so called \"data-ink ratio\" proposed by Tufte,\n1986). In this specific image, we do not identify issues\nrelated to emotional or social effects.\nGiven the specific disadvantages of this visualization identi-\nfied through the schema, we can propose solutions to improve it.\nAs a first step, the axes should follow the convention of having\nthe same scale on both graphs. Similarly, the import and exports\nshould be depicted with consistent colors across the graphs. To\nfacilitate the comparison of the information provided, we can\navoid the redundancy of having two graphs and draw all the data\non one single chart. An improved representation, based on the\nidentified problems, is shown in Figure 2. We now have a com-\npletely different insight regarding the meaning of the data. First,\nwe swiftly notice that there is greater trade exchange occurring\nwith Taiwan than with China. Second, the dotted lines depict\nexports, whereas the continuous lines represent imports; we can\nsee that the U.S. level of exports to China is greater than the\nimports. The reverse is true for Taiwan, from which the United\nStatesimportsmorethanitexports.Thesevisualinsightswerenot\navailable with the original version of the image.The classification\nhasthushelpedinsystematicallyidentifyingissueswiththevisual\nrepresentation, which can then be addressed and solved.\nWe now take the point of view of the user to explain the\n\"decoding\" section of the classification: We act as a common\nreader of a visual representation found in a magazine or on the\nInternet. We show how to read a visualization critically using\nthe proposed classification to be aware of pitfalls induced by\nour reading of the image. As exemplary illustration, we con-\nsider Figure 3, which represents civilian war casualties of the\nAlthough there might be issues with the visualization\ninduced by the designer, in this paragraph, we focus on\ndifferences in interpretation caused by the viewer. To do so,\nwe utilize the right-hand side column of the classification\n(Table 1), which refers to decoding issues, and consider the\nvisualization pitfalls one by one. We do not identify issues\nwith change blindness or channel thinking, whereas we do\nrecognize that interpretation of this visual is based on \"per-\nand \"prior knowledge and experience\" (Avgerinou &\nthe concentric circles as an indication of the quantity of\ncivilian casualties by country, assuming that the larger the\ncircle is, the higher the number of deaths. However, if we\nread the image carefully, we can see that the opposite is the\ncase: In the innermost circle (which is the smallest) are posi-\nwhereas in the outermost circle, we find countries that wit-\nnessed less than 5,000 deaths. This is the case because the\nvisual is developed on the metaphor of the shooting target;\nthus, more points are scored when hitting the center.\nHowever, users not familiar with shooting sports might find\nit difficult to detect and understand the intended metaphor.\nSecond, we find an issue also with the emotional user-\ninduced effect of \"personal likes and dislikes\" (Tversky,\n2005). In fact, different people may react differently to this\ntype of graphic representation depending on their gender and\nsensitivity: The target superimposed on the image of a family\nis a very strong choice.\nFinally, the social user-induced issue of \"cultural and\ncross-cultural differences\" (Avgerinou & Pettersson, 2011;\n2004) plays a role in the interpretation of this visualization,\nas some cultures are less inclined to crude representations,\nwhereas others regularly use shocking visualizations to\nattract the attention of readers (Chan et al., 2007).\nThrough the above examples, we aimed to show how the\nclassification of visual representations pitfalls can be used to\nsystematically analyze visual representations with regard to\ntheir potential drawbacks.\nDiscussion/Theoretical Implications\nMotivated by van Vijk's (2006) call to action to develop arti-\ncles on the limitations and pitfalls of visualization for the\nadvancement of the field, and by the "
