Using large-scale\nsurvey data from Germany, covering the period between 1992 and 2008, some unresolved key questions surrounding\nsportive nationalism are addressed. We examine the relative importance of sport as a source of national pride, analyze\nthe sociodemographics of sportive nationalism, and describe its long-term development in East and West Germany after\nreunification. Results reveal that sport is an increasingly important source of pride in Germany. Sportive nationalism is more\ncommon among younger generations, males, and individuals with lower socioeconomic status. Prevailing differences between\nEast and West Germany document persistent socialization effects of former sport-centered identity politics. Among East\nGermans, sport is more important for general national pride, and sportive nationalism is much more equally distributed\nbetween various social groups (with regard to age, gender, education). From 1992 to 2008, however, a trend toward\nconvergence between East and West Germans is also demonstrated.\n",

While Mussolini and Hitler demon-\nstrated early how symbolic benefits can be reaped from inter-\nnational sport events, the so-called \"politicization\" of\ninternational sports, that is, the use of sport as a vehicle for\nidentity politics, has heavily intensified after World War II\n(Tomlinson & Young, 2006). International sport events, in\nparticular the Olympic Games, turned into an arena of the\nCold War after the Soviet government had decided to partici-\npate in the 1952 Olympics in order to broadcast the message\nof communist superiority (Allison & Monnington, 2002). In\nparticular, the two Germanys (the Federal Republic of\nGermany [FRG] and the German Democratic Republic\n[GDR]) became involved in a fierce \"Cold War on the dirt\ntrack\" (Balbier, 2005). In both parts of Germany, athletic\nsuccess was regarded as a cue for general productivity and\nefficiency of the country. Furthermore, in the GDR sport\nbecame a vehicle for increasing the legitimacy of the social-\nist regime and for creating a distinct East German national\nAfter German reunification, however, sport was also used\nas a tool to enhance national unity and solidarity in the reunited\ncountry, for example, by giving the TV broadcast of the\nOlympic Games 1992 a highly patriotic orchestration, which\nwas coined as \"the new nationalism\" of the German sports\nmedia (Gebauer, 1996). Moreover, the staging of the FIFA\nWorld Cup in 2006 and the associated marketing campaigns\nwere also used to envision a tolerant, friendly, and open-\nminded nation and to foster a new self-image of the Germans,\nunburdened by the shame and guilt of World War II (Kersting,\nmake Germany a very interesting case for studying sportive\nnationalism. Whereas older generations were socialized in two\ndifferent states with contrasting ideologies, fiercely competing\nfor superiority in the field of sport, younger cohorts were\nraised in a reunified country, where sport is seen as a tool to tie\nthe nation together. Moreover, the open display of patriotism\nhas recently become commonplace, at least in the realms of\n1University of M\u00fcnster, Germany\n2Justus-Liebig-University Gie\u00dfen, Germany\nCorresponding Author:\nMichael Mutz, Institute of Sport Science, Justus-Liebig-University Gie\u00dfen,\nEmail: michael.mutz@sport.uni-giessen.de\nSport-Related National Pride in East\nPersistent Differences or Trends\nToward Convergence?\nHenk Erik Meier1 and Michael Mutz2\n Keywords\nsport, nationalism, national pride, identity politics, German reunification\n2 SAGE Open\nsport, which is also in stark contrast to the former norm of a\nreserved and dispassionate consumption of national sporting\nThe fact that sport has been widely used as a vehicle for\nnational identity politics has inspired scholars to assume that\ninternational sport plays a key role in reinforcing feelings of\nnational identity and national pride (Washington & Karen,\n2001). Scholars have particularly focused on effects associ-\nated with the hosting of large-scale sports events. For exam-\nple, it has been claimed that the Rugby World Cup 1995 in\nSouth Africa fostered the nation-building process in the post-\napartheid period by transforming the South African Rugby\nteam, the \"Springboks\"--a former symbol of the apartheid\nera--into an icon of the new non-racist rainbow nation\nMoreover, the victory of the multiethnic French soccer team\nin its home World Cup in 1998 has been depicted as having\ninspired national pride as well as strengthened multicultural-\nism and inclusive citizenship as elements of French national\nGames (Lau, Lam, Leung, Choi, & Ransdell, 2012) and the\n2010 Singapore Youth Olympic Games (Leng, Kuo, Baysa-\nPee, & Tay, 2014) also conclude that staging these events\npositively impacted national pride, at least in the host city.\nMost recently, the Olympic Winter Games in Sochi, Russia,\nwere used to create images of national strength and economic\nIn addition, there exists a vibrant research on the relation\nbetween media coverage of international sports and nation-\nalism. Scholars have stressed that national stereotypes as\nwell as nationalism and patriotism are reinforced through\nsport media (Billings et al., 2013; Blain, Boyle, & O'Donnell,\nMaguire, Poulton, & Possamai, 1999). Moreover, interna-\ntional sporting competitions have a salience enhancing func-\nrender the national category salient, because media presenta-\ntion is virtually always centered around the own nation's ath-\nletes and favors sports and competitions in which national\nathletes are likely to perform well. Thus, broadcasts of inter-\nnational sport remind people permanently of their national-\nity. At least in Germany, media coverage of major sports\nevents seems to have shifted from a matter-of-fact style in\nthe 1970s toward a highly emotionalized, patriotic presenta-\ntion likely to enhance the arousal and identification of TV\nOther researchers have addressed the question of how\nsporting success impact national pride. According to\nwas positively related to national pride. Hallmann, Breuer,\nand K\u00fchnreich (2013) concluded on the basis of a nation-\nwide survey that a majority of Germans felt proud and happy\nwhen German athletes are successful at major sport events. A\nmajority of Germans perceives Olympic medals indeed as\nimportant, but by far not as important as sticking to sporting\nvalues and the rules of fair play (Haut, Prohl, & Emrich,\nScheve, Beyer, Ismer, Kozlowska, and Morawetz (2014)\nindicate that only individuals with a high degree of emo-\ntional and symbolic involvement become more patriotic dur-\ning major football events. According to both studies,\nexperience of strong emotions, participation in collective\nrituals, and adoption of national symbols are key factors\nexplaining the changes between pre-event and post-event\npatriotism scores. In addition, Elling, van Hilvoorde, and\nVan den Dool (2014) as well as van Hilvoorde, Elling, and\nStokvis (2010) provided evidence that the extent to which\nnational pride can be influenced by sporting success seems to\nbe rather limited and the eruptions in national pride might\nonly be short-lived. National pride in Germany, for instance,\nincreased steeply during the 2006 World Cup, but dropped at\nalmost the same rate after the defeat of the German team in\nHowever, some key questions surrounding sportive\nnationalism have remained unexplored. Based on the\nassumption that its history turns Germany into an ideal labo-\nratory for studying the relationship between sport and\nnational identity, research presented here addresses some of\nthese questions: First, we examine the relative importance of\nsportive nationalism compared with other sources of national\npride as well as its correlation with general national pride.\nSecond, we explore the social demographics of sportive\nnationalism in Germany. Third, as our data set covers a\nbetween East and West Germans over time. Hence, the data\nallow for descriptions of long-term trends and shifts in sport-\nrelated national pride in both parts of Germany, beginning\nonly two years after its reunification.\nSports-Related Policies in the Divided\nGermany\nAs in other domains, the division of Germany resulted--at\nleast initially--in different trajectories of sport policy mak-\ning. In the FRG, the sport movement struggled to recover\nfrom its collaboration with the Nazi regime that had compro-\nmised most of sport's leading figures (Daume, 1973). These\nefforts for reconstruction resulted in a lasting tendency to\npresent West German sport as an \"Olympic model student\"\ncommitted to particular high moral standards. Sport was now\nframed as a domain in its own right independent from poli-\ntics and economics. Accordingly, the government was sup-\nposed to respect sport's autonomy and to abstain from\ninterventions (Kr\u00fcger, 1995). Mainly due to the sporting\nchallenge by the GDR, these efforts to abstain from using\nsport as vehicle for identity politics proved not sustainable\nHowever, sport soon became a symbol of the successful\nreconstruction after the devastating defeat in World War II.\nThe unexpected West German win of the Football World Cup\nMeier and Mutz 3\nin 1954 resulted in a national euphoria giving rise to the feel-\ning of \"We are somebody again\" (Br\u00fcggemeier, 2004). The\nEast Germans had their own athletic reconstruction heroes.\nCycling world champion Gustav-Adolf \"T\u00e4ve\" Schur\nbecame a legend and an ultimate communist role model\nwhen he waived his own chance for victory for a team mate\nduring the 1960 World Championships. Schur remained a\nstaunch supporter of the GDR even after its collapse and was\nvoted East Germany's biggest sport idol of all times in 1990\nBeyond serving as a reconstruction symbol, sport became\na vehicle for identity politics as the East Germans turned\nsporting successes into a means for gaining diplomatic rec-\nognition. West German sport organizations tried to prevent\nsuch recognition on the basis of the Hallstein Doctrine,\ndeclaring the FRG as sole legitimate representative of\nGermany. Accordingly, East German elite athletes were\nturned into \"diplomats in training suits\" (Holzwei\u00dfig, 1981)\nand the two Germanys became involved in a \"Cold War on\nthe dirt track\" (Balbier, 2005). The quest for athletic domi-\nnance resulted in the creation of highly sophisticated sport\nsystems utilizing the latest advances in exercise and training\nphysiology (Hunt, 2007). As a matter of fact, the East\nGerman strategy proved to be successful as outstanding per-\nformances forced international sport authorities to finally\nrecognize the GDR (Balbier, 2005). After the International\nOlympic Committee (IOC) had become increasingly tired of\nthe intra-German arguments, the GDR was allowed to par-\nticipate in the Munich Games of 1972 as a sovereign state\nand defeated the West German team on its home ground\n(Braun & Wiese, 2005). Thanks to enormous investments in\ntraining science, inclusive talent screening, and a clandestine\n\"state doping\" (Franke & Berendonk, 1997), the GDR\nbecame a sporting world power competing with the Soviets\nand the United States (Dann, 1996). Although the success of\nthe GDR's efforts to use sport as vehicle for increasing the\nlegitimacy of the socialist regime and for creating a distinct\nEast German national identity have been controversially dis-\nKrebs, 1995), most scholars would admit that sporting suc-\ncesses have at least somewhat improved the identification of\nthe GDR citizens with the socialist regime.\nHowever, East German athletic dominance came with\nconsequences for West German sport as the West German\npolitical elite perceived international sport as an important\nCold War arena as well. The political interest in athletic\nachievements inspired the modernization of structures and\npolicies within the West German sport movement because the\nfederal government offered heavily increased subsidies in\nexchange for efforts to improve performances (Balbier, 2005,\nsee also Meier & Reinold, 2013). Yet the increased politiciza-\ntion of sport remained controversial in West Germany. Sport\nbecame ideologically contested after the \"New Left\" adopted\na highly critical stance toward high-performance sport and\ndepicted sport as means of discipline and the extension of\ncapitalist logics into leisure time (Rigauer, 1979). Thus, sport\nnever occupied such a central role in West German self-repre-\nsentation and identity politics.\nThus, in sport as in other domains, the division of Germany\nserved to create quite different institutions and policies. The\nfact that reunification has placed two very different societies\nunder the West German regime has raised the question if and\nhow East German attitudes and behaviors would adapt\n(Arnold, Freier, & Kroh, 2015; Bauernschuster & Rainer,\nResearch Questions\nIn light of these peculiarities of its history, Germany repre-\nsents an ideal case for studying the long-term effects of iden-\ntity politics. The division of Germany has created a unique\nlaboratory for examining political socialization effects of\nsport-centered identity politics. Three important yet unre-\nsolved questions are at the core of this study:\nResearch Question 1: Based on the prominent role of\nsport in the former GDR and the international success of\nEast German athletes at the international level, it can be\nargued that sport constitutes an important domain for\nnational pride particularly among East Germans.\nHowever, over the course of almost two decades since\nreunification, it is also plausible to assume that a process\nof convergence may have taken place. Hence, the impor-\ntance of sport as a source of national pride in East and\nWest Germany will be analyzed. Particularly, the initial\ndifferences in 1992, 2 years after reunification, and the\ndevelopment of sport-related national pride in both parts\nof Germany over the next 16 years will be investigated.\nResearch Question 2: Moreover, it has remained unclear\nhow sport-related national pride relates to general\nnational pride. Politics, the economy, science, culture,\nand sport are often regarded as distinct societal domains\nin which outstanding achievements may bring credit and\nprestige to a nation (Evans & Kelley, 2002). Although it is\ncommonly assumed that general national pride may result\nfrom domain-specific national pride, the relative weight\nof each domain for general pride remains a matter of spec-\nulation. Hence, the effect of the sporting domain on gen-\neral nationalism will be assessed and compared with other\nsocietal domains, so that the specific contribution of sport\ncan be grasped. Moreover, East and West Germany will\nalso be compared in this regard, whereby the article is\ndriven by the hypothesis that achievements in sport will\nbe more closely correlated with general national pride\namong East Germans.\nResearch Question 3: Furthermore, little is known about\nthe sociodemographics of sportive nationalism. Previous\nresearch has indicated that lower educated individuals as\nwell as those actively involved in sports score higher in\n4 SAGE Open\nings on age, gender, income, and political orientation\nreveal contradictory patterns. Hence, this article will ask\nfor sociodemographic characteristics that make it more\nlikely that individuals show sportive nationalism. Again,\ndifferences between East and West Germany are\naddressed. Given the significance of sport in East German\nidentity politics, it seems likely that sporting national\npride is less structured by sociodemographic characteris-\ntics in East Germany compared with West Germany.\nMethod and Data\nData Source\nThe German General Social Survey (GGSS; GESIS--\nLeibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, 2012) is a cross-\nsectional survey with a focus on attitudes, behavior, and\nsocial structure in Germany. The GGSS has been conducted\nevery 2 years since 1980 and contains a large body of perma-\nnent questions. Before German reunification in 1990, the\nsample represented the adult population of West Germany\nand West Berlin. Since 1992, the sample represents the resi-\ndent adult population (>18 years) in East and West Germany.\nQuestions on national identity and sporting national pride\nwave; hence, our analysis relies on these four waves. Sample\ndents. In each wave, at least 1,000 persons are surveyed in\nEast Germany to allow for comparisons of East and West\nGermans.As questions on national pride were only presented\nto individuals with German citizenship, we cannot account\nfor sportive nationalism of non-German residents. Details on\nthe samples and questionnaires are provided on the website\nof the German Leibniz-Institute for the Social Sciences\n(www.gesis.org/en/allbus/) and in the GGSS technical\nreports (e.g., Wasmer, Scholz, & Blohm, 2010).\nVariables\nResearch presented here uses the GGSS measures for\ndomain-specific national pride and general national pride.\nFurthermore, sociodemographic indicators as well as politi-\ncal orientations are used as covariates in the models. These\ncontrol variables are fully described in the Appendix.\nDomain-specific national pride was assessed in each wave\nwith questions addressing various German institutions and\nachievements: (a) the German constitution (\"Grundgesetz\"),\n(b) the German parliament (\"Bundestag\"), (c) achievements\nof German athletes, (d) economic achievements, (e) German\nart and literature, (f) scientific achievements, and (g) services\nof the welfare state. Respondents were told to choose up to\nthree institutions or achievements, which make them proud of\nGermany. Across all GGSS waves, about 75% of respondents\nindicated the maximum number of three sources of pride,\n15% reported to be proud of at least one or two of said institu-\ntions or achievements, and another 10% spontaneously\nreplied not to be proud of any of the above-mentioned aspects.\nBased on these data, our operational definition of sport-\nrelated national pride is thus located on a relational level:\nCompared with six other possible sources of pride, respon-\ndents had to rank the achievements of athletes among the top\nthree to be considered sportive nationalists.\nGeneral national pride was captured with one item, \"I am\nproud to be a German.\" This wording was used in the most\nrecent survey of 2008. Respondents indicated their national pride\non a 5-point rating scale. As general national pride was assessed\nwith different items and scales in different waves, the GGSS is\nunsuitable for comparisons over time in this particular case.\nResults\nThe Importance of Sport as a Domain of\nNational Pride\nIn several GGSS waves, respondents were asked which\nachievements make them feel proud of Germany. We docu-\nment the share of respondents who are proud of Germany\nwith regard to its achievements in the (a) athletic, (b) eco-\nnomic, (c) cultural, (d) scientific, and (e) civic domain,\nwhereby the civic domain is measured with three items refer-\nring to constitution, parliament, and welfare state (Table 1).\nRespondents in West Germany most frequently indicate that\nthey are proud of Germany's constitution as well as its eco-\nnomic and scientific achievements. Whereas pride in the consti-\nimportance of economic pride has decreased significantly, from\nmore important over time with 49% of Germans reporting to be\nproud of achievements in this domain in 2008. Sporting success\nof German athletes is of lesser importance in West Germany.\nOnly a minority of 20% were proud of Germany's athletic\nachievements in 1992. However, this share increased to 27% in\nthe latest GGSS wave. Hence, although still at a rather low level\ncompared with other domains, sport-related pride has become\nData on East Germany, however, reveal a very different\npattern. East Germans are less proud of civic achievements\nlike the constitution, the parliament, or the welfare system.\nThis may be due to their socialization under a very different\npolitical regime. Moreover, their pride in the economy\nthe enduring economic decline in the East German federal\nstates. However, sport-related national pride is of far greater\nimportance for East Germans compared with West Germans,\nbecause about one in two East Germans selected sport as a\ndomain for national pride. This high level of sportive nation-\nalism in East Germany is in line with the socialization hypoth-\nesis, which assumes a formative and thus long-lasting impact\nMeier and Mutz 5\nof the former GDR's identity politics. Thus, even in 2008--\n18 years after reunification--the importance of sport as a\ndomain for national pride varies strongly between East and\nWest Germany. Sport is less important in West Germany,\nwhere the economic, scientific, and civic domains appear to\nbe more important for national pride. In East Germany, how-\never, sportive nationalism is far higher and positioned among\nthe top domains for national pride.\nAt second glance, however, the data also support the notion\nof convergence between East and West Germany: Whereas\nsportive nationalism was 2.55 times higher in East than in West\nferences in sportive nationalism between East and West\nGermans became smaller and may converge in the long run.\nSport-Related National Pride and General\nNational Pride\nThe last wave of 2008 included a question on general national\npride, so that the relevance of sport for general national pride\ncan be assessed. Accordingly, an ordinal regression model\nwas conducted with general national pride as the dependent\nvariable and domain-specific national pride scores as the pre-\ndictor variables. Age, gender, and educational level of the\nrespondents served as control variables. The model was cal-\nculated for East and West Germany separately (Table 2).\nIt has to be noted, however, that cross-national research\nsupports the idea that Germans show comparatively low lev-\nels of national pride (Evans & Kelley, 2002). In the GGSS\nsamples, about 15% to 20% of the adult population report a\nstrong sense of national pride. These rather low numbers are\nusually ascribed to Germany's inglorious past. In view of the\natrocities of the Nazi regime and due to the collective guilt\nover these crimes, the open expression of national pride is\nstill considered inappropriate by many, particularly in older\ngenerations. Hence, those who openly express a strong sense\nof national pride are mostly younger people, those with right-\nwing political orientations and a rather uncritical attitude\ntoward Germany's history.\nResults reveal that sportive nationalism is a strong predic-\ntor of general national pride in both parts of Germany.\nRespondents who chose sport as an important domain for\nnational pride also indicated more general national pride.\nBesides the economic sphere, sport is most closely correlated\nwith general national pride. At least in West Germany, civic\nand scientific national pride are also positively correlated\nwith general national pride; however, the effects of these\ndomains are not as strong as for sport. In East Germany, per-\nceived achievements in the civic and scientific domains are\nnot significant predictors of general national pride. Pride in\nartistic and cultural achievements is not substantially associ-\nated with general pride in West Germany and even nega-\ntively correlated with general nationalism in East Germany.\nHence, athletic success does not only lead to sport-related\nnational pride but also fosters general nationalism.\nAchievements in other societal domains, for example, in the\nfield of arts and literature, might nurture domain-specific\npride but do not increase general national pride to a notice-\nable degree.\nThe Sociodemographics of Sportive Nationalism\nin Germany\nConcerning the sociodemographics, previous research sug-\ngests that higher levels of sportive nationalism correlate with\na lower educational level and fewer economic resources.\nHere, we analyze the sociodemographics of sportive nation-\nalism with regard to age, gender, education, income level,\nself-placement in the left\u00adright political spectrum and place\nof residence, that is, East versus West Germany.\nGiven the fact that Germany provides a \"natural experi-\nment\" for studying socialization effects of sport-centered\nidentity politics, it is of utmost interest to examine East\u00adWest\ndifferences and changes in the sociodemographics of sportive\nnationalism over time. Therefore, we tested for interactions of\nTable 1.

The first set of interac-\ntions accounts for differences in the sociodemographic distri-\nbution of sportive nationalism among East and West Germans,\nwhereas the second set of interactions allows for trend analy-\nfor all possible interactions, the final logistic regression\nmodel (Table 3) only includes those effects which turned out\nas significant.\nSignificant main effects are found for all of the included\nvariables: A higher degree of sportive nationalism is a\ncharacteristic of younger generations, males, individuals\nwith lower and medium educational levels, a lower income,\nand for East Germans. The generation effect illustrates that\nolder respondents are less prone to report sportive nation-\nalism than younger respondents. Respondents born in the\nive nationalism compared with respondents born before\n1950, hence compared to those socialized under the Nazi\nregime and/or in the post\u00adWorld War period. The gender\neffect on sportive nationalism seems highly plausible:\nBecause sport represents a highly gendered sphere, it does\nnot come as a surprise that males also take more pride from\nGermany's sporting success. In addition, education and\nincome seem to strongly influence sporting pride. Thus,\nour findings support similar results from other studies,\nwhich also documented more sporting pride among lower\nHaut et al., 2016). Findings thus support claims made by\nSchediwy (2012) that identification with successful\nGerman athletes becomes more attractive in times of eco-\nnomic crisis, in particular among individuals with lower\nsocial status who are economically more vulnerable. For\nthese individuals, identification with successful sport\nteams and athletes may, at least gradually, compensate for\nthe loss of individual self-worth that typically results from\nunemployment or precarious working conditions.\nMoreover, the time variable (survey year) once more indi-\ncates that sportive nationalism generally has increased in\nThese findings appear to be quite stable over time because\nonly one of the interaction effects with the survey year\nreaches significance. Namely, the significant interaction with\nEast/West Germany shows that the main effect--that East\nGermans feel more pride when Germany's athletes suc-\nceed--has decreased over time. Similar to a number of other\nlegacies of East German political socialization, differences\nin sports-related pride appear to wane over time and even\nmay converge in the long run.\nNevertheless, the differences between East and West\nGermany with regard to sportive nationalism are still\nstriking. Besides the markedly higher level of sport-\nrelated national pride in East Germany, further socializa-\ntion effects are indicated by the fact that sportive\nnationalism in East Germany is less influenced by educa-\ntion, less \"gendered\" and more equally distributed among\ndifferent generations. Hence, East German women and\nbetter-educated East Germans are more likely to display\nsportive nationalism than their West German counterparts.\nMoreover, older East Germans show more and younger\nEast Germans less sports-related pride compared with\nWest Germans of the same generation. In addition, East\nGerman identity politics seem to have succeeded in dis-\nsolving the relationship between right-wing attitudes and\nsportive nationalism. Whereas in West Germany sportive\nnationalism is more common among those who place\nthemselves further right on the left\u00adright political contin-\nuum, there is no such effect in East Germany. Hence, one\neffect of the GDR's sports-centered identity politics may\nbe seen in the fact that sportive nationalism is much more\nequally distributed between various social groups (with\nregard to age, gender, class, etc.) in East Germany com-\npared with West Germany.\nDiscussion\nTaking Germany as a crucial case, research presented here\nhas addressed a number of questions concerning the role and\nspecific contours of sportive nationalism. By analyzing a\nunique longitudinal German data set consisting of four sur-\nveys and covering a 16-year period, we addressed some\nunresolved key questions concerning sportive nationalism\nand sports-based identity politics.\nRegarding the relative importance of sportive national-\nism, we were able to demonstrate that pride in athletic\nachievements represents an important source of national\npride, but that other societal domains, such as economy, sci-\nence, and culture are more important. This, however, is not\nTable 2. Association of Domain-Specific National Pride With\nGeneral National Pride in East and West Germany (Survey Year\n East Germany West Germany\n \nSource.

However,\npride in athletic achievements has also grown in West\nGermany until 2008, which might reflect the rise of sport as\na global entertainment industry and may mirror the German\n\"summer tale\" of 2006 where the national football team\ninspired the masses at the German World Cup. Moreover,\nsportive nationalism proved to be a main predictor of general\nnational pride. Hence, athletic success is to a greater extent\nlinked to the nation as a whole than achievements in science,\narts, or politics.\nFurthermore, we have explored the sociodemographics\nof sport-related national pride. The findings support a\nnumber of intuitive assumptions concerning sportive\nnationalism. A higher degree of sportive nationalism is\nmore common among younger generations, males, indi-\nviduals with lower and medium educational levels, and a\nlower income. These findings inspire a number of interpre-\ntations. First, sportive nationalism might indeed serve self-\nesteem enhancing purposes for most vulnerable social\ngroups. Second, the gendered character of sport has the\neffect that the domain represents a far less important source\nof national pride for women. Third, sport-centered identity\npolitics have long-lasting socialization effects. The empha-\nsis on success in high-performance sport under the social-\nist regime in the former GDR has indeed resulted in higher\nlevels of sportive nationalism among East Germans, con-\ntinuing until today. However, just like other legacies of the\nsocialist regime, the socialization effects of the GDR's\nidentity politics wane in the long run. From reunification\nuntil 2008, a significant trend toward convergence can be\ndetected when it comes to the levels of sportive national-\nism in East and West Germany.\nFinally, it is necessary to reflect on the limitations of\nour study. While we believe that the longitudinal character\nof the GGSS data serves to increase the robustness of our\nfindings, two major limitations have to be mentioned.\nFirst, the forced choice format used by the GGSS is far\nfrom optimal and should be replaced by rating scales.\nSecond, the exclusion of immigrants prevented us from\naddressing the question how sportive nationalism figures\namong ethnic minorities.\nSportive nationalism\n b OR b OR\nMain effects\n Educational level (Ref.
