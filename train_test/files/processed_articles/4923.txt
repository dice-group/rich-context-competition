    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe study set out to investigate what influences the intentions of college students to get vaccinated against genital human\npapillomavirus (HPV). College men and women were surveyed to understand their intentions. Regression was used and\nsupported that the constructs of the health belief model (HBM) as well as gender, norms, and information seeking contributed\ninfluential variable, and men were more likely to intend to receive the vaccine. The findings should be applied to future\ncampaigns aimed at increasing preventive health behaviors, especially vaccinations among college students.\n",

Cervarix is another HPV vaccine, but it pro-\ntects against fewer strains of HPV and is only available to\nwomen. Initially, the Gardasil vaccine was only available to\nwomen and specifically targeted young girls (11 to 12 years\nold), but in 2009, it was approved for use with men (U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration, 2010). Although it was\napproved for use, it was not endorsed publicly for use with\nmen until October 2011.At this time, theAdvisory Committee\non Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that men\nand women ages 11 to 26 should receive the HPV vaccine\nPrior to this recommendation by the ACIP, the vaccines\nwere targeted toward young children (11 to 12 year olds).\nThis means that the current college population did not have\nthe option to be vaccinated, at that age, and therefore, they\nwill be investigated in the current study. The Gardasil vac-\ncine is important because of the ability to protect against\nsome of the most common and dangerous strains of HPV (6,\n11, 16, and 18) as well as because it is available to both men\nand 18 cause a variety of cancers, including cervical, vagi-\nnal, penile, and oropharyngeal; they are also responsible for\nof Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health,\nNational Cancer Institute, 2012). The most recent report on\ncancer in the United States revealed that HPV continues to\nbe an issue (Jemal et al., 2013). Most cancers are decreas-\ning, but a few associated with HPV, particularly oropharyn-\ngeal and anal, are on the rise (Jemal et al., 2013). One of the\nmain concerns with the vaccine, and potential cause for the\nincrease in HPV related cancers, is the lack of immunization\nrate, particularly among the college population (Licht et al.,\nThe ACIP recommendation for males to receive the vac-\ncination increases the need for research that looks at both\nmen and women. One of the more studied populations in\nregard to HPV vaccination rates are college women. Licht\nonly 44% had received at least one HPV vaccination shot.\nWhile vaccination rates are somewhat low, the likelihood of\ncontracting HPV is fairly high as the CDC (2012a) estimated\nthat around six million people will contract HPV each year.\nCollege students are no different, and when 263 couples\nwere checked for an HPV infection, more than 60% (64%)\nhad at least one partner who was carrying a strain of the virus\n(Burchell, Tellier, Hanley, Coutlee, & Franco, 2010). The\nproliferation of HPV among college students appears to be\nhigh, and the next step is determining how to reach this at\nrisk population.\n1East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nKeith Richards, Assistant Professor, School of Communication, East\nEmail: richardsk@ecu.edu\nCollege Men and Women and Their\nIntent to Receive Genital Human\nPapillomavirus Vaccine\nKeith Richards1\n Keywords\ngenital human papillomavirus, health belief model, norms, information seeking\n2 SAGE Open\nHealth Belief Model (HBM)\nOne of the most popular theories for studying health behaviors\nand following health recommendations is the HBM (Allen\nHBM are perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, and bar-\nriers (D'Souza, Zyngier, Robinson, Schlotterlein, & Sullivan-\nMort, 2011). The model predicts that behavior is influenced by\nweighing the threat (susceptibility and severity) and their abil-\nity to reduce the threat (benefits and barriers; Marlow, Waller,\nEvans, & Wardle, 2009). HBM provides a framework that has\nshown significant relationships between the four variables\nand intentions to perform a recommended health behavior\n(Harrison, Mullen, & Green, 1992). Additional variables are\nbeing tested because more knowledge surrounding what is\nmost influential in increasing intentions could lead to better\npromotional messages targeted at college students in regard to\nvaccine uptake.\nMehta and Sharma (2011) found in a sample of college\nmen that perceived susceptibility was a significant contribu-\ntor to vaccine intentions. Gainforth, Cao, and Latimer-\nCheung (2012) found similar results with a group of almost\n300 college females, as their feelings of susceptibility\nincreased so did their intent to get vaccinated. For someone\nto take action, they must feel that they are susceptible to con-\ntracting HPV and that it would pose severe consequences\n(genital warts/cancer; Harrison et al., 1992; Marlow et al.,\n2009). If both of these conditions present themselves, then\nthe individual is more likely to take the recommended action.\nHypothesis 1 (H1): Perceived susceptibility positively\ninfluences behavioral intention.\nHypothesis 2 (H2): Perceived severity positively influ-\nences behavioral intention.\nIn a study of college age women (18 to 26 years), some of\nthe barriers to getting the HPV vaccine were lack of time,\ncost of the vaccine, as well as short- and long-term side\neffects from the vaccination (Brewer & Fazekas, 2007; Katz,\net al., 2009). Time is an important potential barrier because\nthe vaccine is administered over a 6-month period and\nrequires a total of three injections. Another study found that\nworry related to the side effects from the vaccine lowered\nyoung women's intentions to receive the HPV vaccination\n(Juraskova, Bari, O'Brien, & McCaffery, 2011). In addition\nto any barrier to getting vaccinated, there are benefits such as\nlimiting the chances of getting genital warts, being infected\nwith cancer, or spreading HPV strains that could cause can-\ncer in a sexual partner. Juraskova et al. (2011) used HBM to\npredict vaccine intention and found that perceived benefits\nwere a significant factor that contributed to vaccine inten-\ntion. Marlow and colleagues (2009) as well as Mehta,\nSharma, and Lee (2013) each found similar results indicating\nthat the promotion of the benefits of the vaccine over any\nbarriers was significant. HBM uses benefits and barriers as\none variable with the perceived barriers being subtracted\nfrom the perceived benefits (Janz & Becker, 1984).\nHypothesis 3 (H3): Benefits minus barriers positively\ninfluences behavioral intention.\nNorms\nNorms relate to the social pressure that can be placed on indi-\nviduals to perform certain actions to stay in line with the\nexpectations of their particular social group (Bandura, 2004).\nFriends, significant others, parents, and anyone who is valued\nare important sources of information among college students,\nand they can play a role in influencing whether someone\nknows about HPV, the available vaccine, and whether they\nfeel support to get vaccinated (Allen et al., 2009; Gainforth\nCheng, & Enriquez, 2013). The current study expects norms\nto be an influence on vaccination intent as they have influ-\nenced other health behaviors (Bandura, 2004)\nHypothesis 4 (H4): Norms will positively effect behav-\nioral intention.\nKnowledge of HPV\nTo actively seek a vaccine, individuals will most likely need\nto have some knowledge about the vaccination so they feel\ncomfortable receiving the injections. In the survey by Licht\net al. (2010), they found that most of the women participat-\ning were not aware that both men and women are affected by\nHPV, that it can be transmitted from skin to skin contact, and\nthat it is responsible for causing most of the cases of genital\nwarts. Another survey of more than 1,400 found similar\nresults regarding low knowledge that HPV causes genital\nwarts and that most sexually active individuals will contract\nHPV during their lifetime (Marlow, Zimet, McCaffery,\nOstini, & Waller, 2013). In a survey of both men and women,\nthe females surveyed were more knowledgeable when it\ncame to understanding that women suffer negative conse-\nquences more often, that HPV can cause cervical cancer, and\nwomen were more aware that vaccines existed to protect\nagainst HPV (Marlow et al., 2013; Pleasant & Sandfort,\nthe connection between HPV and genital warts and were less\nlikely to understand the risk HPV poses to their health\n(Pleasant & Sandfort, 2009). There have been studies related\nto men and their knowledge or willingness to receive the\nHPV vaccine, but more studies need to be done to understand\nwhat will influence them to receive the HPV vaccine\n(Gainforth et al., 2012). In addition to not having as many\nstudies look at their knowledge of HPV, men have not been\nthe target of most vaccination programs (Marlow et al., 2013;\nStupiansky, Alexander, & Zimet, 2012). Research has shown\nthat women are more likely to take protective action in terms\nRichards 3\nof their health and they are more likely to follow the recom-\nmendations of a physician (Courtenay, McCreary, & Merighi,\nthat women may be more likely to be vaccinated, and this\nstudy will provide greater insight now that men are eligible\nto be vaccinated.\nHypothesis 5 (H5): Females will have greater intent to\nreceive the HPV vaccine.\nInformation Seeking\nlege students about where they found their information\nregarding HPV. The most popular sources of information\nwere television, Internet, and their friends. Other studies\nhave found similar results with television and the Internet\nbeing the most popular information sources (Katz et al.,\nlarly important to those learning about HPV because they\nsaid, after hearing about the vaccine, they used the Internet to\ngather more information (Katz et al., 2009). Using the\nInternet to find information is only part of the equation as\nindividuals may find information from a variety of sources.\nThe current study looks to see what kind of influence infor-\nmation seeking will have on intent to get vaccinated.\nHypothesis 6 (H6): Information seeking positively\nincreases behavioral intention.\nMethod\nA convenience sample of students was recruited from under-\ngraduate courses at a large university in the southern United\nStates during the spring of 2012. Professors of communica-\ntion courses were approached to see if they would offer the\nsurvey to their students. Those who accepted agreed to send\nan email to their students that contained details about the\nstudy and a link to the survey. The survey was hosted by a\nsecure online site which allowed complete anonymity, which\nwas important because of the sensitive nature of the topic. If\nstudents chose to participate, they clicked on the link (in the\nemail) and it took them to the survey which took about 15\nmin to complete. To be eligible for the study, the student\nneeded to be at least 18 years of age and to have not received\nany HPV vaccine shot. Those who had received a shot were\nnot eligible because if they were included in the sample, it\ncould artificially inflate or deflate the behavioral intention\nmeasure. The research was reviewed and approved by the\nuniversity's institutional review board (IRB).\nThe study looked to better understand the influence of six\nkey variables on behavioral intention. The first three hypoth-\neses dealt with the influence of perceived susceptibility, per-\nceived severity, and the combination of benefits and barriers\non intentions to receive the HPV vaccine. These are all\nelements of the HBM which have been found to be useful in\nunderstanding what influences an individual to take a recom-\nmended health action (Allen et al., 2010; Janz & Becker,\n1984). The final three hypotheses were added to improve the\nunderstanding of what influences intentions. These predicted\nthat norms, being female, and seeking health information\nwould increase vaccine intentions.\nParticipants\nThe analyses were run using the Statistical Package for the\nSocial Sciences (SPSS) 16.0. A total of 350 students received\nan email detailing the study and the restrictions on participa-\ntion, and of these students, 53% (186) completed the survey.\nwomen (43.5%), and as a group, they were on average 19\nyears old (M = 18.92). Most of the population identified\nthemselves as White (70.4%), while the second largest group\nMeasures\nThe survey consisted of a number of measures that were\ndrawn from the literature. Each of the scales was a 7-point\nscale with answer choices ranging from strongly disagree to\nstrongly agree. To measure behavioral intention, four Likert-\ntype questions were used. The questions centered around\nwhether the participant planned on \"considering getting the\nHPV vaccine,\" whether they would \"try to get the HPV vac-\ncine,\" whether they would \"get the complete HPV vaccine,\"\nand \"if approached by a health care provider, would you get\nthe vaccine.\" Perceived severity was a four-item Likert-type\nscale, and each of the questions dealt with feelings related to\nhow being infected with HPV would be disruptive to their\n\"social life,\" \"physical health,\" \"romantic relationship,\" and\n\"life overall.\" The behavior measure and the perceived sever-\nity scale were modified from scales created by Gerend and\nBarley (2009). An additional four-item Likert-type scale\nmeasured perceived susceptibility. The susceptibility mea-\nsure dealt with the likelihood of infection and asked whether\nthe participants felt vulnerable to contracting HPV and used\nstatements such as \"It is likely that I will contract HPV\"\nBenefits and barriers measures were adapted from\nresearch related to the HPV vaccination (Friedman &\nThe four benefits questions asked participants how willing\nthey would be to receive the vaccine if it protected them and\ntheir partners from genital warts and different types of can-\ncer. Six questions were used for measuring the impact of\nbarriers. Some of the questions asked whether the effective-\nness, safety, fear of pain, cost, and time spent making trips\nto the doctor would lessen the chances of the participant get-\nting vaccinated.\n4 SAGE Open\nNorms were measured with seven Likert-type questions\nthat asked participants whether they felt their friends would\nsupport them in receiving the vaccination as well as questions\nthat asked about their communication with friends related to\ntheir health (Borsari & Carey, 2003; Cialdini, Reno, &\nKallgren, 1990). Two norms statements were \"My closest\nfriends would approve of me getting the HPV vaccination\"\nand \"My friends and I talk about safe sex practices.\"\nInformation seeking was a nine-item Likert-type scale\nwhich asked questions about the use of the media such as\ntelevision, newspapers, and the Internet to find information\nrelated to health and HPV. One information seeking item was\n\"I have searched online many times to find information\nrelated to HPV.\" Outside of these measures, participants\nanswered questions related to demographics, sexual history,\nhealth insurance, and current relationship status.\nAll of the scales were found to be reliable, with eight\nscales having a reliability over .90 and two scales Norms (\n= .86) and Barriers ( = .77) being reliable, but not having as\nhigh of a reliability score. Next, each of the individual scales\nwas averaged. The average barriers score was subtracted\nfrom the average benefits score (Janz & Becker, 1984). In\ndetermining whether someone performs a certain action\nrelated to their health, they often weigh the benefits and bar-\nriers together rather than separately and to achieve this, they\nneed to be subtracted from one another to create a single\nvariable. If the benefits outweigh the barriers, the variable\nwill be positive, and if the barriers are more influential, then\nthe variable will be negative.\nResults\nThe first three hypotheses predicted that susceptibility (H1),\nseverity (H2), and benefits and barriers (H3) would positively\ninfluence behavioral intention. Regression was used to test\nthese hypotheses, and all three were supported as they\naccounted for 51% of the variance in behavioral intention, R2 =\nand barriers contributed the most ( = .53, p < .001), next was\nperceived vulnerability ( = .27, p < .001), and finally per-\nceived severity ( = .25, p < .001). The next step was to inves-\ntigate the final three hypotheses which predicted that norms\n(H4), being female (H5), and information seeking (H6) would\nall have positive effects on intent to receive the vaccine. These\nwere added to the regression equation that included severity,\nvulnerability, and benefits and barriers, and they significantly\nimproved the model by increasing the variance explained, R2 =\ncant contributors, with benefits and barriers again being the\nfinally perceived vulnerability ( = .12, p = .035).After looking\nat the hypotheses, it was important to look at the sexual history\nand experiences of the population as they might influence\nintentions. In terms of sexual intercourse, 107 members (58%)\nof the population had intercourse with a majority (42%) having\nbetween one and four sexual partners. Two additional equa-\ntions were run with sexual intercourse and number of sexual\npartners added to the regression. Neither variable contributed\nsignificantly to the prediction of intent to receive the HPV\nvaccine.\nDiscussion\nThe current study supports the use of the HBM for under-\nstanding vaccine intentions and added to the predictive abil-\nity of HBM. Although severity, susceptibility, and benefits\nand barriers played significant roles, so too did norms, gen-\nder, and information seeking. Working together, these vari-\nables were able to create a strong model that fit the data. The\nmost significant finding of the study was that males had\ngreater intention to get vaccinated than did females. This\nwent against what was predicted in the fourth hypothesis.\nThe negative influence in the regression equation showed\nthat men (coded as 1) had greater intentions to get vaccinated\nthan did females (coded as 2). This is interesting as this is\none of the first studies that was able to look at males who\nwere eligible and endorsed by the ACIP to receive the HPV\nvaccine. The recommendation that males be vaccinated was\nreleased in October 2011, and the study was conducted the\nfollowing spring.\nHBM\nThe HBM is one of the most often used theories to help\nexplain why individuals take protective action related to\ntheir health. As predicted, in the first three hypotheses, per-\nceived susceptibility, severity, benefits and barriers all were\nstrongly associated with intentions to receive the HPV vac-\ners variable had a significant positive relationship with\nbehavioral intention and demonstrates a need to highlight\nhow the benefits of receiving the vaccination outweigh the\nPerceived severity had the next largest effect of the HBM\nvariables, and as individual feelings of severity increased, so\ndid behavioral intention. Next was perceived susceptibility,\nand although it was a relatively small effect, it still was posi-\ntively associated with intention. Those who felt susceptible\nwere more likely to be planning on getting vaccinated.\nNorms\nOverall, the norms variable had a positive effect in the model\nwhich was predicted in the fourth hypothesis. The partici-\npants greatly valued the opinions of their friends. The norms\nvariable was positive such that more communication and\nsupport from friends increased intent to get vaccinated. This\nRichards 5\nfinding is similar to that of Dillard (2011) and Ratanasiripong\net al. (2013) who found that subjective norms was an impor-\ntant factor, for females, in increasing intent to get vaccinated.\nThe current study adds males to this finding and illustrates\nthat norms are important for both males and females.\nInformation Seeking\nAnother communication variable included in the model was\ninformation seeking, and the sixth hypothesis predicted that\nit would increase intent to get vaccinated. This variable did\nnot limit information seeking to one source in particular, but\nallowed it to occur across a range of sources with the hopes\nthat this would eliminate any issue of participants remember-\ning which source they found the information through. The\nmore that someone searched for health information, the more\nlikely they were to intend on getting vaccinated. This is an\nimportant finding because it suggests that those who are\ninterested in finding more information are finding informa-\ntion that supports that getting vaccinated is a good decision.\nTwo variables that were not significant in the model were\nrelated to sexual experiences of the participants. This finding\nis promising, in that no matter the sexual history of the indi-\nviduals, they were all influenced by the same variables.\nFuture research can draw from these findings to put in motion\ncampaigns that will better target the college population for\ncurrent and future health problems. These campaigns are\nnecessary to lower the risk of a population who is in danger\nof contracting various cancers and genital warts.\nLimitations\nOne limitation is that participants self-reported their infor-\nmation and may not be able to accurately recall their knowl-\nedge or actions related to HPV. Participants self-selected into\nthe study, and those who decided to complete the survey may\nhave had an interest in HPV. More detailed questions about\nthe sexual history, history of sexually transmitted infection,\nand use of contraception could present a clearer picture as to\nwhy some may be reluctant to get vaccinated. Another\nimportant series of questions to ask would center on the cost\nof the vaccine and their knowledge of their insurance cover-\nage. Cost was listed as a barrier, but if the participants were\nunaware if their insurance would cover any of the cost asso-\nciated with the vaccination, then their thoughts on cost would\nbe altered. The recent changes to the insurance landscape\nwith the introduction of the Affordable Care Act should be\ninvestigated to see how it influences vaccination costs and\nintentions. The sample was not racially diverse which inhib-\nits the generalizability of the results to a larger population.\nFuture Research\nIt is necessary to conduct longitudinal research to determine\nif these participants actually follow through with their\nintentions and receive the HPV vaccine. Future campaigns\nshould focus on young people's friends as the norms variable\nplayed an important role in increasing intent to be vacci-\nnated. The HPV measures used in the study can be used in\nother research as they provided insight into intentions to get\nvaccinated. Finding reliable measures is one aspect that\nresearchers have been looking for to better understand inten-\ntions related to HPV (Allen et al., 2010). Men have only had\nthe opportunity to receive the vaccination for a few years,\nand more research on this population should be conducted.\nThe current study laid the groundwork for this population\nwhich needs to be studied more in depth as they appear inter-\nested in getting vaccinated.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAllen, J.
