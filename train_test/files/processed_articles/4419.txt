Many have characterized the House Republican Conference that emerged after the\n1994 elections as a highly cohesive majority party. Even in that context, however, legislators represent varied personal\nagendas, and in part these are informed by religion. We topically coded a subset of floor speeches to measure the extent\nto which variation is observed in the issues addressed by Members of Congress. The findings demonstrate that on key\npolicy domains, such as the role of government, culture, and social welfare, speech participation varies systematically on\nthe basis of member religion. This suggests that legislative participation is influenced by genuine personal preferences in\nadditional to strategic political factors.\n",

We argue that while Republicans rallied around a\ncore agenda, below the surface members pursued diverse\npolicy agendas influenced partly by religion.\nLooking back to an earlier era of Republican ascend-\nance allows us to learn something about the current era of\nparty politics. Studying the 104th Congress reveals that the\ndefining features of contemporary congressional dysfunc-\nhad been the most ideologically polarized and least\nproductive to date. In part, this was owed to candidate\nrecruitment and the movement of Evangelical Protestants\nand white Catholics from the Democratic Caucus into the\nRepublican Conference. Since then, each House has been\nmore polarized than the last, culminating in the 113th\nof the majority party to govern was partly undone by intra-\nparty division.\nSeveral scholars have established systematic patterns of\nlegislative behavior shaped by religion (Fastnow et al.,\nreligious agendas may be masked by focusing on roll call\nvoting. Following Burden (2007), we investigate represen-\ntation in an area unconstrained by party leaders: floor\nspeeches.

As the recent kerfuffle over the\npulled House abortion bill demonstrates (Newhauser and\nFox, 2015), it is difficult for leadership to set an agenda that\nresonates with the entire party when it divides along reli-\ngious lines. Moreover, this study provides an opportunity to\nconsider larger issues of representation. Participation in the\nlegislative process is uneven (Hall, 1996). Members are\ntime constrained and have different interests. As a result\nthey make different, purposive choices as to whether and\nhow to participate in the policy process. The decision to\nparticipate affects the kinds of agendas that are represented\nin Congress. To the extent that religion informs representa-\ntion, its importance in the legislative arena is more signifi-\ncant than legislative scholars generally recognize.\nTheory\nThe religious context\nWhen Republicans took over as the House majority in\n1995, they moved quickly on their core agenda. Most items\ndied in the Senate or were vetoed by the president, but the\nRepublican Conference behaved like a unified, responsible\nparty. Indeed, the level of party unity voting, votes on\nwhich a majority of Republicans opposed a majority of\nDemocrats, rose to 73% of House votes. Even so, the\nConference included several notable ideological policy fac-\ntions. Some were animated by a strong sense that the\nnational government was too big and that it stifled eco-\nnomic growth; others were deeply concerned with cultural\nand moral decay. Moderate elements of the Conference\nmay have been sympathetic to the economic and cultural\nagendas of their colleagues, but they were less ideological\nWe argue that apparent party unity belied a diverse\nConference, and that this diversity was owed in part to\nmembers' personal values. Burden (2007) notes that while\nwe often think of representatives as highly responsive to\nexternal cues, such as constituency preferences, they are\noften attentive to internal or introspective cues. These cues\n\"probably do not trump partisanship on most roll call\nvotes\", but \"the conditions under which personal character-\nistics matter are widespread and predictable\" (Burden,\naddition to pursing electoral and partisan interests, mem-\nbers pursue their own \"personal policy interests and ideo-\nlogical commitments\".\nWe focus on religion as a source of personal values. The\npolitical significance of religion is owed to several factors.\nThe ethno-religious approach emphasizes belonging. In\nbelonging to a religious community, individuals are exposed\nto shared teachings that produce a common worldview, and\nthe shared social status commonly experienced by many\ncommunities of believers. Together, shared values and\nsocial experiences provide a lens through which religious\npeople view the world. To the extent that the world does not\ncomport with their norms, religion provides the basis of\npolitical grievance and engagement Wald and Calhoun-\nBrown (2011). Crosscutting these traditional alignments,\nthe religious restructuring approach emphasizes believing\nand behaving. Sometimes called the \"New Gap\", this\napproach notes the diversity within religious traditions,\nespecially on the basis of traditionalism, which is the extent\nto which individuals internalize the authority of religion.\nIn the context of the 104th Congress, the prominence of\nCatholics and Evangelical Protestants is especially notable.\nBy the early 1990s, white Catholics, especially the most\nobservant white Catholics, had been moving into the\nRepublican camp for several years (Green, 2010; Wald and\nCalhoun-Brown, 2011). For their part, Evangelical\nProtestants firmly established themselves as a key\nRepublican voting block in the late 1970s. They did not\ncomprise a majority of the Conference in the 104th Congress,\nbut evangelical groups such as The Christian Coalition pro-\nvided Republican congressional candidates tremendous\nmore than half of the Conference in the 104th Congress first\nReflecting these mass level changes, the religious com-\nposition of House Republicans changed dramatically in the\nlatter half of the 20th century. Guth (2014a) reports that in\nRepublicans identified as Mainline Protestant. This is down\ndecline was accompanied by growth in the proportion of\nwhite evangelicals and white Catholics. The proportion of\nwhite evangelicals more than doubled (from 6.9% of House\nCongress). In that same timeframe, the percentage of white\nCatholics in the Republican Conference nearly doubled\nRepublican Conferences were dominated by Mainline\nProtestants, Republican Conferences in the 1990s were\nmore pluralistic. It is because of this increased level of plu-\nralism that we expect to find diverse policy agendas among\nHouse Republicans in the 104th Congress.\nReligious agendas\nThe kinds of issues that comprise religiously informed pol-\nicy agendas are myriad. We consider the following: cultural\ntraditionalism, poverty and social welfare, and the role of\ngovernment. These are operationalized as a count of\nspeeches aligned with specific codes (Baumgartner and\nCultural traditionalism is central to Evangelical\nProtestants and Catholics. The perception among evangeli-\ncals of cultural degradation played an important role in their\nBlackstone and Oldmixon 3\npolitical mobilization.Among Catholics, cultural traditional-\nism has been tremendously important to the Bishops\nConference, which has encouraged mass level activism\namong lay Catholics in support of Catholic teachings. We\nuse the following speech topics as proxies for cultural tradi-\ntionalism: Civil Rights, Minority Issues, and Civil Liberties;\nImmigration; Law, Crime, and Family Issues; Presidential\n( ). We expect that\nCatholic and evangelical representatives will speak at higher\nlevels on these issues than their colleagues, most of whom\nare Mainline Protestants.\nPoverty and social welfare are likely to be salient among\nEvangelical Protestants and Catholics alike. Catholic teach-\ning on these kinds of issues lends itself to policy focused on\nalleviating the structural factors that produce poverty and\ninjustice. This has commonly entailed support for a robust\nwelfare state. Many evangelicals, however, oppose govern-\nment expansion generally and expanding the welfare state\nspecifically (Koopman, 1996), as it is thought to create a\ndependence on government and undermine virtue. While\nCatholics and evangelicals approach these issues differ-\nently, they were and are central to both. We use speeches\non the following topics as proxies for poverty and social\nwelfare: Health; Social Welfare; Education; Labor,\n( ). We expect\nthat Catholic and evangelical representatives will speak at\nhigher levels on these issues than their colleagues.\nFinally, we consider the role of government. We do not\nhave a particular expectation for Catholics. Among evan-\ngelicals, however, the scope of government was (and is) a\nmajor flashpoint. Barker and Carman (2000) argue that\nEvangelical Protestants are more likely to support a limited\nrole for government given the centrality of individual work\nand virtue inherent in Calvinist theology. We use the fol-\nlowing speech topics as proxies for the role of government:\nNational Budget and Debt; Taxation, Tax Policy, and Tax\nReform; Budget Requests for Various Agencies and\nIndependent Commissions; Intergovernmental Relations\n( ). We expect evangelicals to speak at higher\nlevels on these issues than their colleagues.\nData. The difficulty in sussing out the influence of religion\non legislative behavior is in deciding where to look. The\nfocus on roll call voting among congressional scholars is\nunderstandable, given that this is where policy is made. It is\nnot, however, where policy is developed, and it is also\ntightly controlled by the leadership. Roll call votes present\nmembers with dyadic choices that may not represent the\nfull range of their preferences. Moreover, the concept of\nrepresentation is broader than a focus on roll call analysis\nwould suggest. MCs have myriad opportunities to act on\nbehalf of their constituents. Sulkin (2005) and Schiller\n(1995), for example, have found that members actively pro-\nmote their agendas via the introduction and co-sponsorship\nof legislation.\nEchoing Burden (2007: 8), we look for personal represen-\ntation \"upstream in the policy process\", where members\nhave greater agency. Specifically, we analyze one-minute\nspeeches. Party leadership solicits speeches and distributes\ntalking points (Harris, 2005), but rank and file members have\naccess to the floor outside of leadership coordination efforts.\nWhile acknowledging that there are multiple avenues for\npersonal representation, we focus on speeches because by\nthe 104th Congress they had become an increasingly impor-\ntant tool among legislators, especially after cameras were\nplaced in the chamber in 1979. Gingrich himself noted that\nspeeches provide an opportunity to discuss complex topics\n(Maltzman and Sigelman, 1996). While few members are\npresent in the chamber while one-minute speeches are deliv-\nered, \"every House office is tuned in to C-SPAN to watch\nmorning proceedings in the chamber... Members and staff\nwatch one-minute speeches or at least monitor the subjects\nbeing discussed, along with considerable interest in which\nMembers are speaking\" (Shogan et al., 2013: 3). One-minute\nspeeches are a vehicle through which representatives can\nexpress their legislative policy agenda to constituents and\ncolleagues (Maltzman and Sigelman, 1996), and they may be\na vehicle for shoring up electoral goals (Morris, 2001).\nWe identified 787 speeches delivered by Republicans\nduring the second session of the 104th Congress (3 January\ncally to measure the extent to which members from differ-\nent religious communities articulated distinct agendas. We\nemploy the major topic and subtopic codes and the coding\nguidelines of the Policy Agendas Project (Baumgartner and\nJones, 2014) to classify speeches on the basis of their con-\ntent. The Policy Agendas Project Codebook includes 30\nmajor topics (e.g. Macroeconomics, Health, and Education).\nWithin each major topic, there are more nuanced subtopic\nmeasures. For example, the major topic Macroeconomics,\nincludes nine subtopics including: inflation, prices, and\ninterest rates; unemployment rate; and national budget and\ndebt. We assigned up to two major and subtopic codes for\neach speech.3\nFigure 1 reports the number of speeches addressing each\nof the PolicyAgendas Project's major topics. Because some\nspeeches are assigned two major topic codes, the total of\nspeech issues is 976. A total of 25% of speeches address\nGovernment Operations, which includes discussion of\nbudget requests, appropriations for multiple departments\nand agencies, intergovernmental relations, government\nefficiency and bureaucratic oversight, congressional opera-\ntions, nominations and appointments, and presidential\nimpeachment and scandal. A total of 20% of speeches\naddress Macroeconomics. Health is the third-most popular\ntopic with 13% of speeches addressing a health-related\npolicy. These include, for example, speeches on health care\nreform, insurance availability, and regulation of the drug\nindustry. The remaining 40% of speeches are distributed\nacross the remaining topics.\n4 Research and Politics \nMember religion is our primary independent variable of\ninterest. We measure this in two ways. Drawing on the\nethno-religious approach, and given the movement of\nCatholics and Evangelical Protestants to the Republican\nParty at the mass level and in Congress, we classify mem-\nbers by religious tradition following Steensland et al.(2000),\nand include two indicator variables (Catholic = 1;\nEvangelical Protestant = 1) in our models. Drawing on the\nrestructuring approach, we include a measure of religious\nsalience, which is based on whether MCs mention religion\nin their Congressional Directory biography. Given that\n\"religious traditionalists usually put greater importance on\nthe role of religion in their lives, this measure provides\nanother partial proxy for the theological orientations that\nare more difficult and time- consuming to ascertain\" (Guth,\ngressional district classified as Catholic and Evangelical\nProtestant to control for district-level religion.4\nWe include additional controls for member ideology,\nwhether a member is a party leader, the safeness of the\nmember's district, sex, and tenure.\nMember ideology\nDW-NOMINATE scores were used to measure member\nideology (Poole and Rosenthal, 1997). These scores range\nfrom \u00ad1 to +1, with \u00ad1 being the most liberal and +1 being\nthe most conservative. All Republicans in the 104th\nCongress had NOMINATE scores in the positive, conserv-\native range. Pearson and Dancey (2011), Maltzman and\nextremism to predict the level of speechmaking. We predict\nthat the most conservative members of the Conference will\nbe the most energized and most likely take to the floor.\nParty leaders\nParty leaders have a responsibility to promote the interests\nof their party (Cox and McCubbins, 1993). Thus, we\ninclude an indicator variable (party leader = 1) to control\nfor the possibility that leaders will more likely to use the\nfloor to that end (Maltzman and Sigelman, 1996).\nSafeness\nSafeness is measured as a percentage of the vote received\nby members in their most recent election. Safer representa-\ntives may feel less pressure from the district, and less\nurgency than vulnerable representatives to position-take.\nSex.Pearson and Dancey (2011) find that congress-\nwomen are more likely to give one-minute speeches as a\nway to make up for their underrepresentation. We include\nan indicator variable (male = 1) to control for that\npossibility.\nTenure\nWe use tenure as a measure of seniority. This is the total\nnumber of consecutive years served by the member.\nBecause more senior members have less of a need to dem-\nonstrate policy competency (Morris, 2001; Pearson and\nDancey, 2011), we expect seniority to be negatively associ-\nated with speech participation.\nSpace, Science, Technology, and Communications\nImmigration\nCommunity Development and Housing Issues\nAgriculture\nDefense\nPublic Lands and Water Management\nTransportation\nEnvironment\nForeign Trade\nEducation\nBanking, Finance, and Domestic Commerce\nEnergy\nLabor and Employment\nInternational Affairs and Foreign Aid\nCivil Rights, Minority Issues, and Civil Liberties\nLaw, Crime, and Family Issues\nSocial Welfare\nHealth\nMacroeconomics\nGovernment Operations\nCount of Speeches by Policy Agenda Major Topics\nFigure 1. Count of speeches by Policy Agendas Project major topic codes.\nBlackstone and Oldmixon 5\nAnalysis and discussion\nTable 1 illustrates the process by which speech variables\nwere constructed using the speeches of Representative Jon\nLynn Christensen (NE). Representative Christensen deliv-\nered five speeches; they are catalogued below. One speech\naddresses two issues, creating a total of six speech issues. A\ntotal of 50% of Mr Christensen's agenda is allocated to\nHealth while 16.67% is allocated to Law, Crime, and\nFamily Issues, 16.67% is allocated to Macroeconomics,\nand another 16.67% is devoted to Labor and Employment.\nThe subtopic-based measure of the agenda provides more\nspecificity. A total of 33% of Mr Christenen's agenda is\nfocused on general Health issues. Each of the following\nissues is the subject of 16.75% of Mr Christensen's atten-\ntion: Alcohol/controlled and illegal drug abuse treatment,\nand education; Illegal drug production, trafficking, and\ncontrol; National budget and debt; and Fair Labor Standards.\nUsing the process outlined above, we count the number of\nspeeches delivered on each topic by each member.\nNext, we subject these data to multivariate analysis. Our\ndataset includes 236 Republican MCs. On average, each\nmember delivered 3.3 speeches. The standard deviation is\n5.6, suggesting considerable variability in speech participa-\ntion. Indeed, the modal level of participation is zero. Rep.\nCass Ballanger (R-NC), at the other extreme, delivered 44\nspeeches. A total of 30% of the conference did not partici-\npate in speech-making. Thus, we assess the religious dimen-\nsion of one-minute speeches using zero-inflated Poisson\nregression (Long, 1997). This two-part estimator accounts\nfor the absence of speeches on the part of many members.\nThe first stage is a logit model that estimates the probability\nof never speaking. The second stage estimates the number\nof speeches given (see also Branton, 2009; Rottinghaus and\nBergan, 2011). Thus, we distinguish between members who\nnever speak and members who sometimes speak. The statis-\ntically significant Vuong test indicates that the zero-inflated\nPoisson is superior to a standard Poisson model.\nTable 2 reports the results of the count analysis. First, we\nask, \"which members are the most likely to participate in\nspeech-making?\". We included ideology, tenure, sex, safe-\nness, party leader status as covariates in the first stage model.\nTo our surprise, the usual suspects did not consistently dis-\ncriminate between participants and non-participants.\nPrevious work suggests that we should expect significant,\npositive effects for ideology and party leadership, and sig-\nnificant, negative effects for tenure, sex, and safeness. The\nonly significant relationships to emerge were between speech\nparticipation and ideology in the culture and social welfare\nmodels, and between speech participation and tenure in the\nsocial welfare model. Those relationships, however, are not\nin the expected direction.\nWe next consider whether religious belonging affects\nthe substance of speech participation. The short answer is,\nyes and no. In the cultural model, Evangelical Protestants\ndeliver more speeches than their colleagues. The marginal\neffect seems modest, but given that the modal level of par-\nticipation is zero, even modest changes are notable. Catholic\nMCs, however, are indistinguishable from their colleagues.\nThe lack of a significant finding among Catholics is notable\ngiven the centrality of these issues to the Bishops\nConference. Lay Catholic opinion on cultural issues, how-\never, does not clearly align with Church teachings, and our\nfindings may reflect that. Indeed, although the relationship\ndoes not achieve conventional significance, the proportion\nof Catholics at the district level is negatively associated\nwith speech participation.\nOn social welfare issues, we find that religious salience\nis negatively related to speech participation. Moreover,\nwhile Catholics are indistinguishable from their colleagues,\nCatholics for whom religion is salient discuss social wel-\nfare more frequently. While evangelicals are also indistin-\nguishable from their colleagues, MCs from strongly\nevangelical districts discuss social welfare more frequently.\nThese representatives may be using their speeches to repre-\nsent the religious constituencies in their districts, instead of\nrepresenting their personal religious agendas\nFinally we note that Catholic members spoke more fre-\nquently on the role of government than their colleagues.\nReligious salience was also negatively related to speech\nparticipation. Evangelicals were indistinguishable from\ntheir colleagues, but MCs from strongly evangelical dis-\ntricts more frequently addressed the role of government. To\nprovide context, during this timeframe there was a\nTable 1.

Budget and tax issues, which are major compo-\nnents of speeches in this domain, were highly salient. There\nhas been some debate as to whether fiscal issues were ever\nreally a priority among evangelicals, or whether it was a\npriority among evangelical interest group elites looking to\nestablished common ground with establishment Republican\nParty elites. This finding suggests that the role of govern-\nment was not a core priority among evangelical members,\nbut that it was a priority for members representing evan-\ngelical districts.\nConclusion\nThe Republican Conference of the 104th Congress was a\nhighly unified governing party. Our results do not under-\nmine that characterization.\nIt is notable and important, however, that even in the\ncontext of a highly unified Conference, we find that\nBlackstone and Oldmixon 7\nmembers used speech participation to pursue their own\nagendas, and that these agendas were in part informed by\nreligion. After controlling for the usual suspects, we found\nthat Catholic members dedicated significantly more agenda\nspace to the role of government, and Catholics for whom\nreligion was salient devoted significantly more agenda\nspace to social welfare. For their part, evangelicals devoted\nsignificantly more agenda space to cultural issues. Across\ndenominations religious salience was negatively related to\nspeech participation on social welfare and the role of gov-\nernment. Moreover, while speech participation provides\nopportunities for legislators to engage in personal represen-\ntation, it also provides opportunities to represent constitu-\nency religious communities. The logic is essentially the\nsame: legislators with limited opportunities to engage in\nrepresentation using floor votes look for other outlets.\nSpeeches provide an outlet where legislators can advertise\nand position-take.\nWe speculate that the modest impact of religion is partly\nthe result of party messaging strategies. Leaders orchestrate\nspeeches to promote their party's agenda (Harris, 2005). To\nthe extent that leaders orchestrated speeches on the key\nissues assessed in this paper, it may be difficult to identify\npersonal representation. Moreover, speeches are often a tool\nused by members whose central issues are not on the legisla-\ntive agenda (Rocca and Gordon, 2010), whereas the issues\nwe considered were very much on the agenda. These factors\nmakes the presence of even modest findings important.\nThe religious dynamic of speech participation varies,\nand moving forward it is important to consider whether it\nvaries over time and by party. In the short term, however,\nour findings demonstrate that legislators represent diverse\nreligious policy agendas, and that even unified parties can\nbe disrupted by \"personal representation\" operating below\nthe surface of party labels. We do not suggest Republicans\nexperienced internecine conflict, but our findings help\nexplain why party-line voting dropped precipitously in the\nshort term and fully recovered in the long term. In the short\nterm, party unity could not be sustained in the face of even\nmarginal religious variation within the Conference, to the\nextent that religious variation is associated with diverse\npolicy preferences. In the long term, that variation has\ndiminished as the Conference proportion of Evangelical\nProtestants and white Catholics has increased at the expense\nof Mainline Protestants. The Republican Conference in the\n113 Congress was as conservative and as cohesive as it has\never been, but roots of this were established 20 years ago.\nAs the analysis demonstrates, even the most unified party\ncan be undermined when legislators bring their personal\nreligious values to bear on the policy process.\n"
