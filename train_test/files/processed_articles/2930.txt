During the last years, there has been the impression that relationship\nlending loses ground. Quantitative rating systems and new developments in the\nbanking industry, for instance securitization, were believed to repress relationship\nlending. Considering the traditional prevalence of relationship lending in Germany,\na change in the banks' business model may have a large impact on economic growth\nand employment, especially for the small and medium-sized firms, which fund them-\nselves to a large degree with bank loans.\nThe aim of the present study is twofold: First, we analyze, which determinants\ninfluence the choice of a housebank and, second, we check, whether relationship\nlending lost ground in Germany. Our main contribution to the literature is our data\nset: The data set we use in this paper is significantly larger than the ones used in\nthe literature so far. Moreover, the data set is not only composed of a cross-section\nof firms, but there are time series of each firm, so that we are able to keep track of\nthe lending relationships.\nThe results of our study can be summarized in three core statements: (i) Especially\nsmall, young and R&D intensive firms seek a housebank as their lender. This result\nis in line with the theory: Especially those firms have problems to convince potential\nlenders of the quality of their projects. (ii) Firms of high creditworthiness tend to\nopt for relationship lending. (iii) Contrary to the presumption from above, there\nare no hints that relationship lending in Germany has lost ground in the last years.\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nBeim Hausbankprinzip (\"Relationship lending\") gehen Bank und Unternehmer eine\nenge Bindung ein.

Relationship lending exists all over the world,\nincluding market-oriented banking systems such as the United States.2 One of\nthe countries where relationship lending is supposed to be especially prevalent is\nGermany, often cited as the classical example of a bank-based system with strong\ncustomer-borrower-relationships (see, eg, Elsas and Krahnen (1998)). The so-called\nhousebanks are supposed to be particularly important for the financing of small and\nmedium-sized companies, which play a crucial role in the German economy.\nGiven the importance of relationship lending in Germany it is remarkable that there\nare only a limited number of contributions on this subject. In this study, we focus\non the influence of borrowers' characteristics. We examine the importance of two\nissues. First, it is typically assumed that relationship lending helps to reduce in-\nformation asymmetries between borrower and lender by the close contact between\nthe two parties. Therefore, companies that are especially exposed to high informa-\ntion problems, such as small, young companies and companies with a high R&D\nintensity, should choose a relationship lender. The evidence of our study is broadly\nconsistent with these predictions.\nThe second issue refers to a firm's creditworthiness. The influence of a firm's credit\nquality on relationship lending is seen contradictorily in the theoretical literature.\n1 Christoph Memmel and Ingrid Stein: Deutsche Bundesbank. Christian Schmieder: Deutsche\nBundesbank and European Investment Bank. This paper represents the authors' personal\nopinions and does not necessarily reflect those of the Deutsche Bundesbank or the European\nInvestment Bank. We thank Wolfgang Bessler, Ralf Elsas, Bronwyn Hall, Martin Hellwig,\nWouter van Overfelt, Andreas Pfingsten, Birgit Schmitz, Isabell Schnabel, Mechthild Schrooten\nand the participants at the GBSA 2006 Workshop, the Kleistvilla Workshop 2006, the Verein\nfuer Socialpolitik 2006 Annual Congress, the DGF 2006 Annual Meeting, MPI Bonn seminar,\nBundesbank Research Council and the Bankenworkshop 2007 at the University Muenster for\nfruitful comments.\nDepending on the model a firm's credit quality influences the likelihood of relation-\nship lending negatively (Bolton and Scharfstein (1996)), positively (von Thadden\n(2004)) or the relation is inversely u-shaped (Rajan (1992)). Our study shows that\nfirms of a high credit quality tend to choose a relationship lender and is therefore\nin line with the predictions of von Thadden (2004). He explains this result by a\npositive selection process over time where bad firms are more likely to switch from\na relationship lender to an arm's-length bank than high quality firms do.\nFinally, we also examine whether the importance of relationship lending decreased\nsince the mid 90s. Due to better information processing facilities, more sophisticated\nrating tools and the growth of securitization market banks are supposed to become\nmore and more to credit factories. However, we cannot observe such a trend for\nGermany.\nWe differ from previous empirical papers in several ways: Unlike most studies for\nathke\n(2006)) or other countries (see eg Detragiache et al. (2000)), our analysis is based\non a comprehensive database. The data set used for this study comprises a total of\n2004. Moreover, in contrast to previous literature our data set is not only a cross-\nsection of observations, but contains also the time dimension. Thus, we are able to\nstudy how differences between firms and differences over time influence relationship\nlending. Finally, our definition of relationship lending differs from the literature\nwhich, except to Elsas (2005), refers only to the number of lending relationships\nas indicators for relationship lending.3 While this variable is certainly related to\nthe concept of relationship lending, it is too restrictive regarding large companies\nas such companies typically have several lending relationships. Hence, we focus on\nthe degree of concentration of debt on one bank, but consider also the number of\nlending relationships.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the hypotheses on the nature\n3 This statement applies to the literature regarding the determinants of relationship lending.\nPapers which take relationship lending as explanatory variable take a richer set of variables.\nof relationship lending in Germany. In Section 3 we provide an overview of the\nunderlying data set. Section 4 addresses descriptive statistics and shows first results.\nThe results of the regressions are presented in Section 5. Finally, section 6 concludes.\n2 Hypotheses\nWe will begin with a short overview on the theoretical literature investigating the\nimportance of borrower characteristics for relationship lending; this represents the\nstarting point for the empirical analysis. We will summarise the predictions in three\nhypotheses.\nIn their review of the financial intermediation literature, Bhattacharaya and Thakor\n(1993) conclude that informational frictions - asymmetric information and propri-\netary information - \"provide the most fundamental explanation for the existence of\n(financial) intermediaries\". This characterisation of banks applies particularly for\nrelationship lenders. Relationship lending implies close ties between borrower and\nlender; this facilitates the information exchange between the two parties and thereby\nenables credit rationing to be avoided. Lenders invest in gathering information from\ntheir client firms, and borrowers are more inclined to reveal proprietary information.\nAs information asymmetries are especially large for small, young companies, we\nexpect that relationship lending will be more likely if a company is relatively small\nand young. In our analysis, we take the logarithm of the company's assets and of\nthe time since the company's formation as a proxy for size and age, respectively.\nFurthermore, we expect relationship lending to become more likely if the firm is\nR&D or knowledge-intensive, as proprietary information exists in such companies.\nAs the firm's R&D intensity cannot be directly measured, we alternatively refer to\ninformation on the R&D and knowledge intensity of the firms' industry sector. The\npreceding discussion leads us to hypotheses 1 and 2:\nHypothesis 1: The probability of relationship lending decreases with the bor-\nrower's size and age.\nHypothesis 2: The probability of relationship lending increases with the\nR&D and knowledge intensity of the borrower's industry.\nRelationship lending does not only come along with benefits, but also with costs.\nFor example, companies with a relationship lender may face only a soft-budget\nconstraint which makes it difficult for the relationship lender to enforce the credit\ncontract (Bolton and Scharfstein (1996), see also Dewatripont and Maskin (1995)).\nIn the event of a default, it is much easier for the company to renegotiate the debt\ncontract if there is one main creditor than if there were multiple creditors. Thus,\ncompanies with a relationship lender have a greater incentive to default strategically,\nwhile firms with a large number of creditors tend to be disciplined by their lenders.\nHowever, the costs of inefficient renegotiation which exist with multiple creditors\nprevail also if the firm defaults for liquidity reasons. Thus, there exists a trade off\nbetween preventing strategic defaults (best achieved with multiple creditors) and low\ncost of renegotiation in case of liquidity defaults (best achieved with one creditor).\nAs companies of low credit quality face a substantial risk of a liquidity default, they\nshould especially make sure that they receive high liquidation values and choose one\ncreditor or at least concentrate their borrowing on one bank, the relationship lender.\nPartly contradictory results are delivered by the models of Rajan (1992) and von\ntionship lending may be costly, namely the hold-up problem. Unlike arm's-length\nlenders, relationship lenders obtain private information about borrowers which en-\nables them to stop inefficient projects, but gives them also an \"information monopoly\".\nThey could threat not to prolong a loan, thereby enforcing relatively high interest\nrates and reducing the incentives of the firm's owner. Thus, relationship lend-\ning is valuable for stopping inefficient projects whereas arm's length debt is good\nfor providing high incentives. Rajan shows that firms of low credit quality prefer\narm's-length debt, whereas firms with medium-quality projects tend to choose a\nrelationship lender. High quality firms are indifferent.\nThe model of von Thadden (2004) analyzes also the hold-up-problem, but, unlike\nRajan (1992), it is assumed that binding long-term contracts are not possible (see\nalso Sharpe (1990)). At the refinancing stage, the terms of the credit contract\nare then determined by competition between the inside (relationship) lender and\npotential outside investors. He shows that there is a positive selection process where\nbad firms are more likely than high quality firms to switch from the insider lender to\nan arm's-length bank. Therefore, high-quality firms are more likely to be financed\nby relationship lenders.\nWe measure a firm's creditworthiness with its probability of default (PD), which is\nderived from a separate model.\nHypothesis 3 summarises the above discussion:\nHypothesis 3: The probability of relationship lending depends on the bor-\nrower's creditworthiness.\nHypothesis 3a: The probability of relationship lending decreases with the bor-\nrower's creditworthiness. [Bolton and Scharfstein (1996)]\nHypothesis 3b: The probability of relationship lending is low for firms of low\ncredit quality, high for medium-quality firms and mediocre for\nHypothesis 3c: The probability of relationship lending increases with the bor-\nrower's creditworthiness. [von Thadden (2004)]\nNext, we shall present the data used for our empirical study, namely the databases\nused to compose the final data set underlying the actual study and the respective\ndata set referred to.\nThe final database used in this study is composed of three different databases\nof the Deutsche Bundesbank: i) the German credit register (\"MiMiK\"), contain-\ning single bank-firm credit relationships, ii) balance sheet data of German firms\n(\"Jalys/Ustan\") and iii) balance sheet data and audit reports of German banks\n(\"BAKIS\"). The data set used for this study thereby provides information as to\nwhether a bank grants credit to a specific firm (through data set i) as well as the\ncharacteristics of the corresponding firms (ii) and banks (iii).\n(i) Credit register (MiMiK)\nThe credit register contains quarterly data on large exposures of banks to individual\nborrowers or single borrower units (eg groups). Banking institutions located in\nGermany are required to submit reports if their exposures to an individual borrower\nor the sum of exposures to borrowers belonging to one borrower unit exceeds the\nthreshold of EUR 1.5m (formerly DEM 3m) once in the respective quarter.4 As the\nbanks have to report the quarter-end indebtedness, and due to the borrower unit\nrule, a significant portion of single exposures in the database are below EUR 1.5m\n(see Schmieder (2006).) In the German credit register, the concept of indebtedness\nis broadly defined, i.e. the concept of \"credit\" comprises a wide range of on-balance\nand off-balance sheet loans and bonds, but positions of the trading book are not\nincluded.5\nThe information contained in the credit register is considerable and makes it a valu-\nable basis for research projects: In the last quarter of 2004, for example, the credit\nregister contained more than 750,000 reported bank-borrower-relationships. Besides\ncredit exposure, the German credit register collects other information about borrow-\ners, namely their name, domicile, country, legal form, assignment to a borrower unit\nand the industry sector. As for the lender, the name and banking group are recorded.\nWhen using this register for academic purposes, one has to be very careful in order to\navoid double-counting exposures contained in the credit register.6 For the underlying\nstudy, sources for double-counting have been systematically investigated and taken\ninto account as outlined below in order to avoid misleading results. First, the credit\n4 See section 14 of the German Banking Act.\n5 In 1996 changes were made to the definition of credit exposures and reporting institutions. In\nparticular, credit derivatives were included in the definition of credit exposures and the concept\nof \"single borrower unit\" was extended to include risk units.\n6 The reason is that the German credit register was established for regulatory purposes and not\nprimarily for academic studies. See also Schmieder (2006)\nregister does not only contain direct loans, but also guarantees, namely cases where\nbanks provide a guarantee for a loan of another bank. In the latter case, the name\nof the bank which benefits from the guarantee is not available. Given that both\na direct loan and a guarantee show a lending relationship omitting guarantees for\nthe current analysis would be misleading. The consequence is as follows: while the\ninclusion of guarantees may overstate exposures at the disaggregated level of single\nfirm-bank relationships (which will be taken into account), the credit register nets\nout guarantees at the borrower level.\nSecond, double-counting may occur because of loans to civil-law associations (\"Gesell-\nschaften b\u00a8\nurgerlichen Rechts\"). The indebtedness of such associations is not only\nshown in the data of the respective association, but is also reflected in the indebt-\nedness of individual borrowers that are partners of the civil-law association and\nliable for the association's debt. To prevent double-counting of exposures, loans to\ncivil-law associations are omitted from our analysis, and we calculate the borrowers'\nindebtedness excluding their liabilities to civil-law associations.\nThird, the indebtedness of borrower units may be overstated, as it is calculated\nsimply by summing up all loans to borrowers belonging to this unit. Compared\nwith balance sheet data of a proportionate consolidated group, the sum of loans in\nthe credit register may be much higher than in the balance sheet. However, given\nthe very limited number of borrower units in this study (11 of 3231 companies), the\neffect can be regarded as negligible.\nii) Corporate balance sheet data\nJalys/USTAN, the corporate balance sheet database of the Bundesbank, is one of\nthe most comprehensive databases for German non-financial firms. For the 1990s,\nof balance sheets in the sample has decreased, reaching a level of about 18,000 in\n2004 (see below). Balance sheet information is available for roughly 140 items (both\nfrom tax or trade balances). Furthermore, the database contains information on the\nfirms' industry sectors, domicile, founding year, number of employees and type of\naccounts7.\nThe Jalys/USTAN database was established for the rediscount business of the\nDeutsche Bundesbank. Until 1999, the Bundesbank was required to purchase bills of\nexchange that were backed by three parties known to be solvent. German firms were\nobliged to submit their annual accounts to the Bundesbank for examination of their\ncreditworthiness. The drop in the number of accounts since 1998 is connected to\nthe fact that the discount credit facility in the context of bill-based lending was not\nincluded by the European Central Bank in its set of monetary policy instruments\nTwo aspects are of special interest. First, small SMEs tend to be underrepresented\nin the data set, particularly for the more recent years. However, one has to keep in\nmind that, contrary to other data sets, SMEs are included in the first place and that\nthe data are extensive for both medium-sized and large companies. Second, resulting\nfrom the collection mechanism a certain quality bias seems to exist. For the 1990s,\nthe bias is relatively limited (see Stoess (2001)). For the period since 2000, the data\nset is representative for medium-sized and large companies, but, concerning smaller\nfirms (ie smaller SMEs), there is a bias towards high-quality firms (see Ismer et al.\n(2007)). We will account for this fact in the regressions.\n(iii) The balance sheet data of the German banks (BAKIS)\nThis database comprises the annual balance sheets and profit & loss accounts of all\nGerman banks and of some types of financial service providers (trade balances). In\naddition, it contains the yearly quantitative audit reports, which include information\nabout the bank's loan quality and its regulatory capital. The database consists of up\nto about 250 items of the annual accounts and 300 items of the audit reports. Due to\nthe ongoing consolidation in the German banking sector, the number of institutions\n(iv) Matched data set\nFor the purpose of this study, we used merged data from all three data sources.\n7 The structure of the accounts changed for balance sheets collected after 2002. In general, the\nstructure became more detailed. For some positions, though, a one-to-one translation of the\nold scheme to the new one is not possible.\nWhereas the German credit register and the balance sheet data of German banks\n(BAKIS) are based on a common identifier for banks and can therefore be easily\nmerged, the match between the credit register and the corporate balance sheet data\nproved being difficult as there is no common identifier for the firms: The firms were\nmatched based on five criteria: i) their name, ii) location, iii) legal form, iv) their\nindustry and v) an indicator comparing a firm's total indebtedness as stated by the\ncredit register relative to bank loans shown by the balance sheet data. The last\ntwo criteria were primarily used as additional criteria in case of uncertainty about\nthe validity of the match.8 If two firms in the credit register and in Jalys/USTAN\ndiffered only to a minor extent regarding the first three criteria, we checked whether\nthe firm changed its name, legal form or domicile. Besides, additional information\nfrom the internet was used to check the correctness of the match.\nAs mentioned above, we also compared a firm's indebtedness according to the credit\nregister and a firm's bank loans according to Jalys/USTAN for the match. While this\ncomparison is generally meaningful, two caveats have to be mentioned for the un-\nderlying case: First, Jalys/USTAN contains only bank loans included in the balance\nsheet. The credit register, however, comprises on- and off-balance sheet bank loans,\nand information about the type of loan is only available from mid-1996. Second,\nthe two data sources refer to different definitions. Whereas Jalys/USTAN applies a\nlegal definition of indebtedness, the credit register follows an economic perspective:\na firm's bonds (or bills of exchange) hold by a bank are classified as bonds (or bills of\nexchange) in the corporate balance sheet statistics, for example, but as bank loans\nin the credit register. Moreover, if a bank grants a loan to a borrower in which\nit holds a stake, this particular 'loan' is classified as a loan in the credit register,\nbut as a shareholder's loan in Jalys/USTAN. Besides, the credit register may also\nunderstate a firm's bank loans: Written off loans, for example, are not included in\nthe credit register yet are included in Jalys/USTAN. Due to these differences, we\nused the ratio between the indebtedness according to the credit register and bank\n8 The industry classification is to some extent discretionary. Regarding comparisons of indebt-\nedness, see the discussion below.\nloans in Jalys/USTAN only to indicate the correctness of the match.\nWe matched 3,288 firms for which the credit register and Jalys/USTAN contained\noverlapping data at least for one year. We eliminated 57 firms (or 277 observations)\nwhere the total indebtedness according to the credit register exceeded total assets\naccording to Jalys/USTAN, therefore making data errors very likely.9 The final\nmatch data set used for this study consists of annual data for 3,231 firms of which\nIn order to align the data sources with one another, the higher frequency of the\nquarterly credit register data was reduced in two ways: i) by taking the values of\nthe quarter to which the accounts (Jalys/USTAN) refer to and ii) by calculating four-\nquarter averages. Whereas the former method is more precise, the latter method\nmay mitigate one of the shortcomings of the credit register, namely that only loans\nabove EUR 1.5m are included. By referring to averages of quarterly values (case\nii), smaller loans which exceed the threshold only in one quarter are more likely to\nbe captured. Our final data set contains 15,947 observations when aggregating with\nmethod i) and 16,349 observations when aggregating with method ii).\nThe resulting overall database has three dimensions: a time dimension, a dimension\nfor the lenders and a dimension for the borrowers. In order to be able to use a panel\nframework, one of the three dimensions of the data set was eliminated: the lender\ndimension, to be replaced by means of summarising statistics of all lenders of a firm.\nThe respective procedure is explained in Appendix 1.\nOne might be concerned about the representativeness of our final data set. In\nprinciple, the final data set might be biased because of two reasons: i) due to\nthe matching procedure companies may have not selected randomly and ii) due\nto truncation in the credit register a company's indebtedness may not shown in a\nreliable way. We will discuss both problems in the following.\n9 Potential errors in the source data were accounted for as follows: If only one or two observations\nof one matched firm showed a ratio (of the total indebtedness according to the credit register to\nthe total assets according to Jalys/USTAN) above 100%, we eliminated only these observations,\nas data errors seemed to be random. However, if more than half of the observations of a matched\nfirm showed a ratio above 100%, we excluded all observations of the respective firm as the data\nerrors were apparently systematic in these cases.\nTable 3 and 4 contain information regarding problem i) and compare our final data\nset with the firms in the balance sheet statistics which have not been matched. It gets\nclear that the typical firm in our final data set is about 3 times larger (measured in\nterms of sales) than the typical not matched firm. This size bias becomes also evident\nwhen the final data set is compared to the total credit register data.10. Nonetheless,\nthe median firm in the final sample is still relatively small and generates a revenue\nof EUR 16m. Besides, the balance sheet statistics is rather problematic regarding\nsmall companies (see page 8) as well as the credit register is as the threshold of EUR\n1.5m is especially acute for small companies.\nTable 3 also shows some information about the debt structure of matched and not\nmatched firms. The match was conditional on the fact that a firm has at least one\nlending relationship. Thus, our final data set does not contain companies which\nborrow only from non-banks and rely, for example, only on trade credits. This fact\nexplains why the share of loans to total assets is a little bit higher in the final data\nset than in the data base of all not matched firms. Table 4 shows the industry\nstructure of the two data sets. There are significant differences concerning some\nindustries. For example, the share of retail trade is in the final sample only half of\nthe value of all not matched firms, probably due to the fact that especially many\nsmall companies belong to this industry. However, the industry structure of the\ndata sets are overall similar.\nTable 5 contains information about the potential bias in our final data set caused by\nthe threshold of EUR 1.5m in the credit register (problem ii). The table shows two\nalternative ratios combining values of the indebtedness in the credit register with\ninformation from the balance sheet, ie i) the ratio of balance sheet indebtedness in\nthe credit register to bank loans in the firm's balance sheet statistics and ii) the\nrelation of total indebtedness in the credit register to bank loans, total bonds and\nacceptances. It becomes evident that the credit register is likely to contain the bulk\nof banks' claims for most companies in our sample. However, there are a number\n10 The median loan in the total credit register data is about EUR 1.5m (only positive loans\nconsidered), the median loan in the final sample is EUR 2.7m.\nof companies where the debt values in the credit register and in the firms' balance\nsheet statistics are not comparable and the indebtedness in the credit register is\neven larger than in the firm's balance sheet statistics as in the latter data set banks'\nclaims may be included in trade credits or other positions.\nOverall, our data set seems suitable to examine the determinants of relationship\nlending. However, one has to keep in mind that our data sample is not representative\nregarding very small companies and that we restricted our sample to companies\nwhich have at least one lending relationship with a bank.\n4 Descriptive statistics and first results\n4.1 Descriptive statistics\nDefinition of relationship lending\nWe refer to the definition of relationship lending posited by Petersen and Rajan\n(1994). Accordingly, relationship lending exists if a firm has close ties to a financial\ninstitution. The empirical literature suggests several possible indicators to measure\nrelationship lending, such as the duration of a bank-borrower relationship, the num-\nber of lending relationships or a high share of debt financing by one bank.11 We\ntake the latter, namely (i) a high portion of debt financing by one bank, as our main\nindicator.12 However, we also consider (ii) the number of lending relationships as\nan alternative measure in order to enhance the robustness of the results.\nAccording to definition (ii), we call a bank a relationship lender if a firm has one sin-\ngle lending relationship with a bank in contrast to another firm which has multiple\n). The reasoning for choosing the number of lending\nrelationships as a proxy is that exclusivity of a bank relationship fosters the ties be-\ntween banks and firms. However, focussing on the number of lending relationships\n12 It turns out that a bank that is the dominant lender in one year tends to be the dominant lender\nin the following year. Therefore, firms with a dominant lender tend to have long relationships\nwith this lender, ie the first and third measure of relationship lending are correlated.\nalone may be too restrictive: While this definition may be appropriate for some\nfirms, particularly smaller ones, larger firms will typically have several lending rela-\ntionships.13 In order to account for more general cases, we also define relationship\nlending as the case in which there exists a bank with a dominant exposure and set\n) of the total bank loans of this firm\n(case (i)).\nA high share of financial debt at one bank, has empirically been shown to be a good\nproxy for relationship lending. Elsas (2005) empirically examined the quality of\nseveral potential indicators for relationship lending, eg number of lending relation-\nships and the duration of the relationship. He asked the banks for each customer in\nhis sample if they classified themselves as relationship lender and compared these\nself assessments with the different possible indicators for relationship lending. It is\nshown that a high portion of debt financing by one bank has the highest explanatory\npower.\nIn the following, we refer to a dummy variable for definition (i) and the logarithmised\nnumber of lending relationships (definition ii). Both measures are only based on\ninformation from the credit register, as the definitions of debt are too different in\nthe credit register and the corporate accounts statistics. We may thereby overstate\na bank's debt financing (as part of bank loans are not shown in the credit register).\nTo account for this fact, we apply relatively strict measures of relationship lending\n(minimum share of a firm's bank loans of 80% or even more), so the identified\nrelationship lenders are likely to be those found via more common definitions of\nrelationship lending and \"full\" information on the credit side.\nDescriptive statistics\nTable 6 contains descriptive statistics for our main indicator of relation lending,\na high concentration of borrowing. Accordingly, 58% (54%) of the firms in the\nsample raise at least 80% (90%) of their bank loans from one bank (aggregation\nmethod i) (values of the balance sheet quarter)). The figures are slightly lower\n13 In our sample, the average number of lending relationships is 2.7, while Degryse et al. (2004)\nreport a mean of around 1.3 lending relationships for Belgium and Sapienza (2002) 9 for Italy.\nusing aggregation method ii) (averages of quarterly values).\nTable 7 gives information on the distribution of the number of lending relationships\nin the sample. Using aggregation method i) nearly 50% of the companies in the sam-\nple have only one lending relationship and roughly 90% of the firms have 5 lending\nrelationships or less. The maximum is 115 lending relationships. With aggregation\nmethod ii) the share of firms with only one lending relationship goes down to 40%,\nreflecting the higher likelihood that a firm has only one lending relationship for one\nquarter than for four quarters. The shares of having two or more lending relation-\nships increase slightly, so that the 90%- and higher quantiles are similar to the other\ndistribution.\nTable 8 shows the pairwise correlations of different house bank indicators. The\ncorrelation between the logarithmised number of lending relations, RL80%\n(each variable according to both aggregation methods) is at least (-)71% . At the\n0.1% level, all variables are significantly correlated. This makes it clear that the\nindicators contain very similar information.\nTable 9 summarises descriptive statistics for our explanatory variables. We use a\ndefault risk measure (PD), which is calculated from the balance sheet data and can\nbe interpreted as a probability of default.14 For the empirical study, we censorized\nthe profitability measure (return on assets) at one percent and 99% to deal with\npotential data outliers.15\nNext, we investigate our hypotheses using some descriptive statistics and simple\ntests before moving forward to the regressions. We concentrate on one indicator,\nconcentration of debt of at least 80% at one bank. Table 10 shows that there is a\nstrong negative correlation between a firm's size and its concentration of borrowing.\n14 For this purpose, we used a binary logistic regression model based on balance sheet data\nbetween 12 and 24 months before default classified as default balance sheets. See Krueger\n15 This means that we set those profitability values below (above) the 1%-quantile (99%-quantile)\nexactly equal to the respective quantile.\nThe share of companies which borrow at least 80% of their credit from one bank\nsteadily decreases with firm size. The same holds true for the share of the largest\nlender. This outcome is in line with our expectations (Hypothesis 1) that especially\nsmall informationally opaque firms choose a relationship lender.\nTable 11 gives the means of firm variables subject to different size classes and con-\nditioned by the relationship lending status. More specifically, firm age, R&D inten-\nsity and variables about a firm's quality (for example equity ratio) interfere with\nsize and are therefore analysed conditional on the firm size. Table 11 shows that\nR&D-intensive firms are more likely to choose a relationship lender. In each size\nclass, companies with a relationship lender have a significantly higher R&D intensity\nthan companies without a relationship lender. The only exception are very large\ncompanies where no significant difference exists. This evidence is consistent with\nHypothesis 2 according to which R&D-intensive companies are exposed to higher\ninformation asymmetries and therefore tend to concentrate their borrowing on one\nbank. However, the relation between age and choosing a relationship lender is not\nin line with hypothesis 1. Whereas small companies with a relationship lender are,\non average, significantly older than small companies without a relationship lender,\nthe reverse is true for large companies.\nHypotheses 3a, 3b and 3c examine the influence of a firm's quality on relationship\nlending. Accordingly, the relationship between a firm's credit quality (measured\nby its PD or equity ratio) and the likelihood of relationship lending can be nega-\ntive, inversely u-shaped or positively. As table 11 shows, medium-sized and large\ncompanies with a relationship lender exhibit significantly higher equity ratios and\nsignificant lower PD-values than medium-sized and large companies without a re-\nlationship lender, while small companies do not differ significantly with respect to\nboth variables. This evidence indicates that high-quality firms above a certain size\nthreshold tend to choose a relationship lender which is in line with hypothesis 3c\nand to some extent with hypothesis 3b.\nTable 12 contains information how regional competition in the lenders' market (mea-\nsured by the Hirschman-Herfindahl index, HHI) influences relationship lending. Re-\nlationship lending is unlikely if the HHI is very low and regional competition in the\nlender's market is very high. In the next section, we apply regression techniques to\nfurther examine the above hypotheses.\n5 Regressions\nIn the regressions, we focus on the variable \"high share of debt financing by one\nbank (80% level)\" as an indicator of relationship lending (RL80%\n). Additionally, we\nrun regressions with alternative indicators of relationship lending.\nAs our dependent variable is a dummy variable, we use probability models. A\nshortcoming of probability models for panel data sets is that a fixed effects regression\nis only possible for such observations where the dependent variable changed at least\nonce during the sample period. The other observations are excluded from the sample\n(see Baltagi (2005)). This may lead to a bias as firms that change their relationship\nlending status may be systematically different than the excluded firms, namely (i)\nthe firms that permanently choose a relationship lender and (ii) firms that have\npermanently several important lending relationships. Therefore, it is difficult to\ndecide which model - fixed or random effects model - is appropriate, as a standard\nHausman test compares the results of two models with different sets of observations.\nFurthermore, in the case of our regressions, the Hausman test statistics do not\nshow clear results (the difference between the fixed and the random effects model is\nsignificant only at the 10% level). We thus use a fixed and a random effects model\nand discuss the results of both models.\nTable 13 summarises the regression results. We consider the lenders' average size as\ncontrol variable which is highly significant in statistical and economic terms. The\nnegative sign is in line with evidence for Italy according to which especially small\nbanks act as single or relationship lenders (see Detragiache et al. (2000)). Small\nbanks probably have an advantage in processing soft information which is especially\nvaluable for relationship lending (see Stein (2000)).\nWe also control for the degree of competition as measured by the Hirschmann-\nHerfindahl-Index (HHI). We find that relationship lending tends to get more likely\nthe lower the HHI and therefore the higher the competition in the lender's market\nis. The variable is significant only in the random effects specifications. This re-\nsult is generally consistent with the predictions of the model of Boot and Thakor\n(2000). The authors show that increasing competition between banks leads to more\nrelationship banking and less transaction banking, as relationship orientation helps\nto partially insulate the banks from pure price competition. The result contradicts\nPetersen and Rajan (1995). Besides, we control for the type of balance sheet (tax\nor trade balance) the information about the firm is taken from. The variable is\ngenerally not significant.\nMoreover, we included year dummies to examine the time trend in our data set.\nGenerally, the dummies are significant neither in the random nor in the fixed ef-\nfects model. The coefficients do not show a clear trend and depend heavily on the\nspecification (eg model 3 versus model 5). Therefore, our results do not support the\ncommon view that banks have developed to credit factories and relationship lending\nhas become less important.\nAccording to Hypothesis 1 we expect informationally opaque small, young companies\nto prefer relationship lending. Concentrating their borrowing on one bank may help\nsuch firms to reduce information asymmetries and to avoid credit rationing. The\nresults show that age and especially size are statistically and economically important\nvariables for determining the probability of choosing a relationship lender. If size\nincreases by 1%, the probability of relationship lending decreases by 4% in the\nrandom effects model. The coefficient in the fixed effects model is roughly the same.\nAge decreases the probability of relationship lending as well. Older companies are\nsignificantly less likely to choose relationship lending. If age increases by 1%, the\nprobability of relationship lending decreases by about 0.25% (random effects model).\nSurprisingly, the effect of age is about three and a half times larger in the fixed effects\nthan in the random effects model.\nHypotheses 2 examines whether R&D- and knowledge-intensive firms are more likely\nto choose a relationship lender. If relationship lending is an efficient instrument for\nreducing information asymmetries, R&D- and knowledge-intensive companies should\nconcentrate their borrowing on one relationship lender, as R&D activities are linked\nwith proprietary information and information asymmetries are higher. We measure\nR&D/knowledge intensity with a dummy variable which relies on long-term indus-\ntry averages. As this variable is time-constant, we can test Hypothesis 2 only in\na panel regression with random effects. The results are in line with our predic-\ntion: R&D/knowledge-intensive companies are significantly more likely to choose a\nrelationship lender. The probability increases by 13 percentage points.\nHypotheses 3a, 3b and 3c examine the influence of the firm's creditworthiness. The\ntheoretical literature is ambiguous regarding the effect of a firm's credit quality\non the probability of relationship lending. Depending on the theoretical model, a\nnegative, an inversely u-shaped or a positive relation is possible. We measure a firm's\ncredit quality with its PD (probability of default) and include a linear and a squared\nterm to capture non-linear relations. At first glance, table 13 indicates a u-shaped\ninfluence of a firm's PD on the probability of relationship lending and thus does\nnot support either of these predictions. The linear and the squared term are both\nsignificant. However, when calculating the combined effect over the range of relevant\nPD values it becomes clear that the influence of a firm's PD is negative for most\nobservations. A firm's creditworthiness affects the probability of relationship lending\npositively only for very high PD values (values beyond the 98% quantile for fixed and\nrandom effects model). Overall, the results are consistent with Hypothesis 3c which\nis based on the model of von Thadden (2004). Accordingly, there exists a selection\nprocess over time where good firms stay at their relationship bank and bad firms\nchoose an arm's-length bank. On average, relationship lenders thus finance firms of\nhigher credit quality than arm's length banks do. The results are also to some extent\nconsistent with hypothesis 3b (model of Rajan (1992)) as the hypothesis states\nthat high-quality firms are indifferent between arm's-length finance and relationship\nlending. The model derives the decision for relationship lending from a trade-off\nbetween an efficient decision about which projects to finance versus providing high\nincentives to exert effort.\nThe results are not in line with the model of Bolton and Scharfstein, which predicts\na negative influence of a firm's credit quality on the likelihood of relationship lend-\ning (Hypothesis 3a). The authors derive the optimal numbers of creditors from a\ntrade-off between preventing strategic defaults and high renegotiation costs in the\ncase of liquidity defaults. The model also makes the prediction that companies from\nnon-cyclical industries prefer relationship lending. We tested this prediction, too,\nmeasuring cyclicality by the long-run sensitivity of each industry's gross value added\nto changes in the aggregated gross value added.16 However, we cannot observe a sig-\nnificant effect. Thus, neither variable confirms the model of Bolton and Scharfstein\nOne may be concerned that endogeneity problems may influence our results and may\nlead to reverse causality. For example, age may not only influence the likelihood\nof choosing a relationship lender, but the existence of a relationship lender may\nalso increase a firm's survival probability and thereby the age distribution in our\nsample. Endogeneity problems may be relevant with regard to age and size, but are\nprobably minor important or not relevant with regard to a firm's R&D-intensity or\na firm's creditworthiness. However, as to age and size, endogeneity issues work into\nthe opposite direction as our hypothesis states. Whereas our hypothesis states that\nyoung and small companies should choose a relationship lender, the endogeneity bias\nwould lead to the effect that old and large companies are financed by relationship\nlenders. Therefore, if there is an endogenity bias, it would reduce the effect of age\nand size. This may also explain the below results that age is not robustly significant.\nRobustness checks\nWe ran several robustness checks. Firstly we checked whether the influence of firm's\nsize is due to information asymmetries or due to the fact that banks avoid concen-\ntration risks. Larger companies need, on average, more capital, which increases the\n16 Data: Statistisches Bundesamt. We run regressions for each industry with the industry's\ngross value added as the dependent variable and the aggregated gross value added as the\nexplanatory variable in addition to including a constant. The sensitivities then correspond\nwith the regression coefficient.\nconcentration risk in the bank's portfolio given the bank's size. We therefore ran a\nnew regression excluding all companies from the sample where\nloans of companyi\nliable capital of company i's smallest bank\nIn the new regression, the coefficient of size goes down sharply, in the fixed effects\nmodel by over 30%, in the random effects model even by nearly 40%. However, the\ncoefficient is still significant at the 1%-level in both models. We also ran a regression\nwhere we lowered the threshold further to 2%. Here, the effects are a little bit more\npronounced than in the model with a threshold of 5%, but the variables are, once\nagain, significant at the 1%-level.\nSecondly, we ran several regressions to check how the problem of truncation in the\ncredit register influences the results. As loans of less than EUR 1.5 million are only\npartly reported (see Section 3), the credit register shows a biased picture of the debt\nstructure of companies. Firstly, we constructed variables combining information\nfrom the credit register (CR) with the balance sheet statistics (BS). Data from these\ntwo data sources may differ because i) loans of less than EUR 1.5m are only partly\nreported in the credit register and ii) the data sources apply different definitions\nof debt. As we are only interested in the effects of truncation, we constructed a\nnew indicator for relationship lending in two steps. In the first step, we created\nan auxiliary variable which classifies a borrower as a customer with a relationship\nlender if\nRLtemp\nlargest loan according to CR\nbank loans according to BS\nRLtemp\n= 0 otherwise\n17 The Large Exposures Regulation (\"Grosskreditrichtlinie\") sets a limit of 10% above which\nexposures have to be reported to the Bundesbank.\n18 The credit register contains information about the structure of debt (off-balance sheet versus\non-balance sheet) only since 1997. Therefore, we used data on total loans until 1996 and data\nWe use a narrow definition of debt and include only bank loans in the denominator\n(see discussion in Section 3, especially Table 5). When we compare the new variable\nwith our old indicator RL80%\n, the two variables are identical in the ideal case. If the\nnew one is 0 and the old one is 1, this is probably due to truncation in the register\nas for example smaller exposures of other banks are not shown. However, if the new\none is 1 and the old one is 0, this combination is probably due to different definitions\nin the data sources. We thus combined the two indicators:\nRLBSCR\n, RLtemp\n]\nTable 14 shows the results using RLBSCR\nas the dependent variable (model 3 and\n4). The results differ quantitatively, but are qualitatively similar. The coefficients\nof size and R&D intensity are smaller with the new indicator and the effect of age is\nnot significant in the fixed effects model. We also ran regressions where we built our\nauxiliary variable refering to a broader definition of debt (bank loans, acceptances\nand bonds) and built the new combined indicator based on this broader definition.\nThe results are similar to the specification with RLBSCR\n. Except for age, these\nregressions confirm our above results.\nThe credit register shows a more reliable picture for those companies where the\nsum of loans from the credit register is relatively high compared to the debt in the\nbalance sheet. Therefore, we ran a second robustness check regarding truncation by\nrestricting our observations to those companies where the sum of loans in the credit\nregister is least 80% of the corresponding amount in the balance sheet statistics.19\nAs Table 14 (model 5 and 6) shows, coefficients and significance levels change only\nminor. Size, age and credit quality are significant in the random and the fixed effects\nspecification as well as R&D-intensity in the random effects model (which cannot\nbe considered in the fixed effects model).\nFurthermore, as especially small companies are exposed to the problem of truncation,\nwe conducted a third robustness check with respect to truncation where we excluded\n19 We used the first coverage ratio of Table 5 as the indicator. As the credit register provides\ninformation about balance sheet loans only since 1997, we used a firm's total indebtedness\nsmall companies (assets below median) from our sample. The regression also leads\nto similar results (results not reported).\nFinally, we conducted several robustness checks with respect to our dependent vari-\nable. We used the (log of) the number of relationships as the dependent variable.\nThe results are similar to those above except that age is not significant anymore,\nwhile the significance of size increases. As the two variables are significantly cor-\nrelated, the coefficient of size may also partly show the effect of age. Moreover,\nwe changed the threshold of our relationship lending indicator. We increased (de-\ncreased) the threshold to 90% (70%), ie banks that finance at least 90% (70%) of a\nfirm's loans are now classified as relationship lenders. The results are very similar\nto the above results. Finally, we calculated our relationship lending indicator based\non aggregation method ii, which uses the yearly average values of the credit register\ninstead of the values of the balance sheet quarter. The results are once again very\nsimilar.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this study, we empirically analyse factors that determine relationship lending in\nGermany. Unlike most previous empirical contributions, the data set used in this\nstudy is much more comprehensive.\nDeparting from the theoretical literature, we examine the importance of two issues:\nFirstly we investigate whether relationship lending reduces information asymmetries\nand thereby helps credit rationing to be avoided. In line with this argument, we\nfind that small, young and R&D-intensive firms tend to choose a relationship lender.\nWhereas the effect of size and age is a common result in the literature, the effect\nof the R&D-intensity is partly in contrast to the international evidence (see eg\nDetragiache et al. (2000)). Due to underdeveloped equity markets in Germany\nR&D-intensive firms rely more heavily on bank credits than in other countries.\nRelationship lending may therefore be a substitute for equity financing.\nSecondly, we examine how a firm's credit quality influences the likelihood of rela-\ntionship lending. From a theoretical point of view, the influence is not clear. We\nfind that firms of high credit quality tend to choose a relationship lender. This is in\nline with a positive selection process over time where good borrowers stay at their\nrelationship lender and bad borrowers switch to (outside) arm's length banks.\nFinally, we also investigate whether relationship lending became less important since\nthe mid 90s. Due to better information processing facilities, more sophisticated\nrating tools and the growth of securitization market banks are said to be turning\nmore and more into credit factories. However, we cannot observe such a trend for\nGermany, given our definition of relationship lending.\nThis data set makes it possible to investigate further important questions concerning\nrelationship lending. Possible research topics are: the duration of lending relation-\nships, the impact of relationship lending on a firm's funding costs, and the behavior\nof a relationship bank when the borrower is in financial distress.\nReferences\nBaltagi, B.

From the credit register we obtain the following information about the\nindebtedness of the four firms A1, A2, B and C with respect to the banks 1, 2, 3,\n4 (See Table 1, please note that the firms A1 and A2 belong to the borrower unit\nTable 1: Data from the Credit Register (extract)\nFirm Bank Year Indebtedness (th EUR)\nA). As mentioned above (see 3), not all exposures reported in the credit register\nare above the threshold of EUR 1.5m. The reason why bank 1 has to report the\nexposures to the firms A1 and A2 is that the combined exposure, ie the exposure to\nthe borrower unit A, is above the threshold. The exposure of bank 4 to firm B has to\nbe reported because presumably this exposure was above the EUR 1.5m threshold\nat least once in the preceding quarter (and the requirement to report depends on\nthe maximum exposure during the preceding quarter whereas the exposure to be\nreported is that of the quarter end).\nWe condense the data set by i) aggregating the firms to borrower units where ad-\nequate (firm in balance sheet statistics is a group) and ii) by replacing the lending\ninformation by summary statistics. The data processing in our example results in\nthe data set as displayed in Table 2.
