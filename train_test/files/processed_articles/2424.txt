Introduction\nIn America, a large majority of teens have their own cell phone, and almost two thirds of school age\nchildren (age 12\u00ad17) go online daily [1,2]. Social media and social networking online have emerged as\na cultural reality over the past 25 years. By September 14, 2012 Facebook reportedly reached 1 billion\nregistered users worldwide. Online experiences have become progressively integrated into all aspects of\nlife, so much so that for today's tech savvy youth, an online presence is an expected part of their social\nlife. The reality of their modern social experience is that being social means being online and mobile.\nAs such, the separation of social contexts--online versus offline--may be an old way of thinking.\nThe social processes that are augmented, replaced, or otherwise affected by pervasive forms of\npersonal technology are myriad. Individuals across continents can work together seamlessly in real time.\nFriends can stay in contact via their mobile web apps, and countless other innovations have made life\nbetter with the use of technology. While the benefits of these new ways of forming and maintaining\nsocial connections may seem countless, these developments also create divergent, and new negative\nsocial experiences. Of particular concern to contemporary youth is cyberbullying victimization--a subject\nthat continues to garner interest in both academia and general public forums. To the casual observer,\ncyberbullying continues to be highlighted in the news media as a new and growing threat to youth in\nAmerica. For example, as of 25 November 2014 the New York Times has published over 190 articles\nrelated to cyberbullying since 2003, 22 of which were printed since 2013. This attention may come in\nspite of research suggesting trends in cyber bulling victimization appear stable [3].\nMore empirical work on cyberbullying victimization continues to emerge that in many respects\nconfirms the media message that cyberbullying victimization is serious, and has significant negative\neffects for victims. For example, cyberbullying victimization has been linked to a number of negative\nconsequences including decreased academic performance, diminished perceptions of safety, depression,\nanxiety, reduced self-esteem, self-harm, emotional distress, and suicidal ideation among others [4\u00ad14].\nRecent work has also explored the link between online victimization and \"real world\" behavioral\nconsequences [15,16]. The present study explores the relationship between traditional bullying\nvictimization and cyberbullying victimization with the intent to better understand how these forms of\nbullying relate to one another among a large national level sample of American youth. Over time, one\nof the questions that has emerged from the empirical cyberbullying literature has been--is cyberbullying\nan extension of traditional bullying victimization? As we see it, the question is--is cyberbullying\nvictimization nested within the broader context of traditional bullying victimization, or is cyberbullying\nan isolated free standing construct?\n2. Literature Review\n2.1. Traditional Bullying\nResearch on bullying began appearing in the social science literature base with regularity in the latter\npart of the 1970s. Most of this work was European, (particularly Scandinavian) and since that time\nthe base of knowledge on this topic has become increasingly mainstream and global [17\u00ad22]. While\nthe majority of students do not experience bullying (e.g., [16]) research suggests that males are\nsignificantly more involved as both bullies and victims [18,22,23]. Students who are new to high school\n(incoming freshmen) experience more bullying victimization [23]. Unnever and Cornell [24] find\nbullying victimization was reported more frequently by girls and students in the lower grades. Bullying\nvictimization has been linked to forms of aggressive behavior such as frequent fighting, fighting-related\ninjury and weapon carrying for both boys and girls [18,25].\nLongstanding definitions of the phenomenon generally refer to three major components of behavior\nwhich have been codified as distinguishing bullying from other forms of conflict among youth: (1) the\nintent to harm; (2) repeated behavior; and (3) and an imbalance of power [26]. Additionally bullying has\nbeen identified as repeated acts of physical or verbal aggression with intent to humiliate the victim [21].\nOver time, specific attention has been paid to the classification of bullying through establishing\nmore nuanced typologies; direct overt bullying (including verbal and physical) and indirect (social and\nrelational which can include social exclusion) [27\u00ad30]. Others have classified bullying typologies as\nphysical, verbal, and relational [31]. While these typologies are inclusive, encompassing a wide range\nof bullying forms and tactics, what remains to be seen is just how \"typical\" manifestations of\ncyberbullying will, or will not, fit within them. Are they more appropriately conceptualized within verbal\nbullying due to the distal nature of interactions, alongside verbal and physical bullying as a core typology\ndue to conceptual or operational overlap with both forms, or separately from traditional bullying altogether?\nIn contrast to the traditional bullying literature, which has evolved over time to include well-accepted\ndefinitions, refined measures, and empirical examination across diverse populations, the cyberbullying\nresearch base is still comparatively young. Research into the extent and nature of cyberbullying began\nin earnest less than 10 years ago, but in that time tremendous progress has been made in understanding\nits prevalence, victims, perpetrators, and consequences. Yet, important questions remain surrounding\nthis relatively new form of victimization. As is the case with other related forms of cybercrime\nvictimization, such as cyberstalking or online harassment, it is not clear whether cyberbullying is a\nunique behavior, separate and distinct from its physical counterpart or simply an extension of traditional\nbullying carried out in cyberspace [32].\nMost definitions of cyberbullying implicitly suggest that cyberbullying is essentially \"bullying in\ncyberspace.\" For example, von Mar\u00e9es and Petermann [33], (p. 468) define cyberbullying as \"...bullying\nvia the use of the internet, mobile phone, or a combination of both...\" Similarly, Patchin and\nHinduja [10], (p. 152) explain that cyberbullying is \"willful and repeated harm inflicted through the\nmedium of electronic text.\" A more detailed definition provided by Smith et al. [34], ( p. 367) describes\ncyberbullying as \"An aggressive, intentional act carried out by a group or individual, using electronic\nforms of contact, repeatedly and over time against a victim who cannot easily defend him or herself.\"\nThe common thread underlying each of these definitions is intentional harm experienced by victims\nthrough an electronic medium. The operational definition of cyberbullying for the current study reflects\nthis focus on the consequences experienced by the victim, and the commission of the cyberbullying act\nthrough electronic means.\nOpportunities for cyberbullying victimization have grown with the expansion and integration of\ntechnology in society. Indeed, convenient communication tools such as emails, instant messages, and\ntext messages delivered by phones, tablets, laptops, and even videogame devices have made these\nopportunities nearly ubiquitous. It is important to point out, however, that estimates of the extent of\ncyberbullying differ depending on cyberbullying definitions, measurement choices, and populations\nbeing studied by researchers. With this caveat in mind, estimates of the prevalence of cyberbullying are\nwidely varied, and occasionally provide an inconsistent portrayal of the nature and scope of\nvictimization. For example, in 2006 Li [35] reported that about 25% of students in a Canadian sample\nof adolescents had experienced cyberbullying, whereas a 2010 work by Mishna and colleagues [36]\nreported that half of their sample of Canadian middle and high schools students had been victims of\ncyberbullying. Examining a global convenience sample of adolescent Internet users in 2008, Hinduja\nand Patchin [37] reported cyberbullying victimization estimates of 32% for boys and 36% for girls\n(though they also noted no statistically significant difference between boys and girls as either victim or\noffender, p. 142). These three studies are fairly representative of the vast body of work that has estimated\nthe prevalence of cyberbullying victimization, in addition to illustrating the point that these estimates\nIn addition to being prevalent, cyberbullying is also harmful. While cyberbullying experiences will\nbe unique with distinct effects, an increasing number of studies suggest that experiencing cyberbullying\ncan be very emotionally damaging to victims. Victims can experience a host of negative consequences\nranging from self-harm to avoiding school to depression [6,13,16]. For example, Hinduja and\nPatchin [41] have suggested that cyberbullying victimization can lead to offline behavioral problems\nsuch as delinquency. Kowalski and colleagues [42] concluded that those who experience cyberbullying\nvictimization often themselves become cyberbullies and vice versa.\nAs the previous discussion illustrates, much is known about the nature of cyberbullying. This\nknowledge base continues to grow as global research emerges addressing the extent to which victims of\ntraditional bullying who are targets of threats, rumors, insults, exclusion, exploitation, and physical\nassault are also targeted online by their bullies in the form of cyberbullying [4,9,43]. Common\ncyberbullying behaviors include these same traditional behaviors, such as receiving threats and insults\ncarried out through various online communications such as online gaming forums, text messages, social\nnetworks, emails, and other websites. Cyberbullies may also exclude victims from online activities, such\nas multiplayer videogame channels. If bullies are expanding their domain to into these online realms, it\nsuggests that cyberbullying may be an extension of the traditional behaviors that victims are enduring at\nschool. If, however, cyberbullying victims tend to only experience these online harms then cyberbullying\nmay indeed be a distinct form of victimization [44,45].\nWhile some contextualized research supports the assertion that there is overlap between bullying\nvictimization and cyberbullying victimization [38,46] scholars have not fully investigated which\nbullying and cyberbullying victimization experiences overlap. The current study focuses on comparing\nand contrasting several potential indicators of conceptual and measurement overlap in a large, nationally\nrepresentative sample of victims. Addressing this issue is important for the ongoing study of both\nbullying and cyberbullying in America. Any conceptual and measurement similarities and differences\nhave the potential to inform future research, inductive theory development, and policy related\nyouth victimization.\n3. Data and Methods\nData for the present study originated from the 2009 National Crime Victimization Survey--School\nCrime Supplement (NCVS-SCS). The School Crime Supplement of the NCVS is considered an \"occasional\"\nsupplement, but it has been collected with regularity since 1995 (every 2 years beginning 2003).\nThis supplement collects interview data from NCVS household members age 12\u00ad18 who had attended\na qualifying school in the past six months (typically between January and June), and asks them\nto reference the current school year. The 2009 SCS sample nets nearly 4000 cases in a national level\nmulti-stage cluster sample. Within this sample 1232 students reported experiencing some form of\ntraditional bullying victimization, and 269 reported a least one cyberbullying victimization experience.\nThe analyses included three stages, with each stage designed to allow differences between traditional\nbullying and cyberbullying to emerge. In the first stage we present simple cross tabulations of traditional\nbullying victimization and cyberbullying victimization to illustrate the degree of overlap that exists\nbetween them. We attempt to provide evidence which would facilitate either a \"grand\" bullying variable\nin the future--or on the other hand--support including cyberbullying as an additional measure in future\nbullying research. In the second stage of analysis we further assess the constructs of traditional bullying\nvs. cyberbullying using a technique similar to alpha modeling to assess the relative stability of these\nphenomena both independently and collectively. Given the prevalence of overlap between victimization\ntypes, the common theme of bullying victimization, and the research questions at hand, we proceed by\ngenerating a single reliability score to illustrate congruity in bullying victimization types. Finally,\nwe explore similarities and differences in the constructs through exploratory factor analysis techniques,\nwhich articulate the unique characteristics of cyberbullying victimization. Conducting an exploratory\nfactor analysis allows us to further investigate the relationship between traditional and cyberbullying\nvictimization responses, specifically assessing cross-item associations that exist in the data. Across these\ntechniques we adjust for the dichotomous nature of our victimization indicators by using a tetrachoric\ncorrelation matrix. Most readers are familiar with the typical Pearson correlation matrix and the\ncorresponding coefficients presented (r). However, when exploring entirely discrete data the most\nsuitable process differs from the traditional method.\nThe principal question addressed in this study hinges on how bullying, both traditional and cyber\nforms, are conceptualized and measured in quantitative research. More specifically, how do they fit\ntogether for quantitative analysis? To that end, we use a number of advanced, and in some cases\nnon-traditional analytical techniques, to explore a unified bullying construct.\nBullying Variables\nThe 2009 NCVS-SCS included 13 different items that address bullying in general. Seven of these are\nsuited to address the more traditional concepts of schoolyard bullying. The remaining six items have\nbeen tailored to address technology-driven bullying victimization experiences. Each of these items are\ndichotomous in nature, students reporting yes or no answers. The individual items were introduced to\nthe respondent through the following statement: \"Now I have some questions about what students do\nthat could occur anywhere and that make you feel bad or are hurtful to you. You may include events you\ntold me about already. During this school year, has another student....\" Traditional Bullying is addressed\nthrough SCS items including: \"...has another student...\" (1) \"Made fun of you, called you names, or\ninsulted you?\"; (2) \"Spread rumors about you?\"; (3) \"Threatened you with harm?\"; (4) \"Pushed you,\nshoved you, tripped you, or spit on you?\"; (5) \"Tried to make you do things you did not want to do, for\nexample, give them money or other things?\"; (6) \"Excluded you from activities on purpose?\"; and\n(7) \"Destroyed your property on purpose?\" Collectively, any positive response to any of these categories\nresults in a score of Bullying  = 0.75, suggesting a certain degree of success in the measurement of\ntraditional bullying.\nThe cyberbullying items included in the survey were: (1) \"Posted hurtful information about you on\nthe Internet, for example, on a social networking site like MySpace or Facebook?\"; (2) \"Threatened\nor insulted you through email?\"; (3) \"Threatened or insulted you through instant messaging?\";\n(4) \"Threatened or insulted you through text messaging?\" (5) \"Threatened or insulted you through online\ngaming, for example, while playing a game, through Second Life, or through XBOX [Live]?\"; and\n(6) \"Purposefully excluded you from an online community, for example, a buddy list or friends list?\"\nThese six items when combined would result in a Cyberbullying score of  = 0.63. 1\nInterestingly, the school crime supplement has evolved over time and added questions related to\ncyberbullying as they emerge in social sphere. The online social world changes very quickly and\nseemingly overnight the online social experience can evolve. The 2009 iteration adds questions related\nto victimization on specific online communities that cater to youths playing online video games.\nCyberbullying item 5 addresses these online communities and provides us an opportunity to capture\nand include possible trends in victimization occurring on the leading edges of American youths\nsocial experiences.\n4. Results\nOur primary question addressed the classification of cyberbullying in relation to traditional bullying\nvictimization. Specifically, does cyberbullying victimization typify an \"extension\" of school yard\nbullying, or does it manifest as a separate and distinct construct? In general, our results provided mixed\nsupport for either position.\n4.1. Bivariate Associations\nTable 1 presents a two-way table relating the prevalence of traditional bullying victimization\nto cyberbullying victimization. First, it should be noted that 29% of the sample reported some form\nof bullying victimization within the past school year. In Table 1, we present the distribution of cases,\npercentages (by row, column, and total N), and ultimately the bivariate correlation between cyberbullying\nof cyberbullying victims report also experiencing traditional bullying victimization. And another 18.18%\nof traditional bullying victims report experiencing cyberbullying, supporting the intuitive position that\ntraditional bullying and cyberbullying are indeed related. Importantly, we find that cyberbullying\nvictimization is experienced outside of traditional bullying victimization. In this sample, 16.73% of those\n1 Original responses were coded categorically where respondent options included \"never\", \"once or twice this school year\",\n\"once or twice a month\", \"once or twice a week\", and \"almost every day\".\nstudents reporting cyberbullying victimization report no traditional bullying victimization experiences.\nThese results suggest that to some degree cyberbullying victimization is not an entirely collateral\nexperience and is experienced by some as a separate form of victimization. There may be key features\nof the offenders, the victims, or the situations themselves that are accountable for the discrepancy in\nmodalities. That being said, the majority of cyberbullying victimization is experienced by those already\nexposed to traditional school yard bullying.\nTable 1. Two-way presentation of Bullying and Cyberbullying Victimization.\nBullying\nNo Yes Total\nCyberbullying\nNo\nYes\nNote: * Row Percent; ** Column Percent.\nTable 2 elaborates on the basic association between bullying and cyberbullying victimization\npresented in Table 1 by further unpacking the individual cyberbullying elements relative to the victims'\nbroad scale victimization experiences. This table (Table 2) presents the number of individuals reporting\neach of the specific forms of cyberbullying victimization as well as a proportion of the number of line\nitem victims that also reported traditional bullying victimization. Of the six different cyberbullying\nvictimization line items, five items display a substantial proportion of their victims also experiencing\ntraditional forms of bullying. Among the cyberbullying items, the lowest proportion reporting traditional\nbullying experiences is the item Cyber 5, which refers to victimization through online gaming outlets\nsuch as XBOX Live (0.69). Based on these results, and the need for clarity regarding the position of\ncyberbullying in the broader scheme of victimization, we further explore evidence that would illustrate\nthe clearest picture in conceptual overlap and/or differentiation. Stage two of the analysis therefore\nexplores deeper connections between individual elements of bullying victimization.\nTable 2.

Item Reliability Analysis\nAlpha reliability coefficients (Cronbach's alpha) are regularly used to demonstrate internal\nconsistency, or the strength of a collection of variables to represent a construct [46]. This consistency or\nstrength is then conveyed through a score between 0 and 1 that represents the inter-item correlation.\nMore generally speaking, the higher this score, the more we assume the items to be congruent in\ncapturing the same broad construct. As noted earlier, using entirely discrete data can be problematic.\nHowever, the Kuder-Richardson method compensates for, or accommodates binary data. Thus results\ndisplayed here in Table 3 can be interpreted as they would in a traditional alpha reliability analysis, yet\nthe figures are derived from an alternative formula. As noted above there are several items available in\nthe NCVS-SCS that address issues of bullying victimization as well as items that address cyberbullying\nvictimization. As a part of the exploratory process we evaluate the alpha scores associated with the two\npossible conceptual classifications: (1) cyberbullying as a standalone construct; and (2) cyberbullying\nas a nested component of a more inclusive general bullying phenomenon. The results of this modeling\nprocess are presented in Table 3.\nTable 3. Combined Bullying Victimization Kuder-Richardson Reliability Modeling (N = 4346).\nItem Brief Description\nItem Item-Rest Item\nDifficulty Correlation Variance\nFirst, we address the combined traditional and cyberbullying measures in one cumulative bullying\nconstruct, for which the Kuder-Richardson coefficient is 0.76. Second, we assess the constructs\nindependently. The coefficient for the traditional bullying items alone is 0.75, and finally, the \"alpha\"\nscore for the collection of cyberbullying items alone is 0.63. 2 Each of these scores individually suggests\nthat the internal consistency of the measured concept is fair to acceptable. The comparatively lower\n2 The removal of one cyberbullying variable addressing victimization through online gaming mediums improves\nthe Cronbach's alpha score of the cyberbullying composite, suggesting a possible sub group or sub form related\nspecifically to online gaming.\nalpha score for the cyberbullying measures alone does not necessarily mean it is a poorer construct;\nfewer items and fewer cases available for that portion of the analysis make a lower score somewhat\njustifiable. In sum, there are two key results to note from the examination of item reliability. First, both\nthe traditional bullying items and the cyberbullying items create relatively stable and consistent\nindependent constructs. And second, the inclusion of cyberbullying elements into a cumulative \"grand\"\nbullying measure does not markedly increase the stability of the traditional bullying scale.\n4.3. Principal Components Analysis (PCA)\nClassification of cyberbullying can also be addressed through further exploratory analysis. This\nprocess allows us, in essence, to process a number of individual items in such a way that their natural\ncorrelational patterns will produce variable clustering (or loadings). While there are a number of\npotential factor analytic solutions, the simplest and most direct for our purpose is a variation on the\nprincipal components method. Specifically, the nature of the research question suggests the possibility\nof correlated factors, supporting oblique (promax) rotations that naturally accommodate correlation of\nthe factors rather than the alternative orthogonal (varimax) rotations. Table 4 presents a principal\ncomponents analysis, derived from the tetrachoric correlation matrix, and the factor from a promax\nrotated solution when limiting to two factors. The two loaded components closely align with traditional\nbullying victimization and cyberbullying victimization constructs. Interestingly, initial extractions of\nbullying elements (Table 4) produce three components with Eigenvalues over 1.0. Entering all 13 items\nin a principal components analysis, we find that the elements of traditional bullying cluster on one factor\nand elements of cyberbullying victimization will cluster on another when constrained; when\nunconstrained, however, more interesting results emerge. Unlike simple evaluation of item reliability\nusing alpha scores, principal components analysis yields a variety and depth of useful, textured results.\nTraditional bullying literature suggests that there are a number of identified modes of bullying\nvictimization, yet the seven items representing traditional bullying victimization did not initially break\nout by verbal, physical, and relational forms, they remained clustered while cyber elements loaded\nseparately on another factor.\nTable 4. Exploratory PCA, Promax Rotated Solution, Two Factors (tetrachoric matrix).\nVariable Component 1 Component 2 Unexplained\nIn the interest of better understanding a data driven classification scheme, Table 5 represents\na variation in the classification scheme that parses cyberbullying elements into two sub-groups.\nThe larger of the two groups features Cyber elements 1\u00ad4 which address email, instant messaging,\ntext messaging and internet postings, where Cyber element 5 (\"Has another student: threatened or\ninsulted you through online gaming?\") and Cyber element 6 (\"Has another student purposefully\nexcluded you from an online community?\") appear to diverge from the remainder of the cyberbullying\nelements in constituting the third factor. The relative strength of the online gaming element in the third\nfactor may be important in understanding and developing the most appropriate means for classification\nof these types of victimization.\nTable 5. Promax Rotated Principal Components (Comp.) Extraction of Bullying Items (Three Factors).\nComp. 1 Comp. 2 Comp. 3 Unexplained\nThe final exploratory factor analysis provides similar results, but expands the number of allowable\ncomponents to five. This expansion presented in Table 6 facilitates further discriminatory analysis on\nwhich elements of bullying and cyberbullying will cluster differently than expected, if allowed.\nThe resulting component formations are a departure from the findings from the previous rotations in\nTables 4 and 5, and generally represent a \"spectrum\" of victimization experiences, some of which\ninvolve clustered behaviors and some of which integrate aspects of both traditional and cyberbullying.\nTraditional bullying elements break out into a mix of relational and physical typologies seen in\ncomponent 2. Component 5 is dominated by the measure of traditional bullying associated with \"making\nyou do something you don't want to\" which we have previously labeled as `coercion'. Bullying in the\nform of purposeful exclusion takes form in component 3, consisting of a traditional bullying item\nregarding exclusion from activities (Traditional 6 \"Exclusion\") in combination with a cyberbullying item\nfocusing on exclusion from online communities (Cyber 6). Component 1 consists of cyber items\npertaining to email, text, instant message and internet postings. Lastly, consistent with the results in\nTable 4, component 4 stands alone with the single item referencing online gaming.\nTable 6.

Discussion and Conclusion\nThe overarching purpose of this study was to evaluate competing conceptual and measurement\napproaches to the operationalization and classification of cyberbullying victimization. More simply,\nthe goal of this work was to examine whether cyberbullying victimization was truly a unique\nphenomenon when exploring a large data set. Each of the preceding analyses has contributed insight to\na data driven, framework aided, classification process whereby we attempt to find the best fit for\ncyberbullying victimization relative to the broader bullying victimization scheme. Results show that\nin this sample traditional bullying and cyberbullying victimization experiences are generally associated\n(rho = 0.67) and there is a great deal of overlap in the experience of both traditional and cyber\nvictimization. However, the empirical data supports operationalization and measurement of\ncyberbullying victimization as a distinct outcome. The exploration of these constructs allows us to go\nbeyond simple bivariate associations to contrast dimensional stability when operationalizing in several\ndifferent ways. We found early evidence that a \"grand\" bullying variable is viable, but not necessarily\nmore stable than traditional bullying alone. We also find that cyberbullying elements can arguably stand\nalone as a separate but related construct. Yet, critical to this is the exposure to victimization via online\ngaming communities.\nExploratory factor analysis produced a more detailed specification of bullying which delineates\ntraditional bullying elements including physical, verbal, and exclusion bullying, but importantly adds\ndimension to cyberbullying in the context of a grand bullying victimization scheme where online gaming\nstands out from other mediums such as email, text, instant message and online postings. In particular,\nthis collection of findings has great potential to create future avenues of research in the cyber-social\nrealm of youths. While cyberbullying victimization has the potential to fall within the traditional rubric\nof relational bullying dimensions as the wording of these items addresses `threat and insults', and those\nitems (traditional or cyber) addressing exclusion load together (purposeful exclusion), we have exposed\nan area where there is much to learn: online gaming communities. Today's youth experience their social\nlives in such a way that online gaming environments may share distinct similarities with the traditional\nplayground. So powerful are these dimensional differences that in all of our presented exploratory\nmodels, victimization in gaming environments commanded its own recognition. While other included\nmediums for experiencing victimization such as text or instant message could be considered facilitators\nof traditional relational bullying, online gaming may be a separate form of social world which traditional\nforms of bullying take place within. Thus, while in answering the question we set out to, we can suggest\nthat with the exception of the online gaming environment, \"cyberbullying\" is a means to experience\nrelational bullying. Yet, we cannot exclude the gaming environment as it is a part of the ever changing\ncyber social reality. As such, the online gaming world needs exploration to establish whether it should\nbe considered a tool for delivery or a nested cyber social world in which traditional forms of\nvictimization take place. The real value of this exploration may be in the admission that classifying the\nvictimization experience is conceivably unrelated to what we understand about perpetration. The\nvictimization experience may be more a reflection of the tools available within one's social circles. If\ntraditional and cyber bullying are expressions of power within the confines of a social circle rather than\na physical space, the dimensions of victimization are likely to reflect the contextualized means of the\ngroup. Perhaps the isolation of the recognition of the online gaming group within the data is a reflection\nof a uniquely clustered social structure among American youth. It may be that while many youth play\nvideo games as a part of their social experience, some small number of them live their entire social life\nwithin this arena. Further research is required in the area of bullying modality in concordance to group\nsocial settings.\nSeveral ancillary findings also arise here, some of which may be instrumental in discussions about\npolicy as well as theory. For example, while bullying and cyberbullying outcomes may be considered\nindependent but related constructs, among these respondents experiencing cyberbullying without\ntraditional bulling is uncommon. Among cyberbullying victims, only 16.73% reported not experiencing\ntraditional bullying, and only 1% of all respondents reported experiencing cyberbullying without having\nexperiencing any form of traditional bullying victimization. Conversely, and perhaps equally important,\nwe find that a large majority (83%) of cyberbullying victims report experiencing both cyber and\ntraditional bulling victimization. Furthermore, nearly 1 in 5 victims of traditional bullying is also being\nvictimized `online'. These findings are strongly suggestive that a comprehensive and integrated approach\nto prevention is appropriate. Further, the apparent predominance of overlap between the two forms\ninspires numerous questions about the etiology of offending. For example, do bullies specialize in\none form over another, perhaps as a function of rational choice considerations about skill, expertise,\nor detectability? As the multi-disciplinary study of bullying and cyberbullying moves forward, there will\nundoubtedly be opportunities to apply traditional criminological theories to better understand these\ncomplicated dynamics.\nAs with any exploratory research, several limitations of the present study must be noted. First,\na common feature of virtually all empirical analysis of cyberbullying to date is that datasets that include\nmeasures of cyberbullying are still relatively limited. Even when a nationally representative sample from\nthe NCVS is used, as in this study, the relatively broad spectrum of victimization experiences and\nrelatively few cyberbullying cases available presents challenges for analysis. Although it might be\ninsightful to work with particular subsets of cases in order to identify relationships between specific risk\nfactors and victimization sequelae (e.g., gendered or race-based cyberbullying), these relationships are\ndifficult to explore with the available secondary data. Second, the results presented here cannot address\na fundamental issue with time ordering. Thus, while some of the findings suggest that the majority of\nvictims of bullying also experience cyberbullying, without a more extensive understanding of ordering,\nwe cannot conclude that cyberbullying victimization is a logical extension of the school yard experience.\nThird, the data here are a secondary and many readers familiar with the bullying literature will note\ndeviations from the contemporary structuring of questions and examination of victim-offender overlap.\nAs these elements are not a part of the survey's design, we sacrifice specificity for a large sample of\nstudents from across the United States. Finally, a common feature of bullying definitions is the power\nimbalance between bully and victim which cannot be addressed here. The result of this may be that we\nhave cast a wider net which would include fighting among peers.\nSimilar to other emerging areas of literature, most notably the stalking/cyberstalking nexus,\ncriminologists will soon be forced to confront nuanced conceptual and measurement problems when\ndetermining how to appropriately classify and accurately capture these experiences. Relatively little\nwork to date has been published related to the similarities and differences in bullying and cyberbullying\nvictimization in the United States, despite the growing volume of work globally. Our results suggest that\nbullying victimization can be experienced with conceptual distinction and empirical overlap among\nAmerican youth, but replication with richer and larger data is a logical next step. Moreover, future\nresearchers will need to ask why bullying victimization clusters along dimensions as they do here. As\nthe field builds evidence-based consensus on these issues, the next generation of researchers will be in\nposition to move forward with theoretical as well as policy-oriented work.\nAuthor Contributions\nR. Randa and M. R. Nobles conceived of the modeling process. R. Randa completed the modeling\nand constructed the tables, wrote the methods, results, and drafted the discussion and conclusion\nsections.
