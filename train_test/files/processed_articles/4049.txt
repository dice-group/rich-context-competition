    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper introduces a spatial model of civil conflict management rhetoric to explore how the emerging norm of\nresponsibility to protect shapes major power rhetorical responses to civil war. Using framing theory, we argue that\nresponsibility to protect functions like a prescriptive norm, such that representing a conflict as one of (1) human rights\nviolations (problem definition), implies rhetorical support for (2) coercive outside intervention (solution identification).\nThese dimensions reflect the problem-solution form of a prescriptive norm. Using dictionary scaling with a dynamic\nmodel, we analyze the positions of UN Security Council members in debates over the Syrian Civil War separately for\neach dimension. We find that the permanent members who emphasized human rights violations also used intervention\nrhetoric (UK, France, and the US), and those who did not used non-intervention rhetoric (Russia and China). We\nconclude that, while not a fully consolidated norm, responsibility to protect appears to have structured major power\nrhetorical responses to the Syrian Civil War.\n",

Although non-interven-\ntion largely held sway during the Cold War, discussions of\nthe UN established the political commitment known as\nresponsibility to protect (R2P), which laid out the condi-\ntions under which the international community was required\nto intervene on behalf of beleaguered populations, some-\ntimes through force. In what is seen as a key test of R2P,\nthe permanent five members (P5) of the UNSC--China,\nFrance, Russia, the UK and the US--have disagreed pro-\nfoundly over the handling of the Syrian civil war (Gifkins,\nScholars disagree about the impact of R2P and similar\n2013). In this paper, we propose a model for how such a\nnorm might function rhetorically based on framing theory\n1999). If political actors successfully frame an event as a\nproblem invoking a given norm, then certain policy solu-\ntions become thinkable, if not inevitable. We argue that\nthis has implications for how states talk about civil con-\nflict management. Namely, conflict management rhetoric\ncan be mapped onto a two-dimensional space, where one\ndimension corresponds to problem definition (does the\nconflict involve human rights violations?), and the other\nto solution identification (is the preferred solution inter-\nvention?). Under R2P, a conflict involving large scale\nhuman rights violations such as ethnic cleansing or war\ncrimes requires an urgent international response.\nConsequently, we can expect that state agents engaged in\n\"human rights violations talk\" are also likely to engage in\nRhetoric of civil conflict management:\nUnited Nations Security Council debates\nover the Syrian civil war\nJuraj Medzihorsky1, Milos Popovic2 and Erin K.

To locate states in this space, we\nextend dictionary-based logistic scaling (Lowe et al.,\n2011) with a Bayesian dynamic model for noisy and\nbiased observations.\nWe apply the model to the UNSC debates over how to\nrespond to the Syrian civil war. Under the logic of R2P,\nstates' rhetorical positions on the two dimensions should\nbe related. To avoid assumptions about the dimensions'\nrelationship, we conduct the text analysis separately for\neach dimension and then examine the relationship. With\nsome exceptions, we see that there is a clear correlation\nbetween state positions on the two rhetorical dimensions.\nWe also find that while states leaning toward intervention\ntended to acknowledge human rights violations, not all of\nthose who acknowledged them advocated intervention.\nFocusing on the P5, we find that the US, the UK and\nFrance favored both \"violations talk\" and \"intervention\ntalk\" in these debates, while Russia and China largely\navoided both. Beginning in 2014, Russia and China\nincreasingly began speaking of violations, although per-\npetrated by ISIS rather than the government. Russia's\nuptick in \"intervention talk\" corresponded with its 2015\nmilitary deployment. In contrast, China has consistently\nfavored non-military solutions to the conflict, despite its\nincreased \"violations talk.\" This break with the model's\nrhetorical expectations is unsurprising given China's\nongoing resistance to the R2P norm.\nRhetorical space of international civil\nconflict management\nFraming in international relations\nScholars have long observed that how political leaders\ntalk about an event or issue greatly influences their audi-\nence's beliefs about the appropriate policies to follow.\nFraming is a form of rhetorical action used by policy-\nmakers to persuade their audiences that an event or issue\nis a problem of a particular kind, prescribing a particular\nmay employ salient historical metaphors or other tropes to\ninculcate in the audience a need for urgent policy response.\nThe effect of this rhetoric is amplified by both the emo-\ntional resonance of the frame and its opacity. If success-\nful, framing firmly attaches to the issue, closing or\npreempting debate and making the adoption of a certain\nset of policies that much more likely.\nThis problem-solution logic of such framing closely cor-\nresponds to that of prescriptive norms, which are explicit or\nimplicit rules stating that a certain set of actions or non-\nactions should be taken in a given situation. Constructivist\nscholars have demonstrated the power of norms in guiding\npolicy and actions at both the national and international\nlevel. They have traced, for example, the emergence and\nspread of norms regarding the use of certain weapons,\nslavery and child labor (see Checkel, 1998; Finnemore and\nhave a life-cycle, from emerging to consolidated (internal-\nized). However, a norm need not be fully consolidated to be\neffective, so long as the costs of violating the norm are\ndeemed sufficiently high (Krebs and Jackson, 2007). Even\nif political actors pay lip service to the norm for instru-\nmental reasons, this can lead to \"rhetorical coercion\" or\n\"rhetorical entrapment\" (Schimmelfennig, 2000) by which\nthe speaker is \"trapped\" or \"coerced\" into following the\nlogic of the norm to avoid the audience costs of failing to do\nso. When preferences over policy conflict, policy-makers\ncompete to achieve interpretive dominance over an issue.\nMost of the literature on foreign policy framing focuses on\nsuch contests on the domestic level. For example, Weldes\nand Saco (1996) describe interpretive struggles over \"the\nCuban problem\" in the US Congress and the White House.\nSimilarly, Paris (2002) captures how the pro- and anti-\nintervention advocates in the US government used differ-\nent metaphors to frame the Kosovo conflict in 1999 to\npromote their preferred policies.\nWe extend this logic to the international level, arguing\nthat the R2P norm has structured the rhetorical space in\nwhich different state agents contest the appropriate form of\ncivil conflict management. Although R2P may not be fully\nconsolidated in the sense of being internalized by all state\nactors, it performs a vital \"regulative function\" by requiring\nstates opposed to intervention to engage in interpretive\nstruggles over the nature of the conflict itself as a way of\npromoting their favored policy.\nThe UNSC is the appropriate forum in which to examine\nthese struggles because, while it generally suffers from\nlegitimacy deficit among UN member states (Binder and\nHeupel, 2015), it is the principal organ for shaping and\ncoordinating responses to international and civil crises.\nBoth permanent and non-permanent members perceive the\nCouncil as the appropriate venue in which to explain their\npolicies (Thompson, 2006). Despite their more limited\npowers, non-permanent members use prior consultations\nand sessions to reach out to the P5 or wider audiences\n(Hurd, 2002). The UNSC also serves to authorize the use of\nforce, in turn influencing state behavior in the international\narena (Voeten, 2005). The language used at the UNSC has\nbeen analyzed from a similar perspective by Hehir (2016)\nand Gifkins (2016), who inspected the documents approved\nby the Council for R2P's influence.\nFraming conflict management\nBefore proceeding to the analysis, some background on the\nResponsibility to Protect (R2P) norm is in order. R2P holds\nthat the international community has an obligation to pro-\ntect vulnerable groups from extreme human rights viola-\ntions such as war crimes, genocide, or politicide. Already\nMedzihorsky et al. 3\nbefore R2P, some military interventions were justified on\ngrounds of human and minority rights protection\noften accompanied calls for military intervention (Labonte,\n2013) on the grounds that it is an emergency situation\nrequiring prompt, forceful response (Bostdorff, 1994).\nThe R2P principle itself originates from a 2001 report by\nthe International Commission on intervention and state\nsovereignty, which holds that when a sovereign state cannot\nor will not protect its citizens from mass atrocities, the\ninternational community has the responsibility to protect\nthem, through force if necessary (Garwood-Gowers, 2016).\nIn 2005, the UN General Assembly formally accepted the\nresponsibility of the international community to protect\ncivilians in case any of its member states failed to meet that\nresponsibility. Many states objected strongly to R2P's\n\"third pillar\", which establishes a positive mandate to\nrespond through force as a last resort. China and Russia in\nparticular have argued that the Western P3 could use the\ndoctrine to justify serial interventions driven by self inter-\nests, and that codifying R2P in international law will lead to\nmore, rather than fewer, military interventions resulting in\never, both the General Assembly and the P5 approved the\ndoctrine, including its controversial third pillar.\nGiven the intensity of these debates over the principle\nitself, many doubted that R2P would have any impact on\nintervention practices. Following its adoption, the first\nmajor test of the principle was the Syrian civil war. The\nquestion was whether R2P would influence the positions\nof the major powers on the conflict, including major crit-\nics of the doctrine, following the logic of rhetorical entrap-\nment. If an R2P norm is operative, we should see state\nagents follow its problem-solution logic in UNSC debates\nover the Syrian war.\nWe map the UNSC debates on Syria on a two-dimen-\nsional rhetorical space. The first dimension defines the\nproblem posed by the conflict. If policy-makers succeed in\nframing conflict in terms of human rights violations, this\nimplies that the state has failed in its responsibility to pro-\ntect the population. Following R2P, those who acknowl-\nedge the violations should also be more likely to frame the\nsolution in terms of intervention, which is captured on the\nsecond dimension.\nOur spatial model has much in common with many other\nspatial models in the discipline (see e.g. Benoit and Laver,\ncharacterize directly unobservable policy preferences of\nactors, and require assumptions that are difficult to test in\nsome contexts, such as the characteristics of actors' utility\nfunctions (Krehbiel and Peskowitz, 2015). Our model does\nnot aim to automatically capture the states' policy prefer-\nences, but rather the policy-relevant content of their rheto-\nric by characterizing the framing they deploy--mapping\nthese debates using relatively light assumptions.\nAnalysis of UNSC debates on Syrian\ncivil war\nData\nIn the period of analysis, 38 UNSC meetings focused on the\nMiddle East. In addition to Syria, some also discussed other\ntopics, chiefly the Israeli\u00adPalestinian conflict. Thus, we\nhave selected only meetings in which at least 3/4 of the\nspeeches mentioned Syria and at most 1/4 of them Palestine.\nTable 1 reports the 23 selected meetings, including their\nmain topic and, if applicable, voting outcome. We collected\nthe meeting records in their official English translations.1\nWe concatenated the speeches by meeting and state, pro-\nducing 380 documents. Presiding members were included\nonly when speaking in their capacity as state representa-\ntives. Next, we excluded states who spoke at one meeting\nonly, yielding a corpus of 347 speeches by 37 states, includ-\ning 113 by P5 members.2 The corpus was cleaned of num-\nbers, punctuation and separators, set to lowercase and\nstemmed. Finally, the occurrences of the (stemmed) dic-\ntionary words were counted.\nDictionary\nTo place the speeches on the rhetorical space, we have\ndeveloped a dictionary with four classes of words, each of\nwhich include theme words associated with either end of\nour two dimensions. We identify these words using the\noutlined theory as well as the authors' background knowl-\nedge of the debates on R2P (Table 2). Accordingly, human\nrights violations (HRVs) framing includes references to\nsubjects of violence (\"tyranny\", \"perpetrator\"), different\nwords for their objects (\"women\", \"children\", \"civil-\nians\"), and descriptors associated with acts of one-sided\nviolence, such as \"crime\", \"repression\", \"torture\", \"atroc-\nities\", \"massacre\" or even \"genocide\". HRVs framing also\ncontains calls to \"humanity\" and \"moral\" as a bulwark\nagainst perceived human rights violations. On the oppo-\nsite end of the spectrum, non-HRVs framing tends to\navoid blame-casting. Conflicts are portrayed as a struggle\nbetween two parties in which violence is mostly a byprod-\nuct of armed encounters; various terms are used to describe\nviolence as two-sided and blameless. Theme words\ninclude \"crisis\", \"struggle\", \"war\", and \"chaos\". Warring\nactors are nameless \"parties\" whose \"fighting\" and\n\"clashes\" generate \"losses\" and \"casualties\" that\n\"threat[en]\" to undermine \"stability\" or \"security\".\nMoving to the second dimension, \"intervention\" fram-\ning involves portraying the government as failing its basic\ntask to protect its population--requiring immediate out-\nside action ranging from humanitarian aid to military\ninterference. The theme words associated with this frame\ninclude terms for third party intervention (\"action\",\n\"arrest\", \"intervention\", \"stop\") as well as modes of\n4 Research and Politics \nhelping victimized groups (\"assistance\", \"aid\", \"support\",\n\"deliver\"). By contrast, \"non-interventionist\" framing\ncalls for consensual engagement with the government,\nusing tools of diplomacy. Mitigating violence is seen as a\n\"process\" or \"effort\" in which the international commu-\nnity engages the target government through \"dialogue\",\n\"negotiations\" and other \"diplomatic\" means in accord-\nance with the UN \"charter\". The aim is to bring about\n\"solution\" or \"settlement\", preferably \"inclusive\" and\n\"comprehensive\", between the warring sides.\nHaving checked the dictionary against terms used in the\noriginal debates over the R2P principle, we believe the dic-\ntionary captures general features of R2P rhetoric that travel\nacross conflicts. It also includes theme words specific to the\nSyrian civil war. This means that it can be adapted to other\nconflicts through partial replacement of the words. Table 1\nin Online Appendix 1 illustrates how the dictionary words\nappeared in the context of the debates.\nStatistical model\nTo measure relative emphasis in the speeches, we adapt\nthe document score is a logistic function of the document-\nlevel counts of words attached to the positive and the nega-\ntive side of the dimension. \"Positive\" and \"negative\" are\nused in their mathematical sense and do not automatically\nconvey any normative or sentimental information. We\nassigned the positive ends to human rights violations and\npro-intervention talk, respectively.\nIn building the statistical model, we take into account\nthree factors. First, there is a degree of continuity in the\nTable 1. Included UNSC meetings.\nNo. Date Topic Outcome\nTable 2.

Second, word usage is affected by\nmeeting themes related to current events. The fact that some\nword frequencies vary across meetings reflects not only the\nchange in states' positions, but also meeting topics. Third,\nthe observations contain some stochastic noise. In short, the\nobserved word counts are a function of random noise, bias\nand rhetorical positions dependent on previous positions.\nTo account for these factors, we adopt a Bayesian\ndynamic model related to models used to extract ideal\npoints of US Supreme Court judges (Martin and Quinn,\npreferences in the UN General Assembly (Bailey et al.,\n2017). Specifically, we model the count of \"positive\" words\nW + in the speech of i th state at t th meeting\nW Binomial p N\nit it it\n+\n\n( , )\nas a Binomial draw governed by rate pit\nwith Nit\ntrials\nequal the the sum of \"positive\" and \"negative\" words in the\nspeech.

The HRVs-intervention corner is occupied by\nthe P3, plus Israel, Germany, Luxembourg, Turkey and\nAustralia. China and Russia occupy the opposite, no-HRVs/\nno-intervention corner. Notably, its occupants include\nBrazil, India and South Africa, and several African, South\nAmerican and Asian states. In support of our expectation\nthat R2P norm is regulating civil conflict rhetoric, most\nstates are located either on the main diagonal that runs from\nP3 to Russia and China, or below it. In other words, those\nwho favor intervention cast the conflict in terms of human\nrights violations, but not all those who acknowledge human\nrights violations, join them in advocating intervention.\nIt should be acknowledged that most states are located\nbetween the two clusters. They include countries geograph-\nically remote from Syria (e.g. Bosnia-Herzegovina,\nColombia, Guatemala, Rwanda, South Korea) or tradition-\nally taking middle ground at UN and other fora (e.g.\nArgentina, Portugal, Spain). Perhaps less intuitive is the\npresence of Lebanon and Syria. One might expect the\nSyrian regime to frame the conflict in terms of \"no human\nrights violations\" and \"non-intervention\", in line with their\npreference to avoid military intervention. However, Syria\nhas largely avoided talking about the civil war, and focused\ninstead on the behavior of regional actors, including accu-\nsations against Israel, Gulf states and even Turkey for their\nactions against the regime. On the other hand, Lebanon is in\na precarious situation because it suffers from conflict spill-\nover, and a strong domestic actor, Hezbollah, participates in\nthe conflict. Its representatives have devoted much space to\naddressing the domestic situation in Lebanon.\nTypical mobility on both dimensions is shown by state\nin Figure 2. In general, the 37 states maintained stable posi-\ntions on the \"solution\" dimension, but less so on the\n\"problem\" one. There, remarkably, China and France were\namong the most mobile. This is better seen in Figure 3,\nwhich shows the trajectories of the P5.3 China originally\n6 Research and Politics \nFigure 1. Average state positions in the debates.

However, as ISIS grew in strength, China began\nto utilize more \"violations talk\", thus converging somewhat\nwith the P3. Russia converged with the P3 in the same way,\nbut from a much smaller distance. Notably, Russia moved\ntoward more HRV talk (where the perpetrators are ISIS and\nSyrian rebels rather than the regime) as well as more inter-\nvention talk, and both shifts came prior to the Russian 2015\nintervention. Nonetheless, despite the P5 converging on\nthe problem identification, the states remain divided on\nthe solution, which maps onto the P5 divide over the third\npillar of the R2P doctrine. The meeting coefficients, dis-\nplayed in Figure 4, show that, in addition to the changes in\nframing adopted by the participants after 2014, the preva-\nlence of words associated with human rights violations and\nintervention increased relative to words associated with the\nother ends of the two-dimensions.\nConclusion\nThis paper introduced a model of civil conflict manage-\nment rhetoric and applied it to UNSC debates over\n8 Research and Politics \ninternational responses to the Syrian civil war. Building on\nframing theory, the model is intended to show the ways in\nwhich the emerging R2P norm regulates civil conflict man-\nagement rhetoric on two dimensions--problem definition\nand solution identification. Problems vary from conflicts\ninvolving HRVs, typically war crimes, and conflicts that\nare complex and largely blameless. Solutions range from\ncoercive intervention to more cooperative engagement.\nWe use quantitative text analysis to place the debating\nUNSC Member States on both dimensions. In line with our\nexpectations of the regulatory effects of the R2P norm,\nmost states fall on the diagonal. While the three Western\npermanent members have been more inclined to frame the\nconflict in terms of human rights violations and to call\nfor outside intervention, Russia and even more so China\nframed it more as a complex struggle amenable to non-\ninterventionist solutions. Eventually, in parallel with the\nascent of ISIS, China and Russia moved closer to the P3 by\nframing the conflict in terms of human rights violations,\nbut, except for minor movements by Russia, largely adhered\nFigure 4. Meeting coefficients. Medians with 50% and 95% intervals.\nMedzihorsky et al. 9\nto non-interventionist framing. This is consistent with the\nobservation that P5's disagreement, at least in international\nfora, goes beyond the conflict in question, and extends to\nthe norms of global conflict management themselves. To\nthe extent that R2P regulates civil conflict management\nrhetoric by states, it features most strongly in the speeches\nof the P3 and a handful of allies. However, it is notable that\nChina and Russia and other states opposed to elements of\nR2P still engaged in non-HRVs framing in the case of the\nSyrian civil war as a means of promoting non-intervention.\nThis suggests the power of such norms in regulating \"civil\nconflict rhetoric,\" even among the norm's opponents.\n"
