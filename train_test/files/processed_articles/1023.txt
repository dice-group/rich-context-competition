A version of the Telephone Interview for\nCognitive Status (TICS), proxy assessments of cognition, and difficulties in performing daily tasks were assessed.\nBlacks performed below Whites on the TICS at baseline and on proxy assessments of cognition. TICS score\ndeclined with age for Whites and Blacks, with some relative gains for Blacks. At baseline, Blacks more often had\ndifficulties in performing daily tasks, with some increase in difficulties relative to Whites with age. Differences\nbetween other groups and Whites were smaller than those between Blacks and Whites.\nDECLINING cognitive function is a determinant of several\nunfavorable outcomes among elderly individuals, in-\ncluding increases in limitations in activities of daily living\n(ADLs; Fillenbaum, Peterson, Welsh-Bohmer, Kukull, &\nPeek, & Peek, 2002). It often leads to placement in a nursing\nhospitalization, and death (Sloan & Taylor 2002). In spite of its\nimportance to health, functioning, and for maintaining in-\ndependence, few studies have examined differences in\ncognitive function among the elderly population by race or\nethnicity (see, e.g., Bohnstedt, Fox, & Kohatsu, 1994; Whitfield\net al., 2000; also see Bohannon, Fillenbaum, Pieper, Hanlon,\ndata have been lacking to assess longitudinal trajectories in\ncognitive function by race or ethnicity. Research on differences\nin cognitive performance among older adults has been impeded\nby lack of information on antecedents of observed differences\namong elderly individuals and a lack of measures on cognitive\nfunction that are valid for various racial and ethnic groups.\nStarting in early life, cumulative disadvantage, which is\nassociated with race or ethnicity, may affect functioning in late\nlife (Kelley-Moore & Ferraro, 2004). A person's cognitive\nperformance after the age of 70 years plausibly reflects the\nperson's endowments at birth as well as the history of events\nand experiences occurring during childhood and early adult-\nhood, middle age, and late life. Cognition in young adulthood\nreflects a combination of genetic endowment and health at birth\ninputs (Repetti, Taylor, & Seeman, 2002; Shaw, Krause,\nChatters, Connell, & Ingersoll-Dayton, 2004), and peer effects\n(Brody, Kim, Murry, & Brown, 2003). From early to late\nadulthood, people differ in the cognitive demands of work\n(House, 2002; Mendoza-Denton, Downey, Purdie, Davis, &\nPietrzak, 2002), both at home and at work. Material\ndeprivation, caused by low income and wealth, may negatively\naffect cognitive performance of elderly individuals (Cagney &\nLauderdale, 2002; Hack et al.). Particularly in late middle age\nand thereafter, adverse health events, such as various\nneurological and psychiatric diseases and diseases of other\norgan systems (Mehta, Yaffe, & Covinsky, 2002; Rosenblatt,\nMehta, Romanoski, Eaton, & Lyketsos, 2003), cause impaired\ncognition. Among socioeconomic variables, the best docu-\nmented association is between educational attainment and per-\nformance on cognitive tests. Health and wealth are at least\nweakly linked over the life course (Adams, Hurd, McFadden,\nMeskill, & Ribeiro, 2003). A person who is poor at age 20 and\nat age 40 is much more likely to be poor at age 70. By mea-\nsuring cross-sectional and longitudinal differences in cognitive\nperformance in late life, with and without such covariates as\nincome, one can at least narrow alternative explanations for\nobserved differences. With panel data methods, effects of time-\ninvariant determinants of cognitive status may be eliminated as\nconfounding factors.\nWe addressed four issues in this study. First, what are cross-\nsectional differences in cognitive performance of persons over\nthe age of 70 years by race or ethnicity? Second, to what extent\ndo the differences depend on how cognitive performance is\ndefined? Third, what are longitudinal differences by race or\nethnicity in patterns of cognitive decline by age? Fourth, how\ndoes controlling for other factors affect observed differences in\nlate life by race or ethnicity at a point in time and over time?\nAre differences reduced after one controls for contemporaneous\nhealth and wealth?\nIn this study we used data from four waves of the Study of\nAsset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD),\na national panel survey of U.S. households headed by indi-\nviduals over the age of 70 in 1993. Although many antecedents\nof health and function in late life are not documented, the data\nare unique in containing consistent measures of cognition,\nhealth, and income and wealth on a large, nationally repre-\nsentative sample of elderly persons over several years. We\nexamined effects of race or ethnicity on cognitive performance\nby using three alternative measures. Each measure has positive\nattributes, but each is subject to potential bias, albeit for\ndifferent reasons.\nThe study's contribution is that it measures cognitive\nperformance by using alternative approaches, which allows an\nJournal of Gerontology: PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES Copyright 2005 by The Gerontological Society of America\nassessment of robustness of findings, in a longitudinal panel\nspanning 7 years. To mitigate confounding from other\ninfluences including socioeconomic characteristics and health\nstatus, and to permit comparisons with unadjusted differences\nby race or ethnicity, we also included such explanatory\nvariables as self-reported physical and mental health, marital\nstatus, vision and hearing limitations, and income and wealth.\nMETHODS\nData\nAHEAD is a national panel survey of U.S. households.\nWhen the first wave was conducted in 1993, the survey\nsampled noninstitutionalized persons aged 70\u00fe years and their\nspouses or partners, who could be any age. Follow-up\ninterviews of the same sampled persons were conducted in\nRetirement Study (HRS), a panel survey of persons who were\nSample Construction\nWe excluded respondents who were younger than 70 at\nbaseline from our analysis, yielding a sample of 7,443 at Wave\n1. In follow-up interviews, observations were lost because of\ndeath or other reasons for sample attrition. Over 10% of\nrespondents typically died between two consecutive waves, and\nattrition for reasons other than death was between 6% and 7%.\nCombining observations from waves yielded a sample of\n23,120 observations. Some analyses excluded cases in which\nproxy respondents were used, which reduced the number of\nCognition Measures\nCognitive performance reflects a variety of abilities, in-\ncluding memory, conceptual and spatial skills, and use of\nlanguage (Suthers, Kim, & Crimmins, 2003). Measures avail-\nable in AHEAD permitted us to assess cognition in three ways,\nusing (a) a cognition test administered to persons who could\nrespond to cognition questions; (b) assessments by proxy\nrespondents of the respondent's cognitive performance for\npersons who could not respond to the cognition questions for\nreasons of poor physical health, low cognition, or other factors;\nand (c) daily activities that rely on cognition and other skills,\nbased on answers by sample persons who responded to the\nsurvey questions or answers provided by proxies.\nCognition test. --AHEAD included a battery of identical\nquestions in each wave to elicit the cognitive performance of\nrespondents. This summary measure was based on a modified\nversion of the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS)\nand tests of immediate and delayed verbal recall (Brandt,\nquestions included a memory test based on word recall,\na working memory measure based on a serial 7s subtraction\ntest, and a test of knowledge, language, and orientation, which\ninvolved naming objects, answering vocabulary questions, and\nanswering such questions as responding to today's date. In our\nbasic specification, we assigned missing values a value of 0.\nThe word recall test required respondents to remember as\nmany words as possible from a list of 10 words provided by the\ninterviewer. Respondents were then asked to recall the list of\nwords twice: immediately after and 5 min after the list of words\nwas administered (maximum, 20 points). The serial subtraction\ntest required the respondent to subtract 7 from 100 five times\n(maximum, 5 points). Respondents were also asked to count\nbackward starting from 20 to 10. If the respondent did not\nperform this task correctly the first time, the person was asked\nto repeat the exercise. We assigned values of 2, 1, or 0,\ndepending on whether the respondent counted backward\ncorrectly, either the first time, the second time, or not at all.\nThe knowledge, language, and orientation test asked\nrespondents the month, day, year, and day of week of the\ninterview (maximum, 4 points). The naming of objects exercise\nrequired the respondent to name the following: the thing used to\ncut paper; the prickly plant that grows in the desert; the current\nU.S. President; and the current U.S. Vice President (maximum,\n4 points). The maximum score was 35 points, with the word\nrecall, subtraction test, and knowledge, language, and orienta-\ntion components having maximum scores of 20, 5, and\nThe cognitive tasks represented a range of difficulty levels,\nwith naming tasks being the easiest and the recall and the serial\n7s tasks being the most difficult. The survey used a combination\nof in-person and telephone interviews. Herzog and Rodgers\n(1999) found no difference in measured performance depending\non whether the cognitive test was conducted over the telephone\nor in person.\nProxy assessments of sample persons' cognitive perfor-\nmance. --Proxy respondents were used when the sample person\nwas unable to respond because of illness, refusal to cooperate,\nor inability to understand the interviewer's language (14% of\ncases). Proxy respondents were asked to respond to questions\nabout a sample person's cognitive status on a 5-point scale\nranging from excellent to poor. We specified binary variables,\nclassifying responses from excellent through fair as good (\u00bc 1)\nand poor as bad (\u00bc 0). The dependent variables were (a)\nexercised good judgment; (b) had good memory; (c) had good\norganizational ability; and (d) did not wander off.\nrespondents, compared cognitive performance on the afore-\nmentioned test among persons they could interview who\nrequired a proxy with those who could respond on their own.\nNot surprisingly, there were large differences in performance.\nRespondents represented by a proxy but who took the test\nanyway had a mean score of 9.5 on the cognitive test just\ndescribed, compared with 20.1 for persons without a proxy.\nAbility to perform personal tasks. --The third set of depen-\ndent variables was based on measures of personal activities\nrequiring some, but not exclusively, cognitive skill (Foley,\nHeimovitz, Guralnik, & Brock, 2002; Stutts, Stewart, &\nMartell, 1998). The binary variables for self- or proxy-reported\nability to perform personal tasks, several of which were lim-\nitations in instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), were\n1 if the person had difficulty in (a) preparing hot meals, (b)\nshopping for groceries, (c) making telephone calls, (d) taking\nmedication, (e) driving, (f) managing money, and (g) using\na map (to figure out how to get around in a strange place). We\ncoded persons unable to do the task at all as having difficulty\nand assigned them a value of 1.\nExcept for ability to drive and manage money, questions\nabout specific tasks followed affirmative responses to this\nscreening question: ``Because of a health or memory problem,\ndo you have any difficulty in . . . (list of tasks)?'' In Wave 1, the\nquestion specified whether help was needed rather than whether\nthe respondent had difficulty in performing the task. Thus, the\nresponses were not exactly comparable over time. For this\nreason, and to account for secular trends not otherwise\naccounted for by the explanatory variables, in the longitudinal\nanalysis, we included binary variables for individual waves\nwith Wave 1, the omitted reference group.\nFor driving, the survey did not specify whether driving or not\ndriving was due to a health or memory problem in any wave. In\nWave 1, the question about managing money was worded as\ndifficulty in general. Beginning with Wave 2, the survey asked\nspecifically whether the difficulty was attributable to a health\nor memory problem. This change in the way the question\nwas posed accounts for a decrease between Waves 1 and 2 in\nthe fraction of sample persons who had difficulty in manag-\ning money.\nThe tasks with the highest proportions of persons having\ndifficulty were using a map and driving. As with the proxy\nassessments, we excluded observations with missing values for\nthe particular activity.\nExplanatory Variables\nExplanatory variables for race and ethnicity were White\n(omitted reference group), Black, Hispanic, and other race.\nBecause Hispanics could be of any race, we assigned all\npersons who self-reported as being Hispanic to the Hispanic\ncategory; others were classified as either White, Black, or\nother race. Although other race is likely to have been pre-\ndominately Asian, AHEAD did not release any data on national\norigin in its public use file. Other demographic variables were\nage, gender (male \u00bc 1), marital status (currently married \u00bc 1),\nand educational attainment (in years), and self-reported\nmeasures of an emotional, nervous, or psychiatric problem,\ndepressive symptoms, vision and hearing impairments, and\noverall health.\nThe variable for depressive symptoms was based on an\nabridged (8-item) version of the 20-item Center for Epidemi-\nological Studies\u00adDepression (CES-D) scale to measure de-\npression level (Radloff, 1977). The survey asked the respondent\nto rate his or her vision and hearing on a 5-point scale ranging\nfrom excellent to poor and, for vision, allowed for a sixth type\nof response that the person was legally blind. We defined\na variable for ``visually impaired'' if the person responded that\nhis or her vision was poor or if he or she was legally blind. For\nhearing, we defined the person as ``hearing impaired'' if he or\nshe reported poor ability to hear. We included measures of\nhousehold income, wealth, and a binary variable for negative\nnet worth, set to 1 if the household's liabilities exceeded its\nassets. When net worth was negative, we set the continuous\nvariable for wealth to 0.\nIn the analysis of personal tasks, we included a binary\nvariable indicating whether the information on difficulty with\nperforming the task was provided by a proxy or the respondent.\nThe cognitive test was only administered to sample persons\nwho did not use a proxy. Proxy assessments of cognition were\nonly asked when a proxy respondent was used.\nEstimation\nWe performed both a cross-sectional analysis, based on\nWave 1 data, and a longitudinal analysis based on data from all\nfour waves. In the longitudinal analysis, we used person-\nspecific (individual) fixed effects and a time trend to measure\nthe effects of aging. By accounting for omitted heterogeneity,\nindividual fixed effects accounted for unobserved factors\nrelated to attrition and other time-invariant factors. Parameter\nestimates on the time trend variables in the longitudinal analysis\nshow the relationship between age and the dependent variables\nfor the omitted reference group, Whites. By interacting the time\ntrend (minimum, 0; maximum, 7) with binary variables for\nBlack, Hispanic, and other races, we could assess differences\nin the age trajectories between Whites and the other race or\nethnicity groups. AHEAD's Wave 1 did not obtain information\nabout ability to use a map; our cross-sectional analysis of using\nmaps was based on Wave 2 and our longitudinal analysis was\nOur main purpose in the longitudinal analysis was to assess\ntrajectories in indicators of cognitive performance as persons\ngrew older. The individual fixed effects controlled for age at\nentry to the sample. In the longitudinal analysis, we only\nincluded covariates that were time varying. We excluded race\nor ethnicity (not interacted with the wave binary variables),\ngender, and educational attainment from this analysis.\nWhen the dependent variable was the TICS score or one of\nits components, we used ordinary least squares. When the\ndependent variable was a binary in cross-sectional analysis--\nproxy versus self-report, cognitive assessments by respondents\nrequiring a proxy, and ability to perform personal tasks at\nWave 1--we used logit regression (STATA, version 7.0).\nWhen the dependent variable was a binary variable in the\nlongitudinal analysis, we used a linear probability model.\nAlthough STATA contained software for logit analysis with\nfixed effects, this program was impractical for our study, given\nthe large number of individual fixed effects in our analysis. We\nalso used a linear probability model in the cross-sectional\nanalysis to permit a comparison of the findings with results\nfrom the logit analysis.\nRESULTS\nTrends in Cognitive Test Scores\nand in Limitations in IADLs\nMedian and mean total cognitive test scores for Whites at\nWave 1 were 21 and 20.1, respectively, out of a maximum total\nscore of 35. Mean scores for Blacks, Hispanics, and other race\nwere significantly lower than for Whites (all p , .001), with\naddition, Whites were much less likely than the other groups to\nhave scored 10 or less.\nMean scores on the TICS for Whites and Blacks declined\nfrom 1 to 2 points from Wave 1 through Wave 4, a 7-year\nperiod. Scores for Hispanics decreased less than this, whereas\nscores for persons in the other-race category increased.\nThe mean number of difficulties in performing personal tasks\nincreased between Waves 1 and 4 for persons in all race or\nethnicity groups. Except for Hispanics, the increase was\nmonotonic. At baseline, Whites had fewer difficulties on average\nthan did persons in the other race or ethnicity groups; by Wave 4,\nthe mean number of difficulties had increased by about 0.45 (out\nof seven tasks). Differences in the mean number of difficulties\nbetween Whites and Blacks increased between Waves 1 and 4.\nDifferences in Mean Values of Explanatory\nVariables by Race or Ethnicity\nMean age did not differ among the four race or ethnicity\nsubsamples. However, there were particularly large differences\nin mean years of schooling, household income, and wealth.\nWhites, on average, had 11.5 years of schooling; this was in\ncontrast to 8.4 for Blacks, 5.9 for Hispanics, and 9.9 years for\nother race. Mean income ranged from $27,700 for Whites to\nof Whites had negative net worth. Percentages for the other\ngroups were considerably higher; up to 6% of Hispanics had\na negative net worth.\nCognitive Tests Scores: Cross-Sectional\nRegression Analysis\nHolding other factors constant, we found that, compared with\nWhites, at baseline (Wave 1), Blacks' total scores on the TICS\n3.5-point difference was considerably lower than the un-\nadjusted White\u00adBlack difference of 5.8 points. The adjusted\ndifferences at Wave 1 between Whites and other race were\nnearly as large as were the adjusted differences between Whites\nand Blacks, at 3.1 points ( p , .001); the adjusted differences\nbetween Whites and Hispanics were smaller, 0.9 ( p \u00bc .003),\nthan those between Whites and the two other groups and much\nsmaller than the unadjusted difference of 4.7. Controlling for\nthe other factors had a much larger effect on the difference\nbetween the scores for Whites and Hispanics than between\nWhites and the other two groups.\nHaving a higher age ( p , .001), being of the male gender\n( p , .001), attaining lower educational levels ( p , .001),\nhaving a sensory problem, both for vision ( p \u00bc .007) and\nhearing ( p , .001), having a higher number of depressive\nwere associated with a lower total score. There were no\nstatistically significant relationships between the total score and\nmarital status, having ever had a psychological problem, and\nwealth or income. Only one coefficient on wealth or income\nwas statistically significant at conventional levels--for negative\nnet worth in the analysis of the subtraction test.\nAlmost half of the difference in total scores between Whites\nand Blacks and between Whites and other race reflected\ndifferences in word recall, for which there was a 1.3 difference\n( p , .001), adjusted for effects of other covariates, out of\na maximum score of 20. There was no statistically significant\ndifference between Whites and Hispanics in word recall. About\nhalf of the difference in the total scores between Hispanics and\nwhites reflected lower scores for Hispanics on knowledge,\nlanguage, and orientation. Spanish speakers could take the\nSpanish-language version of AHEAD, but this does not exclude\nthe possibility of cultural biases in the test, especially on the\nknowledge, language, and orientation component.\nFor other race, the largest difference with Whites was in\nword recall ( p , .001). The White\u00adother race differential in\nword recall was the same as that between Whites and Blacks.\nPersons of other race performed slightly better than Blacks on\nthe subtraction and the knowledge, language, and orientation\ntests. Persons who self-reported as being of other race were\nadministered the English version of AHEAD.\nTable 1.

Table data used ordinary least squares.\nCognitive Test Scores: Longitudinal\nRegression Analysis\nTotal cognitive test scores declined over time for Whites, the\nomitted reference group ( p , .001; see Table 2). With time-\nvarying covariates included, the decline in total scores between\nthe same as the unadjusted rate of decline. Total scores declined\nfor Blacks, but at an annual rate of 0.06 less than that for\nWhites ( p \u00bc .041). This lower rate of decline reflected a lower\nrate of decline in word recall ( p , .001), although scores\ndeclined for both groups. For Hispanics, total scores improved\nrelative to Whites at a rate of 0.10 per year ( p\u00bc.028). For other\nrace, not only did scores improve relative to Whites ( p , .001),\nbut there was an improvement in total score with age, and in\neach of the three components of the total score.\nProxy Assessments: Probability That\na Proxy was Used\nBlacks, Hispanics, and persons of other race were all more\nlikely than Whites to have had a proxy respondent (all p , .01\nor better; see Table 3). Black ( p \u00bc .003) and Hispanic ( p \u00bc\n.006) respondents both had a 0.02 higher probability of using\na proxy. Persons of other race were more likely to have used\na proxy than were Blacks and Hispanics, at 0.11 higher than\nWhites ( p , .001). Older persons, men, married individuals,\nand persons with fewer years of schooling were more likely to\nhave required a proxy respondent (all ps , .001). Persons who\nreported that they had ever had a nervous, emotional, or\npsychological condition, those with vision and hearing impair-\nments, and those in fair or poor health were more likely to have\nrelied on proxies ( p , .001), as were persons within low-\nincome households ( p\u00bc.002) or with negative worth ( p\u00bc.003).\nProxy Assessments of Sample Persons' Cognitive\nPerformance: Cross-Sectional Regression Analysis\nOur next set of measures of cognitive functioning was based\non assessments by proxy respondents--either informal care-\ngivers (relatives, friends) or paid caregivers of the sample\nperson (Table 4). The largest difference between Blacks and\nWhites was in organizational ability. Blacks were 0.19 less\nlikely than Whites to have had good organizational ability ( p ,\n.001). The next largest difference was for good judgment.\nAccording to the proxy reports, Blacks were 0.11 less likely to\nhave had good judgment ( p \u00bc .02). There were no statistically\nsignificant differences between Blacks and Whites in the\nprobability of having good memory or for having never\nwandered off. For Hispanics and other race, there were no\nstatistically significant differences between these groups and\nWhites on any of the four measures.\nDifficulty in Performing Daily Tasks: Cross-Sectional\nRegression Analysis\nAt baseline, Blacks were less likely than Whites to be able to\nperform five of seven tasks: preparing hot meals, 0.02 less\nlikely ( p \u00bc .02); making telephone calls, 0.02 less likely ( p ,\n( p , .001; see Table 5, marginal effects from the logit\nanalysis). Hispanics were less able to perform five of these tasks\nthan were Whites: preparing hot meals, 0.02 less likely ( p \u00bc\nFor other race, the only statistically significant differences\ncompared with Whites were in preparing hot meals, 0.05\nTable 2.

In one instance, we found\na statistically significant difference at conventional levels for\na race\u00adethnicity variable with logit but not with linear\nprobability. In the latter analysis, the p value for preparing\nhot meals for Hispanics fell from .03 with logit to .08 with\nlinear probability. The parameter estimates from the linear\nprobability analysis imply marginal effects that are only slightly\ndifferent from their logit counterparts.\nMany other factors were associated with ability to perform\nthe tasks. For example, higher wealth was associated with\na higher probability of being able to drive ( p , .001). Those\nwith negative net worth were less likely to be able to prepare\nhot meals, shop for groceries, drive, or manage money. More\neducated persons were more likely to be able to make\na telephone call ( p , .001); drive ( p , .001); manage money\nDifficulty in Performing Daily Tasks: Longitudinal\nRegression Analysis\nJudging from the coefficients on the trend variables, we found\nthat ability to perform each of the seven daily tasks declined\nwith age for Whites (Table 6); the decreases in the probability of\nhaving difficulty in performing tasks ranged from .003 per year\nfor managing money to .021 for driving. For Blacks, ability to\nprepare hot meals ( p , .001), shop for groceries ( p \u00bc.03), and\nmanage money ( p , .001) declined with age relative to Whites.\nRelative declines were greatest for preparing hot meals and\nmanaging money. Blacks' ability to drive improved relative to\nWhites ( p , .001) but declined in absolute terms. By contrast,\nfor Hispanics, the ability to shop for groceries ( p \u00bc .02)\nimproved relative to Whites with age. Driving improved relative\nto Whites ( p \u00bc .049), but, as for Blacks, declined in absolute\nterms. For other race, differences in rates of decline were\nstatistically significant from Whites at conventional levels. This\nanalysis controlled for time-varying covariates, marital status,\nhealth, income, wealth, and use of a proxy respondent.\nCoefficients on the proxy variable, all statistically significant\n( p , .001), are substantial in magnitude.\nDISCUSSION\nHolding other factors likely to affect cognitive functioning\nconstant, and using three alternative types of dependent\nvariables, each measure subject to different kinds of potential\nmeasurement error or even bias, we found appreciable cross-\nsectional differences at baseline in cognitive test scores on the\nbasis of race or ethnicity, with the largest differences being\nbetween Blacks and Whites. Including covariates reduced the\ndifferentials between Blacks and Whites and Hispanics and\nWhites. Longitudinal analysis spanning 7 years revealed a\ndecline in test scores for two of the three measures for Whites,\nthe omitted reference group. Performance on the cognitive test\ndeclined with age for Blacks and Hispanics as for Whites, but at\na somewhat lower rate. Scores for the other race category\nactually improved with age. However, for several personal\ntasks, performance of Blacks declined even more than that of\nWhites. Persons of other race had higher scores on the cognitive\ntest in the later waves, but their ability to perform the tasks\ndeclined at about the same rate as that for Whites. Hispanics'\nperformance on the cognitive test declined less than did that of\nTable 4.

Table data used logit analyses.\nWhites, but, with one exception, Hispanics did not improve\nrelative to Whites in performing personal tasks.\nThe compression in performance between Whites and other\nrace and Whites and Hispanics plausibly reflected some recent\nimmigrants' increased familiarity with life in the United States.\nAnother possibility is that they had less familiarity with\nresponding to household surveys initially, and they learned\nhow to respond to cognition questions over time. Such learning is\nevident in a temporary improvement in scores at Wave 2, which\neventually was offset by the effects of aging on test performance.\nBoth the baseline differences in all three measures and the lack\nof convergence between elderly Blacks and Whites are\ntroublesome. For one, they may reflect a continuing legacy of\nsegregation and discrimination. For another, they many reflect\na differential need for support (such as for formal care) that is not\nbeing currently met by the public sector. Differences persisted in\nour analysis even after we accounted for variation in educational\nattainment, marital status, health, income, and wealth, and, for\nthe personal tasks, a binary variable for proxy status, all of which\ndiffered systematically between Blacks and Whites.\nIn the longitudinal analysis, we accounted for time-varying\nchanges in health and wealth and income and in marital status.\nTrajectories of these variables by race or ethnicity differ over\nthe life course.

Although a person's health is likely\nto fluctuate over time, on average, poor health earlier in the life\ncourse is likely to be associated with poorer health in late life.\nThe longitudinal analysis with fixed effects eliminated\ninfluences of time-invariant factors, both those measured, such\nas educational attainment and gender, and those not measured\nby AHEAD, such as genetic endowment, cumulative effects of\nstress, and relative lack of intellectual or stimulating job\nopportunities, with one important caveat. If there are interac-\ntions between race or ethnicity and these omitted factors, then\na panel data analysis with fixed effects does not eliminate the\ninfluence of these factors.\nWe assumed that respondents who did not answer a particular\nquestion on the cognition test did not really know the answer.\nMaking the opposite assumption, that the person knew the\nanswer, produced few differences in findings.\nAny one measure of cognition may be subject to specific\nbiases. In our study, we allowed for differences in measurement\ntools and in evaluators of the sample persons' cognitive status.\nWith one of the three measures, the evaluators were often\nrelatives or friends of the sample person. Another measure relied\ncompletely on self-responses, but there may be differences in\ntest validity related to race or ethnicity. The third mainly relied\non self-responses, with a minority of responses coming from\nproxies (14%); this measure related to specific activities in\nwhich persons of all races and ethnicities commonly engage,\nrather than on responses to a test. Relative to the other two\nmeasures, measures of difficulty in performing daily activities\nare less direct measures of cognitive performance. To account\nfor other influences on the dependent variables, we included\ncovariates, such as for physical health, education, and, in\nspecifications not shown, family income. If there are biases, it\nseems very unlikely that the biases are all in the same direction.\nEven though our analysis was more comprehensive in using\na panel and in the range of dependent variables included, our\nfindings are consistent with previous research showing differ-\nences by race or ethnicity in cognitive performance, even with\ncontrols for such variables as educational attainment (Branch\ngitudinal analysis with limitations in ADLs as the measure of\ndisability found a gap between Black and White elderly people,\nbut, controlling for various socioeconomic and health variables,\nthe researchers found that the trajectories of disability by race\nwere not statistically different (Kelley-Moore & Ferraro, 2004).\nThe researchers concluded that the evidence supported ``per-\nsistent inequality.'' In our analysis, with different measures of\nactivity limitations, there was some widening of the differential\non several measures. The differences in mean cognitive scores\nreflected higher relative frequencies of very low scores and\nscores in the lower middle range for Blacks, other non-Whites,\nand Hispanics than for Whites. Differences in relative fre-\nquency at the upper range of scores did not differ according to\nrace or ethnicity.\nOn appropriateness of the cognitive measures, other well-\ncontrolled studies using other measures of cognitive function,\nsuch as the Blessed Dementia Scale (Proctor et al., 1997) and\nthe Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, including\napolipoprotein E genotype (Fillenbaum, Heyman, Prosnitz, &\nnificant differences in cognitive performance by race.\nCross-sectional differences in cognitive performance be-\ntween Blacks and Whites have been attributed to poorer\nphysical health for Blacks, as measured by higher prevalence of\ndiseases known to affect cognition, such as hypertension,\ndiabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, myocardial infarction, and\nlower levels of physical activity and fitness (Dustman,\nEmmerson, & Shearer, 1994; Izquierdo-Porrera & Waldstein,\n2002). However, when we included self-reports of mental and\nphysical health, we still found Black\u00adWhite differences.\nIncluding physical health measures reduced the measured\ndisparities but did not eliminate them; this result is consistent\nwith evidence from studies on more limited populations, such\nas patients discharged from a hospital (Proctor et al., 1997).\nSeveral study limitations should be acknowledged. First,\nalthough we have documented patterns of racial and ethnic\ndisparities, we could not sort out reasons for the cross-sectional\nand longitudinal patterns we documented. The term racial\ndisparities is widely used, but what role race plays in empirical\nanalysis critically depends on what else is held constant. Our\nanalysis controlled for many other factors associated with race\nor ethnicity.\nSecond, this study was based on a single cohort. Particular\ncohorts have unique characteristics that reflect their life cycle\nexperiences in part. For example, many Blacks in our study\ngrew up under Jim Crow. All persons experienced the Great\nDepression or its aftermath and World War II as children. Many\nHispanics and persons of other races were recent immigrants to\nthe United States. Some empirical evidence suggests that\ndisparities in cognitive performance among elderly people\nbetween Blacks and non-Blacks may be declining over time\n(Freedman et al., 2002), a pattern not reflected in our analysis of\na single cohort but perhaps present over several cohorts.\nThird, we have assumed that effects of various covariates on\ncognitive status are unidirectional. In fact, cognitive perfor-\nmance may have important effects on income, wealth, and\nhealth (Adams et al., 2003). Although our fixed effects analysis\nsomewhat mitigates the effects of reverse causality, it does not\neliminate this source of bias entirely. For any individual,\na decrease in cognitive performance could lead to a reduction in\nincome for the person's household or possibly the reverse if\nincome transfers are included. Understanding the dynamics\namong health, wealth, income, and cognition is an important\ntask for future research.\n"
