    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SPM) is an uncommon disorder. It is rarely\nreported in paediatric patients and may be accompanied by subcutaneous emphysema. It is\nusually benign and self-limiting, with only supportive therapy being needed, but severe cases\nmay require invasive measures. Asthma exacerbations have classically been described as a\ncause of SPM. However, detailed descriptions in asthmatic children are scarce. We aimed at\nimproving the current understanding of the features of SPM and subcutaneous emphysema,\nand outcomes, by means of a case report and a systematic review.\nMethods: For the systematic review a literature search was performed in PubMed to identify\nreported cases of SPM in asthmatic children.\nResults: The case a 10-year-old asthmatic girl with SPM is reported. The patient received an\ninhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta2 agonist, in addition to sublingual immunotherapy\n(SLIT) with eventual control of asthma symptoms. Review: A total of 114 published cases\nwere found since 1995, most of them in teenagers; no sex differences were observed. Clinical\npresentation was associated with an asthma exacerbation in a number of cases. Other\npresenting features were chest pain, dyspnoea, cough, and particularly acute swelling of\nthe face, neck, and upper chest. Subcutaneous emphysema was present in most patients.\nOverall, three cases of pneumothorax and two cases of pneumorrhachis were reported.\nTherapy was mainly based on supportive care, rest, oxygen therapy, analgesics, steroids, and\nbronchodilators. All patients recovered spontaneously, in spite of a small initial increase in\nSPM in a few cases.\nConclusions: Early identification of patients at risk of SPM would avoid the high number of\nunder-diagnosed cases. Patients should be treated not only with supportive therapy but also\nwith measures to achieve control of the underlying cause (such as poorly controlled asthma).\n",

In spite of being rare, SPM is prob-\nably under-diagnosed in children. Two incidence\npeaks have been reported; one of them in children\nunder 7 years of age, probably due to lower air-\nways infections, and the other in adolescents, due\nto asthmatic exacerbations and high airways\nSeveral studies have found a number of triggering\nfactors for SPM [Cicak et al. 2009; Lee et al.\ncolleagues, the most common ones are: lower air-\ngeal rupture (5.4%), foreign body aspiration\n(2.7%), and diabetic ketoacidosis (2.7%), with a\ncause not being found in about 35.1% of patients\n(idiopathic SPM) [Lee et al. 2010]. In recent lit-\nerature, some cases have been reported due to\nrepeated scuba diving [Donoso Fuentes et al.\n2009], spontaneous bronchial rupture [Maithani\net al. 2012], high-frequency oscillatory ventilation\ndrug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symp-\ntoms (DRESS) syndrome [Giri et al. 2011],\nhyperventilation due to anxiety states [Crespo\nMarcos et al. 2006], and inhaled drugs such as\ncocaine, cannabis, or ecstasy [Crespo Marcos\nAs a clinical syndrome, pneumomediastinum was\nfirst reported in 1819 by Laennec, and its patho-\nphysiology was described in 1939 by Macklin\n[Macklin, 1939]. A sudden increase in intra-alve-\nolar pressure can cause alveolar rupture and a\nleak of air resulting in interstitial emphysema. Air\nmay then reach the hilium and cause pneumome-\ndiastinum/pneumothorax, or may reach the lung\nperiphery resulting in subpleural bullae (ruptured\nbullae may also cause pneumothorax). If leaked\nair spreads into subcutaneous tissues in chest wall\nand neck, through fascial planes, subcutaneous\nemphysema occurs. Extension into the rachis\nresulting in pneumorrhachis is rare but has also\nbeen reported in SPM [Eesa et al. 2006; Girard\nClinical presentation includes the following triad:\nacute substernal chest pain (90%), subcutaneous\nemphysema (90%), and variably severe dyspnoea\nreported symptoms are neck pain (20%) and low-\nto-moderate pain on swallowing (20%), whereas\ntorticollis, dorsally-radiating pain, dysphonia, loss\nof lung dullness, and paradoxical pulse are very\nrare. Cyanosis, haemodynamic compromise, and\neven an associated pneumopericardium have\nbeen reported in most severe cases\nSubcutaneous emphysema refers to air being pre-\nsent within subcutaneous tissue. Massive build-\nup of air can even be life-threatening due to chest\ncompression, resulting in progressive hypoxemia\nand hypercapnia. Substernal crackles synchro-\nnous with heart systole (Hamman's sign) are\nDifferential diagnoses include pneumomediasti-\nnum (though association is common), oesopha-\ngeal perforation (Boerhaave syndrome if\nspontaneously developed), pneumothorax, hol-\nlow viscus rupture, chest trauma, foreign body\naspiration, and acute coronary syndrome and pul-\nmonary thromboembolism, both very rare find-\nings in paediatric patients [Cicak et al. 2009;\nclinical practice, diagnosis should be confirmed\nby chest X-ray, including a lateral view to show\nextraluminal air [Donoso Fuentes et al. 2009].\nWhen the diagnosis is uncertain, chest computer-\nized tomography (CT) allows small amounts of\nair in the mediastinum and tracheal injuries to be\nCremaschini et al. 2012]. If an oesophageal rup-\nture is suspected, an oesophagogram should be\nobtained [Crespo Marcos et al. 2006; Cicak et al.\nSPM is usually benign and self-limiting, with only\nsupporting therapy being needed; rest for 1\u00ad4\ndays, analgesia, oxygen, and clinical monitoring\n[Crespo Marcos et al. 2006; Donoso Fuentes\ndisorders should be treated, if possible [Cicak\net al. 2009].

In children, SPM can appear with the first\nasthma exacerbation or can appear later as a com-\nplication of asthma [Versteegh and Broeders,\nTherapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease 10(5)\nreported frequency of SPM in asthmatic patients\nmatic children seen at a paediatric emergency\ndepartment, SPM was observed in only 0.3% of\npatients [Stack and Caputo, 1996]. In a series of\nasthma, SPM incidence was 5% [Eggleston et al.\n1974]. Follow up of patients with SPM has shown\nsubclinical or clinical asthma in some cases [Dekel\net al. 1996], and asthma has been reported in\n50% of SPM patients in a Taiwan series [Chiu\nRecently, a large systematic review of 600 patients\nwith SPM, mostly young adults, was published\n[Dajer-Fadel et al. 2014]. Previous asthma was\nfound in 13.7%; however, no specific data on\nasthmatic or paediatric patients were provided.\nFurthermore, very recently, a large series of SPM\nin paediatric patients has also been reported\n[Fitzwater et al. 2015]. In this retrospective\nreview, 96 children with 99 episodes were identi-\nfied and their characteristics and management\nwere described; 38.4% were asthmatic. This will\nbe a landmark study in the field and includes\nsome specific data on management and outcomes\nin asthmatic children as a group, although no spe-\ncific description of such patients is reported.\nTaking into account that detailed descriptions of\nSPM in asthmatic children are scarce, we aimed\nat improving current understanding of their fea-\ntures and outcomes regarding both SPM and\nunderlying asthma, by means of a systematic\nreview and a report of a typical case.\nCase report\nA 10-year-old asthmatic girl attended the emer-\ngency department with a persistent dry cough,\ndyspnoea and severe chest/neck pain, after having\nbeen exposed to environmental smoke and ash\nafter a recent fire.

After 72 hours, a chest\nX-ray showed a substantially reduced amount of\ngas in the neck and mediastinum. The patient\nwas discharged at day 4; prescribed therapy at\ndischarge included budesonide 200 \u00b5g twice daily\nwith AeroChamber, and she was advised not to\nperform extreme physical activity to avoid pneu-\nmothorax development due to potential bullae.\nFigure 1.

All patients recovered spontane-\nously, in spite of a small initial increase in SPM in\na few cases. However, in the largest reported\nseries, three cases of recurrent SPM were found\nduring a prolonged follow up. All patients were\ndischarged after 2\u00ad12 days, and a series compar-\ning asthmatic versus nonasthmatic SPM patients\nshowed no difference in length of stay.\nDiscussion\nSPM is an uncommon disease that usually has a\nbenign course. It should be treated conservatively\nunless a complication requires using invasive pro-\ncedures. Although few cases of SPM have been\nfully described in asthmatic children, our review\nconfirms that asthma, and asthma exacerbation,\nappears to be one of the most prominent risk fac-\ntors for SPM (Table 1). SPM has been reported\nboth as a consequence of an asthma exacerbation\nand as a sign of a first asthma attack in children.\nSPM may be associated with poorly-controlled\nasthma. A majority of cases appear to occur in\nteenagers and no obvious differences in incidence\nhave been reported between the sexes. Chest\nX-ray is increasingly being replaced by CT to con-\nfirm diagnosis, whereas pneumomediastinum has\nrecently been reported as a sonographic mimic of\npneumothorax [Saracino and Tessaro, 2015].\nClinical course in reported cases has been gener-\nally favourable with spontaneous recovery being\nachieved after hospital admission and supportive\ncare. Very recently, unusual cases of SPM have\nalso been reported in nonasthmatic children with\nexercise-induced bronchoconstriction [Anantasit\net al. 2015], a syndrome causing transient narrow-\ning of lower airway either in the presence or the\nabsence of clinical asthma [Weiler et al. 2010].\nThe usual course of SPM is spontaneous resolu-\ntion after a few days, if supporting therapy is pro-\nvided to the patient and good asthma control is\nachieved. Recurrent SPM may occur in asthmatic\nchildren, thus, from our point of view, careful\ncontrol of asthma appears to be particularly\nimportant in such patients. Alpha1-antitrypsin\ndeficiency screening has been recently recom-\nmended in patients with asthma and was per-\nformed in our patient for differential diagnosis\npatient, SPM and subcutaneous emphysema\nwere associated with severe asthma. Control of\nasthma symptoms proved particularly difficult to\nachieve. To our knowledge, this is the first patient\nreported with asthma-associated SPM that has\nbeen treated with SLIT. Our case suggested SLIT\ncould change asthma course in children and may\navoid potential complications such as SPM.\nIn conclusion, it is important to stress the impor-\ntance of an early identification of patients at risk\nof SPM, which would avoid the high number of\nunder-diagnosed cases. Moreover, patients\nshould be treated not only with supportive ther-\napy but also with measures to achieve control of\nthe underlying cause of SPM (such as poorly-\ncontrolled asthma).\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of\nthis article.\nConflict of interest statement\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of\ninterest with respect to the research, authorship,\nand/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAmeh, V., Jenner, R., Jilani, N. and Bradbury,\nA.
