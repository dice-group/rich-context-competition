This study tests whether childlessness is significantly related to greater loneliness or depression among\nolder adults, both alone and in conjunction with marital status.\nMethods. Using data from the 1988 National Survey of Families and Households, the relative circumstances of\ncommunity-dwelling, permanently childless adults and biological parents (with at least one surviving child), 50-84\nyears old, are compared. Multivariate models are used to test the effects of parental status and combined marital-\nparental statuses on loneliness and depression, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics.\nResults. Results of multivariate analyses show no significant, direct effect of childlessness, though a marginally\nsignificant effect appears for women. However, small but significant differences are observed within a typology com-\nbining marital and parental statuses. Widowed men and women report higher levels of loneliness and depression than\nmarried parents regardless of parental status. Divorced parents are also significantly more vulnerable. The subjective\nwell-being of never married, childless men and women is indistinguishable from that of their married peers.\nDiscussion. The results confirm earlier studies, indicating that childlessness is not necessarily linked with dimin-\nished subjective well-being among older adults. However, marital status represents an important context within which\nto understand and evaluate the experience of parental status.\nGERONTOLOGICAL research has consistently docu-\nmented the importance of family, especially adult\nchildren, in providing social and instrumental support for\nolder persons. Although the help and companionship pro-\nvided by other relatives and non-kin have been recognized,\nhow well they can substitute for close kin is less clear\nWithin this context, childless elders have been identified as\na potentially vulnerable subgroup. Childlessness is associ-\nated with significantly higher risks of social isolation and\nJohnson & Catalano, 1981), but there is little consistent ev-\nidence that childlessness diminishes subjective well-being.\nMuch of the research on subjective well-being among\nchildless elders, however, dates back to the early 1980s and\ndoes not reflect the changes in cohort composition and life\nexperiences among adults currently entering old age (see\nThe present analyses build on prior research by providing\na more current, nationally representative portrait of the rela-\ntive status of permanently childless persons and those who\nhave surviving, biogical children. Using data from the Na-\ntional Survey of Families and Households (NSFH), this arti-\ncle tests whether childlessness has a negative impact on sub-\njective well-being, specifically on loneliness and depression,\nand tests for effects of parental status that may be conditional\non other characteristics that increase vulnerability in old age.\nChildlessness and Subjective Well-Being in Old Age\nDramatic social changes in this century have increased\nthe diversity of family forms and personal histories among\nolder adults. Compared to earlier cohorts, a higher propor-\ntion of people enter old age with few or no children and\nwith fewer siblings within their families (Bengtson, Rosen-\nproportion childless was highest among the oldest cohorts,\nwho were young adults during the Great Depression (nearly\n22%), and lowest during the baby boom (8.8% for women\nplications of childlessness for these cohorts have been\nshaped by changing social norms that have defined the\nsalience of parental status over the life course. Strong\npronatalist norms, emphasizing the centrality of family and\nprocreation, have been pervasive in the United States\nthough acceptance of childlessness has increased, most\nAmericans associate childlessness with greater loneliness\nWhy are childless elderly persons assumed to be at a dis-\nadvantage? Scholars have traditionally used the availability\nof kin as an objective measure of social resources. Elders\nwith more family ties have been defined as more socially\nintegrated and therefore protected against loneliness and\ndepression, whereas those with few or no kin ties have\nbeen identified as vulnerable (see Antonucci, 1990; Bengt-\nson et al., 1990). Recent work has criticized this structural\napproach for ignoring non-kin networks and for focusing\non the quantity of ties but ignoring relationship quality\nChen, House, Hopkins, & Slaten, 1996). However, because\nfamily structure can be readily measured and projected for\ncurrent and future cohorts, kin availability remains the most\nuseful predictor of trends in social resources on the popula-\ncritical to test regularly whether childless elders indeed dif-\nfer from parents on a variety of measures, both objective\nand subjective.\nFor Americans in general, the equation of childlessness\nwith a lonely old age reflects deeply held beliefs regarding\nthe value of children and the importance of family. Despite\ngreater acceptance of childlessness since the 1960s, there\nhas been no evidence of a rush away from parenthood\nhas stated, \"there are still... cogent reasons for parenthood\nthat are uniquely inherent in the role of children as social\nof having a child include the attainment and experience of\nparent status, affirmation and emotional support in old age,\nand a sense of \"immortality\" through the transmission of\ngenes and values (Blake, 1979). The intensity and norma-\ntive expectations of the parent-child relationship are re-\nflected in the high involvement of adult children, especially\ndaughters, in caring for aging parents (Brody, 1990; Rossi\n& Rossi, 1990) and in the particularly intensive and on-\ngoing assistance that they are often uniquely equipped to\nChildless elders tend to be significantly worse off on ob-\njective measures of social isolation, such as living alone,\nhaving few face-to-face contacts (Bachrach, 1980; Kivett &\nLearner, 1980), and not having an available caregiver\n(Soldo, Wolf, & Agree, 1990). On the other hand, surveys\nconsistently report no differences between the childless and\nparents on subjective measures of well-being such as happi-\nness, life satisfaction, and loneliness (Glenn & McLanahan,\nthe lack of a consistent negative effect suggests that unmar-\nried and childless elders obtain needed emotional and instru-\nmental support from their relationships with other kin,\nscholars have further questioned the assumption that adult\nchildren are necessarily positive resources, demonstrating\nthat stressful or distant relations can be detrimental to well-\net al., 1996). The absence of adult children, therefore, would\nnot necessarily predict greater vulnerability in old age.\nBesides social resource availability, however, regrets\nabout childlessness may also influence well-being in old\nage. Alexander and colleagues (1992) have noted that older\nwomen reevaluate their childless status at various stages of\ntheir lives and have suggested that negative feelings about\nchildlessness may surface or increase with old age. Social\nnorms that have marginalized childless women in particular\nmay trigger feelings of regret or diminished well-being (see\nalso Veevers, 1980). In addition, research on infertility has\ndocumented the distress of couples coping with involuntary\nchildlessness (Miall, 1986), and a few studies have indi-\ncated that a negative effect on subjective well-being may per-\nsist (or reemerge) in later life (Beckman & Houser, 1982;\nLoneliness, Depression, and Parental Status\nThe present research focuses on two measures of subjec-\ntive well-being: loneliness, an indicator of perceived social\nisolation, and depression, a measure of psychological dis-\ntress. Loneliness is chosen because fears of loneliness in\nold age and especially among the childless appear to be\nwidespread and persistent among the general public (Blake,\n& Beckman, 1984). Depressive symptoms represent a more\nserious form of psychological distress that diminishes well-\nbeing and may disrupt normal function. Loneliness has\nbeen defined as an unpleasant feeling of dissatisfaction with\neither the number or quality of existing social relationships\nSeveral studies based on data from the late 1970s have re-\nported no significant association between loneliness and\nchildlessness in later life (Keith, 1983a; Kivett & Learner,\nchildlessness has received less attention in the geronto-\nlogical literature and has shown mixed results. Beckman\nand Houser's (1982) study of older widowed and married\nwomen found no differences between childless women and\nmothers. Connidis and McMullin (1993) reported that\nwomen who described themselves as childless by circum-\nstance had significantly higher levels of depression than the\nchildless by choice and mothers. No studies have tested dif-\nferences in either loneliness or depression by parental status\nusing representative U.S. data collected since 1980, and\nfindings from earlier studies are limited in their generaliz-\nability and their methods.\nThis article examines loneliness and depression as sepa-\nrate indicators of subjective well-being that represent con-\nceptually different domains. Depression is a measure of\npsychological distress with clinical implications, whereas\nloneliness is an unpleasant feeling that diminishes well-\nbeing but is not generally defined as a psychological disor-\nder. As Peplau and Perlman note, \"depression is a much\nbroader phenomenon than loneliness; people can be de-\npressed for a variety of reasons; hence depressed people are\nedge that these indicators are closely related and are\ndifficult to fully separate in practice or in measurement.\nLoneliness may be a precursor to more serious depressive\nsymptoms. In turn, depressed affect interferes with social\ninteraction, further exacerbating both the objective and sub-\njective dimensions of social isolation (see Cohen, 1990).\nHigh levels of loneliness have been linked to higher risks of\nmental illness and suicide (Peplau & Perlman, 1982; Weiss,\n1973). High levels of depression are significantly related\nto poorer health and greater morbidity as well as higher\nrisks of institutionalization, suicide, and overall mortality\nI also acknowledge that the availability of children and\nparental status can influence loneliness and depression in\nvarious ways, but the current research does not attempt to\nmodel these pathways. Instead, the purpose of this research\nis to test whether there is such an effect in a representative\nsample and to identify subgroups for whom childlessness\nmay have a more detrimental impact. However, to the ex-\ntent that relationship quality, proximity of adult children,\nand personal expectations modify the effects of parenthood,\nfailure to include indicators will bias estimates of the ef-\nfects of childlessness in a conservative direction.\nResearch Questions and Hypotheses\nIn order to focus on the importance of adult children as\nan enduring and central source of social support, childless-\nness is defined here as never having had any biological or\nadoptive children. These permanently childless adults are\ncompared to their peers who are biological parents with at\nleast one surviving child. Because of the inherent, norma-\ntive ambiguity and diversity in the experience of steppar-\nenthood (see Cherlin & Furstenberg, 1994), the existence or\nabsence of stepchildren is not considered in this article.\nThe present analyses begin by testing the basic questions:\nDoes childlessness influence loneliness and depression in\nolder adults? Is there an effect after other social factors such\nas marital status and living alone are controlled? The analy-\nses are then extended by examining the varying effects of\nchildlessness among particular subgroups of older adults.\nFirst, how are the patterns of effects different for men and\nwomen? Second, do the effects of childlessness vary de-\npending on marital status? The data collected in the NSFH\nprovide the basis for an updated portrait of the role of family\nhistory in shaping subjective well-being in later life.\nDrawing on previous research, childlessness is not ex-\npected to be directly linked with subjective well-being.\nHowever, parental status is expected to have an impact for\ncertain subgroups as outlined below.\nGender.--Gender socialization and expectations empha-\nsize parental status as more salient for women throughout\ntheir lives. Social norms have defined women's adult iden-\ntities, social value, and development around the norma-\ntively prescribed role of mother, whereas men are generally\nevaluated in their roles and accomplishments outside the\ning stigmatized because of their childlessness (Miall, 1986;\nVeevers, 1980), and questions about social value and fe-\nmale identity persist beyond menopause into old age (Alex-\ndocumented the greater closeness of mother-child relations\nand the greater importance of parenthood for women com-\nfore, to the extent that childlessness may adversely affect\nloneliness and depression, such an effect is expected for\nwomen but not for men.\nMarital history and current marital status.--Marital his-\ntory plays an important role in shaping fertility experience\nover the life course. Societal proscriptions against nonmari-\ntal childbearing have linked the prospects for parenthood\nwith the commencement and timing of marriage. In turn,\nthe expectations, experiences, and evaluations of the child-\nless status are defined in the context of the marital history.\nSome studies have suggested that childlessness may be\nmore salient for elders who were formerly married (Beck-\nactions between marital and parental status have not been\ntested using nationally representative data. The present\nanalyses compare the levels of reported loneliness and de-\npression among subgroups of older persons who are defined\nby marital and parental status.\nBecause the emotional and instrumental support avail-\nable within marriage generally provides for the needs of\nmarried elders, childlessness is not expected to influence\nsubjective well-being (see Keith, 1983b). For those who are\nwidowed, on the other hand, the availability of adult chil-\ndren may represent a substitute for lost spousal support\nthat childless married couples form intense dyads that are\noften isolated from other social ties; these childless elders\nare particularly vulnerable upon widowhood. A significant,\ndetrimental effect of childlessness is therefore expected\namong widowed respondents.\nFor divorced older adults, on the other hand, children\nmay represent additional stresses in the divorce process, in-\ncluding negotiations of financial support and contact, as\nwell as single parenthood for the custodial parent. For the\nchildless, the timing of divorce may contribute to the ab-\nsence of children, and it may provide a long adjustment pe-\nriod in which to establish a supportive social network.\nTherefore, no adverse effect of childlessness is expected\namong separated and divorced adults.\nFinally, childlessness that is linked with never marrying is\nnot expected to be detrimental for women or men. The never\nmarried may feel more detached from the idea of parent-\nhood because it was contingent on an event that never oc-\ncurred, or their single status may be linked with a desire to\navoid conventional family expectations. In addition, because\nnever married, childless status is lifelong, the social net-\nworks of single elders would reflect long-term activity and\nplanning for contingencies, including old age and sickness.\nMETHODS\nData\nThe National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH)\nprovides uniquely rich data for studying the salience of\nparental status among older adults. Whereas most surveys\nof older adults have asked only a single, broad question\nabout the number of surviving children, the NSFH has col-\nlected detailed information that distinguishes between bio-\nlogical and adopted children. The effects of childlessness,\ntherefore, can be tested using a precise definition of\nthrough face-to-face interviews and self-administered ques-\ntionnaires completed by primary respondents (chosen ran-\ndomly from each household; see Sweet, Bumpass, & Call,\nweighted) have never given birth or fathered a child (256\nThe group aged 50 to 84 consists of survivors of the co-\nat 50 in order to restrict consideration to persons whose\nchildlessness is most likely a permanent status. Because the\nsample includes only community-dwelling respondents, the\nmaximum age is set at 84 years to minimize selectivity bi-\nases related to institutionalization and to higher nonresponse\nrates among the oldest old (see Herzog & Rodgers, 1988).\nTable 1 summarizes the proportion of adults in each of\nseveral demographic subgroups who remained permanently\nchildless. The proportion childless does not vary by sex or\nrace. The age pattern of childlessness for women reflects\nnational fertility levels for these cohorts (see Chen & Mor-\ngan, 1991), whereas men's fertility levels are less varied.\nMarital status shows an expected pattern that reflects social\nnorms and age distributions. Note that the small number of\nnever married parents, 20 women and 8 men, are excluded\nin order to clarify the analyses of marital and parental status\ndifferences. Men's work status differences also reflect the\nhigh prevalence of childlessness among the very old.\nA comparison of parents and biologically childless re-\nspondents is summarized in Table 2. The patterns of educa-\ntional attainment among women reflect the selectivity of\nhighly educated women into the childless life course (see\nVeevers, 1980). Self-reported physical health does not vary\nsignificantly by parental status and matches physical health\nprofiles reported in other national data for noninstitutional-\nized persons in this age range (see Taeuber, 1992). As ex-\npected, childless men and women are much more likely to\nlive alone compared to parents, although two-person house-\nholds are most common in each group.\nIt should be noted that among the biologically childless,\n49 women and 53 men have adopted children. However,\nbecause adoptive parenthood is qualitatively different from\nboth complete childlessness and biological parenthood,\nthese respondents are not included in the analyses. Parents\nwith no surviving children (40 women and 8 men) are also\nexcluded. This study is based on the remaining subset of\nDependent Variables\nDepression is measured using a modified version of the\nCenter for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale\n(CES-D) which includes affective symptoms (e.g., lonely,\nsad, depressed) as well as symptoms of disrupted or re-\ntarded activity (e.g., poor appetite, problems concentrat-\ning). Respondents were asked in the self-administered\nquestionnaire how often in the last week they experienced\neach of 12 depressive symptoms, on a scale from 0 to 7.\nThe total depression score is the sum of the 12 items and\nranges from 0 to 84. Although the CES-D has been devel-\noped primarily as \"a measure of symptoms and moods\nrather than of illness or disorder\" (Ensel, 1986, p. 51), high\nCES-D scores are highly predictive of clinical diagnoses of\nmore information on the CES-D, see Ensel, 1986, or\nRadloff, 1977). Developed as a screening instrument for\nuse in population surveys, the CES-D has been used suc-\ncessfully with older populations (see Bojrab et al., 1988).\nTable 2.

This question ap-\npears as part of the 12-item CES-D depression scale. The\nloneliness score is highly correlated with the total CES-D\nscore (r = .75) and with the CES-D score excluding the\nloneliness item (r = .69), but multivariate regression analy-\nses show that loneliness and CES-D scores have different\npatterns of covariation with the independent variables of in-\nterest in the current research. Therefore, results for loneli-\nness and depression are presented and discussed separately.\nOther research has suggested that the individual items of\nthe CES-D vary in their response patterns among particular\nsubgroups of the population and warrant analyses of indi-\nvidual items and factors as well as composite scores (see\nCoyle & Rubege, 1992; Kessler, Foster, Webster, & House,\nSeveral weaknesses of the loneliness measure are noted.\nFirst, any single-item measure is limited in its variability\nand range compared to multi-item scales. Second, the lone-\nliness question is not designed for use as a single item, and\nit is not clear how a single item within the context of a\nlarger depression scale is answered by respondents. Specifi-\ncally, its placement in the scale may bias the responses:\nrather than responding to the concept of loneliness per se,\npeople may be responding to the overall series of questions\non depression. Therefore, social desirability biases would\npredict lower reported levels of loneliness because of an\nunwillingness to admit depression. This bias is likely to un-\nderestimate actual levels of loneliness in the population, but\nit is not expected to bias comparisons between subgroups\nof elderly men and women.\nOn the other hand, the face validity of single, direct\nquestions measuring loneliness has been verified, and com-\nparisons of multiple measures of loneliness report high cor-\nrelations between single questions and other measures (see\nHowitt, 1990). Self-reported measures may underestimate\nthe prevalence of loneliness because of social desirability\nbiases, but several scholars (Perlman & Peplau, 1982;\nShute & Howitt, 1990) have noted that admitted loneliness\nmay be conceptually more meaningful than high scores on\nindirect scaled measures (two major scales do not include\nthe words \"lonely\" or \"loneliness\"; see deJong-Gierveld,\nthat any biases in the findings will be in a conservative di-\nrection and that lower admission of loneliness among older\npersons and men will not affect intragroup comparisons.\nTheoretical work on loneliness has distinguished an\nemotional component of isolation, which pertains to a per-\nceived lack of intimacy, and a social component, which de-\nscribes a feeling of exclusion or mafginality from social ties\nAbakoumkin, & Schut, 1996). Recent research has sug-\ngested that a direct, single-item measure of loneliness may\ntap the emotional dimension of loneliness more than social\nisolation (Dugan & Kivett, 1994). Arguably, the direct\nquestion used here may tap either dimension (or both), but\nboth components of loneliness are likely to be linked to the\nabsence of adult children.\nPrevious research has identified a cutoff score for the\nCES-D roughly corresponding to the highest 20th per-\ncentile of depression scores (Ensel, 1986), which is highly\npredictive of clinical depression. A measure of high depres-\nsion has been created to designate scores that fall in the\ncontinuous and dichotomous depression measures are ana-\nIndependent Variables\nThe main independent variable in these analyses is child-\nlessness, a dichotomous variable indicating that the respon-\ndent has never adopted, fathered, or given birth to a child.\nSeparate models are run for men and women. Marital status\nis operationalized as a series of indicator variables--sepa-\nrated or divorced (referred to hereafter as divorced), wid-\nowed, and never married--with married as the reference\ncategory. Health, age, race (White compared to non-White\nas reference category), educational attainment, work status,\nand living alone are also used as controls in the multivariate\nmodels. Health is measured using a single, self-rated health\nquestion, \"Compared with other people your age, how\nwould you describe your health?\" Scores range from 1 for\npoor to 5 for excellent. Age is used as a continuous vari-\nable. Educational attainment is coded as a series of indica-\ntor variables for less than high school, some college, and\ncollege degree or more, with completion of high school\nused as the reference category. Work and residence status\nare coded as dichotomous variables indicating whether the\nperson worked for pay or lived alone, respectively, at the\ntime of the survey.\nAnalytical Method\nThe multivariate analyses include the sociodemographic\nvariables--health, race, age, educational attainment, work\nstatus, living arrangement, and marital status--as controls\nin predicting the effect of childlessness on the outcome\nmeasures. Ordinary least-squares regression is used to ana-\nlyze the continuous scores of loneliness and depression,\nwhereas logistic regression is used to analyze the dichoto-\nmous score of high depression.\nRESULTS\nDirect Effects of Childlessness\nResults from bivariate analyses of loneliness and depres-\nsion by parental status are reported in Table 3. Childless-\nness significantly increases loneliness and depression among\nmen, but no statistically significant differences are observed\namong women. The bivariate relations observed for men\nare no longer significant after controlling for living alone or\nmarital status. The results of OLS regressions predicting\nloneliness and depression and logistic regressions predict-\ning the likelihood of high depression, presented in Table 4,\nindicate that the effect of childlessness is positive but not\nstatistically significant in each model. However, the effects\nof childlessness on women's loneliness and likelihood of\nhigh depression approach significance (p = .086 and p =\n.085, respectively). Among the other variables, poor health\nis strongly related to greater loneliness and depression for\nTable 3.

Both loneliness\nand depression are significantly higher among divorced\nwomen. A similar pattern is observed for men, with wid-\nowed men reporting greater loneliness and depression and\ndivorced men reporting significantly greater loneliness.\nNever married men and women are not significantly differ-\nent from the currently married. In logistic regression analy-\nses of the likelihood of reporting high depression, formerly\nmarried men and women are significantly more likely to re-\nport high depression.\nConditional Effects of Childlessness\nGender.--The interaction between childlessness and gen-\nder is tested by including a multiplicative interaction term\nin the OLS regression models and running them on the en-\ntire sample. There is a significant, direct effect of gender,\nwith women reporting significantly higher levels of loneli-\nness and depression compared with men. However, neither\nparental status nor the interaction between childlessness\nand gender is statistically significant.\nMarital status.--This study tested whether the effects of\nchildlessness are conditional on marital status by defining a\ntypology based on marital status and childlessness. For\neach ever-married group, marital-parental status combina-\ntions are defined by a series of indicator variables. These\nsix variables along with the never married status are added\nto the multivariate models. Married parents serve as the ref-\nerence category. Results from these models are presented in\nTable 5. Divorced mothers are significantly more lonely\nand depressed than married mothers. Divorced fathers are\nsignificantly more lonely and more likely to be highly de-\npressed compared with married fathers. Among both men\nand women, widowed persons are more lonely regardless\nof parental status and their depression levels are generally\nhigher, compared with married parents. Never married,\nchildless men and women appear very similar to the cur-\nrently married on both measures of well-being. Comparing\nthe coefficients within each gender-marital status subgroup,\nhowever, I fail to reject the null hypothesis of no difference\nbetween the parents and childless.\nDISCUSSION\nIn sum, the results show that permanent childlessness\ndoes not represent a statistically significant, universal dis-\nadvantage in terms of greater loneliness or depression for\neither men or women, net of other factors. The absence of a\ngeneral parental status effect confirms my hypotheses and\nagrees with earlier work. Parental status represents a back-\nground variable in studies of subjective well-being, and it is\nexpected to have very weak, if any, effects compared to the\nperceptions and expectations of social relationships (de-\nJong-Gierveld, 1987). The current findings indicate that\npersistent beliefs linking childlessness with diminished well-\nbeing in later life are not supported empirically, at least not\nfor the population as a whole.\nThe absence of any strong, adverse effect of childless-\nness among women deserves attention. Pronatalist social\nnorms experienced by today's older cohorts have con-\nstrained women's choices and have marginalized childless\nwomen, whereas men have largely been exempt from these\npressures. Alexander and colleagues (1992) have noted that\nolder women's regrets about their childlessness are inter-\nwoven with strong criticisms of the norms that have labeled\nthem as deviant and that have equated normative woman-\nhood with motherhood. The current results suggest that the\npressures and stigma experienced by women may not have\nstrong, lasting consequences in later life.\nA weak effect, however, is observed. In regression mod-\nels predicting loneliness and the dichotomous measure of\nhigh depression among women, the effects of childlessness\napproach significance using the more conservative, two-\ntailed criterion (p = .086 and p = .085, respectively). Social\nnorms would suggest a one-tailed alternative hypothesis, a\ndetrimental effect of childlessness on well-being. Using a\none-tailed test, therefore, the effects of childlessness are\nstatistically significant, indicating a weak but deleterious\neffect for women.\nFor both men and women, widowhood is linked with sig-\nnificantly greater loneliness and generally greater depres-\nsion regardless of parental status. The absence of a signifi-\ncant parental status effect among widowed adults is\nsomewhat surprising and counters the conclusions from\nearlier studies (Beckman & Houser, 1982; Johnson & Cata-\nlano, 1981). The loss of a spouse greatly diminishes subjec-\ntive well-being among older adults, and the hypothesized\nbenefit of adult children as a buffer in easing a parent's be-\nreavement and providing support is not observed.\nOn the other hand, among divorced older adults, a statis-\nTable 4.

This finding may reflect the family stresses associ-\nated with divorce as well as more distant relationships for\nnoncustodial parents. Within the context of divorce, the\nobligations and ties between parents and their adult chil-\ndren may be more ambiguous and strained (see Cooney &\nIt should be noted, however, that all of the coefficients\nfor the divorced and widowed groups are positive, although\nnot all are statistically significant. However, testing sepa-\nrately within each gender-marital status group, no statisti-\ncally significant differences are observed between the child-\nless and parents (though this may in part reflect the loss of\nstatistical power with diminishing cell sizes). The larger co-\nefficients among the childless in nearly every subgroup of\never-married adults nonetheless suggest a pattern that mer-\nits further research.\nThe absence of significant differences between never\nmarried adults and their married peers suggests that I\nmust look beyond current, structural indicators such as\nmarital status and parental status to understand variations in\nsubjective well-being. Although a number of studies have\naffirmed the positive benefits of marriage, especially for\nmen (see Waite, 1995), the relative well-being of never\nmarried adults has received little attention. Never married\nadults establish personal and social resources for maintain-\ning their well-being through an ongoing process of \"antici-\npatory socialization\" (Johnson & Catalano, 1981), cultivat-\nTable 5.

The results underscore the importance\nof marital history in defining the salience of parental status;\nthe negative findings reported in earlier research and in\nthe direct-effect models may reflect offsetting influences\namong the different marital status groups.\nIt should be noted that different definitions of childless-\nness produce different results. Preliminary analyses (not\nshown) indicate significantly higher loneliness and depres-\nsion among women who are biologically childless, adoptive\nparents. On the other hand, the effects of being biologically\nchildless with stepchildren or of having survived one's bio-\nlogical children are not statistically significant. Although\nthey lie beyond the current focus on enduring, normatively\ndefined parent-child ties, these findings nonetheless raise\nserious questions about surveys that do not differentiate\nbetween biological, adoptive, and stepchildren. The in-\ncreasing complexity of the familial life course argues for\ngreater attention to the distinctions between biological and\nsocial parenting in future studies of middle-aged and older\npopulations.\nOne shortcoming of this study is the exclusion of the in-\nstitutionalized and extreme aged from the sample. Because\nlack of social supports is a major determinant of institution-\nalization for frail, elderly persons, excluding them may pro-\nduce an overly positive picture of childlessness in late life.\nInstitutionalization may have removed from the sample the\nmost lonely, depressed, and vulnerable childless elders,\nleaving a subset of community-dwelling elders with better\nsocial supports or stronger adaptive capacities (see Johnson\nther eliminates a group for whom loneliness and depression\nin the face of declines in health and function would be\nmore prevalent and more devastating.\nThis study provides a basic, structural description of dif-\nferential vulnerability in later life in a nationally representa-\ntive sample, but further replication is needed. The next step\nfor informing scholarship and practice is to identify the\nmechanisms and pathways through which parental status\nproduces different consequences depending on marital sta-\ntus and history. Further research by the author has begun to\nidentify important evaluative factors which condition the\nexperience of parental status--the role of attitudes in condi-\ntioning the effects of childlessness and of parent-child rela-\ntionship quality in shaping the effects of parenthood. Future\nresearch should also examine the relative contributions of\nsocial resource deficits, changes in social norms (especially\nfor women), and qualitative differences in the experience of\nchildlessness or parenthood.\n"
