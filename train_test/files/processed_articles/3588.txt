The vivid impression of\ndepth often associated with binocular stereopsis can also be achieved in other ways, for example,\nusing a synopter. Accounts of this go back over a hundred years. These ways of viewing all aim to\ndiminish sensorial evidence that the picture is physically flat. Although various viewing modes have\nbeen proposed in the literature, their effects have never been compared. In the current study, we\ncompared three viewing modes: monocular blur, synoptic viewing, and free viewing (using a\nplacebo synopter). By designing a physical embodiment that was indistinguishable for the three\nexperimental conditions, we kept observers nai\n\u00a8ve with respect to the differences between them;\n197 observers participated in an experiment where the three viewing modes were compared by\nperforming a rating task. Results indicate that synoptic viewing causes the largest plastic effect.\nMonocular blur scores lower than synoptic viewing but is still rated significantly higher than the\nbaseline conditions. The results strengthen the idea that synoptic viewing is not due to a placebo\neffect. Furthermore, monocular blur has been verified for the first time as a way of experiencing\nthe plastic effect, although the effect is smaller than synoptic viewing.

These ways of viewing include the following:\n1. Monocular viewing (even better when using an aperture).\n2. Optically decrease interocular distance (Javals' iconoscope).\n3. Increase the viewing distance.\n4. Looking through an artificial pupil.\n5. Change accommodation to infinity (using a lens).\n6. Change convergence to parallel.\n7. Introduce blur in one eye.\n8. Looking through a mirror.\n9. Looking through a synopter.\nThese ways of viewing have all been discussed earlier (Ames, 1925; Blundell, 2015;\nSchlosberg, 1941), including a concise overview of our own (Wijntjes, Fu\n\u00a8 zy, Verheij,\nWhat all these viewing modes have in common is that they change or eliminate the\nnonpictorial depth cues of accommodation, vergence, and binocular disparity. When\nviewing a picture normally, these cues will signal that the stimulus is flat. Although\npictures are indeed physically flat, they often contain pictorial depth cues that create an\nimpression of three-dimensional space, also known as pictorial space. In these cases (that\noccur continuously in our daily lives), the visual system is confronted with a cue conflict\nsituation: Nonpictorial cues signal a flat stimulus, while pictorial cues signal a deep stimulus.\nA common explanation of the plastic effect is that perceived depth is the result of (possibly\nweighted) averaging of physical flatness and pictorial depth (Ames, 1925). Thus, removing\nthe physical flatness would result in a relatively increased impression of depth, which is the\nplastic effect. This explanation predicts quantitative changes in depth as has been found by\nKoenderink et al., (1994) but could not be verified by Vishwanath & Hibbard, (2013). An\nalternative explanation of the plastic effect is the ``absolute depth scaling hypothesis''\n(Vishwanath, 2014) which does not predict a quantitative depth change. According to this\nhypothesis, perturbing the reliability of depth cues specifying the flat picture surface results in\nascribing distance information deriving from absolute depth cues (like accommodation,\nvergence, and vertical disparities) to pictorial depth cues allowing them to be scaled in a\nmanner similar to the scaling of binocular disparities. The similar scaling mechanism is\naccording to Vishwanath (2014) responsible for the phenomenological similarity.\nNot all of the viewing modes have been empirically investigated, and some of these\n(although mentioned separately in the literature) are largely similar. For example, Javals'\niconoscope uses four mirrors to decrease the virtual interocular distance, while the synopter\ncompletely nullifies the virtual interocular distance due to a half translucent mirror. The\nviewing modes that have attracted the least amount of attention in the literature seem to\nbe the artificial pupil (4) and monocular blurring (7). The concept of the artificial pupil\noriginates from Ames (1925) who recommends an aperture size of 2 mm or larger. Similar\nto photography, the sharpness of the retinal image depends less on the accommodation for\nsmall aperture sizes than for large apertures. The limiting case is the pinhole camera where no\nlens is needed. Using a small artificial pupil will thus decrease the reliability of the\naccommodation cue. Ames (1925) notes that the eye seems to automatically change\naccommodation (because it cannot find a sharp image) resulting in apparent changes of\nobject size. Vishwanath and Hibbard (2013) used a much larger aperture (12\u00ad15 mm)\nkeeping potential depth information from accommodation reliable. This raises the\n2 i-Perception\nquestion of whether reducing the reliability even more would substantially improve the\nplastic effect. Aside from these theoretical considerations, we informally found that\nlooking through a very tiny aperture is rather cumbersome. The reader can easily verify\nthis him or herself by punching holes in an opaque sheet of cardboard (we used a hole\npuncher that ships with a DIY music box kit).\nThe other neglected viewing mode appears more promising: monocular blurring. Here, one\neye receives a blurred image while the other eye receives a sharp image. This binocular\nsharpness difference disturbs the stereo correspondence problem, that is, the accurate\nmatching of retinal image features from which disparities are computed. The obvious\napparent downside is that the observer may become aware of the binocular conflict and\nexperience alternating rivalry between the sharp and blurred image. However, it is well\nknown (Levelt, 1966) that in this specific case of a sharp and blurred image, the sharpest\nimage generally dominates awareness. Therefore, the observer should theoretically not be too\nmuch bothered by an alternating percept.\nIn the study presented here, we wanted to test this aforementioned viewing mode and\nverify whether the plastic effect can be induced by monocular blur. Initially, we planned to\nuse the synopter as a baseline condition for the plastic effect. The synopter is an optical device\ninvented by von Rohr (1907) that gives both eyes a similar viewpoint and thus eliminate\ndisparity information. Furthermore, it forces the eyes to have parallel binocular vergence.\nPreviously, we investigated the contribution of pictorial cues to the plastic effect by using a\nvariety of paintings using a newly designed synopter (Wijntjes et al., 2016).\nWhile the synopter appears to be a good candidate to compare new, untested viewing\nmodes with, we realized that the synopter itself has never been thoroughly tested against a\nbaseline condition of normal binocular picture viewing. In our previous study (Wijntjes et al.,\n2016), we let observers compare synoptic viewing with free viewing. Although we found\ncoherent results among observers for a large variety of paintings, we did not address the\npotential contribution of a placebo effect: Maybe merely viewing through a box and thereby\nintroducing an artificial frame was evoking the sensation of stereoscopic depth, and not the\noptical design itself. Thus, for a fair comparison between the synopter and monocular blur we\nshould also involve normal binocular viewing.\nIt is not straightforward to make a prediction which viewing mode will result in the largest\nplastic effect. The reason is that monocular blur and synoptic viewing perturb nonpictorial\ndepth cues in different ways. Monocular blur theoretically alters the sensitivity of both\nvergence and disparity signals, while synoptic viewing introduces a bias in the vergence\nand disparity signals. Theories explaining the plastic effect (e.g., Ames [1925] or\nVishwanath [2014]) do not make a distinction between these two ways of altering the\nnonpictorial signals. Therefore, our experiment will not settle the debate which theory best\ndescribes the plastic effect, neither are we able to predict which viewing mode may results in\nthe strongest plastic effect. However, the current study will provide empirical insights that\nmay help theory formation concerning the plastic effect. Furthermore, the study will also\nreveal whether it is more efficient to alter the bias (synopter) or sensitivity (monocular blur) to\nachieve the optimal plastic effect.\nMethods\nVenue and Context\nThe experiment took place during a three-day festival called Campingflight to Lowlands,\nperformances but also various other kinds of cultural activities. Our experiment was part\nWijntjes 3\nof the Lowlands Science program and was located in the ArtTube tent, a venue where visitors\ncould take part in various art-related activities and experiments. The experiment was\nParticipants\nA total of 193 visitors participated in our experiment; 97 were male, 93 were female, and 3 did\nnot specify their gender. Average age was 30 years with the youngest participant being 15 and\nthe oldest being 63. Participants were asked whether they had used something ``that could\ninfluence their judgments,'' 54 responded affirmative. Specifying their usage, 46 responded\nthat they had used alcohol (13 consumed one unit, 2 consumed two units, 1 consumed three\nunits, and 30 did not specify the total). A total of six had used cannabis (four in combination\nwith alcohol). Binocular stereo vision was assessed through self-report: Five responded to\nhave ill binocular stereo vision.\nApparatus and Stimuli\nWe used three types of viewing devices. From the outside, all three looked similar, but the\ninterior was very different. The first device (see Figure 1) was a synopter close to described by\nWijntjes et al. (2016). We used a wooden (plywood) embodiment with a black spray painted\ninterior. The second device was similar to the synopter but we removed the full mirror in the\nleft eye. Therefore, the right eye was looking through a half mirror while the left eye had no\nobstruction. With this design, stereovision is not impaired and should work normally: It is a\nplacebo synopter. We kept the half mirror on the right eye to introduce luminance differences\nbetween the two eyes, which also occurs in our normal synopter due to the low beam splitting\nquality of the acrylate half mirror. The third device had a similar embodiment as the other\ntwo devices but did not have any mirrors. Instead, we glued a reading glass lens of \u00fe3 diopter\nSynopter Placebo Blur\nFigure 1. The three devices used in the experiment. Top row depicts them from the point of view of the\nstimulus (the observers' face should be behind the device). Bottom row shows the qualitative optics involved.\n4 i-Perception\nbehind the right eye aperture. This lens introduces blur when viewing at the distance we used\nin our experiment (approximately 2 m).\nAs stimuli, we used matte prints of two paintings: The Watermill (c. 1664) by Meinder\nHobbema and The Milkmaid (c. 1660) by Johannes Vermeer, both paintings are in the\ncollection of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. They were printed on A2 sized paper, resulting\nthe Milkmaid. The prints were attached to poster boards at approximately eye height (about\n170 cm). Pictures documenting the experimental environment are shown in Figure 2.\nProcedure\nObservers were first explained that we were investigating various devices that had been\nhypothesized to increase pictorial depth. We asked the observers to assess the three devices\nby rating them between 1 (no effect) and 10 (huge depth effect). They were informed that the\nabsolute values of the ratings were not very important to us, and that we were primarily\ninterested in the relative differences between the values. To assess the effect of the viewing\ndevices, the observers were asked to compare perception with and without device by\nalternately looking through the device, and looking past it.\nObservers were instructed to look at approximately 2 m distance, although in practice this\ndistance could vary somewhat. The devices were presented on a table, and the observers\ncould freely alternate between them. The order of viewing was random in the sense that the\ndevices were randomly presented on the table; the observers chose their own order. Most\nobservers were either looking at the Watermill or the Milkmaid. Only at Day 2 did we start\nlogging this independent variable, which amounts to about 100 cases.\nThe experiment was performed in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki and\napproved by the TU Delft Human Research Ethics Committee.\nData Analysis\nResponses were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance with age as\ncovariate, and gender, stimulus, and reported drug use as between-visitor factors.\nResults\nThe average ratings per viewing device are displayed in Figure 3. As can be seen, the real\nsynopter was rated highest, the placebo version the lowest and the blur device was rated in\nFigure 2. The experimental scene. On the left, an experimenter explains the experiment with the stimuli\nvisible in the background. Middle and right pictures show observer holding the devices to look at either or\nthe stimuli.\nWijntjes 5\nbetween. A statistical main effect was confirmed by the (Greenhouse-Geisser corrected)\npairwise comparisons revealed that all conditions were significantly different from each\nother (p < .05). Neither the covariates age, nor the between-subject factors gender, stimulus\nand reported drug use had a significant influence on the ratings.\nBecause we had instructed the participants to primarily focus on the relative differences\nbetween their ratings, and not so much on the absolute values, we also (descriptively)\nanalyzed the subjective ordering. In Figure 4, we plotted a histogram of the various\nordering combinations. The numbers on the y axis denote the order: 2 is highest, 1\nintermediate, and 0 lowest. As can be seen, the synopter scored highest in almost 70% of\nthe cases (the sum of the lowest three bars). Furthermore, the configuration with the synopter\nhighest, placebo lowest, and monocular blur intermediate (lowest bar, 42%) is by far\noccurring most often: It is three times more than the follow-up configuration (synopter\nhighest, no difference between placebo and monocular blur: 14%).\nR\neal\nPlacebo\nBlur\nGrade\nFigure 3. Average ratings and standard errors for the three viewing conditions.\n6 i-Perception\nDiscussion\nWe found that both monocular blur and synoptic viewing induced the plastic effect in\ncomparison with the baseline condition of normal binocular viewing. Furthermore, the\nsynopter evoked a larger plastic effect than monocular blur. Therefore, we can conclude\nthat previous findings (e.g., Wijntjes et al., 2016) cannot be attributed to a placebo effect\nand that the hitherto neglected viewing mode of monocular blur indeed enhances the\nBased on our (informal) experience with synopter demonstration events, the large\ndifference between the synopter and the placebo hardly comes as a surprise. Often,\nobservers express surprise when looking at a painting through a synopter. However, it had\nnever been experimentally verified whether these expressions could be attributed to some kind\nof placebo effect. Since our placebo version has a similar embodiment as the synopter, we can\nalso safely argue that the synoptic effect cannot be attributed to looking through a box that\nmasks much of the periphery. It may certainly help with concentrating on an artwork while\nwearing blinkers (used to focus the horse gaze), but it is not solely responsible for the plastic\neffect.\nWe also found that monocular blur increases the plastic effect, in comparison with the\nbaseline condition of the placebo. Perturbing binocular vergence and disparities through\nblurring one of the images increased the impression of pictorial depth. This finding implies\nthe design of a very simple plastic effect device: A pair of reading glasses and with one of the\nlenses removed. However, we found that the effect of monocular blur is substantially weaker\nthan the synopter. It may also be noteworthy that we never observed expressions of\nspontaneous surprise associated with synoptic viewing. This may be reflected by the\nabsolute rating values. Although observers were instructed to primarily focus on the\nSynopter\nPlacebo\nBlur\nFigure 4. Histogram of the various orderings that were present in the results. Highest is denoted by 2,\nmiddle by 1, and lowest by 0. If a number is presented twice, these viewing modes were graded similarly. As\ncan be seen, synopter highest (2), monocular blur middle (1), and placebo lowest (0) dominate the data.\nWijntjes 7\nrelative grades, it is likely that observers were inclined to use an absolute scale. Since the scale\nused on the experiment was between 1 and 10, it is probable that observers referred to the\nexamination grades used in the Netherlands, that fall between 1 and 10. In this system, 5 and\nlower is insufficient, 6 and higher is sufficient. Taking this into account, monocular blur\nscores insufficient, while the synopter passes the exam.\nDuring the experiment, we picked up introspective comments indicating unforeseen\nnegative side effects of the synoptic parallel vergence. Sometimes, observers responded that\nthey saw two images when looking through the synopter. This occurs when observers set their\nvergence at the physical viewing distance. Possibly, accommodation or familiar size (the\nimages had been seen when entering the space and may have a typical size of an average\npainting or poster) causes this vergence setting to occur. We heard from at least one\nparticipant that he rated the placebo higher because it did not give him double images. As\ncan be inferred from Figure 3, there are four types of orderings in which the placebo was\nhigher rated than the synopter. These four amount to 11.4% of the observers. Although this\nis not a large amount, it is important to consider that these cases may mitigate an actually\nlarger difference between the synopter and placebo condition.\nAlthough accounts referring to the plastic effect have existed in the literature for over a\nhundred years, it has hardly been studied. The most salient experimental findings are changes\nin pictorial relief using either a synopter (Koenderink et al., 1994) or a zograscope or\ngraphoscope (Koenderink et al., 2013) and the experiential similarity between binocular\nstereo and monocular aperture viewing (Vishwanath & Hibbard, 2013). The\naforementioned viewing devices are illustrated in Figure 5. Besides the empirical findings,\nthere is relatively little theoretical work. As outlined in the introduction, the two main\ntheories explaining the plastic effect (cue combination and absolute depth scaling) do not\nseem to have been described in sufficient detail to quantitatively predict effect differences. One\ndifficulty is the distinction between sensitivity and bias of the physiologically altered cues. For\nmonocular blur, the sensitivities of the vergence and disparity cues are decreased. For\nsynoptic viewing, the vergence and disparity cues are biased. In the latter case, the biasing\nof the cues toward infinity may result in a decrease of their reliability. Therefore, in both\nviewing modes, the reliability of physiological depth cues is decreased but in very different\nways. This made it difficult to compare quantitatively in this study. Nevertheless, it is not\nimpossible to design future experiments that address this by systematically investigate\nnonpictorial cues. For example, sensitivity studies can be conducted on the various ways\nof viewing to quantify the size of variances introduced by the viewing modes. Also, it is\nZograscope Graphoscope Hills' Graphoscope `Graphoscopic' optics\nFigure 5. Illustration of the zograscope and graphoscope, including Hills' variation. The principle relies at\nleast partly on the prismatic nature of the lens edges (Michaud, 1908) illustrated at the right.\n8 i-Perception\npossible to alter the vergence of the synopter toward the viewing distance without affecting\nthe disparities, which could reveal the contribution of binocular vergence. Another\ninteresting device that may help answering these questions is Hill's (1898) graphoscope\nwhich forces vergence to be parallel using prisms, without affecting disparities as shown in\nBesides the fundamentally interesting underlying mechanisms of the plastic effect, studies\non various ways of viewing the plastic effect also have practical relevance. The consumer\ninterest in three-dimensional displays and virtual reality indicates that people are interested in\nseeing pictures differently. However, these novel techniques are only applicable when a stereo\nimage pair is available. There are numerous examples of occasions where this is impossible.\nOur personal favorite application is looking at paintings in a museum, but also more\nmundane activities such as viewing personal photos on a screen may become more\ninteresting when the plastic effect is present. Thus, studying and applying old techniques\nand inventions concerning the plastic effect may be a valuable addition next to the high-\ntech advances of virtual reality, as has recently been argued by Blundell (2015). The current\nfindings in combination with our previous study (Wijntjes et al., 2016) indicates that the\nsynopter version we used in these studies is a good candidate for viewing pictures at distances\nof about 1.5 to 2 m. For presentations on small displays that are close to the eyes, other\ndevices may be useful, such as the Verant lens (also by von Rohr), or Hill's graphoscope. And\npossibly there is some space left for novel devices yet to be invented.\n"
