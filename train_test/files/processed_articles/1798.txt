We sought to examine the association of\nacculturation on healthy lifestyle habits among the Latino population in the\nUnited States with diabetes.\nMETHODS We studied Latino adults (aged 20 years) with previously diagnosed\nconsistent with recommendations of the American Diabetes Association (ADA)\nregarding exercise, smoking, obesity, and diet. Acculturation was measured with\nthe Short Acculturation Scale, a validated 5-item scale assessing use of the Spanish\nlanguage. Logistic regression analyses of acculturation and healthy behaviors were\ncomputed controlling for access to care, demographics, and disease characteristics.\nRESULTS In bivariate analyses, compared with their less-acculturated counterparts,\nindividuals who were more-acculturated to any extent were less likely to have a\nvs 46.5%, P=.03). More-acculturated individuals were more likely to report leisure\nwho smoked did not differ. In logistic regression analyses using the 1994 ADA\ndietary guidelines, more-acculturated individuals were less likely than their less-\nacculturated counterparts to meet dietary criteria for saturated fat consumption\n2006 ADA dietary guidelines, more-acculturated individuals were less likely to have\ncantly influence exercise and smoking status in logistic regression analyses.\nCONCLUSIONS These results suggest that acculturation among diabetic Latinos\nto the general US culture is associated with adoption of some less desirable\ndietary habits.\nINTRODUCTION\nDiabetes has reached epidemic proportions in the United States.1\nThe deleterious outcomes of this disease can be decreased\nthrough appropriate ongoing management and treatment.2 Dia-\nbetes burden is not distributed equally throughout the population. In par-\nticular, Latinos have a higher prevalence of diabetes, more complications,\nand worse outcomes than non-Latino whites.3-7 Quality of care for dia-\nbetes among Latinos continues to lag behind that for non-Latino whites.8\nMoreover, recent projections continue to predict an increasing prevalence\nof diabetes, particularly for Latinos.9\nThe US Census indicates that 14.5% of adult US residents are for-\neign-born.10 These immigrants, particularly minorities, may require inter-\nventions and modifications to the standard health care delivery system\nthat differ from those of their ethnic counterparts who are born in the\nArch G.

Differences in diabetes prevalence\nand care among ethnic subgroups are associated with\ndegree of acculturation.11,12 For example, Latinos who\nare less acculturated to the majority US culture tend\nto have a higher prevalence of diabetes and more\nOne aspect of successful diabetes management\ntakes place outside of the physician's office and entails\nthe patient adopting a healthy lifestyle. For patients\nwith diabetes, a healthy lifestyle includes an appro-\npriate diet and exercise.14,15 These self-management\nbehaviors related to lifestyle may be particularly influ-\nenced by culturally specific attitudes and beliefs.16-18 In\nparticular, some data suggest that acculturation for the\ngeneral population of Latinos has been associated with\nsuboptimal lifestyle choices, including a low intake of\nfruits and vegetables, a higher consumption of fats, and\nsmoking.19 Acculturation among Latinos with diabetes\nto the mainstream US culture may thus influence the\nhealthiness of their lifestyle, particularly depending on\nwhether the mainstream society has a healthy lifestyle.\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the associa-\ntion of acculturation with a healthy lifestyle among\nLatinos with diabetes in the United States.\nMETHODS\nDesign\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Partici-\npants in this survey constitute a nationally representative\nsample of the noninstitutionalized US population. The\nNHANES design includes an oversampling of minorities\nand enables determination of population estimates. The\nNHANES program is relatively unusual compared with\nother nationally representative surveys in that it com-\nbines interviews with physical examinations and labora-\ntory studies. More information on the methodology of\nments, can be found at the National Center for Health\nStatistics Web site.20 NHANES data are not obtained\nusing a simple random sample; rather, a complex, mul-\ntistage, probability sampling design is used to select\nparticipants representative of the civilian, noninstitu-\ntionalized US population. Certain population subgroups\nare oversampled to increase the reliability and precision\nof estimates of health status indicators for these groups.\nThe data are weighted to obtain population estimates of\nnoninstitutionalized individuals in the United States.\nSample\nThe individuals analyzed in our study were Latino\nadults (aged 20 years) with previously diagnosed\ndiabetes. The NHANES contains a series of questions\nasked to ascertain an individual's race and ethnicity.\nRace and Hispanic ethnicity were addressed in separate\nquestions. Latinos were the only group asked questions\non language, allowing for assessments of acculturation.\nInterviews were conducted in both English and Span-\nish by trained bilingual interviewers. Respondents were\nfree to switch between languages during the interview\ndepending on which language they were most com-\nfortable with in answering each question. Individuals\nwere considered to have previously diagnosed diabetes\nif they answered affirmatively to a question of \"Has a\ndoctor ever told you that you have diabetes?\" Analyses\nwere based on 467 individuals, who represented a US\nMeasures\nAcculturation Status\nAcculturation is an indication of the cultural change of\nminority individuals to the majority culture. Accultura-\ntion measures vary widely depending on the construct\nused. We used 2 general constructs available in the\nand country of birth. Both of these have been used\npreviously as proxies for acculturation.21-23\nThe degree of acculturation based on language was\nassessed using the Short Acculturation Scale (SAS), a\n5-item scale measuring use of the Spanish language that\nhas good internal reliability (Cronbach  0.90) and\nhas been shown to be comparable to longer published\nacculturation scales. This scale has been validated in\nseveral Hispanic populations, with correlations seen\nbetween measured acculturation and number of genera-\ntions living in the United States, length of time lived\nin the United States, age at the time of arrival in the\nUnited States, and self-reported acculturation.24 The\nscale consists of the following 5 questions: (1) In general,\nwhat language do you read and speak? (2) What was the\nlanguage(s) you used as a child? (3) What language(s) do\nyou usually speak at home? (4) In which language(s) do\nyou usually think? and (5) What language(s) do you usu-\nally speak with your friends? The options for answering\neach question are \"only Spanish,\" \"more Spanish than\nEnglish,\" \"both equally,\" \"more English than Spanish,\"\nand \"only English.\" These responses were each scored\non a scale from 0 to 4, yielding a total score ranging\nfrom 0 to 20, with higher scores signifying greater\nacculturation. The acculturation score was used to\ndefine 5 categories representing a continuum of accul-\nturation from Spanish language only (a score of 0),\nprimarily Spanish (1-5), about equal use of Spanish and\nEnglish (16-20). Because of the small size of the group\nwith previously diagnosed diabetes, we classified their\nacculturation simply as any (1-20) vs none (0).\nHealthy Lifestyle\nMeasures of healthy lifestyle included smoking, obe-\nsity, exercise, and diet. Current smoking status was\nascertained. Individuals with a body mass index (BMI)\nof 30 kg/m2 or greater were considered obese, and\nsidered overweight. Individuals were asked whether\nthey participated in vigorous or moderate levels of\nleisure time physical activity; those who reported nei-\nther vigorous nor moderate physical activities were\ncategorized as getting no exercise, whereas those who\nreported either or both were categorized as getting\nexercise. Respondents' diets were evaluated accord-\ning to whether they met the 1994 ADA guidelines for\nindividuals with diabetes in terms of daily fiber intake\n(20 g), cholesterol intake (300 mg), and saturated fat\nintake (<10% of total calories).25 In addition, their diets\nwere also assessed according to the 2006 ADA guide-\ncholesterol intake (<200 mg), and saturated fat intake\n(<7% of total calories) because these guidelines are\nmore restrictive and are recommended based on cur-\nDemographic Characteristics and Access to Care\nWe included the following demographic characteristics\nincome ratio (<1.0 vs 1.0), and education (high school\ngraduate vs not). Access to care was assessed from\nwhether the respondent had health insurance and a\nroutine place for health care.\nAnalysis\nBecause the NHANES has a complex sampling design\nthat makes the resulting sample representative of the\nnoninstitutionalized US population, we were able to\nmake nationally representative estimates. We used\nSUDAAN software (RTI International, Research Tri-\nangle Park, North Carolina) to account for the weight-\ning and complex sampling design. We performed 2\ntests for bivariate relationships between acculturation,\nas measured both by the SAS score and by country of\nbirth, and lifestyle measures.\nWe conducted multivariate analyses to investi-\ngate the relative odds that individuals with any level\nof acculturation (SAS score >0) practiced healthy\nhabits, such as not smoking, getting exercise, and eat-\ning a healthy diet. Logistic regression analyses were\ncomputed and controlled for the potential confound-\ning variables of age, sex, poverty, education, health\ninsurance, having a routine place for care, number of\nyears with diabetes, and having been told by a physi-\ncian that one has retinopathy, hypertension, or high\ncholesterol. The ADA recommendations have recently\nchanged regarding some dietary aspects of a healthy\nlifestyle, so we examined the relationship between\nacculturation and diet with both the recommenda-\ntions in place at the time of data collection (1994 ADA\nguidelines) and the current recommendations (2006\nADA guidelines). Because socioeconomic status could\npotentially modify the relationship between accultura-\ntion and lifestyle, we investigated interaction effects\nbetween health insurance, poverty, and education and\nthe SAS score in the models.\nRESULTS\nDepending on the measure used to assess acculturation,\nan estimated 36% to 69% of Latino individuals with\ndiabetes nationally were more-acculturated (Table 1).\nLatinos with diabetes who were less-accultur-\nated according to SAS score were predominantly\nfemale, and they were significantly more likely that\ntheir more-acculturated counterparts to have annual\nincomes of less than $20,000 and less likely to be\nhigh school graduates (Table 1). Less-acculturated\nindividuals were also less likely to have private health\ninsurance or a usual place for health care. There were\nno significant differences between the groups in terms\nof current smoking or BMI, but less-acculturated indi-\nviduals exercised much less during leisure time. When\nusing the 1994 ADA dietary guidelines, in bivariate\nanalyses, dietary fiber and cholesterol intakes were not\nsignificantly different between the groups, but less-\nacculturated individuals were significantly more likely\nto get fewer than 10% of their daily calories from\nsaturated fats. When using the 2006 ADA dietary\nguidelines, there still was no difference between\nthe more-acculturated and less-acculturated groups\nwith regard to dietary cholesterol intake; however,\nless-acculturated individuals were significantly more\nlikely to have diets high in fiber and low in saturated\nfat. This effect was also apparent for acculturation as\nassessed by country of birth.\nThe relationships between the lifestyle character-\nistics and socioeconomic measures are shown in Table\n2. The only significant differences were that compared\nwith individuals who had graduated from high school,\nthose who had not were less likely to exercise in their\nleisure time and more likely to have diets low in cho-\nlesterol and saturated fat.\nThe results of the logistic regression analyses\nindicated that when the SAS score was used as the\nindicator of acculturation, more-acculturated individu-\nals were no more or less likely than less-acculturated\nindividuals to be nonsmokers (odds ratio, 0.5; 95%\nsome leisure time exercise (odds ratio, 2.17; 95% CI,\nlines, more-acculturated individuals were significantly\nless likely to have diets low in saturated fats (Table 3).\nWhen using the 2006 ADA dietary guidelines, how-\never, they were significantly less likely to have diets\nboth high in fiber and low in saturated fat.\nWhen country of birth was used as the indicator\nof acculturation, the associations between accultura-\ntion and healthy lifestyle were not as strong (Table 4).\nAccording to the 2006 criteria, acculturation was only\nassociated with saturated fat intake, and that association\nindicated that individuals born outside the United States\nwere more likely to have a diet low in saturated fat.\nWe found no evidence of an interaction between any\nof the socioeconomic indicators (health insurance, pov-\nerty, and education) and the SAS score in the models.\nDISCUSSION\nThe results of this study suggest that although accul-\nturation of Latinos to the mainstream US culture may\nbe somewhat beneficial in terms of access to care\nand socioeconomic status, less-acculturated Latinos\nwith diabetes tend to have healthier diets than their\nmore-acculturated counterparts. Specifically, more-\nacculturated Latinos with diabetes were less likely to\nTable 1.

Delivery of cultur-\nally competent health care by professionals\nhas been discussed at length, but evidence\nsuggests that self-management of diabetes\nin modern US society may be difficult for\nLatino patients as they struggle to decide\nwhich traditional behaviors to retain and\nwhich new ones to adopt.28\nOur findings suggest that an under-\nstanding of the complexities in providing culturally\ncompetent care must include an understanding not\njust of where the patient is coming from culturally,\nbut where they are now. Having a medical home\nwith continuity of care may help to ensure that\nthe patient-physician relationship is intact and that\nthe physician can understand factors that may be\nchanging in the patient's ability to adhere to treat-\nment or lifestyle recommendations. Consequently,\nTable 2.

Relative Odds of Healthy Dietary Indicators\nfor Latino Individuals With Diabetes Having an SAS Score\nDietary Indicator\nOdds Ratio\n(95% Confidence Interval)a\nSAS = Short Acculturation Scale; ADA = American Diabetes Association.\na All models are adjusted for age-group, sex, family income, education level, health insurance,\nyears with diabetes, whether the individual had a routine place for health care, and whether the\nindividual had retinopathy, hypertension, and high cholesterol.\nan initial lack of health insurance or disruption of\nhealth insurance coverage is a big problem in socially\ndisadvantaged populations because of its impact on\nthis continuity and having a medical home, and cor-\nresponding delivery of quality care.30\nThere are several limitations to this study. First, the\ndata set is cross-sectional, which limits the ability to\nmake inferences about causality. The NHANES data\ndo, however, allow us to generate population estimates\nfor Latinos with diabetes in the US population. Second,\nwe used both a general measure of acculturation (being\nborn in the United States) and a standard scale that\nrepresents acculturation based on language (SAS score),\nand the latter was significantly associated with several\nindicators of healthy lifestyle. It is possible, however,\nthat because acculturation includes multiple factors\nregarding behaviors and beliefs, our measure was too\ncrude and simplistic to appropriately capture nuances\nof culture. Third, the question regarding physician-\ndiagnosed diabetes, which was the basis for including\nindividuals in the study, does not discriminate between\nindividuals told that they had type 1 diabetes and indi-\nviduals told that they had type 2 diabetes; however, the\nlifestyle questions we used are applicable to individu-\nals with either type of diabetes. Fourth, although the\nNHANES allowed us to look at the current behaviors\nand acculturation of Latinos generally, the survey ques-\ntions were limited regarding background characteristics\nof the subset of Latino immigrants. Consequently, we\nwere unable to investigate questions such as whether\nimmigrants from rural areas of Mexico differ in their\nbehaviors from those hailing from urban areas. Fifth,\nin the bivariate analyses, more-acculturated individuals\nwere more likely to engage in leisure time exercise than\ntheir less-acculturated counterparts. This finding does\nnot necessarily mean that less-acculturated individuals\ndo not engage in exercise, but rather that\nthey may not use their leisure time for\nexercise. Individuals working in more\nphysical and manual labor occupations\nmay seek out less vigorous leisure time\npursuits. For many, the importance of exer-\ncising after work may take a lower priority\nthan resting from a workday considerably\nlonger than 8 hours that involves physi-\ncal activity. Even though we could not\nmeasure exercise obtained during leisure\ntime vs on the job, once we controlled for\ndemographic characteristics, the relation-\nship between acculturation and leisure\ntime exercise was no longer significant.\nIn conclusion, the common assump-\ntion that ethnic minority populations\nwill always benefit from acculturation to\nmainstream US society does not appear to hold true\nin the case of healthy lifestyle behaviors among Lati-\nnos with diabetes. This study adds to other evidence\nthat aspects of acculturation may be maladaptive.19\nDietary habits of Latinos with diabetes who are less-\nacculturated to US society are healthier than those of\nLatinos who are more-acculturated. It is important to\nunderstand the complex process of acculturation as\nwe focus on developing culturally sensitive health care\nprograms, in order to encourage patients to maintain\nhealthy traditional behaviors while simultaneously\nadopting beneficial aspects of the mainstream culture.\nTo read or post commentaries in response to this article, see it\nonline at http://www.annfammed.org/cgi/content/full/6/2/131.\n",
