Blumberg\nDu r i n g m o s t o f t h e 19 90 s the\nUnited States enjoyed a thriving econ-\nomy marked by low unemployment\nand rising incomes. Despite strong economic\ngrowth, however, the share of Americans with\nhealth insurance has actually fallen: In 1994,\n82.7 percent of nonelderly persons had health\ninsurance, compared with 81.6 percent in\nhave coverage through their own employer or\nthrough the employer of a family member.2\nThus, changes in the U.S. workforce have po-\ntentially large consequences for workers' em-\nployer coverage and for health insurance cov-\nerage in general.\nMany factors affect the probability that a\nworker has employer coverage. For example,\nworkers in small firms, young workers, and\nlower-paid workers are all less likely to have\nit than are older, higher-paid workers in larger\nfirms.3 Lower employer coverage rates result\nfrom declines in offer and/or take-up rates.4\nWhile research shows that changes in the\nworkforce cannot explain all of the changes in\nemployer-sponsored coverage, we can antici-\npate how certain changes in the distribution\nof workers across jobs and in the demo-\ngraphic composition of the workforce may af-\nfect this coverage in the future.5\nOther factors--most notably, changes in\nthe level of health insurance premiums rela-\ntive to income and the share of premiums paid\ndirectly by workers--will also affect the\nprobability that employer coverage will be of-\nfered and taken up. Although we do not have\ndirect measures of either premiums or work-\ners' share of premiums, we do include vari-\nables for firm size and industry in our models;\nfirm size and industry are highly correlated\nwith variations in workers' premium shares.6\nAdditionally, future expansions or contrac-\ntions of eligibility for public programs may\nalso interact with the probability of having\nemployer coverage; these types of unforeseen\nchanges are not captured here.\nData And Definitions\nFor the bulk of our analyses, we use the Feb-\n(CWS) to the Census Bureau's Current Popu-\nlation Survey (CPS) merged with data from\nthe 1997 March CPS. The March survey adds\ninformation on workers' earnings and family in-\ncomes. Our sample, therefore, consists of those\nworkers who are included in both data sets.\ndata on a nationally representative sample of\nworkers and reports information on their em-\nployers' as well as on their own charac-\nteristics. Unlike the March files, these supple-\nments ask whether the respondent's employer\noffers health insurance and whether the\nworker is eligible for coverage in addition to\nthe type of coverage held. The supplement is\nthe source for the variables used in these\nanalyses to identify each worker's coverage.\n\u00a92001ProjectHOPE\u00adThePeople-to-PeopleHealth Foundation,Inc.\nGregory Acs and Linda Blumberg are senior research associates at the Urban Institute.\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : T R E N D S\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 2 0 , N u m b e r 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Note that our analysis excludes\nthe self-employed, all nonworking depend-\nents, and younger workers who may have cov-\nerage through their parents' policies.\nForecasting\nCoverage Rates\nemployer coverage in their\nof workers covered through\nspouses fell from 12 percent to\n11 percent. Thus, on net, cover-\n78.7 percent over the four-year\nn Forecast method. We\nuse a multivariate regressionframework to es-\ntimate the probability of insurance coverage\nfor all adult workers; we then use results from\na series of regressions to forecast coverage\nrates under a set of assumptions about the\nfuture composition of the workforce. This ap-\nproach allows us to control for changes in\nmultiple characteristics simultaneously. We\ntake into account the probability of offer and\ntake-up of coverage from one's own employer\nand through a spouse's employer (if any).\nEstimating themultivariatemodel. We estimate\nthe likelihood of offer and take-up on using\nlinear probability models. Offer and take-up\nmodels are estimated separately for workers\nwho are married to other workers (dual earn-\ners) and for workers who are single or have\nnonworking spouses (single earners). We\ntake this approach because the decision to\ntake a job in a firm is strongly related to the\noffer status of spousal coverage. Likewise, the\npropensity to take up insurance may be af-\nfected by the options available to the worker\nthrough the spouse's employer.\nOur models consist of six estimated equa-\ntions, which are described in detail else-\nwhere.9 Briefly, we estimate (1) the prob-\nability of a worker's being offered coverage by\nhis orher own employer (estimatedseparately\nfor single earners and dual earners); (2) the\nprobability of a worker's taking up his or her\nown employer's coverage given the existence\nof an offer (estimated separately for single\nearners and dual earners); (3) the probability\nthat a worker's spouse is of-\nfered coverage, given that the\nworker does not have his or\nher own coverage and is a dual\nearner; and (4) the probability\nthat a worker is covered by his\nor her spouse's employer cov-\nerage, given that the worker\ndoes not have coverage\nthrough his or her own em-\nployer and has a working\nspouse with a coverage offer.\nTotal employer coverage for\nworkers, then, is a weighted\naverage of the coverage rates of\nworkers in dual-earner and single-earner\nfamilies. The rate of own-employer coverage\nis simply a product of offer and take-up, while\nspousal coverage must take the spousal offer\nand take-up into account as well as the prob-\nability that the worker does not have an offer\nof coverage from his or her own employer.\nOur equations include both firm- and\nworker-specific information. This includes\nthe worker's occupation, sex, race/ethnicity,\nage, marital status, education, wage rate, in-\ncome relative to the poverty line (in the case of\ntake-up), region of residence, job tenure (in\nthe case of offer), and part-time status, as well\nas employer's industry and firm size.\nTo test the predictive accuracy of our\nmodel, we used our estimated equations to\ngenerate a \"backcast\" of coverage for workers\nyielded a predicted coverage rate within 0.2\nProjecting workforce characteristics.

The first uses\ninformation from the U.S. Bureau of Labor\nStatistics (BLS).

Consequently, we developed alterna-\ntive predictions that allow us to generate in-\ndependent projections for single earners, dual\nearners, and dual earners without coverage\nfrom their own employer. This model must\nrely solely on CPS data because, not surpris-\ningly, the BLS does not provide projections for\nthe industries and occupations of each unique\nset of workers. We assume that the CPS\nn Results.Our first model, using the com-\nbination of BLS, CPS, and SIPP trends, indi-\ncates that anticipated changes in the compo-\nsition of the workforce, on net, will drive\ndown workers' employer-sponsored coverage\n2008. This translates into a coverage decline\nof 1.3 million workers relative to coverage\nrates' staying constant.14 Exhibit 1 reveals the\npatterns underlying this modest forecast de-\ncline. The model predicts that coverage\nthrough a worker's own employer will fall for\nworkers in both single- and dual-earner\nhouseholds and that coverage through a\nspouse's plan will also fall. We forecast that\nboth the offer rate and the take-up rate will\ndecline among workers in single- and dual-\nearner households; however, the offer rate ef-\nfect is considerably stronger. Coverage\nthrough a spouse is predicted to fall by the\nsmallest percentage, with all of the effect com-\ning through a decline in the offer rate.\nUnder our alternative forecast (Model 2),\nwhich relies upon subgroup-specific trends\nfrom the CPS, coverage will fall 6.1 percentage\ninto a coverage decline of 6.9 million workers.\nOwn-employer coverage rates are predicted\nto fall considerably more than the coverage\nrate through a spouse. While offer-rate effects\ndominate take-up effects for drops in own-\nemployer coverage, the drop in the take-up\nrate dominates for spousal coverage.\nExhibit 2 allows us to see which socio-\ndemographic and workforce characteristics\ncontribute the most to the predicted changes\nin coverage under each model.15 For the first\nmodel, the largest absolute effects come from\nwork status and wages, both tending to de-\ncrease coverage over time. The number of\npart-time workers is predicted to increase be-\ncoverage rates. Changes in the wage distribu-\ntion are predicted to lead to more higher- and\nlower-wage earners (below $7.50 and above\nshare of the workforce falling in the middle of\nthe distribution. The change with the largest\npositive effect is an increase in education.\nAlso, a positive coverage effect comes from the\npredicted increase in dual-earning couples.\nFor the second model, we can see that the\nsingle largest effect by far is the negative im-\npact of the predicted increase in the share of\nthe workforce that is employed part time. As\nnoted previously, the implied CPS trend is so\nlarge that we replaced it with the SIPP trend\nin the first model.

On net, our forecasts sug-\ngest that changes in the composition of the\nworkforce are likely to lead to lower employer\nanticipate that the overall decline in coverage\nresulting from changes in the composition of\nthe workforce will be relatively small.\nOur models indicate that both offer and\ntake-up rates of employer coverage will tend\nto decline in the coming years, with the per-\ncentage-point declines in offer rates tending\nto be the larger factor. The single most impor-\ntant detrimental trend affecting offer and\ntake-up is the rising share of part-time work-\ners in the labor force. Part-time workers are\nfar less likely than full-time workers are to be\noffered employer coverage, and their often\nmodest incomes make the employee share of\nany offered coverage less affordable.\nTaking these conclusions into account, a\nnumber of public policy approaches may be\nconsidered. Financial incentives could be pro-\nvided to encourage more employers to offer\ncoverage. However, the effects of such an ap-\nproach are likely to be uneven, leaving many\nwithout a viable source of coverage. Tighten-\ning Employee Retirement Income Security\nAct (ERISA) regulations regarding which\nworkers must be offered benefits may well\nbolster the situation of part-time workers in\nthe employer coverage system.\nStates and the federal government also\nmight consider developing alternative stable\nand comprehensive sources of coverage for\nworkers and their dependents. Permitting\nbuy-ins to Medicaid and/or the State Chil-\ndren's   Program (SCHIP) is\none option. Another possibility is the devel-\nopment of organized purchasing entities for\nthose in the nongroup private insurance mar-\nket, coupled with reform of the insurance\nregulations in this market. Such efforts would\nbe directed toward making the nongroup\nmarket easier to navigate and better able to\nserve those with higher-than-average health\nrisk, and providing individuals with the bene-\nfits of administrative economies of scale and\npurchasing power.\nPublic policies focusing on the affordabil-\nity of the employee share of employer cover-\nage premiums may be able to counteract the\npredicted decline in take-up. This might re-\nquire subsidies to low- and moderate-income\nworkers for this purpose. The political diffi-\nculty with such an approach is the trade-off\nbetween policies that provide subsidy dollars\nto those who probably would have taken up\ncoverage without the subsidy and policies\nthat exclude those with prior coverage while\nsubsidizing others with the same incomes.\nPublic costs will be lower under the latter ap-\nproach, while the new coverage effect will, in\nall likelihood, be significantly larger under the\nformer. Finally, a much more limited and low-\ncost approach to expanding employer cover-\nage involves public information campaigns.\nThese campaigns could target growing sub-\npopulations, such as Hispanics, who tend to\nhave lower take-up rates.\nWhile our forecast declines\nover an eleven-year period are not\nalarming in and ofthemselves, it is\nimportant to keep in mind that they assume\nthat the probability of coverage for any given\nsubgroup remains at its 1997 level. However, if\nhealth insurance premiums begin to rise dra-\nmatically, as they did during the early 1990s,\nthe probabilities that a specific worker will be\noffered coverage and will take up benefits are\nboth likely to decline. Similarly, if unemploy-\nment rises, firms may not feel a need to offer\nhealth insurance to attract workers. If em-\nployer coverage among workers falls substan-\ntially, coverage of dependents is also likely to\nfall, and current public health insurance pro-\ngrams will be unable to fully compensate.\nThis research was funded by a grant from the Com-\nmonwealth Fund.
