Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, with\nadjustment for age, sex, education, and smoking and mutual adjustment for family composition (sibship size and/\nor birth order). Tooth loss and periodontal disease affected 8% and 19% of the twins, respectively. Each\nadditional sibling increased the odds of tooth loss by 10% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06, 1.15) and the odds\nof periodontal disease by 5% (95% CI: 1.02, 1.08). Later birth order was associated with lower odds of periodontal\ndisease.

Oral bacteria stimulate host inflammation as\npart of the healing process. However, perturbation of host\ndefense mechanisms can result in the destruction of bone and\nconnective tissue that support teeth, leading to tooth\nmobility, pain, and ultimately tooth loss. Periodontal disease\nrepresents an important public health burden among adults in\nEurope and the United States, with more than 15 percent\nhaving a severe form of the disease (1, 2). Given its possible\nassociation with severe systemic conditions such as cardio-\nvascular disease, periodontal status may itself be a risk factor\nfor mortality (3).\nBirth order and sibship size have consistently been associ-\nated with other diseases hypothesized to have an infectious\netiology, including peptic ulcer (4), allergies and asthma (5),\nand certain cancers (6, 7). Birth order may dictate the age of\nexposure to common childhood infections, under the\nassumption that firstborn children are not exposed until they\nenter school, while later-born children are exposed at an\nearlier age through their older siblings (8, 9).

Greater sibship size is associated\nwith a greater probability of exposure to infectious agents\nand thus generally increases risk of disease later in life. For\nbirth order, however, the direction of the effect is dependent\non the infectious agent and its relation to clinical disease. For\nexample, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus earlier in life is\nhypothesized to reduce the risk of Hodgkin's disease (8),\nwhereas exposure to hepatitis B virus at an earlier age\nappears to increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (6).\nPerson-to-person transmission of periodontal pathogens\noccurs via saliva, and increased frequency of exposure to\ninfectious saliva increases the likelihood of bacterial coloni-\nzation (10). Periodontal pathogens can be transmitted among\nfamily members (10), and familial transmission may be a\nrisk factor for progression to periodontal disease (11). In\naddition, the bacteria involved in the pathogenesis of oral\ndiseases are often colonized and already established in child-\nhood, although risk of colonization appears to be higher\namong children not exposed to bacteria until later in child-\nhood (12, 13). Once colonization occurs, the bacteria remain\npresent and thus may determine a person's future periodontal\nOn the basis of these previous studies, we would hypothe-\nsize that larger sibship size, by increasing the probability of\nexposure, and earlier birth order, by delaying age at expo-\nsure, would increase the risk of periodontal disease and tooth\nloss. Housing density might influence the timing of expo-\nsure, through greater person-to-person contact with parents\nor other family members as an infant, or may reflect lower\nsocioeconomic status during childhood and thus less access\nto dental treatment. To our knowledge, no previous study has\ntested these hypotheses. To this end, we examined the asso-\nciations between birth order, sibship size, and housing\ndensity and risk of tooth loss and periodontal disease in a\npopulation-based cohort of Swedish adults.\nStudy population\nThe data for the present investigation were obtained from\nthe Swedish Twin Registry (14, 15). The Swedish Twin\nRegistry is currently the largest population-based twin\nregistry in the world, with entries on more than 70,000 twin\npairs born in Sweden since 1886. The Registry was assem-\nbeen prospectively followed through postal questionnaires,\ntelephone interviews, and in-person screenings. Between\ninvited to participate in Screening Across the Lifespan of\nTwins (SALT), a computer-assisted telephone interview\neliciting information on health outcomes, risk factors,\npreventive behaviors, and familial and demographic factors.\nTwins were interviewed regardless of the vital status or\nparticipation of their co-twin. The SALT study was\napproved by the institutional review board of the Karolinska\nInstitutet, and the twins provided oral consent to participate\nin the study.\nSALT screening. To reduce the length of the interview,\nquestions on selected topics were limited to a subsample of\nthe cohort during the latter 2 years. Questions on oral health\nwere asked of all twins interviewed through 2000 but were\n2002. It is unlikely that this would have led to any bias, since\ntwins were selected randomly each month for participation.\nThus, information on dental health was available from\nStudy variables\nThe principal exposure variables were birth order, sibship\nsize, and childhood housing density. Each twin reported the\nnumber of liveborn siblings in his or her family and the order\nof his or her birth with respect to other siblings. Sibship size\nwas defined as the total number of siblings plus the two\ntwins. Data on housing density were available for the 456\nSALT twins who had previously participated in the Swedish\nAdoption/Twin Study of Aging (16). Briefly, twin pairs\nreared apart and matched control twin pairs reared together\nwere part of this longitudinal study of aging. Twins in the\nSwedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging reported the\nnumber of rooms in their childhood home and the number of\npersons who had shared that home. An index of housing\ndensity was created by dividing the number of individuals by\nthe number of rooms.\nOral health status was based on self-reported information\nfrom the SALT screening. All twins were asked, \"Do you\nhave your own teeth?\". Tooth loss was defined as not having\nany of one's own teeth. Participants who were not edentu-\nlous were also asked, \"Have you been diagnosed by a dentist\nas having loose teeth or periodontal disease?\" and \"Do you\nhave or have you ever had any teeth which are loose or move\naround?\". Participants who responded that a dentist had told\nthem they had periodontal disease or who reported that they\nhad ever had tooth mobility were defined as having peri-\nodontal disease.\nStatistical analysis\nLogistic regression analyses were used to assess the roles\nof sibship size, birth order, and housing density in risk of\ntooth loss and periodontal disease, controlling for potential\nconfounders. Covariates that changed the odds ratio for the\nmain effect by more than 10 percent or that were significant\nat  = 0.20 and that were not on the causal pathway were\nkept in the final model (17). We evaluated the linearity of\nvariables for sibship size, birth order, housing density, and\nage on the log scale to determine whether the relations\nfollowed linear trends. Higher-order terms for continuous\nvariables were also explored.\nAll analyses were conducted using the GENMOD proce-\ndure in SAS (version 8.2; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North\nCarolina). Because of potential cluster-correlation within\ntwin pairs, confidence intervals calculated under the assump-\ntion of independence may be biased (usually too narrow).\nThus, we adapted the alternating logistic regression model\nproposed by Carey et al. (18) to account for the correlated\ndata of twin pairs. We further allowed for twin pair correla-\nRelation of Family Characteristics to Periodontal Disease 501\ntions for the outcome to vary for monozygotic and dizygotic\ntwins (the relevant SAS code is presented in the Appendix).\nOdds ratios and 95 percent confidence intervals were calcu-\nlated. The results of trend tests are also presented. Results\nwere adjusted for age (continuous variable), age squared,\nsex, education (categorical--university, gymnasium, mili-\ntary/vocational, compulsory, elementary, other), and\nsmoking status (categorical--current daily smoker, current\nnondaily smoker, former daily smoker, former nondaily\nsmoker, never smoker) and were mutually adjusted for\nsibship size and/or birth order.\nRESULTS\nInformation on tooth loss and periodontal disease was\nanalyzed for 28,690 participants. In this population-based\nsample of Swedish adults aged 42 years or more, the cumula-\ntive risk of tooth loss was 8 percent and the lifetime preva-\nlence of periodontal disease was 19 percent (table 1). Almost\n15 percent of the twins had a sibship size of seven or more,\nand 60 percent had been born first or second among their\nsiblings. In the subsample of 456 twins who also participated\nin the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging, 38 percent\ngrew up in a household with a density of two or more people\nper room.\nThe likelihood of tooth loss and periodontal disease\naccording to characteristics of the study population is\npresented in table 2. Tooth loss and periodontal disease were\nmore common among those with larger sibship sizes and\nthose born later with respect to other siblings in the family.\nTwins living in the most crowded homes during childhood\nwere more likely to have complete tooth loss. In contrast,\nperiodontal disease was higher for those who had lived in a\nhome with less than one person per room during childhood.\nCrude and adjusted odds ratios for tooth loss and peri-\nodontal disease by sibship size are presented in table 3. After\nadjustment for age, sex, education, and smoking, sibship size\nwas positively associated with both tooth loss and peri-\nodontal disease. Further adjustment for birth order did not\nsubstantially change the odds ratios. For each additional\nsibling in the family, the odds of tooth loss increased 10\nRespondents with eight or more siblings in the family had\n1.8 times' greater odds of tooth loss than those with two\nsiblings.

Our findings will help\nin developing an infectious model for understanding these\noral diseases. Sibship size was positively related to peri-\nodontal disease, suggesting that the risk is increased with\nincreasing probability of exposure to infectious agents\nduring childhood. The inverse association with birth order\nand periodontal disease suggests that earlier exposure to\ninfectious agents is protective against disease in adulthood.\nWe found no evidence of an association between birth\norder and tooth loss. In addition to periodontal disease,\nhowever, dental caries is an important contributor to tooth\nloss. Two earlier epidemiologic studies, without controlling\nfor confounding, examined the effect of birth order on dental\ncaries. Zadik (19) observed that the prevalence of caries\namong children was lower among those with an earlier birth\norder, while Mansbridge (20) noted the opposite. The lack of\nan association with respect to birth order and tooth loss may\nhighlight the complexity of oral pathogen immunity\ninvolved in this condition. A positive effect of sibship size\non dental caries in children has been consistently noted (19\u00ad\n22). In line with the data on periodontal disease, this obser-\nvation is consistent with the higher risk of tooth loss noted\nwith larger sibship size.\nInformation on housing density in childhood provided\nadditional evidence for a role of transmission during child-\nhood. The number of people per room in the childhood home\nwas positively associated with risk of tooth loss but nega-\ntively associated with periodontal disease. These opposing\neffects of household crowding are intriguing, and we can\nonly hypothesize a possible mechanism. Tooth loss is the\nultimate outcome of untreated oral disease, particularly peri-\nodontal disease and dental caries. Thus, risk factors for tooth\nloss will reflect both the infectious mechanisms of oral\ndisease and predictors of a lack of access to dental treatment.\nHousing density might influence the timing of exposure,\nthrough greater person-to-person contact with parents or\nother family members as an infant. In addition, a more\ncrowded home may reflect lower socioeconomic status\nduring childhood and less access to dental treatment. Thus,\nthe inverse association between household crowding and\nperiodontal disease may be indicative of the infectious\ndisease process. Whether or not a person receives treatment\nfor oral disease during childhood will predict tooth loss\nTABLE 4.

Indeed, genotyping of Streptococcus mutans, a\nbacterium causing dental caries, suggests direct transmission\nof the bacterium within families (24). One interpretation of\nour study, in light of these data, is that sibship size is a proxy\nfor the probability of exposure to oral infection during child-\nhood.\nOne of the responsible bacteria in the pathogenesis of peri-\nodontal disease, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,\nappears to be resistant to colonization among infants and\ntoddlers but can become established in the oral cavity when\nchildren are first exposed at 5\u00ad7 years of age (12, 13). Peri-\nodontal bacteria remain present long after colonization\noccurs, and they may become active during transient bacter-\nemia (10). Age at initial exposure is a major determinant of\nthe outcome of infection, that is, immunity versus clinical\ndisease. For many infections, early exposure is associated\nwith durable immunity, whereas delayed exposure results in\na higher ratio of clinical disease to immunity (8). Our data on\nan association between birth order and periodontal status\nprovide supportive evidence that this is true. The observed\nreduction in periodontal disease risk may be a function of\nexposure to maternal antibodies, priming and maturation of\nthe immune system during early life (25), or earlier develop-\nment of herd immunity (26).\nOur study had a number of strengths and limitations to\nconsider. We took a retrospective approach to assessing the\nimpact of exposure to childhood infection on oral disease\nrisk in adult life using existing resources. The Swedish Twin\nRegistry is population-based, and participation in the follow-\nup study was high (~75 percent). Thus, selection bias is\nlikely to have been minimal. Given the sample size, we had\nsubstantial statistical power to detect an effect of birth order\nand sibship size. Although the number of persons who\nprovided information on housing density was lower, power\ncalculations conducted after the fact suggested that we had\n98 percent power to detect an odds ratio of 0.33 for the\nhighest group versus the lowest.\nThe SALT interview collected extensive data on covari-\nates, and we adjusted for the major risk factors for these\nconditions. It is possible that residual confounding may\nexist. Given the strength of the association between cigarette\nsmoking and periodontal health, we systematically evaluated\npossible residual confounding due to smoking. In analyses\nrestricted to never smokers, the odds ratios were similar to\nthose obtained for all participants, providing evidence of no\nresidual confounding by smoking.\nThe data collected through SALT were based on self-\nreport and may have been subject to a degree of misclassifi-\ncation. For birth order and sibship size, we assessed the\npercentage of agreement between twins. We found that 76\npercent of twins were concordant for sibship size, and 96\npercent gave a sibship size plus or minus one sibling. For\nbirth order, twins were 86 percent concordant, and 98\npercent gave a birth order plus or minus one order. The fact\nthat some twins were off by one sibling or one birth order\nmay reflect some respondents' interpretation of the question\nand the fact that they were twins. For example, some twins\nwho were asked about the number of siblings may or may\nnot have included themselves. The extent of exposure\nmisclassification was fairly minimal and therefore should\nnot have distorted the findings.\nFIGURE 1.

Odds ratios were adjusted for\nage (continuous variable), age squared, sex, education (categorical--\nuniversity, gymnasium, compulsory/elementary, military/vocational,\nother), smoking status (current, former, never), birth order, and sib-\nship size. CI, confidence interval.\nRelation of Family Characteristics to Periodontal Disease 505\nThe validity of self-reported information on periodontal\nmeasures has created considerable debate among oral health\nprofessionals, though few studies have directly examined\nthis issue. Self-reported tooth loss appears to have good\nvalidity compared with clinical assessment in community-\nbased samples (27). Among health professionals, the validity\nof self-reporting for periodontal disease is high, particularly\namong those with severe disease (28). The applicability of\nthese findings is potentially limited, given the health aware-\nness of this population. In one study of a community sample\nof Swedish adults, agreement between self-reported assess-\nment of periodontal pockets and clinical examination was\nrelatively high (29), while the correlation between tooth\nmobility and clinical examination was lower. Since the\nsurvey questions differed from those in SALT, we cannot\ndirectly extrapolate those results to the present study. Within\nour own data, we find supportive evidence for minimal\nmisclassification of data on the oral health measures. First,\ntooth loss and periodontal disease in this study were associ-\nated with their established risk factors, that is, smoking, age,\nand education. Second, reliability data from a small sample\nof twins who were recontacted 2 weeks after the initial\nSALT interview suggested that there was excellent reli-\nability for both tooth loss ( = 86.5 percent) and periodontal\ndisease ( = 89.0 percent). If there was misclassification of\ndisease, it is unlikely to have been related to family charac-\nteristics and thus would have been nondifferential. In\ngeneral, this would have tended to bias estimates toward the\nnull. Thus, if anything, our findings would have underesti-\nmated the true associations.\nIn this study, we used birth order, sibship size, and housing\ndensity as proxy measures. Given the length of time between\nexposure during childhood and onset of adult oral diseases, it\nis difficult to study early-life exposures by other means.\nAlthough the association between family characteristics and\nperiodontal health is consistent with a role of childhood\ninfection, these proxy measures may be indicative of some\nother underlying process occurring during childhood. For\nexample, sibship size may be indicative of other family\neffects, such as influences on oral hygiene and dental habits\nlater in life, or it could indicate a lower level of access to\nhealth services earlier in life. Notwithstanding this limita-\ntion, the data support a role of early familial environment in\nthe risk of periodontal disease and edentulism occurring in\nadulthood.\nGiven the disease burden caused by periodontal disease\nand tooth loss, it is important both to understand the etiology\nof the disease and to design public health interventions for\nprevention. This study may have potential use from both\nperspectives, by identifying possible windows of opportu-\nnity during childhood to reduce transmission of oral patho-\ngens and by contributing information to the infectious\ndisease model of oral health.\n"
