Throughout the paper, we use the term \"cognitive skills\" as opposed to intelligence or IQ because\nthe latter connotes a more genetic interpretation than we think is warranted. In our view, intelli-\ngence or standardized tests, including the composite math and reading score analyzed below, reflect\nboth academic skills/achievement and innate ability. This is consistent with Jencks and Phillips\n(1998) interpretation of test scores as indicating \"developed abilities\" rather than innate abilities.\nconclude that the relationship is as substantively important as the associations\nbetween delinquency, social class, and race. Numerous studies since confirm\nthat cognitive skills and delinquency are intertwined (Denno, 1989; Gordon,\nHerrnstein, 1985), although the mechanism by which it influences delinquency\nand its effect size relative to \"social\" risk factors remain matters of debate\nResearch examining the cognitive skills and delinquency relation most\nfrequently emphasizes individual rather than structural processes. This is\nperhaps most telling in works such as The Bell Curve, in which Herrnstein and\nMurray (1994) argue that \"genetic endowment\" is the root cause of social\nproblems ranging from low earnings to criminal involvement (see also Wilson\n& Herrnstein, 1985). They propose several intervening mechanisms by which\nlow intelligence quotient (IQ) may increase criminal involvement including\nfailure and lack of attachment to school, preference for risk, diminished\nsensitivity to victim's pain, and inability to comprehend right from wrong.\nThat work led to important rebuttals from scholars that emphasize social-\nstructural approaches to group outcomes (e.g., Cullen, Gendreau, Jarjoura, &\nStructural theories stress variation in family structure and socioeconomic\nstatus (SES), associations with delinquent peers, attachment to conventional\ninstitutions, and neighborhood disadvantage--each of which may mediate or\nmoderate the relationship between cognitive skills and delinquency (see\nDespite increasing scholarly investigation of \"neighborhood effects,\" the role\nof neighborhood context is overlooked in most research examining the cognitive\nskills\u00addelinquency relationship (but see Bellair & McNulty, 2005; Sampson,\nMorenoff, & Raudenbush, 2005). In particular, we are not aware of any studies\nthat document how the relationship changes at varying levels of neighborhood\ndisadvantage. Yet, the issue has important implications. From an empirical\nstandpoint, models that do not consider neighborhood context may over- or\nunder-estimate the effect of cognitive skills depending on the distribution of\nsubjects across levels of disadvantage in a particular sample. The repercussion\nfor theory is continued reliance on unsophisticated or inaccurate interpretations\nof the impact of cognitive skill.\nThere are differing mechanisms by which neighborhood context may pattern\nthe cognitive skills\u00addelinquency relationship. Perhaps most well known is the\ncumulative continuity thesis, which suggests that delinquency is most likely\nwhen multiple risk factors converge and compound over time (see Moffitt, 1993;\nSampson & Laub, 1993). Those theories were not designed specifically to\naddress the issues pursued here, but the logic of cumulative disadvantage\nsuggests that the impact of low cognitive skill will likely be amplified for adoles-\ncents residing in disadvantaged environments. The cumulative disadvantage\nhypothesis anticipates a negative interaction effect between cognitive skill and\nneighborhood disadvantage.\nAlternatively, literature on trait\u00adenvironment interaction suggests that every\nchild has a genetic potential (innate mental ability) for cognitive development,\nbut the chances of realizing that potential are conditioned by features of the\nenvironment (Guo & Stearns, 2002). Children growing up in disadvantaged envi-\nronments may encounter pervasive social constraints that hamper mobility\n(Kotlowitz, 1991), and therefore may be less likely to realize their potential.\nEvidence that poor learning environments suppress genetic potential for intel-\nlectual development implies that cognitive skills, which are partially influenced\nby genetic endowment, will be constrained in their social expression and less\nlikely to influence delinquency in disadvantaged contexts. The prediction is\nconsistent with Raine's (2000) \"social push\" hypothesis, and with some perspec-\ntives on human development which also expect individual-difference variables\nto differentially impact developmental outcomes at varying levels of neighbor-\nMagnusson, 1988). These perspectives imply a positive interaction effect\nbetween cognitive skill and neighborhood disadvantage.\nIn the present study, we address these contrasting approaches to the condi-\ntional effect of cognitive skills with a sample of adolescents drawn from the\nfirst five waves of the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97),\nmatched with block-group data from the 2000 US Census. The dependent vari-\nable is the frequency of violent attacks,2 which is examined in a three-level\nhierarchical model with repeated observations of violence involvement across\nfive waves (Level 1) nested within persons (Level 2) and neighborhoods (Level\n3). Cognitive skill is measured using the reading and math percentile score\nderived from administration of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery\n(ASVAB), a measure that is very similar to the Armed Forces Qualification Test\n(AFQT) measure available in other NLSY datasets and utilized extensively by\nHerrnstein and Murray (1994).3 In contrast to the genetic interpretation,\nhowever, we follow Jencks and Phillips (1998) \"and almost all psychologists\n[whom] now agree that intelligence tests measure developed rather than innate\nabilities, and that people's developed abilities depend on their environment as\nwell as their genes\" (p. 13). In the sections that follow, we more thoroughly\nsituate the analysis in the respective literatures.\n2. Previous research often examines cognitive skills in relation to a general delinquency outcome\nrather than a measure focused solely on violence, although some research focuses exclusively on\nviolence. Most studies that employ a delinquency outcome include violence items in the scale. We\nfocus on violence because it is widely considered to be more socially and economically problematic\n(see Wolfgang, Figlio, Tracy, & Singer, 1985) than many of the less serious property or drug use items\nthat are often included in delinquency scales.\n3. For a detailed description of the ASVAB administration in NLSY97, see Appendix 10 of the NLSY97\ncodebook supplement.\nCognitive Skills and Violence in Neighborhood Context\nDisadvantage Intensifies the Effect of Cognitive Skill on Violence\nNeighborhood effects literature indicates that cognitive skills including IQ,\nacademic achievement, and years of schooling are influenced by neighborhood\ncontexts (Brooks-Gunn, Duncun, & Aber, 1997), and that this influence persists\nafter controlling for individual-level SES (Leventhal & Brooks-Gunn, 2000).\nCriminological literature indicates further that neighborhood disadvantage is\npositively associated with individual-level delinquency and violence (see Elliot\n2000). Yet, despite theoretical justification, it remains unclear whether the\ncognitive skills\u00adviolence relationship varies as a function of neighborhood\ncontext.\nThe cumulative disadvantage hypothesis can be traced at least to Merton's\n(1973, p. 445) description of the \"Mathew effect,\" which proposes that the\nproblems of disadvantaged individuals are likely to multiply while social\nadvantage flows towards the already advantaged (Hannon, 2003). The theme\nis influential in the criminological literature, although adapted to address\nvarying issues. Moffitt's (1993) theory of life course persistent (LCP) offend-\ners, for instance posits that the affect of neuropsychological deficits such as\nlow IQ are compounded by negative interaction in social environments.\nChildren with cognitive deficits, for example, may evoke dysfunctional reac-\ntions from parents, especially under conditions of family adversity, including\ninconsistent discipline, frustration, and withdrawal in parent\u00adchild interac-\ntions. Moffitt's focus is on inadequate family environments, but the logic can\nbe extended to neighborhoods. Sampson and Laub (1993) emphasize that\nstructural disadvantage and individual differences increase violence by weak-\nening parental and school social controls and by intensifying the impact of\nlabeling processes.\nSupport for the cumulative disadvantage hypothesis is evident in several\nstudies. Lynam et al. (2000) provide direct evidence in their analysis of the\nPittsburgh Youth Study. They examined the conditional effect of impulsivity\non delinquency across varying levels of neighborhood disadvantage and found\nthat impulsivity had its strongest effect on violence in the most disadvan-\ntaged contexts. Their interpretation draws from prior research on the rela-\ntion between disadvantage and diminished collective efficacy (Sampson,\nRaudenbush, & Earls, 1997). They theorized that \"external controls ... may be\nespecially missed by youth who have fewer internal controls\" (p. 571). Indi-\nrect evidence is provided in adoption studies, which show that children at\nrisk for crime (by virtue of having criminal biological parents) are more likely\nto commit crime if they are reared in a \"criminogenic\" environment\nTheoretically, neighborhood disadvantage is associated with reduced institu-\ntional resources (Leventhal & Brooks-Gunn, 2000, p. 322), such as the \"availability,\naccessibility, affordability, and quality of ... learning, recreational, and social\nactivities; child care; schools; medical facilities; and employment opportunities.\"\nParticularly consequential are learning activities such as \"libraries, family\nresource centers, literacy programs, and museums,\" the absence of which \"may\ninfluence children's development, especially school readiness and achievement\noutcomes\" (p. 322). As a result of blighted institutional environments, adolescents\npossessing diminished cognitive skills may become more frustrated in school and\nhence develop weaker attachment and commitment (Hirschi, 1969) than might\nbe the case in a resource rich community. If the effect of low cognitive skill is\nintensified in disadvantaged environments, then a negative interaction effect in\nwhich cognitive skills are more strongly related to violent behavior in poor\nneighborhoods is expected.\nDisadvantage Weakens the Effect of Cognitive Skill on Violence\nAlternative conceptions also suggest the relevance for violence of an interaction\nbetween cognitive skill and neighborhood disadvantage although the nature of\nthe effect differs from the previous discussion. The behavioral genetics\napproach (Guo & Stearns, 2002) argues that every child has a genetic potential\nfor intellectual development, but the extent to which that potential is realized\ndepends on nurturance in the social environment. A child growing up in a poor,\ninner city area will therefore have more difficulty translating his or her cogni-\ntive skill into social mobility than a child of equal potential in an affluent\ncontext.\nIn a context of high disadvantage, the influence of predisposition and\nachievement on violence is diminished because poor learning environments\nsuppress the potential for cognitive development, even among those with\nheightened cognitive skill. In a poor learning environment, cognitive skill is\nlikely to be supplanted by the influence of the social environment. Some\nresearch supports this hypothesis. Guo and Stearns (2002), using sibling and\ntwin data, find that parental unemployment and African American status asso-\nciate with a lower contribution of \"heritability\" and a higher contribution of\nthe social environment to intellectual development. The results are therefore\nconsistent with the notion that disadvantaged environments suppress the\ninfluence of predispositions and increase the relative importance of shared\nHaley, Waldron, D'Onofrio, and Gottesman (2003) examined scores on the\nWechsler Intelligence Scale for a sample of seven-years-old twins from the\nNational Collaborative Perinatal data. Results indicate that in impoverished\nfamilies, the shared environment accounts for 60% of the variance in IQ\nwhereas genes account for nearly zero. The opposite is found among affluent\nfamilies--the shared environment accounts for almost none of the variance in\nIQ whereas genes account for nearly 60%.\nThese findings are consistent with Raine's (2000) \"social push\" hypothe-\nsis. Specifically, when risk factors (e.g., high poverty, broken homes) that\n\"push\" children into antisocial behavior are not present in the environ-\nment, biological factors may be more relevant in explaining behavioral\nRaine (2000) posits that in relatively benign social settings (e.g., high social\nclasses, intact homes), the link between biological risk factors and antiso-\ncial behavior will be stronger because the distractions created by social\ninfluences are minimized. In contrast, in disadvantaged social settings with\nstrong pressures toward anti-social behavior \"the link between antisocial\nbehavior and biological risk factors will be weaker ... because the social\ncauses of crime camouflage the biological contribution\" (Raine, 2000,\nAn interactional perspective on human development also suggests that the\neffect of an individual-difference variable on developmental outcomes may\nson, 1988). A key prediction derives from the socio-psychological distinction\nbetween weak versus strong situations (Mischel, 1977). \"Weak situations refer\nto relatively ambiguous social settings that fail to provide individuals with\nexplicit behavioral norms and scripts .... Individual differences are expected to\nshape people's behavior in weak situations because no particular response is\ndictated by the circumstances\" (Lynam et al., 2000, p. 564). Strong situations\nrefer to social settings in which there are strong pressures for behavioral unifor-\nmity, and are therefore expected to minimize the relevance of person-level\nvariables. Poor neighborhoods have been conceived of as strong situations that\npressure individuals to behave in antisocial ways. Anderson (1999), for exam-\nple, describes the manner in which youth are socialized to the street culture in\nimpoverished communities. If poor neighborhoods constitute strong situations,\n\"person variables are expected to make little contribution to offending in these\ncontexts but to make strong contributions in the better-off neighborhoods,\nwhich are unlikely to exert strong pressure for antisocial behavior\" (Lynam\nThe arguments reviewed above suggest alternative hypotheses that predict\na cross-level interaction effect between neighborhood characteristics and\ncognitive skill on violence. The idea that person-level characteristics and\nenvironmental risks accumulate and intensify children's vulnerability leads to\nthe hypothesis that cognitive skill has stronger effects on violence in poor\nneighborhoods than in better-off neighborhoods. Based on theorizing about\nthe role of genetic predisposition under differing social conditions (Guo &\nand the social push hypothesis (Raine, 2000), one would expect to observe\ninteraction effects in which cognitive skill has stronger effects on violence in\nbetter-off neighborhoods and weaker effects in poor neighborhoods.\nData and Methods\nSample\nThe data are drawn from the first five waves of the NLSY97. This is a house-\nhold based, nationally representative sample of adolescents between the ages\nof 12 and 16 at the time of first interview and who have been interviewed\nyearly since 1997. In the first stage, 100 primary sampling units (PSU)\ncontained in the National Opinion Research Center's (NORC) 1990 national\nsampling frame were randomly selected proportionate to size. Segments of\nadjoining blocks with at least 75 housing units were selected from each PSU,\nand households were randomly selected from a list of housing units in each\nsegment. Screening interviews in each household resulted in 7,327 eligible\nsubjects, 6,748 of whom participated, yielding a 92.1% response rate. By the\nfifth round, 5,919 respondents completed interviews, yielding an 87.7%\nretention rate.4\nBecause our interest lies in estimating a cross-level interaction between\nneighborhood disadvantage and cognitive skills, we further restrict the analysis\nto neighborhoods in which there are at least two respondents, reducing the\ntime-varying observations pooled over 5 waves of data (5 \u00d7 5,567). Dropping\nobservations that are not clustered with other cases improves the reliability of\nthe estimated between neighborhood variance component. Hazard models\nreveal no significant differences between the subset of cases eliminated (352\nrespondents) and the sample utilized in the analysis. The average number of\nindividuals per census block-group is 5.31, ranging from 2 to 33. Regression\nimputation with random error components was used to replace missing values\non explanatory measures (Jinn & Sedransk, 1989). To ensure that the reported\nresults are not sensitive to imputation, we replicated our models using listwise\ndeletion of cases with missing values and also mean substitution. There are no\nsubstantive differences.\nLevel-1 Measures (Time-Varying)\nViolence outcome\nThe number of violent acts committed in each wave is measured with an item\nthat asks respondents if they have attacked someone with the intention of hurt-\ning them in the past year (or since the date of last interview) and, if yes, to\n4. NLSY97 over-sampled African American and Hispanic respondents. We elected against using the\nover-sample because the analytic focus of the paper does not specifically address race/ethnicity.\nThe so called \"cross-sectional\" sample, which we analyze here, is also preferred because it is self-\nweighted--the US population (12\u00ad16) is sampled with probability of selection proportionate to size.\nThe results are substantively identical when the over-sample is included in our analysis.\nindicate the frequency with which they did so.5 The violence outcome is a count\nof the number of violent attacks engaged in during each wave and ranges from 0\nthe subjects reported at least one attack in each wave. However, a larger\npercentage (26.8%) reported that they attacked someone in at least one of five\nwaves. Given extensive skew, we treat the outcome as a Poisson sampling distri-\nbution with constant exposure and over-dispersion.7 Table 1 presents descrip-\ntive statistics for variables included in the analysis.\nLevel-1 control variables\nBased on theory and data availability, we include a set of control variables to\npartial out the effects of other suspected precursors and correlates of violence.\nAge is measured at each wave in months (from last interview) and averages\nabout 17 years (207 months). Preliminary analysis suggests a nonlinear relation-\nship between age and violence and hence a squared term is included to capture\nit. The nonlinear effect is consistent with what would be expected based on the\nage\u00adcrime curve (see Bilchik, 1998), and is graphically depicted in Figure 1.\nFigure 1 Age\u00adviolence curve. (NLSY97)\nPrior research suggests that residential mobility increases the risk for\nviolence because it disrupts interpersonal networks and the social capital they\nprovide (Ingersoll, Scamman, & Eckerling, 1989). Accordingly, a measure is\nincorporated that taps the total number of times each respondent has moved\n5. In preliminary analysis, we included a measure of prior violence in the model. In a change (i.e.,\ngroup mean centered), model such as the one estimated here the inclusion of prior violence\ncaptures ceiling effects--those who report high levels of violence during early waves are most likely\nto reduce their violence involvement over time and those who report little or no violence during\nearly waves are most likely to avoid violence in the future. Consistent with this logic the effect of\nprior violence on violence is negative when included although not significant. Its inclusion does not\nalter the pattern of findings.\n6. The frequency of violent attacks is the only measure of violence available in NLSY97.\n7. For example, Yijk is the number of violent attacks committed during an interval of time with\nlength mijk termed as \"exposure.\" In our case, Yijk is the number of violent attacks committed\nduring one year for each person j within each neighborhood k, so that mijk = 1 (i.e., constant expo-\nsure). According to our Level-1 model, the predicted value of Yijk when mijk = 1 will be the event\nrate, ijk. Specifically, to denote that Yijk has a Poisson distribution with exposure mijk and event\nrate per time period of ijk, we write (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002):\nThe expected value and variance of Yijk, given the event rate ijk, are then:\nThus, the expected number of events, Yijk, per unit of time i for person j within neighborhood k is\nthe event rate, ijk, multiplied by the exposure, mijk. At Level-1, we model:\nwhere ijk is the log of the event rate. Note that while ijk is constrained to be non-negative,\nlog(ijk) can take on any value. The predicted log event rate can be converted to an event rate by\ngenerating ijk = exp{ijk}.\nY P m\nijk ijk ijk ijk\n| ~ ( , ).\n \nE Y m Y m\nijk ijk ijk ijk ijk ijk ijk ijk\n( | ) ( | )\n,\n   \n= =\nVAR\n \nijk ijk\n= log( )\n(range 0\u00ad9). On average, respondents changed residence approximately two\ntimes. A dummy variable is included to adjust for residence in urban locales\n(Krivo & Peterson, 1996) where the incidence of violence is expected to be\ngreater relative to suburban and rural places. On average, 26% of the sample\nresided in urban locales. Deviations from the traditional, two-parent family\nhave been shown in prior research to be consequential for children due to\nturmoil/disruption, depressed resources, and a less than ideal socialization\nenvironment (McLanahan & Sandefur, 1994). \"Biological parents\" is measured\nwith a dummy variable that contrasts respondents residing with both biological\nparents with subjects that live in other settings (referent). Roughly half of the\nrespondents resided with both biological parents.\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics\nVariable name Mean SD\nLevel-1 statistics\nLevel-2 statistics\nLevel-3 statistics\ndisadvantage\nWe measure aspects of informal social control (Hirschi, 1969) with binary\nvariables that distinguish respondents who have dropped out of school, who are\nmarried, who are separated or divorced, and a covariate reflecting the number\nof weeks worked during the interview year.8 The measures of informal control\nshow that on average 8% of the sample did not complete high school (or a GED)\nand were not enrolled in school at the time of the interview. Most respondents\nwere minimally involved in employment activity, on average working about 15\nweeks in the previous year, and the vast majority remain unmarried (2%\nmarried).\nGang participation is measured with a binary variable (in gang) that distin-\nguishes gang members (coded 1) from non-members. Gang membership is asso-\nciated with heightened violence in previous research (e.g., Thornberry, Krohn,\nLizotte, Smith, & Tobin, 2002). Approximately 5.3% of the sample was active as\na gang member during at least one wave (not shown in the table), although\naverage membership across five waves is 2%. Given research showing that drug\nuse is a significant predictor of adolescent violence (Farrington & Loeber, 1999),\nwe control for variation overtime in each subject's use of drugs (including mari-\njuana, cocaine, and heroin) with a dummy variable reflecting use during each\nwave (use drugs). A substantial percentage of the sample reported drug use.\nDrug selling (sell drugs) is assessed by an item that asks whether subjects sold\ndrugs, including marijuana, cocaine, LSD, etc., in the past 12 months (or since\n8. We include these variables to increase the rigor of the models, but because of the relatively\nyoung age of the sample, the level of marital involvement is quite low perhaps explaining its lack of\nsignificance in the analysis presented below.\nFigure 1 Age\u00adviolence curve. (NLSY97)\nthe date of last interview). Over 17% of the subjects sold drugs during at least\none wave (not shown) and roughly 6% did so in each wave.\nLevel-2 Measures (Between-Person)\nCognitive skills\nThe U.S. Department of Defense funded administration of the CAT-ASVAB to\nNLSY97 respondents during the first wave for the purpose of establishing\nnational norms. The CAT-ASVAB comprises 12 separate tests that measure\nknowledge and skill in wide ranging competencies and is designed to determine\nwhich job specialties recruits are qualified for. We measure cognitive skills\nusing the composite reading and math score, which combines the word knowl-\nedge, paragraph comprehension, mathematical knowledge, and arithmetic\nreasoning subsections.9 The composite measure is preferable because it is age-\nnormed whereas the subtests are not, and because it is very similar to the AFQT\nmeasure utilized extensively by Herrnstein and Murray (1994) and thus yields a\nuseful comparison to prior research.10\nIn our view, which is influenced by Jencks and Phillips (1998), standardized\ntest scores reflect a complex interaction between genetic endowment and\nacademic skills acquired through schooling and interaction in multiple social\nenvironments. The term IQ, in our reading of the literature, connotes a more\ngenetic interpretation. We use the term \"cognitive skills\" as opposed to intelli-\ngence (i.e., IQ) to reflect our view that many, if not most, intelligence or stan-\ndardized tests may be more reflective of academic skills and achievement than\ninnate ability although we do not deny the contribution of endowment. Roberts,\nAnjoul, Kyllonen, Pallier, and Stankov (2000) analyzed the factor structure of the\nASVAB and concluded that it measures \"crystallized intelligence,\" which they\ndefine as accumulated knowledge and which is similar to Jencks and Phillips\n(1998, p. 13) interpretation of testing as reflecting \"developed abilities.\" More\nrecently, Koenig, Frey, and Detterman (2008) found that a general factor that\ncombines the ASVAB subtests correlates highly with several different aptitude\nand standardized achievement tests.\nWe also control, for the self-reported effort, each subject expended during\nthe ASVAB test. Effort was assessed at the conclusion of the ASVAB administration.\n9. The ASVAB math and reading composite correlates highly with a measure we constructed that\ncombines all of the ASVAB subtests into a principle components factor.\n10. The difference between the ASVAB reading and math score available in NLSY97 and the AFQT\nmeasure available in NLSY79 is that the former is administered in a computer-assisted form. This\nmeans that respondents who answered more questions correctly received progressively more diffi-\ncult questions and vice versa to reduce the time required to finish the test. Also, the results are\ntabulated by Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) staff. The AFQT score in the NLSY79, also derived from\nthe reading and math subsections of the ASVAB, was derived from a paper and pencil rather than\ncomputer-adapted test and its results were tabulated by the Departments of Defense and Military\nServices.\nCognitive skills and effort are coded such that high values reflect greater cognitive\nskill and greater effort. To facilitate interpretation of the hypothesized cross-\nlevel interaction effect, cognitive skill is expressed in the analysis as a standard\nscore with a mean of 0 and SD of 1; effort is grand-mean centered.\nLevel-2 controls\nFamily income is included given evidence of an inverse relationship with\nviolence (Bilchik, 1998). It is measured in dollars and is grand-mean centered in\nthe analysis. The average family earns $51,521. Measurement of race is based\non self-reported racial background and is represented with dummy variables\ncontrasting Black (15%), Hispanic (13%), Asian (2%), and other race (6%) with\nWhite (64%) subjects (for a recent discussion of race differences, see McNulty &\nBellair, 2003). Gender is included given well-documented (Farrington & Loeber,\n1999) higher rates of violence among males (female is the referent). The sample\nis approximately evenly split between males and females. Two covariates\nmeasured during the first wave are included to control the influence of delin-\nquent peers (Akers, 1998), reflecting the percentage of each subject's peers in\ntheir grade at school (or when they were in school) that are gang members and\nthe percentage that use drugs.11 The response set for each item ranges from 1\nto 5 with 1 indicating that almost none belong to a gang or use drugs and 5 indi-\ncating that almost all (over 90%) belong to a gang or use drugs. The mean for\npeer gang membership is 1.47 suggesting that on average less than 25% of\nsubject's peers are gang members and the mean for peer drug use is 2.23\nsuggesting that slightly more than 25% of peers use drugs. The measures of peer\nprocesses are grand-mean centered in the analysis.\nLevel-3 Measures (Between-Neighborhood)\nDefinition of the geographic size of a neighborhood is a debatable issue. Urban\nresearchers often use census tracts as a proxy for neighborhood or local area.\nWe opt instead for block-group, which is roughly one quarter of the population\nsize of a tract, because census tracts become substantially larger in land area\nfurther away from the inner city. Approximately two-thirds of the subjects\nreside in suburban and rural contexts and thus a tract may not correspond with\ntheir conception of neighborhood. Within urban areas, block-group may also be\nbetter than a tract because smaller areas are more socially homogeneous. We\nmeasure neighborhood conditions with block-group data from the 2000 US\n11. Peer questions were asked during the first round of data collection only.\nCensus, which are attached to individual records based on the latitude and\nlongitude of the respondent's home address during each interview year.12\nNeighborhood disadvantage is calculated in two steps. First, we average the\npercentage of the population living below the poverty line, the percentage unem-\nployed, and the percentage of households headed by a female across five waves\nfor each subject. Next, we compute z-scores for each of the three averages and\nsum them, yielding the neighborhood disadvantage scale. The component items\nload well on a common factor and the resulting index has good internal reliability\n(standardized alpha = .83). There is substantial variation in the neighborhood\ndisadvantage to which adolescents are exposed. The components of our\nnormalized scale--rates of poverty, unemployment, and female-headed house-\nholds--range from 0% to nearly 100% across neighborhoods. We explored adding\nadditional variables to the scale such as percent on public assistance and percent\nblack as some researchers have. Those variables do not improve the predictive\nutility of the scale. Moreover, we question the theoretical wisdom of adding extra\neconomic variables into a disadvantage scale because, in so doing, the scale\nbecomes weighted towards poverty which defeats the purpose of including\nunemployment and family structure. Adding percent black to the scale is likewise\nproblematic in our view because race is included in the model at the individual\nlevel, which makes the interpretation of percent black at the neighborhood level\nless clear. Finally, it is also the case that there has been substantial growth in\nthe number of black middle class neighborhoods across the USA over the past\n50 years (Pattillo, 2005) and that undermines the logic of including percent black\nin a disadvantage scale. We therefore opted for parsimony and theoretical clarity\nin using the three item scale.\nProcedure\nThe Level-1 structural model assumes the form (see Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002):\nwhere ijk is the log violence event rate per unit of time i for person j in\nneighborhood k; 0jk is the intercept for person j in neighborhood k; pijk are\ntime-varying covariates that predict violence and pjk are the corresponding\nLevel-1 coefficients indicating the association between predictors and the\noutcome for person j in neighborhood k; and eijk is a Level-1 random effect that\nrepresents prediction error. At Level 2, random variation in the Level-1 intercept\nis modeled with a set of person level characteristics, which can be expressed as\nfollows:\n12. We are unable to explore it in the analysis due to data limitations but we acknowledge the possi-\nbility of spatial interdependence.\n       \nijk jk jk ijk jk ijk pjk pijk ijk\ne\n= + + + + + +\nK\n    \njk j j ij j ij pj pij ij\n= + + + + +\nK \nwhere 00j is the intercept for the person-level effect 0jk in neighborhood k;\nXpij are person-level characteristics (e.g., cognitive skill) used as predictors;\n0pj are the corresponding regression coefficients; and 0ij is a Level-2 random\neffect that represents the deviation of person jk's Level-1 coefficient (0jk)\nfrom its predicted value based on the person-level model. The central variable\nof interest at Level 2 is the cognitive skills measure.\nAn analogous modeling process is replicated at the neighborhood level (Level\n3), where the intercept and coefficient from the cognitive skills measure at\nLevel 2 is modeled as a function of neighborhood disadvantage. The general\nLevel-3 structural model can be expressed with the formula:\nwhere pq0 is the intercept in the neighborhood model for pqk; Wsk is our\nmeasure of neighborhood disadvantage used as a predictor of neighborhood\neffects; pqs represents the extent of association between disadvantage (Wsk)\nand violence at Level 3 (pqk). Our interest at this stage centers on a cross-level\ninteraction between cognitive skills at Level 2 and neighborhood disadvantage\nat Level 3.\nThe models include two random effects: (1) a random intercept at Level 2,\nwhich captures variability in the frequency of violence between persons and (2)\na random intercept at Level 3, which captures between-neighborhood variation\nin mean violence event rates. Results of unit-specific models with robust stan-\ndard errors are presented. We considered a variety of alternative specifications\nof the violence outcome, including treating the original and a logged frequency\nscale as a normal outcome. Despite substantial skew, the findings are substan-\ntively equivalent to those based on the Poisson sampling distribution. We also\ncarefully examined the models for signs of multicollinearity by examining item\ninter-correlations, variance inflation factors (VIFs), and whether standard errors\nincrease across equations. None of the VIFs came close to exceeding the critical\nmulticollinearity is not at play in the analysis.\nResults\nTable 2 presents Poisson regressions of the frequency of adolescent violent\nbehavior on cognitive skills and neighborhood disadvantage in a three-level hier-\narchical model. The upper panel displays unit-specific fixed effects and the\nlower panel displays random effects. Model 1 is the unconditional growth model\nof the frequency of violence across the five waves. The estimated mean within\nneighborhood log event rate of violence is \u00ad2.238 (p < .01), indicative of overall\nlow frequencies of violence. Consistent with the literature, and as shown in\nFigure 1, the growth trajectory is nonlinear reflecting an age\u00adcrime curve of\nincreasing involvement in violence during early adolescence (12\u00ad15), a peak\n   \u00b5\npqk pq pqs\ns\nSpq\nsk pqk\nW\n= + +\n=\n\nduring mid-adolescence (16), followed by declining involvement in late adoles-\ncence (17\u00ad20). The variance components for the Level-2 and Level-3 intercepts\nare statistically significant, indicating significant between-person and between-\nneighborhood variability in violence event rates. As is commonly the case, the\nTable 2 Poisson regression of violent attack on cognitive skill and neighborhood\ndisadvantage\nModels\nLevel 3 variables (between-neighborhood)\nNeighborhood disadvantage .032*\nLevel-2 variables (between-person)\nNeighborhood disadvantage .050***\nLevel-1 variables (within-individual)\nRandom effect Variance component\n1Robust standard errors.\n2Coefficient multiplied by 10,000 to reduce places to the right of the decimal.\n3White is the reference.\nbulk of the variance in violence involvement is between-persons (60%), whereas\n7% is between-neighborhoods and 33% represents temporal variation at Level 1.\nModel 2 incorporates the remaining Level-1 covariates and those from Level 2\ninto the unconditional growth model. Consistent with prior research, greater\ncognitive skill is inversely and strongly associated with violent attacks. A consis-\ntent finding in the cognitive skill literature is that the effect of test scores on\nviolence is mediated by school performance (Bellair & McNulty, 2005; Hirschi &\nHindelang, 1977). Thus, those that possess greater cognitive skill are more likely\nto perform well in school which increases their attachment and commitment,\nboth of which act as a social deterrent to violence. Also notable is that subjects\nresiding in urban contexts, that are separated or divorced, are gang members,\nand are involved with drugs as users or sellers experience an elevated risk for\nviolence. As expected, being male and having a higher proportion of peers that\nare gang members or drug users significantly increases violence event rates,\nwhereas greater family income reduces it. Interestingly, inclusion of control\nvariables reduces the age effect to nonsignificance. That result is accounted for\nby the joint effects of gang membership, use of drugs, and drug selling (not\nshown in the table).\nModel 3 incorporates a cross-level interaction between cognitive skill and\nneighborhood disadvantage to test alternative hypotheses about the effect of\ncognitive skill as disadvantage changes. Findings show a significant main effect\nof disadvantage--the mean violence event rate is greater in neighborhoods with\nhigh levels of neighborhood disadvantage. The cross-level interaction between\ncognitive skills and disadvantage is highly significant. Table 3 summarizes it by\nevaluating the relationship from 2 SD below to 2 SD above the mean level of\nneighborhood disadvantage. The interaction reveals that the cognitive skills\u00ad\nviolence relationship is more pronounced in neighborhood contexts with low\nlevels of disadvantage and that it is not significant when disadvantage rises 2 SD\nabove the mean (i.e., in highly disadvantaged neighborhoods). This is consistent\nwith the behavioral genetics approach with its focus on the role of disadvan-\ntaged social environments in muting the expression of innate potential. In the\nfollowing section, we elaborate on the implications of this finding.\nTable 3 Conditional effect of cognitive skill on violence by level of neighborhood\ndisadvantage\nDisadvantage Cognitive skill1\n1Robust standard errors. Based on Table 2, Model 3.\nDiscussion\nA voluminous literature (see Ellis & Walsh, 2003) establishes an inverse relation-\nship between cognitive skill and violence. We also find a strong inverse rela-\ntionship which lends support to individual difference models. A central issue in\nthat literature is identifying the mechanism that mediates the relationship. We\nemphasize the role of school achievement and attachment because its effect as\na mediator is most consistently supported in previous research (Bellair &\nmechanisms such as school reaction (i.e., tracking), deviant peers, and low\nself-control.\nThe analysis extends the literature by asking whether the relationship\nbetween cognitive skill and violence involvement changes at varying levels of\nneighborhood disadvantage. Our approach contrasts sharply with the well-known\nand often criticized argument that cognitive skill is largely heritable and immu-\ntable over the life-course (Herrnstein & Murray, 1994; Wilson & Herrnstein,\n1985). From that perspective, the impact of cognitive skill on a wide range of\noutcomes is assumed to be invariant across context. It also contrasts with\napproaches that interpret cognitive skill as a barometer of accumulated ability\nbecause that approach rarely if ever conjectures that the relationship operates\ndifferently across levels of neighborhood disadvantage.\nWe find that the cognitive skill\u00adviolence relationship is strongest in advantaged\nneighborhoods where the local learning environment is more likely to be well\nfunded and conducive to enhanced school attachment (Leventhal & Brooks-Gunn,\n2000). The relationship is weakest (i.e., nonsignificant) in disadvantaged neigh-\nborhoods where learning environments are more likely to be ineffective. Results\nare therefore consistent with theorizing about the expression of genetic potential\nin differing social contexts (Guo & Stearns, 2002), poor neighborhoods as strong\neach of which posit that cognitive skill has strong effects on violence in more\naffluent neighborhoods and relatively weak effects in poor neighborhoods. Our\nresults conflict with the cumulative disadvantage hypothesis and are inconsistent\nwith research indicating that traits such as impulsivity (Lynam et al., 2000) have\nstronger effects on some outcomes in disadvantaged neighborhoods.\nThe results suggest that adolescents residing in disadvantaged neighborhoods\ndon't derive a protective buffer against violence as they accumulate cognitive\nskills over the life course. Rather, in poor neighborhoods, the pathways leading\nto mainstream success are often swamped by inequalities such as disorderly\nschool environments characterized by less motivated or qualified teachers and\nlow staff morale, and under-funded facilities and programs (Kozol, 1991). A\nharsh, disadvantaged social environment is often associated with a \"siege\nmentality\" or a sense of powerlessness that leads to mistrust of local institu-\ntions (Ross, Mirowski, & Pribesh, 2001), and those processes may weaken the\nlinkage between cognitive skills and the formation of strong social bonds such\nas attachment and commitment to school. As a result, the protective qualities\nof socialization towards conformity that flow from investment in and accumula-\ntion of human capital such as cognitive skills don't function as expected in\nhighly disadvantaged neighborhoods.\nHerrnstein and Murray (1994) contend that social problems such as street\ncrime are much more a function of diminished cognitive ability than poverty or\nsocial class. They argue:\nMany people tend to think of criminals as coming from the wrong side of the\ntrack .... But the assumption that too glibly follows from these observations is\nthat the economic and social disadvantage is in itself the cause of criminal\nbehavior. That is not what the data say ... much of the attention now given to\nproblems of poverty and unemployment should be shifted to another question\naltogether: coping with cognitive disadvantage. (p. 251)\nHerrnstein and Murray (1994) argue that cognitive skills trump disadvantage in\ntheir direct effect on crime, but they fail to recognize that concentration of\nneighborhood-level poverty and unemployment quite possibly suppresses the\nsocial impact of cognitive skills. Thus, their conclusion that crime can be\nreduced by rendering the operation of the criminal justice system more simple\nand transparent so that individuals of low ability can comprehend seems to us\noff the mark. Rather, the issue is finding ways to integrate disadvantaged\ncommunities into the social and economic mainstream such that investments in\nthe development of cognitive skills, whether by individual families or federal\nfunding of head start programs, can find expression and serve a protective\nsocial function by constraining adolescents from self-destructive violence.\nClearly, neighborhood disadvantage appears to upend a process that functions\nefficiently in affluent neighborhoods.\nMore fundamentally, research that ignores the role of neighborhood disadvan-\ntage may over- or under-estimate the effect of cognitive skills on violence\noutcomes depending on the distribution of a particular sample across\nneighborhoods. The key implication for theory is the need to continue refining\nperspectives that theoretically integrate individual difference (i.e., trait) models\nwith social-structural models of adolescent violence. Such approaches might\nsuggest significant modifications to existing theory about the role of person-level\nvariables in varying neighborhood contexts. For instance, personality researchers\nhave developed important models to summarize the dimensions of psychological\ndifference (Caspi, 1997), but have devoted little attention towards understanding\nhow social contexts moderate the effects of those differences on developmental\noutcomes. We advocate more research to help unravel this issue, especially\nresearch exploring the moderating role of neighborhood context on a variety of\nindividual traits in relation to crime outcomes.\nThe analysis relies on the ASVAB reading and math score to measure cognitive\nskill. To be sure, the measure is widely assumed to load highly on the latent\nconstruct intelligence. Nevertheless, a wide variety of cognitive tests have been\nused to document the cognitive skill\u00adcrime relationship. The analysis reveals\nthat the ASVAB measure is strongly associated with violence, but other research-\ners using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) find that the relationship\nis more modest (McGloin et al., 2004). There is very little recognition that the\nspecific measure of cognitive skill used across studies influences the pattern of\nfindings. We caution researchers to anticipate complexity in these relations. A\nfinal but important limitation is that we have observed, yet not explained, the\nmoderating effect of neighborhood contexts on adolescent violence. Identifica-\ntion of mediators in the cognitive skill\u00adviolence relationship is a crucial future\nissue that may help to elucidate the mechanisms by which social contexts\nmoderate the effects of individual differences on violence outcomes.\nReferences\nAkers, R.
