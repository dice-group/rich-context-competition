Food security is a term defined as, \"access by all\npeople at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life.\"\nChildren who are food insecure have \"limited or uncertain\navailability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or\nuncertain ability to acquire acceptable food in socially acceptable\nways\" (1). Using data collected by the US Census Bureau, Nord\nfood-insecure households (2).\nFood insecurity broadly defines an experience ranging from\neating less desirable foods, to skipping meals, to not eating for an\nentire day (3). Diet is perhaps the most obvious and immediate\nconsequence of food insecurity. Food-insecure children may\nconsume a diet that puts them at risk of health outcomes asso-\nciated with lower intakes of nutrients, including iron (4\u00ad6). Meats\nsuch as beef, pork, and poultry contain heme iron and have the\nhighest iron bioavailability (7). Yet, the expense associated with\nmeats may limit access for food-insecure children. Lower intakes\nof iron were observed in food-insufficient than in food-sufficient\nchildren aged 1\u00ad5 y by using data from the Continuing Survey of\nFood Intakes by Individuals (4). Food-insecure children were also\nobserved to have a restricted intake of foods from the meat food\ngroup compared with food-secure children (8). In consequence,\nfood-insecure children and adolescents may be unable to obtain\nthe necessary iron they need for proper growth and development.\nSufficient iron in young children is imperative for proper\npsychomotor, mental, behavioral, and cognitive development (9\u00ad\n14). Puberty is another critical time for iron nutrition in females\nstarting menstruation (15\u00ad17). Inadequate iron intake in food-\ninsecure children and adolescents may result in iron deficiency\nand iron deficiency anemia (18).\nThe research focusing on iron and related health outcomes has\nbeen narrow in coverage of food-insecure children and has used\niron variables that cannot be compared between studies (4\u00ad6, 19,\n20). Iron deficiency anemia has not been compared between food-\nsecure and -insecure groups of children aged 3\u00ad19 y. Additional\nresearch is needed to determine the consequence of food in-\nsecurity regarding iron in children. The purpose of this study was\nto investigate the strength of the association of food security\nstatus and body iron stores among children aged 3\u00ad19 y from the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)\nbetween food security status and selected dietary exposures\nassociated with iron status: the US Department of Agriculture\n(USDA) Food Guide for meat and grain intakes and the Estimated\nAverage Requirement (EAR) for iron.\nSurvey design and subjects\ntionally representative cross-sectional surveys continuously con-\nducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS),\na program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n1 From the Departments of Foods and Nutrition (HAE-M, CMW, and\nCJB) and Statistics (ACM), Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, and the\nCollege of Applied Human Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Col-\nlins, CO (CPM).\n2 Supported by Purdue University Extension.\n3 Address correspondence to CJ Boushey, Department of Foods and Nu-\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\n(CDC). NHANES participants were representative of and drawn\nfrom the noninstitutionalized and civilian US population. A\ncomplex multistage, probability sampling method was used to\nselect participants on the basis of age, sex, and race-ethnicity. Cer-\ntain cycles of the survey oversampled certain subpopulations to\nallow for the generation of more precise and reliable estimates for\nnon-Hispanic black Americans, Mexican Americans, low-income\nwhite Americans, adolescents aged 12\u00ad19 y, and individuals aged\n.60 y (21). Participants of NHANES completed an in-depth\nquestionnaire that assessed dietary behaviors, socioeconomic\nindicators, and health history in the participants' homes and at the\nNHANES Mobil Examination Center (MEC). In addition,\nparticipants visited the MEC to undergo a physician-conducted\nassessment of medical, dental, and physiologic health indexes. A\n24-h dietary recall was administered, and biological samples were\ncollected from the participants (eg, blood, urine, and hair). A\nsubsample completed a telephone-administered 24-h dietary\nrecall 3\u00ad10 d after the MEC visit.\nProxy reporting for children aged 1\u00ad5 y was completed by\na child's parent or guardian, whereas the reporting of children aged\n6\u00ad11 y was parent- or guardian-assisted. Children aged 12 y\ncompleted some portions of the interview independently of their\nparents or guardians. Consent was required for all participants\nand was given by a parent or guardian for children younger than\n18 y. Child consent was additionally requested for children aged\n12 y (21). The NCHS Research Ethics Review Board reviewed\nand approved NHANES protocol for all NHANES content (22).\nThe Purdue Committee on the Use of Human Research Sub-\njects approved all of the research activities included in this\nanalysis.\nParticipants of this analysis included all nonpregnant children\nand adolescents from 3 to 19 y who successfully completed the\nhousehold interview and participated in the MEC examination\n(n = 11,818). Exclusions were made for all participants without\nHousehold Food Security classification and participants aged\n3\u00ad15 y without Child Food Security classification (n = 513),\nindividuals who donated blood in the past month (n = 25),\nand participants with a lead concentration .10 lg/dL (n = 33)\nindividuals.\nFamily and sample person questionnaire\nCharacteristics queried in the questionnaire portion of the\nsurvey were age, sex, race-ethnicity, annual household income,\npresence of a smoker living in the household, dietary supplement\nuse in the past 30 d, sickness that started in the past 30 d (includes\nhead cold, chest cold, flu, pneumonia, ear infection, stomach, and\nintestinal illness), blood donation in the past 12 mo (aged 16\u00ad19\ny), number of school meals eaten each week (ages 6\u00ad19 y),\nmenstruation status (females aged 6\u00ad19 y), use of birth control at\nthe time of the survey (females aged 12\u00ad19 y), and household\nparticipation in the USDA Special Supplemental Nutrition\nProgram for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program.\nFood Security Survey Module\nThe US Household Food Security Survey Module (FSSM) was\nincluded in the household interview. This questionnaire has been\nextensively evaluated for validity and reliability and shown to\naccurately quantify access to food (24\u00ad33). The questions con-\ntained in the 18-item FSSM direct participants to consider food\neaten in their households over the past 12 mo (34) and to evaluate\nhousehold, individual, or child-specific access to food. Food\nsecurity of household adults and children is classified into 1 of 4\nranges on the continuum of food security: \"household full food\nsecurity\" defines a situation in which there are no problems or\nanxieties for household members regarding food; \"household\nmarginal food security\" occurs when household members have\nanxiety regarding food or problems in attaining food, but quality,\nvariety, and quantity are not reduced; \"household low food se-\ncurity\" exists when quality, variety, and desirability are reduced\nyet quantity remains adequate; and \"household very low food\nsecurity\" occurs when eating patterns are disrupted and food\nquantity is reduced due to inadequate resources. Household full\nand marginal food-security classifications are often grouped and\nreferred to as \"food secure,\" whereas low and very low food\nsecurity classifications are referred to as \"food insecure\" (3).\nEight child-specific questions contained in the FSSM are used\nto determine food security among household children (35). Child-\nspecific household food-security classifications are defined\nsimilarly to household classifications but are labeled as follows:\n\"child food quality and quantity unaffected,\" \"child reduced food\nquality or quantity,\" \"child reduced food quality and quantity,\"\nand \"child severely reduced quality and quantity\" (21). House-\nhold and child-specific household food-security classifications\nwere included in the NHANES data release.\nChild-specific household food security was selected as the\nmost direct and reliable measure to quantify the experience of\nthis analysis. Additional analysis by household food security was\nalso performed in these age groups (data not shown). Child-\nspecific household food-security classification was not provided\nfor children aged 18\u00ad19 y--an age group with an insufficient\nnumber of participants to be analyzed separately. Thus, the age\ngroup 16\u00ad19 y was solely analyzed by household food security, as\ndetermined by the 18-item FSSM.\nLaboratory examination\nAll participants underwent blood collection by venipuncture at\nthe MEC. Serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and free eryth-\nrocyte protoporphyrin were measured at the CDC in Atlanta, GA.\nSerum ferritin was measured by use of the Bio-Rad QuantImune\nFerritin IRMA (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Trans-\nferrin saturation was calculated by dividing serum iron by total-\niron-binding capacity; both were measured by a modification\nof the automated Technicon AAII-25 ferrozine colorimetric\nmethod (Alpkem TFA analyzer; Alpkem, Calackamas, OR). Free\nerythrocyte protoporphyrin was quantified by fluorescence ex-\ntraction by using a modification of the Sassa method (39). He-\nmoglobin was determined in the NHANES MEC with the Coulter\nMAXM automated electronic counter (Coulter Electronics,\nHialeah, FL) as part of a complete blood count. Latex-enhanced\nnephelometry was performed at the University of Washington to\nmeasure C-reactive protein (CRP). Blood lead was measured at\nthe CDC with a Perkin-Elmer (Waltham, MA) model SIMAA\n6000 simultaneous multi-element atomic absorption spectrometer\nwith Zeeman background correction. Quality-control methods\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nwere implemented for all procedures. A detailed description of the\nassaymethodsusedtodeterminethebiochemicalindicatorsofiron\nstatus used in this study were described elsewhere (21).\nIron-status variables\nIron deficiency was defined by the presence of 2 abnormal\nvalues for the indicators serum ferritin (,10 lg/L for ages 3\u00ad5 y\ny), and free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (.1.24 lmol/L red\nblood cells for ages 3\u00ad19 y), as classified by Looker et al (40).\ntermination of iron deficiency were necessary to classify iron\ndeficiency anemia (40). Hemoglobin cutoffs were 0.4 g/dL\nlower for non-Hispanic blacks younger than 5 y, as recom-\nmended by the Institute of Medicine (41). Only data from 1999\niron-deficiency indicators were not quantified for this age group\nfor use as a serum indicator of inflammation--a condition that\nmay cause fluctuations in iron indicators independent of iron\nDietary assessment\nThe examination component of NHANES included the col-\nlection of a 24-h dietary recall via the USDA's Automated\nMultiple Pass Method (AMPM) (44) in the MEC. The second 24-\nAMPM takes '30\u00ad45 min to complete. Five passes, or series of\nprobes, are used in the AMPM to retrieve as many foods as\npossible that were consumed in the past 24 h. The dietary in-\nformation collected with the AMPM is linked to the USDA Food\nand Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (45), a nutrient\ncomposition database, which includes information on an esti-\nmated 7000 foods. The AMPM computerized software system\nallows for direct coding of the reported foods, recipe modifi-\ncation and development, data editing and management, and\nnutrient analysis of dietary data (44).\nTotal iron intake (mg/d) was included in the NHANES data\nrelease. Iron intakes for each sex and age were compared with the\nsex- and age-specific EAR to determine fulfillment of the re-\nquirement (46). Total iron from meat and total iron from grain\nwere calculated by identifying meat and grain foods by using the\nUSDA food code assigned to each food listed in the 24-h dietary\nrecall. Total ounces of meat and grain products consumed were\ndetermined similarly by using the USDA food code to identify the\nfoods. Gram weight of each individual food was converted to\nsummation of the ounces of each type of food. Total ounces\nconsumed from these food groups were compared with reference\nounces given in the USDA Food Guide (47) to determine whether\nintake met the recommendation for each sex and age defined for\nmoderately active children.\nAnthropometric measures\nHeight and weight were collected in the examination portion of\nthe survey by using a stadiometer for height and a Toledo scale for\nweight, which were supported by the Integrated Survey In-\nformation System for the immediate capture and recording of\ndata. These measures were converted to BMI-for-age for each\nindividual by linking the data to indexes of anthropometric status\nbased on the CDC Growth Charts (48). Overweight status was\ndetermined by comparing BMI with the CDC growth chart\nstandards (49). Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) 9.1 (SAS\nInstitute Inc, Cary, NC) was used to run the NCHS/CDC available\nSAS program to determine percentiles from the growth charts\nStatistical analysis\n19 y) for consistency with NHANES procedures and tests con-\nducted by age. Indicator variables were created for race-ethnicity\nas non-Hispanic white (reference), non-Hispanic black, Mexican\nAmerican, and a combined group of other Hispanic, other race,\nand multiracial participants. The race-ethnicity groups in the\ncombined group were each too small in sample size to be\nclassified as independent groups. Although together these indi-\nviduals likely represent a diverse group within themselves, as\nwell as between the other groups, the benefits of combining this\ndiverse group outweighed the loss of power that would occur with\ntheir exclusion from the analysis, or their blending with other\ndominant groups.\nThe poverty-income ratios included in the NHANES data were\ncalculated as household income divided by the federal poverty\nguideline for household income. The poverty-income ratio was\nsimplified to a continuous variable with a range of 0 to 5 (50). For\nthis analysis, the poverty-income ratio was classified into 4\nvariables) (50). Alternatively, the poverty-income ratio was\nHousehold participation in WIC was categorized as yes or no;\npresence of a smoker living in the household as yes or no; birth\nweight as ,5.5 lb or 5.5 lb, use of a dietary supplement in the\npast 30 d as yes or no; sickness starting in the past 30 d as yes or\nno; number of school meals eaten per week as 0, 1\u00ad5, or 6\u00ad10\n(indicator variables); menstruation started or not yet started; use\nof birth control at the time of the survey as yes or no; and survey\nvariables). The number of months since the last blood donation\nwas also classified on the basis of self report in the interview.\nBecause of the small number of participants classified into\n\"low food security\" and \"very low food security, \" food-security\nclassifications were collapsed into 2 categories: 1) \"full food\nsecurity/marginal food security\", or \"food secure,\" and 2) \"low/\nvery low food security,\" or \"food insecure\" (35). Iron deficiency\nand iron deficiency anemia were categorized as present or not\npresent, and CRP was defined as above the cutoff or at or below\nthe cutoff. The dietary variable created for total iron intake was\ndefined as greater than or equal to the EAR or less than the EAR.\nMeat-source iron intake and grain-source iron intake were de-\nfined as greater than or equal to the median intake of the food-\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nCharacteristics of participants aged 3\u00ad5 y from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999\u00ad2004 by food-security status\nCharacteristics\nFood security\namong children1\nFood insecurity\namong children1\nP\nChi-square test2\nWeighted\nn (%) n (%)\nHousehold Women, Infants,\nand Children benefits\n(Continued)\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nsecure group or less than the median intake of the food-secure\ngroup.

Participant BMI\nwas categorized into 3 groups: less than the 85th percentile as\n\"normal,\" between the 85th and 95th percentile as \" at risk of\noverweight,\" and greater than the 95th percentile as overweight\nA descriptive analysis by food-secure and -insecure groups\nwas completed for categorical variables (Tables 1\u00ad4). Chi-square\nanalysis was used to compare food-secure and food-insecure\nchildren and adolescents of each age group regarding the char-\nacteristics defined by the categorical variables. Logistic re-\ngression was used to determine the odds of iron deficiency\ncompared with no iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia\ncompared with no iron deficiency anemia for food-insecure and\nfood-secure children and adolescents of each age group. Models\nof iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia were examined\nwith and without exclusion of participants with inflammation\nindicated by abnormal CRP values; no difference in results were\nobserved (data not shown).\nLogistic regression was also used to compare the dietary\nintakes of food-insecure and food-secure children and adoles-\nticipants by using the dietary values derived from the single 24-h\nticipants by using an average value for each variable that was\ncomputed from the 2 d of dietary data available for these years\n(data not shown). Nine models were constructed for each age\niron intake below the EAR was compared with total dietary iron\nintake above or equal to the EAR in food-insecure and -secure\ngroups. Participants with total meat-source iron intake (including\nbeef, pork, lamb, veal, game, organ meats, frankfurters, sausages,\nluncheon meats, poultry, shellfish, fish, and mixtures with meat as\nthe main ingredient) below the median of the food-secure group\nwere compared with participants having a total meat-source iron\nintake equal to or above the median of the food-secure group.\nSimilarly, participants with a total grain-source iron intake (in-\ncluding yeast breads, rolls, cereals, pastas, quick breads, pan-\ncakes, French toast, cakes, cookies, pastries, pies, crackers,\npopcorn, pretzels, corn chips, and mixtures with grains as the\nmain ingredient) below the median of the food-secure group were\ncompared with participants having a total grain-source iron in-\ntake equal to or above the median of the food-secure group. Total\ngrain-source iron without inclusion of sweet grains (eg, cakes,\ncookies, pastries, and pies) and total grain-source iron without\nsweet grains and quick-breads (eg, muffins, pancakes, and French\ntoast) were also modeled (data not shown) with no difference in\nresults. Not meeting the USDA Food Guide for meat intake and\ngrain intake compared with meeting the USDA Food Guide for\nmeat intake and grain intake, respectively (47) were modeled to\ncompare food-insecure with food-secure children and adoles-\ncents. In addition, models for recommended intake of grains\nwithout sweet grains, and grains without sweet grains and quick-\nbreads were constructed with no difference in results (data not\nshown).\nAll variables included in the analysis were categorical in\nnature. Survey weights were applied to all analyses, and all\nmodels were adjusted for clustering, stratification, survey cycle\nyear, sex, race-ethnicity, and poverty-income ratio (21), as were\nunevenly distributed variables identified by chi-square analysis in\nTables 1\u00ad4. The potential confounder, sickness starting in the past\n30 d, was tried in all models with no effect on the significance of\nthe independent variable. Another potential confounder, poverty-\nincome ratio, was included in all models as 4 indicator variables\nand separately as 6 indicator variables (data not shown) with no\neffect on the primary exposure, food-security status. All other\nvariables were considered in the selection of the best model,\nand effect modification was examined. All regression and chi-\nsquare analyses were completed in SAS 9.1 by using SAS\nSurvey procedures to account for the complex survey design\nused in NHANES.

On the basis of our findings, food-insecure children in\nthis age group were almost 3 times as likely to have iron de-\nficiency anemia than were food-secure children. Early adoles-\ncence is a critical time for iron nutrition because of higher iron\ndemands accompanying rapid growth (15, 16) and onset of\nmenses in females. Adolescent females have a high US preva-\nlence of iron deficiency (40). Our results suggest that food-\ninsecure children may experience an even more widespread and\nsevere case burden.\nThe increased odds of iron deficiency anemia in food-insecure\nchildren aged 12\u00ad15 y may also be explained by growing dietary\nindependence and diminished parental protection. Food may not\nbe reserved preferentially for household food-insecure children\nof these ages, as has been shown for younger children (30, 35,\n53). Parents may consider older children able to take on the\nburden of food insecurity out of necessity. Additional behavioral,\nenvironmental, and psychological factors associated with food\ninsecurity may also influence iron status (3).\nIron deficiency anemia in 12\u00ad15-y-olds was not associated with\nhousehold food insecurity despite a significant association with\nfood insecurity among household children. Household food-\nsecurity classification may be less sensitive than child-specific\nhousehold food-security classification because of differential in-\ndividual food security within the household. Adolescent food in-\nsecurity was underestimated by 33% and 20% by using the US\nwith a child-specific food-security measure (35) that may more\naccurately classify the experience and behavior of children (35).\nThe increased likelihood of iron deficiency in children aged\n6\u00ad11 y from households with food security than in their food-\ninsecure counterparts was perplexing. No other age group\nexhibited a similar outcome. Iron-status measures for children\nsmaller sample size compared with other age groups. Iron-\ndeficient children of these ages also exhibited different charac-\nteristics (data not shown) than iron-deficient anemic children,\nbecause most were normal to overweight Mexican American\nfemales from nonsmoking food-secure households with a\npoverty-income ratio ,2.00 who did not meet the USDA Food\nGuide\u00adrecommended meat intake. Iron deficient anemic chil-\ndren of this age group were primarily overweight females of\nvaried race-ethnicities from smoking, food-insecure households\nwith a poverty-income ratio ,2.00 who did not meet the USDA\nFood Guide\u00adrecommended grain intake. Food choice, BMI\nstatus, and household smoking among low-income racial-ethnic\ngroups may have interacted to determine the presence and se-\nverity of iron deficiency. Food security and iron status by\nnumber of years in the United States may also be explored in\ndata and reported similar trends of greater iron deficiency\nprevalence among Mexican American, overweight children aged\n1\u00ad3 y from households with an income less than the poverty\nthreshold than among other race-ethnicity, weight-for-height,\nand income groups. However, similar results of association be-\ntween iron deficiency and food security have not been\nTABLE 3 (Continued)\nCharacteristics\nFood insecurity\namong children1\nFood security\namong children1\nP\nChi-square test2\nWeighted\nn (%) n (%)\n1 Total numbers do not always add up to sample size because of missing values; percentages do not always add up to 100 because of rounding.

An explanation may be found in the\ntrend for individual household food insecurity, known to often\nbe short in duration but to occur frequently throughout the year\n(55). Food-insecure and iron-deficient children may experience\nfrequent bouts of food insecurity, which results in a chronic\nsituation in which iron depletion is not sufficiently restored\nbetween food-insecure periods. Iron deficiency may not be\nsufficiently long term in affected food-secure children to result\nin a large case burden of iron deficiency anemia.

Weights were rescaled so that the sum of the weights matched the survey population at the\nmidpoint of the 6 y from 1999 to 2004.

Less frequent exposure and duration of food\ninsecurity may result in less frequent progression of iron de-\nficiency to anemia.\nOur results also indicated that the chance of iron deficiency\nanemia was '11 times greater in food-insecure than in food-\nsecure children aged 3\u00ad5 y, and the chance of iron deficiency was\n'8 times greater in food-insecure children aged 6\u00ad11 y than in\ntheir food-secure counterparts. However, the 95% CIs for these\nspectively, and should be interpreted with caution. The number of\ncases was very small in both age groups, which prevented the\ncalculation of a stable estimate. Nevertheless, similar results with\na younger age group (6 mo to 3 y) of food-insecure children have\nbeen documented (20). Food-insecure children were 2.4 times as\nlikely to be classified as having iron deficiency anemia than were\nfood-secure children (20). These observations, along with signifi-\ncant results for iron deficiency anemia among 12\u00ad15 y children,\nsuggesta trendofunequalburdenamongfood-secureand-insecure\ngroups that merits further investigation in all pediatric age groups.\nFoodinsecurityin16\u00ad19-y-oldswasassociatedwithinadequate\ntotal iron intake. These food-insecure adolescents also consumed\nless iron from grain sources than did food-secure adolescents.\nAdequate iron intake may not be a priority for adolescents during\nthe transition to independence. Children aged 16\u00ad19 y may have\nvery little parental input regarding food choices and may be\nexperimenting with alternative diets, dieting, and eating less\nnutrient-rich foods. Food-insecure adolescents may be particu-\nlarly vulnerable because they have fewer monetary and food\nresources.\nSelection bias may be present in this study and is one possible\nlimitation to our findings. Many young children had missing iron-\nstatus indicators that may have been a result of phlebotomy\nrefusal (56).

Dietary data may have been\nmore complete and accurate if more than one dietary assessment\n24-h dietary recall collected for all years.\nIn addition, children and adolescents as a group present\nconsiderable challenges for dietary assessment because of highly\ninconsistent diets and rapid changes in type and pattern of food\nintake (57). Adolescents may be less concerned with giving an\naccurate report of diet than are adults (57, 58).\nIron deficiency anemia is a serious concern for food-insecure\nadolescents. This study is evidence of health disparities that\ncontinue to exist in food-insecure children, despite US policy and\nprograms directed to this audience. Successful and ongoing\ninterventions are required to improve food security among\nchildren and to reduce iron deficiency anemia among food-\ninsecure children.\nLogistic regression models: association of dietary iron intake, servings of meat, and servings of grain in food-secure compared with food-insecure\nparticipants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999\u00ad20041\nDietary factors\nTotal iron intake ,EAR\nMeat source iron intake ,median\nof food-secure children\nGrain source iron intake ,median\nof food-secure children\nServings of meat ,USDA Food\nGuide recommendation\nServings of grain ,USDA Food\nGuide recommendation\n1 All models were adjusted for clustering, stratification, sex, survey year, race-ethnicity, poverty-income ratio, use of a dietary supplement, and household\nparticipation in the Women, Infants, and Children program.
