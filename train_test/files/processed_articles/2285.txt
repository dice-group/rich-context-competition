    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjectives: The 2004 International Conference on Improving Use of Medicines recommended\nthat emerging and expanding health insurances in low-income countries focus on improving access\nto and use of medicines. In recent years, Community-based Health Insurance (CHI) schemes have\nmultiplied, with mounting evidence of their positive effects on financial protection and resource\nmobilization for healthcare in poor settings. Using literature review and qualitative interviews, this\npaper investigates whether and how CHI expands access to medicines in low-income countries.\nMethods: We used three complementary data collection approaches: (1) analysis of WHO\nNational Health Accounts (NHA) and available results from the World Health Survey (WHS); (2)\nreview of peer-reviewed articles published since 2002 and documents posted online by national\ninsurance programs and international organizations; (3) structured interviews of CHI managers\nabout key issues related to medicines benefit packages in Lao PDR and Rwanda.\nResults: In low-income countries, only two percent of WHS respondents with voluntary insurance\nbelong to the lowest income quintile, suggesting very low CHI penetration among the poor. Yet\naccording to the WHS, medicines are the largest reported component of out-of-pocket payments\nfor healthcare in these countries (median 41.7%) and this proportion is inversely associated with\nincome quintile. Publications have mentioned over a thousand CHI schemes in 19 low-income\ncountries, usually without in-depth description of the type, extent, or adequacy of medicines\ncoverage. Evidence from the literature is scarce about how coverage affects medicines utilization\nor how schemes use cost-containment tools like co-payments and formularies. On the other hand,\ninterviews found that medicines may represent up to 80% of CHI expenditures.\nConclusion: This paper highlights the paucity of evidence about medicines coverage in CHI. Given\nthe policy commitment to expand CHI in several countries (e.g. Rwanda, Lao PDR) and the\npotential of CHI to improve medicines access and use, systematic research is needed on medicine\nbenefits and their performance, including the impacts of CHI on access to, affordability, and use of\nmedicines at the household level.\nThis article is available from: http://www.health-policy-systems.com/content/6/1/11\n\u00a9 2008 Vialle-Valentin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBackground\nLow-income countries face considerable challenges in\nfinancing health care for their populations: limited tax\nrevenues and complex management of social health insur-\nance translate into enormously inadequate health expen-\nditures per capita with individuals directly absorbing the\nfinancial burden of diseases.\nOver the past decade, policy makers have presented com-\nmunity financing as an alternative to user fees strategies\nand a viable option to improving health care systems in\nlow-income countries [1,2]. Several typologies reflect the\nextreme diversity of community financing, including\ncommunity cost-sharing, community prepayment, pro-\nvider based health insurance, and government or social\ninsurance-supported community-driven schemes [3]. The\nterm 'Community-based Health Insurance' (CHI)\ndescribes not-for-profit prepayment plans for health care,\nwith community control and voluntary membership that\nprovide risk pooling to low-income populations: these\nnonprofit (mutual) insurance plans are 'any scheme man-\naged and operated by an organization, other than a government\nor private for-profit company that provides risk pooling to cover\nall or part of the costs of health care services' [4]. The actual\nCHI contribution to health care financing is difficult to\nquantify. The ability of CHI to improve financial protec-\ntion and resource mobilization for health care in poor set-\ntings has long been questioned [5,6], but there is now\nmounting evidence that CHI has positive effects [2-4,7-\n10]. Objectives, structure, size, and management of CHI\nplans depend upon local economic and cultural environ-\nments. In recent years, CHI plans have multiplied as a\ntransition towards better social protection against the cost\nof illness in low-income countries where rural popula-\ntions are usually excluded from other forms of health\negal [15], or Lao PDR [16], CHI expansion is an integral\ncomponent of the national health care financing strategy.\nEssential medicines are critical to treating infectious dis-\neases and chronic conditions. Improving access to medi-\ncines in developing countries is one key to achieving the\nincome countries, health insurers have developed strate-\ngies that improve affordability of medicines to their mem-\nbers (purchasing pools, rebates) and increase their\nappropriate utilization (education of consumers and pre-\nscribers) [19]. Conversely, the absence of effective medi-\ncines coverage may contribute to the incidence of\ncatastrophic health expenditures [20,21]. Expanding\nhealth insurance to improve access to medicines in poor\nregions of the world is one of the recommendations\nissued by the 2004 International Conference on Improv-\ning Use of Medicines [22]. There, experts from 70 coun-\ntries recommended expanding health insurance programs\nto include medicines coverage as a means to improve\naccess to and use of medicines in low-income countries\nand avoid catastrophic household health care expendi-\ntures for the world's poor.\nWe believe that CHI has the potential to improve access to\nand quality use of medicines, and that members may be\nmore likely to voluntarily participate in CHI with medi-\ncines coverage. To begin to examine this hypothesis, we\nsought to describe the prevalence of CHI among poor\npopulations; the characteristics of medicine benefits\noffered by CHI plans; and how medicines coverage may\naffect the performance of CHI and the satisfaction of\nmembers with their plans.\nMethods\nTo control for the diversity of CHI, we focused our inves-\ntigation on low-income countries as defined by the World\nBank, e.g. countries with a Gross National Income of\nNational Health Accounts (NHA) to evaluate the preva-\nlence of voluntary insurance in health care financing [24].\nBecause NHA provide only indirect data on CHI, we com-\nplemented NHA data with aggregate results from the\nWHO World Health Survey (WHS), available for 20 of the\n54 low-income countries at the time of our study: Bangla-\ndesh, Burkina Faso, Chad, Comoros, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ethio-\npia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Lao PDR, Malawi, Mali,\nMauritania, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Senegal, Vietnam,\nZambia, and Zimbabwe [25]. Information on out-of-\npocket medicine expenditures and voluntary health insur-\nance coverage was extracted from aggregate WHS reports\nWe performed a literature review looking for data on char-\nacteristics of medicines coverage offered by CHI plans in\nlow-income countries. Publications were identified with\nEMBASE and MEDLINE from January 2002 through\nDecember 2006, using the search terms: community-\nbased health insurance, community health planning, cost\nsharing, developing countries, drug benefit, fees and\ncharges, health expenditures, health insurance, health\nresources, health services accessibility, insurance, and\nmedicines coverage. We also searched websites of major\ninternational organizations such as the International\nLabor Organization, World Bank, World Health Organi-\nzation, and websites of international development agen-\ncies such as the US Agency of International Development\nand the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement. Peer-reviewed\narticles in English and published reports in English or\nFrench that identified a CHI plan were selected and classi-\nfied by country. For each low-income country, we\nextracted data on the number of schemes, total member-\nship, as well as existence and role of CHI networks. At the\nindividual plan level, we collected information about\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ntechnical design features related to medicine benefits (i.e.,\ninpatient or outpatient medicines coverage, policies\nrelated to use of essential medicines and generics, drug\nsubsidies and donations channeled through plans),\norganizational incentives related to medicines (i.e., men-\ntion of cost-containment tools such as medicine co-pay-\nments, strategies for improving quality of prescriptions),\nor any mention of members' attitudes about how CHI\naffects access to medicines. When two articles provided\nthe same level of technical information on a scheme, we\nchose the more recent one.\nFinally, to illustrate how individual plans operate, we con-\nducted interviews using a structured questionnaire in two\ncountries where governments have taken the lead in using\nCHI to expand health insurance coverage to poor popula-\ntions: one country in Africa (Rwanda) and one in Asia\n(Lao PDR). This questionnaire is available at http://\nwww.whoccpp.org/research/medic.asp.\nResults\nMedicine Expenditures, Poverty, and Voluntary Insurance\nOver a third of the world's population resides in low-\nincome countries, where about 70% of people live in rural\nareas.\nAccording to NHA data (Table 1), out-of-pocket payments\naccount for 85% of private health care expenditures,\nwhich themselves represent over half of total health care\nexpenditures in low-income countries. NHA data include\ninformation on the existence of prepaid health insurance\nplans, defined as \"the outlays of private social insurance\nschemes, commercial and nonprofit (mutual) insurance\nschemes, health maintenance organizations, and other agents\nmanaging prepaid medical and paramedical benefits including\nthe operating costs of these schemes\". Overall, private health\ncare expenditures adjusted for purchasing power parity\n(ppp) are similar between low-income countries with and\nwithout private prepaid plans (ppp-adjusted US $ 36.1 vs.\nUS $ 38.4, respectively). However, in the former, out-of-\npocket expenditures constitute a smaller percentage of pri-\npart to the 5.3% average contribution by private prepaid\nplans.\nNHA do not report on categories of population covered by\nprepaid health insurance plans, but WHS data give some\nindication about the economic status of privately insured\npeople. WHS data provide information on the overall\nprevalence of health insurance, and of \"voluntary insur-\nance\" which includes CHI. Among the 84,135 households\ninterviewed by the WHS in the 17 low-income countries\nthat reported data on the WHS insurance section, a total\nof 785 respondents reported having some form of health\ninsurance (Table 2). Of those respondents reporting\ninsurance, 61.4% on average were enrolled in voluntary\nhealth insurance programs, ranging from 0.8% of insured\npersons in Pakistan to 90.7% of those insured in Nepal.\nCoverage by voluntary health insurance was strongly asso-\nciated with income level: on average, 2% of respondents\nwith voluntary insurance were in the lowest income quin-\ntile, while over two-thirds of the insured were in the high-\nest.\nWHS data from low-income countries provide some\ninsight about the importance of medicines in household\nexpenditures, and on how economic factors affect access\nto medicines (Table 3). Medicines constitute the largest\nreported component of out-of-pocket payments for health\nranging from 11.1% of health expenditures in Chad to\n68.8% in Nepal. Furthermore, the proportion of out-of-\npocket health expenditures devoted to medicines is\ninversely associated with income quintiles (Figure 1).\nThose living below the World Bank poverty standard of\nUS$1 per day devote 53.0% of their health expenditures\nto medicines, compared to 40.1% among those living\nabove the poverty standard (p < 0.01).\nPaucity of published data about medicines coverage in\nCHI\nWe identified fifty-three publications containing informa-\nTable 1: Average per Capita Health Expenditures (HE) in Low-income Countries, WHO National Health Accounts, 2003\nLow income countries Total HE Private HE Prepaid Plans Out-of-Pocket\nn ppp-adj.

Most\ndata were aggregated from either national CHI networks\nworks affiliated with non-governmental organizations\nsuch as La Concertation [73], or Community Health\nWe found data linking individual schemes to the existence\nof a medicines benefit package for only 20 schemes: 13\nfrom India, 3 from Bangladesh, 3 from Senegal, and 1\nfrom Benin. Table 5 shows that some form of medicines\ncoverage was documented in 36% of the publications, a\nmedicines co-payment in 32%, outpatient medicine ben-\nefits in 25%, an essential medicines list (EML) or generic\nmedicine policies in 21% of the publications. No publica-\ntion reported the details of medicines benefit packages or\nhow members qualify for coverage; none provided evi-\ndence about expanded access to medicines linked with\nmedicines coverage.\nTwo illustrative case studies\nIn Rwanda, a comprehensive political and legal frame-\nwork supports the systematic expansion of CHI as the\ninstrument of progression towards universal health insur-\nance coverage [14,76]. Consequently, the number of\nschemes has rapidly grown in recent years to over 300 in\n2006, the highest number of schemes and enrollees in\nlow-income countries (Table 4). In 2005, CHI covered\nCHI plans and the health centers they support are coordi-\nnated by 30 districts. A governmental technical support\nunit (CTAMS) oversees district units, determines policies\nand practices of CHI, and dictates common features of\nbenefit packages. Benefits cover low risk events treated at\nthe health center level, including medicines on the\nnational Essential Medicines List (EML), all preventive\nand curative services, prenatal care, delivery care, labora-\ntory exams, and referral transport to district hospitals.\nSome selected high-risk events are also covered at the dis-\ntrict hospital level. External funding has been used to\nfinance the provision of CHI coverage for the very poor.\nInterviews with managers of two schemes: Gicumbi and\nCentre Universitaire de Sant\u00e9 Publique (CUSP) illustrate\nhow CHI functions in Rwanda. These two schemes were\nselected because they represent two different geographic\nareas (Northern and Southern Provinces) and two levels\nof activity (Gicumbi coordinates several plans at the dis-\ntrict level whereas CUSP assumes a strictly local function).\nBoth plans had been in operation for over three years at\nthe time of interviews.\nThe CUSP plan (Huye district, Southern Province) oper-\nates at the local level. Created in 2003 in a mixed rural/\nTable 2: Voluntary Health Insurance in Low-income Countries, World Health Survey, 2003\nNumber of\nrespondents\nwith health\ninsurance\nNumber of\nrespondents with\nvoluntary health\ninsurance\nPercentage of\ninsured\nrespondents with\nvoluntary health\ninsurance\nincome\nincome\nPercentage of insured respondents with voluntary health insurance\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nurban environment, it now insures between 5,000 and\n10,000 persons. Membership is voluntary and individual.\nfor every medicine obtained at health centers, and a coin-\nsurance of 10% of retail price for medicines received in the\nhospital. Medicine costs represented 80% of the total\nexpenditures of CUSP in 2006. The Gicumbi plan, created\nplans linked to health centers and 1 plan linked to a hos-\npital, and insuring 85% of the target population. Member-\nship is by family and voluntary, except for the very poor\nchosen by the community and automatically enrolled\nwithout paying premiums. Annual premiums average\nance for all medicines. Outpatient benefits only include\nmedicines on the national EML and prescribed by health\ncenters; some medicines not on the EML are covered by\nthe inpatient benefit. At the district level, the Gicumbi dis-\ntrict/regional authority buys medicines from the Rwanda\ncentral pharmacy (CAMERWA) at average wholesale price\nplus 5% margin and sets retail prices. Medicines expendi-\ntures of the Gicumbi plan increased by a factor of five after\nimplementation of the Ministry of Health decision to\ncover the very poor, suggesting a broader access to both\ncare and medicines by these populations. Most frequently\nused medicines are amoxycillin, paracetamol, quinine,\ncotrimozaxole, and penicillin V.\nAccording to the interviews, Gicumbi's policy of familial\nmembership and free-of-charge enrollment of some of the\npoorest in the community indicates an emphasis on\nequity in access of care. Its outpatient drug coverage\nrestrictions suggest an effort to control the quantity and\nappropriateness of medicines used that may be beneficial\nto its long-term financial sustainability. On the other\nhand, CUSP's policy of individual membership for every-\none without subsidy may be less oriented towards equity.\nIts strategy of fixed co-payment for every medicine\nobtained at the health center without coverage restrictions\nmay target over utilization without trying to influence the\nchoice of medicines.\nLike Rwanda authorities, those of Lao PDR have adopted\na national strategy to increase health resource mobiliza-\ntion for the poor. In April 2005, regulations for a nation-\nwide implementation of community based health\ninsurance were issued after three pilot CHI projects\nshowed promising results [16]. However, interviews con-\nfirmed that the current expansion is still at a very early\nTable 3: Distribution of Out-of-pocket Health Payments in Low-income Countries, World Health Survey, 2003\nOut-of-pocket Health Payments\nMedicines Inpatient Outpatient Traditional Others\n% % % % %\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nin five CHI schemes. Regulations seem to leave little\nautonomy to communities in day-to-day operations.\nRegardless of schemes, CHI membership is voluntary.\nFamily premiums are set by the government (average US$\n2.5\u00ad3.0 per family per month), and differ between urban\nand rural areas. Members receive medicines free of charge\nas long as these are on the national EML. District hospi-\ntals, which are the primary point of care, receive monthly\ncapitation payments from CHI plans for enrollees, and\nhave to report every month to a district management com-\nmittee on utilization and drug consumption. In one\nscheme, medicine costs in 2006 amounted to five million\ntotal expenditures. Plans have not extended coverage to\nthe very poor yet. One interviewed official noted a high\ndemand for care among CHI members, who tend to\nexpect premiums to be paid back in form of services. The\nvoluntary nature of membership was identified as a chal-\nlenge, because it leads members to leave schemes when\nthey do not have enough money to pay premiums, are dis-\nsatisfied with the quality of services provided, or perceive\nno need for care.\nDiscussion\nWe combined three complementary sources of data to\nexplore CHI medicines coverage in low-income countries.\nOur findings highlight the paucity of evidence about med-\nMedicine Payments as a Proportion of Out-of-pocket Expenditures by Income Quintiles in 20 Low-income Countries*, World\nMedicine Payments as a Proportion of Out-of-pocket Expenditures by Income Quintiles in 20 Low-income\nCountries*, World Health Survey, 2003. * Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Chad, Comoros, Cote D'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana,\nIndia, Kenya, Lao PDR, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Senegal, Vietnam, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.\nSRRUHVW\nULFKHVW\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nicines coverage and medicines utilization in community-\nbased health insurance programs, as well as the need for\nunderstanding better the role of medicines coverage in the\noverall health care financing strategy of low-income coun-\ntries. Several factors make systematic analysis of data\nabout the structure and processes of CHI plans particu-\nlarly challenging: small size, diversity of communities\nwhere they function, and lack of infrastructure or techni-\ncal capacity. Indeed, most available data come from\nschemes currently receiving assistance from governments,\nlarge micro-insurance networks, or international organi-\nzations[71,77] A plausible explanation could be that the\nfocus to date has been on strategic expansion and political\nacceptance of CHI rather than on CHI performance.

It will then be possible to collect and analyze data on\nthe availability and performance of medicines benefits\nwith the objective of improving the effectiveness of CHI\nplans.\nThe paucity of data may also reflect the fact that many CHI\nplans operate in environments where drug supply systems\nare so weak that covering medicines is not a realistic\noption. Nevertheless, as WHS data demonstrate, pay-\nments for medicines constitute about half of out-of-\npocket expenditures in low-income countries, and this\nproportion increases with poverty. Even in settings where\nmedicines supply may not be adequate, poor people still\nuse a substantial portion of their meager resources to buy\nmedicines.\nOverall, our findings confirm that voluntary insurance,\nwhich includes CHI, has a very low penetration in low-\nincome countries where private payments, representing\nover half of health care expenditures, are mostly made of\nout-of-pocket. Our literature review identified CHI plans\nin only one-third of low-income countries (19/54); in\nonly four countries did the plans cover more than 1% of\nthe population. Reasons may vary with national contexts.\nFor instance in Vietnam, the recent emphasis by the Social\nSecurity Agency on extending social health insurance cov-\nerage to poor populations is consistent with the relatively\nhigh percentage of voluntarily insured Vietnamese in the\nlowest income bracket (11.1%), and may explain why\nCHI has not been the focus of attention in this country in\nrecent years [78-81]. WHS data in several countries as well\nas interviews with CHI officials in Lao PDR and Rwanda\nshow that CHI plans experience substantial difficulties in\nreaching poor people: only 2% of WHS respondents\nenrolled in voluntary insurance belong to the lowest\nincome bracket. This, and the fact that we were unable to\nidentify CHI schemes in two-third of low income coun-\ntries, indicate that at present CHI reaches a minute pro-\nThe raison d'\u00eatre of CHI is to improve access to care for the\npoorest of the society. With low penetration among the\npoor, CHI does not yet achieve this goal. We believe that\na focus on inpatient and outpatient medicines coverage,\nadjusted to local circumstances, may be one strategy to\nencourage higher rates of voluntary enrollment in CHI by\nthe poor. CHI plans which cover medicines can devise\nstrategies to ensure that quality medicines are consistently\navailable at health centers, provide incentives (such as\nlower copayments) to use generics, and encourage appro-\npriate prescribing through education and administrative\nsystems. A key challenge will be to ensure financial sus-\ntainability of the CHI plans as enrollment and demand for\nmedicines increase.\nTo be successful, CHI must perform well in two areas: rev-\nenue collection and strategic purchasing [8]. Medicines\ncoverage policies have an important influence on both.\nLow voluntary enrollment is a major obstacle to scaling\nup CHI. Studies have shown that perceptions about qual-\nity of care affect CHI membership: coverage for and avail-\nability of medicines may be a key determinant of these\nexplicitly exclude expensive antiretroviral or tuberculosis\nmedicines from their benefits [11], or sell low-cost drugs\nat up to seven times the international retail price to\nrecover other costs [27]. Such coverage and pricing poli-\ncies may deter enrollment, and work against effective per-\nformance. CHI plans can also boost direct revenues by\nchanneling subsidies from public authorities and interna-\ntional donors, which seems to be the case in Rwanda. This\napproach has the potential to increase the ratio of prepaid\ncontributions to health care costs, an indicator of finan-\ncial protection; and to improve the financial stability of\nplans, allowing them to play a more active role in support-\ning premiums of the poorest, thereby reaching greater\nequity in access to medicines, another key performance\ndomain for CHI [8].\nFinancial access to medicines can be expanded by inte-\ngrating evidence about effectiveness, preferences of pro-\nviders, and medical needs of members in decisions about\nwhich medicines to cover, negotiating affordable prices\nwith providers, and working with local medicines outlets\nto ensure availability of medicines. The potential of CHI\nto influence prescription behavior and to control medi-\ncine costs is real. Even if they do not purchase medicines\ndirectly, CHI plans can negotiate payments with those\nwho purchase and supply medicines, and they can design\nincentives to use recommended medicines. In Benin, the\nAssociation d'Entraide des Femmes scheme preferentially\ncontracts with religious health care providers, because\nthese providers receive donations of brand name medi-\ncines that patients prefer, and sell them at discounted\nprices [61]. While this policy may be rational in achieving\nreliable supply and low prices in the short-term, the com-\nmitment to brand name rather than generic medicines\nand reliance on donations may be uneconomical and\nunsustainable as a long-term strategy.\nFrom our review, it is clear that appropriate tools to assist\nin designing and managing medicines benefit packages\nadapted to low-income environments do not exist yet,\ndespite the multiplicity of workshops and manuals target-\ning CHI administrators [83,84]. Training CHI managers to\nanalyze dispensing data in order to better understand and\nmanage medicines utilization, as is done in high-income\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ncountries, should be a high priority. CHI managers can\nplay a critical role if they are aware of medical needs of\ntheir members, are familiar with local care seeking and\nprescribing patterns, and understand local drug pricing\nand supply management issues. For example, incentives\nto prescribe and use generics may help to shift market\nshare away from commonly used brand medicines, exert\npressure to reduce the prices of these brand products, and\nincrease treatment affordability for both CHI plans and\npatients.\nThe paucity of medicines coverage data prevented us from\nexamining the role of CHI on improving access to medi-\ncines. Yet, interviews suggest that medicines represent\nbetween 65% and 80% of costs incurred by some plans,\nhighlighting the importance of monitoring medicines uti-\nlization and expenditures in CHI. Medicines coverage pol-\nicies can be used to control medicine expenditures and to\nimprove quality use by rewarding adequate prescription\nbehavior and by encouraging the use of effective and safe\nmedicines at lowest possible prices. In poor communities,\nCHI provides a critical institutional link between patients,\nproviders, and suppliers of medicines: it can play a key\nrole by negotiating with medicine suppliers, by adjusting\nmedicines coverage to local health care priorities, by dis-\nseminating education materials tailored to the commu-\nnity about quality use of medicines, by linking medicines\ncoverage to treatment adherence, and by rewarding pro-\nviders and community-based workers who follow treat-\nment guidelines. In this context, the large-scale social\nexperiment of CHI development in Rwanda is of signifi-\ncance, since it may bring important progress to the under-\nstanding of challenges faced by CHI in low-income\nsettings. Interviews with CHI administrators in Rwanda\nillustrate the interplay of government support and com-\nmunity involvement needed to design medicine benefits\nfor the poor. Much more could be learned in this setting\nby comparing membership and utilization among plans\nwith different medicine benefits, and by exploring the\nrelationship between medicines coverage and enrollment,\ncost recovery, and financial stability.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, our results show that the extent and nature\nof medicines coverage offered by CHI in low-income\ncountries are not well-reported at this time. Lack of access\nto medicines is a crucial issue in the developing world. We\nbelieve that better medicines coverage and well-designed\nmedicine benefits are part of a strategy to address this\nproblem. Further research is needed to characterize cur-\nrent coverage and utilization of essential medicines in\nCHI, to identify effective medicines benefit packages in\nlow-income settings, and to study the impacts of these\nbenefits on patterns of service utilization and clinical out-\ncomes. A better understanding of medicine policies in\nCHI can help national policymakers and insurers who\ndevelop strategies to improve health care financing sys-\ntems, prevent catastrophic health expenditures, and\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. To that\neffect, the Rwanda experience may constitute a unique\nopportunity to evaluate the contribution of CHI in\nimproving access of medicines, medicines utilization, and\nultimately health outcomes in low-income environments.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nCVV carried out the literature review, designed the struc-\ntured interviews, and drafted the manuscript.
