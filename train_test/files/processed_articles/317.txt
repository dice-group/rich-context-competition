A meta-\nanalysis of prospective studies, has reported that peoplein\nthe top third of baseline total leucocyte counts have about\ndisease (CHD) over the subsequent decade compared with\nthose in the bottom third of the population.2 The causal\nrelevance of this association, however, remains uncertain\nbecause it is not clear to what extent the association of the\ntotal leucocyte count with CHD risk merely reflects the\nimpact of established risk factors (such as cigarette\nsmoking), the extent of existing atherosclerosis, or both.\n\nc 2004 The European Society of Cardiology. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\nAs leucocytes have such a wide range of biological effects,\nsome potentially protective against vascular disease and\nsome potentially damaging, identification of more specific\n(and potentially stronger) associations between particular\ncomponents of the leucocyte count and CHD should help\nelucidate the association. For example, a particular role\nfor neutrophils has been suggested by reports of strong\nassociations between risk of Myocardial infarction and\ngenetic determinants of 5-lipoxygenase activating pro-\ntein, a pathway that includes products such as leukotriene\nB4, which is produced by stimulated neutrophils.3\nAvailable prospective data on differential leucocyte\ncounts and CHD are, however, limited and unsynthesised.\nTo help provide additional data and to clarify the existing\nevidence we have (i) reported previously unpublished\ndata from the first National Health and Nutrition Exami-\nnation Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS), (ii)\nsought summary data from other prospective studies with\npreviously unpublished data on differential leucocyte\ncounts, and (iii) conducted a meta-analysis of these newly\navailable data in the context of the limited published\nprospective data.\nMethods\nNHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study\nsample, of which 6913 attended baseline interviews and exam-\nsponse rate 70%). The NHEFS involved follow-up in four waves\nwere identified using routine data sources: death certificate\nwith underlying or non-underlying cause of death coded ICD-9\ncharge summaries for the follow-up period were obtained from\nany hospitals for which participants reported a stay. Cases were\ncounted only once, with the incidence date taken as the date of\nfirst hospital stay, or the date of death for fatal CHD cases with\nno prior record of hospitalisation. Blood samples were obtained\nat baseline for differential leucocyte count in 6913 individuals.\nDuplicate smears were made by the wedge technique from blood\npreserved with EDTA. Five qualified medical laboratory techni-\ncians counted 100 white blood cells using a microscope and re-\ncorded the white blood cell type using published cell-typing\nfollow-up, the statistical analysis excluded 80 (1.2%) individuals\nfrom racial groups other than \"white\" and \"black\", 1448 persons\nwith unknown baseline leucocyte count, systolic blood pressure,\nserum cholesterol, diabetes history, number of cigarettes\nsmoked or body mass index, four persons with extreme leuco-\ntive history of heart disease at baseline, leaving 4625 individuals\nin the present analysis. Incidence rates were calculated as\nnumber of CHD cases divided by total person years expressed in\nthousands. Hazard ratios were derived from Cox proportional\nhazards regression models using SAS statistical analysis software\n(PHREG procedure).11 There was some evidence of violation of\nthe proportional hazards assumption in the full data set, but not\nwhen the first 5 years of follow-up were excluded. But, as es-\ntimates were virtually identical by the two methods, results\nover the full follow-up period are presented in detail, but any\ndifferences between the adjusted estimates have been noted.\nMultivariable models included age at baseline, gender, ethnic-\nity, recreational activity, educational level, systolic blood\npressure, serum cholesterol, body mass index and history of\ndiabetes. Sex-specific regression models and combined models\nincluding interaction terms with sex were used in a subsidiary\nanalysis. All p-values quoted are derived from two-sided tests.\nMeta-analysis\nProspective epidemiological studies of leucocyte count and CHD\nwith >1 year follow-up, published before January 2003, were\nsought by computer-based searches scanning the reference lists\nof all relevant studies and review articles, hand-searching of\nrelevant journals and correspondence with authors of studies.\nComputer searches in Medline used keywords relating to leuco-\ncytes (e.g., leucocyte, leukocyte, white blood cell, neutrophil,\neosinophil, basophil, monocyte, granulocyte, lymphocyte) in\ncombination with coronary heart disease (e.g., coronary heart\ndisease, isch[a]emic heart disease, vascular disease, myocardial\ninfarction and arteriosclerosis) and study design (e.g., prospec-\ntive or cohort). All available studies that reported on differential\nleucocyte counts in relation to CHD were included. In addition, we\ncorresponded with authors of all previously published prospective\nstudies of total leucocyte count to obtain, where available, tab-\nular data on differential leucocyte counts and CHD risk. The fol-\nlowing information was abstracted from each study: geographical\nlocation, study size, number and definition of CHD cases, assay (or\ncounting) method, mean age and percentage male cases, follow-\nup duration sampling method, and degree of adjustment for po-\ntential confounders. Adjustment as shown in the figure is denoted\nas: \u00fe \u00fe \u00fe for age, sex, smoking plus some other established\nvascular risk factors; \u00fe \u00fe \u00fe \u00fe for these plus markers of socio-\neconomic status; \u00fe \u00fe \u00fe \u00fe \u00fe for these plus evidence of pre-ex-\nisting vascular disease. In studies with published results on\ndifferential leucocyte counts we corresponded with investigators\nto check our estimates and seek tabular data on the most up-to-\ndate results. Results were expressed as the adjusted log risk ratio\nbetween individuals in the top third of the distribution of the\nleucocyte component count and those in the bottom third of\ndisease-free individuals. Where this log risk ratio (and its stan-\ndard error) was not available as a comparison of extreme thirds\nfrom the published report or from correspondence with investi-\ngators, it was estimated from the reported risk ratios (e.g., RR\nper SD, per unit, or other comparisons, such as top and bottom\nquarters) using log-linear scaling and assuming normality of the\nleucocyte count distribution, as previously described.2 Fixed and\nrandom effect summary estimates were calculated for each\nleucocyte component. Heterogeneity between study estimates\nwas assessed by standard v2 tests,12 although potentially relevant\nsubgroup analyses (such as by age and sex) could not be reliably\ninvestigated since individual data were not available in studies\nother than the NHEFS. Results from studies with fewer than 50\nincident CHD cases were treated separately in the analysis, but\ncombined for presentation in the figure. To make some allowance\nfor multiple comparisons, 99% confidence intervals were used.\nResults\nNew evidence from NHANES I Epidemiologic\nfollow-up study\nNine hundred and fourteen incident CHD cases were re-\ncorded among the 4625 individuals in the present analy-\nsis, who had a mean age at baseline of 48.1 years (46%\nTable 1 Summary of CHD incidence and rate ratios by thirds of total leucocyte baseline counts and of leucocyte components in the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study\nLeucocyte component Third No. CHD cases/\nNo. at risk\nCHD incidence/\nRate ratios and 95% CI, adjusted for\nAge and sex Age, sex and smoking Age, sex, smoking and risk factorsb;d\nIn analyses of leucocyte components as continuous variables, rate ratios (95% CI) per 1 standard deviation increase, adjusted for age, sex, smoking and risk factors were as follows: total leucocytes 1.02\nIn sex-specific analyses, rate ratios (95% CI) involving comparisons of those in the middle and highest thirds, respectively, with those in the bottom third, adjusted for age, smoking and risk factors were as\na py, person years.\nb Systolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol, body mass index, history of diabetes, recreational activity, educational level and ethnic group.\nc Granulocytes \u00bc neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils.\nd In analyses excluding incident cases in the first 5 years of follow-up, rate ratios (95% CI) involving comparisons of those in the middle and highest thirds, respectively, with those in the bottom third, adjusted for\nAssociations between differential leucocyte count and incident coronary heart disease 1289\nTable 2 Characteristics of available long-term prospective studies with data on differential leucocyte counts and CHD risk\nCohort (reference) Geographical\nlocation\nPopulation/\nsampling\nmethodc\nYear of\nbaseline\nsurvey\nNo. participants\nat baseline\nPercent\nmale\nAge range at\nbaseline (years)\nMean age\nof cases\n(years)\nNo. incident\nCHD cases\nMean\nfollow-up\n(years)\nType of\nCHD cases\nMethod of\nleucocyte\ncounting\nNHEFS USA National framework/\nprobability\ndeath\nMicroscopic\nexamination\nARIC17 USA Listing of households/\nrandom\ndeath\nAutomated\ncounter\nCaerphilly and\ndeath\nTechnicon\nautomated\ncounter\nHiroshima and\nJapan Atomic bomb survivors\nin two cities/random\ndeath/\nanginaa\nNewbauers\nchamber and\nWrights stain\nParis Prospective\nFrance Civil servants and rail\nworkers/complete aged\ndeath/\nanginab\nCoulter counter\nSantiago19 Spain Coronary angiography\npatients/complete\nBruneck13 Italy Population register/\nrandom\ndeath\nMicroscopic\nexamination\nNS, not stated; NHEFS, first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) Epidemiologic Follow-up Study; ARIC, Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities.\na Approximately 20 cases were defined by angina pectoris alone.\nb Approximately 20 cases were defined by angina pectoris alone.\nc Sampling method: random, a randomly selected subset of eligible persons was invited to participate; complete, all eligible persons in the study population were invited to participate; probability, random\nsampling with over-sampling of specific groups such as women of reproductive age, the elderly.\nmale) and a median follow-up of 18.3 years.

Further adjustment for baseline\nlevels of smoking and other established risk factors\nweakened these associations to non-significance (Table\n1). Similar results were obtained in subsidiary analyses\nrestricted to men and women separately, and there was\nno significant interaction between sex and any individual\nleucocyte component in fully adjusted analyses.\nMeta analysis\nFive published studies of differential leucocyte counts\nand CHD were identified, plus two further cohorts (NHEFS\nand the Bruneck Study13) with previously unpublished\nfindings. Overall, these studies involved a total of 1764\nCHD cases with a weighted mean age at baseline of 57\nyears (55% male) and a mean follow-up of approximately\n12 years (Table 2). Apart from a few dozen cases of angina\nreported in two of the smaller studies,14;15 all CHD cases\ninvolved either death, certified as due to coronary heart\ndisease (generally using ICD criteria) or confirmed non-\nfatal myocardial infarction (generally using WHO crite-\nria). In a combined analysis of the top third versus the\nbottom third of baseline leucocyte counts, the risk ratios\ntrophil counts, respectively (Fig. 1). It should be noted\nthat these two risk ratios are not independent because, as\nmentioned above, neutrophils are included in the granu-\nlocyte count. There was, however, substantial hetero-\ngeneity among the studies contributing to each of these\nestimates (v2\nrespectively), with the majority due to differences be-\ntween the two largest studies. Such heterogeneity implies\na need to factor greater uncertainty into the CI around\nthe overall relative risks than is provided by those above,\nsuch as by use of a random effects model that takes ad-\nditional account of study variation (the risk ratios for CHD\nmodel, in those with higher granulocyte and neutrophil\ncounts, respectively).

(*) \"Cases\" refer to incident confirmed non-\nfatal myocardial infarction or death due to coronary heart disease. \"Controls\" refer to individuals who were not defined as cases at the time of analysis.\n(y) Although all studies measured similar component cell types (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes and lymphocytes), results are included in\nthe figure only where adjusted estimates were available in the published literature or through correspondence with investigators.\nAssociations between differential leucocyte count and incident coronary heart disease 1291\nseven contributing studies (Fig. 1); (v2\nDiscussion\nAs it has been proposed that certain leucocyte compo-\nnents, such as neutrophils, are particularly relevant to\ndata on differential leucocyte counts should help to clarify\nthe nature of the associations previously observed be-\ntween the total leucocyte count and CHD risk.2 The pres-\nent meta-analysis of 1764 incident cases of CHD from\nseven long-term prospective studies, involving a total of\n30,374 participants, provides the most comprehensive\nassessment so far of the potential impact of differential\nleucocyte counts on CHD.\nThe interpretation of the present evidence, however,\nis complicated by potentially important differences in the\ntwo largest studies, which together comprise approxi-\nmately 80% of the available CHD cases. Whereas there was\nless scope for random error in the NHEFS results (since it\ncomprised the largest single study in the meta-analysis,\ninvolving 914 incident CHD cases), likely imprecision in its\nmanual method of counting leucocytes (even with trained\nlaboratory staff) may have resulted in under-estimation of\nthe true associations between leucocyte components and\nCHD. By contrast, the ARIC study, involving 527 incident\nCHD cases used an automated leucocyte counter. More-\nover, the ARIC study may have defined CHD more precisely\nby using clinical review against standardised criteria to\nsupplement routine CHD ascertainment methods, whilst\nthe NHEFS relied on routine CHD ascertainment methods\nalone. So, although confidence intervals were wider in the\nARIC study than those in NHEFS, the more extreme asso-\nciations observed in ARIC between elevated neutrophil\ncounts (and, hence, also granulocyte counts) and CHD risk\nmay have been related to its greater precision. By com-\nparison, associations of CHD with lymphocyte and mono-\ncyte counts observed in the present meta-analysis were\nprobably weaker than those for granulocyte and neutro-\nphil counts (Fig. 1).\nIn summary, although our study indicates that neu-\ntrophil count may be a somewhat stronger predictor of\nCHD risk than other leucocyte components, more reliable\nquantification of its predictive ability will require fresh\nevidence from prospective studies involving large num-\nbers of CHD cases, with serial measurements of leuco-\ncyte components using optimal assay methods, and\nmeasurement of other inflammatory biomarkers.16 As it\nis likely that the neutrophil count is, at best, only a\ncomparatively modest predictor of CHD in general pop-\nulations, there is a need for sufficiently powered studies,\nto help assess the separate and combined impact of in-\nflammatory markers on CHD risk.\n"
