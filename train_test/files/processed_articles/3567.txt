We determined the gene expression for prorenin, renin, prorenin\nreceptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme, angiotensinogen and angiotensin II Type 1 receptor, on tissue sections and in\ncultured human primary retinal pigment epithelial and iris pigment epithelial (RPE/IPE) cell lines, using both qualitative and\nquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Protein expression was studied using indirect\nimmunofluorescence (IF).\nResults: Almost all components of the classical RAS were found at high levels, at both the transcript and protein level,\nin the eyes' uvea and retina; and at lower levels in the cornea, conjunctiva and sclera. There was a much lower level of\nexpression in the reference cultured RPE/IPE cells lines.\nConclusion: This study describes the distribution of RAS in the normal adult human eye and demonstrates the existence\nof an independent ocular RAS, with uveal and retinal tissues showing the highest expression of RAS components. These\npreliminary findings provide scope for examination of additional components of this system in the human eye, as well as\npossible differential expression under pathological conditions.\n",

It has been implicated in a\nvariety of eye diseases, including uveitis, macular degen-\neration, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma.1 Classical\nRAS originates with renin (REN), an aspartyl protease\nderived from its inactive precursor pro-renin, within the\njuxtaglomerular cells of the kidney.\nREN cleaves its substrate angiotensinogen (AGT), an\n2 globulin produced by the liver, in order to form the\ndecapeptide angiotensin I (AngI). Subsequent cleavage of\nAng I by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE),\nresults in formation of angiotensin II (AngII), an important\nvasoconstrictor, trophic, angiogenic and pro-inflammatory\noctapeptide (Figure 1). ACE also metabolises bradykinin,\na powerful vasodilator involved in mediation of the inflam-\nmatory response. The RAS was initially considered to be a\nExpression of classical components\nof the renin-angiotensin system\nin the human eye\nAndrew JR White1,2, Sarat C Cheruvu3, Maria Sarris4, Surabhi S\nLiyanage3, Eugenie Lumbers4, Jeanie Chui3, Denis Wakefield3\nand Peter J McCluskey1,3\n Keywords\nAngiotensin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, choroid, conjunctiva, cornea, eye, normal human eye, receptor, renin,\nretina, sclera, uvea\n1Save Sight Institute, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia\nWestmead Millennium Institute, University of Sydney, Sydney,\nAustralia\nSchool of Medical Sciences, University of New South Wales, Sydney,\nAustralia\nDepartment of Physiology, University of New South Wales, Sydney,\nAustralia\nCorresponding author:\nAndrew JR White, Department of Ophthalmology, B4a, Westmead\nHospital, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia.\nEmail: andrew.white@sydney.edu.au\nOriginal Article\n60 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(1)\nclassical endocrine system with activity restricted to sys-\ntemic effects; however, recent studies demonstrate local-\nised RAS within numerous tissues, such as the endothelium\nof the vascular system, brain, adrenal glands, thymus and\nreproductive tract. In addition, there is mounting molecu-\nlar, biological and immunohistochemical evidence for a\nlocalised RAS in the human eye.2\u00ad7 Subsequent work in\nthis area established not only the localised presence of all\nthe constituents of the RAS, but also their expression and\nactive transcription within human ocular tissue.3, 5, 8\u00ad10\nPublished data to date points to the existence of a local\nRAS within the eye, independent of systemic precursor\nsubstrates and peptides.11\nIt has been proposed that the intra-retinal RAS may\nhave a physiological role in the neurotransmission and\nmodulation of retinal ganglion cells.12 AngII appears to\nhave a multifaceted role in the physiology of the eye; and\nstudies demonstrate its influence on the vasculature of the\neye,13,14 aqueous humour outflow regulation and intraocu-\nlar pressure (IOP) control.2,15 In addition, its presence in\ncertain types of neural cells in the retina, such as M\u00fcller\nglial cells, has implicated AngII in ocular neuromodula-\ntion of the pathogenesis of vasoproliferative disorders,\nVEGF-induced angiogenesis within the retina18\u00ad22 in dis-\nease states such as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)23\u00ad25\nand diabetic retinopathy.24 Plasma AngII is also believed\nto play an important role in mediating the influence of sys-\ntemic RAS on intraocular RAS.26\nRAS is also implicated in other disease processes in the\neye, including inflammatory disorders.27\u00ad30 AngII is shown\nto enhance vascular permeability in an inflammatory set-\nting, predominantly through the induction of chemokines\nand adhesion molecules, as well as being responsible for\nrecruitment of inflammatory cells.31 Inhibition of the RAS\nwas also demonstrated to have a neuroprotective effect in\nglaucoma models, such as for ocular hypertension,32 reper-\nfusion33 and deaxotomised retina explants.34\nThe aim of our study was to provide a comprehensive\npicture of the RAS gene and protein expression patterns in\nnormal adult human ocular tissue, which will aid in target-\ning treatments for a variety of RAS-mediated eye diseases.\nMaterials and methods\nTissue specimens\nWe obtained 10 fresh and 5 fixed whole human eyes, post-\nmortem, from the Lions NSW Eye Bank in Sydney,\nAustralia. Informed consent was obtained. The experimen-\ntal protocols followed the tenets of the Declaration of\nHelsinki and the study was approved by the Human\nResearch Ethics Committee of the University of NSW.\nThe cornea and conjunctiva of the 10 fresh eye speci-\nmens had been removed for use in corneal graft surgery;\ntherefore, these tissues were unavailable for RT-PCR test-\ning. Exclusion criteria for all specimens were having\ninflammatory ocular disease and pre-mortem ocular infec-\ntion. Other ocular comorbidities are noted in Tables 1 and\n2. We did not have detailed information on systemic\ncomorbidities of the donors, beyond what was relevant for\ntransplant safety. Tables 1 and 2 highlight the clinical fea-\ntures of the 15 cases.\nTissue dissection\nEnucleation of the globe was performed post-mortem by\nan ophthalmic surgeon. The surgeon cut a further circular\nincision around the eyeball, slightly anterior to the inser-\ntion of the lateral rectus muscle, to remove the cornea and\nbulbar conjunctiva for corneal transplant/graft purposes.\nUpon enucleation and removal of the cornea and conjunc-\ntiva for use by the Eye Bank, further tissue dissection was\ncarried out under an optical microscope, to minimise any\ntissue-to-tissue contamination. The iris, ciliary body, neu-\nral retina, RPE and attached choroid were dissected from\nthe globe, sliced into fine pieces and placed into individual\neppendorf tubes for ribonucleic acid (RNA) extraction.\nThe entire ciliary body and iris (approximately 50 \u00ad 100\nmg each) were small enough to only need one tube each;\nhowever, the whole retina and choroid (approximately 200\nmg each) were split across three tubes each, due to the\nlarger amount of these tissues in the eye. A sample of\napproximately 100 mg in weight of sclera was also used.\nCell cultures\nWe purchased human primary IPE and RPE cells with epi-\nthelial cell medium from ScienCell Research Laboratories\n(San Diego, CA) and cultured them as previously\nFigure 1.

We isolated RNA,\nperforming reverse transcription and PCR with SYBR\ngreen dye. A total of 50 positive (RT +) and 50 negative\n(RT \u00ad) samples were available for RT-PCR, from five ocu-\nlar tissue samples from each of the 10 donor eyes. We con-\nstructed positive control standard curves for relative\nquantification. We used the standard curve method for\nrelative quantification, to calculate unknown sample\nexpression as a fold expression over the endogenous con-\ntrol gene (GAPDH).\nWe performed PCR for the AGTR1 Transcript 5 (AT1\nreceptor) gene on synthesised cDNA, in accordance with\nthe Quantace SensiMix protocol (Bioline, Sydney,\nAustralia). As the primer set used produced an amplicon\ntoo large for RT-PCR, we used qualitative PCR for the\nAGTR1 transcript variant 5 gene, instead of quantitative\nRT-PCR. We ran the amplified products from the AGTR1\nPCR in a 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis\nImmunohistochemical analysis\nWhole eyes (n = 4) obtained from the Lions Eye Bank\nwere fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 3 \u00ad 5 days\nand then processed overnight (VIP Tissue Processor,\nOlympus, Notting Hill, VIC, Australia). The whole eyes\nwere then paraffin embedded and sectioned.\nIPE and RPE cells at passage 4'were cultured in epithe-\nlial cell medium to confluence in chamber slides. The cells\nwere washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), then\nreverse osmosis water for 10 minutes, followed by Tris\nbuffered saline (TBS) washes prior to the immunostaining\nprocedure detailed below.\nImmunofluorescence staining was performed on 5\u00b5m\nthick paraffin sections, mounted on coated slides (Vision\nBioSystems, Melbourne, Australia; Leica MicroSystems,\nSydney, Australia), and allowed them to dry overnight in an\noven set at 37oC. Paraffin slides from each eye were depar-\naffinised and rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was performed\nin a microwave, using Epitope Retrieval Solution pH 6.0\n(Novacastra, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) for 10 minutes (3\nTable 1.

Sections were treated with 0.03% Sudan black\nfor 2 mins and washing in running water, before mounting\nwith Prolong Gold antifade media.\nImages were taken using the Olympus Fluoview pro-\ngram and original slides were imaged using a confocal\nmicroscope (Olympus FV1000 Inverted Laser Scanning\nMicroscope).\nResults\nGene expression\nQualitative and quantitative RT-PCR.Qualitative PCR\nshowed the AGTR1-transcript for the AT1\nreceptor to be\npresent in RPE choroid samples from donor eyes only\n(Figure 2). Quantitative PCR was used to determine the\nrelative expression of ACE, AGT, REN/prorenin and\nprorenin receptor (ATP6AP2) genes. Only ocular samples\nwhich expressed levels of GAPDH (the control gene)\nabove the detectable limit of the assay in three or more\nsamples were quantified. Relative gene expression as a\nfold difference in reference to the calibrator samples was\ncalculated. The relative expression of these genes is shown\nin Figure 3.\nPatterns and locations of protein\nimmunoreactivity\nProtein expression and localisation of RAS components\n(AGT, prorenin, prorenin receptor, ACE and AT1\nreceptor)\nwithin ocular tissue was determined using indirect immu-\nnofluorescence. Figure 4 is representative of the staining\nobtained for each of the RAS components tested in the eye.\nIn this case, we show staining for the AT1\nreceptor across\nthe eye.\nThe staining was assessed semi-quantitatively by\nthree independent observers (other staff in the lab uncon-\nnected to the project) looking at the images with their\nnaked eyes, on the computer screen. A score of `0' was\ngiven for no staining visible, `1' for some staining and\n`2' for intense staining. The benchmark to decide what\nconstituted no staining or maximum staining was based\non control (non-eye) tissues, which had no discernible\nstaining or diffuse, intense staining, respectively. We\nchose the control tissues based on tissues where that pro-\ntein was known to exist, such as REN in the kidney. The\nscores for each individual slide were then averaged to\nget a total mean score between 0 \u00ad 2 for each slide.\nFigure 5 shows how intensity scoring was derived in the\ncontrol samples.\nTable 3.

Previous studies on RAS in the human\neye looked at mRNA expression only, and not across all\nstructures of the eye.3 The presence and active transcription\nof genes encoding RAS proteins, within different types of\neye tissue, are further evidence of a localised RAS in the eye.\nImportantly, this study demonstrated a strong expression\nof RAS mRNA and protein in uveal and retinal tissues,\nrelative to the corneoscleral layer. This finding has impor-\ntant implications in uveo-retinal disease, as these tissues\nare more likely to produce angiotensin in large amounts.\nThe proinflammatory, profibrotic, mitogenic and vasocon-\nstrictor properties of angiotensin II, which contribute to\nvascular and inflammatory disease by altering vascular\ntone, structural remodelling and endothelial dysfunc-\ntion36\u00ad38 are likely to be the same mechanisms that promote\nmany RAS-related diseases of the eye.\nAlmost all layers of the retina were positive for RAS\nproteins, which correlates with previous findings of a\nneuromodulatory or possible neurotransmitter role for\nangiotensin II in the retina.8,16 The modulation of reactive\noxygen species (ROS) generation via an AT1\nR-mediated\nmechanism, demonstrated in in vitro glaucoma models to\nconfer a neuroprotective effect, lends weight to this\nhypothesis.33,34 ROS `bursts' are implicated as a trigger\nmechanism for apoptotic cascades in the eye and optic\nHuman RPE and IPE cell cultures showed either low or\nno expression of the RAS constituents at either transcript\nor protein levels. Contributing factors could include differ-\nences between functionality in the in vitro and in vivo set-\nting, the conditions under which the cells were cultured\nand the presence of other cell types within the epithelial\nlayer being the source of RAS proteins.\nFigure 5.

There\nwere significant variations in expression of RAS compo-\nnents between donors. The medication histories of our\ndonors were unavailable; and therefore, the effects of med-\nications that could have influenced the results of this study\nare unknown. The impact of anti-RAS medications, such\nas ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists, on\nocular tissues may explain significant differences in pro-\ntein expression. RNA degradation in the RPE and other\nocular tissues, due to the time between donor death and\ntissue processing (mean time: 11.9 h) may have also been\na factor. Furthermore, only a total of 15 human eyes were\navailable for this exploratory study. A much larger sample\nsize would overcome many of these difficulties, as well as\nallow a direct comparison between RAS expression levels\nin healthy and diseased eyes.\n"
