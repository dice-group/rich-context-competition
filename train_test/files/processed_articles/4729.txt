Within a Holocaust education exhibit, for exam-\nple, narratives of victims, perpetrators, bystanders, and res-\ncuers of whom a few are designated the Righteous Among\nthe Nations for their courage may be incorporated to engage\nparticipants in reflection and learning (Albert, 2013; Glover\nResearch has documented that participation in free-choice\nlearning is an interactive process between the learner and the\nprogram, exhibit, or space (Boyer & Roth, 2005; Falk &\n2015).

These bodies of literature informed\nthe lenses through which we grounded and viewed the explo-\nration of free-choice learning within the Righteous Among\nthe Nations exhibits.\nFree-Choice Learning\nLearning is a complex process. Merriam (2001) states,\nThe learning process is much more than systematic acquisition\nand storage of information. It is also making sense of our lives,\ntransforming not just what we learn but the way we learn, and it\nis absorbing, imagining, intuiting, and learning informally with\nFree-choice learning is self-directed (Ausburn, 2002), and a\nparticipant can choose how to be engaged and challenged\nthrough the \"flow of experience\" (Falk & Dierking, 2002, p.\n17) at a particular learning event.As in participating at exhib-\nits, Falk and Dierking (2002) identify choice and control as\nimportant elements of free-choice learning. Learner motiva-\ntions in free-choice learning settings are related to learner\nidentity and can be \"emotional sites of learning\" (Parrish,\ning, which may be seen as a broad category including any\nform of learning that is neither formal nor nonformal\nAlthough informal learning often is identified as learning\nfor enrichment, several studies emphasize the importance of\ninformal learning in professional development (Berg &\nVan der Heijden, Boon, van der Klink, & Meijs, 2009). In the\nUnited States, Berg and Chyung (2008) found that informal\nlearning activities were more beneficial for practitioners'\nknowledge acquisition of learning and performance improve-\nment than from formal training. Level of interest in one's\ncurrent field was the most significant indicator for engage-\nment in informal learning (Berg & Chyung, 2008). Grenier's\ndocents employed at four history-themed museums found\nthat while formal training and continuing education were ini-\ntially used, informal and incidental learning were cited as\nimportant to the development of the expertise of docents.\nThis study serves an example of informal educational oppor-\ntunities intersecting with continuing professional education\nand demonstrating the importance of integrating informal\nlearning into the professional development of educators\nThe free-choice learning within exhibits allows meaning\nmaking with the aim of broadening the lens of learners.\nAlthough there is the potential for creating communities of\nunderstanding, these communities can be fragmented or\noverlapped in complex ways in free-choice learning environ-\nments particularly related to international topics, which can\n(2013) challenges educators and researchers to constantly\nquestion \"Whose memory of the Holocaust?\" (p. 56) is being\ncommunicated within museums. Narratives about the\nHolocaust are constructed within specific cultural, political,\nand societal settings and are a mechanism to communicate\nstories in particular socio-historical contexts (Albert, 2013).\nNarratives\nNarratives are one of the fundamental ways in which humans\n1996). \"When we think of narratives we typically think of\nstories, accounts of events that happened, to us or to others,\nand use stories to make sense of the world and to make sense\nof their own experiences (Clark, 2001; Clark & Rossiter,\nare able to draw connections between different experiences\nand make a more coherent understanding of those experi-\nences. Narratives are also deeply connected to our under-\nstanding of self and identity. As Rossiter (1999) explains,\n\"As we understand the world and our experiences narra-\ntively, so also do we understand and construct the self as nar-\nrative\" (p. 62). Narrative understanding also is connected to\nhow we make sense of our experiences over time. People\nmake sense of their experiences and personal development\nover the life course through personal narratives in which they\ncan see and reflect on changes (Clark & Rossiter, 2008).\nThus, narratives and stories are one of the main mechanisms\nthrough which humans make sense of their life experiences.\nIf narratives are how we make meaning of social life and\nexperience, how do we learn from narratives? Clark and\nRossiter (2008) point to three parts involved in this process.\nFirst is the hearing of stories. Stories not only \"draw\" us in\nbut require us to call upon past experiences to make sense of\nthe narrative we are currently hearing or reading. Second is\nthe telling of stories. In particular, the \"learner\" becomes the\nactor, rather than the receiver of storytelling. In this regard,\nthe teller must learn the story to be able to tell it appropri-\nately. Finally, the third and probably most important element\nof stories is how learners take a story, make sense of it, and\nthen use it. Clark and Rossiter (2008) refer to this as recog-\nnizing stories, where learners begin to understand the funda-\nmental narrative character of experiences. They begin to see\nthemselves as \"constituted and narratively positioned\" (Clark\n& Rossiter, 2008, p. 65) within social and cultural contexts\nwhere learners place their personal narratives in the larger\nsociocultural narrative in which they exist. They can then\ndraw connections and make sense of how they as individuals\nfit into the bigger picture. Spaces where learners can recog-\nnize their \"narrative situatedness\" (Clark & Rossiter, 2008,\np. 66) within larger cultural and social narratives may be\nYelich Biniecki and Donley 3\nparticularly fruitful places for emancipatory possibilities and\nlearning. This positionality, or how one is individually and\nsocially situated within social systems, places learners in a\nlocation in which they can be critical of larger narratives, and\nquestion underlying assumptions and embedded power\nrelationships.\nMeaning making with narratives in an exhibit is an inter-\nactive learning process (Polkinghorne, 1988) and can help\nthe learner specifically make meaning of individual and\nsocial identities (S\u00e4lj\u00f6, 2005). \"Narratives also challenge\nexisting ways of thinking and thereby facilitate change and\nnarratives can be used to help participants imagine or place\nthemselves in a certain point in time and history and connect\nto their current experiences. Grever, de Bruijn, and van\nBoxtel (2012) propose that narratives on heritage education\nexhibits, such as the transatlantic slave trade, are facilitators\nin negotiating and mediating historical distance, \"a configu-\nration of temporality and engagement\" (p. 875). One could\nview negotiating and mediating historical distance as a way\nto engage with the past to make that history closer or less\n\"foreign,\" which involves reflection in learning.\nRole of Reflection in Learning\nReflection is referred to as part of the process of constructing\nmemories are used to make meaning at exhibits (Afonso &\nof reflection as bush-like with the first conceptualization of\nreflection as a mental activity and then with many branches\nof thinking about what reflection really is, what it encom-\npasses, and what the theories have in common. Reflection\nplays a role in learning (Hooper-Greenhill, 1999; Le Cornu,\nhelping learners make sense of current experiences, then\nreflection on these past experiences may play an important\nrole in learning. The ways learners construct knowledge and\nwhy and how they reflect, for example, at an exhibit, are part\nof the learning process and may be intricately connected to\nthe context of the learning.\nMoon (1999) describes reflection as an input and output\nmodel viewing the inputs to reflection as theories, con-\nstructed knowledge, or feelings. The outputs of reflection\nmay be diverse. For example, the process of learning may be\nan output of reflection. Emotions may be an input and an\nChallenging assumptions and positions of power\n(Brookfield, 1990) may be an output of reflection. Freire's\n(2013) conscientization as part of learner empowerment and\nemancipation may follow reflection. Self-development,\nincluding self-awareness, which may include a perspective\ntransformation within groups or individuals (Mezirow,\nof reflective thought focuses on the outcome of action and\ndepicts non-reflective action and reflective action. Reflection\nin the context of deep learning suggests that a person has\nsome awareness of something being learned or new knowl-\nedge constructed. However, Le Cornu (2005) suggests that\nreflection may be surface, deep, or tacit and that reflection\nmay involve a progressive internalization or externalization\nin the forms of action. Reflection informs the development\nof the self, relating to one's identity (Le Cornu, 2009), and\nthis identity development and meaning making can be an\nemotional learning process (Dirkx, 2008). Often viewed as\nbarriers to learning in the past, emotions may be a facilitator\nHolocaust museums are noted as \"agents of change\"\nand prompt critical reflection and transformative learning,\nincluding within areas of human resource development such\nas the military, law enforcement, medical communities, and\nleadership training. Gauging interpretations, learning, and\nreflections in such museums remains a challenge because of\nthe dynamic nature of the informal learning environment\n(Ciardelli & Wasserman, 2011). Connecting the past with\ncurrent ethical and moral dilemmas is part of the reflection\nand learning process in Holocaust museums (Albert, 2013).\nThe Holocaust and the Righteous Among the\nNations of the World\nEach context of free-choice learning provides a different\ndimension to explore; particularly, Holocaust education is an\nimportant context where we can learn about participants'\nperceptions of learning and their meaning making of current,\nhistorical, ethical, and moral challenges (Grenier, 2010).\nComing to power in Germany in January 1933, the Nazis\nbelieved that Germans were racially superior and identified\ngroups, including Jews, the disabled, sexual minorities,\nRoma, and others to be targeted for persecution and extermi-\nnation (United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, n.d.).\nThe Nazi\u00adGerman regime and collaborators systematically\npersecuted and murdered 6 million Jews, the Holocaust\n(United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, n.d.). It is esti-\nmated that the Nazis and collaborators murdered at least 3\nmillion Jewish citizens of Poland and 1.9 million non-Jewish\nPolish civilians during World War II (WWII) (United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum, n.d.). Enslaving Slavic peo-\nples also was an aspect of the Nazi\u00adGerman ideology. Within\nareas of resistance in occupied Poland, Nazis engaged in ran-\ndom killings and mass deportations (United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum, n.d.). It is within this life-threatening,\nhorrific context that Jewish resisters and Gentile Righteous\nAmong the Nations acted. Yad Vashem: The World Center\nfor Holocaust Research (n.d.), states,\nIn Eastern Europe, the Germans executed not only the people\nwho sheltered Jews, but their entire family as well . . . Only few\nassumed the entire responsibility for the Jews' survival. It is\n4 SAGE Open\nmostly the last group that qualifies for the title of the Righteous\nAmong the Nations. (para. 6, 10)\nAlthough Holocaust education is not a new area of\ninquiry, this study's exploration focuses on free-choice\nlearning through exhibits highlighting Poles deemed the\n\"The Righteous Among the Nations of the World\" by the\nState of Israel. Hidden stories of Polish resistance and\nRighteous Among the Nations in Poland and other Central\nand Eastern European countries were not discussed during\nkind was not to be tolerated under the authoritarian regime\nand ideology (Institute of National Remembrance, n.d.).\nThe Institute of National Remembrance, a Polish academic,\narchive, and education center, strives to document these\nstories and other crimes against Poland, but this documen-\ntation often is challenging due to the complexity of such\ndata collection.\nHolocaust education is an important context to explore as\nthe Holocaust is an event unique to human history and after\nwhich the term genocide was formally used at the United\nNations in addressing crimes against humanity. As there are\nfewer survivors, we will need to rely on exhibits, stories,\nfilms, and other ways of sharing to continue to document and\ntell these stories. Communities with less religious, ethnic,\nand national origin diversity may have less of an opportunity\nfor face-to-face engagement with diversity and related inter-\nnational issues. Therefore, the context of our study provides\nan important area to explore learners' meaning making at\nprograms to better inform program planning and improve\nstrategies for learner engagement.\nThe focus of this study is not without controversy, and\nresearchers often struggle to make meaning of their own\nexperiences and ethics related to Holocaust education\n(Tinberg, 2005). Emphasizing rescuers may be viewed as\novershadowing the evil of the perpetrators and bystanders as\nwell as portraying Jews as passive victims. We as researchers\nfound ourselves questioning the complexity of our position-\nalities, which is noted as a process for educators in Holocaust\neducation (Lindquist, 2010). Although most participants\ncommunicated feeling horrified by learning more about the\nHolocaust, a local news network received one anti-Semitic\nand anti-Polish response about an exhibit, which was a focus\nof this study. To know these responses continue to exist,\nunderscores to us that Holocaust education is an important\narea of remembrance and learning.\nIn a global study, the Anti-Defamation League (2014)\ndocumented that 46% of the respondents had never heard of\nthe Holocaust, with the percentage of 23% in the Americas.\nIncorporating narratives and uncovering stories are part of\nHolocaust education (Parrish, 2010). Therefore, our aim\nwithin the study is not to create a \"competition over suffer-\nany group, but to understand learning through this inquiry of\nan international education context in which additional\nstudies are needed to further the field (Taylor, 2012; Yelich\nThis study aims to explore meaning making through the\nlenses of free-choice learning, narratives, reflection, and\nHolocaust education, with a specific focus on the Righteous\nAmong the Nations of the World from Poland. Investigating\nlearner meaning making of the RighteousAmong the Nations\nexhibits within the pubic space of a library in a rural com-\nmunity can inform public pedagogy work within the realm of\ninternational education in settings across the United States\nsuch as the one we explore in this study.\nMethod\nThis qualitative interpretive study focused on understanding\nhow individuals made meaning about their experiences as\nparticipants in free-choice learning at exhibits focusing on\nthe Righteous Among the Nations. In a basic, qualitative\ninterpretive study, the researcher \"attempts to discover and\nunderstand a phenomenon, process, the perspectives, and\nworldviews of people involved, or a combination of these\"\n(Merriam, 2002, p. 6). To understand participants' meaning\nmaking, we interviewed 11 individuals who attended pro-\ngrams at Midwestern University that centered on the role of\nPolish non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during\nthe Holocaust. The programs consisted of the Righteous\nAmong the Nations exhibit and the Jan Karski exhibit.\nThe exhibits were located in the main floor of the univer-\nsity's library and were set up as open panel displays in which\nindividuals could freely walk through at their own pace. The\nfirst exhibit displayed panels with pictures and texts detail-\ning the stories of Polish Gentiles (given the titles of Righteous\nAmong the Nations of the World) and Polish Jews. The nar-\nratives depicted the historical context of Nazi\u00adGerman occu-\npied Poland during WWII including the stories of the rescuers\nand the rescued as well as their fates. For example, life sto-\nries of Polish Gentiles and Jews were described including\nphotos of hiding spaces and narratives of courage depicting\nhow individuals and families risked their lives to aid others,\nsometimes resulting in their execution.\nThe second exhibit depicted the life story of one man, Jan\nKarski, who risked his life as a member of the Polish\nUnderground resistance to gather intelligence about Nazi\u00ad\nGerman atrocities committed against Jews, write reports, and\nimpel Western leaders to intervene, which they did not (Jan\nKarski Educational Foundation, n.d.). Part of the narrative of\nthe exhibit described how Karski was smuggled into the\nWarsaw Ghetto and a concentration camp near Lublin. His\nphotographic memory and firsthand account of the crimes\nagainst humanity he witnessed were central to the narrative\ndepicted in the exhibits as well as his journey through life\nafter WWII.\nThe researchers' subjectivities are important to describe\nas it is through our lenses the data were analyzed (Sultana,\n2007). The first researcher is from outside the state in which\nYelich Biniecki and Donley 5\nthe exhibit was held and identifies as a member of the Polish\nAmerican heritage community. She has worked and lived in\nPoland and visits Poland annually. The second researcher is\nfrom the area and identifies as American.\nAt the end of each exhibit, participants were given an\nopportunity to provide feedback on comment cards. Sorting\ncomment cards and identifying themes related to our main\nresearch question provided the first stage of data analysis,\nwhich we organized through concept mapping, a visual orga-\nnization process to organize data and view interrelationships\nThe comment cards also provided an opportunity for exhibit\nattendees to indicate if they were interested in participating\nin a study associated with the exhibit and provide a space to\ngive their contact information. The second author sent emails\nto those individuals detailing the study and asking for volun-\nteers. We used convenience sampling to access participants\nand, therefore, are unable to generalize our findings beyond\nour own study. Similarly, there are limitations to the repre-\nsentativeness of our sample. Our sample is drawn from per-\nsons who attended the exhibit and left their contact\ninformation on the comment cards. Thus, we did not have\naccess and did not interview individuals who attended the\nexhibit but did not comment on comment cards or leave con-\ntact information. Eleven respondents composed the final\nsample recruited for this study. Table 1 depicts participant\ncharacteristics as they identified and described themselves.\nParticipants included 11 women and one male; all were\nassociated with the town's university in some capacity as\neither student or employee. The demographics of partici-\npants are unsurprising given the social context in which this\nstudy is situated: a mainly White, small, college town in the\nMidwest.\nParticipants were interviewed by the second author.\nInterviews took place at the location of the participant's choos-\ning (student union, coffee shops, the second author's office)\nand were audio-recorded with the permission of the partici-\npant. Through a semi-structured interview guide (Creswell,\n2014), participants were asked about their experiences in the\nexhibits, what they remembered most, about their learning\nstyles, how they used what they learned at the exhibit, and\nhow they made sense of their experience at the exhibit.\nFollowing data collection, the interviews were transcribed ver-\nbatim by an outside transcriber and analyzed by both the first\nand the second authors.\nIn the first round of coding, both authors thoroughly read\nthrough the interview data and openly coded (Miles &\nHuberman, 1994) the data for relevant themes and common-\nalities pertinent to the research question: How did learners\nmake meaning of their experiences as participants at exhibits\nfocusing on the Righteous Among the Nations of the World?\nMatrices were then developed to put order on the initial\nthemes (Miles & Huberman, 1994). In the second round of\ncoding, the authors further refined their initial codes through\nthe use of the matrices with categories such as: \"things most\nremembered from exhibits\", \"how used knowledge\", \"us\nversus them\", and \"hidden stories\". Trustworthiness of the\nstudy was maintained through such strategies as maintaining\nnotes and comments about the interaction with the data,\nmeeting throughout the analysis process in face-to-face\nmeetings or via video conference to co-check meaning mak-\ning, and providing participants with opportunities for feed-\nFindings: The \"Web\" of Learning\nAbout Righteous Among the Nations\nOur findings identified three main mechanisms in which par-\nticipants \"made sense\" of their experiences at the Righteous\nAmong the Nations and Jan Karski exhibits: through emo-\ntions, being challenged, and broadening awareness. The fol-\nlowing four participant stories were chosen to depict the\ninterrelationship between the ways in which participants\nmade sense of learning about this topic.\nNancy, a dance professor, teaches at the same Midwestern\nUniversity where the exhibits were held and attended both of\nthe programs. She attended the programs because of her life-\nlong interest in Holocaust history. During her attendance,\nTable 1.

She com-\nments on how she felt uncomfortable around the Poles dur-\ning the event. Nancy draws connections between the program\nand contemporary global conflicts happening in the Middle\nEast and Ukraine. Particularly, she wonders why it is that\nthese conflicts between ethnic or religious groups continue\nto happen over the course of history. Following the program,\nshe speaks with her husband about how the program rein-\nforced the importance of being aware of global issues and\nconflicts.\nGail,adoctoralstudentatthesameMidwesternUniversity,\nattended the first program. Her main reason for attending the\nprogram was because of her interest in \"hidden stories\"\nthroughout history, particularly those about WWII. Gail also\nhas a grandfather who was a solider in WWII. She was most\nstruck by the unfolding narratives and the pictures of the\nfamilies of the rescuers and the rescued when participating in\nthe program; particularly she wondered what other hidden\nstories were out there that we do not know about. Gail con-\nnected her experience at the program to her own work as an\neducator. She sees hidden stories as a potentially useful\nlearning tool in the classroom.\nOla also attended both of the programs. She was inter-\nested in attending the program because she is Polish and\nlived most of her life in Poland. Both of the stories presented\nat each program are not unfamiliar topics for Ola. As a young\nchild, she learned about these events while attending school\nin Poland. Revisiting these stories through her participation\nin each program made Ola proud of her Polish heritage. She\nfelt especially proud when recounting her experience at the\nprograms with Polish friends after she attended the exhibits.\nThalia is 65-year-old, retired woman, and she attended the\nfirst program and a corresponding play associated with\nRighteous Among the Nations of the World. She had two\nmain reasons for attending the programs. First, she said she\nwas immediately interested in it because she is Jewish and\nshe recalled how there are not a lot of programs about the\nHolocaust offered in her city of residence. Second, she\nattended the programs because she was interested to see how\nPoland and Polish people's roles in WWII were going to be\nportrayed in the exhibit. Thalia concluded that her experi-\nence with the program added to her knowledge about\nPoland's role in the world, particularly that there were \"good\"\nPoles who aided Jewish families escaping the Holocaust,\nwhich was inconsistent with her previous perspective that\nPoland did not help much during WWII.\nThese four examples demonstrate the often complicated\nand interrelated ways in which participants communicated\nthey make sense of learning in Holocaust education contexts.\nSpecifically, one respondent, Nancy, described learning and\nthe interconnections between these meaning making mecha-\nnisms like a \"spider web.\" She said, \"There's an intersection\nhere, and an intersection there, and they might not seem like\nthey directly relate, but if you follow the web around, they\nare connected.\" This web becomes evident when analyzing\nparticipants' stories about how they made meaning of their\nattendance of the Righteous Among the Nations programs.\nThe topic intersected, for example, with a participant's iden-\ntity, international issues, and emotions.\nIn the remainder of this section, we focus on answering\nour overarching research question: How did learners make\nmeaning of their experiences at exhibits depicting narratives\nof the Righteous Among the Nations of the World? We\nexplore these mechanisms--emotions, being challenged,\nand broadening awareness--in greater detail and how they\nare related to meaning making of the Righteous Among the\nNations exhibits.\nThrough Emotions\nOne of the main mechanisms through which people made\nsense of their participation in the exhibits was emotions.\nThey described \"being moved\" or being \"emotional\" during\ntheir learning. Participants communicated emotions from\nsad, to angry, to hopeful in the same learning process.\nParticipants described trying to imagine the horror, sad-\nness, and pain around for one to take such action to save\nothers when one could have opted only to save oneself.\nQuestions included \"Could I be brave?\" and \"Could I have\nthe courage to save others under such circumstances?\" Lilly\nexamined her beliefs as a Christian and asked, \"Would I rise\nto the occasion?\" This was a rather common response to the\nprogram during interviews with participants and many asked,\n\"Could I do this?\" Some also provided answers to these\nquestions; they did not know if they would be able to per-\nform some of these heroic acts they read about, but hoped\nthey would be able. By asking these hard questions of them-\nselves and in some cases providing answers, participants\nmake sense of narratives by imagining themselves in the\nshoes of the Polish Gentile families to reflect on whether\nthey would be capable of doing similar things under similar\ncircumstances. Participants not only asked questions about\nthemselves in relation to the narratives but also more gener-\nally about human nature.\nGail, who attended the Righteous Among the Nations pro-\ngram, reflected more generally on the role of the Polish\nGentile families:\nIt's amazing how much people were willing to risk for total\nstrangers. Some of them had a connection, but most of them had\nno connection to these people and yet they died for them. I\nthink it teaches something really fundamental about the\npotential for goodness in people; it also teaches [us about] the\npotential for evil.\nLike Lilly and Valerie, Gail was amazed at what others could\ndo for complete strangers. Empathy was one of the biggest\nemotions identified in participants' reflections on their expe-\nrience in the programs. Gail also empathized with the Polish\nYelich Biniecki and Donley 7\nGentile families who helped the Polish Jewish families for\nbeing willing to risk it all to save them. She concludes, again,\nby asking hard questions about human nature and good and\nevil. She identified that human goodness and evilness could\nexist, which she saw as a useful lesson.\nParticipants also described feeling empathy for the survi-\nvors they read about. Valerie said, \"It (the exhibit) definitely\nmakes me empathize with the survivors . . . How they wanna\nforget and I don't wanna acknowledge it. I feel that's kind of\nrepetitive.\" She explained that she did not want to even think\nabout the fact that \"the Holocaust could have happened.\" It\nwas difficult to \"be in tune with the emotions behind it.\"\nValerie described feeling empathy with Holocaust survivors\nin how she understood how it might be easier to forget\nbecause of the emotional pain remembering can cause.\nValerie's reflection was somewhat different from the major-\nity of other participants, because she identified how difficult\ntelling and remembering these stories can be for survivors\nand how that might lead to wanting to forget rather than\nremember these events. Valerie's account suggests how chal-\nlenging participating in this program was for participants in\na multitude of other ways.\nBeing Challenged\nParticipants expressed empathy, but for some, empathetic\nfeelings also brought a sense of challenge because it took\nthem \"outside of our cultural bubble.\" Participants described\nfeeling challenged because they had previously not known of\nthe stories of the Polish Gentile families saving the Polish\nJewish families. Some felt guilty they had not learned about\nthe Righteous Among the Nations earlier and that through\nnarratives, this was the first time they had really started\nlearning about these individuals. Rhonda was \"surprised\"\nthat she had not heard of Jan Karski in high school history.\nThis \"surprise\" was common among other participants as\nwell. For example, some participants described these stories\nas hidden to them. This feeling of surprise served as an\nimportant starting point for meaning making. Madeline, a\ncollege student in elementary education, attended because it\nwas required for class, but she stayed much longer than\nrequired because she found the narratives of the exhibit inter-\nesting. Her younger sister's friend attended with her.\nMadeline said that she learned, \"There are a lot of invisible\nstories.\" Valerie, a sophomore in college, heard about the\nexhibit from her history professor and she remembered that\nit had been in New York City prior to coming to the library\non campus. She described the stories at the exhibit taking her\n\"outside of our cultural bubble\" and she felt that the exhibit\nwas important to push people outside of that bubble. Ola and\nPiotr described feeling appreciative of the exhibit educating\nothers about their cultural history; however, all other partici-\npants described being \"pushed out of the cultural bubble\" as\na part of their participation, which made them feel uncom-\nfortable and challenged them in a multitude of ways.\nIn addition to the content of the program challenging par-\nticipants' \"cultural bubbles,\" sharing space during the pro-\ngram with individuals of various cultural backgrounds also\nwas challenging for some participants. Within the same pro-\ngram, Nancy said,\nThere were a lot of Polish people there which was fun, since I've\nnever been to Poland it was fun to speak to them, but they are a\nlittle clannish . . . I haven't been to Europe in about 10--12 years\nso I forgot this, this \"you're not us\" thing. But it's okay, people\nare who they are.\nIn this community, Nancy wanted to learn about \"the others\"\nand came to learn about diversity and tolerance, but felt chal-\nlenged to socially be around \"the others\" in a real, physical\nspace. She expressed curiosity and discomfort by the diversity\nof people in attendance of the program, which she attributed to\nnot regularly being around other languages or those unlike her.\nOther participants experienced similar reactions, and their\nsocial identities came to the forefront during their participation\nin the program. Thalia felt she was challenged by two points: as\na member of the Jewish community, \"There are good people\nwherever you go, so I was pleased that the good Polish people\nwere getting some recognition and I was also pleased that\nPoland was recognizing the significance of its role . . .\"\nHowever, she also said, \"I'm a little concerned that they are\nsuddenly going to try to say that Poland did a good job, because\nthey didn't in general do a good job. But significantly wonder-\nful people did a wonderful job.\" Throughout her interview,\nThalia seemed challenged by her reflection on rescuers,\nbystanders, victims, and the context of oppression in which\nthey co-existed. She said that she did see Poles at the event, but\nshe hesitated to go and introduce herself. Therefore, moments\nencountering the other at the event were part of the challenge\nthat intersected with the content of the exhibit. Thalia's descrip-\ntion of her experience also explores how her social location as\na Jewish person and her perception of Poland's role in WWII\nshaped her meaning making of the program.\nBroadening Awareness\nThe final way in which participants described making sense\nof the programs was through feeling an increased awareness\nand feeling as if their \"eyes were opened\" or opened a little\nwider. This increasing awareness also was connected to the\nidea of the \"hidden\" stories displayed in narratives. Many\nrespondents identified that they had not previously known\nabout the stories, and through their participation in the exhib-\nits, they increased their knowledge or gained greater insight\nabout the Holocaust. Madeline shared she thought that con-\ntinually acknowledging these stories and keeping informed\ndoes not let us forget. She said,\nI think recognizing that those things are so real and that they\nhappened. Just getting to see the pictures and actually the list of\nnames (those who saved people, who were killed because of it,\n8 SAGE Open\nand people who were saved), which you could look at the names\nand just walk over them, and ignore them, not even thinking\nabout them, but if you actually think of all the lives, all those\npeople touched, just being able to think back and realize that's\nnot just a story you read in a history book.\nBy participating in the exhibit, Madeline talked about how\nthese stories that she learned about in history books through-\nout her lifetime became more humanized. Through the pho-\ntos and narratives provided in the programs, some participants\ndescribed feeling much more connected to the stories. The\nstories became more \"real\" to them.\nOthers identified developing an awareness about their\nown privileges as Americans. Participants drew comparisons\nbetween the privileges afforded to people in the United States\nthat others in different locations may not have. For instance,\nWanda spoke about how many of the people in the world do\nnot have the freedoms available to those in the United States.\nSimilarly, Nancy, a university professor, spoke on the same\nissue but in more detail:\nWe are in such a fortunate climate of freedom. I don't think we\nare teaching people what the cost of freedom is; what the value\nof freedom is and what you have to do to maintain it. When you\nare upset about something--do you write your representative?\nDo you protest? Do you understand that you are not shot when\nyou protest? [I am] Concerned we are becoming a country of\nmushballs and self-centered whiners. People do not have the\neasy life we do.\nNancy was very critical of what she saw in current U.S. cul-\nture as political complacency, apathy, and being uninformed\nabout the surrounding world. For some of the participants in\nthis research, attending such a harrowing exhibit on the\natrocities of the Holocaust served as a reminder to be aware\nof what is going on around you, to not be complacent, and be\na concerned, informed citizen.\nOthers acknowledged that attending this program rein-\nforced the idea that as individuals, it is our responsibility to\nbe aware of what happened in the past as well as what is\ngoing on today. Valerie said that she felt \"more attuned to the\nsuffering happening now . . . We can't forget about history;\nwe can't forget about the things that are going on internation-\nally.\" Thalia said, \"It's terribly important that we not stop\ntalking about it.\" Piotr said he thought that there was a\n\"break\" in Holocaust education in the United States and that\n\"We still have to work on those issues; basically it's impor-\ntant for the human rights and humanity.\" Thalia said the par-\nticipation further ignited feelings for her to continue to share\ninformation about the Holocaust so that it cannot be repeated.\nShe said,\nYou know, it becomes more important for exhibits like this to\nhappen, for people to understand that this was a reality and it\nwasn't just 6 million Jews, it was 3 million other people that\nthey killed, so if you were gay, or handicapped, or gypsy, I mean\nthey murdered a lot of people. It's so important that these things\nbe brought to our university for the next generation because I'm\nafraid that they are going to try and say that it didn't happen.\nThalia's response communicated a sense of urgency to con-\ntinue to tell these stories presently and capture them for\nfuture generations. Participants' interviews emphasized their\nideas of the importance of being aware of what was going on\nin the world: past, present, and future. Through this program,\nparticipants learned things they did not know, criticized\nunawareness about historical and present international con-\nditions, and recognized the importance of continuing to\nspread awareness about the Holocaust and other similar\nissues by sharing stories like Righteous Among the Nations\nof the World and Jan Karski.\nDiscussion and Implications\nThis study further informs our understanding of meaning\nmaking in free-choice learning contexts. In particular, the\nstudy suggests ways in which we might further bridge dis-\ntance in international education exhibits focusing on human\nrights and human conflict. Hidden stories within exhibits and\nfostering learning around those stories are complex pro-\ncesses. In this study, the exhibits were held in the middle of a\nnationally identified conservative state in a rural area with a\nmajority White population, a very small Polish population,\nand a very small Jewish population, of which some partici-\npants belonged to both social groups. The diversity repre-\nsented in the exhibit on multiple levels is also hidden or\nnon-existent within daily life for the majority of the popula-\ntion. Falk and Dierking (2002) identify participants' choice\nand control as important elements of free-choice learning,\nsuch as learning at exhibits. This study's findings suggest\nthat we may wish to identify additional prompts and support\nfor meaning making within that physical space of the exhib-\nits to help learners identify these choices.\nFor example, participants at the Righteous Among the\nNations exhibits reflected upon \"what would I do\" as it\nrelated to current ethical and moral dilemmas (Albert, 2013).\nThis reflection also accompanied emotions such as sorrow,\nanger, and hope, which may be facilitators of learning and an\nand a space connecting learning and emotion (Parrish, 2010).\nParticipants described the exhibits providing a connector in\nfostering empathy and challenges within the learning pro-\ncess. Therefore, participants' interviews suggest that in their\ncases, historical distance was bridged as Grever et al. (2012)\nand Ciardelli and Wasserman (2011) discuss in their work,\nwhich is an important aim in such exhibits. Participants dis-\ncussed the exhibit prompting a reflection on the need to work\non current humanitarian issues in the present. However,\ninterviews suggest that this historical distance perhaps was\nnot bridged within the space of the exhibit itself. When\npressed to be in a shared, benign space like a library with\nYelich Biniecki and Donley 9\n\"the other,\" some participants expressed feeling challenged\nto do so and even seemed unaware in interviews that they\nspoke intolerantly of \"the other.\" For example, Nancy, an\nassistant professor, was in a shared space to learn about\ndiversity and tolerance, yet seemed uncomfortable and even\nmade othering comments about Poles in her interview. If\nsuch exhibits aim at prompting deeper critical reflection,\neducators may ask what other kind of prompts could be pro-\nvided to foster this reflection. Such prompts might include\nquestions at the end of the exhibit focusing on social identi-\nties in communities and social justice, resources or links if\nparticipants would like to learn more, and ways of continu-\ning to stay involved in the issues of focus.\nParticipants described being challenged through the nar-\nratives of rescuers and victims they read at the exhibit (Clark\nwas situated within multiple cultural identities, such as\nnational, ethnic, religious, and professional within different\nsocially prescribed values of power. For example, Ola and\nPiotr described appreciating that the topic focused on the his-\ntory of their ethnic group was receiving attention. Thalia was\nchallenged by feeling othered at the event and in the process\nof reflecting on her tension of discovering the \"good\" Poles,\ndid not know what to do when she saw Poles talking at the\nevent. And, U.S. citizens seemed to feel shocked that they\ndid not know about aspects of the topic. For U.S.-born par-\nticipants, this appreciation of the space of the United States\noften was \"safe\" and \"better\" as participants struggled with\ntrying to come to terms with other ways of thinking about\nnational origin and identity. Therefore, educators may find\nchallenges and tension between this appreciative reflection\nwithin these shared spaces on multiple levels. Although none\nof the individuals discussed talking to each other, each had\nan interest in \"the other\" which they indicated in through\ndescriptions of empathy and challenging. The learning\ndescribed involved a tension or symbiotic relationships\nbetween the appreciative and the critical reflection. The\nprompts which could be provided to bridge historical dis-\ntance might also provide further ways of developing critical\nmedia literacy about current events and engagement. For\nexample, using prompts to examine community relations in\nthe communities in which one resides could provide addi-\ntional connectors for participants. Virtual privilege walks\ncould be added to supplement exhibits and ask participants to\nexamine their positionalities. Questions as simple as \"Who\ndo you eat with at work or school?\" and \"Who would you ask\nto drive you to the airport?\" can provide points of reflection\nabout how we decide who matters.\nFree-choice learning has been noted as a powerful profes-\nsional development connector for leaders, teachers, and stu-\ndents (Grenier, 2009) as the narratives here suggest. The\nstudy also suggests that providing avenues to further interro-\ngate our positionalities (Lindquist, 2010) and the positionali-\nties of such exhibits within our environments may deepen\nprofessional development. Free-choice learning programs\ncan be an input into professional development, and interna-\ntional education exhibits may provide very important spaces\nto do so. Although professionals such as educators partici-\npated in the exhibit, additional organization around fostering\nspecific professional and continuing education could be\nincorporated for concrete learning objectives within multiple\ndisciplines thereby increasing awareness of the topic as well\nas connecting to formal educational goals. In addition, all par-\nticipants interviewed were members of the university com-\nmunity, which also may indicate the need to examine outreach\ninitiatives to engage communities beyond the \"cultural bub-\nble\" of the campus. Additional questions connected to inter-\ngroup, on-site observations, and daily life might be helpful.\nFree-choice learning in international education, particu-\nlarly of human conflict, provides opportunities for reflection\nto negotiate and mediate historical distance to engage with\nthe past to make that history closer or less \"foreign.\" This\nlearning and reflection may also be a connector to foster inter-\nest in learning more about communities in which we live.\nWhether the exhibit is focusing on Sudan, Syria, or Ukraine,\ndiverse heritage and diaspora communities of multiple and\nintersecting identities may be learners and participants within\na shared space. Learning and reflection for diverse communi-\nties is multifaceted. Through understanding the complexity of\nmeaning making, we can better plan and facilitate programs\nwithin Righteous Among the Nations and Holocaust exhibits\nas well as other international free-choice learning contexts.\nOur research demonstrates the complexity of meaning\nmaking that takes place when engaging in international edu-\ncation, free-choice learning settings. Future research should\ncontinue to investigate meaning making processes across\ndiverse learning contexts. Similarly, our sample is mostly\nWhite of U.S. nation origin and undisclosed ethnicities and\nreligions. Future research should attempt to address the limi-\ntations of this research by incorporating more racially and\nethnically diverse participants. Despite the respective limita-\ntion, it is also important to acknowledge that there are many\ncommunities across the United States that share similar char-\nacteristics with our study context: a nationally identified\nconservative state in a rural area with a majority White, U.S.-\nborn population; therefore, exploring meaning making with\nthe public pedagogy of exhibits such as the RighteousAmong\nthe Nations may inform how these exhibits are part of facili-\ntating learning in areas with little cultural diversity and where\nface-to-face interaction with \"the other\" may happen in those\npublic spaces.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAfonso, A.
