How-\never, most existing data on states and their characteristics often lack a clear\nspatial referent, and the specific units and boundaries that observations in a\ndata set refer to are often unclear. Many common data sets contain inaccu-\nracies or anachronisms that, we surmise, are not at all obvious to users and\nonly become apparent upon close inspection. The Penn World Tables data,\nfor example, impose current state/border configurations on all the historical\ndata reported (Heston, Summers, and Aten 2006). This in turn means that\nhistorical observations for \"Germany\" prior to unification encompass\npopulation estimates for both the Federal and the Democratic Republics\ntogether, although the two were clearly administered as separate states.\nMoreover, data for \"Russia\" prior to the end of the Soviet Union are esti-\nmates of the Russian Federation only, although the former Soviet Republics\nclearly were part of an integrated state at the time.\nLikewise, although the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)\nand maps have become increasingly common in international relations and\ncomparative research, most standard software packages tend to have default\nglobal maps that conform to current state boundaries, without any addi-\ntional information to reflect changes over time. As such, these maps do not\nincorporate changes in the configuration and shape of states (for example\nthe secession of Bangladesh/East Pakistan from Pakistan in 1971). Not\nsurprisingly, using current maps to represent historical time periods can\nintroduce many inaccuracies in applied work.\nIn this paper we present the CShapes dataset, which contains a set of his-\ntorically accurate country boundaries starting in 1945, as well as routines to\nperform useful operations on these in the R statistical package. Beyond dis-\nplaying historically accurate maps, our package allows users to take advan-\ntage of geographical information for different purposes. This paper starts by\ndiscussing how existing research has taken into account the geography of the\nthe use of CShapes for generat\nin spatial statistical applications. All\nstatistical tests. Third, we illustrate -\ning different weights matrices\nthe examples can be replicated using the freely available R package\n88 N. B. Weidmann et al.\ncompatibility. We argue that a direct representation of state boundaries as\nelectronic maps can improve the already existing numeric indicators. The\npaper proceeds with an introduction of our CShapes dataset that follows this\napproach. We discuss the coding scheme and the dataset structure. The\nremainder of the paper illustrates the use of CShapes with three applications:\nFirst, the creation of maps to visualize quantities measured at the state level;\nsecond, the computation of geographic indicators on CShapes maps; and\nthird, the creation of weights matrices for spatial regression modeling.\nFor the field of international relations, the geography of the international\nsystem is important for at least three reasons. First, it can tell us something\nabout states. Country size, for example, is held to influence the likelihood\nthat a state will see conflict (see for example, Fearon and Laitin 2003), or a\nphenomenon important to explain in its own right (for example, Lake and\nO'Mahony 2004). In order to compute geographic variables such as country\nsize, we clearly need to know the spatial extent of states and their configu-\nrations. Second, geography provides the topology in which the states interact.\nThis is reflected in research on territorial conflict, the diffusion of war, and\nthe role of distance as a determinant for cooperative and conflictual interac-\ntions (for prominent examples, see Hensel and Diehl 1994; Siverson and\nunderstand the influences a state is exposed to, we need to know where\nstates are located relative to each other, so that we can compute characteris-\ntics such as adjacency and distance between boundaries. Third, there are\nmany important phenomena that do not necessarily follow state boundaries\nsuch as environmental influences, for which many data sources are now\nprovided in geographically disaggregated form. Prominent examples include\ndepositions of important environmental pollutants, such as sulphur and nitrous\noxide (see for example, Sandler 1997). This also holds for rainfall, which some\nresearchers have suggested is a key influence on economic growth in rain-fed\nagricultural societies, with the advantage that it can be assumed to be exoge-\nnous to conflict and hence be helpful as an instrument in assessing the effects\nof growth shocks on conflict (Miguel, Satyanath, and Sergenti 2004). Computing\nstate-level estimates of these phenomena and assessing their variation within\nstates required us to overlay accurate boundary maps.\nA number of data sources have been compiled to reflect various geo-\ngraphical characteristics deemed important in theoretical studies on conflictual\ninteractions. These include data on contiguity (Gochman 1991), minimum dis-\ntances between states (Gleditsch and Ward 2001), shared boundary length\n(Furlong and Gleditsch 2003) and territorial change (Tir, Schafer, Diehl, and\ninternational system. We show that the development of multiple databases for\nthis purpose leaves much to be desired with regards to data consistency and\n  89\naspect of geography, and have been collected independently of one another.\nAlthough these individual databases measure aspects of the same system, they\nlack any comparable underlying data. This is obviously a less than optimal\nstrategy from an information representation point of view. First, it makes it dif-\nficult to compute comparable measures--how can we be sure that geographic\nvariables in two different datasets refer to the same geopolitical entity? Sec-\nond, these compatibility issues across datasets can make error checking and\ncross validation particularly difficult. Third, and most importantly, updating\nthe datasets is inefficient and time-consuming. For example, with a newly\nreleased system membership list, one would have to update multiple data-\nbases at the same time. We believe that a more consistent approach to gener-\nating data on underlying geographic characteristics may be helpful.\nAll the above-described geographic variables depend on the same infor-\nmation, which is the underlying maps of countries and their international\nboundaries. Once these maps are available, very little is required for measures\nsuch as minimum or capital distance to be computed from this geographic\ninformation. In fact, the only step that needs human intervention is the creation\nof the electronic maps; the computation of the dependent information--\ndistance, area, adjacency--can be left to a computer. This approach ensures\nthat the variables are comparable, since they refer to the same geopolitical\nentities. Also, modifications in such a dataset can be done simply by changing\nthe underlying cartographic data and rerunning the variable computation. The\nCShapes dataset and statistical package seeks to implement this approach and\nto develop a geographic database for international boundaries.\nThe aim of the CShapes project is to provide a direct representation of state\nboundaries in a GIS dataset. However, there are a number of practical prob-\nlems to be considered when developing historical maps of the international\nsystem. The most obvious decision that has to be made concerns member-\nship in the international system, or the issue of determining and identifying\nwhat qualifies as an independent state. For the representation of state\nboundaries, we then need to identify the spatial extent of states that we\nwant to include in our maps. Lastly, since we are aiming for a representa-\ntion of state boundaries over time, we need to identify what constitutes a\nchange in these boundaries. This section presents our coding decisions and\nintroduces the CShapes data representation as a GIS dataset.\nDefining States\nMany different definitions have been proposed for the coding of geopolitical\nentities. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) publishes\nGoertz 1998). However, previous data projects have emphasized a single\n90 N. B. Weidmann et al.\nthe frequently used ISO 3166 country codes standard that defines numeric\nor alphanumeric codes for a global list of countries (International Organization\nfor Standardization 2008). Another coding system for geopolitical units often\nused in geographic applications is the \"Federal Information Processing\nStandard\" (FIPS), number 10-4 (Information Technology Laboratory and\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology 2008). The FIPS standard is\nissued by the US Federal Government and partly relies on ISO 3166. However,\nthere are two problems associated with these systems, which makes them diffi-\ncult to apply in the social sciences. First, there is a lack of clear rules regarding\nthe inclusion of cases.1 Second, none of the mentioned country coding systems\nincludes a time dimension. ISO was first published in 1974 and is regularly\nupdated, but there is no consistent list for dates earlier than this.\nResearch in political science has produced alternative lists of states or\nmembers in the international system, which address some of these problems.\nThe first widely used state list was originally proposed by Russett, Singer,\nand Small (1968), and has subsequently become known as the Correlates of\nWar (COW) system membership list (Correlates of War Project 2008). COW\nuses as its main criteria the recognition by the UK and France, membership\nin the League of Nations and the United Nations, and various ad hoc deci-\nsions. The COW coding scheme has been employed--in varying degrees of\nconsistency--by a number of other data projects, such as the widely used\nPolity dataset on regime characteristics (Marshall and Jaggers 2008), and the\nMinorities at Risk database on discriminated ethnic groups (Minorities at\nRisk Project 2005). However, the COW list has been criticized for lacking\nface validity and problematic coding decisions. Alternative lists have been\nproposed, the most important of which, for our purposes, is the state list by\nGleditsch and Ward (1999). Gleditsch and Ward (GW) consider a minimum\npopulation threshold of 250,000, whether self-declared states have territorial\ncontrol and recognition by some states, even if they do not seek an active\ninternational role or membership in international organizations. Gleditsch\nand Ward also provide a supplementary list of microstates with populations\nless than 250,000 for researchers interested in including small formally inde-\npendent states. A variety of data projects uses the GW list, for example the\nUppsala/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset (Gleditsch, Wallensteen, Eriksson,\nSollenberg, and Strand 2002), or the \"Scalar Index of Polities\" by Gates,\nWe decided to make CShapes compatible with the COW and GW lists\nas both of these sources are widely used in the research community. The\ndifferences between the two datasets mainly arise in the pre-World War II\nperiod, where the two often have dramatically different dates of independence\n1For example, ISO 3166 includes the Svalbard islands as a separate unit. However, although Svalbard has\na special status under the 1920 treaty, it falls under Norwegian sovereignty and is administrated by a\ngovernor directly appointed by the Norwegian government.\n  91\nfor many states, such as Canada or Iran/Persia. The differences are much\nsmaller in the period after 1945, which is currently covered by CShapes. In\nthis period, most of the discrepancies between the two data sources arise\nfrom minor differences in the start and end dates of states, as well as some\nmajor differences arising for microstates such as Andorra that often have a\nsubstantial period of formal independence prior to becoming system mem-\nbers in the COW list due to membership in the United Nations.\nThe Spatial Extent of a State\nOnce we use either the COW or the GW list to identify the relevant state enti-\nties to be coded in CShapes, we need to define their spatial extent explicitly.\nAccording to the classic Weberian notion of the state as having a monopoly on\nviolence, we could define states boundaries by the territorial limits of control of\nthe state. This criterion is difficult to apply in practice, however, as there is a lot\nof variation in the level of control that states actually exert over their territorial\nunits. As of the time of writing, for example, the central government of Afghan-\nistan does not actually exercise control over much of the territory for which it\nclaims sovereignty.\nAnother possible criterion, conceptually similar to that of the COW list,\nwould be to consider the internationally accepted boundaries of states. In prac-\ntice, boundaries are often disputed, and many states often claim the same terri-\ntory. Venezuela, for example, makes a claim to all of the territory west of the\nEssequibo River, which constitutes more than half of the territory claimed by\nGuyana, although they have so far not used force to seize the territory. In other\ncases such as Kashmir, China and Pakistan occupy territory seized by force\nfrom India, but without India recognizing their claim to the territory. Finally,\nmany states formally recognize states that do not control the territory claimed,\nsuch as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in Moroccan-controlled Western\nSahara.\nFor the CShapes project, we take a pragmatic approach and consider\nthe conventional international boundaries recognized by most states and\nwhere another state is not clearly exercising control over the territory. Our\ncoding approach is stepwise in that we first identify the relevant states in\nthe system and then find spatial representations of their extent. We include\nonly what we call the \"core\" territory of a state, and leave out the depen-\ndent territories such as colonies or militarily-occupied territories outside the\nrecognized boundaries of states. As such, not every point on Earth will be\nincluded in a CShapes polygon at any given point in time, as there may be\nsignificant territories that do not fall within the core of a state. For example,\nsub-Saharan Africa in 1947 consists of only three polygons (Ethiopia,\nLiberia, and South Africa), since the rest of the continent was under colonial\nrule at that time. More recently, territorial units such as Antarctica are not\ncoded as part of any state.\n92 N. B. Weidmann et al.\nAn alternative to our approach of proceeding from states to territories\nwould be to determine for each individual territorial unit at different points in\ntime whether it belongs to an independent state, and what its status is. Such\ninformation would certainly be desirable, but this approach is much more com-\nplex and would require a great deal more work and resources than we have at\nour disposal. However, our approach of starting with a positive list of states can\ncertainly be extended to include territories other than the core if need be, and it\nwould be possible to code the remaining parts of the globe outside the core ter-\nritories into residual polygons based on the information in CShapes.\nTerritorial Changes\nThe shape and configuration of a state's core territory can change over time.\nWe distinguish between two important cases: First, territorial changes may\noccur when states merge or dissolve, and second, state configurations may\nchange in the absence of emergence or disappearance of states. One example\nof the first kind of territorial change is the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in\n1992, when the two constituent members of the federation (that is, the\nCzech and Slovak Republics) emerge as new independent states. In CShapes,\nwe see two new polygons replacing the former polygon for Czechoslovakia,\nbut other polygons bordering Czechoslovakia are not affected. Conversely,\nGerman unification, where the former German Democratic Republic joined\nthe German Federal Republic in 1990, implies a merger of two polygons, but\nalso without any changes in other polygons. Examples of territorial adjust-\nments unrelated to changes in the number of independent states include the\nentry of Newfoundland to Canada in 1948, or the incorporation of the Azouzou\nstrip, previously held by Chad, into Libya in 1972.\nInformation on territorial changes related to system membership can be\nobtained from the state lists that CShapes relies on (COW or GW). Both lists\nprovide entry and exit dates at the level of days for all independent states\nthey contain. We aligned all the dates of territorial changes where states\nenter and leave the international system with the date given in the two state\nlists. For example, in line with both state lists, the boundaries of East and\nWest Germany are coded as active until October 2, 1990. The new bound-\naries of the unified Germany replace the old territorial division beginning\nOctober 3, 1990. As we show below, CShapes contains separate entry/exit\ndates for the two state lists, since in a number of cases the two state lists\nhave different dates of independence.\nChanges of the second type--boundary adjustments without changes\nin system membership--are taken from the Territorial Changes dataset by\nTir et al. (1998).2 The dataset lists all territorial changes that involved at least\n2Jaroslav Tir kindly provided a supplementary list of entity codes and names used in the original dataset.\n  93\nthe exact dates. Each change is coded in a directional fashion, by listing the\ngainer and the loser of a particular piece of land. In order to make our effort\nof representing changes over space and time feasible, we had to limit the\nnumber of cases from the Territorial Changes dataset included in CShapes.\nIn particular, we apply three restrictions. First, we select all changes that\noccurred during and after 1946, because CShapes covers only the post-\nWorld War II period. Second, CShapes aims to represent only the core territory\nof states, so we disregard all changes not affecting the homeland territory of\na state. This selection was done using the \"gaintype\" and \"losetype\" vari-\nables in the Territorial Changes dataset. Third, we limit ourselves to major\nterritorial changes in area and only code transfers affecting an area equivalent\nto 100 km \u00d7 100 km. Also, this selection was performed using the information\nin the Territorial Changes dataset by setting a minimum threshold of 10,000\nin the \"area\" variable. This leaves us with a final set of 35 territorial changes\nrelevant for CShapes. Note, however, that the Territorial Changes dataset\nCShapes includes only changes related to the emergence/disappearance of\nnew states, but no boundary adjustments between existing states that may\nhave occurred.\nThe Representation of State Boundaries in a GIS Dataset\nSoftware and standards for the processing of spatial data have developed at\nan amazing speed over the last decade. These so-called geographic infor-\nmation systems (GIS) are also finding their way into the social sciences.\nSince the aim of CShapes is to give an explicit spatial representation of state\nboundaries, it is a straightforward decision to use a geographic data format\nfor CShapes. GIS data come in two fundamentally different types. First, raster\ndatasets divide the geographic space into equal-sized cells, and a particular\nvalue is stored for each of them. For example, territorial elevation is typically\nrepresented as a raster dataset with an elevation level for each cell. Second,\nvector datasets represent the geographic features of interest directly, either\nas points, lines or polygons. For example, in a dataset on rivers, we can\nstore each river as a line represented by a number of connected points in\nthe geographic space. We refer readers interested in more details about GIS\ntools and data to other specialized references such as Longley, Goodchild,\nThe GIS vector data approach is particularly suitable for CShapes, since\nwe are dealing with a finite number of geographic entities (states in our\ncase). In addition, vector data typically allow for additional, nonspatial\ninformation to be stored along with each geographic feature. This is done\nby providing a so-called \"attribute table\" in addition to the spatial features,\nfor example, rivers or roads. Each feature is linked to a record in the\n94 N. B. Weidmann et al.\nattribute table, which contains supplementary information. In a river dataset,\nfor example, the attribute table may contain the name of the river. In\nCShapes, we represent states as polygons, where each polygon is linked to\nthe corresponding record in the dataset's attribute table. Figure 1 illustrates\nthe dataset structure graphically.3 Note, however, that with a simple poly-\ngon representation we would have to represent noncontiguous states with a\nset of polygons and their corresponding rows in the attribute table. This\nwould lead to a very complex and error-prone dataset. Instead, we rely on\nan extension of the polygon vector format, the multi-polygon representa-\ntion. Instead of linking each polygon to a single row, a set of polygons is\nrepresented by a record in the attribute table. This allows for a convenient\ndata format where, for example, a country like Indonesia corresponds to\nexactly one record in the attribute table, even though it consists of 121 dis-\nconnected polygons.\nFor each territorial change, CShapes contains polygons that reflect the\nstatus quo before and after the change. For example, the breakup of a\ncountry A into countries B and C would be coded with three polygons: one\nrepresenting the extent of country A before the dissolution, and two poly-\ngons giving the extent of countries B and C after the breakup. How do we\ncode the temporal dimension of these changes? Whereas GIS vector data\nformats are perfectly suited for the representation of spatially explicit infor-\nmation, there is no support for linking this information to a particular point\nin time. We solve this problem by following the common approach of cod-\ning a \"lifetime\" for each state polygon. More precisely, each polygon has a\nstart date and an end date stored in its attribute table, which indicates the\nperiod when it is active. For each territorial change, we assign a lifetime that\nends the day before the change occurs to all polygons that reflect the status\n3CShapes uses the shapefile format, a frequently used vector data format, originally developed by the\nEnvironmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI). A technical description is available online (http://\nwww.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf).\nFIGURE 1 CShapes data representation as a GIS shapefile. Countries are represented by\npolygons, each of which is linked to a record in the attribute table where additional information\nabout the country is stored.\n  95\nbefore the change. All polygons representing the status after the change are\nassigned a lifetime that starts on the day the change happened. In the above\nexample, if we assume the breakup of country A to occur on a given day d,\nthe lifetime of the polygon representing country A ends at time d-1, and the\nlifetime of the two successor polygons starts at d. If there is no information\non the particular day a change occurred, we code the middle of the respec-\ntive month.\nCoding Procedure and Result\nCShapes was created by starting with a 2006 GIS dataset and backdating it\nstep by step, according to the changes given in the system membership and\nterritorial changes datasets. The original dataset is provided by ESRI (2006)\nand contains the boundaries of states and dependent territories. We started\nby matching the entities in the original dataset to the state lists and deleted\nall polygons that did not match an independent state as coded by the state\nlists. We then worked our way backwards in time, creating new polygons\nfor each relevant territorial change as introduced above. We consulted addi-\ntional sources in all cases where the extent of the respective boundary\nchange was not readily available. This was almost always the case for\nboundary changes of the second type (that is, adjustments without changes\nin system membership). The final dataset contains 241 polygons, where the\nvast majority of countries (177) are represented by one polygon. 15 countries\nhave two polygons in the dataset, and 9 countries have three or more.\nFigure 2 illustrates the result of the coding process for the breakup of\nYugoslavia. We present the example as series of snapshots, taken at the end\nof each month when a territorial change occurred. Each panel shows the\ncurrently active polygons as solid lines. Note that because the breakup of\nthe Federation occurred in a stepwise fashion with the former Republics\nseceding at different times, we need to code multiple polygons for what\nconstitutes the core territory of the Federation. The lifetimes of these poly-\ngons are shown in the plot.\nWe believe that CShapes can be useful for a variety of applications in quan-\ntitative research, and in this section we present some examples to illustrate\nthis. The first example shows how to use CShapes for creating map visual-\nizations of variables of interest. Our second application deals with the com-\nputation of state-level geographic variables, which require information about\nthe extent of states, as contained in our dataset. Lastly, we demonstrate the\nuse of CShapes in the context of spatial regression models.\n96 N. B. Weidmann et al.\nFIGURE 2 Example of the CShapes coding of Yugoslavia. The figure shows the break up of\nthe Federation by a series of snapshots, aligned with the COW dates for when new states\nwere established. Solid lines indicate polygons that are active at the given date. For illustration\npurposes, the date range given in the plot shows the lifespan of the currently active polygon\nthat represents Yugoslavia (and later Serbia, COW code 345).\n  97\nAs described above, CShapes relies on a GIS vector data format.\nAlthough this data format by itself is perfectly adequate for the storage of spa-\ntial information, lack of GIS skills among researchers might limit its spread in\nthe research community. We have therefore decided to distribute CShapes in\ntwo ways: the raw dataset itself in a vector data format, accompanied by a\nsoftware package that connects our dataset to the R statistical toolkit, the latter\nproviding functionality for processing spatial data (Weidmann and Gleditsch\n2010).4 This dual dissemination strategy builds on recent efforts to introduce\nnew, open-source tools for spatial analysis in the social sciences (Rey and\nCShapes package for R allows scholars without a GIS background to get\naccess to the information in CShapes and to perform a variety of tasks\nrequired to use the dataset for their own research. To illustrate this approach,\nthe applications presented in the remainder of this section rely only on the\nCShapes R package and do not require any additional proprietary software.\nSpatio-Temporal Mapping\nQuantitative studies often rely exclusively on numbers and tables to com-\nmunicate their results. Recent attempts have been made to find graphical\nways to present the outcome of quantitative analysis (Kastellec and Leoni\n2007). However, for many applications in international relations where\nstates are the units of analysis, it might be beneficial to opt for a geographic\nway of showing results pertaining to these. This is a straightforward idea,\nbut might be more difficult to implement in practice. What is required is a\nset of geographic entities that correspond to the commonly used units of\nanalysis, and an easy way to link other variables of interest to these entities.\nCShapes makes it possible to do this, as it provides state polygons that are\ncompatible with the commonly used state lists in political science.\nWe demonstrate the creation of spatial plots using the Fearon and\nLaitin (2003) model for the onset of civil war. Using Model 1 from their\nstudy, we compute the predicted risk of civil war onset and show its geo-\ngraphical variation.5 Figure 3 shows the model predictions for 1985 and\n1995, with darker colors corresponding to a higher predicted risk. We limit\nour presentation here to two years, but it could obviously be repeated for\nother points in time. These maps show how there are many countries with a\nlow predicted risk of conflict, located mostly in Europe and the Americas,\nand that certain subregions contain the countries with higher risks of con-\nflict. One difference between the maps is that the 1995 predicted conflict\n4The R statistical package can be downloaded free of charge (http://www.r-project.org).\n5In the original Fearon and Laitin model, missing values for GDP lead to many cases being dropped\nfrom the original analysis, including cases of civil war, such as Bosnia. Therefore, we replace the original\nGDP variable with a more complete version provided by Gleditsch (2002b).\n98 N. B. Weidmann et al.\npropensity in Africa reaches higher values than in the 1985 example, as\nindicated by the higher number of dark shaded countries in Africa accord-\nGeographic Variables for Countries\nQuantitative analysis on states often requires indicators of certain aspects of\na state's geography. For example, the study by Fearon and Laitin (2003)\nmentioned in the previous paragraph includes a variable for \"roughness of\nterrain,\" measured at the state level. If geographic variables cannot readily\nbe obtained from existing sources, they need to be computed from scratch.\nFor simpler applications, this can be done using the R package, but as indi-\ncators get more complex, advanced GIS software is required. However, the\ncomputation of spatial indicators at the state level--whether it is done in R\nor a more advanced package--requires information about state boundaries\nover time, as provided in CShapes.\nFIGURE 3 Predicted risk of civil war onset for 1985 (top) and 1995 (bottom), computed using.\nModel 1 in Fearon and Laitin (2003). Darker colors correspond to a higher predicted risk of\nconflict (4 shadings, based on a equal-sized class intervals over the range of predicted values).\n  99\nIn this section, we present an example of computing a new spatial indi-\ncator using the CShapes R package. As in the previous section, we study\ncivil war and how it relates to a country's geographic makeup. More pre-\ncisely, we depart from the assumption that a state's risk of experiencing civil\nwar should be related to its capability of repressing dissent in peripheral\nareas. For example, Herbst (2000) argues that the difficult geographies of\nAfrican states can partly account for the many failed attempts at state-building\nin this region. Here, a difficult geography relates to problems of projecting\npower across the entire territory of a state. Unrest in peripheral regions is\nmore likely to develop into full-fledged civil war if the state fails to provide\na sufficient level of control. Existing research has found that distance from\nthe capital is related to a higher risk of conflict. For example, the analysis by\nBuhaug, Cederman, and R\u00f8d (2008) shows that ethnic groups which are\nlocated far away from the capital face a higher risk of conflict. If the hinter-\nland is indeed characterized by lower state control and thus a higher risk of\nconflict, states that have more extensive hinterlands should generally see\nmore conflict.\nIn the following example we consider a simple test of this relationship.\nWe posit that states in which the capital is located at a strategically advanta-\ngeous position should be better able to contain unrest. We further posit that\nthe optimal location for a capital is at the center of the state's boundaries, so\nthat a state can maximize its ability to project power across the state's terri-\ntory. A territorially unbalanced configuration, in which the capital is located\nat a corner or edge of a state, may create a fair amount of distant hinterland\nterritory, where state control is relatively weak and the risk of conflict is\nhigh. As a simple measure of the territorial balance of a state, we consider\nthe deviation between the centroid (that is, the geographic center point of\nits boundaries) and the actual location of the capital. Two cases help to\nillustrate this measure. Figure 4 shows the borders of two African countries,\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria, as well as their capitals\nand their polygon centroids. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (left),\nthe capital Kinshasa is located in the far West of the country, which creates\nlarge hinterlands in the East. Nigeria (right) has a more balanced configura-\ntion, with the capital Abuja located close to the centroid.\nWe compute two indicators for the deviation from the capital to the\npolygon centroid, the first one being the absolute distance between the two\npoints. However, since this deviation is likely to be correlated with the\ncountry's absolute size, we also compute a relative deviation measure by\ndividing the absolute value by the diameter of the country.6 We test the\n6The diameter of a polygon is defined as the maximum distance of any pair of points on the polygon\nboundary. However, for the sake of computational simplicity, here we approximate the polygon diameter\nby the diameter of the polygon's bounding box, i.e. the smallest rectangle with straight North\u00adSouth and\nEast\u00adWest lines that includes the polygon.\nexplanatory impact of both variables on civil war using the Fearon and\nLaitin (2003) dataset.7 As in the original paper, we use logit regression models\nwith conflict onset as the dependent variable. Table 1 reports the results.\nModels 1 and 2 include only our new indicators as independent variables in\n7The original GDP variable was again replaced by a more complete one provided by Gleditsch (2002b),\nsee above.\nFIGURE 4 Illustration of our capital deviation measure, which corresponds to the distance\nbetween the geographic centroid of a polygon and the true location of the capital.\nNote: Standard errors in parentheses.\nthe regression. In Models 3 and 4, we add these variables to the original\nFearon and Laitin Model 1.\nAbsolute distance between capital and centroid seems to be related to\ncivil war onset when included as a single explanatory variable in Model 1.\nAs we hypothesized, we find a significant and positive coefficient. This is\nnot the case for relative capital deviation (Model 3), where we also see a\npositive coefficient, but the estimate is far from statistically significant.\nModel 3 reveals that the positive effect of absolute capital distance disap-\npears once we control for other civil war determinants included in the orig-\ninal model. In conclusion, our analysis provides little evidence that supports\nthe proposed relationship between the optimal capital location and the risk\nof civil war. However, the above measure is very crude and does not take\nother factors into account, that is, the population distribution in the country.\nRather than the deviation from the purely geographic center of gravity, a\nbetter measure would be the deviation from the population center of gravity,\nsince ultimately it is people that need to be controlled by the state to sup-\npress rebellion. Even though this is beyond the scope of this illustrative\nexample, such alternative indicators can be computed using the CShapes\ndata in combination with other geographic datasets.\nDistances Between States\nRegression models with spatial dependence are an important application for\ndata on distances between states. Social scientists are becoming increasingly\nsensitive to how observations pooled over time require special attention to pos-\nsible problems of serial dependence. However, cross-sections--samples of\nobservations at a given point in time--are usually taken to be independent of\none another, and there is less attention to the possibility that observations may\nbe dependent across space. In an influential early comment, Galton (1889)\nargued that an analysis comparing marital institutions across societies could face\ndifficulties in making valid inferences if the observed institutions were the result\nof diffusion processes (hence the name \"Galton's problem\"). Likewise, if\npolicies enacted in one country are the result of emulation of other states or\ncompetitive processes (Simmons and Elkins 2004), the policies of individual\nstates will not be independent of those adopted in other states.\nIn many instances, it is likely that such dependence between observa-\ntions will be a function of spatial distance, since states tend to interact more\nwith proximate countries and closer countries are more likely to serve as\nrole models or reference points. As an illustrative example, consider the\nextent to which states have democratic institutions. Many have argued that\ndemocracy is likely to be a function of economic or social characteristics,\nbut there are many reasons to expect that countries will be more/less likely\nto have democratic institutions if their neighbors have more/less democratic\ninstitutions (see Gleditsch 2002a for a more comprehensive discussion).\nOne way to determine whether a country's degree of democracy\ndepends on that of its neighbors is to examine the similarity between a\ncountry's own institutional makeup and a weighted average of the level of\ndemocracy in its neighboring countries. The latter can be seen as a \"spatial\nlag,\" analogous to the temporal lag of variable. More specifically, we can\nrepresent connections between states by a connectivity matrix C where indi-\nvidual entities cij\nacquire non-zero values if two units i and j are connected\nto one another. The spatial lag of a variable y is then computed by Wy,\nwhere W is a row-normalized version of the connectivity matrix C where\nthe individual rows wi\u00b7\nadd up to 1. A variable displays spatial dependence\nor correlation to the extent that individual observations of yi\ntend to be sim-\nilar to the values of the spatial lag wi\u00b7\ny. CShapes allows us to create a con-\nnectivity matrix C based on different connectivity criteria; for example direct\ncontiguity, distance between capital cities, or minimum distance between\nboundaries.\nIn our example, the outcome of interest--democracy--is also likely to\nbe influenced by other characteristics such as income, which may also be\nspatially correlated. Hence, it is useful to consider spatial dependence in\ndemocracy jointly with what may be attributed to income. One way to do\nthis is to consider democracy (y) as a conditional function of logged per\ncapita income (x1\n) and the spatial lag of democracy, i.e.,\nThis conditional expected value can be estimated via linear regression.\nSuch a regression model is often called a \"spatially lagged y\" model, and\ncan be seen as a spatial analogy to a model with a temporal lag yt-1\non\nthe right hand side. The fact that y appears on both sides of the equation\nimplies a simultaneity problem that makes estimation problematic, but it\nis possible to fit such a model via maximum likelihood. We refer to\nWard and Gleditsch (2008) for further details on spatial dependence,\nconstructing spatial variables, and model estimation, and focus here only\non an example of how measures of spatial connectivities can be derived\nfrom CShapes.\nTable 2 shows the results of an OLS regression of democracy (measured\nby the 21-point POLITY scale) and logged per capita income from Gleditsch\nmodel including a spatial lag. The lag is based on an adjacency matrix\nwhere states are considered connected if within 500 km of one another,\nwhich is computed using the distmatrix() R function provided by CShapes.\nFor simplicity, we drop all islands or observations with no neighbors within\n500 kms. As can be seen, we find a positive and highly significant estimate\nfor the parameter r, indicating that a country's level of democracy is\nE y x x w y\ni\n( ) ^ ^ ^\n= + + \nb b r\nstrongly associated with that of its neighbors. The coefficient estimate for\nthe log of GDP per capita, while still significant, is considerably smaller for\nthe spatial lag model. However, the two parameters have different interpre-\ntations, since assessing the total impact of a change in xi\nin the spatial lag\nmodel would need to take into account the implied feedback between\nobservations.8\nCONCLUSION\nThe geography of the international system plays a major role in quantitative\nresearch, but is often not considered in a systematic manner. In this paper,\nwe have introduced the CShapes project, a geographic dataset of historical\nthat represents state boundaries with polygons. In order to capture changes\nover time, these polygons are assigned a \"lifespan\" during which they are\nactive. The direct representation of state boundaries has a number of advan-\ntages over the creation of separate datasets, e.g., for minimum or capital dis-\ntance, since it avoids problems of consistency and updating. In addition to\nthe GIS dataset, CShapes comes with an accompanying R package that\nenables users who are unfamiliar with GIS to take full advantage of the\ndata. We have illustrated the use of the package with three examples. First,\nthe package allows for the creation of plots to map particular quantities of\ninterest, providing users a quick and easy way to communicate results from\ntheir research. Second, using CShapes, it is possible to compute geographic\nvariables at the state level as for example a measure for the strategic quality\nof the capital location as we have shown. Third, CShapes is a valuable basis\nfor the computation of weights matrices for spatial statistics. The corresponding\n8More specifically, with a spatially lagged y, a change in a right-hand-side xki\nfor country i will first change\nyi\ndirectly, and then indirectly, through the effects of yi\non the neighbors of i, which in turn feed back\nonto i, and reverberate through the system until reaching a new equilibrium. Hence, the full \"equilibrium\nimpact\" needs to be computed using the spatial multiplier (I - rW)-1 (see Ward and Gleditsch 2008).\nTABLE 2 Regression of Democracy on Logged Per Capita Income\nOLS Spatial lag\nt-value z-value\nb\n^\nSE( )\n^\nb b\n^\nSE( )\n^\nb\nr\n^\nfunctions provided in the R package developed for CShapes enable the\ncomputation of different kinds of matrices and make the readily available\nfor model estimation.\nREFERENCES\nBivand, Roger S.
