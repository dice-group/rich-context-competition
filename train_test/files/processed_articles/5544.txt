Patients\nexcluded. All enrolled women were screened\nfor uterine malformations (by hystero-\nscopy), chromosomal abnormalities (karyo-\ntype, also undertaken for their male\npartner), endocrine disorders (fasting and\npost-prandial blood glucose, thyroid\nhormones) and thrombophilia. Table 1 sum-\nmarizes the thrombophilia criteria screened\nfor each patient and the age-matched con-\ntrol subjects. A fasting blood homocysteine\nlevel > 15 mmol/l was considered to be\npathological and defined as HHcy. The\nMTHFR gene mutations of the patient's\nmale partner were not genotyped.\nAn age-matched group of triparous\nwomen without RM and thrombophilia\n(screened for thrombophilia as for the two\nstudy groups) who became pregnant during\nthe same time period and followed-up in the\nsame hospital was used as the control group.\nBaseline demographic and clinical data\nwere collected for all study participants,\nincluding previous number of pregnancies,\nnumber of first-trimester miscarriages,\nprevious intra-uterine fetal death, previous\npre-eclampsia, previous intra-uterine\ngrowth restriction, previous successful deliv-\neries, body mass index (kg/m2), HHcy\nstatus, alcohol consumption status defined\nas any alcohol consumed per day and\nsmoking status defined as >five cigarettes\nper day.\nAll study participants gave their written,\ninformed consent and the study protocol\nwas approved by the Picardie University\nJules Verne Bioethics Committee, Amiens\nUniversity Medical Centre, Amiens, France.\nMTHFR genotyping\nScreening for the C677T MTHFR gene\nmutation was performed according to a\nmethod described previously.18 Briefly, gen-\nomic DNA was extracted from peripheral\nblood using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini\nKit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according\nto the manufacturer's protocol. Blood\nsamples were stored at \u00ad80C prior to ana-\nlysis. Genotyping was performed by poly-\nmerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction\nfragment length polymorphism or real-time\nPCR.

The cycling programme\ninvolved preliminary denaturation at 95C\nfor 10 min, followed by 25 cycles of denatur-\nlowed by a final elongation step at 72C\nfor 7 min. Minisequencing products were\nanalysed by capillary electrophoresis on an\nApplied Biosystems\u00d53130 Genetic Analyzer\n(Applied Biosystems). The reaction included\n9.25 ml Hi-DiTM Formamide (Applied\nLIZ\u00d5 dye Size Standard (Applied\nBiosystems) and 0.5 ml of minisequencing\nproduct. Incubation at 95C for 3 min to\ndenature the minisequencing product was\nperformed prior to electrophoresis. Data\nwere subsequently visualized and analysed\nusing the GeneMapper\u00d5 Software version\nX3.4 (Applied Biosystems).\nStudy treatment groups\nThis study undertook retrospective analyses\nof two groups of patients with the C677T\nMTHFR gene mutation who had been\ntreated with two different protocols during\ntwo different time periods. The first group of\npatients (group 1) was treated between\nprotocol P1 that consisted of the following:\nlow-dose aspirin (Aspegic\u00d5, 100 mg/day;\nSanofi, Gentilly, France) prior to conception\nand up until 35 weeks of amenorrhoea; and\nfolic acid (SpeciaFoldine\u00d5, 5 mg/day;\nTheraplix, Paris, France) as soon as preg-\nnancy was confirmed and up until delivery.\nBecause of the unsatisfactory results with\nthe P1 protocol, the P2 protocol was\nintroduced for patients having the same\ncharacteristics as group 1. Patients in\nconsisted of the following: low-dose aspirin\n(Aspegic\u00d5, 100 mg/day; Sanofi) prior to\nconception and up until 35 weeks of amen-\norrhoea; and folic acid (SpeciaFoldine\u00d5,\n5 mg/day; Theraplix) as soon as pregnancy\nwas confirmed and up until delivery;\ncombined with a LMWH (enoxaparin, sub-\ncutaneous injection; Lovenox\u00d5, 0.4 mg/day;\nAventis, Paris, France) as soon as pregnancy\nwas confirmed (by a plasma b-human\nchorionic gonadotropin assay) and up until\ndelivery. The two active treatment groups\nwere compared with an age-matched control\ngroup (group 3). The control group was\npermitted to receive any antithrombotic and\nvitamin treatments that were considered\nnecessary by their physicians. Fetal devel-\nopment was routinely monitored and no\ndifferences were observed between the three\ngroups. During pregnancy, each woman in\nthe three groups received the same standard\nobstetric care and pregnancy monitoring,\nwith a platelet count control if heparin was\nprescribed.\nStudy outcomes\nThe following pregnancy outcomes in the\nthree groups were analysed: maternal age at\nstart of pregnancy, number of successful\ndeliveries, duration of pregnancy (weeks of\namenorrhoea), infant birth weight, and patho-\nlogical outcomes including first-trimester\nmiscarriage, intra-uterine fetal death,\npre-eclampsia and/or intra-uterine growth\nrestriction (<fifth percentile), and premature\ndeliveries (under 37 weeks of amenorrhoea).\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nthe StatView statistical package, version\n5.0.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA)\nfor Windows\u00d5. Comparisons between the\nthree groups of patients were undertaken\nusing Student's t-test or Mann\u00adWhitney\nU-test for continuous variables\n(mean \u00c6 SD) and 2-test or Fisher's exact\ntest for the first-trimester miscarriage and\ndelivery rates. A P-value < 0.05 was con-\nsidered to be statistically significant.\nResults\nThis longitudinal retrospective study\nenrolled 246 women with three or more\nconsecutive first-trimester recurrent miscar-\nriages who were carrying the C677T\nMTHFR gene mutation. Of these, 171\nzygotes. None of the 677CT women was\nclassified as having HHcy compared with 22\nin group 2; no significant between-group\ndifference). The 246 women who were\ncarrying the C677T MTHFR gene mutation\nformed the two treatment groups (groups 1\nand 2; n \u00bc 123 per group). The age-matched\ncontrol group consisted of 117 pregnant\nwomen. The baseline characteristics, obstet-\nric antecedents and C677T MTHFR gene\nmutation status for the three groups of\npatients are presented in Table 2. There\nwere no significant differences between the\nbaseline characteristics of the three groups\nincluding body mass index, cigarette con-\nsumption and alcohol consumption.

To increase the\npower of this present study, a control group\nof triparous women without RM and\nthrombophilia were used and they demon-\nstrated a similar delivery rate compared with\nthe group of C677T women treated with\naspirin, LMWH and folic acid (86.3%\nversus 79.7%, respectively). A previous\nstudy showed a pregnancy salvage rate of\n43.1% with aspirin alone in women with\nRM and a rescue of 66.8% pregnancies with\naspirin-LMWH therapy in the aspirin-failed\ncases.19 This previous result was in relation\nto the HHcy status in women with polycystic\novary syndrome, insulin resistance and\nobesity.19 In the present study, only 8.9%\nof women had HHcy (22 women with the\n677TT mutation and none of those with\nthe 677CT mutation), so this status was not\nthe explanation for the preventive effect of\nthe combined therapy of aspirin, LMWH\nand folic acid. However, the administration\nof 5 mg/day folic acid could have normalized\nthe homocysteine level, but this treatment\nwas undertaken in both groups 1 and 2.\nHHcy increases the monocyte secretion of\nprocoagulants and cytokines (e.g. interleu-\nkin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant pro-\ntein-1), which attract white blood cells and\ncontribute to an alteration of the endothe-\nlium that results in venous thrombosis and\nplacental insufficiency.20 In a review of the\nliterature on HHcy that included 35 studies\nwith a total of 7167 patients, first-trimester\nmiscarriages were shown to be associated\nwith HHcy with a relative risk (RR) of 6.25\nIn contrast, this hypothesis was not sup-\nported by two other studies that showed\nthat: (i) homocysteine levels did not appear\nto be related to the MTHFR genotype; and\n(ii) first-trimester RM also occurred in\npatients with normal plasma homocysteine\nwith three or more previous miscarriages\norrhoea) and 200 control women free of fetal\nloss or complications of pregnancy, the\nfrequency of CT or TT MTHFR gene muta-\ntions was significantly higher in the RM\ngroup than in the control group\nThe negative effect of MTHFR gene\nmutations on RM remains the subject of\nconsiderable debate.

At the start of pregnancy\n(between 5 and 8 weeks of amenorrhoea),\nthe uterine spiral arteries are obstructed by\nplugs of trophoblasts, which are essential for\nsubsequent development of the pregnancy.\nFrom 8 to 13 weeks of amenorrhoea\nonwards, disaggregation of the plugs\nprompts the second migration of tropho-\nblasts into the maternal arteries and the\ninvasion of the myometrial spiral uterine\nartery wall (disappearance of the notch).32\nIn cases of thrombotic factors such as\nC677T MTHFR gene mutations, clots\nform upstream of the plugs and persist\nafter plug disaggregation, leading to a\nblockage of the chorionic villous vascular-\nization and the absence of the second\ntrophoblast migration (Figure 1).32 These\nanomalies are associated with an increase\nof pregnancy-associated vascular patholo-\ngies, such as pre-eclampsia, vascular intra-\nuterine growth restriction and placenta\nabruption;33,34 and a higher frequency of\nC677T MTHFR gene mutations was found\nin patients presenting with these\nWith regard to preventing RM, because\nantithrombotic treatment in thrombophilic\npregnant women with previous RM has\nbeen shown to improve their pregnancy-\nrelated prognosis,36\u00ad38 the possibility of\nstarting early antithrombotic treatment has\nbeen studied.
