The NHANES-III database is a valuable resource for assessing\nchildren's respiratory health and certain risk factors, but lacks monitoring data to estimate subjects' exposures to ambient air pollutants. Since the 1970s,\nEPA has regularly monitored levels of several ambient air pollutants across the country and these data may be used to estimate NHANES subject's\nexposure to ambient air pollutants. The first stage of the project eventually evolved into assessing different estimation methods before adopting the\nestimates to evaluate respiratory health. Specifically, this paper describes an effort using EPA's AIRS monitoring data to estimate ozone and PM10 levels\nat census block groups. We limited those block groups to counties visited by NHANES-III to make the project more manageable and apply four different\ninterpolation methods to the monitoring data to derive air concentration levels. Then we examine method-specific differences in concentration levels and\ndetermine conditions under which different methods produce significantly different concentration values. We find that different interpolation methods do\nnot produce dramatically different estimations in most parts of the US where monitor density was relatively low. However, in areas where monitor density\nwas relatively high (i.e., California), we find substantial differences in exposure estimates across the interpolation methods. Our results offer some insights\ninto terms of using the EPA monitoring data for the chosen spatial interpolation methods.\nKeywords: AIRS monitors, ozone, particulate matter, respiratory health, NHANES, spatial interpolation, kriging.\nIntroduction\nMany aspects of the outdoor environment, including air\nquality, can adversely affect health in general. But outdoor\nair quality may be the most influential factor, among others,\nin affecting respiratory health. A number of studies have\nexamined the relationships between ambient air quality and\nrespiratory health effects (Detels et al., 1987; Abbey et al.,\nNorris et al., 1999). One approach to investigating these\nrelationships is to collect environmental data coincidentally\nwith health data so that the environmental data can\ndirectly support analysis of health outcomes (Stern et al.,\nof this type are costly, they are typically conducted over\nrelatively confined areas with small sample sizes. An alternate\napproach is to use existing health and environmental\ndatabases.\nUnfortunately, most databases for general health surveys\ndo not have detailed environmental and/or air quality\ninformation. Commonly used health data sets include the\nseries of National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurveys (NHANES). The National Center for Health\nStatistics (NCHS) completed the third NHANES\nprovides very detailed health information on a statistically\nrepresentative sample of the US population. NHANES-III\n2.

The views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not\nnecessarily reflect the views or policies of the U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency.\nwww.nature.com/jea\nincludes a series of survey questions on various aspects of\nhealth history of the subjects, including detailed respiratory\nhealth data and quantitative spirometry tests of respiratory\nfunction. These data provide a rich source of health outcome\ndata that potentially can be linked to exposure estimates of\nambient air pollution, but they do not provide any air quality\ninformation. The lack of air quality information is not\nunique in HNAHES, but is quite common among general\nhealth survey data.\nMany researchers have used EPA air-monitoring data\nto estimate ambient air exposure as risk factors for\nhuman health effects. Using NHANES as an example, we\nare aware of only several studies that have already linked this\ndata set to environmental exposure estimates derived from\nEPA air quality data to assess potential associations between\nenvironmental exposures and health effects. Chestnut et al.\n(1991) used EPA air-monitoring data to examine the\nassociation between total suspended particulates and lung\nfunction in adults from an earlier NHANES-I survey.\nSchwartz (1989) estimated ambient air concentrations of\npollutants based on EPA monitoring data and then linked\nthese estimates to NHANES-II children's respiratory func-\ntion data. A recent study by Schwartz (2001) used\nNHANES-III data to examine air pollutants as cardiovas-\ncular risk factors.\nIn these studies, air pollution and health data were\ncollected in independent surveys, so that human subjects'\nresidences and air monitors were not colocated. As a result,\nair pollution concentrations needed to be interpolated\nbetween monitors in order to estimate exposures to study\nsubjects. At this time, no consensus exists as to the\nappropriate method for interpolating between irregularly\nspaced monitors. Indeed, the NHANES-based studies\ncited above all used different interpolation methods.\nChestnut et al. (1991) identified a central urban area for\neach NHANES-I location and averaged all monitoring\ndata located in that area. Schwartz (1989) assigned\nsubjects the average of pollutant levels from all monitors\nlocated within 10 miles of the population centroid of the\ncensus tract in which they resided. Schwartz (2001) used the\nweighted average of all monitors in each subject's county of\nresidence plus the adjoining counties. These weights were\nproportional to the inverse of the square of the distance\nbetween the centroid of the residence's block group and the\nmonitor.\nGiven that different interpolation methods are found in the\nliterature for estimating ambient air quality to assess health\noutcomes, our objective is to evaluate spatial interpolation\nmethods methodically to assess the degree to which different\nmethods influence the estimated air pollutant levels. Many\npapers have attempted to interpolate levels of air pollutants\nand some efforts intended to incorporate more than one\nmeasurement (e.g., Brown et al., 1994) and explore their\nrelationships to health outcomes (e.g., Duddek et al., 1995).\nThe current paper addresses a much simpler type of situation\nwith only one measurement in each estimation process. Our\nultimate objective is to evaluate how different interpolation\nmethods will affect the assessment of relationships between\nair pollutant levels and respiratory health captured by\nNHANES data, but our results reported in this paper will\nbe applicable to the analysis of other health outcomes related\nto air pollutants.\nMethods and materials\nData\nIn NHANES-III, data were gathered from 82 unique\ncollected address information to geocode each subject to the\nnearest census block group (BG), which, in general, contains\npeople (http://www.census.gov). But NCHS does not release\nthis information to the public in order to protect subjects'\nconfidentiality. Only the identification of the county in which\nthe subject resided is available to the public, provided the\nmately half of the children in NHANES-III resided in these\nlarge counties. The remaining children resided in small\ncounties that are not identified by NCHS in the public\ndatabase.\nIn order to meet Clean Air Act requirements, every\nstate has established a network of air-monitoring stations\nfor regulated pollutants (CO, NO2\n, and\n). Data from these monitors are submitted to and\nstored in EPA's AIRS database. The vast majority of\nthese monitors sample air quality in the country's\ndensely populated urban areas. Based on the current\nscientific evidence of associations between exposure to\nvarious air pollutants and adverse respiratory health\n1999), we limited our study to estimating exposures\n. This paper presents our\nmethods and results for estimating exposures to outdoor\nambient levels of O3\npurposes only. Owing to confidentiality constraints, we\nneeded to estimate ambient air concentrations in every BG\nin every county in which NHANES-III subjects resided.\nThese estimates were then linked to subjects by NCHS\npersonnel using the confidential location information for\nsubsequent analyses. For this preliminary work, we linked\nall the NHANES-III children to the 1990 concentration\nestimates, but eventually, we will link children by the\nyear when they were examined to the year-specific monitored\ndata.\nComparison of spatial interpolation methods Wong et al.\nExposure Metrics\nThe AIRS database reports O3\nas an hourly average\nconcentration. O3\nconcentrations usually exhibit a daily\ndiurnal pattern and a seasonal pattern. Owing to the strong\nseasonality of O3\nconcentrations, many states limit their O3\nmonitoring to a certain portion of the year, termed the ozone\nseason, the length of which varies from one area of the\ncountry to another (US EPA, 1996a). As we were interested\nin chronic health effects, we sought to identify one statistic\nthat would characterize long-term exposure to O3\nat each\nlocation. Little consensus exists as to which statistic is the\nmost appropriate. The US EPA (1996a) recommended the\nmaximum 8-h moving average as an appropriate statistic.\nBased upon this recommendation and our analysis of O3\ndiurnal and seasonal patterns in the NHANES-III counties,\nwe decided, as an initial effort, to compute a ``summer\ndaytime ozone'' metric defined as the hourly average from\nThe AIRS database reports PM10\nconcentrations every\ncharacterized exposure to PM10\nThe first one was the annual average provided by AIRS. As\nthere is a strong seasonal and geographical pattern in daily\nlevels, we also wanted to capture potential exposure\nseasons. To do this, we selected the\ncalendar quarter with the highest average for each monitor as\nthe maximum quarterly average, our second PM10\nmetric.\nBoth averages are weighted, with the weights adjusting for\nchanges to the scheduled sampling frequency of the monitors.\nQuality Assurance of AIRS Data\nTo develop estimates of O3\nconcentrations for each\nBG with an NHANES-III child, we tested four spatial\ninterpolation methods. Before conducting the interpolation\nprocedures, we performed validation procedures to ensure\nthat (1) the monitored data were valid and/or sufficiently\ncomplete to be used in the study, and (2) the monitor\nlocation information was correct.\n(1) Evaluation of monitoring data completeness/validity:\nBased on the current literature (Schwartz, 1989; Abbey et al.,\nestablished the following rules for determining if monitored\ndata were valid and appropriate for inclusion in our study.\nFor daytime summer O3\n, we required: (1) at least eight valid\nhourly readings out of nine during the specified time interval\nbe included into the daily average; and (2) at least 75%, or\nto September for that monitor to be included into the\nsummer daytime average.\nmonitor, AIRS records the percent of\nactual data values that were reported as compared to the\nnumber of data values that should have been reported for the\nmonitor/year or quarter (PCT_OBS). We computed the\nminimum value of PCT_OBS for each quarterly interval for\neach monitor, and required that at least 75% of the possible\nsamples be taken in every quarter of the year for that monitor\nto be included. Using this value ensured that all four quarters\nin the year had been sufficiently sampled.\n(2) Evaluation of monitor location information: Primary\nlocation information presented in the AIRS database consists\nof (1) the latitude and longitude of each monitor, and (2) a\nmonitor identification number whose first five digits are the\nFIPS code of the state and county in which the monitor is\nsupposed to be located. We mapped monitor locations based\non their reported latitude and longitude readings. We\ncompared counties as identified by the first five digits of the\nmonitor identification number and the counties where the\nmonitors were located according to their latitude and\nlongitude readings, assuming that the first five digits of the\nmonitor identification numbers represented the monitor's\ncorrect state and county. Thus, any mistakes in AIRS on the\nlocation of a monitor were assumed to be the result of\nincorrect latitude/longitude entries. As a result, we made\nminor latitude or longitude adjustments on two of 739 O3\nmonitors.\nInterpolation Methods\nWe selected four different interpolation methods to estimate\nair concentrations at the census BG level.\nThese methods have been used either in NHANES-related\n(1) spatial averaging, (2) nearest neighbor, (3) inverse\ndistance weighting, and (4) kriging.\nAll four methods are weighted average methods, and they\nall have the same basic mathematical formulation. That is,\nwe want to compute the air pollution concentration, z at an\nunsampled point, x0\n, given a set of neighboring sampled\nvalues zi\n, sampled at locations denoted by xi\n. The\ninterpolating relationship is\n\u00de \u00bc\nX\nn\nli\n\u00c1 z\u00f0xi\nX\nn\nli\nwhere li\nrepresents the weights assigned to each of the\nneighboring values, and the sum of the weights is one. For\nthese approaches, interpolation involves: (a) defining the\nsearch area or neighborhood around the point to be\npredicted; (b) locating the observed data points within this\nneighborhood; and (c) assigning appropriate weights to each\nof the observed data points.\nThe four interpolation methods differ only in their choice\nof sample weights. In brief, with spatial averaging, we\nselected all sampled values within a fixed distance from the\npoint of interest and assigned the same fractional weight,\nbased on the number of monitors, to each of them. With the\nnearest-neighbor method, we chose only the single sampled\nComparison of spatial interpolation methods\nWong et al.\nvalue that was closest to the point of interest and assigned it a\nweight of 1. With inverse distance weighting, we assigned\nsamples that were closer to the point of interest of\ncorrespondingly larger weights; and with kriging, we assigned\nweights based on the spatial autocorrelation statistics of the\nsampled data set.\n(1) Spatial averaging: Several studies (Chestnut et al.,\nspatial averaging method. Schwartz (1989) also used spatial\naveraging to study air pollution as a risk factor for\ndecrements in children's lung function. Even though we\nbelieve that using 10 miles as the neighborhood definition in\nSchwartz's study was subjective and not well justified, we\nreplicated Schwartz's (1989) approach so that we could\ndirectly compare our results to his work. Therefore, for each\ncounty with an NHANES-III child, we selected all O3\nand\nmonitors within 10 miles of each BG centroid,\ncalculated the average of the values from the selected\nmonitors and assigned that value to the appropriate BG. If\nno monitor was found within 10 miles of a particular BG,\nthen that BG was assigned a missing value for the specific\npollutant.\n(2) Nearest neighbor: Each BG was assigned the air\nconcentration level of the monitor nearest to its centroid\nregardless of how far away the monitor was located. This\neliminated the search radius as a parameter in the interpola-\n(3) Inverse distance weighting (IDW): Interpolation\nweights in IDW are computed as a function of the distance\nbetween observed sample sites and the site at which the\nprediction has to be made (Gunnink and Burrough, 1996).\nAs observed values that were closer to the point of interest\nwere more heavily weighted, a larger search window could be\nused that still preserved some of the local variations in\npollutant levels. Data from all monitors within a 250 km\nsearch window were included in the IDW interpolation for\n. The 250 km radius was chosen to ensure\nthat all block groups in the counties of interest had an\ninterpolated value for both O3\n. We have tested\nother smaller windows (60 and 100 km), but through cross-\nvalidation, we found that the accuracy of interpolation was\nnot too sensitive to the window size. However, choosing\nsmaller windows will leave some of the block groups of\ninterest without an estimated value. Similar to Abbey et al.\nused li\nas the weight, where di\nis the distance between\nsets of data points and the point to be predicted (Burrough\n(4) Kriging: The spatial variation of air pollution\nmeasurements is complex but is not generally unstructured.\nIt is almost always spatially dependent on some scale, with\nthis dependence referred to as spatial autocorrelation\nmay then be overlain by more or less random local variation.\nThe whole can be described by a variogram that summarizes\nthe variation.\nA variogram expresses the degree of similarity between two\nobservations separated by a given distance (the lag). An\nempirical variogram can be computed from sampled data\nusing the following expression:\ng\u00f0h\u00de \u00bc\nX\nM\u00f0h\u00de\nfz\u00f0xi\n\u00de \u00c0 z\u00f0xi\nwhere g(h) is the estimated semivariance at a separation\ndistance, or lag h, z(xi\n) and z(xi\n\u00feh) are the observed values\nat xi\nand xi\n\u00feh separated by h, of which there are M(h) pairs\n(Oliver, 1996). In most cases, the semivariance increases as\nthe distance separating pairs of points (i.e., the lag) increases,\nindicating that points close together tend to have more\nsimilar values than those far apart.\nThe basic idea behind a kriged interpolation is to use the\nvariogram to compute weights li\n, which minimize the\nvariance in the estimated value. The first step in this process\nis to fit a function to the empirical variogram such that\nsemivariances can be computed at all separation distances, or\nlags. For this study, we used spherical variograms for all of\nthe models (Burrough and McDonnell, 1998). We chose the\nspherical specification because it is one of the most commonly\nchosen forms, and the purpose of our study is to compare\ncommonly used methods. Once the model variogram is fit to\nthe empirical data, it is used to compute the weights li\nsuch\nthat the estimation variance is less than the variance for any\nother linear combination of the observed values (Isaaks and\nComputing the empirical variogram requires that one first\nselects regions over which the sampled processes can be\nreasonably assumed to be homogeneous, with a constant\nmean and variance. For PM10\n, we followed the precedent of\nEPA (1996b), in which the country was divided into seven\naerosol regions, each with similar PM10\ncharacteristics.\nOwing to the location of the monitors relative to our\ncounties of interest and the boundaries of the seven regions,\nwe made minor changes to the boundaries of two regions and\nended up with five PM10\nregions (Northwest, Southern\nCalifornia, Southeast, Industrial Midwest, and Northeast)\ncovering most of the NHANES counties (see Figure 1). We\ncomputed separate variograms for annual average and\nquarterly maximum PM10\nfor each of our five regions. As\nindicated in Figure 1, we did not specify a Southwest region.\nAlthough this area had several NHANES-III counties of\ninterest, there were too few PM10\nmonitors, as indicated in\nFigure 2, to support kriging.\nOur development of variograms for O3\nkriging differed\nfrom the approach we used for PM10\n. We examined the\nspatial statistics for each of the counties of interest and\nlooked for evidence of spatial continuity, or the presence of\nspatial autocorrelation patterns. Unfortunately, all regions of\nComparison of spatial interpolation methods Wong et al.\ninterest, except Southern California, did not exhibit a spatial\nautocorrelation pattern of O3\n. Therefore, we could not justify\ndividing the country into O3\nregions analogous to the PM10\nregions.\nSeveral different forms of kriging are commonly used.\nWith simple kriging one assumes that the mean value is\nknown, while with ordinary kriging the mean value is\ndetermined during the interpolation. For nonstationary\nvariation, where there is drift (or trend) in the data, universal\nkriging or kriging with intrinsic random functions should be\nordinary kriging for all the interpolations for O3\n.\nFigure 2.

The modified five aerosol regions.\nComparison of spatial interpolation methods\nWong et al.\nIn the current study, we observed situations in which a\nstatistically significant drift could be detected in the sampled\ndata; however, the sources of the drift were not evident. As\nsuch, we believed that it was better to apply the more\nconservative ordinary kriging approach, rather than to risk\nextrapolating the data drift to areas in which no drift exists.\nResults\nOf the 830 ozone monitors in the US and its territories in\nvalidity criteria. Several PM10\nmonitors were located at the\nsame site. We computed the mean values of the colocated\nmonitors, resulting in 732 distinct monitoring locations. Two\nmonitors and two PM10\nmonitors were in the correct\nstate, but actually several counties away from the correct\ncounty indicated by the monitor's ID. By adjusting either the\nreported latitude or longitude, but not both for each monitor,\nassuming that errors were incurred on entering the coordinate\ninformation, we were able to place all four monitors into the\ncorrect counties, but not necessarily the exact locations,\nbased on their identification numbers. The locations of the\nmonitors are shown in\nFigure 2. Although the O3\nmonitors were separate\nand distinct, both types of monitors appear to be colocated in\nsome instances.\nTable 1 presents summary descriptive statistics for the 1990\nmonitors. Most of the\nextreme O3\nvalues (highest and lowest) were recorded in\nCalifornia. Maximum PM10\nlevels were observed in the\neastern part of the country primarily in the summer, and in\nthe western part of the country primarily in the fall and\nwinter. This is similar to the patterns noted in EPA (1996b).\nSummer Daytime Ozone: Interpolated Values\nOnly the variograms computed for California showed\ncharacteristics of spatial continuity for summer daytime\nozone. Variograms computed for the other counties of\ninterest did not display consistent trends with separation\ndistances, and model variograms could not be fitted to the\ndata. These findings imply that simple kriging methods may\nnot be appropriate for those places. Therefore, kriging was\nconducted for O3\nin California only. Table 1 also presents\nsummary statistics based on the results of the four\ninterpolation methods for all the counties of interest. Of the\n56,721 BGs within the counties of interest, we could not\nconduct spatial averaging in 15% of these BGs because they\ndid not have at least one O3\nmonitor within 10 miles of their\ncentroid. Also, the summary statistics for kriging were based\nonly on the counties in California where variograms could be\nconstructed.\nThe four methods produced fairly different estimates of air\npollution concentrations between sample locations. Mapped\nexamples of the interpolations of O3\nfor Los Angeles county\nare shown in Figure 3. IDW predicted a fairly uniform\nconcentration across the entire county, with a slight decrease\ntoward the coast. Kriged values increased much more\nstrongly from the coast to the inland. Nearest-neighbor\ninterpolations were a patchwork of areas of constant values,\nand spatial averaging was notable in the number of locations\nin the county for which interpolated values were not\ncomputed. Note that air pollution concentrations are\ndisplayed in these maps only at the resolution of BGs, so\nisopleths reflect BG boundaries and are not smooth.\nTable 1.

The mean value for IDW was significantly larger\nthan the other three means (based upon Duncan and Tukey\nsignificance of means tests, P o 0.05), while the mean values\nfor the other three methods were not significantly different\nfrom each other. These comparison tests were not strictly\nvalid statistically because significant spatial autocorrelation\nexisted in each sample, but they provided a useful means of\ninterpreting the trends in the data.\nAnnual Average and Maximum Quarterly Average:\nInterpolated Values\nModel variograms were fit to empirical data in each of the\naerosol regions (Figure 4). The strongest signals of\nspatial continuity, as shown in Figure 4, were found in the\nSoutheast, Northwest, and Southern California regions.\nEvidence of spatial continuity in the Northeast and Industrial\nMidwest was much less definitive. In particular, semivar-\niances computed for the Industrial Midwest remained less\nthan the total sample variance until separation distances of\napproximately 700 km. This separation distance indicates a\nlack of spatial continuity in that region.\nTable 1 also provides summary statistics for annual\nbased on the results of the four different\ninterpolation methods for all the counties of interest.

Kriging was not performed\nin 4.6% of the total BGs where they were in the four counties\nin southwestern US not included in the five PM10\nregions (see\nthe kriging discussion in the last section).\nThe four interpolation methods were also performed,\nwhere appropriate, for the maximum quarterly PM10\naverages. The last part in Table 1 presents summary statistics\nbased on the results of the four different interpolation\nmethods for all the counties of interest. Even though the\nabsolute levels of the estimates based upon the maximum\nquarterly averages were higher than those based upon the\nannual averages, they correlated very well spatially so that\nthe relative levels for PM10\nmaximum quarterly averages\nwere similar to those using annual average PM10\nmetric.\nInterpolated Method Comparisons\nTo compare interpolation results, we computed correlation\ncoefficients for pairs of methods across counties.

The range values for O3\nwere distributed approxi-\nmately normally, implying that differences in interpolation\nestimates were moderately high for a substantial percentage\nof BGs. The distributions of the ranges for the annual and\nmaximum quarterly averages of PM10\nwere similar to each\nother in that most BGs have ranges below 15 mg/m3, with the\nmajority of values less than 7 mg/m3. As less than 25% of all\nthe BGs of interest had interpolated O3\nvalues from all four\nmethods, we relaxed the comparison criterion for O3\nslightly\nby including BGs, provided two or more interpolation\nmethods were used. This resulted in a positively skewed\nSeparation distance (km)\nSemivariance\nSeparation distance (km)\nSemivariance\nSeparation distance (km)\nSemivariance\nSeparation distance (km)\nSemivariance\nSeparation distance (km)\nSemivariance\nNorthwest Southern California\nIndustrial Midwest Northeast\nSoutheast\nFigure 4.

In this case,\nmore than 50% of BGs had a difference of less than 4 ppb O3\nbetween the highest and lowest interpolation estimates.\nTo further evaluate the differences in results from different\ninterpolation methods, we selected a small fraction of the\nBGs that actually contained an NHANES subject. We\nrepeated our analysis of range using these BGs. We created\nfrequency distributions of block groups by the range\ndistributions of O3\n, and annual and maximum quarterly\n. For all three metrics, the distributions\nwere positively skewed, indicating that differences in the\nestimates derived from different interpolation methods were\nrelatively small in most of the BGs covered by the NHANES.\nw2 statistics indicate that these new distributions were not\nsignificantly different (P o 0.05) from the range distributions\nfor all 56,721 BGs. We also computed new range distribu-\ntions for California, as it was the only state having estimates\nfrom all four methods. The distribution of the range of\nfor the selected BGs in California was also not\nsignificantly different from the range distributions of all\ncounties in California having all four methods applied (w2,\nP o 0.05). To assess the geographical distribution of\ndifferences between methods, we computed the maximum\nobserved range for different annual PM10\nestimates within\neach of the 82 counties. More than half of the 82 counties\nhad a maximum range for PM10\nestimates less than 10 mg/\nm3, a relatively small difference.\nSo far, our methods adopted to evaluate results from\ndifferent interpolation methods are quite lenient. Therefore,\n``leave-one-out'' cross-validations were also performed to\nprovide a more quantitative comparison of the interpolation\nmethods. By this method, samples were dropped sequentially\nand the remaining samples were used to interpolate the value\nat the location of the dropped sample. The interpolated\nvalues were plotted and regressed against the actual measured\nvalues, and the R2 value and coefficients from the resulting\nregression were examined. Cross-validations for different\ninterpolation methods (kriging, nearest neighbor, and spatial\naverage) were performed only in Southern California where\nresults from all three methods were available. Table 2 reports\nsome of the results. All methods were minimally biased, with\nregression coefficients close to 1. The R2 value for kriging was\nthe lowest among the three methods for this limited subset of\nthe data. All three coefficients are significant statistically with\nPo0.05. The coefficients for the nearest and spatial\naveraging methods are not significantly different from each\nother using a 95% confidence interval, but they are signifi-\ncantly different both from one and the coefficient for the krig-\ning method (although not significantly different using 90%\nconfidence intervals). However, the regression coefficients\nindicate that kriging produces slightly less biased results than\nthe other two methods, despite the fact that overall the three\nmethods perform reasonably well in Southern California.\nDiscussion\nIn this initial phase of this project, we have compiled ambient\nair pollution data sets and implemented interpolation\nmethods to estimate air pollution concentrations across the\ncountry at NHANES-III locations. We have also performed\nsome preliminary comparisons between methods. Based on\nthis work, we have identified several issues regarding the\nimplementation of the different interpolation methods, and\nwe have also drawn some conclusions regarding the\ndifferences between the estimates produced by the different\ninterpolation methods.\nImplementation of Interpolation Methods\nTwo points regarding the implementation of these different\ninterpolation methods merit further discussion. First, the\nchoice of search radius can be important for interpolation by\nIDW and by spatial averaging. A large search radius\nincorporates monitor values that are very distant from the\npoint of interest and can lead to smoother interpolated\nsurfaces. However, a large search radius may also use a\nsample that is so distant that its relationship to the air\npollution levels at the location of interest is tenuous.\nConversely, a small search radius can fail to generate\ninterpolated values for a large subset of locations, but\ngenerally provides more conservative estimates of concentra-\ntion values. Little guidance exists for establishing an optimal\nvalue for this search radius, so our methods for choosing\nsearch radii were somewhat ad hoc. For IDW, we selected a\nsearch radius that ensured that the interpolations produced\nresults for all of the counties of interest in the study. For\nspatial averaging, we followed the precedent of Schwartz\n(1989) and selected a 10-mile search radius. These decisions\nwere arbitrary, and exploring the effects of different search\nradii was beyond the scope of the present study. Further-\nmore, in our comparisons between interpolation methods, we\nfound only small differences for a majority of the study areas,\nand for these locations, the search radii probably did not\nexert a strong influence on the results.\nSecond, we achieved limited success in fitting model\nvariograms to air-monitoring data. Other researchers have\nreported similar difficulties in computing variograms from air\n, we were able to\nfit variograms for counties in California, but in general, it\nTable 2. Results from cross-validation based upon ozone data in\nSouthern California.\nKriging Nearest neighbor Spatial averaging\nComparison of spatial interpolation methods\nWong et al.\nappeared that the density of O3\nair monitors outside of\nCalifornia was too sparse to accurately estimate variograms\nfor other counties of interest. The success of developing the\nvariograms in California can be explained by two factors.\nFirst, the density of O3\nmonitors in California was much\ngreater than anywhere else in the country (Figure 2). Second,\nthe topography of California is unique, as the urban areas at\nthe coast are typically bordered by mountains slightly inland.\nThe mountains present a barrier to the movement of O3\n, so\nconcentrations persist inland at the base of the\nmountain chains, and low O3\nconcentrations are found near\nthe coast. Thus, the spatial patterns in the distribution of O3\nin California tend to be relatively static. Outside of\nCalifornia, we found no compelling reason to force\nvariogram models where the empirical data did not show\ncharacteristics of spatial continuity and did not appear to\nsupport interpolation by kriging. In other words, applica-\ntions of kriging techniques to interpolate air pollutant levels\nhave to be justified by the presence of spatial relationship\ncaptured by the empirical data. Forcing the data into a\nkriging framework without empirical evidence may commit\nmodel specification errors.\n, we observed reasonable evidence of spatial\nautocorrelation for three of our five regions (Northwest, LA\nBasin, and Southeast), but did not find strong signals in the\nNortheast and Industrial Midwest. Again, the different\nobserved behaviors probably are caused by different monitor\ndistributions and densities. A visual inspection of monitor\nlocations suggested that the monitor network was more\nhighly clustered in the Northeast and Industrial Midwest,\nand thus, poorly suited for assessing the degree of spatial\nvariability in the monitored data. As variograms computed\nin some of the regions appeared robust, we felt that\nit was likely that some spatial continuity existed in the\nIndustrial Midwest and Northeast. As such, we specified\nmodel variograms for these two regions that best represented\nthe regional trends suggested by the semivariance values and\nthat agreed with the patterns established in the other three\nregions. This approach may not be the best to deal with ill-\nbehaved variograms, but for demonstration and illustrative\npurposes, we believe the method still produced reasonable\nresults.\nOverall, we believe that the air-monitoring network is\npoorly suited for estimating spatial autocorrelation of\naggregated air pollution measurements. The monitors have\nhistorically been placed in locations where exceedences of air\nquality standards are expected, and therefore tend to be\nclustered in urban areas. Rural areas have relatively few\nmonitors, and so the distribution of monitors is biased\ntoward areas of higher pollution concentrations. To compute\naccurately the spatial statistics of air pollution distributions,\nmore evenly distributed monitors are required. This will be\nan important issue to consider when we evaluate the linked\nNHANES-III and interpolated air concentration data, since\nalmost half of the children live in more urbanized areas and\nhalf in more rural areas.\nComparisons of Interpolation Methods\nIn general, correlation coefficients and our analysis of the\nrange of interpolation estimates in each BG suggest that\ndifferent interpolation methods did not generate dramatically\ndifferent results in most of the BGs and for most of the\ncounties visited by NHANES-III. BGs with larger ranges of\ninterpolated values were mostly found in California within\nseveral major metropolitan areas, and in several cities along\nthe Northeast Corridor. Note that California is one of the\nlargest states in terms of population and 25% of the\nNHANES-III children live in California.\nTo better understand the relationships between different\ninterpolation methods, we compared pairs of methods in\nscatter plots. Examples of these plots are shown in Figure 5,\nwhere kriged estimates are plotted against IDW estimates of\n. In Figure 5a, interpolated values for\nall of the BGs in the study are shown. The two estimates are\nstrongly correlated, but internal structures are discernible\nwithin the cloud of points. The origin of these structures can\nbe better understood when individual scatter plots are drawn\nfor each county. In Figures 5b and c, we present two\nexamples of these county-specific plots (Figure 5b: Los\nAngeles County, CA, USA and Figure 5c: Duval County,\nFL, USA, respectively). These two counties were selected to\nKrige\nIDW\nAll counties\nKrige\nIDW\nLos Angeles, CA\nKrige\nIDW\nDuval, FL\nFigure 5. Scatter plot comparison between kriged and IDW estimates\nfor (a) all counties, (b) Los Angeles, CA, USA, and (c)\nDuval, FL, USA.\nComparison of spatial interpolation methods Wong et al.\nshow examples of the two distinct types of relationships that\nwe observed between kriged and IDW estimates.\nIn Figure 5b, we observed a point pattern that occurred\nfrequently when comparing IDW and kriging. The plotted\npoints fell along a shallowly sloped line with several sharp\ndeviations. These two interpolation methods presented very\ndifferent pictures of the distribution of air pollution\nconcentrations across the county. IDW severely damped\nvariations in value, so that most estimated values tended\ntoward a narrow range of values, while kriging estimates\nspanned a wider range. Each deviation from the diagonal line\nwas a manifestation of the IDW-generated egg-shaped region\nof sharply higher or lower concentrations that surrounded\nmonitors within the county (see Figure 3).\nMore importantly, in the plot for the second county\n(Figure 5c: Duval, FL, USA), both IDWand kriged estimate\nvalues fell within a narrow range relative to the range of\npossible values observed across the entire country. In\ncounties with very few or no closely located monitors, we\nwould expect a narrow range of estimates across the county,\nas the variability of air pollution at that location is poorly\nquantified, and interpolation methods cannot impute varia-\nbility without more monitored values. We observed a similar\nnarrow distribution of interpolation estimates for more than\nhalf of the NHANES-III counties.\nThe contrast between Figures 5b and c suggests that the\nimportance of the interpolation method depends strongly\nupon the nature of the local monitor network. In regions of\nthe country in which monitors are sparse, all interpolation\nmethods converge to a similar, narrow range of predictions.\nWhen the nearest monitor for a given BG is relatively far\naway, different interpolation methods will use the same\nmonitor for estimation, and therefore the results will be\nsimilar or identical. In areas of the country where monitors\nare dense, different interpolation methods can generate vastly\ndifferent predictions of the spatial distribution of pollutants\nbecause monitors being used will be weighted differently by\ndifferent methods. This conclusion is counterintuitive, but is\nwell-supported by the results of our study.\nOwing to the exploratory nature of this project, many of\nour choices of parameters and interpolation methods seemed\narbitrarily constrained by the types of data that were\navailable and by the nationwide scope of the study area.\nNevertheless, our findings suggest that for a majority of\nNHANES study areas where monitors are sparse, the\nsimplest interpolation method, nearest neighbor, may per-\nform as well as any of the other methods. In California and\nother locations, where monitor density is relatively high, the\nselection of interpolation method must be approached more\ncarefully. The fundamental issue is whether the spatial\nsampling intensity is adequate to capture the spatial\nstructure, if any, possessed in the data. If the sampling is\ntoo sparse, we may not have sufficient information to\ndescribe the spatial structure if it does exist, and therefore\ndifferent methods may not perform dramatically different.\nBut if we have relatively intense samples and the spatial\nstructure may be captured, then the selection of the method\nshould be made with care so that the interpolation method\ncan fully utilize the spatial information captured by the\nsamples. Surely, how dense the sample should be is\nphenomenon- and geography-dependent.\nKriging is generally thought to produce the most realistic\nestimates of values between monitors, and we have success-\nfully applied the method for O3\nin California and for three\nout of the five regions defined for PM10\n. Further study will be\nrequired to refine our estimates of the air pollution\nconcentration and the variances in the estimates. California,\nin particular, merits special attention because many (approxi-\nmately 25%) NHANES-III subjects resided there and\nbecause gradients in air pollution are relatively strong\nbetween the coastal and inland areas. Therefore, different\ninterpolation methods will likely change pollutant concentra-\ntion estimates significantly for a large number of subjects.\nIn the very near future, we will attempt to find associations\nbetween air pollution estimates and respiratory health\noutcomes using the nationwide NHANES-III sample.\nHowever, the wide range of monitor densities across the\ncountry suggests that the accuracy of the interpolation\nestimates will vary greatly. This difference in accuracy may\ninfluence our abilities to draw strong conclusions regarding\nthe effects of air pollution on respiratory health.\n"
