Since publication of this paper, several of the 1998\nWorld Health Organization Toxic Equivalency Factors (TEFs), which were used to calculate the summary statistics we presented, have been changed. In\nthis addendum, we publish new reference statistics using the WHO2006\nTEFs in addition to assessing the effect of these new TEFs on total TEQ\nconcentrations for the general US population. We also examined the effect of the limits of detection (LODs) on the calculated TEQ summary statistics for\nthe top seven contributing congeners and completed a missing data analysis to determine whether our estimates were biased by excluding individuals\nand PCB 126 contributed the most to total TEQ. However, both PCB 156 and 157 were no longer significant contributors, instead being displaced by 1,\n2, 3, 4, 7, 8-HxCDF, and PCB 169. In general, the decrease in TEFs for the mono-ortho-substituted PCBs decreased their contribution to total TEQ\nto approximately equal TEQ17-3\n. The effect of LODs for five of the top seven contributing congeners was negligible;\nhowever, the LODs for 2, 3, 7, 8-TCDD and 1, 2, 3, 7, 8-PeCDD were noticeably higher and may impact TEQ estimates primarily for individuals aged\n20\u00ad29 years. Results from the missing data analysis provide compelling evidence that the summary statistics we reported previously, as well as those\ndescribed here, were not greatly influenced due to censoring data.\nKeywords: biomonitoring, dioxin, LOD, NHANES, serum, TEF, TEQ.\nIntroduction\nThe availability of serum concentration reference values has\nbecome essential as biomonitoring data are being used more\noften to determine if individuals have been exposed to specific\nIn our original paper (Ferriby et al., 2007), we described serum\nreference concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins\n(PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and diox-\nin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) for the general US\npopulation using the 1998 World Health Organization (WHO)\nToxic Equivalency Factors (TEFs) and dioxin-like serum\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). TEFs, initially\ndeveloped in the mid-1980s to facilitate the evaluation of\npotential health risks associated with exposure to complex\nmixtures of PCDD/Fs and PCBs, have been revised multiple\ntimes over the past 20 years based on advances in the state of\nthe science (Haws et al., 2006). Prior to publication of our\noriginal report, a WHO International Programme on Chemical\nSafety (IPCS) expert panel was convened to re-evaluate the\ncontemporaneous TEFs. In July 2006, Van den Berg et al.\npublished revised TEFs for 2, 3, 4, 7, 8-pentachlorodibenzo-\nfuran; 1, 2, 3, 7, 8-pentachlorodibenzofuran; octachlorodiben-\nzo-p-dioxin; octachlorodibenzofuran; and PCBs 81 and 169,\nalong with all mono-ortho substituted PCBs.\nIn accordance with these changes, we reanalyzed the 2001\u00ad\n2002 NHANES serum concentration data for PCDDs,\nPCDFs, and dioxin-like PCBs, and, using the revised\nTEFs, calculated reference statistics for the general\npopulation. In this addendum, we present the updated\nsummary statistics for several demographic subgroups,\nalong with an assessment of the contribution of individual\n1.

For completeness, we evaluated\nthe effect the revised TEFs had on total TEQ serum\nconcentrations, in addition to the effect of the limits of\ndetection (LODs) on the calculated TEQ summary statistics\nfor the top seven congeners. Additionally, we conducted a\nmissing-data analysis to assess whether excluding individuals\nwithout complete congener data impacted our estimates.\nMethods\nData Source\nData collection and laboratory analytical techniques have\nbeen described formerly (NCHS, 2005a; Ferriby et al.,\n2007).

Analytes were measured using\nhigh-resolution gas chromatography and/or isotope-dilution\nhigh-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGS/ID-HRMS) as\ndescribed in the Third National Report on Human Exposure\nto Environmental Chemicals (NCHS, 2005b). All samples\nwith concentrations below the LOD were assumed to have a\nconcentration equivalent to the proxy value assigned by the\nCDC, which is equal to the sample-specific LOD divided by\nthe square root of 2 (CND\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis methods used in this study have\nbeen described previously by Ferriby et al.

Ninety-five percent (95%) confidence inter-\nvals for weighted mean TEQ levels and standard errors for\ngeometric means were calculated using SUDAAN 9.0. The\naverage percent contribution of each congener to the total\nTEQ was calculated by averaging the percent contribution of\nthat congener to the total TEQ across all subjects.\nMissing-Data Analysis\nWe tested the robustness of various estimates using both\nTEFs to assess whether excluding\nindividuals without complete congener profiles biased results\nwe reported previously (Ferriby et al., 2007) as well as the\nsummary statistics presented here. Of the 1693 adult (i.e., 20\nyears and older) NHANES participants for whom serum\ndata were analyzed, 1081 had complete congener profiles,\nindividuals had missing data for all 26 dioxin-like congeners.\nThe latter two groups were excluded from this analysis\nbecause these individuals had missing data (due to laboratory\nQA/QC problems) for the majority of congeners (between\n65% and 100%), making it difficult to accurately impute\nvalues. Using data from individuals with complete congener\nprofiles, the average percent contributions for the TEQPCDD/F\nand\nTEFs. Total TEQ concentrations for the 163\nindividuals missing between one and nine congeners\nwere subsequently imputed using Eq.

Percent difference for each statistic (i.e.,\nmean, 95th percentile) was calculated as (New Stat.\u00c0Old\nStat.)/Old Stat., and averages were calculated for each\nstatistic by TEQ sum (i.e., TEQPCDD/F\n).\nAddendum to Ferriby et al., 2007 Scott et al.\n) summary statisticsa for the 17 PCDD/F congeners (a), nine PCB congeners (b), 17 PCDD/F plus nine PCB\ncongeners (c), and 17 PCDD/F plus the three coplanar PCB congeners (d).\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nScott et al.\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics\nSummary statistics for the four data subsets, TEQPCDD/F\n,\nTEQPCB\n, are presented by gender,\nage, race, and smoking status in Table 1a\u00add. Consistent with\nthe results of our first study (Ferriby et al., 2007), an\nincreasing trend in mean total TEQ was observed with\nincreasing age such that individuals 20\u00ad29 years had average\nlevels that were approximately one-third of those for the\noldest group. As before, higher total TEQ body burdens\nwere also noticed for non-Hispanic Blacks and Whites\nrelative to individuals of Hispanic origin and those categor-\nized as ``Other Race''.\nTable 2a\u00add presents the results for gender stratified by age\nand smoking status, and for smoking status stratified by age.\nEven after adjusting for gender and smoking status, the\nincreasing trend with age was very evident, again suggesting\nage as a dominant predictor of body burden. However, as\nobserved in our previous study (Ferriby et al., 2007), both\nsmoking status and gender influenced concentrations in the\noldest individuals. Indeed, whereas non-smokers 60 years\nand older had three times the concentration of non-smokers\nwere smokers had only twice the body burden as smokers\n20\u00ad29 years old. Collectively, these results confirm the\nexistence of a complex interaction between age, smoking\nstatus, gender, and total TEQ serum levels.\nPercent Contribution to Total TEQ\nThe percent contribution of the four main classes of\ncongeners, PCDDs, PCDFs, coplanar PCBs, and mono-\northo PCBs, to the total TEQ17-9\n5%, respectively. Similar to results in our previous study\nstill contributed the most to total TEQ, accounting for 68%\nand 157 were no longer significant contributors, instead being\naccounted for another 6% of the total TEQ (Figure 1).\nOverall, these results demonstrate that the effects the\nTEFs had on total body burden are consistent\nwith the change in scale of the TEF approach. For example,\nthe decrease in TEFs for the mono-ortho-substituted PCBs\nhas appreciably decreased their contribution to total TEQ\nfrom 28% to 5%, whereas the increase in the TEF for PCB\n169 amplified the contribution of this congener from 0.8% to\n3%. The changes in contribution observed with WHO2006\nTEFs are also apparent when comparing results presented in\nTable 1c and d in our original paper (Ferriby et al., 2007)\nwith those in Table 1c and d of this report. Using WHO2006\nwas approximately equal to TEQ17-3\n, which\nwas further evidenced by the finding that, on average, mean\nhigher than mean total TEQPCDD/F\n, respectively. This is in\ncontrast to the findings presented in our previous publication\nwhere we reported that mean total TEQ17-9\nthan mean total TEQPCDD/F\nTEQs resulting from changes to the TEFs were also observed\nwithin groups; however, these differences were more evident\nin groups with higher serum levels than in groups with lower\nlevels. For example, serum TEQ17-9\nconcentrations for\nindividuals 60 years and older were reduced from 50.9 to\nImpact of LODs on Reference Values\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, five of the top seven congeners, 1,\nsamples with concentrations above the LOD, thus reducing\nthe impact these congeners' detection limits had on the total\ncalculated TEQ. Additionally, these five congeners also had\nlow average LODs (Figure 2), thereby further minimizing the\nimpact of the LOD for these congeners on the total TEQ. In\nlow percentages of samples, 13% and 35%, respectively, with\nconcentrations above the LOD. Because these congeners\ncontributed appreciably to total TEQ and their average\nLODs were higher than the other congeners (2.7 and 2.8 pg/g\nTable 1.

Although it is doubtful\nthat these LODs would result in considerable overestimation\nlevels for individuals 20\u00ad29 years old, the\napplication of the descriptive statistics presented here for\ninterpreting biomonitoring results of younger individuals\nshould be conducted with discretion and these limitations\nacknowledged.\nTable 2.

Of these 449 participants,\nPCDD/Fs and 9 PCBs) and 305 individuals had missing data\nfor all 17 PCDD/Fs but had serum data for the nine PCBs.\nSeparately, a total of 163 individuals had missing data for\none or more congeners, with the number of congeners\nmissing ranging from one to nine. Specifically, there were 74\nindividuals missing data for one congener, 36 missing data\nfor two, 14 missing data for three, 6 missing data for four, 11\nmissing data for five, 11 missing data for six, 5 missing data\nfor seven, 3 missing data for eight, and 3 individuals missing\ndata for nine congeners.\nWhen data were reanalyzed to include the 163 individuals\nwho had data missing for between one and nine congeners\n(n \u00bc 1244), the average percent difference in the mean\nand 95th percentile TEQPCDD/F\n, the average percent difference in mean and 95th percentile\nTEFs),\nTEFs),\nrespectively (Figure 3b).\nEvaluation of differences in estimates for specific sub-\ngroups revealed that only 95th percentile values were\nnoticeably impacted by including the 163 participants with\nimputed concentrations.

Indeed, in\nunderestimating 95th percentile concentrations, we have, to\nsome extent, provided reasonably conservative reference\nvalues for assessing exposure to the dioxin-like compounds.\nDiscussion\nOver the past several decades, biomonitoring has been\nincreasingly utilized by a variety of industrial and manufac-\nturing businesses, as well as governmental agencies, to assist\nin evaluating the potential exposure of particular populations\nto a wide range of chemicals. The benefits of biomonitoring,\nnonetheless, are severely limited if data cannot be interpreted.\nCertainly, interpretation of biomonitoring data and use of\nthese data as an exposure-assessment tool involve under-\nstanding how the concentration of a particular chemical in an\nexposed individual compares with its concentration in\nthe general population (NRC, 2006). To that extent, the\ndescriptive statistics provided by our analyses of\nthe NHANES data will prove useful when evaluating the\nPCDD/F and PCB serum concentrations of individuals or\npopulations potentially exposed to these compounds. Indeed,\nthe National Research Council's Committee on Human\nBiomonitoring for Environmental Toxicants recently re-\nported that data may be interpreted by a descriptive\napproach in which a statistical review of the data is presented\nto relate the results of a study population with those of a\ncomparable or reference population (NRC, 2006). Following\nthis paradigm, we believe we have adequately described the\nNHANES PCDD/F and dioxin-like PCB serum data for the\npurposes outlined by the NRC. While the importance of\npresenting biomonitoring results for PCDD/Fs and dioxin-\nlike PCBs is apparent, it is imperative to note that the results\npresented here are not intended for use in interpreting health\nrisks or the potential health status of groups or individuals\nexposed to these chemicals.\ns\nF\nE\nT\nAverage % Difference\nAverage Absolute Difference\n(ppt)\nPercent Absolute\ns\nF\nE\nT\ns\nF\nE\nT\nAverage % Difference\nAverage Absolute Difference\n(ppt)\nPercent Absolute\nFigure 3.
