These al-Azhar\ngraduates were heavily influenced by the earlier version of\nthe Salafiyyah1 reform ideology of Jamaldin Afghani and his\ndisciple, Muhammad Abduh. This version of Salafiyyah\nthoughts, propagated among others, the ideal of pan-\nIslamism, and the Afghani-Abduh reform doctrine that\nemphasizes the importance of reviving the Muslim ummah\nglobally through its progressive idea of reopening the gate of\nijtihad, relinquishing innovation (bid'a) and reconciling ele-\nments of modernity into the Islamic culture of the people\n(Noor, 2004). This earlier version of Salafiyyah, unlike the\ncurrent conservative Gulf or Saudi-style Salafiyyah, was\nknown for its progressive and modern ideas.

Due to its contro-\nversial nature, the Kaum Muda was also labeled as the\nDespite the continuous dominance of the traditionalists in\nshaping the state version of Islam in many states in Malaysia,\nin Perlis, a state located in the northern part of Malaysia,\nhowever, the Kaum Muda managed to gain political patron-\nage from the rulers of the state (Othman & Rahmat, 1996).\nThe state adamantly declared its inclination toward the\nreform ideas, and proudly established its own approach\ntoward understanding Islam, which has been known as the\n\"Sunnah\" way of Islam or, in some cases, coined as \"Islah\"\n(Shukor Mat, 2000). It was known for its call for ijtihad by\nreferring directly to the Qur'an and Sunnah, that is, without\nmaking any attachment to any specific madhhab (legalistic\nschool of thought). Consequently, the state religious enact-\nments and rulings were not bound to any madhhab, in con-\ntrast to the other states in Malaysia, which adhered to the\nShafii madhhab.2\nThis has been among the most apparent controversial\nprinciple that has caused continuous resentment between the\nKaum Muda of Perlis with mainstream traditionalists from\nthe other states in Malaysia, which religiously adhere to the\nidea of the necessity for Muslims in Malaysia to affiliate\nthemselves to a specific madhhab, which, in the case of the\nMalay Archipelago, is the Shafii madhhab. According to\nmainstream traditionalists, any call to liberate oneself from\nthe madhhab, or any attempt to abolish the affiliation or\nattachment of Muslims to a specific madhhab, is similar to\nbelittling the founder members of those different madhhabs,\nand some perceive it as an act of insolence (A. R. Abdullah,\nof the \"Kaum Muda version of Salafism,\"3 which is akin to\nMuhammadiyah in Perlis, is also known until today as the\n\"Sunnah Perlis.\" They sometimes refer to themselves as the\n\"golongan sunnah\" (Sunnah Group) as an antithesis of the\n\"golongan madhhabi\" (madhhabic group) of the mainstream\n(M. S. Md Ismail, personal communication, August 25,\nInterestingly, the Sunnah Perlis scholars and activists\nheavily rejected the labeling of Wahabi given to them or any\nassociation with the Wahabi movement in Saudi Arabia.\nThey always prefer to be known as \"Ahli Sunnah wal\njamaah\" or \"Sunnah\" or \"Islah\" rather than Wahabi (Othman\ninsist in using the \"Salafi\" label to the \"Sunnah Perlis\"\nthoughts and reform agenda due to its reform nature (islah\nand tajdid) and also its call for the pure version of Islam by\nreferring directly to the al-Quran and Sunnah as well as by\nsuperceding the madhhabic interpretation (p. 75). In sum, to\nunderstand the position of Sunnah Perlis, in contrast to the\nmainstream Islamic discourse in Malaysia, one could com-\npare it with the relation between Muhammadiyah and Persis\nin Indonesia against the Nahdatul Ulama.\nIt was widely discussed that the dominating influence of\nthe \"Sunnah\" in the state of Perlis was due to the state author-\nity's patronage of the reform agenda. An early hypothesis\nindicates that it was the multifactors that led to the situation,\namong them was the Rulers' patronage of the \"Sunnah\"\nreformists' agenda, the Rulers' power represented by Majlis\nAgama Perlis (religious authority) which is directly under\nthe Rulers' influence, the state administration represented by\nthe ruling government predominantly occupied by the\n\"Sunnah\" followers and activists, and the relentless efforts\nby \"Sunnah\" preachers throughout mosques, schools, and\nof impact by these factors differs from one time to another.\nThis article will try to look at the historical development\nof the \"Sunnah Perlis\" discourse as another earlier version of\nSalafism and scrutinize its influence in the state of Perlis. In\nachieving this, it will employ a historical method in under-\nstanding the important milestones in the historical account of\nthe Sunnah reform agenda in Perlis and its development in\nthe different periods hitherto through literatures, reports,\ninterviews, and focus group discussions. The term \"Sunnah\"\nwill be used in this article intertwined with \"Islah\" as widely\nused by other researchers, to maintain the level of objectivity\nby calling the idea according to what the proponents call it.\n\"Sunnah\" in Perlis: Historical\nBackground and Development\nPerlis is the smallest state in Malaysia situated at the north-\nern part of the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The capital\nof Perlis is Kangar while its royal capital is Arau, where the\nRulers of Perlis reside. It is bordered by the state of Kedah to\nthe south and Thailand to the north, and was initially part of\nKedah under the Siamese rule for many centuries. However,\nin 1842, the Siamese separated Perlis from Kedah and it\nbecame a principality, a vassal to Bangkok. On May 20,\n1843, the Siamese made Sayyid Hussain Jamalullail, a\ndescendent of Hadhrami Arab Sayyid, who was also the\nmaternal son of the Sultan of Kedah, the first \"Raja\" of Perlis\n(Buyong, 1981, pp. 4-8). This made Perlis a sovereign state.\nHis descendents still rule Perlis, but as Rajas, instead of\nSultans due to their non-Malay origin.\nThe \"Sunnah\" in Perlis, a 20th-century phenomenon, is\npart of the global \"Islah\" or reform movement of the pan-\nIslamic agenda of Afghani\u00adAbduh in Egypt. The develop-\nment of the \"Sunnah\" in Perlis throughout the two centuries\n(20th and 21st) can be divided into six phases: the establish-\nment, stagnation, re-enhancement, crisis, recovery-revival,\nand the golden periods. The categorization of the periods is\nmostly based on Abdul Rahman Abdullah's chapter \"Sejarah\nIslah di Perlis\" (the History of Islah in Perlis) in his book,\n\"Aliran Dakwah di Malaysia, Satu Titik Pertemuan\" (Dakwah\nMalik and Mat 3\nTrends in Malaysia: A Meeting Point) (see A. R. Abdullah,\ninserted into this article, the \"Golden Period\" of the \"Sunnah,\"\nwhich occurred during the term of Shahidan Kassim as the\nMenteri Besar together with his \"Sunnah\" acquaintance and\nreference, Dr. Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin as the Mufti of the\nState of Perlis. The word \"golden\" was not elaborated by\nAbdul Rahman, though he did mention it briefly when talking\nabout the final stage of the recovery-revival period. Thus, he\nis not really being just to the historical facts.\nThere are a few theories on who was first responsible for\nbringing the \"Sunnah\" reform idea to Perlis. However,\naccording to many researchers, it was Lebai Kechik who\nargues that this wide-spread theory must have been taken\nfrom personal notes called \"Agama dan Zakat di Perlis,\"\nwidely quoted by researchers, which belongs to Dato' Wan\nAhmad b. Wan Daud, a prominent \"Sunnah\" figure in Perlis\ntrace the date of Lebai Kechik's arrival in Malaya, which was\nduring the 1930s, has refuted this theory. According to\nShukor Mat, the first attempt to bring the \"Sunnah\" idea was\nby Syeikh Hassan Sarbani, known by his real name as Syeikh\nHassan b. Ahmad, who came to Perlis from Surabaya in\n1916. However, he was chased away by Raja Alwi due to the\ncontroversial nature of his thoughts, and he later migrated to\nJohore and Pulau Pinang accordingly. Despite the failure of\nhis first attempt in Perlis, he made his return to the state in\n1926 and managed to get full support from a local religious\nscholar, Haji Abdul Ghani b. Dato' Sakti, and a well-known\ncommunity leader, Tuan Haji Abdullah b. Ahmad.\nWan Ahmad (n.d), in his account on the emergence of the\n\"Sunnah\" idea in Perlis, suggests that a scholar from\nHadramawt, Yemen, Syed Ibrahim also made his contribu-\ntion in spreading the reform idea in Perlis. However, accord-\ning to historical records, it was Haji Ahmad bin Muhammad,\nalso known as Haji Ahmad Hakim, who was the first person\nresponsible to propose a radical change to the conventional\npractice of zakat collection and distribution in Perlis as part\nof the reform proposal to Raja Alwi in 1927 (A. R. Abdullah,\n2007). This incident was the turning point that led to the\npositive attitude of the palace toward the reform ideas in reli-\ngious matters, despite waves of rejection from the tradition-\nalist local scholars. It also opened a new chapter in the\nsupport of the palace to the struggle of the reform idea later\nknown as the \"Sunnah\" or the \"Ahlu Sunnah wal-Jamaah\"\nmethod.\nHaji Ahmad Hakim was supported by two comrades: a\npolitical figure, Wan Ahmad bin Wan Daud, and a local\nscholar, Syeikh Ahmad bin Mohd Hashim, to spread the\nreform idea (islah) in Perlis (A. R. Abdullah, 1997). Among\nthe three, Wan Ahmad was known for his proactive role in\npromoting the \"Sunnah\" or \"Islah\" among the authority, thus\ngetting the support from the palace. He was reported to have\nestablished communication and relation with the Kaum\nMuda icon, Syed Syeikh al-Hadi, in Penang and succeeded\nin getting Abdul Wahab Abdullah, the assistant editor of\n\"Saudara\" magazine which belonged to al-Hadi to Penang.\nIn disseminating its ideas, Kaum Muda managed to vary its\napproach. It published its literature and was also aggres-\nsively involved in publishing its own periodical newspa-\nper--akin to its ideologue in Egypt. Saudara, Pengasuh,\n\"al-Urwat al-Wuthqa,\" al-Ikhwan, al-Imam, and al-Munir\nare among the periodicals produced by these reformists\nWahab had a significant role in spreading the Kaum Muda\nideas in Perlis.\nWan Ahmad and his two comrades are known in the Perlis\nSunnah history as \"Tiga Mat\" (the three Mats;A. R.Abdullah,\ninfluenced by the writings of Hassan Bandung from\nPersatuan Islam (PERSIS), one of the reform movements of\nthat period in Indonesia. Apart from the \"Tiga Mat,\" another\nnoteworthy scholar who contributed toward establishing the\n\"Sunnah\" idea in Perlis was Abu Bakar al-Ashaari, an Azhar\nmovement \"Jam'iyat al-Malayuwiyah\" (Malay Association),\nwhich consists of students from Malaya and Indonesia in\nEgypt along with the prominent Indonesian reformist leader,\nAbdul Kahar Muzakkir.Akin to the other reformists of Kaum\nMuda during his time, al-Ashaari also contributed signifi-\ncantly to the \"Saudara\" magazine while teaching in Pulau\nPinang. The \"Tiga Mat\" invited al-Ashaari to Perlis together\nwith Abdul Wahab. He began his career in Perlis as a teacher\nat the Alawiyah madrasah but was later given a more sub-\nstantive role as the Imam of the Alawi mosque in Kangar (A.\nIt was the collective effort of the \"Tiga Mat,\" Abdul\nWahab and al-Ashaari, that managed to place a foundational\npillar to the teaching of the \"Sunnah\" or \"Islah\" in Perlis in\nwhat is coined by Abdul Rahman as the \"Establishment\n\"establishment period\" that the Alawiyah Madrasah and the\nAlwi mosque became the propagation bastion of the reform-\nists, together with their writings, especially those of Abu\nBakar al-Ashaari. Among the factors that paved the wave for\nthe \"Sunnah\" reform idea to spread throughout Perlis, espe-\ncially in Kangar and Arau, was the full support they received\nfrom the religious authority and the palace. Raja Syed Alwi,\nthe king of Perlis, was known for his open support for the\nreform ideas and the influence of the \"Tiga Mat.\"\nThe honeymoon of the Sunnah reformists did not last long;\nthe Japanese Occupation ended the privileges enjoyed by\nthem. They appointed Syed Hamzah, brother of Raja Alwi,\n4 SAGE Open\nas the new ruler on February 2, 1943. Syed Hamzah was\nknown for his disagreement with the former king, SyedAlwi,\nand his aides, the Sunnah reformists. He began to exclude all\nthose who were associated with the former ruler and kept\nthem away from any administrative post in the state. Most of\nthe Sunnah reformists, apart from Syeikh Ahmad, went\nthrough a tough time and were pressured to abandon their\nreformation agenda during the occupation period. Syed\nHamzah also appointed those without inclination toward the\n\"Sunnah\" reform ideas to lead the religious authority admin-\nistration and consistently expressed his resentment toward\nthe \"Sunnah\" reform idea, which he called as \"deviant teach-\nAn interesting fact to ponder regarding this period relates\nto the situation of the other Kaum Muda or pro-Kaum Muda\nactivists outside Perlis. The Japanese organized the \"Pan-\nMalayan Religious Council\" which aimed to put Muslim\nscholars, mainly from the religious authority (dominated by\nthe traditionalists or Kaum Tua) in the Malay states under its\npatronage. Most of them were used by the Japanese to spread\nJapanese propaganda at the mosques to the Muslim commu-\nnity throughout preindependent Malaya (Ahmad, 2003).\nThe Japanese managed to get the support of the Muslim\nscholars by using \"anti-colonial\" discourse and promised\nthem \"independence\" from Western colonization. The Kaum\nMuda scholars outside Perlis, in the meantime, became\nstaunch supporters of the Japanese through their political\nideas. Although they were not used by the Japanese to be part\nof religious propaganda machine like the Kaum Tua, the\nKaum Muda scholars, thinkers, and political activists formed\nthe Kesatuan Melayu Muda (KMM) to express their anti-\nBritish propaganda and propagate the idea of a bigger Malay\nstate comprising Malaya and Indonesia, or what was then\nUnfortunately, unlike the other Kaum Muda scholars who\nwere not affected by Japanese policies, the Sunnah scholars\nwere experiencing an eclipse for an internal palace-political\npower struggle in Perlis.\nThe predicament experienced by the \"Sunnah\" reformists,\nhowever, ended with the end of the Japanese occupation. The\nBritish colonialists who came back to Malaya after the defeat\nof the Japanese in the Second World War appointed Syed\nPutra as the new king of Perlis on December 4, 1945. Syed\nPutra took a different approach toward the Sunnah reform\nidea. His openness and positive attitude toward the Sunnah\nreformists allowed them to make a comeback to finish their\nunfinished business in the state. Furthermore, the Sunnah\nreform agenda was fully supported by the ruling party\n`United Malays National Organization'(UMNO) as the lead-\ning and the most prevailing Malay party after the Japanese\noccupation and the rejection of the Malays of the \"Malayan\nUnion\" proposal by the British to unify all the Malay states\nunder a single government to simplify administration (K.\nattempt to abolish the monarchy, thus endangering Malay\ndominance of their motherland.\nThe golden opportunity given to the Sunnah reformists\nduring this period was capitalized by \"Tiga Mat\" and its\nacquaintances to regroup and pursue its reform agenda more\naggressively. They managed to strengthen the Sunnah reform\nagenda by employing only those with Sunnah tendency to\npositions in the state religious authority offices: Imams for\nthe mosques and teachers in the madrasahs throughout\nPerlis. The religious authority also emphasized the enforce-\nment and monitoring issues to ensure the Sunnah practice\nwas substantively installed and implemented by the people\nof Perlis and all the religious institutions within the state of\nPerlis (M. S. Md Ismail, personal communication, August\nhad also appointed the religious inspectors to monitor reli-\ngious activities conducted by the people (State of Perlis,\nApart from the authority's enforcement and support given\nby the palace, education and propagation also played an\nessential role in spreading the Sunnah reform idea in the state\nof Perlis. At this stage, considerable effort in propagating the\nSunnah idea is attributed to Abu Bakar al-Ashaari, who was\nbrought back by Haji Ahmad Hakim after his exile outside\nPerlis during the Japanese occupation. He was appointed ini-\ntially as Imam of Masjid Alwi (Alwi mosque), which was\npivotal to the proliferation of the Sunnah reform idea in\nKangar and Perlis. Being a prolific writer, and considered as\nthe most learned scholar in Perlis, he became the reference of\nthe Sunnah idea by both the authority and the people of Perlis\n(Roff, 1975). His books have been considered as references\nfor the Sunnah, and used by many to understand the \"Sunnah\"\nideals.4 Despite the enormous influence of his books to the\npeople of Perlis, many of which, especially his \"Ibadat\nRasulullah,\" were being prohibited and banned in the other\nstates due to its nonconventional madhhabic approach and\ncontroversial fatwas in contradiction with the mainstream\nShafii madhhab throughout Persekutuan Tanah Melayu then\nAt this stage, Perlis was already known for its \"Sunnah\"\ninclination and its controversial scholars. Abu Bakar al-\nAshaari, one of those scholars, was invited to many Malay\nstates by the religious authority, muftis and scholars to engage\nin debate on many of his fatwa, mainly from his \"Ibadat\nAbu Bakar refused the invitation as he believed the result\nwould be fruitless. He argues that everybody is entitled to his\nown ijtihad (reasoning) because his fatwas mainly deal with\nelementary issues and not those of the fundamentals of Islam\n(Din, 1976). Surprisingly, some of his controversial fatwas\nbecame popular and acceptable in the later period, such as\nhis fatwa on the permissibility of organ (he was talking about\neyes) donation from a dead person to a living person (A. R.\nMalik and Mat 5\nment of maslahah (public interest) that has always been pro-\ntected and prioritized in Islamic teachings as mercy to\nhumankind. Similarly, his fatwa on the permissibility for\nMuslims to pay zakat (alms) with money instead of crops\nand fruits was heavily refuted and led him to be labeled as a\nheretic, yet it is now widely accepted and practiced by\nMuslims in Malaysia (A. R. Abdullah, 2007).\nHaving Abu Bakr al-Ashaari as the icon of the \"Sunnah\" in\nPerlis brought both fortune and calamity to the reform\nagenda. As mentioned earlier, most of the Sunnah reformists\nin Perlis were UMNO supporters. Since the preindependent\nyears until the postindependent period, the \"Sunnah\" reform\nagenda has been wholeheartedly propagated and defended\nby those who are within or related to UMNO unlike in the\nother states in Malaya. The establishment of the Pan-\nMalaysian Islamic Party (PAS; as the offshoot of the first\nIslamic party in Malaya Hizbul Muslimun) in 1955 became a\nturning point of the status quo. Initially, PAS had managed to\nattract most of the scholars from both the Kaum Muda influ-\nenced intellectuals and the Kaum Tua traditionalist scholars\nfrom throughout Malaya. PAS presented itself as different\nfrom UMNO through its goal to establish an Islamic State\nbased on an Islamic ideology instead of a secular-nationalis-\ntic one as propagated by UMNO.\nFurthermore, in 1956, Dr. Burhanuddin al-Helmy, the\nprominent Kaum Muda and reform intellect, was appointed\nas PAS new president due to the leadership crisis within the\nparty (Noor, 2004). Dr. Burhanuddin, during his presidency,\nmade the party more dynamic, thus attracting the other Kaum\nMuda and reform-minded scholars. Abu Bakar al-Ashaari\nwas among those who was convinced by Dr. Burhanuddin. A\nyear after Burhanuddin became the president of PAS, Abu\nBakar left UMNO for PAS, and eventually became Ketua\nDewan Ulama (Leader of Scholars Council) of PAS in Perlis.\nHis migration to PAS led to division among the Sunnah sup-\nporters in Perlis (A. R. Abdullah, 2007). Abu Bakar, since\nthen, has not been known for his Sunnah ideal, and has been\naccused of being apologetic of his position to compromise\nwith the other Kaum Tua traditionalists within PAS in Perlis\n(M. S. Md Ismail, personal communication, August 25,\nUnlike Abu Bakar, most of the Sunnah leaders and activ-\nists in Perlis have remained loyal to UMNO, thus enjoying\nadministrative and political status in the state administration\n(Othman & Rahmat, 1996). Haji Ahmad Hakim continued\nhis job as the Yang Dipertua Majlis Agama Islam and Adat\nIstiadat Melayu Perlis (the head of Religious Council and\nMalay Culture and Heritage of the state of Perlis), while both\nWan Ahmad and Syeikh Ahmad contested for UMNO in the\n1959 General Election in Malaya. Both won the seats as\nassemblymen in the state assembly. Following their victory,\nWan Ahmad was appointed as the assembly hall speaker\nwhile Syeikh Ahmad became the first elected Menteri Besar\n(Chief Minister) of Perlis. Despite the special treatment\ngiven to the Sunnah propagation in Perlis, however, not\nmuch essential changes were made during the tenure of\nSyeikh Ahmad as the Menteri Besar.\nThe most significant milestone of the Sunnah Perlis\noccurred before the period of Syeikh Ahmad's predecessor\nas the Menteri Besar, Dato Laksamana Haji Mohd Razali.\nin the state constitution (Undang-Undang Tubuh Kerajaan\nPerlis) with the endorsement of various parties involved\n(which includes the Tiga Mat, the Menteri Besar, and the\nKing's representative). Article 17 of the state constitution\nstates clearly that \"the Ruler of Perlis must be a Muslim man\nwho adheres to the Ahli Sunnah Wal Jamaah thoughts.\"\nWhile inArticle 3:1, it states that any regent to the throne and\nthe council of the regent must \"adhere to the teachings of\nAhli Sunnah Wal Jamaah.\" Concurrently, Article 27 of the\nstate constitution also states that \"the heir of the throne must\nalso adhere to Ahli Sunnah Wal Jamaah\" (Undang-Undang\nTubuh Kerajaan Perlis (Perlis State Constitution),\nsince as the cornerstone and the triumph of the struggle of the\n\"Sunnah\" ideology in Perlis.\nDuring the period of Syeikh Ahmad as Menteri Besar,\nmore substantive achievements to strengthen the domination\nof the \"Sunnah\" in Perlis were achieved. In 1963, as an\nexample, the Islamic Administrative Laws (Undang-Undang\nPentadbiran Agama Islam) indicate in Article 4 that \"The\nMajlis (Religious Council of the state) in issuing a Fatwa\nand the Shari'ah (Fatwa) Committee when giving its opin-\nion under sub-section (2) shall follow al-Quran and/or\nSunnah.\" Consequently, in 1964, an amendment was made to\nthe Article 5(1) of the Perlis state constitution (Undang-\nUndang Tubuh Kerajaan Perlis) stating, \"The official reli-\ngion of the state of Perlis is Islam according to the teaching\nof Ahli Sunnah Wal-Jamaah as being practiced in the state.\"\nSimilarly, in the same year, a significant amendment was\ndone to the state Islamic Administrative Laws (Undang-\nUndang Pentadbiran Agama Islam), in Article 2, para. 7 (4),\nstating that any fatwa or decision by the Shari'ah council of\nthe state that follows al-Quran and Sunnah must not contra-\ndict with the public interest. While in case of any contradic-\ntions, the decision must be presented to the King who will\ndecide according to the convention practiced in Perlis.\nDespite the law enactments, the late 1960s and early\n1970s became witness to the demise of many \"Sunnah\"\nicons in Perlis. This situation left the \"Sunnah\" reform\nagenda in a relatively state of loss. Haji Ahmad Hakim died\nas Wan Ahmad. The last \"Mat\" of the \"Tiga Mat\" (three\nMats), Syeikh Ahmad died years later, in 1980, however,\nwithout making any significant contribution in his final years\n6 SAGE Open\nFurthermore, in 1967, the Government of Malaysia, through\nthe Ministry of Education, started to gain control of some\nmadrasahs in Malaysia, including the Madrasah Alawiyah in\nPerlis, once the bastion of the \"Sunnah\" activists, to educate\nthe younger generation of scholars. After the takeover,\nMadrasah Alawiyah no longer used the \"Sunnah\" curricu-\nlum they were once proud of, but instead had to resort to the\nstandardized Ministry of Education schools' religious sylla-\nbus, which is mainly based on the Shafi'i madhhab (A. R.\nIn addition, the \"Sunnah\" reform agenda in Perlis began to\ndeteriorate when the appointment to the main positions of reli-\ngious authority was made by the federal government, and no\nlonger under the state's jurisdiction. Most of those who were\ndeployed to Perlis from outside the state were not really\nfriendly to the \"Sunnah\" approach, and in some cases appeared\nas the opponents to the state religious ideology such as Salleh\nOthman who was appointed as the Yang Dipertua Majlis\nAgama Islam Perlis (Head of Higher Islamic Council of the\nstate of Perlis) on January 1, 1971, Mohd Said Pilus who suc-\nceeded him, and finally, Ghazali Haji Ismail who came after\nMohd Said in 1976. The \"Sunnah\" followers in Perlis saw the\naforementioned three Yang Dipertuas as persons who had\nbeen sent by the federal authority to change the \"Sunnah\"\nreform agenda in Perlis and replace it with the mainstream\n201). This suspicion was strengthened when during those\nyears, the federal Islamic authority aggressively banned litera-\ntures relating to the \"Sunnah\" such as the writings of Hasan\nBandung, Abu Bakar al-Ashaari, and others (M. S.

Syeikh Noor, of Hadramawt\norigin who was a religious teacher and a judge in the High\nCourt of Makkah for 8 years before he came to Malaysia. He\nmoved to Perlis with the purpose to be part of the \"Sunnah\"\nreform activists in the state during the 1950s (A. R.

However, the\ndemise of the \"Sunnah\" icons prompted him to play his role\nas a reference for \"Sunnah\" thoughts, which were widely\naccepted by the \"Sunnah\" followers (A. R.

S. Md Ismail, personal communication, August 25,\n2014). Al-Islah also managed to attract a former Mufti of\nPerlis, Abdul Rahman Haji Ismail, who was then a teacher at\nMadrasah Alawiyah Arau.

Due to the role played by the King\ntoward the \"Sunnah\" enforcement, al-Islah maintained its\nsupport to the palace and valued its position in enhancing the\nsurvival of \"Sunnah\" in the state.

This will be discussed in the subsequent paragraphs\non the \"Golden Years of `Sunnah' Perlis.\"\nThe arrival of Saudi-Salafism to Perlis.The early arrival of\nSaudi-Salafism to Perlis took place during the period of\nof the Middle Eastern oil boom of the 1970s and the ensuing\nrise of the political clout of the Organization of Petroleum\nExporting Countries (OPEC), Saudi petrodollars started\npouring into many Muslim countries worldwide through the\nSaudi embassies for the propagation of Islam and the spread\nof the Saudi-Salafi indoctrination process. It is historically\nan undeniable fact that Malaysia became a major recipient of\noil-related aid distributed under the aegis of the Jeddah-\nbased Islamic Development Bank (IDB; Idris, 2006; Yaakop\nLikewise, in many countries where Saudi embassies were\nestablished, an Islamic Cultural Council (al-Mustashar al-\nthaqafi) was also set up, designed specifically for the pur-\npose of Islamic propagation. In addition, it also employed\nlocal graduates from Saudi universities to become its official\npreachers in spreading the teachings of Islam. Among the\nwell-known preachers employed by the Saudi Arabian\nEmbassy Cultural Council in Malaysia at that time were\nAbdullah Yassin, Zainal Abidin, Hussin Yee, and Sulaiman\nNordin (A.

It was through this official com-\nmunication that the state managed to get its students to secure\nscholarships to study in Saudi Arabian universities, mainly at\nthe Islamic University of Madinah. It was through this rela-\ntion too that many Saudi preachers were given the opportu-\nnity to deliver their lessons and talks in Perlis.\nHowever, according to Md Sadik, his personal relation\nIslamic councillor of the Saudi Arabian Cultural Office in\nJalan U-Thant, Dr. Abdul Rahman Ghannam, who was\ninvited on a monthly basis to Perlis to deliver talks organized\nby al-Islah (M.

In\nfact, some of the younger Saudi-Salafi preachers among the\ngraduates of Saudi Arabian universities after the year 2000\nperceived that Sunnah Perlis did not embrace the Saudi-\nSalafism doctrine or what they coined as \"manhaj Salafi\"\n(Salafi method). As a result, most of these preachers estab-\nlished their own influence different from the mainstream\nSunnah Perlis as propagated by the state religious authority\n(M. S. Md Ismail, personal communication, August 25,\nThe Golden Period (\"Sunnah\" Perlis Under\nShahidan Kasim)\nAccording to many veterans of \"Sunnah\" in Perlis, as quoted\nby Md Sadik Md Ismail, the former Pengarah Majlis Agama\nIslam Perlis (Director of Islamic Council of the state of\nintensive and lively period of the \"Sunnah\" in Perlis since\nthe 1950s was during the tenure of Datuk Seri Dr. Shahidan\nKassim as the Menteri Besar, specifically when he was close\nfriends with Dr. Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin, an academic from\nUniversiti Sains Malaysia (USM) or Malaysia Science\nUniversity. The pinnacle of the golden period was seen by\nmany as during Mohd Asri's period in office as the Mufti of\nthe state of Perlis. The Ruler of Perlis, King Syed Sirajudin,\n8 SAGE Open\nwith the recommendation from Shahidan on November 1,\n2006, appointed Mohd Asri as the state Mufti. It was since\nthen that the Shahidan-Mohd Asri symbiosis managed to put\nthe \"Sunnah\" back as the jewel of the Perlis state crown,\nonce again becoming the trademark of the state itself.\nIn adding more substantive \"Sunnah\" legacy to the state,\nShahidan went a step further by changing the name of the\nstate from Perlis \"Indera Kayangan\" (which literally means:\nheavenly sense) to Perlis \"Darul Sunnah\" (Abode of the\nSunnah; Utusan Malaysia, 2006). However, the name \"Darul\nSunnah\" was never officially promulgated to be the official\nname for Perlis until today. Similarly, in defending the\n\"Sunnah\" of Perlis, Shahidan often appeared in the media\ntalking about \"Sunnah,\" Islah, and the need to return to the\ntrue practice of Islam as according to al-Quran and Sunnah\nof Prophet Muhammad (S.

Md Ismail,\nfor his generosity and his habit of distributing donations to\nall those who attended events and programs organized where\nhe himself was present (M. A. Zainul Abidin, personal com-\nmunication, July 29, 2014). In terms of the continuity of edu-\ncation for the people of Perlis on the \"Sunnah,\" Shahidan\nestablished \"Institut Sunnah Negeri Perlis\" (Perlis Sunnah\nInstitute) with the aim to introduce the true teachings of\nIslam according to the \"Sunnah\" to all Perlis residents, both\nMuslims and non-Muslims. Associate Professor Zulkifli\nAbidin, a former academic, was given the responsibility to\nlead the institute (\"Pusat Sunnah di Nusantara,\" 2007).\nThere are few factors that made the Shahidan-Mohd Asri\nperiod comparatively unique from the other periods dis-\ncussed. The development of the \"Sunnah\" in Perlis at this\ntime was supported by young people, not only in Perlis but\nalso outside the state. The media coverage of sensational\nnews and events too had its impact in getting information\nabout the \"Sunnah\" known to people throughout Malaysia.\nThe media, when referring to religious matters, often quoted\nstatements made by both Shahidan and Mohd Asri. This gave\nthem the limelight; thus, whatever issues regarding the\n\"Sunnah\" they were trying to promote were publicized\nthrough the media. Furthermore, the social media revolution\nin mid-2000, especially the blogs, web forums, and advance\nversion of email groups, had made discussions on religious\nissues a public matter (Malik, 2015). The \"Sunnah\" issue\nwas also becoming a hot topic of discussion, especially with\nthe emergence of the Global Salafism influence through the\nInternet.\nIn addition, the Global Salafism influence that was widely\nspread through the Internet since the Internet revolution\nbefore the beginning of the new millennia had contributed\nsignificantly in giving more information on all aspects of\nvarious issues to the younger generation (Malik, 2013).\nNotable websites famously propagated Salafism during this\nperiod, contributing to the spread of Salafi teachings directly\nand indirectly to college students, young middle-class gradu-\nates as well as in the educated circles. Among those websites\nwere al-Ahkam.net, al-qayyim.net, ehadith.info, alFikrah.\nnet, al-firdaus.com, al-nidaa.com, al-wahidah.com,\nDarulkautsar.com, and Indonesian salafy.or.id, apart from\nthe personal website of the mufti of Perlis himself, \"drmaza.\nimately 1.5 million viewers (A.

This led some conventional Salafists\nto strongly accept the Perlis \"Sunnah\" as part of Salafism\nbut with caution and exceptions. Another factor was the fre-\nquent open polemics and direct attacks by the opponent of\nSalafism on the \"Sunnah\" practices in Perlis which they\noften equated with Salafism and Wahabism, thus publicizing\nit to those who might never have heard of it (A.

The support given and attendance of the \"Sunnah\"\nevents in Perlis were not confined to the people of Perlis.\nDue to the popularity of the controversial Mohd Asri on the\nmainstream and social media, most of the events involving\nhim as a speaker were often attended by outsiders from as far\nas Singapore. Mohd Asri was also able to invite his like-\nminded scholar friends from all over Malaysia and overseas\nto help him in educating the people of Perlis about the\n\"Sunnah.\" Among the landmark events during Mohd Asri's\nperiod as the Mufti of the state were \"Seminar Antarabangsa\nSyeikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab\" (International Seminar\non Syeikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab) on March 16 and\ntinuation of the previous al-Islah's legacy) on November 28\ngovernment also actively organized a series of seminars for\ngovernment servants and other related agencies on Islamic\nissues (M.

In addition, the office of the Mufti was also\ninvolved in organizing the \"Ihya Masjid\" (Reviving the\nMosques), where selected mosques were chosen to organize\nfast-breaking feasts every Monday and Thursday followed\nMalik and Mat 9\nby religious talks given by Mohd Asri himself or any other\nreligious officer on duty (M.

Perlis too became a favorite destination for Saudi\nArabia preachers to deliver talks, and organize seminars and\ntrainings due to the good relations that had been established\nduring Mohd Asri's time. Perlis representatives on official\nvisits and in delegations to the kingdom were always given\nspecial attention and treatment by the Saudi government (M.\nIt is believed that the short Shahidan-Mohd Asri golden\nperiod was a reawakening of the \"Sunnah\" for many people\nin Perlis. However, one may refer to Akram Dahaman in his\nMA dissertation (Universiti Malaya) who concludes that the\nSunnah Perlis idea only had a significant role in the formula-\ntion of the fatwa with no real effect on enforcement and\npromulgation (Mohd Akram, 2005). This is due to the strong\nmainstream Shafii madhhab influence among Muslims in\nMalaysia which includes Muslims in Perlis. However, the\ndissertation was completed before Dr. Asri Zainul Abidin\nbecame the mufti of the state during which time he brought a\nnew chapter to the practice of Sunnah Perlis and to the life of\nthe people of Perlis. Although no thorough academic exer-\ncise has ever been done on the acceptance of the people of\nPerlis of Sunnah Perlis after the time of Mohd Asri as Mufti,\nhowever, the wide and all encompassing programs and\nenforcement done while he was Mufti have made significant\nchanges to the way the \"Sunnah Perlis\" is practised beyond\nthe fatwa formulation.\nHowever, Othman and Rahmat (1991), who had con-\nducted a research on the topic of acceptance of the people of\nof respondents agreed with Sunnah Perlis, while 23.5% dis-\nreport, that according to his observation on 30 mosques all\nover Perlis, one third of the mosques still adhere to Shafii\nmadhhab and do not practice the \"Sunnah Perlis\" way in\nconducting their congregational rituals and worships (p.\n154). Still, there is yet no thorough academic exercise done\non the impact of Shahidan-Mohd Asri's \"Sunnah\" legacy on\nthe practice of Islam among the Muslim community in Perlis.\nPart of Mohd Asri's legacy and approach were later con-\ntinued by his successor, Dr. Juanda Jaya. Juanda claims that\neven from his first day in office, his approach will be differ-\nent from that of Mohd Asri (J.

The\nKing, instead, appointed his successor, Dr. Md Isa Sabu, an\nUMNO stalwart, as the new Menteri Besar of Perlis (M. S.\nUnlike Shahidan, Md Isa failed to continue the aggressive\nstruggle to uphold the \"Sunnah\" agenda in the state. He was\nnever reported to have voiced any concern or made any sub-\nstantial contribution toward the propagation of the \"Sunnah\"\nin Perlis. However, according to Juanda, he was not left\nalone to continue the \"Sunnah\" agenda.

There are\nmore than 50 titles of books, monographs, journals, reports,\nand booklets published by the office of the Mufti under\nJuanda's time. They were distributed without any commer-\ncial purpose as part of the propagation of Islam and Perlis\nSunnah.

The reappointment of Mohd Asri gave a new momen-\ntum to the Sunnah Perlis movement after the relative stagna-\ntion period. Unlike his earlier appointment which was\nsupported by the Menteri Besar, his second appointment was\nat the direct preference of the King of Perlis himself. Mohd\nAsri's efforts in strengthening Sunnah Perlis during his sec-\nond appointment was fully supported and blessed by both the\nKing and his Crown prince (Raja Muda). Various events,\nactivities, regulations, and platforms were conducted to\nenhance the teachings of Islam which exceeded the tradi-\ntional teachings of Sunnah Perlis which focused on rituals\nMohd Asri too proposed that a group of 15 PhD holders\nwere mainly academics to be part of his Fatwa Committee,\nand they were later appointed by the King to the position (A.\nNumerous contemporary and nonconventional fatwa (decree)\nrelated to the modern contemporary and multicultural and\nmultireligious social cohesion were discussed and decreed\nby the group, such as the decision that the custody of chil-\ndren born into a non-Muslim family with any of their parents\nhaving converted to Islam should be granted to the parent\ndeemed more capable of raising the child, regardless of their\nreligion, for the welfare of the children, rather than to auto-\nmatically convert them to Islam as practised in most other\nstates,7 the fatwa on the prohibition of any doings that harm\nthe environment beside the fatwa prohibiting the practice of\nthe female child genital mutilation (FGM), the permissibility\nof having milk bank at government hospitals for the usage of\npremature babies.8\nMohd Asri too was known for his contemporary, multira-\ncial friendly but controversial opinions that usually went\nagainst the popular conservative views of the religious estab-\nlishment.9 He also actively addressed the khalwat issue,10\nchild custodianship,11 and the ineffectiveness of the Zakat\ndistribution,12 and his opinions have been seen by many as\ngoing against the thoughts and flow of mainstream official\nreligious authorities. As an example, he went against state-\nments made by some religious figures labeling certain non-\nMuslim parties, especially the opposition Democratic Action\nParty (DAP) as kafir harbi. He appears to be a strong critic of\nthe efforts to amend the Syariah Courts (Criminal Jurisdiction)\nAct 1965 to allow certain Hudud law punishment to be imple-\nmented in certain states in Malaysia despite the national cam-\npaign led by PAS and other Islamic organizations.13\nConclusion\nUnlike the perception about the term Salafism that was gen-\nerally associated with conservatism, rigidity, and extremism,\nSunnah Perlis, as a legacy of the early 20th-century reformed\nSalafism, has a different face. Unlike the conventional repre-\nsentation of the current Gulf-style Salafism, \"Sunnah Perlis\"\nemphasizes the freedom from madhhab rigidity calling upon\nMuslims to return directly to the two major sources of Islam\nin dealing with religious issues, namely, al-Quran and\nSunnah (Prophet Muhammad's tradition). The historical\ndevelopment of Sunnah Perlis, as a state-sponsored or\npatronaged Salafism, has shown us the dynamism of the\nmovement itself. The presupposition and prevailing assump-\ntion about the spread of \"Sunnah\" teaching in Perlis is about\nthe advancement of the state religious authority with the sup-\nport from its monarchy.\nIt is undeniable that initially the rulers had played a perti-\nnent role in keeping the \"Sunnah\" teaching strongly instilled\nwith the practice of the Perlis Muslim community. However,\nthroughout this research, historical evidence proves that both\npropaganda and education play a relatively significant role in\nmaintaining the adherence of the people to the \"Sunnah.\"\nMoreover, the preaching of the \"Sunnah\" was not substan-\ntively sufficient in defending the \"Sunnah\" practice among\nPerlis Muslims. Historical events record that other factors,\nsuch as legal, political, and administrative measures, have\nbeen taken by \"Sunnah\" guardians throughout the 20th cen-\ntury to maintain the feasibility of the \"Sunnah\" teaching.\nFurthermore, it was during the \"Tiga Mat\" and Shahidan\nKasim-Mohd Asri periods that the religious authority of\nPerlis made countless efforts to secure the \"Sunnah\" teach-\nings. These efforts are most significant in the establishment\nof the enactment that allows the \"Sunnah\" to be imple-\nmented, referred, and adhered to by the religious authority\nand the monarchy. This form of enactment does not just limit\nitself to the two institutions; it was also made use of in deter-\nmining fatwas in Perlis. The domination of \"Sunnah\" teach-\nings was then completed when the religious authority and\nscholars such as Mohd Asri went around the mosques in\nPerlis to enforce the enactment and regulations in the state.\nThis is done to ensure this precious historical movement is\npassed down to future generations.\nThe historical events indicate that political influence will\nplay a prudent role in ensuring the survival of the \"Sunnah\" in\nPerlis. During preindependent Malaya, the monarchs played a\nsignificantly pertinent role in installing and preserving the\n\"Sunnah\" teachings. During postindependent Malaysia, how-\never, it was the politicians and mainly UMNO politicians who\nfought for the \"Sunnah\" teaching to remain as the prevailing\nand dominant Islamic discourse in Perlis. Similarly, in the 21st\ncentury, the political will is not the sole factor in influencing\nthe enforcement and spread of the \"Sunnah\" in Perlis; global-\nization and media coverage have helped it to gain a more sub-\nstantive existence in Perlis. Unlike the 20th century, \"Sunnah\"\nsurvival in Perlis remains a local struggle for the reformists in\nPerlis. The 21st century has witnessed the \"Sunnah\" teaching\nas a nationwide reform movement, starting from the Mohd\nAsri-Shahidan period, and it can be said to be mainly due to\nmedia coverage and globalization.\n"
