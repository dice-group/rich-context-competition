Efforts to improve adolescent health through\nhealth care should address factors influencing foregone care.\ncerns about privacy influence their will-\ningness to seek health care and, in\ncontrast to adults' concerns about pri-\nvacy, adolescents worry about disclo-\nsure of sensitive health information to\ntheir parents.16-19 A recent survey found\nthat among adolescents who report a\nhistory of not getting needed health\ncare, the leading reason was that they\ndid not want their parents to know, fol-\nlowed by financial or insurance rea-\ning biological maturity, adolescents may\nlack the cognitive or psychosocial\nmaturity to effectively use health care\nsystems during a time when they are\ndeveloping increased autonomy.22\nTo determine the potential impor-\ntance of foregone health care among\nadolescents, several gaps in our knowl-\nedge need to be addressed. First, the\nnumber of adolescents who forego\nhealth care on an annual basis is not\nknown. Most national population es-\ntimates of unmet health needs among\nadolescents have been limited by reli-\nance on data from parents or other adult\nfamily members9-14 who may not be\nfully aware of adolescents' health needs\nor decisions to forego health care for\nsensitive health issues.23 Previous stud-\nies that have directly asked adoles-\ncents about unmet health needs have\nbeen regional studies and/or limited by\nuse of measures for foregone care that\nond, we do not know if adolescents who\nforego care are the \"worried well\" or at\nrisk of real health problems. Third,\ncomparisons between factors that are\nassociatedwithforegonehealthcareand\ngeneral health care utilization among\nadolescents have not been performed.\nIffactorspredictingforegonehealthcare\nare substantially different than factors\npredicting general health care utiliza-\ntion, then policies aimed solely at im-\nproving general utilization among ado-\nlescents may not effectively reduce\nforegone care.\nThe National Longitudinal Study of\nAdolescent Health (Add Health) pro-\nvides opportunities to begin to ad-\ndress these gaps in our existing knowl-\nedge.25 The main objectives of this study\nare to define a national population es-\ntimate of annual foregone health care\namong adolescents, their risk of health\nproblems, and reasons for foregone\ncare. In addition, this study describes\nthe influence of sociodemographic fac-\ntors, family characteristics, insurance\nstatus, previous health care, behaviors\nwith risk of negative health outcomes,\nand symptoms suggestive of serious\nphysical or mental health problems on\nadolescents' report of foregone health\ncare within the past year and makes\ncomparisons between factors influenc-\ning foregone care vs having a physical\nexamination in the past year.\nMETHODS\nStudy Population\nAll procedures for Add Health were ap-\nproved by the University of North Caro-\nlina Institutional Review Board on Re-\nsearch Involving Human Subjects.\nA stratified nationally representative\nsample of all public and private high\nschools in the United States was drawn\nfromtheQualityEducationDatabasein\nprobability proportional to size across\nbroad strata based on region, urbanic-\nity, school type (public, private, and\nparochial), and racial composition. For\neach of the 80 primary sampling strata,\na school or school pair spanning grades\n7 through 12 was recruited to partici-\npate in the study. Seventy percent of the\noriginallyselectedschoolsagreedtopar-\nticipate. Replacement schools were\nrecruited within each community.

In addition, 1\nparent in each household completed a\nwritten questionnaire that included\nquestions about the adolescents' insur-\nance status.\nMeasures of Independent\nVariables\nIndividualFactors.Agewascomputed\nfrom date of birth.

Among adolescents\nwho forego care, 15% report that this is\nin part because a parent or guardian will\nnot go or no one is available to go with\nthem, and 12% report that it is partly be-\ncause they do not want their parents to\nknow. This reflects the developmental\ncomplexities of parent-child relation-\nships during adolescence. On one hand,\nmany adolescents want parents to be in-\nvolved in health care, depend on par-\nents for transportation, and need their\nparents'consenttoobtainhealthcare.On\nthe other hand, some adolescents have\nimportant health issues that they want\nto keep private16-21 and certain types of\nmedical care can be provided without\nparents' consent.36 All adolescents have\nthedevelopmentaltaskoflearningtobe-\ncome responsible for their own health\nand health care and developing a pri-\nvate relationship with their physician as\ntheyapproachadulthood.Difficultiesne-\ngotiating the health care system may in\npart be due to adolescents' relative in-\nexperience as consumers of health care.\nStrategies to reduce foregone health\ncare among adolescents must con-\nsider these developmental issues. Pro-\nfessional organizations support increas-\ning adolescents' access to health services\nin general and confidential health ser-\nvices when needed, because of con-\ncerns about adolescents' unmet health\nbeen suggested to increase adoles-\ncents' access to health care include in-\ncreasing the availability of conve-\nnient, affordable, and developmentally\nappropriate health services. This in-\ncludes ensuring that private, confiden-\ntial health services are available for sen-\nsitivehealthissues,therebyencouraging\nadolescents to seek and receive needed\nhealth care for concerns related to sub-\nstance use, sexual behaviors, and men-\ntal health. Our results suggest that these\nstrategies have the potential to in-\ncrease clinicians' opportunities to ad-\ndress issues related to major causes of\nadolescent morbidity and mortality by\ndecreasing the numbers of adoles-\ncents who forego health care.\nSeveral potential limitations of this\nstudy should be noted. Self-report data\nhasinherentlimitations;however,ado-\nlescent reports of their own health care\nbehaviors are probably at least as accu-\nrateasadultreportsofadolescenthealth\ncarebehaviorsandprobablymoreaccu-\nrateinregardtoforegonecare.Measures\nfor symptoms associated with risk of\nhealth problems were oriented toward\nchronicconditionsratherthanacutecon-\nditions.

The newly enacted State Chil-\ndren's Health Insurance Programs rep-\nresent an important step toward achiev-\ning the goal of continuous insurance for\nall adolescents. However, insurance\nalone does not ensure that adoles-\ncents will receive needed health care.\nAdolescents who choose to forego\nhealth care are of particular concern be-\ncause they appear to be at dispropor-\ntionately high risk of having health\nproblems. Factors that influence ado-\nlescents to forego care must be consid-\nered when designing systems to ad-\ndress adolescents' unique health needs.\nFunding/Support: Data are from the National Lon-\ngitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a\nprogram project designed by J.
