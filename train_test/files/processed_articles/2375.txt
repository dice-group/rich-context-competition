Akinyemiju*\nDepartment of Epidemiology, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America\n Introduction\nCancer incidence and mortality rates have been declining in\ndeveloped, western nations due mainly to a reduction in risk\nfactors such as smoking and improved screening and treatment\nregimens [1\u00ad5]. However, the opposite trend is being observed in\nlow-income countries; cancer incidence and mortality rates have\nbeen increasing and are projected to increase at even faster rates\n[6\u00ad10]. Of the 12 million incident cases and 8 million deaths due\nthe deaths occurred in less developed countries [11]. There are\nseveral suggested reasons for these increases including the rising\npopularity of western lifestyle that includes smoking, lower\nphysical activity levels, lower reproduction rates and higher\ncalorie intake [7,12\u00ad16]. In addition, developing countries are\ndisproportionately affected by infectious agents that may cause\ncancer such as the Human Papillomavirus (for cervical cancer), H.\nPylori (for stomach cancer) and Hepatitis B and C (for liver cancer)\nThe high cancer mortality rates can also be partly attributed to\nlack of adequate health infrastructure and healthcare personnel in\ndeveloping counties [18\u00ad21]. One major approach to reducing\nmortality rates involves improving access to cancer screening.\nBreast and cervical cancer are the two most common cancers in\nmost low-income countries, accounting for 19% and 23% of all\ncancers respectively [22\u00ad24]. Fortunately, adequate screening is\ncapable of identifying these cancers at early stages where treatment\nregimens are effective, uncomplicated and cheaper [25]. Unfor-\ntunately, cancer screening rates are very low in developing\ncountries; only 19% of women were screened for cervical cancer in\ndeveloping countries, compared with over 60% in developed\nBangladesh had received a Pap test in the past 3 years [27]. In\naddition to lack of infrastructure and personnel, competing\nhealthcare crises in poor countries due to HIV/AIDS or infant\nmortality may further complicate the receipt of adequate cancer\nscreening [11]. It is therefore very important to understand the\nfactors that affect cancer screening in order to develop programs to\nmake it easier for women to get screened in both rural and urban\nareas.\nTwo recent studies have examined the impact of income\ninequality on cervical cancer screening among countries that\nparticipated in the WHS [26,27]. These studies contribute to\nbetter understanding of the factors that impact screening. The\npurpose of this study is to further explore determinants of breast\nand cervical cancer screening among women, focusing on those\nresiding in low-income countries. Very little has been published so\nfar about the factors that affect cancer screening in low income\ncountries, and this may be due to the lack of quality survey data on\ncancer screening. However, the World Health Survey provides a\nunique opportunity to use high quality data collected in a\nstandardized format to examine specific factors such as SES and\naccess to healthcare that influence adequate breast and cervical\ncancer screening. In addition, country level characteristics that\nreflect the strength and quality of the public health infrastructure\nsuch as health expenditure and under-5 mortality rates may also\npredict screening and were assessed in this study. We hypothesize\nthat low socio-economic status and poor access to healthcare are\nmajor predictors of cancer screening in low-income countries.\nMethods\nData Sources and Analytic Samples\nSurvey (WHS) conducted in 70 countries by the World Health\nOrganization. The details of the survey have been published\nelsewhere [27,28] and is available online at http://www.who.int/\nhealthinfo/survey/en/. In brief, the WHS is a cross-sectional,\nmultistage cluster survey that utilizes a probability sampling design\nin which every individual in the sampling frame has a known and\nnon-zero probability of being in the survey sample. Data from\neach country was designed to be nationally representative of the\ncountry's eligible population at the time of the survey. Eligible\nsurvey participants were men and women ages 18 years and older\nwho were surveyed through private (where possible), face-to-face\ninterviews by survey interviewers [29]. The survey captured\ninformation on demographics, health status, risk factors, health\nsystem responsiveness, health expenditure and coverage, access\nand utilization of health services. Information was collected at the\nhousehold and individual level. Survey materials were translated\ninto local languages where appropriate and reviewed according to\nstandard WHO protocol.\nThis analysis was restricted to WHS data from low income\ncountries. Low-income was defined according to the World Bank's\nclassification of countries based on the 2010 Gross National\nIncome (GNI) per capita. Based on this criterion, low-income\ncountries are those that have a GNI per capita of $1,005 or less.\nDetails of this categorization can be found at http://data.\nworldbank.org/about/country-classifications. In addition, three\nother country level characteristics were obtained from the World\nBank; total health expenditure as a percentage of GDP, under-5\nmortality rate per 1,000 and gross national income per capita.\nData from 15 low-income countries that participated in the\nWHS were used in this analysis. The countries included are: Chad,\nMali, Congo (Brazzaville), Comoros, Laos, Zimbabwe, Burkina\nFaso, Nepal, Mauritania, Myanmar, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi,\nEthiopia and Bangladesh. Data from Zambia was not included in\nthe analysis because only one cluster represented the entire\ncountry which did not permit for analysis using valid survey\nstatistical methods. In addition, data from 2 strata in Nepal and\nKenya were dropped from the variance estimation process due to\nmissing data on demographic information. Survey sampling\nanalytic procedures was employed to account for clustering and\nunequal probability of selection. The analytic dataset was\nscreening. Questions about health care access were only asked of\nrespondents who had visited a healthcare facility for themselves or\ntheir children in the past 12 months. Therefore, this analysis\nfocused on women in the specified age groups who had been to a\nthe study criteria.\nData Management\nCancer Screening. There were three questions in the WHS\naddressing cancer screening, two about cervical cancer screening\nasked of women ages 18 to 69 years, and one about mammog-\nraphy use asked of women ages 40 to 69 years. 1. ``When was the\nlast time you had a pelvic examination, if ever? (By pelvic\nexamination, I mean when a doctor or nurse examined your\nvagina and uterus?)''. 2. ``The last time you had the pelvic\nexamination, did you have a PAP smear test? (By PAP smear test, I\nmean did a doctor or nurse use a swab or stick to wipe from inside\nyour vagina, take a sample and send it to a laboratory?)''. 3.\n``When was the last time you had a mammography, if ever? (That\nis, an xray of your breasts taken to detect breast cancer at an early\nstage)''. For this analysis, cervical cancer screening was defined as\na pelvic examination with or without a pap test in the past 3 years\namong women ages 18\u00ad69 years; while breast cancer screening\nwas defined as a mammography test in the past 5 years among\nSocio-Demographic Variables. Marital status was catego-\nrized as single, married/cohabiting or divorced/separated/\nwidowed. Education level was categorized as primary school or\nless, secondary school or college and higher. Employment was\ncategorized as government employee, self-employed or not\nworking for pay. Age was categorized as ,40 years, 40\u00ad60 years\nand .60 years. Residence was categorized as rural or urban. All\nvariables are based on self-reports.\nSocio-Economic Status. Permanent income indicators for\nlow-income countries were used to define socio-economic status\nfor survey respondents. Survey questions assessed ownership of a\nrange of assets from chairs, tables, ploughs and buckets to cars,\nmobile phones, washing machines and refrigerators. Country-\nspecific items were also added to the list of permanent income\nindicators to account for differences between countries. To create\na composite measure of socio-economic status, country-specific\nprincipal components analysis (PCA) was performed using these\npermanent income indicators. This approach has been used in\nprevious studies using data from low-income countries where\nincome and education variables are often inaccurate and not likely\nto capture the full extent of an individual's socio-economic status\n[30\u00ad33]. In brief, an SES score was calculated for each household\nby weighting each income indicator by the coefficient of the first\nprincipal component. All individuals present in the household\nwere assigned the same household SES score, and the score was\ncategorized into tertiles; poorest, middle and richest.\nAccess to Healthcare. Individual access to healthcare was\nassessed in this study using questions related to health system\nresponsiveness in the WHS. There were four variables used to\ndefine access to healthcare: 1. Last place visited in the past 12\nmonths (e.g. government facility, private facility, NGO, or other);\nCancer Screening in Low-Income Countries\n2. Last healthcare provider visited (e.g. medical doctor, nurse,\nmidwife, traditional practitioner, etc); 3. How long it took to get\nthere (in minutes); 4. Mode of transportation (e.g. private car,\npublic transportation, biking or walking).\nCountry Covariates. Country level healthcare infrastructure\ncharacteristics were assessed using three variables obtained from\nthe World Bank; health expenditure as a percent of GDP, under-5\nmortality, and the Gross National Income. Health expenditure as\na percent of GDP is a measure of public and private health\nexpenditure on preventive and curative health services. Under-five\nmortality rate represents the probability per 1,000 that an infant\nwill die before age five if current age-specific mortality rates apply.\nGNI per capita is a measure of the total value of all products and\nservices produced by the domestic economy of a country divided\nby the population of the country, measured in US dollars.\nStatistical Analysis\nSAS statistical software (SAS, Version 9.2) was used for data\nanalysis. Survey analytic procedures were used to account for the\ncomplex survey design. Sample weights that represent the\npopulation of each specific country, and stratum codes that are\nnested within each country based on the country's survey design\nwere incorporated into the analysis. Descriptive statistics were\ngenerated using chi-square tests with the SURVEYFREQ\nprocedure in SAS. The outcome variables were dichotomized\ninto recent mammography screening or not and recent cervical\nscreening or not. SURVEYLOGISTIC procedures were used for\nTable 1.

Two models\nwere developed for each outcome of interest; the first model\nincluded socio-demographic, SES and healthcare access variables,\nand the second included individual and country level covariates.\nOdds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were reported; and a p-\nvalue of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. List-\nwise deletion was used to deal with missing data. Data were\nexpected to be missing at random since the WHS was a\ncomprehensive survey designed to elicit responses to a wide range\nof questions, so there was likely no correlation between missing\nresponses and our specific outcomes of interest.\nResults\nThe majority of the women in the analytic sample (women who\nhad visited a healthcare facility in the past 12 months) were less\nthan 40 years old (60%), married (71%), had only a primary school\neducation or less (85%), were not currently working for pay (72%),\nand 79% of the women resided in rural areas (Table 1). During\ntheir last visit to a healthcare facility in the past year, most of the\nwomen had visited an NGO or other type of healthcare provider\n(36%), 35.7% had visited a government healthcare facility and\n28% had visited a private healthcare facility. During the visit, 43%\nhad seen a medical doctor, 22% had seen a nurse/midwife, while\n36% had seen a traditional health provider. The majority of the\nwomen (82%) used public transportation to get to the facility, 15%\nwalked or biked while 2% used a private vehicle. Travel time to\nthe facility was less than 30 minutes for 67% of the women,\ncountries had received a pelvic exam or pap smear in the past\nthree years. There were wide variations in the prevalence of\ncervical cancer screening by country, ranging from 1.1% in\nBangladesh to 57.6% in Congo (Figure 1). Among women ages\nyears, ranging from 0% in Mali to 26% in Congo.\nFactors that significantly increased the likelihood of receiving a\npelvic exam or pap smear in the past 3 years among 18 to 69 year\nold women included being younger than 60 years, having a\nsecondary school education or greater, and seeing a nurse/\nmidwife at the last health center visit (Table 1). Being single,\ndivorced or widowed, not currently employed, residing in a rural\narea, residing in a low or middle SES household, visiting an NGO\nclinic, seeing a traditional health practitioner and having to walk\nor bike to the health center were variables significantly associated\nwith reduced likelihood of a pelvic exam or pap smear. Among\nwomen ages 40 to 60 years old, having at least a secondary school\neducation and a travel time of less than 30 minutes to the health\ncenter were associated with increased likelihood of receiving a\nmammography exam in the past 5 years. Being currently\nunemployed, residing in a rural, low or middle SES household,\nseeing a traditional health practitioner and having to walk or bike\nto the health center were significantly associated with reduced\nlikelihood of a mammography exam.\nIn multivariate analysis of pelvic exam or pap smear among 18\nto 69 year old women, after adjusting for age, education,\nemployment and marital status, residing in the lowest SES\nhousehold was associated with a 43% reduction (OR = 0.57,\nlikelihood of receiving a pelvic exam/pap smear (Table 2). In\naddition, visiting an NGO instead of a government or private\nhood of receiving a pelvic exam/pap smear. After adjusting for\nfixed effect of country covariates, these variables remained\nstatistically significant and their effects appeared to be even\nstronger (Table 2). In addition, every unit increase in country\nhealth expenditure (as a percent of GDP), increased the likelihood\nIn multivariate analysis of mammography screening among\nwomen ages 40 to 69, several two-way interaction terms were\nfound to be significant predictors (Table 3). First, among women\nwhose travel mode to a healthcare facility during their last visit was\nby public transportation, residing in a middle SES household\nFigure 1.

Compared with\nvisiting a government run facility, private healthcare facilities\nappeared to increase the likelihood of mammography screening\nwomen residing in middle or low SES households appeared to\nhave significantly lower likelihood of mammography screening\nregardless of residence in a rural or urban area as well as mode of\ntransportation. The only country level covariate found to be a\nsignificant predictor of mammography screening was under-5\nmortality rate; there was a 2% increase in the likelihood of\nreceiving mammography for every unit increase in the under-5\nmortality rate.\nDiscussion\nThis study focused on assessing the rates and determinants of\nbreast and cervical cancer screening among women residing in\ndeveloping countries. In order to assess the influence of health care\naccess on screening rates, this analysis was restricted to women\nwho had visited a healthcare clinic for themselves or their children\nin the past year. Generally, screening rates were very low,\nalthough there were wide variations between countries. Mam-\nmography screening rates were very low in most countries, while\ncervical cancer screening by pelvic examination and/or Pap smear\nwas more common. Other studies have reported these low\nscreening rates and wide variation by country previously\n[26,27]. The low rates of mammography screening in this\npopulation is not surprising given the extensive cost and advanced\ninfrastructure required to have systemic mammography facilities\nand trained personnel. Many organizations such as the WHO do\nnot recommend routine mammography screening for poor\nTable 2.

The focus of this analysis\nwas on socio-economic status and healthcare access determinants\nof screening. After adjusting for several important individual level\ncovariates such as age, education, employment and martial status,\nbelonging to the poorest SES household, living in a rural\ncommunity and visiting an NGO clinic (versus a government or\nprivate run clinic) were significantly associated with lower\nlikelihood of receiving cervical cancer screening. There were no\nsignificant associations between travel time and travel mode and\ncervical cancer screening. After adjusting for country level\ncharacteristics related to health expenditure, these same covariates\nremained significant. In addition, country expenditure on health\n(as % of GDP) had a very large impact on cervical cancer\nscreening. This suggests that irrespective of individual and\nneighborhood factors, the government's investment in the health\ninfrastructure has the potential for significantly improving cancer\nscreening rates within a country. This aligns with other studies\nwhich have generally shown that increased health expenditure\nimproves health outcomes [35,36]. Such investment could\ninfluence screening rates through better equipments and trained\npersonnel in hospitals, or better outreach and education of women\nabout the importance of screening.\nAlthough mammography screening rates were generally low,\nthere were significant differences in the likelihood of obtaining a\nmammography test in the past 5 years based on SES, rural/urban\nresidence and travel time. The only country level covariate that\nwas significantly associated with mammography screening was the\nunder-5 mortality rate. It is possible that for developing countries,\nthe cost of having a functional mammography screening facility is\nso prohibitively high that within limited budgets, even major\nincreases in health expenditure (as % of GDP) are inadequate.\nWhile unintuitive, under-5 mortality rate may increase the\nlikelihood of receiving a mammography test through increased\ncontact with the healthcare system. It is possible that a high under-\n5 mortality rate within the country may force women to have more\nfrequent contact with hospitals and healthcare personnel who may\nalso recommend health check-ups for the mothers including\npotentially cancer screening.\nThis study is the first of its kind to assess the contribution of\nSES, the health care system and country-level healthcare\nexpenditure on cancer screening in developing countries.

This may be because low SES households\ntend to be less educated and less likely to be aware of the benefits\nof cancer screening or are likely to have negative perceptions\nabout screening. It is also likely that working low-paying, menial\njobs leaves little time or opportunity to participate in screening\nprograms. This analysis shows that the influence of SES on breast\ncancer screening varies depending on rural/urban residence. For\ninstance, in urban areas, women belonging to middle SES\nhouseholds have much lower odds of receiving a mammography\ntest compared with women belonging to middle SES households in\nrural areas. This may be due to the lack of community resources,\nand the higher cost of living in urban areas compared with rural\nareas that provide less disposable income for urban middle SES\nhouseholds to be spent on healthcare.\nA major strength of this study is the assessment of socio-\neconomic and health system factors from developing countries\nsurveyed as part of the 2003 World Health Survey. The\nstandardized protocol and questionnaires allowed for the use of\ndata from several developing countries. Also, the use of PCA to\ndefine household SES allowed for the inclusion of household assets\nand did not rely only on income and education. This improves the\nvalidity of the SES measure by accounting for differences in SES\nbetween rural and urban areas, and between countries. In\naddition, the availability of country level variables from the World\nBank allowed for the assessment of the impact of country\ncharacteristics on cancer screening. Limitations of this analysis\ninclude the survey nature of the responses which may be\nvulnerable to recall bias on the part of the respondents. Also,\nthe health system characteristics assessed in this study was based\non the last healthcare facility attended in the past year. It is\npossible that this is not representative of the facility that a woman\nwould normally attend for cancer screening.\nIn summary, cancer screening rates in developing countries are\ngenerally very low. Unfortunately, there are large projected\nincreases in cancer rates in developing countries in the coming\ndecades due to the increasing westernization of lifestyle as well as\nenvironmental factors. If we are to meet the challenge of the rising\ncancer epidemic in these regions of the world, it will be very\nimportant to understand the factors that inhibit and encourage\ncancer screening in order to promote early detection. Some of\nthese barriers include factors related to healthcare access such as\navailability and accessibility of healthcare facilities and healthcare\nproviders, as well as the lack of a comprehensive approach to\ncancer prevention, screening and treatment on a national level. In\naddition, some countries may require extra efforts aimed at\nincluding men in cancer education programs about the necessity\nfor routine breast and cervical cancer screening for their women,\nsince in many cases their permission may be needed.\nDeveloping countries face monumental challenges; ranging\nfrom socio-economic to infrastructural and massive infectious\ndisease epidemics. However, these challenges must not detract\nfrom the importance of understanding and addressing barriers to\nproper cancer screening. Based on this analysis, improving the\nquality and access to government run hospitals especially in rural\nareas and increasing the government expenditure on health (as %\nof GDP) appear to be ways by which cancer screening can be\nimproved.\n"
