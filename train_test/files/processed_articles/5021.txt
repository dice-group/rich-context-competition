We assessed the performance of a sixth-generation CGM system (Dexcom G6) in children and adolescents.\nMethods: Forty-nine participants (6-17 years of age, mean \u00b1 SD of 13.5 \u00b1 3.3 years), all with type 1 diabetes, enrolled and\ndata were available from 37. Each participant wore 1 sensor for up to 10 days and was asked to undergo an in-clinic visit\nlasting 6-12 hours for frequent blood glucose (BG) sample testing on one of the sensor wear days. Estimated glucose values\n(EGVs) from the G6 system were compared with venous BG values measured with a laboratory reference instrument (YSI).\nResults: The overall mean absolute relative difference (MARD) for 1387 EGV-YSI pairs was 7.7%, and the overall percentage\nof EGVs within 20% or 20 mg/dL of the YSI reference value (for YSI > or 100 mg/dL, respectively, the \"%20/20\") was\nwere within 20 mg/dL and for EGVs >250 mg/dL, 100% of the YSI values were within 20%. Differences between EGVs and\nYSI values in over 99.9% of the pairs posed no or only slight clinical risk as evaluated by surveillance error grid analysis.\nConclusions: The accuracy of the G6 CGM system in pediatrics may encourage consistent use of the system and contribute\nto improved glycemic outcomes in this population.\n",

However, CGM users are still in the minority.\nBarriers to increased adoption may include the requirement\nfor periodic fingerstick calibrations and short sensor wear\ntimes.

Point and Percentage Accuracy in Pediatric Participants Overall and by Clinic Session Day.\nMethods\nMethods used to assess the performance of the G6 system\n(Dexcom, Inc, San Diego, CA) have been published previ-\nously.8 Briefly, G6 was evaluated using retrospective data\nfrom a prospectively designed, multicenter study involving\nboth adults (ages 18 and older) and pediatric participants\nsites. Data presented here are from pediatric participants.\nStudy Procedures and Data Collection\nAll sensor insertions were performed at the clinic by partici-\npants and/or guardians using the automated sensor applica-\ntor. All participants used the G6 system for one 10-day wear\nPediatric participants returned to the clinic for one session\nyears returned for one 6-hour clinic session and participants\nages 13-17 years returned for one 12-hour clinic session for\ncomparison of CGM readings with arterialized venous glu-\ncose concentrations using a laboratory reference method\n(YSI). Participants had venous sampling once every 15 \u00b1 5\nminutes for the duration of each clinic session for reference\nglucose measurement. CGM data were masked during the\nclinic session. The study was reviewed by the FDA through\nthe Investigational Device Exemption process and registered\nMethods of Data Analysis\nAnalysis was performed on estimated glucose values\n(EGVs) derived from reprocessed raw sensor data, without\nincorporating information from fingerstick calibrations. YSI\nvalues were paired with temporally matched EGVs; matched\npairs within the CGM reportable range of 40-400 mg/dL\nwere evaluated. No matched pair data were excluded from\nanalysis.\nAccuracy metrics included the proportion of the EGVs\n20 mg/dL of YSI values 100 mg/dL (hereafter referred to\noverall mean absolute relative difference (MARD) was\ndetermined as the average absolute relative difference\nbetween paired EGVs and YSI values. Surveillance error\ngrid analysis9 was used to quantify the clinical risks resulting\nfrom CGM inaccuracies.\nAccuracy across glucose concentrations was evaluated for\nthe following ranges: hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL), euglycemia\nTrend accuracy assessed the concurrence between rates of\nglucose change measured by CGM and YSI. Rate of change\n(RoC) was calculated by interpolating per-minute glucose con-\ncentrations for YSI and CGM data separately. Six YSI RoC\ncategories ranging from rapidly decreasing (<\u00ad2 mg/(dLmin))\nto rapidly increasing (>2 mg/(dLmin)) were established. The\nfrequency of CGM-measured RoCs that agreed with YSI-\nmeasured RoCs was assessed. Point and percentage accuracy\nwas also determined at different EGV RoCs. All analyses were\nperformed using SAS\u00ae software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute,\nInc, Cary, NC).\nResults\nStudy Population\nTwenty-one participants ages 6-12 years and 28 participants\nyears; 61% were female; mean (SD) diabetes duration was\nTwelve pediatric participants were excluded from the accu-\nracy assessment: 6 withdrew from the study voluntarily after\nsensor insertion, and 6 had a sensor or adhesive failure before\nthe clinic session.
