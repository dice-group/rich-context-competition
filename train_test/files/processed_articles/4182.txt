Clinical\ndecision-making may, therefore, not be based on objective evidence of disease activity.\nWe conducted a study to determine factors associated with clinical decision-making in a\nsecondary care inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) population, using a cross-sectional design.\nMethods: Decisions to request investigations or escalate medical therapy were recorded from\noutpatient clinic encounters in a cohort of 276 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's\ndisease (CD). Disease activity was assessed using clinical indices, self-reported flare and\nfaecal calprotectin  250 \u00b5g/g. Demographic, disease-related and psychological factors were\nassessed using validated questionnaires. Logistic regression was performed to determine\nthe association between clinical decision-making and symptoms, mucosal inflammation and\npsychological comorbidity.\nResults: Self-reported flare was associated with requesting investigations in CD [odds ratio\nmedical therapy. Almost 60% of patients referred for investigation had no evidence of mucosal\ninflammation.\nConclusions: Apart from escalation of medical therapy in UC, clinical decision-making was\nnot associated with mucosal inflammation in IBD. The use of point-of-care calprotectin testing\nmay aid clinical decision-making, improve resource allocation and reduce costs in IBD.\n",

Despite\nthis, the correlation between symptom reporting\nand the presence of mucosal inflammation is poor,\nparticularly in CD.4,5\nGI symptoms arising in the absence of inflamma-\ntion, which are reported to affect up to 40% of\npatients with IBD,6 may lead to uncertainty in\ndisease activity assessment when based on patient-\nreported symptoms alone. Moreover, the pres-\nence of somatoform behaviour, which is\nindependently associated with the reporting of\nirritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-type symptoms,7\nmay complicate this situation. Therefore reliance\non symptom reporting alone could result in over-\ninvestigation and overtreatment of patients, lead-\ning to significant financial implications, a potential\nfor adverse events, and diminishing beneficial\nreturns in terms of disease outcome,8 while\nneglecting asymptomatic patients with ongoing\noccult inflammatory activity.\nFaecal biomarkers of intestinal inflammation,\nincluding faecal calprotectin (FC), provide a\nquantifiable, noninvasive and relatively inexpen-\nsive measure of mucosal inflammation. Their use\nis advocated in the differentiation of organic and\nfunctional disease9 and, more recently, has been\nrecommended for the monitoring of disease activ-\nity in IBD.10\u00ad12 When compared with endoscopic\ndisease activity assessment in IBD, FC outper-\nforms both clinical disease activity assessment\nand serum markers of inflammation, including\nC-reactive protein (CRP),13,14 and has a sensitiv-\nity and specificity for the identification of active\nBased on our previous findings,4 where the\nassociation between clinical disease activity\nscores and the presence of mucosal inflamma-\ntion, as defined by FC, was poor, our hypothe-\nsis was that there would be no association\nbetween clinical decision-making and the pres-\nence of mucosal inflammation defined using a\nFC  250 \u00b5g/g, particularly in patients with\nCD. If proven, this may support the routine use\nof point-of-care FC testing as a cost-effective\nmethod of disease assessment, which may\nimprove clinical decision-making, facilitate\nappropriate allocation of scarce resources, and\nreduce the costs of managing outpatients with\nIBD. We aimed to compare the cost of investi-\ngation requesting based on the current system\nof physician global assessment with a novel\nhypothetical model where any patient being\nconsidered for investigation would undergo\npoint-of-care FC testing, with endoscopic or\nradiological investigations subsequently\nrequested only in those with evidence of\nmucosal inflammation.\nMaterials and methods\nParticipants and setting\nThe study was conducted at St James's University\nHospital, Leeds, UK, which serves a local popu-\naged over 16 years with an established radiologi-\ncal, histological or endoscopic diagnosis of CD or\nUC who were attending the IBD clinic were\napproached about the study. Exclusion criteria\nwere an inability to understand written English, a\ndiagnosis of IBD unclassified, and anyone with an\nend ileostomy or colostomy, due to the difficulties\nin assessing disease activity indices in these\npatients. Patients who had undergone radiologi-\ncal or endoscopic investigations in the preceding\n90 days were also excluded as the results of these\ninvestigations were deemed likely to have affected\nany subsequent clinical decision-making. Finally,\nthose with isolated upper GI or isolated fistulising\nperianal CD were also excluded, as the utility of\nFC in these subsets of patients is uncertain. At\nthe clinic attendance, prior to the consultation\nwith a gastroenterologist, individuals were pre-\nsented with an information sheet explaining the\nnature of the study. Those who agreed to take\npart provided written informed consent at this\nvisit. The study was approved by the Yorkshire\nand Humber research ethics committee in\ntion continued until June 2015. Questionnaire\noutcomes and FC results were not available to the\nconsulting physician at any time. Once the study\nquestionnaires were completed, patients pro-\nceeded to clinic consultation as normal without\nany intervention from the study investigators.\nData collection and synthesis\nDemographic data and disease characteris-\ntics.\nOnce informed consent was obtained,\ndemographic data including sex, age, ethnicity,\nY Derwa, CJM Williams et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 3\nmarital status, educational level, tobacco and\nalcohol use, weight (kg) and height (m), which\nwere used to calculate body mass index (BMI),\nwere collected. Medication history, including cur-\nrent use of 5 aminosalicylates (5-ASAs), gluco-\ncorticosteroids, immunosuppressants (including\nthiopurines, methotrexate or mycophenolate\nmofetil) or biological therapies (infliximab, adali-\nmumab or certolizumab) was noted. Disease dis-\ntribution and behaviour, as defined by the\nMontreal classification,16 and any previous intes-\ntinal resection related to CD were also recorded.\nDefinition and assessment of decision to request\ninvestigation or escalate treatment.Clinic letters\nwere reviewed to determine clinician decision-\nmaking regarding investigation requesting or esca-\nlationoftreatmentinresponsetopatientsymptoms.\nRelevant investigations included in this definition\nwere computed tomography enterography, mag-\nnetic resonance enterography, small bowel meal,\ncolonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy or wireless\ncapsule endoscopy for CD and colonoscopy or sig-\nmoidoscopy for UC. Colonoscopies requested\nsolely for routine colitis surveillance were not\nincluded.17 Routine investigations requested for\nannual disease assessment in patients treated with\nanti-tumour necrosis factor  (TNF) drugs were\nnot included, nor were initial investigations\nrequested to assess the extent of disease in patients\nwith newly diagnosed IBD. Escalation of treatment\nwas defined as either the addition of a new treat-\nment or an increase in dosage of a current medica-\ntion. Medications included in this definition were\n5-ASAs, glucocorticosteroids, immunomodulators\nand biological therapies.\nAssessment of IBD activity and mucosal inflamma-\ntion. Assessment of clinical IBD activity was per-\nformed using the Harvey\u00adBradshaw Index (HBI)\nfor CD,18 and the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity\nIndex (SCCAI) for UC,19 with a score of 5 used\nto define clinically active disease for both, as pre-\nviously recommended.20,21 Patients completed\nthese questionnaires prior to consultation, and\nthe results were not available to the reviewing\nphysician. In addition to this, participants were\nasked to report whether, in their own opinion,\nthey were attending with a flare of disease activity,\nand to provide stool for quantitative FC analysis\nby enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Immun-\ndiagnostik, Bensheim, Germany), as an objective\nmarker of mucosal inflammation. We used a cut-\noff of 250 \u00b5g/g of stool to define evidence of\nmucosal inflammation, in line with the European\nCrohn's and Colitis Organisation consensus on\nthe use of FC to measure disease activity,22 which\nrequested at the time of clinic attendance and, for\ninclusion in the study, was returned within 7 days\nof this date. FC results were not available at the\nclinic visit, and FC testing was not routinely avail-\nable to clinicians for disease monitoring in our\ncentre at the time this study was conducted.\nReference standard used to define the presence of\nIBS-type symptoms.The presence or absence of\nIBS-type symptoms was assessed via the Rome\nIII criteria,25 according to the scoring algorithm\nproposed for use with the Rome III diagnostic\nquestionnaire for the adult functional GI disor-\nders. IBS-type symptoms were defined as present\nwhen an individual reported abdominal discom-\nfort or pain with a frequency of 3 days per month\nover the last 3 months, with the onset of discom-\nfort 6 months previously, associated with two or\nmore of the following: an improvement in pain or\ndiscomfort with the passage of stool, more or less\nfrequent bowel movements, or looser or harder\nstools.\nDefinition of anxiety or depression.Anxiety and\ndepression data were collected using the Hospital\nAnxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).26 This\n14-item questionnaire consists of seven questions\nscreening for the presence of anxiety symptoms,\nand seven for depression symptoms, with a four-\npoint response for each item, ranging from 0 to 3.\nThe total HADS score ranges from a minimum of\n0 to a maximum of 21 for both anxiety and\ndepression. Severity was categorised, according to\ntotal HADS score, into normal (total HADS\ndepression or anxiety score 0\u00ad7), borderline nor-\nDefinition of somatisation severity using the Patient\nHealth Questionnaire 15.Somatisation data were\ncollected using the Patient Health Questionnaire\n15 (PHQ-15), which is derived from the validated\npresence of 15 somatic symptoms (or symptom\nclusters) over the last 4 weeks, which contribute\nto over 90% of physical complaints reported in\nthe outpatient environment.29 Each individual\nwas asked to rate the severity of each symptom as\n`not bothered at all' (scored as 0), `bothered a lit-\ntle' (scored as 1) or `bothered a lot' (scored as 2).\nTherefore the total PHQ-15 score ranges from a\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 11 \n4 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\nminimum of 0 to a maximum of 30. Somatisation\nseverity was categorised, using the total PHQ-15\nscore, into high (total PHQ-15 15), medium\nsomatisation severity.\nStatistical analysis\nPatients were dichotomised into those who were\nor were not referred for investigations, those who\nreceived or did not receive escalation of medical\ntherapy, and those who received either referral for\ninvestigation or escalation of medical therapy, or\nthose who received neither. We compared base-\nline demographic and disease-related characteris-\ntics, clinical disease activity indices, the presence\nor absence of symptoms meeting Rome III crite-\nria for IBS, FC levels, the presence or absence of\na self-reported flare of disease activity, as well as\nanxiety, depression and somatisation scores in\npatients with CD and UC separately, for each of\nthese grouping variables. A 2 test was used for\ncategorical data and an independent samples t\ntest for continuous data. Due to multiple com-\nparisons a two-tailed p value of less than 0.01 was\nconsidered significant for these analyses.\nIndependent factors associated with decisions to\nrequest investigations, escalate therapy, or request\ninvestigations and escalate medical therapy were\ndetermined for all patients with CD and UC sep-\narately by performing multivariate logistic regres-\nsion to control for all demographic, disease-related\nand psychological variables. Results of multivari-\nate logistic regression were expressed as odds\nratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nWe applied National Health Service (NHS) ref-\nerence costs from 2015 in order to calculate the\noverall cost of potentially unnecessary investiga-\ntions requested in patients with CD and UC\nwithout objective evidence of mucosal inflamma-\ntion (defined by FC <250 \u00b5g/g). We compared\nthe mean cost per patient referred for investiga-\ntion based on physician global assessment with\nthat of a hypothetical investigation requesting\npathway when radiology and endoscopy investi-\ngations were only deemed necessary in patients\nwith a FC  250 \u00b5g/g (Figure 1). In this hypo-\nthetical model, the cost of point-of-care FC anal-\nysis was applied to every patient who was referred\nfor investigation, but only the cost of investiga-\ntions performed in patients with evidence of\nmucosal inflammation after FC testing was\nincluded. An independent samples t test was\nused with a two-tailed p value less than 0.05 con-\nsidered significant for these analyses. The cost of\nmedication escalation was not included, due to\nthe uncertainty regarding length of treatment.\nResults\nIn total, 276 patients with IBD fulfilling our\ninclusion criteria consented to participate, had\ncomplete HBI or SCCAI data, and returned a FC\nsample for analysis within 7 days of their clinic\nCharacteristics of patients with IBD according\nto decision to request investigations\npatients in whom an investigation was requested\nself-reported a flare of disease activity, compared\nInvestigation requesting was associated with the\npresence of clinically active CD, defined by HBI\nof 5, but no other demographic, disease-related\nor psychological factors.

We were una-\nble to account for the influence of current\nglucocorticosteroid use on the decision to esca-\nlate medical therapy. Here, it is possible that\nappropriate escalation of medical therapy to ster-\noid-sparing agents in patients in glucocorticos-\nteroid-induced remission may have led to an\noverestimate of the proportion of patients\nexposed to potentially injudicious prescribing. In\naddition, although investigations included in this\nstudy were limited to those requested for the\nassessment of inflammatory disease activity, we\nacknowledge that 10% of patients with CD in\nour cohort had a stricturing disease phenotype,\nwhich may have affected symptom reporting and\nthus influenced clinical decision-making, inde-\npendent of inflammatory burden. The utility of\nFC in CD is debated, particularly in ileal disease\nfor which its use is cautioned by some30 but advo-\ncated by others.31\u00ad33 However, in sensitivity anal-\nysis when patients with CD and isolated ileal\ndisease were excluded, there remained no asso-\nciation between the presence of mucosal inflam-\nmation and clinician decisions to request\ninvestigations or escalate medical therapy, while\npatient self-reported flare remained associated\nwith both. The FC cutoff of 250 \u00b5g/g used to\ndefine the presence of mucosal inflammation in\nthis study may be contentious. Despite this, the\nvalue we used is supported by expert opinion22\nFinally, due to the length of time between\nrequesting and the date of investigation, any\nassociation between symptom reporting, mucosal\ninflammation as defined by FC, and endoscopy\nor radiology investigation outcomes could not be\nreliably determined.\nOur study highlights that the cost of potentially\nunnecessary investigations is high, and that the\nincorporation of point-of-care faecal biomarkers\nof intestinal inflammation into the decision-mak-\ning process may save money. However, these\nfindings also highlight that 36% of patients with\nIBD who were neither referred for investigation\nnor had their medical therapy escalated have evi-\ndence of ongoing mucosal inflammation. Our\nhypothetical pathway for investigation requesting\ndoes not address this group of patients, as it relies\non a physician's global assessment of disease\nactivity, which failed to identify these cases. That\nsaid, whether a `treat to target' approach, when\npatients with occult inflammation receive\nescalation of therapy, leads to better long-term\noutcomes is currently not fully established and is\nnot advocated by international guidance.34\u00ad37 In\naddition, roughly 50% of patients who initially\nconsented to participate in our study subse-\nquently failed to provide a stool sample for FC\nanalysis. The reluctance of a secondary care IBD\npopulation to provide routine faecal samples is\nlikely to have implications for the benefit of any\ndisease activity assessment pathway that incorpo-\nrates point-of-care FC, although assessment of\nthe feasibility of implementing any such pathway\nis beyond the scope of this study.\nThe sensitivity and specificity of both patient-\nreported symptoms and the combination of\nsymptoms included in the HBI at predicting\nmucosal inflammation in CD is poor.4,5 Despite\nthis, poor general wellbeing and abdominal pain\nwere associated with clinician decisions to esca-\nlate medical therapy, and a HBI score of 5 was\nassociated with investigation requesting in CD.\nAlthough, after adjusting for confounding varia-\nbles in multivariate analysis, any significant asso-\nciation between clinical disease activity and\nclinician decision-making was lost, these findings\nhighlight potential implications of a reliance on\npatient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in\ndisease activity assessment. This is of particular\nrelevance given that the use of PROMs as out-\ncome measures in clinical trials in CD has been\nadvocated by the US Food and Drug\nAdministration.38 Self-reported flare of disease\nactivity was the only factor that was consistently\nassociated with a decision to investigate or esca-\nlate medical treatment in patients with CD,\ndespite its poor positive and negative predictive\nvalues for predicting FC  250 \u00b5g/g, which were\nThere was no association between clinical deci-\nsion-making and mucosal inflammation in CD,\nthus highlighting the difficulties in assessing dis-\nease activity when this is based on patient-\nreported symptoms alone. Almost half of all\npatients with CD who underwent escalation of\nmedical treatment did not have evidence of\nmucosal inflammation, as defined by FC, which\nis of particular importance given the lack of effi-\ncacy of some of these drugs in patients with a\nlimited inflammatory burden.8 The use of point-\nof-care FC testing may, in this instance, aid deci-\nsion-making, improving the appropriateness of\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 11 \n16 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\nresource allocation, and reducing the risk of\nadverse events in these patients.\nIn UC, escalation of medical therapy was associ-\nated with the presence of mucosal inflammation\nand symptoms consistent with clinical disease\nactivity. This is likely to be due to the greater cor-\nrelation between symptoms and inflammation in\nUC, as has been described previously.4,5 Despite\nthis, 31% of patients who underwent escalation of\nmedical therapy did not have evidence of mucosal\ninflammation, as defined by FC, suggesting that\nclinical decision-making based solely on a physi-\ncian's global assessment may be associated with\nlimited effects in terms of disease outcomes, and\nan increased risk of medication-associated adverse\nevents. After multivariate logistic regression, self-\nreported flare of disease activity and lower mean\nHADS anxiety scores were associated with deci-\nsion to request investigations in UC, suggesting\nthat clinicians avoid investigations in anxious\npatients, rather than overinvestigating them.\nHere, the use of point-of-care FC testing may be\nuseful in reducing the number of unnecessary\n21 tests were performed in patients with a FC\nIn summary, self-reported flare was the most con-\nsistent factor associated with clinician decision-\nmaking in CD, and investigation requesting in\nUC. The presence of mucosal inflammation, as\ndefined by FC  250 \u00b5g/g, was not associated with\nthe decision to request investigations in either CD\nor UC, nor was it associated with escalation of\nmedical therapy in CD. Escalation of medical\ntherapy in UC was associated with the presence\nof mucosal inflammation and raised clinical dis-\nease activity indices. Almost 60% of investiga-\ntions requested for disease activity assessment on\nthe basis of a physician's global assessment could\nhave been avoided. The introduction of routine\npoint-of-care FC testing could, potentially,\nimprove the appropriateness of clinical decision-\nmaking, streamline resource allocation, reduce\nadverse events associated with injudicious use of\nmedications, and reduce costs.\n"
