This study aimed to\ninvestigate the protective effects of short-interval postconditioning and to determine the optimal\ninterval for reperfusion in an experimental rat model of intestinal ischaemia.\nMethods: Forty adult male Wistar rats were grouped as follows: sham (Sh), ischae-\nmia \u00fe reperfusion (IR), ischaemia \u00fe postconditioning for 5 seconds (PC5), ischae-\nmia \u00fe postconditioning for 10 seconds (PC10), and ischaemia \u00fe postconditioning for 20 seconds\ncycles of 10 seconds of ischaemia were performed. Blood glutathione reductase (GR) and\nglutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels were measured. Intestinal tissue damage was assessed\nhistopathologically.\nResults: GR levels were significantly higher in the PC5 group than in the IR group (37.7 \u00c6 9.0 vs.\n18.5 \u00c6 2.0 min/g Hb). GPx levels were significantly higher in the PC10 group than in the IR group\nConclusion: Short-interval postconditioning reduces reperfusion injury in the ischaemic bowel\nand the optimal interval for reperfusion is 5 seconds.

This can lead to\nintestinal ischaemia and ischaemic injury.1\nMoreover, some bowel surgeries, such as\nintestinal resection or transplantation, are\nperformed through occlusion of mesenteric\narteries for preventing bleeding.2 A decrease\nin blood flow to the bowel leads to hypoxia,\nand this causes elevated levels of oxygen-\nderived free radicals. After blood flow is\nrestorated in this ischaemic tissue, more\noxygen-derived free radicals are released.\nThese oxygen-derived free radicals cannot\nbe exterminated by enzymatic antioxidant\ndefense systems. This phenomeon is called\nreperfusion injury and this leads to further\ntissue injury.\nThe bowel is the most sensitive organ to\nischaemia\u00adreperfusion injury among the\nabdominal organs.3 Intestinal cells can be\neasily injured during the ischaemia\u00adreperfu-\nsion period and mucosal injury leads to an\nincrease in intestinal permeability and in\nsystemic bacterial translocation.4,5\nSeveral methods have been used to\ndecrease tissue ischaemia\u00adreperfusion injury.\nZhao et al.6 were the first authors to report\npostconditioning. This technique consists of\nperforming a few short periods of intermit-\ntent reperfusion applied just after an ischae-\nmic episode and before reperfusion occurs.\nThis method has been used in some clinics\nand animals models to decrease reperfusion\nThis study aimed to assess the preventive\neffects of short-interval PC (SIPC) and to\ndetermine the optimal intervals of reperfu-\nsion for PC in an experimental rat model of\nintestinal ischaemia (Figure 1).\nMaterial and methods\nThis study was performed in the\nExperimental Laboratory of Adnan\nMenderes University and was approved by\nthe Local Ethics Committee. Forty adult\nmale Wistar rats were used. The rats were\nrandomly divided into five groups as fol-\nlows: sham-operated (Sh, n \u00bc 8); ischae-\nmia \u00fe reperfusion (IR, n \u00bc 8), ischaemia \u00fe\npostconditioning for 5 seconds (PC5, n \u00bc 8),\nischaemia \u00fe postconditioning for 10 seconds\n(PC10, n \u00bc 8), and ischaemia \u00fe postcondi-\nBriefly, anaesthetisia was performed\nusing ketamine (50 mg/kg) and xylazine\n(3 mg/kg) injection intramusculary.

No arterial pulsation was\nobserved in the intestinal segments during\nthe ischaemic period.\nAfter the ischaemic period, in the IR\ngroup, the vessel clamp was opened for 45\nminutes. In the PC5 group, the vessel clamp\nwas opened for 5 seconds, and immediately\nafter this time, the artery was occluded by\nvessel clamp for 10 seconds. In the PC10\ngroup, the vessel clamp was opened for 10\nseconds, and immediately after this time, the\nartery was occluded by vessel clamp for 10\nseconds. In the PC20 group, the vessel clamp\nwas opened for 20 seconds, and immediately\nafter this time, the artery was occluded by\nvessel clamp for 10 seconds. In all of the PC\ngroups, the interval procedure was repeated\n10 times. When the procedure was finished,\n45 minutes of reperfusion was performed in\nall of the PC groups and in the IR group. In\nthe Sh group, no intervention was\nperformed.\nIntracardiac blood samples were\nobtained from all of the rats to determine\nblood glutathione reductase (GR) and gluta-\nthione peroxidase (GPx) levels immediately\nafter 45 minutes of reperfusion. All of the\nrats were sacrificed after blood and intestinal\nsamples were obtained for histopathological\nand biochemistrical evaluation.\nHistopathological analysis\nFor histopathological evaluation, tissue\ndamage in the experimental groups was\nevaluated using a six-level scoring system.10\nThis scoring system was as follows: degree 0,\nnormal; degree 1, mucosal injury and no\nnecrosis; degree 2, necrosis of villi and crypts\nare normal; degree 3, necrosis of villi and\ncrypts; degree 4, deeper muscular or full-\nthicknes mucosal necrosis; degree 5, full-\nthickness necrosis.\nStatistical analysis\nThe Mann\u00adWhitney U test was used for\nstatistical analyses.\nResults\nThe biochemical parameters and histo-\npathological scores in the study groups are\nshown in Table 1. The mean GR level in the\nPC5 group was similar to that in the Sh\ngroup. The mean GR level was significantly\nhigher in the PC5 group than in the IR\ngroup (P \u00bc 0.04). The mean GPx level in\nthe PC10 group was significantly higher\nthan that in the IR group (P \u00bc 0.02).\nHistopathological evaluation showed that\nthe mean histopathological score in the PC5\ngroup was lower than that in the IR group\nDiscussion\nOxygen-derived free radicals cause tissue\ndamage and their peak production occurs\nin the first few minutes after reperfusion.\nThe peak production of oxygen-derived\nfree radicals during this initial phase\nof reperfusion is the major factor of\nTable 1.

The model by\nZhao et al.6 includes several short reperfu-\nsion cycles immediately after ischaemia and\nbefore reperfusion. With this method, pre-\nventing the sudden increase in production of\nfree radicals in the ischaemic area during\nreperfusion is possible.\nReperfusion injury has two phases. The\nfirst phase is the early phase and the second\nis the late phase. The early phase is shortly\nafter reperfusion and continues for a few\nhours. The late phase continues longer and\nis associated with nonreversible tissue\ninjury. Ozkisacik et al.12,13 showed that\nSIPC prevented testicular damage in the\nshort and long term in a rat model of\ntesticular torsion. They performed 10\ncycles of reperfusion (5 seconds in the PC5\nseconds in the PC20 group) interspersed by\n10 cycles of ischaemia (10 seconds in all\ngroups) for SIPC. They found the the\noptimal reperfusion interval for PC was\n5 seconds to prevent ischaemia\u00adreperfusion\ninjury in their experimental model. They\nreported that SIPC led to a decreases and\nthen an immediate increase in reactive\noxygen species during the early phase and\ntissue injury. They also suggested that PC\nreduced late phase tissue injury via reduced\nneutrophil and macrophage deposition, and\nthereby reduced reperfusion injury. In our\nstudy, we found high GR and GPx levels in\nthe early phase of the reperfusion period in\nblood samples immediately after ischaemia.\nTherefore, this appears to be a preventive\neffect in the intestinal ischaemia\u00adreperfusion\nmodel.\nSome studies have evaluated the\npreventive effect of PC in bowel ischaemia\u00ad\nreperfusion injury. Rosero et al.14 investi-\ngated the optimal PC algorithm in a\nrat model of intestinal ischaemia.\nThey performed PC with five cycles of\neach cycle after a 60-minute ischaemic\nperiod. They found that ischaemic PC was\nnot able to minimize or prevent intestinal\ntissue injury in rats undergoing ischaemia\nand the reperfusion process. Nakamura\net al.15 also reported that short cycles of\nPC were not effective in preventing intestinal\ntissue injury in rats. In their study, they\nperformed 5 cycles of 30 seconds of reperfu-\nsion interspersed by 5 cycles of 30 seconds of\nischaemia. Based on these two studies, we\nconsidered that if the PC interval time was\nshorter than that in these studies it could\nprotect the bowel against reperfusion injury.\nIn the present study, the PC intervals (5, 10,\nand 20 seconds) were shorter than those in\nthe studies by Nakamura et al.15 and Rosero\net al.14 and SIPC was able to protect\nthe bowel against reperfusion injury.\nIn this study, we obtained beneficial results\nin the PC5 group, in which 10 cycles of\n5 seconds of reperfusion interspersed by\n10 cycles of 10 seconds of ischaemia was\nperformed for PC.\nGPx catalyzes the peroxidation of hydro-\ngen peroxide in the presence of reduced\nglutathione to form water and oxidized\nglutathione. Several studies have demon-\nstrated the protective effect of GPx and GR\nin ischaemia\u00adreperfusion injury in various\ntissues.16 In our intestinal ischaemia\u00adreper-\nfusion model, the mean level of GR in the\nPC5 group was significantly higher than that\nin the IR group. Moreover, comparison of\nGPx levels among the groups showed that\nthe mean GPx level was significantly higher\nin the PC10 group than in the IR group.\nTherefore, we concluded that tissue damage\nwas least with the reperfusion intervals of 5\nand 10 seconds for PC.\nIn the present study, intestinal tissue\ndamage was also assessed histopathologic-\nally. We found that among the study groups,\nintestinal damage was lowest in the PC5\ngroup. Therefore, the tissue-protective effect\nof PC was reduced with increasing reperfu-\nsion intervals of PC.\nThe present study shows that SIPC can\nminimize reperfusion injury in the intestinal\nischaemia\u00adreperfusion model in rats. This\ntechnique is easily applicable. The optimal\nreperfusion interval was 5 seconds because\nhigher blood GR levels and the lowest\nhistopathological grade were observed with\nthis reperfusion interval. We observed that\nas the reperfusion interval became pro-\nlonged, the tissue-protective effect of PC\nwas reduced in the present experimental\nmodel, which is similar to our previous\ntesticular torsion model in rats.12\nTherefore, intestinal damage could be\ndecreased by SIPC during the first phase of\nreperfusion. Further studies are required to\ninvestigate the long-term effects of SIPC and\nthe optimal reperfusion interval in intestinal\nischaemia\u00adreperfusion in rats.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
