Previous research has identified the ways in which\nwomen in abusive relationships attempt to establish auton-\nciated with intimate partner violence is one of passivity.\nVictims, who resist the abuse and seek out help from agen-\ncies, may face hurdles accessing services, as they do not\ncoincide with the notion of a \"typical victim.\" The intimate\npartner violence story should be retold from the perspective\nof the woman who talks and/or demonstrates strength and\nresistance in a situation labeled intimate partner violence.\nYet, when retelling the intimate partner violence story it is\nalso important to consider the multiple aspects of the wom-\nan's life. Though intimate partner violence results from the\nstructural inequalities between genders, gender oppression is\njust one form of oppression women experience. A woman's\nrace, gender, religion, ethnicity, and/or sexual orientation can\ninfluence the resistance strategies available to her. A wom-\nan's resistance strategies may also be affected if she is in the\nprocess of leaving her abuser or if she still is in a relationship\nwith him. The goal of this paper is to retell the intimate part-\nner violence story and identify structural reforms that are\nconsistent with the experience of intimate partner violence\nsurvivors.\nDynamics Underlying Intimate Partner\nViolence\nMore than 90% of individuals who experience intimate part-\nner violence are female, making it a gender-based crime\n(Roberts & Roberts, 2005). Even though intimate partner\nviolence is a gender-based crime, the dynamics of abusive\nrelationships differ from couple to couple. This is best cap-\ntured by the gender symmetry and asymmetry debate. Some\ncouples involve men and women who are both violent, but\nare not afraid of each other. Johnson (1995) calls this com-\nmon couple or situational couple violence, because it is an\nargument between equals that escalates into violence.\nCommon couple violence reflects gender symmetry in vio-\nlence because there are equal numbers of males and females\nwho physically assault their partner during an argument. This\ntype of violence in intimate relationships is typically found\nin large-scale national surveys on violence in relationships\nviolence may be a momentary response to a frustration, not a\ncontinuous systematic effort to control one's partner. Though\ncommon couple violence challenges the conception that\n1John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the Graduate Center, City\nUniversity of New York, NY, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nBrittany E.

For this reason, the current paper will focus\non male violence against female victims. In spite of the focus\nof this paper on male to female intimate partner violence,\nanyone can be a victim of intimate partner violence, regard-\nless of their gender and/or sexual orientation.\nMany women from shelter surveys report their partner\nengages in a \"campaign of terror\" and does not just commit\nisolated acts of violence. Johnson (1995) refers to this type of\nabuse as intimate terrorism, while Stark (2007) terms it coer-\ncive control, though both terms capture how patriarchy\nallows abusive males maintain power and control in relation-\nships. Coercive control goes beyond an argument between\nequals that escalates into a physical altercation. Coercive\ncontrol captures the immediate and the more all-encompass-\ning aspects of abusive behavior. Coercion focuses on the\npresent and includes physical violence and threats by the\nabuser. Coercion is used so that the abused partner engages\nin a particular action. Control is not limited to a single\nmoment in time and involves the continued deprivation and\nexploitation of the woman for her abuser's benefit. Taken\ntogether, Stark argues coercion and control interact to entrap\nthe woman in the abusive relationship.\nent terms, intimate terrorism and coercive control are about\nthe man's power and control over his intimate partner.\nThough physical violence is the focus on many intimate part-\nner violence surveys (e.g., Conflict Tactic Scale), physical\nviolence may only be used by an abuser on rare occasions or\nAbusive men can engage in a wide range of controlling\nbehaviors, without resorting to physical violence, to main-\ntain power over their partner and deprive their partner of cer-\ntain freedoms. These controlling behaviors include but are\nnot limited to intimidation, isolation, threats, constant super-\nvision, and manipulation.\nWomen in abusive relationships often report that their\npartner's controlling behavior is worse than the actual physi-\nabuser does not have to engage in physical violence because\nthe woman knows not to challenge him just by the way he\nlooks at her (Ferraro, 2006). Controlling behaviors can have\nthis sort of effect on the woman because control focuses on\nwhat her partner deprives her of as opposed to what he actu-\nally does against her when he engages in physical violence\nThe types of controlling behavior a woman experiences\ncan also be influenced by her race, socioeconomic status,\nimmigration status, and/or nationality (Bograd, 2005). For\ninstance, abusive men whose partner is an immigrant can use\nher unfamiliarity with the United States legal system as a\ncontrol tactic, so that he is not held criminally accountable\nfor his abusive behavior (Ferraro, 2006). He can threaten the\nwoman that she will be arrested if she calls the police or that\nthe police will not believe her. This tactic may not be as suc-\ncessful for an abusive man whose partner is familiar with the\ncriminal justice system or aware of mandatory arrest laws for\ndomestic violence. The woman's response to her partner's\nabuse is shaped by the controlling behaviors he is able to\nengage in against her, which can be based on her multiple\ninterconnected locations in the social structure. Nevertheless,\nabusive men are able to engage in this constellation of behav-\niors because of the structural inequalities between genders\nand other social systems in society that privilege men.\nmate terrorism by focusing on how the patriarchal nature of\nsociety allows abusive men to take part in these controlling\nbehaviors. The patriarchal nature of society gives men the\nability to monitor and control their partner's behavior\nbecause men are the advantaged gender compared with\nwomen (Anderson & Hill Collins, 2007; Dobash & Dobash,\njust have to resist physical violence; they may also have to\nresist the power and control their abusive partner maintains\nin the relationship.\nAutonomy and Resistance in Abusive\nRelationships\nStark (2007) argues that coercive control is the reaction some\nmen have to women's autonomy and resistance. Coercive\ncontrol gives the abuser power and subordinates the wom-\nan's position. When women are not autonomous or equal\npartners, men benefit because they are able to have authority\nin the home. Control develops to squash the woman's auton-\nomy. The woman's resistance may then be the catalyst for\nher partner's control. Therefore, to identify resistance strate-\ngies that are safe for the woman, one must keep in mind that\nthe woman's agency and resistance may fuel her abuser's\ncontrol.\nResearchers have called into question the view that\nwomen in abusive relationships are passive by highlighting\nthe help-seeking behaviors of these women (Gondolf &\nFisher, 1988; Hollenshead, Dai, Ragsdale, Massey, & Scott,\nfirst researchers to challenge the stereotypical image of pas-\nsivity and learned helplessness associated with abused\nwomen. Their survivor theory argues that women are not\npassive but actively seek out help while in an abusive rela-\ntionship. However, the institutions from which the woman\nseeks out help oftentimes do not meet her needs. The institu-\ntions that provide services are patriarchally structured and\ntherefore do not consider women's unique experiences\nnot impossible, for her to become autonomous and leave her\nabuser if the institutions designed to help her do not provide\nthe services intended (Gondolf & Fisher, 1988).\nGondolf and Fisher (1988) also directly challenge\nWalker's (1979) concept of learned helplessness. By charac-\nterizing women as intimate partner violence survivors, rather\nthan victims, Gondolf and Fisher highlight that women's\nfruitless attempts to end the relationship is a misguided\napproach. Instead, the survivor theory calls attention to the\ningenious ways women try to cope with escalating abuse.\nGondolf and Fisher's survivor theory laid the groundwork\nfor challenging Walker's cycle of violence and battered\nwomen syndrome to realistically consider the experiences of\nwomen in abusive relationships.\nAs researchers moved beyond the stereotypical view of\nabused women as helpless, the nuances of intimate partner\nviolence became clearer. Originally, Gondolf and Fisher\n(1988) focused on the help-seeking behaviors of women as\nthey experienced increasing violence. However, researchers\nbegan to notice that women in abusive relationships are also\nsubjected to a range of controlling behaviors (Dobash &\ninfluence of these controlling behaviors on the dynamics of\nintimate partner violence and the options available to women\nbecame apparent. As the woman's abusive partner controls\nmultiple aspects of her life and is not just violent during iso-\nlated incidents, she becomes entrapped. Therefore, research-\ners had to account for the ways in which women continue to\nresist their partner's ongoing control as opposed to solely\nresisting physical violence in isolated incidents.\nWomen in abusive relationships are able to retain a sense\nof self by entering into what Stark (2007) calls safety zones,\nwhich begin as concrete objects and move to abstract\nthoughts as the abusive partner's control becomes all encom-\npassing. Rajah (2007) expands on this idea of abstract safety\nzones by arguing women in abusive relationships may\nengage in covert resistant actions as opposed to overt actions.\nStark's abstract safety zones, which include storing away\npersonal objects or thinking about something else during an\nabusive incident, are examples of a covert action that occurs\nwithout the abusive partner knowing about it (Rajah, 2007).\nNevertheless, covert and overt resistance still allow the\nwoman to experience a sense of accomplishment. The\nwoman learns what covert and overt actions she can engage\nin based on the history of the relationship.\nOver time, many women in abusive relationships learn\nwhat their partner does and does not like. Women often use\ntheir partner's likes and dislikes to discern what will lead him\nto engage in abusive behavior (Ferraro, 2006). In turn,\nwomen can use this information to know how much they can\nwoman may openly challenge her abuser's behavior when\nshe believes he is in a good mood. However, the woman may\nbe more covert about her resistance if she believes the direct\nchallenge will further fuel her abuser's behavior. These find-\nings show how a woman's decision to resist and if she will\novertly resist is shaped not only by her partner's behavior but\nalso by the relationship's history.\nSimilar to controlling behaviors abusers engage in, resis-\ntance strategies and the resources that are available may dif-\nfer depending on the women's location in the social structure\n(Rajah, 2007). All of these characteristics (e.g., race, gender,\nsocial class, immigration status, and/or sexual orientation)\nare part of an integrated system of power in which one group\nis at an advantage compared with another group (Anderson\n& Hill Collins, 2007). In turn, the woman's position in the\nsocial structure may determine what resistance strategies are\navailable to her.\nFor instance, the same resources that are available to\nmiddle-class women may not be available to poor women.\nClass experiences may also be shaped by race. Though a\nmiddle-class woman who is resisting her abuser may be able\nto connect with more services, if she is African American it\nis possible she will continue to experience segregation and\nracism in spite of her middle-class status (Anderson & Hill\nCollins, 2007). The impact of class and race can be seen in\nthat abused African American women viewed themselves as\nstrong and saw their resistance as a source of empowerment.\nHowever, Richie found that African American women felt\nentrapped because of their gender, race, and social class.\nThough Potter and Richie researched African American\nwomen, Potter's sample was a mixture of working and\nmiddle-class women who were not incarcerated while\nRichie's sample was mostly poor African American incarcer-\nated women. The different findings between women of the\nsame race highlight that factors beyond race can impact the\nresistance strategies available to certain women, such as\nsocial class and/or prior criminal record.\nFor women of ethnic minorities, Sokoloff (2008) argues\nthat Western cultures tend to concentrate on what the Western\ncultures believe are the negative aspects of an ethnicity. Yet,\nYoshioka and Choi (2005) argue that we should look into the\nwoman's culture for ways to respond to intimate partner vio-\nlence. Many strengths of certain cultures are overlooked\nwhen in fact these strengths can be used by women as a resis-\ntance strategy (Sokoloff, 2008). As will be discussed, small\ncultural communities may be able to use shaming as a way to\nhold the abuser accountable. Though certain aspects of a cul-\nture may be a viable resistance strategy for some women, it\nmay be unavailable because of how the advantaged ethnicity\nor race has constructed a particular race or ethnicity.\nTherefore, to understand the resistance strategies avail-\nable to a woman, one must consider the intersectionality\nbetween race, class, gender, and/or ethnicity. It is important\nto remember that these four characteristics are not the only\nattributes of the woman that impact her experience. For\ninstance, the woman's sexual orientation or religion may also\nplay a role. As one considers the resistance strategies avail-\nable to a woman, it is important to keep in mind the systems\nof power that influence the options available to her.\nNonetheless, every woman will have her own resistance\nstrategies based on the controlling behaviors her partner does\n4 SAGE Open\nand does not engage in. Depending on the degrees of threat\nof physical violence in the relationship, some women may\nhave lower thresholds in which they achieve a sense of\naccomplishment (Rajah, 2007). Though strategies may differ\ndepending on her partner's abuse or her location in the social\nstructure, the end goal of every strategy remains the same.\nA woman's resistance of an abusive partner is meant to pro-\nvide her with a sense of autonomy, or accomplishment, in\nhopes of changing, or even leaving, the relationship. While,\nengage in these resistance strategies, Abraham (2005) pro-\nvides a framework for identifying the different strategies of\nresistance.\nResistance Strategies\nAbraham (2005) argues, similar to Gondolf and Fisher\n(1988), women engage in certain behaviors throughout abu-\nsive relationships to show they are not passive and/or help-\nless. While some of these behaviors may seem obvious, the\nidentification and availability of resistance strategies will\ndepend on the abuser's level of control, the women's indi-\nvidual characteristics and her position in the social structure.\nOne of the personal strategies to resist an abusive partner is\nhitting back (Abraham, 2005). However, hitting back can be\nvery dangerous because it is an overt form of resistance\nmay be able to physically overpower the woman when she\nphysically resists. Nevertheless, some women still engage in\nphysical resistance, which challenges the notion of passivity\nin intimate partner violence victims.\nWomen in abusive relationships may physically resist for\na multitude of reasons and it is therefore important to con-\nsider the underlying motivation. Johnson (2006) expanded\nhis framework to consider the context in which men and\nwomen use violence in relationships. Violent resistance is\nwhen the woman is physically violent but not controlling. A\nwoman may engage in violence, but it is usually in response\nto her abusive partner's intimate terrorism (Johnson, 2006).\nAccording to Johnson (2006) in a very small number of\ncases, called mutual violent control, both the man and woman\nare violent and controlling. Therefore, when a woman\nengages in physical resistance one must not only look at who\nthe aggressor is, but also consider who has the power and\ncontrol in the relationship. The woman's violent resistance\nmay be a response to her partner's coercive control or it may\nbe a part of her own violent and controlling behavior against\nher partner.\nAnother resistance strategy is when a woman contem-\nplates and/or attempts suicide. The woman may believe that\ndeath is the only way she can escape the abuse (Abraham,\nsuicide as a way to stop the abuse before they murder their\nabusive partner. Abraham (2005) argues suicide ideation\nby abused women represents the extreme isolation and\ndepression they experience. The ideation also highlights the\nloss of hope many women in abusive relationships undergo.\nSuicide may be the only form of resistance the woman is able\nto engage in because her partner controls everything else.\nThe only aspect of her life she may be able to control is\nwhether to take her own life or not.\nidentifies accessing formal and/or informal help as forms of\nresistance. These are outward resistance strategies because\nthe woman goes outside the relationship to assert her refusal\nto accept her abuser's behavior. Family and friends, both\ninformal sources of help, can then express their disapproval\nof the abuser's behavior. When family and friends intervene\non the woman's behalf, it is meant to show she has options\noutside of the relationship (Abraham, 2005). Nevertheless, it\nis important to keep in mind the abuser may use family and/\nor friends to further manipulate and control the woman,\nthereby limiting the help an abused woman can receive\nAgain, culture, race, religion, and ethnicity must be con-\nsidered because these social structures may influence the\ninformal sources of help available to the woman. Cultural or\nreligious communities can play an important role by sham-\ning the abusive male (Sokoloff, 2008). When the woman\nnotifies and involves the community, the community can\nbegin to hold him accountable. The batterer must change his\nabusive ways to be accepted back into the community, a pro-\ncess Braithwaite (1989) refers to as reintegrative shaming.\nThis may be more effective than imprisoning the abuser\nbecause reintegrative shaming has those who are important\nto the abuser holding him accountable. When family and\nfriends become aware of the abuse, they can challenge his\nabusive mentality while a period of incarceration may not\nallow for this ongoing process of accountability. If the family\nand/or friends are being used to further the abuse, the process\nof reintegration is then not available, further shaping the\nresistance strategies available to the woman.\nThe criminal justice system encompasses formal sources\nof help, such as the police and courts. Though there are man-\ndatory arrest laws for domestic violence and no-drop prose-\ncution that can be life-saving, formal sources of help can\ncreate impediments to women's resistance strategies\n(Menjivar & Salcido, 2002). The problematic response of the\ncriminal justice system to intimate partner violence has been\ndocumented and includes women's arrest for intimate part-\nner violence, failure to arrest the male abuser, dual arrest,\nlack of response from the police or the woman's own depor-\nMany of the South Asian women in Abraham's (2005) study\ndid not contact the police for help because of the possible\nrepercussions of involving the criminal justice system, like\nher own arrest or deportation if she is an immigrant. The\nwoman's fear can stem from a number of reasons such as her\nabuser's lies about the criminal justice system, her unfamil-\niarity with the system or her immigration status (Bui, 2004;\ngies (e.g., mandatory arrest, no-drop prosecution) that are\npromoted and relied on so heavily may be one of the least\nlikely ways a woman tries to resist her abusive partner.\nIt is not just immigrant women who are hesitant to involve\nthe criminal justice system when they experience intimate\npartner violence. Individuals of different races, ethnicities,\nsexual orientations, or classes who experience violence in\nrelationships, but who also diverge from the White middle-\nclass stereotypical abused woman, may have a difficult time\nresisting their abuser through formal sources (Bograd, 2005).\nFormal sources of help may deem these individuals unwor-\nthy of services or deny that intimate partner violence occurs\nin these populations (Dasgupta, 2005). Moreover, African\nAmericans and minority groups are critical of formal sources\nof help because of the institutional racism within the criminal\njustice system. Institutional racism is seen as a component of\nthe structure of society in which the institution is designed to\nadvantage some groups over others (Anderson & Hill\nCollins, 2007). In the criminal justice system, White indi-\nviduals are advantaged over minorities. Many abused women\nof color may not want to involve the criminal justice system,\nif they are involved in the movement against institutional\nracism.\nFurthermore, the incident-based focus of the criminal jus-\ntice system is misleading in cases of intimate partner vio-\nlence. The focus on incidents classifies individuals as either\nan offender or a victim without understanding the power and\ncontrol in the relationship or the social structural forces that\nperpetuate intimate partner violence (Ferraro, 2006).\nUnderstanding that a woman's violent assault may be the\nresult of the culmination of an abuser's threats, intimida-\ntions, and physical abuse presents a different picture from a\nfight between two equals that erupts into a physical alterca-\ntion (Johnson, 2006). Formal sources of help that focus on\nincidents do not capture the complexity of intimate partner\nviolence. Moving beyond isolated incidents may also allow\nfor the consideration of how multiple oppressions can impact\nthe woman. It is only by considering the ongoing nature of\ncontrol and how the social structure affects intimate partner\nviolence that one can understand how a woman resists over\nthe course of a relationship.\nResistance Strategies for Safety and\nSeparation\nSome women may not be able to separate from their abuser\nfor a multitude of reasons. She may be financially dependent\non her abuser or they may have children in common. For\nsome women, the end goal may be safety, not separation\n(Yoshioka & Choi, 2005). Therefore, the resistance strategies\nshe is able to engage in will be influenced by if she is able to\nleave her abusive partner. Though the resistance strategies a\nwoman engages in throughout the relationship in the name of\nsafety are important, there is another point in the relationship\nin which the woman's resistance plays a vital role.\nResistant acts can prepare the woman to separate from her\npartner or be used by the woman as she begins to end the\nrelationship. Separation, which encompasses when the\nwoman wants to end, is ending, and when she finally ends\nthe relationship, can be conceptualized as more of a process\nthan an event (DeKeseredy & Schwartz, 2009). When one\nconceptualizes separation as a continuum as opposed to a\nsingle moment in time, there are important implications for\nthe experiences of intimate partner violence survivors. A\ncontinuum of separation expands the resistance strategies a\nwoman can engage in. It acknowledges the multiple points in\ntime when the woman asserts her independence and resists\nher abusive partner as opposed to the incident-based model\nof the criminal justice system. A separation continuum more\naccurately represents the experience of intimate partner vio-\nlence survivors.\nAs the couple separates, the woman may engage in a\nrange of autonomous behaviors that directly challenge her\npartner's control. Some of these behaviors include finding a\nhome, getting a job, filing for custody of the children or\nobtaining a restraining order against her abuser. Each of\nthese behaviors may go against one part of the woman's life\nthe man has control over. They also will not occur at the\nexact same moment in time but will occur through a process\nof establishing independence. By viewing separation as a\ncontinuum, one can see the ongoing nature of separation.\nIt is clear that separation is an important juncture in abu-\nsive relationships. However, separation is a dangerous time\nfor abused women and their children because they are at an\nincreased risk of violence and femicide (Fleury, Sullivan, &\nration is a challenge to an abuser's control, he may increase\nhis abusive behaviors to regain the control he is losing over\nhis partner's behavior (Bancroft, 2002; Campbell, Glass,\nSharps, Laughon, & Bloom, 2007). As the woman resists and\ncontinues to assert her autonomy through the process of sep-\naration, each resistant act can increase the possibility of\nretaliatory violence by her abuser. It is always important to\nkeep in mind the potential dangers associated with resistance\nstrategies and how these dangers may be escalated during the\nprocess of separation. Nonetheless, it is this process of sepa-\nration that is critical when reframing and retelling the story\nof intimate partner violence.\nHow to Retell the Intimate Partner\nViolence Story\nHow should the stories of intimate partner violence survivors\nbe told so that they more accurately reflect the experience of\nwomen? Many scholars argue that we need to reconceptual-\nize intimate partner violence to include an increased focus on\ncontrolling behaviors and move beyond isolated acts of\n6 SAGE Open\n2007). Yet, reconceptualizing intimate partner violence theo-\nretically in academia will not bring about the lasting changes\nthat impact intimate partner violence survivors. Public policy\nchanges need to be introduced to make survivors' lives safer.\nThe issue must be moved onto the policy agenda, with stories\nbeing just one way to do so (Stone, 2002). By retelling the\nstory from the women's perspectives of strength and auton-\nomy over the course of time, the story of intimate partner\nviolence that incorporates coercive control can get on the\npolicy agenda.\nPolletta (2009) argues the story associated with Walker's\n(1979) battered women syndrome and the one that dominates\nthe intimate partner violence field today is one of tragedy. It\ndoes not present the woman as a survivor, but as someone\nwho kills her abuser when victimization has taken over her\nargues for the rebirth story, in which the woman has a\nmoment when she realizes that she wants to live. The deci-\nsion to live leads the woman to engage in resistance strate-\ngies that begin to challenge her abuser's control and/or\nviolence. Researchers have identified the occurrence of this\nmoment for intimate partner violence victims and such\nevents have been given attention in the crisis intervention\nliterature (Campbell, Rose, Kub, & Nedd, 1998; Eisikovits,\nBy changing the story associated with intimate partner vio-\nlence from one of tragedy to one of rebirth, the focus shifts to\nwhat the woman does to assert her autonomy and resist her\nabuser.\nPolletta's (2009) version of the rebirth story focuses on a\nsinglemomentintime.SimilartoDeKeseredyandSchwartz's\n(2009) separation definition, it may be more appropriate for\nthe rebirth story to incorporate the process of separation and\nchange rather than focusing solely on an event. As noted,\nseparating from an abusive partner occurs over a period of\ntime and usually does not happen overnight. By highlighting\nthe moment the woman decides she wants to live without\nfear and/or leave and exploring the process that ensues, the\ndynamics of the abusive relationship become apparent. One\nwill be able to see how the woman's abusive partner contin-\nues to be controlling on separation and how she resists this\nbehavior to assert her autonomy.\nFor instance, on separation, an abuser may begin to use\nthe children or family members as tools to control the woman\nbegins using family and friends to manipulate the woman,\nshe will have to continue to challenge his control though they\nare no longer romantically involved. Throughout this process\nthe woman is asserting her autonomy, which is the basis of\nthe rebirth story. By expanding the rebirth story from a\nmoment to a process, one is able to see how an abusive part-\nner can continue to control the woman once she decides she\nwants to live a life without abuse.\nThe rebirth story has implications for women who use\nviolence in intimate relationships. Instead of focusing on the\nviolent incident, the rebirth story emphasizes the woman's\nstruggle against her partner's control. Polletta (2009) points\nout that by focusing on the woman's decision to live in a\nsingle moment, the audience is able to identify with her. By\nhaving the audience identify with the woman, it is hoped that\nshe will not be viewed as a violent aggressor even if she\nresorts to physical violence as a way to resist her abuser.\nInstead, the audience's identification with the woman is\nmeant to have them sympathize with her choices and recog-\nnize how her options were constrained because of the part-\nner's continued control during the process of separation.\nThough there is the possibility that some outsiders will iden-\ntify the woman as a violent aggressor if she engages in physi-\ncal violence, the rebirth story's focus on rationality is\ndesigned to have outsiders identify with the woman's limited\noptions.\nStrategies for Change Beyond Retelling\nthe Intimate Partner Violence Story\nNevertheless, the rebirth story does not fully capture the\ndynamics of intimate partner violence. By focusing on a sin-\ngle woman and how she escapes an abusive relationship, the\nrebirth story suggests it is up to the woman to escape the\nabusive relationship (Stark, 2009). Therefore, the story of\nstrength and resistance needs to incorporate the societal\nstructures that reinforce patriarchal norms and perpetuate\nintimate partner violence, moving toward an ecological\nmodel that considers how factors at different levels interact\nThe experience of intimate partner violence is not the\nsame for every survivor (Bograd, 2005). The rebirth story\nneeds to take into account the multiple forms of oppression\nmany intimate partner violence survivors experience. When\nthe woman is a part of disadvantaged group(s), advantaged\ngroups may not believe or identify with her rebirth story.\nThis has already occurred with the battered women syn-\ndrome, which created a separation between advantaged and\ndisadvantaged women. The battered women syndrome rein-\nforces notions of unrealistic passivity typically associated\nwith White middle-class women (Rothenberg, 2003).\nWomen who depart from this ideal of passivity are less\nlikely to successfully use the battered women's syndrome\nduring a trial. Thus, the battered women syndrome's focus\non White middle-class disadvantaged women who were not\nseen as conforming to notions of passivity and helplessness\nincorporate other oppressions in the woman's life that can\naffect her experience. For example, if the woman is African\nAmerican, she may have to overcome obstacles associated\nwith her race. It may be further complicated if she lives in\npoverty, which often overlaps with race (Sudbury, 2004).\nAll of these oppressions intersect so that the woman does\nnot experience gender oppression in isolation from these\nother oppressions.\nThough the rebirth story focuses on an individual woman,\nit is important to consider how structural forces impact the\nwoman's experience and the options available to her\nalso occur so that the focus is not just on changing the indi-\nvidual (Sokoloff, 2008). For instance, it has been argued that\nthe increase in women's poverty is partly due to globaliza-\ntion (Sudbury, 2004). One must consider the larger picture of\nhow globalization has moved jobs outside of the United\nStates, making it more difficult for women to have enough\nmoney to sustain a family on their own. While changing the\nstory associated with intimate partner violence is important,\nit will not provide women with jobs they need to support\ntheir children if they leave their abuser. The rebirth story can\nbring to light the social structural changes needed to improve\noptions for women attempting to end an abusive relationship\nby showing how individual women struggle. The story can\nthen argue that society must provide practical options to\nassist women who are trying to end abusive relationships and\nassert autonomy.\nCommunity accountability, or community-based responses,\nshould be incorporated in the rebirth story as a way to end\nviolence against women. The model involves not only the\ngovernment and criminal justice system, but also clergy,\nsocial service providers, media, and employers (National\nCenter on Domestic and Sexual Violence, n.d.). It may be a\nviable response to intimate partner violence, especially for\nthose groups that do not want to rely solely on the criminal\njustice system. Instead of focusing on criminalization and\nincarceration, the community accountability model has com-\nmunities work together to tackle the structural forces that\nperpetuate intimate partner violence and entrap women in\nViolence against women does not occur in a vacuum, but\noccurs in the context of a socially structured system of poli-\ntics, class, race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity. To combat\nviolence against women, Smith (2005) argues strategies\nmust be directed at not only gender inequality but also rac-\nism, class oppression, and the overreliance on prisons. If we\nonly address intimate partner violence without considering\nthe institutional racism in the criminal justice system, many\npeople will not get the help they need. Intimate partner vio-\nlence survivors' lack of faith in the criminal justice system\nfurther highlights that the movement must move beyond\ncriminalization. It is not to say that the criminalization of\nintimate partner violence and state policies have not saved\nthe lives of women. They have, but there are also many\nwomen who have suffered the adverse effects of these\npolicies.\nIf one considers the multiple oppressions women face, it\nbecomes evident that the resources available (e.g., domestic\nviolence services, formal sources of help) are not appropriate\nanswer is not to make these programs culturally competent\nbut to have actual women who have experienced intimate\npartner violence to be a part of the movement to \"end (italics\nin original) violence against women of color\" (p. 418). The\nmovement to combat intimate partner violence should also\nwork in tandem with the movement to end state violence\nHow can a movement possibly address both intimate part-\nner violence and state violence? Smith (2005) offers an array\nof strategies, but notes that advocates should focus on ending\nviolence against women, not providing programs. Though\nculturally competent programs are an important part of ser-\nvices, services address the violence once it has already\noccurred (Sokoloff, 2008). Again, it is vital that the move-\nment addresses the structural conditions, such as patriarchal\ninstitutions and the capitalist economy, that perpetuate vio-\nlence against women and entrap women in abusive relation-\nships (Ferraro, 2006). This is because intimate partner\nviolence is not a single issue but a part of larger issues affect-\nMoreover, the criminalization of intimate partner vio-\nlence diverts community's attention away from creating\nways to respond to the violence that occurs in the community\n(Incite!, 2005). \"Tough on crime\" policies do not allow for\nthe development of community responses that could effec-\ntively hold abusive men accountable. Instead, \"tough on\ncrime\" policies focus on the retributive aspect of punishment\nas opposed to the rehabilitation aspect. Community account-\nability models and the rebirth story can begin to question\npatriarchal norms that are also deconstructed in batterer\nintervention programs (Bancroft, 2002). Community-based\nprograms should not only involve the criminal justice sys-\ntem, but should involve men holding abusive men in the\ncommunity accountable (DeKeseredy & Schwartz, 2009;\nOpportunity theory, and the policy implications associ-\nated with it, has been applied to a number of criminal justice\nproblems (Clarke, 1997). Yet, it has not been systematically\napplied to intimate partner violence research, though the iso-\nlation process fits within the routine activity framework,\nwhere the offender converges in space and time with suitable\ntarget in the absence of a capable guardian (Cohen & Felson,\nvictim decreases risk to the offender by limiting capable\nguardianship and surveillance (Clarke, 1997). Creating prac-\ntical solutions that increase risk and decrease rewards by\nimplementing guardianship may be a starting point for\ndesigning effective intimate partner violence policies.\nAnother way to reframe intimate partner violence, as part\nof the rebirth story, is by challenging some of the commonly\nused words in the field. Many women who are abused by\ntheir partner do not want to be labeled or do not see them-\nselves as a battered women or victim (Ferraro, 2006). In line\nwith Gondolf and Fisher (1988), it would be better to find\nmore appropriate terms, like survivors. The term survivor\n8 SAGE Open\nmore accurately represents their experience and does not\nhave the negative connotations associated with the \"passive\nvictim.\"\nIndividuals working with intimate partner violence survi-\nvors must adopt new terminologies. Smith (2005) calls atten-\ntion to the fact many individuals who work in domestic\nviolence programs see the women as \"clients.\" Advocates\nand service providers should see these women not only as\nsurvivors, but also as potential activists and organizers\nnature of the domestic violence movement, Incite! (2005)\nargues social justice movements will be able to work together\nto develop communities. By developing communities, we\ncan move from an individualized approach to combating\nintimate partner violence to one in which men are held\naccountable by the community (DeKeseredy & Schwartz,\nPresently used terms, like domestic violence and physical\nabuse, may not reflect the lived experience of many intimate\npartner violence survivors whose partner is controlling. In\naddition, separation abuse can be a large part of the woman's\nexperience long after the couple is no longer together.\nTherefore, the term domestic violence is misleading in these\ncircumstances because the couple is no longer cohabitating.\nDomestic violence can also refer to violence between indi-\nviduals who live in the same household, such as brothers and\nsisters or parents and children. Intimate partner violence may\nbe a more appropriate term to use to reflect violence that\noccurs between intimates, either during a relationship or\nafter the couple has separated.\nConclusion\nWomen in abusive relationships resist their batterer in a\nnumber of ways. However, the story associated with intimate\npartner violence is one that often depicts the woman as a pas-\nsive and helpless victim. By retelling the story in a way that\nhighlights women's resistance and strength, changes can be\nmade in the response to intimate partner violence. By depict-\ning the rebirth story as a process in which the woman asserts\nher autonomy as her partner continues to control her, it is\nhoped she will no longer be seen as a woman seeking\nrevenge. Instead, her partner's control comes to the forefront\nand the woman's resistance to his behavior is highlighted.\nThe rebirth story will not be enough though and there is a\nneed to reform the social structures that oppress women.\nWomen do not solely experience gender inequality. The\noppression women experience because of their gender inter-\nsects with various other systems of oppression. It is crucial\nthat the intimate partner violence rebirth story accurately\nreflects the lived experiences of women and call attention to\nthe structural and cultural constraints of women in abusive\nrelationships.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAbraham, M.
