U.S. federal\nlaw establishes minimum criteria for legal purchase and\npossession of firearms; many states have laws\ndisqualifying additional categories for illegal possession.\nMethods We used data from a national survey of state\nprison inmates to calculate: 1) the proportion of offenders,\nincarcerated for crimes committed with firearms in 13\nstates with the least restrictive firearm purchase and\npossession laws, who would have been prohibited if their\nstates had stricter gun laws; and 2) the source of gun\nacquisition for offenders who were and were not legally\npermitted to purchase and possess firearms.\nResults Nearly three of ten gun offenders (73 of 253 or\n28.9%) were legal gun possessors but would have been\nprohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms when\ncommitting their most recent offense if their states had\nstricter prohibitions. Offenders who were already prohibited\nunder current law acquired their gun from a licensed dealer,\nwhere a background check is required, five times less often\nthan offenders who were not prohibited (3.9% vs. 19.9%;\nwere legally prohibited, acquired their gun from a supplier\nnot required to conduct a background check.\nConclusions Stricter gun ownership laws would have\nmade firearm possession illegal for many state prison\ninmates who used a gun to commit a crime.

In the USA, in 2008, gun violence resulted in\ntive injuries serious enough to warrant a hospital\nemergency room visit.1 Among high-income coun-\ntries, the USA is unique in its extraordinarily high\nrate of homicides. This disparity is most striking for\nhomicides committed with firearms where the US\nrate is 20 times higher than other high-income\ncountries.2\nDespite the magnitude of the problem, US gun\npolicy rarely considers appropriate criteria for\ndisqualifying someone from lawfully possessing\na firearm. Federal law disqualifies certain groups of\nhigh-risk individuals from owning guns, including\nfelons, fugitives, unlawful users of or those\naddicted to controlled substances, those who have\nbeen `adjudicated as a mental defective' or\ncommitted to a mental institution, individuals who\nhave been dishonourably discharged from the\narmed forces, persons subject to certain domestic\nviolence restraining orders, persons less than the\nage of 18 years (for handguns) and domestic\nviolence misdemeanants. Federal law does not set a\nminimum age requirement for the legal possession\nof long guns (ie, rifles and shotguns).3\nAlthough the federal firearm prohibitions apply\nminimum standards for all US states, many states\nhave enacted broader disqualifications for firearm\npossession including: a minimum age of 21 for all\nguns; convictions for some misdemeanour crimes\ninvolving violence, firearms or drugs; multiple\nconvictions for alcohol-related offences; or convic-\ntions for serious crimes committed as a juvenile.4\nResearch supports the underlying premise of\nlaws that widen exclusionary criteria for firearm\npossession: that some groups have higher rates of\ncriminal offending than do those without a crim-\ninal history or other indicia of risk.5e9 For example,\nWintemute and colleagues found that individuals\ndenied legal handgun purchase, as a result of a new\nCalifornia law expanding firearm prohibitions to\ninclude misdemeanants convicted of crimes of\nviolence, were less likely to commit a new crime of\nviolence than were demographically-matched Cali-\nfornian misdemeanants who had been approved for\nhandgun sales during the years just prior to the\nnew restrictions.9 A study of homicide offenders in\nIllinois found that 42% would have been prohibited\nfrom possessing firearms as a result of a prior felony\nconviction; however, convictions for misdemean-\nours as an adult or more serious crimes as a juvenile\nwere not reported.6\nUnder federal law, persons buying guns from\nlicensed gun dealers must undergo a criminal\nhistory background check.10 But federal law and\nthe law of most states do not require firearm sellers\nwho are not licensed gun dealers to verify that\npurchasers of firearms are legally qualified to\npossess a firearm such as through a background\ncheck.4 Understanding how those with and\nwithout a criminal history acquire guns can also\ninform policies intended to keep guns from\nprohibited persons.\nPrior research on firearm acquisition suggests\nthat incarcerated adults often obtain their guns\nfrom casual sources such as from friends and family\nmembers, and `off the street.'11e13 To our knowl-\nedge, whether and to what extent the source varies\nbased on the legal status of the purchaser has not\nbeen investigated.\nTherefore, the goals of the current study are to:\n(1) identify the proportion of state prison inmates\nCenter for Gun Policy and\nResearch, Johns Hopkins\nBloomberg School of Public\nHealth, Baltimore, Maryland,\nUSA\nCorrespondence to\nDr Katherine A Vittes, Center for\nGun Policy and Research, Johns\nHopkins Bloomberg School of\nBroadway, Baltimore, MD\nOriginal article\nCopyright Article author (or their employer) 2012.

To\nidentify states meeting these criteria, we consulted the Bureau of\nJustice Statistics 2004 Survey of State Procedures Related to\nFirearm Sales,19 supplemented by legal research to confirm some\nstate laws.\nBecause domestic violence misdemeanants are already\nprohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms under federal\nlaw,20e22 we included states with laws that prohibited domestic\nviolence misdemeanants if the states did not also prohibit other\nviolent misdemeanants from purchasing or possessing firearms.\nIn addition, although federal law restricts firearm purchase or\npossession for drug misusers, the law's definition of a drug\nmisuser does not provide objective criteria that can be imple-\nmented via a background check, limiting its practical use.23 We\nexcluded states with separate legal restrictions on possession of\nfirearms by those convicted of serious offences, not technically\nclassified as felonies, when committed by a juvenile.\nNine statesdArkansas, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, Missis-\nsippi, Montana, New Hampshire, Vermont and\nWyomingdlacked all five types of expanded firearm disqualifi-\ncations. Four additional statesdGeorgia, Maine, New Mexico\nand Wisconsindlacked these expanded disqualifications with\nsome exceptions. For example, New Mexico had a minimum age\nlaw stating that handgun possession is unlawful by persons\n<19-years-old24 and Wisconsin restricted individuals convicted\nof a felony as a juvenile only if the offence occurred on or after\nexceptions, because they were already prohibited from firearm\npurchase and possession under state law. The final sample\nconsisted of 13 states, though there were no inmates meeting\nour case definition in two states (New Hampshire, Wyoming;\nsee table 1).\nMeasures\nTo determine whether offenders had a firearm while committing\nthe crime for which they were currently incarcerated, SISCF\ninterviewers asked, `Did you use, carry or possess a weapon\nwhen the (.offense.) occurred?' If the answer was `yes,' the\ninterviewer asked, `What kind of weapon was it?' Offenders\nwho said they used a firearm were included in our analyses.\nOffenders who reported using a firearm in their current crime\nwere asked follow-up questions, including questions about the\ntype of gun(s) (eg, handgun, shotgun, rifle), how and where they\nobtained the gun, whether they fired it, and their reasons for\nhaving it.\nSISCF interviewers also asked the offenders a series of ques-\ntions about their prior arrests and convictions leading to\nprobation or incarceration. Those who had been convicted and\nsentenced to probation or incarceration were asked about the\ntype of offence, length of sentence, and whether they were\nsentenced as a juvenile or as an adult for up to 10 prior proba-\ntions and 10 prior incarcerations. Offence information for\njuvenile convictions leading to probation and no incarceration\nwas not collected in the SISCF.\nTo examine the potential for current and expanded disquali-\nfications to curtail gun crime, we categorised offenders into the\nfollowing groups based on their prior criminal convictions: (1)\nthose who would have no firearm disqualification even under\nstricter state laws (described below); (2) those who were\ndisqualified under current federal law; and (3) those who were\nlegal firearm possessors under current federal law, but who\nwould have been prohibited in states with stricter standards.\nWe further categorised offenders in the third groupdthose\nwho might be impacted if the laws in their states were\nchangeddbased on whether they fell into any of the following\ncategories: (1) age 18e20 years at incarceration for their current\noffence if that offence involved a handgun; (2) less than age\n21 years at incarceration for their current offence if that offence\ninvolved a long gun; (3) committed a prior serious crime as\na juvenile (<18-years-old); (4) conviction for a violent or fire-\narms-related misdemeanour; (5) convictions for two or more drug-\nrelated misdemeanours; and (6) convictions for two or more\nalcohol-related misdemeanours. These laws were chosen because\neach is in effect in at least some states.19 Violent and firearm-\nrelated misdemeanours included convictions for a simple assault\nor a weapons offence. Drug-related misdemeanours included\nconvictions for driving under the influence of drugs, possession\nor use of marijuana and unspecified drug-related offences (but\ndid not include drug-related offences involving heroin, powder\ncocaine or crack cocaine which are generally felonies). Alcohol-\nrelated misdemeanours included DUI/DWI convictions or\nconvictions for public drunkenness.\nAnalysis\nWe first calculated the proportion of offenders who would have\nbeen legally prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms if\ntheir states had a variety of stricter laws. We then examined the\nmethod and source of firearm acquisition for offenders and\ncalculated c2 statistics to identify any significant differences\nbetween offenders who were currently prohibited versus\noffenders who were not prohibited from purchasing and\npossessing firearms.\nOriginal article\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nRESULTS\n2046 of whom used a gun in the crime for which they were\nincarcerated. The distribution of the total sample of gun users\nwas similar to the 13 states in our sample with regard to crime\ntype, type of gun, sex, education, marital status and employ-\nment status. Our 13-state sample had a somewhat higher\nproportion of younger (age 14e17 years) and non-Hispanic\nBlack offenders than for all 50 states.\nSample characteristics\nOur initial sample consisted of 281 offenders who were incar-\ncerated for offences involving firearms from the 13 states with\nthe most lenient firearm restrictions (no stricter than existing\nfederal law). Due to missing or insufficiently specific informa-\ntion about the nature of the prior convictions, 28 offenders were\nexcluded from the analyses for a final sample of 253. The\nmajority of the respondents came from Georgia, Louisiana,\nMichigan, Mississippi and New Mexico. Some of the more\npopulous US states (eg, California, New York, Texas) were\nexcluded from our analysis because they did not meet our legal\ninclusion criteria.\nThree-quarters (n\u00bc190) of offenders committed their current\noffence (ie, the offence for which they were serving time when\nthe interview occurred) in their state of residence. All offenders\nwere sentenced as adults and age at sentencing for the current\nincarceration ranged from 14 to 55 years with a mean of\n25 years. A majority of the offenders were male subjects, non-\nHispanic Black, had not completed high school, were employed\nin the month before they were incarcerated and had never been\nmarried (table 1).\nCurrent offences\nMore than three-quarters (n\u00bc199) of the offenders were serving\ntime for a violent offence at the time of the SISCF interview. In\nall, 43% of these violent offenders were incarcerated for an\nattempted or completed murder, or voluntary non-vehicular\nmanslaughter (table 1). The remainder of the sample was\nincarcerated for property, drug or public order offences (all\ninvolving firearms).\nAlthough fewer than half (44.3%) of the offenders reported\nthat they fired a gun while committing the current crime, most\n(83.4%) identified one or more other or additional reasons for\npossessing the gun, including using the gun to scare the victim(s)\nLegal status for firearm possession prior to firearm offence\nleading to current incarceration\nInmates were categorised into three mutually-exclusive groups\nbased on their actual or potential legal status for firearm\npossession (table 2).

Most of this\nhave been prohibited if their state had a law that raised the\nminimum age to possess a handgun to 21 years. An additional 17\noffenders would have been prohibited if their state passed a law\nrestricting possession to all firearms, including long-guns, for\npersons <21 years. If persons convicted of a serious crime as\na juvenile were to become prohibited, it would have been illegal\nfor 13 offenders (5.1% of all firearm offenders) to purchase or\npossess a firearm. Nine offenders (3.6% of all firearm offenders)\nwould also have been disqualified if their states had prohibited\npersons convicted of a violent or firearms-related misdemeanour\nfrom purchasing or possessing a firearm. Two offenders would\nhave been prohibited if states were to restrict firearm purchase\nand possession for those with two or more drug-related misde-\nmeanours and one offender would be prohibited if the same\nrestriction were applied to alcohol-related misdemeanours.\nHow and where criminals obtained their firearms\nAbout eight of every 10 offenders reported using a handgun (vs\nrifle or shotgun) in the offence for which they were serving time.\nHalf of the offenders reported that they had bought the gun\nused in the crime (table 3). The second most common method of\ngun acquisitiondcited by fewer than one in five offendersdwas\nborrowing or holding the gun for someone. Regardless of how\nthey obtained the gun, friends and family members were the\nmost common source (34.0%), followed by drug dealers or other\nblack market sources (30.4%). Only 13.4% got the gun directly\nfrom a gun store or pawnshop where federal law requires\nprospective firearm purchasers to pass a background check. It is\nimportant to recognise, however, that table 3 represents only the\nmost recent acquisition of a specific gun: it does not indicate\nwhether the gun ever passed through a particular distribution\nchannel (eg, a gun show).\nThere were few differences between the groups of offenders\nwith regard to how and where they got the gun used in their\nmost recent offence. More than half (55.6%) of offenders for\nwhom firearm purchase and possession was legal under current\nstandards (adding the 45 inmates who would be legal even under\nstricter standards with the 39 inmates who would be prohibited\nonly under stricter standards) bought or traded for the gun used\nin their most recent crime compared with two-fifths (39.2%) of\noffenders who were prohibited under current state or federal law\npurchasing and possessing a gun under current law acquired\ntheir gun from a licensed dealer, where a background check\nwould be required, five times less often than offenders who were\nnearly all (96.1%) offenders who were legally prohibited from\npossessing a firearm acquired their gun from a supplier not\nrequired to conduct a background check.\nDISCUSSION\nOur findings indicate that 40% of offenders incarcerated for\ncommitting crimes with a gun in the 13 US states with the least\nstrict standards for legal firearm purchase and possession were in\npossession of the gun illegally. If these states had adopted more\nrestrictive standards like those in place in a number of other\nstates, an additional 29% of the persons incarcerated for\ncommitting a crime with a firearm would have been legally\nprohibited from possessing a firearm at the time of their current\noffence. The vast majority of these individualsdnearly a quarter\nof the entire sample of firearm offendersdwould have been\nprohibited if the minimum legal age for possessing any type of\nfirearm was 21 years. An additional 9.9% would have been\nlegally prohibited from firearm possession as a result of convic-\ntions for serious crimes as a juvenile or for misdemeanours\ninvolving violence, firearms, drugs or alcohol.\nNearly one in five offenders was <18-years-old at the time\nthey were sentenced for the current offence; 41.9% were less\nthan age 21 when sentenced. An even greater proportion would\nTable 2 Firearm prohibition status of state prison inmates incarcerated for offence committed with\nn (%)\nMay possess even under stricter standards 78 (30.8)\nPrior non-disqualifying misdemeanour convictions, and no convictions\nfor serious juvenile offence, and offender age $21 years\nPrior adult ($18 years) felony conviction(s) or dishonourable discharge 69 (27.3)\nOffender age <18 years at sentencing and used handgun in current offence 33 (13.0)\nWould be prohibited only under stricter standards* 73 (28.9)\nLong gun offender age 1e20 years at sentencing for current offence 17 (6.7)\nPrior conviction for serious juvenile offence 13 (5.1)\nPrior conviction for firearms or violent misdemeanour 9 (3.6)\nPrior conviction for 2+ drug misdemeanours 2 (0.8)\nPrior conviction for 2+ alcohol misdemeanours 1 (0.4)\n*These subcategories are not mutually exclusive.\nOriginal article\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nhave fallen into the <18 group if we had data on offenders' age\nat the time the offence occurred rather than age at incarceration.\nThese findings underscore the importance of minimum-age\nrestrictions for firearms possession and disqualifications for\nserious offences committed as juveniles, even if the duration of\nthese disqualifications is limited.\nIt is also important to consider the political feasibility of any\nnew restrictions on access to firearms. In a 1998 survey, a large\nmajority of respondentsdincluding the majority of gun\nownersdfavoured laws that would restrict guns from various\ncategories of misdemeanants including assault and battery\nwithout a lethal weapon or serious injury, driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol, and carrying a concealed weapon without\na permit.26 Although public support was strong for a variety of\nfirearm laws, firearm restrictions based on criminal history may\nbe among the most politically feasible.23 27 Each firearm policy\nconsidered in this study is currently law in at least some states.\nAlthough setting appropriate standards for legal firearm\nownership is important, it is equally important to make sure that\ndatabases used to screen gun purchasers and ascertain legal status\nfor gun possession are up-to-date so that prohibited individuals\ncan be identified. For example, juvenile convictions must be\nrecorded in an accessible database so that they are picked up in\nbackground checks in order for prohibitions for serious offences\ncommitted as a juvenile to be useful in restricting the legal\npurchase and possession of firearms in this high-risk group.\nRelatively few offenders purchased their guns directly from\nlicensed firearms dealers. Only 3.9% of individuals disqualified\nbased on current federal or state prohibitions and 3.8% who\nwere <21-years-old at the time of their incarceration obtained\ntheir gun from a licensed firearms dealer. Presumably most, if not\nall, of these prohibited individuals purchased their firearm prior\nto becoming a prohibited person. Among individuals who\nappeared to be legally qualified to purchase firearms, only one in\nfive (19.9%) obtained their firearm directly from a licensed\nfirearm dealer, perhaps to avoid having their firearms trans-\nactions recorded and therefore traceable to the purchaser. Given\noffenders' preferences for new firearms,13 28 it is noteworthy\nhow criminals avoid the regulated gun market of licensed sellers\nand prefer the largely unregulated market involving unlicensed\nsellers where new guns may be harder to obtain. The lack of\nregulation of firearm sales by unlicensed sellers is likely to\nsignificantly limit the government's ability to keep firearms\nfrom prohibited individuals.28 Requiring all gun sales to be\nsubject to a background check, and holding sellers accountable\nfor failure to do so, are policies that could address this problem.29\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to use data on gun\noffenders' age and criminal histories to examine the potential\nbenefits of strengthening the criteria for legal firearm possession.\nNonetheless, it is subject to several limitations. The data used in\nthis analysis come from inmates' self-report. As such, they share\nthe limitations inherent to all self-report data (eg, recall and\nsocial desirability bias). And although the data were drawn from\na nationally-representative survey of state prison inmates, they\nare not necessarily representative of state prison populations. In\naddition, the 13 states in our sample may not have the same\ndistribution of offenders as in all 50 states. For example, the five\nstates with the most offenders in our sample may be more\nurban, on average, than the USA as a whole. We chose states for\ninclusion in the sample based on their laws in 2004, the year the\nSISCF survey took place. These laws may be different from the\nlaws that were in effect at the time the offenders were convicted\nfor their prior offences, though it is rare for laws prohibiting\ncertain persons from owning guns, based on criminal history, to\nbe repealed. Moreover, we were unable to determine whether the\nguns used in the current crimes were obtained in the state in\nwhich the crime was committed. This is particularly relevant for\nconsidering criteria for firearm purchase rather than possession.\nThe numbers of offenders with prior misdemeanour convic-\ntions are likely undercounted because we did not have status\ninformation about juveniles sentenced to probation nor did we\nhave information about persons who were convicted but not\nsentenced to probation or incarceration (eg, those sentenced\nonly to pay a fine). It is also possible (though unlikely) that\nsome of the offenders with a prior felony had their gun rights\nreinstated. Finally, it is also important to remember that this is\na prison population. As such, our findings may not generalise to\noffenders who avoid imprisonment.\nHowever, our sample comes from a large national survey of\nstate prison inmates and contains extensive information on their\nprior criminal history. In addition, we have focused on the\npopulation that is most likely to be affected by the policy\nchanges we considered by including only offenders who used\na firearm in their current offence.\nTable 3 Source of gun used in current offence by state prison inmates incarcerated for offence committed with firearm in 13 states, by firearm\nprohibition status*\nLegal even under stricter\nProhibited under current\nWould be prohibited only\nunder stricter standards (n[73)\nN (%) n (%) n (%) n (%)\nHow gun was got\nWhere gun was got\n*If inmate used more than one gun in current offence, response pertains to the most recently acquired gun.\nyRespondents who refused to disclose how they got the gun were not subsequently asked where they got it.\nOriginal article\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nOur findings indicate that stricter gun ownership laws in\nstates with the lowest standards would have made firearm\npossession illegal for many who used a gun to commit a crime.\nWe are uncertain about the degree to which stricter legal stan-\ndards for firearm possession might deter criminal gun possession\nand use. But, adding barriers for the acquisition of guns by\nhigh-risk persons is an underused potential intervention.\nFunding This study was funded by a grant from The Joyce Foundation.
