    "reduced_content": "Socioeconomic status (SES) is a known risk factor for\ncardiovascular disease.1,2 However, unlike traditional\nFramingham risk factors, SES does not directly impact the\ncardiovascular system but exerts its cardiovascular effects via\na complex interaction of biobehavioral factors, such as\nexercise and diet (Figure). Because these mediating behav-\nioral factors are potentially modifiable, elucidating the path-\nways by which SES influences cardiovascular disease offers\nimportant opportunities for preventive interventions that may,\nin turn, help to address health disparities among social\ngroups.\nIt was toward this aim of understanding the role of\nmediating factors in the association between SES and hyper-\ntension that Brummett et al3 conducted a large cross-sectional\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Using path models,\nthey found that, in 14 299 \"nationally representative\" Amer-\nicans aged 24 to 35 years: (1) higher household income and\nbeing married were independently associated with lower\nsystolic blood pressure (SBP), whereas older age, male sex,\nblack ethnicity, higher body mass index (BMI), greater waist\ncircumference, smoking, and higher alcohol intake were\nindependently associated with higher SBP in multivariable\nmodeling; (2) higher household income was associated with\nlower SBP by way of lower resting heart rate (offsetting the\nSBP-raising effects of increased alcohol consumption) and\nremained inversely associated with SBP even after adjusting\nfor all measured covariates, and, in fact, each $50 000\nincrease was related to a decrease in SBP of 0.61 mm Hg; and\n(3) higher education level was similarly associated with lower\nSBP by way of lower BMI, smaller waist circumference, and\nlower resting heart rate, but was no longer significantly\nrelated to SBP after accounting for these indirect effects. The\nauthors concluded that increased BMI, particularly central\nobesity, and higher resting heart rate were important media-\ntors of the association between lower SES and higher SBP.\nThat obesity emerged as a chief link between lower\neducational status and higher SBP (Figure) in the study by\nBrummett et al3 may not be surprising at first glance\u00adthe\nassociation of lower SES with higher BMI and higher SBP\nhas been observed in other developed countries1,4 and has\nbeen attributed to lack of knowledge regarding dietary\nchoices, lack of access to healthy foods in lower SES areas,5\npoorer weight management skills, or differing social norms\nrelated to body size.6 However, the findings of Brummett et\nal3 are striking when one takes into account how young the\nAmerican National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health\nsample was (all in their 20s and early 30s): the majority\n(60%) of these young adults were prehypertensive (SBP\nobese (BMI 30 kg/m2).3 Furthermore, whereas the current\nresults were limited to cross-sectional data, longitudinal\nstudies have demonstrated that lower SES exerts long-term\neffects on both obesity7 and SBP.8 These data underscore the\nurgency to address the \"epidemic\" of obesity in the young,\nparticularly central obesity, which may be part of the meta-\nbolic syndrome, where focused efforts in the socially disad-\nvantaged may help to reduce the burden of hypertension and\naddress cardiovascular health disparities in later adulthood.\nHigher heart rate was identified by Brummett et al3 as\nanother important link between lower SES and higher SBP\n(Figure). Higher heart rate may be a surrogate measure of\nincreased psychosocial stress or reduced physical fitness. A\nhost of adverse psychosocial factors have been found to be\nincreased in lower SES groups, including hostility,9 depres-\nsion, and social isolation, and these stressors may lead to\nhigher resting heart rates and increased SBP via sympathetic\noveractivity. Although psychosocial factors were not directly\nmeasured in the current study, the \"protective\" effect of being\nmarried suggested a role for social support, and previous\nstudies have shown that perceived stress and depression were\nsignificant mediators of the association between lower SES\nand increased SBP.4 The significance of these findings lies in\nthe potential for preventive interventions, such as promoting\nhealthy stress coping skills and regular aerobic exercise.\nTaken together, it is tempting to oversimplify the associa-\ntion between SES and SBP as such: socially disadvantaged\nindividuals face job and neighborhood stressors, which,\ncoupled with lack of knowledge and limited resources, drive\nthese individuals to low-cost, high-calorie fast food options,\nresulting in obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and hyperten-\nsion; chronic ill health may then limit job opportunities,\ncreating even more stress and perpetuating the vicious cycle.\nThe association may not, however, be that straightforward for\nthe following reasons. Firstly, the SES-obesity-SBP link can\nchange in its direction of association\u00adin undeveloped or\ndeveloping countries, BMI increases with higher SES and\ncontributes to a direct association between higher SES and\nThe opinions expressed in this editorial are not necessarily those of the\neditors or of the American Heart Association.\nFrom the National University Health System, Singapore.\nCorrespondence to  , National University Health\nE-mail carolyn_lam@nuhs.edu.sg\nHypertension is available at http://hyper.ahajournals.org\nhigher SBP.1 Obesity is not, therefore, an inevitable conse-\nquence of social deprivation, and much depends on the state\nof development of the country. Second, variations in SES\nmay have different effects depending on sex and ethnicity.\nThe relationship between lower SES and higher SBP is\nstronger in women than in men.1 Among women alone,\nSES-SBP inverse associations are stronger in black Ameri-\ncans than in Mexican Americans.10 Third, even if SES\ndisparities were eliminated among sexes and ethnicities, the\nprevalence of hypertension would still be greater in black\nthan in white Americans,2,10 suggesting inherent genetic\npredisposition or other unmeasured explanatory factors.\nSome of these unmeasured factors are sodium and potassium\nintake, psychosocial stress factors not captured by heart rate,\nstress coping mechanisms, and complex neighborhood-\nspecific social effects not reflected in education level or\nhousehold income (Figure).\nIt is intriguing that income, but not education, retained an\nindependent effect on SBP after adjusting for all measured\nmore was related to having a 0.6-mm Hg lower SBP. As a\nmeasure of SES, education has the advantages of being\nreliably recalled and unaffected by later adult health so that\nreverse causality is less of an issue (poor adult health cannot\nchange previous educational attainment in healthy adoles-\ncence). Income, on the other hand, may be affected by adult\nhealth in that poor health may lead to lower income and vice\nversa (problem of reverse causality). Conversely, higher\nincome may reflect not only greater occupational earning and\npurchasing power but may incorporate more proxy effects of\nbetter SES and better overall health, explaining how earning\nmore may buy a lower SBP or, perhaps, how a lower SBP can\nbuy greater earnings.\nLow SES should be recognized as a potent risk factor for\nhypertension, even among young adults in the United States.\nAlthough SES, per se, is not regarded as a \"treatable\" risk\nfactor, its impact on blood pressure may be modified by better\nunderstanding of, and intervening on, its mediating mecha-\nnisms. The study by Brummett et al3 has contributed to this\nunderstanding, revealing obesity and increased heart rate (as\na measure of psychosocial stress or poor physical fitness, both\npotentially leading to increased sympathetic traffic to the\nheart and vasculature) as key modifiable correlates of lower\nSES and higher SBP. Given the cross-sectional nature of\nthese data, however, causality cannot be proven, and the\nimpact of losing weight or reducing heart rate (via better\nstress management or aerobic exercise) on SES-related dif-\nferences in SBP cannot be conclusively determined. None-\ntheless, the Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up Program\nhas demonstrated that intensive blood pressure control has the\ngreatest positive impact in hypertensive individuals of the\nlowest SES, attenuating the SES-related excess mortality in\nhypertension.11 Thus, regardless of mechanism for hyperten-\nsion, clinicians should be reminded that aggressive blood\npressure control is an available and effective means to\naddress social disparities in outcomes among hypertensive\nindividuals.\nSources of Funding\nC.S.P.L. is funded by the Clinician Scientist Award of the National\nMedical Research Council, Singapore.\nDisclosures\nNone.\nReferences\n1.
