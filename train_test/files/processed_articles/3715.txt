The evolutionary function of humor in mat-\ning, however, remains unresolved and several hypotheses have\nbeen offered (Kuhle, 2012). One hypothesis maintains that\nhumor functions primarily as an indicator of fitness because\nit relies on mechanisms underlying human intellectual and\ncreative ability (Bressler, Martin, & Balshine, 2006; Hone,\nhumor is used to communicate that a person is interested in\ninitiating or maintaining a romantic relationship, and it is used\nwhen a person is attracted to an individual and is not a cause of\nview claims that because humor encrypts a lot of background\ninformation, it can be used to assess the compatibility of indi-\nviduals (e.g., sharing values and cultural knowledge), a factor\nrelevant not just in romantic relationships but in all types of\nsocial bonding and collaboration (Curry & Dunbar, 2013;\nFlamson & Barrett, 2008). The present study tests these views\nby examining male and female preferences for humor produc-\ntion and receptivity in short-term and long-term partners, and\nhow these factors interact with physical attractiveness to deter-\nmine desirability.\nHumor as an Indicator of Genetic Quality\nused as a way of identifying mates with high-quality heritable\npsychological traits. This is because in this view, humor\nrequires intelligence, verbal skills, and the ability to creatively\ncombine linguistic symbols (Miller & Todd, 1998). Because\napproximately one third of human genes are expressed in the\nbrain, displays of humor offer a reliable indication of the\n1 Department of Psychology, California State University Long Beach, Long\nBeach, CA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nMichelle Tornquist, Department of Psychology, California State University\nEmail: tornquist.michelle@gmail.com\nEvolutionary Psychology\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nevp.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nquality of those genes (Miller, 2000). Humor can therefore be\nused in courtship as a hard-to-fake signal of heritable psycho-\nlogical fitness. In support of this claim, Howrigan and MacDo-\nnald (2008) found that general intelligence predicted ratings of\nhumor and did so independently of personality characteristics.\nIt is important to keep in mind, however, that the relationship\nbetween humor and intelligence is likely to depend on how\nthese concepts are defined, including the types of humor, as\nGalloway's (1994) review examining the connection between\nthese variables uncovered conflicting results.\nThe fitness indicator hypothesis also holds that humor pro-\nduction may be more important for female mating decisions\ngenerally choosier due to the greater minimal investment they\nmake in reproduction compared to men (Trivers, 1972). Men\nneed to advertise their physical and psychological traits to\nprove their worth to women, and women need to be capable\nof identifying high-quality men. In this view, then, men should\nbe the predominant displayers of humor and women should be\nthe predominant appreciators of humor.\nConsistent with the fitness indicator theory, studies carried\nout over the last decade have found that although both men and\nwomen value a sense of humor in a romantic partner, they mean\nvery different things (e.g., Bressler et al., 2006; Hone et al.,\nmen's abilities to produce jokes that make them laugh (i.e.,\nhumor producers), while men refer to women's tendencies to\nappreciate and laugh at the humor they produce (i.e., humor\nreceptivity). For example, Bressler, Martin, and Balshine\n(2006) showed that although humor receptivity was rated as\ndesirable by both genders, the ability to produce humor by a\npartner was rated more desirable by women than men. More-\nover, when the task required them to choose between a partner\nthat was high in humor production and low in humor receptiv-\nity or low in humor production and high in humor receptivity,\nwomen tended to choose the former and men the latter. These\ngender differences were particularly evident in the context of\ndating and long-term relationships but not one-night stands or\nshort-term relationships. Hone, Hurwitz, and Lieberman (2015)\nreplicated these findings, and using a trait purchasing task also\nshowed that for women humor production is a necessity, while\nhumor receptivity is a luxury. For men, the opposite is the case.\nWilbur and Campbell (2011) also tested the fitness indicator\nhypothesis by asking college students about what humor strat-\negy they would be more likely to use when getting to know a\nromantic partner. They found that men reported they would use\nhumor production, whereas women were more likely to report\nthat they would use humor evaluation strategies. In another\nstudy examining an online dating site, they found that men\nwere more likely to offer humor, while women were more\nlikely to make humor production requests. Moreover, women's\nratings of romantic interest were positively correlated with\ntheir humor production ratings of the men, but men's ratings\nwere unrelated to women's humor production. For women,\nratings of humor were also positively correlated with their rat-\nings of men's intelligence and warmth.\nHumor as Relationship Interest Indicator\nAnother account of the evolutionary function of humor in mat-\ning holds that it serves as a signal of relationship interest\nwhen a person (male or female) wants to initiate a romantic\nrelationship or is seeking to maintain an existing one. Depend-\ning on how the recipient of humor responds, the producer can\ndetermine whether the interest is reciprocal. If the recipient\nresponds with genuine laughter, for example, the producer will\nlikely infer desire in a relationship. On the other hand, if the\nrecipient does not laugh, the producer will likely infer that the\nperson is not interested in initiating a romantic relationship, or\ndoes not feel the same way about an existing relationship. By\nconveying this information implicitly, it allows individuals to\nsave face, as the costs of rejection are likely to be lower than if\nan explicit statement of interest is made. A key implication of\nthis view is that attraction precedes humor and is not the cause\nof it. Humor is produced when an individual is attracted to\nanother person, and if the recipient is attracted to the producer,\nthey respond positively.\nA set of experiments by Li et al. (2009) provided support for\nthis hypothesis. In one study, participants imagined interacting\nwith someone they were either attracted to or not attracted to.\nThey were asked to indicate how likely they would be to initi-\nate a general conversation and how likely they would be to\ninitiate humor. They found that men and women would be\nmuch more likely to initiate a conversation and to initiate\nhumor if they were attracted to the individual than if they were\nnot attracted. Moreover, if attracted, they reported being more\nlikely to initiate humor than a general conversation. Partici-\npants also reported being much more likely to respond posi-\ntively with laughter to the other person's humor if they were\nattracted to them. A second study also found that humorous\nstatements were rated as being funnier by men and women if\nthe participants believed that they came from a person that they\nwere attracted to and wanted a relationship with, a pattern that\nheld for both men and women. In a third study, Li et al. (2009)\nfound that third-party observers watching a mock ``speed dat-\ning'' session rated males using humor as being more interested\nin the female recipient than if they simply offered a general\nconversation. Moreover, females that responded positively to\nthe humor were much more likely to be rated as interested in\nthe male when he produced humor than females that responded\nnegatively to the humor.\nCowan and Little (2013) also found that physical attractive-\nness can increase the ratings of how funny a person is. In their\nstudy, participants were presented with audio clips on their own\nand as part of a video showing a person's face. The audio clips\nwere responses of the person in the video to a question asking\nthe person which two of three objects they would bring to a\ndesert island, and how they would use it. Participants had to\nrate how humorous the responses were. They found that for\nboth men and women, humor ratings for the attractive faces\nincreased relative to the audio-only condition, while for the less\nattractive faces, humor ratings decreased relative to the\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\naudio-only condition. In a follow-up study, they found that\nhumor used to answer the questions in males and females was\npositively correlated with perceived flirtatiousness, a finding\nconsistent with the interest indicator hypothesis.\nHumor as an Encryption of Compatibility\nAccording to the encryption hypothesis, humor functions as a\nreliable signal of shared common knowledge, values, prefer-\nences, and goals (Curry & Dunbar, 2013; Flamson & Barrett,\n2008). Identifying individuals similar in these respects is\nimportant because when people choose partners for cooperative\nventures, they have to choose those with whom they are com-\npatible. Humor can serve this purpose because although jokes\nare explicit statements, understanding and appreciating them\noften require possessing implicit knowledge, values, and atti-\ntudes. After all, not everyone understands the same jokes, and\neven if they do understand them, they may not find them funny.\nIn this view, then, people produce humor as a way of broad-\ncasting information about themselves, and monitoring the reac-\ntions of others indicates whether they share the background\nculture needed to appreciate that humor. In the context of mat-\ning, two individuals laughing at the same things can serve to\nindicate that they are culturally compatible and likely to be\nsuccessful in the joint venture of raising children and building\na life together. Consistent with this claim, Murstein and Brust\n(1985) found that couples with a similar sense of humor are\nlikelier to stay together. An important virtue of this hypothesis,\nhowever, is that it readily explains the role of humor in various\ncontexts outside of mating, including friendships and other\nlong-term partnerships where a shared vision is crucial.\nFlamson and Barrett (2008) provided evidence supporting\nthe encryption hypothesis. They examined whether prior famil-\niarity with the topics of jokes affects how funny people regard\nthem. In one experiment, they presented participants with jokes\nthat were either ``low encryption'' or ``high encryption'' by\nmanipulating whether or not information relevant to under-\nstanding the jokes was made explicit in the jokes themselves.\nThey also assessed whether or not participants had prior famil-\niarity with the topics. Their results were that participants found\njokes to be funnier when they had prior knowledge of the\ntopics, and those with prior knowledge preferred the highly\nencrypted, less explicit, versions of the jokes. In contrast, those\nwith less familiarity preferred the less encrypted versions. In a\nsecond experiment, the jokes were the same across conditions\nand what was manipulated was whether or not a preceding\nparagraph contained information that decrypted the joke by\nproviding relevant information. They found that those with\ngreater prior knowledge appreciated the jokes more than those\nwith less prior knowledge, and decrypting information\nincreased the appreciation of the jokes of those who were less\nfamiliar with the topics.\nMore recently, Curry and Dunbar (2013) have examined\nwhether similarity in appreciation of humor affects people's\nperceptions of whether they are likely to get along with others\nand whether humor is more effective in this regard than other\nindications of shared culture. Participants were presented with\neither a set of jokes or a set of first lines of novels. Those\nreceiving jokes had to indicate whether or not they thought\nthey were funny, and those receiving opening lines were asked\nto rate whether or not they liked them. Later on they were\npresented with the profile of another (fictional) individual who\nvaried in terms of how similar their judgments of the jokes\nwere to those of the participants, or how similar their judg-\nments of the opening lines were. Participants were asked sev-\neral questions to measure the degree of affiliation they perceive\nwith those individuals, including how well they would get\nalong with them, if they would like them, whether they would\nenjoy working with them, and whether they believe they have a\nlot in common. In addition to measures of affiliation, they were\nasked to rate the other person's intelligence, trustworthiness,\npopularity, and attractiveness.\nCurry and Dunbar (2013) found that as similarity\nincreased, so too did the affiliation scores. The type of stimu-\nlus did not seem to matter, as the same effects were produced\nby jokes and preferences for first lines of novels. They did\nfind, however, that similarity of humor predicted altruistic\nresponses. At the end of the study, participants were given\nthe option of sharing a portion of their compensation with the\nother individual, and they found that shared appreciation of\nhumor predicted degree of altruism, while shared appreciation\nof first lines did not. Also noteworthy was their finding that\nalthough similarity in humor and first-line preferences pre-\ndicted affiliation, it did not influence ratings of the person's\nother characteristics, including their attractiveness. The\neffects on affiliation were thus unique to cooperation and did\nnot influence overall the evaluations of others.\nCurrent Study\nThe current study presented undergraduate students with\nphotographs of opposite sex individuals that were either higher\nor lower in attractiveness, along with vignettes that described\ntheir humor production and receptivity as either high or low.\nFor each, they rated their desirability for short-term and long-\nterm relationships as well as rating their physical attractive-\nness. The design allowed us to test key predictions of the fitness\nindicator, interest indicator, and encryption hypotheses.\nThe fitness indicator hypothesis predicts that because humor\nis an indicator of good genes and (more proximally) of desir-\nable psychological qualities such as intelligence and creativity,\ndetecting the presence of humor should increase the desirability\nof both physically attractive and physically unattractive indi-\nviduals. Moreover, the hypothesis predicts that humor is impor-\ntant for both long-term and short-term mating, as in both\ncontexts, people would be attracted to qualities that can be\npassed onto offspring. Moreover, the hypothesis predicts that\nhumor production should be more important to females than\nmales as well as being more important to women than humor\nreceptivity. Finally, it predicts that humor receptivity should be\nmore important to men than humor production and more\nimportant to men than to women.\nTornquist and Chiappe 3\nThe interest indicator hypothesis predicts that humor, espe-\ncially humor production, should boost the desirability of indi-\nviduals more if they are higher in attractiveness than if they are\nlower in attractiveness. This is because the perception of humor\ndepends on whether an individual is already attracted to the\nperson. People should thus welcome humor more in the physi-\ncally attractive than in the less attractive. Moreover, the interest\nindicator hypothesis predicts that the effects of humor on desir-\nability should be equally robust in short-term and long-term\nmating contexts. This is because it holds that humor serves to\nindicate interest in both types of relationships, either to initiate\na relationship or to indicate interest in maintaining it. Finally,\nthe theory does not predict any sexually dimorphic patterns in\nterms of the effects of humor production or humor receptivity.\nIn this view, men and women use both humor production and\nhumor receptivity to indicate interest in a relationship.\nThe encryption hypothesis predicts that humor production\nand receptivity should both boost the desirability ratings of\nmen and women, as both offer a means of assessing the com-\npatibility of potential mates. In addition, the hypothesis pre-\ndicts that the effects of humor should be particularly pronounced\nin long-term mating. In the case of short-term mating, assess-\nments of compatibility are not likely to be relevant, because the\nindividuals do not foresee engaging in activities where a great\ndeal of cooperation and coordination are required. Finally, the\nencryption hypothesis predicts that the desirability of opposite\nsex individuals should be boosted by humor production and\nreceptivity, regardless of the level of physical attractiveness.\nDiscovering that someone makes you laugh and laughs at your\noffers of humor should increase feelings of affiliation toward\nthat person and does not depend on any preexisting attraction\nto the individual based on surface characteristics.\nThe present study also had participants rate the physical\nattractiveness of individuals in the photographs, in addition\nto short-term and long-term mating desirability. This was done\nto determine whether nonphysical characteristics such as\nhumor can influence judgments of physical attractiveness.\nAlthough many studies have shown that physical beauty influ-\nences perceptions of psychological and social traits (e.g.,\nDion, Berscheid, & Walster, 1972), little research has exam-\nined whether characteristics such as personality, humor, or\nintelligence can influence how physically attractive someone\nis judged to be (Swami, 2012). Because personality and other\npsychological characteristics influence the fitness value of a\nperson just as their physical traits do, it is possible that judg-\nments of beauty integrate both physical and nonphysical\ndimensions.\nIn one of the few studies examining the issue, Kniffin and\nWilson (2004) had participants rate the physical attractiveness\nof people in their yearbook, along with how familiar they were\nwith them, how likeable they were, and how much they\nrespected them. They also had strangers rate the photos for\nphysical attractiveness. As they were unfamiliar with the peo-\nple in the yearbook, the strangers made their judgments based\nsolely on physical characteristics. Using a stepwise regression\nprocedure, Kniffin and Wilson (2004) found that nonphysical\nfactors including liking and respecting explained variance in\nratings of physical attractiveness beyond what could be\nexplained by the strangers' ratings of physical attractiveness.\nMoreover, women's ratings of physical attractiveness were\nmore strongly influenced by nonphysical factors than were\nmen's ratings. For the latter, a greater proportion of the var-\niance in physical attractiveness ratings was explained by the\nratings of the strangers. This is consistent with previous find-\nings that men tend to emphasize women's ability to make a\nphysical investment in reproduction, while women emphasize a\nman's ability to provide resources for the raising of offspring\nBased on these considerations, the fitness indicator hypoth-\nesis predicts that participants' ratings of physical attractiveness\nwill be influenced by information regarding humor, with those\nportrayed as having a better sense of humor also being rated\nmore physically attractive. Moreover, it predicts that women's\nratings of male physical attractiveness should be more strongly\ninfluenced by the humor information than men's ratings, as\nwomen tend to weigh more heavily nonphysical characteristics\nin mate selection, especially during the nonovulatory phase of\ntheir cycle (Gangestad, Garver-Apgar, Simpson, & Cousins,\n2007). In contrast, the interest indicator hypothesis does not\npredict that physical attractiveness should be influenced by\ninformation regarding sense of humor. In this view, humor is\nnot the cause of attraction. Instead, humor is produced when\nattraction is already present. The encryption hypothesis also\ndoes not predict that information regarding humor will affect\njudgments of physical attractiveness. The reason for this is that\nas Curry and Dunbar (2013) state, the effect of humor is ``spe-\ncific to cooperation, and not the result of a more positive gen-\neral evaluation of the `other' person'' (p. 129). They failed to\nfind evidence, for example, that similarity of humor predicted\nevaluations of attractiveness of the other individual.\nMaterial and Method\nParticipants\nOne-hundred and thirteen undergraduate students (54 women\nand 59 men) from California State University, Long Beach\nparticipated. They were recruited from the Introductory Psy-\nchology subject pool and received course credit. A requirement\nfor inclusion was that students had to identify with a hetero-\nyears). Their self-reported ethnicity was 25% White, 33% His-\npanic Latino, 30% Asian, 4% Black African American, 4%\nNative Hawaiian Pacific Islander, and 6% other. Two women\nand two men were dropped for failing to complete all parts of\nthe experiment. The study was approved by California State\nUniversity, Long Beach's Institutional Review Board.\nMaterial\nHumor-style vignettes. To examine men's and women's humor\npreferences, we developed 24 vignettes (6 for each humor\n4 Evolutionary Psychology\ncondition, 2 adapted from Bressler et al., 2006). Each one,\npresented on a computer screen, described a unique scenario\nin which the participant was approached by a stranger of the\nopposite sex who initiated a friendly conversation with the\nparticipant. They described the strangers as varying in humor\nproduction and receptivity. In particular, they were described\nas being high in humor production and low in humor receptiv-\nity (HP/LR), high in humor production and high in humor\nreceptivity (HP/HR), low in humor production and high in\nhumor receptivity (LP/HR), or low in humor production and\nlow in humor receptivity (LP/LR). Sample vignettes are shown\nin Appendix A.\nFacial stimuli. Participants were shown 24 facial photographs of\nthe opposite sex (11 cm wide \u00c2 12 cm long), one photograph\nfor each vignette. Photographs were of individuals who varied\nin age, from approximately 20 to 30 years, as well as ethnic\nbackground. All photographs were of a person looking directly\ninto the camera with a neutral expression and against a white\nbackground. A total of 24 female and 24 male faces were\nselected based on their attractiveness. To obtain this set, 40\nmale and 40 female photographs were prerated for physical\nattractiveness using an 8-point Likert-type scale (1 \u00bc very\nunattractive, 8 \u00bc very attractive). Preratings were done by 23\nindividuals who did not take part in the main study (10 men and\n13 women). Each person rated opposite-sex photographs. From\nthe 80 photographs, 12 women rated higher in attractiveness\nness (M \u00bc 5.69, SD \u00bc 0.68) were selected, all receiving a mean\nrating of 5 or higher. In addition, 12 women rated lower in\nreceiving mean ratings of less than 4. The ratings of the higher\nattractiveness female photos did not differ significantly from\nThe ratings of the lower attractiveness females also did not\ndiffer from those of the lower attractiveness males, t(21) \u00bc\n1.67, p \u00bc .11. For females, however, the ratings of the more\nattractive group were higher than for the less attractive group,\ntive males were higher than those of the less attractive males,\nEach photo appeared in each of the four humor conditions,\nso that faces were not confounded with humor type. The photo-\ngraphs were retrieved from The Center for Vital Longevity\nFace Database (Minear & Park, 2004), from The Beautycheck\nWebsite (Gruendl, n.d.), and by asking people from outside the\nuniversity to take their photograph to use in a research study.\nDesirability ratings. Participants rated each photographed indi-\nvidual presented alongside a vignette for his or her desirability\nalong different dimensions, on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 \u00bc\nvery undesirable, 7 \u00bc very desirable). In particular, they had to\nrate ``how desirable is this person as a short-term partner?'' and\n``how desirable is this person as a long-term partner?'' Short-\nterm and long-term relationships were defined to ensure the\nsame understanding of these terms among the participants\n(short term: one-night stand, occasional dating; long term: boy-\nfriend or girlfriend, living together, marriage). In addition,\nparticipants had to rate ``how physically attractive is this indi-\nvidual?'' on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 \u00bc very unattractive,\n7 \u00bc very attractive).\nProcedure\nAfter reading and signing the consent form, participants com-\npleted a demographic survey that had them state their gender,\nethnicity, and age. Once completed, they were instructed that\nthey would have to view a number of photographs paired with a\nvignette (i.e., profiles) describing a hypothetical interaction\nbetween the participant and the individual in the photograph.\nIn line with the study conducted by Didonato, Bedminister, and\nMachel (2013), participants were told that during the experi-\nment they should imagine themselves as a single person who is\nwilling to meet people and who is available for dating. They\nwere also told that the potential partner in the vignettes\nshould be regarded as available and interested in the partici-\npant. This is because prior studies have shown that partici-\npants' relationship status (Lydon, Meana, Sepinwall,\nRichards, & Mayman, 1999) and the relationship status of\npotential partners (Koranyi, Gast, & Rothermund, 2013) may\ninfluence participants' judgements of partner desirability.\nThe participants were also instructed to listen carefully while\nthe experimenter read them the vignettes, which would also\nbe shown on the computer screen.\nFor each pair of photographs and vignettes, participants\nrated each individual for his or her desirability as a short-\nterm partner, long-term partner, and physical attractiveness,\nin that order. Each of the 24 trials consisted of a sequence of\nfour computer screens. On the first, participants saw the photo-\ngraph on the left-hand side, with the vignette on the right. After\nthe experimenters read the vignettes, participants could take\ntheir time to review them before pressing the space bar to see\nthe remaining screens. On the second, participants saw the\nphotograph along with the question asking them to rate desir-\nability as a short-term partner. The 7-point rating scale\nappeared below the question. The third and fourth screens were\nthe same except that they asked participants to rate the desir-\nability as a long-term partner and physical attractiveness,\nrespectively. Participants entered their ratings using the num-\nbers on the keyboard. They advanced to the next screen auto-\nmatically once they entered a number.\nAll participants were exposed to six profiles in each of the\nfour humor conditions (HP/LR, LP/HR, HP/HR, and LP/LR).\nHalf of the profiles in each humor condition had photographs of\nhigher attractiveness individuals and half had photographs of\nlower attractiveness individuals. Items were presented in a ran-\ndom order for each participant. The experiment took up to 1 hr\nto complete. Demographics, vignettes, photographs, and ques-\ntions were presented to participants on a stationary computer\nvia E-Prime 2.0 software (Psychology Software Tools, Pitts-\nburgh, PA, USA).\nTornquist and Chiappe 5\nResults\nIn what follows, we examine the effects of humor production,\nhumor receptivity, and physical attractiveness of photographs\non participants' ratings of partner desirability using a series of\n2 \u00c2 2 \u00c2 2 \u00c2 2 mixed factors analyses of variance (ANOVAs).\nIn these analyses, gender (male/female) is between subjects\nfactor and humor receptivity (high/low), humor production\n(high/low) and physical attractiveness (higher/lower) are the\nrepeated measures factors. Separate ANOVAs were carried out\non the ratings of long-term partner desirability, short-term part-\nner desirability, and physical attractiveness. All results are\nsummarized in Appendix B.\nLong-Term Partner Desirability\nThe analysis revealed a significant main effect of gender on\np\n\u00bc .04, with men giving higher long-term desirability ratings\nthan women.

Figure 1 illustrates these findings. For\nwomen, the results revealed a significant interaction between\np\n\u00bc .28. Simple effects tests revealed that, holding level\nof humor production constant, women rated men who were\nhigh producers more desirable long-term partners when they\nwere also high in humor receptivity (M \u00bc 3.92, SE \u00bc 0.17) than\nwhen they were low in humor receptivity (M \u00bc 3.13, SE \u00bc\np\n\u00bc .49.

These results\nsuggest that humor production is more important than recep-\ntivity for women, as being highly receptive to humor-only\nmatters if a man is also a high humor producer.\nIn contrast, for men rating the long-term mating desirability\nof women, the interaction between humor production and\np\n\u00bc .00.

The effect of humor receptivity, however,\nwas stronger for the more attractive individuals, as indicated by\nthe larger effect size. Humor receptivity therefore enhances the\ndesirability of individuals as long-term partners, especially if\nthey are more physically attractive.\nFigure 1.

Each error bar\nrepresents mean + standard error.\n8 Evolutionary Psychology\nvary in physical attractiveness. The goal was to assess the\nevolutionary function of humor in the context of mating, focus-\ning on whether it functions predominantly as an indicator of\nfitness, as an indicator of romantic interest, or as an encryption\nof compatibility.\nWith respect to the effects of humor on the desirability of\nlong-term mates, the results revealed that both humor produc-\ntion and humor receptivity were desired by men and women.\nConsistent with the fitness indicator hypothesis, however,\nhumor production had a stronger effect on women's ratings\nthan it did on males. According to this view, because males\nmake a smaller minimum investment in reproduction, they\nhave to display their traits to prove their worth to females, the\nhigh investing sex. The production of humor serves to indicate\ndesirable and heritable psychological characteristics including\nintelligence, creativity, and language ability (Miller, 2000).\nAlso consistent with the fitness indicator view, humor produc-\ntion in a prospective partner was more important to women\nthan was humor receptivity. This was evidenced by the fact\nthat humor receptivity only had an effect on women's ratings\nwhen the men were also high producers of humor. This is\nsimilar to Hone et al.'s (2015) finding that for women, humor\nproduction is a necessity, while humor receptivity is a luxury.\nEven though humor production was more important to\nwomen than receptivity to humor, we also found that receptiv-\nity had a stronger effect on women's ratings of long-term part-\nner desirability than on men's ratings, a finding that goes\nagainst the fitness indicator hypothesis. The fact that a man's\nreceptivity to humor is very important to women is consistent\nwith the encryption hypothesis. After all, failure to appreciate a\nwoman's humor may convey that the man does not share a\nwoman's values or cultural experiences and is therefore less\nlikely to be successful at engaging in cooperative ventures such\nas childrearing (Curry & Dunbar, 2013). Indeed, in conversa-\ntions, laughter has been found to be an indicator of agreement\nand affiliation with the person talking (Vettin & Todt, 2004).\nThere is nothing in the encryption view, however, that predicts\nthat women should value both production and receptivity to\nhumor more than men, as compatibility should be a concern\nto both. Nonetheless, this finding is consistent with previous\nresearch showing that women generally pay more attention to\nthe internal attributes of potential mates than do men (e.g.,\nIn addition to the humor conditions predicting long-term\nratings, we also found that physical attractiveness strongly pre-\ndicted desirability. Despite the importance of physical attrac-\ntiveness, we only found modest evidence supporting the\ninterest indicator hypothesis. The hypothesis holds that how\nhumor is perceived depends on whether there is an attraction\nbetween individuals (Li et al., 2009). People produce humor\nwhen they want to indicate they are interested in someone, and\nif the recipient is attracted to the person, they will respond more\npositively to the humor that is offered. As a result, humor\nshould boost long-term partner desirability when physical\nattractiveness is high but not when it is low. The only evidence\nconsistent with this hypothesis was a marginally significant\ninteraction between humor receptivity and attractiveness, with\nreceptivity boosting desirability of the physically attractive\nindividuals more than the less attractive. We did not, however,\nfind an interaction between humor production and physical\nattractiveness. Instead, humor production caused an increase\nin desirability of the lower and higher physically attractive\nindividuals equally, as predicted by the fitness indicator\nhypothesis and the encryption hypothesis.\nWith respect to short-term partner ratings, we found that the\neffects of physical attractiveness were even stronger than they\nwere for long-term partner ratings. This is similar to Buss and\nSchmitt (1993), who found that physical attractiveness was\nmore important for short-term mating than for long-term mat-\ning. In contrast, although humor production and receptivity\nboosted the desirability of potential partners, the effects of the\nhumor conditions were generally either smaller than for long-\nterm ratings or they disappeared altogether. For example, we\nfound that humor production was more important to women\nthan receptivity, as the latter only had an influence when pro-\nduction was high. This effect, however, was smaller than in the\ncase of long-term partner ratings. Furthermore, we did not find\ninteractions between production and gender, or receptivity and\ngender, in the case of short-term desirability. This is consistent\nthat sex differences in humor were present only in the case of\nlong-term relationships but not short-term relationships. Find-\ning stronger effects of the humor manipulations for long-term\nmating is inconsistent with the fitness indicator hypothesis, as it\npredicts that genetic factors should be important in both mating\ncontexts. The findings are also inconsistent with the interest\nindicator view, as it claims that humor is used to convey inter-\nest in both long-term and short-term mating contexts. The\nresults are consistent, however, with the encryption hypothesis,\nwhich predicts that issues of compatibility should be particu-\nlarly important in long-term relationships, as it is only therein\nthat cooperation on important tasks is likely to be an issue.\nFigure 4. Men's mean ratings of physical attractiveness for attractive\nand less attractive women as a function of humor production (high and\nlow) and humor receptivity (high and low). Each error bar represents\nmean + standard error.\nTornquist and Chiappe 9\nAn exception to the finding that effects of humor were more\npronounced for long-term partners than short-term partners is\nthe interaction between humor receptivity and attractiveness,\nwhich was only marginally significant in the former. Thus, the\nstrongest support for the interest indicator theory came in the\ncase of short-term mating, where the effect of humor receptiv-\nity on desirability ratings was evident only for the more attrac-\ntive individuals. We note, however, that the interest indicator\nhypothesis also predicts that humor production should boost\ndesirability of attractive individuals more than less attractive\nindividuals, and this result was not borne out in either long-\nterm or short-term contexts. This is the case despite the fact that\nhumor production on its own did cause an increase in desir-\nability in both contexts and did so particularly for females in\nthe case of long-term mating.\nAlthough several studies have examined the effect of humor\nproduction and receptivity on mate selection, ours is the first to\nexamine whether humor can also influence ratings of physical\nattractiveness. The question of whether judgments of physical\nattractiveness can be affected by nonphysical characteristics has\ngenerally been understudied (Kniffin & Wilson, 2004; Swami,\n2012). We found that both, high humor production and high\nhumor receptivity, can increase these ratings. Humor production,\nhowever, was particularly important for women's ratings of male\nphysical attractiveness, and humor receptivity boosted physical\nattractiveness ratings only when combined with high humor\nproduction. These results are most consistent with the fitness\nindicator hypothesis, as humor, which is linked to heritable psy-\nchological characteristics, caused an increase in desirability.\nFinding that humor can influence judgments of physical\nattractiveness is inconsistent with sequential models of mate\nselection and cue integration. According to Miller and Todd\n(1998), for example, cues important to mate selection are not\navailable simultaneously and require different amounts of time\nto assess. As a result, they cannot be integrated all at once to\ndetermine judgments of how desirable someone is as a prospec-\ntive mate. Instead, they argue that criteria are implemented\nsequentially, each with a certain threshold level to ascertain\nwhether to continue courtship or to terminate it. Physical attrac-\ntiveness is the first filter, which determines who one will\napproach. Only individuals who exceed some threshold for\nphysical attractiveness will be talked to. Other characteristics\nlike intelligence and personality are evaluated later on and\nrequire much more time to judge. Some factors will be assessed\nafter a conversation, including intelligence, while other person-\nality characteristics may require much more time.\nWhat our findings show is that such a model is too linear.\nThe information one finds out about an individual, including\ntheir sense of humor, can feed back on the original judgment of\nphysical attractiveness and either increase it or decrease it. We\nfound this to be particularly the case for women's ratings of\nmale physical attractiveness, though men's ratings were also\ninfluenced by humor. This is consistent with Kniffin and Wil-\nson's (2004) results showing that women's ratings of physical\nattractiveness of men that they knew were more likely to be\ninfluenced by nonphysical information including likeability\nthan were men's ratings of physical attractiveness. The latter's\nratings were more similar to the ratings of men who did not\nknow the women. In short, judgments of physical attractiveness\nencode not just information about a person's heritable physical\ncharacteristics, they also integrate information about a person's\nheritable psychological characteristics.\nTaken together, the present results provide the most support\nfor both the fitness indicator and encryption hypotheses. The\nfitness indicator hypothesis can explain the finding that high\nhumor production and receptivity caused an increase in the\ndesirability of long-term and short-term mates regardless of the\nphysical attractiveness of the individuals, and also why humor\nwas able to increase ratings of physical attractiveness. It can\nalso explain the finding that humor production was more\nimportant to women than it was to men. It cannot explain,\nhowever, the fact that receptivity was also more important to\nwomen than to men, and why generally humor had a stronger\neffect in long-term mating contexts than short-term mating\ncontexts. The encryption model, in addition to explaining why\nhumor production and receptivity can increase desirability of\nmates, can also explain why the humor conditions should have\na stronger influence in long-term mating contexts than short-\nterm mating contexts. It does not explain, however, why humor\nproduction and receptivity were more important to women, and\nwhy humor influenced judgments of physical attractiveness.\nIndeed, Curry and Dunbar (2013) found that although similar-\nity of humor influenced the ratings of affiliation, it did not\ninfluence the evaluations of other characteristics of individuals.\nThe view receiving the least support was the interest indicator\nhypothesis. It was only supported by finding that in the case of\nshort-term mating, humor receptivity had a stronger effect for\nwomen rating the more attractive male faces.\nTo conclude, our study suggests that the most important\nfunctions of humor may be to indicate the fitness of prospective\nmates and their compatibility in terms of shared goals, back-\nground knowledge, and values. In a more minor role, humor\nmay serve as an indicator of romantic interest. Given the com-\nplexity of humor, it is not surprising to see that it likely plays\nmultiple roles (Galloway, 1994). Of course, it is important to\nkeep in mind that our findings pertain only to the context of\nmating. Outside of this context, it is quite possible that humor's\nrole as an indicator of fitness may be minimized, while its role\nas an encrypted indicator of compatibility becomes even more\nimportant. After all, just because another person possesses\nmany great heritable characteristics, it does not follow that they\nwill be sufficiently compatible to make cooperation on long-\nterm projects feasible. Moreover, sex differences observed in\nthe context of mating may disappear altogether in other situa-\ntions such as same-sex friendships.\nAppendix A\nHumor Preferences Stimuli\nSample high in humor production/low in humor receptivity.
