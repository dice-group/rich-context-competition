    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe effect of seawall on the adjacent beaches and coastal dynamics has not been well documented in literature. The\npurpose and function of coastal structures, especially seawalls, have often been misunderstood, as in some cases, seawalls\nlead to coastal erosion, contrary to protecting the shoreline for which they are generally constructed. Seawalls have\nbeen reportedly causing changes in the near-shore process, specifically the sediment dynamics by affecting the onshore/\noffshore and, to some extent, the longshore sand transport. Therefore, it becomes imperative to understand the effect\nof seawalls on the adjoining beach to make sure more informed decisions are made on their installation. This article\ndiscusses the effects of seawall construction along the coast of Fansa, South Gujarat, India. A numerical model has\nbeen used to estimate the wave parameters along the selected coast, the results of which are subsequently utilized in\nan analytical model (parabolic shape model) to predict the end-wall effect. Independently, remote sensing datasets of\nCARTOSAT 1 with spatial resolution of 2.5\nm are used to understand the shoreline change dynamics in this region,\npost-construction of this seawall. It is found empirically that the net longshore sediment transport rate is approximately\n1.9Mm3 per year along the coast. The results of the analytical model predict a maximum landward erosion of about 20m\nand an alongshore erosion of 200m on the down-drift side of the seawall. These estimations agree with those obtained\nby the remote sensing\u00adbased analysis, which estimates an erosion of approximately 40m by the year 2014.\n",

The shoreline is constantly exposed\nto a wide range of erosional processes which are a cumu-\nlative effect of the various agents of denudation. Erosion\nis a naturally occurring phenomenon on the coast which\ncan be long term, short term or occasional and is attrib-\nuted to factors such as rise in sea level, loss of sediment\nsupply (regional changes), change in the wave character-\nistics and change in littoral drift by coastal structures\n(local changes). The direct consequences of shoreline ero-\nsion are mostly felt by the human beings inhabiting these\nregions, highlighting the need for shore stabilization\nstrategies. Hence, from the perspective of coastal erosion\nstudies, delineation of shoreline is a pertinent exercise to\nstudy the changes that have taken place over a wider tem-\nporal scale. In this regard, remote sensing (RS) and\nUnderstanding the effects of seawall\nconstruction using a combination of\nanalytical modelling and remote\nsensing techniques: Case study of\nFansa, Gujarat, India\nBalaji, R.1, Sathish Kumar, S1 and Ankita Misra1\n Keywords\nSeawall, flanking effect, down-drift, erosion, remote sensing\nDepartment of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology\nCorresponding author:\nBalaji Ramakrishnan, Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute\nEmail: rbalaji@iitb.ac.in; rbalaji@civil.iitb.ac.in\nOriginal Article\n154 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(3)\ngeographical information systems (GIS) can play an\nimportant role to provide valuable information with rea-\nsonable accuracy by analysing the differences in past and\npresent shoreline locations.\nIn India, several researchers have studied shoreline\nchanges using a combination of RS and GIS. Misra and\nBalaji (2015) studied the decadal shoreline changes along\nthe South Gujarat Coast. Murali et al. (2015) studied the\ndecadal changes in shoreline using Landsat and IRS P6\ndata for the coast of central Odisha, India. A monitoring of\nthe shoreline changes along the Gulf of Khambat from\nlysed the shoreline changes along the coast of Kanyakumari\nand Tuticorin using the digital shoreline analysis system\n(DSAS). Similarly, a number of studies have been carried\nout for various other coastal regions that highlight the\naccretion and erosion patterns of the coastline using tem-\nporal imagery (Choudhary et al., 2013; Kumar and\nIn most cases, RS-based studies evaluate the amount of\nerosion that has taken place in the various coastal areas\nover a given span of time. However, a comprehensive\napproach to coastal management often includes a proposal\nof solutions that helps to either prevent or stall further ero-\nsion of the shorelines. These solutions are broadly classi-\nfied as (1) hard stabilization, (2) soft stabilization and (3)\nretreat/relocation (Pilkey and Wright III, 1988). Hard stabi-\nlization refers to any permanent hard structures such as sea-\nwalls, detached breakwaters, groins and bulkheads (Kraus,\n1988) with a fixed location; soft stabilization refers to\nbeach replenishment (beach nourishments); and retreat/\nrelocation refers to the relocation of people from the place\nto allow for the natural process of recovery for the beach\n(Pilkey and Wright III, 1988). The traditional response to\nthe shoreline erosion problem is hard stabilization method\nwhich helps to manage and protect the upland property and\nstructures. However, in several cases, it has been observed\nthat these methods could result in adverse effects by accel-\nerating the shoreline changes. Several researchers have dis-\nthe potential effects of the shoreline-stabilizing hard struc-\ntures on beaches, and the beach degradation mechanisms\nare further classified as (1) placement loss, (2) passive ero-\nsion and (3) active erosion. The percentage of success of\nany permanent structure is highly variable depending on\nthe quality of design, coastal climate, storm history and\nother factors. Among the various types of structural\ndefences, seawalls are generally the most commonly used\nalternatives, especially in developing nations like India.\nSeawall and its influence on the beach\nSeawall is a parallel structure constructed along the coast-\nline to prevent any loss or inundation of the landward side\nby flooding and wave actions. Different types of seawalls\nare used depending on the site conditions, such as gravity\nwalls, rubble mound walls, stone revetment, stepped face,\ncurved face (concave), combination of stepped and curved\nface, and filled gravity.\nAlthough seawalls are a form of structural defence to\ncontrol shoreline erosion, however, in many cases, they\nare reported to aggravate the problem by causing either\nactive or passive erosion of the beach. According to\nJayappa et al. (2003), seawalls damage beaches more\nrapidly than groins. Several researchers have studied the\neffects of seawalls constructed along the various coastal\nmost of the literature, it is suggested that seawalls have\neither underperformed or failed in the protecting the\naffected coastline.\nBeach response\nSeawall constructed at a particular location along the\nshoreline alters the hydrodynamic conditions on interac-\ntion with the predominant waves. Such interactions influ-\nence the beach sediment transport that leads to change in\nmorphology (Griggs and Tait, 1988). Beach response is\nmajorly divided into two: (1) frontal effects and (2) end\neffects. Wave reflection and intensification of lateral long-\nshore currents causes removal of beach causing frontal\neffects (CERC, US Army, 1984). Furthermore, by prevent-\ning erosion, seawalls cut off the local sediment supply\nwhile waves that hit the wall are reflected downward,\nscouring the toe of the wall (Pilkey and Cooper, 2012)\nwhich is referred to as end effects. This study focuses\non the end-wall effect or flanking, that is, the erosion of\nthe unprotected beach adjacent to the end of the wall\nEnd scour/flanking\nEnd scour, commonly known as end-wall effect or flank-\ning at the down-drift end of the seawall, is recognised as\none of the negative effects associated with seawalls. It is\nthe additional erosion that takes place beyond the natural\none caused by the presence of a structure. Natural sandy\nbeaches between rocky headlands or man-made structures\nare exposed to a predominant direction of wave attack and\ntake the characteristic seaward-concave plan shape, result-\ning from erosion caused by refraction, diffraction and\nreflection of waves into the shadow zone behind the head-\nland/structure. The main aspect of such erosion is the\nresulting distinctive crescent or log spiral form. This shape\nhas been explored by some researchers and is frequently\nassociated with the development of headland bay (Hsu\nthe typical seawall with the length of Ls\nfacing a wave\nattack at the angle of  causing an erosion on the down-\ndrift side of the wall with cross-shore length of r and along\nshore length of S (McDougal et al., 1987; Tait and Griggs,\nIt is evident that hard structures can result in severe\nconsequences, thus, it becomes essential to understand the\nimpact of hard stabilization methods, particularly seawalls\non beaches, which forms the main objective of this article.\nIn this research, a combination of numerical modelling\n(Manek and Balaji, 2014) and analytical modelling is used\nto predict the end-wall effect which is validated with in-\nsitu measurements. Furthermore, the total longshore\nsediment transport rate per year along the selected coast is\nalso estimated, based on an established theoretical model.\nIndependently, high-resolution satellite datasets are used\nto study the shoreline changes that have taken place after\nthe seawall was constructed along the coastal region of\nFansa, Gujarat, India.\nStudy area\nThe study region (Figure 2) is located along the coastal\ndistrict of Valsad, Gujarat, which adjoins the Arabian Sea.\nA rubble-mound seawall with a total length of 900m was\nconstructed along this coastline in the year 2011 to protect\nthe shoreline against wave attack and subsequent erosion.\nData and methodology\nData collection\nThe flanking effect of seawall, along the coast of Fansa, is\nmeasured by tracing the high tide line (HTL) and low tide\nline (LTL) using a handheld global positioning system\nGPS (Trimble GeoXT). Figure 3 represents the typical\nview of the strategy followed to carry out beach profile in-\nsitu measurements in front of the seawall and also at the\nFigure 1.

The wave transformation study (Manek and\nBalaji, 2014) is conducted using STWAVE (Anderson and\nArmy Corps of Engineers. STWAVE is a steady-state\nfinite difference model based on the wave action balance\nequation that calculates wave spectra on a rectangular grid.\nThis wave transformation study helps to estimate the wave\nparameters between offshore and near-shore of the selected\ncoast, and the results obtained from this are further used in\nthe analytical model.\nAnalytical model \u00ad Parabolic shape model.Headland bay\nbeaches of varying sizes and shapes exist at the down-\ndrift side of protruding natural or man-made (seawall,\njetty, etc.) headlands. Since 1940, scientists are trying to\nestablish an empirical expression to fit part or whole of\nthe bay periphery. Parabolic shape model (Hsu and Evans,\n1989) is one such empirical model which represents the\nshape of the equilibrium very well on the down-drift side.\nThis model relates the shoreline changes to the tip of an\nup-drift headland or wave diffraction point, by virtue of\nwhich it is possible to assess the relocation of the up-drift\ncontrol by man-made structures (i.e. seawall and detached\nbreakwaters).\nThis parabolic relationship is used to check the stability\nof the crenulated-shaped bays, as this model performs\nfairly well in representing the static equilibrium plan form\nof the fully developed crenulated-shaped beaches. The\nadvantage of using parabolic model is that it is applicable\nin tidal seas and can represent the high- and low-tide coast-\nlines. However, the model is not capable of predicting the\nequilibrium plan form in the coastlines, which are close to\nthe tidal inlets due to the dynamical characteristics of sedi-\nment transport. In addition, this model cannot predict the\neffect of obstacles, such as islands, on the beach forma-\ntions that are located slightly away from the coastline.\nFigure 6 shows the definition sketch of the parameters\nassociated with parabolic shape model\nFigure 3.

The results of an earlier wave\ntransformation study (Manek and Balaji, 2014) were used to\narrive at the near-shore wave characteristics, such as breaker\nangle (b\n\n=\n3.5\u00b0) and breaking wave height (Hb\nBased on the in-situ measurements, the beach slope along\nwhich gives the breaker index value,  as 0.78. Based on\nthe constructed seawall, beach berm height above still water\nlevel (SWL; db\n\n=\nm) and depth of appreciable sand trans-\nport from SWL (dc\n=4m) are measured. From a simple sedi-\nment sample analysis, the porosity is estimated (n=0.4).\nBeach-shape assessment at end of seawall.The control\npoints are selected as (1) the seawall edge and (2) a point\nalong the coastline without any erosion protection struc-\nture along it. The shape of the beach now depends on the\nangle of the wave crest and the line joining the control\npoints. For this, the shoreline orientation is defined and\nthe predominant wave direction, as well as the wave char-\nacteristics, is obtained from the transformation studies, as\nexplained earlier. Using these data, the possible coastline\nrecession due to the constructed seawall is estimated.\nThe estimation is, then, cross verified with another ana-\nproposed for end effects of coastal structures.

Vectorization technique is\napplied to get the shoreline features of the years 2011,\nther used as an input to the DSAS tool to estimate the rate\nof shoreline changes, which is calculated based on meas-\nured differences between shoreline positions through time.\nThe DSAS tool basically estimates the net shoreline move-\nment (NSM) and end point rate (EPR) which are used to\nderive the output maps of this study. The NSM calculates\nthe distance between the oldest and the youngest shoreline\nfor each transect, and the EPR is obtained by dividing the\nNSM, by the number of years elapsed between the two\nshoreline positions. The linear extents with negative NSM\nor EPR values indicate erosion, whereas those with posi-\ntive values indicate accretion.\nResults and discussion\nAnalytical modelling\u00adbased analysis\nA maximum landward erosion of 20\nm and alongshore\ninfluence of the erosion of 200\nm (Figure 7) is estimated\nfrom the parabolic model, on the northern end of seawall,\nfor the first 1\nyear after completion of the construction.\nThis landward erosion may further extend up to another\nm by 2014 and may then eventually stabilize. A com-\nparison of the estimated landward erosion with the in-situ\nmeasurements conducted during the site visit is found to\nFigure 6.

Parabolic shape model\nestimation is cross verified with the beach-shape assess-\nment method using equations (2) and (3). From this beach-\nshape assessment method, change in adjacent shoreline at\nthe end of seawall is predicted to be around 23m which is\ncomparable with the parabolic shape model results.\nIt is understood from the earlier studies that the South\nGujarat coast experiences a high sediment transport of the\nSpecifically along the Valsad coast, the estimated south-\nerly and northerly sediment transports are 0.594 and\n0.98Mm3, respectively. It is clear from the numerical\nmodel estimates that the northerly sediment drift is more,\nand hence, the annual net sediment transport along the\nValsad coast is expected to be towards the north direction.\nIt is also reported that large monthly sediment transport is\ngenerally observed to be during southwest monsoon,\n1992). In this study, using CERC (US Army Corps of\nEngineers, 2002) equation, the estimated longshore sedi-\nalong Fansa coast providing evidence of end-wall effect on\nthe northern side.\nRS & GIS based analysis\nThe RS analysis is carried out independently to understand\nthe shoreline change dynamics of this region. In the satel-\nlite dataset of 2011, only an incomplete seawall is seen,\nwhich is observed to be completed in the satellite imagery\nof 2012. Based on the visual analysis, it can be seen in\nm of the shoreline,\nnorth of the seawall, for the year 2014, has completely\neroded due to the construction of the hard structure.\nMoreover, it is interesting to observe that from 2011 to\n2014, the landward erosion in the immediate vicinity of\nthe down-drift direction of the seawall is approximately\n40m, which is also predicted by the analytical model.\nFurthermore, a shoreline erosion analysis (Figure 9) is\ncarried out for the coastline along the northern side\napproximately 250m away from the end of the seawall to\nqualitatively and quantitatively understand the effects of\nthe installation. It is estimated that the average EPR is\napproximately about 0.417m/year and the average NSM\nAn important advantage of RS especially in this study\nis that it provides a snapshot of the temporal, as well as\nspatial, changes that take place over a period of time.\nHence, using CARTOSAT 1 imagery, it has been possible\nto understand the effect of the seawall in the adjoining\nregion post construction. Another important observation\nthat is witnessed in the satellite datasets (Figure 10) is that\nthe high sediment deposition in this region has caused a\ndecrease in the size of the river mouth in the 2014 image,\nresulting in the narrowing of the channel (encircled in red)\nthat allows the water to flow inland. As discussed in the\nprevious section, the longshore sediment transport in this\nregion is reportedly northward, and hence, the change in\nthe sediment transport dynamics due to the seawall con-\nstruction can be hypothesized to have some impact on the\nadjoining river mouth as can be seen clearly in the images.\nIn order to verify this observation, it is imperative to con-\nduct a thorough investigation with the help of numerical\nmodelling; however, this can be considered as a reasonable\nFigure 7. Comparison of measured and estimated parabolic\nshape view of end-wall effect.\nFigure 9. Shoreline change analysis.\ninference as no changes are seen in the year 2011 and\nFinally, it can be suggested that sediment mobilization,\nwave reflection causing sediment transport, refraction and\ndiffraction are some of the commonly cited processes\ninvolved in the seawall\u00adbeach interaction (Tait and Griggs,\n1991). Much of the end scour observed here is triggered\ndue to alongshore sediment transport caused by reflecting\nwaves in an alongshore direction, as well as refraction and\ndiffraction. In this study, the effects of seawall are seen in\nthe form of scouring, change in sediment dynamics and\nshoreline changes in the adjoining regions.\nConclusion\nIn the present times, there has been considerable change in\nthe approach to coastal management by virtue of the\nimprovement in the understanding and knowledge of\ncoastal dynamics and shoreline erosion. Very often, the\ndetrimental effects of seawall construction are overlooked\nin order to preserve the beach and to control the irrespon-\nsible shoreline development that takes place along it.\nIn this study, an effort has been made to understand the\neffects of seawall construction using a combination of\nnumerical and analytical modelling and geo-informatics. It\nis evident that the construction of seawall along the coast\nof Fansa has resulted in a landward erosion of about 20m\nin the down-drift direction of the seawall, within a year of\nconstruction. Based on a theoretical model, the beach is\nfurther predicted to erode by another 20m before attaining\nthe state of equilibrium by the year 2014. This estimation\nis successfully validated through an RS-based analysis, the\nresults of which confirm that the landward erosion from\nthe sea wall.\nAlthough the beach along the coast of Fansa is pre-\ndicted to have already stabilized, the construction of sea-\nwall has evidently caused some changes in the shoreline\nmorphology. It is important to understand that although the\nconstruction of hard structures allows for the protection of\nthe property by controlling the beach and bluff erosion,\nthis kind of fortification reduces the natural delivery of\nsand leading to detrimental effects in the down-drift coast\nbeaches. This study highlights the need to examine the\nseawall\u00adbeach interaction on a case-by-case basis, so that\na more informed decision can be made while installing a\nhard structure to control shoreline erosion.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAnderson ME and Smith JM (2014) Wave attenuation by flex-\nible, idealized salt marsh vegetation.
