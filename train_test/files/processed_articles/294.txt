Schwartz2\n1Northern California Cancer Center, Fremont, California and 2Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wake Forest University,\nWinston-Salem, North Carolina\n Introduction\nMounting experimental and epidemiologic evidence supports\nthe hypothesis that vitamin D reduces the risk of prostate\ncancer (1, 2). The major source of vitamin D is casual exposure\nto sunlight, which accounts for f90% of serum levels of\n25(OH)D, the main circulating metabolite of vitamin D (3). In\nthe United States, prostate cancer mortality rates are inversely\ncorrelated with solar radiation levels, with the highest rates\nfound in the Northeast (4, 5). Recently, several studies reported\ninverse associations with prostate cancer risk in relation to\nresidential sun exposure (6), self-reported sun exposure (7), a\nsun exposure index based on skin pigmentation measurements\n(8), serum levels of 25(OH)D (9, 10), and composite score based\non multiple predictors of serum levels of 25(OH)D (11).\nAdditionally, high residential sun exposure has been associ-\nated with significantly increased survival (12) and decreased\nmortality from prostate cancer (13).\nAlthough data are sparse, some evidence suggests that\nprostate cancer risk may be influenced by sun exposure early\nin life (6, 7). Most previous studies have focused on the effect\nof sun exposure during adulthood, and the effect of sun\nexposure in early life has been little explored. We examined\nthe effect of early-life versus adult sun exposure on prostate\ncancer risk in the First National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES I) Epidemiologic Follow-up\nStudy, a nationwide prospective study of men spanning a wide\nrange of residential sun exposure.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy Population. NHANES I was conducted from 1971 to\n1975 in a probability sample of the noninstitutionalized U.S.\nwere recontacted for follow-up interviews conducted in 1982\nEpidemiologic Follow-up Study (14). Baseline data were\nobtained through an in-person interview and a dermatologic\nexamination, including information on residential history and\nsun-induced skin damage. The first follow-up interview\nreported recreational and occupational sun exposure.\nor declined participation in follow-up. Information on various\nhealth outcomes, including prostate cancer, was collected\nthrough interviews with surviving individuals or proxy\nrespondents. A total of 249 men were identified who were\ndiagnosed with or died from prostate cancer during the\nfollow-up period. Of these, 52 were non-white and were\nexcluded in this analysis. The remaining 197 white prostate\ncancer cases included 73 self-reports only, 32 self-reports\nconfirmed by hospital records, 48 self-reports confirmed by\ndeath certificates, 19 identified through hospital records only,\nand 25 identified through death certificates. Analyses were\nwhite noncases for whom information on sun exposure was\navailable.\nStatistical Analysis. We examined prostate cancer risk in\nrelation to solar radiation in state of birth, as a proxy measure of\nearly-life sun exposure, and several measures of sun exposure\nin adulthood, including solar radiation in the state of longest\nresidence, and sun exposure assessed by self-report, physician\nreport, and dermatologic examination. Each U.S. state of\nresidence was assigned an average solar radiation level as\ndescribed elsewhere (15), and solar radiation in each state was\nclassified as low, medium, or high based on the approximate\nThe costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.\nThis article must therefore be hereby marked advertisement in accordance with 18 U.S.C.\nSection 1734 solely to indicate this fact.\nRequests for reprints: Esther M.

The first follow-up interview in 1982 to\n1984 collected information on self-reported recreational and\noccupational sun exposure rated as never, rare, occasional, or\nfrequent. In the dermatologic baseline examination, sun-\ninduced skin damage was rated as absent, minimal, moderate,\nor severe, and physician-assessed sun exposure was rated as\nunimpressive, moderate, or considerable. We used Cox\nproportional hazard regression modeling to estimate relative\nrisks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), adjusting for\nage only, because in a previous analysis of the NHANES I\nfollow-up data (6), we found no evidence of confounding by\nfamily history of prostate cancer, fat intake, or calcium intake.\nBecause the influence of vitamin D may be different on early-\nstage versus advanced disease, we did analyses for all prostate\ncancer cases combined and stratified analyses for nonfatal\nand fatal cases. For cases, person-years of follow-up were\nestimated from the year (midpoint of June 30) of the NHANES\nI interview to the year of prostate cancer incidence, defined as\nthe year of first hospital admission related to prostate cancer,\nthe year of the self-reported diagnosis for prostate cancers\nwithout hospital record confirmation, and the year of death\nfor prostate cancers confirmed by death certificate only. For\nmen without prostate cancer, the person-years of follow-up\nwere estimated from the year of the NHANES I interview to\nthe year of last interview, if alive, or to the year of death, if\ndeceased.\nResults\nAs reported previously (6), high residential sun exposure was\nassociated with reduced prostate cancer risk (Table 1). Lower\nrisks were found among men born in a state of high solar\nlongest residence was in a state of high solar radiation (RR,\nlife solar radiation remained after adjustment for adult solar\nfor both nonfatal and fatal prostate cancer. Conversely, the\ninverse association with solar radiation at the longest residence\nwas greatly weakened after adjustment for solar radiation at\nbirth, and no association remained for nonfatal prostate cancer.\nA nonsignificant inverse association was found for fatal\nprostate cancer only.\nThe majority of men born in a particular solar radiation\nregion (i.e., low, medium, and high) reported the longest\nresidence in the same solar radiation region. The proportions\nhigh solar radiation regions, respectively. Compared with\nmen who were born and lived the longest in a low solar\nradiation region, those born and with longest residence in\na high solar radiation region had a 48% lower risk (RR, 0.52;\nin a medium solar radiation region had an intermediate risk\nclassified solar radiation at birth and longest residence as\nhigh versus low (above or below the median), we found\nstronger associations with residential sun exposure for fatal\nthan for nonfatal prostate cancer (Table 1). A significant risk\nreduction was found for men with fatal prostate cancer with\nboth early-life and adult residence in a region of high solar\nsolar radiation).\nAssociations with other sun exposure variables in adult\nlife are shown in Table 2. Frequent recreational sun exposure\nwas associated with significantly reduced risk of fatal\nreduction in risk also was found for men whose usual sun\nexposure was rated as ``considerable'' by study physicians\nassociated with physician-assessed or self-reported sun\nexposure in adulthood.\nDiscussion\nAmong several measures of sun exposure examined in this\nprospective study, high residential solar radiation in the state\nof birth, a proxy measure for early-life sun exposure, was\nassociated with reduced prostate cancer risk. Among men born\nin a region of high solar radiation, risk was reduced by 51%,\nwith a slightly greater risk reduction noted for fatal than for\nnonfatal prostate cancer. Among men with frequent recrea-\ntional sun exposure, risk of fatal prostate cancer was reduced\nby 53%. Although limited by small numbers, the influence of\nsun exposure seemed stronger on fatal than nonfatal prostate\ncancer.\nThe finding of reduced risk associated with early-life sun\nexposure is consistent with results from a case-control study\nconducted in England where several indicators of childhood\nsun exposure, including sun burns and sunbathing, were\ninversely associated with prostate cancer risk (7). However, it\nTable 1.

There are\nimportant differences in the residential histories of the two\npopulations. In the NHANES I cohort, large proportions\n(80-91%) of men remained in the solar radiation region where\nthey were born, whereas, in the case-control study, all men\neventually moved to California, a state with high solar\nradiation, and large proportions of cases (75%) and controls\n(75%) spent 40 or more years in a high solar radiation region\nbefore the interview. Unlike the NHANES I follow-up study,\nthe case-control study did not include any men with lifelong\nlow residential sun exposure.\nOur present findings, showing the importance of early-life\nsun exposure, and those from studies of adult sun exposure,\nare not necessarily in conflict. For example, because many\ncase-control studies found a damaging effect of sunburns early\nin life on risk of melanoma, it had been widely believed that\nsusceptibility to melanoma was restricted to a ``critical period''\nin early life. However, subsequent studies have shown that\nafter controlling for sunburns early in life, sunburns during\nadulthood also confer increased risk (16). Although based on\nsmall numbers, our findings suggest similarly that the\nwindow of opportunity for sunlight to alter prostate cancer\nrisk is not restricted to adulthood. Although most epidemio-\nlogic studies have focused on the role of sunlight/vitamin D\nexposure in adulthood, it is biologically plausible that\nexposure to vitamin D in early life also may contribute to\nreduced risk. In particular, it is known that neonatal prostate\ncells express VDR [the receptor for 1,25(OH)2\nD, the hormonal\nform of vitamin D] and that early-life exposure of rats to high\nD results in alterations in the cellular\ncomposition of the prostate gland (17). For example, whereas\nthe ratio of epithelial to stromal cells in the normal rodent\nprostate is 5:1, prepubertal rats exposed to pharmacologic\nD developed prostate glands that were\ncomposed predominantly of stromal cells (18). Because\nepithelial cells are the targets of carcinogenesis in the prostate,\na reduction in the epithelial cell population is one mechanism\nwhereby exposure to vitamin D in early life could reduce\nprostate cancer risk.\nStratification of the analysis by nonfatal and fatal prostate\ncancer suggests that recent adult sun exposure may be more\nimportant for fatal than nonfatal prostate cancer. Similarly, in\nour California-based case-control study, a sun exposure index\nbased on skin pigmentation measurements was associated\nwith reduced risk of advanced (8) but not localized prostate\ncancer.3 These findings are consistent with experimental\nD inhibits prostate cancer cell\ninvasion (19) and metastasis (20) and warrant future studies\nthat distinguish between the effects of sun exposure on early-\nstage versus advanced/fatal prostate cancer.\nReferences\n1.
