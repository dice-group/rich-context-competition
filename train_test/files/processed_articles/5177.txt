Compared to\n``above average'' beliefs in other domains (e.g., see Alicke &\nGovorun, 2005), distinct lines of evidence suggest widespread\nmoral superiority may be particularly irrational--yet, direct\nempirical support for this is absent. In the present study, we\nquantify this irrationality. We find that moral superiority repre-\nsents a uniquely strong and prevalent instance of ``positive\nMoral Superiority\nIn their seminal review, Taylor and Brown (1988) advanced the\ncase for a triad of positive illusions--the first of which was\noverly positive self-evaluation. They regarded these phenom-\nena as reflecting inaccuracies in social perception, persisting\nas a result of their beneficial effect upon human well-being.\nThe common means of inferring the presence of positive illu-\nsions is to ask individuals how they compare with respect to the\naverage person along some dimension. This method consis-\ntently reveals that an implausibly high number of people\nbelieve that they are above average--a phenomenon dubbed\nthe ``better-than-average effect'' (Alicke & Govorun, 2005;\nor ``self-enhancement,'' Sedikides & Gregg, 2008). Although\nthis phenomenon emerges across a range of characteristics, the\nmagnitude of self-enhancement is strongest for moral qualities.\nAcross four studies, Alicke, Vredenburg, Hiatt, and\nGovorun (2001) reported evidence that desirable moral traits,\nsuch as honesty and trustworthiness, are associated with the\nlargest difference between judgments of the self and the aver-\nage person. A similar pattern has been found for undesirable\ntraits--clearly moralized terms such as ``liar'' produce the\nstrongest asymmetries in self-other judgment (Alicke, Klotz,\nBreitenbecher, Yurak, & Vredenburg, 1995). Multiple studies\nconverge on the same conclusion: Magnitude of self-\nenhancement is stronger for moral characteristics--like hon-\nesty--than for other desirable but nonmoral characteristics,\nwisdom (Zell & Alicke, 2011), ambition (Alicke, Vredenburg,\nHiatt, & Govorun, 2001), and intelligence (Van Lange & Sedi-\nkides, 1998).

Desirable moral\ntraits are perceived to be highly descriptive of the self--more\nso than other desirable but nonmoral traits. For example, in a\n11 European countries, Gebauer, Wagner, Sedikides, and\nNeberich (2013) reported that, of two distinct trait dimensions,\nthe one comprising desirable moral terms such as ``faithful''\nand ``honest'' was judged as more self-descriptive than the one\nwhich included nonmoral terms such as ``clever'' and ``wise.''\nAdditional cross-cultural data converge on the same conclu-\nsion. In a similarly sized sample comprising participants from\n54 countries and all 50 U.S. states, the moral characteristics of\n``honesty'' and ``fairness'' were ranked consistently highly in\nindividuals' self-description (Park, Peterson, & Seligman,\ntinct trait dimensions, one including desirable moral charac-\nteristics--such as ``fair,'' honest, and ``loyal''--and the\nother including desirable nonmoral characteristics such as\n``intelligent,'' ``knowledgeable,'' and ``logical.'' Across six\ndiverse cultures, they found that the traits in the former\ndimension were judged to be more descriptive of the self (also\nsee Wojciszke, Baryla, Parzuchowski, Szymkow, & Abele,\n2011). Indeed, numerous studies have shown that individuals\nbelieve they possess, on average, more honesty and\ntrustworthiness than any other characteristic, including intel-\nligence, modesty, friendliness, determination, and indepen-\n1993). Finally, individuals anticipate that, whereas desirable\nnonmoral traits will come and go throughout the course of\none's life, they will always possess desirable moral traits\nThe Paradox\nTaken together, the preceding lines of evidence present a strik-\ning asymmetry. Most people consider themselves paragons of\nvirtue; yet few individuals perceive this abundance of virtue\nin others. As a descriptive phenomenon, this pattern is perhaps\nunsurprising. Previous research indicates that self-\nenhancement emerges most strongly for traits that are both\ndesirable and ambiguous (e.g., Dunning, Meyerowitz, & Holz-\nberg, 1989)--a product of the increased degrees of freedom for\nself-favoring construal of the traits in question. That self-\nenhancement is strongest in the moral domain is directly con-\nsistent with this evidence. Morality traits are highly desirable\n(Van Lange & Sedikides, 1998) yet difficult to check against\nreality (Alicke & Govorun, 2005), and there is significant\nvariability in the behaviors considered indicative of a ``moral''\nperson (Graham, Meindl, Beall, Johnson, & Zhang, 2016).\nHowever, normatively speaking, moral superiority may\nreflect significant incoherence in social judgment and percep-\ntion. To illustrate why, consider a typical individual, Jane,\ntasked with judging the morality of herself and the average per-\nson. The reviewed evidence suggests Jane construes her moral-\nity in very positive terms--in part by capitalizing on trait\nambiguity. In contrast, her judgment of the average person is\ndecidedly less positive. This suggests that Jane foregoes the\ncorollary that high trait ambiguity permits a majority of others\nto be equally as moral as she, albeit in their own idiosyncratic\nways (Dunning et al., 1989). Unfortunately, Jane's double stan-\ndard incurs a cost to her judgment accuracy. Self-judgments act\nas valid cues to what the average person is like--justified by\nthe fact that most people are in the majority most of the time.\nIndeed, appropriately gauging the prototypicality of one's own\ncharacteristics improves accuracy in judgments of ill-defined\nthis prototypicality may thus amount to a failure of inductive\nreasoning (Krueger, Freestone, & MacInnis, 2013). Conse-\nquently, given that most people consider themselves highly\nmoral, if Jane strongly self-enhances her morality--as the evi-\ndence indicates she will--this may also compromise the accu-\nracy of her social perception.\nThe Present Study\nThere is mounting support for the idea that moral superiority is\nan especially potent positive illusion. However, the term\n``illusion'' specifically implies irrationality in belief--an accu-\nsation that lacks decisive evidence (Krueger & Wright, 2011).\nPrevailing measures of self-enhancement do not discriminate\nbetween the rational (i.e., defensible) and irrational (indefensi-\nble) components of self-enhancement (Heck & Krueger, 2015).\nTo our knowledge, there have been no attempts to quantify and\ncompare the irrationality in moral self-enhancement with that\nin other domains of self-enhancement. The present study\naddresses this lacuna. We adapt a novel method (Heck & Krue-\nger, 2015) to isolate and quantify the irrational component of\nmoral superiority and compare it against the irrationality in\nother domains of self-enhancement. We also examine whether\nthe irrational component of moral superiority is associated with\nwell-being, as the prevailing conception of positive illusions\n(Taylor & Brown, 1988), and previous research (e.g., Campbell,\nRudich, & Sedikides, 2002), would predict.\nMethod\nParticipants\nWe sought to recruit 265 participants via Amazon's Mechani-\ncal Turk (www.mturk.com) to achieve greater than 90% power\nto detect a small effect of d \u00bc 0.2 (at a \u00bc .05) in our primary\nanalyses of variance and paired samples t-tests. We over-\nrecruited by 15% to account for data exclusions, bringing our\n624 Social Psychological and Personality Science 8(6)\n\u00bc\nfrom all analyses due to failing at least one attention check\n(8 participants) and/or providing incomplete responses\n(15 participants). A further 18 participants were excluded from\nthe final regression analyses due to lack of variation in judg-\nments of the self, the average person, and/or trait desirability--\nleaving a sample size of 270 for the primary analyses.\nProcedure and Materials\nProcedure. After providing online consent, participants were\npresented with a list of 30 traits, comprising 10 trait terms each\nfor the dimensions morality, agency, and sociability. They\nwere asked to judge the extent to which each trait described\n(a) themselves, (b) the average person, and (c) the social desir-\nability of each trait. Participants rated all 30 traits according to\neither (a), (b), or (c), before moving onto the next set of ratings,\nand the order of these three sets of judgments was counterba-\nlanced across participants (any order effects were presumed\nto be trivial). The presentation order of the traits themselves\nwas randomized across each rating set and participant. Rating\njudgments for the self and the average person were provided\non a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much so). Social desir-\nability judgments were also provided on a 7-point scale, rang-\ning from \u00c03 (very undesirable) to \u00fe3 (very desirable).\nFollowing the trait judgments, participants completed four\nother measures (counterbalanced, detailed below) and provided\nsimple demographic information.\nTraits. The core dimensions of social perception, communion/\nwarmth and agency/competence, are associated with traits\nrelated to benevolence and ability, respectively (Fiske, Cuddy,\n& Glick, 2007). Recently, it has been empirically demonstrated\nthat the communion/warmth dimension is comprised of distinct\nmorality and sociability components--the former describing\nhonesty, trustworthiness, and sincerity, the latter warmth,\nfriendliness, and likeability (e.g., Goodwin, Piazza, & Rozin,\n2014). Thus, drawing upon a comprehensive norming study\nof trait adjectives (Goodwin et al., 2014, Experiment 1), we\nselected five positive (desirable) and five negative (undesir-\nable) traits for each of the three dimensions morality, agency,\nand sociability; providing a total of 30 traits for the present\nstudy. Traits were carefully chosen to minimize dimension\noverlap (see the Supplemental Online Material for details of the\ntrait selection procedure).\nOther measures. Self-esteem was measured using the 10-item\nRosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965). Three addi-\ntional measures were included but were not part of the primary\nanalyses and are thus not reported further in the main text (see\nSupplemental Online Material for relevant analyses). These\nwere the 16-item Narcissistic Personality Inventory (Ames,\nRose, & Anderson, 2006), and the moral identity (Aquino &\nReed, 2002), and need to belong (Leary, Kelly, Cottrell, &\nProjection-based index of self-enhancement. Prevailing mea-\nsures of self-enhancement conflate defensible (or ``rational'')\nself-enhancement with indefensible (or ``irrational'') self-\nenhancement (Krueger & Wright, 2011). For instance, given\nthat individuals have more information about themselves than\nabout others, they will be relatively less certain about what the\naverage person is like. As a consequence, judgments of the\naverage person are likely to be less extreme than self-\njudgments; with the former tending toward the midpoint of the\njudgment scale (Moore & Small, 2007). The corollary is that\nobserved self-other differences in trait judgment--ostensibly\nindicative of self-enhancement--may actually reflect ration-\nally cautious judgments made under uncertainty. In order to\nestimate the irrational component of self-enhancement, it is\ntherefore necessary to first account for this rational component.\nTo this end, we adapted the Social Projection Index (SPI) of\nself-enhancement (Heck & Krueger, 2015).\nTo estimate what proportion of conventional self-\nenhancement may be considered rational, the SPI first asks how\nan individual might infer the characteristics of the average\nperson. One strategy is to draw upon a relative abundance of\nself-knowledge. Indeed, in the absence of salient diagnostic\ninformation about others, one's own characteristics act as cues\nto what others are like. Decades of research has shown that\nindividuals readily project their own characteristics onto others\nand that this process--termed social projection--typically\nincreases accuracy in judgments of what unknown others are\nlike (for reviews, see Krueger, 2007; Robbins & Krueger,\n2005). However, projection may be too weak or too strong--\nindividuals may underperceive or overperceive the similarity\nbetween themselves and others, respectively. Somewhere in\nbetween is the optimal amount of projection, which tracks the\nactual similarity among people. While individuals are unlikely\nto perceive this similarity with complete precision, the\nresearcher can. The similarity may be quantified as the correla-\ntion between individual self-judgments and the average of all\nself-judgments in the group (Hoch, 1987; Krueger et al.,\n2013). This correlation ``coefficient of similarity'' thus\ndescribes how typical of the average a particular individual\nis, and, importantly, a fully rational perceiver may weight their\nself-judgments by this coefficient to maximize accuracy in\ntheir judgments of what the average person is like (Hoch,\nof similarity, therefore, provides a rational benchmark against\nwhich to evaluate individuals' observed self-enhancement\n(i.e., the difference between their self-judgments and their\njudgments of the average person).\nTo illustrate, consider the following example. An individual\nwhose self-judgments are highly typical of the average should\nproject more, as their self-judgments are highly diagnostic of\nwhat the average person is like. In contrast, an individual\nwhose self-judgments are highly atypical of the average should\nproject less, as their self-judgments are only weakly diagnostic\nof what the average person is like. In the former case, judg-\nments of the average person are expected to be minimally\nregressive with respect to self-judgments--resulting in a\nsmaller latitude for defensible (rational) self-enhancement. In\ncontrast, in the latter case, judgments of the average person are\nexpected to be relatively more regressive with respect to self-\njudgments--resulting in a larger latitude for defensible\n(rational) self-enhancement. Crucially, in either case, the SPI\nexplicitly models the fact that informational uncertainty man-\ndates that a proportion of conventional self-enhancement be\nconsidered rational--avoiding the pitfall of earlier measures.\nComputationally speaking, the logic outlined above allows\nresearchers to generate rational predicted judgments of the\naverage person, by weighting individuals' self-judgments\nby their respective coefficient of similarity. As Heck and\nKrueger (2015) point out however, this conceptualizes self-\nenhancement as diminishment of others. Alternatively, it is\npossible to reverse-predict what self-judgments should have\nbeen, if rationally projecting individuals derived their empiri-\ncally observed judgments of the average person from their\nself-judgments. These reverse-predicted self-judgments may\nbe labeled inferred self-judgments, and they yield a more con-\nceptually appropriate interpretation of self-enhancement as\npositive self-inflation.\nDeterminingthe rational andirrationalcomponentsofconven-\ntional self-enhancement thus requires self-judgments, judgments\nof the average person, and computed inferred self-judgments.\nThen, in a final step, the SPI exploits the empirical observation\nthat most individuals possess a positive self-image; ascribing\npositive traits more readily to themselves than to others (and vice\nversa for negative traits). Accordingly, self-enhancement is\nmodeled as the relationship between trait desirability and trait\njudgment,1 meaning that (a) conventional self-enhancement is\ngiven as the difference between how well trait desirability pre-\ndicts self-judgments compared to how well it predicts judgments\nof the average person, (b) the rational component of self-\nenhancement is the difference between how well trait desirability\npredicts inferred self-judgments compared to how well it predicts\njudgments of the average person, and finally, (c) the irrational\ncomponent of self-enhancement is the difference between how\nwell trait desirability predicts inferred self-judgments compared\nto how well it predicts actual self-judgments.\nResults\nDescriptives\nTable 1 displays the list of 30 traits, their mean self (S), average\nperson (or ``other,'' O), and desirability (D) judgments, as well\nas the respective domain reliability coefficients. Table 2 dis-\nplays the zero-order correlations among mean self, other, and\ndesirability judgments for each trait domain.\nRational and Irrational Self-Enhancement\nTo compute the rational and irrational components of self-\nenhancement, we first calculated the similarity between\nindividual self-judgments and the average of all self-\njudgments in the group (i.e., the coefficients of similarity for\neach participant). Thus, for each participant, we regressed the\naverage self-judgments made by all participants for the traits\nin a given dimension onto the self-judgments of the focal par-\nticipant for the traits in that dimension. Estimating unique coef-\nficients for each dimension acknowledges that individuals may\nbe more similar on some dimensions compared to others. We\nthus obtained three coefficients of similarity and their corre-\nsponding intercepts for each participant. As outlined above, the\nSPI posits that these coefficients may be used to weight S judg-\nments to generate rational predicted O judgments, P. P is thus\ngiven as:\nTable 1.

For each dimension, we then\nregressed S, O, and I on D judgments over each participant.\nWe also regressed O on S judgments to cross-check the\nassumption of social projection (a positive association\nconstitutes evidence for social projection; Krueger, 2007).\nTable 3 displays the relevant means. We first draw attention\nto the evidence of social projection; across all trait dimensions,\nS judgments positively predicted O judgments (mean bSO\n\u00bc\n.23\u00ad.30). We then examined whether social projection\nincreased judgment accuracy. For each dimension, we com-\nputed an accuracy index by correlating other judgments with\naverage self-judgments over all participants and traits corre-\nsponding to that dimension. Correlating this index with magni-\ntude of social projection revealed the expected pattern.\nAccuracy of other judgments was positively associated with\nsocial projection across all trait dimensions, r(268) \u00bc .63\u00ad\n.85, all ps < .001. As projection increased, accuracy of other\njudgments improved. This is consistent with previous research\nof the methodological approach taken in the present study.\nNext, we note the expected observation of conventional self-\nenhancement.

Indeed, this was the case.

Morality (.50) comprised the greatest magni-\ntude of irrational self-enhancement, compared with agency\nas the percentage of conventional self-enhancement magnitude\naccounted for by rational and irrational components.\nCorroborating the analysis of magnitude, the data also show\nthat more individuals irrationally self-enhanced (bSD\n> bID\n) for\nmoral traits (243, 90% of sample), compared with agency traits\nmore likely to irrationally self-enhance for agency traits than\nUbiquity of Virtue\nWhat accounts for the strength and prevalence of irrationality\nin moral self-enhancement? Consistent with the ubiquity of\nvirtue, prototypicality of individual self-judgments was highest\nin the moral domain--self-judgments tracked average self-\njudgments better for morality traits (mean b \u00bc .85) than agency\n0.92]. In other words, as expected, the strongest consensus in\nself-judgment emerged in the moral domain. Importantly how-\never, strength of projection to others was not adequately\nadjusted to reflect this consensus. Projection from self to other\nwas no stronger in the moral domain (mean bSO\n[\u00c00.03, 0.21], and was in fact weaker than projection in the\njudgments to a much greater extent than it predicted moral\nother judgments, and, taken in conjunction with the ubiquity\nof virtue, this discrepancy is classified as largely irrational.\nInaccuracy and Well-Being\nThe prevailing conception of positive illusions (Taylor &\nBrown, 1988) encompasses two central claims about strongly\npositive self-evaluations. The first is that they reflect an inaccu-\nrate perception of reality (i), and the second is that this inaccu-\nracy contributes to well-being (ii).\nTo examine (i), for each dimension we correlated the previ-\nously computed accuracy index with magnitude of irrational\nself-enhancement in that dimension. As expected, accuracy\nwas negatively associated with irrational self-enhancement;\naforementioned accuracy index denotes discrimination accu-\nracy only; thus we also examined bias--that is, absolute discre-\npancies in judgment (Epley & Dunning, 2006). For each\ndimension, we computed a discrepancy index of accuracy as\nthe average difference between other judgments and the\naverage of all self-judgments over traits and participants. We\nentered these scores into a repeated measures analysis of var-\niance with dimension as the single factor, F(2, 538) \u00bc\n2 \u00bc .31. Judgments of others' morality\n(1.56) were the most discrepant compared with agency\njudgments. The most inaccurate judgments of others occurred\nin the domain with the strongest irrationality in self-\nenhancement. Thus, both accuracy analyses support claim (i).\nMoving onto (ii), we conducted partial correlations between\nirrational self-enhancement and self-esteem--controlling for\nthe confounding influence of the corresponding rational, and\nthe other dimensions' rational and irrational, components of\nself-enhancement. Magnitude of irrational self-enhancement\nin the moral domain was not associated with self-esteem,\nenhancement in the agency and sociability domains was posi-\nFigure 1.

N \u00bc 270.\n628 Social Psychological and Personality Science 8(6)\nDiscussion\nThe present study revealed two key findings. The first was that\nmoral superiority comprised a substantial irrational compo-\nnent; the absolute and relative magnitude of which was greater\nthan that observed in other domains of self-enhancement.\nIndeed, virtually all individuals irrationally inflated their moral\nqualities. The second key finding was that, unlike the other\ndomains of self-enhancement, irrational moral superiority was\nnot associated with self-esteem. Taken together, these results\nsuggest a uniquely strong and prevalent illusion of moral super-\niority and raise intriguing questions about the function of this\nphenomenon.\nThe irrationality of moral superiority was borne out of the\nubiquity of virtue--almost everyone reported a strong posi-\ntive moral self-image--and individuals' ignorance of this ubi-\nquity when making judgments of the average person. Indeed,\nneglecting the prototypicality--and thus cue validity--of\none's own self-judgments may signal an error in inductive\nreasoning (Krueger et al., 2013). Of course, self-judgments\nthemselves may not accurately reflect genuine moral charac-\nter--for example, compared to behavior (Back & Vazire,\n2012). However, given the substantial degrees of freedom in\nwhat constitutes moral behavior (Alicke & Govorun, 2005;\nGraham et al., 2016), it seems probable that claims of positive\nmoral character are equally legitimate (or illegitimate) for a\nlarge majority of people. In most cases, it would be difficult\nto make the argument that one moral self-image is more gen-\nuine than another. A fallacy thus arises when individuals do\nnot apply to others the same degrees of freedom they invoke\nin their moral evaluation of themselves (Dunning et al., 1989).\nInsofar as this fallacy compromises the accuracy of social\njudgment and perception, it may be deemed erroneous (Heck\nDespite finding strong support for the illusory nature of\nmoral superiority, we found that the irrational component of\nmoral self-enhancement was not correlated with self-esteem.\nThis is inconsistent with the prevailing conception of positive\nillusions (Taylor & Brown, 1988) and is especially pronounced\ngiven that self-esteem was positively associated with magni-\ntude of irrational superiority in both the agency and sociability\ndomains. Furthermore, our result is at odds with previous evi-\ndence that high self-esteem individuals possess a stronger\nbelief in moral superiority (Campbell et al., 2002). However,\nthe latter inconsistency may be accounted for by measurement\ndifferences. Campbell and colleagues assessed superiority\nusing a ``comparative'' measure, that is, they directly asked\nindividuals how much better than average they are. These mea-\nsures correlate most strongly with self-judgments, and only\nweakly with judgments of others (Klar & Giladi, 1999; Krueger\n& Wright, 2011)--the corollary being that the measure used by\nCampbell and colleagues may have assessed (absolute) moral\nself-image rather than (relative) moral superiority. Support for\nthis proposition is recovered from our own data; self-esteem\ndid positively correlate with moral self-image (morality bSD\n),\nAs an indicator of well-being, self-reported self-esteem is\nfar from exhaustive; it is necessary to measure well-being by\nmore objective means to decisively test the theory of positive\nillusions (Heck & Krueger, 2015). Nevertheless, the lack of a\nrelationship between self-esteem and the irrational component\nof moral superiority invites speculation as to why this illusion\nis so pervasive (cf. Taylor & Brown, 1988). Although a full dis-\ncussion is beyond the scope of this article, we note that, from\nother perspectives, moral superiority may not be considered\nirrational at all (cf. Boudry, Vlerick, & McKay, 2015). For\nexample, error management theorists (e.g., Haselton & Buss,\n2000) might view underestimating the morality of others as\nquite rational. Mistaking another person as trustworthy, when\nin fact they are not, may be associated with greater fitness costs\nthan the reverse error. Under such conditions, individuals may\ntolerate decreased judgment accuracy for gains made else-\nwhere (Fetchenhauer & Dunning, 2006; but see McKay &\nEfferson, 2010). On this account, moral superiority may per-\nsist, in part, as a function of the adaptive value of presuming\nmodest morality in unknown others.\nThe findings of the present study are limited in that they do\nnot reveal the behavioral consequences of an illusion of moral\nsuperiority. While we advance the case that moral superiority is\ndubious partly because ``morality'' may be defined by many\ndifferent behaviors (Alicke & Govorun, 2005; Graham et al.,\n2016), it would be practically useful to know whether the illu-\nsion of moral superiority predicts certain types of moral beha-\nvior--for example, dishonesty for monetary gain. On the basis\nof existing research there is scope for competing predictions.\nGiven the evidence that affirmation of moral image ``licenses''\nsubsequent immoral behavior (Blanken, van de Ven, & Zeelen-\nberg, 2015), feeling morally superior may promote greater\ndishonesty. Alternatively, to the extent that people value\nbelief-behavior consistency (Festinger, 1962), moral superior-\nity may be associated with a greater likelihood of honest beha-\nvior. We defer to future research to test these hypotheses.\nThe belief that one is morally superior to the average person\nappears robust and widespread. Our examination of this belief\nrevealed substantial irrationality beyond that observed in other\ndomains of positive self-evaluation. On this basis, moral super-\niority represents a uniquely strong and prevalent form of posi-\ntive illusion.\n"
