Nutrients from supplements may provide a\nsignificant contribution to the overall nutrition of a child,\nwhich cannot be discounted in assessing overall health.\nMETHODS\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey is a na-\ntionally representative, cross-sectional examination survey that\nincludes personal and family interviews, usually conducted in\nthe home, and a medical examination in an NHANES mobile\nexamination center. It samples the US noninstitutional civil-\nian population using a complex, stratified, multistage prob-\nability cluster sampling design.32,33 Participant consent is re-\nquired. Participants older than 17 years sign their own consent\nforms. Parents sign consent forms for children younger than\n18 years, though children 12 through 17 years also sign a form.\nWhile adults generally respond to the survey questions for chil-\ndren younger than 18 years, the children often participate.\nwith interview data and 9755 with examination data. Dietary\nunweighted sample sizes and weighted percentages of US chil-\ngraphic and lifestyle characteristics.\nEight demographic and household characteristics (Table 1) were\nused as covariates in the analyses: age; race/ethnicity; annual fam-\nily income; family health insurance status; household participa-\ntion in the US Department of Agriculture Special Supplemental\nNutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC);\nsmokers in the household; total time spent by the child engaged\nin television, computer, and/or videogame screen time per day;\nand the child's body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in ki-\nlograms divided by height in meters squared; only available for\nchildren older than 2 years). We categorized each child's age in\nmonths into 1 of the 5 groups used in the Dietary Reference In-\nyears, and 14 to 18 years of age. We calculated each child's BMI\nusing measured height and/or length, weight, and age and cat-\negorized each child as underweight (5th percentile), at risk of\nunderweight(5th-15thpercentiles),probablyhealthyweight(15th-\n85th percentiles), at risk of overweight (85th-95th percentiles),\nand overweight (95th percentile), using BMI for males and fe-\nmales separately based on the National Center for Health Statis-\nticschartsandtheUSDepartmentofAgriculture/AgriculturalRe-\nsearch Service Children's Nutrition Research Center categorical\ncriteria.35-37 The population-weighted prevalence of children in\nthe 5 BMI categories were underweight (3.6%), at risk of under-\nweight (5.8%), probably healthy weight (61.3%), at risk of over-\nweight (14.4%), and overweight (14.9%). Older children had a\nhigher prevalence of overweight or being at risk of overweight.\nParticipants, or their proxies if the participant was younger than\n16 years, were asked if they had taken any vitamins, minerals,\nor other dietary supplements in the past 30 days. Trained in-\nterviewers recorded each supplement's name and manufac-\nturer from the label, if possible, or from the participant. Par-\nticipants were also asked for how long, how often, and how\nmuch they had taken each product. National Center for Health\nStatistics staff later obtained the label for each supplement used.\nNational Center for Health Statistics staff incorporated supple-\nment-label information--including the name, ingredient con-\ntents and amount, product form, recommended intake, and in-\ntended target age of the product (infant, child, adult, or older\nadult)--into the data record. For supplements where Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics staff could not identify a prod-\nuct match, the participant was coded as having taken a supple-\nment, but no label details were included.\nDietary supplements were independently categorized in the\nNHANES database based on their ingredients using 2-digit codes\nto represent ingredient classes (eg, single botanical, single min-\neral, single amino acid, and multiple vitamin). The 804 indi-\nvidualsupplementswerecodedinto177dietarysupplementtypes,\ntype classes, such as multivitamin and multimineral, multibo-\ntanical, and multimineral, for our analysis. All steps in the cat-\negorizationwerecross-checkedpriortoanalysis.Supplementtypes\nwith the highest prevalence of use are reported here.\nData were analyzed using SAS, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary,\nNorth Carolina), and SUDAAN, version 9.0 (RTI Interna-\ntional, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) statistical soft-\nware programs. Standard errors were estimated using a Taylor\nseries linearization method that incorporated sampling weights\nand used variance formulas appropriate for the NHANES sample\ndesign. All statistical analyses used NHANES sample weights,\nwhich accounted for unequal probabilities of selection, non-\nresponse, and oversampling.38,39 Analyses were conducted on\nterview sample weights for the combined data.\n\u00a92007 American Medical Association.

As seen in Table 2, overall\ndifferences by characteristics were tested using a Wald 2 sta-\ntistic.

This population-\nbased survey indicated that about one-third of US chil-\nsupplement use increases from low levels in infants and\nyoung children to about 49% for 5-year-old children, fol-\nlowed by a steady decline to 20% among 15-year-old ado-\nlescents, with an increase among older teenagers (28%)\nand into young adulthood (Figure).

Use of botanicals and specialty supple-\nments show up primarily in some smaller, location-\nspecific studies, but the national data presented here sug-\ngests that such use is neither widespread nor uniform.40-42\nSupplement use among teenagers appears to have re-\nmained relatively constant since it was first recorded by\nhave been a decline in supplement use among nation-\nally representative samples of young children, from\nmay be because of revisions in infant formulas after the\nInfant Formula Act of 1980, which are now fortified with\niron, vitamin D, and other nutrients, making them com-\nplete foods for infants.\nMultivitamins and multiminerals remain the most com-\nmonly consumed type of dietary supplement in all pedi-\noverall receiving retinol, ascorbic acid, and vitamin D from\nthese products. As was found in earlier studies,30 most chil-\ndren take only 1 dietary supplement. As in NHANES III30\nusers and nonusers differed in specific characteristics. Di-\netary supplement use was highest among non-Hispanic\nwhite children, those from higher-income families, those\nwhose families were not eligible for WIC, those who had\nnonsmoking environments, and children who engaged in\nless video and television use.\nChildreninthelowestBMIcategoriesandathighestrisk\nof underweight had the highest prevalence of supplement\nuse,whichwassignificantlyhigherthanforoverweightchil-\ndren. The follow-up to the 1988 National Maternal and In-\nfant Health Survey did not include BMI but found that chil-\ndrenaged3yearswhousedsupplementshadsimilarfamilial\nand lifestyle profiles and were more often reported to have\neating problems or poor appetites.27 Young children at the\nlowest BMI for age (near or below the 5% level of weight\nfor height-reference categories) might appear thin to par-\nents and other caretakers and might be given more dietary\nsupplements to \"make them healthy.\" These findings sup-\nport previous suppositions that supplement use in young\nchildren is based on caregivers' perception of the health of\nthe child and their own dietary beliefs.27 An alternative ex-\nplanation might be that children with lower BMIs are more\nlikely to be part of health-oriented families and therefore\nbe more physically active and spend less time at seden-\ntary, screen-related recreation.\nWiththeexceptionofinfants,wefoundthelowestpreva-\nlenceofsupplementuseinolderteenagers(age,14-18years).\nOtherstudieshavefoundthatyoungteenagerswhodonot\ntake supplements have diets that are less likely to meet na-\ntionaldietaryguidelinesandtobeatriskforconsumingless\nCurrent pediatric recommendations are for children to\nreceive their nutrients principally from diet with supple-\nmentation in specific situations,such as supplemental fluo-\nrideinareasonlywheretherearenoorsuboptimalamounts\nof fluoride in the drinking water46 and vitamin and/or min-\neral supplements for children at risk of specific nutrient de-\nficiencies because of their age and/or life situa-\nof children receive dietary supplements and that the high-\nest prevalence of nutrient intakes from these products are\nfor retinol, ascorbic acid, vitamin D, calcium, and iron.
