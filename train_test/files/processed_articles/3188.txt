This liquidity crunch was, however, not uniform\nacross maturities. Whereas financing was generally available at the very short end of\nthe maturity spectrum, liquidity shortages were felt most severely at longer maturities.\nAmong the measures central banks took to fight the crisis, several were particularly aimed\nat easing liquidity shortages at longer maturities.\nThis paper asks what market failure central banks were addressing by intervening and\nwhether they took on unwarranted credit risk by providing other than ultra-short liquidity.\nI identify an expectations channel by which expectations about the availability of longer-\nterm finance in the future may impact on financial firms' investment decisions today. More\nspecifically, with imperfect knowledge about borrowers' investment decisions impatient\nlenders may at times only be willing to lend short-term out of fear that borrowers may\nnot adequately compensate them for the provision of longer-term liquidity. If borrowers\nanticipate lenders' behavior they may choose investment projects that mature early and\ngenerate a low return, validating lenders' expectations. This may be true even if firms\nare able to prefund any future reinvestment need.\nThe model therefore allows for multiple rational expectations equilibria: In the good\n(efficient) equilibrium, firms expect to be able to get longer-term liquidity if they face a\nreinvestment need in the future. This makes them choose high-return but illiquid invest-\nment projects today. Lenders, in turn, correctly assume that high-return projects were\nchosen, making them willing to provide longer-term liquidity indeed. In the bad (ineffi-\ncient) equilibrium, however, firms expect that only short-term liquidity will be available\nand they will therefore choose a low-return (but liquid) investment project. Lenders, on\nthe other hand, are only willing to provide short-term finance since they correctly assume\nthat firms chose the low-return project. Central banks can induce the efficient equilibrium\nif they credibly commit to provide long-term liquidity in the future.\nCentral bank intervention in the model is, however, only necessary if a reinvestment\nneed is highly likely. Otherwise, firms will choose the high-return project no matter what\nmaturity they expect to obtain. In addition, it is important to note that the model\nabstracts from the problem of moral hazard whereby central bank interventions weaken\nagents' incentives to develop funding arrangements that prove resilient during financial\ncrises.\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nW\u00a8\nahrend der Finanzkrise von 2007-2009 kam es bei vielen Finanzinstituten und auf di-\nversen Wertpapierm\u00a8\narkten zu erheblichen Liquidit\u00a8\natsengp\u00a8\nassen. Diese Engp\u00a8\nasse waren\nallerdings nicht \u00a8\nuber alle Laufzeitensegmente hinweg gleich ausgepr\u00a8\nagt. W\u00a8\nahrend Liqui-\ndit\u00a8\nat \u00a8\nuber sehr kurze Laufzeiten im Allgemeinen noch zu bekommen war, waren Mittel\n\u00a8\nuber l\u00a8\nangere Laufzeiten kaum mehr verf\u00a8\nugbar. Unter den diversen, von Zentralbanken er-\ngriffenen, Krisenma\u00dfnahmen zielten einige deshalb auf eine Lockerung der l\u00a8\nangerfristigen\nRefinanzierungsbedingungen ab.\nDas vorliegende Papier geht der Frage nach, welches Marktversagen Zentralbanken\nadressierten und ob sie durch die Bereitstellung l\u00a8\nangerfristiger Refinanzierungsmittel un-\nvertretbare Risiken in Kauf genommen haben. Dabei wird ein Erwartungskanal ausge-\nmacht, nach dem Erwartungen \u00a8\nuber die k\u00a8\nunftige Verf\u00a8\nugbarkeit l\u00a8\nangerfristiger Refinanzie-\nrungsmittel die Investitionsentscheidungen von Firmen beeinflussen. Bei unvollkommener\nInformation \u00a8\nuber die von Schuldnern get\u00a8\natigten Investitionen werden Gl\u00a8\naubiger mitun-\nter die Laufzeit vergebener Kredite begrenzen aus Sorge, nicht angemessen f\u00a8\nur die Be-\nreitstellung l\u00a8\nangerfristiger Mittel entlohnt zu werden. Wenn Schuldner dieses Verhalten\nantizipieren, werden sie Investitionsprojekte w\u00a8\nahlen, die eine kurze Laufzeit und eine ge-\nringere Rendite aufweisen, womit die Sorge der Gl\u00a8\naubiger ex-post gerechtfertigt erscheint.\nDiese Dynamik kann selbst dann auftreten, wenn Firmen die M\u00a8\noglichkeit haben, einen\npotentiellen zuk\u00a8\nunftigen Liquidit\u00a8\natsbedarf vorzufinanzieren.\nIn dem vorgestellten Modell k\u00a8\nonnen folglich multiple rationale Erwartungsgleichge-\nwichte auftreten. Im guten (effizienten) Gleichgewicht erwarten Firmen, dass sie bei ei-\nnem etwaigen k\u00a8\nunftigen Refinanzierungsbedarf l\u00a8\nangerfristige Mittel zur Verf\u00a8\nugung gestellt\nbekommen. Daraufhin w\u00a8\nahlen sie h\u00a8\noher rentierliche, aber illiquide, Investitionsprojekte.\nGl\u00a8\naubiger sind in diesem Gleichgewicht bereit, bei Bedarf tats\u00a8\nachlich l\u00a8\nangerfristige Mittel\nbereitzustellen, da sie korrekt erwarten, dass die Firmen aufgrund der h\u00a8\noher rentierli-\nchen Investition in der Lage sind, sie angemessen zu entlohnen. Im schlechten (ineffizien-\nten) Gleichgewicht erwarten Firmen demgegen\u00a8\nuber, dass sie nur kurzfristige Mittel zur\nVerf\u00a8\nugung gestellt bekommen. Deshalb w\u00a8\nahlen sie weniger rentierliche, daf\u00a8\nur aber liquide,\nInvestitionsprojekte. Gl\u00a8\naubiger sind auf der anderen Seite tats\u00a8\nachlich nur bereit, kurzfris-\ntige Mittel bereitzustellen, da sie richtigerweise unterstellen, dass das Investitionsprojekt\nmit geringer Rendite gew\u00a8\nahlt wurde und sie folglich f\u00a8\nur die Bereitstellung l\u00a8\nangerfristiger\nRefinanzierung nicht angemessen entlohnt werden w\u00a8\nurden.\nZentralbanken k\u00a8\nonnen im Rahmen des Modells nunmehr das effiziente Gleichgewicht\nherbeif\u00a8\nuhren, indem sie glaubhaft versichern, bei Bedarf l\u00a8\nangerfristige Refinanzierungs-\nmittel zur Verf\u00a8\nugung zu stellen. Firmen werden daraufhin in h\u00a8\noher rentierliche Projekte\ninvestieren, w\u00a8\nahrend private Gl\u00a8\naubiger zu einer l\u00a8\nangerfristigen Mittelvergabe bereit sind.\nEine tats\u00a8\nachliche Kreditvergabe durch die Zentralbank kann damit mitunter gar nicht\nerforderlich werden.\nEine Zentralbankintervention in Form der Ank\u00a8\nundigung l\u00a8\nangerfristiger Liquidit\u00a8\natsbe-\nreitstelllung ist im vorliegenden Modell allerdings nur notwendig, wenn ein k\u00a8\nunftiger Re-\nfinanzierungsbedarf sehr wahrscheinlich ist. Andernfalls werden Firmen ohnehin in h\u00a8\noher\nrentierliche Projekte investieren, selbst wenn sie nicht von einer l\u00a8\nangerfristigen Refinan-\nzierung ausgehen. Des Weiteren ist zu bedenken, dass das Modell nicht andere Kan\u00a8\nale\nber\u00a8\nucksichtigt, durch welche Zentralbanken das Verhalten von Firmen bzw. Investoren be-\neinflussen.

In particular, many financial institutions were able to borrow in the\nmoney markets only at prohibitive rates, if at all. This liquidity crunch was, however, not\nuniform across maturities. Whereas financing was generally available at the very short end\nof the maturity spectrum, liquidity shortages were felt most severely at longer maturities.\nThe development of spreads between the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) and\nthe overnight index swap rate (OIS) at different maturities provides evidence for this.2\nDuring the crisis, spreads increased by more for longer maturities than for shorter ones\nwhereas before the crisis there was little difference in the spreads across terms (Buiter\nAmong the measures central banks took to fight the crisis, several were particularly\naimed at easing liquidity shortages at longer maturities. For example, the Eurosystem\nconducted exceptional long-term refinancing operations in August and September 2007.\nStarting in September 2008, it increased the number and frequency of operations with ma-\nturities of three and six months. Finally, it conducted fixed rate full-allotment refinancing\noperations with maturities of up to 12 months starting in June 2009. The Federal Re-\nserve, for its part, extended the maturity of loans at the discount window from overnight\nto up to one month in August 2007. In December 2007, it started the Term Auction\nFacility (TAF) with loans of a 28-day maturity and extended the maturity to 84 days in\nAugust 2008. After the collapse of Lehman Brothers, it also created the Commercial Pa-\nper Funding Facility (CPFF) through which it purchased three-month commercial paper\n(CP) directly from eligible issuers.\nThe responses by central banks were motivated not least by concerns about the impact\nof liquidity shortages on the real economy. For example, in its press release announcing\nthe creation of the CPFF the Federal Reserve stated: \"[. . . ] this facility should encourage\ninvestors to once again engage in term lending in the commercial paper market.

I would like to thank Franklin Allen, Edgar Brandt,\nFalko Fecht, Arne Halberstadt, and Reinhard Schmidt for helpful comments. All remaining errors are\nmy own.\n2LIBOR rates are interest rates for unsecured, longer-term interbank lending, while OIS rates are a\nmeasure of secured, short-term interbank lending, often used as proxy for expectations of future Federal\nReserve policy.\ninvestor demand should lower commercial paper rates from their current elevated levels\nand foster issuance of longer-term commercial paper. An improved commercial paper\nmarket will enhance the ability of financial intermediaries to accommodate the credit\nneeds of businesses and households.\"\nTo put the responses by central banks into perspective, it is important to keep in mind\nthat emergency funding arrangements were already in place when the crisis hit. In par-\nticular, the discount window had prevented major disruptions in previous stress episodes.\nTo the extent that banks saw a stigma to borrowing from the discount window, emergency\nlending operations could have been adjusted to make borrowing more anonymous (which\nthe TAF did). And if institutions other than banks needed to be provided with emergency\nfunding, the discount window or, for that matter, the TAF could have been opened up\nto accommodate their needs (which e.g. the Primary Dealer Credit Facility did). All in\nall, it is not obvious why the maturity of emergency lending operations also needed to be\nextended. In fact, if private lenders decreased the maturity of lending because credit risk\nhad increased, central banks may have taken on too much risk by extending the maturity\nof their loans.\nThis paper looks at the behavior of providers of short-term liquidity such as money\nmarket funds. It is argued that these lenders may not cut the maturity of lending primarily\nout of concern about their own lack of funding sources (as some commentators have\nargued in the case of US money market funds). Instead, with imperfect knowledge about\nborrowers' investment decisions they may only be willing to lend at very short maturities\nout of fear that borrowers may not adequately compensate them for the provision of longer-\nterm liquidity.3 If borrowers anticipate lenders' behavior they may choose investment\nprojects that mature early and generate a lower return, validating lenders' expectations.\nThis may be true even if firms have full access to credit at the onset and would hence\nbe able to prefund any potential future liquidity need. The model therefore allows for\nmultiple equilibria: In the good (efficient) equilibrium, firms expect to be able to get\nlonger-term liquidity if they face a reinvestment need in the future. This makes them\nchoose high-return but illiquid investment projects today. The fact that they choose\nthese projects, in turn, makes lenders willing to provide longer-term liquidity. In the\nbad (inefficient) equilibrium, however, firms expect that only short-term liquidity will\nbe available and they will therefore choose a low-return (but liquid) investment project.\nThis, in turn, makes lenders only willing to provide short-term finance. Central banks can\ninduce the efficient equilibrium if and only if they credibly commit to provide long-term\n3The paper only looks at short-term credit / liquidity provision and tries to give a reason as to why\nlenders may not be willing to provide 3-12 month credit but only credit with a materially shorter maturity.\nliquidity in the future.\nThe types of firm for which the model appears to be particularly relevant are financial\ninstitutions. The balance sheets of these firms are all too often very opaque making it\ndifficult for their lenders to verify investment decisions. In addition, financial firms often\nturn to wholesale funding to refinance a significant part of their balance sheet. Money\nmarket funds as buyers of short-term paper typically do not engage in a thorough analysis\nof investment decisions taken by the issuers of such paper. However, the model could also\nbe applied to non-financial firms (e.g. big corporations) who often directly tap wholesale\nfunding markets as well.\nRelated Literature. My paper is related to several strands of the literature. In\nrelation to the risks arising from short-term financing, Acharya, Gale, and Yorulmazer\n(2010) explain why short-term borrowing may not be rolled over even when there is no\ncredit risk. In their model the price of an asset falls unless some good news arrives. But\nif the debt needs to be rolled over frequently, the probability of receiving good news is\nlow. Hence, borrowing may freeze. Similarly, He and Xiong (2009) show that rollover risk\nmay lead to dynamic bank runs. In contrast to these two models, this paper argues that\na firm may want to avoid a future maturity mismatch in its balance sheet for the very\nreason that it fears to get liquidated otherwise.\nIn this sense, the paper is also related to models in which the fear of a market freeze in\nthe future makes agents choose actions that make a freeze more likely, such as Diamond\nFor example, Diamond and Rajan (2010) argue that the overhang of illiquid securities\nand the seizing up of term credit in the financial crisis of 2008/09 had common causes.\nWhen there are few potential buyers and banks hold a significant quantity of assets, a\nliquidity shock may trigger fire sales in the future. The prospect of a fire sale of the\nbank's assets depresses their current value. As a consequence, a bank may prefer holding\non to illiquid assets and risking future insolvency rather than selling the asset today and\nensuring its own stability. However, by gambling on a recovery the bank exacerbates the\npotential insolvency in the future and the associated price decline.\nBolton, Santos, and Scheinkman (2009) show that financial intermediaries may over-\ninvest in liquid assets if they expect to sell only a small fraction of risky assets at close to\nfair value should they be hit by a liquidity shock in the future. Potential buyers (\"long-run\ninvestors\") will then hold little liquid funds to buy up those assets as they only expect a\nsmall discount relative to fair value. In fact, the authors show that an alternative, more\nefficient equilibrium may exist in which financial intermediaries are more heavily invested\nin the risky asset and long-run investors hold more cash in anticipation of a larger future\nsupply of assets at more favorable cash-in-the-market pricing. The authors show that\npublic provision of liquidity can act as a complement for private liquidity under certain\nconditions.\nFinally, and most similar to my model, Malherbe (2010) develops a model in which\nthe fear of a market breakdown may induce banks to take actions that would in fact cause\nsuch a breakdown. When banks expect a market to be illiquid their best response is to\nself-insure through the hoarding of liquid assets. However, this makes the underlying ad-\nverse selection problem more severe. In particular, if the market expects banks to hoard\nsubstantial liquidity, it suspects that the motive for any bank selling assets at a later stage\nmust be that the assets are of low quality, not that the bank really needs cash. In the end,\nthis may lead to a market breakdown. In such a multiple-equilibria environment, a govern-\nment can prevent the underlying coordination failure and rule out the bad equilibrium by\nintroducing a public liquidity insurance scheme that renders self-insurance unreasonable.\nAgents will then fully invest in the long-run technology and participate in the secondary\nmarket ex-post, boosting overall liquidity in the market. Whereas in his model productive\nlong-term investment hence crucially depends on expectations about future (secondary)\nmarket liquidity, long-term investment in my model depends on expectations about fu-\nture funding liquidity.4 More specifically, my model looks at how expectations about\nthe availability of wholesale funds at different maturities may impact current investment\ndecisions. Public provision of liquidity per se does not solve the underlying coordination\nproblem in my model unless it is of long-term duration.\nHolmstr\u00a8\nom and Tirole (1998) also consider liquidity demand on the corporate bor-\nrowers' side rather than on depositors' side. Similar to their model, public provision\nof longer-term maturity funds is also a pure public good in my model, causing no moral\nhazard. The reason is that liquidity shocks are modeled as exogenous events and the mag-\nnitude of the reinvestment need is not determined by the firm's investment choice. The\ninteraction between corporate firms and financial institutions is also covered in Bebchuk\nand Goldstein (2010). However, the source of inefficiency in their model is a coordina-\ntion failure among lenders themselves, not a coordination failure between borrowers and\nlenders. They argue that it is the interdependence among firms in the real economy that\nmakes the investment in a firm profitable only if other firms are able to receive fund-\ning. Financial institutions may thus rationally avoid lending to nonfinancial firms out of\nself-fulfilling fear that other lenders withhold loans.\nIn general, the model presented here does not rely on strategic complementarities\n4For an explanation of the two concepts of funding and market liquidity see Tirole (2010), for example.\namong lenders.5 Nor does it rely on strategic complementarities among depositors as\nin bank-run models such as Diamond and Dybvig (1983). By contrast, the inefficient\nmarket outcome is driven by a coordination failure between borrowers and short-term\nlenders. Key to this result is the absence of full information (the lender cannot observe the\nborrower's choice of project) and the assumption that short-term investors are assumed\nto be impatient. Furthermore, contrary to Diamond and Rajan (2010) and Malherbe\n(2010), there is no wasteful liquidity hoarding assumed.6 Rather than the lending market\nbreaking down completely, only the market for longer-term funds breaks down in the\ninefficient equilibrium in the model.\nThe paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the model, sections 3 and 4 derive\nthe different equilibria that may occur including the inefficient short-maturity Nash equi-\nlibrium and the inefficient \"prefunding\" equilibrium, section 5 allows for different types\nof firms in the model, section 6 performs some comparative statics, section 7 focuses on\npolicy intervention, and section 8 concludes.\n2 The Model\nConsider an economy with three types of agents: firms, long-run investors, and short-run\ninvestors (or liquidity providers) and four dates: 0, 1, 2, and 3. All agents are risk-neutral\nand protected by limited liability. Firms and long-run investors are indifferent about\nconsuming early or late, i.e. their utility is a linear function of the sum of (undiscounted)\nconsumptions at all dates on or before date 3. By contrast, short-run investors have\npreferences\n,\nwhere Ct\nis the short-run investor's date-t consumption and   (0, 1) is the discount\nfactor. These assumptions are quite standard and are a simple way of capturing the idea\nthat some investors may be impatient.7 Long-run and short-run investors each have one\nunit of endowment at t = 0 and no endowment at subsequent dates.\nFirms are run by entrepreneurs with no initial wealth who need to raise outside funds\nto cover their investment outlays. Investors provide funds and behave competitively in\nthe sense that a loan, if any, just covers investors' opportunity cost of capital, i.e. there is\n5Apart from Malherbe (2010), another adverse-selection-driven endogenous liquidity model that relies\non strategic complementarities is Eisfeldt (2004).\n7Bolton, Santos, and Scheinkman (2009) and Diamond and Rajan (2005) make similar assumptions,\nfor example.\na shortage of investment opportunities relative to endowments of goods. In what follows\nI refer to short- and long-run investors as SRs and LRs respectively.\nFirms can invest in either one of two indivisible projects that each require one unit of\ninvestment at t = 0:\n1. A short-term, low-return (\"L\") project that yields Y2\n 1 at date 2 per unit of\ndate-0 investment which can be fully reinvested to yield Y3\n 1 at date 3 per unit\nof date-2 investment, or\n2. A long-term, high-return (\"H\") project that yields YH\n> 1 at date 3 per unit of\ndate-0 investment, and nothing at date 2.\nBoth projects do not generate a return at date 1. Liquidity is costly as long-term projects\ngenerate a higher yield, i.e. YH\n. Without loss of generality, I assume that\n= YL\n.\nProjects may, however, be hit by an economy-wide liquidity shock at t = 1 which\nneeds to be withstood in order for the projects to be completed, similar to Holmstr\u00a8\nom\nand Tirole (2000). The liquidity shock can be interpreted as a reinvestment need (or an\ninvestment cost overrun). More specifically, with probability  each firm in the economy\nfaces a reinvestment need k < 1 at t = 1. If an individual firm does not reinvest k, then\nits project is liquidated. The liquidation value is zero for both projects.8 If an individual\nfirm reinvests k, then its project has the same (gross) return profile as in the absence of\nthe liquidity shock. The timing of events is described in Figure 1. It is important to note\nthat in contrast to Holmstr\u00a8\nom and Tirole (2000) a potential reinvestment need occurs\nbefore any project generates a return, i.e. even before the L project generates YL\nthe firm must fully resort to outside finance at t = 1 or, if possible, prefund its need at\nCrucially, a firm's project choice is information private to the firm and cannot be\nsignalled to the broader public. An investor therefore has to base her decision of providing\nlong-term or, alternatively, short-term finance at t = 1 on her belief about the firm's\nproject choice, not on the firm's actual choice. This assumption lies at the heart of the\n8The liquidation value for the H project at t = 2 is also assumed to be zero.\n9This assumption guarantees that the firm's project choice cannot be verified when it faces a reinvest-\nment need.\nContract signed Liquidity shock may occur L project generates return YL\nH project generates return YH\n(if reinvestment need is met with\nEntrepreneur chooses H project\nor L project\nInitial investor provides\nfinancing\nFirm is ,,intact\" (no reinvestment\nneeded) with probability 1- and\n,,distressed\" (reinvesment need k per\nsalvaged unit) with probability \nLiquidity provider extends short-\n(if reinvestment need is met with\nlong-term finance)\nq y p\nterm or long-term loan\nFigure 1: Timeline\nmodel as it may give rise to a coordination problem whereby the firm chooses the low-\nreturn project simply because it believes that the liquidity provider believes that it will\ndo so.\n2.2 Firms' Financing Options\nFor simplicity, I assume that the two types of investors face different opportunity costs\nof investing in the firms' project similar to Bolton, Santos, and Scheinkman (2009). LRs\ncan also invest in a long-maturity asset at t = 0 that yields R > 1 at t = 3 per unit\nof investment. By contrast, SRs only have the alternative of investing in cash with a\ngross per period return of 1 per unit of investment. This assumption could be justified\nby current regulatory restrictions in the US, for example. Whereas banks and other long-\nrun investors can invest in long-maturity assets, such as those with a remaining maturity\nof greater than one year, or in asset classes of considerable credit risk, one of the most\nsignificant group of liquidity providers in the US, money market funds (MMFs), cannot.10\nIn what follows I refer to a loan extended at t = 0 as an initial loan, a loan extended at\nt = 1 and maturing at t = 2 as a short-term (\"ST\") loan and a loan extended at t = 1\nand maturing at t = 3 as a long-term (\"LT\") loan. Both ST and LT loans are assumed\nto be in the form of money market instruments or instruments typically held by SRs such\nas money market funds.\n10US MMFs are strictly regulated by the SEC, both as mutual funds generally and pursuant to Rule\n2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940. These regulations prohibit a money market fund from\nacquiring any investment that is not (1) short-term, (2) determined to present minimal credit risks, and\n(3) either highly rated or determined to be comparable in quality to highly rated securities. \"Short-term\"\nmeans that the money market fund can receive its full principal and interest within 397 days. Moreover,\nregulations prohibit the average maturity of the fund's investments from exceeding 60 days.\nGiven that a loan just covers an investor's opportunity cost of capital, liquidity\nproviders will charge RST\n= 1 for a short-term loan and RLT\n= 1/ for a long-term\nloan. For the moment, I assume that SRs can only provide financing at t = 1 and are\nunable to do so at t = 0. This can be easily justified by assuming that the first period is\nlonger than each of the two following periods and a loan covering the first period surpasses\nthe maximum allowable maturity for a security that a liquidity provider may invest in.11\nFor SRs to be able to offer attractive financing rates at t = 1, LRs' opportunity cost\nof investing in the firm must be sufficiently high. In particular, LRs' opportunity cost\nmust be at least as high as the long-term rate offered by SRs at t = 1, i.e. R  RLT\n, for\nfirms to borrow from SRs no matter how high . Otherwise, and for a sufficiently high ,\nLRs would find it attractive to hoard liquidity and provide long-term finance at t = 1 at\na rate below that offered by SRs.12 For simplicity and without loss of generality, I assume\nthat R = RLT\nIn this setting, initial financing at t = 0 will be provided by LRs only and subsequent\nfinancing will be provided by SRs only. The initial interest rate solely depends on LRs'\nopportunity cost of investing in the firm and not on expectations about the firm's choice\nof project. The firm's project choice in turn only depends on the likelihood of the liquidity\nshock and the firm's expectations about the availability of long-term liquidity in the future.\nGiven that the initial interest rate is determined by LRs' (exogenous) opportunity cost,\nwe can hence focus on the net return that each project offers to determine the firm's\noptimal choice of project or the project's return after repaying LRs. I denote this net\nreturn by ^\nYi\n= Yi\n- R, i  {L, H}.\n11Without this assumption, the firm may resort to SRs for initial financing at t = 0. The initial interest\nrate that liquidity providers charge will then depend on their expectation about the firm's project choice.\nIn practice, corporates do not receive long-term financing from MMFs.\n12In fact, given our assumptions, LRs would drive down the long-term interest rate until the expected\nreturn from hoarding liquidity equals the initial interest rate, which in turn equals the LR's opportunity\ncost of investing. More precisely, for any given , LRs' opportunity cost must satisfy\n\n\nI assume that this inequality is satisfied for the whole range of , i.e. R  1/.\n13It is important, however, to keep in mind that LRs, in contrast to liquidity providers, are not assumed\nto be impatient. If they were impatient, the initial interest rate demanded by LRs would depend on LRs'\nexpectation about the firm's project choice.\n2.3 The Role of the Discount Factor\nThe discount factor  takes on crucial importance in the model. To see why, note that\nfor the SR to provide long-term finance at t = 1 in case a liquidity shock occurs, it\nmust be that the net return of a firm's project is greater than the SR's opportunity cost\nof investing, i.e. ^\nYi\n k/, i  {L, H}. I argue that liquidity providers may at times be\nhighly impatient, or, equivalently, their discount factor quite low, so that the net return of\na project may not be sufficient to compensate them for the opportunity cost of providing\nlong-term finance.\nIn particular, I assume that the H project always generates enough net income to\nsatisfy investors that provided the firm with long-term finance to withstand the liquidity\nshock, i.e.\n^\nYH\nThe H project, however, does not generate enough income if it is abandoned prematurely\nwhich will be the case if the firm only received short-term finance at t = 1 to withstand the\nliquidity shock. This follows straight from the previous assumption that the liquidation\nvalue is zero at t = 1, 2.\nBy contrast, the L project only generates enough income for subsequent investors if\nand only if they provided short-term finance at t = 1 to withstand the liquidity shock,\ni.e.\n^\nYL\n^\nYL\nNotice that the above assumptions ensure that initial lenders do not bear any risk by\ninvesting in a given firm provided that the H project is refinanced long-term and the L\nproject is refinanced short term. I next show that in equilibrium this will always be the\n14It is important to note that for these assumptions to hold it is irrelevant as to whether renegotiation\nwith initial investors is feasible or not. In this sense, the model differs from the debt overhang literature\n(e.g. Myers (1977), Hart and Moore (1995)). For example, assume that the firm could renegotiate with\ninitial investors at t = 1. The firm may now want to lower LRs' claims whenever it has chosen the L\nproject. If this was achievable, SRs would always be willing to provide long-term finance at t = 1 (no\nmatter what project the firm chooses). The firm would in turn always choose the (first-best) H project.\nHowever, the problem is that initial investors would never consent to lower their stakes ex post if firms\nchose the L as it would make them worse off. Hence, it is irrelevant whether the firm is able to renegotiate\nwith initial lenders or not.\n3 No Prefunding Option\nFor expositional purposes only, assume for the time being that the firm cannot obtain\nmore than one unit of investment from LRs at t = 0, i.e. the firm cannot prefund any\npotential future reinvestment need that may occur at t = 1. Any reinvestment need must\ntherefore be financed by liquidity providers. Also, assume that the firm does not consider\na short term loan that is rolled over at t = 2 a viable alternative to a long-term loan\nextended at t = 1. In the next section I will qualify both of these assumptions.\n3.1 Socially Optimal Project Choice\nBecause both types of investors do not earn a profit (taking into account their opportunity\ncost), the social surplus generated by either project is simply the firm's expected profit.\nIn general, it is possible that the L project is socially optimal even though it generates\na lower return at t = 3. This is so because the cost of refinancing the L project is also\nlower as SRs do not need to be compensated for late consumption. However, for simplic-\nity and without loss of generality, I henceforth focus on situations in which the long-term\nproject always generates a higher social surplus. Lemma 1 states the condition under\nwhich this is the case.\nLemma 1: The H project whose reinvestment need is financed long-term always gen-\nerates a higher social surplus than the L project whose reinvestment need is financed\nshort-term provided YH\n> YL\n+ (RLT\n)k = YL\nProof: The H project generates a higher social surplus than the L project for all\n <\n- YL\n)\nThe H project generates a higher social surplus for the entire range of  whenever\n(YH -YL)\nYH\n= Y min\nH\nIn words, the return of the H project must not only be greater than the return of the L\nproject but must also compensate for the extra cost of financing the reinvestment need\nlong-term.\n3.2 Equilibrium Project Choice\nThis section focuses on the firm's optimal project choice and asks whether the social\noptimum will be implemented in equilibrium. It is important to keep in mind that a\nfirm's choice is information private to the firm and cannot be signalled to investors. SRs\ntherefore have to base their decision of providing either long-term or short-term finance at\nt = 1 on their belief about the firm's project choice, not on the firm's actual choice. The\ninteraction between the firm and the SR can hence be modeled as a game with imperfect\ninformation similar to Repullo and Suarez (1998). In this game, the firm first chooses\nthe type of investment project (H or L). Subsequently, and only if the firm is hit by\na liquidity shock, SRs choose to either provide long-term finance or short-term finance\nwithout observing the firm's project choice.\nLet y be an indicator variable that takes the value 1 if the firm chooses the H project\nand 0 if it chooses the L project and m be an indicator variable that takes the value 1 if\nthe liquidity provider chooses to provide long-term finance and 0 if it provides short-term\nfinance. We are looking for a Nash equilibrium (y, m) such that\nm yRLT\nk + (1 - y)^\nYL\n- k/ + (1 - m) [(1 - y)RST\nand\nm y ^\nYH\n+ (1 - y)^\nYL\n- kRLT\nYH\n+ (1 - y)(^\nYL\n- kRST\nEquations (4) and (5) are participation constraints for the SR and the firm, respectively.\nIn any Nash equilibrium (NE) the SR needs to be compensated for its opportunity cost\nof investing and the entrepreneur has to be provided with an expected utility of greater\nor equal to zero.\nTo find a Nash equilibrium, notice that we can restrict attention to pure strategy equi-\nlibria. This is so because for any given probability of the SR providing long-term finance,\nthe payoff to the firm if it either chooses the H or the L project with certainty is higher or\nequal to the payoff from mixing strategies. But given that the firm therefore never mixes\nstrategies, the SR will not mix strategies either as its participation constraint (equation\n(4)) will otherwise be violated. The following result characterizes the existence of Nash\nequilibria in the model.\nProposition 1: There exists a critical , denoted by L>H, such that, for any  < L>H,\nthere is only one NE, i.e. (1, 1), where the firm chooses the H project and the SR provides\nLT finance if the liquidity shock occurs. For   L>H there exist two NE, (1, 1) or (0, 0),\ni.e. the firm may either choose the H project and be refinanced long-term or it may choose\nthe L project and be refinanced short-term.\nProof: First note that the only two candidates for Nash equilibria are (1, 1) and (0, 0).\nThe two remaining alternatives, (1, 0) and (0, 1), both violate the lender's participation\nconstraint given the model's assumptions.\nNext, assume that the lender chooses to lend short-term at t = 1. The firm's optimal\nstrategy in this case is to choose the H project whenever (1 - )^\nYH\n> ^\nYL\n- kRST\nor\n <\nYH\n- YL\n^\nYH\n- k\nBut given that the firm chooses the H project, the lender's optimal strategy is to lend\nlong-term. Hence for  < L>H the only NE is (1, 1). By contrast, if   L>H the firm's\noptimal strategy is to choose the L project if it expects the lender to lend short-term.\nHowever, if it expects the lender to lend long-term, the firm is better off choosing the H\nproject which is obvious from equation (5). Therefore both (1, 1) and (0, 0) constitute\nNash equilibria if   L>H.\nNotice that L>H is strictly less than 1 as YL\n> R + k by assumption. There will hence\nalways be a range of  for which multiple equilibria are possible. Finally, we know from\nLemma 1 that the NE (1, 1) is Pareto superior to (0, 0).\n3.3 Numerical Example\nBefore extending the model to allow for asymmetric information, let us turn to a numerical\nexample. Let YH\ninitial interest rate equals the long-term interest rate, i.e. R = RLT\nthat the net return of the L project, ^\nYL\n= 0.21, is high enough to provide SRs with an\nadequate return on funds lent short-term at t = 1. However, it will not suffice to pay an\nadequate return on funds lent long-term at t = 1 as ^\nYL\nnotice that the net return of the H project, ^\nYH\n= 0.25, is high enough to provide SRs\nwith an adequate return on funds lent long-term at t = 1 since ^\nYH\nit will not suffice to provide them with an adequate return on funds lent short-term as\nthe project would have to be liquidated and would generate a return of zero.\nIt is now obvious that the socially optimal outcome of the game is the firm choosing\nthe H project and the SR providing long-term finance, no matter how likely the liquidity\nshock is. For example, if the liquidity shock occurs with certainty ( = 1), the NE (1, 1)\ngenerates a social surplus of 0.02 whereas the NE (0, 0) generates a social surplus of only\n0.01. Nonetheless, for  > 0.79 (= L>H) the firm's optimal strategy is to choose the L\nproject whenever it expects the SR provide short-term finance at t = 1. Given the firm's\nstrategy, the SR indeed provides short-term finance. The economy may thus end up in a\nsuboptimal equilibrium if the liquidity shock is highly likely.\n4 Prefunding Option\nIn this section, it is assumed that the firm is able to obtain more than one unit of invest-\nment from LRs at t = 0, i.e. the firm can now prefund any potential future reinvestment\nneed. Let us focus on three different options that the firm now has: 1) the H project\ncombined with prefunding the potential reinvestment need (simply called \"prefunding\"),\n2) the H project without prefunding (called \"H project\"), and 3) the L project.\nAnother option, financing a potential future reinvestment need by taking out a ST\nloan at t = 1 and rolling it over at t = 2, is assumed unattractive (ex-ante) from the\nfirm's point of view due to a 'rollover cost'. This cost may simply consist of administra-\ntive fees or may reflect the expected cost of not being able to roll over the loan due to\nsome external event outside the model. It is for this cost that a \"rolled-over\" short-term\nloan is not a perfect substitute for a long-term loan.15 I assume that the rollover cost c\nis sufficiently high for the firm to either choose the L project or prefunding rather than\nchoose the H project and fund any reinvestment need by a (rolled-over) short-term loan.\nLemma 2 summarizes the condition under which this is the case.\nLemma 2: A firm that wants a reinvestment need to be financed long-term never con-\nsiders taking out a short-term loan at t = 1 and rolling it over at t = 2 whenever the\nrollover cost c satisfies\nc  min (YH\n- YL\n)\n^\nYH\nk\n^\nYH\nk\n; k R - 1 - (RLT\nYH\n- YL\n^\nYH\nk\n.\nProof: See the Appendix.\n15If there was not a rollover cost, the firm would always choose the H project. To see why, notice that\nonly if the firm chose the H project does it not generate any cashflow at t = 2. Hence, an SR observing\nno cashflow at t = 2 knows that the firm chose the H project. She would hence be willing to roll over\nany ST loan extended at t = 1 (albeit at a higher interest rate). The firm knowing this would therefore\nalways choose the H project at t = 0, anticipating correctly that even a ST loan will be rolled over at\nWith the three options, the key questions to answer is under what circumstances the\nfirm chooses to prefund and whether prefunding is socially desirable. Having the option\nto prefund a potential reinvestment need, the firm can now decide whether or not to play\nthe game with the liquidity provider. Not prefunding the reinvestment need is equivalent\nto deciding to play the game whereas prefunding is equivalent to deciding not to play in\nwhich case the market for liquidity provision at t = 1 ceases to exist. The firm's decision\nwhether or not to play the game will depend on two factors: 1) its expectation about the\nSR's willingness to provide LT finance at t = 1 and 2) its expected return of prefunding\nrelative to the expected return of the L project. The firm will decide not to play the\ngame if and only if it expects the lender to be unwilling to provide long-term finance at\nt = 1 and prefunding generates a higher expected return than the L project. I henceforth\nassume that the firm's decision to prefund is observable but its project choice remains\nunobservable.\nIt turns out that in the simple model with the option to prefund, the firm will never\nchoose the L project but may instead prefund the reinvestment need for a sufficiently high\n. To see this, note that if the firm expects the SR to only provide ST finance at t = 1 it\nwill prefer prefunding to the L project whenever\n^\nYH\n+ (1 - )k - Rk > ^\nYL\n- k\nSolving for YH\nwe get YH\n> YL\n+ (R - 1)k which is true by Lemma 1. In addition, under\nthese circumstances prefunding will always be possible.16 Hence, no matter how high\nthe liquidity shock, the firm never chooses the L project. Instead, in equilibrium, it will\nchoose the H project and either prefund the potential reinvestment need or rely on SRs\nto provide LT finance. As can be easily verified, the NE where the firm relies on SRs for\nLT finance is Pareto superior to the prefunding equilibrium.17\nIt is important to note, however, that the critical probability level beyond which there\nare multiple equilibria remains unchanged at L>H, i.e. the threshold level of  is again\nsolely determined by the relative attractiveness of the H project versus the L project. This\nmay at first seem surprising. In particular, it could be that the firm preferred prefunding\nto the H project for some  < L>H if it believed to only get ST finance at t = 1 otherwise.\nHowever, this belief turns out to be unjustified. Whenever the SR observes that the firm\ndid not prefund at  < L>H, she knows that it must have chosen the H project. The\nH\n= (1 + k)R be the minimum YH\nfor which prefunding is still possible. If Lemma 1 holds\nprefunding is always possible as long as Y min\nH\n> Y Pre\nH\nor YL\n> R + k which is true by assumption 2.\n17The NE generates a higher SS to the prefunding equilibrium whenever YH\n- R - RLT\nk  YH\n-\n. Since R = RLT\nthis is satisfied for the entire range of .\nlender is hence willing to lend long-term at t = 1 in this case. By contrast, suppose\n  L>H and the firm believes that it will only be able to obtain short-term finance at\nt = 1. The SR knows that in this case the firm must have chosen the L project if it did\nnot prefund its reinvestment need. The lender will hence indeed only provide short-term\nfinance at t = 1.\n5 Incorporating 'Bad' Firms into the Model\nPrefunding may no longer always dominate the L project if we allow for different types\nof firms (and asymmetric information about these types). So far, there was just one type\nof firm in the model whose project produced a return of either YH\nor YL\nwith certainty\n(provided the liquidity need was somehow met). The market failure occurred because\nthe SR could not tell what project the firm actually chose and therefore had to place its\ndecision of providing long-term versus short-term finance on her belief about the firm's\nchoice.\nIn the following section, I extend the model to allow for another type of firm. This 'bad'\nfirm can only invest in a project that neither yields a date 1 nor a date 2 return. However,\nit enjoys an infinitesimal small private benefit B  0 at date t = 2 by undertaking the\nproject. Furthermore, there is asymmetric information between the firm and investors\nin the sense that bad firms always disguise as good firms in order to receive financing.\nThe model thus becomes a version of the standard privately-known-prospects model (see\nThe key question I try to answer is how the degree of asymmetric information about\nthe firm's type affects the possibility of having multiple equilibria in the model. This\nshould give an indication as to whether public intervention may be more or less justified\nin markets with a lower degree of asymmetric information. Somewhat surprisingly, it\nturns out that in markets with less asymmetric information firms may be more inclined\nto choose the L project or prefunding (i.e.the critical L>H is lower). This supports the\nnotion that public intervention may at times be particularly beneficial in markets for high\nquality debt with a low degree of asymmetric information.\nTo be more specific, assume that at the onset (t = 0) there is a fraction pL\nof good\nfirms that share all of the characteristics of the firms in the simple model. But there is\nnow also a fraction 1 - pL\nof bad firms that share the above mentioned characteristics.\nFurthermore, assume that information becomes less asymmetric at t = 1 in that SRs can\nnow identify some bad firms. This means that SRs refinance a fraction pH\nof good firms\nand a fraction 1 - pH\nof bad firms at t = 1 (pH\n> pL\n). The interest rates charged by SRs\nand LRs will hence now also reflect their respective agency costs, i.e. R = 1\npL\npH \n,\nand RST\npH\n.\nThis assumption is supposed to reflect the fact that liquidity providers (SRs) are\ndifferent from risk takers (LRs). Not only are liquidity providers such as MMFs barred\nfrom extending credit over an extended period of time, MMFs are also fundamentally\nopposed to assuming excessive credit risk. It is, however, crucial to keep in mind that\nalthough there is less asymmetric information about the firm's type at t = 1, there is still\nasymmetric information about the good firm's choice of project.\n5.1 Socially Optimal Project Choice\nBefore I show that firms may now choose the L project or prefunding (crucially depending\non the relative return of the H project), let us restate Lemma 1 to account for asymmet-\nric information and the possibility of prefunding. Lemma 3 states the condition under\nwhich the H project without prefunding generates a higher social surplus than either the\nL project or prefunding.\nLemma 3: The H project Pareto dominates both the L project and prefunding for\nthe entire range of  provided YH\n+ k(RLT\n) and pL\n< pH\n.\nProof: As in Lemma 1, it is straightforward to show that the H project Pareto dominates\nthe L project under the above condition. Furthermore, note that the H project returns a\nhigher social surplus than prefunding whenever pL\n< pH\nsince the agency cost that the\nfirm incurs if it prefunds is higher than if it waits for the reinvestment need to occur.18\nAnalogous to section 3.1, define Y min\nH\nas the minimum YH\nat which Lemma 3 just holds,\ni.e. Y min\nH\n^\n+ k(RLT\n). We will see in the next section that whether or not the\nfirm prefers prefunding to the L project crucially depends on whether YH\nis significantly\nabove Y min\nH\n.\n18The H project generates a higher social surplus than prefunding whenever\nYH\n- R - RLT\nk > YH\n- R(1 + k) + (1 - )k\n\npH\n<\npL\nThe H project generates a higher SS for the entire range of  if and only if pH\n> pL\nwhich is true by\nassumption.\nThe next section focuses on the firm's equilibrium project choice under asymmetric in-\nformation about the firm's type. From Lemma 3 we know that neither the L project nor\nprefunding are optimal outcomes. Instead, it would be best if the firm always chose the\nH project and rationally expected to be refinanced long-term. However, we also know\nthat under the expectation of only being able to receive short-term finance at t = 1, the\nfirm will not choose the H project for a sufficiently high . As in section 3, under the\nexpectation of future short-term finance the firm prefers the L project to the H project\nwhenever\n \nYH\n- YL\n^\nYH\nk\n^\n= L>H.\nAgain, note that L>H < 1 as YL\n> R + RST\nk by assumption. Furthermore, for the same\nreasons as in section 4, there is only one equilibrium whenever  < L>H.\nThe key question now is whether the firm will choose the L project or prefunding\nwhenever  > L>H and it expects to only be offered ST finance at t = 1. In general,\nfor the firm to choose prefunding two conditions must be satisfied: 1) Prefunding must\nbe possible and 2) Prefunding must be preferred to the L project. However, as Lemma 4\nstates it is sufficient to concentrate on what the firm prefers:\nLemma 4: If the firm prefers prefunding to the L project for some   (0, 1), then\nprefunding is possible.\nProof: The firm prefers prefunding to the L project whenever YH\n+ (1 - )k - Rk >\nYL\n- kRST\n. Solving for  we get\n >\nRST\n-\nYH\n- YL\n^\n= Pre>L.\nNext, note that Pre>L  1 for the firm to prefer prefunding at some   (0, 1). Solving\nfor YH\nthis is equivalent to YH\n+ k(R - RST\n) ^\n= Y \nH\n. However, we know that\nprefunding is possible whenever YH\n (1 + k)R ^\n= Y Pre\nH\n. For Lemma 4 to hold it must\ntherefore be that Y \nH\n> Y Pre\nH\nor YL\n+ k(R - RST\n) > (1 + k)R. Solving for YL\nwe get\nYL\n> R + kRST\nwhich is true by assumption.\nLemma 4 facilitates the analysis as we just have to ask whether the firm prefers pre-\nfunding or not, ignoring the question as to whether prefunding is feasible at all. That is,\nit could be that for some YH\n< Y \nH\nprefunding is not feasible. However, in this case the\nfirm does not want to prefund anyway.\nLet us now turn to the question of what the firm chooses to do if YH\n Y \nH\nand it\nexpects to only be able to receive short-term finance. Since pre>L is decreasing in YH\n, we\nknow that the higher YH\nthe wider the range of  for which the firm chooses to prefund\nthe reinvestment need. However, as long as pre>L > L>H, there is still a range of  for\nwhich the firm chooses the L project. That is, if pre>L > L>H, the firm chooses the L\nproject for all   (L>H; pre>L) and chooses to prefund for all  > pre>L. Finally, it\nis obvious that there is a critical Y \nH\nfor which Pre>L = L>H. Whenever YH\n> Y \nH\nthe\nfirm will never choose the L project and always prefund the potential reinvestment need\nif  > L>H. This critical Y \nH\nis derived in the appendix. Hence, for a sufficiently high\nYH\nand under the expectation of short-term finance the firm will always prefer prefunding\nto the L project.\nProposition 2: There exists a critical L>H such that for any   L>H there is\nonly one NE in which the firm chooses the H project and the SR provides LT finance\nif the liquidity shock occurs. For any  > L>H there exist two equilibria at each .\nOne equilibrium is the NE where the firm chooses the H project and the SR provides LT\nfinance. The other equilibrium depends on the return of the H project, YH\n. If YH\n Y \nH\n,\nthe other equilibrium will always be the NE where the firm chooses the L project and the\nSR provides ST finance. By contrast, if YH\n Y \nH\n, the other equilibrium will always be\nthe prefunding equilibrium. Finally, if YH\n (Y \nH\n, Y \nH\n) the other equilibrium depends on\nthe likelihood of the liquidity shock.\nProof: Omitted.\nHowever, neither the Nash equilibrium (0, 0) nor the prefunding equilibrium constitute\nbest outcomes. The highest social surplus will still be generated if the firm chooses the\nH project anticipating correctly that it will be refinanced long-term at t = 1.\n5.3 Numerical Examples\nPrefunding not possible\nLet YH\n= 1. The initial\ninterest rate now becomes R = 1.17 and the long-term and short-term interest rates are\nunchanged at RLT\n= 1, respectively.\nPrefunding a potential reinvestment need is impossible as Y Pre\nH\nYH\n= 1.40. However, since SRs can perfectly distinguish between good and bad firms at\nt = 1 (since pH\n= 1), good firms can fund any of the two projects at t = 0 and turn to\nSRs at t = 1 for financing the reinvestment need since YH\n> R + RLT\nYL\n> R + RST\nk = 1.3696. However, the H project only yields enough income if it is\nrefinanced long-term at t = 1. Likewise, the L project only yields enough income if the\nfirm receives short-term finance at t = 1.\nFinally, as YH\n> Y min\nH\n= 1.3905, the socially optimal outcome of the game always con-\nsists of the firm choosing the H project and the SR providing long-term finance at t = 1,\nregardless of the likelihood of the liquidity shock. Nonetheless, for  > L>H = 0.658 the\nfirm's optimal strategy is to choose the L project whenever it expects SRs to only provide\nshort-term finance at t = 1. Given the firm's optimal strategy, SRs' optimal strategy is\nindeed to only offer short-term finance at t = 1.\nPrefunding possible\nLet YH\n= 1.41 and the other parameter values unchanged at YL\nand pL\n= 1. Prefunding a potential reinvestment need is now possible as\nYH\nH\nH\nfirm still chooses the L project for all  > L>H = 0.7424 whenever it expects SRs to only\nprovide short-term finance at t = 1. However, if YH\n= 1.42 (and the rest of the parame-\nter values again unchanged), the firm will choose prefunding for all  > L>H = 0.7935\nwhenever it expects SRs to only provide short-term finance at t = 1.\nFinally, if we allow for some asymmetric information still being present at t = 1, it\nturns out that the firm's choice depends on the given probability of the liquidity shock.\nTo see this, let YH\n= 0.99 and all other parameter values unchanged.\nThe critical probability level beyond which there are multiple equilibria possible is given\n6 Comparative Statics\nIt is illuminating to perform comparative statics on the critical L>H beyond which the\nfirm prefers the L project over the H project whenever it believes that only ST finance\nwill be available at t = 1. That is, we can determine how the threshold level beyond\nwhich multiple equilibria are possible responds to a change in parameter values. Since\nthe intervention by the Federal Reserve was targeted at markets for short-term debt of the\nhighest quality, a natural question to ask is how L>H responds to changes in parameter\nvalues that could be associated with an increase in firms' perceived credit quality. As we\nwill see, the threshold L>H in fact decreases with such changes. In this sense, there is\na rationale for why central bank intervention may be particularly justified in markets for\nCP of the highest credit quality.\nTo see this, interpret a higher firm quality as either a higher pL\n, i.e. a higher probability\nfor being a good firm, or a lower k, i.e. a lower reinvestment need. Strictly speaking, pL\nis not a measure of each firm's individual credit quality but a measure of the degree of\nasymmetric information. However, in the eyes of an initial lender there is conceptually\nno difference as she faces a return of zero if either she lends to a bad firm or to a good\nfirm that turns out to be unsuccessful. If the firm always has a lower reinvestment need\nif a liquidity shock occurs it has a higher expected return and hence can be considered of\nhigher quality.\nIt can easily be checked that the derivative of L>H with respect to pL\nis negative\nwhereas the derivative of L>H with respect to k is positive.19 Hence, both tell the same\nstory: an increase in firms' quality is associated with a lower threshold level of  beyond\nwhich multiple equilibria are possible. What is driving this result? Rewrite the firm's\nexpected profit from choosing the H project when it expects to only obtain short-term\nfinance as YH\n- R - (YH\n- R). Likewise the expected profit from choosing the L project\nis YL\nk. Since a higher pL\nleads to a lower initial interest rate R, the firm loses\nmore profit for each small increase in  when it chooses the H project (as opposed to the\nL project). Hence the level of  at which the profits from each project are equal to one\nanother is lower. On the other hand, a lower k also increases the relative attractiveness\nof the L project at each level of  resulting again in a lower L>H at which the profits of\nthe two projects are equal. Key to the result is that the firm by choosing the H project\nis unable to withstand the liquidity shock and earn a profit.\n7 Policy Intervention\nThe key problem in the model is that no private actor can credibly commit to follow a\nparticular course of action when a liquidity shock is likely. The firm cannot commit to\ncarrying out the H project as this will be a suboptimal choice whenever it believes it will\nonly be able to obtain short-term finance at t = 1. And the SR cannot commit to lending\n19Rewrite L>H as L>H = pL(YH -YL)\npL(YH -RST k)-1\n. The derivative with respect to pL\nis L>H\npL\n=\n(YH -YL)[pL(YH -RST k)-1]-pL(YH -YL)[(YH -RST k)]\n. It can easily be checked that this term is always\nnegative.\nlong-term at t = 1 since this will be suboptimal if she thinks the firm chose the L project\nat t = 0. If either the firm or the SR could commit to carrying out the H project or to\nlending long-term no matter what, the other party would choose the action that would\nresult in the Pareto efficient outcome. The key question for policymakers is then how to\nensure that the socially optimal equilibrium is depicted.\nOne approach might be to let the central bank extend long-term credit at t = 1 when\nthe liquidity shock is highly likely. This could be done at some (slightly) punitive interest\nrate so that firms still prefer borrowing from private agents. But this raises the question\nof why the central bank should be able to credibly commit to provide long-term finance\nif private agents are unable to do so. In what follows I argue that this can be the case if\nthe two agents face different relative costs of providing short-term vs. long-term finance\nat t = 1. For example, if the central bank faces high reputational costs of reneging on\na previous promise to provide long-term finance, it may stick to that promise even if\nthe firm chose the L project. However, the central bank will in fact not be at risk of a\nloss. Because the commitment is credible, the firm will choose the H project (and not\nthe L project) which would leave enough income to compensate the central bank for its\ninvestment. In fact, if the interest rate is slightly punitive, the central bank will not even\nextend any credit because SRs will do so at more attractive terms.\nTo see this formally, let us return to the simple model of section 3, ignoring the option\nto prefund the potential future liquidity need. We will later see that ignoring prefunding\nas an option is justified. Let  denote the central bank's extra cost of providing short-term\ncredit at t = 1. In the context of the previous paragraph, this cost can be self-inflicted\nin the sense that if the central bank provides short-term credit when it promised not to\ndo so it will incur a reputational damage. As in section 3.2 we are looking for a Nash\nequilibrium (y, m) such that\nm yRLT\nk + (1 - y)^\nYL\n- k/ + (1 - m) [(1 - y)RST\nand\nm y ^\nYH\n+ (1 - y)^\nYL\n- kRLT\nYH\n+ (1 - y)(^\nYL\n- kRST\nEquation (7) is now the participation constraint of the central bank which is the same\nas the one for the SR except for the (reputational) cost . Equation (8) is the firm's\nparticipation constraint which is unchanged from section 3.2. The following proposition\nsummarizes when the central bank's intervention will be successful.\nProposition 3: Central bank intervention in the form of promising to provide long-\nterm finance at t = 1 will lead to implementation of the Pareto efficient equilibrium\nwhenever the central bank's reputational cost is sufficiently high, i.e.   k/ - ^\nYL\n.\nProof: The central bank provides long-term finance even if the firm chose the L project\n(y = 0) whenever ^\nYL\n-k/  - which is equivalent to   k/ - ^\nYL\n. Therefore we know\nthat in equilibrium m = 1 whenever the reputational cost is higher than this threshold\nlevel. However, the firm's best response to m = 1 is y = 1 and the only NE is therefore\nthe Pareto efficient equilibrium (1, 1).\nWith this single solution to the game, we know that the firm will always decide to play\nthe game instead of prefunding the potential liquidity need, which justifies ignoring pre-\nfunding as an option.\nKey for its ability to commit is that the central bank incurs a higher loss if it pro-\nvides short-term (instead of long-term) finance whenever the firm chooses the short-term\nproject. Somewhat paradoxically, it is thus the willingness to incur additional losses in\nsome states of the world that renders any losses for the central bank unlikely. This insight\npoints to another possibility of intervening to ensure the implementation of the Pareto\nefficient equilibrium. As the relative attractiveness of providing short-term finance needs\nto be reduced, another solution would be to force SRs to incur (higher) losses if they\nprovide short-term loans at t = 1. In fact, imposing a tax of t  k/ - ^\nYL\non short-term\nloans would also guarantee an efficient outcome.\n8 Conclusion\nThis paper explores why central bank intervention in the form of providing longer-term\ncredit to financial firms may be justified at times. I identify an expectations channel by\nwhich expectations about the availability of longer-term finance in the future may impact\nfirms' investment decisions today. These investment decisions in turn may justify lenders'\ndecisions whether or not to supply longer-term credit.\nCentral banks, by promising to supply longer-term credit in the future, may stabilize\nfirms' expectations and lead them to invest in projects that generate the highest social\nsurplus. Through this form of intervention, central banks may, in fact, not assume any\ncredit risk and may not even have to extend longer-term credit. Instead, private lenders,\nbeing more confident about firms' investment decisions, may instead be willing to provide\nlonger-term financing themselves.\nIt is important to note that the model assumes that (short-term) wholesale funding\nmarkets are completely anonymous and that no communication between firms and liq-\nuidity providers takes place. Liquidity providers in the model have to place their lending\ndecision solely on their belief about the firm's project choice without the firm being able\nto signal its true choice. In practice, this assumption may be seen as quite restrictive in\nnormal times. However, it should be seen in the light of the recent crisis where events\nwere unfolding rapidly and the usual communication channels between firms and investors\nwere severely impacted.\nAs for the paper's policy conclusion, it is interesting to note that the new restrictions\nplaced on US-Money Market Funds in January 2009 go into the opposite direction of\nwhat the model recommends as a solution to the market failure problem. In fact, the new\nrules make short-term loans comparatively more attractive for MMFs. Apparently, a key\nmotivation for the new rules was to reduce the maturity mismatch between the assets and\nliabilities of US MMFs, thereby making the funds less susceptible to investor runs. The\npossibility of such runs and how to prevent them from occurring are beyond the scope of\nthe paper. However, the model implies that these rules may have negative consequences\nin that they could make Pareto suboptimal outcomes more certain whenever firms are\nlikely to be hit by liquidity shocks.\nThe simple model presented here just focuses on firms of the highest credit quality\nthat issue short-term debt in markets with little asymmetric information. It shows that\ncentral bank intervention in these markets may be justified, in particular. However, the\nmodel does not account for other channels through which such interventions may impact\non firms', or for that matter, investors' behavior. In particular, it abstracts from the\nproblem of moral hazard. Private agents that know that central banks will intervene will\nhave less incentive to develop private sector funding arrangements that prove resilient\nduring financial crisis. In future research, it would be interesting to see how moral hazard\nconcerns weigh against the benefits of stabilizing private sector expectations.\nAppendix\nA Proof of Lemma 2\nWe know that for  < L>H there is only one equilibrium where the firm always chooses\nthe H project and the reinvestment need is financed long-term. Hence, the firm may only\nprefer the L project or prefunding for the range of  for which multiple equilibria are\npossible, i.e. for   L>H.\nFor the firm to prefer the L project to the H project that is financed with a (rolled\nover) short-term loan it must be that ^\nYH\nk - c  ^\nYH\nk or\nc  YH\n- YL\n- (RLT\n)k\nAs c is decreasing in , the condition will be satisfied for all   L>H if it is satisfied at\n = L>H which will be the case if\nc = (YH\n- YL\n)\n^\nYH\nk\n^\nYH\nk\n^\n= cL.\nFor the firm to prefer prefunding to the H project that is financed with a (rolled over)\nshort-term loan it must be that ^\nYH\nk - c  ^\nYH\n- Rk + (1 - )k or\nc  k[R - 1 - (RLT\nAgain, as c is decreasing in , the condition will be satisfied for all   L>H if it is\nsatisfied at  = L>H which will be the case if\nc = k R - 1 - (RLT\nYH\n- YL\n^\nYH\nk\n^\n= cPre.\nIt should be noted that cL is increasing in YH\nwhereas cPre is decreasing in YH\n. Further-\nmore, it can easily be checked that for YH\n= YL\n+ (R - 1)k the two terms are equal.\nHence, if the firm prefers prefunding to the L project, i.e. YH\n+ (R - 1)k, the\nminimum rollover cost will be c = cPre and the firm does not choose the H project with\na (rolled over) short-term loan. Similarly, if the firm prefers the L project to prefunding,\ni.e. YH\n< Y \nH\nthe minimum rollover cost will be c = cL and the firm also does not choose\nthe H project with a (rolled over) short-term loan.\nB Derivation of Y \nH\nWe want to find the critical YH\nfor which Pre>L = L>H or\nYH\n- YL\nYH\n- R - RST\nk\n=\nRST\n-\nYH\n- YL\nRearranging we get\nH\n+ R(1 + k)]\n\"b\"\nYH\n+ YL\n(R + k) + k(R - 1)(RST\nk + R)\n\"c\"\nThis is a standard quadratic equation in YH\n. Solving for YH\nwe get:\nH\n=\n-b \u00b1\n\nIt is now straightforward to rule out one candidate as a solution. Given Lemma 4 we\nknow that at Y \nH\nprefunding is possible. Hence, if both Y 1\nH\nH\nwere solutions, both\nwould have to be high enough to allow for prefunding. In particular, it must be the case\nthat\nH\n=\n-b -\n\n> (1 + k)R\nSubstituting the first b in the numerator but, for simplicity, keeping the term under the\nsquare root unchanged and rearranging we get\nYL\n> (1 + k)R +\n\nHowever, if YL\n> (1 + k)R then YL\n> R + kRLT\nas long as pH\n> pL\n(which we assume).\nThis violates one of the key assumptions of the model, i.e. that the L project does not\nprovide a return high enough to compensate SRs for lending long-term at t = 1. Hence\nthe only solution candidate is Y 1\nH\n. Furthermore, since pre>L is a continuous function of\nYH\n, we know that there must be at least one solution. This solution must therefore be\nH\nwhich we rename Y \nH\n.\nReferences\nAcharya, V. V., D. Gale, and T.
