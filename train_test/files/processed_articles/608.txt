Post-abortion care\n(PAC) encompasses the treatment of many types of medical compli-\ncations, the most common one being incomplete abortion, ranging\nto less common but much more severe ones such as sepsis and uter-\nine perforation.3 Treating unsafe abortions, while essential for wom-\nen's health and survival, diverts health resources from other uses\nand is a significant burden to the health care systems in developing\ncountries where 98% of all unsafe abortions occur (WHO 2011). At\nthe same, it is a preventable phenomenon depending on access to\nsafe abortion care or effective contraception. Therefore, there is\nboth an interest and a need to estimate the cost of PAC to inform\npublic discussion of unsafe abortion and to help policy makers more\nefficiently allocate resources (Vlassoff et al. 2009b).\nThe report Adding it up: the costs and benefits of investing in\nsexual and reproductive health (Singh et al. 2014) estimates the total\nhealth-system cost of providing PAC services in the developing\nbut cannot access it--and those who do get medical care may not re-\nceive comprehensive quality care--providing all women in need\nwith the WHO recommended standard of care would cost substan-\ntially more, an estimated $562 million. Unsafe abortion is a burden\nnot only for health systems but also for women themselves and their\nhouseholds. A study in Uganda, where abortion is common despite\nbeing legally restricted and highly stigmatized, found that women\nhaving unsafe abortions spent on average US $49 in out-of-pocket\nexpenditures for the procedure as well treatment of complications\n(Sundaram et al. 2013). For many of these women, similar to much\nof the developing world where unsafe abortion is prevalent, such ex-\npenditures are onerous given the prevailing low levels of income.\nUntil recently, few studies on the cost of PAC were available and\nthey generally lacked a standard methodology, making their findings\nresponse to this knowledge gap, a coherent methodology has been\ndeveloped, pilot tested and further refined in four successive country\nstudies. This methodology, the Post-abortion Care Costing\nMethodology (PACCM), will be described in more detail below. The\nfindings of the studies using PACCM provide the start of a consist-\nent evidence base, comparable across countries and regions. While\ncalculating the cost of unsafe abortion varies according to the frame\nof reference chosen (Vlassoff et al. 2008), PACCM adopts the per-\nspective of national health systems, focusing on the financial burden\nthat the treatment of post-abortion complications imposes on health\nsystems.\nOver the last five years, comprehensive national surveys of the\ncost of PAC to national health systems have been undertaken in\nEthiopia, Uganda, Rwanda and Colombia using the PACCM ap-\n2014a,b) This study extends the research findings of these four stud-\nies, making use of their extensive datasets to thoroughly exploit the\npossibilities for comparative analysis. Our objective is to compare\nempirical results of the health-system costs of treatment of complica-\ntions resulting from unsafe induced abortion from these country ap-\nplications of the PACCM methodology. These studies offer the most\ncomplete and consistent estimates of the cost of PAC to date, and\ncomparison of their findings not only provides generalizable\nimplications for health policies and programs, but also allows an as-\nsessment of the PACCM methodology.\nData sources and methods\nPACCM follows the `ingredients approach' (Johns et al. 2003) and\ntraces its origin to the WHO's Mother-Baby Package costing spread-\nsheet (Weissman et al. 1999). A prototype of the method was first\nused in an abortion-incidence study in Nigeria (Bankole et al. 2007)\nand subsequently the Guttmacher Institute developed PACCM, first\ntesting it out in pilot studies in Mexico, Ethiopia and Pakistan in\n2008. PACCM, using a health-system perspective, was designed as a\nlow-cost method of estimating PAC costs that would be useful for\npolicy analysis. Data on drugs, supplies and materials, labor inputs\nof medical personnel, hospitalization costs, overhead costs and cap-\nital costs are collected from key informants in a survey of health\nfacilities. Direct-cost data are gathered on each of the five broad cat-\negories of abortion complications--incomplete abortion, sepsis,\nshock, cervical/vaginal laceration, and uterine laceration/perforation\n(WHO 1999).4 A key feature of PACCM is its coverage of both dir-\nect and indirect costs--overhead and infrastructure costs that, while\nnot direct inputs into the provision of specific treatments, are never-\ntheless necessary for the provision of care in general. Indirect costs,\nin particular, have rarely been estimated in earlier costing studies\n(Vlassoff et al. 2009b). However, PACCM studies show that indir-\nect costs are an important component of total PAC costs. Other\nwork, not related to PAC costs, has also highlighted the importance\nof indirect costs. For example, a United Nations report estimated\nthat in 2009 indirect (also referred to as non-medical) costs made up\ntwo-thirds of total reproductive health costs in Sub-Saharan Africa\n(United Nations, Economic and Social Council 2009).\nEach of the four studies surveyed a sample of health facilities that\nprovide PAC, with a typical sample size of about 40 facilities, rela-\ntively small but considered adequate to represent variation, and hav-\ning the advantage of keeping data-collection costs low. The design of\nthe sample of health facilities takes into account the three dimensions\nof region, facility type and ownership. Within each region-type-own-\nership cell it is assumed that there will be little variation in the cost in-\nputs such as drug dosages or salaries of personnel, making it\nreasonable to select just a few facilities per cell. Major regions of the\ncountry should be included in the design, to the extent that ethnic,\ncultural or socio-economic differences could conceivably affect the\navailability and quality of PAC. Usually three types of facility are\nsampled representing major levels of health care, keeping in mind that\nfacilities with no capacity to provide PAC should not be included.\nFor each of the five post-abortion conditions, PACCM gathers\ndetailed data on labor, drugs, materials and supplies, which to-\ngether make up the direct cost of PAC. The labor component con-\nsists of the salary cost of the time spent treating the patient by all\nhealth workers involved in the patient's care (over the full course\nof a patient's stay). Labor from all medical personnel is accounted\nfor in PACCM, from gynecologists and anesthesiologists, to vari-\nous cadres of nurses, to lab technicians and pharmaceutical staff.\nTypically, specific data on ten or more categories of worker are\ncollected. As medical staff's time is not entirely devoted to provid-\ning care, data are collected on the non-medical time spent by each\ncategory of worker, for example in activities such as meetings,\ntraining, idle time and paperwork. This information is used to ad-\njust upward the contribution of labor to the total cost per PAC\ntreatment.\nThe second major component of direct cost in the PACCM is the\nsum of all inputs of drugs, materials, supplies and lab tests given\nover the course of a particular treatment. The number of inputs is\nquite large, typically in the range 100\u00ad150. For each input used in\nthe treatment of a specific post-abortion complication and inpatient/\noutpatient status, we calculate an average cost by multiplying the\npercent of patients receiving the input by the number of units given\nover the course of treatment. Furthermore, these data are gathered\nseparately for inpatients and outpatients, as the quantity of inputs\ngiven to patients may differ substantially by inpatient/outpatient sta-\ntus. The unit prices of these physical inputs are not collected in the\nPACCM survey itself. Prices of drugs and supplies are obtained both\nfrom a country's state medical procurement and distribution organ-\nization and from several international sources. Other factors influ-\nencing final cost, either positively or negatively, such as spoilage,\nstock-outs, transportation costs and bulk-order discounts are not\nmeasured. The prices of laboratory tests are obtained from a small\nsurvey of private laboratories. The cost of blood, particularly im-\nportant for some complications such as shock, is also obtained\nthrough country-specific efforts.\nIn PACCM two kinds of indirect cost data are collected, covering\ncapital costs and overhead costs. Capital cost include the cost of\nconstruction of facilities as well as the complete cost of equipping\nthe facilities with furniture, vehicles, specialized machines and\nequipment such as X-ray machines and laboratory equipment. Key\ninformants are also asked to estimate the useful lifetime of the facili-\nties. These data, together with an assumed annual rate of inflation,\nallow the annual cost of capital per facility to be calculated.\nThe overhead costs in PACCM comprise all operational and\nother variable costs of health facilities that are not directly related to\nmedical care. Detailed data are gathered on the labor cost of all\nnon-medical staff, as well as annual expenditures for items such as\noutsourced services, administration, maintenance, utilities, insur-\nance and other sundry costs. The number of data points in the\nPACCM questionnaires devoted to overhead items is typically in the\norder of 50\u00ad70 depending largely on the number of identifiable\ncadres in the country's health system.\nTwo questionnaires, one for collection of data on drugs, supplies\nand materials and one for all other inputs, gather information from\nkey informants such as senior health care providers and facility ad-\nministrators. Questionnaire A queries informants on labor costs,\noverhead costs and capital costs associated with the provision of\nPAC in their facilities. First, for each of the five abortion complica-\ntions, the survey gathers data on the percent of cases, on average,\nthat are attended by each type of health worker and the average\nnumber of minutes each worker spends treating or attending the\npatient.\nQuestionnaire A also collects information on the monthly salary\nfor each cadre (including fringe benefits such as health insurance,\npensions, travel allowances, etc.), and the time health personnel\nspend on non-treatment activities such as administrative duties and\nidle time. In order to collect information on the indirect costs, the re-\nspondents are also asked to provide estimates on the useful life of\nthe infrastructure and equipment, the cost of constructing new facili-\nties and a checklist of specific overhead expenses at their facilities.\nQuestionnaire A is also administered to key informants at the cen-\ntral level (e.g. ministries of health or headquarters of faith-based or-\nganizations), as a means of cross-checking information gathered in\nfacilities.\nQuestionnaire B collects detailed information about the kinds\nand quantities of drugs, supplies and materials used for each of the\nfive types of abortion complication. Respondents are requested to\nestimate the percent of patients receiving each input used in treating\neach condition, as well as the quantity of the drug typically\nadministered or the quantity of supplies/materials consumed. This\nquestionnaire also gathers information on laboratory tests per-\nformed. Information about additional drugs or supplies not listed in\nthe questionnaire but still used at the facility to treat complications\nis solicited as well.\nGiven the technical nature of the PACCM questionnaires, the field\npersonnel selected for conducting interviews need to have a fairly high\nlevel of qualifications and/or experience. Recent graduates of master\nprograms in public health or even physicians preparing for internships\nhave been respondents for these four applications of PACCM.\nApproximately one facility can be covered per day because of the\nnumber of interviews and the amount of time needed to collect the\nfull set of data for a facility. Interviews with several health workers\nand administrators are typically required to completely fill out the\ntwo questionnaires and interviews with respondents are often split\ninto two or more sessions to avoid respondent fatigue and also be-\ncause medical personnel need to respond to emergencies as they arise.\nAlthough PACCM basically uses accounting type calculations,\nthe number of dimensions in the data leads to somewhat complex\nformulae. Computing the cost of labor can be summarized by the\nfollowing three equations.\nLi;j;k\n\u00bc Sk\n\u00c2 Mi;j;k\n\u00c2 Pi;j;k\n\u00c2 Ai;k\nwhere Li;j;k\nis the unit cost of labor in facility type i, for treating one\npatient with complication j by cadre k, Sk\nis the salary per minute of\ncadre k, Mi;j;k\nis the treatment minutes spent in facility type i, for\ncomplication j of cadre k, Pi;j;k\nis the percent of cases of complica-\ntion j which are attended to by cadre k in facility type i, Ai;k\nis the\nadjustment factor (for non-treatment work time) in facility type i,\nfor cadre k, i is the ith type of facility, i \u00bc 1 to I, j is the jth type of\nabortion complication, j \u00bc 1\u00ad5, k is the kth type of cadre (category\nof health worker), k \u00bc 1\u00adK and Kis the number of cadres.\nAi;k\nNTi;k\n \nwhere NTi;k\nis the percent of non-treatment work time in facility\ntype i, for cadre k.\nLT \u00bc\nX\nXi\n\u00c2\nX\nYj\n\u00c2\nX\nLi;j;k\n@\nA\nwhere LT is the total cost of labor, Xi\nis the number of facilities of\ntype i and Yj\nis the proportion of cases that are complications of\ntype j.\nComputing the cost of drugs, supplies and materials is given by\nthe following two equations.\nDi;j;k\n\u00bc Ci\n\u00c2 Bi;j;k\n\u00c2 Qi;j;k\nwhere Di;j;k\nis the cost of input i, to treat complication j, under service\nk, Ci\nis the price per unit of input i, Bi;j;k\nis the percent of patients with\ncomplication j who receive input i, under service k, Qi;j;k\nis the number\nof units of input i, for complication j, under service k, i is the ith input\n(drug, supply, material), i\u00bc 1\u00adI, j is the jth type of abortion\ncomplication, j\u00bc 1\u00ad5, k is the kth type of service (inpatient, outpatient),\nk\u00bc 1\u00ad2, I is the number of inputs and K is the number of services (\u00bc2).\nDT \u00bc\nX\nFj\n\u00c2\nX\nX\nDi;j;k\n\u00c2 Ek\n@\nwhere DT is the total cost of drugs, supplies and materials, Ek\nis the\nproportion of patients using service k and Fj\nis the proportion of pa-\ntients suffering from complication j.\nThe annual per-facility capital cost for PAC by type of facility is\ncomputed as follows:\nKi\n\u00bc Ai\n\u00c2 Gi\n\u00c2\nVi\nwhere Ki\nis the annual capital cost needed to treat one PAC case in\none facility of type i, Ai\nis the annual amortized cost of capital per\nyear of useful life in one facility of type i, Gi\nis the proportion of the\nfacility's cases that are PAC cases in one facility of type i, Vi\nis the\nnumber of PAC cases per year in one facility of type i and i is the ith\ntype of facility.\nFor amortization, a constant rate of inflation of 3% per annum\nis assumed.\nThe total per-facility overhead cost for each facility type is calcu-\nlated as:\n\u00bc\nX\nUi;j\n\u00fe\nX\n\u00c2 NOi;k\nwhere TOi\nis the total overhead cost of one facility of type i, Ui;j\nis\nthe annual cost of overhead cost j in facility type i, SOk\nis the annual\nsalary of non-medical cadre k, NOi;k\nis the number of workers in\ncadre k in one facility of type i, J is the number of types of non-labor\noverhead expenditure, K is the number of non-medical cadres and i\nis the ith type of facility.\nOi\n\u00bc TOi\n\u00c4 Vi\nwhere Oi\nis the annual overhead cost needed to treat one PAC case\nin facility type i, Vi\nis the annual number of PAC cases attended to\nin one facility of type i and i is the ith type of facility.\nResults\nComparison of four studies that applied the PACCM\nmethodology\nAlthough some details of the PACCM methodology changed from\nstudy to study, the broad similarity among the four studies allows us\nto compare their findings and to make wider generalizations.

Colombia\nalso widened access to abortion in 2006 as the result of a ruling by\nthe Constitutional Court of Colombia (Prada et al. 2011). As seen in\nTable 1, Uganda has a very high abortion rate--one of the world's\nhighest--while Ethiopia and Rwanda exhibit more moderate abor-\ntion rates. Colombia's abortion rate of 39 induced abortions per\nundergoing induced abortion were treated for post-abortion compli-\ncations in Uganda, Rwanda and Colombia, but only 14% in\nEthiopia. This proportion depends on two factors: the proportion of\ninduced abortions that result in complications that need medical\ncare in a facility (which in turn depends on the number of abortions\ncarried out in unsafe conditions) and the proportion of women with\nsuch complications who are able to access facility-based care. One\nor both of these factors likely play a role in the low proportion\nobserved in Ethiopia.\nThe reported distributions of types of post-abortion complica-\ntions (Table 1) show some variation among the four countries.\nIncomplete abortion, the least severe of the five complications ana-\nlyzed, makes up > 85% of all post-abortion complications in\nColombia, but only a little over 60% of them in Uganda.\nConversely, perforations of the uterus, the most serious complica-\ntion, are almost absent in Colombia but comprise around 3% of all\ncomplications in Uganda. In general, the severity burden is highest\nin Uganda and lowest in Colombia. Ethiopia and Rwanda fall in be-\ntween these two extremes.\nThe four studies are all based on survey data collected from PAC\nproviders and administrators at health facilities. In Rwanda and\nUganda the selection of facilities (39 facilities in each case) gave the\ndata collected a national coverage. In Colombia, 30 facilities were\nselected from all five major regions of the country, but were limited\nto the largest urban centers in each region. In Ethiopia, due to\nbudget restrictions, only 14 facilities were sampled, all of them ei-\nther in the capital city, Addis Ababa, or in neighboring districts. As\nsuch, the findings of the Ethiopian study are not necessarily repre-\nsentative of the whole country. Despite these differences among the\nfour studies, the commonality of the methodology allows us to ex-\nplore variations in treatment inputs to gain a better understanding\nof PAC cost drivers.\nLabor inputs\nThe labor cost of health personnel who are directly involved in treat-\ning patients is a major component of PAC costs. The labor input is\nmade up of several components: the composition of the health\ncadres, the composition of complications, the amount of time spent\nwith patients, the salaries and benefits paid to health personnel and\nthe proportions of their work time actually spent in treating pa-\ntients. Table 2 shows some of these labor input components for five\ngroupings of health workers. (Personnel not directly involved in\nmedical treatment of patients are dealt with below as part of indirect\ncosts.) In the first panel of the table, the average amount of time\nspent with patients during treatment at health facilities is compared\nacross the four countries for the five health cadres. These estimates\nare weighted averages for the five types of complication. Two pat-\nterns are evident: in Ethiopia and Colombia doctors spend about\n30\u00ad60% more time with PAC patients than do nurses; in Uganda\ntients than do doctors.7 These latter countries seem to be more suc-\ncessful at task shifting, although a relative shortage of doctors may\nalso play a part. Also noteworthy is the greater involvement of tech-\nnical personnel, mainly lab technicians, in Colombia (157 min) com-\npared to the three African countries (<40 min on average). As an\neconomically more developed country, one may speculate that more\ndiagnostic tests are routinely performed.\nSalary structures (second panel of Table 2) show large differ-\nences among the four countries. For all cadres of health personnel,\nalmost without exception, Ugandan salaries are the lowest and\nColombian the highest, keeping in mind that they are shown here in\ninternational dollars, which equalizes purchasing power across the\nfour countries. Compared to Uganda, Ethiopian health workers are\nabout 1.8 times more expensive, Rwandan workers twice as expen-\nsive and Colombian workers almost six times more costly.\nAnother hard-to-measure component of labor cost is the adjust-\nment that needs to be made for non-treatment time spent by health\nproviders (third panel, Table 2). Overall, the four studies estimated\nthat 10% of work time is spent in non-treatment activities such as\npaperwork, attending meetings and idle time. The proportion of\nnon-treatment time is lowest among doctors (2\u00ad6% in three coun-\ntries although much higher in Uganda at 18%), likely because of the\nTable 2.

Levels are also lower than average for the least qualified\ncadre of health workers (5\u00ad7% among auxiliary nurses)--possibly\nbecause this group has less involvement in meetings and lower\nresponsibilities for paperwork. However, since non-treatment time\nis likely to be under-reported in studies without time-motion obser-\nvation, this component of labor cost is almost certainly\nunderestimated.\nThe fourth panel of Table 2 combines all the above cost compo-\nnents into estimates of labor costs per PAC case. These range from\na much higher level in Colombia (I$301.30). Technical personnel\nand counselors in Colombia are relatively costly components of\nlabor costs (being 3.3 times more than the four-country average),\nwhile nurses are relatively less expensive (1.7 times the average\ncost). Also noteworthy, doctors comprise 67% of the total labor\ncost in Ethiopia but only 38% of it in Rwanda. Conversely, nurses\ncontribute 30% to direct labor costs in Ethiopia but 49% in\nRwanda. The contribution of technical cadres (such as lab techni-\ncian, sonographer, etc.) to labor costs is striking: in Ethiopia it\namounts to only 2%, while in Colombia it accounts for 14% of\nlabor costs.\nDrugs/supplies inputs\nThe second major component of direct costs is the set of physical in-\nputs that are consumed in PAC treatments. These include drugs,\nmedical supplies and materials as well as laboratory tests and pro-\ncedures such as sonograms. Costs per PAC case for these inputs for\nthe four countries, broken down by type of treatment, are shown in\nthe upper panel of Table 3. The average cost of drugs and supplies is\nlowest in Colombia (I$79) and highest in Rwanda (I$115). In gen-\neral, cost differentials between countries are not large, compared to\ndifferences in labor costs, and it is particularly notable that they are\nlowest in Colombia, on a purchasing power parity basis.\nPurely in terms of costs, Colombia does well in treatment of\ncases of incomplete abortion, which comprise the large majority of\nPAC cases, spending only I$41 per patient on drugs, supplies and\ntests, compared to I$116 spent in Rwanda and I$100 in Ethiopia.\nOn the other hand, treating patients with shock in Colombia is more\nthan ten times more costly (I$645) compared to Ethiopia where only\nI$62 is spent on physical inputs. However, from these data it is not\npossible to tell how far these differences reflect efficiencies in treat-\nment--they may also indicate scarcity in availability of drugs, sup-\nplies and lab tests in lower-income settings.8 Overall, PAC in\nColombia requires the least expensive bundle of physical inputs\n(I$79) compared to an average expenditure of I$93 across the four\ncountries. Drilling down into the data on laboratory tests confirms\nthis finding. For example, in Colombia patients being treated for in-\ncomplete abortion are given 0.3 hemoglobin tests and 0.3 white\nblood cell tests on average, whereas in Rwanda and Uganda such pa-\ntients are given between 1.0 and 1.4 tests.\nIndirect costs\nThe four studies also collected data on indirect costs to the health\nsystem of PAC. The data in Ethiopia, however, were later judged to\nbe deficient and were not reported on. Table 4 summarizes the re-\nsults for three components of indirect costs: capital costs (the amor-\ntized annual cost of infrastructure construction and capital\nequipment), non-medical labor costs (the cost of personnel not dir-\nectly involved in medical treatment) and operational costs (the cost\nof maintenance, utilities, etc.). In Colombia it was not possible to\nseparate the latter two overhead components, so the estimate of\nI$517 includes both combined. This estimate is several times greater\nthan overhead costs in either Uganda (I$57) or Rwanda (I$97). On\nthe other hand, the estimate of the annual amortized cost of capital\nis substantially higher in Uganda (I$213) than in Rwanda or\nColombia. It constitutes 52% of the total cost per case in Uganda,\ncompared to 16% in Rwanda and only 10% in Colombia.\nTotal cost per PAC case\nTable 4 summarizes the six cost components identified in these stud-\nies and presents their estimates of the total cost per PAC case in\ninternational dollar terms. At I$972, the cost of treating unsafe\nabortion in the Colombian health system is by far the costliest. Keep\nin mind, however, that indirect costs were not calculated in the\nEthiopian study. If indirect costs were taken to be the average per-\ncentage of total costs across the other three studies (61%), the total\ncost per case in Ethiopia would amount to I$345, in between the\nUganda and Rwanda estimates. Using this estimate for Ethiopia, the\naverage cost per case across the three Sub-Saharan African countries\nis I$362. Labor and overhead are the major cost drivers in\nColombia (together they constitute 81% of the total cost), but less\nimportant in Uganda and Rwanda (22% and 46% respectively).\nThe costs of drugs/supplies and the cost of capital, on the other\nhand, seem to be more important drivers of PAC costs in African\nsettings.\nPAC is costly on a per capita basis as seen in the last panel of\nTable 4. Treating a single PAC patient costs the equivalent of 11%\nof the annual GDP per capita in Colombia and an astounding 35%\nin Ethiopia and Uganda. Regardless of who pays and what subsidies\nexist, fully one third of the average annual productive output on one\nindividual goes to offset the cost of to treating one PAC patient in\nEthiopia and Uganda. When we compare cost per PAC case to the\naverage annual expenditure in health, the financial burden of unsafe\nabortion is put into even starker relief. Treatment for one episode of\npost-abortion morbidity consumes more than three times the annual\nper capita expenditure on health in Uganda and more than five times\nin Ethiopia. Even in Colombia, expenditure on one PAC case\nis > 100% the average annual per capita spending on health.\nTable 3.

In countries where abortion is legal or admin-\nistratively permitted such as Colombia or Ethiopia, the differences\nin costs are worth noting: the average PAC cost per client in\nColombia is I$972 versus an average cost of a safe abortion9 of\n(abortion procedure).10 A global study of all developing countries\nestimated that the average cost per PAC case was more than twice\nthe average cost of safe abortion procedures . (Singh et al. 2014)\nIn many developing countries such a comparison cannot be\nmade because abortion is illegal for the most part. Pregnancies may\nbe terminated by induced abortion, but most unintended pregnan-\ncies can be prevented from occurring by using an effective method\nof family planning. In Table 4 (lower panel) we present estimated\ntotal one-year costs of contraception for the four PACCM countries,\nusing data from the latest edition of the Adding It Up study. (Singh\ncompared to the PAC costs in Table 4, one sees a great advantage to\npreventing unwanted pregnancies through family planning over\ntreating post-abortion complications, which costs health systems\nFinally, it is worth comparing the cost of PAC to the cost of ma-\nternal and newborn health (MNH) in general, since PAC is one com-\nponent of MNH. The national cost of MNH in Uganda (without\naround I$990 million. The annual national cost of PAC in Uganda\nMNH total (Vlassoff et al. 2014a). On a per case basis, however, an\naverage PAC case cost I$394 to treat. A similar comparison can be\nmade for Ethiopia using estimates from Sundaram et al. (2010) and\nsomewhat >3% of national MNH costs (annually I$54 million and\nI$1.6 billion, respectively). On the other hand, per case costs were\nDiscussion\nIn the developing world abortion is still largely prohibited, except\nfor narrow legal indications and is still heavily stigmatized.\nResearch in this subject area is thus fraught with difficulties in gath-\nering reliable and complete data. Data on the cost of medical care to\ntreat abortions complications are likewise scarce. However, more\nstudies of the cost of PAC have recently become available, four of\nwhich apply a standardized methodology and well-specified descrip-\ntions of the cost components analyzed--two important factors that\nwill allow us to use these four studies to begin building a body of\ncomparable costing estimates.\nWhile research into the cost of PAC is beginning to attract more\nattention, important gaps still remain. The most thorough studies\navailable, national-level studies from Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda\nand Colombia, estimated average costs per PAC case of I$345,\nestimated an overall average of I$414 per PAC case (Shearer et al.\n(Table 5) found that the average cost per PAC case was I$347 for\nseven studies that included both direct and indirect costs. Thus, a\nbody of consistent cost estimates is emerging. As for regional differ-\nences in PAC costs, a comparison of the four PACCM studies shows\nthe cost of PAC to be substantially higher in Colombia than in the\nthree African countries, but this may not be generally true of the\nLatin American region since earlier regional estimates showed little\ndifference between African and Latin American average costs per\nous estimates suggest that spending on PAC is an important finan-\ncial burden. In the four PACCM countries, the cost of treating one\npost-abortion patient is considerable: around 35% of annual per\ncapita income in Uganda, 29% in Rwanda and 11% in Colombia.\nThis burden is particularly acute in Uganda where facility-based\ntreatment for one PAC patient costs the equivalent of four month's\nincome for an average person.\nTable 4.

They are, however, included in any averages\nderived from this table.\n**This study was inadvertently omitted from the earlier review of literature (Vlassoff et al. 2009b; Shearer et al. 2010) as it appeared to be the same study as\nthe one reported in Koontz et al. (2003).\nThe increasing use of medication (typically misoprostol) in treat-\ning incomplete abortion, the least severe and most common type of\ncomplication, will probably lead to lower PAC costs in the future.\nStudies citing costs of specific post-abortion treatments indicate that\nusing medication for treating incomplete abortion may be only one-\nsixth as expensive as MVA (Foster-Rosales et al. 2003; Hu et al.\n2010). A model-based study of abortion costs in Uganda found that\ntask shifting could also reduce PAC costs. For instance, the study\ncalculated that by instituting a suite of cost-saving measures, includ-\ning task shifting and use of lower-level facilities when appropriate\nfor the treatment of particular types of post-abortion complications,\ncosts would be reduced by around 45% (Johnston et al. 2007).\nThe wide variation in labor costs (both medical and non-medical\npersonnel) seen in the four PACCM studies also point to operational\nefficiencies which could be made in PAC delivery by sharing experi-\nences across countries. This is particularly the case for Colombia,\nwhere doctor salaries are as much as seven times the salaries of their\nAfrican counterparts, even after adjusting for purchasing power.\nTask-shifting should be considered in Colombia as well as measures\nto reduce the total amount of time that medical personnel spend on\nthe various treatments. On the other hand, the study showed little\nvariation in overall expenditure on physical inputs and hence offers\nno lessons to be learned for this cost component. We found that\noverhead costs in Colombia were far above those of the three\nAfrican countries. While it is beyond the scope of this study to\nspeculate on the causes of this large disparity, there does seem to be\nscope for cost-cutting measures in the case of non-treatment expend-\nitures in Colombia.\nOne important policy response to high levels of unsafe abortion\nis to attack its root cause, unintended pregnancy, by promoting fam-\nily planning. Around 40% of all pregnancies in developing countries\nare unintended and almost half of all these unintended pregnancies\nare terminated by abortion (Sedgh et al. 2014). At the same time,\nsubstantial rates of unmet need for contraception are reported in vir-\ntually all developing countries (Sedgh and Hussain 2014). In the\nthree African PACCM countries, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Uganda,\nthe latest findings on unmet need are 26, 34 and 21% of all women\nof reproductive ages (ICF International 2012). In Colombia, by con-\ntrast, where fertility decline has reached replacement level, unmet\nneed stands at 8%. Providing modern methods of contraception to\nwomen with an unmet need for contraception would greatly reduce\nunintended pregnancies (except for a small number of pregnancies\nthat would occur due to contraceptive method failure). The cost of\ndoing so is just a fraction of the cost of PAC: in Ethiopia one year of\nmodern contraceptive services and supplies is equal to 12% of the\naverage cost of treating a PAC patient, in Rwanda 9%, in Uganda\n7% and in Colombia 3%.11 Preventing unintended pregnancies\nwould not only reduce health systems cost of PAC and the cost of\nabortion procurement to women and households, but would also\nbring great health benefits in the form of lower maternal morbidity\nand mortality, better infant health and broader intergenerational im-\nprovement. In the four countries with PACCM studies, providing\ncontraceptive services for one year to a woman or couple cost only\nabout one tenth as much as the cost of treating one PAC patient. It\nis our hope that the cost estimates provided in this article will stimu-\nlate policy discussion around these health issues.\nIn its latest report on unsafe abortion the World Health\nOrganization estimates that 13% of maternal deaths are caused by\nunsafe abortion (WHO 2011). Policies that reduce unsafe abortion\ntherefore are also important in efforts to lower maternal mortality\nand morbidity. One line of attack is to advocate for more liberal\nabortion laws. Even with a more liberal legal framework in place\nhowever, persistent value systems and the continued stigmatization\nof induced abortion may result in large proportions of abortions tak-\ning place clandestinely and under unsafe conditions. In Bangladesh,\nfor example, even after more than three decades of national cover-\nage by the government-supported menstrual regulation12 program,\nabout half of all pregnancy terminations are still via the procure-\nment of (illegal) induced abortion rather than through legal men-\nWhile the PACCM methodology is able to generate reasonably\nprecise costing estimates with an inexpensive data-collection budget,\nthe approach has some limitations. One drawback has already been\nalluded to: The PACCM method itself has evolved from the pioneer-\ning Ethiopian study through to the most recent Colombian one,\nwith new refinements being added to each of its applications. For\nexample, the indirect costs module proved to be inadequately speci-\nfied in Ethiopia, so the estimates of indirect costs were ultimately\ndiscarded from the Ethiopian study. The evolution of the method\nhas meant that the ability to compare results across studies is some-\nwhat restricted. Another limitation of PACCM is that for the most\npart the data are based on expert opinion. Hence, results are less\nprecise than if an intensive (but costly) case-based approach were\nused. A third limitation concerns the inherent difficulty in gathering\ndata on abortion. In each of the four countries, we were able to rely\non the results of existing studies of the incidence of induced abor-\ntion. Even so, some uncertainty exists around questions such as the\npercentage distribution of post-abortion complications, the propor-\ntion of women with post-abortion complications that do not or can-\nnot access the health system and the split between induced and\nspontaneous abortions.\nThe PACCM methodology has provided health policy analysts\nwith the first national-level comprehensive estimates of the cost of\nPAC to health systems. It has been applied in a variety of contexts\nand is a comparatively inexpensive tool for obtaining policy-relevant\ninformation on the cost of PAC. Incremental improvements to the\nmethodology will continue to be made in future work, for instance\nby addressing the problem of interviewer fatigue in filling out long,\ntedious questionnaires. Replacing hard-copy questionnaires with\ninteractive input software using laptop computers would be a useful\nimprovement in this area. The consistency of results using PACCM\ngives confidence that further applications of the methodology would\nlead to an even more solid measurement and understanding of PAC\ncosts in developing countries.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by an anonymous foundation donor.\nConflict of interest statement.

We use the WHO definition of unsafe abortion: `a pro-\ncedure for terminating an unintended pregnancy performed\nby persons lacking the necessary skills, in an environment\nthat does not conform to minimal medical standards, or\nboth.' (WHO 2011) It follows from this definition that\nmost post-abortion complications are the result of unsafe\nabortions.\ndifficulty in obtaining abortion-related data and the ten-\ndency to under-report abortion-related deaths, the upper\nestimate is probably the more accurate one.\n3.

These in-\nclude the lodging and meals aspect of hospitalization and\nfees charged for specific services. These costs amounted to\n3\u00ad5% of per case PAC costs in the three African coun-\ntries (Table 4).\n9. In Colombia, almost all of the small number of safe\nabortions recorded in official statistics use the D&C\nprocedure.\n(Vlassoff et al. 2012), data were collected on the cost of\none abortion procedure, manual vacuum aspiration, the\nprocedure that was generally used at that time for safe\nabortions. Although the sample of facilities was not se-\nlected randomly, nor was it nationally representative, de-\ntailed information on the costs of inputs were collected\nfrom 14 health facilities in both in-patient and out-patient\nsettings. For 2008, the direct cost of abortion procedures\n(MVAs) was estimated at USD 26.50. In terms of interna-\ntional dollars in 2012, the average cost of an abortion\nprocedure was I$109. The total cost per procedure (direct\nand indirect costs) was estimated to be I$190.\n11. For example, the total family planning bill to satisfy un-\nmet need for contraception in Rwanda would be around\nI$21.6 million, while the total PAC bill would amount to\nI$7.5 million. Another I$2.9 million would be saved by\naverting abortion procedures. This, of course, is a very in-\ncomplete cost comparison since so many other benefits, in\nterms of health and finance, would accrue to lowering the\nlevel of unmet need for contraception--for instance, all\nthe mother and newborn care costs saved by averting un-\nintended childbirth. Data on cost of contraception are\n12. Menstrual regulation (MR) has been part of Bangladesh's\nnational family planning program since 1979.
