We estimate that the number of\nhospitalization for injection drug use\u00adrelated infective en-\ndocarditis increased by 38%\u00ad66% in the United States be-\nnumber of at-risk persons (i.e., injection drug users) re-\nmained stable. Increasing methamphetamine use and/or\ndrug injection frequency may have increased the incidence\nof infective endocarditis among active injection drug users.\nInfective endocarditis (IE) is a potentially fatal consequence of\ninjecting illicit drugs, such as heroin, cocaine, and metham-\nphetamine [1]. Injection drug use (IDU) can increase IE risk\nthrough a variety of mechanisms. Drug solutions may contain\nparticulate matter (e.g., talc) that damage cardiac valves if in-\njected intravenously [1]. In addition, poor injection hygiene\n(e.g., lack of skin cleaning before injecting), injecting with un-\nsterile equipment, and injecting contaminated drug solutions\ncan introduce high circulating bacterial loads [1]. Finally, the\nphysiologic effects of specific drugs may increase IE risk. For\nexample, the prevalence of IE is high among persons who inject\ncocaine, and researchers and clinicians have partially attributed\nthis elevated prevalence to the vasospasm and cardiac tissue\ndamage that cocaine induces [1]. We report on a nationwide\nincrease in the number of hospitalizations for IDU-related IE\na Present affiliation: Department of Behavioral Sciences and Health Education, Rollins\nSchool of Public Health, Atlanta, Georgia.\nReprints or correspondence: Dr. Hannah Cooper, Dept. of Behavioral Sciences and Health\n(hcoope3@sph.emory.edu).\n 2007 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

We identified cases of IDU-related IE that oc-\nControl and Prevention National Hospital Discharge Survey\ndatabase (NHDS) [2]. The Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention designed NHDS to produce nationally representa-\ntive annual data on hospitalizations in non-Federal, short-term\ncare facilities with 6 beds [3]. Annually, NHDS captures\nand Washington, DC [3]. For each case, NHDS records patient\nsociodemographic characteristics, medical data (including up\nto 7 diagnoses and 4 procedures, coded using the International\nClassification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification\nsystem), and administrative items [3].\nThe International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision,\nClinical Modification system does not specify whether cases of\nIE are IDU related. Drawing on past efforts to identify cases\nof IDU-related IE in hospitalization data [4], we developed 2\nalgorithms to identify cases of interest in NHDS, using data\non patient diagnoses, procedures, and sociodemographic char-\nacteristics; we designed one algorithm to be specific and the\nother to be sensitive. The specific algorithm classified cases in\nthe database as IDU-related IE if the individual met each of\nthe following criteria: (1) the patient received a diagnosis of\nbacterial endocarditis or endocarditis that was not otherwise\nspecified; (2) the patient's medical record included a diagnosis\nor procedure indicating the use of a commonly injected illicit\ndrug (e.g., cocaine, heroin, or methamphetamine); diagnoses\nincluded opioid-, cocaine-, and amphetamine-related depen-\ndence, use, poisoning, or accidental death; and procedures in-\ncluded drug addiction counseling, detoxification, and rehabil-\nitation; (3) the patient was 16\u00ad64 years of age when hospitalized\n(an age category that captures the majority of IDUs and ex-\ncludes seniors, a group that is particularly susceptible to bac-\nterial infections irrespective of injection status [5]); and (4) the\npatient had no documented conditions or procedures per-\nformed that predispose to IE (e.g., prosthetic valve or device,\nrheumatic or congenital heart disease, cardiac cathetherization,\nor dialysis).\nNotably, this algorithm will misclassify cases of IDU-related\nIE as noncases in instances in which patients conceal their drug\nuse from hospital staff. Therefore, we constructed a second,\nmore sensitive algorithm to capture these hidden users; as with\nall sensitive measures, this algorithm will capture more cases\nthan the specific algorithm at the expense of misclassifyingsome\nTable 1.

Data are weighted using NHDS survey weights to create national estimates. Period 1 was from\nnoncases as cases. On the basis of the epidemiology of IE [6],\nwe designed the sensitive algorithm to capture individuals who\nreceived diagnoses of bacterial endocarditis and met criteria 3\nand 4 but did not necessarily meet criterion 2. However, pa-\ntients who received a diagnosis of endocarditis that was not\notherwise specified had to meet criteria 2, 3, and 4 to be clas-\nsified as having a case of IDU-related IE in the sensitive al-\ngorithm. (We considered including a diagnosis of hepatitis C\nvirus infection in both the sensitive and the specific algorithms\nas another means of identifying IDUs, because hepatitis C virus\ninfection is common among IDUs and is relatively rare among\nnon-IDUs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's\nhepatitis C virus testing guidelines, however, broadened sub-\nstantially in 1998 [12]; therefore, we decided against this mod-\nification. Given increased testing over time, classifying hepatitis\nC virus\u00adpositive individuals as IDUs would have artificially\ninflated temporal trends in the number of IDU-related IE cases\ndetected.)\nThe number of cases of IDU-related IE that were identified\nby each algorithm was weighted to reflect the US population,\nusing NHDS survey weights. We aggregated results into 2-year\nThe x2 test was used to identify temporal changes in the number\nof IDU-related IE hospital discharges. Specifically, for every pair\nof consecutive periods, we tested whether the observed number\nof hospital discharges occurring during each period differed\nfrom the expected number; the expected number for each pe-\nriod was calculated as one-half of the sum of the number of\nIDU-related IE hospital discharges during 2 consecutive peri-\nods. Because HIV-related immunosuppression increases IE risk\n[7] and new therapies reducing HIV-related immunosuppres-\nsion emerged during the study period [7], we present results\nstratified by the HIV infection or AIDS status of the patients.\nResults. Both the specific and sensitive algorithms suggest\nthat the number of IDU-related IE hospital discharges nation-\nble 1), with slight to moderate fluctuations in the number of\nthese discharges during earlier periods. According to the specific\ncharges nationwide during periods 1\u00ad3. In contrast, during\nperiod 4, the specific algorithm captured 9113 such dis-\ncharges--an increase of 66.0% over period 3. According to the\nhospital discharges nationwide during periods 1\u00ad3. The sen-\nsitive algorithm captured 24,025 such discharges during period\n4--an increase of 38.4% over period 3. The x2 test indicates\nthat the number of discharges varied between each consecutive\nperiod, with 1 exception (the number of cases captured by the\nsensitive algorithm was statically identical for periods 1 and 2).\nA qualitative review of these data indicates that the change of\ngreatest magnitude occurred between periods 3 and 4 for both\nalgorithms. Notably, the number of IDU-related IE hospital\ndischarges among people with HIV infection or AIDS decreased\nsubstantially during the study period (table 1).\nDiscussion. Both algorithms indicate substantial increases\nin the number of hospital discharges for IDU-related IE na-\ntionwide between periods 3 and 4. To our knowledge, this is\nthe first time such a trend in IDU-related IE has been reported\nnationwide, although another study reported an increase in\nsuch hospitalizations in New York City during the period 1996\u00ad\nPossible causes of the observed nationwide increase merit\nconsideration. First, it is unlikely that the observed increase is\nan artifact of changing IE diagnostic criteria. The Duke criteria\nhave been the standard diagnostic tool for IE since 1994 [8].\nModifications proposed to the Duke criteria in 2000 likely pro-\nduced greater diagnostic specificity with little change in sen-\nsitivity among IDUs [8].\nSecond, available data indicate that the increase in the num-\nber of IDU-related IE hospitalizations was not produced by an\nincrease in the size of the at-risk population (i.e., IDUs). An\nongoing National Institute on Drug Abuse\u00adfunded study sug-\ngests that the number of past-year IDUs nationwide remained\nrelatively constant during the study period (unpublished data\nfrom the Community Vulnerability and Response to IDU-\nThird, the observed increase in the number of IDU-related\nIE does not appear to be a function of increasing prevalence\nof 2 factors associated with IE among active IDUs: HIV-related\nimmunosuppression and cocaine injection. We found that cases\nof IDU-related IE among patients with HIV infection or AIDS\ndecreased markedly during the study period--a finding con-\nsonant with past research that may reflect the advent of HAART\nand HIV-positive individuals' improved access to addiction\ntreatment [7]. Likewise, drug treatment admissions data, which\nare often used as a marker of population trends in substance\nuse, indicate that the number of treatment admissions of per-\nsons who injected cocaine was relatively stable during periods\nGiven the rising prevalence of community-acquired methi-\ncillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection in the United\nStates, we investigated whether this bacterium might have con-\ntributed to the observed increase in the number of IDU-related\nIE hospital discharges. Our analyses indicate that, although\ncodiagnoses of community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. au-\nreus infection among IDU-related IE hospital discharges indeed\nincreased during the study period, this increase did not coincide\nwith the increase in IDU-related IE hospital dischargesobserved\nhere.\nPossibly, the increase in the number of IDU-related IE is\npart of a broader increase in the number of IE overall, partic-\nularly given recent increases in the number of people who are\nvulnerable to IE (e.g., elderly individuals and people with pros-\nthetic valves) [6]. Our algorithms, however, excluded such vul-\nnerable populations, and we suspect that, because of distinct\ncausal mechanisms, the incidence of IDU-related IE follows a\ndifferent temporal trend from that of non-IDU-related IE [1].\nBy reviewing (1) the known causes of IDU-related IE and\n(2) documented changes occurring during the study period in\nthe contexts in which IDUs use drugs, we identified the mech-\nanisms that may have recently increased the incidence of IE\namong active IDUs. First, increasing methamphetamine use\nmay be such a mechanism, because drug treatment admissions\nof persons who currently use methamphetamine increased na-\nMethamphetamine use (regardless of the mode of administra-\ntion) induces a host of cardiac complications that are similar\nto those induced by cocaine, including vasospasm and injury\nto the myocardial surface [10]. Hypothetically, methamphet-\namine injection may increase IE risk through pathophysiologic\nmechanisms similar to those proposed for cocaine. A second\nmechanism may be increasing injection frequency among her-\noin injectors. The mean price of heroin decreased by 40%, from\n[11]. Dramatic price decreases may have allowed increased in-\njection frequency among individuals who were already injecting\nheroin. Increased injection frequency provides more oppor-\ntunity to introduce skin flora into the circulatory system.\nThe primary limitation of our study was the absence of codes\ndenoting IDU in the International Classification of Disease,\nNinth Revision, Clinical Modification system. We addressed this\nlimitation by constructing 2 algorithms to identify cases of\ninterest; one was designed to be specific, and the other was\ndesigned to be sensitive. Both algorithms suggest that IDU-\nrelated IE hospital discharges increased during the period 2002\u00ad\n2003--a concordance that reveals convergent validity.\nResearch regarding whether the 2 mechanisms proposed\nabove or other mechanisms (acting alone or in combination)\nhave produced the observed increase in the number of IDU-\nrelated IE cases is needed so that effective interventions can be\nestablished to stem IE among IDUs. Meanwhile, organizations\nserving IDUs could educate IDUs and health care providers\nabout IE symptoms, so that affected individuals could obtain\nmedical care as early as possible.\n"
