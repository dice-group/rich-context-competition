Although much attention and ef-\nfort have been directed to measuring,\nunderstanding, and preventing ad-\nverse drug events (ADEs) in hospital-\nized patients,7,8 less attention has been\nfocused on ADEs occurring outside of\nhealth care facilities.

A\nsecondary clinical outcome was ADE\nseverity as measured by the need for\nhospitalization following ED evalua-\ntion. Hospitalization includes admis-\nsion to an inpatient unit of that facil-\nity, admission to the ED for observation,\nor transfer to another facility for acute\nmedical care. NEISS data, including\nADE data, are not used for national es-\ntimates of deaths. Details about event\ncircumstances are often lacking when\npatients are dead on arrival or die soon\nafter arrival in the ED, and such cases\nare incompletely captured across ED\nrecord systems. Therefore, deaths from\nADEs occurring in the out-of-hospital\nsetting, in the ED, or after hospital ad-\nmission are not reported.\nData Analysis\nTo describe the magnitude and epide-\nmiologyofADEstreatedinEDs,weclas-\nsified ADEs by patient, event, and drug\ncharacteristics.

For ex-\nample, some ED-based studies have in-\ncluded drug abuse, suicide attempts,\nnoncomplianceornonadherence,thera-\npeutic failures of drugs or inadequate\ndrug therapy, and adverse events from\ndrugs given during ED visits.33 Other\nstudies of outpatient ADEs have mea-\nsured a range of outcomes including pa-\ntient self-reported symptoms,34 poten-\ntial ADEs,35 and assessments of\nseverity.31 Nevertheless,studiesofsingle\nEDs30 and studies of ADEs in a local\nMedicare population36 have found simi-\nlar types of adverse effects and impli-\ncated many of the same drugs and drug\nclasses. Zhan et al37 recently analyzed\ndata from one source of nationally rep-\nresentative outpatient ADE data, the\nNational Hospital Ambulatory Medi-\ncal Care Survey (NHAMCS), and re-\nported a similar rate of ED visits for\nsis was limited to pooled data for a\n6-year study period to describe pa-\ntient characteristics and broad drug cat-\negories based on International Classifi-\ncation of Diseases coding.\nNEISS-CADES has several advan-\ntages compared with other sources\nof ADE information. Because\nNEISS-CADES collects data from a\nnationally representative sample of\nhospital EDs, data are not subject to\nthe questions of generalizability as\nare data collected from single institu-\ntions or single geographic areas.30\nMoreover, compared with many\nresearch studies and population sur-\nveys, NEISS-CADES data collection\nis timely, with preliminary data typi-\ncally available within several weeks\nof the ED visit.13 NEISS-CADES data\ncollection is ongoing, enabling trend\nmonitoring and evaluation of\nnational safety interventions not pos-\nsible with research studies that typi-\ncally have defined study periods. In\naddition, although NEISS-CADES\nrecently began operation, it will\nlikely be less susceptible than volun-\ntary reporting systems to variations\nin reporting rates over time,38 just as\nthe parent surveillance system,\nNEISS, has produced stable estimates\nof consumer product-related injuries\nAdverse drug event surveillance with\nNEISS-CADES has several limitations\nthat likely result in an underestimate\nof the outpatient ADE burden. First,\nNEISS-CADES is restricted to ED pa-\ntients. Cases of ADEs diagnosed and\ntreated in other settings (eg, primary\ncare offices, non\u00adhospital-based ur-\ngent care centers, or directly admitted\nto hospitals) or not treated in any health\ncare facility will not be captured.\nSecond, some ADEs that lead to ED\nvisits, such as effects of chronic drug\nexposure, adverse effects manifested by\nthe gradual onset of symptoms, and un-\ncommon adverse effects, may be un-\nrecognized by ED physicians and there-\nfore may be undetected.\nThird, because NEISS-CADES re-\nlies on documentation of ADEs by the\ntreating physician, it is likely less sen-\nsitive than research studies involving\nchart review by specially trained phar-\nmacists or physicians, computer-\ngenerated signals, patient interview, or\ncombination approaches to identify un-\ndiagnosed or unreported ADEs.40\nFourth, NEISS-CADES could be bi-\nased toward detecting acute, well-\nTable 5.

For instance,\nwe did not estimate the total number\nof fatalities from outpatient ADEs\nbecause NEISS-CADES does not cap-\nture prehospital deaths or deaths in\nthe ED. Moreover, although calculat-\ning the proportion of ADEs relative to\nthat drug's use can provide informa-\ntion on relative risks for comparison\nwith other drugs, we did not report\nsuch calculations because estimates of\nnational outpatient drug use are not\navailable from NEISS-CADES data. In\naddition, we did not attempt to cat-\negorize ADEs by \"preventability\" or\nthe presence of a medication \"error\" in\nthis investigation. Further examina-\ntion of the data collected through this\nED-based public health surveillance\nsystem is needed to determine if the\nclinical details are available for such\ncategorization.\nWe expected national estimates of\nuncommon events (eg, estimates of\nfewer than 20 cases) to have CVs\ngreater than 30%; however, several\nnational estimates of ADE estimates\nwere based on relatively large num-\nbers of cases but also had CVs greater\ncases, CV=32.5%). This situation can\noccur for estimates generated from a\nprobability sample, such as NEISS,\nwhen the underlying distribution of\nthe condition under surveillance is not\nevenly distributed across the popula-\ntion. For example, NEISS estimates of\nED visits for snow-skiing injuries have\nelevated CVs because hospitals in\nmountainous northern states have\nhigh numbers of visits for these inju-\nries while hospitals in coastal southern\nstates have low numbers of visits.\nadverse outcomes47 have all been\nshown to vary by hospital and geo-\ngraphic area. These variations in clini-\ncal practice likely contribute to varia-\ntion in the number of ADEs treated at\nNEISS hospitals, resulting in CVs\ngreater than 30% for some estimates\npresented in this study. A recent sys-\ntematic review reported that antico-\nagulation control varied extensively\namong study settings,48 so it is not\nunreasonable that adverse events from\nanticoagulants might vary among the\ncatchment areas served by NEISS hos-\npitals. Other possible explanations for\nelevated CVs include variability in the\nlevel of detail in clinical documenta-\ntion or variability in data collection\nacross NEISS hospitals. Because ADEs\nare typically underdocumented,40 and\nan evaluation of NEISS-CADES data\ncollection found a high positive pre-\ndictive value,14 variability due to docu-\nmentation or data collection practices\nwould likely increase these national\nestimates.\nEfforts to reduce the burden of out-\npatient ADEs have been hampered by\nsparse data, except in selected health\ncare systems or settings.3 Ongoing data\ncollection in NEISS-CADES will en-\nable more detailed examination of the\nepidemiology of ED-treated outpa-\ntient ADEs, focusing on specific pa-\ntient populations, drug classes, condi-\ntions, and circumstances. Identifying\nappropriate measures of drug expo-\nsure and evaluating drug risks in rela-\ntion to drug benefits remain impor-\ntant challenges in improving the quality\nof outpatient drug therapy. In the fu-\nture, data from electronic health records\nmay provide national, real-time data on\noutpatient drug safety.40 Until then, le-\nveraging existing public health surveil-\nlance systems provides a feasible, cost-\nefficient way to monitor the national\nhealth burden of outpatient drug safety\nproblems and helps target prevention\nstrategies tailored to the specific events\nof greatest population burden.\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Budnitz had full access to\nall of the data in the study and takes responsibility for\nthe integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data\nanalysis.\nStudy concept and design: Budnitz, Pollock, Schroeder.\nAcquisition of data: Budnitz, Weidenbach, Schroeder,\nAnnest.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Budnitz, Pollock,\nWeidenbach, Mendelsohn, Schroeder.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Budnitz, Pollock,\nWeidenbach.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important in-\ntellectual content: Budnitz, Mendelsohn, Schroeder,\nAnnest.\nStatistical analysis: Budnitz, Weidenbach, Mendelsohn,\nSchroeder, Annest.\nObtained funding: Budnitz.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support: Budnitz,\nWeidenbach, Schroeder.\nStudy supervision: Budnitz, Pollock.\nFinancial Disclosures: Dr Mendelsohn contributed to\nthis research while he was a CDC Epidemic Intelli-\ngence service officer assigned to the Office of Drug\nSafety, FDA.
