    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: This study assessed the associations between obesity and dental\ncaries in young children participating in a national survey. Methods: Participants\nincluded 1,507 children aged 2-6 years who received dental examinations and had\nat least 10 primary teeth in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n1999-2002. Decayed/filled teeth (dft) counts of primary dentition were obtained, and\nweight and height were measured. Body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) was calculated,\nand participants were categorized using age- and gender-specific criteria as under-\nweight (<5th percent), normal (5th-85th percent), at risk for overweight (>85th and\n<95th percent), and overweight (95th percent). With appropriate sample weighting,\nrelationships between dft and BMI were assessed using the Kruskal\u00adWallis test and\nmultivariable logistic regression. Results: Seventy-four percent of children were\nclassified as normal weight, 11 percent as at risk for overweight, and 11 percent as\noverweight; 58 percent did not have caries; 30 percent had 1-5 dft and 12 percent\nhad >5 dft. When caries experience was compared across BMI categories stratified\nby age and race characteristics, statistically significant association between caries\nand obesity was found only for 60- <72-month age group. In the comparison between\nchildren with normal and at-risk BMI only, significant associations were also found in\nthe Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black strata. In multivariable logistic regression\nmodels to predict caries experience, family income and age were statistically sig-\nnificant predictors for severe early childhood caries only. Conclusions: There\nappears to be no significant association between childhood obesity and caries\nexperience after controlling for age, race, and poverty/income ratio. However, further\nstudies are needed to better understand this relationship.\n",

In particular, racial and ethnic\nminority children and children living\nin poverty have a disproportionately\nhigher burden of dental caries (2).\nDental caries is the most common\nchronic childhood disease--in some\nage groups it is five times more\nprevalent than asthma (1). Early\nchildhood caries, which affects pri-\nmary teeth during early stages of\nlife, can have a profound impact on a\nchild's oral and general health, and\nquality of life. Twenty-eight percent\nof the children in the United States\naged 2-6 years old have caries, and\nthe prevalence increased by 15\npercent during the past decade (3).\nAmong the children with caries,\nthree-quarters of tooth decay remain\nuntreated (3).\nChildhood obesity is currently the\nmost prevalent nutritional condition\nof children in the U.S and is increas-\ningly being cited as a growing epi-\ndemic and public health crisis (4,5).\nOne study estimated that 25 percent\nof 10-year-old children were at risk\nfor overweight and 11 percent were\nobese. Nationally, the proportion of\noverweight children aged 6-11 years\nhas more than doubled, and the\nrate for overweight adolescents has\nThere has been a growing interest\nin the relationship between dental\ncaries and childhood obesity. Some\nstudies have identified a positive\nassociation between these two\ncommon childhood conditions and\nhave suggested that obese children\nare at an increased risk for dental\ncaries (6,7). Other studies, however,\nhave reported a negative association\nbased on the failure to thrive among\nchildren with early childhood caries\nand the corresponding lower body\nmass index (BMI) (8,9). Additional\nstudies have also reported no asso-\nciation between dental caries and\nsystematic review of the literature\nfound only one study with a sufficient\nlevel of evidence for direct associa-\ntion between obesity and dental\ncaries (12). The association between\ndental caries and obesity is compli-\ncated because both are complex con-\nditions with multiple contributing\nfactors, including biological, genetic,\nsocioeconomic, cultural, dietary,\nSend correspondence and reprint requests to Liang Hong, DDS, MS, PhD, Department of Dental Public Health and Behavioral Science, School of\nMichael McCunniff, Pam Overman, and Moncy Mathew are with the Department of Dental Public Health and Behavioral Science, University of\nMissouri-Kansas City, Kansas City, MO.

Manuscript received:\n\u00a9 2008, American Association of Public Health Dentistry\nenvironmental, and lifestyles issues.\nNevertheless, childhood obesity and\ncaries may share some common risk\nfactors. For example, children at the\nhighest risk for dental caries are dis-\nproportionately from minority house-\nholds and/or live in poverty (1), and\nchildhood obesity is also associated\nwith low socioeconomic status (SES)\nin the United States (13).\nSince very few studies have\nexplored this issue using large-scale\nnational samples, the aim of our\nstudy was to assess the associations\nbetween obesity and dental caries in\nmonths) who participated in the\nNational Health and Nutrition Exami-\nMethods\nwere used for this cross-sectional\nstudy. The survey, which entailed\ninterviews and physical and labora-\ntory examinations, is based on a\nnationally representative sample of\npersons were selected and inter-\nviewed. Of those, oral health ex-\naminations were completed on\ndetailed information on the sample\ndesign and operation of NHANES\n(14). Our study was limited to chil-\ndren who were 2-6 years old with at\nleast 10 primary teeth present in the\nmouth at the time of the oral exami-\nnation. This age group was chosen to\nfocus the analysis on primary tooth\ncaries. The number of children\nmeeting the eligibility criteria of this\npercent had all 20 primary teeth.\nHousehold interviews provided\ninformation on demographic vari-\nables, medical history, and health-\nrelated behaviors of the 2- to 6-year-\nold children. Demographic variables\nincluded gender, ethnicity, age at\nexamination, and the poverty index\n(PI). The PI was computed as a\nratio between the midpoint of the\nreported family income category and\nthe poverty threshold value deter-\nmined by the Census Bureau. Conse-\nquently, a PI value below 1 indicates\nthat the family income is below the\npoverty threshold. Medical history\nwas obtained in the interview,\nincluding information on asthma,\narthritis, cancer or malignancy,\nchronic bronchitis, coronary heart\ndisease, ear infection, diabetes, hay\nfever, and stroke. Since few children\nhad arthritis, cancer or malignancy,\nchronic bronchitis, coronary heart\ndisease, diabetes, and/or stroke, only\nasthma was included in our analysis.\nOral health examinations were\nconducted in the mobile examination\ncenters (MEC) and included dentition\nand periodontal assessments. Each\nquadrant was dried with air and\nexamined with a surface reflection\nmirror and a No.23 explorer. The\ndentition assessment included tooth\ncount, coronal caries, root caries,\ndental sealants, incisor trauma, and\nenamel fluorosis. Coronal caries was\nassessed by trained and calibrated\ndentists using a visual-tactile method\nwith standardized equipment and\nsupplies. Since this study was limited\nto children 2-6 years old, only\ncoronal caries was included in the\nanalysis. The number of decayed and\nfilled teeth (dft) was calculated for\neach participant. Participant's caries\nstatus was categorized into three\nfilling component represented a\ntooth surface that has been restored\nwith either a permanent or a tempo-\nrary restoration as a result of caries.\nBecause of difficulty of correctly dis-\ntinguishing among teeth extracted\nfor caries and other reasons, such as\nexfoliation and trauma, missing teeth\ncount was not included in this analy-\nsis. Further, using criteria from the\nAmerican Academy of Pediatric Den-\ntistry, severe early childhood caries\n(S-ECC) was defined as follows: any\nsign of smooth surface decay in chil-\ndren younger than 3 years of age;\none or more decayed or filled sur-\nfaces in primary maxillary anterior\nteeth from ages 3 to 5 years; or\nWeight and height were measured\nduring a physical examination.\nWeight was measured when the child\nstood on a digital scale that was\nconnected to the Integrated Survey\nInformation System (ISIS) and stand-\ning height was measured with an\nelectronic stadiometer that was also\nconnected to the ISIS. BMI was cal-\nculated using the standard formula:\nweight in kilograms (kg) divided by\nheight in meter squared (m2). Chil-\ndren were classified into four catego-\nries using age- and gender-specific\ncriteria recommended by the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention\n(15): underweight \u00ad less than 5th\npercentile; normal weight \u00ad 5th per-\ncentile to less than 85th percentile; at\nrisk of overweight \u00ad 85th to less than\n95th percentile; and overweight \u00ad\nequal to or greater than the 95th\npercentile. Dietary variables included\nin this analysis were daily total\nenergy (kcal) intake, daily total car-\nbohydrate intake, daily total fat\nintake, and daily total sugar intake.\nDietary data were collected by\ntrained and calibrated registered\ndietitians through 24-hour recall\ninterviews to estimate the intake of\nfood energy, nutrients, and nonnutri-\nent food components from foods\nand beverages consumed during the\n24-hour period (from midnight to\nmidnight) prior to the MEC examina-\nIndividual characteristics were\ncategorized and presented as per-\ncentages or means (standard error).\nc2 analyses and Kruskal\u00adWallis tests\nwere used to compare social-\ndemographic, dietary, medical, and\ndental variables between caries\nexperience categories and among\nBMI categories. c2 test was used\nto test for categorical associations\nbetween caries prevalence and BMI\ncategories after stratifying by age and\nrace. Further, BMI categories were\ncompared between caries-free chil-\ndren and those with S-ECC using c2\ntest after stratifying by age, race, and\ngender. Logistic regression models\nwere developed to predict caries\nexperience (yes/no). The model\nincluded the variables that were\nsignificant in bivariate analyses or\nthought to be potentially important:\nchild's BMI category, child's age,\nJournal of Public Health Dentistry\nchild's carbohydrate intake, race, and\nfamily income. All statistical tests\nwere conducted in SAS 9.1 at the\n0.05 level of significance.

Caries experience (both\npercent of children with caries and\nthe mean dft score) was compared\nacross the BMI categories stratified\nby age and race (Table 3). Generally,\nchildren with at-risk BMI or over-\nweight BMI had a higher percentage\nof caries and higher mean dft than\nchildren with normal BMI, although\npercentages and mean dft for BMI\ncategories varied in different strata.\nMost of these differences across BMI\ncategories were not statistically\nsignificant, except for percentages\nAfrican-American race (P = 0.02).\nWhen the comparison was only\nbetween the children with at risk\nBMI and the children with normal\nBMI, those with at-risk BMI had a\nsignificantly higher percentage with\ncaries and higher mean dft in the\ncantly higher mean dft in the African-\nAmerican (P = 0.01) and Hispanic\n(P = 0.02) strata (last column in\nNo statistically significant differ-\nence was found in the comparison of\nBMI category distribution \u00ad stratified\nby age and race \u00ad between caries-free\nchildren and those with S-ECC\n(Table 4).

This observa-\ntion is consistent with what other\nAlthough the mechanism is not clear,\ncaries co-existed with the risk of\nbeing overweight in these studies.\nMarshall et al. (19) suggested that\nneither \"obesity increases risk of\ncaries\" nor \"caries increases risk of\nobesity,\" but rather a common risk\nfactor increased the likelihood of\nboth diseases. Dietary factors and\nSES were hypothesized to be\ncommon risk factors that potentially\nlink obesity and dental caries. A\ndietary habit that contributes to\nobesity could also increase caries\nrisk. It is well established that a\ndietary component is necessary for\nthe caries disease process. Dietary\nhabits (how much and how often the\nbeverage or food is consumed) can\nmodify caries risk, with frequent\nconsumption of sugars considered\nto increase the risk. Energy-dense,\nhighly refined food choices and\ndietary habits have been identified as\nimportant contributors to the obesity\nchildren at risk of being overweight\nearly in life may give health care\nproviders and parents the oppor-\ntunities for early intervention to de-\ncrease risk for both obesity and\ncaries. Furthermore, educational\ninterventions addressing dietary\nissues should highlight both conse-\nquences (overweight and dental\ncaries) simultaneously.\nThis analysis utilized a nationally\nrepresentative sample and thus\nallowed for greater examination of\ncomplexity in the relationship be-\ntween obesity and dental caries.\nHowever, some limitations must be\nobserved. Since the data was cross-\nsectional, causal relationships cannot\nbe established and the observed\nassociation could be due to other\nunexplored factors. Part of the data\nwas based on self-reports and thus\nsubject to recall bias. Furthermore,\nsince the reasons for missing teeth\ncould not be explicitly sought,\nmissing teeth were excluded from\nthe analysis. This may have excluded\na certain number of teeth lost due to\ncaries.\nIn conclusion, within study limi-\ntations, results from this analysis of\na large national sample of young\nchildren suggest a complex multi-\nfactorial relationship between child-\nhood obesity and dental caries. This\ndemands carefully defined research\ndesigns, including longitudinal\nstudies, to identify the particular\npathways through which different\nfactors influence dental caries and\nobesity.\n"
