A conceptual model is evaluated that explores the relationship between church-based support and health.\nIn the process, an effort is made to see if the relationships in this model differ for older White and African American\npeople.\nMethods. Interviews were conducted with a national sample of 748 older White and 752 older Black people. The re-\nsponses of 1,126 of these study participants are used in the analyses presented herein. Survey measures were adminis-\ntered to assess church-based social ties and health.\nResults. Empirical support was provided for the following theoretical linkages: Older people who attend church\noften feel their congregations are more cohesive; older people in highly cohesive congregations receive more spiritual\nand emotional support from their fellow parishioners; older respondents who receive more church-based support have a\nmore personal relationship with God; older people who feel more closely connected with God are more optimistic; and\nolder people who are more optimistic enjoy better health. Data further reveal that older Black people are more likely\nthan older White people to reap the health-related benefits of religion.\nDiscussion. The findings contribute to research on religion and health by specifying how the salubrious effects of\nreligion may arise.\nconvincing literature indicates that involvement in reli-\ngion is associated with good health throughout adult\nlife [see Koenig, McCullough, & Larson (2001) for a review\nof this research]. Initially, researchers working in this field\nfocused primarily on the relationship between basic as-\npects of religion, such as church attendance and health (Com-\nstock, 1971). However, as this literature continued to evolve,\na greater emphasis was placed on explaining how the salu-\nbrious effects of religion may arise. For example, there has\nbeen considerable interest in exploring how factors like\nforgiveness (McCullough, Pargament, & Thoresen, 2000),\nprayer (Levin & Taylor, 1997), and religious coping re-\nsponses (Pargament, 1997) influence physical as well as\nmental health. Viewed broadly, this work suggests that reli-\ngion may affect health in not one, but a number of different\nways. As a result, it seems unlikely that researchers will be\nable to develop a single comprehensive model that encom-\npasses all the diverse ways in which religion may influence\nhealth. Instead, it makes more sense to follow the pragmatic\napproach outlined by Bradley and Schaefer (1998) in their\ninsightful discussion of causal modeling. These investiga-\ntors maintain that because the social world is exceedingly\ncomplex, researchers should strive to develop several models\nthat shed light on different facets of a larger underlying\nsocial process.\nConsistent with the recommendations of Bradley and\nSchaefer (1998), the purpose of the present study is to exam-\nine one domain of religion that has not been fully exploited in\nsocial gerontology--social relationships in the church. Al-\nthough several investigators have discussed race differences\nin church-based support (Chatters, 2000), and the relation-\nship between social ties in the church and health (Krause,\nEllison, & Marcum, 2002), a number of key issues have yet\nto be explored. In particular, some studies focus on adults of\nall ages (e.g., Krause et al., 2002), making it difficult to gen-\neralize the findings to older people. In addition, a number of\ninvestigators attribute the salutary effects of religious fac-\ntors, such as church attendance, to church-based support,\nbut they never directly measure support exchanged by\nfellow church members (e.g., Williams, Larson, Buckler,\nHeckmann, & Pyle, 1991). Finally, few researchers have\nempirically evaluated explicit conceptual models that at-\ntempt to explain how the potentially beneficial influence of\nchurch-based support may arise. Although some scholars\nhave provided useful theoretical discussions of how the ef-\nfects of church-based support might operate (Ellison &\nLevin, 1998), these conceptual schemes remain largely un-\ntested. Consequently, the first goal of the present study is to\naddress this gap in the knowledge base by evaluating the re-\nlationship between religious support and health in late life,\nwith an eye toward showing how the potentially beneficial\neffects of church-based social ties may arise.\nThe second goal of this study is to delve more deeply into\nchurch-based social relationships and health by exploring\nthe potentially important influence of race. More specifi-\ncally, an emphasis is placed on seeing whether the church-\nbased social ties of older African Americans are stronger\nthan those of older White persons, and whether there are\nrace differences in the relationship between religious sup-\nport and health. Some investigators argue that older African\nAmericans may receive more tangible and emotional assis-\ntance in church than older White persons (Chatters, 2000),\nbut this literature may be improved in at least three ways.\nFirst, few studies actually empirically assess race differences\nA\nin church-based support. Instead, the argument for race\ndifferences in religious support is based largely on theoret-\nical discussions alone. Second, researchers do not typi-\ncally conduct explicit tests to see if the effects of church-\nbased support on health differ significantly for older White\nand older Black people. Third, as the research that follows\nwill reveal, there are facets of religious support beyond\nemotional and tangible assistance that have yet to be eval-\nuated fully.\nThe discussion that follows is divided into three main\nsections. First, a conceptual model is developed that at-\ntempts to show why church-based social ties may be associ-\nated with good health in late life. In the process, race differ-\nences in this conceptual scheme are explored. Second, the\nsample and study measures are presented. The data analytic\nstrategy is briefly examined at this juncture as well. Finally,\nthe study results are reviewed and discussed.\nChurch-Based Social Support and Health\nThe latent variable model that was developed for this\nstudy is presented in Figure 1. Two steps were taken to sim-\nplify the presentation of this conceptual scheme. First, the\nelements of the measurement model (i.e., the factor loadings\nand measurement error terms) are not shown in Figure 1. Sec-\nond, the relationships among the constructs in this model\nwere evaluated after the effects of age, sex, education, and\nrace were controlled statistically. The central theoretical\nthrust of this conceptual scheme is captured in the following\nlinkages: (1) Older people who attend church more often\nwill tend to believe their congregations are highly cohesive;\n(2) those who worship in more cohesive congregations will\nreceive more spiritual and emotional support from their fel-\nlow church members; (3) older people who receive spiritual\nand emotional support from the people in their church will\ndevelop a deeper and more personal relationship with God\n(i.e., connectedness with God); (4) older study participants\nwho feel they are closely connected with God will maintain\na strong sense of optimism; and (5) older people who are\nmore optimistic will enjoy better health than elderly people\nwho are less optimistic. The theoretical rationale for these\nlinkages is discussed in detail herein.\nChurch attendance, congregational cohesiveness, and\nspiritual support.--As House (1987) observed some time\nago, social support is rarely treated as a dependent variable.\nYet a deeper understanding of how social support operates\nshould begin by showing how it arises in the first place. The\nmodel in Figure 1 was designed to address this issue by as-\nsessing the interplay between the frequency of church atten-\ndance and the wider social climate of the congregation.\nAccording to the model depicted in Figure 1, church at-\ntendance may affect religious support in two ways. First, it\nis hypothesized that older adults who attend church more\noften will receive more support from church members than\nolder people who do not attend religious services frequently.\nThis may happen for a number of reasons. For example, fre-\nquent contact may make potential providers more aware of\nthe social support needs of older church members.\nThe second way that church attendance may influence re-\nligious support is more indirect and operates through the\nwider social climate of the church. A longstanding principle\nin sociology stipulates that the behavior of people in institu-\ntions, such as churches, is influenced by the wider climate\nof these social organizations. This view is captured in the\nclassic work of Berger and Luckmann (1966), who maintain\nthat, \"Institutions . . . by the very fact of their existence,\ncontrol human conduct by setting up predefined patterns of\nconduct, which channel it in one direction as against the\nmany other directions that are theoretically possible\" (p.\n55). Although this proposition appears to be relatively\nstraightforward, it is challenging to evaluate because there\nare a number of ways to conceptualize and measure institu-\ntional influences on behavior. Several researchers have at-\ntempted to delineate different facets of religious institutions\nthat shape the behavior of people who worship there. One of\nthe more comprehensive studies was conducted by Parga-\nment and colleagues (1983). These investigators proposed\nthat the climate of a congregation is determined by a range\nof factors, including the stability of church leadership, the\nlevel of autonomy and openness in church meetings and\ncommittees, and the extent to which church members are in-\nvolved in church activities. Their research revealed that cer-\ntain facets of the congregational climate (e.g., the level of\nautonomy) were associated with greater self-esteem and life\nsatisfaction. Although these investigators made a valuable\ncontribution to the literature, their work can be improved in\nat least three ways. First, the study by Pargament and col-\nleagues was based on a nonrandom sample of adults from\nall age groups. This makes it difficult to determine whether\nthe findings may be generalized to older people. Second,\npsychological well-being was the major outcome measure\nin this study. As a result, it is not clear if the climate of the\ncongregation may be related to physical health status as\nwell. Third, Pargament and colleagues did not make an ef-\nfort to evaluate empirically the ways in which the climate of\nthe congregation may influence the physical or mental\nhealth of people who worship there.\nIn an effort to extend the work of Pargament and colleagues\n(1983), the model depicted in Figure 1 focuses on one facet of\nFigure 1. A conceptual model of church-based support and self-\nrated health.\nthe wider congregational climate--congregational cohesive-\nness. This construct reflects the extent to which church\nmembers believe their values and outlook on life are shared\nby the people they worship with. Focusing on this particular\nfacet of the congregational climate makes it possible to\nspecify the second way in which the frequency of church at-\ntendance may be associated with religious support. More\nspecifically, it is proposed in Figure 1 that older people who\nattend church more often tend to believe that their congrega-\ntions are more cohesive, and older people who are embedded\nin more cohesive congregations will, in turn, receive more\nsupport from their fellow church members. The work of\nStark and Finke (2000) helps explain the first of these link-\nages. These investigators begin by pointing out that when\npeople attend religious services, they engage in various ritu-\nals. The purpose of these rituals is to enhance group solidar-\nity by increasing commitment to the ideals, goals, and\nvalues of the church. To the extent this is true, more frequent\nattendance in worship services should promote greater con-\ngregational cohesiveness. In contrast, the link between con-\ngregational cohesiveness and social support is based on a\nlarge body of secular research, which suggests that social\nsupport is more likely to be exchanged when social net-\nworks are homogeneous and network members share com-\nmon values and beliefs (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, & Cook,\nResearch on the predictors of church-based support is\ncomplicated by the fact that church members are likely to\nhelp each other in a number of different ways. For example,\nresearch reviewed by Chatters (2000) suggests that people\noften receive emotional and tangible assistance from the\npeople they worship with. This is important because an ex-\ntensive literature suggests that various types of support pro-\nvided in secular settings (e.g., emotional support or tangible\nhelp) may have a beneficial effect on health (Cohen, Under-\nwood, & Gottlieb, 2000). However, research conducted in\nchurch settings indicates that people may also help each\nother in ways that are more explicitly religious in nature.\nMore specifically, research by Krause, Ellison, Shaw, Mar-\ncum, and Boardman (2001) indicates that fellow church\nmembers may exchange spiritual support as well. Spiritual\nsupport is assistance that is aimed specifically toward in-\ncreasing the religious commitment, beliefs, and behavior of\na fellow parishioner. There are a number of ways in which\nchurch members may exchange spiritual support. For exam-\nple, they may share their own religious experiences with a\nfellow parishioner, or show them how to apply their reli-\ngious beliefs in daily life.\nAlthough it is not possible to include all the different di-\nmensions of church-based support in a single conceptual\nmodel, two are evaluated in Figure 1--emotional support\nand spiritual support provided by church members. Com-\nparing and contrasting the effects of these constructs is use-\nful for the following reason. Although measures of emo-\ntional and spiritual support from church members are\ncorrelated (Krause et al., 2001), these types of church-based\nassistance may serve different functions. Spiritual support is\nmuch more focused in nature and is typically provided to\nenhance the religious experience and understanding of the\nrecipient. In contrast, emotional support from church members\nis more general and is often provided to promote an overall\nsense of well-being in the recipient and augment the quality\nof the relationship between the provider and the recipient. If\nchurch-based support is associated with health in old age,\nthen knowing which facet of support is at work may help re-\nsearchers better understand the underlying mechanisms that\nmay be at work.\nChurch-based support and connectedness with God.--\nA number of studies indicate that individuals tend to be-\ncome more religious as they grow older. For example, when\ncompared with people under 30 years of age, considerably\nmore people over age 75 say religion is very important to\nsearch by Levin and Taylor (1997) indicates that the fre-\nquency of private prayer steadily increases in successively\nolder cohorts. These empirical insights are consistent with\nthe theoretical perspective developed by Fowler (1976),\nwho outlined a series of stages that people go through in the\ndevelopment of their faith. He argued that, as individuals\nprogress through these developmental stages, the quality\nand nature of their faith tends to deepen and mature. For ex-\nample, the final stages in his scheme are characterized as a\ntime of deep critical introspection, in which commitment to\none's faith broadens and takes on a greater significance. It is\nespecially important to note that Fowler argued that these\nfinal stages of development are typically encountered later\nin life.\nConsistent with the perspective of Fowler (1976), Koenig\n(1994) identified the qualitative changes that take place in\nthe religious orientation of some people as they enter in old\nage. The essence of these changes is captured in Koenig's\nnotion of a mature religious faith. In particular, he maintains\nthat a \". . . mature religious faith involves a deep, intimate,\nstable, and exclusive relationship with God\" (Koenig, 1994,\np. 124). If this is true, then researchers need to learn more\nabout the factors that promote a deep personal relationship\nwith God. A central premise in the present study is that fel-\nlow church members may play a critical role in this process.\nIn particular, it is proposed that spiritual support received\nfrom fellow parishioners helps older people feel as though\nthey are more closely connected with God, and that they\nhave a deep personal relationship with Him. This is hardly a\nnew idea. Nearly a century ago, Simmel (1905) maintained\nthat a religious person, \". . . feels himself bound to a univer-\nsal, to something higher, from which he came and into\nwhich he will return, from which he differs and to which he\nis nonetheless identical. All of these emotions, which meet\nas in a focal point in the idea of God, can be traced back\nto the relationship that the individual sustains with the\nAs Simmel's (1905) observations reveal, all close ties\nwith others are capable of generating these feelings toward\nGod. To the extent this is true, emotional support may be as-\nsociated with feeling close to God as well. However, it is\npredicted in this study that spiritual support will have a\ngreater effect because, as noted earlier, this type of church-\nbased support is focused more specifically on enhancing the\nnature and quality of religious life.\nWuthnow (1994) conducted one of the few empirical\nstudies on the relationship between social ties in the church\nand the development of a close personal relationship with\nGod. Consistent with the hypothesis developed for the present\nstudy, Wuthnow found that people who are encouraged by fel-\nlow church members to adopt religious teachings and prin-\nciples tend to report they have a closer relationship with\nGod. However, Wuthnow did not examine whether having a\nclose personal relationship with God was, in turn, related to\nhealth. Moreover, because he studied adults of all ages, it is\nnot clear if his findings can be generalized to older people.\nConnectedness with God and optimism.--If religion is\nrelated to health in late life, and having a close personal re-\nlationship with God is the hallmark of a mature faith, then it\nis imperative to find out how a close relationship with God\nmay influence the health of older people. Although there are\nlikely to be a number of pathways, one potentially important\nmechanism is examined in Figure 1. In particular, it is pro-\nposed that older people who have a close personal relation-\nship with God have better health because being closer to\nGod helps them feel more optimistic. Optimism is defined\nas the expectation or confidence that outcomes that are de-\nsired for the future will ultimately be attained (Peterson,\n2000). Optimism is very closely akin to hope (Snyder,\n2000). Although some investigators go to great lengths to\ndiscuss the differences between the hope and optimism\n(Nunn, 1996), it is not the purpose of the present study to re-\nsolve this issue. Instead, the literature on both hope and op-\ntimism is considered below because, despite the conceptual\ndistinction between these constructs, the two constructs ap-\npear to be correlated highly (e.g., around 0.60; Snyder et al.,\nThere are two reasons why optimism and hope are espe-\ncially important factors to examine within the context of re-\nligion. First, as Peterson (2000) argues, \"Religious thought\nlends itself particularly well to . . . optimism because of\n\". . . every religion seeks to instill hope in those who sub-\nscribe to its teachings\" (p. 138). Consistent with these views,\nKoenig and colleagues (2001) reviewed a series of studies\nthat link various aspects of religiousness with greater opti-\nmism and hope. However, most of this work was conducted\nin clinic settings with adults of all ages who were suffering\nfrom diseases like cancer or HIV. Consequently, it is diffi-\ncult to generalize the findings to the general population of\nolder people. Sethi and Seligman (1993) conducted one of\nthe few studies on optimism and religion that did not in-\nvolve respondents who were recruited from a clinic setting.\nThese investigators report that adults of all ages who feel re-\nligion has a greater influence in their daily lives, and who\nare more involved in religion, tend to feel more optimistic.\nAlthough optimism may be related to religion in general,\nit is important for the purposes of the present study to show\nwhy it may arise specifically from a close personal relation-\nship with God. Evidence for this relationship may be found\nby returning to Koenig's (1994) discussion of a mature faith.\nIn particular, he argued that people who have a close rela-\ntionship with God develop a deep sense of trust in God, be-\nlieve that God is in control of their lives, believe that God\nknows what is best for them, and believe that God ultimately\nensures they will get what they need most. Because of these\nbeliefs, Koenig maintained that people who have a close\npersonal relationship with God are more hopeful and more\noptimistic.\nOptimism and health.--There are a fairly substantial\nnumber of studies in the secular literature on the relation-\nship between optimism and physical as well as psychologi-\ncal well-being. One study by Peterson, Seligman, and\nVaillant (1988) is especially compelling. Their research\nsuggests that optimism is a significant predictor of physical\nhealth status over a 35-year period. In particular, this study\nrevealed that people who are optimistic tend to enjoy better\nhealth over time than individuals who are less optimistic.\nSimilarly, research reveals that people who are hopeful also\ntend to have better physical health [see Lazarus (1999) for a\nreview of this literature]. There are at least three reasons\nwhy optimism and hope may exert a beneficial effect on\nhealth. First, there is some evidence that people who are op-\ntimistic tend to cope more effectively with stressful life\nevents. In particular, a strong sense of hope or optimism is a\nmotivating factor that encourages individuals to take active\nsteps to eradicate the problems they face (Lazarus, 1999).\nSecond, optimism or hope is thought to imbue life with a\ndeep sense of meaning (Levin, 2001). This is important be-\ncause research indicates that having a strong sense of mean-\ning in life is associated with better health (Ryff & Singer,\n1998). Finally, hope and optimism may lower the risk of\nmental health problems (Nunn, 1996) that may, in turn, in-\nfluence physical health (Cohen & Rodriguez, 1995).\nAlthough the secular literature on hope, optimism, and\nhealth is fairly well developed, empirical research on these\nrelationships in religious settings is more limited. In one of\nthe more noteworthy studies, Idler and Kasl (1997) found\nthat the frequency of church attendance is associated with\ngreater optimism and that older people who are more opti-\nmistic tend to experience fewer problems with physical\nfunctioning over time. Consistent with the findings of Idler\nand Kasl, it is predicted in Figure 1 that older adults who are\nmore optimistic will report their health is better than elderly\npeople who are less optimistic.\nRace Differences\nThe model depicted in Figure 1 is useful because it serves\nas an important strategic context for adding to the burgeon-\ning literature on race differences in religion during late life.\nAs noted earlier, a considerable number of studies reveal\nthat older Black people are significantly more involved in\nreligion than elderly White people. In one of the more com-\nprehensive studies, Levin, Taylor, and Chatters (1994) ex-\nplored race differences in religion across four national sur-\nveys. Race comparisons were made on 21 indicators of\nreligion across these different data bases. The findings re-\nvealed that older Black people were more religious than\nolder White people in 19 of the 21 tests. For example, when\ncompared with elderly White people, older Black persons\nattend church more often, read religious books more often,\nand feel that religion is more important in their lives. The\nmodel depicted in Figure 1 aims to contribute to this litera-\nture in two ways. First, it expands the scope of inquiry by\nexploring whether race differences emerge in variables that\nhave not been examined by other researchers (i.e., congre-\ngational cohesiveness, spiritual support, emotional support,\nand connectedness to God). Second, an effort is made to see\nwhether race differences emerge in the relationships be-\ntween these measures of religion and health.\nSocial factors figure prominently in the model depicted in\nFigure 1 (e.g., congregational cohesiveness and spiritual\nsupport). This emphasis is important because research con-\nsistently shows that the social aspects of religion may be\nmore well developed among older Black than elderly White\npeople. Evidence of this may be found in the classic study\nconcluded that, \"The Negro church . . . provides social inter-\ncourse, it provides amusement of various kinds, it serves as\na newspaper and intelligence bureau, it supplants the the-\nater, it directs the picnic and excursion, it furnishes the mu-\nsic, it introduces the stranger to the community, it serves as\na lyceum, library, and lecture bureau--it is, in fine, the cen-\ntral organ of the organized life of the American Negro\" (p.\n21). Although the observations of DuBois were made over a\ncentury ago, more recent evidence suggests that religion\namong Black people continues to have a pronounced so-\ncial emphasis. This is reflected in the work of Mattis and\nJagers (2001), who noted that, \". . . African American re-\nligiosity and worship traditions emphasize both a pro-\nfound sense of intimacy with the divine, and a horizontal\nextension of that intimacy into the human community . . .\"\nThere are both historical and cultural reasons for the de-\ncidedly social emphasis in religion among older Black\npeople. With respect to history, a number of researchers\nmaintain that the church became the social center of the\ncommunity because of centuries of discrimination and prej-\nudice. In particular, Black people turned to the church for\nsocial as well as spiritual sustenance because it was the only\ninstitution in the community that was built, funded, and\nwholly controlled by Black people (Nelsen & Nelsen,\n1975). In addition to historical factors, there is some evi-\ndence that cultural issues may also come into play. Baldwin\nand Hopkins (1990) have gone to great lengths to identify\nthe key elements of the African American worldview or cul-\nture. They persuasively argue that African American culture\nis characterized by its emphasis on harmony, cooperation,\ncollective responsibility, \"groupness,\" and \"sameness.\" Be-\ncause institutions reflect the elements of the wider culture in\nwhich they are embedded, it follows that these key cultural\ncharacteristics should permeate religion in the Black com-\nmunity as well.\nBased on the research reviewed previously, it is hypothe-\nsized that, compared with older White people, older Black\npeople will report their church congregations are more co-\nhesive. Evidence for this may be found in Pargament's study\non the climate of religious congregations (Pargament et al.,\n1983). These investigators found that, on average, African\nAmerican congregations appear to have a more favorable\nclimate than White congregations. In addition to this, the\ncultural and historical factors identified previously suggest\nthat, compared with older White people, older Black per-\nsons will report receiving more emotional and spiritual sup-\nport from their fellow parishioners. But race differences in\nthe social aspects of religion may extend beyond relation-\nships among people to the relationships that older adults\nmaintain with God. As noted earlier, Mattis and Jagers\n(2001) maintain that a special emphasis is placed in African\nAmerican religiosity on developing an intimate relationship\nwith God. Support for these observations may be found in a\nHer research revealed that, \"God is regarded as a personal\nfriend who knows each woman intimately and cares for her\nreached in another qualitative study by Poindexter, Linsk,\nand Warner (1999). Cast within the context of the model de-\npicted in Figure 1, this research suggests that older Black\npeople will report they feel more closely connected to God\nthan their White counterparts.\nIn addition to these predominantly social factors, race dif-\nferences may also emerge in hope or optimism. Research in\nBlack theology by Cone (1986) suggests that because of ra-\ncial repression in the United States, African American reli-\ngiosity is deeply concerned with issues of oppression, and\nthe quest for liberation and justice. Because of the centrality\nof the church in the Black community, and because the\nchurch meets issues of racism head on, Black theologians\nhave argued that one of the most important functions of the\nchurch is to instill a sense of hope and optimism among the\nfaithful (Cone, 1986). Based on this literature, it is hypothe-\nsized in Figure 1 that older Black people will be more opti-\nmistic than older White people.\nSo far, the discussion in this section has focused on how\nrace differences may arise in various dimensions of religion.\nBut it is important to think more deeply about how these\nrace differences may become manifest. The research re-\nviewed previously suggests that the level or amount of reli-\ngious involvement may be higher among older Black people\nthan among older White people. So, for example, Black\npeople may receive more spiritual support than White\npeople. If spiritual support is, in turn, related to health, it\nwould be reasonable to conclude that religion is more likely\nto benefit older Black people because they are more in-\nvolved in it. This scenario would reflect the salubrious ef-\nfects of differential involvement in religion across the two\nracial groups. These race differences could be detected by\ntesting for mean differences in constructs, like spiritual sup-\nport. Alternatively, differential involvement could be cap-\ntured by estimating the relationship between race and spiri-\ntual support. But there is another way to think about the\nrelationships among race, religion, and health that is more\nsubtle in nature.\nSubsequent data analysis may reveal that the relationship\nbetween church-based support and health is stronger among\nolder Black people than among elderly White people. This\neffect would be captured by assessing whether the regres-\nsion coefficient for the relationship between spiritual or\nemotional support and health differs across subgroups con-\nsisting of older White and older Black people. If the sub-\ngroup coefficients are different, it is important to think care-\nfully about what these findings mean. In this case, the\nestimates would reveal that, at the same level or amount of\nsupport, the impact of church-based assistance on health is\ngreater for older Black than older White people. This differ-\nential impact of church-based support on health would sug-\ngest there is something qualitatively different about the na-\nture of the social support process across the two racial\ngroups. This unmeasured influence could involve a number\nof factors, including the cultural or historical influences re-\nviewed earlier in this section. For example, research in the\nsecular support literature suggests that the benefits of re-\nceiving assistance from others are enhanced if both the sup-\nport provider and the support recipient possess good social\nskills (Hogg & Heller, 1990). Perhaps the social emphasis in\nthe African American worldviews discussed by Baldwin and\nHopkins (1990) helps ensure that, at comparable levels of\nexposure, older Black people will be more likely than White\npeople to reap the health-related benefits of receiving\nchurch-based support because their culture has provided\nthem with more well-developed social skills.\nIn the analyses that follow, two sets of analyses are used\nto disentangle the potential contributions of variations by\nrace in the differential involvement and differential impact\nof religion in late life. Doing so helps sharpen our under-\nstanding of the precise processes that may shape race differ-\nences in the relationship between religion and health.\nMETHODS\nSample\nData for this study come from a nationwide survey of\nolder people. The study population was defined as all house-\nhold residents who are either Black or White, noninstitu-\ntionalized, English speaking, and 66 years of age or older.\nGeographically, the study population was restricted to eligi-\nble persons residing in the coterminous United States (i.e.,\nresidents of Alaska and Hawaii were excluded). Finally, the\nstudy was restricted to individuals who were currently prac-\nticing Christians, people who were Christians in the past but\nno longer practice any religion, and individuals who were\nnot affiliated with any faith at any point in their lifetime.\nPeople who practiced a religion other than Christianity (e.g.,\nJews and Muslims) were excluded because it would be ex-\ntremely difficult to devise a comprehensive set of religion\nmeasures that are suitable for persons of all faiths.\nThe sampling frame consisted of all eligible persons con-\ntained in the Health Care Finance Administration (HCFA)\nMedicare Beneficiary Eligibility List (HCFA is now called\nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services). This list\ncontains the name, address, sex, and race of virtually every\nolder person in the United States. It should be emphasized\nthat older people are included in this list even if they are not\nreceiving Social Security benefits. Nevertheless, some older\npeople are not included in this database because they do not\nhave a Social Security number. This may be from factors\nsuch as illegal immigration.\nA five-step process was used to draw the sample. First,\neach year, researchers at HCFA draw a 5% sample of the\nnames in their master file using a simple random sampling\nprocedure. The sampled names include individuals who are\nat least 65 years of age. However, by the time the field pe-\nriod for the present study began, subjects in the 5% file were\nat least 66 years of age. It is for this reason that the study\npopulation was defined as including individuals who were\n66 years of age or older. In the second step of the sampling\nprocedure used for this study, the 5% file was split into two\nsubfiles--one containing older White people and the other\ncontaining older Black people. Each file was sorted sepa-\nrately by county and then by zip codes within each county.\nIn the third step, an nth interval was calculated for each sub-\nfile based on the total number of eligible records. Following\na random start, 75 nth selections were made in each file. In\nthe fourth step of the sampling strategy, primary sampling\nunits (PSUs) were formed by selecting approximately 25\nadditional names above and 25 additional names below each\ncase identified in step three. Finally, in the last stage, sam-\npled persons within each PSU were recruited for an inter-\nview with the goal of obtaining approximately 10 complete\ninterviews per PSU.\nInterviewing began in March 2001 and concluded in Au-\ngust 2001. Data collection was performed by Louis Harris\nand Associates (now Harris Interactive). A total of 1,500 in-\nterviews were completed successfully. Older Black persons\nwere oversampled so that sufficient statistical power would\nbe available to explore fully race differences in religion.\nMore specifically, the final sample consisted of 748 older\nWhite and 752 older Black people. The overall response rate\nfor the study was 62%.\nAlthough there are 1,500 participants in this study, all re-\nspondents are not included in the analyses presented herein.\nThe model depicted in Figure 1 focuses on congregational\ncohesiveness and church-based support. However, people\nmust attend church to have an opportunity to build close ties\nwith the people who worship there. Consequently, when the\nstudy questionnaire was designed, the research team con-\ncluded that it did not make sense to ask about things like\ncongregational cohesiveness and receiving spiritual support\nfrom church members if people either never go to church, or\nattend worship services only once or twice a year. Based on\nthis rationale, 374 study participants are excluded from the\nanalyses because the questions dealing with congregational\ncohesiveness and church-based support were not adminis-\ntered to them.\nA preliminary analysis of the data provided by the 1,126\neligible study participants revealed that the proportion of\ncases containing missing data ranged from 0% to 16%, with\nonly two variables containing more than 8% item nonre-\nsponse. Using listwise deletion of missing data would have\nresulted in 734 cases with complete data. However, to avoid\npotential bias arising from item nonresponse, multiple im-\nputation procedures were performed using the software de-\nveloped by Schafer (1997). More specifically, the model\ndepicted in Figure 1 was estimated in each of three com-\nplete data sets containing imputed values. Coefficients were\nthen averaged across the three imputations to generate a sin-\ngle point estimate. Following this, standard errors were cal-\nculated by using a formula that combines the average of the\nsquared errors of the estimates and the variances of the pa-\nrameter estimates across the three samples (Schafer & Olsen,\n1998). Based on these imputation procedures, the analyses\nperformed herein were conducted with 1,126 cases.\nApproximately 46% of the study participants were older\nWhite people, and 54% were older African Americans. The\naverage age of these individuals was 74.4 years (SD  6.3\nyears). Approximately 38% were older men. Finally, these\nolder adults indicated they had successfully completed an\naverage of 11.6 years of schooling (SD  3.4 years). These\ndescriptive data, as well as the results presented herein, are\nbased on weighted data. More specifically, data within the\nsubsamples of older White and older Black people were\nweighted to information on age, gender, education, and re-\ngion of the country (East, South, Midwest, West) contained\nin the May 2001 U.S. Census Bureau Current Population\nStatistics data file.\nMeasures\nTable 1 contains the measures that were used to estimate\nthe model depicted in Figure 1. The procedures used to code\nthese items are provided in the footnotes of this table.\nFrequency of church attendance.--A single item was\nused to determine how often study participants attended reli-\ngious services in the past year. This indicator is coded so that\na high score represents more frequent church attendance.\nCongregational cohesiveness.--Three items were de-\nveloped especially for this study to assess congregational\ncohesiveness. The extensive strategy that was implemented\nto develop these questions is discussed in detail by Krause\n(2002). As shown in Table 1, these indicators assess whether\nrespondents feel their beliefs and values are shared by the\npeople they worship with, and whether people in their con-\ngregation tend to have a similar outlook on life. These mea-\nsures are coded so that a high score denotes greater congre-\ngational cohesiveness.\nSpiritual support.--Spiritual support received from fel-\nlow parishioners is also measured with three indicators that\nwere developed especially for this study. These items assess\nwhether fellow church members share religious experiences\nwith study participants, and whether fellow parishioners\nhelp them lead a better religious life. A high score on these\nmeasures indicates that respondents receive spiritual sup-\nport more often from the people they worship with.\nWhen these items were being developed, it quickly became\nevident that church members can provide spiritual support in\ntwo different contexts. First, as the work of Wuthnow (1994)\nreveals, people may provide spiritual support in formal\nchurch settings, such as Bible study groups, prayer groups,\nand formal worship services. Second, spiritual support may\nalso be provided informally, because people interact with their\nfellow parishioners inside, as well as outside, the church. As\nshown in Table 1, the spiritual support questions devised for\nthis study reflect assistance that was provided only in infor-\nmal settings. The decision to focus on informal support was\nbased on the following rationale. When the item develop-\nment strategy for this study was being implemented, many\nstudy participants indicated that they considered sermons\nduring formal worship services and collective congrega-\ntional prayers to be a source of spiritual support. However,\nexpanding the scope of inquiry to include these formal con-\ntexts tends to blur the boundaries between social support,\nformal worship services, and prayer. This creates problems\nTable 1.

Would you say your health is excellent, good, fair, or poor?\naThis item was scored in the following manner (coding in parentheses): never (1); less than once a year (2); about once or twice a year (3); several times a year (4);\nabout once a month (5); 2\u00ad3 times a month (6); nearly every week (7); every week (8); several times a week (9).\nbThese items were scored in the following manner: strongly disagree (1); disagree (2); agree (3); and strongly agree (4).\ncThese items were scored in the following manner: never (1); once in a while (2); fairly often (3); and very often (4).\ndThis item was scored in the following manner: poor (1); fair (2); good (3); and excellent (4).\nbecause an extensive literature reveals that formal worship\nservices (Idler & Kasl, 1997) and prayer (Levin & Taylor,\n1997) are complex social phenomena that may influence\nhealth in a number of ways that do not explicitly involve so-\ncial support. As a result, it is harder to isolate the specific\ncontributions of church-based support when it is provided in\nformal settings. To more clearly identify the underlying fac-\ntors that may be at work, participants in the present study\nwere instructed to exclude assistance obtained in Bible\nstudy groups, prayer groups, and formal worship services\nwhen answering the spiritual support questions.\nEmotional support from church members.--Three indi-\ncators were used in this study to assess the amount of emo-\ntional support that older people receive from their fellow\nchurch members. These questions are revised versions of\nchurch-based emotional support items that were devised by\nthe Fetzer Institute/National Institute on Aging Working\nGroup (1999). As shown in Table 1, these items ask older\nrespondents whether someone in their congregation told\nthem they love and care for them, whether someone they\nworship with listened to them talk about their private feel-\nings and concerns, and whether a fellow church member\nexpressed interest or concern in their well-being. These\nindicators are coded so that a high score denotes more emo-\ntional support. In the process of answering these questions,\nrespondents were instructed not to include emotional sup-\nport from their minister, pastor, or priest. This was done be-\ncause research by Krause and associates (2001) suggests\nthat emotional support from the clergy and emotional sup-\nport from fellow church members are not related to other\nfacets of religion (i.e., religious coping responses) in the\nsame way.\nConnectedness with God.--Three measures were also\ndevised specifically for this study to assess connectedness\nwith God. These indicators gauge whether respondents feel\nthey have a close personal relationship with God, whether\nthey feel God is right there with them in daily life, and\nwhether they believe God actually listens when they talk to\nHim. A high score on these items indicates that study partici-\npants feel they have a close and personal relationship with God.\nOptimism.--Optimism is measured with three indica-\ntors. Two come from the scale developed by Scheier and\nCarver (1985). These items assess whether study partici-\npants expect the best in uncertain times and whether they\nare optimistic about the future. The third item deals with\nfeeling confident that the rest of one's life will turn out well.\nThis item was based on the input of respondents in our qual-\nitative research (Krause, 2002). More specifically, a number\nof study participants indicated their faith made them feel\nmore optimistic about the future, and they specifically noted\nthat their religion made them feel that, no matter what hap-\npened in the future, things would turn out well. All three indi-\ncators are coded so that a high score denotes greater optimism.\nSelf-rated health.--Health is measured with a single\nitem that asks respondents to rate their overall health as\neither excellent, good, fair, or poor (see Idler, 1999, for a de-\ntailed discussion of the utility of this measure). This widely\nused indicator is coded so that a high score reflects better\nself-rated health.\nRace.--A binary variable is used to contrast older White\npeople (scored 1) with older Black people (scored 0).\nDemographic control measures.--The relationships be-\ntween race, religion, optimism, and health were evaluated\nafter the effects of age, sex, and education were controlled\nstatistically. Age is scored in a continuous format. Similarly,\neducation is coded in a continuous format reflecting the\ntotal number of years of completed schooling. Finally, sex is\nrepresented by a binary variable that contrasts men (scored\n1) with women (scored 0).\nData Analysis Strategy\nThe analyses for this study were conducted in two parts\nthat were designed to test for differential involvement in re-\nligion between older Black and White people, as well as the\ndifferential impact of religion across the two racial groups.\nThe analyses that focus on differential involvement in reli-\ngion are relatively straightforward. In this case, older Black\nand older White respondents are pooled to form a single\ngroup. Then, tests are performed to see if the binary mea-\nsure contrasting members of the two racial groups is signifi-\ncantly related to the constructs depicted in Figure 1. These\nanalyses were performed with Version 8.50 of the LISREL\nstatistical software program (du Toit & du Toit, 2001).\nThe model depicted in Figure 1 was evaluated with the\nmaximum likelihood estimator. However, use of this proce-\ndure rests on the assumption that the observed indicators in\nthe model are distributed normally. Preliminary tests of the\nstudy measures (not shown here) revealed that this assump-\ntion had been violated. Fortunately, as du Toit and du Toit\n(2001) report, this problem can be handled by simply con-\nverting raw scores on the observed indicators to normal\nscores prior to model estimation (see p. 143). Based on this\nrecommendation, all analyses presented in this study are\nbased on variables that have been normalized.\nIn contrast with analysis of differential involvement in re-\nligion, tests for the differential impact of religion are more\ncomplex. As discussed previously, the differential impact\nperspective states, for example, that the relationship be-\ntween congregational cohesiveness and spiritual support is\nstronger among older Black than older White people. Stated\nin more technical terms, this perspective specifies that there\nis a statistical interaction effect between race and congrega-\ntional cohesiveness on spiritual support. Tests for this, as\nwell as all other interactions by race, were performed using\na subgroup approach. Once again, these analyses are con-\nducted with Version 8.50 of the LISREL software program\n(du Toit & du Toit, 2001). Cast within the context of the\npresent study, subgroup analysis involves partitioning the\nsample into two separate groups consisting of older White\nand older Black people, respectively. Then, two models\nidentical to the one depicted in Figure 1 are created for each\nsubgroup. These models are then estimated simultaneously.\nBut, instead of making a single pass through the data, a se-\nries of nested models are used to test for race differences in\nthe hypothesized study linkages. These nested models are\nimportant because they evaluate assumptions in the mea-\nsurement model, as well as substantive race differences in\nthe relationships among the latent constructs. The series of\nnested models that were performed in this study are listed in\nThe first specification in Table 2 (Model 1) allows all the\nparameters in the models to vary freely across the two sub-\ngroups. This provides the baseline for evaluating the utility\nof the remaining models. The next two models (Models 2\nand 3) are designed to see if the elements of the measure-\nment model are the same in subgroups consisting of older\nWhite and older Black people, respectively. These tests are\nimportant for the following reason.\nIf study measures mean the same thing to older White and\nolder Black people, they will answer survey questions in\nthe same way. If they answer the questions in the same way,\nthe covariances among these items should be the same in\nboth groups. To the extent this is true, the factor loadings\nand measurement error terms derived from these covari-\nances should be the same as well. However, if the elements\nof the measurement model differ across groups, then there\nwould be some evidence that measures of constructs like\ncongregational cohesiveness and spiritual support do not\nmean the same thing to older White and older Black people.\nIf this proves to be the case, it would be difficult to interpret\nsubstantive race differences in the model. This issue is\nknown as the problem of factorial invariance (Bollen, 1989).\nIt is important to conduct tests for factorial invariance be-\ncause the wide majority of studies on race differences in\nreligion overlook this fundamental measurement issue.\nTests for factorial invariance are performed in two steps.\nFirst, the factor loadings are constrained to be equivalent in\nthe two groups (Model 2). If this equality constraint does\nnot change the fit of the model to the data significantly (as\nreflected in change in 2 values), it is left in force when the\nnext model is estimated. Model 3 tests a higher order, more\nrestrictive, form of measurement equivalence. In particular,\nthe measurement error terms associated with the observed\nindicators are constrained to be equivalent across groups.\nOnce again, if this constraint does not change the fit of the\nmodel to the data significantly, it is left in place when the next\nmodel is evaluated.\nFollowing tests for factorial invariance, the next step in-\nvolves assessing whether there are race differences in the\nsubstantive relationships among the constructs shown in\nFigure 1. This is done in two steps. First, all the relation-\nships among all the latent variables in Figure 1 are simulta-\nneously constrained to be equivalent across groups (Model\n4). This test is not unlike the overall F test in ordinary least-\nsquares multiple regression analyses. The intent is to avoid\ncapitalizing on chance by making a single pass through the\ndata to see if any of the substantive relationships differ for\nolder White and older Black people. If the fit of the model to\nthe data deteriorates because of this comprehensive equiva-\nlence constraint, then it is permissible to conduct additional\ntests to see precisely where race differences arise. This latter\nseries of tests (not shown in Table 2) involves working sys-\ntematically through the model to see if each individual link-\nage differs across the two racial groups. So, for example,\none test would involve constraining just the parameter esti-\nmate for the relationship between congregational cohesive-\nness and spiritual support to be equivalent across groups.\nRESULTS\nDifferential Involvement in Religion\nThe findings from the analyses that were designed to ex-\namine the differential involvement perspective are presented\nin three sections. First, the fit of the pooled latent variable\nmodel to the data is examined. Following this, the psycho-\nmetric properties of the study measures are assessed. Fi-\nnally, the substantive findings are reviewed.\nFit of the model to the data.--Data indicate that the fit\nof the latent variable model in Figure 1 to the data was\ngood. More specifically, the Bentler-Bonett Normed Fit In-\nabove the recommended cutpoint of 0.900. Similarly, the\nstandardized root mean square residual estimate of 0.025 is\nFinally, the Bollen's (1989) Incremental Fit Index (IFI)\nvalue of 0.978, as well as the Tucker-Lewis coefficient\nthe ideal target value of 1.0 for these indices.\nPsychometric properties of the observed indicators.--\nTable 3 contains the factor loadings and measurement error\nterms that were derived from estimating the model in Figure\n1. These coefficients are important because they provide\npreliminary information about the psychometric properties\nof the study measures. Although there are no firm guidelines\nin the literature, experience suggests that factor loadings in\nexcess of 0.400 indicate that observed indicators tend to\nhave reasonably good reliability and validity. As the data in\nTable 3 reveal, the factor loadings range from 0.607 to\n0.932, suggesting that the measures used in this study have\nadequate psychometric properties.\nAlthough the factor loadings and measurement error\nterms associated with the observed indicators provide useful\ninformation about the reliability of each item, it would be\nhelpful to know something about the reliability of the scales\ntaken as a whole. Fortunately, it is possible to compute these\nestimates with a formula provided by Rock, Werts, Linn,\nand J\u00f6reskog (1977). Applying this formula to the data in\nTable 3 yields the following reliability estimates for the\ncomposite measures in this study: Congregational cohesive-\nTable 2.

These reliability estimates are reassuring\nbecause they provide one way of demonstrating that the\ntime-consuming item development strategy followed in this\nSubstantive findings.--Table 4 contains estimates of the\nsubstantive relationships among the constructs depicted in\nFigure 1. Consistent with the differential involvement hy-\npothesis, data reveal that older Black people are more\ndeeply involved in religion than older White people. More\nspecifically, the findings reveal that, compared with older\nBlack people, older White people report that their congrega-\nolder White people indicate that they receive less spiritual\nAfrican Americans. Data further suggest that, compared\nwith older Black people, older White people do not feel as\ntrast, no significant race differences were found in church\nattendance (  .017; not significant). This would ini-\ntially appear to contradict the work of other investigators\n(e.g., Levin et al., 1994). However, it should be recalled that\npersons who never attend church or who attend worship ser-\nvices once or twice a year have been excluded from the\npresent analyses. In fact, had these individuals been included\nin the analyses, then the anticipated relationship between\nrace and church attendance would have emerged from the\ndata (a table containing the results of these findings is avail-\nable from the author).\nIn addition to race differences in religion, data further\nreveal that there are race differences in optimism as well.\nConsistent with the theoretical rationale developed for this\nstudy, the findings indicate that older White people are less\noptimistic than older African Americans (  .173; p \n.001). Finally, the data suggest that older White people tend to\nrate their health slightly better than older Black people ( \nThe findings also provide support for the theoretical ratio-\nnale embedded in Figure 1. More specifically, the results\nsuggest that older adults who attend church frequently are\nmore likely to believe their congregations are highly cohe-\nsive than older people who do not go to church as often ( \natmosphere of the congregation, in turn, tends to influence\nthe amount of church-based support received by older adults.\nMore specifically, greater congregational cohesiveness is as-\nsociated with receiving more spiritual support (  .377; p \n.001) and more emotional support from one's fellow parish-\nveal that greater spiritual support is, in turn, associated with\nfeeling more closely connected with God (  .156; p \n.001). But, in contrast, emotional support from fellow\nchurch members is not related significantly to feeling con-\nnected closely with God (  .069; not significant). Taken\ntogether, these results suggest that it is explicitly religious\nsupport that promotes closeness with God and not more\ngeneral feelings of emotional closeness with fellow church\nmembers. These results underscore the importance of as-\nsessing multiple dimensions of social support in the church.\nReturning to Table 4, data further indicate that older people\nwho feel close to God tend to be more optimistic (  .247;\np  .001). Finally, as the theoretical rationale developed for\nthis study specifies, older people who are more optimistic\nindicate their health is better than older people who are less\nTaken as a whole, data reviewed up to this point provide\nsupport for the differential involvement perspective. In par-\nticular, the results suggest that older African Americans are\nmore involved in religion than older White persons, and\npeople who are more involved in religion tend to have better\nhealth. At the heart of this specification lies the simple no-\ntion that older Black people may derive greater health-\nrelated benefits from religion because they are more in-\nvolved in it.\nDifferential Impact of Religion\nThe results of the analyses that assess the differential im-\npact perspective are presented below in two sections. First,\nfindings from tests of the nested subgroup models are pre-\nsented. Second, substantive race differences in the relation-\nships among the study measures are reviewed.\nNested model tests.--Select goodness-of-fit measures\nfor the tests of the nested models are presented in Table 5.\nAs the data in this table reveal, the fit of the baseline model\nTable 3.

Evidence of this\nmay be found by examining the change in chi-square values\nfreedom is not significant). It may, therefore, be concluded\nthat the factor loadings are invariant across groups, and the\nequality constraint is left in place as Model 3 is tested.\nThe test of Model 3 reveals that the measurement error\nterms associated with the observed measures are not invari-\nant across groups. More specifically, the change in fit from\nModel 2 to Model 3 is statistically significant (2 change \nlevel). Viewed in conjunction with the tests for Model 2,\nthese results indicate that the factor loadings are invariant,\nwhereas the measurement error terms are not. Although it\nwould have been preferable to find that all elements in the\nmeasurement model are invariant, Reise, Widaman, and Pugh\n(1993) argue that achieving even partial invariance is ac-\nceptable and that meaningful subgroup comparisons can be\nmade even if only some of the factor loadings are invariant\nacross groups. Because all the factor loadings in the present\nstudy are the same across groups, it is concluded that the\nmeasures used in this study are sufficiently invariant to war-\nrant further examination of substantive race differences in\nthe relationship between religion and health in late life.\nReturning to Table 5, the next step in the nested model\ntesting strategy involved exploring whether all the substan-\ntive relationships among the measures shown in Figure 1 are\nthe same for older White and older Black people (see Model\n4). As the findings in Table 5 reveal, one or more of the rela-\ntionships among the substantive measures differ signifi-\ncantly by race. In particular, the change in chi-square values\n.01 level.

The\nfindings from these analyses are not presented in Table 5,\nbut a table containing the goodness-of-fit estimates from\nthese individual tests can be obtained from the author.\nThe tests for race differences in the substantive relation-\nships among the constructs in Figure 1 reveal that only 3 of\n20 relationships differ significantly across the subgroups.\nBased on the analyses conducted up to this point, a final\nmodel was estimated in which the factor loadings and the 17\ninvariant substantive relationships were constrained to be\nfreedom). Estimates provided by the NFI (.945; Bentler &\nstandardized root mean square residual index (.034) all sug-\ngest that the fit of this final model to the data was good.\nSubstantive race differences.--Because only 3 of 20 re-\nlationships in Figure 1 were found to vary across groups\ncomprising older White and older Black people, tables con-\ntaining the results of these subgroup analyses are not pro-\nvided in this article. Instead, data are provided for only\nthose instances in which statistically significant race differ-\nences emerged in the analyses. However, tables containing\nthe full subgroup study findings may be obtained from the\nauthor. Two sets of estimates will be presented when re-\nviewing the subgroup differences in the model. Standard-\nized estimates are typically of interest when working with\nvariables like congregational cohesiveness because these\nmeasures have no inherent nature metric. However, it is dif-\nficult to compare typical standardized estimates across sub-\ngroups because differences in the variances of the latent\nconstructs may become confounded with differences in the\nsubstantive relationship between the latent variables across\nsubgroups. To make direct comparisons of standardized co-\nefficients possible, the LISREL software program provides\ncommon metric standardized estimates, which are based on\npooled variances. It is for this reason that the first set of esti-\nmates to be examined consists of common metric completely\nstandardized estimates. The second set of estimates that are\nprovided are unstandardized regression coefficients.\nThe first substantive race difference in Figure 1 involved\nthe relationship between church attendance and feeling\nclosely connected to God. The findings reveal that the rela-\ntionship between church attendance and feeling more\nclosely connected to God is stronger in the subgroup con-\nsisting of older White people (common metric completely\nsubgroup comprising older African Americans (common\nnot significant). The difference between the unstandardized\nestimates in each subgroup is significant at the .01 level. At\nfirst glance, this may appear to be at odds with the theoreti-\ncal rationale provided earlier. However, it is important to\nconsider these effects within the context of the wider con-\nceptual model. The relationship examined previously rep-\nresents the direct effect of church attendance on feeling\nclosely connected with God. But, as shown in Figure 1,\nchurch attendance may also influence feeling close to God\nindirectly through congregational cohesiveness, spiritual\nsupport, and emotional support. Therefore, to get a more\ncomprehensive view of the relationship between church at-\ntendance and feelings of connectedness with God, the direct\neffects must be examined in conjunction with the indirect\nand total effects. Unfortunately, the LISREL software pro-\ngram does not provide common metric completely standard-\nized estimates for indirect and total effects. Therefore, con-\nventional standardized estimates must be used for this\npurpose. As discussed previously, there are drawbacks in re-\nlying on these coefficients. However, as the findings that fol-\nlow reveal, they still provide useful insights into the nature\nof the relationships among race, church attendance, and\nconnectedness with God. Further analysis of the subgroup\ndata reveal that the indirect effect of church attendance on\nconnectedness with God for older White people is:  \n.336; p  .001. In contrast, the indirect effects of church at-\ntendance on feeling closely connected to God for older Afri-\nViewed more generally, the total effects reveal that\nchurch attendance is related to feeling more closely con-\nnected with God among both older Black and older White\npeople. However, older Black people who attend worship\nservices often feel closer to God solely because of the indi-\nrect effects that operate through the key social factors in the\nmodel (i.e., congregational cohesiveness, spiritual support,\nand emotional support). This is consistent with theoretical\ndiscussions that highlight the pronounced social underpin-\nnings of religion in the Black community (Chatters, 2000). In\ncontrast, the social aspects of worship services also influence\nwhether older White people feel close to God; but, above and\nbeyond this, some other unmeasured factor(s) that is not in\nthe model has an influence as well (i.e., this is captured by\nthe direct effect for older White people). However, it is diffi-\ncult to identify these unmeasured influences because the lit-\nerature is not sufficiently developed at this time.\nThe second substantive race difference in the model de-\npicted in Figure 1 involved the relationship between church\nattendance and optimism. Data reveal that older Black\npeople who attend church services frequently tend to be\nmore optimistic (common metric completely standardized\nchurch attendance is associated with a slight decline in opti-\nmism among older White people (common metric com-\n.05). The difference between these estimates is significant at\nthe .01 level. It is not surprising to find that frequent church\nattendance is associated with greater optimism among older\nBlack people. Attending church services represents a time\nwhen Black people become immersed in their own culture\nand associate with other Black people who share common\nlife experiences, as well as similar cultural and religious\nvalues. Having these feelings and beliefs shared and vali-\ndated in a context that is free of discrimination and preju-\ndice may prove to be an especially important source of\nshared racial pride, hope, and optimism. In fact this is one\nreason why McRae and colleagues (1998) describe Black\nchurches as \"therapeutic systems.\"\nIt may, however, be less evident why more frequent church\nattendance is associated with less optimism among older\nWhite people. Two points may help bring the finding involv-\ning older White people into sharper focus. First, the size of\nthe direct effect is fairly modest (.096). Second, and more\nimportant, further insight may be found by considering the\nindirect and total effects that operate through the model.\nMore specifically, data indicate that the indirect effect of\nchurch attendance on optimism for older White people is:\nfects, the resulting total effect is not significant (  .060;\nnot significant). In contrast, the indirect and total effects for\np  .001, respectively. Viewed more generally, the total ef-\nfects for older White and older Black people suggest that at-\ntending church bolsters the optimism of older Black people,\nbut not older White people. Casting the findings in this way\nhelps bring the results in line with current thinking about\nrace differences in religion and optimism.\nThe final substantive race difference to emerge from the\nsubgroup analyses involved the relationship between con-\ngregational cohesiveness and spiritual support. Consistent\nwith the theoretical rationale provided earlier, data suggest\nthat the relationship between congregational cohesiveness\nand spiritual support is stronger for older Black people\n(common metric completely standardized solution  .443;\np  .001) than older White people (common metric com-\nence between these estimates is significant at the .05 level.\nThese specific race differences aside, it is important not to\nlose sight of the wider pattern of findings that have emerged\nacross this entire study. Tests of the differential involvement\nperspective indicate that older Black people appear to be\nmore involved in religion than older White people. In con-\ntrast, race differences emerged in only 3 of 20 relationships\nin the subgroup analyses, suggesting that the differential im-\npact perspective figures less prominently in explaining race\ndifferences in religion and health in late life.\nDISCUSSION\nAlthough many researchers believe that religion is associ-\nated with health, this view is not shared by all in the aca-\ndemic community. In their scathing critique of the literature,\nSloan, Bagiella, and Powell (1999) focused primarily on\nmethodological problems to call into question research on\nthe religion-health connection. Although sound research\nmethods are obviously important for establishing causal re-\nlationships, there is more to it than this. In their thought-\nprovoking discussion, Bradley and Schaefer (1998) argue\nthat finding a cogent theoretical rationale for describing the\ncausal mechanisms that are at work is just as important as\ntending to the methodological prerequisites of causality.\nThe research in the present study was guided by this ratio-\nnale. In particular, a thorough item development strategy\nand rigorous data analytic procedures were combined with a\nwell-articulated, conceptual model to outline one way in\nwhich religion may be related to the health of older people.\nDeveloping a compelling theoretical rationale for this\nstudy was not easy. With insights provided by the founders\nof sociology, a model was crafted that took social relation-\nships in the church as a point of departure (Durkheim, 1915;\nsocial theorists was hard to adapt because they did not pro-\npose explicit causal linkages that could be easily operation-\nalized and subject to rigorous empirical scrutiny. To deal\nwith this problem, a conceptual model was developed that\nwas based on theoretical discussions in traditional sociol-\nogy, findings from empirical studies, and the insights pro-\nvided by the older men and older women who participated\nin the qualitative phase of this study (Krause, 2002). This\nconceptual scheme boldly underscores the social basis of re-\nligion and health in late life. This model began by recogniz-\ning that relationships among individuals in the church are\nshaped by the frequency of attendance at worship services,\nand the larger social climate of the congregation. In the pro-\ncess, an effort was made to select constructs that are espe-\ncially salient in late life (i.e., connectedness with God) and\nthat are uniquely religious in nature (i.e., spiritual support).\nConsistent with classic views on the social underpinnings\nof religion, it was proposed that people who attend church\nmore often will report that their congregations are more\nhighly cohesive, and that congregations that were highly co-\nhesive would be more likely to provide spiritual and emo-\ntional support to the people who worship there. The model\nfurther specified that older people who receive more church-\nbased support tend to develop a closer and more personal re-\nlationship with God, and that connectedness with God is, in\nturn, related to optimism. Finally, more optimistic people\nwere hypothesized to enjoy better health. Empirical assess-\nment of this conceptual scheme provided support for these\nlinkages. However, there was one notable exception.\nData suggest that spiritual support is related to feeling\nclose to God, but emotional support from church members\nfailed to exert a statistically significant effect. In fact, church-\nbased emotional support was not associated with any of the\nconstructs that come after it in the model (i.e., closeness to\nGod, optimism, and health). Therefore, within the confines\nof the model developed for this study, the findings suggest\nthat the health-related benefits of church-based support may\nbe primarily associated with spiritual support provided by\nfellow church members.\nThere are four reasons why this research is noteworthy.\nFirst, there do not appear to be any studies on religion that\nhave gone to such lengths to devise carefully crafted mea-\nsures that are designed specifically for use with older people\n[see Krause (2002) for a discussion of this item develop-\nment strategy]. Second, data come from a nationwide sam-\nple of older adults, making it possible to generalize the find-\nings to a wider population than is typically studied in\nresearch on religion in late life. Third, this is the first time\nthat a number of constructs contained in the study model\nhave been linked to health in samples consisting of older\npeople (e.g., congregational cohesiveness, spiritual support,\nand connectedness with God). Finally, race differences were\ncarefully probed in the study model. Two contrasting views\nwere evaluated to specify more clearly how the relationship\nbetween religion and health may differ for older White and\nolder Black people: The differential involvement perspec-\ntive and the differential impact perspective. Fairly pro-\nnounced race differences emerged from the findings. How-\never, the weight of the evidence clearly appeared to favor\nthe differential involvement view--older Black people may\nbe more likely to reap the benefits afforded by religion be-\ncause they are more involved in it. This appears to be the\nfirst time in the literature that a set of invariant measures\nhave been used to evaluate race differences in the social as-\npects of religion and health with a large national sample of\nolder White and older Black people.\nAlthough the analyses produced a number of new insights,\nthe conceptual model was relatively straightforward. As a re-\nsult, those wishing to pursue some of the ideas proposed in\nthis study might begin by developing models that flush out\nvarious aspects of the theoretical rationale in greater detail.\nFor example, a model might be crafted to explore more fully\nhow individuals come to believe that people in their congrega-\ntion share their values, beliefs, and outlook on life. Church\nsize was described earlier, but testing for denominational dif-\nferences might also provide valuable insight. More specifi-\ncally, it might be useful to see if more fundamentalist denomi-\nnations tend to be more cohesive than denominations with a\nmore mainline or liberal perspective (Stark & Finke, 2000).\nResearchers might also pursue other ways to estimate the ef-\nfects of congregational cohesiveness. For example, it might be\nhelpful to interview a number of people in the same congrega-\ntion and analyze their responses to congregational cohesive-\nness measures within a multilevel, data analytic framework.\nAdditional models might be devised to explicitly assess\nwhy connectedness with God may foster and maintain an\nolder person's sense of optimism. Earlier, the work of\nKoenig (1994) was used to argue that closeness to God arises\nfrom several factors, including whether a person believed\nthat God was in control of his or her life. However, the rela-\ntionships among connectedness to God, control by God, and\noptimism were not examined empirically. It may be impor-\ntant to examine these relationships in the future.\nFinally, to arrive at a better understanding of the potential\nhealth-related benefits of church-based support, it is impor-\ntant for researchers to compare and contrast support from\nfellow parishioners with assistance obtained in secular set-\ntings (e.g., support from neighbors or friends who are not\nreligious). Although disentangling secular and sacred sup-\nport is likely to pose significant challenges (Krause, 2001),\nthis work is important because it will help researchers deter-\nmine whether there is something truly unique about reli-\ngious support or whether it merely reflects the influence of\na largely secular process that happens to be taking place\nwithin the context of a particular organization.\nIn the process of exploring ways to expand the model that\nwas devised for the present study, it is important to keep the\nlimitations of this study in mind. Four limitations are re-\nviewed briefly herein.\nFirst, data for this study were gathered at a single point in\ntime. Consequently, the temporal ordering among the study\nconstructs was based on theoretical considerations alone. As\na result, the proposed causal ordering could be reversed by\narguing, for example, that receiving more spiritual support\npromotes the belief that one's congregation is more cohe-\nsive. Clearly, this as well as other causal assumptions that\nare embedded in the study model should be rigorously eval-\nuated with data that have been collected at more than one\npoint in time.\nSecond, with the exception of church attendance and the\ndemographic control variables, the measures used in this\nstudy call for subjective evaluations of religion and health.\nThe fact that these measures are correlated may be inter-\npreted in two ways. One view, which is reflected in the\nmodel depicted in Figure 1, specifies that these correlations\nreflect underlying causal processes. So, for example, it is\nproposed that spiritual support leads older people to feel\ncloser to God. But a second interpretation of these correla-\ntions is possible. Instead of reflecting causal processes, the\ncorrelations among the subjective measures may capture\nthe influence of what Diener and associates (2000) call dis-\npositional positivity. This means that some individuals have\na propensity to evaluate various facets of life in a good way,\nand that this disposition operates over and above more ob-\njective influences. Cast within the context of the present\nstudy, this means that older people may rate spiritual sup-\nport favorably and closeness to God favorably not because\nthe former causes the latter, but because these evaluations\nreflect a general underlying tendency to view things in more\npositive ways. There is no clear way to resolve this issue at\nthe present time, but it should be kept in mind as the find-\nings from this study are reviewed.\nThird, health was assessed in the present study with a sin-\ngle self-reported item. Although this indicator is used fre-\nquently in research, greater insights into the nature of reli-\ngion and health may be obtained if researchers examine\nother health outcomes, such as physical functioning or spe-\ncific chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension). Moreover, using\nmore traditional biomedical markers of health (e.g., blood\npressure measurements) would add further credibility to the\nconnection between religion and health in late life.\nFourth, as the work of Wuthnow (1994) reveals, people\ncan receive significant spiritual support from formal\ngroups in the church, such as Bible study and prayer\ngroups. However, when spiritual support was evaluated in\nthe present study, the respondents were instructed not to\ninclude spiritual support obtained from these formal\ngroups. Clearly, a high priority for the future is to com-\npare and contrast the effects of support obtained from for-\nmal church groups with support received informally from\nfellow church members.\nReligion is an incredibly vast conceptual domain that\ncontains a bewildering number of facets or dimensions. As a\nresult, it is difficult to identify, measure, and analyze all the\nways in which religion may be related to health. This chal-\nlenge was recognized many years ago by James (1902/\n1997), when he wrote his classic treatise on religion. In par-\nticular, he argued that, \"The divine can mean no single qual-\nity, it must mean a group of qualities, by being champions\nof which in alternation, different men may all find worthy\nmissions . . . So a `god of battles' must be allowed to be the\ngod for one kind of person, a god of peace and heaven and\nhome, the god of another. We must frankly recognize the\nfact that we live in partial systems, and that parts are not in-\nWhen viewed at the broadest level, the greatest contribution\nof the present study may arise from the fact that it provides\nuseful procedures and templates to help other investigators\nframe their approach to studying the challenging, but\ngreatly rewarding, relationship between religion and health\nin late life.\n"
