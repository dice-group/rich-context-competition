The pooled data set in-\ncluded information on 4567 unique PCPs and 3 years of claims\nfor each beneficiary (Figure 1).\nWe used the first year of observation in each 3-year period to\nidentify exclusion criteria and adjust for comorbidities. Using\nthe second year of observation, we identified beneficiaries as\nhaving an episode of acute LBP if they had relevant diagnostic\ncodes from an ambulatory or emergency department visit but\nlacked similar diagnostic codes within the 6 previous months.\nTo assess imaging, we examined Medicare claims from inpa-\ntient, outpatient, and professional services files to detect ra-\ndiologic studies of the lower back within 6 months of the in-\ncident LBP diagnosis. We derived diagnostic codes used to\nidentify LBP and procedure codes used to identify imaging pro-\ncedures from the measure of inappropriate imaging for LBP de-\nveloped by the National Committee on Quality Assurance\nStarting with the earlier round of the CTS survey, we used the\nUnique Physician Identification Number (UPIN) to identify the\nphysician who billed for the greatest number of evaluation and\nmanagement visits during the entire observation period (Janu-\nsimilarly identified eligible PCPs from the later round of the\neficiaries whose \"plurality\" physician was a CTS PCP. To as-\nsess the robustness of our results to methods of attribution, we\nconducted 2 separate analyses attributing beneficiaries who (1)\nhad any evaluation and management visits with the CTS PCP\nduring the observation period and (2) had their initial LBP di-\nagnosis coded by the CTS PCP. To identify whether the imaging\nstudy was conducted in the same organization in which the\nCTS PCP worked, we used the tax identification number\nassociated with each physician's UPIN on claims.\nEligible patients were enrolled in Medicare for at least 6 months\nafter the incident diagnosis of LBP. Thus, identified episodes\ncontinuously enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare through the\nhospice or nursing homes.

Thus, patients\nwhose claims indicated neurologic deficit, trauma, low impact\ninjuries, cancer, infection, nonspecific anemias, or constitu-\ntional symptoms suggestive of increased cancer risk were ex-\ncluded. Detailed criteria for identifying patients with uncom-\nplicated LBP are given in eTable 1 (http://www.archinternmed\n.com).\nIn primary analyses, we examined the rapidity and modality\nof imaging. We defined rapidity of imaging as an ordinal vari-\nable based on timing of the first imaging study--no imaging\ndays), or rapid (within 28 days). Modality of imaging was de-\nfined as a separate ordinal variable--no imaging, radiography\nonly, or computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging\n(CT/MRI).

On balance,\ndo these incentives favor reducing services to individual pa-\ntients, favor expanding services to individual patients, or fa-\nvor neither?\"; and (3) a composite 9-category variable con-\nstructed from a set of questions identifying factors on which\nphysicians' compensation was based (only his or her own pro-\nductivity; only clinical quality measures; only patient satisfac-\ntion surveys; productivity and clinical quality measures; pro-\nductivity and patient satisfaction surveys, clinical quality\nmeasures and patient satisfaction surveys, all 3, or none; and\nsolo practice physicians who were not asked questions on in-\ncentives). We did not include in this composite responses about\nphysicians' exposure to incentives based on cost profiling be-\ncause this variable was not associated with rapidity or modal-\nity of imaging in bivariate or multivariate analyses.\nWe considered the individual physician's specialty (family/\ngeneral practice vs general internal medicine); number of years\nin practice; board certification; and medical school site (United\nStates/Canadavselsewhere).Practicecharacteristicsincludedtype\n(solo/2-person practice, small group of 3-10, medium group of\n11-50, large groups of 50, medical school, group/staff health\nmaintenance organization, and all other types); and the percent-\nage of practice revenues derived from Medicare, Medicaid, and\ncapitation (each categorized as tertiles). We adjusted for radiolo-\ngist supply (number of patient care radiologists per capita in the\nmetropolitan statistical area), and urban vs rural location.13 Fi-\nnally, to control for unmeasured market factors, we included a\ndummy for each of the 60 metropolitan areas in the CTS sample.\nUsing claims from the 6-month period subsequent to LBP di-\nagnosis, we examined the rate of potential \"cascade effects\" of\nimaging and clinical conditions that might post hoc justify\nimaging that beneficiaries received as well as its rapidity. We\nconsidered (1) hospitalization or surgery for LBP,14 (2) com-\nplications or progression of LBP, and (3) new diagnoses of low\nback fractures or cancers with potential for bone metastases\n(eTable 2).\nWe performed ordered logit regressions with either the\nrapidity or modality of imaging as the dependent variable\n(the referent was no imaging).

These results are consistent with previously\nreported patterns of care in terms of groups who tend to\nreceive fewer services, although in our study, the pat-\nterns represent better quality care than when measuring\nquality in terms of underuse.15,16 Our findings were con-\nsistent across the timing or number of imaging studies\nand for all modalities. Moreover, patients cared for by\nphysicians exposed to incentives based on patient satis-\nfaction received more rapid and advanced imaging.\nConversely, those whose physicians were exposed to\nboth clinical quality and productivity incentives\nreceived less rapid and advanced imaging.\nThe association between exposure to satisfaction in-\ncentives and the level of imaging is not unexpected. Pa-\ntients may consider imaging reassuring, and those with\nhigher socioeconomic status may be more successful in\nobtaining testing in this context. 17 However, in contrast\nto generally underused services such as diabetic moni-\ntoring, more rapid or advanced imaging for LBP may not\nbenefit patients and may result in harm.18,19\nContrary to our hypothesis that incentives focused on\nunderuse might result in greater potential overuse, we\nobserved an inverse association between exposure to clini-\ncal quality incentives and the level of imaging.

This could reflect a broad eco-\nlogic effect if physicians exposed to existing incentives\nbecome more generally aware of and adherent to clini-\ncal practice guidelines.20 Alternatively, physicians ex-\nposed to quality measurement may be less vulnerable to\nthe effects of incentives that encourage imaging.\nWe also found that exposure to both clinical quality\nand satisfaction incentives among a small fraction of PCPs\nresulted in less rapid or advanced imaging than with either\nincentive alone or no incentives at all. Although some\nprior studies suggest that patient satisfaction tends to cor-\nthe experiences of Medicare beneficiaries in the fee-for-\nservice vs managed care programs and found instead that\nthe 2 systems had different strengths in quality vs satis-\nfaction performance. Our findings are also consistent with\nthose of Weyer et al,24 who reported that improvements\nin preventive services were associated with declines in\npatient satisfaction. Although our results require confir-\nmation in larger populations of physicians facing this rela-\ntively rare combination of incentives, it is possible that\nphysicians less pressured to maximize visit volume can\nbetter align their efforts to perform well on both clinical\nquality and patient satisfaction (eg, by spending more time\nproviding reassurance about deferred imaging). How-\never, these benefits would accrue to relatively few pa-\ntients because far more physicians face productivity in-\ncentives than other types of incentives.25\nWe found that one-third of imaging studies were per-\nformed within the PCP's practice organization and that\npatients treated in large group practices were modestly\nmore likely to receive rapid and advanced imaging than\nthose treated in smaller practices. Since large groups are\nmore likely to have the resources to invest in imaging\nequipment,26 our results are consistent with other stud-\nies suggesting that practice-owned equipment results in\nsupplier-induced demand and physician self-referral.27\nThese associations were independent of the higher like-\nlihood that physicians in large practices were exposed\nto performance incentives. They contrast with studies\nTable 3.

These care patterns are incon-\nsistent with guidelines that recommend a trial of con-\nservative therapy first and suggest opportunities for qual-\nity improvement.\nOur results should be interpreted within the context\nof our analytic approach. We could not determine ap-\npropriateness of imaging for a given patient. Ours is a\ncomparative analysis of the level of imaging relative to\npatient, physician, and practice characteristics and not\nan attempt to benchmark the behavior of individual phy-\nsicians. The inability to identify particular cases of over-\nuse with certainty does not invalidate our findings be-\ncause all physicians are subject to such errors in coding\nand ascertainment. As an example, for our results to be\nbiased, physicians would have to be more likely to code\ndiagnoses of \"red flag\" conditions for minority patients\nthan for white patients at the same time that they are less\nlikely to order imaging studies for minority patients.

Thus, regardless of the in-\nvolvement of other providers, the level of imaging ap-\npears to be related to the characteristics of a patient's PCP.\nOur findings require confirmation with a broader set\nof overuse measures but nevertheless have important im-\nplications. Development of more overuse metrics would\nbalance out current measures that are heavily weighted\ntoward underuse, perhaps by leveraging research on the\ncomparative effectiveness of different treatment op-\ntions.30 It is not surprising that physicians and practices\nwith attributes associated with underuse of care are less\nlikely to overuse imaging. However, our results may pro-\nvide a rationale for tailoring packages of performance met-\nrics to practice attributes. For example, a practice with\nhigh Medicaid revenue, many minority patients, and mini-\nmal physician incentives for maximizing patient satis-\nfaction may be more likely to benefit from measures em-\nphasizing underuse. In contrast, practices with less\nMedicaid revenue, fewer minority patients, and more sat-\nisfaction-based incentives may be more likely to benefit\nfrom performance measures that include overuse.\nMore balanced measurement of overuse and under-\nuse might also allow insurers to design incentives to\ncounter both. For example, insurers could offer higher\ncopayments for services that tend to be overused but lower\nor no copayments for generally underused services. Simi-\nlarly, bonuses could encourage physicians to avoid over-\nused services or increase underused services. Manda-\ntory delays in ordering overused services in the absence\nof clinical \"red flags\" is another alternative tool. Such in-\nterventions would need to avoid limiting necessary care,\nparticularly for low-income patients, but in the context\nof fee-for-service reimbursement, targeted and balanced\nincentives could better align the dual goals of quality im-\nprovement and cost containment.\nPatterns of care revealed by the application of a single\nmeasure of potential overuse point to different foci for\nperformance improvement than when measurement fo-\ncuses on underuse. Given possible reversal in direction\nfrom the typical \"quality advantage\" for important sub-\npopulations of patients and physicians, measuring over-\nuse alongside underuse may be critical for improving the\noverall appropriateness of care.\nCorrespondence: Hoangmai H.
