As\nHirshorn (1998) has pointed out, such activities as\nroutinely getting young children ready for school in\nthe mornings, providing full-time child care for pre-\nschoolers, or serving as a custodial parent to children\nwhose parents are unwilling or unable to provide\ncare \"move the grandparent out of the more tradi-\ntional older-generation-in-the-family roles . . . and\ninto roles typically assumed by a child's parents\" (p.\nIn so doing, grandparent caregiving stretches, reorga-\nnizes, and redefines the relationships between family\nmembers; redraws the boundaries of family and, of-\nten, of household units; and redirects the transfer of\nSince 1970, two notable and diverging trends in\ngrandparent care for grandchildren have been ob-\nserved. On the one hand, this period saw a dramatic\n76% increase in the number of children under 18 liv-\ning in households maintained by a grandparent. The\nnumber of children in such households grew from 2.2\nwith particularly rapid growth since 1980 (Lugaila,\n1998). In an estimated one third of these homes nei-\nther parent was present and, since 1990, by far the\nfastest growth has been in these \"skipped generation\"\nhouseholds (Casper & Bryson, 1998) in which grand-\nparents are typically the sole or primary caregiver. A\nnumber of factors help explain the increase in grand-\nparents raising grandchildren, including parental sub-\nstance abuse, teen pregnancy, AIDS, unemployment,\nand incarceration, as well as legal and policy changes\nfavoring kinship care over other placement arrange-\nAlthough custodial care among grandparents has\nincreased substantially, the proportion of young chil-\ndren for whom noncustodial grandparents and other\nrelatives are the main source of child care has de-\nclined dramatically, corresponding to the rise in\nmore formal center-based child care arrangements. A\nfivefold increase in center-based child care (from 6%\nto 30% of all child care arrangements) occurred be-\nremained constant at about 17% and nonparental\nrelative care declined from 33% to 25% (Hofferth,\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the Robert Wood Johnson Foun-\ndation and the Archstone Foundation for their support of this research.\nWe thank the reviewers for their helpful comments on an earlier version of\nthe manuscript.\nAddress correspondence to Esme Fuller Thomson, PhD, Faculty of So-\ncial Work, University of Toronto, 246 Bloor St. W, Toronto, Canada,\nM5S 1A1.

When the discussion is confined to preschool\nchildren whose mothers work full time, 1993 census\ndata indicate that more than one million preschool-\ners are cared for by their grandparents (Casper,\nwhose mothers work full time (Casper, 1996) and\nIncreased female labor force participation (affect-\ning both young mothers and midlife grandmothers),\nthe rise in single-headed households (leaving mothers\nwith fewer relatives to call upon for assistance), and\na growing parental belief in the value of nonfamily\nchild care in socializing young children for school ap-\npear largely to have spurred these changes (Hofferth,\n1996). Although noncustodial grandparents no longer\nconstitute the primary source of nonparental child\ncare for children, they remain frequently called-upon\nsources of child care on a regular basis. Research by\ndata from the National Survey of Families and\nHouseholds, for example, suggested that 43% of\ngrandparents provided child care for their grand-\nchildren at least once monthly. Similarly, Bass and\nCaro's (1996) research, using national field poll\ndata, found that 32% of individuals with grandchil-\ndren or great grandchildren had provided care for at\nleast one hour during the previous week. Of those\nproviding care, 13.6 hours constituted the average\ntime devoted to this activity. Data like these are help-\nful in highlighting the high proportion of grandpar-\nents who provide at least some care to their grand-\nchildren on a weekly or monthly basis. Yet, they tell\nus little about those grandparents who, while not de-\nfining themselves as the primary caregiver of their\ngrandchildren, nevertheless provide extensive child\ncare on a regular basis.\nSurprisingly few studies have focused primarily on\ngrandparents who play a substantial role in caring\nfor their grandchildren without crossing the line to\nbecome primary caregivers (Caputo, 1999). In one\nsuch study, Presser (1989) examined the economic\ncomplexities involved in child care provision by\ngrandparents who were providing substantial care-\ngiving to assist a parent and concluded that the jug-\ngling of work and family roles in these situations\nmay be substantial. Folk and Beller's (1993) research\nalso examined the provision of child care by relatives\nwithin the context of maternal employment, noting a\ncontinued preference for such care, particularly for\nvery young (age 3) children. Finally, several re-\nsearchers have examined the often extensive child\ncare and related roles of grandmothers in assisting\ntheir teenage daughters who have become mothers\nThe present study was designed to provide a pro-\nfile of American grandparents who provide extensive\nsecondary child care to their grandchildren, and to\ncompare and contrast this population group with\nthose who are not providing such care along a vari-\nety of social and demographic dimensions. To in-\ncrease our understanding of the continuum of child\ncare provision for grandchildren, a typology was cre-\nated that enabled us to conduct five-way compari-\nsons. We compared (1) noncustodial extensive child\ncare providers, (2) grandparents who self-defined as\nhaving been the primary caregiver for their grand-\nchildren (custodial grandparents), (3) grandparents\nproviding no child care (noncaregiver), (4) grandpar-\nents providing 10 hours a week of child care for\ntheir grandchildren (occasional caregivers), and (5)\ngrandparents providing 10\u00ad29 hours of care (inter-\nmediate caregivers).\nMethods\nSample\nThe grandparents analyzed in this study were a\nsubsample drawn from the larger two-wave nation-\nally representative panel study, the National Survey\nof Families and Households (NSFH). The surveys\nwere conducted by the Center for Demography and\nEcology at the University of Wisconsin\u00adMadison. In\nrespondents interviewed during the first wave of data\nent caregiving only occurred in the second wave of\ndata collection; therefore, all analyses reported here\nwave, 3,477 reported having one or more grandchil-\ndren. Once we deleted from the sample those who\nhad provided custodial care during the 1980s or ear-\nlier but who were no longer doing so during the\n1990s and those who had missing information on\ncare provision, 3,260 subjects remained. Of these re-\nmaining respondents, 223 provided extensive care-\ngiving during the second wave of interviews, 173\nprovided no care, and 757 provided occasional care.\nAn additional 788 grandparents provided intermedi-\nate care.\nIn order to adjust for nonresponse and for over-\nsampling of ethnic minorities, nontraditional fami-\nlies, and recently married people, a weighting vari-\nable was constructed by the NSFH. This weighting\nrepresents a sample that is demographically represen-\ntative of the coterminous United States. All analyses\nreported in this study are weighted. (Further details\non the study design and questions can be found in\nMeasures\nAs noted above, we developed five categories: one\nself-defined primary caregiver category (custodial\ngrandparents) and four groups who did not define\nthemselves as the primary caregiver (extensive, inter-\nmediate, occasional, and noncaregivers).\n\"Extensive\" caregivers were providing a signifi-\ncant proportion of their grandchild's care although\nthey did not report themselves as the primary care-\ngiver. We operationalized this variable in two ways:\nGrandparents were included if they (1) provided at\nleast 30 hours of child care in an average week and/\nor (2) cared for grandchildren for at least 90 nights\nper year.\nThirty hours a week was decided upon as the cut-\npoint in the first instance because it reflects a sub-\nstantial portion of the grandparents' week--approxi-\nmately 6 hours a day for 5 days. To determine\ngrandparents in the NSFH who provided 30 or more\nhours a week babysitting, a proxy measure was con-\nstructed. All respondents were asked how many\nhours in an average week they spent helping their\nchild and/or children age 19 or over, including all the\nfollowing kinds of help: shopping and/or transporta-\ntion; work around the house; advice or support; and\nchild care. If the grandparents did not report having\nprimary responsibility for raising a grandchild, yet\nthey did state that they helped with child care and\nthat they provided help for 30 or more hours a week,\nthey were included in our subsample of 30 hour-\na-week child care providers. In the cases where the\nrespondent provided child care and one or more of\nthe other types of assistance to their adult children, it\nwas assumed that child care represented the largest\nproportion of this time. The nonspecificity of the du-\nration question leaves some room for false positives\n(e.g., inclusion of some people who provided child\ncare for 10 hours and housework for 20 hours).\nHowever, the authors believe that this error will be\nrelatively rare.\nOur second type of extensively caregiving grand-\nparents reported that a grandchild and/or grandchil-\ndren stayed overnight at their house, without their\nparents present, for at least 90 nights per year.\nNinety nights was chosen because this exceeds the\naverage length of a child's summer holidays. Al-\nthough taking care of a grandchild for 2 months in\nthe summer reflects a significant contribution of en-\nergy and a life-style change, we felt that the 3-month\ncutpoint would limit the analysis to only the most\nheavily involved caregivers. If grandparents met the\ncriteria for either form of caregiving, they were de-\nfined as \"extensive caregivers\" (n  223). Note that\nwe could not translate the nights per year into an av-\nerage hours per week value and sum the combined\nvalue of the two types because in some cases nights\nmay reflect only 8\u00ad12 hours of caregiving (e.g., while\nthe grandchild's parent is working a night shift),\nwhereas in other cases \"nights\" reflect 24 hour-a-day\ncare (e.g., while the child visits for a month in the\nsummer).\nIntermediate caregivers provided child care for a\ngrandchild between 10 and 29 hours a week and/or\nhad their grandchild stay overnight without his or\nher parent for 7 to 89 nights.\nOccasional caregivers provided between 1 and 9\nhours of child care in an average week and/or had a\ngrandchild stay overnight without his or her parents\n1\u00ad6 days in the past year.\nNoncaregiving grandparents provided no babysit-\nting during an average week and, in the past year,\nhad not had a grandchild stay overnight without his\nor her parents.\nCustodial caregivers were grandparents who re-\nplied affirmatively to the question, \"For various rea-\nsons, grandparents sometimes take on the primary\nresponsibility for raising a grandchild. Have you ever\nhad the primary responsibility for any of your grand-\nchildren for 6 months or more?\" and who reported\nbeginning or ending caregiving during the 1990s.\nCaregivers who reported they had been primary care-\ngivers but were no longer caregiving during the\n1990s were removed from the sample so as not to\nconfound the analysis. (For a more detailed discus-\nsion and analysis of this group, see Fuller-Thomson,\nA total of 10 independent variables were included\nin the analyses. Demographic variables included age,\ngender, race (African American vs other), marital\nstatus (married vs other), education (high school\ncompletion vs not), geographic region (South vs\nother), and poverty status (above or below the pov-\nerty line). Familial variables included total number of\ngrandchildren and location of nearest child (coresi-\ndent, within 20 miles, more than 20 miles away). Fi-\nnally, self-reported closeness to grandparents was\nmeasured using the question, \"On a scale from 0 to\n10, where 0 is `not at all close' and 10 is `extremely\nclose,' how would you describe your relationship\nwith your grandchild(ren)?\"\nStatistical Analyses\nOverall prevalence of caregiving type was deter-\nmined by generating a frequency of the five catego-\nries of caregivers for all grandparents. We also were\ninterested in the percentage of extensive caregivers\namong three distinct subgroups of grandparents: (1)\nthose who had at least one grandchild under age 5 (n \n1,950), (2) those who had provided some child care\nto their grandchildren during the previous month\n(n  1,305), and (3) those who had provided at least\nsome child care in the previous month for their\ngrandchildren while their adult child was working\n(n  813). These percentages were obtained through\nfrequencies of caregiving type for each identified sub-\nsample.\nTo determine differences among the caregiving\ntype for demographic variables, chi-square tests were\nused for categorical variables, and one-way analysis\nof variance (ANOVA) tests were used for interval\nand ratio level variables. For those variables that\nreached the level of significance, it was necessary to\nconduct a further test to determine which of the\ngrandparent types differed significantly from the ex-\ntensive caregiving category. For the ratio and interval\nlevel variables, Tukey's honestly significant differ-\nence post-hoc tests were conducted. For the categori-\ncal variables, subanalyses were conducted doing pair\nby pair chi-square comparisons. To keep the overall\nsignificance level at .05, the pairwise comparisons'\nsignificance level was reduced to .013 (from .05 for\noverall significance/4 sets of comparisons).\nIn order to assess the independent contribution of\neach predictor variable while controlling for the\nother variables in the equation, it was necessary to\nconduct four logistic regression analyses with exten-\nsive caregiving coded 1 and the other four caregiving\ncategories used in succession as the reference cate-\ngory. In the first case, the sample was restricted to\nextensive caregivers (n  204) and noncaregivers (n \n1,174) who had complete data for all the indepen-\ndent variables in the analysis. In the second case, the\nsample included only extensive caregivers (n  204)\nand occasional caregivers (n  713) with complete\ndata. The third analysis was limited to extensive care-\ngivers (n  204) and intermediate caregivers (n \n736) with complete data. The final analysis included\nonly extensively caregiving grandparents (n  204)\nand custodial caregivers (n  151) with complete\ndata. This method provided odds ratios for extensive\ncaregivers in comparison to noncaregivers, occa-\nsional caregivers, intermediate caregivers, and custo-\ndial caregivers. In each analysis, all 10 independent\nvariables were entered in a block.\nIn addition to the odds ratios, two other statistics are\nreported: the R statistic and the Nagelkerke R-squared.\nThe R-statistic measures the individual partial corre-\nlation between the dependent variable and each in-\ndependent variable in logistic regression analyses\n(Norusis, 1997). The Nagelkerke R-squared value is\nanalogous to the R-square in a linear regression\nmodel (Norusis, 1997). The larger the R-squared\nvalue, the greater the explanatory power of the com-\nbination of the independent variables.\nResults\nUsing the four categories of caregivers defined\nabove, 6.8% of all grandparents were serving as exten-\nsive caregivers at the time of the interview. In contrast,\n40.4% of the grandparents in the total sample were\nnoncaregivers, 23.3% were occasional caregivers,\nprovided custodial care at some time during the 1990s.\nGrandparents who were providing both extensive and\ncustodial care (n  67) were classified as custodial care-\ngivers--a fact which may have resulted in an underesti-\nmation of the proportion of extensive caregivers.\nAge of grandchildren clearly played an important\nrole in influencing the likelihood of extensive care\nprovision, with 9% of all grandparents with a grand-\nchild under age 5 being extensive caregivers.\nOf grandparents interviewed during the 1990s,\ntheir grandchildren during the previous month. Of\nthese, 14.9% were extensive caregivers. When the\nsample was further restricted to the 813 respondents\nwho had provided at least some child care in the pre-\nvious month for their grandchildren while their adult\nchild was working, the percentage of extensive care-\nAs indicated in Table 1, significant differences\nwithin the five categories of grandparents were evi-\ndent for all the characteristics investigated. Post-hoc\ntests provided further information on which pairs\nwithin each analysis were significantly different.\nIn comparison to noncaregivers, bivariate analyses\nindicated that extensive caregivers were significantly\nfemale (65% vs 52%), to have coresident children\n(51% vs 24%), and to have reported greater close-\nscale); see Table 1. The groups were statistically sim-\nilar with respect to educational level, geographic re-\ngion, income, proportion below the poverty line, and\ntotal number of grandchildren. In order to determine\nthe individual contribution of each independent vari-\nable while other variables are held constant, a logis-\ntic regression analysis of extensive caregivers versus\nnoncaregivers was performed (see Table 2). This\nanalysis showed that, in comparison to noncaregiv-\ners, the odds of being an extensively caregiving\ngrandparent were 87% higher for married grandpar-\nents, 53% higher for grandmothers, and 77% lower\nfor those who live more than 20 miles from all their\nchildren. The odds of being an extensive caregiver\nwere higher for younger respondents (odds ratio\n[OR]  0.92 for age), for those with more grandchil-\ndren (OR  1.08), and for the grandparents who re-\nported greater closeness to their grandchildren (OR \n1.73). The R statistic indicates that age and closeness\nto grandchildren are the variables in the model that\nprovide the most explanatory power.\nIn contrast with occasional caregivers, extensively\ncaregiving grandparents were significantly younger\nto live in the South (43% vs 30%), and to have\ncoresident children (51% vs 34%). Extensive care-\ngivers were poorer than occasional caregivers; they\nwere more than twice as likely to live below the pov-\nerty line (18% vs 8%). Extensive caregivers were less\nlikely to have graduated from high school (67% vs\n81%) and reported greater closeness with their grand-\nscale); see Table 1. The logistic regression analysis\ncomparing extensive and occasional caregivers, re-\nported in Table 2, indicates that respondents who\nlived below the poverty line had 89% higher odds\nand high school graduates had 37% lower odds of\nbeing extensive caregivers. In comparison to those\nwho had coresident children, the odds of extensive\ncaregiving were low for those whose nearest child\nlived nearby and even lower for those whose nearest\n0.50, respectively). Those who reported greater\ncloseness with their grandchildren also had higher\nodds of providing extensive care (OR  1.32).\nIn comparison to intermediate caregivers, exten-\nsive caregivers were significantly younger (56.4 years\nvs 58.9 years), more likely to be African American\nvs 32%), and less likely to be a high school graduate\nearned, on average, approximately $7500 less per\nyear and were 6% more likely to be living below the\npoverty line than intermediate caregivers. The logis-\ntic regression analysis (see Table 2) indicates that ex-\ntensive caregivers had much lower odds than inter-\nmediate caregivers of all their children living outside\nthe grandparent's home. The odds were 47% lower\nthat the children of extensive grandparents lived be-\ntween 1\u00ad20 miles from the home as opposed to being\ncoresident. The odds of children living more than 20\nmiles from the grandparent's home were 57% lower\nfor extensive caregivers.\nCustodial and extensive caregivers were similar\nwith respect to most characteristics (see Table 1).\nHowever, extensive caregivers were more likely to be\nmarried (73% vs 54%) and less likely to be African\nExtensive caregiving grandparents also had fewer\ngrandchildren than did their custodial caregiving\npeers (5.2 vs 7.3 grandchildren). In the logistic re-\ngression analyses, married respondents had twice the\nodds of being extensive caregivers (see Table 2).\nWith each additional grandchild, the probability of\nproviding extensive as opposed to custodial care de-\ncreased by 5%.\nDiscussion\nThe fact that 6.8% of the grandparents in this na-\ntional sample were currently caring for a grandchild\non an extensive basis suggests that one out of every\n15 American grandparents may be doing the equiva-\nlent of almost a full-time job in terms of the hours\ndevoted to this activity. It should be noted, more-\nTable 1.

Extensive caregivers\nare grandparents who provide 30 or more hours of babysitting in an average week and/or have had a grandchild stay overnight without\nhis or her parents 90 or more nights in the past year. All four of the above caregiving groups do not define themselves as the primary car-\negiver.

When we limited our analysis to\nthose grandparents who had provided some child\ncare in the last month (40.4% of the grandparent\nsample), almost 15% were providing extensive child\ncare, as were one in five (20.2%) of those who re-\nported providing child care while their adult child\nworked. The latter finding is in keeping with earlier\nnational studies by Hofferth, Brayfield, Deich, and\nHolcomb (1991) and others (Brayfield, Deich, &\ners whose mothers worked in 1990 were receiving\nchild care primarily from grandparents and other rel-\natives, rising to 28% for low-income preschool chil-\ndren.\nOur finding that 9% of all Americans with grand-\nchildren under age 5 were providing extensive care-\ngiving to a grandchild is considerable higher than the\nU.S. Census Bureau's estimate that 5.4% of all pre-\nschoolers in 1993 were being cared for by a grand-\nparent while the mother was in full-time employment\n(Casper, 1996). The fact that the census data are re-\nstricted solely to caregiving while the grandchild's\nmother is working full-time is the likely cause of the\ndiscrepancy between the two figures. The 30 or more\nhours grandparents provide care per week may, in\nfact, be a combination of hours spent babysitting for\ndifferent families of grandchildren, each of which\nhad a mother who worked. Similarly, the 30 hours\nmay include time spent babysitting while the grand-\nchild's parents are not at work. The inclusion of 90\nor more nights in our extensive caregiving category\nTable 2.

These four caregiving groups do not define themselves as the primary caregiver.\nCustodial caregivers are grandparents who define themselves as having primary responsibility for a grandchild or grandchildren for a pe-\nriod of 6 months or more that began or ended in the 3 years preceding data collection.\nReference categories are, respectively, unmarried respondents, non-African Americans, males, respondents who did not complete high\nschool, respondents living outside the South, respondents living at or above the poverty line, and respondents with coresident children.\n95% confidence intervals (CI) for odds ratios are only provided for odds ratios that reach the p  .05 level of significance.\nwidened the scope of caregiving to include extended\nvisits and part-time night-shift work.\nIt should be recalled that, with the exception of\ncustodial caregiving, the measures utilized in this\nstudy assessed only caregiving during the past year. If\nwe were to consider the percentage of grandparents\nproviding extensive care at some point in their lives,\nthe estimates cited would undoubtedly be consider-\nably higher.\nFinally, as noted earlier, the rates of extensive\ngrandchild care provision revealed in our study omit\ntwo small but important groups: grandparents who\nwere providing such care to the offspring of teenage\nchildren, and those who at some point in the 1990s\nwere primary caregivers to one or more grandchil-\ndren. Despite recent declines, the continuing high\nrates of teenage childbirth in the United States re-\nsulted in almost half a million live births in 1999\n(Curtin & Martin, 2000). Earlier research, suggest-\ning that grandparents play a particularly important\ncaregiving role for the children of teenage parents\nscores the importance of further research that in-\ncludes this category. Similarly, the omission from our\nsample of extensive caregivers of the 67 respondents\nwho were providing both custodial and extensive\ncare decreased the percentage of extensive caregivers\nfrom 9% to the just under 7% reported.\nWhen we turned from prevalence to a sociodemo-\ngraphic profile of grandparents providing extensive\ncare to their grandchildren, an interesting picture\nemerged. As suggested above, the majority of grand-\nparents playing this role were married White women\nin their mid 50s who had five grandchildren and were\nas likely as not to have one of their own children re-\nsiding with them. Most were high school graduates,\nOur finding that extensive caregivers were signifi-\ncantly younger than noncaregivers is understandable,\nbecause younger grandparents are likely to be in bet-\nter health and hence physically and mentally better\nable to provide extensive child care than their non-\ncaregiving counterparts. The greater prevalence of\nextensive caregiving among grandmothers than grand-\nfathers similarly is in keeping with much earlier so-\nsuggesting that women do the bulk of caregiving\nover the life course. However, our finding that over a\nthird (35%) of extensive caregivers were men (com-\npared to just 23% of custodial caregivers) suggests\nthat a sizable proportion of grandfathers do in fact\nprovide considerable care for grandchildren on a reg-\nular basis, and underscores the need for further study\nof this population.\nAlthough, as noted earlier, the majority of exten-\nsive grandchild care providers in our study were\nWhite women, the fact that such grandparents were\nconsiderably more likely than noncaregivers, as well\nas occasional and intermediate care providers, to be\nAfrican American also is in keeping with the litera-\nture (Hunter, 1997). Such extensive care provision\nthus has been shown to be more normative among\nAfrican Americans, for whom the role of \"caregiver\nacross the generations\" has been a critical one histor-\nically. African American caregiving thus is rooted in\nWest African culture and tradition (Sudarkasa, 1981;\nWilson, 1989) and played a critical role in the United\nStates during and after slavery and during the great\nmigrations north after World War II (Wilson, 1989).\nAlthough most grandparents reported that they\nwere quite close to their grandchildren, the extra\ncontact experienced by extensive caregivers was as-\nsociated with significantly higher reports of closeness\nthan was experienced by noncaregivers and those\nproviding only occasional child care. This associa-\ntion may reflect the fact that greater contact allows\nfor a closer bonding with grandchildren--a phenom-\nenon also observed among custodial and intermedi-\nate care providers. An alternate explanation is that\ncloser attachment to grandchildren motivates a grand-\nparent to undertake the extensive caregiving role.\nFurther qualitative research into the nature and nu-\nances of such closeness, from the perspective of both\ngrandparents and grandchildren, is needed to help\nenrich our understanding of this phenomenon.\nExtensive caregivers more closely resembled inter-\nmediate caregivers than either noncaregivers or occa-\nsional caregivers. However, extensive caregiving grand-\nparents were from more vulnerable populations than\ntheir peers providing intermediate care: they were\nmore likely to be poor, for example, and less likely to\nhave completed high school. The presence of coresi-\ndent children (which is also likely to increase the\nodds of coresident grandchildren) is a strong predic-\ntor of extensive as opposed to intermediate care pro-\nvision. Such higher rates of coresidence may reflect\nfewer living arrangement options as a result of low\nincome and related factors, but further research\nwould be needed to substantiate this hypothesis.\nA major finding of this study was that extensive\ncaregivers appeared to resemble custodial caregivers\nto a much greater degree than did those who pro-\nvided only occasional child care. For example, al-\nthough just 8% of occasional child care providers\nlived below the poverty line, the figure was far higher\n(18%) for extensive caregivers and highest of all\n(23%) for custodial parents. Since grandparents who\nare poor are more likely to have grandchildren who\nalso live in low-income households, it may well be\nthat the former's heavy involvement in child care\nprovision reflects, in part, the prohibitive costs of\nmuch organized child care (Casper, 1996).\nThere were, of course, areas of significant differ-\nence between extensive and custodial caregivers. The\nfact that the latter were more likely to be unmarried,\nto be female, and to have more grandchildren, for\nexample, is in keeping with earlier studies (Chalfie,\n& Maguire, 1997), which demonstrated major dif-\nferences between custodial and other grandparents\nalong these dimensions. Similarly, the fact that custo-\ndial grandparents were significantly more likely to be\nAfrican American than were extensive caregivers in\nthe bivariate analyses is in keeping with the far\nhigher rates of custodial grandparenting among Afri-\ncan American grandparents, one in four of whom oc-\ncupies this role for at least 6 months (Szinovacz,\n1998). The earlier mentioned similarity between ex-\ntensive and custodial grandparent caregivers along\nmultiple dimensions, however, is of major conse-\nquence and may indeed reflect a blurring of the line\nbetween these two roles, as grandparents move from\none to the other as need dictates. The impressive\nbody of literature on custodial grandparents gener-\nated over the past decade (Burnette, 1999; Burton,\nsupplemented by studies that explore in more detail\nthe lives of both extensive and custodial grandpar-\nents, with particular attention to the trajectory of the\ncaregiving experience over time.\nIn addition, the evolving nature of the continuum\nof child care provision by grandparents needs to be\ncarefully explored within the context of the changing\ndemographic, cultural, and sociopolitical landscape\nof the United States. The rapid growth of a variety of\nboth Latino and Asian Pacific Islander populations,\nfor example, underscores the need for far greater re-\nsearch attention to the grandparental child care pro-\nvision roles of these largely neglected groups (see Bur-\nnette, 1999, and in press for important exceptions).\nChanges over time in the extent and nature of child\ncare provision within such groups as a result of accul-\nturation and other factors also should be explored\nthrough both qualitative and quantitative studies.\nFinally, sociopolitical factors, including, impor-\ntantly, the implementation of welfare reform legisla-\ntion, merit careful attention. A key informant study in\nCalifornia (Minkler, Berrick, & Needell, 1999), for\nexample, revealed considerable concern among policy\nanalysts and providers that the Personal Responsi-\nbility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act's\n(1996) work requirements and the requirement that\nunmarried teenage mothers live with a parent or\nguardian and either attend school or hold a job as a\ncondition of aid, could well result in an increasing\nnumber of middle-aged and older women being pres-\nsured to become extensive child care providers for\ntheir grandchildren. The fact that over half of exten-\nsive caregivers in this study had coresident children (as\nopposed to 29% of noncaregivers) suggests that such\ngrandmothers may already be providing considerable\nfamily care, and additional responsibility for nonresi-\ndent grandchildren may pose a substantial burden. As\nlargely neglected\" the impact of welfare reform on\ngrandparents, and efforts are needed to both monitor\nthis issue and help ensure that grandparents are sup-\nported, rather than penalized, if they indeed become\nextensive child care providers to grandchildren as a\nconsequence of the changing welfare environment.\nargued, \"grandparents and their grandchildren would\nbenefit greatly if policies and programs intended to\nhelp traditional parent\u00adchild families in times of\nneed could be extended to grandchildren\" and the\ngrandparents who often play a substantial role in\ntheir care.\nREFERENCES\nAbel, E.
