On a national level, improved quality of care has\nbeen presented as mainly depending on the improvement of\nstaff competence (by increased knowledge;Ahnlund, 2008a),\nshifting the responsibility of quality in elder care to staff\nworking closely with older people, the care workers. The\nspecific nature of this improved knowledge is, however,\ndebated and not clearly identified, and a gap exists between\nwhat policies state and what ground-level staff believe is\ndesirable (Ahnlund, 2008b), exemplifying the gap between\ntheory and practice.\nTo explore and illuminate aspects of knowledge in the\ndaily life of staff in elder care units, participant observations\nwere initiated by the first author at two elder care units in a\nmid-size city in Sweden. The two units are referred to as\nBayside Park and Stonewood Manor, both fictitious names.\nThe discussion on improving knowledge for staff in elder\ncare and its implications for practical elder care was mani-\nfested during the participant observations at the two elder\ncare units. The care workers at the two units shared their\nthoughts and views about knowledge in their work in\ngeneral, in addition to the situations the first author observed.\nShortly after beginning the participant observations at\nBayside Park, a care worker referred to (the much discussed)\nsilent knowledge, as illustrated in the quote above.\nThis text thus focuses on knowledge and more specifi-\ncally on the perception of silent knowledge, elaborated on as\na tacit knowledge. Examples from the field notes are used to\nexplore how care workers use and express this tacit knowl-\nedge in their everyday practices. The aim of this article is to\nexamine how tacit knowledge can be understood and what\nspecifies this knowledge for staff in a setting of elder care:\nHow can tacit knowledge be identified and described?\nThe following section of this article briefly introduces\nSwedish elder care relating to the concept of knowledge used\nand developed by care workers, providing the study back-\nground. The third section addresses method and analysis,\ndescribing the current project: an ethnographic study in two\nelder care units in Sweden. This analysis leads to the ethical\nconsiderations that are addressed in the fourth section.\nTheoretical links are made in the fifth section, and the\nsixth section includes findings derived from the empirical\n1J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University, Sweden\n2Linkoping University, Norrkoping, Sweden\nCorresponding Author:\nUlrika B\u00f6rjesson, The Department of Behavioral Science and Social\nWork, The School of Health Sciences, J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University, Box 1026,\nEmail: Ulrika.borjesson@hhj.hj.se\n\"You Have to Have a Certain Feeling for\nThis Work\": Exploring Tacit Knowledge\nin Elder Care\nUlrika B\u00f6rjesson1, Staffan Bengtsson1, and Elisabet Cedersund2\n Keywords\nsocial sciences, organizational behavior, management, sociology of health and illness, sociology, organizations, occupation,\nwork, sociology of work, aging and the life course\n2 SAGE Open\nmaterial, ending with a table to give an overview of the anal-\nysis.

Together, these groups amount to 14% of the popu-\nlation in that age group (Socialtj\u00e4nsten, 2012). Staff in elder\ncare in Sweden, also referred to as care workers, are employed\neither as nurse assistants or as auxiliary nurses (Ahnlund,\n2008b), as is the case at Bayside Park and Stonewood Manor.\nThe formal educational training for nurse assistants is an\nupper secondary education, health care support training, or\nnursing assistant training. Auxiliary nurses have completed\neither the Upper Secondary Health Care Program or a\nas a manager in elder care usually requires a bachelor's\ndegree in social work or social care.\nWorking in elder care is considered low status work\n(Wrede, Henriksson, H\u00f8st, Johansson, & Dybbroe, 2008)\nand is associated with stressful working conditions\n(Trydeg\u00e5rd, 2012). The situation in Swedish elder care, along\nwith care work in all the Nordic countries, has been described\nas being in crisis (Wrede et al., 2008), a characterization not\nconfined only to the Nordic countries (Longhofer & Floersch,\ngin of the knowledge crisis in social work stems from theory-\nto-practice gaps (the authors Longhofer and Floersch call\nthem \"phenomenological practice gaps\") that lead to a deval-\nuing of practical knowledge. The variations of care within\neach of the Nordic countries imply that there are multiple\ncrises rather than a crisis in one single area, thus showing the\ncomplex nature of welfare. The knowledge base for staff has\nbeen identified as one of three areas of crisis, which can fur-\nthermore be intertwined with the other two areas of crisis:\nrecruitment of personnel for care work and undervaluation of\ncare work (Wrede et al., 2008). The issue of a knowledge\nbase for staff is, however, complex because it raises ques-\ntions about the specific nature of this knowledge (Payne,\n2001). Given that this knowledge might differ among coun-\ntries, the knowledge base in social work is a national matter.2\nPayne suggests that viewing social work as a process of con-\nstructing and reconstructing knowledge is a more beneficial\nway of studying knowledge than viewing it as a given knowl-\nedge base.\nThe collected material and this text belong to a rich tradi-\ntion of researching the elder care sector. Others have\ndescribed and explained parts of elder care from the perspec-\ntive of staff, residents, or family members (Eliasson, 1994;\nfocuses specifically on tacit knowledge for staff in elder care.\nTacit knowledge, connected to professionalization, has been\narticle continues this discussion and will elaborate the issue\nof tacit knowledge below.\nMethod and Analysis\nThis article is a result of a study focusing on exploring and\nanalyzing working life conditions in elder care, with special\nattention to knowledge. To address this focus, an ethno-\ngraphic study of participant observations was initiated as a\nway of understanding the complex everyday life for care\nworkers at elder care units. The method is appropriate\naccording to Gans (1999) because it can enable the researcher\nto see what actually happens in interactions between people\nand aims at making sense of unknown worlds (Agar, 1986).\nKostera (2007) points to the objective in ethnography of\nhelping us to learn, not merely take notes of what happens,\nan intention especially appropriate when focusing on the\nissue of knowledge.\nThe first author initiated contact with the municipality\nchosen for the study in 2008 and spent 5 months going to\nthe first unit (Bayside Park) for observations. The observa-\ntions at the second unit (Stonewood Manor) were initiated\nmonths was also spent at the second unit. Both elder care\nunits are part of the public care system in the municipality\nchosen for the project. Two to three days per week were\nspent at each unit, ranging from a couple of hours per day\nto entire days. The days of the week and the times were\nalternated to yield insight into the different tasks scheduled.\nConsequently, the first author spent a total of 10 months at\nthe two separate elder care units for the participant observa-\ntions of staff in everyday work situations; in addition, the\ncontact with each unit is ongoing. The second and third\nauthors have taken part in planning the project as well as\nanalyzing material. The collected empirical material con-\nsists of notes from these observations as well as formal\ninterviews and informal conversations (small talk) with\nstaff during the observations. The observations were initi-\nated and pursued with an open characteristic, with the\nobserver engaging in the daily lives at the two elder care\nunits. The first author spent time with staff and followed\nthem around the elder care units and observed the work.\nWhen asked to help in a certain situation, the first author\nwould respond and act but would not initiate this engage-\nment. The observations were written down in a notepad,\nand the first author focused especially on capturing direct\nquotes from staff members in situations that seemed rele-\nvant considering the overall aim of the study. In this sense,\nthe analysis of the field notes as material was initiated\nwhile in the field because these observations over time\nbecame more and more focused.\nAlthough the beginning of the observations introduced an\ninterest in all of the diversity of the care work, after some\ntime in the field, the first author found it easier to focus\nB\u00f6rjesson et al. 3\nspecifically on the nature of knowledge as it took form at the\ntwo units. The hand-written field notes were subsequently\ntranscribed into a Word document. These notes were dense\nand contained no specific analysis (or feelings or emotions\nexperienced by the first author when engaging in these obser-\nvations). Documenting the field notes in this manner has\nbeen called \"na\u00efve notes\" (Tjora, 2011) and is usually fol-\nlowed by an elaborated description of events and emotions,\nas was the case in this study. The document of the observa-\ntions was thus accompanied by another document recording\nthe experience and emotions of the first author, connected to\nthese observations.\nEthnographic analysis starts when the topic of a study is\nchosen (Fetterman, 2010). After completing the participant\nobservations, a work of identifying patterns in the field notes\nproceeds. The findings are presented here as themes from the\nempirical material, similar to what Fetterman (Fetterman,\n2010) describes. The main category is tacit knowledge, con-\ntaining two main themes: \"feeling for the work\" and \"acting\nand artistry.\" The identified themes each represent several\nsituations occurring at both elder care units, and the empiri-\ncal material thus guided the deepened analysis after comple-\ntion of the observations.\nEthical Considerations\nA regional ethics research board ruled that this study did not\nneed an ethical approval but rather a recommendation of how\nto proceed (no 148-08). At both units, the managers ensured\nthat all staff members agreed to the presence of a researcher\nas a participant observer. How the discussion went when\ninforming the staff groups is, however, unknown, and the\nauthors can only trust that no one felt obligated to participate\nin the study. The first unit, Bayside Park, is a unit for people\nwith dementia. Ten older people live in their own apartments\nthat are included in the unit, connected by a kitchen and com-\nmon area. Bayside Park is a locked unit, and physical access\nto it depends on the staff. Although the apartments during the\nresearch period were kept unlocked, they were entered only\nwhen the older person (the resident) was present. During the\nobservations, the first author would accompany staff in their\nwork into the resident apartments. The second unit,\nStonewood Manor, also consists of older people living in\ntheir own apartments but is not restricted to people with\ndementia. It is a bigger unit, with apartments connected to\nthe elderly residence. The access to Stonewood Manor also\ndepends on staff, and during the study period, the first author\nwould follow them to different apartments. The staff toilet\neven had to be unlocked, as needed. At both Bayside Park\nand Stonewood Manor, there was no place for the researcher\nto withdraw.\nThe ethical implications in a study such as this need to be\naddressed along the way and cannot all be unraveled before\ninitiating the study. Several situations during the participant\nobservations presented various dilemmas to the first author.\nOne of these dilemmas was the issue of the researcher's\ninvolvement in the participant observations and how to\nrespond to requests from both care workers and residents,\nsimilarly described by Tinney (2008). This dilemma of roles\nin participant observations was addressed during the jour-\nney of the observations, resulting in the understanding that\nthe roles fluctuate over time and in various situations\n(B\u00f6rjesson, 2014). Another ethical dilemma presented itself\nwhen the participant observations at Stonewood Manor\nwere initiated and the manager wanted the first author to\nreport back experiences from the observations. This request\ncame as a surprise and was politely declined, as this approach\nwould have been unethical for the study. The participant\nobservations needed to build on a mutual respect between\nthe first author and the care workers and would not have\nbeen as candid or spontaneous if they had felt supervised\nand controlled. The implication from these experiences in\nthis study is that the ethical considerations should be seen as\nan ongoing process, rather than yielding definitive answers\nfrom the beginning.\nTheoretical Links\nSilent knowledge as a concept in practical care can in aca-\ndemic terms be described as tacit knowledge. Philosopher\nMichael Polanyi (1966) defined the concept of tacit knowl-\nedge as a nonlinguistic, intuitive, and unconscious form of\nknowledge. In other words, \"We can know more than we can\ntell\" (p. 27). Polanyi first explored the concept of tacit\nknowledge as knowing as an art, as a skill of the knower\n(1998). An example of this unconscious form of knowledge\nis offered by Polanyi (1966) in the form of how we recognize\nfaces. We can identify a familiar face among thousands of\nfaces; it is, however, less likely that we can verbally express\nexactly what we recognize about the face. This same idea\nrepresents tacit knowledge because it is intuitive and uncon-\nscious but not verbally expressed. Tacit knowledge can fur-\nthermore be derived from Edmund Husserl (the classical\nphilosopher) and the notion that we all attribute experiences\nto a taken-for-granted frame of reference. This frame of ref-\nerence means that understandings are taken for granted and\nnot articulated or even questioned. Longhofer and Floersch\n(2006) address tacit (vs. explicit) knowledge in their essay\ndiscussing the crisis in social work and its origin. Social\nwork can be said to constitute one of two broad bearings\nwhen attempting to understand its everyday practice and\noccurrences (Longhofer & Floersch, 2006). The first empha-\nsizes the subjective experience of both clients and practitio-\nners; the second viewpoint highlights \"the performance of\nsocial work activities,\" how social workers act, and the con-\nsequences of these actions. The Swedish ethnographic\nresearcher Philip Lalander (2009) discusses the concept of\nknow-how, which also bears similarities to a tacit knowl-\nedge. Know-how constitutes the specific skills and the spe-\ncific knowledge needed in a certain situation, in this case, the\n4 SAGE Open\nwork situation for staff in elder care. Know-how is based on\nexperience of the field and of the work.\nThe idea of knowledge being unarticulated and uncon-\nscious is by no means an undisputed area. Several research-\ners have addressed the problematic nature of an unconscious\nand unarticulated knowledge, such as Rolf (1995), who\npoints to several troubling issues with this idea. One is the\nmatter of knowledge necessitating a verbalization; another\none is the view that knowledge needs to be argumentative,\nconfirmed by arguments. Molander (1992) correspondingly\nraises a main problem with tacit knowledge being under-\nstood as unarticulated knowledge: How can a critical stance\ntoward knowledge be used if aspects of knowledge are tacit\nand therefore protected? This text does not aim at focusing\non those problematic aspects of tacit knowledge; rather, it\nuses the concept to deepen the understanding of the complex\nnature of care work in elder care and the specific knowledge\nneeded in this context. For the purpose of this study and anal-\nysis, Polanyi's (1966) definition of tacit knowledge is used,\nunderstanding tacit knowledge as an intuitive and uncon-\nscious form of knowledge. Nishikawa (2011) similarly links\ntacit knowledge to care workers as a way of identifying\nknowledge needed in elder care. In addition to Polanyi's\ndefinition, Nishikawa further described tacit knowledge as\npersonal and context-specific, making it difficult to formal-\nize and communicate. Nishikawa found that the contextual\naspects of care work require recognition of the dialogue and\ncollective part of care work, rather than emphasizing formal\neducation. When studying the quality of care in elder care,\nformal education was found to affect the quality of care less\nthan the context-specific reflections made (Nishikawa,\nHarald Swedner (1996), the first professor of social work\nin Sweden, compared the social work profession with a\nthree-legged stool, where the three legs symbolize compo-\nnents of the profession: knowledge, ethics, and artistry. The\nartistry and acting skills in this study are linked to a drama-\nturgical sociology. Dramaturgical sociology (Aakvaag, 2011)\nis often, though not always, associated with the symbolic\ninteractionist perspective that stems from Mead (1934) and\nBlumer (1969). Dramaturgy is a way of focusing on the\nexpressive and dramatic dimensions in interaction (Edgley,\n2003). It is interested in social acts and emergent meanings\nand is the study of how human beings accomplish meaning-\nful lives. \"It is not primarily interested in what people do, nor\nwhat they intend to do, nor even why they do it, but how they\ndo it that is the dramaturgical curiosity\" (Brissett & Edgley,\n2009, p. 3). Dramaturgical sociology entails a way of view-\ning our actions and others' responses to those actions as a\ntheater stage. According to the sociologist Goffman (1959),\nlife can be understood by viewing people as actors entering\nstages using props belonging to the setting. The performance\nis with or without fellow actors in front of an audience.\nWhen creating our self, response from an audience is vital.\nAn actor can furthermore be honest or cynical; the cynical\nactor recognizes the role being played whereas the honest\nactor identifies with the role, unaware of the acting taking\nplace.\nFindings\nThe construction and reconstruction of knowledge in practi-\ncal elder care can be described in various ways. The situation\nnoted in the quote below occurred after the first author had\nspent about 4 months at the elder care unit Stonewood Manor\nas a participant observer:\nI (the first author) am at Stonewood Manor, following Rachel (a\ntemporary worker) up to Sonja (a resident). We enter a dark\napartment; Rachel looks into the bedroom, but the bed is made\nand empty. We continue to the TV room, and there is Sonja,\nsitting/half lying down in an armchair. Rachel touches her on the\nleg and says, \"Good morning.\" She speaks loudly to Sonja.\nSonja goes into the bathroom, and Rachel goes into the kitchen.\nRachel puts a coffee pot (one that belongs to a coffee machine)\non a stove plate and turns the heat on. Sonja comes in the kitchen\nand sees this. \"But what have you done?! This is wrong; first I\nwant tea in that one (pointing at a kettle; my remark). You have\nto pour back the water now! This is no help, it is better if I do this\nmyself, this is more work for me! You are no use! You know\nnothing!\"\nRachel and I return to the staff room; Cecilia (another staff\nmember) is there when we arrive. She asks if we are ready and\nsays that we should go to G\u00f6sta (another resident). On our way\nthere, Rachel tells Cecilia that Sonja was furious with her.\nCecilia: \"Oh?\" Rachel: \"There was a pot ready so I thought that\nwas the one to use.\" Cecilia: \"No, it is the big kettle you warm\nwater in. Then you add some water to the other pot for the sugar\nto dissolve, and then you add the rest. And then you boil\nsemolina pudding, very loose. We could have told you this\nbefore you went upstairs since she is so strict about that.\" Cecilia\nlaughs. Rachel smiles back.\nAs the time as an observer continued, situations similar to\nthis one occurred. The quote thus illustrates the complex sit-\nuation in the daily life at an elder care unit and the various\nscenarios care workers face. Very specific knowledge is\nneeded in each care situation, and the responsibility to solve\neach situation lies on the care workers.\nThe Interactional Knowledge--at\nBayside Park and Stonewood Manor\nThe participant observations revealed an everyday life at the\ntwo elder care units that comprised complex relationships\nand interactions between staff members as well as between\nstaff members and residents. Two of the themes recognized\nor identified in the field notes from the two elder care units\nare \"feeling for the work\" and \"acting and artistry\"; they are\none way of understanding and explaining the tacit knowl-\nedge for staff. This section with quotes is summed up with a\nB\u00f6rjesson et al. 5\ntable to give an overview of the empirical material, before\nthe discussion:\nYou are supposed to do so much today, more and more things,\nbut we don't have any time dedicated for it . . . We do less today\nthan before; for instance, we don't administer catheters anymore.\nMore of these things are done by nurses, things that really we\ncould do. We talk a lot to relatives . . . (Care worker at Bayside\nPark)\nThe quote above was documented by the first author dur-\ning the first weeks of participant observations at Bayside\nPark. It incorporates the duality experienced in changed\nworking conditions and work tasks over time. On the one\nhand, there are more expectations and demands; on the other,\nthe staff feels as if they do fewer tasks for which they are\nspecifically qualified. The observations revealed an every-\nday life emphasizing a certain feeling required for care work\nalong with acting or artistic elements. Although many of the\nstaff members value theoretical knowledge and the impor-\ntance it has for their work, common sense may often be val-\nued even more highly. This common sense encompasses\nmuch of what is needed in everyday life at an elder care unit.\nFeeling for the Work\nCare workers at both units emphasized a specific \"feeling\"\nthat is needed when performing care work, as the quote\nbelow exemplifies:\nYou can read a lot, but you also have to have a certain feeling for\nthis work, and not everyone has that. (Care worker at Bayside\nPark)\nCare workers describe this feeling as something that you\njust have (or do not have). It is deeply embedded in a per-\nson's personality or being. When addressing this issue of a\ncertain feeling needed for their care work, \"a\" feeling is men-\ntioned. Accentuating \"a\" feeling furthermore seems to imply\nthe idea that only one version of this feeling counts and that\nthere are not several options. Only one way of understanding\nthis feeling is needed, and this specific feeling will then help\nstaff be perceptive enough to each resident's needs and thus\nensure a job well performed. This needed feeling serves as a\ntool in everyday work for the care workers. More often than\nspecific methods are mentioned and talked about, the feeling\nis the basis on which care work is then carried out.\nYou have to treat each person the way they want to be treated,\nnot the way I would want to be treated. (Care worker at Bayside\nPark)\nCare workers at Stonewood Manor similarly describe this\nimportance of a feeling and the necessity to adapt behavior\naccording to what the residents want. On one occasion, the\nfirst author was sitting withAstrid and Tove in the staff room,\nwho brought the issue up. There is a lot of laughter in the\nconversation:\nTove, to me (the first author): \"The boss has said that we need to\nbehave when you are here.\"\nAstrid nods her head saying: \"But we gotta be ourselves. She\nthinks we are annoying.\"\nTove agrees: \"There's talk about the industry but I don't know, I\nthink it's tougher here.\" We all laugh.\nYeah (saysAstrid), we are a bit tough like that, we have \"jargon,\"\nbut you have to be able to be yourself. Of course, we're not like\nthat with all of the residents. Some we have a lot of jargon with,\nbut they like it!\nFirst author: \"How do you know that?\"\nAstrid explains: \"Yeah, but you get a feeling for that pretty soon.\nIn the beginning you are a bit like: `hi, hi,' but then you just\nknow.\"\nTove nods and adds: \"You have to sense how they want to be,\nyou can't be the same way towards everyone.\"\nThe way to treat everyone individually is by being per-\nceptive of each person's needs to respond to them. Apart\nfrom the feeling emphasized, \"plain common sense\" is simi-\nlar to feelings highlighted by the care workers. This plain\ncommon sense is mentioned as one of the most important\nparts of the knowledge needed for their work, for example,\nby this care worker at Stonewood Manor:\nOn our way back to the staff room, Elsie (one of the care\nworkers) thinks out loud about the issue of knowledge and\ncompetence. \"I think that you can come a long way with plain\ncommon sense. You think about these things, what is my\ncompetence really . . .\" Elsie tells me that she sometimes thinks\nthat someone else in the staff group does something really well.\nOther colleagues solve situations in a good way. When I ask her\nif they talk about these things in the staff group, she says, \"yes,\"\nand I ask what these situations can be. \"Well, the last time it was\nAnna, who told me about Klas (a resident) having a stroke.\nWhen she told us, I thought about how well she solved that. I\ndidn't tell her then but I told her later. Damn, what great\ncolleagues I have, I'm really proud!\"\nUnlike the feeling required for care work, plain common\nsense is not infused with emotions but is about knowing what\nto do and when to do it. Plain common sense is not some-\nthing that can be acquired through education and training; it\nis acquired through experience that comes from life in gen-\neral and from work--more specifically from the care work.\nThe experiences of each care worker can also be shared\nwithin the staff groups while emphasizing each care work-\ner's specific experience and skills.\n6 SAGE Open\nActing and Artistry\nThe feeling and common sense needed in daily work at the\nelder care units also enable the care workers to act out their\nwork. At both Bayside Park and Stonewood Manor, staff\nmembers emphasize the perceptive ability needed in care\nwork and the need to adjust to each individual in each situa-\ntion. This ability is identified in this analysis as acting and\nartistry. Shortly after initiating the observations at Bayside\nPark, the first author made notes about care work that could\nbe compared with the use of masks being put on and off and\nthe idea of work duties perceived as a performance by staff.\nThe ability to incorporate an artistic skill is a part of the daily\nwork for care workers:\nAfter a few weeks of observations at Bayside Park, a journalist\nand a photographer from a local newspaper come to visit. They\nare there to hear about and see the result of a project on dancing\nand movement that some of the care workers have been involved\nin. Dancing is used as a way of connecting with the residents.\nThe care workers have prepared for this visit from the newspaper\nby asking some of the residents' relatives about consent to take\nphotos of them. Music is put on in the common area, and some\nof the care workers invite the residents to join them dancing. The\nphotographer makes sure to arrange the picture well, aiming the\ncamera at smiling residents.\nThe first author made notes about the situation above, and\nthe feeling of being an audience:\nAs the pictures are taken, the dancing fades out, the music is\nturned off and people go back to various things. It is as if the\nactors have left the stage for this time and it is empty again,\nwaiting for a new performance.\nLater, during observation of staff at Stonewood Manor,\none of the care workers brings up acting when asked about\nhow to adapt to all the different situations and different\npeople: \"One of our previous managers once said that we\nare the best actors. Since we adapt so well.\" In some\ninstances or situations at the elder care units, this adaptabil-\nity was more evident, like the episode above as well as this\none:\nWhen visiting Bayside Park one day, the first author was\nsitting in the common area in the kitchen together with some\nresidents and two staff members. One of the staff members,\nAnna, was talking to the residents and joking. Her shift was\nending, and she was about to leave for the day, as she asks the\nresidents if they would like her to sing something before she\nleaves. \"You want me to sing an aria?! Okay, la la la laaaaa!\"\nShe stands up and moves towards the door, she takes a bow to\nthe \"audience\" (the residents accompanied by a colleague and\nthe first author) and exits the locked door in a \"dramatic way,\"\nas if exiting an opera stage. Everyone in the \"audience\" in the\ncommon room laughs, and Alma (one of the residents) says:\n\"She should also be an inmate (here), that one!\" followed by\nmore laughter.\nWhen Alma says that Anna should be an inmate, she\nimplies being an inmate in the setting in which she herself\nlives, the elder care unit. Despite having a dementia diagno-\nsis, she is aware of her home being situated in a closed and\neven locked unit, as she talks about it in the context of being\nan inmate (in a correctional facility). Anna's performance\nbecomes a way of bonding with the residents and blurring\nthe differences between staff and residents. Anna comes to\nwork and puts her work suit on, or what staff and the man-\nager at Bayside Park call \"the professional coat.\" This coat is\nthe suit for their specific work; it encompasses knowledge\nand skills needed as well as the distance required for their\nwork. The coat is furthermore visualized by the working\nclothes care workers use, although not all staff members use\nthem. When asking about this, staff members respond that\nthe working clothes emphasize the institutional setting, an\nemphasis that they do not wish to support.\nAt Bayside Park, the staff has decided not to take long\nbreaks during their shifts. To avoid confusing the residents\nby disappearing too long, they suggested to their manager\nthat it was better to stay with the residents the whole time.\nThis idea had been under discussion for some time when the\nfirst author came to the unit and was shared by the manager,\nwho saw it as a positive thing and an act of solidarity from\nher staff. In line with the later identified theme of artistry and\nacting, the wish to skip breaks could be seen as a way of stay-\ning in character and keeping \"the show\" going.\nDiscussion\nThe situation in Swedish elder care, focusing on increased\nquality by increased knowledge for staff, has left out crucial\naspects of the understanding of knowledge production. Tacit\nknowledge is commonly referred to in care work in general\nand elder care in particular as the crucial knowledge needed\nthat does not entail theoretical knowledge from formal edu-\ncation. It has, however, received little or no recognition in\nrecent discussions about quality improvement in elder care.\nTo understand the production of knowledge in elder care and\nthus enable actual changes in practice, tacit knowledge needs\nto be recognized as a vital factor, in line with Nishikawa's\nfindings. Knowledge needed in care work cannot be acquired\nmerely through formal training, which has been the focus in\nrecent years. From the experience at Bayside Park and\nStonewood Manor, tacit knowledge can be understood as\nconsisting of a feeling for work along with artistic skills.\nThe ability to incorporate an artistic skill in the work is\nseemingly a vital part of the daily work for care workers at\nBayside Park and Stonewood Manor, as exemplified in table\n1. The quote by Alma illustrates the creation of care work as\nincluding and being dependent on the interaction of staff and\nresidents; care work is created together by staff and the peo-\nple being cared for, as discussed by Szebehely (2005), among\nothers.Alma's quote furthermore illustrates how care work is\ncreated in the moment. The moment makes the opportunity\nB\u00f6rjesson et al. 7\nbecause these interactions based on acting cannot be sched-\nuled or planned.\nAlong the lines of Goffman, the actors in this scenario are\nthe care workers who enter the stage in each encounter and\nmeet with the residents (and fellow care workers). The props\nthe care workers use are needed in the setting of elder care\nand both are found at the elder care units or sometimes\nbrought there by themselves. The performances by the care\nworkers or actors are sometimes in front of an audience of\nresidents or other care workers. The care workers at Bayside\nPark and Stonewood Manor are both honest and cynical;\nsome of them refer to the setting and the roles being played\nwhereas others seem to perform their duties with less con-\nsciousness of their setting. The examples of feeling for work\nand artistry and acting skills can be understood by using\nGoffman's (1959) theory on the self. In line with Goffman,\nthe resident apartments can be seen as the stages or open\narenas. In this scenario, the staff room provides the off-stage\narea where the care workers can relax and remove the profes-\nsional masks.\nThe line between the front and back regions can, however,\nbe unclear, as Cain (2012) illustrated and discussed. Cain\ndepicts the two regions as being both staged as well as feel-\ning authentic by care workers. At Bayside Park, the staff\nroom is very small and has just enough room for a small two-\nseat couch and a dining table and a few chairs. When staff\nmembers go there, it is to heat some food for very short\nbreaks. At Bayside Park, the kitchen and common area\nbecome a natural stage for the acting, in a more evident way\nthan at Stonewood Manor where the apartments are spread\nout and staff meet together only in the staff room. At\nStonewood Manor, the staff room consists of two rooms for\nthe care workers, and they try to meet there during the day\nfor coffee and lunch, when the schedule allows for it.\nAs an observer in the field, the first author was the audi-\nence, at times included in the performance and other times\nmerely observing the act. The staff members used their pro-\nfessional masks and performed their duties. To some extent,\nthese duties were mutually agreed with the residents and pre-\nviously decided on by the manager and the residents. This\nsetup left little room for flexibility or deviations from either\nstaff or residents. They followed their routines and stuck to\nthe script. The staff members then withdrew to the staff\nroom, which was off-stage. Here the masks were removed, to\nvarious degrees, and the staff relaxed from the pressures of\ntheir work. The staff joked about the residents and about\neach other. These jokes--when positively performed--\nformed the glue for the group. When presented in a negative\nmanner, they instead emphasized the differences in the group\nand created or fed negative emotions and feelings. The masks\nwere more easily removed and put on again at Stonewood\nManor, where there were more explicit boundaries for the\nstaff. Staff was required to perform their work and do it well,\nbut there was no talk or expectation about duties beyond that.\nThe manager was specific in requests and asked for loyalty,\nbut this was according to the schedule and did not go beyond\nthat. The manager was sometimes restrictive about extra\nduties or performances, always referring to their obligations\nby law and regulations. At Bayside Park, staff was expected\nto go beyond their work obligations. They were encouraged\nto do \"that little extra.\" Although not explicitly ordered to do\nso, the staff members who did go the extra mile could be\nconsidered more devoted to their work.\nActing, or putting on a role or mask, can furthermore be\nseen as a way of distancing oneself from others. It becomes a\nway of handling or dealing with difficult and straining work.\nWhen actively used (consciously or unconsciously), acting\nskills can serve as a tool in everyday work at elder care units.\nMoreover, \"performing\" in work can be a way of enabling\nsupport for residents in various ways. The feeling for work\ndiscussed in this text can similarly be seen as a tool in care\nwork by which care work is organized and performed. These\nTable 1. The Interactional Knowledge at Bayside Park and Stonewood Manor.\nThemes\nQuotes from the empirical\nmaterial\nHow is this expressed at Bayside Park\nand Stonewood Manor? Summary\n1. Feeling for work \"You can read a lot, but you\nalso have to have a certain\nfeeling for this kind of work\nand not everyone has that.\"\n\" . . . you can come a long way\nwith plain common sense\"\nCare workers express the importance\nof the right feeling for work, which\ncannot be attained--it is just there\n(or not).\nAs a way of emphasizing the down-\nto-earth aspects of care work, care\nworkers use common sense as an\nantipole to theoretical knowledge.\nThe theme is everyday inner\nqualities not visible but\nnevertheless a part of the daily\nroutines.\nActing skills and\nartistry\n\"You want me to sing an\naria?! Okay, la la la laaaa!,\"\n(Anna, care worker, exits in a\ndramatic way).\n\"We use our professional\ncoat.\"\nMasks are used to act out care work\nin various scenarios, both as a way\nof connecting to residents and as a\nway of distancing oneself from the\ncare work.\nProps are used in daily work (can be\nactual things or fictional).\nThe theme is of an artistic nature;\nthey are expressed and visible\nwith immediate effect.\n8 SAGE Open\ntwo identified themes stand out when observing staff in elder\ncare, and the joint understanding of them is that neither is\nachieved by academic knowledge. So, although the national\ndirectives may be an increased level of knowledge to improve\nthe quality of care for the older persons, the care workers\nthemselves have their own focus. Formal education is con-\nsidered important, but the feeling that they have for the work\nis equally important. This feeling, along with the idea that\ntheir work is carried out as acting in plays, can be said to be\npart of the tacit knowledge.\nWhen analyzing the empirical material and identifying\nthemes, several questions arose: Who decides about the\nnature of this feeling for work? Who decides whether the\nfeeling is the right one--is it fellow care workers? Using this\nmandate of deciding about the right version of feelings can\nbe a way of using one's power in a restricting environment\nand organization. Similar questions about acting in elder care\nwould benefit from further research, and the prerequisites\nand conditions for this acting should be further elaborated.\nWho can be said to be directing this act? Where is (are) the\nstage(s), and who are the actors? Inherent in the care work\nand practice is the idea of doing good for others. Being good\nor doing good is part of the professional view of caring work.\nThis being and doing can be what is expected from care\nworkers, and they can choose to live up to these expectations\nor to question them. Can acting then be a way of distancing\noneself from expectations from the organization, managers,\ncolleagues, and care recipients? Taking on a role can further\nbe a way for care workers to take on a critical approach\ntoward the work.\nWhile the organizational view on knowledge for care\nworkers (as a way of increasing the quality of care of older\npersons) is focused on theoretical formal education, this\nstudy highlights the need to recognize the knowledge shared\nthrough interaction. In line with Nishikawa (2011), this study\nshows that tacit knowledge and a context of shared knowl-\nedge are crucial aspects of care work. Further research in this\narea should include a focus on residents in the interaction\nwith staff to identify these themes and how residents use\nthem. Are residents living in an institutional setting similarly\nguided by a certain feeling for what is suitable at an elder\ncare unit, and are they similarly acting in their interactions\nwith staff?\nWe understand and recognize knowledge use for staff in\nelder care to be part of a process of knowledge making and\nknowledge shaping, through a feeling for care work along\nwith acting in daily work. This interaction occurs and is\nshared in the midst of everyday work chores. The processes\nof knowledge and job execution are closely intertwined,\nmaking it difficult to separate them or even understand them\nwithout acknowledging what links them.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1.
