It seeks to understand the logic by\nwhich ads elaborate an image of the feminine identity and,\nwhile in this process, transform the woman into a silent and\nfragmented body. Certainly, the \"woman,\" like other repre-\nsentations in advertisements, has by definition the duty to\nmake sales of products and services possible. For that reason,\nevery ad needs to maintain a constant and intense dialogue\nwith society, making a very particular cut of the innumerable\npossibilities opened by the social experiences available.\nTherefore, it is fundamental to thoroughly analyze this mate-\nrial as a way of understanding how an ideological pattern of\ncontemporary culture classifies differences between social\ngroups through consumption. Hence, in this article, I explore\nthe anthropological tradition of symbolic systems analysis,\nand with it contribute to the debate concerning social repre-\nsentations in mass communication in general and, particu-\nlarly, in advertising.\nThe themes here approached--mass communication,\nsocial identity, advertising, and culture--are complex, broad,\nand multifaceted. Their profound discussion surpasses the\nlimits to this article. Thus, they neither shall be subject to an\nexhaustive investigation, nor it is intended to explore the\nmany possibilities they unfold. However, it is important to\nrefer to the issue that relates directly to this article of wom-\nen's representations in the media and their ideological conse-\nquences. Many authors have focused on discussing the\nfeminist perspective, the politics and the power involving\nthe idealization of the woman, the uses of the female body\nimage for consumption purposes, cultural aspects of gender\nrole portrayals, and the reproduction of the traditional male\nsuperiority model in mass communication (Bordo, 1993;\nfemale magazines to analyze some of the ideological repre-\nsentations of women, whereas Lynn, Hardin, and Walsdorf\n(2004) investigated photographs of women in sports publica-\ntions, suggesting a maintained support to sexual difference\nthat would serve capitalist hegemony. Also, Kilbourne\n(2000) studied the impact of ads that target young female\nconsumers, indicating that advertising may create a kind of\naddictive effect that persuades women to recurrent consump-\ntion practices as a path for fulfilling their dreams. In this\nrespect, Banet-Weiser and Portwood-Stacer (2006) pointed\nto the construction of a postfeminist consumer that embarks\nin a project of self-actualization through cosmetic surgeries\nand diverse beauty treatments, emphasizing ideas of personal\nchoice and individualization, instead of original feminist\ncauses of social change and liberation. Goffman (1977), in\nhis classic study, discussed the ritualization of femininity\nshowing that the analysis of advertising may reveal represen-\ntations of the woman as kind, docile, and playful, construct-\ning her identity with numerous values and labels such as\n\"submissive,\" \"hidden,\" \"distanced,\" \"toy,\" \"childish,\"\n\"funny,\" \"sweet,\" and \"happy.\" Moreover, a fundamental\n1Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\nCorresponding Author:\nEverardo Rocha, Social Communication Department, Pontifical Catholic\nUniversity of Rio de Janeiro, Marques de S\u00e3o Vicente, 225, Rio de Janeiro,\nEmail: everardo@puc-rio.br\nThe Woman in Pieces: Advertising and\nthe Construction of Feminine Identity\nEverardo Rocha1\n Keywords\nanthropology of consumption, advertising and culture, communication studies, media and society, images of the woman\n2 SAGE Open\nmeaning of the woman is given when opposed to the world\nof men, classifying the feminine identity in a subordinate\nhierarchical place. The author explains how advertising fre-\nquently portrays the woman in a passive or assistant position,\nwhile the man often symbolizes a superior status and is pic-\ntured in a protective attitude, according to the social environ-\nment (familial, professional, or affective) where he interacts\nwith other participants.\nBearing all of these ideas in mind, this study should be\nseen as part of the tradition of studies on the woman's image\nin the media and an interpretation to a concrete case of adver-\ntising construction of the feminine identity in Brazil. Its goal\nis to indicate that anthropology has a distinctive way of anal-\nysis that is an important contribution for the dialogue that\nshould characterize research over the immense repertoire of\nimages, identities, representations, symbolisms, and classi-\nfying systems available throughout that what we call cultural\nindustry. In general, we believe that everything in the world\nof media changes rapidly. Advertising always seems so con-\ntemporary, modern, new and bold or, at least, in line with the\nlatest cultural trend (whatever that may be). We see it as a\nkind of radar that captures what is up to date, always pretend-\ning to indicate social changes. However, things are not\nalways what they seem. Indeed, under a certain plan of\nobservation, advertising images do identify the change.\nNevertheless, when observed in another plan, we see an\nimpressive recurrence between the meanings of such images\nin various moments. In other words, the representations and\nimages--of the woman, of the man, of the child, of the fam-\nily, and so forth--change without changing. Even though ads\nalways tend to seem new in form and in style, a careful com-\nparison unveils an amazing similarity between their struc-\ntural plans. This indicates that they seem to be in what\nL\u00e9vi-Strauss (1970) called totemic temporality--cyclic,\nnonlinear, a kind of \"time\" that bets on permanency and is\nparted from the historical order. Something like the manner\nof myths reproduces the logic by which ads are made (Rocha,\nsentations in ads of the 1980' in Brazil reveal themselves to\nbe most near to today's, composing a central axis of the col-\nlective imaginary concerning the feminine identity. Thus, to\nstudy advertisements is to perceive in them the recurrence. It\nis a way to see renewed eternal images that express a cyclic\nand totemic time. For example, Rocha and Pereira (2013)\nrecurrent, cyclic, and totemic time in representations of\nyouth in campaigns for a typical Brazilian soft drink called\n\"Guaran\u00e1.\" This temporality is an important issue to under-\nstand advertising as a speech that classifies products and\npeople through consumption.\nActually, the questions that advertising presents to thought\nare an interesting challenge for their diversity and complex-\nity. The representations and images that inhabit our imagi-\nnary form a kind of \"script\" which we enact in the daily\nexperience. The anthropological perspective may serve as a\nprivileged form of interpretation of the universe of images,\nideas, and meanings that are produced by the cultural indus-\nintellectual work in following this path of study, especially\nwhen we think of the media as one of the most active voices\noccupying public spaces in contemporary culture. Its mes-\nsages perform a drama where meanings are made public,\nwhere consensus is imposed and ideologies spread.\nThe cultural industry places society before an extensive\nrepertoire of ideas, emotions, feelings, sensations, choices,\nimpositions, and practices.Acomplex ideological universe is\nformed by representations of that society which are then con-\nstructed, repeated, and transformed through their everyday\ndissemination in texts and images of advertisements, news-\npapers, soap operas, magazines, news broadcast, movies,\nweb sites, and so on. These representations are like a system-\natic speech and, from the social actor's point of view, a\nspeech as comfortable as it is inevitable. However, this ideo-\nlogical universe transmitted by mass communication always\nhas consumption as purpose and as a way of self-mainte-\nnance. Without consumption, the media system is unfeasible.\nThe commitment to consumption--of products, services,\nideas, tastes, and feelings--calls for the use of a common\nlanguage to the public, because the media only makes sense\nin the audience. To be comprehended is a matter of mainte-\nnance. Media representations are not unilateral creation, but\nan exercise over a concrete relationship between speech and\naudience through a common code. Each product of the media\nis a bridge that establishes and fixes itself with the thoughts\nand practices of the respective consumer markets.\nThe relationship between society and cultural industry\ncan be seen as a mirror where the image doubles in countless\nrebounds. The important thing is that whatever the precise\nform of that relationship, the meanings produced by the\nmedia are public, shared and collective, which makes it dif-\nficult, for example, for someone not to understand an adver-\ntisement, radio news, television program, or newspaper\nphoto. This indicates that the study of meanings propagated\nthroughout these materials serves as clue toward the existing\nmodels, desires, and dilemmas of a culture. The cultural\nindustry raises interest because of the keys it holds within\nthat open passages to the imaginary of the society that pro-\nduces it. In this sense, I propose to investigate the most evi-\ndent traces of what ads show as the feminine identity. More\nspecifically, I suggest observing how the woman's image in\nadvertising presents a fragmented body and a silent being so\nthat products may \"speak\" for her.\nIt is important to understand that in advertisements the\nfeelings that are expressed, the privacy that is shown and the\nintimacy that is exposed are no longer individual characteris-\ntics, but, as publicly exhibited, become collective representa-\ntions. In Durkheim's (1970) sense, they are social\nrepresentations. A \"thing\" that is coercive, extensive, and\nexternal to the individual. The identities, both of the \"man\"\nand of the \"woman,\" once translated by the media, turn into\ncodes or patterns where society sees ideas, styles, and prac-\ntices. In this sense, the identities are not dimensions of the\nindividual, hovering over social, for, when transformed into\nmedia images, they no longer are a \"judgment of one's con-\nscience,\" but a collective classification constituted through\nlikewise social values. The feminine identity drawn in ads\ndoes not care for inner selves, subjective characters or mul-\ntiple faces of the psychological universe. The ad does not\nspeak of the difference between individuals or of the singu-\nlarity, because selling is betting on the far-reaching and\ngroup discourse, classifying everything that is possible as a\nconsumer public. Advertisements speak of products and ser-\nvices to reach consumers. They are generic to the extent of\ntheir markets. The media communicates through what we\nhave in common: collective representations and social\nclassifications.\nThus, I wish to retain two basic points. The first is that this\nstudy, paraphrasing Clifford Geertz (1978), is not \"about\"\nthe cultural industry, but \"in\" the cultural industry and, par-\nticularly, in advertisements, assuming the symbolic material\nthey propagate necessarily has an intense relation with soci-\nety. Ads must dialogue with receivers, they cannot be strang-\ners, or detached. These materials must fit in to the lives of\nconsumers. The second point is that the identity is inclusive.\nIt is something that encompasses the individual, and annuls\nits subjective and psychological dimensions. We shall look at\nit as a social fact, codified in the media as a behavior model,\ndefining \"what it is,\" \"what it can\" or \"what it should be\" in\nthe feminine world, as a cultural experience and a collective\nidentity.\nNext, I approach the ideas of classification and value as a\nway of thinking about social identities. The study follows\nwith a discussion on the relationship between advertising,\ntotemism, and consumption, showing how ads trigger a clas-\nsification system that is central to modern life. Afterword,\nthere will be a brief explanation about the methodology and\nthe Brazilian political redemocratization context that sug-\ngests some important ideas to understand the feminine iden-\ntity as projected by the ads of the 1980s. Finally, I will look\nto capture certain meanings of the body and its fragmentation\nas essential axes in the construction of the woman's image\nand a mechanism for promoting products and services in\nBrazil. As we are going to see, the fragmentation of the\nwoman's body is an interesting advertising strategy to create\npossibilities, spaces, and markets for different brands that\nentitle themselves as owners of each one of these pieces, set-\ntling specific territories for their various consumer goods.\nIdentity, Classification, and Value\nIdeas like identity, person, character, mask, or role can be\nrelated to the debate over performance or enactment in\neveryday life. These are terms that refer to traditional socio-\nlogical subjects--such as interaction, group, power, social\norganization, and so on--besides involving several complex\ntheories of the Social Sciences. Nonetheless, the concept of\nsocial role is among the most ordinary ideas to speak of soci-\nety. It appears in common sense through familiar expres-\nsions, such as the \"role of the fool,\" \"fulfill your role,\" or\n\"role model,\" and even in refined speeches that define proper\nroles, its attributes and functions. Similarly, the idea of \"sta-\ntus,\" somewhat close to the idea of role, has its popularity,\nand both deserve a deep study, a true archaeology of struc-\ntures and contexts by which different authors considered\nthem.\nA profound study about these concepts would have cer-\ntainly related to theater as a privileged metaphor. In Ralph\nDaherendorf's famous book Homo Sociologicus, a classic on\nthe investigation of social roles, the theater theme is clearly\npresented:\nPeople, person, character and mask are words that, while\noriginated from different stages of linguistic development, share\na common area of meaning: the theatre. In drama, for example,\nwe speak of people or characters whose roles are played by the\nactor. And, although he no longer uses the mask, this word too\nThe theater metaphor is also found in Goffman's \"drama-\nturgical perspective.\" In an interesting scheme described in\nThe Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, Goffman (1975)\nexplained that the \"self\" acts projecting his characters toward\ncharacters projected by other \"selves\" that are as well the\naudience. A third word from the theater, the audience is, in\neveryday life, formed by those who watch the performance\nof the \"self.\" All that is said right in the preface, where the\nimportance of the theater metaphor is emphasized, as the\nauthor assumes the theatrical representation as the main per-\nspective used to develop his interpretation of the self in\neveryday life.\nBack to Dahrendorf, it is clear how the idea of theater was\nexplored in Homo Sociologicus. The text begins showing the\nidea of theatrum mundi as one of the first metaphors used in\nthis sense. The human world is like an immense theatrical\ndrama and all living individuals play a single role. Next,\nDahrendorf uses the famous line of Jacques--a Shakespeare\ncharacter from the comedy \"As you like it\"--as an example\nof a new vision regarding social role. Jacques explains, \"All\nthe world's a stage and all the men and women merely play-\ners.\" In this vision, there is no longer a single role for each\nhuman being, but roles that succeed each other in time. One\nafter another--\"His acts being seven ages\"--in a sequence\nthat ends only with death. The point is that each different age\ndescribed in Shakespeare's play is also related to profes-\nsional roles, such as student, soldier, and judge. Each profes-\nsional role, in a certain sense, defines an individual in a\nFrom human life as a single role--theatrum mundi--to a\nsequence of roles during a lifetime--\"His acts being seven\nages\"--until, finally, we come to the idea of multiple and\nnon excluding roles that each of us is supposed to play. The\n4 SAGE Open\nmultiple roles that individuals may carry and how they may\nactivate each and every one of them in different moments. It\nis toward this idea that converges a great deal of the social\nrole debate. Dahrendorf (1969) created a famous example of\na situation where a certain Dr. Hans Schmidt, unknown until\nthis moment, is introduced in a meeting. Once better\nacquainted and after gathering information about him, we\ncome to acknowledge that there is only one Hans Schmidt,\nalthough he is engaged in many different positions and social\nroles: adult, man, married, citizen, of German nationality,\nfather, professor, and so on. This example shows how the\nindividual's indissolubility is a central thought concerning\nsocial identity. Dahrendorf explains the \"homo sociologicus\"\nas the tension and the intersection between the individual and\nthe society. The individual is constituted by preestablished\nroles, which are, as a counterpart, the boundaries imposed by\nsociety.\nIt is important to understand that roles and identities must\nbe thought of in the crossroads between individuality and\nsociety. Actually, it is difficult to place the individual under\nperspective, to see it as a social construction, because as\nsomething so fundamental in our culture, it is perceived as\nabsolute truth, inalienable, independent, and beyond every\nconcrete social or historical experience. This reification and\nuniversalization of the individual seems to be the path fol-\nlowed by part of the discussion on social identity. Our ethno-\ncentrism transforms the \"idea\" of the individual into\nsomething absolute. The Brazilian anthropologist Roberto\nOne could say that the English anthropology seems to present a\nkind of contradiction: if, on one side, there is a search to forming\na collective or holistic perspective, there is, on the other side, a\nneed to forever recover the individual, who is, in fact, an\nirreducible value of his own system. (p. 44)\nRoberto DaMatta criticizes a few studies of Edmund\nLeach about social organization that, like others in English\nanthropology, tend to look over society as a result of assem-\nbled trajectories, transactions, and individual strategies.\nDepicted like this, social life comes as reference, invention,\nand result of an unstoppable negotiation of private and indi-\nvidual interests. But, if we think that \"individual\" and \"indi-\nvidualism\" are concepts more related to our ideology than\nwith the effective nature of identity, we may move forward to\na less-social-centric perspective from where we can start\nthinking about social identities.\nThe individual should be seen as a social category.\nFurthermore, it is important to understand that is not every\nsociety that transforms the individual in a substance so rele-\nvant to its existence. For Western culture, the individual is\nthe center of the system, a kind of measure to many attitudes\nand thoughts before the world, and configures an inner space,\nappearing as an isolated unit opposite to the social system.\nTo us, the individual is a place of choice, owner of feelings,\nand author of our intimate novel, capable of establishing\nmany of the rules of the world we inhabit. However, it is also\nan ideological elaboration of certain social systems. The\nreality of the individual as something empirical and physical\ndoes not assure that every culture transforms it into a social\nvalue. Continuing with Roberto DaMatta (1979),\nOn one side, we have the empirically given notion of the\nindividual as concrete reality, natural, inevitable, independent of\nideologies, and collective and individual representations. Thus,\nwe know that there is no human social constitution without the\nindividual. But, between recognizing the empirical existence of\nthe individual and surprising it like a relevant and active social\nunit, capable of generating coexisting ideals of individualism\nand equalitarianism, there is a social and historical fact, a\nproduct of the development of a specific social structure: the\nWestern civilization. (p. 171)\nThere is a great distance between the empirical reality of\nthe discontinuity of bodies and individualism as an ideologi-\ncal elaboration of a given society. This distance is enough to\navoid a general and absolute understanding of social identity\nbased on the reification of the individual. So, once again, if\nwe consider the individual in a relativistic perspective, from\nwhat should identities be thought of? When placing the con-\ncept of social role in the intersection between individual and\nsociety, Dahrendorf offers a direction. If his terms--individ-\nual and society--betray the social centric angle mentioned\nby DaMatta, the idea that identity happens in an intersection\nis interesting. Better explaining, the identity is located in a\ncrossroads, but this must be free of predetermined contents.\nIt needs a place, except this place does not need to be where\nthe categories of individual and society intersect. It is a fact\nthat the individual--a value socially and historically elabo-\nrated by a \"specific social structure\"--cannot be, at the same\ntime, one of the axes that define identity to every culture. As\nsomething elaborated by a determined culture--the Western\ncivilization--the individual becomes parallel to society and\nnot paired to it, making any crossing impossible. However,\nto think the concept of social identity as an intersection\nbetween two axes, clear from contents specific to a single\nsociety, enables a relativistic point of view where two lines\nintersect, not of individual and society, but of classification\nand value.\nThis \"geometric\" metaphor serves as exercise, for it\nallows another angle to think about social identities. Like so\nmany anthropological themes, the notion requires a fine-tun-\ning involving ideas sufficiently abstract to resist the ethno-\ngraphic diversity and precise enough to interpret the concrete\nsocial experience. The reflection concerning social identity\nis a paradox, because it must suppose the specific singularity\nof every culture and, then again, the presence of the phenom-\nenon in multiple cultures. That is why the issue of social\nidentity requires an open interpretation, like the ideas of clas-\nsification and value, which result in particular forms of\nchoice and accomplishment of the concrete identity when\nintersected in any context. Classification and value are means\nof construction, operation, and distribution of social identi-\nties. Through them it is possible to walk away from the eth-\nnocentric entrapment, avoiding the Western individual as\nexplanation to the notion of identity in every society.\nClassification is a place in the structure to be necessarily\nfilled so the world becomes coherent and intelligible to social\nthe necessary coherence to wholeness means to allow multi-\nple translations among its parts; however, these parts may\npermanently serve as means to recover this wholeness. The\nintegration establishes distinct meanings, or values, that are\nspaces filled with content by the position the very classifica-\ntion system defines. Thus, classification indicates a specific\nposition, whereas value gives meaning to this position in the\nstructure. This pair, classification and value, enables one to\nunderstand how, in a given social system, local conditions\ndefine a set of local identities. In this sense, classification\nand value are ways of dealing creatively with the particular\nand the universal in social identities. Next, I propose to test\nthese ideas in advertising, making explicit its classificatory\nnature and looking at values the media uses to dress up the\nfeminine identity.\nAdvertisements, Totemic Systems, and\nConsumption\nAccording to the teachings of L\u00e9vi-Strauss (1970) in \"The\nSavage Mind,\" classifying is an exhaustive process. It is how\nculture inscribes its particularities in the world. Nothing\nwould make sense if we did not obtain meaning from every-\nthing that surrounds us. This process establishes order, dif-\nference, and meaning. The existence assumes a human\natmosphere; everything takes place, because, to us, it is\nimpossible to live in inconsistency, a kind of \"jelly world,\"\nlike Mary Douglas's (1966) fortunate expression.\nL\u00e9vi-Strauss indicated that what in anthropology was\ncalled \"totemism\" is, in fact, a homology between two sepa-\nrate systems. A classification of things that uses differences\nwithin the natural order converted into differences within the\ncultural order. The classification scheme said to be totemic is\nhow certain societies find coherence in the world through the\nexchange of messages, the mutual translation or dialog\nbetween nature and culture. Matching both systems is how\ncultures make particular \"readings\" to transform \"their\"\nworld in an integrated space. But, to find coherence in com-\nplementing nature with culture, the totemic logic needs to\nmake time cyclic instead of linear, to bet on the structure and\nits establishment, trying to suspend the passing of historical\ntime. Alternatively, societies like ours, with the central axis\nthat gives meaning to the world in the linear time plan, often\nrefuse classification systems that, like \"totemism,\" are\nmachines for the suppression of time (L\u00e9vi-Strauss, 1970).\nBut even in our societies there are openings, ruptures, and\ncontradictions that allow the existence of domains where\ncategorization operates in a way similar to the \"totemic\"\nmodel. Here we start to think of advertising as a classifica-\ntion system. In ads routinely transmitted to us a drama that\nreminds life is enacted, although painless, free of misery,\nanguish, doubt, or human frailty. Something that is just per-\nfect. Products have feelings, there is no death, and happiness\nis absolute. Children smile, women desire, men are fulfilled,\nand oldness beatifies. Ads show a world that is neither truth-\nful nor misleading: it is magical. In advertising (like in\nmyths), we can follow narratives where animals speak and\nmagical events repeat themselves. In the \"society of reason\"\nreigns a tacit commitment to believing in the impossible,\naccepting realities elaborated in ads that, based on everyday\n\"real\" life, produce idealized narratives.\nAdvertising is a way to categorize, classify, hierarchize,\nand ordinate The World of Goods (Douglas & Isherwood,\n1979) as well as relationships between people through con-\nsumption. We know the manifest function of ads is to sell\nproducts and services, but a simple observation is enough to\nnotice that, in a certain way, goods are the least consumed.\nEvery ad sells lifestyles, feelings, and worldviews, in gener-\nously larger portions than cars, clothes, or toys. Products\nand services are aimed to possible buyers, but advertising\nmessages are distributed indistinctively, indicating its clas-\nsificatory destiny. Advertising speaks of the eternal, sup-\npresses time, cuts differences in the series of production,\nand converts them into differences in the series of consump-\ntion. Advertising, then, performs the very clear function of\nmediating the opposition between those two economical\ndomains. Ads recreate products, giving them an identity,\nspecifying, and preparing them, at last, to an existence no\nlonger imbibed in the dynamic of production, but in the\nmiddle of human relations, symbolic and social, that charac-\nterize consumption.\nUnder certain aspects, production and consumption are\nsubstantially different processes. The first happens among\nmaterials and machines. Anonymity and sequencing are\nrules, and products are multiple and impersonal. Production\nis the domain where human is absent and alienated from\nwork (Marx & Engels, 1992). However, products that are\nimpersonal, sequenced, and anonymous must be consumed\nby human beings and introduced in discontinued social seg-\nments, incorporated in spheres of singularity. They must\nhave a face, a name, and a story to occupy a place in the\nsymbolic order.\nTo balance differences, advertising, and marketing need\nto skip the production process and the social history of prod-\nucts to reencounter \"humanity\" in the symbolic instance. In\nthe bourgeois world, consumption is the arena of difference\nwhere products and services are one of the central elements\nin the construction of our identities, worldviews, and life-\nstyles.Nothingisconsumedinaneutralfashion.Consumption\ntranslates a universe of distinctions; products and services\naccomplish their classificatory nature through the symbolism\nattached to them. The advertising system gives names,\n6 SAGE Open\ncontents, representations, and meanings to a constant flow of\ngoods. Many would not even make sense if a label did not\noffer them the proper classificatory information.\nAdvertising classifies products, gives meanings to ser-\nvices, positions goods, and elaborates hierarchies of objects.\nThis system draws a map of needs and reasons, or it writes a\nscript of feelings that attaches contents to types of products,\nmaking them specific brands endowed with a name, a place,\nand a meaning. Thus, advertising is an instrument of selec-\ntion and categorization of the world, creating nuances and\nparticularities in the domain of production and, mutually, dif-\nferentiating groups, situations and states of spirit in the\nhuman domain of consumption.\nThe classification principle acting within advertising\nenables the idea of studying the issue of social identity\nthrough its vast materials and, specifically in this article, how\nads choose contents that are fixed as representations of the\nwoman. But, there is still another axis--value--to under-\nstand social identity. When classification happens, it defines\na space, so, the next step is to investigate values that fill it.\nLet us see how these values operate, studying a group of ads\nthat, due to product or thematic, need to classify the feminine\nuniverse, to construct an image and to elaborate an identity\nof the woman.\nBrazilian Society in the 1980s: Notes on\nMethodology\nThis work examines a corpus of ads with the purpose to\nreveal advertising representations of women in the Brazilian\ncourses that refer to the female universe, standard one-page\nads are used here for a textual analysis (Bauer & Gaskell,\nVetter, 2000). Both the visual and the written dimensions of\nadvertisements were considered in this investigation, aiming\nto identify some of the main characteristics of women's\nmedia images of that time. Hence, the analysis reflects on the\nsyncretism between visual and verbal languages, which are\nbasic aspects of every ad in print. In effect, advertising pub-\nlished in magazines, of weekly or monthly distribution, ade-\nquately conjugate verbal language with visual and image\nmanifestations to express and materialize abstract contents,\nto fulfill its commercial purpose.\nAds were selected from five Brazilian magazines, \"Nova,\"\n\"Claudia,\" \"Playboy,\" \"Isto \u00c9,\" and \"Veja,\" which are still\namong the leading publications of the Brazilian editorial\nmarket today. The compiled material was separated into\n21 classes, according to the type of product or service\nannounced. This typology is a \"native\" process of classifying\nads used in the professional world of advertising to establish\ncategories in its innumerous contests and prizes. In a previ-\nous work (Rocha, 2010), I adopted the same criteria to ana-\nlyze the \"liquor\" class. Now, the chosen categories are\n\"cosmetics and toilette\" and \"clothing and textiles.\" The first\nincludes ads for creams, lipstick, lotions, perfumes, powder,\nbathing salts, dentifrices, deodorants, soaps, shampoos,\ndepilatories, sprays, hair dye, nail polish, brush, and comb in\ngeneral; tanners, feminine napkins, shaving razors, and\nrelated items. The second comprises ads for clothing in gen-\neral; lingerie; textiles; wools; leather goods; shoes; bed, bath,\nand table linen; and sports apparels. Both categories were\nelected because these kinds of products advertise mainly to\nthe feminine public.\nthrough 1989. Today, these publications have approximately\nabout 100 pages. At that time, as today, around 50% of an\nedition was dedicated to one-page ads. The universe is esti-\nmated in 70,000 ads, which were divided considering the\n21 categories mentioned above. Evidently, some categories\nhave more products and services advertised than others. But\non average, we can estimate there is something like 3,300\nads for each category. For this analysis, two categories were\nchosen, \"cosmetics and toilette\" and \"clothing and textiles.\"\nConsidering that, in these categories, about 20% of adver-\ntisements are directed to the male readership, there were\n5,280 ads available for examination. Nearly 5% of them\n(260 ads) offer us a significant material to discuss the wom-\nan's image, because they emphasize her body, sensuality, and\nbeauty. Among this selection, here are presented some of the\nadvertisements for the following brands: Max Factor, Chique,\nAppel, Del Rio, DeMillus, DuLoren, Lib Slip, Matitte,\nMcChad, Sulfabril, U.S. Top, Helena Rubinstein, Hidraskin,\nSkin Dew, Wella, Sanny, Power Bust Flex, and Dropnyl.\nAnother important thing that gives consistency to this tex-\ntual analysis and that may offer us some clues to understand\nthe image of women is the identification of the Brazilian his-\ntorical context in the 1980s. This should help us understand\nthe ideological patterns that appear on women representa-\ntions in ads, which are directly related to cultural models,\npolitical behavior, economic reality, and social life as experi-\nenced in great Brazilian urban centers of that time. In fact,\nthe 1980s in Brazil were characterized as a crucial moment\nof passage from a military dictatorship, which began in\nMarch 1964, to a desired redemocratization. This transition\nwas gradual, slowly conquered, but still a sustained process\nthat began in the late 1970s and was fulfilled with the presi-\ndential election in 1989, the first one to happen by popular\nvote in almost 30 years.\nIn 1960, Brazilian voters elected democratically the presi-\ndent J\u00e2nio Quadros for 5 years. However, within a year the\npresident suddenly renounced his post and was replaced by\nvice-president Jo\u00e3o Goulart. This was a period of political\nturmoil with changes in the government system from presi-\ndentialism to parlamentarism and back again. In an ideologi-\ncally complicated and tense setting, a military coups d'\u00e9tat\nregime ruled the country for the next 20 years, alternating\nfive generals in the presidency, attested by a submissive\nnational congress that was powerless to question military\ndecisions. The dictatorship created its own laws, started to\ncensor the media, violently pursued adversaries of the\nregime, and destroyed organized political groups and parties.\nThe remaining professional politicians, by personal interest\nor by lack of options, accepted the military terms and were\ndivided into the only two parties that were permitted, MDB\n(Movimento Democr\u00e1tico Brasileiro [Brazilian Democratic\nMovement]) and Arena (Gaspari, 2002a). A private Brazilian\njoke of the time said that the country possessed two parties;\none that said \"yes\" (MDB) and the other that said \"yes, sir\"\n(Arena) to military orders.\nThe dictatorship reached its most radical moment between\npublication of the \"institutional acts\" establishing nondemo-\ncratic changes in the Constitution. This is the moment of\ngreatest repression in the cultural and political levels that the\ncountry has experienced in recent history. No newspaper,\nradio, television, or magazine could publish anything with-\nout a previous censorship. The cultural production--of\nbooks, movie pictures, theater, fine arts, dance, and even\nsoap operas--was roughly censored (Gaspari, 2002b).\nBecause of this terrible climate of cultural oppression, it\nalmost became mandatory for the media, including advertis-\ning, to use patriotic elements and support the so-called\n\"Brazilian economical miracle\" in its narratives. The main\nlocal client of advertising agencies at the time was the very\ngovernment that demanded self-promotion campaigns to\nexalt its accomplishments and ideology. However, in the sec-\nond half of the 1970s, economic crisis allied to changes in\nthe international political scenario led to an increase of popu-\nlar dissatisfaction that forced the military to begin a process\nof opening the regime, including the amnesty of political\nexiled in 1979. The ads that were selected for the present\nanalysis were published during the 1980s, a period of increas-\ning political and cultural flexibility, with elections of state\ngovernors by popular vote and the election of a civil presi-\ndent by the national congress (Gaspari, 2003).\nFor the purpose of this study, this is a crucial period,\nbecause, besides incipient possibilities of once again estab-\nlishing democratic political practices, other social forces\nalso repressed by the regime started to find spaces for their\nmanifestations. This is the case of the feminist movement\nand the growing presence of women in Brazilian social, cul-\nfor example, Rede Globo, the most important Brazilian net-\nwork since that time and currently among the biggest of the\nworld, launched two television shows that placed women's\neveryday problems and possibilities as central issues of\ndebate. One of them was a prime time fictional series called\n\"Malu Mulher\" (in English, Malu Woman) that approached\nthemes such as female work, masculine oppression, sexual\nand affective conflicts, and so on. The other one was a vari-\nety show called \"TV Mulher\" (in English, TV Woman) that\ntouched from conservative things, like culinary and\ndecoration, to bold subjects, as freedom, oppression, work\nmarket, and the intimacy of the body. Incidentally, the\naggressive sexuality of films such as \"Fatal Attraction\"\n(United States, 1987), in which a man is threatened by the\nobsessive desire of a woman, was subject of exciting con-\nversations in social gatherings in Rio de Janeiro. This was\nalso a time when many women singers, such as Rita Lee,\nMaria Beth\u00e2nia, Simone, Joana, Faf\u00e1 de Bel\u00e9m, among oth-\ners, became big stars of the Brazilian pop music with songs\nthat expressed the female point of view about love, relation-\nversities and Brazilian scientific associations of the Social\nSciences, women's studies, feminism, and gender-related\nissues began to appear as respectable objects of academic\ndebates, supported by scholarships and research grants. In\n1981, the Brazilian government sanctioned the United\nNations convention of 1967 about the elimination of every\nform of discrimination against women. Also, during the\n1980s, more governmental and private companies began to\nadmit women in their staffs (Costa & Sardenberg, 2002;\nThis complex process of political and cultural redemocra-\ntization of the 1980s in Brazil is marked by, as expected, an\nincrease of repressed demands. The feminine universe repro-\nduces this exact atmosphere of breaking limits and creating\npossibilities. For women, the beginning of public discussions\nconcerning their insertion in society as professionals, sexual-\nity, maternity dilemmas, and political participation formed a\ncompound of multiple, diffuse, fragmented, and scattered\nneeds and expectations. This brief review of the redemocra-\ntization period in Brazil gives us a concrete indication to\nunderstand the cultural circumstances behind the female rep-\nresentation in advertising. Therefore, the ads analyzed in this\narticle express their connection with their time, constructing\nthe woman's image as an individual with uncertain possibili-\nties in a body that is exposed in multiple fragments and\ndesires of consumption.\nThe Body in Pieces: The Woman's\nFragmentation\nThe designated place in the classifications system and the\nhierarchical position indicate a space to be covered up with\nvalues that build the feminine identity. The first thing to be\nnoticed is that in advertising images women are classified in\na counterpart relationship before men, and also, before sev-\neral types of women. The \"woman's\" identity differentiates\nitself as well from the notions of \"girl\" or \"young lady.\" In an\nadvertisement for \"Max Factor,\" for instance, an exuberant\nwoman's picture and a line define the difference: \"Some\nthings are just better in a woman than in a girl.\" The woman's\nidentity is shaped in the advertising system by its distin-\nguished places facing the masculine universe as well as the\nideas of \"girl.\" This place may even be the same as of a\n8 SAGE Open\n\"thing,\" as a text for \"Del Rio\" lingerie, along with photos of\nwomen significantly without a face, suggests,\nIn a soft Lycra set by Del Rio many beautiful and well made\nthings fit: the Lycra bands and more resistant seam, the bra's\nshaped pad, the panty's anti-allergic cotton interior, the charming\nbackstitch, needle or lacework, and, it fits you, another pretty\nand very well made little thing.\nSimilar to a \"thing,\" different from a \"girl\" or subordinate\nto the \"man,\" the woman's identity will find a space between\ncontrasts that is covered up with values. A fundamental value\nthat articulates all others is the attribution of the idea of indi-\nvidual to the feminine identity. The need to assure the woman\nas a \"human being,\" and how she as well can be considered\nan \"individual,\" appears very clearly in a text displayed to\npromote the \"Nova\" magazine to advertising agencies:\n\"Nova is the magazine of the woman as a human being.\nNova is not the family magazine, is not the household maga-\nzine, or the children magazine. It is the magazine of the\nwoman as an individual.\" The idea of individual or of indi-\nviduality is a striking value in the construction of the wom-\nan's identity. For example, an ad for \"Chique\" perfume\nstates--\"There are many ways you can be yourself. But none\nof them are quite that chic.\" Also, like the ads transcribed\nbelow for \"Matitte\" and \"DuLoren\":\nMatitte is the jeans label that respects all your gestures, your\nexpressions and your individuality. Wherever you are, it is the\npair of jeans that follows your will to come and go freely. No\ncensures, no inhibitions. Involve yourself with Matitte jeans.\nThis summer, be a woman even underwater. Wear a DuLoren\nbathing suit. And leap. Leap in the sun, into the sea or in the\nswimming pool. Leap in fashion. With the new DuLoren\nsubmarine collection you are much more of a woman, inside or\nout of the water.\nThe ideas of \"you being yourself,\" the respect to \"indi-\nviduality\" and \"be a woman even underwater\" show the first\nsign advertisements establish in the feminine identity. It\nseems so necessary to claim the woman is \"herself,\" has a\n\"self,\" and shows \"authenticity\" as if an obvious collective\nvalue--the individual--needs to make explicit that the\nwoman belongs as well to it. To build or to reinforce the indi-\nvidual as value is a fundamental advertising operation. Ads\nmust emphasize buying as an act of will, dictated by rules of\nchoice, and the individual as its decisive instance.\nAccordingly, terms such as want, desire, choice, will, free-\ndom, and others alike are often used with eloquence in adver-\ntising narratives. These are generic ideas that can be used for\nselling dresses to women as much as for selling cars to men.\nSo far, the analysis suggests that ads for men and women can\nbe quite similar. Regardless of the identity at stake in repre-\nsentations and images, the desire to reinforce the individual\nas a central value is present. Advertisements define\nconsumption as a supposed arena of individual choices,\nimplying it as a \"natural\" act, something in the free will\nsphere, carried out in the subjective decision plan, being\naffirmation, choice and exercise of singularity. In this sense,\nan ad only synthesizes a key operation to the greater phe-\nnomenon of consumption.\nHowever, while it does not seem necessary to reinforce\nthe relationship between male \"individuality\" and consumer\ngoods, there appears to be a recurrent emphasis in connect-\ning female \"individuality\" to products and services. This dif-\nference becomes more evident when investigating values\nthat are specifically distributed to elaborate the individuality\nimbued in the feminine identity. The individual as a \"woman\"\nturns into a \"body.\" so now its possession, use, beauty, treat-\nment, and enhancement are at stake. The body is a property,\na fundamental good, and value of this individuality, a terri-\ntory of feminine action, as clearly established in many ads.\nFor example, one for \"Artemis\" expresses this idea in a sim-\nple line: \"Artemis, the best in your body.\" Another one, for\n\"DeMillus,\" is more emphatic and, after the title \"Put your\nbody in the right places\" a text compares the idea of indi-\nviduality with the woman's body:\nThe woman needs to position her body in relation to life: she\nneeds to come out with presence, stirring up love fires. To do so,\nshe must always be in the right places, letting nothing escape\nfrom all a woman has to offer. With DeMillus modelers, you put\nyour body in the right places.\nThe body as main possession, the very translation, of the\n\"woman\" individual is recurrent in several ads. But, what is\nsignificant in many of them, different from others that speak\nof the whole body, is the focus in different and fragmented\nbody parts. An ad for \"McChad\" jeans serves as an example\nof this approach, while focusing on \"waist,\" \"buttock,\" and\n\"thighs,\" along with the text \"Brazilian anatomy. Few jeans\nfabricants understand the lyrics to this samba.\" Another one\nrefers only to the \"buttock\" and, along with a meaningful\npicture, gives women an order to \"Enhance the filling of Lib\nSlip--the disposable panty.\" This body in pieces may be\ndepicted also as just the \"breasts\":\nHow to keep your breasts firm and stiff? Forget all you have\never seen about miraculous balsams, creams and ointments to\nstiffen your breasts. There is only one organic and natural way to\naccomplish this: strengthening the major pectorals. And there is\nonly a way to strengthen them: making specific exercise, like\nPower Bust Flex.\nThe body fragmentation continues in representations of\nthe woman's \"face\" that, in the following ads for \"Helena\nRubinstein\" products, appears prominently in photo and text:\nThe power of pastels. The summer makeup. Gentle tones, but\nvibrant at the same time . . . created specially to enhance your\nface in the irresistible fashion of pastels colors.\nFinally, there is a compact eye shadow that lasts longer. Have a\nfirm and uniform coloring, in a delicate movement, with the new\napplier that is adjusted to your eyes' natural curves.\nThere are many possibilities for advertising to translate\nthe feminine individuality as property of a body and its parts.\nAnd advertisements indefinitely fragment the body, breaking\nit up in as many pieces as necessary to the product--hair,\nfoot, hand, nail, eye, eyelash, leg, breast, buttock, tooth, skin,\namong others. In this dismantled body, a part outstands itself\nfor its constant need of treatment. The skin, according to ads,\nis always, somewhat \"sick\" or \"damaged\" and in need of\n\"treatment.\" As it is perceptible in the following texts,\nHidraskin. It is the most simple and efficient way to treat your\nskin. Whatever your skin type, the new Hidraskin line is the\ncomplete care you need. Make your beauty treatment with\nHidraskin and have a healthy, soft and very, very pretty skin.\nAfter creating the makeup, Max Factor creates the beauty\ntreatment within the makeup. Whipped cream makeup\ncollection, the makeup treatment. You make yourself up. You\ntreat your skin. Now, you have a makeup line so rich in\nmoisturizers that act as a beauty treatment while you are with\nyour makeup on.\nThe quite \"indecipherable\" universe of the \"skin\" and, by\ndefinition, its permanent \"lack of treatment\" is a chapter\napart, deserving another complete study for itself. And, no\nmatter the skin, because \"if you have normal or dry skin, Skin\nDew is the most complete and efficient treatment line you can\nfind.\" In this very particular fragment of the body, notions\nsuch as health, treatment, profundity, moisturizing, humec-\ntants, dry, beauty, natural oils, and others, repeat themselves,\ncreating a world at least unknown and dangerous if not prop-\nerly protected by products. A careful study of texts from\nadvertisements of \"skin\" products gives interesting clues to a\nreflection over the things this mysterious \"dermatological\"\nworld of ads is capable of. Inevitably, this reminds the atten-\ntive comments of Barthes (1972) concerning the very peculiar\nappropriation of ads over the idea of profundity:\nAll advertising of beauty products is based, as well, in a sort of\nepic representation of the intimate. The little scientific\nintroductions destined to publicize products tell us that it cleans\nin profundity, clears in profundity and nourishes in profundity,\nthat is, whatever costs, it infiltrates. Paradoxically, it is because\nthe skin, before all, is a surface, but live surface, therefore\nmortal, and susceptible of drying and ageing that it easily\nimposes itself as tributary of profound roots, of something that\ncertain products call as the basic renovation layer. (p. 58)\nHowever, the body's representation goes beyond the pure\nand simple possession of its parts, as they must be \"embel-\nlished,\" \"enhanced\" and \"accentuated.\" Once it is the main\nproperty, a kind of fundamental good of exchange, of this\n\"woman individual,\" it will have to be more. Like the exam-\nple that follows, it will have to be \"stretchy\" as well:\nThis fabric's elasticity is the latest thing by U.S. Top. It stretches\nwhere it needs to: in width. A fabric like this allows a perfect\nadjustment that values your body and your swing. As for your\nbody's stretchiness, you just have to do a little work out.\nThe body has to be \"elastic,\" \"stretched,\" with \"swing.\"\nThe many possibilities translated by images of the feminine\nbody appear as well in ads for a \"DeMillus\" campaign,\nthrough the women's expressions in photos and contents of\nthe following texts:\nFree the flower of your body. Your body is a flower. And flowers\nneed freedom to blossom. In light moves, appearance fitting to\nmoments, its lines must correspond to the situations. DeMillus\ngives the liberty you need, with soft, stretchy and caress full bras\nthat allow your body the freedom to show itself.\nFeel a touch to your body. The touches in your body should be\nthe right caresses in the right places. DeMillus has a nice touch\nfor you to always remember: soft, shapeable, comfortable, a\ndream of stretchiness. DeMillus has the prettiest touch to a\nwoman in this bra detailed with a Richelieu cut that will never\nlet you forget your charms.\nThe sweetest embrace you can be granted with. The embrace\nfrom DeMillus is full of emotion: warm, soft, stretchy, modeler,\nto be remembered forever. DeMillus understands a woman's\nneeds and transmits its quality in little sets like this, in striped\nLycra, that embraces a woman's body like it needs to be.\nThe representation of the woman's body expresses free-\ndom, because its nature is of a \"flower\" that wishes to \"blos-\nsom.\" Her body must be \"caressed,\" \"soft\" the way you like\nit. It must always \"remember\" the \"gentle touches,\" getting\n\"the right caresses in the right places.\" The body, modeled\nand bendy, is ready to receive the \"sweetest embrace\" that\nmust be \"full of emotion.\" Therefore, products \"understand a\nwoman's needs\" better than anyone else.\nThe body is marked as a central value of the woman's\nindividuality. Furthermore, it is in many ways fragmented,\nvariegated, detailed, and scrutinized. It is divided into parts,\nand some of them may be \"enhanced\" while others can be\n\"treated.\" The body must be \"stretchy,\" \"embraced,\"\n\"caressed,\" \"touched,\" and \"free.\" It is a flower, and also\npermanently in lack of something, needing to be \"cared,\"\n\"embellished,\" and \"accentuated.\" After all, the body, while\nproperty and basic element of the individual, must be used as\nthe main strength, power, and locus of the event of the wom-\nan's individuality.\nStill, the woman's image in advertising is more complex.\nIt must be submitted to the broader representation of the indi-\nvidual in our culture. And that is certainly experimented to\nsome extent by the body, but its main emphasis is toward\nsomething this body carries as essence, content, or substance.\nThe \"individual\" would articulate and result from the com-\npound of elements of body and spirit. But, generally, the sub-\nstance--described in our culture in terms like \"mind,\"\n\"soul,\" \"head,\" \"self,\" \"spirit,\" and so on--overcomes the\nmaterial dimension--the body--that sustains it. That is why,\nnot even in the magical world of advertisements, the femi-\nnine individuality may just be framed by the body.\nThe woman represented in ads has to be more. It is up to\nadvertising to balance and distinguish the dimensions of\n\"substance\" and \"body\" between genders. On one hand, the\n\"substance\" and its qualities usually prevail in the masculine\nidentity, and on the other hand, the \"body\" and its qualities\nprevail in the feminine identity. Nevertheless, as seen before,\nit is necessary to amass other values to make compatibles of\nboth components of \"individuality\" as a broad cultural repre-\nsentation. Thus, the woman in advertisements assumes con-\ntents apparently more \"spiritual\" in search to recover\ncoherence between terms. For example, in the next ad for\n\"Wella's Kolestral\" cream, under the title \"made up mind\nwoman,\" a text speaks of other values:\nIn charge, up to date and ready for life. Every day she\naccomplishes her own space in order to fulfill her fundamental\nrole in society. This is the woman today that always values her\nown charm. She never lets go of what she holds as most\nimportant: her femininity.\nFollowing this path of feminine \"spiritual\" values, it is\nperceptible the existence of some ideas that offer \"content\"\nto this \"individual.\" The woman must be as well other things\nthat are added to and dialogue with the body. She must be\nsometimes \"in charge,\" others \"up to date,\" almost always\n\"ready.\" Like an ad for \"Sanny,\" a clothing fabricant, teaches\nus, the product ought to propose \"new intimacy concepts\"\nand the \"intimate\" content, that will fill the inner space,\nexplains itself in the image of a woman with a provocative\nlook, half-open mouth, wearing only her underwear. Beneath\nthe title \"woman in very saucy version,\" the feminine indi-\nviduality acquires characteristics defined by a text that\nexplains: \"Sanny proposes new intimacy concepts. It is\nsomething that has much to do with the new, emancipated,\nand very sexy woman of our time.\"\nThe content of the body, therefore, is of \"a new, sexy,\nemancipated woman of our time.\" She must affirm, emphati-\ncally, her inner self, as the following ads state, \"I wear\nDropnyl because I am beautiful, modern, and intelligent\" or\n\"I wear Dropnyl because I love compliments.\" Besides\naffirming the self, an ad for \"Sulfabril\" shows other contents,\nbecause the represented woman must \"dare to use a Sulfabril\nfabric\" and \"stick to a promise until the end.\" The idea of\nindividual in feminine version present in ads is slightly\nemphasized and refers to a plan--erotic, beautiful, sensual--\nthat finds, again, in the body its only instance possible of\ntranslation.\nNonetheless, this \"individual\" needs to \"speak.\" And, it is\nfrom the \"substance\" or \"spirit\" that speech is made possible.\nAs the feminine individuality that advertising projects is,\nmostly, sustained by the \"body,\" words will have to be\nexpressed by another instance: the product. As seen in texts\nlike \"Find yourself in a DuLoren\" or \"Conquer your space by\nthe cloth you wear,\" the product assumes itself, decisively, as\nthe woman's speech: \"Elegance, class and lots of charm.\nAppel: the perfume that speaks for you.\" When reading the\nnext ads, it is curious to notice how \"she\" delegates her ideas\nand words to products that, at last, take charge of the \"inner\nwoman\" as representatives expressing desires, wants,\nthoughts, and emotions:\nLipmaker: a luminous idea in your lips. It is mainly with your\nlips that you show to have brilliant thoughts. That is why Max\nFactor created Lipmaker, a lipstick different from everything\nyou have ever seen. Put this word in your mouth: Lipmaker.\nMake your words last even when conversation is over. Max\nFactor Color Fast Long Lasting Lipstick. A lipstick that has a\nformula specifically created to stick more to your lips. With the\nnew Color Fast Lipstick from Max Factor you put a colorful and\nsparkling cream in your lips, that lasts as much as the impressive\nthings you say. With Color Fast Lipstick the conversation may\nstill end, but never the spark.\nThus, it is possible to realize how ads elaborate a version\nof the feminine identity attaching certain marks and signs to\nit. First, there is the previously discussed idea of \"individ-\nual,\" as it is a fundamental operation of advertising to trans-\nform the impersonality of production into the particularity of\nconsumption. The \"individual\" is emphasized as basis to the\nidentity, because consumption must be experimented as a\nvolunteer act, a kind of affirmation of the \"self,\" something\nin the sphere of private choices. The \"woman\" portrayed\nsupposes the presence of a consumer individual whose value\nis reproduced in ads in general. Therefore, the starting point\nis to construct the woman's representation as an \"individual\"\nthat has the desire for consumption as its core value.\nSecond, the woman's representation in advertisements\nhas its individuality specifically characterized in the idea that\nthis \"woman individual\" means primarily the ownership of a\n\"body.\" However, this \"body\" is not represented as a \"natu-\nral\" unit. It is divided into parts and manipulated to become\nmatter capable of being indefinitely fragmented, like a\nmosaic formed by pieces that, if isolated, do not outline a\npicture and, therefore, do not signify. This body, dissolved\ninto many fragments, is the main power of the \"woman indi-\nvidual\" that, through it and almost exclusively by using it,\nmakes herself bold, modern, seductive, in charge, and so on.\nThe feminine body, when broken into multiple pieces, makes\nsomewhat impossible the unified construction of a funda-\nmental dimension of individuality, that is, its \"substance\"--\n\"mind,\" \"spirit,\" and so on--so the individual can be\ncomplete. The representation of a fragmented \"body\" may\nindicate that an equally fragmented \"substance\" matches it.\nSo, individuality does not acquire consistency, and, the inner\nplan does not sustain itself.\nIn this sense, the \"woman individual,\" as shown in adver-\ntising, when existing mainly as a fragmented body, makes\nimpracticable the construction of an \"inner plan\" and, conse-\nquently, the realization of speech. The third mark fixed to the\nfeminine identity in ads is that of a silent woman that pos-\nsesses a body, and must know how to use it, although to this\nbody words are forbidden. As \"she\" does not own a \"sub-\nstance\" or, at least, has it in precarious form, her speech is\npushed to another instance. Hence, the \"woman\" in advertis-\ning assigns \"words\" to products that \"speak\" for her, reveal\nher \"ideas\" and express her inner self as \"needs\" and\n\"desires.\" Only they can understand her.\nCertainly, a broader study of the woman's image through-\nout advertising would include further dimensions not per-\nceived in this exercise. The analysis of other types of\nproducts--for children, cleaning, foods, or household appli-\nances--could tend to indicate, for example, the existence of\nthe woman's representation as \"housewife\" or \"mother.\"\nAdvertising studied as a production system of the imaginary\nof our culture raises complex questions, so, this article does\nnot presume to exhaust the subject. It is but an effort to debate\nthe problems of social identity from the thoughts of classifi-\ncation and value axes and through the investigation in ads.\nThis work showed some basic cuts of the feminine iden-\ntity as elaborated in advertising. From the analysis of a\n\"woman\" created by ads emerges the image of individuality\nwhere the \"body\"--and not the \"substance\"--is what mat-\nters. Also, advertising reveals that the feminine body suffers\na process through which unity is lost and parts prevail over\nwhole. The woman represented in ads exists, above all, in\npieces--breast, foot, leg, skin, face, nail, hand, buttock, eye,\nlip, lash, thigh, and whatever else may be detached--as an\ninverted puzzle with dislocated bits hiding the picture that is\nnever formed. Of course, this image of the body, and its\npieces, cannot sustain the individual as wholeness. Thus, the\nWestern individual, while believing in materiality and sub-\nstance, transforms itself in something twice as uneven. On\none hand, because individuality is seen as a relationship\nbetween body and spirit, matter and substance, and not as\nonly one of these terms and, on the other hand, because not\neven the body, which subsists in the feminine individuality,\nis integrated. So, like the individual in the woman's image\nfrom ads was undone by the absence of substance, also the\nmatter--the remaining term--is undone by the lack of unity\nbetween parts. And then, the \"woman\" represented in ads\nsilences, as speech is an expression of the \"spirit,\" proper of\nsingularity. What is left of the woman's image is a body, or,\npieces, rests, fragments of it that, without alternative, dele-\ngate words to products.\nTherefore, ads analyzed in this article suggest that the\nfemale body is divided, broken, shattered into multiple\nfragments, to serve for consumption purposes. A \"woman in\npieces\" appears as an ideological strategy to open new mar-\nket spaces for products and services that become holders of\nthese ever more specific territories of the body. In the 1980s,\nin the midst of the Brazilian redemocratization period, when\nnew political forces--including feminism--looked to give\nvoice to their demands and to reach for spaces, the woman's\nimage projected in advertising is silenced. The fights for\nfemale liberty that occur at the time are transformed into\nmere consumer desires. In fact, ads reveal a woman frag-\nmented into several parts that translate the idea of a perfect\nfemale body as the support for a wide variety of consumer\ngoods and, at the same time, this body becomes itself the\nvery object of consumption. Finally, the \"woman\" con-\nstructed by ads lets products assume their place as owners of\nchoices, desires and needs. They \"speak\" for her, and, cer-\ntainly, in advertising representations, the woman must keep\nherself in silence.\nNote\n1.
