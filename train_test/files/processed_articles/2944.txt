On average, some 25% of the balance sheet total of these firms was financed by\nintra-company loans in 2001 and for affiliates that are directly held by a foreign\ninvestor, cross-border intra-company loans account for 20% percent of balance sheet\ntotal. Tax rate differentials are frequently named as a possible explanation for this\nstrong role of intra-company loans in financing foreign subsidiaries in Germany. If the\ninterest on the loan is received in a low-tax country but is tax deductible in high-tax\nGermany, this financial instrument can produce a global tax saving for the\nmultinational. Since the saving decreases with the foreign country's tax rate, we should\nexpect that cross-border intra-company loans are used more extensively when the parent\nis located in a low-tax country. Based on a panel of 8,000 firms operating in Germany,\nwe provide only limited evidence that the home tax rate of the foreign parent is\nimportant for the amount of intra-company loans. Possibly, our analysis here suffers\nfrom lacking information on whether the foreign parent is in a loss position. In any case,\nthe failure to identify sizeable effects of the home country tax rate does not imply that\nforeign affiliates that operate in Germany do not use financial strategies to save taxes.\nOur empirical results show that subsidiaries that on average are profitable do react more\nstrongly to the German tax rate than other subsidiaries. This suggests that the size of the\nGerman tax rate does play a role for the leverage decision. Considering third-party debt\nin the hand of Germany-based affiliates our results show a significant effect of the\nGerman tax rate when we look at affiliates that are held via a German intermediate\ncompany but not when we look at directly held affiliates.\nLeverage decisions of foreign subsidiaries are certainly not exclusively steered by\ntax considerations, although these considerations do seem to play a role. Another\nimportant factor of cross-border intra-company loans is (low) profitability. The majority\nof cross-border intra-company loans are received by loss-making subsidiaries. In our\npanel analysis we find that for directly held foreign affiliates a reduction in profits by\n1% of the balance sheet is associated with an increase of cross-border loans by .3% of\nbalance sheet total.\nNicht technische Zusammenfassung\nDas Papier analysiert die Finanzierungsstruktur von ausl\u00e4ndischen\nDirektinvestitionen in Deutschland au\u00dferhalb des Finanzsektors. Im Jahr 2001 wurden\nbei diesen durchschnittlich 25 % der Bilanzsumme durch firmeninternes Fremdkapital\nfinanziert. F\u00fcr Unternehmen, die ohne deutsche Zwischengesellschaft direkt einem\nausl\u00e4ndischen Investor geh\u00f6ren, entfallen dabei auf grenz\u00fcberschreitende\nIntrafirmenkredite 20 % der Bilanzsumme. Oft werden Steuern als Erkl\u00e4rung f\u00fcr diesen\nhohen Umfang angef\u00fchrt. Unterliegen die Zinsen im Ausland einem niedrigen\nSteuersatz und sind sie als Schuldzinsen gegen einen hohen deutschern Steuersatz\nabsetzbar, resultiert insgesamt eine Steuerersparnis. Weil diese mit dem\nAuslandsteuersatz abnimmt, sollte man erwarten, dass die grenz\u00fcberschreitende\nFremdfinanzierung insbesondere dann anzutreffen ist, wenn die Mutter der deutschen\nTochter einen niedrigen Steuersatz hat. Anhand eines Panel-Datensatzes mit ca. 8.000\nAuslandst\u00f6chtern in Deutschland zeigt sich nur begrenzte Evidenz, dass der\nHeimatsteuersatz des ausl\u00e4ndischen Investors f\u00fcr den Umfang der konzerninternen\nFremdfinanzierung bedeutsam ist. Zum Teil k\u00f6nnte dies mit der fehlenden Information\n\u00fcber die Gewinn- bzw. Verlustsituation des ausl\u00e4ndischen Investors zu tun haben. Die\nbegrenzte Evidenz zum Einfluss des Auslandsteuersatzes sollte jedenfalls nicht\ndahingehend interpretiert werden, dass bei der konzerninternen Fremdfinanzierung\nSteuerw\u00e4gungen keine Rolle spielen. Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Unternehmen, die\nim Durchschnitt \u00fcber die Jahre profitabel sind, mit ihren Krediten st\u00e4rker auf\n\u00c4nderungen des deutschen K\u00f6rperschaftsteuersatzes reagieren als andere Unternehmen.\nDies legt nahe, dass der deutsche Steuersatz f\u00fcr die H\u00f6he der internen\nFremdfinanzierung eine wichtige Rolle spielt. Im Hinblick auf Fremdkapital von Dritten\nzeigt sich ein signifikanter Effekt der deutschen Steuer bei T\u00f6chtern, die \u00fcber eine\ndeutsche Zwischengesellschaft gehalten werden, nicht jedoch bei unmittelbaren\nAuslandst\u00f6chtern.\nDie Fremdfinanzierungsentscheidungen sind sicherlich nicht ausschlie\u00dflich von\nsteuerlichen Erw\u00e4gungen getrieben. Ein anderer wichtiger Einfluss ist die (geringe)\nProfitabilit\u00e4t. Der Gro\u00dfteil der grenz\u00fcberschreitenden Firmenkredite wird gehalten von\nUnternehmen, die Verluste machen. In unserer Paneldatenanalyse zeigt sich, dass eine\nVerringerung der Gewinne um ein Prozent der Bilanzsumme mit einer Erh\u00f6hung der\nIntrafirmenkredite um 0,3 Prozent der Bilanzsumme einhergeht.\nContents\n2 The tax preferences for intra-company loans 3\n3 Descriptive statistics 6\nLists of tables and figures\nTable 2 Determinants of cross-border intra-company loans 15\nTable 3 Determinants of third-party debt 19\nFigure 1 Main investors by country 7\nFigure 2 Diversity in financial ratios 10\nFigure 3 The distribution of DIFF 13\nTaxes and the financial structure of German inward FDI\n1 Introduction\nThere is widespread concern that multinational firms may evade a large portion of their\nstatutory tax burden by shifting income out of high-tax jurisdictions. While such a\nconcern is certainly not restricted to Germany, the high statutory rates of corporate tax\nin Germany \u00ad at least until the recent tax reform in 2001 \u00ad make it most likely that the\ncountry is particularly prone to this problem. Throughout the 1990s Germany had the\nhighest tax rate on retained corporate profits (including average local taxes) among\nOECD countries.\nIncome shifting may take the form of prices that depart from arms-length\nconditions and may imply excessive management and overhead fees, the setting of non-\nmarket interest rates within a group etc. Besides setting tax-efficient transfer prices on\nintra-firm trade, multinationals may also use the financial structure to minimise taxes\nand thereby allocate interest deductions to highly taxed affiliates for which this tax\nshield is most valuable. In this paper we want to explore to what extent the financial\nstructure of German inward foreign direct investment (FDI) is due to tax-saving\nbehaviour.1 During the 1990s the net German FDI inflow was financed to a large extent\nby intra-company debt incurred outside Germany. According to Deutsche Bundesbank\ncompany loans, and this strong role of intra-company loans in German inward FDI has\nled to the suspicion that these loans are indeed encouraged by high German tax rates\nGermany.

The second author thanks the German\nResearch Foundation (DFG) for financial support.\n1 For papers that provide evidence on tax motivated transfer pricing policies of multinationals see, for\nour knowledge this paper is the first attempt to look at this question using German firm-\nlevel data on inward FDI.\nOur study is based on the Bundesbank FDI statistics that cover all foreign direct\ninvestments, which meet mild size requirements. Unlike most studies on FDI with non-\nU.S. data, we can draw on micro data from 1989 \u00ad 2002 to study this question and a\nWhile there is a large number of studies on the tax effects on FDI, most are\nconcerned with the effect of local taxes on the overall FDI inflow of a region.3 There are\nonly a few studies on the financial structure. Notable exceptions are studies by Altshuler\nAltshuler and Grubert consider a cross sample of US subsidiaries abroad and analyse\nthe liability and asset side of these firms. The study shows an inverse relationship\nbetween the foreign tax rate and the amount of financial assets held abroad. On the\nliability side, a 1 percentage point increase in the foreign tax rate is associated with an\nincrease of roughly .4 percentage point in the debt to total asset ratio. The paper by Jog\nund Tang looks at US and Canadian firms. The authors show that the reduction in the\nCanadian corporate tax rate in the late 1980s triggered a reduction in the debt ratio of\nCanadian affiliates. Finally, Desai, Foley, and Hines find for a panel of US-owned\nforeign firms that a 1 percentage point increase in the foreign corporate tax rate leads to\nan increase in the external debt to asset ratio of roughly .25 percentage point and an\nincrease in internal borrowing of some .08 percentage point.\nIn section 2 we will briefly discuss the tax arbitrage possibilities of multinational\nfirms that consider alternative ways of financing their German investment. In Section 3\nthe Deutsche Bundesbank FDI database is used to present descriptive statistics of\nfinancial structures of German inward FDI.4 By identifying the home countries of\nforeign affiliates operating in Germany and employing the respective tax rate of the\nparent, we are able to proxy the global tax saving of a profitable firm that decides to\ndistribute a euro of equity to its parent and to replace this euro by an intra-company loan\n2 For reasons of data protection the data before 1996 have been anonymised, and the panel structure has\ntherefore been lost.\n3 For a detailed survey and meta study see Ederveen and de Mooij (2001).\n4 For a description of this database see Lipponer (2003).\ngranted by the parent. Section 4 develops the empirical model and presents the\neconometric results before section 5 concludes.\nOur empirical analysis of a huge panel of more than 8,000 firms provides\nevidence that supports the hypothesis that the financial structures of foreign affiliates in\nGermany are partly tax motivated. While we find that the corporate tax rate of the\nparent has only a very limited impact on the financial structure of a German subsidiary,\na significant effect of the German tax rate is visible. To identify this influence, we\nexploit the fact that unprofitable firms should be less affected by a change in the\nGerman corporate tax than profitable firms. Indeed, our results show that among\nGerman subsidiaries, which are directly held by a foreign investor, profitable firms react\nsignificantly different from non-profitable firms. When the German tax rate increases,\nprofitable firms significantly increase the amount of intra-company debt compared to\nunprofitable firms.\nBesides tax incentives, our study identifies (low) profitability as a major factor\nthat explains the diversity of intra-company loans. Roughly 60% of the cross-border\nintra-company debt turns out to be held by firms that are running losses and profitability\nturns out to be highly significant in our panel regressions of intra-company loans.\n2 The tax preferences for intra-company loans\nFrom a tax perspective, the incentives for a foreign parent to grant an interest bearing\nloan to a profitable German subsidiary will depend on the German tax rate at which the\ninterest is deductible, on the one hand, and the tax rate at which the interest is taxable in\nthe home country of the parent, on the other hand.\nTo be more specific, consider the option of a German affiliate to use its profit to\npay back an intra-company loan granted by the parent. Let \n\nr\n, \n\nd\n, \n\ni\nbe the effective\ncorporate tax rates on German retained earnings and on earnings that are distributed\nfrom the German subsidiary to the foreign parent and the rate at which the German\naffiliate can deduct interest paid to the parent. The latter rate may fall short of the rate\non retained earnings since in Germany only half of the interest on medium and long-\nterm debt is deductible from the local trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). The rate \n\nd\nis an\neffective rate that is influenced by the German corporate tax on distributed profits, by\nthe German withholding tax on dividends and by additional taxes in the home country\nof the parent if this country does not exempt foreign dividends.\nIf the German affiliate pays back a loan of 1 today, the parent is able to distribute\nthis 1 as a dividend to its own shareholders. This however, comes at a cost. To pay\nback a loan of 1, the German affiliate needs a pre-tax income of ( )\n\n\n-\nr\n1 euro. Since\nthis sum is not available for profit distribution, the parent forgoes ( ) ( )\n\n \n-\n\n-\nr\nd\nin dividends. Hence, the total change in dividends that the parent can pay today (before\npersonal taxes of the shareholder of the parent) is given as\n( )\n( )\n\n\n\n-\n\n-\n-\n\nr\nd\na\nThere is, however, an additional effect on future dividends. Since the debt service\nof the affiliate drops by the tax deductible interest rate on the retired loan, dividends\nmay rise by ( )\n\n\n-\ni\ni 1 in all future periods, where i is the nominal interest rate. Since\nthese dividends are taxed at the rate for distributed profits rather than at the rate on\nretained earnings, the parent receives a stream of dividends of\n( ) ( ) ( )\n\n\n \n-\n\n-\n\n\n-\nr\nd\ni\n1 , the cash value of which is\n( ) ( )\n( ) ( )\nm\ni\ni\nb\nr\nd\ni\n-\n\n\n-\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nwhere ( )\nm\ni -\n1 is the discount rate applied by a shareholder of the parent.\nA third effect that has to be taken into account is that the parent in all future\nperiods lacks the interest income on the retired euro. Denoting the parent firm's tax rate\nat which the interest is taxable by , the cash value of this effect amounts to\n( )\n( )\nm\ni\ni\nc\n-\n\n-\n\nObviously, assuming constant tax rates and abstracting from taxes on capital\ngains, the profitability of the intra-company loan depends on the sign of ( )\nc\nb\na -\n+ . If\nthis sign is negative, intra-company loans dominate equity in the form of retained\nearnings as a source of finance for the German affiliate. One problem in international\nstudies such as ours is that one can only speculate about the applicable tax rate m of the\nfinal investor. We follow a standard assumption in the literature on the international cost\nof capital (OECD 1991) and assume that the final investor is tax exempt (m = 0).\nConsequently,\n( ) ( ) ( ) \n-\n\n-\n\n\n-\n=\n-\n+\n-\n= \n\n\nr\ni\nd\nc\nb\na\nis an indicator of the tax dominance of intra-company loans over retained earnings of\nthe German affiliate. It should be noted that DIFF is also the relevant indicator for the\ntax advantage of reducing the third-party debt of the German affiliate by 1 and\nincreasing the third-party debt of the foreign parent by 1. In this case the capital market\ncan be thought of as financing a back-to-back transaction with the affiliate and the\nparent. Moreoover, things are very similar if the corporation is considering a new equity\ninjection by the parent or, alternatively, an intra-company loan to finance the subsidiary.\nAgain, it can be shown that the relationship between the German and the foreign tax\nrates is crucial.5\nThe above arbitrage argument assumed that the parent and the German affiliate are\nprofitable and do pay taxes. For German firms that are unprofitable, however, the right\nto deduct interest from the high taxed German tax base tends to be less valuable. At\nbest, such a firm may be able to use a loss carry-backward or a loss carry-forward to\ndecrease taxable income in other fiscal years. In the case of a loss carry-forward this\ncomes at a cost as the loss carry forward is not interest bearing. The effective rate at\nwhich interest is deductible reduces. Conversely, if the parent firm, which receives the\ninterest income, is running losses, then the effective tax rate may be lower than the\nstatutory tax rate . Unfortunately, we do not know about the tax status of the parent so\nwe cannot exploit such a difference in effective rates.\nFrom the above argument we have that the profit or loss position of the German\naffiliate changes the influence of the Germany tax rate since it may reduce the value of\nthe interest deduction, but, given the profit or loss position of the parent, it does not\n5 For an extensive discussion of the tax-induced financial preferences of multinational firms see Alworth\nchange the effective tax rate at which interest income of the parent is taxed. This\nsuggests to split up the variable DIFF into a German part and a foreign part when the\nprofit or loss position of the German subsidiaries is considered in the empirical\nimplementation. Firms that do pay taxes are expected to react more strongly to a\nGerman tax rate change than firms that are in a loss position.\n3 Descriptive statistics\nDespite its recently sluggish growth rates, Germany is still one of the main recipients of\ninward FDI. For end-2000 the OECD FDI statistics record an inward stock of FDI of\n479 billion for the UK. The present section gives information on the overall financing\npatterns of the German FDI stock and additional stylised facts. We will concentrate on\nnon-financial firms (excluding banks, pure holding companies, and insurance\ncompanies) that are separately incorporated in Germany (dropping branches), and we\nwill exclude investment in the government and not-for-profit sectors.\nIn its yearly survey of the stock of German inbound FDI, the Bundesbank collects\ndata on the liability side of the balance sheets such as paid-up capital, capital reserves,\nprofits and losses carried forward, and debt, including loans received from affiliated\nfirms inside and outside Germany. The prime purpose of the data collection is to give a\npicture of the cross-border ownership of firms and the stocks of FDI in Germany. A\nsomewhat unusual feature of the balance sheets collected by the Bundesbank is that they\ncontain the yearly profit after taxes but before dividend distributions as a separate part\nof the equity of the firm. Therefore the balance sheets provide information on current\nprofits despite the fact that there is no explicit profit and loss statement. On the asset\nside, data are available on fixed assets and intangibles, financial assets and working\ncapital.\nFor each firm in the sample we can identify the foreign country of the investor,\nwhich may not be the ultimate investor but a foreign holding or intermediate company,\nand the share that this investor has in the German affiliate. An important distinction in\nthe German data is the one between directly and indirectly held inward FDI. An indirect\nparticipation applies if the German affiliate is held by a German company that, in turn,\nis owned by a foreign investor. A direct participation is defined as one where the\nGerman affiliate is directly owned by a foreign investor.\nFigure 1. Main investors by country\na) Directly held affiliates b) Indirectly held affiliates\nAnnotation: Investor countries by relative contribution to balance sheet total of directly and indirectly\nheld foreign affiliates in Germany. United States (US), Netherlands (NL), Japan (JP), Switzerland (CH),\nFrance (FR), United Kingdom (UK), Italy (IT), Austria (OE), Denmark (DK), Spain (ES).\nSource: Deutsche Bundesbank database. Subsample of non-financial firms.\nAs has been found for US data, most of the FDI is wholly-owned. In 2002, for\nexample, almost 70% of the directly held subsidiaries had only one foreign investor.\nFigure 1 shows how the total assets of the affiliates can be attributed to investors from\ndifferent countries. Allthough the investors of German inbound FDI are rather unevenly\nspread out across investing countries, there remains a rather large number of\ninvestments coming from smaller countries. Figure 1 shows a dominance of US\ninvestors, which has seemingly declined during the 1990s. This may be partly due,\nhowever, to the increased use of (often Dutch) intermediate holdings (cf. also Desai,\nTable 1. Descriptive statistics, aggregated sample (2001)\nDirect Indirect\nBalance sheet item Total\n( billion)\nFraction of\nbalance sheet\nTotal\n( billion)\nFraction of\nbalance sheet\nLiabilities to affiliated\ncompanies\nLet us now turn to the financial structure. Table 1 gives the crude picture. In 2001\nthe balance sheet total of directly held firms amounted to 179 billion.6 About 11% of\nthis was financed by paid-up capital and some 23% consisted of retained earnings from\nprevious periods (capital and surplus reserves). On aggregate, loss carry-forwards\namounted to roughly 6%. Debt and other liabilities made up for roughly 73% of the\naggregated balance sheets. The financing pattern changes when we turn to indirectly\nheld firms, i.e. corporations that are not directly held by a foreign company but held via\nan intermediate company located within Germany. The two types of firms differ with\nrespect to the capital reserves, the loss carry-forwards and the liabilities to affiliated\ncompanies. While overall debt makes up for roughly 53% of the balance sheets in both\ncases, indirectly held firms tend to owe more to affiliated companies. Moreover, the\nstructure of these liabilities differs between the two types of firms. Indirectly held firms\ntend to owe most of this (25% of the balance sheet) to affiliate companies within\nGermany and directly held firms owe most of it (20%) to affiliated firms outside\nGermany. This reflects the fact that indirectly held firms are owned by German\nintermediate companies that can act as financial clearing institutions for their\nsubsidiaries. Conversely, directly held subsidiaries are held by a foreign firm or foreign\nholding company and are less likely to face an affiliated company in Germany. By\ninternational standards, the amount of cross-country intra-company debt looks large. For\ncomparison, Desai, Foley, and Hines (2003a) report that US-owned foreign affiliates, on\na worldwide average, finance 8% of their total assets by borrowing from their US\nparent. Similarly, Altshuler and Grubert (2003) report for a sample of 5,981 US-owned\nnon-financial subsidiaries that loans from stockholders amounted to roughly 10% of\ntotal assets in 1996. German non-financial FDI abroad is also financed by intra-\ncompany loans to a much lesser extent. In 2001 the liabilities of those firms to German\naffiliates (including their German parent) amounted to some 8.7% of the balance sheet\ntotal and the liabilities to non-German affiliates were 8.3%.\nThe summary statistics of Table 1 do not, of course, reflect the possibly large\nheterogeneity in the data across firms and across investor countries. Therefore, Figure 2\ngives some information on firm heterogeneity. Each of the 12 graphs (6 for direct and 6\nfor indirect participations) contains 5 lines. The bold line represents the respective\nfinancing ratio of the median firm, i.e. 50% of the firms have a lower financing ratio.\nThe other curves represent the financing ratios for the 5%, 25%, 75% and 95% centile\nfirms.\nSeveral features are remarkable. As shown in the first graph of Figure 2, after the\nyear 1996 more than 5% of the firms had paid-up capital that amounted to more than\n100% of total assets. Technically, this is possible if there are negative items on the\nliability side of the balance sheet such as loss carry-forwards or current losses.\n6 Due to an increase in the thresholds for the reporting requirement, the year 2001 is somewhat more\nrepresentative for our data than the year 2002.\nFigure 2.

The\ntwo lines below the median line characterise the financial ratio of the 5th and 25th centile firms, the two\nlines above the median ratio indicate the 75th and 95th centiles. Each of the left hand diagrams refers to\nthe subsample of firms that are directly held by a foreign firm, while the graphs on the right hand refer to\nfirms in Germany that are foreign held via a German company.\nIndeed, from 1993 onwards, directly held affiliates experienced growing loss\ncarry-forwards. The value of a firm that represents the fifth centile in terms of this\nbalance sheet total at the end of the period, implying negative equity. For 5% of the\nindirectly held firms loss carry-forwards still exceeded 44% of the balance sheet. From\n1993, extreme outliers are present also when we consider current net-of-tax profits of\ndirectly and indirectly held firms. In 1995, 5% of the directly held affiliates had a\ncurrent loss that exceeded 21% of their balance sheet and, by the year 2002, 5% of the\nfirms had a yearly loss that amounted to at least 44% of their balance sheet total. In the\ncase of indirectly held affiliates, losses for the fifth centile reached 10% of the balance\nare running huge losses in consecutive years. While the huge number of unprofitable\noperations is surprising, it is also remarkable that a large number of firms report exactly\nzero net-of-tax profits and this holds true for the median directly and indirectly held\nTurning to total debt, in recent years 5% of the directly held affiliates have had a\nshare of debt in balance sheet total that exceeded unity. As with paid-up capital, this is\npossible in the case of negative current profits and/or negative profit carry-forwards.\nFinally, for at least 5% of the directly held subsidiaries liabilities to affiliated firms\noutside Germany account for more than 100% of the balance sheet total after 1995. For\nthe fifth centile, the fraction is growing and was 1.24 in 2002. Interestingly, the\ndevelopment of the internal debt in this centile closely corresponds to the development\nof losses for the fifth centile. Quite obviously, for some firms current losses are covered\nby intra-company loans instead of new equity.\nTo sum up the above description, in the second half of the 1990s the financial\nstructure of a sizeable fraction of the inward FDI projects in Germany was strongly\ninfluenced by large losses and this holds particularly for directly held firms. In many\ncases losses were accumulating over time and to some extent intra-company loans were\nused to finance these losses. While corporate losses seem to play a huge role in\nexplaining the financial structures of some firms, the next sections will analyse what\nrole is left for tax differences between Germany and the home country of the investor.\nBefore we will do so, however, we will briefly introduce our tax rate data.\nFigure 3 gives an impression of the distribution of DIFF, as defined in section 2,\nfor the full sample of all directly and indirectly held affiliates in our data set with all\nyears pooled.7 The data set contains tax information from up to 69 countries and digests\ninformation on the foreign corporate taxes including average local taxes, the German\nwithholding tax on dividends and the German corporate tax (including average local\ntaxes) against which firms can deduct interest expenses.8 In cases, in which a German\nfirm is owned by several investors from foreign countries, we use average values of\n7 In those cases where the affiliate is owned by foreign investors from more than one country we calculate\nDIFF as a weighted average of the individual country values (weights taken from the ownership of\nshares).\n8 In selected cases, we decided to depart from headline corporate taxes in investor countries due to special\nregimes. For example, a huge fraction of German subsidiaries is held via Dutch holdings. Since 1997,\nthese holding can allocate 80 per cent of their interest income to special provisions, which in effect\nexempts 80 per cent of the income. Therefore we adjusted the Dutch tax rate accordingly.\nDIFF, with the fractions of the ownership stakes taken as weights. Rather than showing\nthe histogram itself, Figure 3 gives a Kernel density estimate, which makes it somewhat\neasier to compare the distribution with a normal distribution. For a very large share of\nthe observations DIFF is positive implying that for tax reasons it pays for a profitable\nmultinational to substitute intra-company debt for equity (i.e. to distribute retained\nearnings). But owing to the German split rate system of the corporate tax with its\nsmaller rate on distributed profits and the limited tax deductibility of interest against the\nlocal taxes for some countries during the 1990s, DIFF was (partly) negative. Italy and\nJapan are examples. When we look at the time variation in the tax rate data, 62 per cent\nof the home countries in our sample did experience corporate tax rate changes during\nthe period 1996-2002 and the average standard deviation of the national corporate tax\nrate is some two percentage points.\nFigure 3. The distribution of DIFF\n4 Empirical Evidence\nThe role of taxes on the financial structure has been widely analysed in empirical\nstudies, but most studies are concerned with national firms and national tax systems.9\nWhile the older literature has generally failed to find significant effects on corporate\nfinancing, recent studies of national firms have been more successful in identifying tax\neffects. MacKie\u00adMason (1990) looks at the marginal source of finance as a function of\nthe corporate tax rate by looking at the loss carry-forward position of firms. For firms\nwith high loss carry-forwards the tax deductibility of interest has a lower value than for\nprofitable firms. MacKie\u00adMason shows for a sample of US corporations that firms with\nhigh loss carry-forwards indeed use less debt at the margin. Givoly et al (1992) use a\nsimilar method and use the natural experiment of the US 1986 tax reform act. Gentry\n(1994) compares US firms that operate in special industries and can avoid the double\ntaxation under the US corporate tax system with other firms that are subject to double\ntaxation of corporate profits. Indeed the first group of corporations shows a significantly\ndifferent financing behaviour. Graham (1999) argues that empirically the tax rate of the\npersonal investor plays a role in corporate financing decisions. Gordon and Lee (1999)\nexploit the fact that in the US smaller corporations are granted a lower corporate tax rate\nand find a significant effect of this lower rate. Finally, Gropp (2002) shows a sizeable\ntax effect on the financing of marginal corporate investment by exploiting local tax\ndifferentials for German firms.\nSo far, there is rather limited evidence on the empirical effects of international\ntaxation on the financing of multinationals. Three notable exceptions have been\ndescribed in the introduction, and all of them identify effects for US-owned subsidiaries.\nIn this study we want to address the question of how tax rate differences between\nthe home country of an investor and Germany influence the financial structure of\nGerman inward FDI. Therefore, the endogenous variable that is of foremost interest to\nus is the amount of intra-company loans granted to a German affiliate by its foreign\ninvestor divided by the balance sheet total (LIABOUTGER). As we cannot exactly\ndistinguish from which country a loan is granted we employ the working hypothesis that\n9 There is a huge theoretical literature on the determinants of the financial structure of corporations. A\nuseful survey of this literature is given in Harris and Raviv (1991).\nall debt from non-German affiliated companies comes from the parent and the\napplicable tax rates for this country are taken into account.\nTable 2.

Standard\nerrors are corrected for clustering across country observations and for heteroscedasticity. A full set of\ntime dummies has been used; coefficient estimates are not reported. We eliminated outliers by excluding\nobservations for which the exogenous variables PROFITABILITY, COLLATERAL and SIZE were\neither in their two lowest or in their two highest percentiles. We also excluded firms that on average\nacross all observations had a debt to asset ratio of unity or larger. To be included observations had to be\nconsecutive for at least three years. Total assets are used on both sides of the equation in the denominators\nof LIABOUTGER, COLLATERAL and PROFITABILITY. Since this poses potential endogeneity\nproblems, we also used instrumental variables approaches (using a GMM model) but the test statistics\nalways rejected the validity of the available instruments. Therefore the GMM results are not reported.\nTable 2 summarises our findings for the liabilities to non-German affiliated\ncompanies (cross-border intra-company loans). Since the Breusch-Pagan and the\nHausman tests reject the use of random-effects models, we report only the results for\nfixed-effects models. Because of the quite different importance of cross-border intra-\ncompany loans for directly and indirectly held affiliates we analyse them in separate\nsubsamples. Columns (1) and (2) report the results for a model in which the variable\nDIFF summarizes the tax incentives to borrow from the parent. From section 2, we\nshould expect that DIFF is positively correlated with the amount in intra-company\nloans. The model behind columns (3) and (4) splits up the effects of the foreign tax rate\nand the German tax rate. A larger foreign tax rate should lead to heavier taxation of\ninterest paid by the affiliate and should make cross-border loans less attractive. We\ntherefore expect a negative coefficient. Conversely, the higher the German rate, the\nhigher is the value of interest deductions and the more cross-border loans should be\nexpected. The problem here is that the German statutory tax rate is the same for all\nfirms in our sample. In a model with fixed time effects the respective coefficient\ntherefore cannot be identified. To overcome this problem we split our sample into a\nsubsample of firms that on average show a positive profitability and into a second\nsubsample of firms that have zero or negative average profitability across observations.\nA dummy PROFIT takes on the value one for a firm in the first subsample and the value\nzero, otherwise.10 The variable GERTAX is the product of this dummy and the German\ncorporate tax rate as it is relevant for interest deductions. As has been argued in section\n2, profitable (i.e. taxable) firms can be expected to react more strongly with their\nleverage decision upon a German tax rate change. Therefore we expect a positive\ncoefficient of the variable GERTAX, which also has a sizeable variation over the years\nsince the German tax rate relevant for interest deductions has come down from 59.65%\nColumns (1) and (2) use the variable DIFF, columns (3) and (4) use CT and\nGERTAX. The tax variable DIFF is found to be non-significant for directly held firms\nin column (1). This result changes if we look at indirectly held firms in column (2).\nHere the coefficient is significant, but is still economically small. It suggests a .2\npercentage point increase in the ratio of cross-border loans to total assets if the home\ncountry rate increases by 10 percentage points.\nA possible reason for this weak correlation is that a large percentage of the firms\nin our sample have negative profits in consecutive years. The models in columns (3) and\n(4) report the results for variables CT and GERTAX and try to overcome this problem.\nWe find that the influence of the parent's home tax rate, CT, is still insignificant for\ndirectly and indirectly held affiliates. Turning to the coefficient GERTAX we find a\nsignificant and sizeable effect for directly held firms that receive the major part of cross-\nborder intra-company loans. The coefficient implies that an increase of the German tax\nrate of 10 percentage points increases the fraction of cross-border loans to balance sheet\n10 For 68 per cent (42 per cent) of the directly (indirectly) held firms in the sample of Table 2, PROFIT\ntakes on the value one.\ntotal by some 1.37 percentages points relative to the control group that on average\nshows non-positive profitability. Surprisingly, we get a negative sign of GERTAX when\nanalyzing the indirectly held affiliates in column (4), which from the descriptive\nstatistics in section 3 receive much less cross-border loans. While it is statistically\nsignificant, the coefficient for these firms is very small in economic terms.\nDrawing on the empirical model of Rajan and Zingales (1995), we add several\nother variables that may play a role for the financial structure. A large ratio of fixed\nassets to total assets can be interpreted as a sign for good collateral. This may reduce the\nagency cost of borrowing and may increase firm value in the event of illiquidity of the\nfirm. This in turn should increase the availability of third-party debt and may reduce the\nneed for loans by the parent. This leads us to introduce the ratio of fixed assets and\nintangibles to total assets as the explanatory variable COLLATERAL.11\nCOLLATERAL has a significantly negative coefficient for all but one subsample\n(profitable indirectly owned affiliates). This is in line with a substitution theory between\nintra-company debt and third-party debt and the hypothesis that collateral increases the\naccess to third-party debt.\nAccess to third-party debt may also vary with firm size. If larger corporations are\nmore diversified than smaller ones, the former may have a smaller default risk and\nbetter access to outside debt (reducing the need for intra-company debt). But, of course,\nlarger corporations may simply be better equipped with equity and may need less third-\nparty debt as well as less intra-company loans. In any case, size may matter, and we\ntherefore introduce the right-hand variable SIZE, defined as the log of total assets\n(balance sheet total). The coefficient for size turns out to be insignificant for the sample\nof indirectly held firms but significantly positive for the directly held affiliates, which\nmay reflect that large, mature firms have a better equity base.\nWhile the significance of the variable GERTAX is evidence that tax\nconsiderations do matter for the size of cross-border intra-company loans, this may not\nbe the full story. Indeed, only some 55% of the German affiliates are financed by cross-\nborder intra-company loans. As we have seen from the descriptive statistics, a sizeable\nfraction of the foreign subsidiaries in Germany run huge losses and intra-company loans\nseemed to be an important instrument to keep those firms alive. In total, 60% of all\ncross-border intra-company loans are granted to affiliates that are in a loss position and\ntherefore have a limited benefit from interest deductibility. This alone suggests a strong\nrole of cross-border loans in covering losses. Another piece of evidence for the role of\nlosses is the coefficient of the variable PROFITABILITY in Table 2, which is defined\nas the ratio of current profits net of taxes to total assets. We find a significant negative\nand sizeable correlation between PROFITABILITY and cross-border intra-company\nloans for directly held firms. The marginal effects reported in Table 2 indicate that a\nreduction in profits of 1% of the balance sheet total leads to additional cross-border\nloans of .3% of the balance sheet total. While PROFITABILITY is also significant in\nexplaining the intra-company loans for indirectly held firms, the estimated coefficients\nare much smaller. This reflects the fact that for indirectly held firms a German\nintermediate company is available to provide short-term finance and cross-border loans\nare largely redundant.\nAs mentioned in section 2, a close substitute to an intra-company loan is to\nincrease third party debt of the high-tax affiliate in Germany and to reduce third party\ndebt of the parent firm.12 For parent firms in low-tax jurisdictions (high DIFF) debt is\nless advantageous from a tax saving perspective and parents may use less leverage. This\nin turn allows them to increase the leverage in high tax affiliates (like German ones)\nwithout unduly increasing the multinational's overall leverage. Unfortunately, we are\nnot in a position to use the balance sheets of parent firms to find additional evidence for\nsuch countervailing effects abroad. But as pointed out in section 3, the tax preferences\nfor such a transaction should again be influenced by our variable DIFF and the tax\nattractiveness of third-party for financing German subsidiaries should be influenced by\nthis variable. We therefore re-ran the regressions presented in table 2, but using third-\nparty debt to balance sheet total as the endogenous variable (Table 3).\nFor the directly held affiliates (column (1)) DIFF has the expected sign and is\nsignificant, although the estimated coefficient is small. For indirectly held firms\n(column (2)) the coefficient turns out to be insignificant. If we instead use the variables\n11 Unfortunately, the Bundesbank data pool fixed assets and intangibles and fixed assets cannot be\nidentified separately.\n12 For a discussion of similar financing strategies see Altshuler and Grubert (2003).\nCT and GERTAX, these results turn around: now the variable GERTAX has the\nexpected and significant sign for indirectly held affiliates but is insignificant for directly\nheld firms. The home country tax rate CT is insignificant in both cases. Together this\nprovides only limited evidence that tax rates play a major role in the decision to raise\noutside debt.\nPROFITABILITY again turns out to have a highly significant influence. The\nvariable SIZE is positively correlated with third-party debt, which suggests that larger\nfirms have better access to third party debt. COLLATERAL is significant and positively\ncorrelated with third-party debt in the case of directly held firms but is insignificant for\nindirectly held affiliates.\nTable 3.

To be included observations had to be\nconsecutive for at least three years.\n5 Discussion\nThe paper has analysed the financial structure of German inbound FDI in the non-\nfinancial sector. On average, some 25% of the balance sheet total of these firms was\nfinanced by intra-company loans in 2001 and for affiliates that are directly held by a\nforeign investor, cross-border intra-company loans account for 20% percent of balance\nsheet total. Tax rate differentials are frequently named as a possible explanation for this\nstrong role of intra-company loans in financing foreign subsidiaries in Germany. If the\ninterest on the loan is received in a low-tax country but is tax deductible in high-tax\nGermany, this financial instrument can produce a global tax saving for the\nmultinational, the amount of which decreases in the foreign country's tax rate. Therefore\nwe should expect that cross-border intra-company loans are used more extensively\nwhen the parent is located in a low-tax country. Based on a panel of 8,000 firms\noperating in Germany, we could provide only limited evidence that the home tax rate of\nthe foreign parent is important for the amount of intra-company loans. Possibly, our\nanalysis here suffers from lacking information on whether the foreign parent is in a loss\nposition. In any case, the failure to identify sizeable effects of the home country tax rate\ndoes not imply that foreign affiliates that operate in Germany do not use financial\nstrategies to save taxes. Our empirical results have shown that subsidiaries that on\naverage are profitable do react more strongly to the German tax rate than other\nsubsidiaries. This strongly suggests that the size of the German tax rate does play a role\nfor the leverage decision. Considering third-party debt in the hand of Germany-based\naffiliates our results show a significant effect of the German tax rate when we look at\nindirectly held affiliates but not when we look at directly held affiliates.\nLeverage decisions of foreign subsidiaries are certainly not exclusively steered by\ntax considerations, although these considerations do seem to play a role. Another\nimportant factor of cross-border intra-company loans is (low) profitability. The majority\nof cross-border intra-company loans are received by loss-making subsidiaries. In our\npanel analysis we find that for directly held foreign affiliates a reduction in profits by\n1% of the balance sheet is associated with an increase of cross-border loans by .3% of\nbalance sheet total. Profitability, besides the different use of cross-border intra-company\nloans, is another area where directly and indirectly held firms differ starkly. Foreign-\nowned firms that are held via a German intermediate company show a much lower\nvariation in profitability than do directly held affiliates and a majority of the indirectly\nheld firms shows virtually zero profitability. Further analysis of these differences may\npotentially lead to additional insights into the tax avoidance strategies of multinational\nfirms but are left for future research.\n6 References\nAlworth, J. 1988.
