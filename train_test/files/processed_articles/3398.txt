    "abstract": "Abstract\nThere is a friendly conflict between field broadcast journalists and broadcast journalism instructors. The conflict centers on\nthe development of best instructional practices for the student journalists. This qualitative study is an attempt to bridge the\ngap between field journalists and journalism instructors. To accomplish this goal, first, a review of the academic literature\nwas conducted to establish a research base. Then, interviews were conducted with field broadcast journalists (n = 4) to\nanswer the following guiding research question: According to field broadcast journalists, what knowledge, skills, and training\nare required when transitioning from MC student into professional broadcast journalist? This study presents the findings of\nthese interviews. Areas of focus are technology, internships, and student motivation. The study concludes with a discussion\nof academic advisory groups. However, the ultimate goal of the study is to get the two groups talking rather than scowling\nat each other from across the news desk.\n",

Today's broadcast journalist must be an equally\nstrong writer, videographer, editor, and on-air talent (Hu,\napproach to broadcast journalism is a new phenomenon. Ten\nyears ago, a journalist was expected to specialize. For exam-\nple, a journalist generally would work as an on-air reporter or\na cameraperson, but seldom would one professional take on\nboth duties. Today, shrinking budgets and new technology\nhave forced reporters to become camera operators and cam-\nera operators to become reporters. The reality of modern\njournalism is, to be employable; one must be a master of all\nbroadcast crafts.\nThe training of future journalists is, in part, the responsi-\nbility of the journalism instructor (JI). In the current era of\nbroadcast production, post-secondary Mass Communication\n(MC) Departments face a new challenge. Wyss (2009) wrote,\n\". . . besides the lessons of who, what, when, where, why and\nhow are others in interactivity, multimedia, blogs, Twitter,\nFacebook, and wikis\" (p. 26). Wyss's statement addresses\nthe need for JIs to train students using the latest technology\nin a quickly changing broadcast profession.\nWyss's (2009) comments illustrate an issue MC depart-\nments across the United States must understand. That prob-\nlem is developing a modern, affordable, and comprehensive\nbroadcast journalism curriculum. Modern journalists must\nunderstand how to produce news in a society where enter-\ntainment is increasingly valued over information, where\nsocial media is as important as traditional media, and where\njournalism teams have been replaced with the one-person-\nand challenges to traditional journalism instruction continues\nto increase, MC departments at the post-secondary level are\n1The University of Texas\u00adRio Grande Valley, USA\n2Texas A&M University\u00adKingsville, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nNick Taylor, The University of Texas\u00adRio Grande Valley, ARHU, 1201 W.\nEmail: nick.taylor@utrgv.edu\nThe Search for Innovative Ideas: How\nto Save Today's Mass Communication\nDepartment\nNick Taylor1 and Gerri Maxwell2\n Keywords\nbroadcast journalism education/profession knowledge gap, broadcast journalism, mass communication department, changes\nin higher education, changes in journalism education\n2 SAGE Open\nfaced with a daunting task. That task and the problem this\narticle will address is developing a broadcast journalism cur-\nriculum that reflects changes at the professional level.\nStatement of purpose. The purpose of this article is to report\nthe specific technologies and skills field broadcast journal-\nists (FBJ) claim to be critical additions/updates to a post-\nsecondary MC department's curriculum. The suggested\ncurricular updates reflect ideal best instructional practices to\nprepare students for the transition from student into a profes-\nsional broadcast journalist. Issues raised and suggestions\nprovided are developed from current broadcast literature, site\nvisits to news stations/production houses, and discussions\nwith practicing journalists. This article has three areas of\nfocus: (a) technology, (b) hands-on learning and internships,\nand (c) student motivation. While one article cannot serve to\nupdate an entire curriculum, this study can be viewed as an\nopportunity to begin the conversation between FBJs and\npost-secondary MC departments.\nConceptual framework. This study builds on the academic lit-\nerature calling to revolutionize and revitalize broadcast jour-\nnalism departments. Articles by Curry (2010), Mensing\nism departments through teaching, technology, and out-of-\nclassmentoring,totrainstudentstobecomecommunity-based\njournalists with a global understanding. That is to say, stu-\ndents need to understand the importance of reporting local\nnews, but they must understand how that local news relates\nto and is part of global events.\nTo illustrate the global nature of community-based sto-\nries, Hu (2012) declared that broadcasting is the beginning of\na news story's lifecycle. Webcasting and social media, in\nother words, can continually rebroadcast the story and add\nrelevant information, making a community-based story glob-\nally relevant. An example of this is the tragic death of an\nIranian protester named Neda Agha-Soltan. On June 20,\n2009, Iranian police shot and killed Agha-Soltan as she\npeacefully protested in Tehran, Iran (Fathi, 2009). Neda's\ntragic death was captured on cell phones, transmitted through\nsocial media, and eventually reported in traditional mass\nmedia outlets.\nOnce broadcast through traditional mass media, the story\ntook on a new life. Rest in peace (RIP) Neda videos appeared\non YouTube and social media sites dedicated to her regis-\ntered followers from around the world. Furthermore, to the\ndismay of many, webcasts of the shooting were shared/\nrebroadcast from website to website. While Neda's example\nof a community event going global is tragic, it is not unique.\nToday, all journalism is a global story.\nStatement of problem. There is a problem facing post-secondary\nMC departments. That problem, specifically, post-secondary\nMC departments across the United States are unsure of the\nbest teaching strategies and technologies required to prepare\npost-secondary students to compete for employment in the\n2012). An FBJ interviewed for this article suggested, \"So\nyou got to be ready to go and know your job, as well as to\nknow others in this fields, because you never know what\nsituation you are going into\" (Respondent 1, personal com-\nout the literature and also through the comments of other\nFBJs interviewed for this article.\nSignificance of study.A study, such as this one, is necessary\nbecause few broadcast journalism departments routinely dis-\ncuss curricular matters with broadcast practitioners. Articles\nwritten about broadcast journalism curricular updates origi-\nnate from academics. Furthermore, the works cited in those\nacademic articles reference other academics.\nFBJs work with students graduating from MC programs.\nThrough observation and industry experience, FBJs can\nidentify strengths and weaknesses of recently graduated stu-\ndents. The ability to work with and observe recent graduates\nplaces FBJs in a unique position to critique the work of post-\nsecondary MC departments.\nThe few articles that do highlight the FBJ's perspective\nignore broadcast journalism literature. This conceptual report\nadds to the current literature by combining FBJs'suggestions\nwith concepts from broadcast journalism literature. This\ncombination is put forward not only to develop a set of sug-\ngested practices for a modern broadcast MC department but\nalso to encourage post-secondary MC departments to open\nlines of communication with local broadcast media.\nResearch question. A primary goal of any post-secondary MC\nprogram is to graduate students who are ready to compete in\nthe broadcast production job market. With rapid change\noccurring in communication information systems, technol-\nogy and production practices broadcast journalism depart-\nments must determine best curricular practices to aid\nbroadcast journalism students' transition into professional\njournalism. To determine best practices, this report will con-\nsider both the academic literature and interviews conducted\nwith FBJs when answering the guiding research question:\nResearch Question 1: According to field broadcast jour-\nnalists, what knowledge, skills, and training are required\nwhen transitioning from MC student into professional\nbroadcast journalist?\nLiterature Review\nChanges in broadcast journalism.In the field of broadcast\njournalism instruction, what was current and acceptable to\nteach 5 years ago is now outdated. A few years ago, the pres-\nence of social media sites, such as YouTube, Twitter, and\nTaylor and Maxwell 3\nFacebook, had little impact on day-to-day journalism. Before\n2011, training student journalists to communicate through\nsocial media was considered little more than a lecture side\nnote. Furthermore, equipment such as high-definition video\ncameras, media capture technology, and editing software\nwere comparatively expensive before 2011. Today, for\nexample, most consumer-grade smartphones capture high-\ndefinition video. Before 2011, high-definition video capture\nbroadcast journalism department that developed a 5-year\nplan in 2011 may find itself quickly into an outdated\ncurriculum.\nWhile the above statements may \"feel\" correct, the aca-\ndemics reading this document may scream, \"Where is the\nsupport?\" In fact, the academic literature is active concern-\ning the discussion of broadcast journalism evolution at both\nthe industry and academic levels. Articles printed in trade\nmagazines regularly announce declining news budgets\ndiscussions are held in the trade literature about new tech-\nniques for broadcasting. For example, reporting through\nsocial media is a common theme (Stevenson & Peck, 2011;\nWalejko, 2010). Mixed in with these discussions are calls for\nthe revamping of the broadcast journalism curriculum (Hu,\nJournalism:working professionals versus journalism instructors.There\nhas been a long-standing conflict between FBJs and JIs. Du\nand Thornburg (2011) claim that the differences of opinion\ndate back to at least the 1990s. Both sides of the debate pro-\nvide valid points (to be discussed below). The result of this\nconflict, however, is a lack of communication between FBJs\nlack of communication has caused the education of student\njournalists to suffer because FBJs do not often communicate\nnecessary job skills to JIs. When an FBJdoes reach out to an\nMC department, she or he finds few listening.\nPoint of view: field broadcast journalists. FBJs emphasize prac-\ntice over theory. These journalists believe that courses in\nmedia theory, communication studies, and so on are ulti-\nmately a waste of students' time (Benigni et al., 2011;\nliterature, FBJs believe that students need training in the\nskills of writing for broadcast, capturing a story through the\ncamera's lens and editing (Mensing, 2010; Du & Thornburg,\n2011). All other courses amount to little more than a waste of\nstudents' time and money. FBJs claim theoretical concepts\nwill become evident to students after they (the students) have\nspent some time in the field.\nFBJs believe that MC departments keep students in the\nclassroom far longer than is necessary (Benigni et al., 2011;\n2011). Furthermore, FBJs often feel that JIs have been out of\nthe newsroom for too long. JIs, according to the FBJs, are out\nof touch with modern concepts and technology (Du &\nPoint of view of academic journalists. JIs realize that fieldwork\nis crucial but argue that a college education is about more\nthan training on equipment and technical skills. This group\nof journalists insists theory must accompany technical train-\ning (Benigni et al., 2011). JIs argue they are preparing stu-\ndents to work in the world after college (Du & Thornburg,\non to the newsroom (Flamm, 2013). The above statistic illus-\ntrates that the majority of MC students must be ready to work\nin other areas of the workforce. Also, theory must be taught\nto prepare those students who can continue to graduate\nschool. JIs' arguments on this topic may be summed up as\nfollows: JIs are not in the business of training students to be\ntechnicians working in a newsroom. Rather, the JI is teaching\nstudents concepts that will transform them (the students) into\nproductive citizens of the world.\nStrong points on both sides. Clearly both sides have strong\npoints. JIs can be resistant to change. This resistance can lead\nto coursework that ignores modern practices and technolo-\ngies. When modern practices and technologies are ignored,\nstudents may not graduate fully prepared to work in the\nbroadcast field. FBJs, however, must be willing to concede\nthat a post-secondary education is about more than instilling\ntechnical knowledge.\nWhen a student hangs a post-secondary MC diploma on\nhis or her wall, certain assumptions can be made about the\nknowledge of that student. An MC diploma represents more\nthan an education in practice and drill exercises. Rather, an\nMC diploma represents the completion of courses in media\nlaw and ethics, media history, communication theory, and\nother scholarly courses of thought. The JI, therefore, would\nargue that an MC graduate is not merely a video technician.\nRather, the JI may claim the MC graduate is a well-rounded\nmedia scholar.\nMethod\nThe purpose of this study is to bridge the disconnect in com-\nmunication between FBJs and higher education MC depart-\nments. To achieve this goal, first, the academic literature was\nscoured for discussions concerning the FBJs' influence\ntoward MC departments' curriculum. After searching the lit-\nerature, FBJs were consulted. Consultations with the FBJs\nwere conducted in the form of semi-structured interviews.\nThe research design for this study was naturalistic inquiry.\nThe naturalistic inquiry paradigm. The naturalistic paradigm is\na method of investigation in which the researcher becomes\nimmersed in the subject matter (Erlandson, Harris, Skipper,\n4 SAGE Open\n& Allen, 1993). That is to say, the researcher meets and inter-\nviews people who have deep knowledge of the subject mat-\nter. Furthermore, in naturalistic inquiry, the researcher spends\ntime in the research setting. During time in setting, the\nresearcher observes how participants interact with their sur-\nroundings and with other people. The result of these interac-\ntions will be findings that hold thick description (Lincoln &\nGuba, 1985). To achieve time in setting, the lead researcher\nconducted site visits to television news studios, local televi-\nsion stations, and video production studios. Interviews were\nconducted with experienced broadcast professionals.\nAxioms.Lincoln and Guba (1985) outline five axioms that\ndefine natural inquiry. While each of the axioms guided this\narticle, one axiom worked as a focusing concept. That axiom\nis Axiom 4, The Possibility of Causal Linkage.\nAxiom 4, The Possibility of Causal Linkage, states,\naccording to Lincoln and Guba (1985), all entities are in a\nstate of mutual simultaneous shaping so that it is impossible\nto distinguish causes from effects. Axiom 4 holds promi-\nnence in this article because it illustrates the unbreakable\nrelationship between broadcast journalism as a profession\nand broadcast journalism as a higher education curriculum.\nA goal of broadcast journalism instruction is to train stu-\ndents to work as broadcast professionals. Changes at the pro-\nfessional level should influence change at the high education\nlevel. In turn, students graduating from college should bring\nnew ideas into the professional ranks. Thus, each group\ninfluences and shapes the other.\nAxiom 4 illustrates the importance of an article such as\nthis one. There is an unbreakable bond between broadcast\njournalism as a profession and as a higher education course\nof study. When communication between these two groups is\nlimited, the flow of information is affected. This lack of com-\nmunication can lead to students being less prepared to enter\nthe professional ranks and fewer innovative ideas being\ntransmitted from universities into the broadcast profession.\nData collection.\nInterviews were conducted in a semi-\nstructured format. A semi-structured interview, according to\nErlandson et al. (1993) is \". . . guided by a set of basic ques-\ntions and issues to be explored, but neither the exact wording\nnor order of the questions is predetermined\" (p. 86). This\nstructure allowed the lead researcher to explore concepts\nbrought up by the broadcast professionals. For example, the\nmajority of interviewees discussed the concept of intense\ninternships. The semi-structured interview format allowed\nfor questions such as, \"How would you develop an intern-\nship?\" or \"What skills should an internship reinforce or\nteach?\"\nQuestions for each interview originated from an institu-\ntional review board (IRB)\u00adapproved list. A sample question\nfrom the approved list is, \"What surprises you most about\nstudents currently graduating from MC departments?\" The\napproved list of questions served as initial probes into the\nbroadcast professionals' views. For questions/concepts\nwhere deeper inquiry was needed, the lead researcher asked\nto follow up or clarify questions not included on the approved\nlist. Clarifying questions were approved through IRB pro-\ncess as a method of inquiry.\nData analysis. Interviews for this report were conducted dur-\ning the months of March and April 2013. Each interview was\ntape-recorded for transcribing and coding purposes. Partici-\npants were made aware of the recording and asked to\nacknowledge and approve recoding of the interviews (Lin-\nParticipants.For this study, four broadcast professionals\nwere interviewed. To qualify as a \"broadcast professional,\"\nparticipants must earn (at the time of the interview) their liv-\ning working in the broadcast industry. For this study, employ-\nment in the broadcast industry is defined as work that\ncontributes to the production and broadcast, through a mass\nmedium, of newscasts, documentaries or other on-air live or\npre-recorded productions. Below is a description of each par-\nticipant's professional qualifications as experts for this study:\nR1: R1 has worked in the broadcast profession for more\nthan 20 years. R1 began working as a part-time photogra-\npher for news stations throughout South Texas. R1 has\nalso worked as a news editor and segment producer.\nCurrently, R1 is employed as the video producer for a\nSouth Texas university. In this capacity, R1 shoots and\nedits news stories and documentaries relating to the post-\nsecondary. R1 also works production contracts several\ntimes a month. As a contract videographer/editor, R1 has\nworked with the National Basketball Association\u00ad\nDevelopment League (DNBA), National Basketball\nAssociation (NBA), Texas high school football, and other\nsporting events. Beyond sports, R1 has shot and edited\ndocumentaries and live multi-cam events for music acts\nacross the United States and Mexico. R1 has worked\ndirectly with acts such as Mana, Los Lobos, Jennifer\nLopez, Eva Longoria, and several others.\nR2: R2 has worked in the broadcast profession for more\nthan 20 years. The first professional job R2 held was as a\nnews photographer for various stations in the California/\nNevada area. Throughout the years, R2 as worked as a\nnews editor, writer, and newscast producer. Currently, R2\nworks primarily as a producer for a government access\nstation in a large southwestern U.S. city. In this capacity,\nR2 works several hours each week with local and national\nnews stations.\nfirst job was master control operator for a South Texas\nnews station. From master control, R3 was promoted to\nnews photographer, editor, and eventually executive news\nproducer. Currently, R3 works as a videographer/editor\nfor a South Texas city government television station.\nTaylor and Maxwell 5\nR4: R4 graduated with a degree in broadcast journalism\nfrom a medium size Texas post-secondary in 2011. After\ngraduation, R4 began working, at the national level, as a\nmaster control operator/videographer for the news depart-\nment of a Spanish-language broadcast outlet. Currently,\nR4 works as a writer/videographer/editor/producer for a\nmedium sized city access channel in South Texas.\nFindings\nTechnology.With advancements in technology have come\nnew responsibilities for the professional broadcast journalist.\nR1 stated,\n. . . the times have changed, lot, back in the day if you were a\nvideographer you carried your camera and your audio on the\nside. And, nowadays you have those one-man bands where a lot\nof stations are going. Which means you run audio, which means\nyou are a videographer, which means you are in charge of audio,\nwhich means you have to carry out of all these items with you\nand know how to use them because you know what you use is\nnot going to wait for you. (N. T. Taylor, personal communication,\nR4 (N. T. Taylor, personal communication, April 20,\n2013) illustrates the extent to which technology has changed\nsince 2010: \"You know when I started, we used digital tape,\nvideo cameras . . . Then we moved into the SD cards. And\nthat was a big change.\" R1 and R4 illustrate the need for\npost-secondary MC departments, instructors, and ultimately\nstudents to keep up with changing technology.\nTechnology take away\nWhat universities are doing right.Broadcast technol-\nogy, as mentioned previously in this report, is in a state of\nrapid change. Adapting to the constant technology updates\nis expensive. Each of the FBJs interviewed for this report\nrecognize that fact and applaud universities for incorporat-\ning technological changes as quickly as possible. R2 (N.\n\"I have seen education adapting. Maybe not as fast as the\nbroadcasters but that's because it's so expensive.\" R1 fur-\nther supported the efforts of post-secondary instructors by\nstating,\n. . . if your division is not going to support you, not buy you one\ncameras what are you going to do? You do the best you can with\nwhat you have. But it's not teaching them that full experience.\nAccording to the interviews for this report, JIs are knowl-\nedgeable concerning current broadcast industry standard\nequipment.\nWhere universities can improve.During the interviews,\nthe FBJs expressed that universities are not fully preparing\nstudents to work in the world of broadcast journalism. The\nbasics need to be stressed throughout classes. Throughout\nthe interviews, the FBJs lamented students lack proficiency\nin writing, videography, and editing. R3 noted, \"I don't think\nthey're trained. They just don't seem ready for the world\"\nmented,\nOne thing I should've learned or wish we learned more about\nwas presentation. How to stand in front of the camera, do stand-\nups. What are the step-by-step's what is the process, voice tone,\nwhere to stand. I didn't learn all that. I wish I had. Plus things\nlike white balance things like iris I think we need to do more of\nthat. (N. T. Taylor, personal communication, April 20, 2013)\nKnowing how to execute basic videography and broad-\ncast storytelling techniques are the skills that aid a student in\nthe transition into professional broadcaster. While most post-\nsecondary MC departments offer courses that instruct in vid-\neography skills, there is obviously an issue with students\nretaining instructed information.\nThat is to say, the students are not well rounded in the\nskills of writing, shooting, and editing. R2 (N. T. Taylor, per-\n. . . writing, I don't see enough real-world, extensive experience.\nThey don't get enough. Well, you got to know how to write fast\nand accurate. In news, you have hourly deadlines. Also, I've\ngiven my interns some opportunities to shoot and, I have say, \"I\nhaven't been impressed.\" Just the basics they seem to have\ntroubles with. Things like how long you hold your shot,\nsequencing when to pan when to tilt, not letting the camera\njiggle.\nR1 (N. T. Taylor, personal communication, March 21,\n2013) added to the conversation by stating, \". . . what helped\nme be in this career was the hands-on learning in high school.\nI mean by the time I went in I already knew what I was going\nto face because I have that hands-on learning.\" The FBJs'\nstatements were repeated throughout the interviews. Each of\nthe interviews indicated that students needed more practice\nwith videography and broadcast storytelling. So, although\nuniversities are stocking industry standard (or near) equip-\nment, according to the FBJs, the schools are not utilizing the\nequipment. That is to say, the schools have the equipment,\nbut the students are not gaining enough practical experience\nwith the technology.\nTechnology purchases.When considering equipment pur-\nchases for a post-secondary broadcast journalism department,\nthe temptation will be to buy less expensive, smaller gear.\nThat temptation arises because the equipment can capture\nbroadcast quality images and sound at a low cost. The fact is\n6 SAGE Open\nthat small high-definition (HD) cameras, inexpensive micro-\nphones, and free editing software do not prepare students for\nwork in professional broadcast agencies.\nBroadcast organizations utilize professional grade equip-\nment. The news stations expect new hires to understand how\nto use that equipment. Furthermore, it is important to note\nthat news stations still utilize studio cameras controlled\nthrough servos on full pedestals. News stations utilize multi-\nple brands of editing software. However, free software, such\nas iMovie, was not seen in use during research for this study.\nThe following are suggestions for equipment purchases:\nCameras purchased need to have manual white-balance\nand iris functions.\nHD cameras need to shoot to media card, only. Tape is no\nlonger utilized.\nStudents need to learn how to connect various pieces of\nequipment together. So, XLR, VGA, SDI, BNC, HDMI, and so\non cables must be available and utilized during coursework.\nLive production hardware and software, such as the\nNewTek TriCaster, will train students for work in modern\nproduction houses.\nEditing software must be current.\nAccess to web-connected computers is necessary.\nOne-person band.Universities need to teach the one-\nperson-band approach to journalism. Many students walk\ninto post-secondary broadcast studio with dreams of becom-\ning an anchor. Those dreams are valid and achievable. How-\never, in the modern news station to achieve the dream of\nbecoming an anchor, students must first master other broad-\ncast technologies and skills. R3 made this point by stating,\nThe students say I want to be an anchor I want to be a reporter.\nThen the producer says here is your gear and the students don't\nknow what to do it. It's as if they're too good to handle a camera\nthey are better than to do that. But then these are the times, and\nyou can't say you are better than that. (N. T. Taylor, personal\nIn other words, students need to learn all aspects of broad-\ncasting. Assigning basic camera drills, practicing cable wrap-\nping or teaching about encoding-frame-rates may seem, at first,\nlike boring, busy work. Those assignments, however, teach\ncritical tasks. The students will hate the work while in class but\nappreciate the knowledge when working at a news station.\nThe one-person-band approach to journalism, it is impor-\ntant to note, is not favored by FBJs. R2 called the one-\nperson-band approach \"A hard pill to swallow\" (N. T. Taylor,\nstated that this style of reporting leads to diminished produc-\ntion quality and a lowed level of storytelling/fact finding. R3\npoints out,\nI guess it is good, I see where they're coming from saving\nmoney, TV stations. But at the same time you lose the visual\nelement. Something I have seen a lot happening lately is shaky\nvideo, on standard stand-ups, just stuff you can see this is a one-\nperson band.You can tell the reporter doesn't know videography\nor editing. There are a lot of black holes in the editing. (N. T.\nEach of the FBJs stated that the one-person-band approach\nto storytelling reduces journalistic quality. Perhaps it will be\ncurrent post-secondary students who bring back the news\nteam. Or perhaps it will be current post-secondary students\nwho perfect the one-person-band concept.\nTo prepare students for work as professional broadcast\njournalists, broadcast journalism departments must stock\nprofessional grade equipment. This equipment is expensive.\nHowever, every FBJ consulted during research for this report\ncited student access to professional grade equipment as a key\nfactor in gaining and keeping employment.\nParting thought on technology. Rapid changes in technol-\nogy make it difficult for broadcast journalism departments to\nstock the most current gear. However, broadcast journalism\ndepartments should work to maintain equipment as close to\nindustry standard as possible. True learning occurs, accord-\ning to the FBJs, when students have access to innovative les-\nsons, passionate faculty, and current technology.\nInternships and hands-on learning. The idea that students need\nto be competent in all areas of production (writing, shoot-\ning, editing) was repeated throughout the interviews. R2\nstated, \"The technology is seeing huge, huge change. You\nhave to be able to adapt to change . . .\" (N. T. Taylor, per-\nsonal communication, April 7, 2012). Throughout the inter-\nviews, it became clear, as mentioned above, today's\nbroadcast professionals must have knowledge of profes-\nsional grade cameras, modern editing software, plus other\nbroadcast tools to avoid difficulty in finding employment.\nThis sentiment is echoed in the literature (Hu, 2012; Pow-\nHands-on learning and intense internships were two sug-\ngestions each of the FBJs offered for training students to\nbecome better writers, shooters, and editors. Although many\nuniversities offer both hands-on learning and internships, the\nFBJs did not feel the students' education was deep enough in\neither area.\nInternships.The interviewed FBJs each recognized that\nmost universities encourage internships. However, through\nthe interviews, it became clear that internships should be\nmandatory rather than encouraged. R1 (N. T. Taylor, per-\nIn the real world, people are not going to tell you \"Go set up this\naudio system.\" Then take you by the hand teaching you how to\ndo it. They expect you to know how to do it, and when they\ncome over, everything has to be working.\nTaylor and Maxwell 7\nR2 also stressed the importance of internships: \"The\nschool should have mandatory internships. Something that is\nmandatory for the students to graduate. I don't know how\nmany schools do that, but I think it would help\" (N. T. Taylor,\nships at the post-secondary level are not uncommon, it is evi-\ndent that many FBJs do not believe internships are being\nutilized effectively. Each FBJ felt a need to stress the idea\nthat students could be better trained if internships had greater\nprominence in the curriculum.\nHands-on learning. Hands-on learning in the classroom was\nalso, according to the interviewed FBJs, an area of curricular\nweakness. Each of the FBJs stressed the importance of using\nbroadcast standard equipment during classroom, or lab, exer-\ncises. R3 (N. T. Taylor, personal communication, April 20,\n2013) stated, \"I mean you're not going to get this without\ngetting your hands-on equipment. You have to roll cables\nyou have to learn how to frame a shot with the camera.\" R2\nadded to the discussion by stating,\nYou (the student) need to know how to run the camera there a lot\nof buttons there a lot of knobs that you need to know how to\nwork. It's almost as if you need to be able to run your camera in\na dark room, without looking. (N. T. Taylor, personal\nAgain, many universities do provide access to cameras,\nprofessional editing software, and so on, but the FBJs believe\nthat training on real-world assignments is inadequate.\nInternships and hands-on-learning take away\nWhat universities are doing right.The FBJs recognized\nthat post-secondary instructors work hard to include hands-\non learning in class lessons and in helping students find\ninternships. Furthermore, the FBJs recognized that finding\nan internship in today's market is difficult. While discussing\nhands-on learning, R2 stated, \"The students I've met through-\nout the years, I don't feel like they've not had enough experi-\nence in their schooling that they are lost. I can train them\"\nthe topic of internships, R1 stated, \"in reality how much is\nthere out there for students? There is only so much. Times\nare changing we've got to find students who are willing to\nwork hard and go out and find those internships themselves\"\n(N. T. Taylor, personal communication, April 20, 2013). Evi-\ndently, the FBJs recognize the limitations of both class time\nand market internship.\nStudent motivation.A common complaint about today's stu-\ndents is that they are less motivated and lazier than past gen-\nerations of broadcast professionals. R1 states, \"I know a lot of\nstudents who have the talent but don't want to go out there and\ndo the work\" (N. T. Taylor, personal communication,April 20,\n2013). Each of the FBJs interviewed felt that students often\nlack passion and a willingness to take on entry-level jobs.\nWhen asked, \"What surprises you most about students\ntoday?\" R2 commented, \"I don't see the same level of pas-\nsion today\" (N. T. Taylor, personal communication, April 20,\n2013). Another comment from R2 illustrates that the issue of\nstudent motivation is not limited to one region or post-\nsecondary: \"We've had students from the post-secondary,\nwe've had students from the arts institute, and students from\nthe community college. And they talk a big talk. But, when it\ncomes down to it they don't want to learn the business\" (N.\nstudents to become more motivated and passionate about the\nhard work of storytelling may be a common topic of conver-\nsation among JIs; however, it is unsettling to hear these com-\nments from the FBJs.\nChanging times are often cited as the unofficial reason\nstudents seemingly have less passion toward the broadcast\nbusiness than past generations. A change in times and tech-\nnology may be a reason students seem to have less passion to\nlearn the craft of broadcast journalism. R3 made a very\ninsightful comment by stating,\nYou know back when you and I were students if someone had a\ncamera you knew they had to be important. Today complete\nepisodes of web episodes are shot with an iPhone so the days\nwhere being impressed by camera are gone. Well everybody has\na camera, why would anybody be impressed. (N. T. Taylor,\nR3's comment makes a great deal of sense. Past generations\nmay have had one to two cameras to share among an entire\npost-secondary department and a few editing bays with strict\nusage limits. Fewer than 10 years ago, access to industry\nstandard equipment was severely limited, whereas today, HD\ncameras are cheap and plentiful. And editing a project can be\naccomplished on most laptops bought at the local big box\nstore.\nR1 (N. T. Taylor, personal communication, March 21,\n2013) points to another possible cause for current students'\napparent lack of motivation:\n. . . a lot of the students, and you can talk about this in any major,\nthey don't know if this is what they want to do. They went 3\nyears into the program and they're getting ready to finish the\nfollowing year and they're not really sure what they want to do.\nR1's comment may be extended to illustrate a situation that\noccurs with many experienced professionals. That is, as a\nperson gains experience, it is possible to forget the insecurity\nand uncertainty of starting down a career path.\nStudent motivation take away\nWhat universities do right.Current students are not\nunmotivated; rather, they are differently motivated. That is\nto say what created passion in past generations of students\nwill not work for today's student. The FBJs interviewed for\n8 SAGE Open\nthis report recognize the hard work broadcast journalism\nprofessors devote to the development of unique and modern\nassignments.\nR3 was impressed with an assignment given by an instruc-\ntor at a South Texas post-secondary. For the assignment, stu-\ndents were required to set up, shoot, and direct post-secondary\nbasketball games. The output was broadcast live on the are-\nna's jumbotron and through webcast. Referring to the assign-\nment, R3 stated, \". . . students helping with the games, the\nbasketball games are important. Helping stream basketball\ngames and things like that helps them sharpen their skills\" (N.\nthe FBJs had examples of innovative assignments. The FBJs\nnoted that innovative assignments build esprit de corps,\nunderstanding of the industry, and motivation to improve.\nThe FBJs also noted the pride instructors often feel in\ntheir students. Throughout the interviews, FBJs discussed\nhow hard JIs worked to build confidence within the students.\nR1 illustrated the importance of building student confidence\nIt's just as an instructor you have to find that thing. And as an\ninstructor once you find that real strength, he starts changing and\nthinking differently because he sees something positive about\nhimself. And all of a sudden he starts sharing with others. This\nautomatically becomes a cycle of students motivating each\nother.\nR2 furthered the discussion by stating, \"They (the JIs) are\ngoing to show the cameras, writing, producing. I mean, there\nare still many jobs in television and I think the students need\nto be encouraged to explore many areas\" (N. T. Taylor, per-\ncate that JIs are empowering students to take charge of their\n(the students) educational and eventually career success.\nWhere universities can improve. At times, the empower-\nment of students, in the FBJs opinion, should be reined in.\nThroughout the interviews, FBJs discussed the unrealistic\nexpectations of students. R3 stated, \"You can see it; out of\nschool students think they are going to be an anchor. And it\njust doesn't happen like that\" (N. T. Taylor, personal com-\na single focus a lot. That is, `I want to be on TV'\" (N. T.\ngoal of becoming a news anchor or reporter is noble, current\nstudents seem to have lost sight of an important fact. That fact\nis, before being employed as an anchor, most journalists must\nfirst work several other (less glamorous) broadcast jobs.\nThe singular focus of some students can be upsetting to\nveteran broadcast professionals. Each of the FBJs inter-\nviewed expressed annoyance with students/recent graduates\nwho scoffed at entry-level work. R1 (N. T. Taylor, personal\nseen is that a lot of students think they know everything\nbecause they're going through a program. So they want to\ntell a person with experience how to do things. And that's\nwrong.\"\nWhile internal motivation cannot be taught, expectations\ncan be managed. That is to say, JIs need to explain that entry-\nlevel work, even with a college degree, is often the first step\nto gaining employment in the broadcast industry. Instructors\nmust make it clear that positions such as master control oper-\nator or weekend studio camera operator are important first\nsteps to lifelong work as a broadcaster. Furthermore, JIs must\nexplain that tasks, such as rolling cables, are critical aspects\nof the business. R2 (N. T. Taylor, personal communication,\ngot to start somewhere, you have to build up a resume, make\nyour contacts.\"\nParting thoughts on student motivation.To say current\nstudents are unmotivated is untrue. Rather, the students are\ndifferently motivated. Instructors, who empower their stu-\ndents, tend to have students more capable of moving into the\nprofession. JIs, however, must manage student expectations.\nNever letting the students feel that they (the students) are too\ngood for entry-level broadcast work.\nDiscussion\nBridging the gap: the development of an advisory board.Broad-\ncast Journalism practitioners are at the center of the changes\ndiscussed earlier. More important, though, it is the practitio-\nners who will be mentoring, training, and hiring the students\nwho graduate from the post-secondary broadcast journalism\ndepartments. There is an unbreakable bond between broad-\ncast as an industry and as an academic course of learning.\nWhen one considers this close bond, the question must be\nasked, why are these two groups not working together on a\nregular basis? A method for building relationships, increas-\ning industry knowledge, and developing best instructional\npractices is an advisory board consisting of practicing FBJs,\nJIs, and MC students.\nAdvisory board. An advisory board is a group of knowledge-\nable professionals who, through shared vision, work to\nimprove not only the state of their profession but also class-\nroom teaching techniques. Through an advisory board,\nexperts in the field have the opportunity to increase profes-\nsional knowledge, improve current practices, and create\nguidelines for educational standards. Benigni et al. (2011)\nexplain one reason an MC department should establish an\nadvisory board:\nWith declining budgets and shrinking job markets, academic\ndepartments must become more proactive in engaging industry\nleadership in order to meet departmental needs for support and\nTaylor and Maxwell 9\nto assist their students with the transition to paid work after\nThe literature discusses the tendency of JIs to struggle in\nThere are several reasons for this isolation. Much of the iso-\nlation is due to the JIs' busy schedules. Often overwhelming\nworkloads force JIs to solve issues on their own rather than\nconsulting a board (Du & Thornburg, 2011). However, there\nis also a tendency for educators to look inward rather than\nout to the community for answers.\nFor whatever reason JIs' isolation occurs, it must stop.\nThe literature illustrates that MC students feel unprepared\nonce they enter the workforce (Du & Thornburg, 2011).\nClearly, it is time new tactics are put in place. One new tactic\nto be considered is the advisory board.\nAn effective advisory board can help bridge the divide\nbetween FBJs and JIs. The literature suggests the board\nshould consist of pro-active individuals who are interested in\nimproving the state of MC education (Benigni et al., 2011;\ngroup that includes FBJs, JIs, and students. In other words,\nall stakeholders should have a role in the advisory board.\nLimitations of paper. The purpose of this article is to begin the\nconversation between broadcast journalism professionals\nand university broadcast journalism departments. For that\nreason, the sample size (n = 4) is small. The small sample\nsize makes generalizability and transferability difficult.\nThis limitation can be expected when conducting natural-\nistic inquiry. Lincoln and Guba (1985) define this limitation\nas Axiom 3, The Possibility of Generalization. Axiom 3,\naccording to Lincoln and Guba, states, \"Only time-and-\ncontext bound working hypotheses . . . are possible\" (p. 38).\nThe author maintains that the limitation of Axiom 3 does not\ndiminish the importance of this article. The voices of all\nstakeholders must be heard, acknowledged, and considered.\nTopic for further study.Developing a conversation between\njournalism professionals and instructors requires both groups\nto take part in the discussion. Further study in this area would\nnecessitate interviewing both journalism professionals and\ninstructors. Focus groups, where both groups share percep-\ntions and ideas, can be a method for facilitating these discus-\nsions. Future studies must also include discussions of best\ncurricular practices. MC departments constantly update\nassignments and curriculums. Future studies must highlight\nthe innovative work of the JI.\nTone of interviews. FBJs observe the end result of JIs' work.\nThat end result is the trained broadcast journalism student/\nrecent graduate. This fact places FBJs in a unique position to\nevaluate and critique the work of JIs. For that reason, the\nvoice of the FBJ must be heard.\nThe FBJs' voices in this article may seem critical of\neducators. Where in fact, the FBJs interviewed\nhad tremendous respect for JIs. R2 (N. T. Taylor, personal\ncators by saying, \"No doubt the professor plays an impor-\ntant role.\" A critical tone may be due to the following: (a)\nEach of the professionals explained that it was not uncom-\nmon for post-secondary broadcast journalism departments\nto disregard their (the FBJs) suggestions. So, when finally\ngiven a chance to talk, years of built-up ideas and concerns\nflooded out. (b) The lead researcher did not ask, \"What are\nuniversities doing right?\" For these reasons, the FBJs were\nnot able to discuss areas in which the educators are\nsuccessful.\nFinal thoughts. Changes in the broadcast journalism profes-\nsion need to be addressed at the post-secondary level.\nMensing (2010) argues that broadcast journalism is often\ntaught by out-of-touch instructors who utilize textbooks with\noutdated information. This may be a valid argument. Jour-\nnalism instructors will often claim the importance of teach-\ning only \"the basics.\" The problem with instructing the\nbasics is that many of those basic rules have changed since\n2010. To ensure that broadcast journalism students are com-\npetitive in the market place, JIs need to consider updating the\ncurriculum. When updating the curriculum, instructors need\nto consult industry professionals\nThe information for this report was derived from both the\nacademic literature and the recommendations of interviewed\nbroadcast professionals. After considering all the informa-\ntion provided, this report suggests curricular updates in the\nareas of technology, hands-on learning, and managing stu-\ndent expectations. The overriding suggestion of this report,\nhowever, is the importance of working in tandem with\nbroadcast industry professionals during the broadcast jour-\nnalism departments' curricular update process.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\ndecline for nations top 100 media companies.
