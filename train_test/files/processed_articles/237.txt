Some of these programs\nhave successfully increased self-reported condom use and other\nforms of contraception among sexually active adolescents.9\u00ad15\nNevertheless, it is not clear whether these programs are imple-\nmented early enough to instill the idea of regular condom use in\nthe minds of adolescents before the onset of sexual activity.16,17\nThis is particularly important because many young people are\nsexually active for months before seeking medical care for repro-\nductive health, with as few as 40% of young women seeking health\ncare for contraception within 12 months after sexual debut.18\nAgainst this background, several studies of condom use in\nteenagers have found that adolescents reporting condom use dur-\ning their most recent sexual experience frequently report having\nalso used a condom at sexual debut.19\u00ad22 The primary goal of this\nstudy is to assess whether the observed association between con-\ndom use at sexual debut and subsequent condom use is spurious,\nor if some adolescents get into the habit of using a condom from\nthe onset of sexual activity. Acknowledging the potential for\nmultiple and changing influences on condom use behavior over\ntime, we explore the association in a nationally representative\nrandom sample of adolescents by adjusting for potentially con-\nfounding factors thought to influence condom use.\nOur study is guided by a conceptual model of condom use that\nincorporates multiple independent factors previously shown to\ninfluence teenage condom use, including both stable traits and\nbehaviors more proximate to sexual activity (Fig. 1). In addition to\nthese factors, our model includes a direct effect of condom use at\nsexual debut on subsequent condom use. We theorize that when a\nteenager uses a condom at their sexual debut, the foundation for a\nhabit of condom use is established. The logic is that for adolescents\nwhose initial experience of sexual intercourse includes using a\ncondom, condoms become a routine part of sex; we expect, there-\nfore, that these adolescents will be more likely to regularly use\ncondoms in their subsequent sexual encounters. By analogy, we\nconsider the use of automobile seatbelts and bicycle helmets; we\nknow that children trained to use these protective measures from\nday 1 are more likely to continue to use them over time, because\nfor these children, helmets and seatbelts are an integral part of the\nexperience of riding in a car or on a bicycle.23,24 In contrast, adults\nasked to adopt these protective measures after they are already\naccustomed to riding without a seatbelt or helmet are slow to\nThis study was supported in part by the University of Washington\nSTD/Cooperative Research Center (NIHAI/MH34118) and by a training\ngrant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NI-\nThe authors would like to acknowledge Dr. J.

Add Health is a stratified\nnationally representative sample of adolescents attending high\nschool in the United States. Between September 1994 and April\nof 143 sampled schools completed a self-administered, in-school\nquestionnaire. These respondents were then stratified by grade and\ngender and sampled to generate a core sample of approximately\n12,000 adolescents for the in-home phase of the study; in addition,\nAdd Health oversampled various minority groups. A total of\n20,745 adolescents completed the in-home questionnaires between\nApril and December 1995. Weighting of the full sample ensures a\nnationally representative sample of 7th to 12th graders in the\nUnited States.\nTopics covered by the in-home interview included health status,\nnutrition, peer networks, decision-making processes, family com-\nposition and dynamics, educational aspirations and expectations,\nemployment experience, romantic partnerships, sexual partner-\nships, substance use, and criminal activities. Interviewers used\nlaptop computers to record answers for the in-home question-\nnaires, with audio-CASI (audio-computer-assisted self-interview)\nused for sensitive topics to ensure confidentiality and to minimize\nparental and interviewer influence. All study participants provided\ninformed consent. Details of the sample design and methodology\nare available at www.cpc.unc.edu/addhealth/design.\nSample\nOur primary analysis sample was restricted to the 4024 adoles-\ncents 12 to 18 years old who reported having sexual intercourse,\ndefined as vaginal intercourse, at least twice and with a minimum\nof 30 days separating the date of first intercourse from that of most\nrecent intercourse. We required this interval of at least 1 month\nbetween encounters to avoid scenarios in which the first and last\nintercourse occurred proximately (ie, during the same date). We\nalso constructed a subsample of respondents (n  698) for whom\nwe were able to match data describing their first and most recent\nsexual partner.\nAnalysis Strategy\nWe began by estimating the direct effect of self-reported con-\ndom use at first sex on self-reported condom use at most recent sex\nin our primary sample. Then we reestimated this effect, controlling\nfor a broad set of potentially confounding factors. We followed a\nsimilar strategy for our partnership sample, including characteris-\ntics of the partnerships. All models were estimated using logistic\nregression and corrected for Add Health's sample design by using\nSTATA's survey routine.\nConfounding Factors\nOur adjusted models include potential confounders previously\nreported to influence the likelihood of condom use among adoles-\ncents. We distinguish between relevant personal and demographic\ncharacteristics that are stable over time and proximate behaviors\nassociated with particular sexual experiences. Stable factors are\nincluded to distinguish those adolescents who are predisposed to\nuse condoms from those who are less likely to use condoms, net of\nother factors. Because the proximate factors are time-varying and\ndependent on the individual's experience, they could be present (or\nabsent) at sexual debut and absent (or present) at most recent sex.\nAmong stable traits, we considered gender, race,22,27\u00ad30 intelli-\ngence, and socioeconomic status. Proximate factors include\nFig. 1. A conceptual model of condom use.\ntoms,39 attitudes and perceived risk of infection and pregnan-\nResults\nSample Descriptives\nSlightly more than half of the adolescents in our primary sample\nwere female (53%) and the average age was 16.5 years (range,\n12\u00ad18 years). Adolescents self-identified as white (65%), black\n(22%), Hispanic (9%), Asian (2%), Native American (1%), or\nother (1%). The population had a mean family socioeconomic\nstatus score of 5.6 (range, 0\u00ad10) and a mean intelligence score of\nHealth Picture Vocabulary Test. The majority (86%) reported\nhaving received some type of sexual education (information on\npregnancy or AIDS) in school. Additional descriptive data are\nreported in Table 1.\nAs shown in Table 1, the partnership subsample sample differs\nfrom the main study sample in several important ways. In general,\nwe were only able to match partnership data for respondents who\nhad fewer sex partners and had been sexually active for a relatively\nshort period of time. Thus, the subsample is more likely to be\nfemale, white, older at sexual debut and at most recent sex, and\nmore likely to report using a condom at sexual debut. They also\nreport a shorter time interval between first and most recent sex,\nmore often report using oral contraceptives at most recent sex, and\nmore often report feeling at risk for pregnancy and increased\npersonal motivation to use birth control. The subsample is less\nlikely to report a history of STD, risk-taking behavior, being drunk\nor high at most recent sex, negative feelings, and perceived chance\nof acquiring AIDS.\nMultivariate Logistic Regression Model of Main Sample\nTable 2 reports odds ratios (OR) from 2 models that regress\ncondom use at most recent sex on selected independent vari-\nables. Model 1 reports the direct unadjusted effect of using a\ncondom at sexual debut on the probability of using a condom at\nmost recent sex; consistent with other studies, we find that using\na condom at sexual debut was associated with a substantially\nincreased odds of using a condom at most recent sex (OR, 2.60;\nTABLE 1.

The findings from these analyses are similar to those\nfrom the main sample. The raw odds ratio for condom use at first\nsex and most recent sex in the bivariate model was 2.25 (95% CI,\n1.46\u00ad3.46), and this remained relatively unchanged after adjusting\nfor confounders, including the partnership characteristics (OR,\nsexual debut and other potentially influential factors, none of the\npartnership variables had a significant effect on the probability of\nusing a condom at most recent sex.\nDiscussion\nThis study examined the association between condom use at\nsexual debut and subsequent condom use. We found that condom\nuse at sexual debut increased the likelihood of condom use at most\nrecent sex, and that this effect was largely independent of the\ninfluence of stable demographic and personal characteristics and\nproximate attitudinal, behavioral, and relationship factors. This\nfinding is consistent with the idea that early condom use could help\nestablish a pattern of condom use that carries forward to subse-\nquent sexual activity.\nAs previously reported in the literature, we also find that having\nhigh self-efficacy in terms of birth control negotiation with a\npartner, personal motivation to use birth control, and concern\nabout unplanned pregnancy all increase a teenager's ability to plan\nOur finding that being drunk or high at most recent sex de-\ncreases the likelihood of condom use is consistent with some other\nstudies showing that being under the influence of inhibition-low-\nering substances such as alcohol or other illicit drugs affects\njudgment, decision-making, and planning and for the inexperi-\nenced adolescent likely has a negative impact on condom use.37,38\nTABLE 2.

Adolescent females\nfrequently report lower rates of condom use compared with their\nmale counterparts.27\u00ad30 This could reflect who their partners are,\nbecause teenage females often have partners many years older and\nthese partners might not be included in adolescent study samples.\nContrary to previous reports in the literature, we find little evi-\ndence that partnership characteristics influence the mean level of\ncondom use at most recent sex, although this could be the result of\ncomplex within-partnership dynamics not well captured in our\ndata.\nThis study has several limitations. First, the data concerning\nsexual activity, partnership characteristics, and condom use are\nprovided by self-report and could include measurement error re-\nsulting from social desirability effects or concern about confiden-\ntiality from interviewer, parents, or peers. Second, our data on\ncondom use are collected retrospectively and could contain recall\nerror. Third, the subsample for which we have data on partnerships\nis a selective sample that differs in several respects from the main\nstudy sample. Finally, our model could be misspecified. Data\nlimitations prevent us from precisely linking the timing of attitudes\nand behaviors to the first or most recent sexual encounter; more\nsignificantly, other unmeasured confounders could be associated\nwith condom use generally, which could further reduce the mag-\nnitude of the direct effect. For example, we do not have data on\ncondom availability, which could influence use patterns, and our\ninformation on family influence on condom use is limited to\nmaternal approval of birth control as reported by the adolescent for\nwhich we found little influence on condom use in our study\npopulation despite previous reports in the literature to the\nHowever, our study has several advantages over previous stud-\nies of condom use among adolescents.19\u00ad22 We use a large and\nnationally representative sample of adolescents; the data were\ncollected by A-CASI, which some studies have shown to elicit\nmore data about sensitive topics (eg, sexual behaviors) when\nTABLE 3.

Our robust finding that using a condom\nat sexual debut doubles the odds of condom use at most recent sex,\ncontrolling for other factors, highlights the importance of early and\ncomprehensive sexual education before the onset of sexual debut\nto develop safe sexual habits among all adolescents. There could\nindeed be a narrow window of opportunity, before sexual debut,\nduring which it is crucial to provide adolescents with the knowl-\nedge and motivation to protect themselves and their partners.\nSpecifically, these programs should provide adolescents with skills\nthat will encourage them to use condoms from their very first\nsexual experience, because this could increase the likelihood that\ncondom use becomes expected and routine for them over the\nlong-term. At the societal level, educating adolescents before they\nbecome sexually active could have long-term benefits for prevent-\ning the significant morbidity and mortality associated with un-\nplanned teen pregnancy and STD/HIV infection, reducing the\nassociated social burden and economic costs.\nNew interventions should then be directed toward adolescents\nwho are not yet sexually active and have not yet established their\nown patterns of sexual behavior. Exposing sexually inactive ado-\nlescents to abstinence-only messages could be particularly coun-\nterproductive for the subsequent development of healthy sexual\npractices. Because STDs and unplanned pregnancy are hyperen-\ndemic among U.S. teenagers, perhaps condom use promotion\ncampaigns can borrow strategies from efforts to promote general\nhygiene in children (eg, daily teeth brushing) and injury prevention\n(eg, automobile seatbelt and bicycle helmet use).\nFurther research is needed to explore the lasting influence of\ncondom use at sexual debut on subsequent use. We need improved\nconceptualization and measurement of factors that predispose\nsome adolescents to use condoms to better assess possible selec-\ntion effects. We also need to know more about the dynamics of\nadolescent sexual partnerships and the pattern of condom use\nwithin different relationship types. Most importantly, we need to\nunderstand how to encourage adolescents who have not yet be-\ncome condom users to adopt this important practice. We recom-\nmend a comprehensive cost-effective sexual education interven-\ntion that is appealing to adolescents, nonthreatening to society, and\nyet oriented toward developing skills that will ensure the devel-\nopment of long-lasting healthy habits in our teenagers.\nReferences\n1.
