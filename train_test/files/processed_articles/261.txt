Declines in chronic disability\ncontinued over the 22-year period at a rate fast enough (i.e., 1.52%\nper annum) to contribute significantly to the long-term fiscal\nstability of the Medicare (and Medicaid) programs.

Singer and\nManton (3) showed that if chronic disability continued to decline\nat 1.5% per annum, there could be significant improvements in\nthe long-run fiscal stability of Social Security and Medicare.\nModeration of the rate of growth of Medicare and other public\nand private health expenditures, combined with increases in\ndisposable income and a propensity to increase consumption of\nhealth care as disposable income grows (4), may define new\neconomic conditions in the U.S. where health improvements and\nincreasingly productive health care investments (e.g., refs. 5\u00ad7)\ncould become a major stimulus for economic growth and for\nresearch and technical innovation (K.G.M., G. Lowrimore, D.\nTolley, and A. Ullian, unpublished work).\nUsing data from the National Long-Term Care Survey\n(NLTCS), Manton and Gu (8) found a per annum decline in\nbining NLTCS data with results of early to mid-20th-century\ndisability trends by Fogel (4) and Costa (9), Manton et al.

The forecasts showed\nsignificant long-term improvements in the ratio of active to total\nlife expectancy at age 65, with larger rates of improvement in the\nratio at ages 85. The rapid decline in chronic disability at ages\n85 is significant in that it is at such advanced ages where future\nlong-term improvements in health, functioning, and survival\nmust occur to maintain the current rate of improvement in the\nfiscal status of Medicare and Medicaid to 2050, the year by which\nthe last of the post-World War II baby boom cohorts has reached\nLinkage of Medicare cost and service use records with NLTCS\nchanges in Medicare costs to chronic disability declines (11). The\ncapita costs, adjusted for inflation, declined significantly in the\ngrowing nondisabled U.S. elderly population aged 65\u00ad84,\nwhereas Medicare per capita costs increased in the severely\ndisabled and institutional components of the U.S. elderly pop-\nulation, especially at ages 85.\nThose analyses showed that, over time, a larger proportion of\nMedicare expenditures were being targeted to the most severely\ndisabled individuals in the U.S. elderly population. The severely\ndisabled population was, over the same time period, declining in\nprevalence. This improved resource targeting may have been\naffected in part by the 1997 Balanced Budget Act (BBA; ref. 12),\nwhich mandated use of prospective payment systems (PPS) for\npostacute care services. PPS reduced the proportion of hospital\ndischarges to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), although it had\nlittle effect on SNF length of stay. The payment system had\nfinancial incentives to stimulate the growth of rehabilitation and\nlong-term care (LTC) hospitals for the most severely impaired\n(13).

(K.G.M., G. Lowrimore, D. Tolley, and A. Ullian,\nunpublished work) showed that health status improvements and\nassociated human capital growth might reduce Medicare and\nMedicaid expenditures to a combined cost of 12% of GDP in\n2080. That level of health care spending is consistent with levels\nof total GDP that could be expected to be dedicated to health\nspending (21% of GDP) in a society with a rapidly growing level\nof disposable income and a short-term elasticity of spending on\nFor federal health care expenditures to decline at the pro-\njected rate because of a per annum decline of 1.5% in chronic\ndisability, future disability declines will have to occur at increas-\ningly older ages. An evaluation of the relative age trajectories of\nMedicare and Medicaid costs in the final two years of life shows\nthat per capita, per annum Medicare costs appear to decline with\nage, whereas Medicaid and LTC costs tend to increase. The\nreason for this phenomenon is that Medicare covers primarily\nshort postacute-care institutional stays, whereas Medicaid can\ncover LTC costs for the indigent. A cross-over of these costs\ncurrently occurs at 90 years of age (K.G.M., G. Lowrimore, D.\nTolley, and A. Ullian, unpublished work). The importance of the\ncross-over is that Medicare costs tend to be more responsive to\nbiomedical research and therapeutic innovations than LTC\nservices, which are likely more subject to ``Baumol's disease''\n(i.e., resistance to technological innovation) because of the more\npersonal and labor-intensive, and often less biomedically skilled,\nnature of most services provided in LTC settings. Thus, to have\nthe desired effects on Medicare and Medicaid spending, invest-\nments in biomedical research will likely have to be effective in\nimproving health and rehabilitating function at increasingly\nadvanced ages.\nInvestment in biomedical research and the production of\ninnovative and more effective therapeutic and preventive med-\nical care are possible explanations for the continued decline in\nelderly disability rates. However, it is far too soon to evaluate\ndoubling of the National Institutes of Health budget. Other\npossible contributing factors include increasing levels of educa-\ntion, better nutrition, greater emphasis on exercise at later ages,\nand behavioral risk factor changes such as smoking cessation and\nmoderation of alcohol consumption. Changes in Medicare pro-\nalso have more efficiently directed more and better care to the\nmore severely disabled elderly (e.g., more emphasis on rehabil-\nitation services) through Medicare-reimbursed home health and\nSNF care. Also potentially important may be increased use of\nhome- and community-based LTC services as currently being\nevaluated in the Medicaid program. Identifying how each of\nthese factors may have contributed to the 22-year disability\ndeclines, and possible future changes, is a challenging but\nextremely important area of social, public health, and biomedical\nresearch. It may be crucial in dealing effectively with the medical\nand LTC needs of baby boomers over the next 45 years.\nBy using the most recent NLTCS, the current work examines\nhow age-standardized chronic disability prevalence rates\npresent four specific types of results. First are age-standardized\nlight-to-moderate levels of disability (i.e., only limitations in\nIADLs and up to four ADLs) and of severe levels of disability\n(five or more ADLs or institutional residence). This result is to\ndetermine whether the size of moderately and severely disabled\ngroups changed at the same, or different, rates over the two time\nperiods. The prevailing opinion in the literature (e.g., ref. 15)\nappears to have been that light or moderate levels of chronic\ndisabilities declined at a faster rate than higher-level chronic\ndisability, suggesting that declines may have been primarily the\nresult of social and housing innovations and expanded use of\nassistive devices. The final analysis shows how Medicare costs,\nstratified by level of disability and age group, changed over time,\nCompared with previous work, a number of specific changes\nin sample weighting and disability status determination were\nmade to improve longitudinal estimates of disability declines\nand sample weight calculation changes are discussed in Materials\nand Methods.\nResults\ndeclines in chronic disability prevalence rates observed in 1982\u00ad\nTable 1).

The decline, from\nAt all ages there are also large declines in the IADL-only and\none-to-two ADL-impaired groups. A possible explanation is the\nincreased availability of assistive devices and modifications in the\nbuilt environment, although some of these declines may also be\nbecause of earlier and better intervention in disability-related\ndisease processes (e.g., better interventions in diabetes manage-\nment; ref. 16). Only the three-or-four ADL-impaired group\nshows increases for age groups 75\u00ad84 and 85. Further analyses\nshould focus on why this specific level of disability should be\nresistant to change at ages 75.\nSevere Disability. We compare rates of decline in the light-to-\nmoderately (i.e., those with up to four ADLs, including persons\nwith impairment in at least one IADL) and severely (five or more\nADLs or in nursing home residence) disabled groups for 1982\u00ad\na division point is motivated partly because it is roughly halfway\nthrough the current NLTCS series and partly because it may\nreflect certain turning points in specific health and health care\nprocesses. For example, in 1990 cancer mortality rates started to\ndecline in the U.S., partly because of treatment innovation for\nspecific solid tumors (e.g., for early onset, aggressive female\nbreast cancer) and partly because of public health interventions\n(e.g., cohort-related reductions in male smoking rates). There\nalso emerged an economically viable U.S. biotechnology sector\nduring this time period, and biomedical research spending has\nbeen increased significantly.\nThe rate of improvement in the light-to-moderately impaired\nAge and\nRelative\nchanges, %\ngroup increased between the two time periods (0.9% to 1.7% per\nannum) but not as rapidly in either time period as declines in the\nseverely impaired groups (five or six ADLs or institutionalized),\nwhere the per annum rate of improvement increased from 1.4%\nto 2.4%. Thus, the rate of improvement for the most severely\ndisabled groups is more rapid in both time periods than for\nlight-to-moderately disabled groups. This finding contradicts the\nview that long-term declines in chronic disability prevalence are\nprimarily because of changes in the built environment and\nimprovements in assistive devices, and it suggests that biomedical\ninnovations in the management of diseases leading to serious\ndisability are increasing in importance post-1994. These esti-\nmates are statistically significantly different both over time and\nacross disability level based on a cross-time comparison of\nChanges in the Distribution of Medicare Expenditures over Disability\nthe average level of Medicare Part A per capita costs, adjusted\nfor the medical care consumer price index, over disability level.\nWe examine Part A Medicare expenditures because they reflect\nacute hospitalization, HHA, and SNF use; i.e., more medically\nintense types of Medicare services. In addition, Medicare Part A\ndata are complete with diagnoses back to 1984 when the acute\nhospital prospective payment system was instituted. Diagnoses\nfor Part B services, which are heavily weighted to physician or\noutpatient services, are only available since 1991. We performed\nanalyses both with Part A and total (A  B) Medicare expenses\nand found similar trends. Part A data, representing use of more\nmedically intense services, tended to show clearer trends and\npatterns. In addition, Part A funding directly involves the\nMedicare Trust Fund, and it has less flexibility to respond to the\ncost of Medicare service use increases than Part B, which is\nfunded from premiums (supplementary medical insurance) and\ngeneral revenue.\nincurred for persons with five or six ADLs, and it occurs in all\nyears and for both age strata.

The rate of decline for persons with five or more ADLs\nchange in the management of severely disabled persons, espe-\ncially in long-term institutional care. Before the 1980s, institu-\ntional LTC was primarily conceived of as residential and housing\nservices and maintenance care, which was not well developed\nelderly persons, especially those with depression and severe\ndementia and without significant socioeconomic resources, were\nin state mental hospitals. With the development of pharmaceu-\ntical treatments (e.g., Thorazine) for select mental health prob-\nlems and the deinstitutionalization movement in the 1960s,\nwere increasingly treated in the community, allowing numerous\nstate mental hospitals to be closed.\nMany elderly patients with depression and dementia and without\nviable private community residence options were discharged to\nnursing homes reimbursed by Medicaid. The residential use of\nnursing homes was facilitated by the 1955 National Housing Act and\nthe 1965 implementation of Medicare and Medicaid, both of which\npromoted nursing home construction. The peak number of nursing\nnursing home population grew more slowly than the U.S. elderly\npopulation, in part because of more stringent regulation of HHA\nhospital reimbursements.\nIn 1988, the Catastrophe Care Act was instituted and then\nrescinded. In response, Medicare SNF and HHA regulations\nwere loosened in 1989 (in part because of the Duggan vs. Bowen\ncourt decision in 1988), which allowed rapid increases in Medi-\nSNF care is intended to be postacute care and strongly limited\nin duration (100 days), the increased availability of postacute\ncare tended to reduce traditional nursing home admissions.\nMedicare expenditures on SNF and HHA service grew rapidly\nuntil 1997, when those benefits were restricted by the BBA. For\nexample, the BBA instituted a PPS system for SNFs with\nreimbursements weighted by how much rehabilitation was un-\ndertaken. Associated with changes in Medicare policy was the\nimproved economic status of the elderly, which gave them\nadditional private payment options such as the use of assisted-\nliving facilities.\nMore fine-grained analyses of the specific biological mecha-\nnisms underlying the long-term disability decline will be neces-\nsary to determine which biomedical research and treatment\ninnovation investments will best sustain the rate of declines in\nfunctional disability at late ages in the future. Continuing\nprogress will require significantly greater biomedical research\nexpenditures on fundamental mechanisms (i.e., at the cellular\nand molecular level) of chronic disease and human senescence\n(K.G.M., G. Lowrimore, D. Tolley, and A. Ullian, unpublished\nwork). Such fundamental discoveries will help enhance basic\nrehabilitation efforts at later ages through improved understand-\ning of neural and muscle function and of metabolism at the\nmolecular, cellular, and mitochondrial levels (e.g., 18, 19). This\nendeavor will involve looking in greater detail at the genetic and\nmolecular basis of disease processes and senescence to develop\neffective interventions at advanced ages (e.g., ages 95 in the\ndisability reduction was found to be higher at advanced ages\n(e.g., ages 85) in the NLTCS data series and that NLTCS data\nlinked to diagnostic records in Medicare files showed that\ncognitive impairment caused by circulatory events (especially\nstroke) declined significantly to 1999 (20). Reductions in cog-\nnitive impairment may set the stage for further physical reha-\nbilitation because of the greater compliance capacity in cogni-\ntively intact persons.\n2005 NLTCS linked to Medicare (and possibly Medicaid) service\nuse, diagnoses, and expenditure data. With the six surveys\nservices and expenditures recorded on a daily basis), more\ndetailed longitudinal analyses of individual and cohort disability\nand health dynamics can be undertaken. Knowledge of those\ndynamics will also be important in translating biomedical and\nrehabilitation innovations that can reduce chronic disability at\nmore advanced ages in the U.S. population.\nMaterials and Methods\nment files covering 97% of the U.S. elderly population. Each\nsurvey record is linked to continuous Medicare service use and\ncost data from the date that each NLTCS sample person passed\nage 65 or was included in the NLTCS sample above age 65 in\nInterviewing is done in two phases. The first is a screen that\ndetermines whether the person is chronically disabled (i.e., for\n90 days) on at least one of seven ADLs and nine IADLs. The\npresence of nursing home or institutional residence (and starting\nin 1994, assisted-living residence) is determined on the screen\ninstrument. The NLTCS definition of institutional residence\nrequires that medical services be available at the facility on a\neach wave, with 15,000 persons continuing from earlier waves\nand 5,000 persons drawn in a supplementary sample, aged\n65\u00ad69, who became Medicare-eligible between NLTCS waves.\nThe sample supplement aged 65\u00ad69 maintains the national\nrepresentativeness of the NLTCS for the entire elderly Medicare\nbeneficiary population, and it replaces long-term (5-year) sam-\noversamples of persons aged 95 were drawn. These over-\nsamples may be critical for designing interventions to maintain\ndisability rate declines in the long run. Medicare vital statistic\nrecords provide the exact date of death for all Medicare enroll-\nees selected into the NLTCS sample.\nThe second phase is a detailed community or institutional\ninterview that generates more comprehensive data on disabili-\nties, LTC not covered by Medicare, residential characteristics,\nsocioeconomic traits, and family and informal LTC caregiver\ncharacteristics. This phase takes roughly 55\u00ad60 min. Additional\nrisk factors [e.g., smoking, body mass index (BMI), and BMI\nchange] and nutritional measures have been added to the\nNLTCS instrument. In each NLTCS, innovations have been\nmade in the community interview content (e.g., next-of-kin\nmodule in 1989), some involving ancillary respondents. Rosters\nare made of caregivers, children, and family members. Small\nadditions have also been made to the screening instrument, e.g.,\nThe NLTCS began in 1982, when, not knowing the prevalence\npersons over age 65 from Medicare enrollment lists. This sample\nwas organized into roughly 100 reduction sets, which were to be\ndrawn until 6,000 persons chronically disabled (90 days) in at\nleast one of seven ADLs and nine IADLs were identified on the\ndisability were identified, with an additional 1,992 identified as\nliving in institutions.\nThe second NLTCS was conducted in 1984 to do a prepost\nanalysis of the consequences of the hospital DRGPPS for the\nMedicare elderly population. Cost constraints required that the\nanalyses were successful in identifying which chronically disabled\ngroups were most susceptible to PPS-induced changes in acute\nhospital use (e.g., decreased length of stay).\nThe NLTCS sample is followed longitudinally, but it can also\nbe assessed cross-sectionally. Supplemental samples of persons\nreaching age 65 between surveys are cross-sectionally con-\nstructed for each NLTCS, but they are followed longitudinally\nthrough later NLTCS waves.
