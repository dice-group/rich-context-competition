Introduction\nAdequate nutrition is an essential component of healthy brain development [1]. Protein, iron,\nfolate, essential fatty acids, and other key vitamins and minerals optimize the functioning of\nseveral brain areas, especially during the prenatal and early postnatal periods. Conversely, foods\nhigh in saturated fats have been shown to increase the risk of neuropsychological deficiencies by\ninterfering with molecular substrates that aid numerous cognitive functions [2]. Ultimately, poor\nnutrition has the potential to impair learning/memory [3,4], reduce verbal ability [5\u00ad7], diminish\nexecutive functions [8,9], and interfere with modulators of synaptic plasticity, such as brain-derived\nneurotrophic factor (BDNF) [2,10]. Inadequate nutrition may also increase the risk of antisocial traits\nand behaviors. For instance, research has shown that poor nutrition during the early stages of the\nlife course increases the likelihood of various criminogenic traits and behaviors during childhood\nand adolescence, including ADHD [11], externalizing behaviors [12,13], and aggressive/delinquent\nbehaviors [14]. Psychopathic individuals, moreover, tend to exhibit brain deficits [15] that are often\ndirectly or indirectly influenced by the adequacy and quality of nutrition [4].\nAlthough several studies have suggested that certain dimensions of nutrition influence both\ncognitive and behavioral outcomes, much of this work has been limited to childhood nutrition [3,7,9].\nThe tendency to emphasize childhood nutrition is understandable, given the substantial plasticity of\nthe brain during this stage of the life course. Recent research, however, has shown that nutritional\nfactors (e.g., fatty acids) during adolescence and adulthood can impact subsequent executive\nthat the relationship between poor nutrition and neuropsychological and mental health outcomes\nmay be moderated by genetic factors. Nevertheless, empirical tests of this possibility are generally\nlacking (except see [23,24]), despite a wealth of research indicating that gene-nutrient interactions\ninfluence the development of various physical ailments, including cancer and obesity [25].\nIn light of these voids in the literature, the goal of the present study is twofold. First, we\ntest whether indicators of poor and inadequate nutrition during adolescence significantly increase\nthe likelihood of two correlated outcomes during adulthood: verbal deficits and psychopathic\npersonality traits [26,27]. Our second objective is to examine whether the link between\nnutritional factors, verbal deficits, and psychopathic personality traits is moderated by a functional\npolymorphism in the promoter region of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene, a polymorphism\nthat has been linked to a host of antisocial outcomes [28,29].\n1.1. Poor Nutrition, Verbal Deficits, and Psychopathic Personality Traits\nA large body of research indicates that nutrition plays an important role in key brain\nfunctions [3,4,6,9,12,16]. Many of these studies have detected significant associations between\nnutritional factors and various components of verbal intelligence [6,19,30], including verbal\nfluency [3,5,7], word recall [31], and receptive vocabulary [32,33]. Furthermore, it appears that both\ndiet quality [6,19,30] and severe malnutrition [5,7] can influence verbal ability across multiple stages\nof the life course. For example, using a sample of 1269 Chinese children, Liu and colleagues [30] found\nthat children who regularly consumed breakfast scored higher on tests of verbal intelligence during\nthe kindergarten school year. Similarly, a study by Gale and colleagues [6] revealed that children who\nregularly eat healthy foods, including fruit, vegetables, and home-cooked meals, exhibited higher\nverbal IQ scores at age 4 than children who infrequently ate healthy foods.\nSome studies have also suggested that the benefits of a nutritious diet on verbal skills may\nnot be limited to childhood. For instance, a recent study by Waber and colleagues [7] examined a\nsample of middle-aged, Barbadian adults and found that those who experienced moderate to severe\nmalnutrition during infancy scored significantly lower on verbal fluency and associated cognitive\ntests, implying that the neuropsychological risk incurred through the experience of early nutritional\ndeficits may persist for decades. Other research has revealed that a poor quality diet during the\nadolescent years is predictive of reduced verbal intelligence through early adulthood, even when\ngenetic factors are taken into account [19]. Finally, research suggests that higher consumption of fatty\nfish during late adulthood enhances various aspects of verbal memory, including word recall [31].\nThus, the literature to date tends to detect a significant relationship between nutritional factors and\nvarious indicators of verbal ability.\nAlthough very few studies have examined the link between poor nutrition and psychopathic\npersonality traits (except see [34]), a number of studies have indicated that poor nutrition is\nsignificantly associated with a variety of mental health problems, including depression [35],\npsychosomatic complaints [14], schizophrenia [35], and schizotypal personality disorder [36]. Despite\nthe paucity of research linking nutrition to specific dimensions of psychopathy, some research has\nshown that certain personality traits associated with psychopathy, including disinhibition, hostility,\nand aloofness, can be linked to diet quality [37].\nA number of studies have also linked nutritional factors to an important correlate of\npsychopathic personality traits: violence [38]. Several researchers have randomly assigned study\nparticipants to receive micronutrient supplements to see whether doing so reduces violence and other\nproblematic behaviors [20,39]. Results have generally been supportive of the link between ingesting\nsupplements intended to mimic a well-balanced diet, reductions in violent and delinquent behaviors,\nand overall improvements in behavioral control. To illustrate, a study by Schoenthaler and Bier [39]\nfound that, relative to controls, children whose diet was supplemented with key micronutrients (e.g.,\ncalcium, magnesium, and vitamin C) exhibited a 47% reduction in the rate of antisocial behaviors.\nNon-experimental studies have also indicated that consuming inadequate and poor quality food\ncan heighten the risk of various behavioral problems during childhood and adolescence [12,13].\nIn light of this body of research, it is reasonable to suggest that nutritional factors might influence the\ndevelopment of psychopathic personality traits by early adulthood, particularly since verbal deficits\nand psychopathic personality traits are significantly correlated.\n1.2. MAOA Genotype, Verbal Deficits, and Psychopathic Personality Traits\nGenetic factors also appear to play an important role in the development of both verbal\ndeficits and psychopathic personality traits [40\u00ad42]. For instance, a handful of studies have\ndetected significant associations between the X-linked gene known as MAOA and diminished\nverbal ability [43\u00ad45]. In particular, males who possess a low-activity allele (i.e., a 2 or 3-repeat\nallele) on MAOA are more likely to evince greater deficits in verbal and social communication\nskills [43\u00ad45], particularly among males who have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders.\nAdditional research has found that MAOA interacts with other polymorphisms (e.g., COMT) to\npredict verbal intelligence among males with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [41]. Males who\ncarry a low activity allele are also at greater risk of exhibiting aggression and violence relative to other\nNot surprisingly, MAOA genotype has also been linked to personality traits associated with\npsychopathy [42,46]. For example, Williams and colleagues [42] found that males with a low\nactivity allele scored significantly higher on an index of various psychopathic personality traits (e.g.,\ncallousness, grandiose sense of self, pathological lying, disinhibition) relative to their high-activity\nMAOA counterparts. A study by Fowler and colleagues [46] garnered similar results using a sample\nof adolescents with a history of ADHD. The results of their study indicated that allelic variation on\nMAOA was significantly associated with total psychopathy scores as well as \"emotional dysfunction\"\npsychopathy scores (i.e., callousness or lack of emotional responsiveness) in this high-risk sample.\nResearch to date, therefore, suggests that allelic variation on MAOA is significantly predictive of\nneurological, behavioral, and personality differences in males, with carriers of a low-activity allele\n1.3. Are The Effects of Poor Nutrition on Verbal Deficits and Psychopathic Traits Conditional?\nWhile studies have detected significant associations between inadequate nutrition, verbal\ndeficits and poor mental health outcomes, a few studies have also suggested that the strength of such\nassociations may be contingent on other factors, such as sex [48] and parenting style [49]. Even so,\nvery few moderators of the link between nutrition, verbal deficits, and mental health outcomes have\nbeen examined. For example, research has almost entirely ignored the possibility that genetic factors\ncould moderate the relationship between nutrition, verbal deficits, and mental health. The few\nstudies that have done so have typically examined neurological disorders associated with elderly\npopulations (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), rather than young adult populations [23,24]. Still, these\nstudies suggest that the influence of nutrition on neurological health is likely contingent on allelic\nvariation on important genetic markers.\nGene-nutrient interactions would be expected to influence neuropsychological and\npsychological outcomes, since essential nutrients as well as several candidate genes (e.g., MAOA,\nDRD2) often have overlapping influences on the synthesis of neurotransmitters in key brain\nstructures. For example, both tryptophan, a dietary precursor to serotonin, as well as 5HHTLPR\ninfluence aggression/impulsivity by altering serotonergic functioning [50,51]. Georgieff [1],\nmoreover, explains how a diet deficient in iron can alter monoamine neurotransmitter synthesis,\nwhich, at a genetic level, is also regulated by allelic variation on several genes [52]. The degree to\nwhich an individual's neuropsychological or behavioral profile is substantially altered by patterns of\nnutritional input may therefore depend on their genotype, particularly on polymorphisms that have\nbeen linked to neuropsychological and behavioral abnormalities, such as MAOA.\n1.4. The Current Study\nIn this study, we explore the possibility that the influence of poor nutrition on verbal deficits\nand psychopathic personality traits among males is conditioned by allelic variation on MAOA.\nResearch has suggested that the effects of MAOA on negative outcomes are moderated by exposure\nto various noxious environments, including maltreatment [29] and maternal stress in utero [53].\nFurthermore, a recent animal experiment [52] suggested that low activity MAOA genotype interacts\nwith exposure to low levels of dietary iron in the womb to predict poorer cognitive functioning\nand maladaptive social behaviors (including aggressive temperament) in offspring. Still, whether\nthe MAOA interacts with nutritional factors to predict verbal abilities and psychopathic personality\ntraits among a human sample remains unknown. The present study extends this line of research\nand utilizes a large sample of youth to examine the direct and interactive effects of adolescent\nnutritional deficiencies and MAOA genotype on verbal deficits and psychopathic personality traits\nduring adulthood.\nSubjects come from the U.S. National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).\nThe Add Health is a prospective, nationally representative study that covers 14\u00ad15 years of\ndevelopment across adolescence and adulthood, making it well-suited to our research question.\nFurthermore, the Add Health also includes a number of participants (approx. 2500) who were asked\nto provide samples of their DNA for genotyping at the third wave of data collection. To be precise,\nbuccal swabs were obtained for each of these participants so that their genetic profile on various\ncandidate genes (e.g., DRD2, DRD4) could be determined [54].\nIn the case of MAOA, which is an X-linked gene, females have two copies of the gene, whereas\nmales only have one copy. Therefore, interactions between MAOA and other risk factors must be\nexamined separately for males and females, due to the distinct genetic profile of males and females on\nthis gene. Much of the research on MAOA to date has linked low activity alleles to various antisocial\nand criminogenic outcomes in males [29,55]. As a result, we follow the lead of prior research using\nthe Add Health [55] and restrict our sample to genotyped males (N = 1357).\nVerbal Deficits. Verbal deficits were measured using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT).\nThe PPVT involves an examiner showing various pages of pictures to the participant, with each page\ncontaining four distinct pictures. The examiner then speaks a word that describes one of the pictures\npresented and asks the subject to identify the picture that corresponds to the spoken word. The PPVT\nhas been found to be a reliable and valid measure of verbal intelligence [56] that highly correlates\nwith other indicators of cognitive ability [57]. For the purposes of our study, we utilized the PPVT\npercentile scores obtained at wave 3 (early adulthood). Furthermore, in order to create a measure\nof deficits in verbal ability, the original PPVT percentile scores were recoded so that a higher score\nreflects relatively poor verbal ability. Table 1 includes the descriptive statistics of the verbal deficits\nmeasure as well as all other variables and scales included in the analysis.\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics for the ADD Health Genotyped Subsample of Males.\nVariable Mean Standard Deviation Range\nPsychopathic Personality Traits. At wave 4, respondents were asked a number of questions\nthat tapped their overall temperament and personality. Following the lead of prior research [58],\nwe employed several of these items, taken from the five factor model of personality, to tap\nimportant dimensions of psychopathy, including lack of sociability, narcissism, low self-control,\nand callous/unemotional traits. We constructed a scale of psychopathic personality traits\nby standardizing and summing 23 relevant items from this personality inventory ( = 0.83).\nItems included questions about the degree to which participants lose their temper, have frequent\nmood swings, have little empathy/sympathy for others, rely on their impulses, and enjoy taking\nrisks. Scores on each of the items ranged from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree).\nUltimately, all of the items included in the index were coded so that higher scores on the index\nreflected a more pronounced tendency toward psychopathic personality traits.\n2.2.2. Nutrition and Genetic Measures\nMeal Deprivation. Elements of nutrition that can impact neuropsychological and mental health\noutcomes include both the sufficiency of food [59] and the quality/combination of foods [2]. For our\nfirst measure, we created an item that taps the extent to which subjects were failing to eat regular\nmeals during adolescence. At the second wave of data collection, subjects were asked three questions\nregarding how frequently they ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner during the past week, with response\noptions ranging from 0 (zero days during the past week) to 7 (seven days during the past week) for\neach of the three items. Scores on each item were reverse coded so that higher scores reflected less\nfrequent consumption of each meal during the previous week. The reverse-coded scores on each of\nthe three items were subsequently summed and divided by the total number of possible meals during\nthe previous week (i.e., 21). Consequently, the meal deprivation item represents the proportion of total\nmeals during the previous week that were skipped, with scores closer to 1 indicating greater meal\ndeprivation. We should note that, while the concept of meal deprivation is similar to the concept\nof food insufficiency, they are not interchangeable. For instance, studies examining malnourished\nchildren define food insufficiency as \"an inadequate amount of food intake due to a lack of money\nor resources\" [59]. The current measure of meal deprivation, however, cannot definitively determine\nthe reason underlying the infrequent eating of regular meals (i.e., whether it was elective or not).\nNonetheless, our measure is an improvement in terms of specificity of change in food intake, as it\ncaptures gradual decreases in regular meal consumption. Prior research on children has generally\nclassified food insufficient households as those that \"sometimes or often do not get enough food to\neat\" [59], which cannot capture the possibility of a dose-response relationship.\nLow Vegetable Consumption. In addition to our measure of meal deprivation, we included two\nmeasures of food quality: low vegetable consumption and high fast food consumption. During wave\n1 of data collection, respondents were asked a small number of questions regarding their eating\nhabits. We followed the lead of prior research [60] and utilized a question about the number of\ntimes the youth ate vegetables during the day prior to the interview. Response options ranged from\n0 (did not eat) to 2 (ate twice or more). In order for our item to reflect low vegetable consumption,\nthis item was reverse-coded so that subjects who reported eating vegetables less frequently received\nhigher scores.\nHigh Fast Food Consumption. A high frequency of fast food consumption has been linked to poorer\nmental and physical health outcomes [61], and thus may be predictive of the outcomes in our study.\nFor our second measure of food quality, we followed the lead of prior research [62] and employed an\nitem from the second wave of data collection that asked about the frequency with which adolescents\nate fast food during the previous week. Examples of fast food were given during the interview,\nsuch as McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, in order to avoid misclassification. Response\noptions for this item ranged from 0 (zero days during the previous week) to 7 (every day during the\nprevious week).\nMonoamine oxidase A (MAOA). As mentioned previously, genetic information on a number of\npolymorphisms was obtained for approximately 2500 subjects at the third wave of data collection.\nAn X-linked gene known as MAOA was one of the polymorphisms examined in the genotyped\nsubsample of the Add Health study. Previous research has linked this gene to various indicators\nof maladjustment in males, including impulsivity [47], violence [29], and gang involvement [28].\nSpecifically, males who possess low activity alleles (i.e., the 2 or 3 repeat allele) incur a greater risk of\ndeveloping these negative traits and behaviors. In light of this body of research, and in line with prior\nresearch using the Add Health [28], MAOA was coded so that males possessing the 2 or 3 repeat allele\nwere assigned a value of 1, whereas males possessing higher repeat alleles (i.e., the 3.5-repeat allele,\nthe 4-repeat allele, or the 5-repeat allele) were assigned a value of 0. As displayed in Table 1, roughly\n43% of the sample possessed a low activity allele, whereas the remainder of the sample possessed a\nhigh activity allele.\n2.3. Adolescent Traits\nLow Self-Control. At the first wave of data collection, participants were asked a number\nof questions tapping their tendency toward impulsivity. An impulsive temperament is more\nlikely in individuals with poor nutrition [63], and has also been found to be closely tied to both\nneuropsychological deficits [64] and psychopathic traits [65]. At wave 1, adolescents were asked a\nnumber of questions regarding their level of self-control, including whether they go with their gut\nfeeling when making a decision, think about the consequences of their decision, gather ample facts\nin order to solve a problem, try to think of alternative solutions to a problem, and analyze what went\nright or wrong after taking a particular course of action. The five items were coded so that higher\nscores reflect lower levels of self-control. An index was then created by standardizing and summing\nthe recoded items ( = 0.66). Importantly, our measure of low self-control is informed by Hirschi's [66]\nrecent conceptualization of low self-control, which he describes as \"the tendency to consider the full\nrange of potential costs [and long-term implications] of a particular act\". Furthermore, the items\nincluded in our scale also reflect the recent findings that suggest a close nexus between executive\ndysfunction, poor decision making, and low self-control [67].\n2.4. Family Socialization, Home Environment and Neighborhood Measures\nFamily Meals. A number of studies have suggested that the frequency of family meals has a\nsignificant influence on adolescent nutrition [68]. It is possible, moreover, that the structure provided\nby family meals may influence adolescent criminogenic outcomes as well [69]. As a result, we\ninclude a measure that taps the frequency of family meals in our study. At wave 1 of data collection,\nadolescents were asked how many days during the past week they ate at least one of their meals with\ntheir parent/parents. Response categories ranged from 0 (no days during the past week) to 7 (every\nday during the past week).\nTV Viewing. We also included a measure of TV viewing, as high levels of TV viewing have been\nassociated with poorer diet [70] as well as antisocial traits and behaviors [71]. At the first wave of\ndata collection, youth were asked to estimate how many hours a week they spent watching television.\nAlthough nine participants reported more than 80 h of television a week, these subjects were coded\nas 80 ha week to maintain a more reasonable range of values (80 h a week would require an average\nof more than 11 hours a day of TV viewing).\nVideo Games. In addition to television viewing, a measurement of the frequency of video game\nparticipation was included. Recent research has shown that playing video games, along with other\nsedentary behaviors, is associated with a poorer diet [72]. Some research has also suggested that\nfrequent video game participation is associated with antisocial tendencies [73]. Consequently, we\ninclude a measure of video game participation in our study which taps the number of hours spent\nplaying video games in the past week. Scores on this item range from 0 to 60, with higher numbers\nreflecting greater exposure to video games.\nNeighborhood Disadvantage. We also create a measure of neighborhood disadvantage using six\nitems [74]. At wave 1, youths were asked whether they were happy in their neighborhood, whether\nthey knew most of their neighbors, whether they felt safe in their neighborhood and whether they\nwanted to move. Items were recoded to reflect greater displeasure with (and concern about) the\nneighborhood. Subsequently, items were standardized and summed to construct the index ( = 0.66).\nLow Maternal Attachment. We also followed the lead of prior research [75] and constructed an\nindex of maternal attachment at wave 1. Respondents were asked how close they felt to their mother\nand how much they thought their mother cared about them, with responses ranging from 1 (not very\nclose/much) to 5 (very close/much). Items were coded so that higher scores were indicative of lower\nmaternal attachment. The index was created by standardizing and summing the items ( = 0.67).\nMaternal Disengagement. In line with prior research [74], we created an index designed to tap\nthe extent to which the subject's mother was disconnected from her child's life. At wave 1, youth\nwere asked whether they were satisfied with their relationship with their mother and with the way\nshe communicates with them, whether their mother is warm or loving toward them, and whether\nshe calmly corrects their mistakes and misbehaviors. Responses to the items were standardized and\nadded together to create an index in which higher scores indicate more maternal disengagement\nLow Maternal Involvement. We also developed an item assessing low maternal involvement.\nAt wave 1, adolescents were asked if they had engaged in a number of activities with their\nmother during the past four weeks, including playing a sport, attending church, shopping, going\nto a movie or special event, and talking about school or a personal problem. Adolescents who\nreported participating in none of the activities with their mother were assigned a value of 1, whereas\nadolescents who reported participating in at least one of these activities with their mother were\nassigned a value of 0.\nLow Maternal Supervision. Finally, a measure of maternal supervision was created by using\nthree items provided at wave 1 [76]. Participants were asked if their mother is typically home\nwhen they leave for school in the morning, arrive home from school, and go to bed. Subjects who\nresponded \"almost never\" or \"never\" were assigned a value of 1 on each of the three variables;\notherwise, they were coded as a 0. The recoded items were then added together so that subjects\nwhose mothers provided the lowest amount of supervision scored the highest on this variable (final\nrange of responses: 0\u00ad3).\nAge. We also included a continuous variable in the analysis measuring the age of each respondent\n(in years) at wave 1.\nRace. A measure of race (1 = nonwhite; 0 = white) was also included in the analysis in an attempt\nto rule out any confounding due to racial differences of the subjects.\nLow SES. Low SES was measured using four items that asked caregivers about the whether\nthey had received various forms of financial assistance at wave 1 [76]. To be precise, caregivers\nreported whether they had received food stamps, unemployment compensation, Aid to Families with\nDependent Children, or public housing/housing subsidy within the month prior to data collection.\nCaregivers who reported having received any assistance within the previous month were assigned a\nvalue of 1, whereas caregivers who reported receiving no assistance were assigned a value of 0.\n2.6. Plan of Analysis\nOrdinary least squares (OLS) regression is used to test our hypotheses. Because our final sample\nincluded sibling pairs, standard errors may be deflated due to case non-independence. We followed\nthe lead of prior research [77] and estimated Huber/White standard errors to account for the\nclustering of cases by family. Our analysis proceeds as follows. First, we examine whether indicators\nof poor food quality and meal deprivation during adolescence were significantly predictive of verbal\ndeficits during early adulthood, net of controls. Second, we test whether these same indicators of poor\nnutrition are predictive of psychopathic personality traits during adulthood. Most importantly, we\nestimate six regression equations exploring whether statistical interactions between MAOA genotype\nand our three indicators of poor nutrition (i.e., meal deprivation, low vegetable consumption,\nhigh fast food consumption) are predictive of verbal deficits and psychopathic personality traits\namong males. Moderating effects were examined using multiplicative interaction terms between\nthe nutritional factors and MAOA. Covariates were mean-centered prior to creating the interaction\n3. Results\nTables 2 and 3 display the results of eight regression equations that estimate a) whether poorer\nnutrition during adolescence significantly increases the likelihood of verbal deficits and psychopathic\npersonality traits during adulthood and b) whether MAOA moderates the association between\nindicators of poor nutrition and these outcomes.\nTable 2.

We should note that, although meal deprivation significantly predicted both of these\noutcomes, the effect of meal deprivation on psychopathic personality traits was particularly sizeable\n( = 0.17, the largest beta in the model). Nevertheless, despite the relevance of meal deprivation to\nthe development of psychopathic personality traits, indicators of poor food quality had no significant\ndirect influence on such traits. In the case of verbal deficits, however, food quality appeared to be\nmore relevant. Specifically, low vegetable consumption during adolescence significantly increased\nthe likelihood of verbal deficits during early adulthood ( = 0.16), although the effects of fast\nfood consumption were null. The significant effect of low vegetable consumption is all the more\nnoteworthy considering that none of the neighborhood or family socialization measures emerged\nas significant predictors of verbal deficits (see Model 1 of Table 2). We now turn to the results of\nour interactive models. Models 2 through 4 of Table 2 contain the results of 3 regression equations\nthat examined whether each nutritional measure (i.e., meal deprivation, low vegetable consumption,\nand high fast food consumption) interacted with the low-activity MAOA genotype to predict verbal\ndeficits during early adulthood. Two of the three interactions emerged as positive and significant.\nIn particular, the results suggest that subjects who consumed fewer vegetables and more fast food\nduring their adolescent years were especially likely to exhibit verbal deficits during early adulthood\nif they also possessed a activity MAOA genotype (see Figures 1 and 2). No significant interactions\nbetween meal deprivation and MAOA emerged, however, in the prediction of verbal deficits.\nTable 3.

Although not identical to the results in Table 2,\nthe findings reiterate the relevance of food quality for the neuropsychological and mental health of males\nwith a high-risk genotype on MAOA. Specifically, the significant, positive interaction shown in Model 4\nof Table 3 indicates that participants who consumed a greater amount of fast food during their youth\nwere at significantly higher risk of developing psychopathic personality traits by adulthood, but only if\nthey possessed a high-risk allele on MAOA (see Figure 3;  = 0.15). Neither MAOA nor fast food\nconsumption had significant, independent effects on psychopathic traits, but when examined\ninteractively, they add to the predictive value of the model (R2 increased 25% with the inclusion of the\ninteraction term).

Discussion\nInadequate nutrition has been shown to predict a host of negative life outcomes, whether physical [25],\npsychological [35,36], or neuropsychological [3,4]. Empirical examinations of the role of dietary choices\nduring adolescence in predicting neuropsychological and mental health outcomes during adulthood,\nhowever, are lacking in comparison to studies on childhood nutrition (except see [79]). Furthermore,\nresearch on neuropsychological and mental health outcomes often fails to explore how the influence of\nnutritional factors might vary as a function of allelic variation on key genetic markers\n(e.g., MAOA) (except see [23,24]). The primary aim of the present study was to address these gaps in\nthe literature by testing whether features of adolescent nutrition are significant predictors of verbal\ndeficits and psychopathic personality traits during early adulthood, and whether these relationships\nmight be moderated by MAOA. Analysis of the Add Health data revealed three key findings.\nFirst, the results revealed that both meal deprivation and low vegetable consumption during\nadolescence significantly increased the likelihood of verbal deficits during adulthood, whereas only meal\ndeprivation significantly increased the likelihood of psychopathic personality traits. The findings are\ngenerally consistent with the research to date on the potentially deleterious effects of poor nutrition on\nneuropsychological functioning, even during later life stages [16]. However, the absence of any significant\ndirect effect of poor food quality on psychopathic personality traits is somewhat unexpected considering diet\nquality has been linked to both violence [20] and negative mental health outcomes [35,36]. Still, our results,\nas a whole, highlight the role of both inadequate and poor quality nutrition in subsequent\nneuropsychological and psychological functioning.\nSecond, we found evidence that a poor quality diet during adolescence is especially detrimental to\nthe adult verbal ability of individuals who possess a low activity allele on MAOA. To be precise, subjects\nPsychopathic Personality Traits\n(Standardized)\nFast Food Consumption (Days per Week)\nLow MAOA Activity\nHigh MAOA Activity\nFigure 3.

Discussion\nInadequate nutrition has been shown to predict a host of negative life outcomes, whether\nphysical [25], psychological [35,36], or neuropsychological [3,4]. Empirical examinations of the role\nof dietary choices during adolescence in predicting neuropsychological and mental health outcomes\nduring adulthood, however, are lacking in comparison to studies on childhood nutrition (except\nsee [79]). Furthermore, research on neuropsychological and mental health outcomes often fails to\nexplore how the influence of nutritional factors might vary as a function of allelic variation on key\ngenetic markers (e.g., MAOA) (except see [23,24]). The primary aim of the present study was to\naddress these gaps in the literature by testing whether features of adolescent nutrition are significant\npredictors of verbal deficits and psychopathic personality traits during early adulthood, and whether\nthese relationships might be moderated by MAOA. Analysis of the Add Health data revealed three\nkey findings.\nFirst, the results revealed that both meal deprivation and low vegetable consumption during\nadolescence significantly increased the likelihood of verbal deficits during adulthood, whereas\nonly meal deprivation significantly increased the likelihood of psychopathic personality traits.\nThe findings are generally consistent with the research to date on the potentially deleterious effects\nof poor nutrition on neuropsychological functioning, even during later life stages [16]. However, the\nabsence of any significant direct effect of poor food quality on psychopathic personality traits is\nsomewhat unexpected considering diet quality has been linked to both violence [20] and negative\nmental health outcomes [35,36]. Still, our results, as a whole, highlight the role of both inadequate\nand poor quality nutrition in subsequent neuropsychological and psychological functioning.\nSecond, we found evidence that a poor quality diet during adolescence is especially detrimental\nto the adult verbal ability of individuals who possess a low activity allele on MAOA. To be\nprecise, subjects who reported eating vegetables less frequently and fast food more frequently were\nparticularly prone to verbal deficits in early adulthood if they carried the 2 or 3 repeat allele on\nMAOA. This finding speaks to the potential relevance of genetic factors in moderating the effects\nof poor quality nutrition on neuropsychological outcomes [52]. Our third and final finding is similar\nto the second. We found that psychopathic personality traits were significantly more likely among\nadult subjects who ate fast food more frequently during their youth, but only if they also possessed a\nlow activity MAOA allele. The effect of high fast food consumption on subsequent psychopathic\npersonality traits, therefore, only emerged once genotyped was considered and included as a\nmoderator in the study.\n5. Conclusions\nWhile our study makes an important contribution to the literature, it is not without its\nlimitations. First, it would have been useful to also test hypotheses using measures that tap specific\nnutrients (e.g., omega 3 fatty acids, iron), but such measures were not available in the data. Some of\nthe recent literature utilizes very precise measures of nutrient intake and metabolization, such as\nomega 3 blood levels [34] and iron deficiency in utero [52]. Nevertheless, more generalized measures\nof poor diet are useful in highlighting the specific dietary changes that can be made on a daily basis to\nimprove subsequent neuropsychological and mental health [6,9,19]. On a related note, it would have\nbeen preferable to have a greater number of diet items and more thorough measurements of diet\n(e.g., food journals/records). Second, a wider array of neuropsychological tests and diagnostic tools\n(e.g., fMRI) would have been preferable to test the robustness of our results. We were only able to\nmeasure impaired verbal ability and thus cannot directly assess the relevance of the results for other\ncognitive functions. Still, our verbal deficits models likely yield conservative tests of the influence\nof nutrition on neuropsychological functions, as other brain regions that are less relevant to verbal\nability specifically may also be impacted by poor nutrition. Finally, the generalizability of our study\nis restricted due to the inclusion of a number of sibling pairs in our final sample. Nevertheless, recent\nresearch suggests that the findings of studies that examine samples of sibling pairs may be more\ngeneralizable to the broader non-sibling population than originally assumed [80].\nIn conclusion, poor dietary habits during youth appear to place individuals at risk of both\nverbal deficits and psychopathic personality traits during adulthood, particularly for those with a\nhigh-risk genotype on MAOA. Future research should seek to replicate and build upon the findings\nof our study by employing additional samples, more diversified and more thorough measures of\nnutrition, a broader array of candidate genes, and other measures of neuropsychological functioning.\nAdditionally, research in this area should explore the relevance of nutrient-gene interactions in\nthe prediction of outcomes associated with verbal deficits and/or psychopathic personality traits,\nincluding violence, offending, and criminal justice involvement. Doing so will elucidate ways in\nwhich families, school administrators, and other practitioners can intervene in order to improve the\nlife outcomes of at-risk youth.\n"
