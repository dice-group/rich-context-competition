The\nauthors of that 2013 paper now defend their estimate and this is our rejoinder to their reply which, it is contended here,\navoids the central points, addresses only secondary issues and makes ad hominem attacks.

(2018), the reply paper to Spagat and van\nWeezel (2017) which is, in turn, our critique of Hagopian\net al. (2013), does not address either of our two central\npoints. These are as follows (Spagat and van Weezel, 2017).\nFirst, any appropriate 95% uncertainty interval (UI) for non-\nstarts many tens of thousands of deaths below zero. Second,\nwe find no local spill over effects running from violence\nlevels to elevated non-violent death rates.1 Both these results\nrefute the `conservative' estimate of several hundred thou-\nsand non-violent excess deaths given in Hagopian et al.\npoints suggests that the authors of that paper are unable to\nrespond.\nThe very long reply paper (Hagopian et al., 2018) focuses\nexclusively on secondary points and ad hominem attacks.\nWe address below as many secondary points as possible,\nsubject to space constraints, while relegating further\nresponses to Michael Spagat's blog (https://mikespagat.\nwordpress.com/).2 We follow the organization of Hagopian\net al. (2018), quoting their numbered points below.\n`1. Conflating violent deaths with non-violent deaths in\nmaking excess-death calculations'\nWe agree with Hagopian et al. (2018) that the human costs\nof war go well beyond just deaths. However, we do not\nconsider that this observation provides a licence to exag-\ngerate the number of deaths in war. We also agree that war\nviolence in Iraq has probably led indirectly to some non-\nviolent deaths. However, we maintain that the small sample\nfrom the University Collaborative Iraq Mortality Study\n(UCIMS) is inadequate with regard to shedding much light\non such deaths.\nThe authors profess confusion over our observation that\nthey conflate violent deaths with non-violent ones, so we\nclarify this point in the next paragraph.\nWe do not argue that Hagopian et al. (2013) conflate vio-\nlent deaths with non-violent deaths always and everywhere.\nIn fact, our own estimates rely on the fact that the UCIMS\ndataset distinguishes between violent deaths and non-vio-\nlent deaths. We also insist that any meaningful attempt to\nunderstand the extent to which violence may cause non-\nviolent deaths must maintain separate accounts for the two\ntypes of deaths as a prerequisite for analysing the relation-\nship between the two. Hagopian et al. (2013), however, mix\nviolent deaths interchangeably with non-violent deaths at\nthe core of their analysis. Indeed, this conflation is embed-\nded in the very definition of an excess death rate: the rate of\nviolent plus non-violent deaths during a war minus the rate\nTerms and conditions still apply: A\nrejoinder to Hagopian et al.\nMichael Spagat1 and Stijn van Weezel2\n Keywords\nBootstrapping, differences-in-differences, excess deaths, household survey data, Iraq\n1Department of Economics, Royal Holloway University of London, UK\n2School of Economics, University College Dublin, Ireland\nCorresponding author:\nMichael Spagat, Department of Economics, Royal Holloway University of\nLondon, Egham, Surrey TW20 0EX, UK.\nEmail: m.spagat@rhul.ac.uk\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \nof violent plus nonviolent deaths before a war. The gargan-\n751,000 excess deaths (violent plus non-violent), is dragged\ndeaths. Strip away this confounding element and the UI for\nflimsy basis for confident claims of hundreds of thousands\nof non-violent deaths caused by the Iraq war.\n`2. Incorrectly ignoring the impact of stratification'and\nFailing to use correct statistical technique'\ncombined\nWe have now digested the Galway et al. (2012) paper and\nrealize that the UCIMS sample was not conceived to be a\nstratified one. Specifically, the number of clusters in each\ngovernorate was not fixed in advance at the numbers given\nin Table 1 of Hagopian et al. (2013) as much of our analysis\nassumed. This is a point worth noting; however, for two\nreasons set out in the next two paragraphs, it does not affect\nour conclusions.\nFirst, our Table A2 (Spagat and van Weezel, 2017) pro-\nvides estimates both with and without stratification adjust-\nments. In particular, columns 1, 5, 7 and 9 of Table A2 all\nhave no stratification adjustment, yet each of these uncer-\ntainty intervals for non-violent excess deaths is more than\nbelow zero. Moreover, our differences-in-differences esti-\nmates, which Hagopian et al. (2018) ignore, do not use strati-\nfication adjustments.\nSecond, there is a good case for applying a stratifica-\ntion adjustment even though the UCIMS sampling\nmethod would not necessitate one in a large enough sam-\nple. The UCIMS sampled only 100 clusters and the real-\nized vector of clusters per governorate diverges\nsubstantially from population proportions in many gover-\nnorates. Indeed, the implied relative weights, which we\nprovide in our Table 1, range from 0.50 all the way up to\n2.75. Although these relative weights should theoreti-\ncally approach 1.0 in a large sample, they can and do turn\nout highly imbalanced in a 100-cluster sample. Thus it\ncan make sense to stratify the UCIMS sample anyway, as\none might do if sampling a population known to be half\nfemale after drawing a sample that turns out to contain\n`4. Not discounting deaths when a certificate was not\navailable'\nOur two main points, stated above in our first paragraph,\nare valid even if we accept all reported deaths regardless of\ndeath certificate confirmation. In fact, our differences-\nin-differences analysis assumes that all reported deaths are\nreal. Nevertheless, death certificates are still worth discuss-\ning, and so we do so briefly.\nWe never claimed that reported deaths without death\ncertificates should simply be ignored. We argued only that\ndeath certificate status should play some role in mortality\nestimation. Hagopian et al. (2018) themselves state that\n`Because most households in Iraq secure a death certifi-\ncate at the time of death, we added this additional con-\nfirmatory step'. We then have to ask, what is the point of\nhaving a `confirmatory step' if we are to consider all\nreported deaths as 100% confirmed regardless of whether\nor not they clear this confirmatory hurdle? We do not pro-\npose a unique discount rate for reported deaths not con-\nfirmed by death certificates but, rather, offer a range of\nestimates based on different treatments of the death cer-\ntificate data the authors themselves collected but then\nignore in their estimation.\nThe only argument Hagopian et al. (2018) make for\naccepting in full all reported deaths is that much of the lit-\nerature does so; however, the correctness of this fully\naccepting approach is a non-validated assumption, not an\nestablished fact. It is na\u00efve to assume that interviewees\ninvariably give truthful responses to their interviewers, par-\nticularly in conflict zones (Fujii, 2010).\n`5. Overestimating the effects of migration on sup-\npressing mortality'\nHere we expand on the brief paragraph in Spagat and van\nment of refugees to inflate their excess deaths estimate\n(a) First, the UCIMS is already a good survey with\nan open dataset. Why contaminate this work with\na `back-of-an-envelope' calculation based on\nclosed data from another survey designed for\nother purposes? This manoeuvre foists what is, at\nbest, an educated guess on top of a data-based\nestimate.\n(b) This guesstimated death rate, presented without a UI,\nbarely exceeds the UCIMS-based estimated pre-war\ndeath rate and is lower than the UCIMS-based esti-\nmated during-war death rate. It is not clear, therefore,\nthat accounting for refugees should even have much\nof an effect on an excess deaths estimate in the first\nplace.\n(c) The Hagopian et al. (2013) (UCIMS-based) excess\ndeath estimate necessarily relies on official popula-\ntion projections. This is because estimated excess\nmortality rates must be multiplied by population\nnumbers to arrive at an excess-death number.\nHowever, the annual population numbers that\nHagopian et al. (2013) use increase mechanically at\na rate of about 2.9% per year with no sign of deduc-\ntions to account for an exodus of two million refu-\ngees. Thus, in effect, the UCIMS-based excess\nSpagat and Van Weezel 3\ndeath estimate already covers refugees. Any migra-\ntion adjustment can therefore only be based on the\ndifference between an estimated (and poorly meas-\nured, according to the argument in point a) excess\ndeath rate for the refugee population and an esti-\nmated excess death rate for the UCIMS population.\nPoint b implies that such a difference would be\nnegative, which suggests that accounting for ref-\nuges should probably reduce, rather than increase,\n(d) Nevertheless, we recognize the point of Hagopian\nof 56,000 is meant to be for violent deaths. These\ncould all potentially be viewed as excess since there\nwas little violence before the war. However,\nHagopian et al. (2013) offer no information on non-\nviolent death rates for refugees, and these may well\nbe lower than the UCIMS-measured rates; if so, this\nwould necessitate a reduction in an excess-death\nestimate (point (c)). Overall, it is bad practice to\ncobble together UCIMS-based excess deaths with\npoorly measured and documented refugee violent\ndeaths while omitting information on refugee non-\nviolent deaths that are a necessary part of any stand-\nard excess-deaths calculation.\ncharacterized as `conservative'. Hagopian et al.\n(2018) excuse this inflationary rounding as neces-\nsary to avoid conveying a false sense of precision.\nHowever, Hagopian et al. (2013) repeatedly round\nestimates to the nearest 1000.3 After routinely round-\ning to the nearest 1000, then having suddenly\nclaimed that even rounding to the nearest 10,000 is\ntoo precise, Hagopian et al. (2013) round to the near-\npresented as `conservative' \u00ad largely because,\naccording to the authors, the refugee adjustment of\nTo summarize, Hagopian et al. (2018) do not address our\nmain points set out in paragraph one above. Nevertheless,\nwe address some secondary points in our rejoinder and\nrefer readers to Michael Spagat's blog for more.\n"
