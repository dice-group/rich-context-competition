Stoddard, MD\nMany of the difficulties in present medical practice can be overcome, wholly or in part, by group organization. . . . Some of these\ndifficulties are: lack of coordination . . . lack of adequate supervision and control over the quality of medical care . . . the difficulty\nexperienced by patients in choosing qualified physicians; the unnecessarily large expenditure for overhead costs made by practitioners\nin individual private practice; and the increasing complexity of medical service.\nCommittee on the Costs of Medical Care1\nBackground: For decades, reformers argued that medi-\ncal groups can efficiently provide high-quality care and\na collegial professional environment. The growth of man-\naged care and the movement to improve quality provide\nadditional reasons for physicians to practice in groups,\nespecially large groups. However, information is lack-\ning on recent trends in group size and the benefits of and\nbarriers to group practice.\nObjectives: To identify benefits of and barriers to large\nmedical group practice, and to describe recent trends in\ngroup size.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants: Information on\nbenefits and barriers was obtained from 195 interviews\nnity Tracking Study with leaders of the largest groups,\nhospitals, and health insurance plans in 12 randomly se-\nlected metropolitan areas. Information on recent trends\nin group size was obtained from more than 6000 physi-\ncians in private practice in 48 randomly selected metro-\npolitan areas via Community Tracking Study telephone\nMain Outcome Measures: Benefits of and barriers to\nlarge group practice, as perceived by interviewees, and\nchanges in percentages of physicians in groups of vary-\ning sizes.\nResults: Gaining negotiating leverage with health in-\nsurance plans was the most frequently cited benefit; it\nwas cited 8 times more often than improving quality. Lack\nof physician cooperation, investment, and leadership were\nthe most frequently cited barriers. Survey data indicate\nthat 47% of private physicians work in practices of 1 or\n2 physicians and 82% in practices of 9 or fewer, and that\nthe percentage of physicians in groups of 20 or more did\nConclusions: Current payment methods reward gain-\ning size to obtain negotiating leverage more than they re-\nward quality. However, barriers to creating large medi-\ncal groups are substantial, and most private physicians\ncontinue to practice in small groups, although the size\nof these groups is slowly increasing.\nDURING THE 7decadessince\nport,medicalreformers--\nincluding physician\nleaders in groups like the\nMayo Clinic,2 Palo Alto Medical Clinic,3\nScripps Clinic,4 and Permanente Medical\nGroup (Kaiser)5--have argued that group\npractice, especially large multispecialty\ngroup practice, can improve the quality of\nhealth care, decrease costs, and provide\na professionally desirable working envi-\nAs medical care has become increasingly\ncomplex and expensive, and as awareness\nof medical errors12 and the possibilities\nfor using organized processes to improve\nquality have grown,13 the problems iden-\ntified by the committee have become\nmore salient than ever.

Also,\nit is unknown whether the prevalence of large medical\ngroups has increased since 1996 in response to man-\naged care. We present, to our knowledge, the first na-\ntionally representative data on the benefits of and barri-\ners to large medical group practice and on recent trends\nin the prevalence of groups of different sizes.\nMETHODS\nWe used information from the site visit and survey components\nof the Community Tracking Study (CTS).37,38\nSince 1996, the CTS has conducted 3 rounds of site vis-\nlected US metropolitan areas. We focus on 195 interviews con-\nof the 3 or 4 largest physician groups, hospitals, and health plans\nin each area. Interviewees included medical directors, chief\nexecutive and operating officers, and executives responsible\nfor contracting and network formation. These interviewees\nwere well positioned to know what was happening with\ngroups in their area and had differing perspectives from which\nto offer perceptions of the benefits of and barriers to group\npractice.\nInterviews were conducted by 19 interviewers organized\ninto 4 teams. Each team visited 3 metropolitan areas. Inter-\nviewers included university faculty and CTS researchers who\nfrequently worked in pairs to facilitate note taking. Interviews\nlasted 60 to 90 minutes and were based on protocols that in-\ncluded open-ended questions followed by specific probes. Af-\nter each interview, interviewers compared notes; the lead in-\nterviewer then typed the notes, which were entered into the\nqualitative analysis software program Atlas.ti.39,40\nWe defined medical groups as 3 or more physicians for-\nmally organized as a legal entity in which business, clinical, and\nadministrative facilities are shared.41 We explained to inter-\nviewees that we were primarily interested in large medical\ngroups. Since no standard definition of such groups exists, we\nasked interviewees to indicate what size they considered such\ngroups to be. Most considered multispecialty groups of ap-\nproximately 10 to 20 physicians to be of moderate size and those\nof greater than 20 to be large; somewhat smaller numbers were\ngiven for single-specialty groups.\nWe chose a qualitative study design to explore the ben-\nefits of and barriers to group practice for 3 reasons. First, little\nis known about this subject. Qualitative research is particu-\nlarly useful for developing an understanding of new subjects\nand for generating hypotheses.42-44 Second, many of the fac-\ntors that may affect medical groups (eg, managed care) are chang-\ning rapidly, making the perceptions of experienced leaders \"on\nthe ground\" essential for understanding what is happening.\nThird, many factors (eg, the role of physician leadership in group\npractice) may be multifaceted, difficult to quantify, and best\nunderstood within the historical and organizational context that\ninterviews can provide.45\nWe obtained data on the percentage of physicians in groups\nof varying sizes from 3 biannual telephone surveys conducted\nterviews with a nationally representative sample of greater than\n12000 nonfederal patient care physicians. Response rates ranged\nfrom 60% to 65%. In this analysis, we limited the sample to\nthe approximately 6000 physicians in each round who were\nin private practice and situated in 48 randomly selected met-\nropolitan areas with a population of at least 200000. Physi-\ncians employed by hospitals, health maintenance organiza-\ntions (HMOs), academic medical centers, or governments were\nexcluded. The 48 areas include the 12 in which site-visit in-\nterviews on barriers and benefits were conducted; results of the\nanalysis did not differ between the 48 and 12 sites.\nDuring and after the visit to each area, the site team met to dis-\ncuss the issues identified. The team leader then wrote a de-\ntailed summary, and other members wrote reports on the fol-\nlowing 4 subject areas: physicians and hospitals, health plans,\nemployers, and the policy environment. Reports were re-\nviewed by team members and revised. All 4 teams met peri-\nodically to discuss findings across the 12 metropolitan areas.\nTeams used triangulation, a qualitative analysis technique based\non the assumption that the credibility of results is increased if\nmultiple interviewees from competing organizations--in this\ncase, physician groups, health plans, and hospitals--present\nwhat multiple interviewers with varying beliefs and back-\ngrounds record as consistent accounts.50,51 The longitudinal,\nlarge-scale, nationally representative design of the CTS pro-\nvides a strong opportunity for triangulation.\nRound 3 protocols included questions about change over\ntime. We used responses to these questions and information\ngathered during the first 2 rounds of the CTS to understand\ninterviewees' perceptions of trends in group formation. In ad-\ndition, we searched the Atlas.ti database to produce counts of\nthe number of times specific benefits of and barriers to group\npractice were stated by interviewees. This database includes\nTable 1.

Since nearly\nall comments about benefits and barriers were given in re-\nsponse to general questions rather than specific probes, we com-\nbined both types of response. Since interviewees rarely stated\nthat a particular benefit or barrier was not important, we re-\nport only the number of positive responses.\nPhysicians in the survey reported on the number of phy-\nsicians in their practice and were divided into 6 practice size\ncategories for this analysis. All survey estimates were\nweighted to be representative of nonfederal physicians pro-\nviding patient care in metropolitan areas with at least 200000\npeople; the weights account for the sample design and survey\nnonresponse. Two-tailed z tests were performed to determine\nwhether statistically significant change occurred between\nrounds.\nRESULTS\ninterviewees in all 12 areas expected both enrollment in\nHMOs with relatively narrow physician networks and risk\ncontracting to increase. They anticipated that physi-\ncians would create primary care\u00adbased, multispecialty\nmedical groups large enough to gain negotiating lever-\nage with HMOs and to spread the financial risk of risk\nruary 1999), it was becoming apparent that HMOs and\nrisk contracting were not growing as anticipated and that\nmany groups were experiencing financial problems.52\nto create large multispecialty groups had ceased at all 12\nsites, as groups' continued financial problems plus the\ngrowing backlash against managed care led HMOs to pull\nback from narrow provider networks and risk contract-\ning.53 Many interviewees stated, however, that single-\nspecialty groups, mainly in the range of 5 to 20 physi-\ncians, were growing. For organizations engaging in risk\ncontracting, specialists are cost centers, to be used as little\nas possible, but in a fee-for-service environment they be-\ncome major sources of revenue, particularly if they work\nin well-reimbursed procedural specialties like orthope-\ndics and cardiology.54 Furthermore, interviewees be-\nlieved that relatively small single-specialty groups can gain\nnegotiating leverage with health plans while avoiding the\ncoordination problems and conflicts between primary care\nand specialties in multispecialty groups. This was em-\nphasized by the chief executive officer of a multispe-\ncialty group in Boston, Mass, who stated, \"Specialists\nshould ask themselves 1, 2, 3 times why they would join\na multispecialty group when they can reap more ben-\nefits from a single-specialty group.\"\nConsistent with interviewee perceptions about large\ngroups, the survey data suggest that the percentage of phy-\npractitioners increased slightly between rounds 1 and 2,\nbut decreased slightly between rounds 2 and 3. Although\nonly the increased number of physicians in groups of 20\nto 49 between rounds 1 and 2 was statistically significant,\nthe pattern across all 3 rounds, in all 3 large-group cat-\negories, is consistent with interviewee perceptions\n(Table 2). In addition, the survey data indicate that many\nphysicians--47.0% in round 3--continue to practice solo\nor with one other physician, but that this percentage de-\ncreased significantly from 54.0% in round 1, whereas the\nInterviewees most frequently identified 6 benefits of and\n7 barriers to group practice. Table 3 and Table 4, which\nshow the frequency with which each benefit and barrier\nwere cited by the 3 types of interviewee, should be read\nwith care. Because the interview protocols for physician\ngroup interviewees focused more attention on groups than\ndid the protocols for health insurance plan or hospital\ninterviewees, the latter discussed benefits of and barri-\ners to group practice less often. Therefore, interpreta-\ntion of the results in the columns of these tables should\nbe based on the rank order, rather than the overall preva-\nlence, of responses. So Table 3, for example, should be\nread as indicating that interviewees from groups, health\nplans, and hospitals all cited gaining leverage with health\nplans far more frequently than any other benefit, rather\nthan as indicating that interviewees from groups consid-\nered this more important than interviewees from health\nplans or hospitals.\nGaining economies of scale, especially in purchas-\ning, management, and information systems, was the sec-\nond most frequently cited benefit. Although many inter-\nviewees were aware of studies from the era before managed\ncare that suggested that groups achieved maximum scale\nYear\nNo. of Physicians in Practice\n*Data are derived from rounds 1 to 3 (1996-2001) of the Physician Survey of the Community Tracking Study and expressed as percentage of physicians in\nprivate practice in metropolitan areas by the size of the practice. Physicians practiced in metropolitan areas with greater than 200 000 population. Private practice\nrefers to physicians in solo, 2-physician, or group practices and excludes those employed by hospitals, health maintenance organizations, academic medical\ncenters, or governments.

As a specialty group administra-\ntor in Syracuse, NY, stated, \"You just can't be a mom-\nand-pop corner store anymore in medicine. There are too\nmany administrative issues to deal with; you need qual-\nity administrative staff that only a large group can pro-\nvide.\"\nGaining leverage with hospitals was the third most\nfrequently cited benefit. Hospital interviewees in par-\nticular focused on this and on the related, fourth most\nfrequently cited benefit, ie, the potential of groups, es-\npecially single specialty groups, to profit from ancillary\nservices, particularly by operating outpatient diagnostic\nand surgery centers in competition or as joint ventures\nwith hospitals.\nLifestyle (eg, collegiality and call and vacation cov-\nerage) was the next most frequently cited benefit. Im-\nproving quality was cited least frequently, at 8 times less\noften than gaining leverage with health plans. Physician\ngroup interviewees mentioned quality more often than\nplan or hospital interviewees, but far less often than they\nmentioned any other reason for forming groups. Many\ninterviewees criticized groups for their lack of emphasis\non quality. A health plan chief executive officer in Indi-\nana argued that \"Groups have worked in terms of nego-\ntiating leverage, but most have not done much for qual-\nity--nor have they been expected to by their constituent\nphysicians.\" An Indiana plan medical director, a strong\nproponent of the potential of groups, stated, \"I'm disap-\npointed that the movement toward groups has not been\naccompanied by an emphasis on care management and\nquality. They are just interested in economics.\" Inter-\nviewees such as a hospital executive in Phoenix, Ariz, fre-\nquently pointed out, however, that rewards for groups\nfor improving quality are scarce: \"The benefits of coor-\ndinated care are not sufficiently appreciated or valued in\nthe market.\"\nPhysicians' desire for autonomy and difficulty in co-\noperating with each other was the most frequently cited\nbarrier to groups (Table 4). A group medical director in\nMiami, Fla, explained, \"Physicians are trained to make\nindependent decisions in the middle of the night. It's hard\nto get them to work together.\" Lack of capital and infor-\nmation systems and the reluctance of physicians to in-\nvest in their group was next most frequently cited, and\nwas the most frequently cited barrier by hospital execu-\ntives, as a Cleveland, Ohio, hospital executive for phy-\nsician integration stated, \"Physicians don't invest in their\npractices to make them successful in the long run--\ninstead, they just take all the money out.\"\nLack of physician leadership was the third most fre-\nquently cited barrier. Interviewees attributed this lack to\na paucity of physicians with management skills and to\nphysicians' reluctance to reward leaders who put time into\ncreating a group and/or helping it operate efficiently. \"The\nlack of physician leadership is a problem,\" stated a group\nmedical director in Phoenix, and \"It's difficult to find\nsomeone willing to step up to the plate and put in un-\ncompensated time.\" \"Physicians don't think that admin-\nistrative work is worth much,\" said another group medi-\ncal director in Phoenix; the physician founder of a group\nin Miami stated that \"It's impossible to deal with doc-\nTable 3.

I did so much for free, and all I got for it was a lot\nof flack.\"\nThe failure of groups to manage the costs of care for\ncapitated patients and the added cost generated by regu-\nlatory mandates such as laws defining minimum hospi-\ntal lengths of stay for obstetric patients were also cited\nas barriers. Health plan interviewees focused on the dif-\nficulties groups had managing the costs of care, whereas\ngroup interviewees, particularly in California, where\nshared risk contracting and regulatory mandates are very\nprevalent,58 focused on mandates. Fourteen of the 26 in-\nterviewees who cited this as a barrier were from Orange\nCounty, California; of these, 9 were from physician groups\n(data not shown).\nNews of financial difficulties of other groups, lo-\ncally and nationally, and problems with conflict be-\ntween primary care physicians and specialists about in-\ncome distribution were also cited as barriers.\nTriangulation of interviewee perceptions was quite\nstrong. First, the rank order of interviewees' percep-\ntions of benefits and barriers was consistent across in-\nterviewee type, with the exceptions noted above. Sec-\nond, the rank order of perceptions of benefits and barriers\nwas also consistent across metropolitan areas, with the\nfollowing exception (data not shown): As described, Or-\nange County interviewees were more likely to mention\nregulatory mandates, the costs of taking capitation for\nservices (notably pharmaceuticals) not being ad-\nequately under physician control, and the low health in-\nsurance premiums and correspondingly low capitation\nrates paid to groups in California. Third, perceptions were\ngenerally consistent between interviewees in the 4 met-\nropolitan areas (Indianapolis, Ind; Seattle, Wash; Cleve-\nland; and Orange County) with the highest percentage\nof physicians in groups in the 3 largest size categories\n16.2%) and the 4 areas (Greenville, NC; Syracuse; New-\nark, NJ; and Miami) with fewest physicians (5.6%; mean,\n4.9%) in such groups (data not shown). There were only\n2 exceptions. A better lifestyle was the second most fre-\nquently mentioned benefit, and news of failures of other\ngroups was the second most frequently mentioned bar-\nrier by interviewees in areas with relatively few physi-\ncians in large groups, but were least frequently cited by\ninterviewees in areas with relatively more physicians in\nlarge groups. Interviewees in sites with fewer large groups\nmay be relatively more focused on the lifestyle advan-\ntages that even small groups can offer.\nCOMMENT\nMost of the benefits traditionally thought to be pro-\nvided by groups--economies of scale, profit from ancil-\nlary services, and a better lifestyle--were cited by inter-\nviewees. By far the most frequently cited benefit,\nhowever--gaining negotiating leverage with health\nplans--is new, ie, a creation of managed care. Accord-\ning to interviewees, however, groups do not have much\nincentive to improve quality. Although many inter-\nviewees expressed reservations about the performance of\ngroups at present, some argued that only groups of at least\nmoderate size, rather than physicians in solo or very small\npractices, have the ability to create organized processes\nto proactively improve care. Furthermore, with the ex-\nception of a few specialties (eg, cardiac surgery, in which\nthe same procedure is performed repeatedly), they ar-\ngued that only groups can serve as units of analysis for\nwhich statistically reliable and valid measurements of qual-\nity can be made.59 According to a physician group ad-\nministrator in Seattle, \"Groups can better monitor clini-\ncal performance and implement clinical protocols. As\ndemands for accountability in health care increase, so too\nwill the pressures for physicians to join groups.\" How-\never, as long as purchasers and health plans fail to pro-\nvide rewards for quality and emphasize relative negoti-\nating strength vs physicians as a method for determining\nthe level of physician payment, interviewees did not an-\nticipate that groups will focus on quality improve-\nInterviewees critically described physicians' lack of\ncooperation, lack of investment in their groups, and lack\nof support for leadership as barriers. Complementary or\nalternative explanations exist for the lack of increase in\nlarge groups: ie, many physicians may prefer a solo prac-\ntice or small-group lifestyle, many patients may prefer\nthis setting,63-65 and/or larger groups may fail to provide\nthe benefits claimed for them. The increasing preva-\nis consistent with this explanation, as is the small, sta-\ntistically insignificant decline in the percentage of phy-\nsicians in all 3 categories of large groups between rounds\n2 and 3. However, it is also possible that larger groups\nprovide more benefits, but that collective-action prob-\nlems66 limit the number of physicians willing to assume\nthe leadership role necessary to create and maintain such\ngroups. A medical group may benefit its physicians and\nits patients, but if physicians are unwilling to compen-\nsate leaders, the costs of creating and operating the group\nwould be paid mainly by the leaders, whereas all physi-\ncians in the group benefit. In this case, relatively few lead-\ners and groups are likely to appear.\nInterviewees stated that risk contracting made mul-\ntispecialty groups more likely to form, but that fee-for-\nservice contracting increased the incentive to form single-\nspecialty groups to gain the economies of scale to invest\nin and profit from ancillary services, often in competi-\ntion with hospitals. Single-specialty groups were also de-\nscribed as able to gain negotiating leverage with health\nplans at sizes smaller than multispecialty groups, while\navoiding conflict between primary care and specialties\nover income distribution.\nOur study has several limitations. First, we report\ninterviewees' perceptions, not data purporting to dem-\nonstrate the existence of, for example, economies of scale.\nSecond, we did not interview \"rank-and-file\" physi-\ncians. Their perceptions may differ from those of lead-\ners and should be a subject of future research. Third, our\ninterviewees' responses were focused more on larger than\nsmaller groups. It is possible that their evaluation of the\nrelative importance of particular benefits and barriers\nwould be different for small groups. Finally, we do not\n\u00a92003 American Medical Association.

Medical groups, believed by the com-\nmittee to be at least a partial solution to these problems,\nare perceived by CTS interviewees--including group lead-\ners themselves--as much more focused on increasing their\nincomes by gaining negotiating leverage and drawing all\navailable revenue out of their groups than they are on in-\nvesting in improving the quality of care. Was the report\nwrong to focus on groups? Should physicians, patients,\ncorporate and government purchasers of health care, or\ngovernment regulators care about the organizational forms\nthat physician practice takes? Does it matter whether phy-\nsicians practice in single-specialty or multispecialty groups\norinsmall,moderate-sized,orlargegroups?Whateverpur-\nchasers, health plans, regulators, and hospitals do, phy-\nsicians care for patients.
