We sought to quantify the association of youth\nincarceration with subsequent adult health outcomes.\nMETHODS: We analyzed data from 14344 adult participants in the National Longitudinal\nStudy of Adolescent to Adult Health. We used weighted multivariate logistic regressions to\ninvestigate the relationship between cumulative incarceration duration (none, <1 month,\n1\u00ad12 months, and >1 year) before Wave IV (ages 24\u00ad34 years) and subsequent adult health\noutcomes (general health, functional limitations, depressive symptoms, and suicidal\nthoughts). Models controlled for Wave I (grades 7\u00ad12) baseline health, sociodemographics,\nand covariates associated with incarceration and health.\nRESULTS: A total of 14.0% of adults reported being incarcerated between Waves I and IV. Of\nthese, 50.3% reported a cumulative incarceration duration of <1 month, 34.8% reported 1\nto 12 months, and 15.0% reported >1 year. Compared with no incarceration, incarceration\nduration of < 1 month predicted subsequent adult depressive symptoms (odds ratio\nA duration of >1 year predicted subsequent adult functional limitations (OR = 2.92; 95% CI,\nCONCLUSIONS: Cumulative incarceration duration during adolescence and early adulthood\nis independently associated with worse physical and mental health later in adulthood.\nPotential mechanisms merit exploration.\naDepartment of Pediatrics, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, bUCLA Children's Discovery and\nInnovation Institute, Mattel Children's Hospital, and Departments of cBiomathematics and dHealth, Policy, and\nManagement, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California; and\neRAND Health, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California\nDr Barnert conceptualized the study, designed and supervised the analysis, and drafted the\nmanuscript and revisions; Drs Dudovitz, Nelson, and Coker provided strategic input on study\ndesign, interpretation of study results, and assisted with revision of the manuscript; Mr Biely\nprovided strategic input on study design, performed the statistical programming, assisted with\ninterpretation of study results, and assisted with revision of the manuscript; Dr Li provided expert\nconsultation on biostatistical study design, analysis and interpretation, and manuscript revision;\nand Dr Chung supervised all aspects of the study, from conceptualization and design to data\nanalysis and interpretation and writing of the manuscript; and all authors approve of the final\nmanuscript as it is presented.\nNIH\nTo cite: Barnert ES, Dudovitz R, Nelson BB, et al. How\nDoes Incarcerating Young People Affect Their Adult Health\ncompelling data on the unmet health needs of\nincarcerated youth, no existing studies describe the\nlongitudinal relationship between the duration of\nincarceration of young people and subsequent adult\nhealth outcomes.\nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: The study demonstrates\nthat youth incarceration is independently associated\nwith worse adult physical and mental health\noutcomes. This finding suggests an important role\nfor pediatricians to protect youth from potentially\nharmful effects of incarceration and mitigate any\ndownstream negative effects.\nDespite widespread use of\nincarceration in the United\nStates, relatively little literature\nexamines longitudinal effects\nof youth incarceration on adult\nhealth outcomes.1,2 The United\nStates incarcerates a far greater\nproportion of youth than any other\ndeveloped country.3 Each year,\nUS law enforcement arrests 1.3\nmillion juveniles (ie, children and\nadolescents <18 years old).4 Of these,\n80% will be reincarcerated as\nadults.5 Currently, 6.8 million adults,\nor 2.8% of the adult population, are\nunder correctional supervision.6\nFurthermore, data from the US\nBureau of Justice Statistics indicate\nthat the lifetime imprisonment risk\nin a state or federal prison is 1 out\nAfrican American men, and 1 out of\n6 for Hispanic men. These numbers\nincrease dramatically if incarceration\nin jails is also included. These trends\nof racial and ethnic disparities in\nconfinement are similar for females.7\nIncarcerated juveniles have\nextremely high rates of unmet health\nneeds.8\u00ad11 Forty-six percent of newly\ndetained juveniles have urgent\nmedical needs requiring immediate\nattention.9 Seventy percent of\nincarcerated juveniles have at least 1\npsychiatric disorder.12 Additionally,\n12% of juveniles currently\nincarcerated, both boys and girls, are\nexpecting a child of their own.10\nDespite compelling, nationally\nrepresentative cross-sectional data\non the health status of incarcerated\nyouth, there is surprisingly little\nevidence on the relationship\nbetween juvenile incarceration and\nsubsequent adult health outcomes.1,\n2 Overall, youth and adults with\na history of incarceration have\nmarkedly worse health statuses\nthan their non\u00adjustice involved\ncounterparts.8,13 However, the\nlinkage between youth incarceration\nand subsequent worse adult health\nmight not be causal. First, many\nsocial determinants of poor health\n(eg, poverty and racial/ethnic\nminority status) are also associated\nwith greater incarceration risk.14\nSecond, individuals with poor\nhealth may be at higher risk for\nincarceration (eg, many drug users\nand mentally ill offenders are\nincarcerated instead of treated).1\nCausal associations, however, are\nalso plausible. Although incarceration\nmay have some short-term health\nbenefits, mostly due to the provision\nof health care during detention\nand removal from risk-promoting\nenvironments, incarceration is\nmore frequently postulated to have\noverall detrimental effects on health.1\nProposed mechanisms for a causal\nlinkage between incarceration and\nworse subsequent health include\nexposures within detention facilities\n(eg, communicable diseases) and\nphysical or sexual traumas sustained\nwhile confined.1 Confinement\nalso likely erodes mental health.15\nPostincarceration social and\neconomic disadvantages related to\nstigma, disrupted social networks,\nand negative \"social\" credentials\nmay also contribute to the higher\nrates of fatal drug overdose, suicide,\nand posttraumatic stress seen in\nincarceration may compound existing\nsocioeconomic and psychosocial\nhealth risks in vulnerable\npopulations.1\nThe small existing literature on\nlongitudinal health effects of youth\nincarceration suggests that any\nincarceration during adolescence\nor young adulthood is associated\nwith worse general health,17 severe\nfunctional limitations,1 stress-related\nillnesses, such as hypertension,2\nand higher rates of overweight and\nobesity during adulthood.18 We\nadd to what is currently known\nby examining a dose measure of\nincarceration. The longitudinal\nimpact of the cumulative duration of\nincarceration on subsequent adult\nhealth is unknown. We sought to\nquantify the association between\nyouth incarceration and a diverse set\nof adult health outcomes.\nMETHODS\nWe analyzed data from the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent\nto Adult Health (Add Health), a\nnationally representative survey\nparticipants between the ages of 24\nto 34 years old. The Wave I baseline\nsurvey collected data on social\ndeterminants of health and youths'\nhealth status. The Wave IV Add\nHealth follow-up survey collected\ndata on if, when, and for how long\nindividuals were incarcerated as well\nas data on adult health status. The\nWave IV survey included in-home\ninterviews conducted within the\nhome residences of participants as\nwell as interviews conducted within\ncorrectional settings.20\nWe sought to measure the association\nbetween youth incarceration and\nsubsequent adult health outcomes.\nWe define \"youth\" as adolescents\nand young adults <25 years old.\nTo explore possible temporal\nassociations between incarceration\nand subsequent adult health,\nwe excluded the 311 individuals\nincarcerated before their Wave I\ninterview. The resulting analytic\nwith full data on the primary\npredictor, primary outcome (adult\ngeneral health), and sample weight.\nIncarceration Predictor Measures\nTo provide a dose measure of\nincarceration exposure, which, to our\nknowledge, no previous study has\ndone, we constructed our primary\npredictor as cumulative lifetime\nduration of incarceration before\non the distribution of the raw data\nand a conceptual cut-point of \"short,\"\n\"medium,\" and \"long\" durations of\nincarceration, we constructed our\ncumulative incarceration duration\npredictor to have 4 categories: no\nincarceration (reference category),\na duration of <1 month, a duration\nof 1 to 12 months, and a duration of\n>1 year. To construct our cumulative\nincarceration duration predictor, we\ncombined responses to the Wave IV\nquestions asking, \"Before your 18th\nbirthday, about how much total time\ndid you spend in jail or detention?\"\nand \"Since your 18th birthday, about\nhow much total time have you spent\nin jail or detention?\" For ease of\ninterpretation, we also created a\ndichotomous variable (ever versus\nnever incarcerated) to display our\ndescriptive and bivariate results.\nAdult Health Outcomes\nWe chose adult health outcomes for\ntheir high prevalence and impact\non morbidity, mortality, and overall\nwell-being. Our primary adult health\noutcome was adult general health,\nwhich may incorporate aspects\nof physical health, mental health,\nand psychosocial well-being. We\nselected the secondary outcomes of\nadult functional limitations, adult\ndepressive symptoms, and suicidal\nthoughts to assess for differential\nassociations between youth\nincarceration and physical versus\nmental health domains.\nAdult General Health\nTo measure adult general health, we\nused self-report of health, a well-\nstudied general health measure\nassociated with morbidity and\nmortality.21 In both Waves I and IV,\nparticipants were asked to rate their\nhealth as excellent, very good, good,\nfair, or poor. Given the response\ndistributions in the relatively young\nand healthy Add Health population,\nwe used a dichotomous measure of\nworse self-rated health for responses\nof good, fair, or poor. A sensitivity\nanalysis using the alternate cut-\npoint of defining worse self-related\nhealth as fair or poor revealed similar\nresults.\nAdult Functional Limitations\nAdult functional limitations are an\nimportant physical health outcome\nthat likely also has implications\nfor mental health. We created a\ndichotomous measure of adult\nfunctional limitations based on\na question that asked whether\nhealth problems created limitations\nwith climbing flights of stairs. We\ncategorized individuals as having\nfunctional limitations if they reported\nany limitations in climbing stairs.\nAdult Depressive Symptoms\nWe selected adult depressive\nsymptoms as a secondary adult\nhealth outcome because depression\nis one of the most common adult\nmental health disorders and is\nassociated with poor social and\nand IV, respondents completed the\nshort-form Center for Epidemiologic\nStudies Depression Scale (CESD-10),\na well-validated 10-item screening\nfor depression symptoms in the\nprevious 7 days.24 We used Wave IV\nCESD-10 data to construct the adult\ndepressive symptoms variable and\nWave I CESD-10 data to construct\nthe baseline depressive symptoms\nvariable. Consistent with previous\nstudies, we categorized a score\n11 as a dichotomous measure of\ndepressive symptoms.25\nAdult Suicidal Thoughts\nSuicidality is an important concern in\nadult populations22 and is especially\na risk for incarcerated and formerly\nincarcerated adults.26 We created\na dichotomous measure of adult\nsuicidal thoughts using the Wave\nIV single-item response that asked\nrespondents if they had seriously\nconsidered suicide in the previous 12\nmonths.\nCovariates\nWe selected covariates that were\nassociated with both\nyouth incarceration and adult\nhealth variables, sociodemographic\nvariables, and, based on existing\nliterature, additional variables\nassociated with incarceration and\nhealth. Potential covariates were\nidentified based on the literature and\nthen confirmed to be significantly\nassociated with the main predictor\n(duration of incarceration) and\nmain outcome (adult general\nhealth) in bivariate analyses.\nSpecifically, the baseline health\nvariables were baseline general\nhealth in the general health model,\nbaseline functional limitations in the\nfunctional limitations model, and\nbaseline depressive symptoms and\nsuicidal thoughts in the depressive\nsymptoms and suicidal thoughts\nmodels. For the Wave I baseline\nhealth variables of general health,\ndepressive symptoms, and suicidal\nthoughts, questions were asked that\nwere identical to those for the adult\nWave IV participants. For baseline\nfunctional limitations, because an\nidentical item was not asked in Wave\nI, we created a dichotomous measure\nusing a single-item response that\nasked participants whether they had\ndifficulty using their limbs because\nof a permanent physical condition.\nThe sociodemographic variables\nincluded: self-reported gender; race/\nethnicity (white, African American,\nHispanic, other); age; parents'\nreported household income; and\nhighest level of parental education.\nWe also included other individual,\nfamily, and community-level factors\nthat may be associated with both\nincarceration and health based on\nfindings from existing literature.\nIndividual-level covariates were:\n(1) school connectedness, measured\nvia a 5-item scale (Cronbach's ,\naverage, constructed based on\nself-reported most recent grades\nin English or language arts, math,\nhistory or social science, and science;\n(3) perceived likelihood of attending\ncollege (single-item, 5-point scale\nasking about likelihood of attending\ncollege); (4) delinquent behaviors,\nmeasured by the 12-item serious\ndelinquency scale (Cronbach's ,\ndefined as drinking at least 2 days\nper month; (6) cigarette use, defined\nas use at least once during the\nprevious 30 days; (7) marijuana use,\ndefined as use at least once in the\nprevious 30 days; (8) other drug use,\ndefined as using \"other drugs,\" such\nas, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD),\nphencyclidine (PCP), cocaine, ecstasy,\ninhalants, or mushrooms at least\nonce in the previous 30 days. Family-\nlevel covariates were: (1) family\nhousehold structure, (2 biological\nparents, 2-parent [1 nonbiological],\nsingle parent, other); (2) history of\nparental incarceration, measured\nby self-report in Wave IV; and (3)\nfamily connectedness, measured via\nCommunity-level covariates were:\n(1) perceived neighborhood safety,\n(single-item response asking about\nperceived neighborhood safety;\nreference category was \"yes\"); (2)\nneighborhood unemployment,\nstandardized unemployment rate\nby block group; and (3) proportion\nof neighborhood adults without\na high-school diploma, defined as\nthe standardized proportion of\ncommunity adults age 25 years\nwithout a high-school diploma or\nequivalent, and also measured by\nby block group. All of the covariates\nwere constructed based on self-\nreport items from the adolescent\nin-home Wave I interviews with the\nexceptions of household income,\ngrade point average, parental\nincarceration, neighborhood\nunemployment, and neighborhood\nhigh school graduation rate.\nData Analysis\nWe first explored descriptive\nstatistics and then performed\nbivariate and multivariate analyses\non the relationship between\nbaseline social determinants of\nhealth, baseline health status,\nincarceration, and subsequent\nadult health outcomes. F-test and\n2 analyses were performed to\ncompare covariates and adult health\noutcomes between individuals\nwith a history of incarceration and\nthose without any incarceration.\nMultivariate logistic regressions\ninvestigated the relationship\nbetween an individual's cumulative\nduration of incarceration before\nsubsequent adult health outcomes\n(self-reported general health,\nfunctional limitations, depressive\nsymptoms, and suicidal thoughts)\nin Wave IV, controlled for the\ncovariates described above. We\nconducted analyses in Stata version\n12.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX)\nusing the \"svy\" suite of commands\nto account for the Add Health survey\ndesign elements of stratification,\nclustering, and weighting. We tested\nfor interactions by gender and race/\nethnicity by creating interaction\nterms and by exploring analyses\nstratified by gender and race/\nethnicity. The study was approved\nby the UCLA institutional review\nboard.\nRESULTS\nFourteen percent of the analytic\nreported ever being incarcerated. Of\nthese, 50.3% reported a cumulative\nincarceration duration of <1 month,\nAt Wave IV, 57.6% of the analytic\nsample reported very good or\nexcellent health, our reference\ncategory; 42.4% reported poor, fair,\nor good health. Similarly, at Wave IV,\n6.1% reported functional limitations,\n6.9% reported suicidal thoughts\ndescribed symptoms of depression in\nthe last week.\nBivariate analyses demonstrated\nworse adult health outcomes\nfor individuals with a history\nof incarceration compared with\nthose without incarceration.\nThese unadjusted results were\nstatistically significant for all 4\nof the adult health outcomes and,\noverall, show a strong statistically\nsignificant relationship between\nsocial determinants of health, such\nas poverty, parental education,\nand parental incarceration, and\nsubsequent incarceration risk\n(Table 1).\nMultivariate analyses revealed\nthat any length of incarceration\nwas associated with higher odds\nof having worse adult health\n(Table 2). In the model for adult\ngeneral health, we found that\ncompared with no incarceration, a\ncumulative incarceration duration\nof 1 to 12 months predicted worse\nsubsequent adult general health\nYoung people's cumulative duration of incarceration: results by Add Health Wave IV (n = 14344).\nP = .007).

The associations between\nincarceration and our primary\noutcome, general health, were\nnot modified by gender or race/\nethnicity.\nDISCUSSION\nOur results suggest that\nincarceration during adolescence\nand early adulthood is independently\nassociated with worse physical and\nmental health outcomes during\nadulthood. This relationship holds\neven when accounting for baseline\nhealth and key social determinants\nof health. Our findings linking youth\nincarceration and worse adult\nhealth are consistent with previous\nlongitudinal studies, which have\nsimilarly shown an association\nbetween youth incarceration and\nstudy adds the dimension of a dose\nmeasure of incarceration. Given\nthe wide variations in sentencing\nand amount of justice involvement\ndifferent youth may experience, it is\ncritical to understand how duration\nof incarceration might affect health.\nWe found that an incarceration\nduration of >1 month is associated\nwith worse adult general health, and\na duration of >1 year is associated\nwith worse adult mental health\nand adult functional limitations.\nIn addition to the observation of a\ntemporal relationship between youth\nincarceration and subsequent worse\nadult health outcomes, the higher\nORs in the >1-year category observed\nwhen we examined the specific\nadult health outcomes of functional\nlimitations, depressive symptoms,\nand suicidal thoughts provide\nevidence that a causal relationship\nmay exist.\nGiven the current era of mass\nincarceration, this observation\nhas important health implications.\nIncarcerated and formerly\nincarcerated individuals face\ndisproportionate morbidity and\nmortality compared with their\nnon\u00adjustice involved counterparts,\nwhich may compound any social\nvulnerabilities and additionally\nhinder opportunities for success.8,16\nFor the 1.3 million children and\nadolescents arrested in the\nUnited States each year,4\nincarceration may systemically\ndegrade their healthy development.\nThe juvenile justice system,\ninitially created to rehabilitate\nyouthful offenders, has become\nincreasingly harsh and punitive.30\nOur findings speak to an urgent\nneed for pediatricians to increase\nefforts to: (1) prevent youth\nincarceration by addressing key\nbehavioral and social determinants\nof health and (2) mitigate\npotential downstream health\neffects of youth incarceration.\nOur findings align with the\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\ninvolved in the juvenile justice\nsystem, which put forth several\nactions pediatricians can take\nto improve the health of justice-\ninvolved youth, including to actively\nadvocate to reduce the number of\nyouth confined.8\nOur study has several potential\nlimitations. First, the baseline Add\nHealth survey was a school-based\nsample, which could have created\na selection bias for our study. Also,\nalthough follow-up surveys were\nconducted in correctional settings, it\nis possible that survey participants\nwith a history of incarceration\nmay still have been lost to follow-up\nat a higher rate. However, it is\nreassuring that the observed\nincarceration rate at Wave IV is\nconsistent with national figures.31\nIt is also important to note that\nthe age range for our adult health\noutcomes was relatively wide\npostulate that these limitations may\nhave led to an underestimate of the\nassociations between cumulative\nincarceration and health, because\nhigher-risk, justice-involved\nindividuals and those with worse\nadult health outcomes would have\nbeen less likely to be included\nin the final Add Health sample.\nAdditionally, the study sample\nincluded some individuals first\nincarcerated after young adulthood\nour sensitivity analyses excluding\nthese individuals did not\nsubstantially alter our results.\nAnother issue is the possibility\nof unmeasured factors that we\nwere not able to account for in\nour analysis, such as system-level\ndifferences within correctional\nsettings, including the quality\nof health care delivered and the\noverall conditions of confinement.\nDespite these limitations, our\nfindings support that mechanisms\ncausally linking youth incarceration\nwith worse adult health may exist.\nThese potential mechanisms merit\nadditional examination and, if\nconfirmed, intervention.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGiven the high prevalence of\nincarceration, coupled with a\ncurrent bipartisan willingness to\npursue criminal justice reform,\n32 the finding that more months\nin confinement as adolescents\nand young adults correlates with\nworse adult health outcomes is\ntimely. Individuals with a history of\nincarceration may need increased\nsupport to overcome any long-term\ndetrimental physical and mental\nhealth effects of incarceration.\nHealth professionals can stand at\nthe forefront of the juvenile and\ncriminal justice reform movement\nto more fully explore how justice\nreform can adapt alongside\nhealthcare reform to develop\nsystems that may protect rather\nthan harm the health of these\nyouth. Pediatricians have the\nopportunity to improve youths'\nlong-term adult health outcomes\nby ensuring that unnecessary,\npotentially harmful exposures to\nincarceration are minimized and,\nfor those exposed, to monitor\nfor and mitigate any negative\ndownstream health effects.\n"
