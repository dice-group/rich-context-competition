The persistent, cross-cultural, relatively high\nincidence of mental disorder in the general population suggests that it might have\nevolutionary significance. The attempts to explain mental disorder from an evolutionary\nperspective centered on the possible functions of distinct mental conditions (e.g., Crow,\ntaxonomy of mental disorder (Wakefield, 1997; Wakefield and First, 2003). To this end,\ndisorder is seen either as evolutionary dysfunction--failure of natural design, or as\nnaturally selected conditions having present or past fitness advantages (Nesse, 2005).\nFor instance, very much unlike the prevalent view that it is a brain disorder\nexplain depression through the functions it may serve, with some authors arguing that low\nmood is associated with less likelihood of engaging in risk-taking behaviors (Leith and\nBaumeister, 1996) and others arguing that low levels of depression seem to be \"normal\" or\nfunctional states (McGuire, Troisi, and Raleigh, 1997; Nesse, 1998; Nesse and Williams,\nHigh-K and psychopathology\nLikewise, phobias are explained as \"prepared\" fears gone awry. Prepared fears are\nfears of things that were a threat to survival during the environment of evolutionary\nadaptedness. Most phobias are exaggerations of such fears (e.g., spiders, heights, storms,\nsnakes, strangers, blood, unfamiliar places) (Marks, 1987; Marks and Nesse, 1994) and few\ndevelop phobias of modern threats to survival (e.g., cars, cigarettes, or alcohol).\nMental illness has negative effects on fitness. Severe depression is associated with\nreduced fitness (McGuire et al., 1997), as is schizophrenia (Avila, Thaker, and Adami,\n2001; Haukka, Suvisaari, and L\u00f6nnqvist, 2003). Women with psychotic disorders have\nbeen shown to have lower fertility than matched normal comparison subjects (Howard,\nKumar, Lesse, and Thornicroft, 2002). Likewise, people suffering from non-affective\npsychoses have been shown to have significantly fewer children than their unaffected\nsiblings, with the effect more pronounced for male patients versus well brothers (McGrath\nMental illness of the parents seems not only to affect their resultant fitness\ntranslated in sheer number of children but it also compromises offspring quality. Children\nof parents with severe mental illness are themselves at increased risk of childhood\npsychiatric disorders (Cowling, Luk, Mileshkin, and Birleson, 2004) and the risk of\noffspring with impaired intellectual handicap is significantly increased for schizophrenia\nand affective psychoses mothers compared with controls (Jablensky et al., 1998).\nPurpose of the study\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the associations between a high-K\nreproductive strategy and mental illness. According to Life History Theory (e.g., Bogaert\nWilson, 1975), for any organism, its available resources are finite, which translates into\ntrade-offs in their allocation for solving various fitness-relevant tasks. For instance, the\nresources allocated to grow a bigger body cannot be used to pursue mates, and vice versa.\nThe extremes of these fundamental dimensions of reproduction are traditionally termed the\nr/K theory, with r representing the maximum egg output and no investment and K\nrepresenting the opposite. Rushton (1985, 1990) extrapolated the r/K continuum of life\nhistory strategies to human differences from Wilson's (1975) analysis of cross-species\ndifferences in reproductive strategies. In humans, since they appear to be highly K-selected,\nthese dimensions are often referred to as \"differential K.\"\nA high-K strategy in humans is theorized as a specific and cohesive fitness strategy,\nin which the individual invests in somatic and parental effort to produce a fewer number of\n\"fitter\" and more competitive offspring. Measures of high-K strategy have been shown to\ncorrelate with offspring quality and with resultant fitness (Giosan, 2006). Traits associated\nwith a high-K strategy are long-term thinking and planning, commitment to long-term\nrelationships, extensive parental investment, existence of social support structures,\nadherence to social rules (e.g., altruism and cooperation) and careful consideration of risks\nBecause a high-K strategy is associated with greater somatic effort as opposed to\nreproductive effort, \"slow\" strategists should manifest the benefits of this in terms of better\nmental and physical health. Likewise, low-K (\"fast\") strategists should exhibit increased\npsychopathology and increased physical illness, because these individuals do not allocate\nsufficient somatic effort to prevent such problems. Indeed, in one of the first studies on this\nHigh-K and psychopathology\ntopic, high-K strategy was shown to be an important negative predictor of depressive\nsymptomatology, accounting for 20% in the variance in the Beck Depression Inventory\nscores, after controlling for risk factors in depression such as demographics, prior trauma,\nprior psychopathology, or recent negative life events (Giosan, 2007).\nExpanding on these findings, the principal aim of this study was to explore the\nassociations between a high-K fitness strategy and a larger array of mental conditions,\nincluding PTSD and related psychopathology, sleep disturbances, anger, and functional\ndisability. The overarching hypothesis tested in this study was that a successful high-K\nstrategy is a negative predictor of mental illness.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants were a sample of n = 1400 disaster workers who were deployed to the\nWorld Trade Center in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attack. They were administered\na full battery of self-reports and a subsample of 436 (31%) respondents were also\nadministered a structured clinical interview conducted by doctoral level clinicians.\nMeasures\nClinician-Administered Measures\n1) Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. The Clinician-Administered PTSD scale\n(CAPS; Blake et al., 1995) is a structured interview for posttraumatic stress\ndisorder (PTSD) that yields both a dichotomous (present/absent) diagnosis of\nPTSD and a continuous measure of its severity. The CAPS assesses the\nfrequency and intensity of each PTSD symptom on separate 5-point rating\nscales (0 - 4). Frequency and intensity may be summed for each item to yield a\nnine-point (0 - 8) severity rating, and these ratings may be summed across items\nto yield a severity score for the full PTSD syndrome.\n2) The Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV (SCID; First, Spitzer,\nWilliams, and Gibbon, 1997) is a semi-structured clinical interview designed to\ndetermine DSM-IV diagnoses, and its psychometric properties have been well-\nestablished (First et al., 1997). The SCID and selected modules for the DSM-IV,\nwhich included past major depression, past panic disorder, and past generalized\nanxiety disorder, were administered and collapsed into one variable (past\npsychopathology present or absent).\n3) The WTC Exposure Questionnaire was developed by a panel of trauma experts\nto assess occupational exposure through performance of disaster work as well as\npersonal exposure to the WTC attacks (e.g., loss of loved ones). The\ndevelopment of the exposure index in this study began with variables that were\nshown in the disaster literature to predict PTSD and revised with questions that\nemerged as unique to working at the WTC site. For the purposes of this study, a\ntotal exposure score was calculated by summing up the items that the\nparticipants reported as having experienced.\nHigh-K and psychopathology\nSelf-reports\n4) High-K Strategy Scale (HKSS; Giosan, 2006). HKSS is a 26-item scale tapping\ninto various indicators of high-K strategy. These indicators include upward\nmobility (high-K strategists seek opportunities to gain resources for greater\ninvestment in their offspring), health and attractiveness (high-K strategists\ninvest in somatic, rather than reproductive, effort, therefore they should enjoy\nbetter health and be, consequently, more attractive), social capital, or risk\nconsideration. As predicted, this construct correlated significantly with\nperceived offspring quality (through the fact that high-K strategists invest their\ntime and resources in parental effort). It also correlated negatively with number\nof previous marriages (because high-K strategists are committed to long-term\nrelationships). Also, it correlated with objective measures of health, educational\nlevel and social support (because high-K strategists invest in somatic,\neducational opportunities and social capital for gaining better access to\nresources for their offspring). As expected, this construct showed a weak but\nsignificant correlation with actual number of children (the net result of a\nsuccessful high-K strategy is fitness, but characterized through smaller number\nof children). Lastly, since a high-K strategy is theorized as a cohesive\nreproductive strategy, the indicators that make it up were predicted to have high\ninternal consistency. Indeed, HKSS's Cronbach's  was .92 (Giosan, 2006). The\nitems of this scale are summed up to yield a total score.\n5) The PTSD Checklist (PCL; Weathers, Herman, Huska, and Keane, 1993) is a\nDSM-correspondent, 17-item self-report measure of PTSD. Using a five-point\nrating scale (1 = \"not at all,\" 5 = \"extremely\"), respondents indicate how much\nthey were bothered in the past month by each of the DSM-IV PTSD symptoms.\nThe PCL is psychometrically sound and has been used in nearly two hundred\nstudies across a variety of trauma populations (Weathers et al., 1993). The PCL\nyields both a continuous severity score and a PTSD diagnosis.\n6) Brief Symptom Inventory. The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI; Derogatis, 1993)\nis a 53-item abbreviated version of the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised\n(Derogatis and Spencer, 1982) that assesses a broad range of symptoms of\npsychopathology. The BSI yields scores for nine symptom dimensions as well\nas global indices, based on the calculation of mean item responses. In the\npresent study we used the Global Severity Index (GSI) from the BSI, where\nhigher scores indicate more severe overall psychopathology.\n7) The State Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2 (STAXI-2). The STAXI-2, a\nrevised 57-item version of the STAXI (Spielberger, 1988), provides concise\nmeasures of the experience, expression, and control of anger. For the purposes\nof this study, the 15-item STAXI State Anger (S-Ang) scale was used to assess\ntotal state anger. The Cronbach's  for this scale in this study was 0.93.\n8) Sheehan Disability Scale. The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS; Sheehan, 1983)\nis a 10-point visual analogue scale that assesses disability across three domains:\nwork, social life, and family life. The three items may be summed into a single\ndimensional measure of global functional impairment that ranges from 0\n(unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired), which was used in this study. This scale\nHigh-K and psychopathology\nhas been widely used in psychopharmacology randomized controlled trials and\nhas strong internal consistency (Cronbach's  = 0.89 for the three-item scale).\n9) The Sleep Index is a modified version of the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index\n(PSQI) (Buysse, Reynolds, Monk, Berman, and Kupfer, 1989), and was used to\nassess sleep disturbances and their frequency. PSQI has been widely used to\nmeasure sleep difficulty in different populations (Chesson et al., 2000) and has\nCronbach's  of the sleep index in this study was acceptable (Cronbach's  =\nStatistical approach\nExamining the independent effects of high-K on measures of psychopathology was\nthe main goal of the study. To this end, correlations between high-K, demographics (age,\nrace, education, marital status), past psychopathology (dichotomized: \"yes\" for presence of\npast psychopathology, \"no\" for absence), prior trauma, self-reported (PCL) and clinician-\nadministered (CAPS) PTSD severity score, general psychopathology (GSI), anger (STAXI-\n2), disability (Sheehan), sleep disturbance (total Sleep Index score) and Exposure to 9/11\ntotal score, were first performed.\nSimultaneous regressions of the outcomes examined (PCL, CAPS, GSI, STAXI-2,\nSheehan and total Sleep Index score) on the variables that were significantly correlated\nwith them were then performed to identify the variables that account for significant\nvariance (tolerances greater than .8) in these outcomes. To examine the unique\ncontribution of high-K, variables that showed tolerances greater than .8 were then\ncontrolled for in regressions of the outcomes on high-K.\nResults\nDemographics\nTable 1 depicts the demographic characteristics of the sample (n = 1400). Overall,\nthe sample consisted of primarily middle-aged, white, married men with the majority\nhaving at least a high-school education.\nHigh-K and psychopathology\nThe correlation table for all the measures is presented in Table 2.

This pattern was not singular, but was found across a range of\npsychopathologies, including PTSD, sleep disturbances, functional disability, anger, or\noverall psychopathology.\nThese findings, along with previous findings that found high-K to be strongly\ninversely related to depressive symptomatology (Giosan, 2007), suggest that high-K\nappears to be an important buffer of psychopathology. In our study, high-K accounted for\nHigh-K and psychopathology\nvariance ranging from 5% to 12% in the different psychopathologies assessed, the greatest\nvariance being found in the General Symptom Inventory total score.\nThe strong negative association between high-K and PTSD seems to speak against\nan evolutionary view that argues for the adaptive value of PTSD symptoms (e.g., Nesse,\n2005), at least for this particular reproductive strategy. Our results show that lower scores\non high-K, which are associated with reduced fitness (Giosan, 2006), are also associated\nwith increased severity in PTSD symptoms. Since the findings documented in this study\nshow that this reproductive strategy correlates negatively with the severity of PTSD, this\nresult may offer indirect support to the view that holds that PTSD is the expression of an\noverlearned survival response in vulnerable individuals (Silove, 1998), which, when it\ndevelops, may have significant negative effects on those individuals' fitness.\nDespite these important findings, several caveats are in order: First, as in any\ncorrelational study, the direction of causality cannot be established with certainty. One can\nargue that people score highly on the high-K precisely because they enjoyed better mental\nhealth in the first place and their resources could thus be channeled to the indicators that\nmake up the high-K factor. This is a legitimate claim and testing the direction of causality\nis not a small feat. Further longitudinal studies examining the associations between changes\nin high-K and changes in psychopathology are needed to address such questions. Second,\nthe logistics of the data collection biased the sample toward white males, which may raise\nquestions about the generalizability of these results to other populations. Further studies on\ndifferent populations need to be done to address this aspect. Third, one might argue that the\nrelationships found in this study might be the result of a broad association between general\nmate quality/value and psychopathology. The design of the study did not have mate quality\nin the list of the variables examined therefore it could not address this question. Further\nresearch aimed at clarifying these complex associations should be done.\nDespite these limitations, the present study, to our knowledge the first to link high-\nK and psychopathology, offers evidence that this specific life history strategy is strongly\nnegatively linked to, and a negative predictor of, a broad range of psychopathologies.\nDirections for further research\nThe ramifications of the findings in the present study are multiple. One avenue of\nresearch is to examine the effects of interventions on high-K on psychopathology. Indeed,\nsince many of the indicators making up the high-K independent criterion of fitness are\nmodifiable (e.g., appearance, social capital, personal safety, status) the question of whether\nactive interventions on such indicators would translate into decreased psychopathology\ngains practical and clinical significance. A positive answer to this empirical question would\nlikely aid therapists in their quests of finding more effective interventions.\nAlso, the high-K measure used in this study is understood as a unidimensional\nconstruct tapping into \"slow\" life history strategy, with high scores representing successful\nresolution of the challenges associated with a high-K strategy, and low scores representing\na faulty high-K fitness strategy and not necessarily \"fast\" life history strategy. It would be\nimportant and complementary to this work to examine whether faulty fitness strategies in\ngeneral--being they faulty high-K or faulty low-K--are associated with mental illness.\nHigh-K and psychopathology\nReferences\nAndreasen, N.C.
