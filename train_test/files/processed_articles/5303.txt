Both Study\n1 (N = 78) and Study 2 (N = 90) show that a suggestion of sexism has more beneficial effects when it is made by male\nsources than when it is made by female sources. When males suggested that sexism had taken place, targets reported\nmore self-confidence (less self-handicapping and higher personal performance state self-esteem) and showed less stereotype\nconfirmation (less self-stereotyping and better task performance) than when sexism was suggested by a female source. Study\n2 additionally revealed that targets are more likely to file a complaint when men suggest that sexism took place than when\nthis same suggestion was made by women. These results indicate that men can constitute important allies against sexism if\nthey speak out when sexist treatment takes place.\n",

As you reflect on your performance, you hear\nother candidates suggest that the interviewer seemed sexist.\nYou then find out you are rejected for the job. How does this\nmake you feel? Prior research has shown that a mere sugges-\ntion of sexism can have a range of harmful effects for those\nexposed to it (Adams, Garcia, Purdie-Vaughns, & Steele,\n2006). This is because a suggestion of sexism introduces a\nsocial identity threat, that is, a reminder of the often negative\nand hostile views held about women in society (Steele,\nSpencer, & Aronson, 2002). This reminder has damaging\neffects for individual women and can induce a psychological\nstate that actually promotes stereotype confirmation, for\ninstance, through poor task performance. For example,\nAdams and colleagues (2006) showed that when it was sug-\ngested to female participants that sexist treatment may have\noccurred in an instruction situation, they reported a more\nnegative experience and performed worse on a test than\nfemale participants who were not exposed to a suggestion of\nsexism (see also Schmitt, Branscombe, & Postmes, 2003,\nStudy 2, and Schmitt & Branscombe, 2002, for a review of\nthe negative psychological effects of discrimination).\nHowever, other evidence indicates that a suggestion of\nsexism might at times be beneficial. Suggesting that sexism\nmay have occurred can create a climate that condemns sexist\ntreatment, thereby reducing sexist beliefs (Blanchard,\nCrandall, Brigham, & Vaughn, 1994), and it can communi-\ncate social support that has an important role in promoting\ncollective protest for social change (Van Zomeren, Spears,\nFischer, & Leach, 2004). Importantly, a suggestion of sexism\ncan actually protect the self-confidence of individual women\nby helping to discount personal responsibility for a negative\noutcome (Major, Quinton, & Schmader, 2003; see Major,\nQuinton, & McCoy, 2002, for a review). Indeed, in one study,\nwomen who received negative feedback reported higher per-\nsonal self-esteem when they heard a confederate suggest that\nthe evaluator was sexist than when they did not hear such a\nIn sum, prior investigations of the effects of a suggestion\nof sexism have revealed rather mixed findings. Both harmful\nand self-protective effects of a suggestion of sexism have\nbeen documented on similar outcome variables, which can\nbe seen as indicators of self-confidence and of stereotype\nconfirmation. Our goal is to provide further evidence bearing\n1Leiden University, The Netherlands\n2Dutch Hospital Data, Utrecht, The Netherlands\n3University of Exeter, Devon, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nThe Netherlands.\nEmail: cihangir@hospitaldata.eu\nMen as Allies Against Sexism: The\nPositive Effects of a Suggestion of Sexism\nby Male (vs. Female) Sources\nSezgin Cihangir1,2, Manuela Barreto1,3, and Naomi Ellemers1\n Keywords\ngender and ethnicity, subtle sexism, discrimination, self-handicapping, self-stereotyping, performance, protest\n2 SAGE Open\non this topic and to examine a potential moderator of this\neffect. Specifically, we propose that a suggestion of sexism\nmight have rather different effects depending on who makes\nit--whether the source of this suggestion is male or female.\nMen as Allies Against Sexism\nAlthough it is clear that men often voice discontent with the\nsexist treatment of women (see Tougas & Beaton, 2002, for\na review), research on the consequences of this behavior is as\nyet scarce. What is currently known pertains to how male\nperpetrators react when men versus women confront them\nabout their sexist behavior (Czopp & Monteith, 2003). This\nwork showed that (male and female) sexist perpetrators were\nmore likely to feel guilty and found the confronter more rea-\nsonable if they were confronted by men than if they were\nconfronted by women. However, the point of view of the tar-\nget has not been examined in prior research. Thus, we do not\nknow how female targets react when men (vs. women) sug-\ngestthattheymighthavebeentargetsofsexism.Nevertheless,\nas long as it cannot be fully prevented or avoided that women\nare exposed to sexist treatment, it is as important if not more\nso to understand how they can be helped to best cope with\nsuch experiences.\nA suggestion of sexism can protect individual women\nfrom the conclusion that they are incompetent, but it can also\nmake clear that one's social identity is not valued by others\nWhether the negative or the positive potential will be real-\nized is likely to depend on a series of factors (Major et al.,\nbearing on both points). In the current research, we focus on\nthe gender of those making the suggestion that sexism may\nhave played a role. We propose that when men suggest that\nsexism has taken place, this is likely to have more beneficial\neffects on the target, compared with when the same sugges-\ntion is made by women.\nTo understand this prediction, it is important to consider\nthat a suggestion of sexism can be threatening. This is the\ncase first because reminding people that sexist views persist\nreinforces the notion that an important part of one's identity\n(i.e., her gender) is devalued by others. Second, noting the\nexistence of sexist treatment raises the expectation that one\nwill be exposed to biased treatment on future occasions as\nStroebe, Dovidio, Barreto, Ellemers, & John, 2011). When\npeople perceive that they have subjected to prejudice by\nmembers of a given outgroup, they expect a similar treat-\nment on future encounters with other members of that out-\ngroup (Tropp, 2003). However, this is less likely to be the\ncase when members of that same outgroup expose and label\nprior treatment as prejudicial. Indeed, males who point out\nthat women might have been targets of sexism on one hand\nmake salient that sexist treatment may re-occur, but on the\nother hand also convey that not all men are sexist or hostile\ntoward women. As sexism is expected from males but less so\nfrom females (Baron, Burgess, & Kao, 1991), female sources\nwho suggest that sexism has taken place only raise negative\nexpectations about biased treatment in the future, and do lit-\ntle to alleviate the concern that other men might be sexist too.\nBased on this reasoning, we propose that when a male source\nsuggests that sexism may have played a role, this is likely to\nhave self-protective effects, while this is less likely to be the\ncase when the same suggestion is voiced by a female source.\nIn sum, our main prediction is that when a suggestion of\nsexism is made by a male (vs. female) source, this reduces\nthe social identity threat implied in acknowledging group-\nbased discrimination, and makes it easier for targets to\nengage in self-protective responses. As such, a suggestion of\nsexism made by a male source is likely to induce more self-\nconfidence after negative feedback than when this sugges-\ntion stems from a female source. This is akin to what happens\nwhen discrimination is presented as rare instead of as perva-\nsive: While discrimination perceived as pervasive seems to\nhave mainly negative effects on well-being, targets can profit\nfrom attributing a negative outcome to discrimination that is\nseen as a rare occurrence, which helps them protect their\nself-esteem (Schmitt et al., 2003; see also Cihangir,\nBranscombe, Kobrynowicz, & Owen, 2002; Stroebe et al.,\n2011). The novelty of the approach we take in this article is\nthat we propose a similar effect without changing anything\nabout what is suggested (i.e., about the frequency of occur-\nrence), but merely as a consequence of who indicates sexism\nmay have played a role.\nOverview of the present research. In two studies, we examined\nresponses of individual women to a suggestion of sexism\ndepending on whether it was made by male or by female\nsources. We tested our predictions in a job-interview para-\ndigm where women were exposed to subtle sexism in all\nconditions (through gender-biased questions allegedly posed\nby the interviewer) and subsequently to a suggestion that\nsexism may (not) have played a role, which was made by a\ngroup of either males or females. We chose to focus on a situ-\nation of subtle sexism because such a situation makes both a\nsuggestion of sexism and the lack thereof plausible for the\nparticipants. This choice has important implications. Prior\nresearch has shown that exposure to subtle stereotypes or\nprejudice creates a \"threat in the air,\" which is associated\nwith harmful effects on variables related to self-confidence\nand to stereotype confirmation (Steele & Aronson, 1995; see\nSteele et al., 2002, for a review). As all participants were\nexposed to subtle sexism, we expected relatively low scores\non measures assessing these outcomes when no suggestion\nof sexism was made. When a suggestion of sexism was\nvoiced, we expected higher self-confidence and less stereo-\ntype confirmation, in particular, when the source of the sug-\ngestion was male rather than female.\nSelf-confidence was tapped in Study 1 with a measure of\nself-handicapping to which in Study 2 we added a measure\nof state performance self-esteem. While personal state\nCihangir et al. 3\nperformance self-esteem assesses self-confidence quite\ndirectly (Heatherton & Polivy, 1991), self-handicapping\ndoes so more indirectly. People who self-handicap pave the\nway for attributions to failure that do not reflect lack of com-\npetence, for example, by stressing a momentary physical ill-\nness, lack of effort, or the role of external factors (Jones &\nassociated with the likelihood of failure, self-handicapping is\na form of discounting, but unlike attributional discounting,\ndiscounting through self-handicapping is prophylactic\n(Urdan, 2004), but potentially self-destructive. To our knowl-\nedge, this outcome has never been studied in the context of\nexamining the impact of discrimination on its targets and is\nthus another novel contribution of this research. Less self-\nhandicapping is expected when performance is less threaten-\ning to the individual, or when the individual is more confident\nin his or her ability to perform well (McCrea, Hirt, & Milner,\n2008). We expect this to be the case when male sources voice\na suggestion of sexism. In sum, we expect less self-handicap-\nping (Studies 1 and 2) and higher personal state performance\nself-esteem (Study 2) when male sources suggests that sex-\nism has taken place than when female sources make the same\nsuggestion (Hypothesis 1).\nWe also included two indicators of stereotype confirma-\ntion: stereotypical self-descriptions (Studies 1 and 2) and\ntask performance (Study 2). In the bogus job-interview para-\ndigm used in these studies, participants confirm the negative\nstereotype of which they were target if they describe them-\nselves in line with the female stereotype and if they under-\nperform on a task that is presented as a check of whether or\nnot the interviewer made the correct (gender stereotypical)\ndecision. In line with research on stereotype threat, we\nexpected exposure to subtle sexism to lead to stereotype con-\nfirmation (i.e., more self-stereotyping and poorer task perfor-\nmance). We did not expect a suggestion of sexism made by\nwomen to alter this situation. However, we expected less\nself-stereotyping and better task performance for participants\nwho were exposed to male sources who suggested that sex-\nism had taken place (Hypothesis 2).\nIn both studies, we also measured causal attributions for\nthe rejection (to lack of competence or to gender discrimina-\ntion). We did this to rule out the possibility that the effect of\nthe source of the suggestion of sexism on self-confidence\nand stereotype confirmation would relate to differential attri-\nbutions of the rejection to discrimination, due to the gender\nof the source. Indeed, we expected that in a context of subtle\nsexism, any cue that sexism might have taken place should\nmake such an attribution more likely, irrespective of the\nsource (Major et al., 2003). Thus, we expected that whether\nor not a suggestion of sexism was made would affect attribu-\ntional discounting, but this would not depend on the gender\nof the source of the suggestion (Hypothesis 3).\nIn Study 2, we additionally examined the likelihood that\nparticipants would file a complaint against the treatment\nreceived as a function of the manipulations. On one hand, as\nsocial support from ingroup members has been shown to be\nan important precursor of (collective) protest (Van Zomeren\net al., 2004), one might expect that a suggestion of sexism\nfrom female sources would make it more likely that partici-\npants would file a complaint than any other condition.\nHowever, because in the situation we examined the focus\nwas on individual outcomes against which a complaint could\nbe made, the possibility of collective protest was less salient.\nIn this type of context, one might also expect that partici-\npants would be more inclined to file a complaint when they\nfelt best about themselves and their abilities, and were the\nleast convinced that the stereotype of which they were target\nwas applicable to the self. If so, then one should expect that\nparticipants would file most complaints when a male source\nsuggested sexism. Prior research has shown that outgroup\nsources are likely to disapprove of complaints that discrimi-\nnation has taken place (Dodd, Giuliano, Boutell, & Moran,\nfrom making such claims in front of outgroup audiences\n(Stangor, Swim, Van Allen, & Sechrist, 2002; Swim &\nHyers, 1999). However, research so far has not contemplated\nthe possibility that this might be different when the sugges-\ntion that discrimination has taken place actually stems from\noutgroup members. Thus, a novel aspect of the present\nresearch is that we compare the effects of suggested sexism\nmade by male versus female sources.\nBefore reporting on the main studies, we describe a pilot\nstudy that was conducted to test whether the method we\ndeveloped to manipulate suggestions of sexism from male\nversus female sources would differ only in the extent to\nwhich these sources affect perceived pervasiveness of sex-\nism, and not in other relevant ways. It seemed particularly\nimportant to test whether the male and female sources were\nseen as equally credible and equally trustworthy. Also, given\nexisting research on the derogation of women who claim to\nbe targets of sexism (e.g., Dodd et al., 2001; Kaiser,\nHagiwara, Malahy, & Wilkins, 2009), we assessed whether\nmale and female sources would be differently evaluated, in\ngeneral, or seen as complainers, in particular. We did not\nexpect this to be the case because, differently from past\nresearch on this topic, the sources in this study were neither\nconfronting the perpetrator, nor making attributions for their\nown outcomes, but instead they were simply suggesting that\nsexism might have been a cause for the outcomes received\nby the female participant. Still, it seemed important to\ndirectly test whether or not this was the case.\nPilot Study\nA total of 61 Dutch females studying at Leiden University,\nthis online study. The study was programmed in an online\nsurvey tool designated as NetQ. Participants were approached\nby an experimenter and given the link to the online study if\nthey agreed to participate.\n4 SAGE Open\nParticipants read a vignette describing the context that\nwould be experienced by participants in the main study.\nParticipants imagined that they were taking part in a job\ninterview and subsequently received a negative feedback.\nParticipants then imagined that they met three other candi-\ndates who told them that they thought that the interviewer\nmight be sexist and that the participants' rejection might\nhave been due to sexism. For half of the participants, the\nsource of sexism was three other women, while for the\nremaining participants the source was three men. Participants\nthen answered a range of questions about this vignette.\nSpecifically, participants indicated the percentage of men\nthey estimated to be sexist in Dutch society. Participants also\nindicated what they thought of the three males/females who\nsuggested that sexism might have been the cause of the rejec-\ntion: their general evaluation of the sources, the extent to\nwhich they were credible, the extent to which their com-\nments reflected what they really thought, and the extent to\nwhich they saw them as trustworthy, sincere, honest, prob-\nlematic, difficult, or complainers (all responses were made\non 7-point rating scales ranging from 1 = not at all to 7 = very\nmuch, unless otherwise indicated). Analyses of mean differ-\nences with t tests for independent samples revealed only one\nreliable difference between the male and female sources:\nWhen the suggestion of sexism stemmed from a female\nsource, participants estimated that the majority of Dutch men\nsignificantly when sexism was suggested by male sources\nfemale sources were thus seen as equally credible (overall\nas reflecting what they really thought to an equal extent\nmanipulation of source of sexism and adds as control a con-\ndition where the sources do not mention that sexism might\nhave played a role in their rejection.\nMethod\nDesign and participants. The study consisted of a 2 (Sugges-\ntion of sexism: yes. vs. no) \u00d7 2 (Gender of source of the sug-\ngestion: male vs. female) between-participants factorial\ndesign. Participants were 78 female students at Leiden Uni-\nversity with a mean age of 21. Each session of the experi-\nment lasted approximately 40 min, after which all participants\nwere fully debriefed and received 4 Euros (approximately\nUS$5.50) for their participation.\nProcedure.All participants were seated in separate cubicles\nand were equipped with personal computers. We used a\nbogus job-interview paradigm in which participants were\nasked to act as though they were being interviewed for a job\nto help us train interviewers (see also Cihangir, Barreto, &\nEllemers, 2010). After the computer made a (simulated) con-\nnection with the interviewer but prior to the interview, some\npersonal information about the interviewer was provided to\nthe participant (Last name and title: Drs. Zomeren; 30 years\nold). Next, participants received the 10 interview questions,\nwhich indirectly referred to the participants' gender identity\n(e.g., do you dress yourself attractively to influence other\npeople?). Once the interview was finished, the interviewer\nindicated that some time was needed to decide whether the\nparticipant in question would be selected. While they osten-\nsibly waited for the interviewer's decision, we told the par-\nticipant that she could use the computer to chat about the\ninterview with three other participants who allegedly partici-\npated in the same interview procedure. We used three com-\nmon Dutch female names in the condition where the source\nwas female and three common Dutch male names in the con-\ndition where the source was male. Participants were then\nasked to enter their names into a login screen. Next, they saw\nthree other names and their own name appearing below a\nscreen, which contained a chat room. We manipulated the\npresence versus absence of a suggestion of sexism by pre-\nprogramming what the three other alleged participants said.\nIn the condition where others suggested sexism, the mes-\nsages made clear that the others \"disliked the interview pro-\ncedure because it was placing women at a disadvantage,\"\n\"disliked the interviewer who seemed to be unfriendly\ntoward women,\" and \"thought the interview questions were\nnot appropriate for women who were applying for the posi-\ntion.\" In the condition where no suggestion of sexism was\nmade, the others indicated that they \"approved of the inter-\nview procedure because it seemed appropriate,\" \"considered\nthe interviewer to be an experienced person to conduct this\nkind of interview,\" and \"found the interview questions appro-\npriate for selecting people for this kind of position.\" In both\nconditions, we also included information in the messages\nthat was unrelated to the selection procedure (e.g., \"I feel like\nhaving a coffee, anyone joining me when this is finished?\"),\nto increase credibility and to avoid suspicion about the goals\nof the study. After three rounds of information exchange, the\nsession was ended and the participants were asked to answer\nsome questions about the other people with whom they had\nsupposedly been chatting. This included some filler ques-\ntions and questions that were meant to check for the effec-\ntiveness of the manipulation of the suggestion of sexism.\nNext, we told participants that the interviewer had come to a\ndecision and the connection with the interviewer was\nrenewed. In all conditions, the interviewer told participants,\n\"I am sorry to inform you that you are not selected. You did\nnot answer the crucial questions properly.\" We used this\nambiguous rejection on the basis of gender-biased interview\nquestions in all conditions to induce subtle sexism (see\nCihangir et al., 2010). After participants read that they were\nCihangir et al. 5\nrejected, the connection with the interviewer was supposedly\nterminated, and the participants were asked to answer a set of\nquestions about the interview procedure (manipulation\nchecks and dependent variables). We explained that these\nquestions could serve to improve the selection procedure,\nassured participants that neither the interviewer nor the other\ninterviewees could see their answers, and urged them to\nrespond honestly to all questions.\nDependent variables. All responses were made on 7-point rat-\ning scales ranging from (1) not at all to (7) very much, unless\notherwise indicated. We checked for the effectiveness of the\nmanipulation of the suggestion of sexism by asking partici-\npants to what degree others were critical of the interviewer,\nof the interview procedure, and of the interview questions\n(last item recoded;  = .99). To check the effectiveness of the\nsource manipulation, we asked participants to indicate the\ngender of the other interviewees with whom they had been\nchatting. Participants' own attributions to discrimination\nwere measured with four items (the selection decision that\nwas made was the result of gender discrimination, this selec-\ntion procedure disadvantages women, there was clearly dis-\ncrimination in this procedure, the selection made was due to\nprejudiced questions,  = .91), and attributions to (lack of)\npersonal competence were measured with two items (the\nselection decision that was made was due to my perfor-\nmance/to my competence, r = .39, p = <.001). A principal\ncomponents analysis confirmed that attributions to discrimi-\nnation and attributions to personal competence loaded on dif-\nferent factors that together explained 76.32% of variance in\nthe individual items (all items loaded at least .82 on their\nrespective factor).\nThe measurement of self-handicapping is best achieved,\nif it refers to an upcoming task. Accordingly, we first\ninformed participants that we were interested in ascertaining\nto what extent the interviewer had made a correct decision\nand that they would be asked to perform an additional task\nto help us do that (see also Cihangir et al., 2010). We told\nparticipants that we needed some information about them-\nselves before they could start working on the task. The ques-\ntions for additional information contained the\nself-handicapping and self-stereotyping measures. Self-\nhandicapping was measured with 12 items adapted from\nconsisted of items such as \"I am nervous about the upcom-\ning test,\" \"I am easily distracted during this type of test,\" or\n\"I am hungry\" ( = .80). The self-stereotyping measure con-\nsisted of nine female stereotypical traits, which were adapted\nfrom the Dutch version of the Bem sex roles inventory\nfollows: dependent, considerate, understanding, indecisive,\nemotional, over-sensitive, romantic, sentimental, and caring\n( = .68). Once participants had answered these questions\nthe experiment ended, participants were debriefed and com-\npensated for their participation.\nResults\nUnless otherwise indicated, all variables were analyzed with\na 2 (Suggestion of sexism: yes vs. no) \u00d7 2 (Gender of source\nof suggestion of sexism: male vs. female) between-\nparticipants ANOVA.\nManipulation checks.Participants indicated that the three\nother interviewees were more critical of the procedure, the\ninterviewer, and the interview questions when they sug-\n=\n.96. All participants (100%) correctly indicated the gender of\nother interviewees with whom they had been chatting. The\nmanipulation of the suggestion of sexism and the manipula-\ntion of gender of source can thus be considered successful.\nAttributions. Participant's own attributions of the outcome to\ndiscrimination and to (lack of) personal competence were\nanalyzed with a MANOVA. This analysis revealed a multi-\nvariate main effect of the suggestion of sexism, F(2, 73) =\n= .27, which at the univariate level was\nreliable for both dependent variables. As expected, partici-\npants attributed their rejection more to gender discrimination\n= .13. Also, participants attributed their\nrejection less to (lack of) personal competence when others\np\n= .16. Importantly, as predicted in Hypothesis 3, these\neffects were not qualified by an interaction with the source of\nthe suggestion. In line with prior work in this area (e.g.,\nMajor et al., 2003), we also examined the extent to which\nparticipants discounted their personal responsibility by sub-\ntracting attributions to lack of personal competence from\nattributions to gender discrimination. Higher scores on this\nmeasure therefore indicate greater discounting. Discounting\nwas also only reliably affected by the manipulation of others'\nscores were reliably above 0 when others suggested discrimi-\nto 0 (suggesting uncertainty about the cause of the rejection)\nwhen others did not suggest gender discrimination (M =\nSelf-handicapping. We submitted the self-handicapping mea-\nsure to a between-participants ANOVA. This analysis\nrevealed only a reliable two-way interaction between the two\nthe means, as well as the simple effects.As indicated in Table\n1, and as predicted in Hypothesis 1, participants self-handi-\ncapped less when men suggested discrimination than when\nwomen did so. Also, whereas a suggestion of sexism by\nfemale sources led to more self-handicapping than when\n6 SAGE Open\nfemale sources did not suggest sexism (an effect akin to that\nfound by Adams et al., 2006, on a different measure), the\nopposite was found when the sources were male: A sugges-\ntion of sexism by male sources led to less self-handicapping\nthan when the male sources did not suggest sexism.\nSelf-stereotyping. AnANOVAon this measure only revealed a\nreliable interaction between the two factors, F(1, 74) = 7.47,\n= .09. Inspection of means and simple effects\n(see Table 1) indicates that, as predicted in Hypothesis 2, par-\nticipants self-stereotyped less when a male source suggested\ndiscrimination than when a female source suggested discrim-\nination. There was no such source effect when there was no\nsuggestion of discrimination. Moreover, when the source\nwas female a suggestion of sexism led to more self-stereo-\ntyping than when no such suggestion was made, whereas\nwhen the source was male, a suggestion of sexism led to less\nself-stereotyping than when no suggestion of sexism was\nmade. Although this is consistent with our reasoning that a\nsuggestion of sexism made by female versus male sources\ncan have quite different and even opposite effects, these two\nsimple effects were only marginally reliable (in both cases,\nDiscussion\nIn line with our hypotheses, the results of this study indicate\nthat the effect of a suggestion of sexism on self-confidence\nand stereotype confirmation is moderated by the gender of\nthe source of this suggestion. When men suggested that sex-\nism had taken place, participants reported less self-handicap-\nping and less self-stereotyping than when the same suggestion\nwas made by female sources. Also, consistent with the find-\nings reported by Adams et al. (2006), a suggestion of sexism\nby a female source was even counter-productive, leading to\nmore self-handicapping and more self-stereotyping than\nwhen no such suggestion was made. A novel contribution of\nthe present research is that a suggestion of sexism by a male\nsource had self-protective effects, in that it led to less self-\nhandicapping and less self-stereotyping than no suggestion\nof sexism--although admittedly this contrast was only mar-\nginally reliable for self-stereotyping.\nIt is also important to note that a suggestion of sexism (vs.\nno suggestion) was equally influential of participants' attri-\nbutions, irrespective of the gender of the source. That is, the\neffect of the gender of the source of the suggestion cannot be\nattributed to a heightened (or reduced) awareness that sex-\nism might have taken place. Instead, we propose that a sug-\ngestion of sexism can provide targets with an opportunity to\nprotect their self-confidence but only when it is accompanied\nby the demonstration that male hostility toward women is not\ninevitable. While prior research has shown a similar effect by\nvarying the extent to which sexism was described as rare or\nresearch shows that the impact of people's exposure to an\nidentical sexist treatment can also differ, depending on who\nacknowledges the possibility of sexism.\nAlthough our focus in this study was on how source modi-\nfies the effects of a suggestion of sexism, we included as\ncontrol two conditions in which male or female sources did\nnot suggest that sexism might have been a cause for the\nrejection. We found an inversion of the source effect in these\nconditions, such that female participants self-handicapped\nand self-stereotyped to a greater extent when the others were\nmales than when they were females. Although at first sight\nthis might seem inconsistent with prior research on stereo-\ntype threat, it is important to note that this study was not\ndesigned to test stereotype threat effects, so it does not\ninclude the standard \"no threat\" condition which makes such\ncomparisons possible. Indeed, gender stereotypes were made\nsalient in all conditions, through the gender-biased interview\nquestions used by the interviewer. Instead, the pattern we\nfound is in fact consistent with prior research, showing that\nthe mere presence of men can be threatening for women, as\nthey anticipate being devalued by them--as long as there is\nno explicit information to contradict this (e.g., Inzlicht &\nlead to lower self-confidence and poorer performance com-\npared with a situation in which no men are present. This\nexplanation and findings of prior research are consistent with\nthe source effects we obtained in this research when no sug-\ngestion of sexism was made. Importantly however, these\nprocesses emerge due to the inferences women make about\nmen's attitudes toward them when more concrete informa-\ntion about their attitudes is lacking. Consequently, such\ninferences become irrelevant when participants are explicitly\ntold what the male sources really think--in our research, this\nwas the case when the men present suggested that sexism\nmay have taken place.\nStudy 2 was designed to replicate and extend Study 1 with a\nslightly different experimental manipulation and additional\nmeasures. In Study 1, we compared what happened when\nTable 1.

In\nStudy 2, sexism was mentioned in all conditions, but it was\neither suggested that sexism had played a role or that it had\nnot. This allows us to further examine whether merely men-\ntioning sexism might lead to self-protective effects (by rais-\ning awareness that it is a possible cause of the negative\noutcome), or whether the effects observed indeed depend on\nother people's suggestions as to whether or not sexism may\nhave played a role (the way others judge the situation), as\nwell as whether these others are male or female, as we pre-\ndicted. An additional goal of Study 2 was to relate these\nnovel findings to two indicators of self-confidence and of\nstereotype confirmation that are commonly used in this lit-\nerature: personal self-esteem and task performance. As in\nStudy 1, we expected to find less self-handicapping and\nhigher self-esteem (as indicators of self-confidence,\nHypothesis 1) but also less self-stereotyping and better task\nperformance (as indicators of stereotype (dis-)confirmation,\nHypothesis 2) when a suggestion of sexism is made by male\nsources than when it is made by female sources.\nSimilar to Study 1, we expected more attributions to dis-\ncrimination and less attributions to personal failure when\nothers suggest sexism than when others deny sexist treat-\nment, and anticipated that this would occur regardless of\nwho makes this suggestion (Hypothesis 3). Finally, we\nexamined the extent to which participants would file a com-\nplaint against their treatment, as an additional indicator of\nhow others'suggestions affect the way targets respond to dis-\ncriminatory treatment.\nMethod\nDesign and participants. The study followed a 2 (Suggestion\nof sexism: yes vs. no) \u00d7 2 (Gender of the source of the sug-\ngestion of sexism: male vs. female) between-participants\nfactorial design. Participants were 90 female students at\nLeiden University with a mean age of 20. Each session of the\nexperiment lasted approximately 45 min, after which all par-\nticipants were fully debriefed and received 4.50 Euros\n(approximately US$6.22) for their participation.\nProcedure. The procedure of this study was identical to that\nof Study 1, except that in the \"no suggestion of sexism\" con-\ndition instead of others simply approving of the procedure,\nthey explicitly indicated that no sexism had taken place. Spe-\ncifically, in this condition others allegedly indicated that they\n\"liked the interview procedure because the procedure was\nwell designed for women as well as for men,\" that they \"liked\nthe interviewer who seemed to be friendly towards women,\"\nand that \"the interview questions seemed appropriate for\nwomen who were applying for the position.\"\nDependent measures.All responses were made on 7-point\nrating scales ranging from (1) not at all to (7) very much. The\neffectiveness of the manipulations was checked with the\nsame items as in Study 1 (three item checked the manipula-\ntion of others' comments,  = .97 and one item checked the\ngender of the source). The same scales as in Study 1 were\nused to measure attributions (attributions to discrimination:\n = .94; attributions to [lack of] personal competence: r =\nWe used an abbreviated version of the self-handicapping\nscale used in Study 1 (five items;  = .64) and the same self-\nstereotyping scale as in Study 1 ( = .68). We measured per-\nformance state self-esteem (PSSE) with items from the\nHeatherton and Polivy (1991) State Performance Self-\nEsteem subscale ( = .80). We assessed performance in an\nIQ-test consisting of 15 items that were selected from exist-\ning IQ-test questions. All participants received 10 min to\ncomplete the task. We stressed that this performance task\nwould help us evaluate the decision of the interviewer and\nthat their performance on this task would potentially enable\nthe participant to be selected despite the interviewers' deci-\nsion. After they finished this task (or after the time allotted\nfor this task had elapsed), we presented participants with a\nbinary choice to communicate whether or not they wanted to\nfile a complaint against the selection decision (\"Yes, I wish\nto complain\" or \"No, I do not wish to complain\"). At this\nstage, participants who indicated a wish to file a complaint\nwere actually provided the opportunity to do so by complet-\ning and submitting a message indicating their protest about\nthe interview procedure via the computer. That is, partici-\npants were given the chance to complain at the very end of\nthe study, after having responded to all other questions and\nperformed the task. The possibility to file a complaint was\nnot mentioned to participants before they reached this final\nstage of the study. Participants who did not file a complaint\nwere given the score 0, while participants who submitted a\ncomplaint were given the score 1.\nResults\nAll variables were analyzed with a 2 (Suggestion of sexism:\nyes vs. no) \u00d7 2 (Source: male vs. female) between-partici-\npants (multivariate) ANOVA, unless otherwise indicated.\nManipulation check. Participants reported that the three other\ninterviewees were more satisfied with the procedure, with\nthe interviewer, and with the interview questions when they\n= .92. All participants correctly indicated the\ngender of the other interviewees with whom they had been\nchatting. The manipulation of the suggestion of sexism and\nthe manipulation of source of influence can be considered\nsuccessful.\nAttributions. We submitted attributions to discrimination and\nattributions to personal competence to a between-partici-\npants MANOVA. These analyses revealed a multivariate\n8 SAGE Open\n2 = .17, which at the univariate level was only\n2 = .17, and not to attributions to personal com-\nconsistent with the results of Study 1, participants attributed\ntheir rejection more to gender discrimination when others\nscore also revealed that discounting was only reliably\naffected by the manipulation of others'comments, F(1, 86) =\n= .13. Discounting scores were reliably\nabove 0 when others suggested discrimination (M = 2.02,\nuncertainty about the cause of the rejection) when others did\nStudy 1 and in line with Hypothesis 3, these main effects\nwere not qualified by gender of the source.\nSelf-handicapping and PSSE. The two indicators of self-confi-\ndence were analyzed with a between-participants MANOVA,\nwhich only revealed a reliable interaction between the two\n= .09. At the univariate\nlevel, this interaction was reliable for both measures, self-\n= .09. Inspection of means and\nsimple effects (Table 2) confirmed that female participants\nself-handicapped reliably more when women suggested sex-\nism than when men suggested sexism, whereas there was no\neffect of source when no suggestion of sexism was made. In\naddition, when the source was female, a suggestion of sex-\nism led to (marginally) more self-handicapping than when no\nsuggestion of sexism was made. No other contrasts were reli-\nable for this measure.\nWith regard to self-esteem, the results show that female\nparticipants reported reliably lower self-esteem when women\nsuggested sexism than when men suggested sexism, whereas\nthere was no effect of source when no suggestion of sexism\nwas made (see Table 2 for the means and the indication of the\nreliability of simple effects). In addition, when the source\nwas female, a suggestion of sexism led to lower self-esteem\nthan when no suggestion of sexism was made, whereas when\nthe source was male a suggestion of sexism led to higher\nself-esteem than when no suggestion was made. This is con-\nsistent with our hypotheses and with the results of Study 1.\nSelf-stereotyping and task performance. We submitted the two\nstereotype confirmation measures to a between-participants\nMANOVA. This analysis only revealed a multivariate inter-\np\n= .09. At the univariate level, this effect was reliable for\np\nInspection of means and simple effects (see Table 2) revealed\nthat when discrimination was suggested by men, female par-\nticipants reported lower levels of self-stereotyping than when\nit was suggested by women, while when sexism was not sug-\ngested, the gender of the source did not affect self-stereotyp-\ning. No other contrasts were reliable for this measure.\nWith regard to task performance, the results showed that\nwhen men suggested sexism, female participants showed\nreliably better task performance than when women made the\nsame suggestion, while there was no such effect of source\nwhen sexism was not suggested (see Table 2 for means and\nsimple effects). In addition, when the source was male, a\nsuggestion of sexism led to better performance than when no\nsuggestion of sexism was made. No other contrasts were reli-\nable for this measure.\nFiling a complaint.Logistic regression on the dichotomous\nscores of complaints filed revealed a reliable interaction\nbetween the suggestion of sexism and gender of source, B =\ngested sexism, participants were more likely to file a com-\nplaint than when women did so, B = -1.59, Wald's 2(1, N =\ngender of the source when sexism was not suggested, B =\nmore complaints if a male source suggested than if it did not\nsuggest sexism, although this was only marginally reliable,\nfemale source suggested or did not suggest, sexism did not\naffect the extent to which complaints were filled, B = -.74,\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study replicate and extend the results of\nStudy 1 with a slightly different procedure and additional\nmeasures. In line with Hypotheses 1 and 2, the results again\nindicate that a suggestion of sexism from a male source has\nmore beneficial effects on targets than a suggestion of sexism\nTable 2.

This study established this effect on\nthe same variables used in Study 1 to assess self-confidence\nand stereotype confirmation but also extended it to two addi-\ntional indicators that are commonly studied in this literature:\npersonal state performance self-esteem and task perfor-\nmance. When male sources suggested that participants might\nhave been targets of sexism, participants self-handicapped\nless, reported higher personal state performance self-esteem,\nself-stereotyped less, and performed better than when the\nexact same suggestion was made by female sources. Because\nthis study compared the suggestion of sexism with a condi-\ntion in which the possibility of sexism was also mentioned\nbut rejected by others, this provides further evidence that the\neffects observed are indeed caused by other people's judg-\nments of the situation\u00adnot by the mere fact that targets are\nmade aware of the possibility of sexism.\nIn a different way, in line with the findings of Study 1 and\nthose reported by Adams et al. (2006), our findings also indi-\ncate that a suggestion of sexism by a female source can even\nbe counter-productive as it lowers self-esteem and (margin-\nally) increases self-handicapping. Again, new to this article\nbut in replication of what we found in Study 1, a suggestion\nof sexism by male sources had quite the opposite effect,\nincreasing self-esteem and improving task performance,\ncompared with when no suggestion of sexism was made.\nAs in Study 1, gender of source did not affect causal attri-\nbutions, or attributional discounting, which only depended\non whether or not a suggestion of sexism was made. Again,\nthis excludes the possibility that the effects observed are\ndriven by differences in participants' own perceptions of the\nsituation, in line with our reasoning. Importantly, this study\nalso extended the findings of Study 1 by showing that targets\nwere most likely to file a complaint about the way they were\ntreated when they had heard a suggestion of sexism from a\nmale source. This supports the idea that when male sources\nsuggest sexist treatment, this creates an environment where\nsexism is condemned and complaints of sexism are not nec-\nessarily frowned upon (Blanchard et al., 1994). In such cir-\ncumstances, female targets are less likely to expect to endure\nsocial costs for filing their complaints. This is not communi-\ncated when a female source suggests that sexism has taken\nplace because women's reactions are not the ones that are\nfeared by female targets of sexism (Dodd et al., 2001; Kaiser\nGeneral Discussion\nSuggestions of sexism have the potential both to harm and to\nprotect their targets. Whether one or the other effect will take\nplace is likely to depend on a range of variables (see Major et\nal., 2003, for a review). The studies reported in this article\nextend prior research by indicating that when others suggest\nsexism may have played a role, this can have different effects\ndepending on whether these others are men or women.\nResults of a pilot study showed that a suggestion of sexism\nmade by men led to lower perceived pervasiveness of sexism\nthan a suggestion of sexism made by women. Importantly,\nmale sources of a suggestion of sexism were not perceived\ndifferently than female sources on a range of measures tap-\nping into their credibility, trustworthiness, general evalua-\ntion, and impression as difficult, problematic, or complainers.\nMoreover, the results of the main studies show that a sugges-\ntion of sexism from male sources was associated with higher\nself-confidence and less stereotype confirmation, than when\nthe very same suggestion was made by female sources. This\nis consistent with the proposition that a suggestion of sexism\nintroduces a social identity threat that includes the idea that\nmen are generally hostile toward women (Adams et al.,\n2006). If this is indeed true, then such a threat should be\nreduced when there is evidence that men can instead be allies\nagainst sexism. This is what happens when a male source\nsuggests that a female might have been the target of sexism.\nIn this situation, the threat experienced by the suggestion of\nsexism must be measured against the potential this sugges-\ntion has to protect target's self-confidence. When the sugges-\ntionstemmedfrommalesources,ourparticipantsexperienced\na lift in self-confidence compared with when the suggestion\nwas made by female sources. This is also what happened in\nearlier studies when gender discrimination was either\ndescribed as rare or as pervasive: Although discrimination\ndescribed as pervasive was mainly harmful, targets were\nwilling to reap the benefit of discrimination that was\ndescribed as rare to protect their self-image (e.g., Schmitt et\nthis past research because instead of varying how discrimina-\ntion was described, we merely varied who suggested that it\nmight have taken place.\nIt is important to note that self-confidence and stereotype\nconfirmation were neither affected by any main effects of the\ngroup membership of the source, nor by main effects of the\nsuggestion of sexism, but only revealed reliable interactions\nbetween the two factors. This is consistent with our theoreti-\ncal reasoning and rules out the possibility that results might\nhave been simply due to effects of gender of source on\nsalience of gender identity or of the suggestion of sexism on\ngeneralized mood.\nThese studies also extend past research by illuminating\nsome of the factors that might facilitate complaints of dis-\ncrimination. At first sight, this finding may seem inconsistent\nwith work showing that support from fellow ingroup mem-\nbers is an important factor in people's decision to engage in\nprotest (Klandermans, 1997). However, this previous work\nfocused on engagement in collective protest and participa-\ntion in the activities of political interest groups, which is dif-\nferent from the situation we studied. Notably, we studied a\njob-interview context in which people only are informed\nabout their individual treatment and individual outcomes,\nand where collective action was not an option. In such situa-\ntions occurring in real life, participants could individually\nfile a complaint if they did not agree with the way they were\ntreated. Thus, our findings complement prior work: Whereas\nsupport from other ingroup members may facilitate partici-\npation in collective protest, the current results suggest that\nsupport from the outgroup may help people protest against\ntheir individual treatment. This extends past evidence show-\ning that people are reluctant to report the discrimination of\nwhich they are target (e.g., Swim & Hyers, 1999), especially\nto outgroup members (Sechrist, Swim, & Stangor, 2004),\nand that this is likely to be linked to the social costs that are\nassociated with making such claims, particularly to members\nWe found that our female participants were most likely to file\na complaint when they heard male sources suggest that they\nmight have been targets of sexism than when they heard\nfemale sources make the same suggestion. Thus, female tar-\ngets were more likely to file complaints of discrimination,\nwhen it was clear that at least some outgroup members would\nbe likely to support their claims. This suggests that social\nsupport from dominant group members may be just as impor-\ntant as social support from ingroup members (the latter illus-\ntrated, for example, by Van Zomeren et al., 2004)--albeit for\ndifferent reasons--and underlines the important role of out-\ngroup allies in promoting social change.\nThere are admittedly some limitations to this research.\nFirst, although the manipulation of gender of source (male\nvs. female) is rather self-evident, the effects obtained are\nlikely to stem from expectations about the prevalence of sex-\nism that were only measured in the pilot study. As such, it\nwas not possible to test their mediating role. Now that we\nhave established that male versus female sources have a dif-\nferent impact on the way targets respond to sexism, future\nresearch can further investigate the mediating processes\nassociated with these differential effects. Second, our\nresearch only presented the opinion of a relatively small\n(three individuals) group of males versus females, who were\npresent in the same context. While this type of situation is\nlikely to occur in real life (e.g., with one's direct colleagues\ncommenting on events and decisions in the workplace), it is\nalso possible that similar comments are voiced by a single\nindividual (e.g., one's partner or best friend), by mixed gen-\nder sources (where people might be particularly sensitive to\nthe opinion of males present in this group), or by larger\ngroups of people who form their opinion based on the\naccount provided by the target instead of witnessing the situ-\nation themselves. Future research might explore whether the\nsuggestion of sexism can also impact on targets' responses\nwhen voiced by these different types of sources. Finally, it is\nimportant to note that these studies focused on a situation of\nsubtle sexism, and our findings must be understood in this\ncontext. We think that this is valid, because this is the type of\nsexism that is currently most prevalent and also most perni-\ncious in the effects it has on its targets. Nevertheless, future\nresearch might examine whether similar effects are obtained\nwhen a suggestion of sexism appears less plausible, or\nwhether targets' responses are equally dependent on the\nopinions of others when the occurrence of sexism is more\nunambiguous. In addition, the targets in the current study\nwere female university students who faced gender discrimi-\nnation despite their educational qualifications. Replications\nof the current effects in other contexts with targets from dif-\nferent social backgrounds could improve the robustness and\nvalidity of our effects in other types of situations where sex-\nism might play a role. Also, the current study focused on\ngender of the source as an explanatory variable of interest.\nFuture research might additionally examine other explana-\ntory variables that might moderate the impact of suggesting\nsexist treatment, such as prior career experiences of the tar-\nget, or social support received from family or friends (see\nBarreto, Ellemers, Cihangir, & Stroebe, 2009; Schmitt,\nBranscombe, Postmes, & Garcia, in press, for a meta analytic\nreview on the effects of perceived discrimination on\nwell-being).\nIn sum, this research demonstrates that men can constitute\nimportant allies against sexism not only because perpetrators\nare more likely to feel bad about their sexist beliefs when\nconfronted by males (as documented by Czopp & Monteith,\n2003) but also because a suggestion of sexism from male\nsources is more beneficial for its targets and potentially more\ninstrumental in reducing gender inequalities.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAdams, G., Garcia, D.
