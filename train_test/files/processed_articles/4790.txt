His public failure model supports\nthe use of efficient market processes--to create Public\nValue--by managers until these market dynamics reach the\npoint of creating public failure (i.e., unethical organizational\nand social outcomes). Shareef (2010) calls this the market\nefficiency/public failure model.\nAs such, some scholars see the Public Value framework as\na model of Ghoshal's (2005) intellectual pluralism, that is,\nthe sharing of normative management processes that chal-\nlenge the influence of the non-normative Chicago School of\nEconomics in MBA education and the broader social sci-\nPublic Value construct (a) offers a tipping point for both\nMPA and MBA students to determine when efficient market\nprocess stops and public failure begins and (b) can be used as\na replacement paradigm for the Chicago School's non-nor-\nmative organizational economics in triggering a transforma-\ntion of the MBA curriculum. Likewise, Moore and Khagram\n(2004) contend the Public Value construct should be used to\nenhance the teaching of Corporate Social Responsibility\n(CSR) in MBA programs.\nSince the beginning of the decade, there has been a\ndemand in the management literature (Ghoshal, 2005;\nTsui, 2013) for a shift from both public and private organiza-\ntions using economic efficiency as the sole determinant of\ninstitutional success to a value system where ethics and effi-\nciency are co-equal determinants in assessing organizational\nperformance. The evolution of efficiency and ethics becom-\ning the criteria of institutional success has followed Kanter's\nzation change process. Kanter (2005) argues that organiza-\ntion change is often predicated on ideas that are outliers in\none period of time and later become mainstream as a result of\ndemands placed on intellectuals (i.e., knowledge producers)\nby social actors (i.e., knowledge consumers) because of rap-\nidly changing environmental events.

At any one time, some are\ncore, some are peripheral. Much of the change involves nothing\nreally new--just bringing peripheral tendencies to the core.\nOrganization ethics, relegated to the periphery of man-\nagement thought because of the triumph of market capital-\nism over socialism in the early 1980s, has now become the\ncore of management thought because of 21st-century corpo-\ntive frameworks are now at the core of management theory\nand practice. She describes the four types of organizations\nnow operating in the global economy: (a) classic for-profit\nFriedman-model firms that are primarily concerned with\neconomic objectives; (b) some for-profit firms where eco-\nnomics is still the primary objective but social responsibility\nis a second-place contender; (c) social enterprises where both\nsocial responsibility and economic objectives are primary;\nand (d) charity-based non-profits which have social respon-\nsibility as their primary objective and economics as a sec-\nondary objective necessary for survival. She sees accelerated\ninterdisciplinary movement from the Friedman model to\nsocial entrepreneurial enterprises and notes these organiza-\ntions feature both social responsibility and economics in\nassessing performance success.\nConsequently, the call to utilize Public Value's market\nefficiency/public failure criteria to analyze the efficiency and\nethical outcomes in legal studies'antitrust field fits with both\ndemand-side change constructs. The Harvard School's pub-\nlic interest approach has been largely dislodged by the\nChicago School's economic analysis paradigm over the past\nscholars have been searching for a mid-range theory in the\nantitrust field between Harvard's non-diagnostic public\ninterest framework and the \"endless empirical inquiry of the\ngests the Public Value framework provides such a mid-range\ntheory in the legal studies discipline to assess the normative\noutcomes of cases--using Stiglitz's (2001) asymmetrical\ninformation/market failure model--like the U.S. Supreme\nCourt's 2013 ruling in Association for Molecular Pathology\nv. Myriad Genetics.\nThe research question explored in this article asks the fol-\nlowing: Using Stiglitz's asymmetrical information/market\nfailure assessment model, did the U.S. Supreme Court's rul-\ning in the Myriad case trigger public failure?\nThe article proceeds as follows. First, an overview of the\nPublic Value model is offered. The following section dis-\ncusses (a) the battle for paradigm dominance in legal studies'\nantitrust law between the Harvard School's public interest\napproach and the Chicago School's economic analysis\nframework and (b) how the Public Value construct can serve\nas a mid-range theory in quick look antitrust cases. A discus-\nsion of Joseph Stiglitz's asymmetrical information/market\nfailure construct is then presented. Next, the U.S. Supreme\nCourt's recent ruling in the Myriad case is assessed for Public\nValue criteria and against Stiglitz's asymmetrical informa-\ntion model. The Conclusion section summarizes key findings\nconcerning the sociology of knowledge-based paradigm shift\nfrom Friedman-type profit maximization firms to organiza-\ntions where efficiency and social welfare are co-determinants\nof organizational and the role Public Value is playing in this\ntransformation.\nPublic Value: An Overview1\nBozeman's seminal 2002 Public Administration Review arti-\ncle on Public Value outlines the praxis relationship between\npublic and economic value. His construct of public value\nfailure parallels economics'market failure concept and spec-\nifies criteria to determine achievement of Public Value or\ndiagnosis of public failure:\nMy goal is to develop a model that is analogous in many respects\nto market failure, but that eschews concerns for price efficiency\nand traditional utilitarianism in favor of a public-value focus. I\npresent a public-value-failure model that, like the market failure\nmodel, includes criteria for diagnosing public failure (and\nHe argues that one of the primary triggers for both market\nand public failure is imperfect information between buyer\nBozeman (2002) sees his Public Value construct as a mid-\nrange theory: \"In this article, I seek a `middle-range concep-\ntualization'of public value, one pertaining to a wide range of\npolicy and public-value domains, but at the same time\nanchored by diagnostic criteria\" (p. 146). He lists seven cri-\nteria that lead to public failure: mechanisms for articulating\nand aggregating values, imperfect monopolies, benefit\nhoarding, scarcity of providers, short time horizon, substitut-\nability versus conservation of resources, and threats to sub-\nsistence and human dignity (Bozeman, 2002). Bozeman\n(2002) calls threats to dignity and subsistence \"The Greatest\nPublic Failure\" (p. 154). In sum, when either market or pub-\nlic management efficiencies violate any of these diagnostic\nnorms, public failure has occurred.\nShareef (2010) calls Bozeman's construct the market effi-\nciency/public failure model as Bozeman (2002) accepts the\neconomic assumption that market efficiency, in which prices\nact as a coordinating mechanism, is an effective framework\nto facilitate public agency delivery of goods and services.\nYet, Bozeman's (2002) analysis also recognizes that often\n\"prices lie\" (p. 146). His model encourages managers to\nengage in efficient market activities but articulates the public\nfailure criteria tipping points to prevent market efficiency\nfrom leading to public failure (Shareef, 2010).\nBozeman (2007) especially believes that the Public Value\nconstruct has a role to play when determining the value of\nscientific knowledge. He argues that economic criteria are\ninsufficient for valuing scientific knowledge as this form of\nknowledge has many types of value and is broadly used in\nthe public domain: \"Economists refer to this application\nrobustness as the `public goods characteristics of knowledge'\nbut \" . . . with the failures of market-based theories.\"2 Shareef\nbelieve that creation of Public Value enhances the social\nlegitimacy and political support of business enterprises,\nespecially those that operate in intensely political environ-\nments. Moore and Khagram (2004) specifically link social\nand political legitimacy with CSR. They note that contempo-\nrary corporate strategy focuses on competition in markets\nwith the goal of maximizing shareholder wealth.\nConsequently, private sector entities tend to see customers,\ninvestors, and shareholders as providing legitimacy and\nsupport.\nHowever, Moore and Khagram (2004) point out that busi-\nness organizations are not immune to the social context--or\nsocial costs--of their operating environment:\nThe reason is simply that leaders and managers have substantial\nde jure and de facto discretion in setting the strategy of the firm.\nThey can choose to accommodate or strain against the external\nforces that society has erected around them. . . . There are prices\nto be paid for these decisions. As part of developing corporate\nstrategy, a firm has to weigh the consequences of acting or\nfailing to act in accord with the legal, moral, or practical\nstandards that society has constructed for them--either through\nlaw, or through the social expectations backed by the threat of\neconomic or political damage if they do not comply. In short, the\nfirm has to be concerned about the social and political legitimacy\nof its strategy as well as its economic potential. (p. 17)\nMoore and Khagram (2004) suggest that business firms\ndevelop expertise in creating and measuring Public Value as\na means of developing social and political legitimacy. In\naddition, Moore (1995) contends his mutually influencing\nstrategic triangle--Public Value/Organizational Capacities/\nLegitimacy and Support--provides a framework for busi-\nness strategists to generate social and political support for\ntheir enterprises. Importantly, Moore and Khagram (2004)\nbelieve this societal legitimacy can only come from public\nagencies:\nYet, this important work has been left off the map in most\ndiscussions of corporate strategy. It is the kind of work that\ncould come to the fore and be more successfully integrated into\nstrategic business thinking if it was better understood that\nbusiness more systematically needed to develop legitimacy and\nsupport from stakeholders beyond investors and customers and\nunderstood that in an important respect, government can act as a\ndevice for limiting and focusing the moral, legal, and social\nvulnerability of business. Companies need a license to operate.\nThey need to be responsive to those who grant them that license.\nTsui's (2014) social entrepreneurial concept--where\nsocial responsibility and economic objectives are co-equal\ndeterminants of successful organizational outcomes--is a\npopular form of CSR. However, only the Public Value con-\nstruct provides clear criteria to assess when market effi-\nciency stops and public failure starts. These criteria are\nessential so both social entrepreneurial firms and non-prof-\nits that establish credentials for CSR are not co-opted\n(Selznick, 1948) by strictly for-profit businesses. Research\nby Baur and Schmitz (2012) found that corporations often\nco-opt the autonomy of non-profits by advancing notions of\nCSR that don't facilitate the change of profit maximization\npractices. When this occurs, both meaningful CSR develop-\nment and the image of the non-profit are negatively socially\nconstructed.\nCorporate entities seem to be heeding Moore and\nKhagram's (2004) advice on the linkage between CSR and\nPublic Value. For example, the day before the U.S. Supreme\nCourt heard oral arguments in April 2013 on whether Myriad\nGenetics could patent the genes that determine hereditary\nbreast and ovarian cancer, the company's CEO, Peter\nMeldrum, explained Myriad's position in a USA Today com-\nmentary. Meldrum especially wanted to clarify the compa-\nny's social welfare policy on female access to the genetic\ntests, irrespective of socioeconomic class:\nWe have done extensive clinical studies to help insurance\ncompanies cover the testing. And patients can get second\nopinions. The average out-of-pocket cost for a woman who\nmay be at risk for hereditary breast cancer is about $100. For\nwomen who cannot afford it, we make the tests available for\nfree. And patients can get second opinions. We have partnered\nwith one ofAmerica's largest reference labs, major universities,\nand cancer centers to offer confirmatory testing. (Meldrum,\nteria--based on the same neo-classical economic criteria that\ndetermines market failure--can be applied to assess public\nSimilarly, Moore and Khagram's (2004) strategic triangle\noutlines how profit-making businesses need to create Public\nValue--through interaction with regulatory agencies, the\nmedia, and the courts--to maintain social and political legiti-\nmacy.

Friedman (1953)\nsought to develop a scientific model of management--called\nPositive Economics--that omitted all ethics or morality from\nthe management process. Ghoshal (2005) explains, \"Since\nmorality, or ethics, is inseparable from human intentionality,\na precondition for making business studies a science has\nbeen the denial of any moral or ethical considerations in our\ntheories, and therefore, in our prescriptions for management\nFriedman's theoretical construct is based on two related\nassumptions: (a) all theories of human motivation are based\non notions of homogeneous, self-interested human behavior\nand (b) because of human imperfection, the problem of social\norganization is the negative problem of preventing bad peo-\nple from doing harm (Friedman, 2002). Moreover, the\nChicago School promotes agency theory to conceptualize the\nnegative problem (Shareef, 2011). Agency theory teaches\nthat since managers (agents) are not the owners (principal) of\nfirms, they will not act with the single purpose of an owner\nto maximize profits. Friedman (2002) contends that maxi-\nmizing shareholder value is the sole reason for an organiza-\ntion's existence. When profit maximization is not achieved,\nagency loss occurs.\nThe Chicago School's pessimistic view of human nature\nand the role of organizations in society has had a profound\ninfluence on various academic disciplines including soci-\nology, psychology, and anthropology. Ghoshal (2005)\nwrites,\nEven practitioners of sociology and psychology, the starting\npoints of which as academic fields were defined by the\nrecognition that human behavior can be shaped by factors other\nthan conscious, rational self-interest have increasingly adopted\nthe notion of behavior being self-seeking as their foundational\nassumption. Friendship ties of people are now analyzed by\nsociologists as a means for individuals to use social networks to\ninfluence their personal influence, power, or pay. (p. 82)\nOne academic discipline where the Chicago School has\nbecome the dominant paradigm, but is rarely discussed by\nthe movement's critics, is legal studies. This is especially\ntrue in the field of antitrust legislation and is primarily the\nresult of one extremely prolific, influential Chicago School\nscholar--Judge Richard Posner of the U.S. Seventh Circuit\nUntil the 1970s, courts and government agencies assumed\nthat firms with market concentration would act in an anti-\nThis worldview is commonly known as the \"Harvard School\"\napproach and it seeks to protect the public interest by pre-\nventing--under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act--mergers, joint\nventures, or agreements that allow firms to gain monopoly\nmarket power. Piraino (2007) describes this worldview as\nfollows:\nIn the middle of the twentieth century, Harvard economists such\nas Edward Chamberlain, Edward Mason, and Joe Bain argued\nthat an industry's structure, that is, the number of firms in the\nmarket and their relative sizes, determines how effectively firms\nwill perform in that market. (p. 348)\nThese scholars contend that when markets are concen-\ntrated, firms are more likely to engage in anticompetitive\npractices (Piraino, 2007). Harvard's public interest approach\nargues that courts should (a) be guided by Congress's desire\nin enacting the Sherman and Clayton Acts to protect indi-\nvidual competitors from the market power wielded by large\nfirms, (b) avoid market concentration even when it might\nlower costs and prices thereby benefitting consumers, and (c)\nengage a presumption of illegality when market monopolies\noccur without engaging in a complicated analysis of eco-\nnomic circumstances in the relevant market (Piraino, 2007).\nWhile the Harvard School's non-diagnostic analysis\nsought to utilize market concentration--based on a presump-\ntion of illegality--to define the public interest concerning\nmarket monopoly and antitrust law, the lack of economic\nanalysis made the paradigm susceptible to intellectual attacks\nby the empirical-based Chicago School. By the 1960s,\nChicago School economists and law professors were chal-\nlenging the Harvard School's non-economic approach to\nanalyzing antitrust cases. The late U.S. Supreme Court nomi-\nnee Robert Bork's (1966) article, Legislative Intent and the\nPolicy of the Sherman Act, argues that antitrust laws were\ndesigned to increase the efficiency of the firms and thus the\neconomy. For Bork, efficiency and profit maximization were\nBork defined economic efficiency in terms of conditions that\nmaximized wealth, and he equated wealth enhancement with\n\"consumer welfare,\" meaning lowered costs, reduced prices,\nand increased amount of products and services desired by\ncustomers. . . . All other possible goals of the antitrust laws,\nincluding the protection of small businesses from the power of\nlarge firms, were irrelevant. (p. 350)\nPosner (1979) agrees with Bork's analysis of the Sherman\nAct and argues that courts can no longer simply indulge in\nthe presumption of antitrust illegality based on market con-\ncentration. Rather, judges have to review economic analyses\nthat empirically demonstrate the adverse economic impacts\nof particular types of monopolistic practice. Consequently, it\nis no longer sufficient to show an enterprise merely pos-\nsessed dominant market power: \"In addition, plaintiffs would\nhave to demonstrate, through empirical evidence, that the\nconduct at issue harmed consumers by increasing prices or\nsuccinctly describes the Chicago School's distinguishing\ncharacteristic of antitrust analysis as being framed . . .\n\"through the lens of price theory\" (p. 925).\nBy the late 1980s, the Chicago School's economic analy-\nsis paradigm had replaced the Harvard School's public inter-\nest approach to analyzing antitrust legal issues (Hovenkamp,\nSchool's impact on U.S. Supreme Court rulings in the fol-\nlowing manner:\nThe Chicago School's influence on antitrust law and policy has\nbeen substantial, especially in the U.S. Supreme Court . . .\nantitrust policies, a significant reduction in agency enforcement\nactivity levels, and calls for repeal of antitrust laws altogether.\nWright (2008) predicts an even greater influence of the\nChicago School in antitrust cases with the Roberts' Court.\nPosner's Chicago School antitrust economic analysis is\npredicated on cost- benefit procedures that seek to improve\nthe consumer welfare of the individual. Wolfson (2001)\ndescribes cost-benefit analysis from this perspective:\nBenefits are then usually defined in terms of the change in\nindividual well-being that the policy induces, and costs are\nusually measured in terms of monetary costs or resources\nrequired to implement the project . . . Comparison of costs and\nbenefits thus requires the cost benefit analyst measure subjective\nbenefits in monetary terms. (p. 94)\nNormative economists and organization theorists criticize\nthe Chicago School's cost-benefit analysis approach because\nit \"monetizes\" important values--like a clean environment\nor health outcomes--that are absolute, regardless of mone-\ntary cost (Wolfson, 2001). Others criticize cost benefit analy-\nsis for ignoring questions of fairness: \"For example, a certain\npolicy may pass a cost benefit analysis but only at the\nPiraino (2007), a leading antitrust legal scholar, has called\nfor a mid-range theory to be utilized that fits between the\nnon-diagnostic presumptions of the Harvard School and the\nempirical analysis of the Chicago School to determine the\nconsumer welfare effects of challenged anticompetitive\nconduct:\nTo adopt an inquiry `meet for the case'as required by California\nDental, the courts and agencies should categorize all competitive\nconduct on a continuum according to its likely effect on\nconsumers. In order to confirm that effect, the courts and\nagencies will have to undertake varying degrees of inquiry\ndepending upon the type of conduct at issue. (p. 367)\nIn California Dental Association v. Federal Trade\nCommission (1998), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\ncharged California Dental Association (CDA) with restrict-\ning two types of truthful, non-deceptive advertising: price\nadvertising and advertising related to the quality of dental\nservices. In a 5-4 ruling, the majority opinion of the U.S.\nSupreme Court concluded the FTC's jurisdiction extended to\nnon-profits like the CDA and because the disputed anticom-\npetitive efforts were not obvious in the case, more than a\nquick look rule of reason analysis was required. The Court\nuses three standards to assess anticompetitiveness: (a) per se\nillegal (i.e., Harvard's Public Interest Model); (b) the quick\nlook rule of reason that does not exclude per se illegality but\nscreens evidence to determine if proffered pro-competitive\neffects are plausible; and (c) rule of reason, the analytical and\nevidentiary standard advocated by the Chicago School.\nAs a mid-range theory, Public Value would include con-\nsideration of social costs in a quick look analysis. For\ninstance, the CDA restricted inexact references to price in\nadvertising (e.g., reasonable fees or low costs) and non-price\nclaims like \"gentle care\" or \"satisfaction guaranteed\"\n(California DentalAssociation v. Federal Trade Commission,\n1998). The FTC ruled that restraints on price advertising\nwere per se illegal while the Court's ruling required more\nexpansive economic analysis to determine if the claims of\nanticompetitive effects of the price restrictions were valid.\nAs we will see in the next section, utilizing Stiglitz's\nasymmetrical information/market failure model in a quick\nlook analysis would conclude that inexact price information\nleads to both market failure and social welfare harm. As\nsuch, the asymmetrical information flow would also trigger\npublic failure. The FTC in CDA reached the correct conclu-\nsion but provided no empirical analysis to support its per se\nillegality analysis. Using Public Value criteria and Stiglitz's\nasymmetrical information/market failure framework would\nmake the quick look analysis a more robust mid-range theory\nof liability in antitrust legal decisions.\nBozeman's Public Value construct meets the criteria\nPiraino outlines for a mid-range theory:\nManaging Publicness differs in that public value is preeminent,\nnot just one criterion to be balanced against others. Public value\nis the starting point . . . Managing Publicness does not require\nthe courts or an agency to eschew market or quasimarket\napproaches such as contracting and privatization. (Bozeman,\nTherefore, the fundamental criterion of a Public Value\nmid-range theory in antitrust law analysis would be whether\nmonopoly economic power represents a social welfare threat\nto subsistence or victimization of the poor.\nBozeman's examples of the selling of human organs\ncould be organized via monopoly power and would be\nextremely efficient market processes (see, for example,\nbelieves that despite obvious market efficiencies inherent in\nboth activities, each constitutes public failure because they\npromote dehumanization and social cleavage (Bozeman,\nHe makes an interesting point, as well, concerning public\nfailure and institutional arrangements:\n6 SAGE Open\nPublic values may be viewed as a criterion by which to judge\ninstitutional arrangements for goods and services but should not\nbe confused by them. Thus, public values neither support\ngovernment action nor abjure markets; they are orthogonal to\nboth. Prostitution makes this case. If one agrees with Anderson\nthat prostitution has the effect of violating the individual\nautonomy and that autonomy is a public value, then one might\nwell deplore both free markets for prostitution and government\nJoseph Stiglitz: Asymmetrical\nInformation, Market Failure, and Public\nPolicy Interventions\nColumbia University economist Joseph Stiglitz won the\nNobel Prize in Economics in 2001--along with co-recipients\nGeorge Akerlof and Michael Spence--for his pioneering\nresearch in the field of information economics or, more pre-\ncisely, outlining the causal relationship between asymmetri-\ncal information and market failure (including market failure\ntriggered by agency loss). Stiglitz (2001) believes that mar-\nket efficiency depends on symmetrical flows of information\nand government has a role to play in facilitating informa-\ntional transparency. Thus, he begins his Nobel Prize accep-\ntance speech by stating,\nMany of the major political debates over the past two decades\nhave centered around one key issue--the efficiency of the\nmarket economy and the appropriate relationship between the\nmarket and the government. The argument of Adam Smith, the\nfounder of modern economics, that free markets led to efficient\noutcomes has played a central role in these debates. It suggested\nwe could, by and large, rely on markets without government\nintervention. The view I present here undermined Smith's theory\nand the view of government that rested on it. (Stiglitz, 2001, pp.\nmodels were premised on the fallacy that information was\nperfect. Moreover, he notes that even when economic model-\ning recognizes this fallacy, economists continued with the\nmodels and merely hoped that \" . . . economies in which\ninformation was not too imperfect would look very much\nlike economies in which information was perfect\" (p. 475).\nHis research shows this proposition is not true and that even\na small amount of information imperfection can have a pro-\nfound effect on market efficiency. Stiglitz (2001) provides a\nsimple example using the Chicago School's efficient market\nhypothesis which contends that prices in the stock market\nfully reflect all information. If this were true, he argues, there\nwould be no incentive for anyone to expend money to collect\ninformation.\nLikewise, Stiglitz (2001) attacks the Chicago School for\nassuming that information imperfection is merely a transac-\ntion cost that is in the price of a commodity:\nIn the approach of many Chicago economists, information\neconomics was just like any other brand of economics, one\nsimply analyzed the special factors determining the supply and\ndemand for information, just as agricultural economics analyzed\nthose factors affecting the market for wheat . . . Our analysis\nshowed that this approach was wrong, as were the conclusions\nStiglitz agrees--concerning stock prices and transaction\ncosts--with Bozeman's (2002) assertion that often \"prices\nA major goal of Stiglitz's research is to demonstrate why\nasymmetrical information flows persist. The reason was not\nan invisible hand but deliberate managerial manipulation to\nmaintain monopoly power and profit maximization:\nSimilarly, the presence of information imperfections give rise to\nmarket power; and firms can exploit this market power through\n\"sales\" and other ways of differentiating among individuals who\nhave different search costs. The price dispersions in the market\nwere created by the market--they are not just the failure of\nmarkets to arbitrage fully price differences caused by shocks\nWhat then is government's role in creating symmetrical\ninformation and efficient market processes? Stiglitz (2001)\nis no apologist for his belief in an activist Pareto tax policy\nthat redistributes income to achieve broad social outcomes:\nOne of the functions of government is to redistribute income;\neven if it did not want to redistribute actively it has to raise\nrevenues to finance public goods and there is a concern that the\nrevenue be raised in an equitable manner. (p. 516)\nHence, the difficulty lies in creating a symmetrical infor-\nmation flow so that government can maximize social welfare:\n\"The problem of the government maximizing social `profit'\n(welfare) subject to information constraints, is closely analo-\ngous to that of the monopolist, maximizing private profit sub-\nConsequently, two criteria are involved in creating a sym-\nmetrical taxing policy: (a) what is observable and (b) the\nsocial welfare function or attitudes toward inequality\n(Stiglitz, 2001). To achieve market efficiency, cost shifting to\nthird parties cannot be hidden as the existing medical system\nallows (see, for example, Shareef, 1984). Moreover, the\nsocial welfare function for access to medical services in the\nUnited States has long been accepted as a public good since\nfederal law (even before the Affordable Care Act) allows all\ncitizens to be seen in the nation's emergency rooms, regard-\nless of market inefficiencies or ability to pay (Shareef, 2011).\nBased on (a) Stiglitz's (2001) theory concerning symmet-\nrical information leading to efficient market processes that\nresult in desired social welfare outcomes and (b) Bozeman's\nPublic Value criteria, the diagnostic tools exist to determine\nwhether the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Myriad actually\nresulted in the creation of Public Value or was the catalyst for\npublic failure.\nThe Myriad Ruling and Public Value\nIn the Myriad case, Myriad Genetics sought to patent two\nhuman genes segments it discovered. They also sought to\npatent Myriad's synthetic replica of those human gene seg-\nments. The discovery of these segments was important\nbecause mutations of these segments provide indicators of\npropensity for breast or ovarian cancer. However, the Court\nfound that Myriad was not entitled to patent protection of the\ntwo genes because (a) products of nature cannot be patented\nand (b) the grant of patents would tie up the basic tools of\nscientific and technological work and inhibit future innova-\ntion premised upon them (Association for Molecular\nPathology v. Myriad Genetics, 2013). Writing for unanimous\ncourt, Justice Thomas outlined the anticompetitive aspects of\nMyriad's patent claim:\nMyriad's patents would, if valid, give it exclusive rights to\nisolate an individual's BRCA1 and BRCA 2 genes. . . .The\npatents would also give Myriad the exclusive right to\nsynthetically create BRCA cDNA. In Myriad's view,\nmanipulating BRCA DNA in either of those fashions triggers\nits `right to exclude others from making' its patented\ncomposition of matter under the Patent Act'. . . . Myriad also\nfiled patent infringement suits against other entities that\nperform BRCA testing, resulting in settlements in which the\ndefendants agreed to cease all infringing activity. Myriad then\nsolidified its position as the only entity providing BRCA\nThe Court did find Myriad could patent cDNA (synthetic\nDNA) created in the laboratory and maintain patents on the\nBRCA tests developed by the company. The majority opin-\nion also noted that Myriad can still make profit from other\nexisting gene patents it has procured and remains the only\ncompany performing BRCA tests.6\nPublic Failure Analysis\nThe Court's ruling seems to fit Bozeman's (2002) market\nefficiency/public failure criterion as it allows Myriad to sell\nits patented BRCA test, but does not allow patents that would\nbar or inhibit genetic research from other scientists on these\nindividual genes. Public Value is enhanced since (a) Myriad's\nretention of patent control over its BRCA 1 and 2 tests repre-\nsents an efficient market process and (b) it reduces the threats\nto subsistence for women with health insurance.\nThe Myriad decision appears to uphold Bozeman's Public\nValue construct of placing intrinsic value over economic\nvalue in two fundamental ways. First, had the Court granted\npatent rights to Myriad, the company would have stifled\ninnovation in the field by charging other research enterprises\nprohibitively high costs to use the two gene segment for\nscientific inquiry. Thus, the company would possess years of\na monopolized market for its BRCA testing and therefore\nharmed the broader social welfare by impeding development\nof competitive breast and ovarian diagnostic tests.\nSecond, the ruling is ostensibly consistent with Bozeman's\n(2007) argument that \" . . . economic currency is a poor sur-\nrogate for valuing scientific knowledge\" (p. 129). Often the\ncosts of a commodity's economic value and its public value\nhave little relationship. Bozeman (2007) finds that economic\ncosts attach a value to a commodity but that attachment says\nnothing important about the value itself. Conversely, Public\nValue does say something important about the value placed\non a commodity. In the Myriad decision, the unanimous\nopinion essentially concludes that the high social costs of\ngranting the company patent rights over the gene segments\nthemselves outweigh Myriad's reduced profit margins. This\nrationale also fits with Bozeman's Public Value value-prefer-\nence of protecting subsistence and human dignity.\nHowever, public failure was created in the Myriad case\nbecause the asymmetrical information barrier design for\npoor women to access applications forms for the BRCA tests\ncreates both market and public failure. Low-income women\nare required to download and read copious information to\napply for the BRCA tests. The Myriad webpage directs poor\nwomen to a series of links that require downloading of a\nMyriad Financial Assistance Application, Medical Criteria,\nand Financial Criteria.\nYet, research shows that this type of Informational chal-\nlenge often creates disincentives for the poor to effectively\nutilize the American health care system. For instance,\nHalpern, Ubel, and Asch (2008), in their study of medical\ndefault settings, found that low-income patients having to\ncomplete forms and obtain referrals often confront insur-\nmountable informational barriers that mitigate effective\nhealth care outcomes. Thaler and Sunstein's (2008) research\non enrollment in Medicare's Part D Prescription Plan reveals\nthat high enrollment rates of seniors were primarily the result\nof automatic default enrollment--not information and forms\nprovided by the government--through Medicaid or the\nVeterans Affairs. Consequently, many other eligible\nAmericans never enrolled in Medicare Part D because of\ninformation overload.\nLikewise, a recent Kaiser Foundation study found that\nMedicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are confused\nbecause of disinformation campaigns concerning the sup-\nposed defunding of \"Obamacare\" (Galewitz, 2013). Thus,\nbecause of deliberate information confusion about the\nAffordable Care Act and Obamacare by political partisans,\nACA navigators are told that the Obamacare label is toxic\nand avoid using it when explaining who is eligible for cover-\nage under Medicaid expansion.\nThese information barriers, by design, constitute informa-\ntion asymmetries and thereby trigger market failure. Stiglitz\n(2001) notes that business managers have an economic\nincentive to create asymmetrical information networks:\n8 SAGE Open\nWhile early work in the economics of information dealt with\nhow markets overcame information asymmetries, later research\nturned to how markets create information problems, partly in an\nattempt to exploit market power. Managers of firms attempt to\nentrench themselves, increasing their bargaining power, e.g., vis\na vis alternative management teams, and one of the ways they do\nthis is to take actions which increase information asymmetries.\nDoing so effectively reduces competition in the market for\nAs previously noted, Bozeman (2007) argues that neither\na market process nor government regulation inherently deter-\nmines whether Public Value has been created. The Myriad\ncase provides an interesting example of this paradox. It is\nundeniable that the Court's decision does broaden social\nwelfare benefits at the expense of Myriad's profits. However,\nbecause of asymmetrical information barriers for the poor to\nutilize the company's cutting-edge medical innovations, par-\nticipation by eligible low-income women is likely to be\nreduced. Stiglitz (2001) says these information barriers are\ndeliberate and designed to enhance profitability.\nBased on Tsui's (2013) typology, Myriad appears to\nremain a typical Friedman-type profit maximization organi-\nzation that will take advantage of the poor via its established\nasymmetrical information flow. If theory (Stiglitz, 2001) and\nThaler & Sunstein, 2008) are indicative, the asymmetrical\ninformation barrier will be so difficult for lower income\nwomen to surmount that Myriad's profits will only be mar-\nginally impacted by giving the test free of charge to this class\nof women. As such, the Myriad ruling will create public fail-\nure based on the Public Value criteria of threats to both the\nsubsistence for low-income women and to human dignity.\nBozeman (2002) is also concerned about the relationship\nbetween imperfect information in health care (concerning\nthe selling of human organs) and exploitation of the poor\ncausing social cleavage in the broader society:\nThe same argument can be made against the trade in human\norgans. If the person who takes the risk of living with just one\nkidney turns out to have made a bad bet, then society, not just the\nindividual, suffers the cost. This is especially likely since the\nsellers will come disproportionately from the poorer segments\nof society, selling their \"natural resource\" to the wealthy. (p.\nThus, the catalyst for public failure in both selling human\norgans and the Myriad ruling are asymmetrical information\nflows.\nPublic Value and CSR\nAs Myriad remains a Friedman-type profit maximization\norganization, it also fails Moore and Khagram's (2004)\nPublic Value criterion test for establishing CSR-based social\nand political legitimacy. A statement by the American\nMedical Association's President Jeffrey Lazarus (2013)\napplauded the Court's ruling and questioned Myriad's com-\nmitment to the broader social welfare:\nThe American Medical Association (AMA) has long advocated\na clear prohibition against human gene patents. To ensure the\nU.S. Supreme Court heard physicians' voices loud and clear, the\nAMA joined with other health care organizations to file an\namicus brief in defense of the federal court ruling that invalidated\npatents held by Myriad Genetics on the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2\ngenes consistent with the law . . . Removing the patents on the\nbuilding blocks of life ensures that scientific discovery and\nmedical care based on insights into human DNA will remain\nfreely accessible and widely disseminated, not hidden behind a\nvast thicket of exclusive rights.\nConclusion\nSeveral related conclusions can be drawn from this research\nconcerning intrinsic versus economic value in decision-mak-\ning and asymmetrical information.\nFirst, Kanter's (2005) sociology of knowledge construct\naccurately identifies the social context of organizational\nchange concerning the shift from Friedman-type enterprises\nto organizations where intrinsic and economic values are co-\ndeterminants of institutional success. Because of 21st-cen-\ntury corporate scandals, the public now finds organizations\nfeaturing social welfare norms more acceptable. Corporate\nCEOs are also aware of this shift in attitudes. Myriad's\nCEO's editorial in USA Today sought to portray his firm as\none exhibiting desired social welfare norms (Meldrum,\nKanter's (2005) framework suggests the U.S. Supreme\nCourt is also aware of this social shift in attitudes. Despite\nWright's (2008) prediction that Chicago School profit maxi-\nmization norms will be the foremost value that justices on\nthe Roberts' Court use in determining Sherman antitrust\ncases, a unanimous court in Myriad attempted to broaden the\nconcept of consumer welfare by placing intrinsic values over\neconomic values. The Court weighed the value of scientific\nknowledge as a public good versus giving monopoly rights\nto the owners of the most efficacious BRCA test in today's\nhave supported an opinion favoring Myriad.\nSecond, Bozeman's Public Value construct provides the\nrequisite diagnostic criteria--analogous to market failure in\nneoclassic economics--to determine whether social welfare\nhas been achieved or public failure has occurred. Therefore,\nPublic Value criteria can serve, in case-by-case situations, as\na mid-range theory between the Harvard and Chicago\nSchools in quick look antitrust cases. In the Public Value\ntheoretical construct, had the Court utilized established\nPublic Value cause and effect relationships between asym-\nmetrical information and victimization of the poor in a quick\nlook analysis in its Myriad ruling, the ruling would have\navoided public failure.\nHowever, the Court never considered the social costs of\nasymmetrical information for poor women in Myriad because\nof the dominance of the economics paradigm in the social\nsciences, including law. Pfeffer (2005) notes,\nIn a word, Ghoshal is right. He is right in the sense that\neconomics is indeed taking over management and organization\nscience, just as it has taken over political science and law . . .\nGhoshal is right that this takeover matters because social\ntheories matter. The theories that come to be believed and\naccepted affect both public and organizational policies and\npractices. Moreover theories, once accepted, set into motion\nprocesses that tend to become self-fulfilling. (p. 96)\nEconomic language now determines our collective social\nconstruction of reality (see Berger & Luckman, 1967) and\naffects what people see, what people ignore, and what people\nthink is important (Ferraro, Pfeffer, & Sutton, 2005).\nConsequently, the Court in Myriad did not ignore the diffi-\nculties of poor women attempting to access the BRCA tests\nout of meanness or indifference. Rather, they ignored poor\nwomen because of a social conditioning that leads to think-\ning solely about economic profitability and disregards the\nsocial costs of organizational and public policy.\nMoore and Khagram's (2004) Public Value/CSR concept--\nalong with Tsui's (2013) social entrepreneurship--are all\nmanifestations of Ghoshal's (2005) intellectual pluralism\nmovement to require both (a) scholars in the social sciences\nand (b) business and public sector leaders to consider social\nwelfare costs equally with economic profitability. These\nideas are moving from the periphery to the core of how to\ndefine organizational success. As a result, we very well may\nbe witnessing a paradigm shift (Kuhn, 1970) in academic\nand societal thinking about why organizations exist and the\ninextricable link between profitability and social welfare\ncosts.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1. Weick (1995), in his Organization Sensemaking construct,\ncontends that there has to be an agreed upon point of refer-\nence to begin making sense of social phenomenon. For many\nin the Public Management discipline, the point of reference for\nunderstanding the Public Value concept begins with Moore's\n(1995) book where he introduces the concept. However, my\npoint of reference for making sense of Public Value starts with\nBozeman's (2002) Public Administration Review article that\nestablishes criteria for determining where market efficiency\nstops and public failure begins.\n2. Bozeman and Sarewitz (2011) contend contemporary research\nevaluation does an excellent job assessing scientific and eco-\nnomic impacts; however, there is poor assessment of the social\noutcomes of research processes. Hence, they provide public value\nmapping criteria of science policy to evaluate public value failure.\n3. Many Public Management scholars view the Public Value con-\ncept as a unique normative management process that can only\nbe utilized in public agencies. Perry and Kraemer (1991, p.\n5) introduced the concept of Public Management's uniqueness\nby stating, \"Although there is much that public management\nshares with private management, it also has a unique con-\ntent.\" Thus, these scholars tend to reject generic management\napproaches that are applicable to both public and business\nmanagement processes. Williams and Shearer's (2011) review\nof journal articles and books on the Public Value concept over a\n15-year period is illustrative. Any research that applied Public\nValue in a non-public organization setting was excluded from\n4. The National Basketball Association (NBA) Board of\nGovernor's recent forced sale of the LosAngeles (LA) Clippers\nteam by owner Donald Sterling provides an easy assessment\nof both Bozeman's and Moore and Khagram's Public Value\nframeworks. Although the LA Clippers are an efficient mar-\nket entity (the team is a playoff contender and valued at over\n$500 million dollars), the NBA has banned Sterling (because\nof recorded racist remarks made to a female acquaintance) for\nlife and forced him to sell the team. These comments violate\nBozeman's (2002) public failure criteria of \"dehumanization\nand threats to human dignity.\" When the comments were made\npublic, the players union threatened to boycott the 2014 play-\noffs, corporate sponsors withdrew, civil rights groups staged\nprotests at Clipper games, and President Obama publicly con-\ndemned the racist statements (Berman, 2014). Consequently,\nSterling had lost all social and political support to remain the\nowner of the team--although the team was economically prof-\nitable--because of public failure.\n5. While neo-classical economists like Belfield (2012) continue\nto argue that cost-benefit analysis fits with the Public Value\nconstruct, Bozeman (2002) explicitly rejects this linkage argu-\ning this analytical approach focuses solely on economic out-\ncomes and excludes social costs.\nwrote an op-ed in The New York Times announcing that she\nhad undergone BRCA testing, was found to have an inherited\ngene mutation, and made the decision to have a preventive\ndouble mastectomy. The column focused public opinion on\nthe Myriad case. Much of Jolie's commentary discussed the\nhigh cost of BRCA testing: \"Breast cancer alone kills 485,000\npeople each year according to the World Health Organization,\nmainly in low and middle-income countries. It has to be a\npriority to ensure that more women can access gene testing\nand lifesaving preventive treatment, whatever their means\nand background, wherever they live.\" The cost of testing for\nremains an obstacle for many women.\nReferences\nAlford, J., & O'Flynn, J.
