    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study sought to identify factors associated with doctors' intention to provide lifestyle counseling to cancer survivors\nand provide an evidence base for developing an intervention to maximize counseling behavior in cancer management\nprograms. A cross-sectional survey based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was conducted. Participants were 210\nmedical doctors recruited from two hospitals in Nigeria. Participants completed questionnaires containing all the theoretical\nconstructs of TPB. Structural equation modeling was used for data analysis. Goodness-of-fit indices indicated adequate fit for\nthe final structural models. Attitude and subjective norm, but not perceived behavioral control, were identified as significant\npredictors of intention to provide lifestyle counseling. Intention also significantly predicted counseling behavior. This evidence\ninforms the design of a behavioral intervention to improve lifestyle counseling behavior in cancer management programs.\n",

Many advanced countries are incorporating self-man-\nagement support centered on these lifestyle factors into their\ncancer care system as an adjunct therapy to surgery, chemo-\ntherapy, and other treatment options (Jones et al., 2005; Loh,\nYip, Packer, & Quek, 2010). This support involves counsel-\ning survivors on lifestyle behavior changes and providing\nthem with necessary resources to promote adherence.\nCounseling support is recommended as best upon diagnosis,\nwhen the diagnosed are vulnerable and willing to learn and\nplay a more active role in their health care (Davies et al.,\nJones, Courneya, Fairey, & Mackey, 2004).

This is compounded\nby the lack of a system of health care financing and shared\nrisks, which has led to families bearing cancer care costs\nthrough spending savings and investments, borrowing at\nhigh economic and social costs, and sale of resources like\nhomes and investments, thereby making cancer an important\nrisk factor in poverty and loss of social status among the\nmiddle class (Adebamowo, 2013). Ultimately, rather than\npay for recommended treatment methods, survivors fall prey\nto a host of unreliable and harmful herbal remedies as well as\nother unorthodox treatment options (Oluka, Shi, et al., 2014).\nIn the face of these issues, cancer mortality rate is over the\ntop and strategies for long-term survival are nonexistent\n(Ferlay et al., 2010). While policies are still being tendered to\nthe government for approval and financing, self-manage-\nment strategies have been proposed to enable cancer patients\ncope effectively and reduce the long-term impact of cancer\n(Oluka, Shi, et al., 2014).

Participants\nwere medical doctors working at two major federal and state\ngovernment-owned hospitals (University of NigeriaTeaching\nHospital [UNTH] and Enugu State University of Science and\nTechnology Teaching Hospital [ESUTH]) in Enugu, Nigeria.\nEthical approval and permissions were obtained from the\nEthics Review Boards of Tongji Medical College, Wuhan,\nChina; UNTH; and ESUTH.

Self-administered questionnaires\nOluka et al. 3\nand informed consent forms were given to willing partici-\npants. A total of 350 questionnaires were distributed and 210\nmedical doctors recruited.\nMeasures\nA lifestyle counseling questionnaire, modeled based on the\nTPB, was employed in this study. The questionnaire, con-\ntaining questions on all the TPB constructs and demographic\ncharacteristics had been previously validated in a pilot study\non participants from the same population as this study\n(Oluka, Apio, Phiri, Nie, & Sun, 2014). Both direct and indi-\nrect measures of TPB were employed.\nThe direct measures included two attitude items (ATT),\ntwo items on subjective norm (SN), three PBC, and three\nintention (INT) items. Responses were scored on a 7-point\nLikert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7\n(strongly agree). Individual item scores were averaged to\nproduce a composite score for each construct.\nIndirect measures included five behavioral beliefs for\nattitude (ATB) and their corresponding outcome evalua-\ntions (10 items in total), five normative beliefs (NB) and\ntheir corresponding motivation to comply (10 items total),\nand two control beliefs (CB) and their corresponding\nstrength of belief (four items total). Responses were either\nunipolar, 1 (extremely unlikely) to 7 (extremely likely), or\nbipolar, -3 (extremely undesirable) to +3 (extremely\ndesirable). Each belief was multiplied with its corre-\nsponding outcome to obtain weighed scores which were\nsummed to create composite scores for each construct so\nATB and NB and -42 to +42 for CB. For both direct and\nindirect measures, high summary scores consistently\nreflect stronger or more positive beliefs toward the target\nbehavior.\nActual lifestyle counseling behavior was assessed based on\na single question with a \"yes/no\" response format employed.\nData Analysis\nDescriptive statistics were calculated to describe the charac-\nteristics of the study population. Internal consistency for the\nreliability of each item relating to the direct TPB measures\nwas assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Content validity of\nindirect measures was confirmed using simple bivariate cor-\nrelations between direct and indirect measures of the same\nconstruct.\nStructural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted to\ndetermine the association between TPB variables and life-\nstyle counseling. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was\nfirst conducted to determine whether there is empirical sup-\nport for the hypothesized theoretical factor structure. Based\non the confirmed factor structure, SEM was then carried\nout to identify the potential relationships among all TPB\nvariables.\nMaximum likelihood method was used to estimate param-\neters in the SEM analysis and model fit assessment was\nbased on absolute model fit indices using chi-square (2),\n2/df ratio (<2.25), p value (>.05), and relative fit indices\nusing goodness-of-fit index (GFI > 0.95), Tucker\u00adLewis\nroot mean square error of approximation (RMSEA < 0.08).\nAll statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistical\nResults\nfully completed (60% response rate).

It also\nconsists of two endogenous variables (intention and behav-\nior).

(2004), bivariate cor-\nrelations between the direct and indirect measures of TPB\nwere carried out to determine the content validity of the indi-\nrect measures. Due to the violations of the assumptions of\nnormality and linearity by the direct measures of TPB,\nSpearman Rank correlation method was employed with sig-\nnificant correlations observed between directly measured\nattitude and indirectly measured attitudinal belief (r = .468, p\n< .01). Direct (SN) and indirect (NB) measures of social\nnorms were also significantly correlated (r = .136, p < .05);\nhowever, no significant correlation was observed for both the\ndirect (PBC) and indirect (CB) control measures.\nConvergent Validity\nUpon conducting CFA, convergent reliability of the mea-\nsurement items were assessed.

In this study, the \"cut-\noff\" point chosen for significant factor loading is 0.30 based\non our sample size of 210, a recommended minimum by\nHair, Black, Babin, Anderson, and Tatham (2006). Construct\nreliability was measured using composite reliability (CR),\nAVE, and Cronbach's alpha with values of .6, .5, and .6 or\nhigher, respectively, deemed significant (Fornell & Larcker,\nAs shown in Table 1, the remaining number of items for\neach construct is as follows: Attitude (two items), SN (two\nitems), PBC (two items), Intention (three items), ATB (three\nitems), NB (four items), and CB (zero items). Control belief\n(CB) was excluded entirely from further analysis of the indi-\nrect TPB model as the factor loadings of its observed vari-\nables were too low and it had no statistically significant\ncorrelation with other latent variables in the model.\nThe AVE for PBC and NB were slightly below 0.5, sug-\ngesting that the latent factors may not be well explained by\ntheir observed variables. Otherwise, all requirements for\nconvergent validity of the proposed constructs are adequate.\nCronbach's alpha for the indirect measures were not calcu-\nlated as people can logically hold both positive and negative\nbeliefs about the same behavior, thereby making it inappro-\npriate to assess their reliability with an internal consistency\nDiscriminant Validity\nThis establishes that measures which are not supposed to be\nrelated are in reality, not related. In particular, the variance\nshared between a construct and any other construct in the\nmodel, should be less than the variance that construct shares\nwith its indicators (Fornell, Tellis, & Zinkhan, 1982). In\nthis study, discriminant validity was assessed by comparing\nthe square root of the AVE for a given construct, with the\ncorrelation between that construct and other constructs\n(Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2010). A significant\nresult, suggesting that a construct is more strongly corre-\nlated with its indicators than with other constructs in the\nmodel, is obtained when the square roots of the AVEs are\ngreater than the interconstruct correlations. As shown in\nTable 2, all proposed constructs had satisfactory discrimi-\nnant validity.\nGoodness-of-Fit Indices\nGoodness-of-fit indices for the CFA of the direct TPB mea-\nThe CFA results are satisfactory and suggest that the linear\nstructural model is appropriate for our data (Hair et al., 2006;\nStructural Model\nPower analysis for the SEM(s) was calculated based on the\nnumber of latent and observed variables in each model, the\nanticipated effect size, desired probability, and statistical\nminimum sample size to achieve a power of 0.80 for the indi-\nrect TPB model structure was 116 participants which is well\nbelow our study sample size of 210. However, the direct TPB\nmodel would have required 288 participants.\nThe SEM results and explanations are based on the final\nor generating structural models after the CFA. However, the\nhypothesized models for both the direct and indirect models\nare presented in Figures 1 and 2, respectively, to provide a\nclearer picture of the modeling process. Measured variables\nwith low factor loadings in the hypothesized models were\nexcluded, and the multivariate Lagrange Multiplier (LM)\ntest--a modification index indicating possibilities for\nimproving model fit--was also employed to decide which\nvariables significantly improve model fit.\nThe final direct model (Figure 3) had a reasonably good\nfit with the absolute fit (2), p value > .05.

Other relative goodness-of-fit indi-\nces were adequate (Figure 4).

Indirect measures have also been evi-\ndenced as providing insight into the underlying cognitive\nfoundation of each TPB construct (Giles et al., 2007; Valois,\nDesharnais, Godin, Perron, & Lecompte, 1993). However,\nFrancis et al. (2004) recommends that both measures be\nincluded in TPB studies as they are expected to be positively\ncorrelated when measuring the same construct.\nIn both the final direct and indirect TPB models, results\nindicated that attitude best predicted intention. This result is\nsimilar to those of past studies (AL Ziadat, 2014; Collins &\ntive attitude are likely to engage in lifestyle counseling for\ncancer patients.\nInterestingly, subjective norm predicted intention in only\nthe indirect TPB model but not in the direct model. This\nattests to the recommendation that both measures be used as\nneither approach is perfect (Francis et al., 2004). The result\nimplies that while doctors may believe counseling cancer\npatients to be a worthwhile behavior, social referents includ-\ning colleagues and patients among others may have an influ-\nence on their intention to do so.\nPerceived control had no significant effect on intention in\neither structural model, making it the only aspect of TPB that\nwas not confirmed in this study. PBC was, however, found to\nhave moderate significant correlations with SN in the final\ndirect model. This provides empirical evidence that it is an\nimportant extension of TPB. Also, this correlation may have\nsuppressed the effect of PBC on intention and so should not\nBoth direct and indirect measures of PBC also had no sig-\nnificant association with actual counseling behavior. This\nresult is somewhat surprising in light of previous research\nthat found PBC to be a significant predictor of intention and\nIntention was a significant predictor of behavior, replicating\nstudy, stronger intentions to provide counseling were predicted\nby more positive attitudes and possibly the positive influence of\nsocial referents regarding lifestyle counseling. Thus, doctors\nacknowledged feeling relatively positive about providing life-\nstyle counseling but also indicated that the opinion of social ref-\nerents may influence their behavior. It is worthy of note that\n72.9% of participants reported providing lifestyle counseling to\nthose diagnosed with cancer in the past. This finding corre-\nsponds with that of the pilot study and raises the possibility that\npast behavior may influence future behavior (Collins & Carey,\nComparing the R2 results of the final TPB models, the\nindirect model explained 9% more variance in intention than\nTable 2.

Based on this finding and the fact that\nonly the indirect model was able to show significant direct\neffect of SN on intention, it may be surmised that the indirect\nmodel in this study may be statistically superior to the direct\nmodel in predicting lifestyle counseling behavior.\nUltimately, the application of TPB to understand counsel-\ning behavior showed that intention was mediated by attitude\nand subjective norm; and actual counseling behavior medi-\nated by intention. As such, attitude and subjective norm are\nappropriate modifiable targets to increase lifestyle counsel-\ning intention and behavior among doctors. The results also\nsuggest that Nigerian doctors of various specialties are will-\ning to contribute to cancer care in the face of limited oncol-\nogy specialists. The challenge is to develop and implement\nstrategies to help doctors maintain this positive intention and\nactually translate it into practice during treatment consulta-\ntions. As lifestyle counseling is probably the easiest and least\nexpensive aspect of cancer management, development of\nstrategies to maximize the behavior should be prioritized.\nFor example, attitude and SN can be improved by training or\nproviding doctors with resources that would improve their\nknowledge and awareness on the benefits of healthy lifestyle\nchanges. In addition, the national medical council (or/and\nother influential bodies) endorsement could make provision\nof lifestyle counseling more likely. Development of a life-\nstyle counseling intervention may provide the much-needed\nimprovement in cancer outcomes for patients in Nigeria and\nother low/middle-income countries.\nSome limitations of this study deserve mention. Actual\ncounseling behavior was assessed with only a single ques-\ntion on past provision of lifestyle counseling which may\nhave been insufficient to fully assess the construct. Next, our\nstudy sample size of 210 did not ensure adequate power to\noptimally test the direct TPB model; thus, future studies\nFigure 3.

Furthermore, the current study population con-\nsisted of doctors in one city in Nigeria and may require rep-\nlication in several other cities to enhance generalizability of\nthe results. Finally, we used a cross-sectional study design\nand therefore cannot infer causation.\nConclusion\nDespite the limitations in this study, the TPB model proved\neffective in predicting intention and lifestyle counseling\nbehavior for cancer patients among medical doctors. The\nfindings suggest that theory-based interventions focused on\nenhancing attitude, subjective norm and intentions may have\npositive impacts on lifestyle counseling among doctors.\nFuture research may assess strategies to improve doctors'\nintentions to provide counseling. Also, a lifestyle counsel-\ning intervention for cancer survivors in general practice is\nwarranted.\nClinical Implications\nThis study recommended provision of lifestyle counseling in\nroutine cancer care as a feasible self-management strategy\nwhich will improve the quality of life and overall survival of\nNigerian cancer patients, while costing little or nothing.\nThe results provide evidence that Nigerian doctors of various\nspecialties are willing to contribute to cancer care in the face\nof limited oncology specialists. However, strategies to\nimprove physician's attitude and influence of social referents\non lifestyle counseling behavior may be required.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAdebamowo, C.
