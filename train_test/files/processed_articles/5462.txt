The second was to investigate whether (a) Attitude Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help\n(ATSPPH), (b) Self-Stigma of Seeking Help (SSOSH), and (c) Social Stigma of Receiving Psychological Help (SSRPH) predicted\nthe students' intentions to seek psychological help. A total of N = 519 (283 females and 236 males) students from the\nUniversity of Botswana completed the survey. Results indicated that generally, the students had moderate intentions of seeking\npsychological help. Multiple regression analysis revealed that of the three predictors, only ATSPPH and SSRPH significantly\npredicted intentions to seek psychological help. The current study is important because while it has been established that\nuniversity students are a high-risk population for mental health problems, there is close to nothing documented on university\nstudents in Botswana. Findings of the current study will undoubtedly increase knowledge relating to psychological help-seeking\nand its predictors in Botswana and may inform interventions that aim to encourage young people to seek psychological or\ncounseling help.\n",

This is despite the World\nHealth Organization's (WHO) estimations that in 2001\nalone, 121 million people suffered from depression; 24 mil-\nlion suffered from schizophrenia; 70 million were affected\nby alcohol use disorders; and 5 million were negatively\naffected by drug use disorders. While these statistics are\nglobal, they still suggest that in a lifetime, any individual\nmay suffer from a mental disorder, come into contact with\nsomeone with a mental disorder, and/or have to care for\nsomeone with a mental disorder. The statistics also suggest\nthat individuals need knowledge to realize when they or oth-\ners may be suffering from psychological disorders, and to\nknow when to seek help or to advice their close others to\nseek help. Such need is also exacerbated by research that\nsuggest that university students are a high-risk population for\nmental health illness problems (Ryan, Shochet, & Stallman,\n2010) as being at university may present threats to the stu-\ndent's emotional well-being (Wittenberg, 2001).\nIn Botswana, this might be worsened by the generally\nnegative historical views of mental illness (Seloilwe &\nThupayagale-Tshweneagae, 2007) and the fact that a large\nnumber of students in Botswana have to relocate from\nmany different remote areas to the capital city for their uni-\nversity education. Such migrations, coupled with interac-\ntions with new groups of people, loss of contact with\nfamiliar people, and changing environmental conditions\n(Sabone, 2009) may further add to the challenges students\nface as they adapt to the new environments (i.e., the city\nand university environments).\nThe University of Botswana is the largest university in\nBotswana, and like many universities across the world, it has\na counseling service for the students. While existence of such\nfacilities should be applauded, researchers have reported\nthat, generally, few university students seek professional\nhelp when experiencing problems (Wade, Post, Cornish,\nVogel, & Tucker, 2011). This makes it important for research-\ners and practitioners to investigate factors that may facilitate\nor inhibit intentions to seek psychological help.\n1University of Botswana, Gaborone, Botswana\nCorresponding Author:\nMpho M.

Pheko1, Rapelang Chilisa1, Shyngle K. Balogun1,\nand Christina Kgathi1\n Keywords\nintentions to seek counseling, stigma, attitudes, university students\n2 SAGE Open\nIn line with the currently ongoing debate about the possi-\nbility of indigenizing psychology in the African context\n(Moll, 2002), there is a need to address the issue of why\nknowledge documented elsewhere about stigma and help-\nseeking behaviors might not be adequate to address the chal-\nlenges specific to a country like Botswana. Furthermore,\nMpofu (2002) also noted the benefits of including and docu-\nmenting African experiences in the literature of psychology,\narguing that it will not only enrich the discipline, but will\nalso make it globally relevant. The current study is important\nmore so that psychology is a fairly new discipline in\nBotswana. For example, to the knowledge of the authors, the\nonly existing psychology department (i.e., a university teach-\ning department) in the whole country was only established in\n2004 at the University of Botswana (www.ub.bw).\nAccording to Plattner and Moagi-Gulubane (2010), it was\nobserved that the majority of counseling services in commu-\nnities around Botswana were being offered by individuals\nwho were not specifically trained as psychologists. To bridge\nthe gap in the provision of these essential services, the\nBPsych program at the University of Botswana was tailored\nto provide the graduates with skills that would enable them\nto work as professionals under supervision. However, a lot\nremains to be done in terms of educating the public and get-\nting them to appreciate the need to seek psychological help.\nOutside Botswana, factors contributing to people's reluc-\ntance to seek psychological help include stigmatization of\nmental illnesses (Corrigan, 2004; Narikiyo & Kameoka,\n1992), emotional openness (Komiya, Good, & Sherrod,\nHayslip, Schneider, & Kooken, 1998), while others include\nfear (Kushner & Sher, 1989), a person's outcome expecta-\ntions (Fischer, Jome, & Atkinson, 1998; Halgin, Weaver,\nWester, Wei, & Boysen, 2005), gender (Addis & Mahalik,\ndiscomfort with self-disclosing information (Vogel & Wester,\nWhile these factors may also be significant in Botswana, this\nhas not been confirmed through research. Specific to\nBotswana, the challenges may include preferences of other\nsources of intervention such as traditional doctors, family,\nand religious leaders. For instance, it has been documented\nthat irrespective of the level of education and social status,\nBatswana continues to seek help from traditional healers\n(Stockton, Nitza, & Bhusumane, 2010). Furthermore, the\nneed for understanding university students' intentions of\nseeking psychological help and/or their attitudes toward seek-\ning psychological help is further heightened by the Botswana's\nHIV/AIDS challenges, alcohol and drug problems, high\nunemployment rate, and the scourge of \"passion killings.\"\nIn line with the above-mentioned gap in research, the cur-\nrent study was an exploratory study with two main objec-\ntives. The first was to investigate Botswana's university\nstudents' intentions of seeking psychological help. The\nsecond was to investigate whether (a) Attitude Toward\nSeeking Professional Psychological Help (ATSPPH), (b)\nSelf-Stigma of Seeking Help (SSOSH), and (c) Social Stigma\nof Receiving Psychological Help (SSRPH) predicted the stu-\ndents' intentions to seek psychological help. The findings of\nthe current study might also inform human services pro-\ngrams, the educational programs, researchers, and practitio-\nners, and also enable them to have targeted programs that\nencourage help-seeking behaviors for university students in\nBotswana and in other similar countries.\nTheoretical Background\nIntentions to Seek Counseling\nResearch suggests that there are many factors that may\naffect one's decision to seek help when faced with a psycho-\nlogical problem. Furthermore, it has been noted that inten-\ntion is one of the good predictors of such behavior (e.g.,\nthe care-seeking process can be influenced by social and\ncultural factors. Others added that personal and agency fac-\ntors (i.e., factors relating to counseling services such as the\nservice and the counselor) may also affect intentions\nSeloilwe and Thupayagale-Tshweneagae (2007) further\nadded that care of the mentally ill in most societies takes\nplace within complex historical, economic, political, social,\nand cultural contexts, pointing to the need to investigate fac-\ntors that may facilitate help-seeking behaviors in different\nsocio-economic-cultural-political contexts.\nThe current study focused on Botswana university stu-\ndents because researchers have also highlighted problems in\naccessing mental health services (Kurtz & Street, 2006) and\non the decision to seek mental health services for individuals\nfrom minority ethnic groups and university students. It is\nalso important to understand the reception of mental health\nservices in contexts like Botswana where the treatment\nmodalities, the practices, and the approaches used in psycho-\ntherapy are mostly imported from the Western world. It is\nnoteworthy that Botswana has transformed from a society\nthat solely associated mental disorders with witchcrafts and/\nor possession of bad spirits to a society that has recognized\nthe need for counseling centers and mental hospitals\n(Seloilwe & Thupayagale-Tshweneagae, 2007).\nStudies conducted elsewhere have consistently revealed\nthat many individuals who could potentially benefit from psy-\nchological services do not seek help or follow-through with\ntant for Botswana practitioners and researchers to understand\nsome of the barriers to seek counseling or any other related\nmental health services within Botswana. Pepin, Segal, and\nCoolidge (2009) classified barriers associated with seeking\nand utilizing mental health services into intrinsic barriers (i.e.,\nbarriers that operate within an individual) and extrinsic\nPheko et al. 3\nbarriers (i.e., barriers that operate outside of an individual).\nThe current study focused on intrinsic factors only that\nincluded a negative view of mental disorders, stigma associ-\nated with seeking or receiving mental health services, or lim-\nited knowledge about the potential benefits of psychotherapy.\nWhile it is understood that having intentions to seek treatment\nis a different process, distinct from actually contacting the\nmental service providers (Saunders, 1993), the current study\nonly measured students' intentions to seek counseling and\nfactors that might influence such a process. Given the\nBatswana's general negative cultural and historical views of\nthe mentally ill (Seloilwe & Thupayagale-Tshweneagae,\n2007), it was predicted that university students may have low\nintentions of seeking psychological help.\nAttitudes Toward Seeking Psychological Help\nGreenwald and Banaji (1995) defined attitudes as favorable\nor unfavorable dispositions toward an attitude object, such\nas people, places, and policies. They further explained that\npositive correlations have been established between mea-\nsured attitudes and the favorable aspects of observed behav-\nior. It has also been revealed that people from ethnic or\nminority groups are likely to hold negative and stigmatizing\nattitudes toward mental disorders and the mentally ill\n(Papadopoulos, Leavey, & Vincent, 2002). Moreover, peo-\nple who have little knowledge and contact with the mentally\nill are likely to hold even stronger negative attitudes toward\npeople with mental disorders (Papadopoulos et al., 2002).\nOther studies have revealed that such negative attitudes\ntoward help-seeking are strongly related to lower intentions\nto seek counseling (e.g., Bathje & Pryor, 2011). Specifically,\nnegative attitudes toward help-seeking have been found to\nreduce the likelihood of using mental health care services\nand the likelihood of perceiving the need to seek psycho-\nlogical help (Mojtabai, Olfson, & Mechanic, 2002).\nStigma in Seeking and Receiving Psychological\nHelp\nResearchers have also revealed that stigma associated with\nmental disorders may be one of the key factors that inhibit\nindividuals from seeking help from mental help profession-\nbecause being diagnosed with a psychological disorder and\nthe actual act of seeking treatment appear to be stigmatizing\n(Ben-Porath, 2002). For example, in one study, Kurtz and\nStreet (2006) revealed the participants' fear of the stigma\nsurrounding mental health and also the effect of such stigma\non young people's reluctance to discuss their challenges\nwith individuals they did not know or did not trust. In coun-\ntries like Botswana, even families with persons who show\nsigns of any mental disorder may also be stigmatized, which\nmay lead them to avoid seeking the necessary assistance for\nfear of being either labeled or ostracized (Seloilwe &\nThupayagale-Tshweneagae, 2007). According to Corrigan\nand Watson (2002), different components or types of stigma\nare commonly present in the general public, and even in the\nstigmatized individuals. For instance, individuals may\nexpect to be socially rejected before they receive psycho-\nlogical help, or actually experience social rejection after\nparticipating in mental health treatment (Link, 1987;\nVerhaeghe, Bracke, & Christiaens, 2010). They may then\nconsequently engage in self-rejection or self-stigma (i.e.,\nexperience shame and feelings of inferiority as a result of\nreceiving or seeking mental health service; Verhaeghe et al.,\n(we also referred to this type of stigma as social stigma) and\nself-stigma, and other researchers have also emphasized the\nneed to study multiple dimensions and multiple outcomes of\nstigma experiences (e.g., Verhaeghe et al., 2010). Therefore,\nin the current study, the impact of public/social stigma and\nself-stigma on the intentions of seeking psychological help\nwere investigated separately.\nPublic/SSRPH\nThe public/social stigma is influenced by the societal\nresponse to people who seek or receive help for psychologi-\ncal distress (Bathje & Pryor, 2011). This type of stigma may\nbe viewed as a form of prejudice comprising affective,\nbehavioral, and cognitive reactions to the individual seeking\npsychological help (Corrigan et al., 2005). Furthermore, it\nmay involve the actual negative stereotypes and/or discrimi-\nnating behaviors against the stigmatized individuals\n(Corrigan, 2004), or in some instances, the awareness of\nresponses to people with mental disorders or people who\nseek mental health services. People with mental disorders\nmay be viewed as dangerous (Crisp, Gelder, Rix, Meltzer, &\nRowlands, 2000), embarrassing, socially disagreeable\n(Coolidge, Mincic, & O'Riley, 2005), and/or even responsi-\nble for their own illnesses (Corrigan et al., 2005). Social\nstigma associated with seeking or receiving psychological\nhelp does not only affect those diagnosed or perceived as\nmentally ill. For instance, Lefley (1989) and Corrigan,\nWatson, and Miller (2006) suggested that stigmatization of\nthe mentally ill generalizes to their family members because\nof social barriers that are erected against the relatives and\nhouseholds of the mentally ill. Corrigan, Watson, et al.\n(2006) further explained that the behaviors of persons with\npsychotic disorders may also diminish the family's reputa-\ntion, and jeopardize relationships with friends and neighbors.\nTherefore, a negative relationship between social stigma of\nseeking psychological help and intentions of seeking profes-\nsional psychological help was expected.\nSSOSH\nThe self-stigma is the individual self-labeling that can nega-\ntively impact one's participation in society at large (Holmes\n4 SAGE Open\n& River, 1998). Self-stigma has also been shown to nega-\ntively impact one's perceived self-worth, self-esteem, and\nhas also been linked to outcomes such as depression and\nreluctance to seek help (Corrigan, Watson, & Barr, 2006;\nPryor (2011) conceptualized it as the internalized impact of\nsocial stigma. Accordingly, Holmes and River (1998) sug-\ngested that adequate help of individuals coping with mental\ndisorders should involve addressing societal and self-stigma.\nKroska and Harkness (2008) explained that self-stigma\nworks in such a way that when an individual is first diag-\nnosed with a mental illness, cultural ideas and stereotypes\nthat have been linked with the mental illness or the mentally\nill individuals become personally relevant and promote neg-\native self-feelings. Thereafter, the individual expects others\nto reject him/her, in turn, triggering defensive behaviors\naimed at preventing the rejection. Such defensive behaviors\nmay include: hiding one's treatment history, withdrawing\nfrom social interaction, and/or teaching others about mental\nillness. Such conceptualization of self-stigma suggests that\nawareness and endorsement of public/social stigma are nec-\nessary to generate self-stigma (Corrigan, Watson, & Barr,\n2006). Overall, understanding stigma is important for\nresearchers and practitioners as it gives insights into why\nindividuals with significant life problems may be hesitant to\nseek professional help (Vogel et al., 2006). As a result of the\nabove discussions, the following hypothesis were formulated\nand tested:\nHypothesis 1: Students will report low intentions of seek-\ning professional psychological help.\nHypothesis 2: Positive attitudes toward seeking profes-\nsional psychological help positively predict intentions\nof seeking professional psychological help.\nHypothesis 3: Public/social-stigma of receiving psycho-\nlogical help negatively predicts intentions of seeking\nprofessional psychological help.\nHypothesis 4: Self-stigma of seeking psychological help\nnegatively predicts intentions of seeking professional\npsychological help.\nMethod\nParticipants\n236 males) University of Botswana students completed the\nsurvey. Participants between the ages of 16 and 20 comprised\ncomprised 8.9% of the sample. In terms of nationality, 82%\nindicated they were Batswana, 2.1% indicated that they were\nother African nationalities, and 0.4% indicated that they\nwere other nationalities. The majority (90.0%) of the partici-\npants were single, 9.6% were married, and 4% were\nwidowed. Most of the participants did not have children\nyear students, 28 fifth-year students, and 1 student who was\nin the sixth year. There were no group differences on any\nother sociodemographic variables.\nProcedure\nEthicsclearancefortheresearchwasobtainedfromBotswana's\nMinistry Health. Data were collected using paper-and-pencil\nsurveys. Specifically, questionnaires were distributed to stu-\ndents in classroom settings. Participants were treated in accor-\ndance with the ethical principles of the Botswana's Ministry\nHealth. Specifically, the questionnaire started with a partici-\npant information cover page that detailed research objectives,\ninformed the participants of their right to withdraw from the\nresearch at any time, and requested their consent. It took\nbetween 20 and 30 min to complete the questionnaire.\nMeasures\nIntentions of seeking psychological help. Intentions of seeking\npsychological help were assessed with the Intentions to\nSeeking Counseling Inventory (ISCI) by Cash, Begley,\nmeasures participants' intentions to seek counseling services\nfor a range of specified problems. The scale contains some of\nthe following items: weight control, excessive alcohol use,\ndepression, test anxiety, and loneliness. For each item, par-\nticipants were asked to rate on a scale from 1 (very unlikely)\nto 4 (very likely) how likely they were to seek counseling if\nthey were experiencing the listed problem. Support for con-\nstruct validity of the ISCI has been provided by the findings\nthat participants who reported greater self-stigma associated\nwith seeking psychological help as measured by the SSRPH\nhad less intentions to seek treatment for psychological and\ninterpersonal concerns as measured by the ISCI (Vogel et al.,\n2006), and positive association between the ISCI and the\nATSPPH (Kelly & Achter, 1995). Coefficient alpha in the\ncurrent study was  = .91, indicating a strong reliability.\nAttitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help\nScale.ATSPPH was measured with the 10-item shortened\nversion of the Attitude Toward Seeking Professional Psycho-\nlogical Help Scale (Fischer & Farina, 1995) originally devel-\noped by Fischer and Turner (1970). A sample of items on the\nscale included: \"If I were experiencing a serious emotional\ncrisis at this point in my life, I would be confident that I\ncould find relief in psychotherapy\" and \"I would want to get\npsychological help if I were worried or upset for a long\nperiod of time.\" Items on this scale were scored on a scale\nfrom 1 (disagree) to 4 (agree). Higher scores on this measure\nreflected a more positive ATSPPH. Internal consistency of\nthe measure has been found to be acceptable ( = .82; Vogel\nPheko et al. 5\net al., 2005). The scores on the Self-Stigma of Seeking Psy-\nchological Help scale also significantly predicted ATSPPH\n(Vogel et al., 2006), indicating a good construct validity.\nCoefficient alpha in the current study was  = .50.\nSelf-Stigma of Seeking Help Scale. The self-stigma associated\nwith seeking psychological help was measured with the Self-\nStigma of Seeking Help (SSOSH) scale (Vogel et al., 2006).\nThe SSOSH has 10 questions and responses on this scale\nwere rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1\n(strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Higher scores indi-\ncated a greater perception of self-stigma associated with\nseeking psychological help. Sample items on this subscale\ninclude \"Seeking psychological help would make me feel\nless intelligent\" and \"It would make me feel inferior to ask a\ntherapist for help.\" In the current study, internal consistency\nfor this scale was  = .66.\nSocial Stigma of Receiving Psychological Help Scale.SSRPH\nwas measured with the Social Stigma of Receiving Psycho-\nlogical Help Scale (Komiya et al., 2000). The scale contained\nfive questions each rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale rang-\ning from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Higher\nscores in this scale indicated greater perceptions of social\nstigma associated with receiving professional psychological\nhelp and lower scores indicated lesser perceptions of social\nstigma associated with receiving professional psychological\nhelp. Sample items on this scale included \"Seeing a psychol-\nogist for emotional or interpersonal problems carries social\nstigma\" and \"People will see a person in a less favorable way\nif they come to know that he or she has seen a psychologist.\"\nThe coefficient alpha for the SSRPH was initially found to be\nResults\nStatistical Analyses\nFirst, Cronbach's alpha coefficients () were calculated to\nassess the internal consistency of the measuring instruments\nthe means, standard deviations, and alpha coefficients of\nmeasures.\nSecond, for those scales yielding a low alpha (i.e.,\nATSPPH and SSOSH) further analyses were conducted to\nidentify problematic items. Despite the low Cronbach's\nalpha, the item analyses on both scales did not indicate that\nthe removal of any of the items would improve the scale's\nCronbach's alpha. To further identify the problem with the\nscales, the items were factor analyzed using Exploratory\nFactor Analysis (EFA) and principal axis factoring analysis\nwith a direct oblimin, that is, an oblique rotation. The scales\nwere expected to manifest unidimensional set of items to\nreflect variance in their latent variables.\nFor the SSOSH scale, the initial EFA analysis results\n(Table 2) identified all the reverse-coded items as problem-\natic as the items loaded on the separate extracted factor.1\nAnother problematic scale was the scale measuring\nATSPPH. Following a low alpha, the scale was also sub-\njected to EFA. The results presented in Table 3 show that\nsimilar to the SSOSH scale, all the reverse-coded items and\none extra item that was not necessarily reverse-coded (i.e.,\n\"Considering the time and expense involved in psychother-\napy, it would have doubtful value for a person like me\") also\nfailed the unidimensionality test.2\nAs per recommendations of Hair, Babin, Money, and\nSamouel (2003) regarding the use of alphas below .70 in pre-\nliminary studies, a decision was made to still use all the\nscales in further analysis. Items from each scale were there-\nfore summed together to form indexes measuring ATSPPH,\nintentions of seeking counseling (ISC), SSOSH, and SSRPH.\nThe second set of statistical tests was conducted to assess\nthe students' ISC. Table 4 shows the descriptive results of\nstudents' scores of ISCI. Other researchers have identified\nthree subscales (i.e., Interpersonal Problems, Academic\nProblems, and Drug/Alcohol Problems; Cepeda-Benito &\nShort, 1998) of the ISCI. In the current study, an attempt was\nmade using EFA to evaluate the factor structure of the 17\nitems. Unfortunately, the current data did not yield the factor\nstructure identified by Cepeda-Benito and Short (1998).\nNonetheless, other researchers have summed the items of\nthe ISCI to yield scores ranging from low to high, with higher\nscores indicating a greater likelihood of seeking counseling\nfor the various problems (e.g., Kelly & Achter, 1995; Leech,\n2007). In the current study, the items were also summed to\nyield scores ranging from 17 to 68. The summed scores were\nalso used to conduct correlations and multiple regression\nanalyses. To examine students' intentions of seeking help, it\nwas also deemed necessary to evaluate students' intentions to\nseek help for each one of the listed items. Finding past\nresearch that established cutoffs for the scale was difficult.\nTherefore, in the current study, it was decided that as the\nresponses ranged from 1 = very unlikely, 2 = unlikely, 3 =\nlikely, to 4= very likely, for each item, any scores 2.0 and\nbelow will indicate that the participants were unlikely to seek\nhelp for the identified problem. In addition, any score between\nTable 1.

The results revealed that for most\nof the areas of concern, the mean scores ranged from 1.96 to\nPredictive Analyses Using Multiple Regression\nBefore conducting multiple regression analysis, descriptive\nstatistics and intercorrelations were calculated for all study\nvariables. The correlation matrix is presented in Table 5.\nConducting correlation analysis was important in detecting\nmulticollinearity that may occur when predictor variables are\novercorrelated. Multicollinearity may cause some problems\nin validation, interpretation, and analysis of the model (Feng-\nJeng, 2008). A general rule of thumb is that variables with a\ncorrelation (r < .75) may cause multicollinearity. In our\nstudy, all correlation coefficients were below .40.\nThe last step of the statistical analysis involved using\nmultiple regression analyses to test the hypotheses that\nATSPPH, SSOSH, and SSRPH predict the students' inten-\ntions to seek counseling (i.e., Hypotheses 2, 3, and 4). Table 6\nsummarizes the results of the regression analysis. The total\nexplained by the three predictors. Hypothesis 2 stated that\nATSPPH positively predicts ISC. In our data, Hypothesis 2\nstated that SSRPH negatively predicts ISC. Hypothesis 3\n4 stated that SSOSH negatively predicts ISC.

In particular, depression,\nexcessive alcohol use, and drug problems received the high-\nest mean scores. The only area of concern that the students\nwere unlikely (i.e., receiving a mean score of less than 2.0) to\nseek counseling for was weight control. Other areas of con-\ncern receiving the lower mean scores included speech anxi-\nety, difficulty with friends, and difficulties of dating.\nThe ISCI was used in another study aimed at measuring\nthe effects of mental health education on students' willing-\nness and intentions to seek counseling by Hobson (2008). In\nHobson's study, the experimental group was exposed to\nmental health education and the control group was not. The\nfindings revealed that means on the ISCI for the experimen-\ntal group were found to be significantly higher (M = 42.45,\ndents also completed questionnaires about their perceived\nlikelihood of seeking professional psychological help, the\nBenito & Short, 1998). In another study by Kelly and Archer\n10.40) was therefore considered slightly higher than Kelly\nstudies and was comparatively higher than in Hobson's\nWhile the ISC scale yielded a very good alpha, some of\nthe items in this scale might have been perceived as not war-\nranting the need for one to seek psychological help. For\nexample, being in the plus size range is not necessarily per-\nceived negatively by Batswana and subsequently not an issue\nworth the attention of a counselor. Problems related to speech\nanxiety, difficulty with friends, and difficulties of dating also\nreceived lower mean scores. Lack of knowledge on the avail-\nability of counseling resources could be one possible con-\ntributing factor, especially as noted earlier that psychology as\na profession is relatively new in the country of Botswana and\nformal training for undergraduates was only introduced in\n2004. Another possible explanation is that, in Botswana, the\npractices and approaches used in psychotherapy are mostly\nimported from the western world. As a result, the majority of\nthe population might still prefer traditional avenues like tra-\nditional healers, priests, family, and/or friends to deal with\nchallenges like dating problems.\nThese findings also point to the need for exposure to psy-\nchological education as these might help to dispel myths\nabout the field and make people more aware of the benefits\nthat one can accrue from seeking counseling. Furthermore,\nthe Batswana's cultural and historical views of the mentally\nTable 4. Students Intentions to Seek Counseling.\nArea of concern M SD\nTable 5. Correlation Matrix.\nNote.

These findings support past research\nthat has shown that negative attitudes toward help-seeking\nhas been found to reduce the likelihood of using mental\nhealth care services (e.g., Bathje & Pryor, 2011; Mojtabai et\nal., 2002). As predicted, the results also showed that SSOSH\nand SSRPH were negatively correlated with the intention to\nseek psychological help. However, it was only the SSRPH\nthat significantly predicted intentions of seeking psychologi-\ncal help. The findings that perceived social stigma and nega-\ntive attitudes negatively affect utilization of psychological\nservices are consistent with literature on the centrality of\nsociocultural factors of negative perceptions of mental disor-\nders for those afflicted with mental disorders (Kgathi, 2005;\nPapadopoulos et al., 2002) among groups that has not tradi-\ntionally used psychological help. Researchers have noted\namong these ethnic groups that where there is perceived\nnegative reaction of the family and the community (i.e.,\nwhere salient beliefs and valued social norms are incongru-\nent with seeking psychological help), individuals are less\nlikely to have intentions to seek help when faced with a psy-\nchological problem (Goldston et al., 2008).\nContrary to the stated hypothesis, internalized self-\nstigma was not found to significantly predict ISC among\nthe University of Botswana students. While researchers\nhave suggested that individuals from groups with collective\norientations may face greater self-stigma associated with\nseeking counseling (e.g., Goldston et al., 2008); such sug-\ngestions were, however, refuted in the current study.\nResearchers have suggested that stigma vary across cul-\ntures as it might be influenced by social and cultural con-\ntexts (Pescosolido, Martin, Lang, & Olafsdottir, 2008).\nThis may also be explained by suggestions that individuals\ntend to have either independent or interdependent self-con-\nstruals (Schein, 1984), and this might affect whether they\nare impacted more by the self-stigma or the social stigma.\nIn collectivistic cultures like Botswana, identity may be\nembedded in social groups in which interdependence\namong group members is emphasized (Cheung & Halpern,\ninterdependent self-construals, endorsing the societal ste-\nreotype of people who seek or receive help for psychologi-\ncal distress might be easier than for people with independent\nself-construals because how \"others\" view them is impor-\ntant for the development of the self. Furthermore, public/\nsocial stigma might also be more damaging as the individu-\nals might also like to protect their family/group image from\nassociations with mental disorders as it has been suggested\nthat in countries like Botswana even families with persons\nwho show signs of mental disorders may also be stigma-\ntized (Seloilwe & Thupayagale-Tshweneagae, 2007).\nLimitations of the Current Study\nIn interpreting the findings from the current study, some lim-\nitations should be taken into account. First, while the study\nused existing instruments that have been used broadly in\nstudying self-stigma, social stigma, intentions of seeking\npsychological help, and ATSPPH, in the current study, some\nof the instruments revealed low alphas necessitating removal\nof certain items to strengthen reliability. These findings sug-\ngest that the instruments that have been designed from differ-\nent contexts need to be piloted first to ensure their validity\nand/or reliability. Still relating to this limitation, even after\nremoving some of the items from the Attitude Toward\nSeeking Psychological Help scale, the scale still yielded an\nalpha lower than the recommended critical cutoff value.\nWhile the use of scales with such alphas has been recom-\nmended for preliminary studies, caution in interpreting the\nresults still need to be exercised as such measures might have\ninflated or deflated the results.\nIn addition, the study's sample limits the generalizability\nof the findings such that the findings might only apply to the\ncontext of the University of Botswana. The study also used a\ncross-sectional design where all the variables were assessed\nat one point in time. However, data analysis did not control\nfor intervening and moderating variables that could have\ncontributed to the relationships. The results were also based\non self-reporting, and these could have inflated the magni-\ntude of relationships due to common method variances.\nDespite these limitations, the results of the current study\nexpand previous findings regarding college students' inten-\ntions to seek counseling and also highlighted important simi-\nlarities in a different culture.\nImplications and Suggestions for Future Research\nOverall, the limitations of the present study point out several\navenues for future research. For example, the low reliability\nof the ATSPPH and the SSOSH suggests that researchers in\ndifferent contexts might need to design their own instru-\nments or use varying instruments for measuring the two con-\nstructs. Furthermore, to address concern regarding\nintervening variables, testing moderational models, media-\ntional models, longitudinal designs, and experimental\ndesigns might provide a more rigorous test of the proposed\nrelationships. The role of variables such as gender, upbring-\ning, age, and even spiritual beliefs could also be assessed\nwhen exploring the relationships between attitudes, stigma,\nand Batswana college students' ISC. For instance, the seem-\ningly existence of a parallel system where Batswana con-\ntinue to seek help from professional counselors and traditional\nhealers (Bhusumane, 2007) requires professionals to under-\nstand how indigenous method and practices may enhance or\ncomprise the counseling process.\nResearch has also suggested that university students tend\nto seek help from a variety of sources; however, the present\nPheko et al. 9\nstudy has only focused on help-seeking from mental health\nprofessionals. It is therefore important to investigate the stu-\ndent's intentions to seek help from other sources. Another\nimportant issue that needs to be investigated is whether\nintentions to seek counseling are also related to actual behav-\niors. While researchers such as Ajzen (2001) have demon-\nstrated the link between the attitudes, intentions, and\nbehavior, it is still important for us to conduct research that\nfully examines the link between intentions and behavior in\nthe Botswana context.\nGiven the importance of cultural norms and values, future\nresearch should also explore the intentions to seek psycho-\nlogical help from a cultural orientation point of view. For\nexample, Botswana is a country developing economically\nand socially, and such developments directly impact the cul-\ntural landscape of Batswana; hence, longitudinal studies\nwould be vital to examine the effects of those changes on\nperceptions of psychological help-seeking patterns.\nThe findings also have implications for research and psy-\nchological intervention program designs as there might exist\nspecific sociocultural factors that differently influence\nBatswana university students' decision to seek psychological\nhelp. Such interventions may include psychological education\nand outreach. Practitioners in Botswana may also need to be\ninnovative in coming up with varying treatment options for\nindividuals who may be experiencing or anticipating social\nstigma or any other negative consequences of seeking help.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nresearch was supported in part by the University of Botswana's\nNotes\n1. After removing the reverse-coded items from the Self-Stigma\nof Seeking Help (SSOSH) scale, the remaining items were\nagain subjected to item analysis. The Cronbach's alpha using\nfive items was .716 and this was deemed to be satisfactory.\nThe five items were therefore summed together to form an\nindex measuring SSOSH.\n2. For the Attitude Toward Seeking Professional Psychological\nHelp (ATSPPH) scale, the negatively worded items were also\nremoved and item analysis conducted again. Removing these\nproblematic items resulted in improvement of the Cronbach's\nalpha to .58. This alpha was nonetheless still lower than the\nrecommended cutoff value. The five items from the ATSPPH\nwere also summed together to form an index measuring\n3. The following correlations were reported: ATSPPH and inten-\ntions to seek counseling (ISC; r = .46, p < .01), ATSPPH and\nStigma of Receiving Psychological Help (SSRPH; r = -.23,\nanalyses were also conducted with the scales after removing\nthe items that reduced the alpha of the scale. The results using\nthe abridged revealed that ATSPPH, SSOSH, and SSRPH\npredicted the students' intentions to seek counseling (i.e.,\nHypotheses 2, 3, and 4). The total model was statistically\nthat 25% of the variance was explained by the three predic-\ntors. Hypothesis 2 stated that ATSPPH positively predicts ISC.\np < .001). Hypothesis 3 stated that SSRPH negatively predicts\np < .001). Hypothesis 4 stated that SSOSH negatively pre-\ndicts ISC. Hypothesis 4 was not supported (B = .01, t = .13,\np > .001). The results using shorter scales were not extremely\ndifferent from the results using longer original scales. It is,\nhowever, important to highlight the shorter scales revealed\nbetter reliabilities, better correlations, and the three predic-\ntors explained more variance (i.e., 25%) while using the two\nshorter scales.\nReferences\nAddis, M.
