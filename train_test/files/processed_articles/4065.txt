    "abstract": "Abstract\nMany social scientists have argued that research should be designed to perform a `critical' function, in the sense of\nchallenging the socio-political status quo. However, very often, the relationship between the political value judgements\nunderpinning this commitment and the values intrinsic to inquiry, as a distinct form of activity has been left obscure.\nFurthermore, the validity of those judgements has usually been treated either as obvious or as a matter of personal\ncommitment. But there is an influential tradition of work that claims to derive evaluative and prescriptive conclusions\nabout current society directly from factual investigation of its history and character. In the nineteenth century, Hegel and\nMarx were distinctive in treating the force of ethical and political ideals as stemming from the process of social\ndevelopment itself, rather than as coming from a separate realm, in the manner of Kant. Of course, the weaknesses of\nteleological meta-narratives of this kind soon came to be widely recognised, and `critical' researchers rarely appeal to\nthem explicitly today. It is therefore of some significance that, under the banner of critical realism, Bhaskar and others\nhave put forward arguments that are designed to serve a similar function, while avoiding the problems associated with\nteleological justification. The claim is that it is possible to derive negative evaluations of actions and institutions, along\nwith prescriptions for change, solely from the premise that these promote false ideas, or that they frustrate the meeting of\nneeds. In this article I assess these arguments, but conclude that they fail to provide effective support for a 'critical'\nsociology.\n",

Hammersley, Professor of Educational and Social Research, FELS, Level 3 Stuart Hall Building\nThe Open University, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes, MK7 6AA\nWhy Critical Realism Fails to Justify Critical Social Research1\nMartyn Hammersley*\n*Centre for Childhood Development and Learning, The Open University\n Key words: Critical realism, critical social science, explanatory critique, deriving ought from is\nIntroduction\nMy discussion of critical realism here focuses entirely on the justification for its being 'critical', I have no\ndisagreement with the idea that social research ought to adopt a realist position (Hammersley, 1992:ch3).\nMoreover, there is, of course, a sense in which all research should be critical: it should subject knowledge\nclaims to scrutiny. However, the phrase `critical realism', and the notion of `critical social science' generally,\ngoes beyond this. It requires that the phenomena being studied, and the societies in which they are found, are\nsubjected to criticism.2\nOne of the features that is distinctive to critical realism, against the background of other recent versions of\ncritical social science, is the explicit rationale it provides for research being 'critical', in the sense of aimed at\ndiagnosing defects in society; according to which, how value conclusions can be derived from descriptive and\nexplanatory evidence alone. Very often, critical researchers today fail to explicate the basis for their critical\norientation: features of the operation of social institutions are presented as if their undesirability, and the need\nto change them in particular ways, were immediately obvious. Yet, while these value judgements may often\nseem uncontentious, to both `critical' researchers and their main audiences, value assumptions are necessarily\ninvolved; and, unless judged from a perspective that already assumes their validity, there is no reason to\naccept them at face value. Justification is required.3\nOf course, there has long been, within the `critical' tradition, an influential rationale for the drawing of value\nconclusions from factual evidence: that offered by Marx. Versions of Marxism influenced by Hegel relied\nupon a teleological account of the development of the world from which value conclusions could be drawn\ndirectly. In this respect both Hegel and Marx were opposed to ethics in the more usual Kantian sense. For\nthem, any conclusions about what is good or bad, or what ought to be done, should be derived from an\nunderstanding of the nature of the world, not from some separate, abstract realm of values.4\nHowever,\ngenerally speaking, critical researchers today do not place explicit reliance upon the sort of teleological meta-\nnarrative promoted by Hegel and the early Marx. Indeed, this has long been subjected to severe criticism even\nwithin the Marxist tradition, with neo-Kantianism, pragmatism, structuralism, and post-structuralism\nproviding the resources at various times. Furthermore, the denial that value judgements \u00ad or, in some quarters,\nany kind of knowledge \u00ad can be rationally justified has become much more influential within a contemporary\nintellectual climate that Smith and Deemer (2000) label 'the era of relativism'. This encourages subjectivist\npositions according to which value judgements are matters of non-rational commitment; in other words, as\ninvolving undecidable or incommensurable judgements.\nAgainst this background, critical realism is of great importance because it offers an objective but non-\nteleological rationale for a `critical' orientation, in the form of the notion of explanatory critique: the idea that\ncriticism of social phenomena can be derived directly from sound explanatory models of them.5\nAnd just as\nMarx and Hegel had opposed Kantianism, so too some critical realists have challenged the sort of anti-\nnaturalistic ethics which became influential in twentieth century Anglo-Saxon philosophy, according to which\nvalue judgements are portrayed as subjective, and perhaps irrational, expressions of emotion or personal\nfeeling. Indeed, quite falsely it seems to me, they often portray this view of ethics and politics as the only\nalternative available to the ethical naturalism and moralism adopted by critical realism.\nWe can identify at least two arguments to be found within critical realism for warranting the notion of\nexplanatory critique, in other words for justifying the drawing of value conclusions from factual evidence\nalone. The first has the following components:\na) If we establish some fact about the world, we are simultaneously implying that other people\nought to believe it. This provides a model for deriving an `ought' from an `is'.\nb) If we can show that beliefs incompatible with this fact are systematically generated by a\nparticular social institution, then criticism of that institution automatically follows, other\nthings being equal.\nOn this basis it is claimed that evaluative and prescriptive conclusions can be logically derived solely from\nfactual evidence established by social science.6\nThis first argument is sometimes described as cognitive,\nbecause it relates to belief.\nThe second argument is non-cognitive, in the sense that it concerns other aspects of human life. It runs as\nfollows:\na) If we establish that someone suffers from an unmet need, such as the absence of food, then it\nfollows automatically, other things being equal, that action should be taken to meet this need.\nb) In addition, if it can be shown that the frustration of a need is not only generated by some\ninstitution but is necessary for the reproduction of that institution, then the conclusion follows\n(other things being equal) that the institution should be changed\nAgain, this is presented as an example of deriving a conclusion about what is wrong, and perhaps also about\nwhat ought to be done, solely from a statement about what is the case.\nI will evaluate each of these arguments in turn.\nThe Cognitive Argument\nAt the start it should be made clear that this argument does not succeed as a strict logical deduction of a value\nconclusion solely from factual premises (even aside from the inclusion of a ceteris paribus clause). In the first\ncomponent, the conclusion (that any statement of fact ought to be believed) only follows if we assume a value\nprinciple to the effect that we ought to believe what is true. It can, of course, be argued that this value\nprinciple is deeply entrenched within, or even constitutive of, human social life,7\nso that the assumption of this\nprinciple is trivial. I certainly agree that this value is constitutive for the goal of any kind of inquiry; and it\nmay apply more widely than this; though there are arguments which question whether it applies across the\nAt the very least, these arguments imply that this principle should not be assumed to apply at all times\nand in all circumstances; and they certainly indicate that other considerations may legitimately shape what we\nbelieve, in many circumstances, besides our assessments of whether or not it is true (Hammersley, 2009).\nThere is another, and more significant, problem with the first component of the cognitive argument. This is\nthat, as fallibilists, we should distinguish between a factual knowledge claim being true and our belief that it\nIt may - in practical, even if not in strictly logical, terms - follow automatically from the fact that\nsome factual claim is true that people ought to believe it.10\nHowever, it does not follow automatically from\nthe fact that I have come to the conclusion that statement X is true that others ought to believe it. It could\nequally follow that they ought to conclude that I am mad for believing such a thing. The only way to bridge\nthis gap is to assume that we can know with absolute certainty that a statement is true, so that the conclusion\ncan be derived from this that everyone ought to believe it. For example, it might be argued, along these lines,\nthat there is a scientific method whose use guarantees true conclusions. However, once we recognise that we\ncan never have absolute knowledge of this kind, as fallibilism insists, the argument falls. And, given that\nBhaskar's epistemological position is a fallibilist one, this first component of the cognitive argument generates\nan internal contradiction.\nMore particularly, it does not follow from the fact that social scientists claim to have established the validity\nof some knowledge claim that other people ought to believe it. Indeed, as rationalists we might expect, and\nhope, that people would exercise their own critical faculties rather than simply deferring to the authority of\nsocial science, especially since much of what is currently put forward as social scientific knowledge is open to\nserious dispute. Yet, for the cognitive argument to hold we must assume that social science is capable of\nproducing knowledge whose validity is beyond all possible doubt, so that it should be accepted 'on authority'.\nThere are also problems with the other component of the cognitive argument: about the role of institutions. A\nfirst one concerns the idea that if an institution is generating beliefs that are incompatible with what has been\n'established' by social science, then it must be treated as operating in an irrational manner and is therefore\nopen to legitimate critique in these terms. In this way, the sort of explanatory critique advocated by critical\nrealists under the heading of the cognitive argument shares with some concepts of ideology the assumption\nthat beliefs which are false are caused in a different way from, or at least by different types of factor to, beliefs\nthat are true. The simplest formulation of this is that true beliefs are caused by reality whereas false beliefs are\ngenerated in other ways. However, I suggest that, if we wish to speak in this confusing manner, all beliefs are\ncaused by reality, and there is no strong relationship between how they are caused and whether or not they\nare true. This is a difficult issue, but in my view whatever one thinks of the subsequent development of the\nsocial studies of science movement, its original insight - the principle of symmetry - was correct (See Barnes,\n1974 and Bloor, 1976). This principle held that we should not assume that true knowledge claims are\ngenerated in any fundamentally different way from those in which false knowledge claims are produced.\nOne argument that might be presented against the symmetry principle is that it undercuts social science itself,\non the grounds that it denies that there are ways of pursuing inquiry that are more likely than others to\ngenerate sound knowledge. However, this conclusion does not follow. What is denied is that there is any\nstrong, systematic causal relationship between how inquiry is pursued and whether or not the conclusions\nreached are true; there is no method or starting point that can guarantee truth. And much the same applies at\nthe meta-level of determining whether any set of conclusions is true or false. This leaves it open for us to\nrecognise that some methods - for example, those labelled by Peirce (1877) as the methods of tenacity,\nauthority, and a priori argument - are much less likely to produce true conclusions, while those of science are\nmore likely to do so. Nevertheless, people adopting the first three methods may, of course, reach true\nconclusions, while much rational inquiry has produced false findings. Furthermore, while we can argue that\ninquiry following a certain institutionalised pattern is desirable in minimising the chances of error, compared\nto following some other method, what is involved here is not the adoption of some utterly distinctive form of\nbehaviour but rather a specialised refinement of behaviour of a kind that is to be found in other contexts too.\nIn addition, all manner of motivations may operate on the decision to engage in research in a scientific way, of\nthe same kinds that motivate other, very different, kinds of action.\nIn summary, I think there are particular practices that, other things being equal, will be likely to increase the\nchances of our coming to sound conclusions, compared to others; or perhaps it would be better to say 'reduce\nthe chances of our reaching false conclusions'. These would be those practices that are usually labelled\nscientific, compared for instance with those which seek to draw conclusions about the nature of the physical\nuniverse by explicating what is in some religious book. There are also structural processes that tend to\ngenerate outcomes that may involve certain sorts of bias. But just as scientific method does not guarantee the\nvalidity of our conclusions nor do these structural processes always produce error. The most fundamental\npoint of all is that systematic causal relations may well tend to generate particular sorts of belief in particular\nsorts of circumstance, but truth/falsity is an evaluative categorisation that does not have any intrinsic or\ninternal relation to causality.\nAnother problem with the second component of the cognitive argument concerns the assumption that\ninstitutions either generate false beliefs or they generate true beliefs. Yet, even if we assume that institutions\ngenerate, or are constituted in terms of, specific sets of beliefs in some reasonably straightforward fashion, and\nI am not sure this is true, we can expect that most institutions will generate both true and false beliefs. Given\nthis, no evaluation or prescription would follow in the automatic manner that critical realists wish it to do from\nthe fact that an institution generates some false beliefs, unless we were to assume that we should try to change\nall institutions until they only generate entirely true beliefs. Moreover, apart from anything else, this latter\nposition seems to involve a form of intellectualism: the idea that other social activities should be evaluated in\nexactly the same manner as scholarly inquiry. In my view, different sorts of activity require different kinds of\nrationality, depending upon their goals.\nSo, contrary to the claims made for it, the first argument does not succeed in deriving value conclusions solely\nfrom factual evidence, either in strictly logical terms or in some other way. As a result, it does not provide a\nsecure basis for arguing that realism, or social science, can and should be `critical'.\nThe non-cognitive argument\nThe second argument that critical realists have put forward to legitimate their `critical' orientation appeals to\nthe concept of need. This also fails as a purported logical derivation of value conclusions solely from factual\nevidence, because `need' is a quasi-evaluative term: it concerns an actual or potential gap between what is and\nAny practical evaluation of this kind can and should be sharply distinguished from a\nfactual statement to the effect that there is a difference between what exists and what would be desirable or\nnecessary in terms of some evaluative standard that is simply identified rather than asserted. For instance, we\nmust draw a line between the factual statement that some person does not have food and is likely die as a\nresult, and the evaluation that this is an undesirable situation. The implicit value assumption involved is: `no\nhuman being should starve to death'. Of course, as with the first critical realist argument, it could be countered\nthat even though, strictly speaking, there is a logical gap between factual evidence and value conclusion here,\nthe implicit principle on which reliance is being placed is built into the very fabric of human life: that\nsomeone should not be allowed to starve to death is a fundamental ethical principle (see Sayer, 2008; Elder-\nVass, 2008). This may be so, though what I will say below at least qualifies it. However, the fundamental\npoint remains that at least one value assumption is required to reach a value conclusion, in this case as in\nothers.\nMy second point is that, even in the case of basic needs, there are situations where human beings do not apply\nthis value principle, may well be prepared to justify this, and where we might reasonably agree with them. For\nexample, one of the strategies used in wars is to cut off supplies to the opposing army, and we might feel few\nqualms about this if the people whom we were effectively condemning to starvation were responsible for the\nmost terrible atrocities and/or this were the only way of defending ourselves from them. Elder-Vass (2008:16)\nargues that `it is a rather minimal implication of valuing humans that we should support their staying alive',\nbut then adds `assuming that they rationally wish to do so', a qualification that points to another situation\nwhere leaving someone to starve could be the right thing to do.\nBhaskar's inclusion of an `other things being equal' clause in this second argument, as in the first, indicates\nthat he recognises that there are circumstances where even basic needs ought not to be met. However, Collier\nparibus in this context. The questions for me are: who should decide when relevant considerations are and are\nnot `equal', and on what grounds? More particularly, is the social scientist in a position to do this with any\ndistinctive intellectual authority? In other words, can it be done entirely on the basis of factual evidence\nderived from research? My answer to the last of these questions is `no', and this implies that social scientists\nhave no distinctive expertise in making decisions about whether `other things are equal' in any particular case.\nThis undercuts any direct inference from factual evidence alone to value conclusions, even allowing for\nceteris paribus conditions.12\nTo clarify, let me sketch what seems to be involved in the drawing of value conclusions:\nWe start with a description of a situation, perhaps along with some explanation of how it came\nabout, and perhaps also some prediction about what will result. Taking the range of value principles\nthat are available, some of them (usually more than one) will be found relevant to this situation.\nEach of these values sets up a line of potential evaluative and/or prescriptive argument. Given this,\nin evaluating the situation we must decide on the priority that ought to operate amongst these value\nprinciples, or how they should be combined, and we must determine what the implications of this\nare for how we evaluate the situation as good or bad, right or wrong; and/or decide what should or\nshould not be done. Note that the value judgement that results here is unlikely to be the outcome of a\nfixed ranking of these value principles. Instead, what relative priority we give them on this occasion\nwill depend upon our purposes, what we see as our responsibilities, our relation to the people\ninvolved, how well they seem to apply to this situation, and so on. 13\nIf this is a fair characterisation of the nature of the task, then formulating what is involved as the application of\na single value principle whose relevance derives from the facts of the case, and which must be applied `other\nthings being equal', is not helpful. The process is far more complex than this and leaves room for reasonable\ndisagreement. At the very least, my account here makes clear that no conclusion about what is good or bad\nabout the situation, and what should or should not be done, can be logically derived solely from social science\nevidence about the matter. Rather, we must adjudicate among and combine relevant value principles in ways\nwe judge to be appropriate in the circumstances. Moreover, neither the social scientist nor the philosopher has\nany superior expertise or authority in doing this, and very often there will be scope for disagreement about\nwhat the evaluation and the prescription should be.\nThe third point I want to make is that many needs are more problematic than hunger. Indeed, often, basic\nneeds merge into more complex and controversial ones. For example, it could plausibly be argued that literacy\nand numeracy are basic needs in contemporary society. But how exactly are we to define `literacy' and\n`numeracy' here? For instance, should we limit ourselves to elementary functional concerns or ought we to be\nintroducing students to the worlds of literature and pure mathematics? In this case, and others, there is clearly\nconsiderable room for reasonable disagreement about what does and does not count as a need, as well as about\nwhether or not a need should be met in any particular circumstance and what would count as meeting it. And\nthese problems cannot be resolved entirely in terms of descriptive and explanatory evidence. Any resolution\nwould require value argument, using appeals to: rights and/or obligations; the principle of universalisability;\nprecedents; other cases that are similar or different in key respects; examples generated by counterfactual\nhypotheses; and so on. This is why there are likely to be multiple reasonable views in most instances; an\noutcome that partly reflects the fact that, while in the case of disagreement about well-formulated factual\nquestions there is a single underlying correct answer, this is not the case with value questions (see Larmore,\nSo, once again, there is no direct or immediate route from factual research evidence to value conclusions.\nRather, any such inference necessarily depends upon value assumptions, both about any particular need and\nabout whether there are other overriding values. Moreover, value pluralism, the fact that there are always\nmultiple values that could be seen as relevant, and will often be felt to be relevant, means that there are\nfrequently grounds for reasonable disagreement. Given this, there is no justification for claiming that social\nscientists can conclusively determine what counts as a need that should be met on any particular occasion. For\nthem to claim this capacity would amount to a form of scientism: they would be exceeding the authority of\nscientific research, over-extending the domain of legitimate claims to research expertise.\nOf course, it might be argued that while social science cannot legitimately claim to produce value judgements\nabout particular situations, it can tell us what value principles ought to be taken into account in human social\nlife in general terms (see Bhaskar, 1986; Sayer, 2008). Two points need to be made about this. First, this does\nnot provide sufficient basis for the argument that social research should be `critical' in the required sense,\nsince the latter involves social scientists `taking a stand', as regards what is wrong and what ought to be done\nabout some particular issue in some particular socio-historical situation. Second, while biological and social\nscience can show why particular value principles have tended to emerge within human communities at\nparticular times, this does not in itself establish that, as humans or even as members of a particular\ncommunity, we should adopt those principles; even though the evidence provided would be relevant to such a\nIt should be clear, then, that the first component of the non-cognitive argument is not defensible; and since the\nsecond depends upon it, that fails too. Moreover, there are further problems with this second component. We\ncan expect that any institution is likely to meet some needs but frustrate others (on various interpretations),\nand so any assessment of it will have to take account of both aspects. And, since this is a matter for practical\nvalue judgement, here too social science cannot claim any distinctive authority.\nConclusion\nI have argued that, in the context of critical social science today, critical realism is distinctive in putting\nforward a clear rationale for how evaluative conclusions can be derived directly from research evidence, such\nthat social scientists can present evaluative and prescriptive conclusions as validated by their work. In other\nwords, critical realism offers a rationale for being `critical'. However, I have shown that neither of the two\narguments making up this rationale is convincing. Of course, establishing this does not automatically undercut\nthe project of critical social science, but it weakens it considerably, as against the alternative prospect of a\nsocial science committed solely to producing factual conclusions. Moreover, there are other reasons why we\nshould reject the `critical' project. One of the most important is that the simultaneous attempt both to produce\nknowledge and to bring about social change of some kind (or, for that matter, to preserve the status quo) is\nliable considerably to increase the danger of bias (Foster et al., 1996; Hammersley, 2000).\nNote that my commitment to the principle that researchers should strive to be value neutral or objective does\nnot imply that value argument is unimportant, or that it is irrational. Indeed, I believe such argument is\nessential to governance and to everyday life, though it seems to me that much current public discussion is of\npoor quality. My point is simply that social scientists, whether realists or non-realists, have no distinctive\nexpertise to determine what is good or bad about the situations they seek to describe and explain; or what, if\nanything, should be done about them. This is because even where value judgements rely on research evidence\nthey also necessarily depend upon other factual assumptions and upon value principles that are plural and\noften in conflict.15\nIn other words, because they are not able to validate any teleological meta-narrative or to\nderive value conclusions directly from factual evidence, their authority does not extend to drawing value\nconclusions: to producing evaluations and prescriptions as if these could be validated primarily through the\nresearch process or on the basis of their expertise. While social scientists, like others, can engage in value\nargument, to which both factual evidence and value principles will be relevant, they must not suggest or imply\nthat any value conclusions they reach can be validated through their work, given that there is almost always\nroom for reasonable disagreement about which value principles are relevant, and about the appropriate priority\namongst them on any particular occasion. What is required to reach value conclusions is practical, situated\nargument: neither philosophy nor science can tell us, on its own, whether a situation is good or bad, who is to\nblame, or what we should do about it. And they should not pretend to have this capacity.\nThis is not to deny that academic social science has an important and distinctive role in relation to many forms\nof political practice. Its role is to establish relevant facts about social actions, events, and institutions; while\nthat of philosophy, at least in part, is to clarify the concepts involved in factual and value arguments. These\ncontributions are very important, especially in a political culture such as that in which we now live, where\nspurious debates based on taken-for-granted assumptions of doubtful validity (both factual and evaluative) are\ncommon. But it is also important that the appropriate limits to what social research can offer are recognised by\nboth researchers and their audiences. The claim made by critical realism that social science can move beyond\nthose limits is not only false but encourages bias and amounts to scientism.\nReferences\nAnderson, E.

In some contexts, for example that\nof literary criticism, being `critical' means `subjecting something to assessment', an assessment that can result in\nfavourable as well as negative judgements.

This negativity surely requires justification. Adorno has provided a rationale for it (see\nThomson, 2006), but it is far from convincing; and it is not clear whether it would be accepted by critical realists.\n4 On the positions of Hegel and Marx in relation to ethics, and concepts like justice and need, see Wood 1981:part 3,\n5 Accounts of this aspect of critical realism are to be found in a variety of places: Archer et al. 1997:pp233-57 and Part\nFor useful brief summary of the arguments on each side, see Elder-Vass 2008a, and in a more extended discussion\n(Elder-Vass, 2008b) he has examined Bhaskar's arguments about this issue in some detail, including his later appeal to\nmeta-reality. I have excluded the latter from consideration here, partly on the grounds that this aspect of his later work,\nthe `spiritual turn' is not accepted even by many critical realists, and the extent to which it is compatible with realism is\ndebatable.\n6 The question of whether or not such inferences are possible, whether there is a distinction between factual and value\nstatements and if so what its character is, and so on, have of course long been a matter of dispute among philosophers,\n7 For a genealogy along these lines, see Williams 2002.\n8 These include those put forward by William James about what it is good to believe, in his critique of W. K. Clifford's\ninsistence that we should only believe those propositions for which we have strong evidence (James, 1909; Hollinger,\n9 There is variation in the meaning of the word `fact' in everyday usage that can cause misconceptions in this area. It can\nmean `matters of fact as against matters of value', `well-established knowledge rather than speculation', or `what is true\nas against what is false'. Clearly, these distinctions are not isomorphic. Here I am using the term in the first sense.\n10 Whether the validity of a factual claim is a matter of fact is an interesting philosophical issue that I will leave on one\nside.\n11 Putnam 2002 refers to concepts like this as having a `thick ethical' character, in that descriptive and value components\nare closely entangled in such a way that they cannot be separated. This analysis is correct, but he fails to distinguish\nbetween the situation where a system of values serves as a framework for picking out relevant facts and its serving as a\nbasis for drawing practical conclusions, evaluations or prescriptions. He discusses Sen's critique of conventional welfare\neconomics, but fails to address Max Weber's much earlier assessment of the failings of normative economics: see Bruun\n12 It should be noted that there is an important distinction between attaching ceteris paribus clauses to theories, which\nwill relate to the conditions under which the causal relations the theory identifies operate, and attaching such clauses to\nvalue conclusions where they relate to the conditions under which those conclusions should be adopted. In the first case\nthere must be some reasonable hope that such a set of conditions can be specified, at least in principle, whereas in the\nsecond case there is no prospect of this because of value plurality and the scope for reasonable disagreement, as I will\nargue in the remainder of the article.\n13 It should be noted that if we take the view, as I think we should, that descriptions and explanations are always framed\nin terms of value assumptions that establish their relevance, this does not alter the argument that plural values are likely\nto be available for constructing evaluations. Furthermore, the value relevance framework itself may be open to challenge\nand revision.\n14 Elder-Vass (2008:18) argues that in situations approximating to Habermas's ideal speech situation ethical discussion\ncould resolve conflicts of interest, and presumably also conflicts in priority given to different values. While this will\nsometimes be possible, I suspect that most of the time it would not be (Hammersley, 2005). Furthermore, there is no\ndistinctive role here for social scientists. For example, they do not have superior expertise in judging whether people are\nconducting ethical discussion honestly and sincerely, whether all who should participate are doing so, or whether the\ndiscussion is being distorted by power differences. Here, too, value judgements are involved.\n15 Social scientists do of course have the authority to claim expertise in relation to factual matters; but even here they do\nnot have sole or absolute authority."
