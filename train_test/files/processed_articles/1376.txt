NHANES III\nwas a multistage, stratified, probability sample of the non-\ninstitutionalized civilian U.S. population, ages 2 months and\nover (21). The survey was conducted by the National Center\nfor Health Statistics (NCHS) and included administration of\na questionnaire at home and a full medical exam along with\na battery of tests in a special mobile examination center\n(MEC) (21). Demographic and medical history information\nwas obtained during the household interview. The MEC\nexam included a physical and dental exam, dietary inter-\nview, body measurements, and collection of blood and urine\nsamples. Body weight, height, and circumference at various\nbody sites were measured using standardized procedures in\nthe MEC (21). Response to the question--\"Do you consider\nyourself over-, under-, or the right weight?\"--provided in-\nformation on self-perceived body-weight status.\nDietary Assessment Method\nA 24-hour dietary recall was collected by a trained di-\netary interviewer in a MEC interview using an automated,\nmicrocomputer-based interview and coding system (21).\nThe type and amount of foods consumed were recalled\nusing recall aids such as abstract food models, special\ncharts, measuring cups, and rulers to help in quantifying the\namounts consumed. Special probes were used to help the\nrecall of commonly forgotten items such as condiments,\naccompaniments, fast foods, alcoholic beverages, etc.\nAnalytic Sample\nAll NHANES III respondents ages 12 to 18 years with a\n24-hour recall considered complete and reliable by the\nNCHS were eligible for inclusion in this study (n  2765).\nRespondents who were pregnant (n  34), nursing (n  3),\nor missing information on self-perceived body weight (n \nAssessment of Intake of Low-Nutrient-Dense Foods\nTo determine the intake of low-nutrient-dense foods, it\nwas necessary to identify foods belonging in this category\nfrom those reported in the 24-hour dietary recall. As a first\nstep, the 2578 foods reported by the analytic sample were\nclassified as belonging to one or more of the five major food\ngroups (dairy, fruit, grain, meat/alternate, and vegetable) or\nthe low-nutrient-dense food group using methods we have\ndescribed previously (22\u00ad24). Briefly, the assignment of\nfoods into the various groups was dependent on their nutri-\nent content and uses in the diet. The dairy group included\nmilk, yogurt, cheese, and buttermilk, but excluded butter,\ncream cheese, and dairy desserts. The fruit group included\nall fresh, frozen, dried, and canned fruits and fruit juices, but\nexcluded fruit drinks. The grain group included all breads,\ncereals, pastas, and rice, but excluded pastries. The meat\ngroup included meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and meat alternates\nsuch as dried beans, nuts, and seeds. The vegetable group\nincluded all raw or cooked fresh, frozen, and canned vege-\ntables and juices. Mixed dishes containing foods from sev-\neral groups were grouped into all the relevant groups. Foods\nexcluded from these major food groups were grouped into\nthe low-nutrient-dense foods group. The low-nutrient-dense\nfoods were further placed into five subgroups as follows: 1)\nvisible fat--butter, oil, dressings, gravies, etc., 2) sweeten-\ners--sugar, syrup, candy, carbonated and noncarbonated\nsweetened drinks, etc., 3) baked and dairy desserts--cook-\nies, cakes, pies, pastries, ice cream, puddings, cheesecakes,\netc., 4) salted snacks--potato, corn, and tortilla chips, etc.,\nand 5) miscellaneous--coffee, tea, condiments, spices, etc.\nThe NHANES III nutrient database for individual foods,\nwhich is derived from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's\nSurvey Nutrient Data base, was used for estimating energy\nand nutrient content of all foods (25,26). The micronutrients\nexamined included the following: vitamins A, E, B6\n,\nfolate, and C, and the minerals iron, calcium, and zinc. The\nintake of each nutrient was compared with the respective\nage- and sex-specific standard available. The standards used\nwere Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) for protein and all\nmicronutrients (27\u00ad31). For all micronutrients except cal-\ncium, the estimated average requirement (EAR) was used as\nthe standard. For calcium, an EAR is not yet available;\ntherefore, the mean reported amount was examined. Be-\ncause the major question of this study deals with dietary\nreporting, this paper is limited to dietary nutrient intakes and\ndoes not consider nutrients from supplements.\nAs an estimate of dietary misreporting, a ratio of reported\nenergy intake (EI) to energy expenditure for basal needs\n(BEE) was computed. BEE was estimated using prediction\nequations developed by the DRI committee for normal and\nData on serum ascorbic acid, folate, and carotenoid con-\ncentration were obtained from the NCHS (21,32). The\nmethods used for measurement of these serum analytes and\ntheir associated errors have been described (21,32). Serum\nfolate, ascorbic acid, and the carotenoids---carotene,\n-carotene, -cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin, and lyco-\npene--were chosen because the dietary intake of these\nnutrients are believed to be major determinants of serum\nconcentration of the respective nutrient and can thus serve\nas biomarkers of dietary exposure (29,30).\nStatistical Analyses\nThe mean daily energy, percentage of energy from ma-\ncronutrients and low-nutrient-dense foods, and mean per-\ncentage of the population meeting the DRI for selected\nnutrients were obtained by categories of self-perceived\nbody-weight status (considered self over-, under-, or correct\nweight). Because of previous reports of gender differences\nin dietary patterns of adolescents, all analyses were sex-\nBody Weight and Dietary Reporting by Teens, Kant\nspecific. The sex-specific estimates of nutrient and food\ngroup intake were adjusted for age (continuous), race/eth-\nnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican\nAmerican, and other), BMI (continuous), and whether an\nattempt was made to lose weight in past 12 months (yes or\nno). The estimate of mean serum concentration of each\nanalyte by categories of self-perceived body weight were\nadjusted for age, race/ethnicity, dietary intake of the rele-\nvant nutrient, supplement use in the 24 hours before phle-\nbotomy, supplement use in the past month, hours of fasting\nbefore phlebotomy, BMI, and whether an attempt was made\nto lose weight in the past 12 months (yes or no), and\nsmoking status (yes smoked 100 cigarettes vs. no). For\nserum carotenoids, serum total cholesterol and triglycerides\nwere additional covariates.\nThe procedure used for obtaining covariate-adjusted es-\ntimates and SEs from survey data are based on Taylor\nLinearization methods according to Graubard and Korn\n(33). All statistical analyses were performed using SAS\n(34), and software designed for analysis of survey data\n(SUDAAN) (35). This software generates variance esti-\nmates that are corrected for multistage stratified probability\ndesign of complex surveys. Sample weights provided by the\nNCHS to correct for differential probabilities of selection,\nnoncoverage, and nonresponse were used in all analyses to\nobtain point estimates (21).\nThe independent association of self-perceived body\nweight with food and nutrient intake was examined using\nregression procedures to adjust for covariates mentioned\nabove. Linear regression procedures were used when the\noutcome variables were continuous (e.g., dietary nutrient\nintake or serum analyte concentration). For categorical out-\ncomes such as whether or not a nutrient intake standard was\nmet, logistic regression procedures were used.\nResults\nTable 1 presents the sociodemographic and lifestyle char-\nacteristics of respondents in the three categories of self-\nperceived body weight. Girls made up a higher proportion\n(66%) of those who perceived themselves as overweight.\nOver 90% of those who considered themselves as over-\nweight wanted to weigh less, and over 65% had tried to lose\nweight in the past year.\nEnergy and Macronutrient Intake Reporting\nThe mean amount of all foods, number of unique foods,\nnumber of eating occasions, energy, ratio of EI/BEE, per-\ncentage of energy from macronutrients, and grams of fiber\nreported by boys or girls who perceived themselves as\noverweight were not significantly different from those who\nperceived themselves at the right weight (Table 2). BMI was\na significant negative predictor of EI/BEE ratio in both boys\nand girls. In boys, BMI related negatively with the esti-\nmated percentage of energy from carbohydrate and grams of\ndietary fiber, but positively with percentage of energy from\nprotein (Table 2). Boys responding positively to attempting\nweight loss in the past 12 months reported significantly\nlower mean amounts of all foods and beverages, number of\nunique foods, total energy, ratio of EI/BEE, and grams of\nfiber. The reported energy and macronutrient intake of girls\nwho had attempted weight loss in the past 12 months were\nnot different from those who had not attempted.\nLow-Nutrient-Dense Foods Reporting\nSelf-perceived body-weight status and attempted weight\nloss in the past year were not significant predictors of the\npercentage of energy from all low-nutrient-dense foods or\nsubgroups (except salty snacks in girls; Table 3). In boys,\nBMI was a significant negative predictor of percentage of\nenergy from all low-nutrient-dense foods, desserts, and salty\nsnacks subgroups, but a positive predictor of percentage of\nenergy from visible fats.\nProportion Meeting Standards for Intake of Fat,\nProtein, and Selected Micronutrients on Recall Day\nThe mean amount of calcium intake in girls perceiving\nthemselves as overweight relative to those perceiving them-\nselves at the right weight was lower (Table 4). Boys who\nperceived themselves as overweight were more likely to\nreport 10% energy from saturated fat. The proportion of\nboys reporting 30% energy from fat, 10% energy from\nsaturated fat, or the EAR for vitamin C were related in-\nversely with BMI. Attempted weight loss in the past year\nwas a negative predictor of meeting the EAR for vitamin C,\nfolate, and vitamin B6\nin boys and iron in girls.\nSerum Vitamin and Carotenoid Concentrations\nNeither self-perceived body-weight status nor attempted\nweight loss in the past year were significant predictors of\nserum concentrations of folate, ascorbate, and the carote-\nnoids (Table 5). In both boys and girls, BMI was a signif-\nicant negative predictor of serum concentration of all caro-\ntenoids examined (except -carotene in girls and lycopene\nin boys). Dietary folate, ascorbic acid, and carotene intake\nwere related positively with serum concentration of the\nrespective nutrient.\nFor 17- to 18-year-olds, information on whether they\nwere trying to lose weight at the time of the survey was\navailable. In regression models for 17- to 18-year-olds in-\ncluding this information, the associations presented above\nremained unchanged (data not shown).\nBody Weight and Dietary Reporting by Teens, Kant\nTable 1.

First, given the large proportion of girls who consid-\nered themselves overweight, we expected to find significant\ndifferences in food-intake reporting among self-perceived\nweight categories in girls. However, the results indicate\notherwise. Second, the expected pattern of possible inten-\ntional misreporting, i.e., lower amounts of low-nutrient-\ndense foods that may have been perceived as socially un-\ndesirable but higher amounts of nutrient-dense foods in\nrelation to self-perceived body weight or attempted weight\nloss in the past year, were not observed in this study. No\ndirectly comparable published reports are available for cor-\nroboration because of differences in measures of weight\ndissatisfaction, study design, age of subjects, and dietary\nmethods. However, reports of related studies present a\nmixed picture. Wardle and Beale (8) reported higher body-\nsize dissatisfaction among 12- to 18-year-old girls relative\nto boys; girls were also more likely to evaluate foods\nnegatively. However, differences in reported dietary intake\nwere not examined in this study (8). MacDonald et al. (7)\nfound that 14- to 18-year-old Canadian girls with poor-\nquality diets were more likely to perceive themselves as\nlarger in body size than girls with good diets. Conversely,\nextent of body-image dissatisfaction determined from pic-\ntorial representation of body silhouettes in 7- to 16-year-old\ngirls did not relate with reported energy and percentage of\nenergy from macronutrients (36).\nAlthough quantitative differences in the amount of en-\nergy, macronutrients, and micronutrients reported by girls in\nvarious self-perceived body-weight categories were not sig-\nnificant, calcium was found to be an exception, suggesting\nqualitative differences in the nature of foods reported. Given\nthat most adolescent girls are at risk for inadequate calcium\nintakes, girls who perceive themselves as overweight re-\nquire special attention with regard to this nutrient.\nFor boys, BMI was a significant predictor of several\ndietary outcomes, including reporting of percentage of en-\nergy from macronutrients and low-nutrient-dense foods.\nAlthough mean percentage of energy from fat did not relate\nto BMI in boys, BMI was a positive correlate of percentage\nof energy from visible/discretionary fat and a negative cor-\nrelate of meeting the standards of fat intake and vitamin C.\nThese results are contrary to the expectation of increasing\nBMI being associated with reporting of lower fat intake and\nhigher intake of nutritionally desirable foods. Having at-\ntempted weight loss in the past year also increased the risk\nof not meeting the standard on recall day for ascorbic acid,\nfolate, and vitamin B6\nintakes in boys and iron in girls.\nNutrient-intake profiles of most adults attempting to control\nweight tend not to place them at risk of deficiency and may\nlescents attempting weight loss, however, do not report\nbetter food-intake patterns and consequently may have com-\nOne strength of this study is the availability of biomark-\ners (serum folate, ascorbate, and carotenoids). Reported\ndietary intake of each of these nutrients (folate, ascorbate,\nand carotenoids) was found to be significantly associated\nwith serum concentration of the respective nutrient, thus\nconfirming the general validity of the reported dietary in-\ntake of these nutrients in NHANES III. The self-perceived\nbody-weight status or history of attempted weight loss did\nnot relate with any of the biomarkers examined. BMI,\nhowever, was a negative correlate of serum concentration of\nmost carotenoids. There may be at least two possible ex-\nplanations for observing an association between a nondi-\netary variable (such as self-perceived body weight status,\nBMI, or attempted weight loss) and serum concentration of\na nutrient after adjustment for the relevant dietary nutrient\nintake. First, the nondietary variable may relate to intake\n(e.g., biased vs. nonbiased reporting) or it may influence in\nvivo nutrient metabolism and distribution. For example, in\nboys, dietary ascorbic acid reporting was negatively related\nto BMI; however, BMI was not an independent predictor of\nserum ascorbic acid concentration in dietary ascorbate\u00ad\nadjusted models, suggesting that BMI could provide no\nadditional information about serum ascorbate. However,\nBMI-serum carotenoid association was significant, whereas\ntotal dietary carotenoid intake was not related to BMI. It is\nconceivable that biased reporting of carotenoid food sources\nmay be partially responsible for this observed association.\nOthers have also reported an association between BMI and\nserum - and -carotene in adolescents (39) and adults\n(40,41). Little has been published on possible explanations\nfor the BMI effect on circulating carotenoids. Putative rea-\nsons may include increased use, dilution, redistribution, or\ntissue sequestration of these analytes (41). Recent data on\nvitamin D metabolism in association with adiposity suggest\nthat tissue sequestration of fat soluble analytes may partially\nexplain lower circulating levels (42). In this case, serum\nconcentrations of these sequestered nutrients should in-\ncrease with mobilization of fat stores associated with weight\nloss. However, there are few published studies where this\nhypothesis has been examined by sequential evaluation of\nbiomarker status in subjects trying to lose weight. Health\nimplications, if any, of this possible nutrient redistribution\nremain unknown.\nThe results of this study should be interpreted with con-\nsideration of the following limitations. First, the method of\ndietary assessment was a single 24-hour recall. All methods\nof dietary assessment, including the recall, contain measure-\nment errors, thus limiting its usefulness for determining the\nusual dietary intake of individuals (43). However, the\nmethod can provide reliable estimates of intake of groups\n(43). Accordingly, in this study, all comparisons about\ndietary intake are limited to those among categories of\nBody Weight and Dietary Reporting by Teens, Kant\nself-perceived body weight. The observed positive associa-\ntion of dietary intake with selected biomarkers as discussed\nabove also increases confidence in the dietary data. Esti-\nmates of prevalence of micronutrient inadequacy from 24-\nhour recall data are likely to be overestimated because of\nintraindividual variation in food intake. Therefore, the re-\nsults presented in Table 4 should be interpreted cautiously\nas suggestive of trends and limited to the recall day.\nOne source of measurement error in self-reported dietary\ninformation is the recognized problem of underreporting of\nfood intake (20,43). Dietary underreporting, especially in\ngirls, may have contributed to the inability to find signifi-\ncant differences in the various outcomes examined. Pub-\nlished evidence suggests widely prevalent underreporting of\nenergy intake among adolescents, with increasing adiposity\ndid not relate to reported energy intake; however, the ratio\nof EI/BEE was related inversely to BMI in both boys and\ngirls, suggesting lower energy reporting in relation with\nBMI. Self-perceived body-weight status, although strongly\nassociated with BMI, was not independently related with\nreported energy intake or the ratio of EI/BEE, indicating\nthat BMI was a stronger correlate of dietary energy report-\ning in 12- to 18-year-olds in the NHANES III. Similarly,\nthere were surprisingly few differences among categories of\nself-perceived weight in reported behaviors related to en-\nergy expenditures--exercise and television viewing.\nIn conclusion, these data suggest that perceiving oneself\nas overweight was not reflected in reported food intake of\nadolescents; BMI, however, remained an independent cor-\nrelate of dietary reporting.\n"
