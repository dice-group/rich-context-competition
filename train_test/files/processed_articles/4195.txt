Whereas the aetiology and pathogenesis of GBS re-\nmain unclear, pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF\n(tumour necrosis factor ), are reported to be elevated\nearly in the course of GBS and may initiate nerve in-\njury by activating the BNB. Previously, we reported that\ndisrupting leucocyte trafficking in vivo therapeutically at-\ntenuates the course of an established animal model of\nGBS. Here, PNMECs (peripheral nerve microvascular en-\ndothelial cells) that form the BNB were harvested from\nrat sciatic nerves, immortalized by SV40 (simian virus 40)\nlarge T antigen transduction and subsequently challenged\nwith TNF. Relative changes in CCL2 (chemokine ligand\n2) and ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) expres-\nsion were determined. We report that TNF elicits marked\ndose- and time-dependent increases in CCL2 and ICAM-1\nmRNA and protein content and promotes secretion of func-\ntional CCL2 from immortalized and primary PNMEC cultures.\nTNF-mediated secretion of CCL2 promotes, in vitro, the\ntransendothelialmigrationofCCR2-expressingTHP-1mono-\ncytes.

Although the ae-\ntiology of GBS remains unknown, the pathogenesis of GBS\nprobably involves both humoral and cell-mediated immune\nEnhanced cytokine-mediated recruitment and trafficking of\nautoreactive leucocytes across the BNB (blood\u00adnerve barrier)\nis an established early pathological hallmark of GBS (Hartung\nimental autoimmune neuritis), a well-characterized animal\nmodel that shares many pathological characteristics with\nK.A. Langert and others\nCirculating autoreactive leucocytes may initially home to\nperipheral nerves by a mechanism that involves enhanced\nlocal gradients of chemokine expression (Zou et al., 1999;\nKieseier et al., 2000). At these sites, proinflammatory cy-\ntokines, in particular TNF (tumour necrosis factor ), play\na pivotal role in the pathogenesis of both GBS and EAN,\nas recently reviewed by Lu and Zhu (Lu and Zhu, 2011). An\nincreased presence of TNF has been detected within af-\nfected peripheral nerves of GBS patients (Putzu et al., 2000).\nOthers have demonstrated a strong correlation between el-\nevated plasma concentrations of TNF and clinical sever-\nity of GBS (Exley et al., 1994). Similarly, previous studies\nhave demonstrated an enhanced presence of TNF express-\ning macrophage infiltrates within nerve roots from rats with\nEAN (Stoll et al., 1993). Therapeutically, neutralizing TNF\nor its homotrimeric cell surface receptor TNFR1 has been\ndemonstrated to ameliorate the course of EAN (Stoll et al.,\nmice exhibit an attenuated course of EAN (Mao et al., 2010).\nChemotactic cytokines and immunoglobulin-like CAMs\n(cell adhesion molecules) are inflammatory mediators\nthat are highly involved in leucocyte trafficking and\ntransendothelial migration. In patients with GBS, dis-\nease severity correlates with enhanced expression of CCL2\n(chemokine ligand 2) in CSF (cerebrospinal fluid), as well\nas by epineurial and endoneurial vascular endothelial cells\nenhancement of CCL2 expression is reported to preclude the\nonset of clinical deficits (Fujioka et al., 1999; Kieseier et al.,\n2000). Antibody-mediated neutralization of CCL2 in vivo\nameliorates the course of EAN in rats (Zou et al., 1999).\nBy comparison, expression of ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion\nmolecule 1), a CAM involved in the firm adhesion stage of\nleucocyte migration, is elevated in the CSF and by sural nerve\nendothelial cells in patients at the peak of GBS (Putzu et al.,\ncreases in ICAM-1 mRNA and protein were detected in cauda\nequina harvested from Lewis rats with EAN (Stoll et al., 1993;\nTran et al., 2010), and antibody-mediated neutralization of\nICAM-1 attenuates the course of EAN (Archelos et al., 1993).\nThe mechanism by which inflammatory mediators con-\ntribute to peripheral nerve injury in GBS remains unclear.\nGiven that (i) there are clear phenotypic and functional dif-\nferences between vascular endothelium from different tis-\nsues (Yosef et al., 2010) and that (ii) recruitment and traf-\nficking of leucocytes across the activated vascular endothelial\nbarriers is most probably governed by changes in the expres-\nsion of specific inflammatory mediators unique to the local-\nand Dorovini-Zis, 2010), we chose in this study to focus on\nTNF-mediated activation of MECs (microvascular endothe-\nlial cells) harvested from the rat peripheral nerve. Although\nadvancements have been made towards the purification and\nculture of MECs derived from peripheral nerve (Argall et al.,\nhave addressed how PNMEC (peripheral nerve microvascular\nendothelial cell) cultures respond to a localized inflammatory\nchallenge such as that experienced during AIDP/EAN. To ad-\ndress this concern, we harvested PNMECs from sciatic nerves\nof na\u00a8\nive Lewis rats and immortalized them by SV40 (simian\nvirus 40) large T antigen transduction.\nHere, we report the stable immortalization of rat PN-\nMEC cultures and demonstrate their retention of key pheno-\ntypic, morphologic and biochemical characteristics expected\nof MECs from the endoneurium of rat peripheral nerve. Acti-\nvation of primary or immortalized PNMEC cultures with TNF\nelicited marked dose- and time-dependent changes in CCL2\nand ICAM-1 expression and CCL2 release. Enhanced TNF-\nmediated CCL2 secretion also facilitated chemotaxis of CCR2-\nexpressing human THP-1 monocytes in an in vitro migration\nassay. We argue that increased CCL2 and ICAM-1 expression\nin response to TNF may facilitate recruitment and traffick-\ning of autoreactive leucocytes across the BNB in autoimmune\ndisorders, including GBS. Collectively, these findings support\nthe application of PNMEC cultures as a novel in vitro resource\nfor the functional assessment of pathological alterations in\nendoneurial homoeostasis during an inflammatory challenge,\nsuch as that encountered during GBS/EAN.\nPNMEC\nThis study was conducted using protocols approved by the\nEdward Hines Jr. VA Hospital Institutional Animal Care and\nUse Committee in accordance with the principles of labo-\nratory animal care. Primary cultures of MECs were prepared\nfrom sciatic nerves of na\u00a8\nive Lewis rats as described previously\nsciatic nerves were desheathed to remove the epineurium,\nperineurium and macrovascular endothelium.

SV40 large T antigen transduction of rat primary\nPNMECs was found to yield stable immortalized clones that\nuniquely retain these phenotypic and morphologic charac-\nteristics of primary MECs (Figures 1B, 1D and 1F). Expression\nof large T antigen was specific to immortalized clones, as pri-\nmary PNMEC cultures did not express measurable quantities\nof this protein (Figure 1G).\nTo confirm barrier formation and function in PNMEC cul-\ntures, we measured TEER and determined expression of tight\njunction-associated molecules. Twenty-four hours after pas-\nsaging immortalized cells onto collagen-coated Transwell in-\nserts, TEER values did not significantly differ from negative\ncontrol (insert only) (Figure 2A). However, 48\u00ad72 h after pas-\nsaging, an increase (15 cm2) in TEER values was observed\nacross monolayers of immortalized PNMEC cultures (Fig-\nure 2A), in good agreement with previously reported TEER\nvalues of endothelial cells that form the highly restrictive\nblood\u00adbrain barrier (Davidson et al., 2009).\nBoth primary and immortalized PNMECs express measur-\nable levels of tight junction associated molecules including\nclaudin-5, occludin, JAM1 (junctional adhesional molecule 1)\nand ZO-1 (zona occludens 1), as qualitatively demonstrated\nby RT-PCR (Figure 2B).

In primary PNMEC\ncultures, TNF (10 ng/ml, 3 h) elicited a marked (>12-fold)\nincrease in the content of CCL2 mRNA compared with quies-\ncent (media-treated) cells (Figure 3A). Immortalized PNMEC\ncultures responded similarly to TNF stimulation, with both\na dose- (Figure 3B) and time- (Figure 3C) dependent increase\n(>75-fold) in CCL2 mRNA content. In contrast, the content\nof CCL2 mRNA in quiescent (media-treated) immortalized\nPNMEC cultures was below the level of detection (Figure 3C).\nTreating primary PNMEC cultures with TNF (10 ng/ml,\n4 h) increased, by approximately 50%, the content of in-\ntracellular CCL2 protein as measured by cell-based ELISA\n(Figure 4A). Consistent with this observation was a robust\nTNF (10 ng/ml, 4 h)-mediated increase of a 30 kDa protein\nidentified by immunoblot as CCL2 in lysates of treated im-\nmortalized PNMEC cultures (Figure 4B).

TNF (10 ng/ml, 3 h) elicited in primary PNMEC cul-\ntures a modest but significant (>2-fold) increase in ICAM-1\nmRNA content (Figure 5A). Immortalized PNMEC cultures\nsimilarly responded to TNF treatment by up-regulating\nICAM-1 mRNA content nearly 10-fold in a manner that\nwas both dose- and time-dependent (Figures 5B and 5C). By\ncomparison, constitutive ICAM-1 mRNA expression was un-\nchanged in quiescent (media-treated) PNMEC cultures over\nthe course of the 6 h assay (Figure 5C).\nConstitutive expression of ICAM-1 protein in quiescent\nprimary or immortalized PNMEC cultures was below the level\nof detection (Figure 6). Primary PNMEC cultures treated with\nTNF, however, exhibited a 50% increase in ICAM-1 pro-\ntein content as quantified by cell-based ELISA (Figure 6A).\nLysates of TNF-treated immortalized PNMEC cultures con-\ntained a marked increase in a 90 kDa protein identified by\nimmunoblot as ICAM-1 (Figure 6B). TNF elicited increases in\nICAM-1 protein content within immortalized PNMEC cultures\nwere dose- (Figure 6C) and time- (Figure 6D) dependent. By\ncomparison, constitutive ICAM-1 protein expression was un-\nchanged in quiescent (media-treated) PNMEC cultures over\nthe course of 24 h assayed (Figure 6D).\nTNF promotes CCL2-mediated chemotaxis\nIn addition to inducing quantifiable increases in CCL2 mRNA\nand protein expression, TNF significantly enhanced the re-\nlease of CCL2 protein into the culture media from primary\nand immortalized PNMEC cultures (Figure 7). The absolute\ncontent of CCL2 protein constitutively secreted from quies-\ncent (media-treated) PNMEC cultures was within detectable\nlimits (10\u00ad50 ng/ml), and was significantly enhanced by TNF\ntreatment (Figures 7A and 7B). TNF (10 ng/ml, 4 h) enhanced\nCCL2 secretion >4-fold from primary PNMEC cultures (Fig-\nure 7A). By comparison, TNF treatment elicited a dose- (Fig-\nure 7B) and time- (Figure 7C) dependent effect on CCL2\nrelease from immortalized PNMEC cultures.\nThe functional consequence of TNF-mediated enhance-\nment of CCL2 secretion was determined in vitro using CCR2-\nexpressing human THP-1 monocytes (Figure 8). Human CCR2\nFigure 5 TNF increases ICAM-1 mRNA content in primary or\nimmortalized PNMEC cultures\n(A) Primary PNMEC cultures were incubated in the absence (media) or pres-\nence of TNF (10 ng/ml) for 3 h.

Im-\nmortalized PNMEC cultures are shown to retain key pheno-\ntypic, morphologic and biochemical properties highly char-\nacteristic of primary microvascular endoneurial endothelial\ncells. In addition to exhibiting contact-inhibited monolay-\ners with a cobblestone-like morphology and marked expres-\nsion of endothelial cell and barrier markers, immortalized\nPNMEC cultures responded robustly to a proinflammatory\ncytokine (TNF) challenge by increasing the expression of\ninflammatory mediators CCL2 and ICAM-1. The functional\nconsequence of a TNF challenge on localized up-regulation\nof inflammatory mediators is underscored by a marked in-\ncrease in release of CCL2 from the activated peripheral nerve\nmicrovascular endothelium. Here, we propose that increased\nCCL2 and ICAM-1 expression in response to TNF may facil-\nitate recruitment and trafficking of autoreactive leucocytes\nacross the BNB in autoimmune disorders, including GBS.\nAdvancements have been made towards the purification\nand culture of MECs derived from peripheral nerve (Argall\nendothelial cell characteristics vary according to tissue ori-\nknowledge, no studies to date have addressed how PNMECs\nrespond to a localized inflammatory challenge such as that\nexperienced during GBS/EAN. In this study, viable cultures of\nprimary microvascular endoneurial endothelial cells from rat\nsciatic nerve were routinely prepared at >95% purity. We\nused a replication-deficient SV40 retrovirus encoding a tem-\nperature sensitive non-SV40-origin binding mutant of the\nwood et al., 1996) to produce from these primary PNMEC cul-\ntures a stably immortalized clone. Immortalized PNMECs were\nfound to retain key phenotypic (contact-inhibited monolay-\ners), morphologic (distinctive cobblestone-like appearance),\nbiochemical (localized expression of vascular endothelial cell\nmarkers vWF/Factor VIII and PECAM-1) and barrier-related\n(expression of tight junction associated molecules) charac-\nteristics exhibited by primary rat PNMEC cultures. Immor-\ntalized PNMEC monolayers also exhibited increased TEER, an\nestablished measure of barrier function.\nRecruitment and extravasation of autoreactive leuco-\ncytes into privileged tissue compartments, such as peripheral\nnerves, is thought to initially involve establishment of local-\nized chemotactic cytokine gradients, including CCL2 (Yadav\net al., 2010). Consistent with this thesis, we observed a rapid\nand marked increase in CCL2 mRNA and protein expression in\n8 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nTNF enhances CCL2 and ICAM-1 in PNMEC cultures\nPNMEC cultures responding to a TNF challenge. The phys-\niological concentration of TNF in plasma of patients with\nRadhakrishnan et al., 2004). At this low concentration, TNF\nelicited measurable increases in CCL2 mRNA content in im-\nmortalized PNMEC cultures. Higher concentrations of TNF\n(10\u00ad100 fold) were found to elicit measurable changes in\nboth CCL2 mRNA and protein expression within PNMECs. Lo-\ncalized concentrations of TNF within peripheral nerves dur-\ning an immune challenge remain to be determined, and may\nvery well mimic or exceed concentrations used in this study.\nIn vascular endothelial cells, chemokines (including CCL2)\nare reportedly stored in novel regulated secretory granules\nthat are distinct from vWF-containing Weibel-Palade bod-\nies (Knipe et al., 2010). Exposure of endothelial cells to an\ninflammatory mediator elicits rapid translocation to the cell\nsurface of stored vesicles where they release their chemo-\ntactic contents into the extracellular space (Oynebraten\n2010). Consistent with these observations, primary and\nimmortalized PNMEC cultures used in this study simi-\nlarly responded to a TNF challenge by releasing into\nthe culture medium measurable quantities of functionally\nactive CCL2 protein. Antibody-mediated neutralization of\nreleased CCL2 protein attenuated migration of CCR2-\nexpressing human THP-1 monocytes in an in vitro migration\nassay. A modest, although statistically insignificant, increase\nin migrated monocytes over baseline was observed with an-\ntibody neutralization. This discrepancy may be attributed to\nthe presence of other C\u00adC chemokines [MIP-1 (macrophage\ninflammatory protein 1) and RANTES (regulated upon\nactivation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted)] in the\nTNF-conditioned media.\nResponding leucocytes migrate through the endothelium\ninto peripheral nerves, in part, by a process that first in-\nvolves their engagement of temporally expressed endothe-\nlial CAMs precipitating tethering, slow rolling, firm adhesion\nCytokine-mediated activation of the endothelium facilitates\nmigration of autoreactive leucocytes into peripheral nerves in\nEAN (Stoll et al., 1993). Given that ICAM-1 is directly involved\nin leucocyte trafficking (Greenwood et al., 2002), we deter-\nmined the effects of a TNF challenge on eliciting changes in\nICAM-1 expression. Previous studies have reported constitu-\ntive ICAM-1 expression in vascular endothelial cells (Rahman\nand Fazal, 2009). However, endogenous expression of ICAM-\n1 by primary and immortalized rat PNMEC cultures was be-\nlow the level of detection. Challenging immortalized PNMEC\ncultures with TNF induced a dose- and time-dependent in-\ncrease in ICAM-1 mRNA and protein expression, rendering\nthese cells capable of firm adhesion with autoreactive leuco-\ncytes. Importantly, the effect of TNF on ICAM-1 expression\nwas similarly observed in primary PNMEC cultures, in strong\nsupport of a physiological response rather than an artefact of\ncell transformation. Compared with expression of CCL2, the\ntime course by which TNF elicited an increase in ICAM-1\nFigure 7 TNF promotes secretion of CCL2 from primary and\nimmortalized PNMEC cultures\n(A) Content of CCL2 secreted from primary PNMEC cultures incubated in the\nabsence (media) or presence of TNF (10 ng/ml) for 4 h.

While these various mechanisms have not yet\nbeen elucidated in these PNMEC cultures, the observed rapid\nincrease in CCL2 protein release from TNF-challenged PN-\nMEC cultures suggests, to us, that exocytosis of CCL2 is not\nimpaired in these cells. Additional studies are currently being\nconducted to determine the mechanism by which TNF elicits\nchanges in CCL2 and ICAM-1 gene and protein expression.\nIn conclusion, we report the stable immortalization of rat\nPNMECs, which retain key phenotypic, morphological, bio-\nchemical characteristics and barrier-forming properties ex-\npected of primary microvascular endoneurial endothelium.\nWe demonstrate that TNF elicits robust increases in CCL2\nand ICAM-1 mRNA and protein content, while significantly\npromoting CCL2 release, in both primary and immortalized\nPNMEC cultures. TNF-mediated enhancement of CCL2 se-\ncretion facilitated migration of human THP-1 monocytes\nin vitro. TNF facilitated alterations in other inflammatory\nmediators in PNMEC cultures are anticipated and remain to\nbe established. Increased TEER, coupled with the expression of\ntight junction associated molecules, represent unique char-\nacteristics of specialized barrier-forming endothelial cells.\nCollectively, these findings support the application of PN-\nMEC cultures as a novel in vitro resource for the functional\nassessment of pathological alterations in endoneurial ho-\nmoeostasis during an inflammatory challenge, such as that\nencountered during GBS/EAN.\nFUNDING\nThis work was supported, in part, by the Department of Vet-\na Pre-Doctoral Associated Health Rehabilitation Research\nFellowship (to K.A.L.) and the National Institutes of Health\nREFERENCES\nArchelos JJ, Maurer M, Jung S, Toyka KV, Hartung HP (1993) Suppression of\nexperimental allergic neuritis by an antibody to the intracellular adhesion\nArgall KG, Armati PJ, Pollard JD (1994) A method for the isolation and culture\nof rat peripheral nerve vascular endothelial cells.
