In planning and management policy, the term\nwicked problem is used to refer to adverse social and envi-\nronmental situations that overwhelm existing practices and\npersist even after the application of best-known practices\nThe concept is applied in organizational decision making as\na \"force of fragmentation\" whereby stakeholders polarize\naround their views of a problem, thereby undermining col-\nlaborative problem solving (Conklin, 2001). From an inter-\nventionist perspective, \"a do-nothing\" approach is perhaps a\nreasonable option for a problem that defies best intervention\npractices. However, Brown, Harris, and Russell (2010)\npointed out that wicked problems will not be solved by the\nsame tools and processes that have created them. This sug-\ngests that action is incumbent, but action must implore\nmechanisms and paths different from those that have per-\npetuated the problem in the first place.\nIn Ghana, climate change is an emerging issue in the\nnational discourse. Already it is known to present challenges\nto current development efforts and environmental manage-\nment capacities. This article examines the nature of climate\nchange as a wicked problem in water resource management\nin Ghana, and how social and institutional capacities influ-\nence an understanding of climate change and efforts to\naddress the dilemma. Using rural water management as a\nreference point, this article argues that climate change as a\nwicked problem in Ghana can be demonstrated in two ways:\n(a) its sheer physical consequences on water resources and\n(b) weaknesses in institutional capacity to adapt. But, instead\nof a fatalist approach, appropriate social and ecological insti-\ntutional capacities can be developed for effective adaptation.\nWe propose adaptive co-management (ACM) as a useful\ninstitutional approach.\nComplexity,Wicked Problems,\nand Climate Change\nComplexity implies degree of difficulty in defining causal\nlinkages of an event as well as determining the boundaries\nof their effects to allow for management of them with any\nmeaningful degree of accuracy and confidence.

Mensah1\n Keywords\nclimate change, wicked problems, institutions, rural water management,Adaptive Co-Management\n2 SAGE Open\nand disagreement continuum is considered complex because\nit challenges existing capacities to predict outcomes and\nsolutions, and therefore heightens disagreement resulting in\nstakeholder conflicts. Complexity can be judged by source\nand nature. When a problem is generated by multiple factors\nfrom multiple sources, it is difficult to target the linkages of\nthe causal factors and therefore raises questions of complex-\nity to the extent that identification of the problem, and hence\nits solution, becomes difficult. Complexity can also be of a\ntechnical and social nature. The technical side relates to\nlimitations of quality of information and deficiency in exist-\ning knowledge systems that make diagnosis of a particular\nsituation problematic because of high degree of uncertainties\nin the solutions offered. The social aspect focuses on inher-\nent difficulties in coordination of activities, information, and\nstakeholders across disciplines, sectors, and scales in a man-\nner that minimizes conflicts and builds consensus around\nsolutions for a situation (Patton, 2011).\nThe term wicked problems was originally coined by Rittel\nand Weber (1973) as the opposite of \"tame problems,\" where\nthe latter can be resolved with traditional methods because it is\neasy to define cause-and-effect relationship of the problem as\nwell as the solutions. Conversely, wicked problems are social\nplanning problems that defy traditional methods because they\nare \"ill-defined, ambiguous and associated with strong moral,\nThey are complex, with linkages to other issues evolving in a\ndynamic social context, and tackling one often leads to unin-\ntended consequences of generating new sets of wicked prob-\nlems. They are strongly stakeholder dependent, often with\nlittle consensus about what the problem is, let alone how to\nThus, complexity and wicked problems are interconnected.\nWicked problems are inherently complex in their scale of\nuncertainty and disagreement, as well as in their technical and\nsocial nature; therefore, they are best tackled by interdisciplin-\nary approaches, coexistence of different knowledge systems,\nflexible governance, and participatory processes and practices\nthat allow for adaptive learning and ethics.\nThe concept of wicked problems has been applied in\ncomplex and adaptive systems thinking to draw linkages\nwithin social and ecological systems (SES). SES are dif-\nficult to manage both at the technical and social levels\nbecause often they involve multiple sources, multiple\nactors, and their externalities jump scales for which cross-\nscale institutions are required. According to Walker et al.\nA fundamental difficulty in managing SES for long\nterm, sustainable outcomes is that their great complex-\nity makes it difficult to forecast the future in any\nmeaningful way. Not only are forecasts uncertain, the\nusual statistical approaches will likely underestimate\nthe uncertainties. That is, even the uncertainties are\nuncertain. (p. 2)\nContributing factors to uncertainty include dynamism of\nthe drivers of change such as human behavior, ecological fac-\ntors, and scale of interaction of the processes (Dolsak et al.,\nparticularly informative for climate change adaptation because\nit denotes transition of a system where internal and external\nvariables create constant changes in the social or ecological\ndomains, and a change in the critical variables of one domain\nrequires institutional adjustments in the other to prevent col-\nlapse of the entire system (Gunderson & Holling, 2002).\nIt is within this context that the interconnections among\ncomplexity, wicked problems, and climate change can be viv-\nidly drawn, in that climate change adaptation requires restruc-\nturing social and ecological institutions to adjust to rapid and\nuncertain change as well as to take advantage of the opportuni-\nties presented by such changes (Brown et al., 2010). For\ninstance, Ludwig (2001) following Rittel and Weber's defini-\ntion described climate change as one example of wicked prob-\nlems noting, \"Such problems have no definitive formulation, no\nstopping rule, and no test for a solution. There will likely never\nbeafinalresolutionofanyofthem.Eachsuchproblemisunique:\nThey defy classification\" (p. 3). The author identified terminolo-\ngies used to describe wicked problems in the ecological litera-\nture including truly complex, complex all the way down, and\npostnormal, characterized by radical uncertainty and plurality\nof legitimate perspectives. Thus, climate change is intractable,\nand adaptation solutions are elusive, making climate change a\nperfect fit for the complexity and wicked problems model.\nIndeed, current global discourses suggest that no single\nphenomenon exhibits the characteristics of wicked problems\nlike climate change. It attracts varying interests and perspec-\ntives constantly juggling for recognition and acceptance. For\ninstance, the Australian Public Service Commission on\nClimate Change demonstrates two perspectives. First are cli-\nmate change believers, but acknowledge global structural\ninequalities among nations and refer rich nations to the Kyoto\nProtocol to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions. Kyoto\nurges that remedying climate change would require all gov-\nernments to formally agree on future emissions cuts and the\nmechanisms to achieve the set targets. The onus is on devel-\noped countries to mitigate their emissions and also provide\ndeveloping countries with financial and technological assis-\nUnited Nation Framework Conventions on Climate Change\n[UNFCCC], 1998). This position is frequently contested\namong UNFCCC parties. The second is the skeptical per-\nspective that questions the authenticity of climate change as a\nhuman-induced problem. They argue that in a worse-case sce-\nnario, the catastrophic consequences of climate change will be\nmoderated by technology and market forces. This could lose\ntraction as skepticism about climate change wanes. A third\nview may be added, focusing on governance reforms with\nemphasis on participation, ethics, and justice with decision\nmaking devolved to local levels where citizens'involvement\nFitzGibbon and Mensah 3\nThese divergent views demonstrate a high degree of dis-\nagreement on the fundamental causes of and solutions for\nclimate change, as well as a high degree of uncertainty about\nour understanding of all the variables involved in climate\nchange processes. In addition, it points to the deficiency in\nour technical and social capabilities to be able to deal with a\nphenomenon with multiple sources, actors, stakeholders,\ncross-scale influences (externalities), and linkages (Australian\nPublic Service Commission, 2007). This leaves the policy\nmaker with a dynamic, plural, and argumentative system of\npolicy definition--typical of many wicked policy problems--\nand also leaves the policy maker with a problem in which\ncomplexity outweighs the capabilities of his or her current\nrepertoire of methodologies (Australian Public Service\n\"the problem of climate change is intractable by our tradi-\nThe futility of relying on those same tools and practices that\nhave augmented the creation of the climate change problem is\nCurrent adaptation frameworks are not sophisticated\nenough to sufficiently integrate the biophysical and the\nsociopolitical issues across multiple scales (Brown et al.,\n2010; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC],\n2007; United Nations Framework Conventions on Climate\nChange [UNFCCC], 2006). Yet, consensus coalesce around\nthe notion that effective and practical adaptive management\nof climate change depends on understanding the scale of\ninfluences of the drivers of change (general and systemic,\nslow and fast) at work in the system (Pahl-Wostl, 2007;\nAt least, it is clear that some of the driving forces oper-\nate at a global scale while many of the phenomena that\nunderlie environmental processes operate at a local\nscale. Understanding climate change processes and\nresponses require attention to multiple scales and how\nthey relate to one another. (p. 602)\nThe Australian Public Service Commission is apt in its\nobservation that the practical challenges facing our capabilities\nto address climate change are often philosophical (ideological)\nand methodological, particularly as they relate to cross-scale\nlinkages, trust and social capital formation among institutions,\ngovernance reforms that encourage participation, equity and\nglobal justice, and creating spaces for social learning in an adap-\ntive manner. In addition, there is consensus that effects of cli-\nmate change are so advanced that mitigation alone is too late to\nmakeanymeaningfulreversalstothedamagealreadyinmotion,\nhence the focus on adaptation (Lambrou & Piana, 2006).\nMethod\nOur approach is diagnostic and prescriptive with a qualita-\ntive analytical slant. We used primary and secondary data\nsources. Primary data came from interviews with 18 key\ninformants from government, research, and civil society\norganizations whose work intersects with water resource\nmanagement and environmental protection. Participants\nresponded to questions focused on the challenges of cli-\nmate change in the water sector and the capacities of water\ninstitutions to adapt. Responses were then triangulated\nwith secondary sources including published government,\nresearch, and newspaper reports for reliability and validity.\nFor analysis, we examined the extent to which the data\nmatched up to Rittel and Webber's (1973) construct of\nwicked problems. Based on the findings, we suggest a\nmethod with a greater capacity to handle complexity (i.e.,\nclimate change).\nClimate ChangeTrends in Africa\nIn a certain ironic fashion, Africa, the smallest contributor to\ngreenhouse gas emissions, is expected to be one of the most\nvulnerable to the impacts of climate change (Ayers &\n2006). Projections of multiple stresses, such as increasing\nseverity and frequency in water shortages, declining agricul-\ntural productivity, desert and coastal encroachments, as well\nas low adaptive capacity, raise concerns of security, liveli-\nhoods, mass ecomigration, and development on the continent\nAfricans would be exposed to increased water stress, lacking\naccess to portable water or adequate sanitation because of\nclimate change, resulting also in 50% reduction in rain-fed\nagricultural yields (IPCC, 2007). This is against the backdrop\npromise of universal access to safe and reliable water supply\nIt is believed that climate change has affected rainfall\nregimes resulting in the commonly observed frequency and\nseverity of floods and drought on the continent (IPCC, 2001;\nLeroux, 2001). In Africa, coastal area sea-level rise is\nexpected to result in annual flooding and salinization of water\nsources, which will severely affect millions of people in low-\nlying areas (Bunce, Rosendo, & Brown, 2010; McGranahan,\nBalk, & Anderson, 2007). The cost of adaptation could\nhindrance to the realization of key millennium development\ngoals such as poverty reduction and ensuring environmental\nwater security among key potential impacts of climate\nchange in Africa, as well as concerns of low adaptive capac-\nity on the continent. Africa's low adaptive capacity revolves\naround its capital base required for capacity building and\nsustainable development policy because vulnerability to cli-\nmate change depends on development indicators (Ayers &\n4 SAGE Open\nClimate Change as a Wicked\nProblem in Water Management in\nGhana\nGhana is noted to share some notable developmental chal-\nlenges with other African countries such as reliance on rain-\nfed agriculture, vulnerability to drought and floods, poor\ngovernance, and rapid population growth, which put undue\npressure on the capacity of government to provide basic infra-\nstructural services (Brown & Crawford, 2008). Climate change\nand variability complicate these issues and undermine overall\ndevelopment efforts in Ghana. As a wicked problem in the\ncountry's water sector, climate change manifests in two dimen-\nsions: first, the physical consequences of climate change on\necological resources (including water); second, climate\nchange confronts existing water institutional arrangements\nwith a dilemma exposing weaknesses in their capacity to\ntackle complexities associated with water management.\nPhysical Consequences\nGhana is among countries where climate change is projected\nto create water stress by 2025. As far as water resources\nmanagement and use are concerned, three climate change\u00ad\nrelated issues are relevant: extreme events brought about by\nchanges in rainfall and temperature regimes, variability, and\nsea-level rise. As Table 1 shows, these climate change\nissues, in turn, have negative repercussions on (a) the avail-\nability and quality of freshwater resources as hitherto peren-\nnial water sources dry up because of severe droughts and\npollutions of water bodies due to increased floods and salt\nintrusion; (b) security of human lives, property, and water\ninfrastructure as increased droughts, floods, and storm surges\ndestroy property, water supply, and hydro-generation infra-\nstructure, which result in the displacement of thousands,\ndeaths, service disruption, and social upheavals; (c) poor\nhealth conditions and increased risk of contracting water-\nrelated diseases; and (d) reproduction of gender inequalities\nas women's reproductive work and time allocated to com-\nplete the tasks increase during changing climatic conditions.\nRainfall-temperature regimes. Historical records across\nGhana suggest discernible future temperature increases and\nrainfall declines. Temperature is estimated to rise on aver-\n2080, respectively. Rainfall is also predicted to decrease on\n2080, respectively, in all agroecological zones. Upper sec-\ntions of the Volta region and three northern regions suffer\ndrought once in every 3-year cycle (Arku, 1993). Climate\nchange remains an issue for the whole country, but climate\nvariability is a major challenge, especially for rural com-\nmunities that depend on natural resources and environmen-\ntal services (van der Geest, 2004). For rural residents\nwithout piped water, irregularity and extremes in weather\npatterns (droughts and floods) directly affect water\navailability and access, placing additional stresses on their\ndaily activities. As Gyampoh, Idinoba, and Amisah (2008,\np. 10) observe, \"Whereas models and records of precipita-\ntion mainly focus on changing amounts of precipitation with\nclimate change, knowledge of indigenous people also\nemphasize changes in the regularity, length, intensity, and\ntiming of precipitation.\" Brown and Crawford (2008)\nobserve that climate variability in combination with popula-\ntion growth will compound the adverse effects of inadequate\nwater supply in the country, particularly in the dry North, and\ncould lead to a 12-fold increase in the demand for irrigation\nby 2050. The major dams that have been the mainstay of\nurban water supply fluctuate in similar fashion to rivers,\nponds, and creeks, which serve rural communities in corre-\nspondence to climate variability (Gyampoh et al., 2009).\nThe crisis could get worse, especially for rural water sys-\ntems, if effective adaptation mechanisms are not found soon\n(Environment Protection Agency [EPA], 2000; Ferguson &\nSea-level rise and coastal challenges. Climate change com-\npounds the adverse effects of inadequate water supply in\ninland communities. Yet, sea-level change from that in 1990\n(EPA, 2000). It will worsen salt water intrusion into estuaries\nand aquifers, raised coastal water tables, and exacerbate\ncoastal flooding and storm damage to coastal properties\nThis will put two thirds of lands and residents living within\nthe East Coast at risk. It will cost an estimated US$1.14 bil-\nlion to protect all shorelines at risk with populations greater\nprotect only the \"important areas\" (EPA, 2000).\nGender, water, and climate change adaptation. Women have\nlow adaptive capacities arising from ascribed social and eco-\nnomic inequities inherent in traditional and nontraditional\nstructures that manifest in distinct differences of unequal\naccess to property rights, information, education, unemploy-\nment, and resources between men and women (Mensah-\nKutin, 2008). Changing climatic conditions (e.g., droughts)\naggravate these gender relations by increasing women's\nreproductive work and time allocated to complete water-\nrelated tasks (Arku & Arku, 2010; Awumbila & Momsen,\n1995). The result is that in comparison with men, most\nwomen are less represented in productive activities, are\npoorer, and participate less in the governance of natural\nresources, including water (Gyimah & Thompson, 2008;\nMensah-Kutin, 2008). Thus, climate change will exacerbate\nthe woes of women and poor people because their liveli-\nhoods depend on natural resources and economic sectors that\nare susceptible to climate change. In this regard, Ghana's cli-\nmate change policy is criticized for taking a gender-neutral\nposition, thereby worsening the vulnerability of these groups\nTable 1.

However, the authors maintain that climate\nchange is just one of the interrelated development issues that\nGhana faces and that, except in extreme scenarios, the effects\nof climate change may only act as a catalyst to exacerbate a\nnumber of existing problems.

Furthermore, as far as water supply\nis concerned, there is little doubt that the impact of climate\nchange and variability is both a direct and determining factor\nin access to potable water. Therefore, social and institutional\nreforms are needed to address the recalcitrant and complex\nissues associated with climate change and related water\nproblems.\nSocial and Institutional Reforms in Ghana\nIt is axiomatic among risk management practitioners that\nresource availability and institutional capacities are key\ndeterminants of the ease with which climate change\u00adrelated\nrisks and vulnerabilities deteriorate into full-blown disaster.\nIn this regard, Ghana has undertaken several reform policies\nto build its social and institutional capacities, resulting in an\nelaborate political decentralization and water governance\nstructure (Figure 1). Since 1988, Ghana established political\nand administrative institutions at three levels: district, subdis-\ntrict, and community. In addition, it has privatized its water\nsector and established management, facilitation, and regula-\ntion agencies such as the Water Resources Commission\n(WRC), Community Water and Sanitation Agency (CWSA),\nGhana Water Company, among other stakeholder agencies. In\nparticular, CWSA was established in 1998 with the mandate to\nfacilitate water and sanitation facilities delivery and hygiene\neducation to rural communities (Odame-Ababio, 2003).\nCWSA fosters partnerships with foreign and local public,\nprivate, and civil society organizations to streamline their\nactivities in the rural water sector. Current rural water supply\ncoverage by CWSA stands at 63%. The activities of CWSA\nare supposed to end at the regional level. Responsibility for\nwater supply and capacity building at the district level rests\nwith the District Assembly, which must liaise with subdistrict\nentities such as Unit Committees, local water and sanitation\nteams, and related stakeholders. Thus, Ghana's water sector,\nespecially rural water supply, demonstrates a mosaic of inter-\nlinked institutions from international through local-level\ninterspersed with private, nongovernmental organizations\n(NGOs), and civil organizations (Mensah, 1998; Schiffer,\nMcCarthy, Birner, Waale, & Asante, 2008).\nOn climate change, Ghana is active at the international\nlevel as a party to the UNFCCC and signatory to the Kyoto\nProtocol. Internally, mainstreaming climate change into exist-\ning decentralized system and development policies, such as\nthe Ghana Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy and mil-\nlennium development goals, are seen as the surest way to\neffectively cope (United Nations Development Programme,\nthe mandate for environmental sustainability is acknowl-\nedged as a notable climate change effort. Other responsibili-\nties of EPA include research and development, rule making,\nstandard settings, and enforcement. In addition, it collabo-\nrates with other stakeholders to ensure sustainable water\nDespite all these initiatives, climate change represents a\nperplexing phenomenon for Ghana's water management\ninstitutions. First, climate change is a relatively new area in\nthe national discourse and policy making, which suggests that\nthe institutional memory, knowledge base, and institutional\ncollaboration required for effective adaptation actions are\nnot only underdeveloped but also not fully understood. In\naddition, climate change was originally not envisaged in the\nmandates of major water institutions such as the WRC and\nCWSA. As such the CWSA has continued to carry out its\nactivities without recourse to climate change, whereas the\nWRC is only recently making strides with the Climate\nChange Adaptation Project to make the connections between\nwater resources management and climate change (WRC,\n2010). In addition, the nature and scale of the major causes,\nimportant stakeholders, and regimes in climate change reso-\nlutions operate beyond the national scale, thereby limiting\nthe ability of national institutional actors to adapt. Finally,\nlinkages between some national institutions, such as CWSA\nand EPA, and international donors and NGOs provide oppor-\ntunities to access valuable resources to undertake water and/\nor adaptation projects. However, overdependence on foreign\ndonors to undertake such a crucial national project raises\nquestions of sustainability and security in the water sector.\nFor instance, more than 70% of CWSA operating budget\ncomes from foreign donors.\nTable 2 provides a comparative analysis of Ritter and\nWeber's (1973) characteristics of wicked problems and the\nextent of their manifestation in climate change vis-\u00e0-vis\nwater management in Ghana. It explicates the complex rela-\ntionship between climate change and water resource man-\nagement in Ghana because of multiplicity of causal factors,\nactors and views involved, as well as scale concerns.\nInstitutional reforms (i.e., decentralization and water gover-\nnance) have the potential to improve our understanding of\nthe relationships between water supply and impacts of cli-\nmate change. However, the current practices exhibit low\nadaptive capacities, which result from weak collaborative\nlinkages among institutions, and do not foster the requisite\nlearning to enable rural communities to effectively respond\nand adapt their water resources to climate change (Mensah,\n2012). Ghana, therefore, needs an approach that can reason-\nably respond to climate change and related complexities in\nwater management.\nResponding to Complexity\nand Uncertainty,That Is,\nWicked Problems\nStacy (1996) provided a useful model for responding to\ncomplexity, that is, wicked problems (Figure 2). The zone of\ncomplexity is between the region of chaos (Zone 4) and the\nregions amenable to traditional management approaches\n(Zones 1, 2, and 3). The complexity zone requires ingenuity\n8 SAGE Open\nTable 2.

It is doubtful whether Ghana can\nself-generate satisfactory criteria and be able to sustain its adaptive capacities\nover a long uncertain period especially beyond the cycle of donor funding\niii.\nDire implications for rural communities because their adaptation capacity is\nthreatened by a combination of poverty, disregard for traditional norms, poor\neducation and knowledge flow, and dependence on charity, mainly NGOs\nSolutions to wicked problems are not\ntrue or false but good or bad\nAlthough the EPA,WRC, CWSA, among other public agencies, are mandated by\nlaw, their ability to determine the correctness of any water adaptation decision to\nimplement against CC rarely gets past critical scrutiny or challenge by numerous\nstakeholder agencies such as NGOs involved in the environment and water sector\nThere is no immediate and no\nultimate test of a solution to a\nwicked problem\nBecause the major drivers of CC operate at the global scale, it is impossible\nfor national and local actors to determine when desired results of a proposed\nintervention to adapt water systems to CC has been achieved, especially\ntaking into account the inability of any system to fully appraise all unintended\nconsequences prior to or post intervention\nEvery solution to a wicked problem\nis a \"one-shot operation\" because\nthere is no opportunity to learn by\ntrial and error; every attempt counts\nsignificantly\nCC-related droughts and floods create water shortages through drying up of local\nstreams and perennial rivers and disrupting water quality. Conventional solutions\nhave resorted to massive dam projects such as Akosombo, Kpong, Densu, and so\non. However, these projects have brought irreversible hardships to communities\nthat depend on these rivers for their livelihoods and water needs\nWicked problems do not have\nan enumerable (or exhaustively\ndescribable) set of potential\nsolutions, and there is no well-\ndescribed set of permissible\noperations that may be incorporated\ninto the plan\nCC\u00adrelated water supply resolutions are politically shaped by varying experiences,\nideologies, and power of stakeholders from international to local levels. Ghana\nhas no agreement criteria for judging successfully completed water adaptation\nprograms against CC; whether to base judgment on international agencies\nand government list of funded programs or on dominant agreement among all\nstakeholders is uncertain\nEvery wicked problem is essentially\nunique\nBy scale and intensity, CC is one of a kind, nothing close to known experiences\nof extreme environmental events (e.g., droughts or floods) related to water\nresources in Ghana.Therefore, it makes insufficient or inappropriate adaptive\ncapacities crafted out of knowledge gained from traditional and formal institutional\narrangements over the years because of the lack of understanding of the inherent\ncomplexities related to multiple causes and scale, and constant trajectory changes.\nThe situation is exacerbated by disjointed collaboration among stakeholder\ninstitutions\nEvery wicked problem can be\nconsidered to be a symptom of\nanother problem\nThe impacts of CC on water resources and supply reflect growing concerns about\ntheir interconnections with other intractable national and global problems, for\nexample, an unjust global geopolitics, deteriorating social and ecological systems,\npoverty, misfit/incapable institutions and resource governance system, gender\ninequalities, and so on.Therefore, exclusive action on CC without attention\nto related problems will be ineffective. But Ghana lacks the ability to influence\nglobal action in any significant way.As such it can only adopt an incremental\nstrategy within the country and regionally as in WRC's adopted comanagement of\ninternational rivers and major internal watersheds\n(continued)\nFitzGibbon and Mensah 9\nin innovation and a shift from past practices to create new\nmodes of operating because the predictive power of tradi-\ntional management approaches becomes ineffective here\n(Zimmerman, 2001). In elaborating on the model, the authors\nprovide a typology for responding to different levels of\ndilemma and complex scenarios, requiring changing\napproaches in moving from agreement and certainty. Within\nthis framework, specific tools or mechanisms can be applied\nto respond to complex issues, including Mess Mapping and\nResolution Mapping Processes (see Horn & Weber, 2007),\nACM. This article focuses on ACM, not on the other two.\nACM seeks to legitimize decision making in complex\nsituations through effective collaboration, flexible gover-\nnance, and continuous learning informed by experience.\nThree phases of Stacy\u00adZimmerman's model arranged back-\nward (Table 3) fits the ACM idea of water management\nunder complexity, although the first phase is a necessary\ncondition for responding to severe consequences on water\nresources under changing climatic conditions as the\nGhanaian scenario demonstrates. ACM may be useful for\nGhana because it is a dynamic approach imbued with com-\nplex and adaptive systems thinking with internal capacity to\nminimize ineffectiveness and inefficiencies in existing\nsocial and institutional models, while capitalizing on oppor-\ntunities of instrumental gains from prior existing institu-\ntions. Particularly, ACM will help strengthen the capacities\nof rural water management systems to adapt to climate\nchange because of its emphasis on equity and power bal-\nance through stakeholder deliberative processes, strength-\nening horizontal and cross-scale linkages, and creating\nspace for iterative learning and opportunities for coexis-\ntence and interaction among different knowledge systems,\nthereby giving legitimacy to decisions and actions.\nACM\nACM is a successor to earlier approaches (resilience, adap-\ntive, and later comanagement) that emphasized social and\necological dynamism, network governance, resilience, and\ncapacity building process through learning from experiences\nbackdrop of failures in community-based sustainable\nRittel and Weber CC and water supply in Ghana\nThe existence of a discrepancy\nrepresenting a wicked problem can\nbe explained in numerous ways.The\nchoice of explanation determines the\nnature of the problem's resolution\nNo meaningful locally designed water adaptation interventions against CC.\nAgencies such as EPA,WRC, and NGOs all seem to tailor their strategies toward\ninternationally driven initiatives such as MDGs and so on.This is justified as being\npart of the international community or determination to secure funding sources.\nTraditional authority and informal knowledge are often sidelined by experts from\nstate and formal agencies\nThe planner has no right to be\nwrong (Planners are liable for the\nconsequences of the actions they\ngenerate)\nThe precautionary principle is implied here, a key element of Ghana Water Policy.\nHowever, current Ghanaian practice places no liability on planners and policy\nmakers for unintended mistakes after due diligence, probably justifiably so because\nlearning from experience and even mistakes (adaptive) is fundamental to building\ncapacities against latent uncertainties of CC. Nonetheless, the principle compels\nplanners and implementers in CC and water resources to ponder their actions\ncarefully to minimize negative externalities of their actions on others\nNote: CC= climate change; NGO = nongovernmental organization; EPA = Environment Protection Agency;WRC =Water Resources Commission; CWSA =\nCommunity Water and Sanitation Agency.\nTable 2.

Consequently, it combines\niterative learning in adaptive management with the central\nelement of linkages in collaborative management where rights\nand responsibilities are jointly shared (Berkes, 2007; Dolsak\net al., 2003). Scalar issues are important to ACM as it draws\nthe linkages between stakeholder networks and access to\npolitical, technical, social, and economic resources (adaptive\ncapacities) of local communities and households. The local\nscale is viewed as the place where \"issues of management\nperformance are felt most directly\" but emphasize \"a flexible\nsystem for environment and resource management that oper-\nates across multiple levels and with a range of local and non-\nlocal organizations and actors\" (Armitage et al., 2007, p. 5).\nThere is no single all-encompassing definition of ACM.\nHowever, learning by doing, integrating multiple knowledge\nsystems, emphasizing flexibility of management structures,\nand advancing collaboration through power sharing at mul-\ntiple scales remain central (Plummer & FitzGibbon, 2007).\nClimate change adaptation involves SES and therefore\nfits the complexity or adaptive systems framework. The tran-\nsitional nature of global climate system implies that adaptation\nis not geared toward a predictable end state. Rather, it is about\na newly configured system, which is just one of potential mul-\ntiple end states (Gunderson & Holling, 2002; Walker et al.,\n2002). This suggests an element of path dependence or contin-\ngency in the possible outcomes of the adaptive approach. As\nsuch \"we must focus on learning to live within systems,\nrather than `controlling' them\" (Walker et al., 2002, p. 2).\nThis is the basis of Gunderson and Holling's (2002) \"panachy\"\nconcept (a hierarchy of nested adaptive cycles across time\nand space). It is also the basis of their indictment against\n\"development experts\": (a) ignorance of the key drivers of\nchange in a dynamic system, and the distinctly different scales\nof time and space they operate therefore exposing conventional\necological management practices to self-destructive-\ncontrolled ecological interventions along with the sociocul-\ntural structures that support it and (b) ignorance of the con-\nnectedness and linkages in ecology and society, as well as\nknowledge systems. Armitage et al. (2007) concluded,\nComplex systems thinking offers a way of examining,\ndescribing, interpreting, and cognitively structuring not\nonly ecological systems but also increasingly linked\nsocio-ecological systems. Specifically, complex systems\nthinking highlights the dynamic, nonlinear relationships\namong coupled social and ecological phenomena that\nresult in discontinuities, surprises, system flips, and the\npotential for multiple equilibrium states. (p. 7)\nWhat Should ACM for Ghana Look Like?\nThe underpinning tenets of ACM are informative for Ghana\nbecause climate change is a young and understudied sub-\nject in the country. Therefore, the full extent of intricate\ninterconnections of climate change with other sectors and\necological resources (including water), and associated\nTable 3.

The major task is to encourage\nformal research and traditional learning institutions to iden-\ntify emerging patterns and their levels of operation and a\ndisaggregated impact assessment on people (Table 3, Phase\n1). It is especially relevant for rural water supply because\nrural communities in Ghana lag behind in most capitals and\nhence their low adaptive capacities.\nA typical ACM for Ghana must specifically emphasize\ncontinuous learning in an iterative manner within networks\nand continuous information sharing and education as its over-\nriding objective for local management institutions (Pahl-\nclimate change will linger for a while. Therefore, institutional\nstrategies that have proved capable of coping with extreme\nclimatic events must be identified and incorporated into\nregional and national adaptation plans until more adaptable\nones are found. In addition, formal education must incorpo-\nrate lessons on mitigation and adaptation because today's stu-\ndents are future policy makers. Extension workers must be\ninformed and motivated to educate local people but must be\nwilling to be receptive to local wisdom and practices. Cultural\nand religious groups must be targeted for education because\npeople with formal education and nontraditional beliefs tend\nto flout traditional ecological norms that have been the main-\nstay of rural water management (Appiah-Opoku & Hyma,\nLocal communication systems (e.g., community radios) must\nuse local dialect to reach their communities to be abreast with\nnew and tested ideas as well as improve their technical capaci-\nties. In this regard, Ada Community Radio is worth mention-\ning in the way it interacts with and helps educate and mobilize\nlocal people about environment and climate change issues in\nThis approach has proved useful not only in bonding but also\nin bridging cross-scale linkages among nations (Pahl-Wostl,\n(CSOs), and international aid agencies must be given easy\naccess to institutional information and local communities to\nhelp in capacity building.\nIn addition, emphasis should be placed on institutional\nbricolage, with recognition of informal knowledge as a legit-\nimate source of information for climate and water manage-\nment issues because they have been useful for generations in\nhelping local communities adjust to environmental distur-\nbances. This will require codification of some sort to pre-\nserve them for future generations similar to the Peoples\nBiodiversity Register in India (Gadgil, Seshagiri Rao,\nUtkarsh, Pramod, & Chatre, 2000) or perhaps mainstream\nthem into national adaptation plans. For instance, Tengo and\nBelfrage (2004) found examples of how old practices served\nas a source of adaptation for dealing with new conditions,\nand that new knowledge was adjusted to local conditions in\nboth Sweden and Tanzania.\nWe must acknowledge the importance of ethics and\nsocial justice in environmental problems. They cannot\nbe resolved without the participation of those most\naffected. In fact, a satisfactory resolution may well\nhinge on special sorts of local knowledge and institu-\ntions that will only become available if local people are\nwelcomed as active and influential participants.\nPerhaps, if room is made for them at the table, a new\nscience that incorporates traditional knowledge and\nvalues will emerge. (Berkes & Folke, 1998, quoted in\nConflicts over control of resources and decision-making\nauthority have been observed between decentralized bodies\nand traditional authorities and also between local decentral-\nized units and community water organizations (Anani, 1999;\nJackson & Gariba, 2002). Such conflicts must be addressed\nswiftly, and the boundaries of authority of these institutions\nmust be addressed clearly and responsibly. This will require\ncollaboration at all levels where trust and respect are pursued\n(building social capital). This framework will focus on bring-\ning in vulnerable groups--poor and women--by deliberately\ntargeting them and creating space for them to participate in\ndecision making. It will require different negotiation skills\namong facilitators, policy makers, and implementers to\nbridge the gap between local authorities and government\ninstitutions over control of water resources. Within this con-\ntext, blanket cash-and-carry approaches for accessing water\nwill be reevaluated based on specific community context\nallowing each community to come up with an arrangement\nsuitable to its needs. This will minimize conflict endemic in\nthe current arrangement. Finally, climate and water policies\nmust be linked with broad social and economic activities of\nrural people. As Brown and Crawford (2008) suggested,\nGhana needs holistic adaptation measures that address the\nfull range of development problems it faces that are tangen-\ntially related to climate change, not just those that arise as a\nresult of climate change. Collectively, these will help over-\ncome the observation that because climate change transcend\nthe local scale the tools to equip adaptive learning in Africa\nare sparse, as a result of communication deficiencies which\nmake it difficult to integrate science information into climate\npolicy and practice; and lack of learning tools that encourage\nadaptation process, including experimentation and innovation\nin building resilience in complex high risk socio-ecological\nConclusion\nWhile the preceding discussion indicates that climate change\nis a wicked problem defying easy solutions, the vulnerability\nof people is a matter of degree based on specific contexts.\nSome nations, regions, groups, and individuals are better able\nto ameliorate their exposures to climate change, whereas in\nothers vulnerability can easily deteriorate into disasters.\nTherefore, the key issue to tackling climate change hinges on\nadaptive capacities based on abilities derived from availabil-\nity and access to capitals that empower communities and\nindividuals to act appropriately. In the case of Ghana, climate\nchange involves a level of complexity that goes beyond the\ncapacity of national and local water institutions to meaning-\nfully manage. The enormity has arisen from, among other\nthings, scalar dimensions of climate, diversity of climate, and\nwater-related functions, and the multitude of linkages that\nthese functions have with peoples' livelihoods. The WRC,\nCWSA, Ministries, and agencies responsible for environ-\nmental services seem to be doing alright at the international\nand national levels. But the linkages at the subnational and\nlocal levels are weak. The way forward is to maintain flexible\ncollaborative management systems that foster participation in\ndecision making, social capital formation, and coexistence of\nformal and informal knowledge systems with the ultimate\nintent of engendering social learning in an adaptive manner.\nWhether global forces are understood or not, or action is\ntaken by global powers to address climate change or not,\nlocal people cannot stop carrying on with their lives. They\nwill do what is within their power to ensure that their liveli-\nhoods and communities are not violently disrupted. Local\nmethods might be different, even insufficient, but not to be\nfrowned upon because that would amount to throwing away\nthe babe together with the bath water, denying local people\nthe opportunity to participate in their development process.\nRather, the Ghana government through its designated water\nand environmental institutions must empower rural commu-\nnities by strengthening their capacities to take charge of their\nown destinies as they have done for generations. In pursu-\nance of this objective, ACM is a reasonable management\napproach for Ghana because it focuses on sustainable devel-\nopment based on ecologically conscious, inclusive, and net-\nwork governance principles making it attractive in managing\ncomplex situations such as climate change.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAnani, K.
