Despite these\nadvances, infection is a severe complication\nin patients undergoing BMT.1\u00ad4 Human\ncytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a common\nviral infection, which is a major factor in\nmorbidity and mortality undergoing\nBMT.4\u00ad6 Rapid laboratory methods for the\nearly detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV)\nare needed for preventing CMV disease in\ntransplant recipients. Some sensitive and\nspecific laboratory tests should be used to\nrapidly diagnose CMV infection after\nBMT. Detection of the HCMV antigen\npp65 in peripheral blood mononuclear\ncells (PBLs) is preferred for\nscreening for HCMV antigenaemia. This\nis because this method is more rapid and\nsensitive than culture and has a good\npositive predictive value compared with\nCMV-DNA by polymerase chain reac-\nthe best marker for monitoring kidney\ntransplant patients might be the quantita-\ntive CMV pp65 antigen detection assay. In\ntheir study, positivity for antigen pp65\nwas used for screening for HCMV anti-\ngenaemia. HCMV infection may cause\nhepatitis and elevate the liver enzymes\naspartate transferase (AST) and alanine\ntransferase (ALT).\nOur study aimed to investigate the\nincidence of HCMV antigenaemia during\n6 months post-BMT. Because HCMV\nhepatitis is associated with solid organ\nrecipients and has little relation to\nBMT,10,11 we also investigated the associ-\nations between HCMV antigenaemia and\nALT and AST levels at different time\npoints post-BMT.\nMethods\nPatients\nof 42 patients underwent allogeneic BMT in\nour hospital. Patients who were followed\nregularly for longer than 6 months after\nreceiving transplantation in our hospital and\nprovided written informed consent were\nenrolled in the study. The exclusion criteria\nconsisted of clinical conditions that sug-\ngested a life expectancy shorter than 6\nmonths, previous HBV, HCV, or HDV\ninfections, and other liver diseases. A total\nof 30 patients completed the study. These 30\nThe characteristics of the 30 patients are\nshown in Table 1. There was no HCMV-\nseropositive donor in our series. Every\nhematopoietic stem cell donation and trans-\nplantation in our centre strictly followed the\nguidelines of the Ethics Committee of our\nhospital and the Declaration of Helsinki.\nWritten informed consent was obtained\nfrom each of the participants prior to\nenrolment. The study was approved by the\nEthics Committee of the First Affiliated\nHospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang\nImmunosuppressive therapy\nChemotherapy before transplantation con-\nsisted of busulfan (4 mg/kg/day from days\nkg/day from days \u00c03 to \u00c02). Prophylaxis\nfor graft-versus-host disease consisted of\nmycophenolate mofetil (1.0 g/day for 3\nmonths after BMT) and cyclophosphamide\n(3 mg/kg/day for 24 h by intravenous infu-\nsion, to maintain blood concentrations at\norally at 6 mg/kg/day).\nAntiviral treatment\nAll BMT recipients received ganciclovir intra-\nvenously at a standard dosage of 5 mg/kg/day\nuntil the day of transplantation. Antiviral\ntreatment for HCMV infection was started in\neach BMT recipient according to a previously\nreported preemptive therapy regimen.12,13\nBriefly, all patients received ganciclovir intra-\nvenously at a standard dosage of 5 mg/kg\nantigenaemia results were observed.\nMethods of detection\nFrom day \u00fe 1 until day \u00fe 90 after BMT,\nHCMV pp65 antigen monitoring was per-\nformed twice a month. From day \u00fe 90 until\n6 months after BMT, the pp65 antigen assay\nwas performed every month. At the same\ntime, conventional methods were used to\nassay liver enzyme levels. Liver enzyme\nlevels are usually less than 40 U/L for AST\nand less than 50 U/L for ALT. All of the\npatients were monitored twice weekly during\nthe next 2 months after BMT, and then\nevery month during the next 4 months post-\n6 months after BMT. A total of 296 blood\nsamples were taken from the 30 patients.\nImmunohistochemistry was used to identify\nCMV pp65 antigen. The CMV antigen assay\nwas performed as described previously, with\nminor modifications.11,14 A standard two-\nstep immunohistochemical method was used\nto assay CMV antigen expression in PBLs.\nIn brief, leukocytes were separated from\nEDTA-anticoagulated blood and spread on\nslides. Anti-CMV-PP65-Ag monoclonal\nantibody (DAKO, Denmark) and the\nEnvisionTM \u00fe System peroxidase (DAB) kit\n(DAKO) were used. The stained samples\nwere analysed under an optical microscope\nwith an image recording system (BH-2,\nOLYMPUS, Japan). Cells that were stained\nyellow or brown were positive and blue cells\nwere negative. The results are shown as the\ncytes, as previously described.15\nDiagnosis of HCMV antigenaemia\nHCMV antigenaemia is defined by sero-\nlogical conversion to CMV in a patient who\nhad been seronegative before transplant-\nation. In our study, we used antigenaemia\nTable 1.

A P value of\nless than 0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nTwelve (40.00%) patients were classified\ninto the HCMV antigenaemia-positive\nsified into the HCMV antigenaemia-nega-\ntive group. Ten of 12 patients were positive\nfor HCMV antigenaemia during the first 3\nmonths post-BMT. Two patients were posi-\ntive for pp65 antigen in the first month post-\nBMT, four were positive in the second\nmonth, four were positive in the third\nmonth, one was positive in the fifth month,\nand one was positive in the sixth month. In\nthe HCMV antigenaemia-positive group, 10\npatients' ALT levels were normal before\nantigenaemia and nine patients' AST levels\nwere normal.

Cell-\nmediated immunity for BMT recipients\nduring the first 100 days post-transplantation\nis impaired because some infection may\nWe found that HCMV infection was\nsignificantly associated with liver enzyme\nlevels. A previous study showed that ALT\nand AST values started to increase at the\ntime of distinct CMV infection (day 12),\nsuggesting an association between CMV\ninfection and elevated liver enzyme levels.21\nIn our study, the number of patients\nwhose ALT/AST levels were elevated at\ndifferent time points in the HCMV\nantigenaemia-positive group and the\nHCMV antigenaemia-negative group was\nsignificantly different (P < 0.05).\nSpecifically, ALT and AST levels at 1\nmonth before HCMV antigenaemia were\nsignificantly elevated. Some studies have\nshown no significant differences between\nthe infection and control groups regarding\nother factors that produce an increase in\nliver enzyme levels, such as age and the use\nof immunosuppressive agents after trans-\nplantation.22,23 Therefore, we suggest that\nthere is a significant association between\nHCMV infection and an increase in liver\nenzyme levels (ALT and AST) before\nHCMV antigenaemia. HCMV induces acti-\nvation of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) after\ninfecting fibroblasts and macrophage cells.\nNF-kB response elements are present in the\nenhancer region of the CMV major imme-\ndiate early promoter, and activity of this\npromotor is strongly upregulated by NF-kB\nin transient transfection assays.24 This acti-\nvation of NF-kB may activate cytokines,\nwhich may lead to liver injury and increased\nALT and AST levels.\nTable 3.

A limitation of our study was the\nrelatively small number of patients, which\nmight be associated with large interpersonal\nvariation.
