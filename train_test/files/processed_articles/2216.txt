Friedmann, MD, MPH*\nBackground: To investigate how incarceration may affect risk of\nacquiring HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, we tested\nassociations of ex-offenders' sexual risk behavior with the male-female\nsex ratio and the male incarceration rate.\nMethods: Longitudinal data from 1287 drug-involved persons on\nprobation and parole as part of the Criminal Justice Drug Abuse\nTreatment Studies were matched by county of residence with popula-\ntion factors, and stratified by race/ethnicity and gender. Generalized\nestimating equations assessed associations of having unprotected sex\nwith a partner who had HIV risk factors, and having 1 sex partner in\nthe past month.\nResults: Among non-Hispanic black men and women, low sex ratios\nwere associated with greater risk of having unprotected sex with a risky\npartner (adjusted relative risk [ARR]  1.76, 95% confidence interval\nAmong non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white (NHW) women,\nlow sex ratios were associated with having 1 sex partner (ARR \nrespectively). High incarceration rates were associated with greater risk\nof having a risky partner for all men (non-Hispanic black: ARR  2.14,\nConclusions: Low sex ratios and high incarceration rates may\ninfluence the number and risk characteristics of sex partners of ex-\noffenders. HIV-prevention policies and programs for ex-offenders\ncould be improved by addressing structural barriers to safer sexual\nbehavior.\nIn the United States, one in every 100 adults is currently\nincarcerated, the highest rate in the world.1 Racial and ethnic\ndisparities in the criminal justice experience parallel those\nobserved in HIV/AIDS, with non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs) and\nHispanics representing about 12% and 16% of the general\npopulation, respectively,2 but about 41% and 22% of those\nincarcerated,3 and 49% and 20% of those recently diagnosed\nwith AIDS.4 Better understanding the determinants of behavior\nthat facilitate HIV transmission among the population that\nexperiences incarceration may be critical for understanding\nboth overall HIV/AIDS epidemiology and trends in racial/\nethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS.\nIncarceration affects the inmates' sexual partnerships,\nsocial networks, families, and communities, and these effects\nmay extend throughout the period of community supervision.\nPeople on probation and parole are required to meet regularly\nwith a parole or probation officer and abide by supervision\nconditions. In 2007, 5.1 million people were on probation or\nparole.5 Returning to the community may also entail a return to\ndrug use and sexual behaviors and, for some, to an increase\nbeyond preincarceration levels.6 Prisoners returning to the\ncommunity may also have limited social and economic oppor-\ntunities, often experiencing homelessness, poverty, and unsta-\nble living circumstances, which can contribute to vulnerability\nto HIV infection. People under community supervision can be\nespecially vulnerable to population determinants of sexual be-\nhavior and may be more likely to engage in relationships with\nrisky sex partners. For example, high rates of relationship\ndissolution, difficulties finding housing or employment on\nrelease, and relapse to drug use may encourage some ex-\ninmates to engage in sexual relationships in exchange for\nhousing or money. The relative availability of partners in\ncommunities where inmates are released may facilitate or\nimpede development of sexual relationships with multiple\npartners, or with partners that may be more likely to be\ninfected with HIV or other sexually transmitted infections\n(STIs) themselves, or that may belong to a sexual network\nthat includes infected individuals.\nThe male-female sex ratio and the male incarceration\nrate may represent structural or population factors outside of\nindividual control that can affect sexual behavior and member-\nship in sexual networks that may help explain the link between\nracial/ethnic disparities in HIV prevalence and in incarceration.\nThe sex ratio is calculated as the number of men per 100\nFrom the *Division of General Internal Medicine, Rhode Island Hos-\npital/Brown Medical School, Providence, RI; National Develop-\nment and Research Institutes, Inc, New York, NY; Criminology,\nLaw and Society Department, George Mason University, Fairfax,\nVA; \u00a7Department of Criminal Justice, University of Delaware,\nWilmington, DE; and \u00b6Integrated Substance Abuse Programs, Uni-\nversity of California, Los Angeles, CA\nFunding for this work was provided under a cooperative agreement\nfrom the National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of\nHealth (National Institute for Drug Abuse/National Institutes of\nHealth), with support from the Center for Substance Abuse Treat-\nment, SAMHSA; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC); the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism\n(all part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services);\nand from the Bureau of Justice Assistance of the U.S. Department\nof Justice.

Although slightly more boys are born than girls,\nwomen tend to outnumber men in adulthood, as male mortality\nrate surpasses that of females throughout the lifespan. Incar-\nceration, military service, and migration can also lower the sex\nratio. These effects may be more pronounced in some geo-\ngraphic areas and racial/ethnic groups. For example, a high\nblack male incarceration rate may have a large impact on a\ncity's or county's sex ratio for blacks in the reproductive age\nrange (ages: 15\u00ad49 years), but may not be noticeable at the\nneighborhood or state level, and may have no association with\nsex ratios of other racial/ethnic or age-groups. A low sex ratio,\nindicating a shortage of men, reflects an increased demographic\nopportunity for the men remaining in the community to accrue\nmore heterosexual partners. For people on probation or parole,\nopportunities for sexual partnerships with low-risk partners\nmay be limited by the assortative nature of sexual partnerships\nand by the perception among potential partners that ex-offend-\ners are members of a high-risk group.\nAlthough the incarceration rate may directly relate to\nHIV incidence through incarceration of injection drug users, it\nmay also serve as an independent indicator of the rate of\nrelationship disruption or of relationship vulnerability.6,7\nAmong men with primary partners, incarceration for longer\nthan a month can lead to relationship dissolution and to having\nmultiple sex partners on release.6 Having a partner who was\nrecently incarcerated has been associated with having multiple,\ntransactional, concurrent, and risky partners, as well as with\nhaving had a recent HIV or STI diagnosis.8,9 Partner charac-\nteristics are likely to reflect characteristics of risk networks.\nThus, incarceration may decrease the ability of former prisoners to\nmaintain safer social and sexual networks they may have had\nbefore incarceration. Few studies have examined sexual risk be-\nhavior during parole and probation,10\u00ad14 with most focused on\nindividual knowledge and attitudes or relationship factors.\nThis study aimed to explore the influence, before and\nduring community supervision, of 2 potential population deter-\nminants of sexual behavior thought to increase exposure to HIV\nand other STIs: the sex ratio and the male incarceration rate in\nthe county of residence.\nSample\nThe data came from the 2 completed studies with over-\nlapping instruments that were part of the Criminal Justice Drug\nAbuse Treatment Studies-1 (CJDATS) cooperative agreement.\nOne study, Transitional Case Management, tested whether case\nmanagement during reentry increases participation in commu-\nnity drug abuse treatment, enhances access to social services,\nand improves outcomes during a 9-month follow-up. Eligible\nparticipants were (a) at least aged 18 years; (b) referred to a\ncommunity-based substance abuse treatment program; (c)\nwithin 2 to 3 months of release; and (d) released to a metro-\npolitan area where case management activities were being\nconducted. The second study, Step'n Out, examined the effect\nof collaborative behavioral management that integrated treat-\nment counseling and community supervision versus standard\nparole on crime, drug use, and rearrest during 9-month follow-\nup. Parolees with preincarceration substance use disorders at\nmoderate-to-high risk of recidivism constituted the target pop-\nulation. Inclusion criteria were (a) at least 18 years old; (b)\nEnglish speaking; (c) probable drug dependence immediately\nbefore incarceration (i.e., Texas Christian University [TCU]\nDrug Screen II15 score 3 or mandated drug treatment); (d)\nsubstance use treatment as a mandated or recommended con-\ndition of parole; (e) moderate-to-high risk of drug relapse\nand/or recidivism (i.e., Lifestyle Criminality Screening Form\n[LCSF] score 716 or a history of 2 prior drug abuse treat-\nment episodes or drug-related convictions). Neither of the\nstudies aimed to alter HIV risk behavior, and intervention\ncontent did not directly address HIV. Study descriptions and\nData for the present analysis included 1287 drug-in-\nvolved participants on probation and parole across 23 locations\nand up to 3 time points. Study sites were located in Rhode\nIsland, Connecticut, Delaware, Virginia, Oregon, Kentucky,\nand Colorado.\nVariables\nIndividual-Level Factors. Baseline self-reported age,\nrace/ethnicity, gender and marital status (married/living as mar-\nried with partner  1, else 0), a time-varying variable, were\nassessed at each interview.\nPopulation Factors. Using decennial census data, we\nestimated 3 population factors: sex ratios, incarceration rates,\nand poverty rates for the participants' counties of recruitment\nand follow-up, which were used as an indicator for county of\nresidence. Poverty rate served as a control variable. County was\nassumed to approximate the catchment area of potential sexual\npartners. Two separate sex ratios were calculated for each\nracial/ethnic group. An assortative or matched sex ratio was\ncalculated for the NHB, non-Hispanic white (NHW), and His-\npanic populations. A disassortative sex ratio was also calcu-\nlated for each race/ethnicity using the sum of the population in\nracial/ethnic categories other than that of the target racial/ethnic\ngroup. To facilitate comparisons, a median split defined cate-\ngories of the population factors for each race/ethnicity and\ngender, where low sex ratios and high incarceration and pov-\nerty rates were dummy coded (1/0). In locations with sparse\ndata for a given racial category, the population factor was set to\nmissing, but was retained in the analysis as a separate category.\nTable 1 defines the population factor cut-points.\nOutcomes. HIV/AIDS risk behaviors were collected\nby interview at baseline, 3- and 9-month follow-up using a\nmodified version of the National Institute for Drug AbuseRisk\nBehavior Assessment.18 We analyzed 2 sexual risk behaviors\nreported in the past 30 days: sex with multiple partners (any\ngender) and unprotected sex with a risky partner. Sex with\nmultiple partners was defined as reporting 2 or more to the\nfollowing question: \"In the past 30 days, how many different\npeople have you had sex (vaginal, anal, or oral) with?\" People\nwho reported 0 or 1 partner were included in the reference\ngroup. Engaging in unprotected sex with a risky partner was\ndefined as 0 response to any of the following questions: \"How\nmany times in the past 30 days have you had unprotected sex\n(vaginal, anal, or oral) with: (a) someone who is not your primary\npartner; (b) someone who shot drugs with needles; (c) someone\nwho sometimes smokes crack/cocaine and/or methamphetamine;\nor (d) while trading sex for drugs, money, or gifts?\" People who\nreported 0 to all of these questions or who reported no sex in the\npast 30 days were included in the reference group.\nAnalysis\nBecause of known race and gender differences in crim-\ninal justice populations,1 drug use,19 health equity,20 and HIV\nrisk behaviors,21 we stratified the analyses into NHB males,\nSex Risk During Parole\nNHW males, Hispanic Males, NHB females, and NHW fe-\nmales. Hispanic females (N  39) and all other race categories\n(N  55) were excluded because of small population sizes. To\nadjust for similarities within site and across time for the same\nparticipant, generalized estimating equations (GEEs) with a log\nlink (to estimate relative risks) were built. Because our goal\nwas to generate population-average estimates of the association\nbetween population-level determinants and HIV sexual risk be-\nhavior and given their greater statistical flexibility, GEEs were\npreferred over nonlinear mixed models (e.g., SAS [version 9.2,\nCary, NC] Proc GLIMMIX). Parallel analyses were conducted\nusing Proc GLIMMIX as a sensitivity analysis. Similar findings\nfor many of the analyses were detected but appeared less robust\nwhen there were smaller sample sizes with only 2 to 3 points\nper person, a known drawback of this modeling approach.22\nMulticollinearity was checked for the full models using\nvariance inflation factors and, when indicated, reduced par-\nsimonious models are presented. All models controlled for\nindividual-level factors and time (as a fixed effect). Individ-\nual-level factors included age, time, Criminal Justice Drug\nAbuse Treatment Studies-1 (Transitional Case Management\nor Step'n'Out), and marital status. Time interactions were\ntested but were either not significant or unstable (because of\nsparse data); therefore, we present only main effects.\nThis study was approved by the Rhode Island Hospital\nInstitutional Review Board and, for the 2 underlying studies, by\neach site Institutional Review Board, and the federal Office of\nHuman Research and Protection.\nRESULTS\nSample Characteristics and Preincarceration HIV\nRisk Behaviors\nwere a median 34 years old,  one-third had completed high\nschool, and a minority were married or living as married with\na partner before incarceration (Table 2). Women were a median\n35 years old and also had low educational attainment. Prein-\ncarceration HIV sexual risk behaviors were common. Having\nmultiple sex partners in the past 30 days was reported by more\nthan a third of men, and slightly under a third of women. NHB\nmen had the highest prevalence of having multiple sex partners\nin the 30 days before incarceration. Both NHB men and women\nhad the lowest prevalence of having unprotected sex with a\nrisky partner in the 30 days before incarceration.\nPopulation factors differed greatly across racial/ethnic\ngroups (Table 1). NHB participants had higher median rates for\nincarceration and lower median sex ratio values compared with\nboth NHW and Hispanic participants.\nSocial Determinants and HIV Sex Risk Behaviors\nDuring Community Supervision\nTable 3 reports unadjusted and adjusted relative risk\n(ARR) ratios for the population determinants of interest, strat-\nified by gender and race/ethnicity.\nNon-Hispanic Black Participants\nAmong NHB male participants, both unadjusted (rela-\n[1.39, 3.30]) models revealed significant associations of higher\nincarceration rate with increased risk of having unprotected sex\ndetected significant associations of lower matched sex ratio\nwith increased risk of having unprotected sex with a risky\npartner. Sex ratios and incarceration rates were not significantly\nassociated with having multiple recent sex partners among\nNHB male participants.\nIn unadjusted analyses among NHB female participants,\nthe matched sex ratio exhibited a strong association with the\nrisk of engaging in unprotected sex with a risky partner (RR:\n[1.12, 4.09]). However, the adjusted model demonstrated mul-\nticollinearity between the poverty rate and sex ratio variables.\nTherefore, reduced models were fit that removed the variables\nin a stepwise manner. Reduced models without poverty rate\nconfirmed the previously detected associations between the\nmatched sex ratio and the risk of engaging in unprotected sex\nwith a risky partner during community supervision (ARR: 2.48\n[1.31, 4.73]) and with a low matched sex ratio and greater risk\nNon-Hispanic White Participants\nFor the NHW males, a higher incarceration rate (ARR:\nengaging in unprotected sex with a risky partner and with\nUnadjusted models for the NHW females revealed asso-\nciations between the low disassortative sex ratio (RR: 1.72\n[1.03, 2.88]) and having multiple sex partners. Multicollinear-\nity between poverty and both sex ratios precluded multivariable\nanalysis of having multiple partners. Reduced adjusted models\nthat removed poverty and age and included either sex ratio\nfound an association between lower sex ratio and having mul-\nlinks were also fit to these data: low sex ratios (matched\nTABLE 1.

Sex ratios and incarceration rates were not\nsignificantly associated with having multiple recent sex part-\nners in this group.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this sample of people on probation and parole, sex\nratios and incarceration rates in the county of residence pre-\ndicted the quantity and HIV risk characteristics of recent sex\npartners. NHB male and female participants living in counties\nwith low NHB sex ratios had greater risk of having unprotected\nsex with a risky partner. For these groups, the interaction\nbetween having been incarcerated and living in an area with a\nshortage of men may facilitate participation in or entrance into\nriskier sexual networks. This could partly explain elevated HIV\nand STI rates among blacks compared with whites. For NHB\nwomen, low NHB sex ratios were also associated with having\nmultiple partners. The status of NHB men as ex-offenders may\nhave limited their opportunities to acquire less risky partners.\nSignificant associations were also observed among\nNHW and Hispanic participants. High incarceration rates were\nassociated with greater risk of having unprotected sex with a\nrisky partner among Hispanic men and of having both unpro-\ntected sex with a risky partner and having more than one\npartner among NHW men. Hispanic men were more likely to\nhave unprotected sex with a risky partner if the disassortative\nsex ratio was low. NHW women were more likely to have\nmultiple partners if they lived in a county with low-matched or\ndisassortative sex ratios. The associations of disassortative sex\nratios among NHW women and Hispanic men may reflect more\ninterracial/ethnic opposite sex partnerships with risky partners.\nA recent national population-based study found that low\nsex ratios and high male incarceration rates were associated\nwith a greater likelihood of having multiple partners in the past\nyear among NHB men, but not among NHB women.23 Al-\nthough the population and sexual behavior questions differ\nfrom those of the current study, the findings among NHB men\nare similar. One other study of the effects of sex ratios and\nincarceration rates on sexual behavior among blacks showed no\nassociation among men and a positive association among\nwomen.24 Further analyses indicated that this finding was the\nresult of less sex work among women in low sex ratio areas.\nHowever, that study used sex ratio data from the census tract (a\nsmaller geographic unit) in a single geographic area, and it is\nunclear how well this unit describes the area in which people\nseek partners.25 Geographic studies of mobility of drug-in-\nvolved parolees suggest this population changes residences\nacross moderate distances.26 Thus, county of residence may\nprovide a reasonable estimate of the catchment area for poten-\ntial sex partners.\nPoverty was treated as a control variable in our analyses\nand was retained whenever possible in the models. Modeling\nproblems arose when poverty rate was collinear with 1 or more\nof the exposures of interest. As this happened only in instances\namong the women, and sample sizes for the women were the\nsmallest, it is not possible to entirely disentangle the effects of\nsmall cell sizes (a statistical problem) from sex-specific vul-\nTABLE 2.

That is, collinearity may\nhave been because of high levels of the female probationer/\nparolee's particular vulnerabilities, linked to syndemics 27\u00ad29 of\nsex work, transactional sex, limited social support and family\nties, proclivity to return to neighborhoods with concentrated\npoverty, high male incarceration rates, and fewer same-race\nmale partners. Analyses to explore these associations in a larger\nsample of women under community supervision are needed.\nResults underscore the fragility of the reentry period and\nthe need to focus efforts on housing, work assistance, and job\nplacement in the community. Ex-offenders are disqualified\nfrom many sources of public support and have difficulty finding\nemployment,11 and people convicted of state or federal felonies\ninvolving the use or sale of drugs are banned from receiving\ncash benefits or food stamps.30 These diminished life opportu-\nnities may decrease ex-offenders' ability to develop and main-\ntain committed sexual partnerships or marriage. This may be\nmore pronounced among NHB males because of high levels of\nunemployment and incarceration.\nOur findings have several limitations. First, data were\nself-reported and may have been affected by measurement\nerror. Sexual risk behavior outcomes did not distinguish be-\ntween vaginal, anal, and oral sex, and between same-gender\nand opposite-gender sex. Second, it was not possible to distin-\nguish all instances of condom use from sex; thus, results may\nconflate influences on both frequency of sex and frequency of\ncondom use. The sample may not have provided sexual risk or\npopulation data that were representative of all racial/ethnic\npopulations on community supervision. The lack of a control\ngroup precludes analysis of incarceration as an individual fac-\ntor. For the Transitional Case Management study, which re-\ncruited participants in prison, county of recruitment may be a\npoor proxy for county of residence. However, sensitivity anal-\nyses iteratively eliminating Transitional Case Management\nsites indicated no fundamental change in the magnitude or\ndirection of the observed associations. The relatively small size\nof racial/ethnic subsamples precluded testing nonlinear associ-\nations with sex ratios, which are known to exist.23 We were\nunable to include data from counties with small populations.\nFinally, our exploratory analyses detected statistically signifi-\ncant and valid associations, but the use of GEEs with a log link\nreturned unstable RRs in some strata, especially the women.\nReplication of these findings in a larger sample of women\nrecently released from incarceration is recommended.\nImplications\nA lack of adequate primary and secondary HIV preven-\ntive interventions suggests that new approaches are needed to\nreduce HIV transmission to and from minority populations.31\nTo this end, efforts to address population factors may return\ngreater HIV-prevention effects. For instance, interventions to\nreduce the incarceration rate in a community, such as through\nthe use of drug courts32 or implementation research that re-\naligns police and parole/probation officer interventions with\nTABLE 3.

Improving access to treatment\nfor drug-dependent inmates, before release and on reentry, can\nreduce recidivism, improve health outcomes,34 and, in time,\nmay promote lifestyle and sexual partnership stability. Other\npolicy interventions, such as lifting restrictions against people\nwith criminal histories from receipt of public housing or other\nsupport, can influence community HIV risk by reducing a\nstructural barrier that undermines committed partnerships.11\nPublic health may be served by helping incarcerated men and\nwomen maintain their marriages or other important partner-\nships, especially considering that most incarcerations last under\n1 year,3 that many people are reincarcerated,1 and that relation-\nship dissolution has been found to be related to subsequent\nsexual risk behavior.6\nIn conclusion, our findings suggest that ex-offenders\nliving in counties with a low sex ratio or a high incarceration\nrate are particularly vulnerable to sexual behavior and partner\ncharacteristics that may put them at risk for HIV or other STIs,\nparticularly for those living in high prevalence areas. Research\nis needed to determine whether racial/ethnic differences in sex\nratios or incarceration rates contribute to racial/ethnic dispari-\nties in sexual transmission of HIV or other STIs.\nREFERENCES\n1.
