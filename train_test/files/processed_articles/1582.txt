We evaluated cysticer-\nrace, sex, age, state of residence, country of birth, and year\nof death. A total of 221 cysticercosis deaths were identified.\nMortality rates were highest for Latinos (adjusted rate ratio\n[ARR] 94.5, relative to whites) and men (ARR = 1.8). The\nhad emigrated from Mexico. The 33 US-born persons who\ndied of cysticercosis represented 15% of all cysticercosis-\nrelated deaths. The cysticercosis mortality rate was highest\nin California, which accounted for 60% of all deaths.\nAlthough uncommon, cysticercosis is a cause of premature\ndeath in the United States. Fatal cysticercosis affected\nmainly immigrants from Mexico and other Latin American\ncountries; however, US-born persons were also affected.\nCysticercosis, a parasitic infection caused by the larval\nform of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium, has been\nincreasingly recognized as a cause of severe but preventa-\nble neurologic disease in the United States (1\u00ad5). Reports\ndocumenting hundreds of cases, mainly of neurocysticer-\ncosis, have drawn attention to this previously underrecog-\nnized disease (6,7).\nCysticercosis has a complex life cycle. The larval\ninfection, cysticercosis, is transmitted through the fecal-\noral route. Eggs from the adult tapeworm T. solium, which\nare directly infectious, are shed in the feces of a human\ntapeworm carrier and subsequently ingested by pigs, the\nusual intermediate host (8). The oncosphere embryos\nemerge from the eggs, penetrate the intestinal wall, and are\ndisseminated by the bloodstream to various tissues where\nthe larval stage, or cysticercus, develops. The cycle is\ncompleted when humans, the only naturally infected defin-\nitive host, consume raw or undercooked pork containing\ncysticerci, which attach to the small bowel and develop\ninto the adult tapeworm. However, humans may also\nbecome infected with the larval stage when eggs are\ningested, typically in contaminated food or water.\nNeurocysticercosis, the most severe form of the disease,\noccurs when larvae invade tissue of the central nervous\nsystem.\nCysticercosis in the United States affects mainly\nimmigrants from Latin America, where the disease is\nendemic. However, cysticercosis acquired in the United\nStates has been repeatedly documented over the past 15\nyears, and travel-related infection in US-born persons has\nbeen reported (9\u00ad11). Given the ongoing sizeable immi-\ngration from disease-endemic areas, cysticercosis will\ngrow in clinical and public health importance; however,\ndata on cysticercosis in the United States are lacking. The\ndisease is not nationally reportable, few local jurisdictions\nrequire reporting, and surveillance systems for cysticerco-\nsis have rarely been implemented (10,12). In the absence\nof effective surveillance, the true prevalence of cysticerco-\nsis in the United States is largely unknown. Although sev-\neral hospital-based series have provided valuable insights\ninto the occurrence of cysticercosis, they reflect only a\nportion of actual cases and do not measure the true effect\nof the disease on the general population and at-risk popu-\nlations. Moreover, few data exist on cysticercosis as a\ncause of death in the United States (6,13). To augment cur-\nrent information on the effect of cysticercosis in the United\nStates, we evaluated national mortality records for cys-\nMethods\nData Source\nMortality data were obtained from the National Center\nfor Health Statistics (NCHS). Death certificates, which are\nrequired by state law, must indicate a cause or sequence of\nDeaths from Cysticercosis,\nUnited States\nFrank J. Sorvillo,* Christopher DeGiorgio,* and Stephen H. Waterman\n*University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA;\nDepartment of Public Health, Los Angeles County, California,\nUSA; and University of California, San Diego, California, USA\nevents that led to death, as determined by the attending\nphysician. If a physician is not in attendance or the death\nis accidental or occurs under suspicious circumstances,\nthen cause of death is determined by the local coroner or\nmedical examiner. Death certificate data are transmitted\nfrom state jurisdictions to NCHS. The US Multiple Cause\nnational data source typically has a 3-year lag time. The\nmultiple cause of death data contain all causes of death\nprovided by the physician or coroner. Such information is\nmore complete than data files with primary cause of death\nonly. Additional variables extracted from the death record\nincluded age, sex, race/ethnicity, level of education, coun-\ntry of birth, place of death, date of death, and other concur-\nrent conditions.\nData Analysis\nCysticercosis mortality rates per million population\nwere calculated. Population data were obtained from the\nUS Census Bureau. Crude cysticercosis mortality rates and\n95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed by age\n(white, black, Latino, Asian, Native American), and state\nof residence. Age-adjusted rates were calculated for\nrace/ethnicity, sex, and state. The US population for the\nyear 2000 was used as the standard population for all age-\nadjusted rates. Rate ratios, adjusted rate ratios, and 95%\nCIs were also computed. Demographic characteristics of\nUS-born patients were compared with those of foreign-\nborn patients. The 2, Fisher exact, and Student t tests were\nused where appropriate to assess apparent differences.\nConditions occurring with cysticercosis were examined\nand compared with a random sample of deaths from caus-\nes other than cysticercosis matched by patient age, sex, and\nrace/ethnicity. Matched odds ratios and 95% CIs were cal-\nculated for each condition.\nResults\ndeaths were identified, representing an annual age-adjust-\ned mortality rate of 0.06 per million population (95% CI,\nmale, and 84 (38.0%) were female.

At least 1 cysticercosis death was reported from 20\nstates; California accounted for 57% (126 deaths), and Los\nAngeles County, California, recorded 32% (70 deaths) of\nthe US total (Figure).

Substantially more\ndeaths occurred in California, particularly Los Angeles\nCounty, and in southwestern states bordering Mexico.\nAlthough cysticercosis causes death mainly among\nHispanic immigrants, our findings indicate that this larval\ntapeworm causes infection and death in US-born persons\nas well.\nThe elevated cysticercosis mortality rates for Latinos\nreflect the substantial immigration from T.\nsolium\u00adendemic areas of Mexico and other Latin\nAmerican countries. Over 70% of cysticercosis deaths\nwere of persons born in Mexico. Legal immigration to the\nmillion; >1 million additional immigrants came from\nCentral and South American countries (14). Moreover,\nundocumented immigration from such areas continues to\noccur in considerable numbers. The US Immigration and\nNaturalization Service estimates that 7 million unautho-\nrized immigrants (4.8 million of these from Mexico) were\nresiding in the United States in January 2000 and that an\nCysticercosis and taeniasis are widely prevalent in many\nLatin American countries. Autopsy studies conducted in\nMexico have reported cysticercosis prevalence from\n2.8% to 3.6%, and serosurveys have demonstrated infec-\ntion rates of >20% in some areas of Peru, Guatemala, and\nBolivia (3,15). A recent study of farm workers in southern\nCalifornia documented seroprevalence of 1.8% for cys-\nticercosis and 1.1% for taeniasis, comparable to that in\ncysticercosis-endemic areas (16).\nWe noted several cysticercosis deaths of persons who\nwere born in the United States, which indicates the possi-\nbility of locally acquired disease. Transmission of cysticer-\ncosis in the United States has been repeatedly documented\nover the past 20 years and can often be traced to the pres-\nence of a tapeworm carrier among household members or\nneurocysticercosis in an Orthodox Jewish community in\nNew York City implicated domestic employees from Latin\n \nFigure.

A pilot surveillance system imple-\nfied 10 locally acquired cases among 138 cases reported\nand found a tapeworm carrier among household contacts\nAlternatively, the occurrence of cysticercosis among\nUS-born persons may reflect travel-related exposure and\ninfection. Travel-associated cysticercosis, mainly in per-\nsons who have visited Mexico and other Latin American\ncountries, has been previously documented; however the\nrisk and frequency of such infections are unknown (10,18).\nThe Los Angeles County surveillance system identified 9\nprobable travel-related cases, which represented 6.5% of\nthe total cysticercosis cases. In a study of cysticercosis in\nTexas, de La Garza and colleagues reported 6 cases in US-\nborn persons, all of whom had a history of frequent travel\nto rural Mexico or Central America (19). Substantial num-\nbers of US residents travel to cysticercosis-endemic areas\neach year and may be exposed to food and water contami-\nnated with T. solium eggs. Therefore, many of the US-born\npersons likely acquired infection during travel to endemic\nareas. Food and water precautions for travelers to cysticer-\ncosis-endemic regions should be reinforced.\nAlthough 21 states had at least 1 death from cysticer-\ncosis, mortality rates were highest in California and other\nborder states. Cysticercosis deaths were also routinely\nrecorded in New York and Florida. This observed geo-\ngraphic focus of cysticercosis deaths reflects immigration\npatterns in states that include substantial populations of\nimmigrants from cysticercosis-endemic areas, particularly\nMexico and other areas of Latin America.\nThe sex disparity noted in this study is consistent with\ndata from our recent population study, which demonstrat-\ned a significantly higher prevalence of cysticercosis in men\n(16) and likely reflects the greater immigration of young\nmen in search of employment. Such immigration patterns\nmay also explain the relatively young age observed; >60%\nof cysticercosis deaths in our study were in persons <45\nyears of age, a heavy toll among young, highly productive\npersons.\nAlthough we could not assess whether problems with\naccess to healthcare contributed to cysticercosis deaths,\n>20% of deaths occurred at home, in an emergency room,\nor in an outpatient setting. Reduced access may have an\neffect on cysticercosis deaths; additional data on this issue\nwould be useful.\nSeveral large facility-based case series studies have\nreported that the number of deaths from cysticercosis is\nrelatively low and that the case-fatality rate is <1%.\nHowever, such facility-based studies, although providing\nvaluable information, have substantial limitations and may\nunderestimate cysticercosis as a cause of death. Limited\ndata from the pilot Los Angles County surveillance system\nfound a mortality rate of 6% (8 of 138 incident cases),\nand the Dixon study of British troops who had served in\nHowever, these case-fatality rates must be viewed with\ncaution because they may reflect underdiagnosis or under-\nreporting of less severe cases and therefore probably rep-\nresent overestimates. Mortality rates have been reported to\nbe higher for surgically treated patients and those with\nhydrocephalus, primarily because of increased intracranial\npressure and shunt-related infection (21). We found that\nhydrocephalus, cerebral compression/edema, and epilep-\nsy/convulsions were common concurrent conditions\nrecorded on the death certificate. Fatal cysticercosis may\nalso occur in persons who have ingested large numbers of\neggs, which may cause an overwhelming, fatal acute infec-\ntion with numerous larvae and severe central nervous sys-\ntem pathologic changes. Racemose cysticercosis, a\nphenomenon in which cysticerci continue to grow and pro-\nliferate through tissue, may also have a poor prognosis.\nNewer, less invasive, endoscopic surgical techniques for\nremoving intraventricular cysticerci offer promise of\nreducing mortality rates (22).\nOur data, although population based, likely underesti-\nmate cysticercosis deaths for several reasons. To be listed\non the death certificate, cysticercosis must be recognized\nand diagnosed, which requires confirmation of infection\nthrough biopsy, autopsy, or specialized serologic testing\n(23). Consequently, some cases of fatal cysticercosis like-\nly go undiagnosed and unrecognized, which would result\nin the miscoding of cysticercosis-related deaths as other\nconditions. For this reason, death records may be biased\nand likely underestimate deaths from cysticercosis. The\nabsence of fatal cases reported from Kansas, despite a\nDeaths from Cysticercosis, United States\nrecent report documenting widespread cysticercosis (24),\nappears to support the notion of underrecognition of fatal\ncases and suggests caution in interpreting geographic dis-\ntribution. Our findings demonstrate the benefits of using\nmultiple-cause-of-death data instead of the traditional\nunderlying-cause-of-death data alone for estimating deaths\nfrom cysticercosis. An additional 56 (25.3%) cases were\nidentified by using multiple-cause\u00adcoded files.\nThe use of death certificates to assess the effect of dis-\nease has advantages and limitations. Because submission\nof death certificates is required by state law, ascertainment\nand registration of deaths are virtually complete. Use of\nmortality records therefore provides population-based data\nand avoids the potential biases of facility-based data or\nother data that are not population based. Mortality data can\nalso indicate disease severity and contribute to measures of\ndisease load. However, data from death certificates have\nseveral limitations, including the possible coding of inac-\ncurate information through careless completion of cause of\ndeath, coding errors, and misclassification of variables\nsuch as race/ethnicity (25,26). Reporting of country of\nbirth may also be inaccurate, and persons with cysticerco-\nsis who are recorded as having been born in the United\nStates may, in fact, be foreign born. Deaths from cysticer-\ncosis represent only a small fraction of total disease bur-\nden. In addition, census data and intercensus population\nestimates used for the calculation of rates may be uncer-\ntain. For these reasons, our estimate of cysticercosis mor-\ntality rate must be interpreted with caution.\nCysticercosis can cause severe neurologic disease and\ndeath and result in substantial cost to the healthcare sys-\ntem, yet simple public health measures can reduce or elim-\ninate this parasitic disease. In fact, cysticercosis has been\nidentified as 1 of 6 potentially eradicable diseases (27).\nBecause most cysticercosis cases in the United States are\nimported, efforts to control the disease in cysticercosis-\nendemic regions will reduce disease in the United States.\nSuch control activities can also reduce the likelihood of\ntravel-related infection. State and local health authorities\nin affected areas of the United States should consider\nimplementing surveillance and follow-up of cysticercosis\npatients, including attempts to identify and treat tapeworm\ncarriers among household members and other close per-\nsonal contacts. The availability of a sensitive and specific\ntest for T. solium infection that can be performed from\nblood samples obtained through simple finger stick will\nfacilitate such follow-up (28). Given the importance of\ncysticercosis in border areas, collaborative studies with\nMexican public health authorities on the prevalence and\nincidence of cysticercosis in the border regions should be\nDr Sorvillo is professor in-residence in the Department of\nEpidemiology at the School of Public Health, University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles, California.
