Muscle strength as a measure of impairment and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-\nForm Health Survey (SF-36) score as a measure of HRQOL are important factors in understanding disability in older\nMexican Americans.\nVERY few studies have examined how disability\ndevelops among older Mexican Americans (1\u00ad5). For\na population that experiences relatively low mortality\ndespite low socioeconomic status, termed the Hispanic\nParadox (6,7), it is crucial to examine how factors that\ninfluence mortality, such as disability, develop. Moreover,\ndisability is a very real public health issue. Approximately\n20% of older adults in the United States have some type\nof chronic disability, and almost one third have mobility\nlimitations (8). Medical care for a disabled older adult costs,\non average, three times more than care for a nondisabled\nsenior (9). As the percentage and numbers of older Mexican\nAmericans rapidly increases, the impact of their rising rates\nof disability on health care is unknown.\nDisability research among older adults has, until recently,\nfocused primarily on either non-Hispanic Whites or non-\nHispanic Blacks (e.g., 3\u00ad5). It is not clear how the\ndisablement process works in older Mexican-American\nadults. However, research suggests that greater disability\nand health disadvantages exist among Mexican Americans\nrelative to older Whites (e.g., 2,5,10). Also, previous research\nindicates that older Mexican Americans have a higher\nprevalence of certain health conditions (e.g., diabetes and\nobesity) that have been associated with disability (4,10).\nMoreover, studies that have focused on disability among\nolder Mexican Americans have typically estimated incident\nor prevalent disability rather than the process of becoming\ndisabled or the outcomes from that process (10). Theoreti-\ncally, the progression toward disability could be affected,\nperhaps even delayed or halted, by multiple biological,\npsychological, and social factors (1,2,11). However, to\ndetermine whether the process of becoming disabled can be\ninfluenced, it is important to first examine how disability\ndevelops. Therefore, the goal of this study is to investigate\nhow disability develops in older Mexican Americans. We\nbuild on the Disablement Process model that we partially\ntested in a previous study (2). The Disablement Process\nmodel posits that impairments (which are abnormalities\nat the physiological, anatomical, or mental level) lead to\nfunctional limitations (limitations in basic physical and\nmental actions), which then lead to disability (difficulty\ndoing everyday activities, problems with activities of daily\nliving [ADLs] or instrumental ADLs [IADLs]).\nIn this study, we will examine this model more thoroughly\nthan has been done in previous research in two ways: by\nincluding not only components of the main pathway to\ndisability, but also a potential outcome from the process--\nhealth-related quality of life (HRQOL); and by the additional\nuse of performance-based measures for the impairment\ncomponent of the Disablement Process model. Impairment\nis an early part of the model and is meant to represent\nphysiological, anatomical, or mental abnormalities (11). We\nfocus on impairment through measuring muscle strength\nwith a Nicholas Manual Muscle Tester. Previous research\non the connection between muscle strength and disability\nindicates that upper and lower extremity muscle strength is\nstrongly related to disability through their effects on mobility\n(12). However, there has been no direct test of the role of\nmuscle strength in the Disablement Process model, nor have\nthe effects of muscle strength on disability been examined\namong older Mexican Americans.\nTherefore, our goal in this research is to begin to evaluate\nthe Disablement Process model by hypothesizing that: (a)\nimpairment (measured by muscle strength) will be positively\nJournal of Gerontology: MEDICAL SCIENCES Copyright 2005 by The Gerontological Society of America\nassociated with functional limitations (measured by lower\nbody mobility); (b) functional limitations will be negatively\nassociated with disability; and (c) disability will be nega-\ntively associated with HRQOL.\nMETHODS\nData Collection Procedures\nThe sample for the current study is a subsample from\nthe Hispanic Established Populations for Epidemiologic\nStudy of the Elderly (EPESE). The Hispanic EPESE is\na population-based study of 3050 noninstitutionalized\nMexican-American individuals aged 65 or older at baseline\nNew Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona). Four waves of data\n01) [for details of sampling frame, please see reference (13)].\nAfter Wave 3 data were collected, we created a list of\nrespondents who were alive at the end of Wave 3 (n \u00bc 1979)\nand who reported having Medicare coverage at either Wave 1\nwere randomly selected to be the sample for a substudy\nfocusing on the link between acculturation, disability, and\ncompleted the interviews. The remaining 179 respondents\nincluded those who refused to participate and those who\ncompleted proxy interviews. We did not include proxy\ninterviews due to the physical nature of some of the measure-\nments in the substudy. The respondents in the substudy were\naged 71 years or older (see descriptive information in Table 1).\nMeasures\nHRQOL is assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study\nSF-36 was designed to be a generic health-status measure,\nand it addresses function in eight domains of health--\nphysical function, role physical (physical health), bodily\npain, general health, vitality, social function, role emotional\n(emotional health), and mental health. The range is from\n0 to 100 on each dimension; higher scores indicate better\nDisability is assessed by ADL and IADL limitations.\nRespondents were asked if they needed help doing seven\nADL tasks taken from a modified version of the Katz\nActivities of Daily Living scale, which include walking\nacross a small room, bathing, grooming, dressing, eating,\ntransferring from bed to chair, and toileting (15). If\nrespondents indicated that they needed help or were unable\nto do a task, then they were scored as having an ADL\ndisability. For the IADL items, respondents were asked if\nthey were able to do 10 activities, based on the Older\nAmerican Resources and Services Instrument (OARS)\nInstrumental Activities of Daily Living scale (16) and the\nRosow\u00adBreslau scale (17). These activities were using\na telephone, driving, shopping, preparing meals, performing\nlight housework, taking medications, handling money, doing\nheavy housework, walking up and down stairs, and walking\nhalf a mile. If respondents applied in the negative, they were\ncoded as having an IADL disability.\nThe final disability variable is hierarchical with three\nlevels. Scoring 0 indicates no ADL or IADL limitation; 1\nindicates any IADL limitation (i.e., needing help with\ninstrumental activities such as shopping, taking medication,\nor using transportation) or a mobility-related ADL limitation\n(i.e., needing help walking across a room), and 2 indicates\na basic ADL limitation (i.e., needing help bathing or\ntoileting).\nFunctional limitation is addressed through lower body\nlimitations, which include assessment of balance and gait by\nusing items from the Performance Oriented Mobility\nAssessment (18). These items include assessments of\nstanding balance, walking speed, and repeated chair stands.\nFirst, standing balance includes side-by-side, semitandem,\ntandem, and full-tandem standing. Respondents who were\nable to hold the first stand for 10 seconds progressed to the\nnext stand and so on until the stands were completed. The\nstanding balance variable was coded from 0 to 4, with\n0 reflecting no standing balance completed and 4 indicating\nfull-tandem standing for the full 10 seconds. Second,\nwalking across a small room (8-foot walk) was timed twice\nto the nearest second, with the faster of the two walks used\nfor scoring purposes. Scores were divided into quartiles from\nthe sample ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 again reflecting walk\nnot completed and 1\u00ad4 indicating quartiles of the walk scores\nwith upper scores being faster times. Finally, scores for the\nrepeated chair stands were estimated to the nearest tenth of\na second among those who were capable of standing one time\nfrom a sitting position with arms folded across their chest.\nThese scores were also divided into quartiles, with 0 reflect-\ning no chair stands completed and 1\u00ad4 reflecting quartiles\nwith higher scores reflecting better times. The total score\nis created from a combination of these measures with\na range of 0\u00ad12, where higher scores indicate better\nTable 1.

Higher scores indicate greater muscle strength.\nThe testing positions and reliability of the procedure have\nbeen tested in older adults. Intraclass correlation coefficient\nFinally, we included four variables that could influence the\ndisablement process: age, sex, financial strain, and household\nstructure. Financial strain is a question that assesses how\nmuch difficulty respondents have in meeting monthly\npayments on bills; 1 indicates a great deal; 2 indicates some;\n3 indicates a little; and 4 indicates none. Finally, household\nstructure is measured through household size, with a range\nof 1\u00ad5 persons. (A few households had .5 people, but we\nincluded these with the 5-person households.)\nStatistical Analyses\nTo examine the Disablement Process model (shown in\nFigure 1), we used structural equation models estimated with\nAMOS 4.01 (Small Waters Corporation, Chicago, IL).\nStructural equation models allow path analysis as depicted\nin the Disablement Process model in Figure 1. Although the\nDisablement Process model shows multiple pathways\ninfluencing disability, the main pathway that we are\nfocusing on in this research is the pathway from impairment\nto functional limitation to disability, and ultimately to\nHRQOL (a ``global outcome''). This type of model has\nbeen used previously (1) and is appropriate for the\nexamination of the patterns of inter-relationships among\ncomponents of the disablement process (2). Also, structural\nequation models are useful for estimating factors, or latent\nconstructs.\nFigure 2 shows the model that we estimated. We examine\nimpairment through five measures of muscle strength.\nStructural equation models estimate both measurement com-\nponents and relationships between variables. Thus, Figure 2\n(the estimates will be discussed below in the Results section)\nshows that we are estimating: (a) the associations of our\ncontrol variables with impairment, functional limitations, and\ndisability; (b) the associations between impairment and\nfunctional limitations and between functional limitations\nand disability; and (c) the association between disability and\nRESULTS\nTable 1 includes the descriptive statistics for the sample.\nThe average age of respondents in the sample is approxi-\nmately 78 years, and the majority are female. The average\nhousehold size is slightly above 2, and the mean financial\nstrain falls between ``some'' problems meeting monthly\npayments on bills and ``a little.'' Focusing on the disablement\nprocess variables, we found that the sample appears to be\nrelatively nondisabled, with most of the sample falling into\nthe non-ADL or non-IADL disabled or IADL disabled and/or\nmobility ADL disabled only. Also, the sample averages\naround 7 on the performance-based lower body assessment\n(12 is the highest score), indicating a medium level of\nfunctioning.\nTable 2 and Figure 2 show the results from the evaluation\nof the Disablement Process model. First, as expected, the\nmain pathway is supported by the structural equation model.\nImpairment, as measured by the five measures of muscle\nFigure 1. The disablement process [Adapted from Verbrugge and Jette, 1994].\nstrength, is strongly associated with functional limitations.\nThose respondents with greater muscle strength have higher\nlower body functioning (b \u00bc .29), whereas those with better\nlower body functioning have less disability (b \u00bc \u00c0.53). In\naddition, disability is strongly related to HRQOL. Respond-\nents with more disability have lower mental health and\nrespectively).\nFocusing briefly on the control variables, we found that\nhousehold structure had no significant associations with any\ncomponents of the Disablement Process model. However,\nage, sex, and financial strain were related to certain compo-\nnents. Being older was associated with decreased muscle\nstrength, decreased lower body functioning, and increased\ndisability. Being female was related to decreased muscle\nstrength and increased disability, which was expected, but\nfemale sex was counterintuitively associated with increased\nlower body functioning. When we conducted an exploratory\nanalysis to examine why this was the case, the results sug-\ngested that, when accounting for muscle strength in the\nmodel, being female was no longer associated with disability\nand was associated with better lower body functioning\n(results not shown). Finally, having less financial strain was\nassociated with better muscle strength, better lower body\nfunctioning, and less disability.\nDISCUSSION\nWith increasing numbers of aging minorities, especially\na quickly growing group such as older Mexican Americans,\ntwo lines of investigation that are important to the delivery\nof services for older adults are the understanding how\ndisability develops and how disability influences other\nhealth outcomes like HRQOL. Our goal in this research was\nto address the Disablement Process model with the inclusion\nof HRQOL as an outcome and through the inclusion of\nmuscle strength to measure impairment. The model that we\ntested was supported by the data [the model fit was\nreasonable, with the Normed Fit Index and Comparative\nFit Index . .95 and the Root Mean Square Error of\nindicating preliminary support for our hypotheses. The\nDisablement Process model, which has received support for\nnon-Hispanic White samples, also appears to hold true for\nolder Mexican Americans. [0]Furthermore, muscle strength\nplays a similarly important role in the disablement process\nof both non-Hispanic Whites and older Mexican Americans.\nIncluding the measurement of muscle strength as part of\nthe Disablement Process model is a contribution to disability\nresearch. Investigation into the effects of muscle strength on\ndisability and into the process of becoming disabled among\nolder adults has been lacking in population research. With\nmore information on how muscle strength affects disability\nin late life, exercise and strength-training interventions can\nbe designed to help older adults retain their functional\nindependence. It is also possible that a threshold for strength\ncould be developed to target older individuals who are at\ngreatest risk of becoming disabled (23).\nAnother contribution of this research is the connection of\nFigure 2.

For mental and physical SF-36, higher scores indicate\nhigher quality of life.\nthe disablement process to quality-of-life outcomes, such as\nHRQOL. Authors of the original article conceptualizing the\ndisablement process argued that research into the disable-\nment process should not stop at disability as the final\noutcome (11). Solely investigating the main pathway to\ndisability is insufficient. It is critical to examine what the\npath to disability influences, including institutionalization,\nmortality, and quality-of-life issues. We attempted in this\nresearch to incorporate one outcome related to quality of life\nin the Disablement Process model. The results of our\ninvestigation suggest that disability is related strongly to\nHRQOL and that the hypothesized model that conceptu-\nalizes the disablement process with HRQOL as an outcome\nis preliminarily supported by the data. Thus, more has been\ndone in this research to fully conceptualize the Disablement\nProcess model than has been done previously.\nAlthough there are important contributions of this\ninvestigation to research on disability, there are two primary\nlimitations that should be discussed. First, the generaliz-\nability of this research to older Mexican Americans is\nlimited. Although the subsample was randomly selected\nfrom 10-year survivors of the original Hispanic EPESE\ncohort, it is not representative of Mexican Americans aged\n70 years or older. Second, the Disablement Process model is\nintended to be examined as a process, and these analyses are\nbased on cross-sectional data, which are useful in establish-\ning relationships between variables. Support for the model\nis somewhat limited until more data points can be used,\nalthough, on the basis of previous research (2), we do not\nexpect the relationships to change.\nConclusion\nMuscle strength is an important addition to expanding the\ninvestigation of the Disablement Process model in older\nMexican Americans. Moreover, examining HRQOL in\nrelation to the process of becoming disabled is one way of\nexpanding the model of the disablement process to\ninvestigate the influences of disability on other aspects of\nlife among older adults. As the proportion of minority older\nadults increases in the United States, research that focuses\non how to keep minority elderly persons functionally\nindependent will be of increasing importance.\n"
