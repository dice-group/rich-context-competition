The categories of `Assigning time',\n`Establishing security and trust' and `Communicating equality' were strategies for arriving at the\ncore category, `Opening up', which was the process that led to creating relationships. Both parties\nhad to contribute to create a relationship; the professional caregiver controlled the process, but\nthe person with dementia permitted the caregiver's overtures and opened up, thus making the\nrelationship possible. Interpersonal relationships are significant to enhancing the well-being of\npersons with dementia.

Since the person with dementia's capacity to create and maintain\nrelationships declines successively due to cognitive deficits, the caregiver's confirmation of\nthe person with dementia is critical to his or her sense of being somebody \u00ad a person\n& Hadjistavropoulos, 2004). Confirmation from others is the foundation for developing a\nrelationship with the person with dementia (Harman & Clare, 2006; Malloy &\nPersons with dementia want relationships with other people and are capable of having\nthem, even when the dementia is advanced, but others must take the initiative to create and\nmaintain the relationship (Penrod et al., 2007). Hellstro\nhow a married couple maintain couplehood, despite the wife's far advanced dementia. Both\nparties describe the relationship as entirely possible and meaningful, but it required initiative\non the part of the husband to maintain it. Another study showed that relationships are\nmeaningful to persons with severe dementia. When asked what they enjoyed, they mentioned\nactivities such as coffee `klatches', a pastime that involves interaction and often a\nrelationship with another person (Cahill & Diaz-Ponce, 2011).\nNorbergh, Helin, Dahl, Hellze\n\u00b4 n, & Asplund (2006) studied professional caregivers'\nattitudes towards persons with dementia and identified negative attitudes towards persons\nwith communication deficits and behavioural disorders as relational barriers. In these cases,\nprofessional caregivers often avoided creating a relationship beyond interaction in the course\nof basic nursing. McCallion, Toseland, Lacey, & Banks (1999) have shown, however, that\nprofessional caregivers can be trained to interact more with persons with moderate to severe\ndementia in order to facilitate relationships.\nRelationship-centred care, considered an evolution of person-centred care, further\nreinforces the importance of the relationship between the person who receives care and\nthe caregiver (Davies & Nolan, 2008; Nolan, Ryan, Enderby, & Reid, 2002; Ryan, Nolan,\nReid & Enderby, 2008). Davies & Nolan (2008) argue that in order to be person-centred\ndementia care must be relationship-centred. Existing research emphasizes the importance of\nrelationships (Nolan, Davies, Brown, Keady, & Nolan, 2004; Ryan, Nolan, Reid, &\nEnderby, 2008). There is a need, however, to increase understanding of how relationships\nare established with persons with dementia, particularly with persons in more advanced\nstages of dementia. The aim of this study is therefore to increase understanding of how\nrelationships can be created with persons with moderate to severe dementia.\nMethod\nContext\nThe study was carried out at six residential units for persons with dementia in southern\nSweden where a method called `Relational Time' (RT) is used. RT is defined here as: A time\nof interaction with the person with dementia (one-to-one). A way of activating/stimulating the\nperson with dementia that begins with the unique person's interests, wishes and capacity and\nwhere focus is on the person. In this study, RT was used as an instrument to enable study\nof how relationships with persons with dementia are created. The aim of RT is to\nenhance activation and encourage interaction with the person with dementia. RT is\nincluded in the day-to-day schedule so that all residents in the dementia unit will benefit\nfrom the method, which must be provided with continuity, at least once a week, by a\ncaregiver who knows the person well. RT is documented in order to record activities that\npersons with dementia are prevented by forgetfulness from relating themselves. Other\nprofessional caregivers and relatives can also refer to the documentation and give each\nother suggestions for suitable activities/occupations that promote interaction with the\nProcedure\nHow a relationship is created may be seen as a social process, which was studied here on the\nbasis of Charmaz's (2006) Constructivist Grounded Theory (GT). For this study, RT\nsessions (n \u00bc 24) were videotaped for 20\u00c061 minutes and the person with dementia was\ninterviewed immediately after the taping. The professional caregiver was interviewed later.\nIn order to retain what Charmaz (2006) calls the `natural context', RT took place in the\nusual, for the person with dementia, familiar environment and an undisturbed place with\nonly the caregiver and the person with dementia present. The interviews with the person with\ndementia lasted 2\u00c013 minutes and were conducted in the setting where the RT session had\ntaken place. The questions were brief here and now questions with a concrete connection\nto the activity that had taken place. The persons with dementia were videotaped and\ninterviewed on three occasions, except for two persons, one of whom was\ninterviewed once and the other twice. All but one of the professional caregivers involved\nin the RT sessions were interviewed once. Prior to the interview, the interviewer (IH) viewed\nthe videotape in which the professional caregiver was involved. The interviews with\ncaregivers lasted 19\u00c031 minutes and consisted of open-ended questions (Polit, Beck, &\nHungler, 2001). When an interview triggered new questions, these were asked of the\nnext respondent in accordance with the method (Charmaz, 2006; Glaser & Strauss,\n1967;). The interviews were transcribed verbatim and the video-recordings were written\nout in the form of field notes, comparable to the notes taken by a participant observer\nParticipants\nThe dementia nurse or the division manager contacted potential participants. Nine\npersons with dementia participated in the study, eight women and one man, ranging\nin age from 75 to 97. They had been residents of the unit for three months to seven\nyears. All had a diagnosis of some type of dementia. The stage of dementia was\nestablished according to the Functional Assessment Staging Test (FAST) (Reisberg,\n1988), wherein the stage of dementia was assessed on a scale of 1\u00c07, where a higher\nfigure denotes lower functional capacity. The participants' scores on the FAST scale\n7b \u00bc n1). The professional caregivers, all women, had been providing care to persons\nEthical considerations\nRegional Ethical Review Board (reg.no.2010/30-31) reviewed the study from an ethics\nstandpoint. Before the study commenced, everyone involved was informed in writing and\norally about the aim of the study, that participation was voluntary and that confidentiality\nwould be maintained. Thereafter, oral information was provided on an ongoing basis before\neach study occasion. Relatives gave oral consent to ask the person with dementia whether\nthey were willing to participate in videotaping of RT and to be interviewed. The persons with\ndementia gave oral consent to participating before every videotaping session, since due to\nmemory deficits, consent given on one occasion cannot be deemed to apply to a later\noccasion (Hellstro\n\u00a8 m, Nolan, Nordenfelt, & Lundh, 2007). The professional caregivers also\ngave oral consent to the videotaping and individual interviews.\nData analysis\nInitial analysis commenced as data were collected. The interviews and videotapes were\nsubject to constant comparison (Charmaz, 2006; Glaser & Strauss, 1967). All material\nwas coded based on Charmaz's (2006) recommended structure as follows: a) initial coding\nin which text sequences were given substantive code names; b) focused or selective coding in\nwhich substantive codes were grouped and given more abstract category names (`theoretical\ncoding'); and c) identification of relationships between categories and sub-categories in\ntheoretical integration (Charmaz, 2006). The core category, `Opening up', which explains\nthe process, emerged during theoretical coding.\nResults\nThe `Opening up' process was necessary to establish the relationship with the person with\ndementia. The strategies for reaching the core category, `Opening up', are the categories of\n`Assigning time',`Establishing security and trust' and `Communicating equality', which are\nall interrelated. The process took place when the person with dementia and the caregiver met\nfor a `Relational Time' session (RT). Both parties' participation was necessary to establish\nthe relationship, but the caregiver had the greatest responsibility and guided the process. The\ncontribution of the person with dementia was to be open to and permit the caregiver's\novertures. How the caregiver controlled the process determined whether the person\nopened up to the caregiver's overtures.\nAssigning time\nOne strategy used was `Assigning time', which the caregivers believed was a way to pay\nattention to the person with dementia. The person was assigned time by the caregiver, but\nalso indirectly by the organization.\nCaregiver (CG): . . . we used to do it [RT] when we had extra time. But now we make it [RT] a first\npriority . . . and that the other comes . . . it's more allowed. And it's been decided by the\nmanagement and the bosses that this is a priority . . ..\n`Assigning time' was clearly signalled to the person with dementia through the caregiver's\nexpress statement: This is your time now. No signs that the caregivers were stressed or\nexpressed lack of time could be observed in any of the RT sequences. It was important,\naccording to the caregivers, that time was set aside for RT in the day-to-day schedule: ` . . . if\nyou've set the time aside . . . you listen, you know . . . you are there.' The persons with\ndementia perceived that caregivers were genuinely relaxed and focused on them during\nRT, for which they expressed appreciation.\nInterviewer (I): . . . and those times are worthwhile?\nPerson with dementia (PWD): Yes, they are worthwhile [conviction in the tone of voice], they\nare. She is so, she is so calm . . . otherwise she is run off her feet, but when she is here\nthen . . . [laughs].\nIt seemed, despite assurances from caregivers that time had been assigned for them, that\nthe persons with dementia still felt unsure that caregivers truly had time for RT.\nVideo sequence (VS): In the midst of an ongoing activity, the person suddenly asks: `Do you\nreally have time for this?' And then answers her own question: `No, you don't have much time,\ndo you?' The caregiver chuckles and says that she'll try to manage, since she knows the person\nenjoys it. The person with dementia remarks that this is good, and then starts telling her story to\nthe caregiver again, who listens intently.\nThe persons with dementia sought to confirm whether there was really time for RT, which\ncould be interpreted as arising from fear of losing out on the session. There may have been a\nneed to check whether there was any point to opening up to a relationship that might quickly\nbe broken off again. In the interviews, the persons with dementia expressed that there were a\nlot of people who had to share the caregiver's attention.\nFeelings of significance\n`Feelings of significance' was a dimension of `assigning time'. The persons with dementia\ninterpreted and expressed verbally that they felt like someone important when time was\nassigned to them. Incidental chat while the caregiver performed other tasks was not of the\nsame quality as the one-to-one sessions.\nI: . . . these sessions with a caregiver, you think, . . . are?\nPWD: Oh, it's so nice [emphasis] because . . . they don't have time, they usually don't have time,\nit's only when we eat and they are there and say a few words . . . when they come in and . . . make\nthe bed and so forth . . . No, I'm not complaining about them, I'm not.\nI: It was interesting what you said about how when they are doing something and talking at the\nsame time, that's not really the same thing, is it?\nPWD: No, it isn't . . . like when you sitting there just the two of you . . . that's different . . . oh,\nyes . . .\nThe person with dementia was interpreted to have `Feelings of significance' when the\ncaregiver truly became intimate and personal. This lent a feeling of deep fellowship, a feeling\nthat was compared to earlier friendships:\nPWD: There's something that makes it fun, that it's only one person, I think.\nI: What is so good about it when there is just the two of you, do you think, when you are with\none member of staff like that?\nPWD: It is a little more personal somehow, don't you think? Yes, I think it is. I think it's almost\nas if we had gone to school together, so that, it comes from so deep inside.\nI: Do you mean it's almost like when you had friends at school?\nPWD: [becomes obviously happy about my suggestion] Yes, that's what I mean, really close like\nthat. Oh yes, they are really, truly love partners here [laughs].\nIn the interviews, the persons with dementia expressed that the most important thing was\nthe caregiver's presence and attention during RT, not that anything was achieved.\nEstablishing security and trust\nThe category `Establishing security and trust' involved the caregiver's approaching the\nperson in a non-threatening way and taking pains to provide a sense of security and trust\nby constantly adjusting to the person. In some cases, it seemed as if this was done when\ncontact was first made. The caregiver's suggestion to do something together could trigger\nstatements from the person with dementia like: `You're so nice', to which the caregiver\nanswered: `It's great that we can be together like this'. The goal seemed to be to establish\nsecurity and trust, a goal that could be observed sooner or later, but the process was\nsometimes more prolonged. The reason for a varied or more prolonged process was\ninterpreted as serious intellectual deficits in the person with dementia. Conditions that\npromoted the process were when the caregiver demonstrated responsiveness, made time,\nrepeated information and adapted her approach and how she treated the person when she\npicked up signals that the person was annoyed. The task sometimes seemed difficult due to\nthe person's severe deficits, as revealed in the following example:\nVS: The woman sits with her eyes closed and seems unresponsive to the caregiver's overtures.\nOn one occasion, the woman looks up at the caregiver and asks, `cold?' and then closes her\neyes again. The caregiver picks up the subject of `the weather', which she interprets the woman\nto have initiated, and offers to go on a walk with her later that day. The woman looks at\nher again and nods in reply. Hope can be seen in the caregiver's expression that she has got\nthrough to the person, but silence falls again and the woman closes her eyes tightly. The\ncaregiver admires the woman's hair and gently caresses her head. She then begins to ask\nintellectual questions about the woman's life. There is no response. The woman sits in her\nwheelchair, eyes closed, head averted from the caregiver, who continues asking the woman\nquestions in various ways. Only when the caregiver begins to tell the person about an\neveryday activity that had been done does the woman look up and seem to follow the\nnarrative. After a great deal of effort with various topics, the caregiver suggests that the\nwoman might want to lie down and rest for a while, which she agrees to. While the caregiver\nhelps the woman to bed, a dialogue that is both verbal and non-verbal ensues. The woman hugs\nthe caregiver, and the caregiver thanks her. CG: `Are you a little chilly?' PWD: `Yes, I am\nsometimes'. CG: `Well, I will have to share my warmth with you'. The woman agrees. It can\nbe heard in the caregiver's statements when she is chatting with the woman, without receiving\nany verbal answers, that the caregiver nonetheless perceives that she is being answered. One\nsuddenly hears the woman say, in a clear voice: `It's such a pleasure every time you come!' The\ncaregiver answers: `It's such a pleasure to be here'.\nThe example describes a prolonged process. Under certain circumstances, the person with\ndementia expressed withdrawal from the caregiver, when the caregiver asked intellectual\nquestions, for example. The caregiver was, however, responsive to the expressions and\nchanged her strategy, which was interpreted as leading to the establishment of security\nand trust. After RT, the person with dementia was asked how it felt, whereupon she\nanswered with conviction: `It feels lovely!'\nApproaching\n`Approaching' was a dimension of `Establishing security and trust', which involved the\ncaregivers first observing the person to determine whether the time was right to approach\nor make contact. The categories `Creating an inviting environment' and ``Sense of self-\ndetermination' were significant to approaching the person.\nAccording to the caregivers, one cannot ignore that there are two parties involved in the\napproach, but they still felt that the caregiver was mainly responsible for ensuring that the\napproach was a positive experience. Caregivers emphasized the importance of personal\ncommitment to RT, but expressed the opinion that not all caregivers are committed. The\nsituation could feel uncomfortable for some people, which was thought to depend on the\ncaregivers' capacity and willingness to approach persons with dementia. Caregivers\ninterpreted honesty and sincerity as prerequisites to approaching persons with dementia.\nCG: . . . I'm sure some people think this is hard, the RT . . . Not everyone is cut out\nto . . . neither . . . oh, how should I put it . . . talk or give . . . people are very different. And it has\nto be really hard for them . . . After all, it's . . . maybe a little hard for, and . . . . . . you have to let\ngo . . . and you have to open up too. Even. . . if a person like them [person with dementia] feels\nlike . . . go out and go for a walk . . . or whatever . . . you feel, well . . . vibes if you don't think it's\nfun. So not everyone can do it, I don't think so.\nThe person with dementia also described the approach as a privilege not all caregivers\nwere granted.\nI: But you can talk to the girls?\nPWD: Oh yes, I think so . . .\nI: . . . and that's fun?\nPWD: Sure, as long as they want to talk to you, but a lot of them don't want to.\nCreating an inviting setting. `Creating an inviting setting' had to do with the caregiver's\nefforts to make the setting warmer and more welcoming, something interpreted as significant\nto approaching the person. Drinks and snacks were usually offered, with the drinks served in\npretty glasses. The person might also be offered coffee, fruit or other sweets. Candles were lit\nand the person was sometimes invited to move to a special room decorated in a seashore\ntheme and with an extra heat source.\nVS: `Let's go in here', the caregiver says. `Oh, it's so nice here', the woman exclaims as they enter\nthe room. `Yes, it's lovely', the caregiver agrees. They each take a seat in armchairs placed close\ntogether. The woman meets the caregiver's eyes, giving what is interpreted as a look of\ntenderness and mutual understanding.\nThe person with dementia gave spontaneous verbal expression of liking the room and was\ninterpreted as also giving non-verbal expression of feelings of security and trust in the\ncaregiver by means of, for example, looks of tenderness and mutual understanding.\nSense of self-determination. Instilling a `Sense of self-determination' was part of the\napproach, in which the caregiver considered and showed respect for the person's signs or\nverbal expressions of willingness or unwillingness to participate in RT. CG: ` . . . it's more\nlike: May I come in and bother you a little bit?' The person was asked what they wanted and\ntheir wishes were respected, and although the activity was suggested by the caregiver, the\nsuggestion corresponded to the person's wishes, interests and remaining capacities. When the\ncaregiver asked for the person's permission to disturb them, this was interpreted as helping\nthe person with dementia feel a sense of self-determination. The persons with dementia also\nstated that there were times when they did not want to participate in RT, when for instance\nthey were not feeling well or felt a need to be alone for a while. Even when they were\nunwilling to participate, the perception was that the caregiver respected their wishes.\nI: But do you like it when somebody comes to see you like this?\nPWD: Oh, yes, of course, it's great fun, but . . . you can't be feeling too bad, because it's no fun\nthen . . . If you're feeling well . . . but if you . . . feel bad, it's no fun . . . but that's not fun for\nanybody.\nThere were also RT sequences in which the person expressed a desire to stop an ongoing\nactivity and the caregiver responded immediately, acting in accordance with the person's\nwishes.\nVS: Right in the middle of the activity, the woman wants to stop and go home. The caregiver\nimmediately complies with her wishes and shows by her actions that she intends to stop. One can\nhear the caregiver trying, calmly and quietly, to allay the woman's anxiety while slowly starting\nto wrap up the activity. She does not contradict the woman, but instead offers her dinner which\nthe woman rejects at first. The caregiver quietly comments that it is raining, which leads the\nwoman to remark that the rain makes it hard to go outside. The caregiver turns up the volume\non the CD player. It can be interpreted, based on the woman's expression and that she sings\nalong with the verses, that she likes the music. The caregiver also offers the woman a drink in a\npretty glass and snacks that are on the table. The woman asks where all this came from and the\ncaregiver tells her that her husband brought it. After a few minutes, the woman expresses\ngratitude and looks very contented, sitting there in her armchair.\nIt was interpreted that the caregiver's rapid response to the person's wish to end the\nactivity gave the person a sense of self-determination. This in turn seemed to lead to a\nsense of security and trust, which was interpreted as contributing to the person changing\nher mind about wanting to go home.\nThe persons with dementia sometimes expressed something also interpreted as a form of\nself-determination, which involved yielding decisions to someone else. In the interviews, they\nexpressed that it was good if the caregiver took the initiative and suggested activities, since\nthey could not remember and thus were unable to state interests and wishes. They were\ninterpreted as feeling content, satisfied and secure in yielding decisions to the caregiver. It\nsometimes seemed difficult for the persons with dementia to understand what was being\noffered them. It was therefore interpreted as essential to participation that the caregiver\nsuggested the activity while reminding the person of previous occasions when he or she\nhad been involved in the activity, and that the caregiver prompted the activity.\nVS: The caregiver comes into the room and announces that now they are going to talk about old\nsayings. The caregiver has to repeat the information because the woman does not hear the first\ntime, and she adds words when in the repetition, as one usually does. The woman says that she\ndoesn't know how, but the caregiver encourages her by saying: `Oh my, of course you do, you\ndid a great job last time'. It seems as if the caregiver is referring to the preceding occasion to help\nthe woman understand she has done this before and, in so doing, give her the confidence and\ncourage to agree to the activity. The woman is still hesitant, but the caregiver goes on: `You were\nso good at it and it was so much fun last time'. After the caregiver has arranged seating, lit\ncandles, put on background music and served snacks, she began the activity, which seemed\nimmediately to appeal to the woman.\nThe person expressed non-understanding of what was being offered and was therefore\nhesitant about participating, but when the activity was eventually started, the person showed\nsigns of content.\nCommunicating equality\n`Communicating equality' represents the caregiver's various attempts to communicate to the\nperson with dementia a sense of being an equal. This was interpreted as significant to\nencouraging the person to open up and thus make a relationship possible. To help the\nperson feel like an equal, the caregiver might suggest an activity that involved\ncooperation between the parties. Verbal reinforcement of equality between them, and the\nuse of items with similar exterior attributes were interpreted as conducive to the sense of\nequality.\nVS: The caregiver suggests that they should put on aprons to bake. She then puts on an apron\nbefore tying an apron around the woman's waist, saying that now they are the same. The woman\nand the caregiver observe one another and agree that now they look lovely. Once the cake has,\nwith their combined efforts, been put in the oven and they have cleaned up the mess together, the\nwoman remarks that they are `good girls', to which the caregiver immediately agrees with\nconviction in her tone.\nConditions for `communicating equality' were interpreted as improved when caregivers\nplaced herself very close to the person, at the same level and in a position that made eye\ncontact possible. Caregivers sometimes placed themselves at a slightly lower level. This\nplacement was interpreted as a deliberate strategy by the caregiver that contributed to the\nperson's self-perception as an equal.\nWhen the caregiver paid no notice to the person's deficits, this was interpreted as an\neffective strategy for encouraging the person to feel like an equal. When the person with\ndementia could not manage a task, the caregiver might say: `I couldn't do it either; that was\nhard' or `I didn't understand that either'. The caregiver's uniform was mentioned as an\nexample of something that kept the parties from being entirely equal. CG: `I go in as a\nfriend. I'm wearing a uniform, but still . . . you are. . . a fellow human being'. Although\ncaregivers expressed the view that equality could never be perfect they were interpreted as\nbelieving that it was entirely possible for the person with dementia to feel like an equal.\nFeeling like a contributor\n`Feeling like a contributor' was a dimension of `Communicating equality'. Caregivers\nbelieved that the persons with dementia wanted to participate and that by participating,\nthey perceived themselves as contributors. CG: `They really want to help or want to feel like\nthey are a part of things. So, it's not just about you coming up with something to do. They\nhave to be involved'. The persons with dementia were observed to contribute something,\nsuch as knowledge and life experience, in nearly all RT sequences. They expressed verbally\nand non-verbally what could be interpreted as pride in having been able to contribute. The\npersons with dementia were interpreted as contributing by responding to the caregiver's\nfriendly actions, for instance. An example of this was the woman who had had her own\nnails painted and then, after carefully selecting a nail polish, wanted to paint the caregiver's\nnails.\nExpressing concern for the caregiver was another way to contribute. For the persons with\ndementia, it was interpreted as important to them to reinforce verbal expressions of\nappreciation by, for example, touching or hugging the caregiver.\nVS: The woman gives the caregiver, who is sitting close to her, what is interpreted as a tender\nglance, and asks with a sympathetic tone whether the staff have had a rough day. The caregiver\nanswers that things have been a little quieter today. The woman turns towards the caregiver and\ntries to hug her while saying: `You're not working too hard, are you, darling?' The caregiver\nmoves away a little, so the woman ends up embracing the caregiver's arm. `Oh no', says the\ncaregiver, `we get to rest sometimes too'.\nIn the situation described, however, it can be interpreted that the person's sense of\ncontribution was stymied when the caregiver was not ready just then to accept the hug.\nOpening up\n`Opening up' involved the persons with dementia availability for the caregivers' overtures as\na consequence of `Assigning time', `Establishing security and trust' and `Communicating\nequality'. Differences in degree of `Opening up' were, however, interpreted to exist between\nthe various video sequences, which seemed to depend on how well the caregivers succeeded\nwith their strategies for attaining the intended goal. The person with dementia expressed\nawareness of their inability to remember and hold a conversation, but expressed the view\nthat the one-to-one time (RT) helped them have the courage to try anyway.\nPWD: Oh, I like (one-to-one) better . . . than a lot of them . . . then I don't really want to say\nanything.\nI: These times when you meet one-to-one, how do you feel about those times? How do you feel\nthen?\nPWD: Oh, I get happy, it feels like a relief, and then you get things out that you have inside, you\nhave the courage to tell other people . . . then you get it out . . .\nI: mmm . . . yes, I see . . . And you have the courage to say these things when you are together one-\nto-one?\nPWD: Yes, I do . . . I trust her completely . . .\nI: So, these times are important to you?\nPWD: Very [emphasis] important . . .\nAt the caregiver's prompting, the person often began telling parts of her life story. It\nseemed as if trust in the perceived relationship of equals had the effect that even persons\ninterpreted as having significant language deficits had the courage to talk. There were times\nwhen the narrative was suspended, but this did not seem to worry either party. Calmly and\nquietly, the caregiver, usually interpreted as having good knowledge of the person's life\nstory, suggested a possible continuation of the story. Although her suggestion was not\nalways right, the person with dementia was observed to continue the story after a brief\npause.\nOn one occasion when the person with dementia was worried about being able to manage\na step in an activity, the caregiver encouraged the person to try with the words: CG: `Of\ncourse you can, I'm right here'. The person was interpreted as feeling trust that the caregiver\nwould intervene if necessary and hence had the courage to try the step, and succeeded.\n`Opening up' involved reciprocity, which involved the caregivers in also extending trust\nand becoming more open. Clear interest could often be observed in the persons with\ndementia when caregivers shared something about themselves. PWD: `Yes, and they\nmight talk about their concerns, and I about mine . . . a dialogue, you know . . . '. It was\ninterpreted, however, that professionalism was maintained through the process. The\nperson with dementia expressed the view that the caregiver: ` . . . is very personal without\nbeing nosy . . . it's nice'. The caregivers interpreted this experience of letting go as, for\nthemselves and the person with dementia, a shared experience, which was interpreted as\nreciprocity during the session. I: If I understand you right, you have also felt a sense of calm\nduring this time? CG:`Oh yes. It . . . gives me as much as it gives the person who gets it [RT].\nIt actually does'.\nProminent findings\nThe caregivers created relationships with persons with dementia by initiating and controlling\nthe process. To make the person with dementia receptive to the caregiver's overtures, the\ncaregiver first demonstrated that they had time for the person (assigning time), which gave\nthe person a feeling of significance. It was also important that the caregiver established a\nsense of security and trust in the person with dementia. The approach to the person was\nimportant in making this perception possible. To facilitate the approach, an inviting setting\nwas arranged and efforts were made to help the person feel a sense of self-determination,\nincluding that found in wanting and being permitted to yield decisions. Efforts were also\nmade so that persons with dementia would perceive themselves as equals; that the persons\nfelt they were contributing and allowed to contribute was an important aspect here. These\nstrategies led to the person with dementia to open up, which was the prerequisite for creating\nthe relationship.\nDiscussion\nDiscussion of results\nThe results showed how relationships with persons with dementia were created in the context\nof the Relational Time method. At first glance, the professional caregiver's assignment of\ntime and guidance of the process in order to create a relationship with the person may be\nunderstood as an example of what Kitwood (1997) and Brooker (2007) describe as malignant\nsocial psychology, which involves exerting power over a person in a position of dependency.\nProviding care to persons with dementia is complex and it requires caregivers to be aware of\nthe risks inherent in the position of power they automatically occupy in relation to the\nperson who is dependent upon care (Kitwood, 1997). The caregivers' overtures and\nguidance of the process were probably necessary due to the functional deficits of the\npersons with dementia. Brooker (2007), however, argues that the person's dependency on\nthe caregiver's overtures, help and support requires constant self-examination by the\ncaregiver: the caregiver must examine and manage the imbalance of power in order to\navoid infantilizing the person.\nThe person's uncertainty as to whether the professional caregiver had time probably did\nnot promote creating a relationship and may be one of the main reasons it sometimes took\nquite some time for a relationship to be established. Davies & Nolan (2008) state that it takes\ntime to establish relationships and time is at a premium in modern, pressurized working\nenvironments (Hall & Kiesners, 2005), but some scholars contend that care outcomes are not\nsolely dependent upon caregiver resources. The professional caregiver's attitudes and\nflexibility also play a role (Cohen-Mansfield & Bester, 2006; Kontos & Naglie, 2007), an\nopinion shared by the caregivers in this study. It was, however, clear that the persons with\ndementia were not unaffected by the constant reminders that time was short, which is\nconsistent with the understanding that lucidity exists despite far advanced dementia\ncaregivers had time for RT may have been, and could be, the greatest barrier to creating\nrelationships in the care setting. The core category of `Opening up' was interpreted as that\nwhich Buber (1958) describes as essential to the relationship. Buber (1958) speaks of the\n`encounter' in which one is open or available for the other, but also discusses the\nvulnerability inherent in opening up to the other, since there is risk of rejection. Rejection\nis probably something that occurs relatively often in the day-to-day care setting, since so\nmany people are in urgent need of the caregivers' attention. Accordingly, assigning time for\nRT was most likely significant to creating the relationship, although the most important\nthing might have been that caregivers showed through body language that they had the time,\nrather than verbally expressing that they had time. These prerequisites are consistent with\nthat which Buber (1958) identifies as fundamental to the human I and Thou encounter, where\nthe deep relationship is established \u00ad the encounter that demands openness, presence,\ncloseness and interest from both parties (Buber, 1958).\nIn the one-to-one RT session with the caregiver, the persons with dementia dared to try,\nfor example, to tell a story even when cognitive capacity was impaired. Occasional errors\nwere overlooked by caregivers, which was probably a strategy for preventing feelings of\nfrustration in the persons with dementia. There was, however, a belief that such overlooking\nof mistakes might have been perceived as exaggerated. Kitwood (1997) and Brooker (2007)\ncategorize exaggerated praise as infantilization. There is reason to believe that exaggerated\ndisregard of things an adult person should normally know about and be capable of might\nhave been perceived as infantilization. Studies have shown that lucidity is often greater than\nwhat might be expected based on the person's deficits (Ericsson, Malmberg, Langworth,\nAccording to this and earlier studies (Malloy & Hadjistavropoulos, 2004; Nolan, Davies,\nBrown, Keady, & Nolan, 2004), a sense of security and trust has proven important to\ncreating a relationship. A prerequisite for establishing security and trust was that the\npersons with dementia had a sense of self-determination, although aspects of the results\nindicated that it may be equally important to be allowed to yield decisions to someone\nelse. The question is whether the sense of self-determination was not more a matter of\nhaving one's wishes respected and not being directly contradicted than of being allowed\nto decide things for oneself. Confirmation is always highly significant in caring for persons\nwith dementia (Edvardsson, Winblad, & Sandman, 2008). The caregiver's efforts with the\nwoman who wanted to go home, for example, probably led to a greater sense of security and\ntrust, which was probably more important than actually being able to act on the original\nexpressed wish to go home. Malloy & Hadjistavropoulos (2004) talk with reference to\nHeidegger, about being `transparent', where the caregiver facilitates, rather than prescribing\nlimits, and provides support when the person's capacities are inadequate or where autonomy\ncould lead to harm or violation of personhood. Self-determination may not always be the\nbest or most secure situation. When caregivers were transparent, the persons with dementia\ndid not notice that it was the caregivers who were `in charge' and therefore felt liberated and\nself-determining, in line with Malloy & Hadjistavropoulos (2004).\nThe professional caregivers and the persons with dementia mentioned that not all\ncaregivers were willing or able to establish relationships. Kitwood (1997) and Brooker\n(2007) posit that caring for persons with dementia demands closeness and warmth and\nthat closeness is essential to creating a relationship (Buber, 1958). Since the relationship\nis considered significant (Davies & Nolan, 2008; McCormack, 2004; Nolan, Davies,\nBrown, Keady, & Nolan, 2004), it may be important to consider the relevance of the\nperception that not all caregivers have the capacity or sensitivity required to establish\nrelationships with persons with dementia. It is likely that professional caregivers may\nfind it difficult to get as close to the person as they need to in order to create a\nrelationship. Basting (2003) argues that dementia itself can be frightening, often due\nto inadequate understanding of the disease. Norbergh, Helin, Dahl, Hellze\n\u00b4 n, & Asplund\n(2006) showed that there was a lack of interaction due to language difficulties. The\npersons with dementia communication deficit may explain why one-to-one situations\nmay feel uncomfortable for caregivers. Kitwood (1997) argues, however, that if\ncaregivers are given the opportunity to process what engenders feelings of discomfort,\nthe approach that is so important to establishing a relationship may be made possible.\nResearch has shown that education and training can improve caregivers' skills at\nproviding care to persons with dementia (Kontos & Naglie, 2007; McCallion,\nToseland, Lacey, & Banks, 1999;), which might also apply to creating relationships.\nExperience working with RT for some time may have helped the caregivers in this\nstudy improve their skills at creating relationships with persons with dementia. The\nfact that capacities believed lost often emerge when a relationship has been\nestablished (Normann, Asplund, Karlsson, Sandman, & Norberg, 2006; Zingmark,\nDandman, & Norberg, 2002) may have been the reason that caregivers, who had\nthought it not worth the effort to try and approach persons with dementia in such a\nway that relationships were established, suddenly discovered that capacities exist that do\nmake it worthwhile. It is conceivable that such a discovery may have changed the\ncaregivers' views of both the person and the dementing illness and thus made them\nmore inclined to prioritize one-to-one interaction, as in RT, which they have learnt by\nexperience facilitates the creation of relationships.\nThere is every reason to believe that the sense of well-being perceived during RT was\nlinked to the relationship that had been created. The person with dementia's deficits,\nhowever, impede the maintenance of the relationship and make it frail and short-lived,\nparticularly when the person has severe dementia (Malloy & Hadjistavropoulos, 2004;\nPenrod et al., 2007). For this reason, it is likely that the deep relationship that engenders\nwell-being must be recreated in every encounter with the person with dementia. For the\npersons with dementia who participated in this study to feel episodes of well-being, it was\nprobably important that they were given opportunities for the one-to-one interaction offered\nin RT. There is, however, always risk that a method like RT, introduced to improve care,\nwill be performed mechanically and not fulfil the original aim of creating a relationship. This\nmechanization would hopefully be revealed when the positive effect of the `encounter'\n(Buber, 1958) \u00ad the relationship \u00ad fails to materialize and thus also the feelings of well-being\nexpressed by both parties in the study.\nDiscussion of method\nThe investigator (IE) was in the field intermittently for two months to perform repeated\nvideotapings and interviews with persons with dementia. It was important to interview the\npersons with dementia on repeated occasions because they were generally fatigued after the\nvideotaping and unable to maintain focus and concentration on what they had been involved\nin, that is, the purpose of the interview. Charmaz (2006) argues that it is important to have a\nprolonged engagement in the field (Creswell, 2007) and to perform repeated interviews to\nobtain in-depth information (Charmaz, 2006). The interviews were held immediately after\nRT in order to capture the person's perceptions of the session. Experiences that trigger\npositive or negative feelings may remain in the person's consciousness for some time after\nthe experience (Engstro\n\u00a8 m, Marmsta\n\u00b0 l Hammar, Williams, & Go\nwas risk that the information might be insufficient to achieve saturation in the material\n(Charmaz, 2006) because the interviews were brief. This was compensated for by means\nof the repeated interviews. The briefer interviews often yielded more concentrated\ninformation than the longer interviews, in which the person with dementia's concentration\non the subject successively waned.\nBoth authors (IE and IH) who conducted the interviews have experience of working with,\nand interviewing persons with dementia and caregivers. Various stages of dementia and the\ndifficulties several persons with dementia had expressing themselves clearly in words required\nfollow-up questions to verify what the person was perceived to be saying both verbally and\nnon-verbally, since the risk of over-interpretation is always present. The capacity to express\noneself in words may be lost while the capacity to understand may be intact (Hughes, 2008),\nwhich makes it possible to verify the information given (Ericsson, Aronsson, Cedersund,\nHugoson, Jonsson, & Wa\n\u00a8 rnberg Gerdin, 2009). There was also risk of posing leading\nquestions, but it was significant that the questions were direct, short and concrete due to\nthe diminished capacity for abstract thinking common in dementia (Allan & Killick, 2008).\nThe investigators (IE, IH) had a preunderstanding that could increase the risk of over-\ninterpretation. The co-author (SK) did not participate in data collection and had no previous\nexperience in the field of study and thus acted as a peer debriefer (Creswell, 2007), which is\nconsidered to reduce the risk of over-interpretation. Pre-understanding is, however, not only\na drawback, as it also facilitates notice and identification of important information that\nmight otherwise have been missed (Charmaz, 2006). The interviews with caregivers were\nconducted by co-author IH, who had no experience of RT, which was thought to reduce the\nrisk of experience-based influence on how questions were asked and that respondents might\ngive the answers they believed were expected (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). Triangulation\n(Charmaz, 2006; Creswell, 2007) was applied to further enhance reliability through the\ninvolvement of all authors in the analysis, the use of multiple sources of data and several\ninterviewers.\nConclusion\nCaregivers can establish relationships with persons with moderate to severe dementia.\nThe most important factors in creating relationships are: that the caregiver takes the\ninitiative and demonstrates that time is available; that the person with dementia feels a sense\nof security and trust and feels like an equal, and thus dares to open up to a relationship. In a\nsimple and straightforward way, the results of this study give caregivers an understanding of\nthe factors that influence how relationships with persons with dementia are established. It is\nlikely that creating relationships may also be a path to understanding the practical\napplication of person-centred care. When a relationship has been established with the\nperson with dementia, caregivers are given the response so sorely needed to feel that their\nwork is meaningful, while persons with dementia feel a sense of well-being through the\nconfirmation of their personhood.\nGreater awareness of the significance of relationships in caring for persons with dementia\nis needed in organizations and among caregivers. Understanding needs to be increased that\nsmall measures, such as the RT method, that do not require significant resources can open\npaths to attaining the goal of creating relationships with persons with dementia to enhance\ntheir sense of well-being.\nReferences\nAdams, T.
