    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe aim of this study was to describe how young women living with self-identified anorexia narrate about their lives by\nblogging. Thirteen Swedish blogs were chosen and analyzed by means of qualitative content analysis. The results described\nfalling ill, the illness itself, and the path to recovery. Low self-esteem, depressed state of mind, and self-destructive behavior\nwere typical signs at the start of the illness. The women's lives were characterized by a need for controlling their body by\ntormenting it and by the illness demanding all their concentration and energy. The women suffered from the feeling of being\na disappointment to their family members. The illness was like an enemy that had to be defeated with the help of family\nmembers, health care professionals, and by means of therapy. A turning point occurred when the women felt at their worst\nor had tired of the illness and could concentrate on something other than their body and the eating disorder. Suffering from\nself-identified anorexia was described as experiencing low self-esteem. The illness took all of the women's time and energy.\nFor a turning point to be reached, the women needed support from family, friends, and health care professionals, including\nthe use of distractions.\n",

Blogging is part of the Internet culture of young Swedish\nwomen. Among females between the ages of 16 and 25, two\nof three actively write or have written a blog, and three of\nfour read other people's blogs (Cole et al., 2013). Blogging is\na way of reaching out and entering into contact with readers\nwho can gain insights into the blogger's life-world (Heilferty,\n2011). Many blogs deal with the experiences of living with\nsome form of ill health. An illness blog is an online expres-\nsion of the narrative of illness, as well as a means for provid-\ning and receiving information, ideas, and emotions between\npersons, united in the story of illness. Blogging can help sick\npersons manage and cope with the uncertainty and identity\nchanges accompanying their illness (Heilferty, 2011).\nWriting blogs provides a means for expressing one's views\nand thoughts, and for providing a picture of one's everyday\nlife: \"as the voice of the author, blogs have the potential to\nclarify previously misunderstood perceptions of treatments,\nthe impact of patient-provider interactions, and of living with\nAccording to Bruns (2008), bloggers can be defined as pro-\ndusagers, as they both produce and use blog texts. A number\nof studies of websites focusing on eating disorders have been\nAnorexia reduces a woman's self-esteem due to her unre-\nalistic perception or denial of her weight, body shape, and\namenorrhea (American Psychiatric Association, 2006).\nCommon causes of anorexia are dysfunctional family rela-\ntionships, slimming, stress, and frustration (Tozzi, Sullivan,\nFear, McKenzie, & Bulik, 2003).

King and Turner\n(2000) reported that nurses are suspicious of and find it diffi-\ncult to understand patients exhibiting anorectic behavior. They\nfound that when nurses are given the opportunity to reflect\nover their care actions, the nurses tend to change their attitude\nand become more understanding of the patient's illness.\nRecovery is achieved when patients receive help bolster-\ning their motivation and working through their emotions\ngenerally (Federici & Kaplan, 2008). Other important factors\nare social support, for example, having a supportive partner,\nreceiving therapy and counseling, and being recognized as\nindividuals with specific needs (Federici & Kaplan, 2008;\nnormalization, structure, and responsibility are aspects con-\ntributing to recovery. Aspects shown to have a negative\ninfluence on recovery are competing and comparing oneself\nwith others in terms of slimness and learning new destructive\nA delay from recovery can be due to a relapse caused by\nambivalence in terms of the will to recover, dissatisfaction\nwith the therapy, or not being adequately prepared for life\nafter therapy. Lack of social support, inability to manage\nemotions, poor self-esteem, and difficulties relating to fam-\nily and friends expecting the patient to become free of the\nillness can also lead to relapse (Federici & Kaplan, 2008;\nTheoretical Framework\nThe life-world perspective makes it possible to gain under-\nstanding of a human being's everyday life by describing and\nanalyzing the world on the basis of human experiences\n(Dahlberg, 2011). Philosopher Husserl highlighted \"life-\nworld\" as a scientific concept. It was developed by Heidegger\nas a \"human being-in-world.\" Merleau-Ponty considered it a\n\"being-to-world\" and incorporated the theory of the lived\nbody, meaning that people have access to the world through\nthe body as a unified whole (Dahlberg, 2011; Toadvine &\nprerequisite for knowledge development is awareness and\nunderstanding of the life-world as the lived world, where we\nseek the meaning and content of life (Dahlberg, 2011). In the\npresent study, a life-world perspective implies a turn toward\nthe lived existence of women with an eating disorder to\nunderstand how they perceive their illness and suffering and\nhow it influences their lives. The life-world is both unique to\neach individual and shared with others. One's own body can\nnever be relinquished and encompasses the person's lived\nexperiences, memories, and impressions. The body is the\nmedium through which we comprehend the world around us\nand which conveys knowledge about the individual person to\nthat world. Illness changes the life-world, as nothing can be\ntaken for granted any more (Dahlberg, 2011). Similar to per-\nson-centered care (PCC), the life-world perspective empha-\nsizes that an ill human being is a subject and not merely a\ndisease (Dahlberg & Segesten, 2010), and that his or her con-\ntext and cultural needs should be taken into account (Ekman\nAccording to Eastham (2011), \"blogs are unsolicited nar-\nratives that offer a naturalistic entr\u00e9e into the illness experi-\nence unconstrained by time\" (p. 353). A blog is a web page\nconsisting of posts that appear in reverse chronological order\nand is ideally updated on a frequent basis (Kozinets,\nBlogs generally offer readers an opportunity to respond,\nprovide author information, and offer links to other sites\nInternet and in the real world have merged. Technology is\nused to communicate, socialize, express, and understand\n(Kozinets et al., 2008). The shift from verbal narrative to writ-\nten language can be regarded as a shift from \"orality to liter-\nacy\" and may be compared with the postmodern \"shift within\nnarratives on blogs can provide important knowledge about\nwhat health and suffering mean. Internet is the platform where\nblogs with narratives can be found, and a defining characteris-\ntic of illness blogs is the blogger's unique \"from-me-to-the-\nblog to be the \"unedited voice of a single person\" (http://blogs.\nlaw.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog).\nPosting narrative blogs is a more symmetric type of shar-\ning, as the traditional power relationship between patient and\nprofessional carer does not exist. Meyrowitz (in Marwick,\n2013) claims that the boundaries between the \"back and front\nregions\" of a narrative are beginning to become blurred in\nline with the development of media use. The back regions\nrepresent that which is private and where you can expose\nyour emotions and problems, whereas the front regions\nembody the presentation of a more controlled behavior.\nBlogs represent a kind of diary where the reader can post\ncomments and the Internet eliminates many of the prerequi-\nsites necessary for the creation of relationships, such as\nknowing who the others are and how to contact them, which\nare key aspects when encountering a person face to face\nthese prerequisites on the Internet can also make certain\nDahlborg Lyckhage et al. 3\ninteractions more difficult as it allows people to alter their\nidentity and be the persons they wish to be (Marwick, 2013).\nLinks to other blogs and comments from readers provide\ncommunication within the cyberspace social community,\nthus turning bloggers into produsagers (Bruns, 2008). How\npeople with self-identified anorexia write about their life on\nblogs has not been studied sufficiently. Only a few studies\nhave been conducted in Sweden despite the fact that many\npeople use the Internet for blogging. Narratives of illness can\nprovide a deeper understanding about thoughts and emotions\nbetween persons, brought together in the story of illness.\nSharing of the blog content provides an opportunity to gain\nknowledge about how persons with eating disorders can\nrelate their illness to their life-world. Therefore, the aim of\nthe present study was to describe how young women living\nwith self-identified anorexia narrate about their lives by\nmeans of blogging.\nMethod\nBlogs, Facebook, and chat rooms are similar in that they\noffer researchers the ability to observe and/or participate in\ntextual conversations. However, they differ in terms of access\nand communication: Some blogs require readers to sign in or\nregister, whereas others may be read simply by clicking the\nprovided link; chat rooms require users to sign in with a user\nname. Blogs are primarily the writings of the blogger,\nalthough a dialogue may develop between the blogger and\nreaders who choose to comment.\nBlogs were selected by searching Google.se for \"anorexia\nblog\" in Swedish (December 6, 2010). Fifty-five blogs per-\ntaining to anorexia nervosa and eating disorders were identi-\nfied. All the 55 blogs were read to gain a general impression\nof the material. After that the blogs who did not meet the\ninclusion criterias were put aside. The criteria for being\nincluded in the study were that the blog had to be written by\na young female aged 12 to 25 years and that the blog must\ndeal exclusively with self-identified anorexia. Thirteen blogs\nmet these criteria. Blogs meeting the inclusion criteria\nthe study, although their entire content, that is, entries before\nand/or after said dates, was included for analysis. In this\nstudy, the analysis object was the individual blogger's con-\ntent. Consequently, the interaction between the blogger and\nher followers, that is, comments and replies between the par-\nties, were excluded from the analysis. All blogs were treated\nconfidentially. In the \"Results\" section, the participants will\nbe termed bloggers.\nAnalysis\nThe narratives were analyzed by means of qualitative content\nanalysis (Graneheim & Lundman, 2004). The analysis process\ncomprised the following four steps: (a) Meaning units in the\ntexts were identified, (b) the meaning units were condensed\nand coded, (c) the codes were brought together and sorted\ninto categories, and (d) themes were developed by interpret-\ning the underlying meanings of the codes and categories. To\noffset the possible bias effects of the researchers'prior under-\nstanding, in the form of theoretical knowledge and personal\nexperience, on the result of the analysis, the researchers were\nacutely aware of the importance of clearly describing the\nsampling procedure, participants, data collection, analysis\nprocess, and their own prior understanding to ensure a high\nlevel of rigor (Graneheim & Lundman, 2004).\nIn practice, three of the researchers (A.G., H.K., and\nJ.T.M.) first read all the 13 selected blog texts to obtain an\noverall understanding of them and highlighted the meaning\nunits corresponding with the study's aim. Subsequently, the\nresearchers condensed the meaning units to a higher level of\nabstraction, coded them, and brought the codes together into\ncategories based on differences and similarities. Finally, they\ndeveloped sub-themes and themes by interpreting the under-\nlying meaning of the categories. The two remaining research-\ners (I.B. and E.D.L.) then validated the results by reviewing\nthe themes and categories to ensure that they corresponded\nwith the contents of the empirical data.\nEthical Reflections\nThe bloggers described self-identified anorexia and shared\ntheir thoughts and reflections on their illness on blogs openly\navailable to anyone wishing to read them. The individual\nposting the blog is responsible for the material published\n(Shih-Ming, Hsiu-Li, Su-Houn, & Hsieh, 2010). Merely\nreading a blog post offers no form of interaction between\nblogger and reader, and the blogger has no ability to deter-\nmine who is reading the blog, although there is always a\ntheoretical possibility to obtain Internet protocol (IP)\naddresses and attempt to back-track to the reader. Interaction\nonly takes place if the blogger and the reader actively engage\nin written or verbal conversation. The lack of interaction of a\nblog per se meets one criterion for defining the blog's public\nnature as laid down by the Swedish Freedom of the Press Act\nstudy were not asked whether they wanted to participate and\nthus had no opportunity to decline. However, the blogs were\ntreated confidentially, and no reference was made to specific\nnames, although it was sometimes possible to identify quota-\ntions. This study was approved by University West's Ethics\nCommittee.\nResults\nThe blogs dealt with being afflicted and living with anorexia,\novercoming it, and reaching a turning point. Many bloggers\ndescribed the blog as a room allowing them to share their life-\nworld and let others accompany them on \"a journey.\" At\ntimes, the blog was used to alleviate anxiety and communicate\nwith family and others, as it was an easier communication\n4 SAGE Open\nchannel and dispensed with the need to meet in person. It\nconstituted a platform for receiving support and inspiration\nfrom others. The bloggers emphasized that they did not want\nothers to be distressed by what they wrote. Although we did\nnot analyze the readers' comments and the bloggers' replies\non the blogs, we noted that the bloggers received both posi-\ntive and negative comments. The former provided support\nand strength, whereas the latter made the bloggers doubt\ntheir strength to continue the struggle.\nBeing Afflicted With Anorexia\nThe causes of anorexia were described as self-defeating\nbehavior, poor self-esteem, and depressed state of mind. A\ncommon characteristic was the feeling of being of less value\nthan others. Compliments and praise were negatively inter-\npreted, and a lack of willingness to become involved in life\nwas a prominent feature. All the bloggers reported placing\nhigh demands on themselves and suffering from constant\nperformance anxiety, expressions of which were never feel-\ning satisfied, constantly setting new goals, and striving for\nperfection. \"If you succeed once, the goals are raised. It\nbecomes a vicious circle. I think that is where some of it\nstarted, unfortunately.\"\nLiving With Anorexia\nLiving with anorexia was described as being one's body,\nbeing in control over and tormenting one's body, exemplified\nby perceptions that the body contained fat that was spilling\nover, or that the body was growing. In some blogs, the\nwomen wrote about their anxiety about gaining weight when\nbody lotion was absorbed by the skin, that biting one's nails\nas well as chewing gum could add unwanted calories. They\ncould experience anxiety and shame over their thin body in\nchanging rooms with mirrors. \"First you want to be thin in\norder to be satisfied with and exhibit yourself. But when you\nget frightfully thin you hide everything under large tunics\nand sweaters. Because then you feel ashamed.\"\nBeing in control provided a sense of security, which was\ndifficult to relinquish due to uncertainty about what would\nhappen. Control was related to the content and amount of\nfood, as well as weight, body, and emotions. Loss of control\nled to anxiety and feelings of chaos. \"I believed that I had\ncontrol over food and the eating disorder but the question is\nwhether that's really the case. It's rather the eating disorder\nthat's in control.\"\nLiving with anorexia implied rapid swings in mood and\nthoughts. They could feel both happy and empty, as well as\nhate and love the illness, all at the same time. Feelings of\nbeing trapped and wanting to escape were described.\nShowing emotions openly was difficult, which made it easier\nto shut out feelings than to try to maintain a facade of\nnormality.\nTormenting oneself was a way of counteracting the pain\ncaused by anorexia, such as forcing oneself to lie in different\npositions to cause pain and create a feeling of worthlessness.\n\"Every person in the whole world deserves to be happy and\nenjoy good health . . . except me. It's an awful feeling.\"\nCutting oneself; concentrating on other things, such as com-\nputer games, blogging, or needlework; vomiting; or perform-\ning extreme physical training relieved the anxiety. \"Nothing\ncures pain as effectively as pain.\"\nAlthough conflicts regarding food intake and treatment\nexisted in the family, being disagreeable led to anxiety, feel-\nings of guilt, and fear of losing one's relatives. It could be\ndifficult to regain trust after many years of lying and broken\npromises. \"I don't even have to make an effort anymore; the\nlies emerge in a steady stream.\"\nA consequence of the illness was lagging behind with\none's school work and not meeting school friends. It also\naffected the blogger's leisure time; when their friends were\nout having a good time, the bloggers were struggling to sur-\nvive, which resulted in difficulty knowing what constitutes\nnormal behavior.\nOvercoming the Anorexia: Treatment and\nRecovery\nIn all blogs, anorexia was described as an enemy, a devil, a\nmonster, or an uninvited guest that one constantly had to\ncombat. The illness could detect weight gain and \"scream\"\nthat you had eaten too much, thereby rendering any sense of\nwell-being impossible. Being rewarded by the anorexia\nmade the struggle more difficult. \"If you go along with the\nanorexia it will give you a hug.\" Fighting the illness was a\nconstant burden requiring all the blogger's strength. It was\ndescribed as an exhausting struggle against the self. Fear of\nwhat would happen after weight gain and doubt that they\nwould accept their new weight made the struggle even more\ndifficult. However, fighting the negative thoughts could\nmake the person feel stronger.\nFeeling supported by family, friends, partners, therapists,\nfellow patients, God, and those who read the blog was impor-\ntant. Mothers were perceived as supportive, but in some\ncases, support from fathers was non-existent. \"I hated Dad\ntoo. He said things that I hated hearing. I was never good\nenough in his eyes and he wasn't satisfied with me. Kept\ncomplaining.\"\nUndergoing treatment involved many demanding discus-\nsions and different therapists provided contradictory advice.\nThe young women found the focus on their weight unpleas-\nant and unnatural, especially as nobody asked them how they\nfelt. They described that as in-patients, they competed to be\nthe best at cheating staff and learnt from other patients how\nto starve themselves. However, descriptions of support\namong patients in various phases of the illness also emerged.\nThe bloggers stated that positive factors for recovery were\nencouragement, peace and quiet during meals, rest and relax-\nation, assistance to achieve structure, normalization of activ-\nities, and learning table manners. One way of regaining a\nnormal body image and getting to know the body again was\nDahlborg Lyckhage et al. 5\nmoving by means of dance. The bloggers wrote that support-\nive dialogues with one and the same therapist were important\nand that evoking the therapist's voice could help them\nremember the different strategies that they had been\ninstructed to utilize to manage a difficult situation. The fact\nthat the therapist did not stop believing in them and never\ngave up hope inspired a sense of security.\nAll the bloggers expressed anxiety about the weighing\nprocedure; both weight gain and weight loss were reasons for\nconcern. Being able to influence how, when, and where the\nweighing would take place was mentioned as being impor-\ntant. Undressing in front of another person could be experi-\nenced as a vulnerable and violating situation. \"I'm aware\nthat my anorexia has deteriorated since I first learnt how\nmuch I weigh . . . Weight is one's worst enemy when suffering\nfrom an eating disorder.\"\nMany of the bloggers lacked knowledge of how to regain\nhealth although they believed that it was possible.\nReaching a Turning Point\nThe turning point could occur at a particular point in time or\nbe a drawn-out process. The change could happen when they\nfelt at their worst or when they were tired of the illness and\nall its negative consequences. One young woman wrote that\nshe was curious about leading a healthy life. \"I'm tired of\nliving a life without life.\"\nThe anorexia turned into something that was no longer\ndesirable. Finding motivation was difficult but important. It\ncould take the form of determination to study, work, have\nchildren, or quite simply to be free, happy, and experience a\nfeeling of fellowship, although trusting oneself and others\nand letting go of the illness were challenging. \"You can't\ntrust yourself but the problem is that's the only thing you do,\nas you refuse to trust others, but if you want to become\nhealthy you have to trust others.\"\nRecovery involved a fear of being abandoned, difficulty\nassuming responsibility, and a wish to continue to be taken\ncare of. Reassuming the responsibility that had been taken\naway during the illness was not easy. Furthermore, they had\nto learn to think about other things to divert their thoughts\nfrom the illness, such as dancing, going for walks, and shop-\nping. Other methods for distraction were using their sense of\nhumor or intoxicating themselves with alcohol. However, the\nanorectic thoughts returned when they were not otherwise\noccupied.\nDiscussion\nThe aim of the present study was to describe how young\nwomen living with self-identified anorexia narrate about\ntheir lives by blogging. Reading the blogs made it possible to\nfollow the young women's emotional ups and downs. Writing\na blog enabled the bloggers to reveal aspects of themselves\nthat they feel unable to disclose in face-to-face encounters\nwith nurses or therapists, where they feel they have to keep\nup appearances and their mask intact. They wrote about\nbeing unable to show their emotions and that their sense of\nloneliness increases despite being surrounded by many sup-\nportive persons. As blogs primarily are writings of the blog-\nger, dialogue is not the primary motivation of the blogger,\nalthough dialogue may develop between the blogger and\nreaders. We believe this may be relevant to take into account\nwhen considering to what extent an eating disorder may be\nexacerbated by various comments. According to Rains\n(2014), anonymity as a blogger may help mitigate the effects\nof a potential exacerbation and facilitate ongoing illness-\nrelated self-disclosure.\nThe bloggers' emotions give rise to confusion, and they\nare uncertain as to what constitutes normal behavior. The\nblogs revealed that they want to be seen as the person they\nare and not for their illness. A study of in-patients with\nanorexia demonstrated that treatment improves their self-\nesteem (Karpowicz, Skarsater, & Nevonen, 2009).\nConsequently, enhanced self-esteem in women with anorexia\nis crucial for recovery. Telling stories is a human activity, but\nillness can be seen as a disruption of the story for both the\none who is ill and for the caregiver (Frank, 1995). PCC\nmeans a shift away from a model in which the patient is the\npassive target of a medical intervention to a more contractual\narrangement involving the patient as an active participant in\nhis care and the decision-making process (Ekman et al.,\nTheir struggle with their bodies and emotions during the\nvarious phases became clear. The emotions drained so much\nenergy that it is difficult for them to be present in the here\nand now. The anorexia constitutes a changed and in many\nways bizarre life-world, where they are trapped in a body\nfighting against the own self, a struggle demanding all the\nwomen's time and energy. Their life-world is closely related\nto their bodies; they encounter life through their bodies\n(Young, 2003), and at the hospital, they must confront the\nsick body. An important part of the treatment is weighing.\nUndressing in front of a nurse can give rise to anxiety and\nfeelings of being violated, both when they have gained and\nlost weight.\nThe narratives made it clear that the young women feel an\nexistential break in relation to self. The anorexia breaks the\ntrajectory of life and creates a fracture in their lived bodies.\nIn the blogs, destructive behaviors were described as a way\nof alleviating the mental pain, which is in line with previous\ninitial phase, the treatment increases the patient's stress and\ncan trigger strong emotions, which represent a challenge to\nthe psychiatric nurse who can sometimes be perceived as\nheartless and frustrated (Federici & Kaplan, 2008). Seeing\nthe self-harm, the scars caused by knife wounds, and the thin\nbodies created by the young women and their friend and foe,\nanorexia can be distressing for the nurse (Snell, Crowe, &\nJordan, 2010). A process of bodily breakdown can also cause\n6 SAGE Open\nanxiety, fear, and disgust in health care professionals. Both\nKristevian concept of abjection to describe the body when it\nis in a state of disruption and decay that threatens its physical\nboundaries.\nThe lives of the women encompass both endurance and\nuncertainty. Sometimes, they feel abandoned, both by the ill-\nness and by their partners, friends, and families. It was evi-\ndent from the blogs that the illness puts a strain on these\ndifferent relationships. Similar to our findings, studies have\nindicated that individuals, including relatives, can distance\nthemselves from the anorectic person (Button & Warren,\nfriends, partners, care staff, psychiatric nurses, fellow\npatients, and others constitute a significant source of support,\nwhich corresponds with other studies (Federici & Kaplan,\nery is development of the therapeutic relationship, which\namong other things can be achieved by the psychiatric nurse\nsharing knowledge, for example, by providing the patient\nwith information about anorexia and its consequences (van\nOmmen et al., 2009). Knowledge about what happens to the\nbody during the illness can reduce the patient's inner resis-\ntance to treatment (Snell et al., 2010).\nSystematic use of blogs in therapeutic encounters with\nthese young women can be a means of strengthening them in\ntheir recovery and overcoming their guarded attitude about\ntheir illness. Listening to the patient's narrative is one of the\ncornerstones of PCC (Ekman et al., 2011). Blogging can\nserve as an alternative to personal talks, as many of these\nyoung women have difficulty talking about their emotions. A\nstudy by Pettersen, Thune-Larsen, Wynn, and Rosenvinge\n(2013) revealed important challenges in terms of exploring\nidentity, relearning eating, and developing social skills as\nwell as coping with grief, which we believe can be achieved\nby means of systematic work with blogs. The blog enables\nthe nurse to understand that the women need to be able to cry\nand make their vulnerability visible, as well as understand\nthe women's important need to be strong and brave despite\nfeeling powerless in relation to the illness destroying their\nbody.\nHaving the opportunity to state their wishes regarding\nhow the weighing should be performed contributes to the\nyoung women feeling involved and makes it easier for them\nto endure. Other aspects of the treatment described as posi-\ntive in the blogs were relaxation, rest, and tranquility.\nThe young women feel that they are left with too much\nresponsibility due to their choice to start eating. This can be\nunderstood in the light of the theories of being and nothing-\nness by existential philosophers such as Sartre and Merleau-\nPonty (Meyers, 2008). The concept of liminality has been\nused to designate a process (Little, Jordens, Paul,\nMontgomery, & Philipson, 1998) as well as a way of being\nafter becoming ill with a serious disease (Navon & Morag,\n2004). It can also be understood as an ambiguous space\nbetween being healthy and being sick (Syme, 2011). The\nbloggers narrated how their liminality manifests itself in\neveryday life and how they try to organize a self that con-\nnects with the liminal space. For these women, being in a\nliminal space is about balancing demands, both from the ill-\nness itself and from those around them. In different daily life\nsituations, they adjust their self-image and stretch their limits\nby means of forbidden thoughts, lies, and self-harm. Previous\nresearch has demonstrated that a person with anorexia makes\na pact with the illness, which can be called a friend and a foe,\nthus allowing it to gain full control over the person's life and\nwas also described in the blogs in the present study.\nThe young women in our study repeatedly doubted that\nrecovery was possible. Federici and Kaplan (2008) described\nthat the recovery process demands vigilance and persistence.\nNilsson and H\u00e4ggl\u00f6f (2006) found that all persons suffering\nfrom anorexia in their study were able to remember or\ndescribe the turning point that constituted the start of their\nrecovery process. The blogs revealed that motivation is\nimportant for recovery and can involve educating oneself\nand/or becoming pregnant. Talking to parents, friends, and\npartners about one's emotions can also be beneficial. Thus,\nindividuals with anorexia need support to be able to endure\ntheir emotions and learn to cope with and verbalize them.\nPettersen et al. (2013) outlined important challenges in terms\nof exploring one's identity, relearning eating, and developing\nsocial skills as well as coping with grief. The bloggers\ndescribed fear of the future as hindering recovery and that\nthe sense of security provided by the anorexia is alluring.\nAccording to Federici and Kaplan (2008), those who have\nrecovered from anorexia exhibit a realistic view of obstacles,\nwhereas those who have suffered a relapse consider that the\nhard work was behind them and have difficulty envisaging\nobstacles. In our study, a barrier to recovery was the fear of\nbeing abandoned. Pettersen et al. (2013) suggested that the\nconcept of recovery as a linear development of increasing\nwell-being and reduction of symptoms should be questioned.\nThe closer one gets to recovery from an eating disorder, the\nmore challenges emerge at psychological and existential lev-\nels. Consequently, patients in the later stages of recovery\nmay need professional treatment or counseling when the\nimpact of their eating disorder symptoms is reduced. Even if\nthe Internet and blogging do not provide a solution, they\nintroduce new possibilities for leveraging visibility to learn\nfrom and reach out to those who live with an eating disorder\nPractical Implications of This Study\nSystematic use of blogs in therapeutic encounters with these\nyoung women can be a means of strengthening them in their\nrecovery and overcoming their guarded attitude about their\nillness. Blogging can provide an alternative to personal talks,\nas many of these women have difficulties in talking about\nDahlborg Lyckhage et al. 7\ntheir emotions. Reading the blog narrative of a young woman\nwith anorexia nervosa can make it easier for the nurse to pro-\nvide more PCC. However, considering bloggers' frequent\ndesire for anonymity, nurses may be limited to reading ano-\nrectic patients' blogs in general.\nLimitations of the Study\nWhen analyzing blog texts, you can always question the\ntruthfulness of the blogger. A blogger may blur the frontiers\nbetween truth, reality, and fantasy. According to Gavin,\nRodham, and Poyer (2008), blogs are forums that provide\nimportant support for the bloggers. Blogs permit an exchange\nof information, ideas, and emotions, united in the story of an\nSome believe that the blog format, as against, for instance,\nthat of Facebook, reduces the risk of comments that can\nworsen the disease (Eastham, 2011). Others believe that an\nillness blog can have the power to trigger the disease (Norris\net al., 2006). In our study, we excluded the interaction\nbetween the blog posts, the comments from readers, and the\nblogger's replies, so our results cannot contribute to either\nconfirm or refute these claims.\nConclusion\nThe blogs reflect a process from falling ill to the turning\npoint where the will to recover is strong. This process can be\nunderstood as being between illness and health, and the blogs\ndescribed how the young women's lives were transformed\nand how they fought to control the illness. However, they\nwere still unable to change their anorectic behavior and\nremained in liminality. Blogging can be seen as \"resistance\"\nto norms about the female body, and being able to offer such\nresistance requires a certain degree of freedom and self-effi-\ncacy. The ability to write blogs indicates a kind of freedom\nthat can generate a sense of being good enough, thereby lead-\ning to enhanced self-esteem. Blogging can be a way of allow-\ning oneself to be ill, thus eliminating the guilt experienced by\nthe young women in relation to the illness and finding moti-\nvation to recover.\n"
