Some of the important studies, which\nreviewed a balanced growth path or a steady state of the Solow model, assumed the nature of technological progress as\nHicks-neutral rather than Harrod-neutral.

The above contradiction can only be\nresolved if either the level of technology is assumed to be\nconstant over time or the Hicks-neutral assumption of techno-\nlogical progress is replaced with Harrod-neutral assumption.\nhave already showed that Harrod-neutral technological prog-\nress is compatible with stability. Acikgoz and Mert (2014) fur-\nther emphasized the importance of this assumption for\ntime-series econometric analysis. This present study aims to\nemphasize that the nature of technological progress should be\nassumed rather than Harrod-neutral for mathematical models\nof economic growth, which are based on stability.\nThis study is organized as follows. The section \"Main\nProblem\" discusses the main problem of the study. In the\nsection \"Selected Studies in Literature,\" we provide some\nstudies that support our hypothesis. The section \"Conclusion\"\nstates the concluding remarks.\nMain Problem\nThe main problem is the assumption of the nature of techno-\nlogical progress in models of economic growth based on\nlong-term equilibrium. The nature of the technological prog-\nress is usually assumed as Hicks-neutral or Harrod-neutral.\nAccording to Hicks (1963), Hicks-neutral technological\nprogress occurs if the capital\u00adlabor ratio does not change,\nwhile the ratio of factor prices is constant. According to\nHarrod (1948), Harrod-neutral technological progress occurs\nif the capital\u00adoutput ratio does not change, while the mar-\nginal productivity per labor capital stock is constant.\nWe give an example with regard to Solow (1956).\nSolow (1956) gives the following basic equation:\nr t r t\nsF K t L t\nK t\nn\nK t\nL t\n( ) = ( )\n( ) ( )\n\n \n\n( ) -\n( )\n( )\n\u00b7 ,\nwhere r t\n( )\n\u00b7\nis the change in the capital\u00adlabor ratio, K(t) is the\nphysical capital stock, L(t) is labor, s is the saving rate, and n is\nthe constant growth rate of labor. At the steady-state conditions,\nr t\n( )\n\u00b7\nis equal to 0. Then, the following equation can be\nwritten:\nr t\nsF K t L t\nK t\nn\nK t\nL t\n( )\n( ) ( )\n\n \n\n( ) =\n( )\n( )\n,\n1Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey\nCorresponding Author:\nSenay Acikgoz, Department of Econometrics, Faculty of Economic and\nAdministrative Sciences, Gazi University, Ankara, 06500, Turkey.\nEmail: asenay@gazi.edu.tr\nA Short Note on the Fallacy of\nIdentification of Technological Progress in\nModels of Economic Growth\nSenay Acikgoz1 and Merter Mert1\n Keywords\nHicks-neutral, Harrod-neutral, technological progress, growth, stability\n2 SAGE Open\nAs r(t) is the capital\u00adlabor ratio and the output Y t\n( ) is\nF K t L t\n( ) ( )\n\n \n\n, , Equation 2 is rewritten as\nsY t\nL t\nn\nK t\nL t\n( )\n( ) =\n( )\nNote that the Cobb\u00adDouglas production function with\nconstant returns to scale is as follows:\nY t K t L t\n( ) = ( ) ( ) -\n \nwhere  is the elasticity of capital with respect to output.\nIf the level of technology A is imposed on the production\nfunction as Hicks-neutral, then Equation 4 becomes Equation 5:\nY t AK t L t\n( ) = ( ) ( ) -\n \nAt the steady-state conditions, using Equation 5, Equation\n3 is rewritten as Equation 6:\nsAK t L t\nL t\nn\nK t\nL t\n( ) ( )\n( ) =\n( )\n( )\n-\n \nK t\nL t\nsA\nn\n( )\n( ) =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\nEquation 7 gives the capital\u00adlabor ratio at the steady state,\nwhen the nature of technological progress is defined as the\nHicks-neutral. Thus, Equation 8 is written at the steady state\nfor the output\u00adlabor ratio, when the nature of the technologi-\ncal progress is Hicks-neutral.\nY t\nL t\nA\ns\nn\n( )\n( ) =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n-\n\n\n\nProposition 1: If it is assumed that the nature of techno-\nlogical progress is Hicks-neutral, then the level of tech-\nnology should be constant for stability; that is, the level of\ntechnology cannot change over time.\nSimple Proof of Proposition 1:Assume that, for all positive\nvalues of A, which are greater than 1, ceteris paribus, the\nlevel of technology rises from A\nto A\n. Then, according to\nEquation 8 A\ns\nn\nA\ns\nn\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n >\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n. For simplicity,\nkindly assume that s n\n= and  = . .\n5 Then, it is true that\nY t\nL t\nA\nY t\nL t\nA\n( )\n( )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n= >\n( )\n( )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n2 for all positive values of\nA, which are greater than 1. If the level of technology\nrises, for example, 5%, then at the steady state, the\noutput\u00adlabor ratio and the capital\u00adlabor ratio should\ngrow at the same rate. However, since Y t\nL t\nA\n( )\n( )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\nY t\nL t\nA\n( )\n( )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n2, the output\u00adlabor ratio grows faster than\nthe level of technology; that is, steady-state conditions are\nnot established. Better yet, note that Equation 5 is rewrit-\nten as g g g g g\n- = + -\n( )\n , where g is the growth\nrate of the relevant variables. It is obvious that if and only\nif the growth rate of technology gA\n( ) is equal to 0, then\nthe steady-state conditions are established; that is,\ng g g g g\n- = - = = 0.\nIndeed, Solow (1956) confirms the proposition stated\nabove, by extending his model with the neutral technological\nchange. He uses the following production function:\nY t A t F K L\n( ) = ( ) ( )\nwhere technology grows at a constant rate A t egt\n( ) =\n\n\n\n.\nImportantly, Solow (1956) makes a solution for the long run\nand shows that the \"capital-labor ratio never reach an equi-\nlibrium but grows forever\" (p. 85). In other words, if the\nlevel of technology changes over time, then the economy can\nnever reach the equilibrium.\nSelected Studies in the Literature\nSome of the selected studies in the literature will be summa-\nrized as per our concerns. First, Uzawa (1961) emphasizes\ncase in which technical inventions are neutral in Hicks's\nsense. However, Uzawa (1961) proves the stability of the\ngrowth equilibrium in a neoclassical growth model with neu-\ntral inventions in Harrod's sense. Inada (1964) incorporates\nneutral technical progress in Harrod's sense into Solow's\nmodel, which assumes no technical progress. Inada (1964)\nshows the existence and relative stability of the balanced\ngrowth when there is Harrod-neutral technical progress.\nInada (1969) similarly emphasizes Harrod-neutrality when\ndefining Arrow type models:\nTechnical progress is endogenous, embodied and neutral in\nHarrod's sense, and is such that labour efficiency is a power\nfunction of cumulative gross investment. We call this the Arrow\ntype of technical progress. He assumed a fixed coefficient\nproduction function and has shown the existence of a steady\ngrowth path. (p. 99)\nMirrlees (1967) demonstrates \"a method of calculating opti-\nmum policies for one-good models with Harrod-neutral techno-\nlogical change\" and \"prove the conditions for existence of an\noptimum policy, and show the general shape of the optimum\ndevelopment of such an economy\" (p. 95). He emphasizes that\n\"once the assumption of Harrod-neutral technological change is\nabandoned, steady growth, in terms of the obvious variables, is\na model with \"a single-good, neo-classical world with capital-\naugmenting and Hicks-neutral technological change\" (p. 343)\nbased on Solow (1959). Akerlof and Nordhaus showed that a\nAcikgoz and Mert 3\nbalanced growth with a technological change may be a\nrazor's edge case. According to them, economists who are\ninterested in long-run growth models might begin to think in\nterms of models showing unbalanced growth with produc-\ntion functions that are not the Cobb\u00adDouglass type.\nBurmeister and Dobell (1970) clearly show that \"unless\ntechnological change is ultimately Harrod-neutral, one-sec-\ntor models generally cannot approach an equilibrium bal-\nanced growth path that is economically meaningful\" (p. 79).\nSteedman (1985) presents \"a number of significant, alter-\nnative sufficient conditions under which Hicks neutral tech-\nnical change is an impossibility (and is not merely empirically\nimplausible)\" (p. 746). Moreover, Steedman concludes, \"It\nmight not be unreasonable to suggest that those who do\nassume it . . . are obliged to show explicitly that assumption\nis compatible with their other assumptions\" (p. 758).\nAccording to Barro (1990), \"The economy is always at a\nposition of steady-state growth\" (p. 106). He uses a production\nfunction specified with Hicks-neutral technological progress but\nwhere technology is constant over time. Thus, Barro (1990) is a\nstudy in which explanations on steady state are compatible with\nthe nature of technological progress. Finally, also Samuelson\nconditions, the economy will converge to a balanced growth path\nin which technical progress is Harrod-neutral.\nmore closely, to clear our argument.\nY H L x H A LA K\n( , , ) ( ) ( ) ,\n= - - + -\n     \n\nwhere HA is the marginal product of research sector, x is the\ninput used by a firm that produces the final output, HY is the\nhuman capital devoted to the final output,  is the unit of\nforgone consumption to create one unit of any type of\ndurable.\nThus, by differentiating,\ng g g g\ng g\nK\nY\n= + +\n( ) + +\n- -\n( ) + + -\n( )\n   \n    \nNote that according to Romer (1990), K Ax\n=  . Thus,\ng g g g\nK A x\n= + +\n , so, g g g g\nK A x\n- - = . Therefore,\nEquation 11 is written as\ng g g g\ng g g g\nK K A x\nY\n= + +\n( ) + +\n- -\n( ) + + -\n( ) - -\n( )\n   \n   \nAs population and human capital devoted to the final out-\ncan write Equation 13 as\ng g g\ng g g\nK A x\n= +\n( ) + - -\n( ) +\n+ -\n( ) - -\n( )\n   \n \nAs along the balanced growth path, x is constant (Romer,\n= 0. Besides, along the balanced growth path, the\nratio of K to A should also be constant (Romer, 1990), then\nFinally rearranging Equation 13, we can write Equation\ng g\nSince g g g g\nK A x\n= + +\n , so,\ng g\nHence, it is shown that Romer (1990) explains steady\nstate using an approach based on endogenous technological\nprogress. Note that Romer (1990) does not assume technol-\nogy as the type of technical change augmenting all factors in\nthe same way, that is Hicks-neutral.\nHowever, Lucas (1988) is based on a different approach\nwhen explaining neoclassical growth theory. He gives the\nfollowing equation:\nN t c t K t A t K t N t\n( ) ( )+ ( ) = ( ) ( ) ( )\n\u00b7\n-\n \nwhere N t\n( ) is labor, c t\n( ) is the per capita consumption, \nis the elasticity of capital with respect to output. Then, it is\nobvious that Lucas (1988) assumes Hicks-neutral techno-\nlogical progress, and moreover, technology grows over time\nat a rate that equals \u00b5.\nThe right side of Equation 16 shows output, Q. Then, per\ncapita output growth equals\ndQ\ndt Q t\ndN\ndt N t\ndA\ndt A t\ndK\ndt K t\ndN\ndt N t\n( ) -\n( ) =\n( ) +\n( ) -\n( )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .\n.\nAccording to Lucas (1988), at a balanced path, per capita\ncapital and per capita consumption grow at a common rate,\nwhich is equal to Equation 18:\ndK\ndt K t\ndN\ndt N t\n( ) -\n( ) =\n-\n\u00b5\n\nThus, according to Lucas (1988), while per capita capi-\ntal and per capita consumption grow at a common rate,\nwhich is equal to \u00b5\n\n, per capita output grows at a rate of\ndA\ndt A t\n( ) +\n-\n\n\u00b5\n\n.\nRearranging the equation, per capita out-\nput grows at a rate of\ndQ\ndt Q t\ndN\ndt N t\n( ) -\n( ) = +\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n =\n-\n\u00b5\n\n\n\u00b5\n\n4 SAGE Open\nNote that Lucas (1988) says that for the off-steady states,\n\u00b5\n\n1- \"need not hold and capital and output growth rates\nneed not to be equal or constant\" (p. 15). Hence, according to\nhim, \u00b5\n\nis used for the steady state.\nHowever, since\ndQ\ndt Q t\ndN\ndt N t\ndK\ndt K t\ndN\ndt N t\n( ) -\n( ) =\n( ) -\n( ) =\n-\n\n\u00b5\n\n\u00b5,\nthere is not a steady state due to the fact that the level of tech-\nnology is also assumed as a variable (it means that it is the\nlevel of technology over time), and at the balanced path, all the\nvariables should grow at a common rate. As presented within\nProposition 1 in this present study, if the level of technology\ndoes not change over time and if it is assumed constant, then\ndQ\ndt Q t\ndN\ndt N t\ndK\ndt K t\ndN\ndt N t\ndA\ndt A t\n( ) -\n( ) =\n( ) -\n( ) =\n( ) = ,\nso\nthere will be a steady state or a balanced path.\nRecognize that Lucas (1988) assumes the level of tech-\nnology constant, while explaining the relation between\nhuman capital and economic growth; that is, the level of\ntechnology does not change over time.\nVan Zon and Yetkiner (2003) have a similar approach to\nZon and Yetkiner extended the Romer (1990) by including\nenergy consumption of intermediates. They showed that the\nresulting model can generate steady-state growth. They\nexplained how the intermediate sector, by assuming the total-\nfactor productivity of raw capital and energy, takes the form\nof Hicks-neutral technical change. Besides, they assumed that\nthe level of technology changes over time. Furthermore,\naccording to Van Zon and Yetkiner (2003), a proportional\ninstantaneous rate of growth rate of technology can also be\ninterpreted as \"energy augmenting/saving\" technical change,\nwhich at rate equals the \"growth rate of technology/(1 - elas-\nticity of effective capital with respect to raw capital)\" (p. 88).\nRecognize that according to Lucas (1988), per capita capital\nand per capita consumption grow at a common rate, which is\nequal to the \"growth rate of technology/(1 - elasticity of out-\nput with respect to capital).\" Similarly, but apart from Romer\nor not emerging economies, which grow faster, can sustain\nrapid growth rates. Benhabib et al. (2014) use Hicks-neutral\nidentification and analyze comparative dynamics for Hicks-\nneutral technical change. They show that \"Hicks-neutral\nincrease in the productivity of growth technologies can\nchange the equilibrium outcome\" (p. 20). Whereas, recognize\nthat if there is Hicks-neutral technological progress, \"capital-\nlabor ratio never reach an equilibrium but grows forever\"\n(Solow, 1956, p. 85); that is, there will be no equilibrium.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, mathematical models of economic growth,\nwhich analyzes balanced growth or steady state and which\nuses the Cobb\u00adDouglas production function, should assume\nthe nature of technological progress as Harrod-neutral.\nWith this short note, we would like to remind of this postu-\nlate. However, if Hicks-neutral is assumed rather than\nHarrod-neutral, then the level of technology should be\nassumed constant for the stability. Furthermore, we suggest\ntaking into account either Harrod-neutral technological\nprogress identification or the constant level of technology,\nwhile assuming Hicks-neutral technological progress\nidentification in the models of economic growth based on\nstability.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAcikgoz, S., & Mert, M.
