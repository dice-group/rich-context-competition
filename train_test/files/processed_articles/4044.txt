The direct involvement of citizens in policy deci-\nsions has frequently been linked to improvements in the\nquality of democracy. For instance, many argue that direct\ndemocracy leads to policy choices that are (more) consist-\nent with majority preferences (Leemann and Wasserfallen,\nthat direct democracy increases the political knowledge of\ncitizens, voter turnout, party membership, and trust in polit-\neffect of direct democracy on the behavior of elites and\ntheir responsiveness to citizen-initiated contacts.\nTheories of representative democracy and direct democ-\nracy hold different expectations concerning citizens'\ninvolvement in political decision-making (Christiano,\n2015). In the former type of government, citizens are\nexpected to participate indirectly in lawmaking by regu-\nlarly selecting their representatives in free and fair elec-\ntions. In contrast, direct democracy requires citizens to take\nan active part in choosing the public policies that will be\nimplemented. In real life, these ideal types of democracy\ninteract and contribute to reinforce or undermine the\ninfluence of political elites and representative institutions\non policy-making (Altman, 2010). For example, Altman\n(2012) shows that the use of direct democratic procedures,\nand in particular initiative rights, increases turnout. There\nare, however, few studies examining how direct democratic\nprocedures affect the functioning of representative democ-\nracy from the angle of elites. Thus, the purpose of this arti-\ncleistoinvestigatehowdirectandrepresentativedemocracy\ninteract and influence politicians' political behavior. To do\nso, we use a field experiment on Swiss state legislators and\nformally test whether direct democracy increases commu-\nnicative responsiveness, which in turn should translate into\nmore policy congruence.\nDoes direct democracy increase\ncommunicative responsiveness?\nA field experiment with Swiss\npoliticians\nAnouk Lloren\n Keywords\nCommunicative responsiveness, direct democracy, field experiment, Switzerland\nSwiss National Science Foundation, Bern, Switzerland\nCorresponding author:\nAnouk Lloren, Swiss National Science Foundation, Bern, Switzerland.\nEmail: anouk.lloren@gmail.com\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \nBy examining how the institution of direct democracy\nshapes communicative responsiveness, our approach is\nsimilar to Putnam's investigation of institutional perfor-\nmance across Italian regions (Putnam, 1993). In his seminal\nbook Making Democracy Work, Putnam examines how\ninstitutions influence the practice of politics and govern-\nment, including how it affects public officials' responsive-\nness to citizen-initiated contacts in Northern and Southern\nItaly. The Swiss context provides a unique setting to answer\nquestions relating to the effect of direct democracy and its\nrelation to representative institutions. As the only country\nwith a long history of direct democratic participation, it\nallows us to take advantage of variations in direct demo-\ncratic institutions across Swiss cantons (the equivalent of\nUS states). In practical terms, we emailed approximately\n1,700 state legislators using fictitious aliases requesting an\nappointment for a policy-related conversation. We then\ncompared the response rate of legislators to citizens'\nrequests across cantons with different levels of direct\ndemocracy.\nThere are reasons to believe that direct democracy\nshapes the behavior of elites and increases legislators'\nresponsiveness to citizen-initiated contacts. Broadly speak-\ning, we identify two mechanisms behind this effect. First,\nin direct democratic contexts, citizens potentially threaten\nto bloc the legislative process by using their referendum or\ninitiative rights to recall an existing law or propose a new\nlaw. As a consequence, policy-makers try to anticipate vot-\ners' preferences and follow the position held by the major-\nity, a process that is referred to as the indirect effect of\ndirect democracy. Legislators thus have stronger incentives\nto listen to citizens' policy concerns where direct democ-\nracy is strong in order to gain knowledge about what the\npublic wants and avoid any blocking of the legislative\nprocess.\nSecond, research on the role of political elites in direct\ndemocratic contexts suggests that politicians remain pow-\nerful and contribute in shaping public opinion (Trechsel\nand Sciarini, 1998). Legislators can take advantage of citi-\nzen-initiated contacts to explain their position to voters in\norder to influence their views on specific policies. When\ndirect participation rules in lawmaking are extensive, the\nstake to respond to citizens' communication is even higher\nas political elites want to persuade voters in order to main-\ntain their control over policy-making. Therefore, we expect\npoliticians to respond more frequently to voters' requests\nwhen citizens have more opportunities to participate\ndirectly in policy-making.\nFocusing on legislators' readiness to listen to the wishes\nof the public and explain their policy position to voters, i.e.\ncommunicative responsiveness, is important for under-\nstanding how the aggregation and articulation of citizens'\npreferences take place. In direct democratic contexts, it is\na privileged way for representatives to get knowledge\nabout voters, influence public opinion, and increase their\nlegitimacy by involving the public (Esaiasson et al., 2016).\nIt has the potential to avoid legislative blockage, maintain\nlegislators' control over political decision-making, and\nincrease voters' satisfaction with their representatives, and\npolicy outcomes more generally.\nThe findings from our field experiment, however, do not\nsupport our hypothesis. Although direct democracy might\nencourage citizens to participate more in politics and con-\ntact their legislators more frequently, direct democracy\ndoes not enhance politicians' responsiveness to citizen-ini-\ntiated contacts. Our results have important implications for\nour understanding of the benefits that direct democratic\nprocedures provide across the world. While they might\nimprove policy congruence and encourage political partici-\npation, they do not seem to shape the responsiveness of\nMPs to citizens' direct requests.\nObstacles to Measuring\nCommunicative Responsiveness\nResearch on citizens' influence over political decision-\nmaking has mostly focused on policy responsiveness, i.e.\nwhether legislators act in accordance with constituents'\nviews. These studies mainly rely on roll-call data or ideo-\nlogical positions drawn from survey responses to examine\ncongruence between legislators' and voters' preferences.\nHowever, representatives also engage in other types of\naction to respond to their constituents' needs and concerns.\nFor instance, constituency service is a clear and simple way\nfor legislators to respond to voters.\nAs traditional ways of participating in politics, such as\nturnout, are losing ground, citizens increasingly resort to\nmore individualized and short-term means of political par-\nticipation. Today citizens are more likely to directly contact\ntheir representatives, via mail, email, telephone calls, or\nsocial networks, to influence political decision-making.\nConstituency service is an important aspect of legislative\nwork. Representatives spent a substantial share of their\ntime and resources to reach and respond to voters. Recent\nstudies suggest that representatives consider citizen-initi-\nated contacts as one of the most efficient ways to partici-\npate in policy-making, after joining a party and voting\nDirect communications with constituents provide an oppor-\ntunity for politicians to listen to the wishes of the public and\nexplain their policy position, but also to adapt their behav-\nior to follow majority opinion (Esaiasson et al., 2016).\nHowever, little attention has been given to how politi-\ncians respond to citizen-initiated contacts, and in particular,\nhow institutions contribute to shaping communicative\nresponsiveness. Previous research largely uses observa-\ntional data, and existing field experiments mostly focus on\nthe Unites States. Experimental designs advance the litera-\nture by overcoming inferential challenges that often plague\nobservational studies on communicative responsiveness\nand constituency service. In particular, surveys with elected\nofficials are often characterized by low levels of response\nrates. For example, Hooghe and Marien's (2014) study on\nhow representatives perceive citizens' requests in eight\ncountries is based on surveys were response rates varied\nfrom 15% (Italy) to 39% (Belgium).1 Moreover, experi-\nments enable us to overcome limitations due to social desir-\nability, which can lead politicians'to overstate constituency\nwork in surveys (De Vries et al., 2015). To sum up, our\nexperimental design avoids widespread problems found in\nobservational studies.\nThere are potential ethical issues in collecting data\nthrough field experiments, especially when they imply con-\ntacting politicians with fictitious identities and policy\nrequests. Issues pertaining to deception, anonymity, and\nextra burden placed on politicians' daily activities are the\nmain ethical concerns raised by our research design. While\nmost field experiments in political science examine citi-\nzens' behavior, experimental designs that focus on political\nelites have only recently started to become a popular way to\nstudy political decision-making (Grose, 2014). Following\nthe guidelines developed by Butler and Broockman (2011),\nour research design takes these important ethical concerns\ninto account. Deception is necessary to overcome common\nshortcomings of observational studies on responsiveness\nand constituency service (politicians' low response rates to\nsurveys or social desirability bias). However, the deception\nof legislators is offset by minimizing \"the burden placed on\nemail formulates a request in a short and simple way so that\nit is easy for legislators to respond. Grose (2014) notes that\nrepeated field experiments on legislators might increase the\nburden on political elites. However, to the best of the\nauthor's knowledge few experiments in the European and\nSwiss context have targeted legislators via email requests\nSecond, the research guarantees the anonymity of politi-\ncians'responses (and non-responses) to ensure that no harm\nwill be caused to the participants of the field experiment by\nanonymizing individual-level data.\nExperimental Design\nIn November 2015, we conducted a field experiment with\n1,756 randomly selected state legislators elected in the\nGerman- and French-speaking cantons of Switzerland\n(70% sample of all legislators). These politicians received\nan email from fictitious voters requesting an appointment\nfor a policy-related conversation (for similar experimental\nexcludes 69 cases with wrong email addresses or auto-\nreplies. In total, 1,687 legislators received the email.\nSimilarly to other previous studies, the experiment treats\nthe email addresses of the representatives and not legisla-\ntors themselves (see, e.g., Butler and Broockman, 2011;\nTable 1 shows the exact email translated into English.\nThe original emails were in German to state legislators\nfrom the German-speaking part of Switzerland and in\nFrench to state legislators from the French-speaking part\n(see Tables 2 and 3 for emails in the original language). The\nemails varied in several factors that are not essential for this\nstudy.3 First, the occupational background of the sender and\nwhether they are a member of a union. While union mem-\nbership is biased to the left, the sentence \"I am an active\nunion member\" was randomly assigned as part of a treat-\nment condition. Owing to random assignment, union status\nis unrelated to the main independent variable and therefore\ndoes not bias the results presented in this paper. Second, we\ndiversified the email messages by using different sender's\nnames, gender and timing of the email. In particular, we\nselected 10 of the most common Swiss names (5 male and\n5 female names) and created corresponding gmail accounts.\nIn addition, we sent out emails in four different batches\nwith one week between the batches. These factors are\nincluded as control variables in our analysis below.\nThe exact wording of the email is partly based on infor-\nmal interviews with state legislators. The interviews\nfocused on how citizens usually contact their legislators\n(frequency and type of request, etc.). In general, politicians\nconfirmed that they were frequently contacted by voters\nwith policy requests: in Western Europe, service requests\nare dealt by civil servants and almost never by legislators.\nTable 1. Email sent to state legislators.\nSubject: Appointment request\nDear [state legislator's name],\nI have been working for 10 years as a [occupation] in your\ncanton [and I am an active union member]. I would like to\ndiscuss various political issues that are important to me.\nWould it be possible to make an appointment?\nThank you,\n[Email sender's name]\nNote: Randomly varied treatments in italics.\nTable 2. Email in German.\nSubject: Terminanfrage\nSehr geehrter Herr/geehrte Frau [state legislator's name],\nIch arbeite seit 10 Jahren als [occupation] in ihrem Kanton.\nIch wuerde mit Ihnen gerne verschiedene politische Themen\nbesprechen die mir wichtig sind.\nWaere es moeglich einen Termin zu vereinbaren?\nVielen Dank und beste Gruesse,\n[Email sender's name]\nNote: Randomly varied treatments in italics.\n4 Research and Politics \nVoters usually contact legislators to share their opinion on a\nspecific concern or ask them to explain their position on a\nparticular issue or event. Communicative responsiveness is\nthus an important part of legislators' work (for a discussion\nof this concept, see, e.g., Ohberg and Naurin, 2015). Our\nexperimental design takes this information into account.\nFollowing the interviews, we excluded any reference to\na particular political topic in the emails. Instead, the\nemails allude to \"various political topics that are important\nto me\".\nWe match the data from our experiment with informa-\ntion on direct democratic institutions in Swiss cantons.\nSwitzerland offers a unique setting to test the impact of\ndirect democracy. Cantons provide important variation\nwith regard to direct democratic rights. For instance, some\ncantons offer very extensive participatory rights, while\nother cantons are \"more strongly oriented toward represent-\native democracy\" (Freitag and Ackermann, 2015: 6). We\nuse two measures to gauge the scope of direct democratic\nrights in cantons.4 First, we draw on an index measuring\nhow much formal direct democratic rights are developed.\nThe measure assesses the difficulty for citizens to use direct\ndemocratic procedures (e.g. the number of signatures\nrequired or the time granted to collect signatures). The\nindex varies between 1 (low direct democratic rights) and 6\n(high direct democratic rights). Second, we use \"the yearly\naverage of all cantonal popular votes (for initiatives and\nthe actual use of direct democracy. The measure ranges\nfrom 1 (the canton of Valais) to 19.5 (the canton of Glarus).\nBoth direct democratic indexes are common in the lit-\nerature on Swiss direct democracy (Fatke, 2015; Freitag\nThey have recently been updated by Schaub and Dlabac\n(2012). The indexes represent two complementary ways of\nmeasuring the extent to which direct democratic rights are\ndeveloped at the cantonal level, namely presence and actual\nuse of direct participatory rights. Using both indexes\nstrengthens our results by examining whether they are con-\nsistent across different measures. The indexes are only\nmoderately correlated (Fatke, 2015), which means that\nthere are some differences between presence and actual use\nof direct democratic rights across cantons. For example, the\nCanton of Geneva offers citizens less opportunities to use\ndirect democratic rights (the score is 1.75 on the first index)\nbut popular votes are used comparatively frequently (the\nscore is 15 on the second index).\nFigure 1 illustrates the variation in the scope of direct\ndemocratic rights at the cantonal level when using the first\nindex. Overall, the figure shows that these rights tend to be\nmore developed in German-speaking cantons than in\nFrench- and Italian-speaking cantons. Formal rules are\nmost extensive in the Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden,\nfollowed by the canton of Basel Land and Solothurn, while\nthey are the least developed in the cantons of Geneva,\nTicino, and Vaud. The second index reveals that, between\nton of Glarus and the least in the canton of Valais. Leemann\nand Wasserfallen (2016) calculated California's score on\nthe formal rule index. The State's score was about 2.33\ncompared with Switzerland's average score of 4.11. In light\nof this result, they conclude that Swiss cantons provide, on\naverage, extensive democratic rights to their citizens.\nTo answer the question whether legislators are more\nresponsive to citizens when direct democratic institutions\nare more developed, we compare the response rate of legis-\nlators across cantons. The dependent variable is whether or\nnot a legislator responds to the email. As a robustness\ncheck, we also use an alternative dependent variable,\nnamely whether or not a legislator agrees to a political con-\nversation. The two outcome variables capture different\naspects of legislators' responsiveness to citizen-initiated\ncontacts that have played an important role in previous\nresearch. The first focuses on whether politicians respond\nat all (see, e.g., Butler and Broockman, 2011) and the sec-\nond considers the quality of the response by capturing\nwhether a legislator satisfies the request from a citizen to\ngrant them a meeting. Using two distinct measures of\nresponsiveness ensures that the results are consistent across\ndifferent definitions of the outcome variable.\nBecause legislators are nested within cantons, the analy-\nses use multilevel, logistic regression models with random\neffects for the canton level. Our models control for addi-\ntional characteristics such as the sender's occupational\nbackground, organizational membership, name, gender, the\nemail batch, the party of the legislator, and whether the\nemail was in French or German. In addition, we control for\ncantonal level factors, such as population size and unem-\nployment rate.\nResults\nresponded within two weeks so that the response rate was\nabout 50%. Moreover, 622 politicians agreed to a conversa-\ntion about political issues, either in person or via phone\nand email (36.9%). This response rate is similar to that of\nTable 3. Original email in French.\nSubject: Demande de rendez-vous\nCher Monsieur/Ch\u00e8re Madame [state legislator's name],\nJe travaille depuis 10 ans comme [occupation] dans votre canton.\nJe voudrais partager avec vous quelques-unes de mes opinions\npolitiques qui me tiennent coeur.\nSerait-il possible de prendre rendez-vous avec vous ?\nMerci d'avance,\n[Email sender's name]\nNote: Randomly varied treatments in italics.\nprevious experiments carried out in the United States (see,\nTable 4 reports the estimates from logistic regression\nmodels on state legislators' responsiveness to citizen-initi-\nated contacts. The analyses show that responsiveness is\nmore widespread among legislators elected in German-\nspeaking cantons. Other studies have arrived at similar con-\nclusions (see, e.g., Giger and Lanz, 2016). Swiss\u00adGerman\ncantons display more comprehensive direct democratic\nrights than French-speaking cantons. However, contrary to\ntheoretical expectations, the results indicate that direct\ndemocracy does not increase politicians' responsiveness to\npolicy requests. Cultural differences could explain these\ndifferences in responsiveness. In particular, differences in\npoliticians' political socialization leading to specific con-\nceptions of representation might lead to differences in\nemphasis with regard to responsiveness.\nThe coefficient for formal participatory rules is negative\nand far from statistical significance (Model 1).Accordingly,\nlegislators in cantons with more extensive participatory\nrights are not more likely to respond to constituents'\nrequests. Likewise, the second column of Table 4 indicates\nthat an increase in the actual use of direct democratic pro-\ncedures has no effect on politicians propensity to reply to\ncitizens communications (Model 2). While the point esti-\nmate is positive, it is substantively small and far from being\nstatistically significant. As a robustness check, we ran the\nanalyses with an alternative dependent variable, namely\nwhether or not a legislator agrees to a political conversa-\ntion. The analyses yield similar results (see Table 5). To\nsum up, direct democracy might encourage citizens to par-\nticipate more in politics (Altman, 2012) and to contact their\nlegislators more frequently. However, our findings suggest\nthat citizens' direct participation in lawmaking does not\nencourage legislators to respond more to citizens policy\nrequests. This result is consistent across different measures\nfor the dependent and main independent variables.\nAn important limitation of our analyses is that the number\nof cantons is limited to 25 and some of the variation in direct\ndemocracy across cantons is explained by the language\ncontrol variable (German- versus French-speaking cantons).5\nTo address this problem, we conducted a simulation-based\npower analysis. The analysis examines the statistical power\nof our study by asking how large the true effect would have\nto be in order to be detectable. It involves three steps\n(Gelman and Hill, 2007). First, we simulated data based on\nthe models presented in Table 4. The sample size, covariate\ndistribution, model specification, and parameters are all\ndetermined by the estimated model but we incrementally\nchanged the true effect size of the two direct democracy\nindexes. As a result, we obtained fake or simulated data for\nthe outcome variable. Second, we used the simulated out-\ncome variable to fit the same model presented in Table 4.\nFinally, we repeated the simulation steps 1,000 times and\ncomputed the statistical power as the average number of\nsimulation runs with an effect that is statistically significant\nat the 0.05 level. The results are presented in Figure 2. They\nshow how the statistical power, i.e. the likelihood that our\nstudy would detect an effect, depends on the true effect\nsize. For small effects, the power is relatively low but\nincreases rapidly for medium and large effects: 80% power\nis achieved for effect sizes of 0.22 and 0.14 for the first and\nsecond direct democratic index respectively. This corre-\nindicate that our study has sufficient statistical power to\ndetect medium and large effects particularly for the second\nFigure 1. Variation in direct democratic rights in Swiss cantons.\n6 Research and Politics \ndirect democracy index but not necessarily small effects.\nAccordingly, these results suggest that Switzerland as the\nonly country with a long history of direct democratic insti-\ntutions provides a unique opportunity to study the effect of\ndirect democracy on the responsiveness of MPs.\nConclusion\nRecent studies have shown that citizens' direct participa-\ntion in decision-making generates policy outcomes that are\n(more) consistent with majority preferences. Moreover,\nresearch suggests that the institution of direct democracy\nhas positive secondary consequences for citizens, such as\nenhancing voters' political knowledge, and satisfaction\nwith political decisions. However, little is known about\nhow direct democratic procedures affect the behavior of\npolitical elites. In particular, no studies have, to the best of\nthe author's knowledge, examined whether direct participa-\ntion in lawmaking increases politicians' communicative\nresponsiveness.\nThe effect of direct democracy on responsiveness is\nespecially important given that \"the main democratic power\nof direct democracy is that the political elite anticipate pref-\nerence deviations and, in the case that voters have extensive\ndirect democratic rights, follow the position held by (the\nlarge) majority of voters\" (Leemann and Wasserfallen,\n2016). Provided that legislators are both vote- and policy-\nseekers, they have incentives to respond to citizen-initiated\ncontacts to gain knowledge about what citizens want to\navoid any legislative blocking. In contexts where direct\ndemocracy is strong, representatives might also want to\nmaintain control over political decision-making: responding\nto citizens' policy requests provides them with the opportu-\nnity to explain their position to voters and shape public\nopinion. Therefore, we expected politicians to respond more\nfrequently to voters' policy requests when citizens have\nmore opportunities to participate directly in lawmaking.\nOur results show, however, that state elected officials are\nnot more likely to respond to citizens' policy requests when\ndirect democratic rights are extensive. How can we explain\nthis finding? It could be that politicians in cantons with\nmore direct democracy receive more emails and that they\nare, therefore, less likely to notice and respond to them. This\nexplanation is, however, unlikely since research suggests\nthat direct democracy procedures do not automatically\nincrease citizens' political participation (see, e.g., Altman,\nWith regard to the literature on the indirect effect of\ndirect democracy, our findings suggest that communicative\nresponsiveness is not a central mechanism through which\npoliticians can be informed about what the public wants or\npersuade voters to adopt certain viewpoints. There are, of\ncourse, other ways through which legislators can get\ninformed about citizens' preferences or persuade them to\nadopt their views. For instance, organized interests can play\nan important role in the aggregation of citizens'preferences\nand are often integrated in the early stages of the legislative\nprocess to avoid blockages in lawmaking (Sciarini, 2007).\nMore importantly, however, not all voters and interest\ngroups are equally active (and successful) in trying to reach\nout to politicians. For instance, studies have shown that\nlegislators tend to represent the viewpoints of advantaged\nTherefore, legislators interested in passing policy (i.e.\nensure themselves a victory in popular votes) and keeping\ntheir seat might want to take into account the preferences of\nthe median voter rather than the preferences of citizens who\ncontact them. In order to learn about the median voters'\nposition and persuade them effectively, legislators might\nbest rely on other means than on one-to-one meetings with\nTable 4.

Put differently, there\nare alternative pathways than communicative responsive-\nness that can make politicians' reactive to citizens' con-\ncerns and needs. Future research should thus further\nexamine how direct democratic rights affect political elites'\nbehavior.\n"
