Controlling for age, sex, race,\nurbanicity, and education, the hazard rate ratio of mortality was 3.22 (95% confi-\nCI, 1.49-3.67) for those in the middle-income group.

In addition, underlying\ncausesofdeath(obtainedfromdeathcer-\ntificates) were grouped into 4 categories\nbased on the International Statistical\nClassificationofDiseases,10thRevision\n(ICD-10): (1) tumors, (2) cardiovascular\ndiseases,(3)allotherdiseases,and(4)ex-\nternal causes, such as unintentional in-\njury, suicide, homicide, or legal interven-\ntion.

Education is measured\nas respondents' total years of completed\neducationandisgroupedasa3-category\nIncome is measured as the combined in-\ncome from all sources of the respondent\nand his or her spouse in the preceding\nyear, and also is grouped into 3 catego-\nfinedcategoriesofeducationandincome\nproduced similar results for the analy-\nses presented, as did adding controls for\nhousehold size and assets.\nAge is grouped into 6 categories: 25\nolder.Othersociodemographicvariables\nbeing studied include sex (male vs fe-\nmale), race (nonblack vs black), and ur-\nbanicity of residence (central city, sub-\nurban, or rural). Previous research has\nfoundthesedemographicvariablestobe\nrelated to socioeconomic factors, health\nriskbehaviors,andmortality.Thus,they\nare included in the analysis primarily as\ncontrols for potential confounders.\nBehavioral Risk Factor Measures\nHealth behavior indicators are based\non self-reported information from re-\nspondents at ACL wave 1. Cigarette\nsmoking is coded as never smoked,\nformer smokers, and current smokers.\nAlcoholdrinkingiscodedusing3catego-\nries based on the number of drinks con-\nsumed in the past month: nondrinkers\n(0 alcoholic drinks in past month), mod-\nerate drinkers (1-89 drinks), and heavy\ndrinkers (90 drinks). Body weight was\nmeasured using the body mass index\n(BMI), weight in kilograms divided by\nthe square of height in meters , based on\nself-reported weight and height. The\nbody weight variable was coded as nor-\nmal body weight, overweight, and un-\nderweight. Following the methods of\nBerkman and Breslow,1 those in the\nhighest15%oftheweightedsex-specific\nBMI distributions were coded as over-\nweight and those in the lowest 5% of the\nweightedsex-specificBMIdistributions\nwere coded as underweight.\nA physical activity index was com-\nputed based on answers to questions re-\ngarding how often the respondent en-\ngaged in active sports or exercise, gar-\ndening or yard work, and taking walks.\nPhysical activity index scores were di-\nvided into quintiles to create 5 group-\ningsofnear-equalsamplesize.Thegroup\nin the top quintile represents the 21% of\nthe weighted sample that is the most\nphysically active.\nHealthStatus.--Threevariableswere\navailable to measure baseline health sta-\ntus: (1) self-rated health measured with a\nsingle 5-category scale classified as ex-\ncellent,verygood,good,fair,andpoor;(2)\nthenumberofmajorchronicconditionsex-\nperienced in the last year from a list of 10\nconditions; and (3) an index of functional\nstatus, with the lowest score of 1 repre-\nsenting confinement to a chair or bed and\nthe highest score of 4 representing the\nability to do heavy work inside or outside\nStatisticalAnalysis.--Inallanalyses,\nthe data were weighted to adjust for dif-\nferential response rates and variation in\nprobabilities of selection into the sample.\nPoststratification weights adjust ACL\nBureau of the Census population esti-\nmatesbysex,age,andregionofthecoun-\ntry. Descriptive statistics were obtained\nthrough the Statistical Analysis System,\nSAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC, including\nfrequency distributions of all variables\nbeing studied, cross tabulations of the\nsocioeconomic variables and health risk\nbehaviors, and cross tabulations of socio-\neconomic variables and mortality. In cre-\nating contingency tables regarding the\nrelationship between socioeconomic fac-\ntors and health risk behaviors, direct\nstandardization to the age distribution of\ntheweightedACLwave1populationwas\nusedtoaccountforthestrongassociation\nbetweenageandsocioeconomicfactors.31\nThe Cox proportional hazards model\nwas used to estimate the relative risk of\nmortality in terms of various back-\nground, socioeconomic, and health be-\nhaviorvariables.Taylorserieslineariza-\ntion procedures using SUDAAN, Re-\nsearch Triangle Institute, Research\nTriangle Park, NC, were used to make\nadjustments to standard errors for the\ncomplex sample design. The effects of\neach independent variable being stud-\nied on mortality were analyzed sepa-\nrately. A series of multiple predictor\nmodels were then estimated.

Those\nwith low educational attainment were\nsignificantly more likely to die than\nthosewith16ormoreyearsofeducation.\nThe relationship between education and\nmortality and between income and mor-\ntality was stronger for females. Both\nmen and women in the lowest-income\ncategory were more than 3 times as\nlikely to die during the follow-up period\nof the study than those in the highest\ngroup, controlling for age and other so-\nciodemographic variables (Table 3).\nWhile education was strongly related to\nhealth behaviors, income was more pre-\ndictive of mortality than education.\nThe relationship between socioeco-\nnomic factors, health behaviors, and\nmortality was explored by conducting a\nsequence of Cox proportional hazards\nmodels. The results of a model including\nstatistical controls for age, race, urban-\nicity,sex,education,andincomearepre-\nsented as model 1 in Table 4.

For example, when physical ac-\ntivity was added to the model, the coef-\nficient for the effect of income attenu-\nated a small amount, suggesting that\nphysical activity explains only a small\nproportion of the relationship between\nincome and mortality. The results of the\nfull model when all health behaviors\nwere considered simultaneously (model\n2, Table 4) show that there was still a\nstrong and significant income effect on\nmortality for both the middle-income\nand the low-income groups (OR = 2.77;\npredictive effect of income on mortality.\nIntermsofthehealthbehaviors,there-\nsults suggest that being severely under-\nweight or having lower levels of physical\nactivity were significant risk factors for\nsubsequent mortality, controlling for de-\nmographic and socioeconomic character-\nistics (Table 4).

Several\nhealth behaviors were associated with a\nsignificantly higher risk of death in spe-\ncific categories (ie, both current and\nformer smoking was associated with an\nincreased risk of tumor deaths, heavy\ndrinking was associated with increased\nrisk of death from external causes, and\nlowphysicalactivitywasassociatedwith\nincreased risk of tumor and cardiovas-\ncular deaths).

An important area on which both\npolicy rhetoric and action have focused is\nthat of health education and health pro-\nmotion at the individual level. A tacit as-\nsumption among some policymakers and\nhealth authorities is that an important\nway to reduce socioeconomic gaps in\nhealth status is to improve the health be-\nhaviors among those with low levels of\nincomeandeducation.Thispositionisob-\nvious in the Department of Health and\nNationalHealthPromotionandDisease\nPrevention Objectives and other reports\non the state of health among poor and mi-\nThis position has also been articulated in\nthe lay press. For example, an opinion\npiece in the Wall Street Journal32 criti-\ncized public health researchers' growing\nfocus on social systems and institutions,\narguing that poor people tend to have\nworse health and shorter life expectan-\ncies,primarily\"becauseunhealthyhabits\nare more prevalent on the lower rungs of\nthe socioeconomic ladder.\"\nOur results suggest that despite the\npresence of significant socioeconomic dif-\nferentials in health behaviors, these dif-\nferencesaccountforonlyamodestpropor-\ntion of social inequalities in overall\nmortality.Thus,publichealthpoliciesand\ninterventionsthatexclusivelyfocusonin-\ndividual risk behaviors have limited po-\ntentialforreducingsocioeconomicdispari-\nties in mortality. While reducing the\nprevalence of behavioral risk factors is an\nimportant and critical public health goal,\nsocioeconomicdifferentialsinmortalityare\ndue to a wider array of factors and, there-\nfore, would persist even with improved\nhealth behaviors. Increasing health pro-\nmotion and disease prevention efforts\namong the disadvantaged is not a \"magic\npolicy bullet\" for reducing persistent so-\ncioeconomic disparities in mortality.\nIf health risk behaviors do not explain\nmuch of the relationship between socio-\neconomic factors and mortality, what\nelse can account for this strong associa-\ntion? First, differences in exposure to\noccupational and environmental health\nhazards across social strata do exist and,\nthus, may be playing a role in mortality\ninequalities.33-35 Second, although not a\npanacea for eliminating socioeconomic\ndifferences in health status, improved\nequity regarding access to and use of\npreventive and appropriate therapeutic\nmedical care is viewed as having some\npotential for preventing the further de-\nterioration of health in disadvantaged\nThird, socioeconomic stratification it-\nself may be a social force that has delete-\nrious health effects for those in the lower\nstrata. As Blane41 explains, socioeco-\nnomic inequalities in societies \"structure\nthe life experiences of their members so\nthat advantages and disadvantages tend\nto cluster cross-sectionally and accumu-\nlate longitudinally.\" Persons in lower so-\ncioeconomic strata have increased expo-\nsure to a broad range of psychosocial\nvariablespredictiveofmorbidityandmor-\ntality.

First, the health behav-\niors being investigated were self-\nreported and were not assessed retro-\nspectively. Literature on the accuracy of\nself-reported health behaviors suggests\nthat, although most people report hon-\nestlyforbehaviorsthatarenotillegal,the\nbiases that do exist are in the direction\nof underreporting negative health be-\nhaviors.48-50 Thus, the result of any prob-\nlems in the reporting of health behav-\niors would likely be an underestimation\nof their effects. Second, the length of the\nfollow-upperiodinthisprospectivestudy\nlimitsourabilitytoinvestigatethelonger-\nterm effects of income, education, and\nhealth behaviors on mortality. Third, the\nsmall number of deaths for some of the\ndemographic groups puts limits on the\nmultivariatesubgroupanalysisthatcould\nbe performed. Fourth, it is possible that\nadditional health behaviors and risk\nfactors not studied explain more of the\nrelationship between income and mor-\ntality.

A full explanation of social in-\nequalities in mortality, however, needs\nto address why all of these risk factors\ntend to be patterned by socioeconomic\ncharacteristics.\nOur results suggest that both health\nbehaviors and socioeconomic factors are\nimportant determinants of mortality.\nWhile health behaviors are related to\nbothincomeandeducation,theyaccount\nfor a small proportion of observed socio-\neconomic differences in mortality. Thus,\nthe problem of lifestyle and mortality is\nnot just one of inadequate education or\nincome, and the problem of socioeco-\nnomic differentials in mortality is not\njust a problem of lifestyle choices. We\nmust look to a broader range of explana-\ntory risk factors, including structural el-\nements of inequality in our society.\nAging, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md,\nandbyaHealthInvestigatorAward(DrHouse)from\ntheRobertWoodJohnsonFoundation,Princeton,NJ.\nThe authors would like to thank the Technical\nSections of the Survey Research Center for con-\nducting the sampling, interviewing, and coding for\nthe Americans' Changing Lives survey, additional\ncolleagues for their assistance in various phases of\nthe work, and the respondents.
