Each film consists of fixed shots of protracted dura-\ntion of architectural spaces and objects closely associated with the most recent Argentine dictator-\nship (1976\u00ad1983) and attempts to memorialise the atrocities they committed. In their composition,\nall of Perel's films tend towards an extreme naturalism: each frame is shot in natural daylight and\ndeep focus, and point of view and point of audition appear to be perfectly synchronised. The films\nare accompanied only by diegetic environmental sounds and feature little discernible speech.\nIndeed, where much post-dictatorship cinema in Argentina has focussed on familial relations and\nthe human suffering experienced throughout the period, Perel's films are wilfully depopulated and\nthe few human personages who do appear in his texts are of secondary importance to architectural\nCorresponding author:\nNiall HD Geraghty, Institute of Latin American Studies, School of Advanced Study, University of London, Senate House,\nMalet Street, London WC1E 7HU, UK.\nEmail: niall.geraghty@sas.ac.uk\nArticle\nand spatial elements. As has been well established, the dictatorship deployed `a sinister methodol-\nogy' which sought the `destruction of individuals', a strategy which found its apotheosis in `the\n\"disappearance\" of mortal remains' which denied `even the possibility of a posthumous recon-\nstruction of subjectivity through mourning and remembrance' (Andermann, 2012: 79\u00ad80).\nMoreover, as Pilar Calveiro (1998) \u00ad herself a former prisoner in one of the dictatorship's\nClandestine Detention Centres (CDCs) \u00ad notes, `the testimonies from any camp coincide in [their\ndescription of] the darkness, the silence, and the immobility'(p. 48, original emphasis) experienced\nin the CDCs.1 Thus it seems that, throughout his work, Perel appropriates and inverts several of the\ntechniques employed by the dictatorship during its regime of systematic State terrorism in order to\ncommemorate its victims. Perel's camera remains entirely immobile, the audio track records only\nsilence, and the lack of human subjects provides a visual echo of the fact of disappearance. As\nPerel has frequently asserted, then, it appears that his filmic oeuvre is constructed from `silence and\nimmediately ties Perel's artistic output to arguments such as those put forward by Horacio Gonz\u00e1lez\n(2005) that `emptiness' creates `the possibility of marking the absence of that which was snatched\naway by horror' (p. 72).2 Despite this convergence of thematic content and stylistic qualities, how-\never, I contend that the apparent `emptiness' of Perel's films is a mere illusion, a method of dem-\nonstrating that `[t]here is no such thing as silence' (Cage, 1961: 191). Indeed, what I want to\npropose is that Perel's first two films in particular, El predio (The Site, 2010) and Los murales (The\nMurals, 2011) are, in fact, uniquely musical works.\nFraming silence as music\nDarkness. A black screen. Nothing. Silent emptiness extends and seems interminable. The faintest of\nsounds begins; rapid, rhythmical, repetitive. Sustained and unchanging from the moment of its emergence.\nThe screen remains empty. The isolated sound is perceptible yet unidentifiable. Is it a distant idling motor?\nThe faint whir of film running through a projector? An increase in intensity; silence surrounds, envelops\nand roars. Light bursts from the screen. Momentary disorientation before the image crystallises. The\ncamera advances along a tree-lined street in bright daylight. Shadows on the road form irregular shapes\nand patterns like the sensuous curves of water refracting bright light. Silence is the rumble of distant\ntraffic transiently punctured by other unseen sounds: the high pitched wail of an angle grinder; the\nharmonious cacophony of dissimilar birdsongs. A bus is stationed on the right of the screen, a car on the\nleft. A figure emerges from behind a tree and crosses the road. We roll towards them, then cut. Another\nstreet, a different silence. (Figure 1)\nEl predio opens with sound and an exception. There are 40seconds of silence proper (i.e. the\nabsence of sound emitted from the film) before the first sonic event, which extends for a further\nseconds before the visual image emerges. There follows a series of seven tracking shots; the\nonly ones found in any of Perel's films. At this point, sound and vision synchronise and the sound-\nscape becomes coherent. Yet it is the delicate sonorous opening which ensures that the viewer is\nacutely attentive and readily perceives every subtle change in the soundtrack. Thereafter, the con-\ntinual presence of sound `that is irregular and thus unpredictable [...] puts the ear and the attention\non constant alert' (Chion, 1994: 15) and the `vast extension' (p. 87) of ambient sounds provides\n`unity by establishing atmosphere [...] as a framework that seems to contain the image'(p. 47).3 Or\nrather, the erratic fluidity of the sounds accompanying the filmic scene surrounds the viewer and\nslight alterations in sonic intensity allow each individual sound to be spatially located whether their\nsource is visible on screen or not. Rather than containing the image, then, the atmosphere created\nby environmental sounds in El predio (and all of Perel's films) adds depth and draws the audience\nGeraghty 3\ninto the shot. Ambient sounds convert the flat screen into a three dimensional space inhabited by\nthe audience. The effect is further accentuated by Perel's use of deep focus as the viewer's gaze can\nwander and select what to view at any given moment.4\nIn the film's opening sequence, these sonorous and visual effects work together such that the\nviewer is located within `a space apart from the city' yet nonetheless `located very much within it'\n(Scorer, 2016: 31\u00ad32). The continual rumble of traffic is heard, but never seen; the roads the cam-\nera travels along are largely empty and appear to be walled-in; and, despite the continual clamour\nof environmental sounds, very few of the sources for this sonic material enter the visual field. This\nis to say that the viewer is immediately situated within the titular `site'of Perel's first film, arguably\nthe most notorious of the Argentine CDCs operational during the military regime's self-styled\n`Dirty War', the `Escuela Superior de Mec\u00e1nica de la Armada' (Naval Academy of Mechanics,\nESMA). Over the period of systematic State terrorism some 5000 prisoners passed through the\ngates of ESMA (Colombo, 2012: 497) and the opening to Perel's film immediately recalls the\nnumerous testimonies which converge on their description of `the proximity of the desaparecidos\nto the everyday life of the city' despite their confinement (Bell, 2010: 77).5\nFollowing its mobile introduction, El predio returns to Perel's standard mode of technical com-\nposition and moves through a series of 100 shots from fixed camera positions containing only\ndiegetic sounds. As betrayed by this description, the temptation is to privilege the visual in analys-\ning Perel's work precisely because the shot has become the `the specific unit of cinema' (Chion,\n66\u00ad67), as film critic and experimental composer Michel Chion explains. While Chion (1994) goes\non to argue that there is no equivalent unit in the auditory field because the `image is bounded in\nspace, but sound is not'(p. 144), I want to suggest that in El predio, the order of primacy is inverted\nand the visual image is but `an act of framing, of enclosing environmental and unintended sounds\nin a moment of attention', as Kyle Gann (2010) summarises John Cage's description of his most\nAs is well known, Cage's `silent' composition, 4' 33\", is not in fact silent at all. Rather, it is\nfilled by unforeseen and ambient sounds which fill the performance space (Gann, 2010: 191).\nSubdivided into three discrete movements measuring 30seconds, 2minutes 23seconds, and 1min-\nseconds, respectively, Cage's work forces an attentiveness to the sounds surrounding the\naudience and renders both silence and time sonorous. So, too, in El predio the lack of a traditional\nsoundtrack paradoxically focusses the viewer's attention on the sounds that are heard, and the lack\nof movement in the camera makes them acutely aware of their own experience of time passing.\nNonetheless, as a musical happening, Cage's 4' 33\" necessarily situates the audience in (and is a\nreflection on) the `here' and `now' of the specific performance space. In contrast, El predio is\nalways situated in the `then' and `there' simply because it exists as a recorded text. Yet I would\ncontend that both Perel and Cage set out `to capture and control'environmental sounds in order `to\nuse them, not as sound effects, but as musical instruments'(Cage, 1997b: 380). Where Cage's work\nis centred on a performer on the stage, leading the audience to contemplate the nature and limits of\nmusical expression, the manipulation of sound in Perel is rather different. Chion (1994) notes that\nmodern cinema relies upon a `punctuative use of sound' to `modulate the meaning and rhythm of\na text'(pp. 48\u00ad49), yet Perel minimises the tools at his disposal to create this effect. By exclusively\nincluding environmental sounds in his film, Perel can only sonically punctuate his text through the\nselection of images. Thus, the montage of visual images becomes a form of experimental musical\nnotation `in the sense that John Cage gives to the word: what is produced at the time of the realiza-\ntion is not predetermined by the nature of the signs inscribed in the score'(Bosseur, 1993: 15). This\nis to say that, while El predio appears to lack a film score, it is the visual text, in fact, which is the\nscore. And, as I will go on to argue, it is this careful organisation and punctuative use of sound\nwhich uncovers the organising principle which underpins Perel's film: the construction of post-\ndictatorship memory in Argentina.\nThe testimonial site\nA billboard fills the screen. The rumble of traffic pools, swells, ripples and disorientates. Ascending and\ndescending simultaneously, the sound of traffic approaches and recedes but is never seen. A bird sings. The\nbillboard is shot from the reverse side, the text running backwards, legible but difficult to read. `Works\nPlan for All Argentines, Presidency of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, Project: National Memory Archive,\nFormer Naval Academy of Mechanics, Cost of the Project: $14,763,721.08, Argentina is All of Us'. Cut to\na security fence, slightly off-kilter, leaning to one side. A loose piece of tape moves slightly in the wind, the\nsound of the creases and crimps can just be heard over the distant roar of traffic. Marginally off-centre, a\nsign on the fence is clearly visible: `Danger Construction Site'. (Figure 2)\nPerel's first fixed shots set the tone for the rest of the film. El predio foregoes a focus on the most\nfamous and recognisable spaces within ESMA and instead utilises angles that are unusual and disori-\nentating such that it is frequently difficult (if not impossible) to identify specific buildings or locations.\nFor example, the following six shots catalogue materials and equipment required for the construction\nproject: 10 radiators upright on grass outside a building; tiles stacked against a wall; sinks and toilets\nremoved, broken and abandoned in the undergrowth; new bricks neatly arranged beside a pile of rub-\nble; port-a-loos and air conditioning ducts; scaffolding and safety fencing (Figure 3). Alterations in\nlight level make temporal identification challenging: shots cannot be placed in sequential order as the\ntime of day or year appears to vary sporadically. Occasionally, the soundtrack appears to aid the view-\ner's understanding by situating them in a specific place. The emergence of muffled echoes and slight\nreverberations alert the viewer that the camera has moved inside a building. In truth, however, it is only\nbecause the sonic disharmony is so bewildering that the viewer becomes hyperattentive to subtle alter-\nations in the acoustic field, and they provide only rudimentary information. Thus, Perel again appears\nGeraghty 5\nto repurpose the strategies employed by the dictatorship when it occupied the site. His unusual angles\necho the fact that `prisoners have spoken of being able to watch the legs of pedestrians passing out-\nside', just as the disconcerting arrangement of both sound and vision reflects the fact that the `brutality\nof torture and rape was accompanied by techniques designed to further defamiliarize the space of\nincarceration, such as blindfolding prisoners and leading them on different routes around the prison to\nenhance disorientation' (Scorer, 2016: 34). Perel, too, defamiliarises ESMA and disorientates his\nviewer. However, where such techniques were utilised by the dictatorship as part of `the pedagogies of\nFigure 2. Billboard shot from the reverse side. Still from El predio (2010).\nFigure 3. Construction waste. Still from El predio (2010).\ndisposal, destruction and reconversion of people' (Gonz\u00e1lez, 2005: 71), Perel exploits them to record\nthe same pedagogies being applied to the site itself. For what the film does capture is the conversion of\nthe former CDC into an `Espacio para la Memoria y para la Promoci\u00f3n y Defensa de los Derechos\nHumanos'(Space for Memory and for the Promotion and Defence of Human Rights), precisely as the\nfirst fixed shots suggest.\nIn order to fully appreciate the significance of Perel's film, it is necessary to understand that the\nstruggle over justice and memory has a complicated history inArgentina. Following President Ra\u00fal\nAlfons\u00edn's early success in overseeing the creation of the Comisi\u00f3n Nacional sobre la Desaparici\u00f3n\nde Personas (National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons, CONADEP); the publica-\ntion of their final report, Nunca m\u00e1s (Never Again, 1984); and the trial of the Argentine Junta in\n1985, Alfons\u00edn came under increasing pressure from sections of the military to change tack.\nSubsequently, Alfons\u00edn passed the Ley de Punto Final (Full Stop Law) in 1986 that set a date\nbeyond which new trials against the military could not be brought to court. This was followed in\n1987 by the Ley de Obediencia Debida (Law of Due Obedience) which established that subordi-\nnate personnel in the security forces could not be tried if they were following the orders of their\nsuperiors. The situation changed drastically once more when Carlos Sa\u00fal Menem was elected\npresident in 1989. Not only did Menem pardon those already convicted, but the discourse of his-\ntorical memory changed significantly during his administration. The initial `Teor\u00eda de los dos\ndemonios' (Two Demons Theory), which postulated that Argentine citizens had been caught in a\nconflict between the Military State and guerrilla groups who were both responsible for the vio-\nlence of the period, gave way to a history focussed on the brutality of the terrorist State. This was\nparticularly so following the confessions of Adolfo Scilingo and Mart\u00edn Balza in 1995. Contrary to\nthis development, however, throughout the 1990s the Menem government attempted to reframe\ndiscussions of the dictatorship within a discourse of `reconciliation'. Nonetheless, the Argentine\ncongress eventually repealed the Ley de Punto Final and the Ley de Obediencia Debida in 1998,\nand Judge Gabriel Cavallo proclaimed them unconstitutional and void in March of 2001. Following\nthe 2003 election of N\u00e9stor Kirchner, trials for crimes against humanity were reopened in 2006,\nthus overturning the Menem government's attempt to impose `reconciliation' on the population.\nThis work was continued by Kirchner's wife, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, when she assumed\nRegarding the ESMA site in particular, in January 1998, the Menem government sought to subdue\ndemands to overturn the amnesty laws by decreeing that ESMA should be demolished and replaced\nwith `a monument as a symbol of democratic co-existence among Argentines and their will to be rec-\nonciled with one another' (Da Silva Catela, 2015: 9). As Ludmila da Silva Catela (2015) notes, how-\never, with the passing of this presidential decree `a battle for memory began'(p. 9). Beginning in 1998,\nhuman rights groups used legal recourse to prevent the demolition and, following the intervention of\nthe City of Buenos Aires, it was first proposed in 2000 that ESMA should become `a space for mem-\nory' (Arenillas, 2013: 373). Nonetheless, it was only with the election of N\u00e9stor Kirchner \u00ad who had\nmade the cause of memory and justice one of the central tenets of his regime (Andermann, 2012: 78;\nLorenz and Winn, 2015: 39) \u00ad that the site was proclaimed a `Space for Memory and for the Promotion\nand Defence of Human Rights', and it didn't open its doors to the public until 2007. Multiple proposals\nfor converting the site were sought from human rights organisations sparking heated debates among\nartists, activists and intellectuals in newspapers and journals.7 Several public events were also organ-\ndebates, various government offices related to historical memory and several human rights organisa-\n2008: 30). Despite reclaiming the space, however, there was still `no consensus among the human\nrights organizations, let alone Argentine society at large, on how the former sites of State terrorism'\nGeraghty 7\ncould `be adequately \"recovered\", or what the purpose and function of such a recovery might be', as\nJens Andermann (2012: 76) notes. And, it is these very `debates about the construction of memory',\nwhich Perel has stated are at the centre of his filmic production (Perel and Feierstein, 2014: 110), that\nEl predio records precisely as they are spatially and architecturally enacted.\nVisually, the material effects that Perel records in the film's opening sequence are trapped in\nstasis, evidence of human activity that is absent from the screen. In contrast, the sound of traffic\ndrones continually, varying only in intensity. Birdsong emerges frequently yet intermittently, as the\ndistinctive rumble of a diesel engine in a piece of heavy equipment is heard then fades away. The\noccasional metallic echo of a hollow tube striking a solid surface pricks the attention. A succeeding\nshot taken from outside a building frames an open window in the centre of the screen. The gentle\nmurmur of what Chion (1994) calls `emanation speech' \u00ad speech which is heard but not fully com-\nprehended (p. 177) \u00ad can be perceived gently reverberating as it drifts through the window. Point\nof view and point of audition are reconciled throughout, but there is incongruity between what is\nseen and what is heard: stasis in the visual field, activity in the soundtrack. This disjunction between\nvisual emptiness and sonic plenitude opens a space for the viewer to reflect on the process which\nis underway. The focus on the material alteration of ESMA cannot but bring to mind the proposal\nsubmitted by the Asociaci\u00f3n de Ex Detenidos Desaparecidos (Association of Ex Detained and\nDisappeared Persons) who, uniquely, advocated the total conservation of ESMA as a `site-witness\nto genocide'. As they stated, `the conservation should be based on respect for the historic fabric of\nthe site, and should not distort the evidence that it possesses' and `the conservation should not\nallow any demolition or alteration that would have an adverse effect on the cultural value of the\nsite' (Brodsky, 2005: 215). In the first instance, then, disjunction between audio and visual tracks\nindirectly incorporates the voices of those who did not agree to the chosen plan for the site into the\nvery process of its enactment.\nIn discussing the diverse proposals submitted for reclaiming ESMA, and while recognising that\nthe majority combined different elements, Andermann broadly categorises the projects into three\ndistinct groups. First, he describes `the testimonial option which takes the entire site as unalterable\nheritage'. This is followed by `the museal option' which sought the contextualisation of `the site's\nmaterial evidence in ways that allow it to serve certain pedagogical functions, such as the inculca-\ntion of democratic values'. Finally, he defines `the performative option' which advocated entrust-\ning the site `to future-oriented artistic and political activities' in order to reclaim the space from\n`death and its executioners'(Andermann, 2012: 84\u00ad85). Thus far, the focus on seemingly insignifi-\ncant materials (radiators, toilets, walls and windows) assumes a testimonial weight. No detail is\nconsidered too inconsequential to be given considerable time for the viewer closely to examine the\ntactile qualities of each object, and the very act of cataloguing these items forces the audience to\nquestion what is relevant within `a site-witness to genocide'. Nonetheless, as the film progresses,\na select few human personages do emerge into the visual field, and their activities correspond to\nthe `performative option' described by Andermann. Moreover, the suturing of sound and vision\nultimately transforms the film into a work of `museal' art, although in a different manner than in\nAndermann's initial summation, as we shall later see.\nThe first performative movement\nA hand is seen in close-up on the left side of the screen. Holding a pencil, it sketches rapidly on a rough\nsurface. A soft, gossamer shadow dances across skin stretched taught over veins and tendons. Silence\nrumbles. The faint traces of the pencil scratching the surface can be heard. Incomplete, the drawing\nappears to include a row of teeth just below the hand. Cut to two holes and markings on a wall for thirty\nseconds. A door creaks; an unidentifiable high-pitched sound is heard. Cut to a close up of the drawing:\nan unusual skull framed in the centre of the screen. The artist's body is hunched, cross-legged, occupying\nthe left vertical edge. A straight line of light, parallel with this boundary, divides the space. The artist sits\nin darkness; the drawing is bathed in golden light. He is drawing on a wall. Various pencils lie scattered\non a sheet of bubble wrap on the floor. Sound continues as before, rumbling silence and scratching. Cut to\na wider shot. The artist occupies the corner of a dimly lit room. A projector throws a square of light onto\nthe facing wall, the bottom edge aligned with the base of the wall. The artist traces the image onto the\nsurface. The wall contains numerous holes which have been filled, but not finished. Birdsong is heard.\n(Figure 4)\nA grey external wall shot from a low angle. Tall grass stands in the foreground, the wall in the background,\nlow cropped grass lays in-between. The wall is split horizontally; the lower part is rough and dark, the\nupper section smooth and light. Irregular lighter and darker areas reveal where the wall has been patched.\nA dull rectangular metal box is inset in the wall on the right side of the screen; an old wooden plank stands\nprecariously against it. On the leftward edge a thin dark red tube enters the screen, runs along the wall's\nhorizontal divide, turns ninety degrees and enters the wall. A thicker vermillion pipe curves out the same\nentry point and extends straight down into the ground. The left hand side of the middle ground is marked\noff with sagging red tape. There are traces of brown among the mottled greens and yellows of the grass in\nthis area. The rumble of traffic ascends and descends, the tall grass sways haphazardly in the breeze,\ninsects drift across the screen. Cut to a wider angle of the same scene. The tall grass has been cut back,\nthe tape delineates a rectangular area. The deep browns now reveal that the ground has been disturbed.\nSound continues as before. Cut to a close-up of a hoe striking and breaking the ground while a rake turns\nover the earth in a corner of the designated area. The audible sound has changed; a low-quality\ntransmission of tinny music booms, blends and interferes with the environmental sounds. Cut-away to the\nfull bodies of two people (one female, one male) using the tools and turning the earth. The radio broadcast\nis louder and clearer, rock guitar can be discerned.\nIt is some 12minutes (almost a quarter of the film) before the first human agent is seen in El\npredio. With almost perfect symmetry, this artist will be revealed to be Javier Barrio installing his\nwork `Museo del Gliptodonte' (Museum of the Gliptodonte), three quarters of the way through, in\nFigure 4. A hand sketches on the wall. Still from El predio (2010).\nGeraghty 9\nthe 46th minute. An intermediate sequence is included in the film's 37th minute. Similarly, the film\nwill eventually divulge that the second shot sequence described introduces Marina Etchegoyen\ninstalling her work `Cosechar/Multiplicar' (To Harvest/To Multiply). As a close-up of an informa-\ntional board included in the film explains, the work is an `Artistic action./ To make memory and\nthink of the future. To sow potatoes,/ in the earth of ESMA./ To reproduce and harvest energy'. In\nboth instances, the soundtrack plays a fundamental role in capturing and transmitting debates con-\ncerning the performative use of the ESMA compound to the audience. The sound of the radio\naccompanying Etchegoyen working the ground in ESMA is the first time recognisable music is\nheard in Perel's film. In addition, when the Barrio sequence concludes, it is the only shot sequence\nwhich does not feature any ambient sounds. Instead, it is accompanied by the artist's sound instal-\nlation, `Yo soy el gliptodonte' (I am the Gliptodonte). Thus, the soundscape becomes fully per-\nformative and, for a few minutes, is entirely dominated by a work funded by a grant from the\nFondo Nacional de las Artes (National Fund for the Arts) under the auspices of the `Espacio\nCultural Nuestros Hijos' (Our Children's Cultural Space, ECUNHI), the cultural centre within\nESMA created and organised by the Asociaci\u00f3n Madres de Plaza de Mayo (Mothers of Plaza de\nmusic or a more traditional soundtrack immediately recalls arguments such as that made by artist\nMagdalena Jitrik who declared herself `totally against making a song to life in a concentration\ncamp'(Brodsky et al., 2004: 61). These punctuative uses of sound thus lead to a profound disagree-\nment among those who submitted proposals for the reclamation of ESMA. On one hand, there were\nthose such as Hebe de Bonafini (leader of theAsociaci\u00f3n Madres de Plaza de Mayo) who expressed\nno interest in `the idea of a museum of horror' arguing that `[m]useums are associated with death'\nOn the other hand, groups such as the Asociaci\u00f3n de Ex Detenidos Desaparecidos argued forcibly\nthat `where there was death [...] one should not pretend that now there is life' (Vezzetti, 2006: 39).\nIt appears that the testimonial option which opened El predio coexists with the performative option\nover the length of the film.The shot sequence immediately following the introduction to Etchegoyen\n(which in turn immediately follows the first Barrio progression) would appear to confirm this\nhypothesis: Perel's camera returns inside a building and includes three shots in almost total dark-\nness with only slivers of bright light entering the frame. One of only two arrangements of images\nshot in darkness in the entirety of Perel's filmic output (the second is also encountered in El predio)\nthis immediately connotes the stark reality of imprisonment, torture and death after introducing life\ninto ESMA.\nThe second performative movement\nIn the darkness, thin strips of golden light break through the narrow spaces between closed shutters and\nfall on a wall opposite. The light is vectorised. Just enough luminance bleeds from the bottom left corner\nof the frame, radiating out, upwards and to the right, for a window to be identified. Bathed in crepuscular\nlight an object fixed to the wall is discernible, yet difficult to classify. Ambient sounds are heavily muted\nand too faint to determine their source. Cut to a space which is darker still. The multiple shafts of light\nhave been replaced by two groups of three bands. The uppermost strips curve, revealing three thin metallic\nobjects, semi-circular in form, reflecting light whose origin cannot be traced to source. Three thicker\nbands with less definition seep from the leftward endpoint of the arcs, revealing smooth planes extending\ndownwards. The endpoints of the diameter define the limits of these flat surfaces, which are dark and\ncomposed of a warmer material. Another cut returns us to the first shot, but time has shifted. The brilliant\nstrips have disappeared, yet a fainter glow still emanates from the same corner of the window frame. A new\nobject occupies the centre of the frame. A solitary surface is illuminated on each of a series of elongated\nrectangular cuboids. These, in turn, are arranged in a triangular form. There is more sonic activity. A high\npitched almost electrical crackle endures for several seconds. Is it the sound of adhesive tape being peeled\nfrom its roll? There are rapid dull thuds that could be distant footfall elsewhere in the building, and the\nfaintest trace of muffled speech, so delicate that one cannot be sure. A black shadow moves up the screen.\nAs it ascends, the foremost edge is briefly illuminated forming the silhouette of an arm and a head, leading\nto the conclusion that the original object is a step-ladder. Longitudinal waves of light appear, undulate\nmomentarily and disappear. Cut to a brightly illuminated room, an auditorium filled with neat rows of\nfoldable chairs. Half are occupied with people facing a white wall flanked by large black speakers. In the\nrearmost bank, only three chairs enter the frame. The backs are matte black, smooth and enclosed in strips\nof aluminuium, curved across the top of the chairback and straight-edged from the endpoints of the curve.\nTheir form confirms it is the same room and the same shot as before. There is the murmur of conversation,\nidentifiable but indiscernible. Blocks of light are extinguished with a click until the room is pitch black.\nWhite text appears in the upper part of the the screen. Illegible, its form is nontheless recognisable as the\nopening credits of a film. (Figure 5)\nThus begins the second performative movement that appears intermittently throughout El pre-\ndio: a series of film screenings and public discussions that take place within ESMA. The first\nimage, in particular, cannot but evoke `the darkness, the silence, and the immobility' experienced\nby those detained in the camp (Calveiro, 1998: 48, original emphasis). The sequence once again\nquestions the value of establishing a programme of education or entertainment in the former site of\ntorture and extermination. The subtle composition of the individual shots, however, reveals addi-\ntional formal elements consistently found throughout the film which add further depth to the\ndebates over the future of the site. As before, the muffled soundscape draws the viewer's attention\nto subtle changes in the auditory field. In this instance, however, the minimal use of light performs\nthe same function: the viewer peers more keenly in an attempt to perceive the underlying image. In\nhis writings, Cage (1997a) has suggested that attentiveness to incidental sound can be found `in the\nfields of modern sculpture and architecture' due to the fact that there is `no such thing as an empty\nspace or an empty time' and that there `is always something to see, something to hear' (p. 384).\nExtending the premise further, he argues that the ability visually to perceive multiple phenomena\nsimultaneously and to allow the eye to wander between them reveals `a new sense of polyphony'\n(Bosseur, 1993: 132, original emphasis). So, too, Perel discovers this same visual polyphony\nFigure 5. Light breaking through a shuttered window. Still from El predio (2010).\nthrough the use of deep focus: everything on screen is given at once and the viewer's eye is free to\nroam. The stillness of the take ensures that the audience are attentive to the `visual microrhythms',\nthose `rapid movements on the image's surface'(Chion, 1994: 15\u00ad16), such as shifting shadows or\nripples of wind passing through leaves or grass, that are present throughout El predio. The dark\nopening to the film screening sequence simply accentuates these qualities and demonstrates that,\nin Perel's work, even visual phenomena are experienced primarily as sound.\nAs the cinematic sequence continues, Perel records the film screenings themselves. The images\nprojected against the wall are clearly discernible and at certain key points, the text is puncutated by\nambient sounds which crystallise into perceptible speech and music. In the second projection, for\nexample, a woman's head composed of pale blue light occupies the centre of the screen. A series\nof parallel black creases across the image alert the viewer to the fact that the image is projected\nonto the shuttered window they have seen previously. The woman's face is in continual yet minor\nmotion; micro-movements in the muscles of the face betray an affective intensity which cannot,\nhowever, be decoded. The drone of the projector is accompanied by the unfocussed, deep timbre of\na male voice and the echoing vibrato of interference suggests the sound accompanies the projected\nimage. The listener must strain to decipher the vocal sounds but, gaining slightly in clarity, it\nbecomes apparent that the language spoken is not Spanish, as would be reasonably expected, but is\nin fact French. When the woman responds, her voice accompanied by the movement of her lips,\nthis is confirmed, but the fragments of discernible speech never provide sufficient information to\ndecipher the scene.\nThe subsequent clip leads to a possible interpretation of these movements. Grainy colour film stock\nages the image and places us in the past. The low rumble of voices in unison engaged in a call and\nresponse with the cry of a solitary voice, the wail of a siren, and images of an unruly multitude carrying\nbanners and flags situate the audience in a protest march. A blurry glimpse of riot police in line con-\nfirms this proposition. The following image of women in white headscarves marching while carrying\nportraits of young men appears to fix the viewer in time and space. But the image betrays, and it is the\naudio track that reveals the deception.9 As the voices become discernible, the language they are speak-\ning is not Spanish. This time, however, a subtitle track appears on the screen Perel records and reads\n`\u00a1Ocalan estamos contigo!' (\u00d6calan we are with you!). The protest is in Turkey, the march in support\nof the co-founder of the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK),Abdullah \u00d6calan. The signifiers slip, and the\naudience take a bewildering leap through time and space. The white headscarves, the protest march\nand the following subtitles \u00ad `Viva la lucha guerrillera'(Long live the armed struggle!), `Los derechos\ndel pueblo no pueden suspenderse'(The rights of the people cannot be suspended!) \u00ad would not seem\nout of place in the recuperated ESMA.10 Yet, the refrains the audience listen to (with the eye as much\nas the ear) are uprooted and connect with other `block[s] of space-time constituted by the periodic\nrepetition of the component' (Deleuze and Guattari, 2010: 345). This is to say that these progressions\nfunction as Deleuzo-Guattarian refrains, those sonorous or visual patterns which construct a territory\nconsisting of a `point of stability, a circle of property and an opening to the outside' when reproduced\n(Bogue, 1991: 88). The projection screen provides a point of stability, while the audience seated in the\nforeground delineate the theatre-territory, and the filmic texts continually open ESMAto events taking\nplace beyond its spatio-temporal confines. As Deleuze and Guattari (2010) assert, the `territorial\nassemblage' produced by the refrain `is inseparable from lines or coefficients of deterritorialization,\npassages, and relays toward other assemblages'(p. 367) and the `deterritorialization of refrains \u00ad their\ndisconnection from their territory \u00ad is what they call music' (Murphie, 1996: 21). The screening\nsequence is thus a musical projection during which the audience witness the de- and re-territorializa-\ntion of the refrain and the leaps through space-time this entails.\nWhen El predio returns to a second sequence of film projections, the works shown reterritorial-\nize the refrain and return the audience to the specifically Argentine context. In the first case, Perel\nrecords Azucena Maizani singing `La canci\u00f3n de Buenos Aires' (The Song of Buenos Aires) in the\nopening credit sequence of the film \u00a1Tango! (1933), the firstArgentine film to feature synchronised\nspeech and optical sound (Navitski, 2011: 43). In this way, Perel confirms the importance of both\nsound and music to his film. Given the politically charged nature of the site, however, it is impor-\ntant to note that the film was released (and hence the audience are temporally situated) in the midst\nof the `D\u00e9cada Infame' (Infamous Decade), the name given to `a 13-year period of military and\nfraudulently elected governments' which began with `the first military overthrow of an elected\ngovernment' in Argentina (Hedges, 2011: 46).11 The subsequent film screening depicts a couple\ndancing on a stage while a solitary figure plays guitar and sings. The male dancer is in a wheel-\nchair, yet it is the musical accompaniment that is especially evocative. The song performed is\nimmediately recognisable as Le\u00f3n Gieco's `La memoria' (Memory). The audience clearly hear\nGieco's denunciation of `the deception and the complicity/ of those who committed genocide and\nremain free/ the pardons and the \"Punto Final\"', and they are immediately (and sonically) returned\nto the long struggle for justice following the dictatorship's brutal and systematic policy of State\nterrorism. Yet the song is another temporal signifier which slips, having famously appeared during\nthe concluding sequence of Trist\u00e1n Bauer's film of the Falklands-Malvinas conflict, Iluminados\npor el fuego (Enlightened by Fire, 2005). If the inclusion of \u00a1Tango! situated the audience in the\nperiod immediately following the first military coup and dictatorship in Argentine history, then the\nincorporation of Gieco's `La memoria' ultimately transports them to the calamitous war which\nmarked the beginning of the end of the military's most recent reign of terror. The sequence thus\nleads the audience to contemplate the cyclical emergence of military coups and State repression\nwhich continued throughout the twentieth century in Argentina.\nThe question remains, however, of how these movements of the refrain are to be understood\nwithin the wider context of Perel's film and the transformation of ESMA into an `Espacio de la\nMemoria'. The simple fact that the film screenings contain more human bodies than are found\nanywhere else in the film cannot but remind the viewer that, while the original debates over the fate\nof ESMA were directed towards `groups specifically interested in the theme', it was repeatedly\nstressed that the debate `should progressively pass over to be society's patrimony'(Pastoriza, 2005:\n85).12 The second related point is that various proposals sought not only to expand the audience for\nthe museum, but its content as well. For example, a proposal submitted by numerous organisations\nsuggested that the museum within ESMA `should give voice to minorities, to those forgotten in\nhistory and in museums' (Brodsky, 2005: 215),13 a sentiment echoed through the inclusion in\nPerel's film of those with disabilities dancing to a protest song commemorating the victims of State\nrepression. Yet, as we have seen, the movement of the filmic refrain in El predio expands the con-\ntent of the museum much further than this. The screening sequences give a sense of global and\nplural histories, generate multiple viewpoints on the events being commemorated, and fulfil argu-\nments such as that put forward by Montserrat Iniesta that `historical museums', such as that planned\nfor ESMA, `cannot limit themselves to transmitting [...] univocal historical events' (Brodsky,\n2005: 204). Thus, those debates over the construction of memory within the ESMAsite run through\nthese sequences as they do throughout the entire film. As we shall later see, however, the film\nsequences serve another important function.\nThe third performative movement\nAn external wall fills the screen. In the centre of the frame a lower wall extends forwards dividing the\nspace. A man in a black coat and jeans stands on the right of the division, facing in the same direction. He\nis three-quarters turned and only the back of his head is visible. One leg slightly forward, hunched, he\nsteadies himself as he holds a camera at chest height. He slowly pans the camera from left to right. Noise\nis minimal, a low level hum, the song of a solitary bird. The man completes the turn and, standing side on,\nstrides out of shot to the right.\nThis meta-textual moment is sustained over several shots as Perel's camera records a man wield-\ning a camera and recording unusual angles of the buildings within the ESMA compound. The figure\nappears almost as a cypher for Perel himself except for one key feature: the panning of the camera.14\nLater, Perel records a metal filing cabinet in a cluttered room, the word `grant'scrawled on the front\nof a partially opened drawer. The following shot features a projection of the man's recording but\nwith no audience in attendance. Perel's camera cuts to a window, shot from the inside looking out.\nThis is the first of only two occasions in which direct speech from the moment of recording is dis-\ntinctly heard. Only a fragment of the conversation is contained in the film. The man begins to pro-\npose a project (unnamed or described) to take place in a former CDC in Tucum\u00e1n province. Two\nother voices interviewing the man are clearly distinguishable but never seen.Afinal shot records the\nyoung man alone in a waiting room as muffled inaudible voices talk off-screen. The minimal detail\nprovided about the planned project serves to generalise the proposal to the extent that it could stand\nfor any proposal. Moreover, as the point of decision is absent from the text, the discussion itself is\ntrapped in a perpetual present. Thus, Perel manages `to foment and sustain permanent interpellation'\n(Naftal, 2005: 192), a key objective articulated in numerous proposals for the ESMA museum.\nChion (1994) has proposed that ambient sound in film `renders the perception of time in the\nimage as exact, detailed, immediate, [and] concrete' (p. 13). From the outset, El predio alludes to\ndebates surrounding the fate of ESMA and the immediacy of the environmental sounds transpose\nthem into a suspended, yet perpetual, present. Indeed, the early establishing shot of a sign declaring\n`Peligro: area en construcci\u00f3n' (Danger Construction Site), cannot but recall the title of the book\nedited by Marcelo Brodsky which compiled the various proposals for the ESMA site and key texts\ndebating those same proposals: Memoria en construcci\u00f3n (Memory in Construction, 2005). From\nthe outset, Perel's film like the book serves as `a call for the contribution of ideas, and for perma-\nnent debate' (Indij, 2005: 43), and it is not only the ambient sound which situate this debate in a\ncontinuous yet ever-changing present. As Chion (1994) notes, the `camera, though excluded from\nthe visual field, is nonetheless an active character in films' (p. 93). While this is the case in every\nfilm, it is especially so in El predio. Within Perel's film, there is never a subjective point of view\nwithin which a `character in the story is (apparently) seeing what I [the viewer] see' (Chion, 1994:\n`movement is perception, the glance, the eye. But the eye is not the too-immobile human eye; it is\nthe eye of the camera' (p. 40). Unlike Vertov, however, Perel almost entirely excludes `the camera-\nman who follows, runs, enters, [and] exits', and his film exhibits none of Vertov's formal experi-\nmentation, thus reducing the role of the filmmaker to a minimum. Yet both directors create montage\nthrough the `choice of material, that is, the portions of matter which are to enter into interaction'\n(Deleuze, 1986: 40) and obtain `objectivity'\u00ad defined as the ability `to carry perception into things,\nto put perception into matter'(Deleuze, 1986: 81) \u00ad albeit in a different manner. In Perel's case, the\nexperience of watching El predio is somewhat akin to a description found in Bergson's Duration\nand Simultaneity in which Bergson (1965) imagines that\nWhen we are seated on the bank of a river, the flowing of the water, the gliding of a boat or the flight of a\nbird, the ceaseless murmur in our life's deeps are for us three separate things or only one, as we choose.\nWe can interiorize the whole, dealing with a single perception that carries along the three flows, mingled,\nin its course; or we can leave the first two outside and then divide our attention between the inner and the\nouter; or, better yet, we can do both at one and the same time, our attention uniting and yet differentiating\nthe three flows, thanks to its singular privilege of being one and several. (p. 52)\nFrom this point, Bergson (1965) argues that all three flows ultimately `occupy the same dura-\ntion' and therefore that `this duration is ours only when our consciousness is concerned with us\nalone, but it becomes equally theirs when our attention embraces the three flows in a single indivis-\nible act' (p. 52). Thus, what appeared initially to refer to the subjective experience of time, dura-\ntion, is shown to reside in external objects and is endowed `with the power to encompass itself'\n(Deleuze, 1988: 80). So, too, in El predio: the work incorporates the viewer's duration into the\nfilm's temporal milieu. As in Vertov, perception passes into the objects themselves precisely\nbecause it is the viewer who is held within the long duration of the inanimate objects depicted. At\nthis stage, however, another phenomenon emerges. Unlike Man with a Movie Camera, where\nVertov blends two images to show the audience the omniscient `camera-eye', in Perel's film, the\nviewer's eye and the camera are perfectly synchronised in their total immobility. Perception passes\ninto the things captured by the camera-eye but, simultaneously, it is the viewer's eye which\nbecomes the camera.\nViewed in this way, the film screenings that Perel contains within El predio take on an addi-\ntional function. Perel's camera records beams of light projected onto a screen, which reflects the\nlight back to a camera which traps it. When this new film is subsequently projected onto another\nscreen, the synchronisation of camera and viewer's eye ensures that the movement becomes an\ninfinite regression. The viewer-camera will record the light projected, as it will be projected again\nand recorded anew, and so on, ad infinituum. The visual and the sonic use different means to obtain\nthe same effect: they both trap the viewer in a perpetual present, somewhat akin to `the experience\nof time felt by those detained/disappeared within the Clandestine Detention Centres: a suspended\ntemporality consisting of a present that left no place for a before or an after, an \"absolute now\"', as\nsuggested by Pamela Colombo (2010: 3\u00ad4). Yet, the movement of the refrain, its continual de- and\nre-territorialization, ensures that this continual `now'is dynamic and perpetually revitalised. In this\nway, the debates that are the subject matter of El predio are renewed at every turn and ceaselessly\nperpetuated.\nThe museum as spatio-temporal event\nAn auditorium. Four rows of chairs are visible, shot from behind. Three seats are occupied. In the\nbackground facing the audience is a table with four chairs, set up for a public discussion. Audible but\nunintelligible speech is heard. An older woman and two men enter from the right, they converse as the\nwoman prepares to take her place on the panel. The conversation is not heard. One man leaves, the woman\nsits down, the second man moves to take a place on the panel, another man joins the audience. Cut to a\nmedium shot of the woman sitting at the table. Her face is directed downwards, reflective, perhaps dejected.\nBeside her a man has his hand on her back, comforting her. The murmur of the audience assembling and\ntalking amongst themselves is heard. Cut to a full shot of a man with a sophisticated camera standing\nbeside a woman with a small portable camera. They stand at the side of the stage, recording the audience.\nThe backs of chairs and heads are visible in the foreground. A voice is heard. (Figure 6)\nGiven Perel's insistence that his films `promote debate and produce open questions, negating\nevery type of didacticism' (Perel and Feierstein, 2014: 114), it is not surprising that El predio has\nbeen subject to numerous contradictory interpretations. For example, with regard to Perel's inclu-\nsion of Marina Etchegoyen's `Cosechar/Multiplicar', Rafael McNamara (2012) argues that it\nshould be understood as an attempt `to capture the site that was synonymous with death and torture\nalmost as if it were a living organism, at the moment of its (re)birth' (p. 33). In contrast, Mar\u00eda\nGuadalupe Arenillas (2013) analyses a later close-up of the harvested potatoes lying on an old\nnewspaper to suggest that `the potatoes spoil on the pages of the Wall Street Journal, like a revolu-\ntionary project which ended under the power of foreign capital' and that `even though it aims \"to\nharvest energy,\" there is also something about these young people digging which reminds us of, or\ntakes us to, the work camps, or the search for bones' (pp. 384\u00ad385). In a far less positive reading,\nhowever, cultural critic Quint\u00edn first recognises that the work possibly alludes to themes of renewal,\nbefore arguing that `the film also permits the opposite interpretation: that the occupation of ESMA\nby political organisations and their activists' alters the site rather than preserves it. That by engag-\ning in the projects of the present, the site produces `a policy of forgetting in place of a policy of\nmemory'. Quint\u00edn finds this argument confirmed in two shots near the conclusion of the film: one\nconsists of an image of a military monument that has had its identifying plaque removed. The other\nis a plaque commemorating Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner and N\u00e9stor Kirchner's role inaugurat-\ning the space. For Quint\u00edn (2010), this demonstrates `the transformation' which ESMA `has suf-\nfered thanks to the teaching of the new century' and echoes his belief that it has been co-opted into\nparty politics. Nonetheless, in interview, Perel (Reale and Perel, 2011) has acknowledged that El\npredio was only made possible due to this substitution and stated that it `reveals everything that has\nchanged in ESMA', an ambiguous statement which need not be interpreted in the critical manner\nadopted by Quint\u00edn.\nThis ambiguity thus leads to another fundamental question which was subject to considerable\ndebate during the process of reconverting ESMA into an `Espacio de la Memoria': the role of the\nState. As Da Silva Catela (2015) notes, from the beginning of the twenty-first century, the Kirchner\nadministrations established and implemented a new state-led memory politics by creating impor-\ntant archives, cultural centres and memorial sites, and incorporating cultural memory into public\npolicy through numerous initiatives (pp. 10\u00ad11). However, given that the Kirchner administrations\nwere particularly polarising, these projects were not without their serious detractors. Regarding the\nreconversion of ESMA, the most forceful critique arguably came from Hugo Vezzetti (2006) who,\nin 2006, claimed that the numerous proposals submitted `have not provoked any public discussion'\n(p. 37). Indeed, Vezzetti (2006) would argue that `that which has not changed is the absence of a\nstate function capable of promoting public deliberation, including other voices and other constel-\nlations of ideas' (p. 38). As Quint\u00edn demonstrates, Vezzetti's critique can easily be read into El\npredio. For example, the simple fact that the assessment of a potential artwork to be installed at a\nformer CDC takes place off-screen, that we learn nothing about the project itself, and that both the\nartist and the assessors remain entirely anonymous, arguably reflects Vezzetti's (2006) critique that\nFigure 6. Comforting a speaker at a public discussion. Still from El predio (2010).\n`the human rights organisations were, in fact, the organisers' of an `act intended for few' (p. 38).\nPerel's establishing shot of the information board announcing the transformation of ESMA shot\nfrom the reverse side could easily be interpreted in the same manner. Nonetheless, it is important\nto note that the role of the State was consistently discussed, debated and critiqued by the human\nrights organisations and activists who sought to reclaim the site. For example, Guido Indij (2005)\nargued that the question of how to represent memories of the dictatorship was one which could not\nbe left to the State (p. 43). Similarly, the proposal submitted by the Buena Memoria, Asociaci\u00f3n\nCivil (Good Memory Civil Association), argued against leaving the site empty because it would\nserve as an `an invitation so that, if there were political regressions in the country, the place could\nbe converted into that which the authorities of the time determine' (Brodsky, 2005: 216). Bruno\nGroppo, Nicol\u00e1s Guagnini and Marcelo Brodsky also discussed the role of the State at length as\nthey searched for a method of financing the project that could `limit the influence of political dif-\nficulties' (Brodsky et al., 2004: 53\u00ad59). The proposal submitted by the activist organisation Hijos\npor la Identidad y la Justicia Contra el Olvido y el Silencio (Sons and Daughters for Identity and\nJustice against Forgetting and Silence, HIJOS) also stated categorically that the ESMA site `should\nnot be subject to fluctuations in the government' (Brodsky, 2005: 220). These fears gained magni-\ntude when Mauricio Macri was elected head of the government of Buenos Aires in 2007 as he\nappeared `indifferent' to the cause of the human rights organisations and it was suspected that he\n`may come to stall or eventually foreclose ongoing memorial projects such as those taking place in\nand around ESMA' (Di Paolantonio, 2008: 36). Such fears were at least partially realised when\nMacri was elected President in 2015 and proceeded to slash the human rights budget by some 15%\nIt appears, then, that discussions of the role of the State within the reclaimed ESMA can be\nbroadly divided into two groups. On one hand, there were those that feared that excessive reliance\non the State could lead to future problems with subsequent changes in government following the\nKirchner administrations.15 On the other, there were those who feared that the present role assigned\nto the Kirchner-led State would unnecessarily politicise post-dictatorship memory to the detriment\nof society. In his critique of Vezzetti's position, Andermann (2012) notes that he ultimately\nembraced the proposal submitted by the Centro de Estudios Legales y Sociales (Centre of Legal\nand Social Studies, CELS) `accusing the government and the other human rights groups of thwart-\ning, with their \"clientelist\" claims to the site, the occasion for constructing a democratic consensus'\n(p. 89).16 Within Perel's film, however, each of these positions is sustained simultaneously.\nMoreover, by trapping these debates within a perpetual and inescapable present, there is no hope\nof ever reaching a consensus precisely because the unusual arrangement of shots and the careful\nmusical manipulation of sound and light never allows the site to coalesce into a cohesive `place',\nunderstood as a site held together `by personal and common values, and by the maintenance of\nthose values over time, as memory', as Jeff Kelly defines the term (Till, 2008: 108). Instead, Perel's\nfilm produces a different sense of `place' altogether.\nAs we have seen, El predio builds upon Bergson's philosophical proposal that duration is not\nonly a subjective experience, but that it also resides in external objects. In For Space, Doreen\nMassey (2005) proposes that this same principle `pointed to a radical change in the potential con-\nceptualisation of space' such that it became `the dimension of a multiplicity of durations [...], a\nsimultaneity of stories-so-far' (p. 24). Within this conception, Massey (2005) argues that space\nmust be considered `the product of interrelations [...], from the immensity of the global to the\nintimately tiny' and that it should be recognised `as always under construction' (p. 9). The connec-\ntion with Perel's film is immediately apparent. In El predio, ESMA is perpetually `under construc-\ntion' precisely because the film sustains multiple positions simultaneously, and the site is revealed\nto be the product of both global and intimately local interactions. In this way, Perel ensures that the\ntitular site becomes a place which is both `open' and `internally multiple' (Massey, 2005: 141),\nperfectly in keeping with Massey's (2005) description of places `as temporary constellations where\nthe repercussions of a multiplicity of histories have been woven together' (p. 145) such that they\nbecome `spatio-temporal events' (p. 130). As in Andermann's (2012) `museal option', then, El\npredio promotes continual debate and discussion through its arrangement of `the site's material\nevidence'. Rather than serving to inculcate `democratic values' (p. 85), however, Perel's film\ndenies the possibility of reaching a consensus and even explores that which is potentially excluded\nwithin the very conception of democratic citizenship itself, as we shall now see.\nIn his analysis of the function of the reconverted ESMA, Andermann (2012) notes that the same\nprinciple which underpins Vezzetti's argument is also `implicit in the more cautious proposals\nsubmitted by CELS or Buena Memoria', namely, that their calls for `inclusiveness' and an open-\nness to multiple visitor responses to the site is `warranted by an institutional mandate granted by\nthe State on behalf of a \"social consensus\" that pre-establishes the limits of this very multiplicity'\nin defining values such as democracy and tolerance as the goal towards which visitor performance,\nhowever open and multiple, must nonetheless strive, the museum encounter turns here into a pedagogy of\nde-identification with the victims' historical struggles (those of the militant left of the 1960s and 1970s).\nIn adopting this position,Andermann closely aligns himself with observations such as that made\nby Andreas Huyssen that, in Argentina, the militants of the 1960s and 1970s had to be forgotten in\norder to construct `a national memory consensus that revolves around the figure of the disappeared\ntarget of Vezzetti's attacks is the \"partisan\" memory of victims and their relatives [...] that refuses\nto acknowledge the pastness of the traumatic events as a precondition for their commemoration'\n(p. 91). Examples of this type of `partisan' memory can be found in several of the other proposals\nsubmitted for the site. For example, Hebe de Bonafini argued that the art school advanced by the\nAsociaci\u00f3n Madres de Plaza de Mayo should include `a site dedicated to learning about the \"ideals\nof the 1970s\" and the accomplishments and aspirations for social justice of the disappeared' (Di\nPaolantonio, 2008: 26). This idea is even more forcibly expressed in the proposal submitted by\nHIJOS which sought to include the history of the militants and their `struggle for a better world'\nincluded in the site, `making it completely clear that it was not a defeat', and linking this history to\nEl predio undoubtedly shares similar concerns to Andermann and numerous shots include refer-\nences to previous periods of militant activity within the film. For example, Perel's camera records\ngraffiti sprayed on a wall within ESMA which states `solidaridad' (solidarity) and `compromiso'\n(commitment). The subsequent shot is of the central character from H\u00e9ctor Germ\u00e1n Oesterheld's\ncomic El Eternauta stencilled on a wall in the compound. Oesterheld's science fiction comic was,\nof course, overtly political and written to denounce the crimes of the military government. Moreover,\nOesterheld and his daughters joined the Peronist militant group the `Montoneros'and all were disap-\npeared by the dictatorship. Finally, Oesterheld adhered to the conception of the `intelectual compro-\nmetido'(committed intellectual) and thus these two simple shots allude not only to the actions of the\nmilitant groups of the 1970s but also to their intellectual underpinnings.17 Subsequent shots in\nPerel's film include portraits of Che Guevara stacked haphazardly in a storeroom and images of\nRodolfo Walsh's `Open Letter from a Writer to the Military Junta' pasted on a wall within the site.\nThe opening phrases of Walsh's letter are clearly visible to the audience and one is again reminded\nthat Walsh, too, had been a member of the Montoneros and was tragically disappeared. The very fact\nthat these visual allusions to the militants of earlier periods appear in Perel's film in the form of graf-\nfiti, oppositional and illegal in its very nature, and portraits abandoned in a storeroom reflect that\nthese elements remain beyond the limit of the civilised discussions over the future of the site. All of\nthis seems to confirm Andermann's hypothesis and demonstrate an attempt on Perel's part to ensure\nthat the militants of the 1970s and their goals are not excluded from the site. The subsequent intru-\nsion of sound, however, further complicates this picture.\nDuring a short sequence, the viewer witnesses a round-table discussion being set up before cut-\nting to an alternative angle to frame two people recording the event. The cameras are both directed\nat the audience and, in the second and final instance of direct speech recorded in the film, a wom-\nan's voice is heard off-screen. It is that of Blanca Santucho thanking former president N\u00e9stor\nKirchner for ordering that a search be conducted for the bodies of Mario Roberto Santucho (her\nbrother) and Benito Urteaga.18 Both men were leaders in the `Partido Revolucionario de los\nTrabajadores' (Revolutionary Workers Party, PRT) and its armed guerrilla wing the `Ej\u00e9rcito\nRevolucionario del Pueblo' (People's Revolutionary Army, ERP). They died together at the hands\nVoz, 2012). Doubtless, Perel demonstrates at this stage that memories of the militants of previous\ngenerations were afforded a place within ESMA, and the use of direct speech (almost entirely\nabsent from the rest of the film) serves to mark their importance. While the sequence could easily\nbe read in line with Vezzetti's critique of the politicisation of the past, the affective resonance of the\nestablishing shot of Blanca Santucho waiting to speak, looking downwards, dejected and mourn-\nful, would contradict this interpretation. It would seem rather to suggest that Andermann's critique\nof Vezzetti could also be applied to the Kirchner administrations. As this sequence demonstrates,\nN\u00e9stor Kirchner identified himself as a participant in the revolutionary processes of the 1970s and\nsought to bring their cause within his government (Lorenz and Winn, 2015: 39). Therefore, the\nKirchner administration could never be accused of attacking `the \"partisan\" memory of victims\nand their relatives'(Andermann, 2012: 91). Nonetheless, as such actions continue to be `warranted\nby an institutional mandate granted by the State' (Andermann, 2012: 90), they too risk pre-emp-\ntively defeating the very revolutionary cause which they seek to revitalise. This critique is perhaps\nbest conceptualised by Nicol\u00e1s Guagnini who professed to be conflicted by `the idea of making an\ninstitutional criticism with the State as a partner'precisely because `there are no freedoms or rebel-\nlions organised by or with the State' (Brodsky et al., 2004: 63). The very fact that the memory of\nformer political militants enters Perel's film through the search for their bodies also endows the\nrevolutionary struggle of the 1970s with a sense of `irretrievable pastness' such that it seems to\nbelong `to an \"age of atrocity\" that is now safely locked away in the temporality of the object or of\nirrevocably situates these struggles in the present to horrifying effect.\nCoda: continually renewed struggle in Los murales\nThe screen is black. The sound of rushing wind increases in intensity and condenses into the roar of a jet\nengine. Volume and pitch ascend in a steady crescendo. An image appears. A concrete balustrade extends\nfrom the left hand side of the frame to the centre of the screen. The right hand edge is broken. Occupying the\nsame position on the inverse side, a concrete block topped with a round steel beam forms a temporary\nbarrier. A thin gap between balustrade and barrier reveals a body of water in the background. The wire mesh\nof security fencing spreads across the full width of the screen, and three quarters of its height. A narrow\nstretch of asphalt occupies the lowest quarter of the frame. The roar of the engine, having reached a peak of\nintensity continues for some 50seconds. In the final 7seconds, the roar rapidly fades. Throughout this period,\nmovement is minimal. A plastic bag vibrates in the wind, a few scattered leaves are blown across the screen\nat ground level, a bird flies past and the security fence undulates almost imperceptibly. (Figure 7)\nThe opening shot of Perel's second film is incongruous with the rest of the text.AsAdri\u00e1n Gorelik\n(2014) notes, the location can be situated in the `Costanera Norte'(Northern Promenade) which runs\nalong the northern bank of the R\u00edo de la Plata in Buenos Aires. The origin of the sound heard, how-\never, is rather more difficult to trace. The roar of the jet engine could conceivably emerge from the\nAeroparque Jorge Newbery (the airport which stands behind the coastal walkway), yet the clarity,\nvolume and intensity of the noise suggest otherwise. Following this establishing shot, the remaining\n10minutes of Perel's short film can be subdivided into three distinct sections, all of which take place\nin the former CDCs `El Olimpo' and `Automotores Orletti' situated in the west of the capital city.\nNo human characters appear at any point in the film. As the first sequence of eight shots records\nclose-ups of walls, windows and shuttered doors shot from unusual angles, it is reminiscent of El\npredio. The penultimate shot in this sequence serves as a transition to the following section and\ngives the viewer the first indication of the thematic content of the film. The camera is positioned\nfurther back and the screen is largely filled by a garage door which has been heavily spray-painted.\nIn the bottom right-hand corner of the screen, partially visible text spells out `[op]ressors' and\n`prison', the first glimpse of the political graffiti which occupies both of the remaining sequences.\nThe film's second movement consists of nine close-ups of the names, ages and professions of\nsome of the victims and survivors of the 1972 Trelew Massacre \u00ad where 16 guerrilleros from the\nMontoneros, the ERP and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias (Revolutionary Armed Forces)\nwere summarily executed by a previous military dictatorship following an attempted escape from\nthe Rawson maximum security prison \u00ad painted on the walls of the former CDCs.19 The tributes,\nhowever, have been painted over with thick white and red paint and obscured to varying degrees\n(Figure 8). Nonetheless, enough information is visible for the names to be deciphered,20 and the\npenultimate shot in the film's third and final sequence includes a text (heavily obscured but par-\ntially visible) that confirms that the graffiti is an homage to the victims of Trelew. The film's final\nsequence consists of five shots which record responses to these messages calling the memorialised\nvictims `subversive murderers' and `Montoneros murderers', stating `not one innocent', referenc-\ning `Sons and Daughters of murderers',21 and declaring `no to terrorism'. The message `terrorist\nmurderers were executed here'is shown in the penultimate shot painted over the larger text explain-\ning the original memorial (Figure 9).\nFigure 9. Vandalised memorial. Still from Los murales (2011).\nUnlike Perel's first film, Los murales is located within the main urban fabric of BuenosAires and\nthus there is far less plant life included in the film. For this reason, the soundscape takes on an even\nmore fundamental role than in El predio. The majority of the shots included in the film feature\nalmost no perceptible movement at all, but capture only the material fabric of the buildings recorded.\nChion (1994) argues that within `a sequence of images [that] does not necessarily show temporal\nsuccession in the actions it depicts' the use of `diegetic sound imposes on the sequence a sense of\nreal time, like normal everyday experience, and above all, a sense of time that is linear and sequen-\ntial' (pp. 17\u00ad18). Due to the almost total lack of movement in Los murales, however, it is the use of\nenvironmental sounds that alerts the audience to the fact that the images are in motion at all. From\nthis point, the ear leads the eye and the viewer searches for the intermittent visual micro-rhythms\nFigure 8. Obscured tribute. Still from Los murales (2011).\nthat appear on screen: the slight tremble and wave of tree branches moving in the wind; clouds of\npollen and dust passing across the screen. The meaning of the broader visual montage, however,\nproceeds in a halting, retrograde manner. It is almost 5\nminutes (and thus over a third of the way\nthrough the film) before the penultimate shot of the first sequence provides a glimpse of the material\nwhich forms the focus of the larger part of the film. In the second sequence, a viewer unfamiliar with\nthe details of the Trelew massacre will not realise what is being memorialised until the film's penul-\ntimate shot, some 2minutes before its conclusion. Moreover, the location of the graffiti will not be\nrevealed until the concluding intertitle. Thus, it is not only sound which `endows [the] shots with\ntemporal linearization' (Chion, 1994: 13), it is simply that the visual vector runs in the opposite\ndirection. This antagonistic flow of multiple times ultimately serves to confirm Vikki Bell's (2010)\nassertion that the `aftermath of the dictatorship has not been able to become about memory and\nmemorials' at all (p. 72). While the visual images essentially run backwards, as if retreating into the\npast, the immediacy of the ambient sounds once more situates the struggles depicted in a perpetual\npresent. Memorialisation becomes impossible as these acts cannot be absorbed into the past.\nWhat is particularly shocking and unusual about Perel's film is that the type of public denuncia-\ntion and protest normally deployed to denounce the crimes of the last dictatorship have been appro-\npriated by those who wish to defend and celebrate those same crimes.22 Indeed, the message `Aqu\u00ed\nse ajustici\u00f3 a terroristas asesinos' (terrorist murderers were executed here), appears directly to\nreference a work created by the Grupo de Arte Callejero (Street Art Group) in 2001 which con-\nsisted of distributing posters titled `Aqui viven genocidas' (War criminals live here) that featured\nmaps locating the former CDCs and the dwellings of supporters of the dictatorship throughout\nthy that, unlike El predio, Los murales features no interior shots whatsoever. While in Perel's ear-\nlier film windows frequently served as portals through an objective shot-reverse-shot technique\nthat would function as a transition between exterior and interior spaces, in the latter work, windows\nbecome barriers. The viewer is literally locked out of the former CDCs.23 This is despite the fact\nthat `El Olimpo' was converted by the State into a `Memory Site' in 2005 and that `Automotores\nOrletti' was designated a `Historic Site' in 2009. What Perel's film demonstrates, then, is that\nregardless of the State's attempts to incorporate memories of the past into official public policy,\nthere were those who would take to the streets, beyond the control of the State, in order to defend\nthe crimes of the dictatorship. If El predio highlighted the disagreements and debates among dif-\nferent human rights organisations as to how to memorialise the events of the recent past in coopera-\ntion with the State, Los murales depicts the outside and limit of this process. Moreover, Perel's use\nof sound in the film delineates further institutional failings and abuses of power.\nAs previously described, Los murales opens with the intensive roar of a jet engine while the\naudience catch a glimpse of the R\u00edo de la Plata. The agglomeration of this specific sound and this\nspecific place cannot but remind the viewer of the `Vuelos de la muerte' (death flights) and the\nriver's violent past. Even the fact that the jet is never seen and that the view of the river is almost\nentirely obscured seems to testify to the secret extermination plan carried out in this place. As the\nfilm progresses, the soundtrack frequently features the sounds of motors starting, the heavy thuds\nof car doors opening and closing, the high pitch whine of electric wheel wrenches, and other\nsounds that situate the audience in a mechanic's garage. Yet none of the sources of these sounds are\nvisible. The audience view the present reality of the former detention centres but, as both sites were\nused as garages while functioning as extermination centres, the soundtrack situates the deception\nthat was used to mask the reality of torture and murder in our present moment. Just as the graffiti\ncovered walls of the former CDCs remind the viewer that, despite the successes and best attempts\nof the Kirchner administrations, the resumed trials for crimes against humanity committed during\nevoke contemporary abuses of power such as the 2006 disappearance of Julio Jorge L\u00f3pez as he\nwaited to appear as a witness against those responsible for his kidnap in 1976 (Lorenz and Winn,\nthe arbitrary imprisonment since January 2016 of the social activist Milagro Sala by the governor\nof Jujuy province (who supports President Macri) despite calls for her release emanating from the\nInter-American Commission on Human Rights, the United Nations, Amnesty International, inter-\nMaldonado on 1 August 2017. On this date, police violently raided a protest in defence of the land\nrights of the indigenous Mapuche community in which Maldonado had participated. When he\ncould not subsequently be located, the commonly held fear was that he, too, had been forcibly\ndisappeared leading to massive protests (Go\u00f1i, 2017; Amnesty International, 2017; La Naci\u00f3n,\nquently recovered from a river in the area and his autopsy revealed that he had drowned, significant\nquestions remain as to how he came to this fate, and the degree of police responsibility is yet to be\nConclusion\nIn discussing the proposals submitted for the reconversion of ESMA into an `Espacio de la\nMemoria', Di Paolantonio (2008) makes a persuasive case for the inclusion of works of art in the\nsite arguing that `[v]isual art, in a particular non-didactic form, has the ability to offer objects and\nopen an interpretative space where evocative interminable questions around representation and\nrelations to the past can emerge' (p. 36). Nonetheless, Di Paolantonio (2008) also recognises that a\nprimary concern of those opposed to the inclusion of artworks in the site was that `placing artistic\nworks or a gallery space within the premises would alter and corrupt the actuality and historical\nauthenticity of this site' (p. 33), an opinion echoed in Horst Hoheisel's argument that `[t]hese\nspaces where torture and murder took place are symbolically loaded and sufficiently evocative'and\nthat `there is no need for sculptures or art objects here' (Di Paolantonio, 2008: 35). What is excep-\ntional about El predio and Los murales is that they demonstrate that the former need not disqualify\nthe latter. As works of art themselves they unarguably provoke `evocative interminable questions'\nabout the relationship between the recent past and present attempts at memorialisation. Yet Perel's\n`silent'and `empty'films also continually testify to the `symbolically loaded and sufficiently evoc-\native' environment of ESMA and the former CDCs. At every turn in watching the films (and just\nas much in my attempts to describe key scenes), the temptation is to project an interpretive frame-\nwork drawn from the sombre and tragic past of the site onto the images. Just as Arenillas (2013)\nargues that `the young people digging [...] reminds us of, or takes us to, the work camps, or the\nsearch for bones' (pp. 384\u00ad385), so too I have proposed that Perel's filmic techniques evoke and\nappropriate several of the key strategies deployed by the torturers that previously occupied the\nsites. The fundamental point is that the spaces Perel records are affectively saturated with the trau-\nmatic past. As Pamela Colombo (2010) has argued, Perel's films are constructed from `fragments\nof the past in the present' (p. 9, original emphasis). Or rather, as Juan Besse (2015) has argued in\nrelation to Perel's 2012 film 17 monumentos, in Perel's cinematic oeuvre, there is a disjunction:\n`images from today and sounds of the past. Images of the past and sounds from today' (p. 664).\nThis is a sentiment echoed by Perel himself when he proposed that his films are constructed from\n`that which Deleuze denominates the time-image', from `fragments of time in a pure state' (Perel\nand Feierstein, 2014: 113). Certainly, Perel's films are constructed from `crystal images' in the\nDeleuzian sense: they are trapped between two temporal registers where the `present is the actual\nimage, and its contemporaneous past is the virtual image' simultaneously (Deleuze, 1989: 79), and\nthe image becomes `the point of indiscernibility of the two distinct images, the actual and the vir-\ntual, [...] a bit of time in the pure state' (p. 82). Given that I have argued in favour of a sonic inter-\npretation of Perel's films and have even proposed that the visual should be understood as sonorous\nwithin them, it is particularly important to remember that Deleuze also argued that the `crystal-\nimage is as much a matter of sound as it is optical, and Felix Guattari was right to define the crystal\nof time as being a \"ritornello\" par excellence' (p. 92). And this is essentially what I have been\narguing throughout: that the use of ambient environmental sounds situates the past in a perpetual\npresent such that it is continually renewed and reinvigorated. It is in this way that Perel success-\nfully transforms the spaces he records into `monuments' in the sense that Deleuze and Guattari\n(1994) understand the word, that is as sites which `confide in the ear of the future the persistent\nsensations that embody the event: the constantly renewed suffering of men and women, their re-\ncreated protestations, their constantly resumed struggle' (pp. 176\u00ad177). Ultimately, El predio and\nLos murales serve to remind the viewer that the memorialisation of the past cannot be entirely\nentrusted to the museum or the State precisely because the injustices of the 1970s continue in the\npresent moment. Similarly, by including the voice of those who would seek to defend the dictator-\nship's crimes in his films, Perel underscores that this work is as pressing and important as ever, as\nhe also demonstrates why the goal of achieving a democratic consensus is presently impossible.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publi-\ncation of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publica-\ntion of this article: Open Access has been funded by the School of Advanced Study, University of London.\nNotes\n 1.

The strategic deployment of `emptiness' and `absence' as an appropriate aesthetic technique to com-\nmemorate the disappeared has frequently been discussed by Argentine activists and artists. In addition to\nvast extension [is] the arrangement wherein, for example, for a scene taking place in a room, we not only\nhear the sounds in the room (including those off-screen) but also sounds out in the hallway, traffic in the\nstreet nearby, a siren farther away, and so on.

Prisoners in the `Escuela Superior de Mec\u00e1nica de la Armada' (Naval Academy of Mechanics, ESMA)\nwere subjected to severe torture and, in some cases, were even forced to work for the regime's repres-\nsive apparatus itself. It is estimated that around 90% of prisoners were assassinated, many of them\ndrugged, bound and thrown into the R\u00edo de la Plata to drown during the regime's infamous `vuelos\nde la muerte' (death flights). The site also witnessed the abduction of babies born to female prisoners\nduring their detention and their forcible adoption to families sympathetic or connected to the regime\n(Andermann, 2012: 83).

The fact that the Asociaci\u00f3n Madres de Plaza de Mayo originally proposed `that ESMA should become\na functioning art school' (Di Paolantonio, 2008: 25\u00ad26) appears tangentially through a shot which com-\npletes the Barrio sequence. In the 33rd minute (i.e. between the first and second Barrio progression), a\nyoung girl lies on the floor during a film screening. She carefully selects different pencils from a colour-\nful case as she draws on a sheet of paper. The use of the floor as a drawing surface succinctly echoes\nshots of Barrio drawing on the wall and instils a sense that there is an inter-generational transfer of artis-\ntic practice within ESMA. Further detail of the proposal submitted by the Asociaci\u00f3n Madres de Plaza\n 9. The Madres and Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo famously wear white headscarves and carry photographic\nportraits of their disappeared children and grandchildren.\n10. In contrast to the previous clip, the scene is overdetermined. Behind the yellow Spanish subtitles, the\noriginal white German text is clearly legible. The connotative leaps are not, however, entirely arbitrary.\nInspired by the Madres de Plaza de Mayo, on 27 May 1995, relatives of those disappeared in Turkey\nbegan staging weekly protests demanding to know the fate of their loved ones. Known as the Saturday\nMothers, the group was even joined on 30 May 1998 by a visiting delegation from the Argentine Madres.\n12. Such sentiments are encountered throughout the submitted proposals and are perhaps expressed most\nclearly in that submitted by the Centro de Estudios Legales y Sociales (Centre of Legal and Social Studies,\nCELS) which argued that `the museum of memory should transcend the direct victims, the families of the\nvictims and the human rights organisations, sustaining itself in all of society' (Brodsky, 2005: 217).\n13. The signatories to this proposal were the `Familiares de Desaparecidos y Detenidos por Razones\nPol\u00edticas' (Family Members of Persons Disappeared and Detained for Political Motives), the Madres de\nPlaza de Mayo-L\u00ednea Fundadora (Mothers of Plaza de Mayo-Founding Line) and the Abuelas de Plaza\nde Mayo (Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo). Other groups such as the Servicio Paz y Justicia (Justice and\nPeace Service, SERPAJ) sought a similar expansion of the content of the museum arguing that\nthe memory of the native peoples, of the complicity of economic powers with the dictatorship, of the\nexternal debt, eternal, paid and unpayable, should, by our criteria, be part of the `Space for Memory and\n14. There are, in fact, only two panning shots in the entirety of Perel's filmic oeuvre. Both are found in\n15. This is not to say, however, that activists, intellectuals and artists involved in memory labour were\nuncritical of the Kirchner regimes. To cite but one example, Cecilia Sosa (2014) has argued persuasively\nthat the human rights politics adopted by the Kirchners advocated `a bloodline hierarchy of suffering'(p.\n3) such that `only those related by blood to the missing were entitled to ask for justice' (p. xi), and only\nthose `who were directly affected by the military repression'were `entitled to assume the right to remem-\nber' (p. 1). To counter this move, Sosa (2014) analyses memorial practices which allow for the affective\ntransmission of trauma to those not directly affected by the regime's violence in order to construct `a\nmore inclusive politics of mourning' (p. 3).\n16.

For further details concerning Oesterheld, El Eternauta and the `intelectual comprometido', see Page\n(2010). For details of the intellectual support for militant groups more generally, see Gilman (2003). It\nis particularly noteworthy that, at this time, the image of the Eternauta had also been reclaimed by the\nyouth organisation `La C\u00e1mpora', one of the most fiercely pro-Kirchner activist groups. Indeed, this\nperiod witnessed the emergence of the `Nestornauta', the image of the Eternauta within which the face\nhad been altered to resemble N\u00e9stor Kirchner.\n18. Perel (2011) has indicated that, while he intentionally removed voices from the film which would explain\nor describe the images he recorded, he intentionally included this moment.\n20. Those victims named in the film areAlfredo El\u00edas Kohan, MariaAngelica Sabelli, Carlos HeribertoAstudillo,\nHumberto Adri\u00e1n Toschi, Carlos Heriberto Astudillo, Miguel Angel Polti, Susana Graciela Lesgart and Ana\nMaria Villarreal. The survivors Ricardo Ren\u00e9 Haidar and Mar\u00eda Antonia Berger are also named.\n21. In this instance, the text refers directly to the organisation Hijos por la Identidad y la Justicia Contra el\nOlvido y el Silencio, whose acronym (HIJOS) also spells out `Sons and Daughters'.\n22. One exemplary public denunciation of the crimes of the dictatorship are the escraches performed by\nHIJOS. For detailed description of these performative protests, see Scorer (2016: 57\u00ad59), Masiello\n23. For this reason, the final shot included in El predio could be interpreted as a transition to Los murales.\nIn this shot, Perel's camera is situated within the ESMA compound and records the traffic passing in\nfront of the site through an open gate. Despite this aperture to the outside, however, Perel's camera never\nleaves the ESMA site during El predio. In contrast, Los murales only features shots taken from the street\ndirected towards the external walls of the Clandestine Detention Centres (CDCs) recorded.\n24.

Buenos\nAuthor biography\nNiall HD Geraghty is a post-doctoral fellow at the Institute of Latin American Studies, School of Advanced\nStudy, University of London. His research focusses on the intersections between critical theory, philosophy and\npolitics within contemporary Latin American cultural production. Niall completed his doctoral studies at the\nUniversity of Cambridge with a thesis focussed on the analysis of selected texts by the Argentine authors C\u00e9sar\nAira, Marcelo Cohen and Ricardo Piglia written in the period 1979\u00ad1998. The thesis formed the basis of the\nbook The Polyphonic Machine: Capitalism, Political Violence, and Resistance in Contemporary Argentine\nLiterature (University of Pittsburgh Press: forthcoming). At present, Niall is completing a research project\nexamining the work of Argentine director Jonathan Perel, utilising the investigation of his unique cinematic\nwork to explore the politics of memory and memorialisation in Argentina at the turn of the twenty-first century.\nIn addition, he is co-editing the volume Creative Spaces: Urban Culture and Marginality in Latin America\n(Institute of Latin American Studies: forthcoming) and will soon begin a Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship\nto develop a project which involves a radical re-examination of the work of Argentine artist Le\u00f3n Ferrari\n(1920\u00ad2013). This project explores the interrelations between politics and religion in twentieth-century\nArgentina, and the potential correlations between contemporary philosophy and liberation theology."
