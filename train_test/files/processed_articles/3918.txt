Role theory and\nsocial constructivism provided insight into a commonly observed but insufficiently understood phenomenon in inquiry. Within\ninquiry, role shifts have been described as the switching of roles between students and teachers; however, the process may\nbe better conceptualized as role diversification because students and teachers may undertake multiple roles simultaneously\nin inquiry. This article expands on existing research and proposes a framework potentially applicable to both learners and\nteachers, but here focused on learners. Beyond exploration, engagement, and stabilization of roles, diversification was added\nand described. This framework expanded on current education theory, adding new insight to a minimally explored topic, with\nimplications for students, teachers, consultants, and researchers.\n",

Inquiry-based curriculum is\nlearner-centered, based on student interests and curiosity\n(Saunders-Stewart, Gyles, & Shore, 2012), and recommended\nacrosssubjectmatter(InternationalBaccalaureateOrganization,\nCouncil for the Social Studies, 1994; National Council of\nTeachers of Mathematics, 2000; National Governors\nAssociation Center for Best Practices, Council of Chief State\nSeveral beneficial student outcomes have been identified,\nincluding improved achievement, knowledge application,\nthinking and problem-solving skills, and attitudes toward learn-\ning (Saunders-Stewart etal., 2012).There, nevertheless, remain\nbarriers to inquiry implementation (Shore, Aulls, & Delcourt,\nunderstood, for example, role shifts. Within inquiry, role shifts\noccur when a student adopts or takes on a traditional teacher\nrole, such as evaluating his or her own or another student's\nwork. A role shift does not imply adding to the current reper-\ntoire of roles but rather suggests that a role is given up or traded\nand replaced with a new role (Aulls & Shore, 2008; Crawford,\n2000). The concept of inquiry-role diversification implies that\nseveral roles, including roles not traditionally ascribed to a par-\nticular individual, could potentially be adopted at one time.\nSeveral researchers have provided a foundation for\nfrequently in inquiry classrooms to facilitate adopting multi-\nple and varied roles at the same time. No model yet exists to\nexplain role diversification within inquiry. Although teachers\nenact multiple roles in the course of a curriculum unit or time\nperiod and many of these roles are unique to inquiry-based\nversus traditional instruction (Aulls & Ibrahim, 2012), no\nresearch has addressed as a central part of its model the com-\nplexity of roles within inquiry or, in particular, the permuta-\ntions of role changes or diversification of roles that can occur.\nMultiple roles and role shifts are visibly present in descrip-\ntions of inquiry, but no existing framework explores the vari-\nous role processes that can occur, including diversification.\n1McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nCheryl L.

Walker1 and Bruce M. Shore1\n Keywords\ninquiry, social constructivism, roles, role theory, role diversification\n2 SAGE Open\nBased on specific tenets from different role theories and\nfrom research on inquiry-based teaching and learning, we\npropose a four-part inquiry framework that can be applied to\nvarious age groups. This proposed inquiry framework draws\nfrom previous models within role theory but adds new insight\ninto the role-diversification process in particular. Although\ncommon in inquiry, there are other classroom settings in\nwhich this framework may apply, including discovery-learning\nsettings. Diversification is not as salient within traditional set-\ntings. This four-component framework adds the new essen-\ntial process of role diversification to three other processes\nthat have been described in previous research, specifically,\nexploration, engagement, and stabilization.\nImplicit and explicit classroom rules are learned during\nexploration, for example, the importance of taking initiative\nin inquiry classrooms (Thornton & Nardi, 1975). Engagement\nis characterized by formally learning about what it means to\nbe an inquiry student and beginning to participate in the asso-\nciated expectations, for example, learning and experimenting\nwith question asking in the classroom (Shore, Birlean, Walker,\nRitchie, LaBanca, & Aulls, 2009). Stabilization is character-\nized by commitment to being an inquiry student, for example,\nattaining a level of comfort with problems that are not well\ndefined (Shore etal., 2009). During the process of diversifi-\ncation, students adopt varied roles in the classroom, for exam-\nple, adopting the traditional student role of learner alongside\nthe traditional teacher role of evaluator. There is a theoretical\ngap when it comes to the concept of diversification, and this\narticle presents an opportunity to better understand the roles\nthat learners and teachers can undertake.\nA better understanding of role diversification in the class-\nroom can provide teachers with additional information about\nindividual student progress. Teachers can observe progress\nin student learning through an awareness of new roles that\nstudents take on or adopt, in addition to increased knowledge\nand skills within the subject matter.\nFew articles, if any, have addressed the overlap and con-\nnections between the core theoretical knowledge bases of\ninquiry and role theory. Aulls and Ibrahim (2012) elaborated\nnumerous roles within inquiry; however, they did not focus\non the diversification process within inquiry. Thornton and\nprocess of role acquisition but not in the context of inquiry\nteaching and learning environments, and none referred to a\nprocess of role diversification. The proposed framework\nexamined the overlap and connections between role theory\nand inquiry theory and provided a foundational guideline for\nfurther research into the process of diversification.\nSocial Constructivism and Inquiry\nSocial Constructivism\nIn an educational context, constructivism can be described\nas understanding that occurs as a result of a learner's mental\nactivities. Although an individual actively constructs his or\nher own knowledge, social interactions strongly influence\nthis process (Bereiter, 1994; Bruning, Schraw, & Ronning,\n1995), and social constructivism embraces this process well.\nSocial constructivism describes student learning as well as\nteaching. Based on Popper's ideas, Bereiter (1994) explained\nthat knowledge or student learning is built on, or improved,\nthrough a collective process of creation and construction.\nSocial constructivism, therefore, describes the interconnec-\ntions among individuals and their social worlds (Ernest,\nverbal communication among children and between chil-\ndren and adults is a powerful force in helping them acquire\nconceptual knowledge. Such interaction provides a richer\nrange of use of concepts than an individual might construct\non his or her own and provides feedback and scaffolding for\nthat construction. Children learn to speak through dialog\nand later understand the meaning of speech by making sub-\njective connections among concepts. Children therefore\nneed to be challenged with learning material that they would\nmost likely be unable to complete on their own, but, with\nhelp, could learn successfully (zone of proximal develop-\nconsidering internal factors including the learner's prior\ncognitive experiences that influence the ways in which new\ninformation is interpreted and understood. Therefore,\nknowledge and understanding are in a constant construction\nand reconstruction process. Smith, Maclin, Houghton, and\nHennessey (2000) also described a constructivist classroom\nas a place where students develop their ideas through dialog\nwith their peers. This hypothesis testing or attempting to\nmake sense of one's own ideas as well as the ideas of one's\npeers occurs within the classroom, and individuals in this\ntype of classroom can also be considered a community of\nlearners (Brown & Campione, 1994). The teacher frequently\nscaffolds learning. Teaching in a social-constructivist envi-\nronment, therefore, needs to encourage knowledge forma-\ntion and foster skill development, including judgment and\norganization (Bruning etal., 1995). Teachers act primarily\nas coaches or facilitators, rather than merely as information\ntransmitters.\nSmith and colleagues (2000) considered idea develop-\nment as a complex process involving multiple steps and also\nas a collaborative process in which colleagues work together\nand evaluate each other's ideas. Constructivist classrooms\nwere described as emphasizing group work, dialog, and\nshared norms. Students described how sharing ideas helps\nwith understanding one's own ideas and also helps create\nnew ideas. Learning was also described as a process of per-\nspective taking and determining the interrelations of differ-\nent perspectives. This emphasis on learning through social\ninteraction and perspective taking relates closely to the role\ntaking that occurs in inquiry. Role taking in inquiry requires\nthe ability to adopt the perspective of another person in a dif-\nferent role and be able to use that knowledge to enact the role\nWalker and Shore 3\nfor oneself. This can involve social interactions with that\nindividual as the person learns about the role they may\nchoose to take on in the future.\nInquiry-Based Teaching and Learning\nInquiry-based teaching and learning classrooms are largely\nbased on social-constructivist precepts and have been a\ncentral focus of curricular reform throughout North America\nand beyond. The National Research Council (1996) defined\ninquiry as\na multifaceted activity that involves making observations; posing\nquestions; examining books and other sources of information to see\nwhat is already known; planning investigations; reviewing what is\nalready known in light of experimental evidence; using tools to\ngather,analyze,andinterpretdata;proposinganswers,explanations,\nand predictions; and communicating the results. (p. 23)\nTherefore, inquiry broadly involves learning through ques-\ntion asking based on curiosity or interest. This helps create\nan authentic learning environment that contributes to an indi-\nvidual's inherent motivation to further one's own knowledge\nShore (2008) emphasized inquiry as an active process, driven\nby student interest, with knowledge construction as the main\ngoal while building hypothesis formulation and problem-\nsolving skills.\nInquiry-based instruction fosters motivation for indepen-\ndent learning, enhances critical-thinking skills and problem\nsolving, and promotes subject-matter understanding, curiosity,\nincreased confidence, and teamwork (Aulls & Shore, 2008).\nThe International Baccalaureate (IB) program adopted inquiry-\nbased teaching and learning centrally in its curriculum. IB pro-\ngrams were originally developed to provide standardized\ninternational entrance exams to university, recognizable in all\ncountries. They provide a challenging education that promotes\nactive learning and cultural understanding with inquiry\nintended as a privileged pedagogy (Chichekian & Shore,\nTo be an inquirer involves some level of inquiry literacy.\nShore and colleagues (2009) described inquiry literacy as the\nability to critically understand and also be able to effectively\nuse the language, symbols, and skills of inquiry during an\nactivity. Becoming inquiry literate requires explicit instruc-\ntion from teachers, parents, or peers, in addition to experi-\nence. Some of the indicators of inquiry literacy include the\nability to take ownership of one's learning, pursuing one's\ninterests without depending on a teacher, understanding why\none is engaged in an inquiry process, seeking relevant evi-\ndence, realizing that there are multiple approaches to prob-\nlem solving, and understanding that learning is a process.\nPart of being an inquirer or being inquiry literate therefore\nnecessarily involves taking on different roles that students\nmay not take on in a traditional classroom setting, such as the\nrole of question asker, analyst, or communicator. Similarly,\nHolbrook and Kolodner (2000) discussed the need for stu-\ndents to be comfortable with the active learning that occurs\nwithin inquiry classrooms. Specifically, they determined that\nteachers preferred students to have experience with complex\nprocesses (e.g., communication and collaboration) prior to\nlearning concepts within a science classroom. Teacher and\nstudent roles were discussed, particularly in regard to the\nrole shift that is common and whereby the traditional teacher\nrole of setting and enforcing tasks is lessened. A \"launcher\"\nunit addressed much of the skill development needed for\nunderstanding process before content in inquiry. This may\nparallel some of the characteristics of the exploration,\nengagement, and stabilization processes because the launcher\nunit refers to the engagement and development among stu-\ndents of a common language that can become an anchor for\nfurther skill development in additional and varied contexts,\nsuch as that needed for diversification to occur.\nAulls and Shore (2008) addressed the differences in stu-\ndent and teacher roles in inquiry environments compared with\nmore traditional educational settings. Teacher roles in inquiry\nwere defined as \"actions, verbal interactions with students,\nand responsibilities undertaken to support students'participa-\ntion in components of inquiry such as projects, experiments,\nlaboratories, hypothesizing\" (p. 14). Aulls and Shore pro-\nposed that student and teacher roles in inquiry exist along a\ncontinuum from roles enacted in teacher-directed inquiry, to\nteacher-guided inquiry, to student-centered inquiry. In\nteacher-directed inquiry, the teacher is responsible for student\nlearning; in teacher-guided inquiry, the teacher and students\nshare this responsibility; and in student-centered inquiry, the\nstudents take the lead, and the teacher acts as a consultant. In\nstudent-centered inquiry, teachers often shift from playing the\nrole of instructor to the role of facilitator, and students tend to\nmove from playing a more passive to an active role in their\nlearning (e.g., sharing in the evaluation of their own work).\nAs opposed to surrendering a role in favor of another, in\ninquiry, students and teachers may take on additional and\nsometimes overlapping roles, leading to diversification of\ntheir respective role repertoires. Biggers and Forbesa (2012)\nalso recognized the inquiry continuum in terms of teacher and\nstudent directedness. Throughout a series of science lessons,\nearly lessons were more student-directed whereas later les-\nsons were more teacher-directed, indicating that movement\ncan occur along that continuum of inquiry. The proposed\nframework can be applied to all types of inquiry; however, the\nnature of the roles may differ in each setting. For example, the\nroles in teacher-directed inquiry may be more similar to roles\nseen in traditional classroom settings (e.g., the teacher may\nadopt the primary role of knowledge provider). Overall, there\nare differences in the types and numbers of roles when tradi-\ntional classroom settings are compared with inquiry settings\nand also when various types of inquiry settings are compared\namong themselves (Aulls & Ibrahim, 2012)\nThe issues introduced above are elaborated further below.\n4 SAGE Open\nRole Theory\nIn inquiry, conceptualization of roles has been limited. Role\ntheory can assist understanding the complexities in this pro-\ncess. Prominent early role theorists, including Moreno (1946,\nthis concept since the 1930s and, although this research orig-\ninated more than three quarters of a century ago, it remains\ninformative. The literature on social constructivism, for\nexample, dates from a similar time, yet it has substantially\ninfluenced current curricular reforms. The study of role\nresearch and theories does offer advantages; however, the\nresearch is often fraught with inconsistent and conflicting\ndefinitions, discrepant models, confusion, and a lack of inte-\ngration (Biddle, 1986). Biddle explained how role theorists\ndiffered in their conceptualizations of expectations respon-\nsible for roles. For example, some role theorists considered\nexpectations to be prescriptive or based on norms, whereas\nothers assumed expectations to be beliefs or preferences.\nThese differences in expectations may result in adopting\nroles but for different underlying reasons, and therefore sub-\ntle differences in the role expression may become apparent.\nBiddle also described differences in role theorists'conditions\nfor roles, for example, that roles occur within a social sys-\ntem. Although outlining discrepancies, Biddle summarized\nhow most role theorists assume that the primary force in\ndetermining roles arises from social expectations formed\nthrough experience and awareness of the expectations for\nExamining the history of role theory from its beginnings\noffers insights into the evolution of roles over time and can\nhelp inform new models related to roles and role theory. Turner\nrole as a \"cluster of behaviors and attitudes that are thought to\nbelong together, so that an individual is viewed as acting con-\nsistently when performing the various components of a single\nrole and inconsistently when failing to do so\" (p. 233). Turner\nfurther described how a person adopts the attitudes, beliefs,\nand behaviors accompanying a role, and social interaction can\nfacilitate this process and ultimately affect personality forma-\ntion. Furthermore, individuals may take on multiple roles\nof multiple roles from a role set.Arole set is based on relation-\nships that emerge from specific social statuses. For example, a\nteacher's role set includes students, other teachers, the princi-\npal, and professional organizations.\nSeveral variables influence roles and role acquisition.\nExamining these variables provides further context for the\nproposed inquiry framework. Role influences include atti-\nLyons, 1990), norms and expectations (Ryu & Sandoval,\nOnly some of these studies focused specifically on a social-\nconstructivist or inquiry-based teaching and learning context\n2001); however, all pointed to the importance of these vari-\nables in classrooms, and therefore, they should be considered\nwhen developing a framework for student\u00adteacher role\ndiversification.\nRole taking has been extensively researched by Selman,\nwho defined the concept as \"the ability to view the world\n(including the self) from another's perspective\" (Selman,\nity to understand another individual's capabilities, attributes,\nexpectations, feelings, and reactions. Selman and Byrne\n(1974) later defined role taking as \"the ability to understand\nthe self and others as subjects, to react to others as like the\nself, and to react to the self's behavior from the other's point\nof view\" (p. 803). Role taking within classrooms may not be\nas clear-cut due to other variables of influence, including stu-\ndent engagement and levels of classroom interaction. Student\nengagement is dependent on a sense of agency or indepen-\nexamined student engagement, role taking, and social interac-\ntion within a science class. Categories of intellectual roles\nwere presented to the teacher and students, who were then\nresponsible for describing and operationally defining these\ncategories: predicting and theorizing, summarizing results,\nand relating evidence or results to theory and prediction.\nIntellectual audience roles were assigned by the researchers\nto one class, but not the others. These roles required that stu-\ndents check each other's work, for example, to ensure that a\nstudent assignment contained a prediction. When students\ntook on audience roles, the teacher's roles and responsibili-\nties shifted and most of the cognitive work was distributed\namong the students. Audience roles required that students ask\nfor clarification to fully understand, and this resulted in more\nactive engagement of the students as they self-monitored and\nchallenged presented information. Students who took on\naudience roles were more engaged and shared in the con-\nstruction of knowledge with their peers, which led to a shift\nin the teacher role toward mediator and monitor within the\nclassroom.\nDiversification and Related Constructs\nSomethingismissinginotherrole-theorymodels.Diversification\nis a novel term that differs from the concepts of role shift and\nrole sets. Role diversification involves taking on a larger, more\nvaried number of roles and roles that are not necessarily tradi-\ntional in nature. Diversification refers to a process of expanding\nthe repertoire of roles that an individual adopts, in number and\nvariety. This overlaps with related constructs but differs in sev-\neral ways. For example, diversification is not the same as a role\nshift because a role shift suggests that one role is given up or\ntraded and replaced with a new role (Aulls & Shore, 2008;\nWalker and Shore 5\nCrawford, 2000). In diversification, students may take on sev-\neral different roles at once and may take on the roles of other\nparties without giving up existing roles. Furthermore, roles\nadopted during diversification may be roles that are not tradi-\ntionally ascribed to that individual, for example, when a student\ntakes on a traditional teacher role of evaluator. Diversification\nalso differs from the notion of a role set or an expected set of\nbehaviors between matching roles, for example, between that of\na student and teacher. Diversification allows each person to\npotentially adopt both so-called teacher and student roles at the\nsame time. This process can be observed over the course of a\nclass, teaching unit, or school year.There are no time constraints\nin terms of when diversification occurs.\nBeing able to perceive how another person might respond\nis not the same as adopting that person's role in that situation.\nPerspective taking seems to be a necessary but not sufficient\ncomponent of role diversification. Diversification represents\nan overarching construct that involves many related con-\nstructs, including role shifts, role sets, and perspective taking.\nWithin inquiry, students have additional opportunities to\nexpand their repertoire of roles. Students take on the learner\nrole, but may also simultaneously adopt an evaluator or\nquestion-asker role, and this then influences the existing\nlearner role so that roles are constantly evolving. For exam-\nple, when a teacher stops a lesson and prompts the students\nto ask questions, the teacher is now encouraging students to\nadopt a question-asker role, thereby shaping their learning\nexperience and their existing role as learner. Creating oppor-\ntunities for adopting diverse and varied roles happens often\nwithin inquiry classrooms. Gyles (2011) examined students'\nfrequencies of reported experiences with 23 criterion-refer-\nenced student-inquiry outcomes (Saunders-Stewart et\nal.,\nand concluded that even moderate levels of inquiry use led to\nthe adoption of new student roles.\nInquiry Framework\nThe proposed framework is not a stage model but involves\nseveral processes of individual evolution and change that\nbuild on one's own individual repertoire of inquiry skills and\nroles. Students can adopt a number of different roles and do\nso in a unique and evolutionary way. Diversification may\nactually be observed within the processes of exploration,\nengagement, or stabilization.\nRole-Acquisition Models and Links to\nInquiry\nThere are several role-acquisition theories; however, none has\nspecifically focused on an inquiry-learning environment. Three\nexisting role-acquisition models are reviewed. Two of these\nmodels are presented primarily as stage theories; however, the\nproposed framework does not incorporate this perspective.\nFundamental concepts from the reviewed models form the\nbasis for the proposed inquiry framework, with the exception\nof diversification. Descriptions of how individuals transition\nbetween different phases of role acquisition are limited. Links\nto inquiry can be identified, permitting creation of a proposed\nframework to explain common processes that occur within\ninquiry classrooms. Role diversification can occur in any\nenvironment; it does not occur exclusively in inquiry, how-\never, there are numerous characteristics of inquiry environ-\nments in which role diversification is relevant and essential.\nFor example, Shore etal. (2009) identified several inquiry\ncharacteristics that involve a certain diversification of roles.\nAs an example of essential inquiry-student knowledge, they\ncharacterized inquiry as goal-driven, with shared objectives\namong students and teachers. This requires others' collabora-\ntion to negotiate a consensus regarding the learning goals.\nThese negotiation skills require active engagement and may\ntherefore necessitate a role shift from passive recipient to\nactive collaborator. In addition, an essential student skill\nrequired for inquiry literacy is the ability to ask relevant ques-\ntions, both for oneself and for an appropriate audience. Doing\nthe latter requires adopting the role of presenter or question\nasker, and also the role of audience member to ensure that the\nquestion will be relevant and nontrivial, therefore, illustrating\nrole diversification.\nBracewell, Le Maistre, Lajoie, and Breuleux (2008) exam-\nined role shifts in inquiry, specifically, changes in six teach-\ners' knowledge and beliefs in a technology-driven teaching\nenvironment. Technology in the classroom allowed students\nto take on more active and differentiated learning roles.\nAlthough teachers were initially concerned about the greater\nautonomy provided to students through technology, these\nconcerns eventually faded and the increased student indepen-\ndence led to a change in teachers' own perspectives toward\nteaching and learning. This was labeled release of agency and\ndefined as \"the psychological decision that accompanies\n(indeed, allows) a teacher to make the well-documented\nchange in roles from a didactic instructor to a coach who\nfacilitates student academic inquiry\" (Bracewell etal., 2008,\np. 292). Success meant that teachers had to be comfortable\nwith the changes spurred by technology in their classrooms.\nAlthough this research specifically focused on the introduc-\ntion of classroom technology, it identified several ideas rele-\nvant to inquiry, including the \"release of agency\" concept that\nparallels the role-diversification process.\nSimilar to competing theories for roles, there are several\nrole-acquisition models, none of which has been widely\naccepted (Yellin, 1999). Synthesizing these theories and\nfocusing on links to inquiry provided the impetus for the pro-\nposal of a coherent and comprehensive inquiry framework\nthat includes the process of diversification. Only three role\nmodels most relevant to inquiry are presented.\nThornton and Nardi defined a role as behavioral, attitudinal,\nand cognitive expectations imposed on a person within a par-\nticular social position. They outlined a four-phase progression\n6 SAGE Open\nof role acquisition whereby individuals move from passive\nrole acceptance to active role engagement. During the antici-\npatory phase, individuals begin to socially and psychologi-\ncally prepare themselves for the new role and have a general\nnotion of what will be required based on stereotypes. In an\ninquiry environment, students with minimal inquiry experi-\nence may enter a classroom with preconceived notions of tra-\nditionalclassroomvalues(e.g.,predominantlyteacher-directed\nin which the majority of class time is in lecture format),\npotentially leading to more difficulties adapting to their new\ninquiry environment. Inquiry students are often expected to\nmake certain curricular decisions, evaluate evidence, and take\ninitiatives in their learning (Aulls & Shore, 2008).\nIn the formal phase, individuals view their role from a\nmore internal perspective. Formal written rules or duties\nreplace initial stereotypes. Although Thornton and Nardi\nbelieved that this phase implied a high degree of consensus,\nthis may differ greatly in an inquiry classroom. Rules or\nduties in a traditional classroom setting are often overtly\nstated and can include listening to the teacher and remaining\nseated unless told otherwise. In an inquiry classroom, these\nrules can be quite different, for example, asking questions,\nlistening to your peers, and challenging evidence. A student\nunfamiliar with inquiry and who expects to sit quietly and\nlisten to the teacher without questioning any of the informa-\ntion may be uncomfortable with the new expectations to be\nmore actively involved in the learning process.\nDuring the informal phase, individuals begin to learn the\nnew role's informal rules generally understood through inter-\nactions among individuals within the system. Increased con-\nflict and decreased consensus regarding different formal and\ninformal expectations characterize this phase. In an inquiry\nenvironment, a student expecting to sit and listen to the\nteacher may have trouble asking questions, working as part\nof a team, or hypothesizing, especially if that individual is\nshy. Once the student begins to adapt to this new environ-\nment, he or she might encounter the informal rule of politely\ninterrupting if one has a good idea during a discussion. This\nmay not be as difficult for the student to accept if he or she\nhas learned formal inquiry rules, such as asking questions or\ngenerating hypotheses.\nIn the personal phase, individual characteristics, includ-\ning personality, past experiences, unique skills, and cultural\nbeliefs, may affect the role. Individuals also modify the role\nby imposing their own expectations to better fit their person-\nality. This relates well to role diversification, because it rec-\nognizes the changing nature of roles and acknowledges the\npossibility for adopting new role behaviors.\nYellin aimed to better understand role-acquisition dynamics\nand also considered a role to be a set of expectations based\non behaviors, attitudes, skills, and knowledge, and that indi-\nviduals influence expectations through modification and\nnegotiation. Yellin proposed that transitions between phases\nof role acquisition are marked by specific events that signify\na move to the next phase and, at these points, individuals\nwould have a different understanding of the role.\nIn the first phase, ambivalence, individuals are exposed to\na new social network, and therefore have a vague conception\nof what is expected in the new role. This can lead to role\nambivalence or role disorientation. Individuals unfamiliar\nwith inquiry may be overwhelmed by the changed expecta-\ntions in this context compared with a traditional setting.\nIn the second phase, absorption, individuals familiarize\nthemselves with the new role through repetition, negotiation,\nand performance. Individuals begin to learn specific behav-\niors and expectations of the role very quickly, leading to\nchanges in self-image. The individual in the new role may\nfeel overwhelmed or frustrated. This phase explains a work-\nplace context well; however, it may not describe an inquiry\neducational setting as effectively because inquiry roles are\nhighly individualized based on student interest.\nIn the next phase, commitment, an acceptable perfor-\nmance in a particular role has already been attained and\ntherefore the person often receives positive feedback from\nothers in similar roles. Individuals identify with the role and\ncommit to it leading to enhanced self-worth. The role\nbecomes a part of the person. Yellin noted that, at this phase,\nconflict is also common because, when an individual accepts\nthat he or she is undertaking a new role, it may not match the\nindividual's previously existing roles. For example, the role\nof organizer at school may conflict with a disorganized envi-\nronment at home. This is relevant to inquiry in which role\ndiversification involves taking on multiple roles; however, it\ndiffers in that these multiple roles are usually adopted in one\nsetting.\nIn the final phase, confidence, the role becomes predict-\nable and confidence increases. The individual is able to\nanticipate and plan responses in advance based on others'\nexpectations. Although this can reduce anxiety, it can also\nlead to boredom because there are only slight changes or per-\nformance variations in the role. The struggle in this phase\ntherefore becomes finding methods to renew motivation, for\nexample, adding responsibilities to the role or taking on a\nnew role. This is relevant to inquiry environments, known to\nfoster motivation in students, perhaps due to the role diversi-\nfication that occurs in inquiry, leading to new challenges and\npromoting excitement when novel roles are enacted.\nTurner (2002) detailed several characteristics that related\nwell to role acquisition. Interactional theories assume that\nrole behavior derives from social interactions and that roles\nare broader and represent a \"comprehensive pattern for\nbehavior and attitude that is linked to an identity, is socially\nidentified more or less clearly as an entity, and is subject to\nbeing played recognizably by different individuals\" (p. 234).\nWalker and Shore 7\nThis may be relevant to a more open-ended context such\nas inquiry, in which students and teachers can engage in mul-\ntiple roles simultaneously. Expectations and interactions\nwith others shape the role acquisition. Roles are learned\nthrough observations made as children, and are learned in\nsets or pairs, for example, the roles of student and teacher.\nWhen individuals in the set learn about each other's roles,\nrole transitions are facilitated. Depth of roles can vary: They\ntend to persist, be difficult to change, and require extensive\nsupport during transitions. This may explain why some stu-\ndents struggle when newly engaged in inquiry. If we can\nlearn more about role diversification, we can better support\nstudents during these transitions.\nSpecific to role acquisition is Turner's role-allocation\nconcept: The individual works toward a certain role while\nothers either facilitate or hinder his or her progression, which\nthen invokes a negotiation process. For example, if a student\nasked a genuine question in class but during an inappropriate\ntime, the teacher may chastise this student as disruptive\nrather than view her or him as inquisitive, hindering acquisi-\ntion of a questioner role.\nProposed Four-Process Inquiry\nFramework\nHaving a framework to help explain common processes in\ninquiry can provide methods to better support students and\nteachers in implementing this form of education. As previ-\nously highlighted, one must take into account attitudes and\nbeliefs, behaviors, norms, expectations, previous experience,\nand social factors. In addition, the inquiry continuum is an\nessential consideration because inquiry classrooms will look\ndifferent depending on whether they are more teacher-directed\nor student-centered, and this can therefore influence role pro-\ncesses in inquiry. Student-centered inquiry classrooms may be\nmore facilitative of role diversification than teacher-directed\ninquiry classrooms. Another key variable that several models\nhave not addressed is the individual's developmental level,\nwhich becomes especially applicable in school settings.\nFramework processes are described predominantly from\nthe student's perspective for the sake of simplicity; however,\nteachers or other individuals in the classroom system may\nalso undergo similar processes in an inquiry environment.\nSeveral of the models previously described focused heavily\non the cognitive components of role acquisition and diversifi-\ncation, whereas the proposed framework emphasizes both\ncognitive and behavioral components. Based on the above\nmodels, an inquiry framework is proposed, including the pro-\ncesses of exploration, engagement, stabilization, and diversi-\nfication. This is not a stage model wherein each process\nnecessarily follows chronologically. Diversification can take\nplace in a nondevelopmental manner if the inquiry classroom\nfacilitates the process. Within the proposed framework, diver-\nsification has the potential to emerge in the context of explo-\nration, engagement, or stabilization. For the most part, the\nprocess of diversification builds on skills acquired during the\nstabilization process that builds on skills acquired during the\nengagement process, which in turn builds on skills acquired\nduring the exploration process; however, these processes can\nand do overlap. The process of engagement may occur at dif-\nferent rates, or a student may experience stabilization prior to\nengagement in certain inquiry situations (e.g., one student\nmight be very committed to working within a collaborative\ngroup before fully engaging as an individual in inquiry).\nFurthermore, a student can gain some practice with diversifi-\ncation during the exploration process when general inquiry\nrules and expectations are being introduced. These processes\nare, therefore, adaptable in terms of the timing of their occur-\nrence (see Figure 1).\nExploration\nInquiry classrooms often run against teachers', students', and\neven parents' expectations, which heavily influence roles and\nrole acquisition. As supported by Thornton and Nardi (1975),\nexploration involves learning about the implicit and explicit\nschool and classroom rules as they pertain to inquiry in addi-\ntion to different roles that are possible in inquiry classrooms.\nShore etal. (2009) identified elements of student knowledge\nessential to inquiry success and suggested that inquiry can\noccur without an abundance of specific formal information;\nhowever, students do require pertinent language, symbols,\nand skills to be considered inquiry literate.\nUnlike more traditional classrooms in which students have\nsome idea of what to expect, an inquiry classroom contains\nseveral differences that might run counter to students' initial\nFigure 1. Visual representation of proposed inquiry framework\ncontaining four processes of engagement, exploration,\nstabilization, and diversification.\n8 SAGE Open\nexpectations about their different roles as students coming\ninto the classroom. For example, some students expect to\nlearn and memorize facts instead of generalized skills that can\nbe applied in many different settings (Bramwell-Rejskind,\nHalliday, & McBride, 2008). This is also partially consistent\nwith Yellin's (1999) conception of the ambivalence phase in\nwhich an individual only has a vague idea of what to expect\nin the new role. Similarly, Yellin highlighted the challenges of\ncontinuing in the new role once motivation is lost. This idea\nis relevant to students who struggle adjusting to an inquiry\nenvironment, and this may lead to underachievement.\nConflicting expectations may make it more difficult for\nstudents to initially engage within an inquiry-student role.\nThis also depends on the teacher's inquiry experience and\nhow well the classroom is structured based on the students'\nprior inquiry experience. As a hypothetical example, consider\nEmily, a fifth-grade student beginning her very first inquiry-\nbased unit on the environment. Her teacher has just presented\ninformation about the qualities that will be expected of stu-\ndents throughout the course of the upcoming unit, including\ntaking risks and exploring new ideas. Emily has never heard\nof some of these inquiry qualities and begins to feel over-\nwhelmed by these initial expectations. The assignment for the\nday is to work with a partner to choose one of the described\nqualities and select a magazine image that illustrates that\nquality of an inquirer. Emily does not know many students\nwell, and she is the last student to choose a partner. After 5\nmin, Emily and her partner have still not decided which qual-\nity they should choose. The teacher announces that it is time\nto present their image to the class, and Emily begins to feel\nanxious because they are not finished.\nThis example illustrates how exploration involves learn-\ning about an inquiry setting and how the role expectations in\nthese environments may differ dramatically from role expec-\ntations in a traditional classroom setting. For example, Emily\nnot only had to make her own partner selection, but she also\nwas responsible for choosing the assignment theme and\nimage. This activity required initiative, teamwork, commu-\nnication, and creativity. These differing role expectations can\ncreate challenges for some students, at least at particular\ntimes.\nEngagement\nEngagement is a process in which the inquiry student begins\nto formally adopt and engage in an inquiry-student role, such\nas a question-asker role. The pupil also begins to learn about\nspecific obligations that are expected of an inquiry student,\nfor example, generating questions, taking initiatives, listen-\ning and discussing respectfully, organizing information, and\ninterpreting data effectively for oneself and others (Shore\nSamarapungavan, Patrick, and Mantzicopoulos (2011)\nexamined the development of inquiry process variables within a\nkindergarten population and also the impact of science-inquiry\nactivities on student learning and motivation. The Science\nLearning Assessment\u00adVersion 2 (Samarapungavan,\nMantzicopoulos, Patrick, & French, 2009; Samarapungavan\net\nal., 2011) was administered, and this assessment included\nitems addressing student's understanding of inquiry processes\nand content. They also differentiated between pre-inquiry,\ninquiry, and post-inquiry phases. Pre-inquiry activities were\ndescribed as \"whole class activities that are meant to activate\nchildren's prior knowledge, introduce the purpose of the inves-\ntigations, and provide children with the framework for tasks at\nthe engagement process of the proposed framework. The\ninquiry phase involves active involvement in inquiry activi-\nties and post-inquiry activities refer to reflection on learning\nand sharing what was learned with others. With appropriate\nscaffolding, Kindergarten pupils developed complex under-\nstandings of the processes required to engage in scientific\ninquiry.\nConflict may arise during the engagement process when\ntraditional student-role expectations are contrasted with the\nexpectations of an inquiry-student role. For example, some\nstudents do not believe that they should have input on cur-\nricular content (Wolf & Fraser, 2008). In other cases, inquiry\nexpectations and cultural beliefs or values may conflict. For\nexample, Chinese students may consider questioning the\nteacher as being disrespectful (Li, 2003).\nEngagement is similar to previously described models but\nalso differs in critical ways. Matching Thornton and Nardi's\n(1975) beliefs, prior expectations influence the engagement\nprocess; however, consensus levels may differ. Thornton and\nNardi conceptualized their second phase as involving a high\ndegree of consensus; however, in inquiry, engagement may\ninvolve some degree of conflict when expectations do not\nmatch the inquiry classroom's reality. Thornton and Nardi's\nmodel may apply better to work environments in which a\nhigh degree of role consensus is expected or even necessary,\nat least during the enactment or carrying out versus the plan-\nning of work. Disagreements in inquiry occur often and can\nsometimes be advantageous when they lead to a leveling of\nintragroup power relationships and improvement in under-\nstanding another individual's perspective (Barfurth & Shore,\nspecific workplace settings, the element of learning specific\nrole behaviors in Yellin's absorption phase is similar to\ninquiry engagement.\nContinuing with the hypothetical example of Emily, her\nclass is now well into the environment unit. Emily has learned\na lot about how an inquiry classroom functions. The most\nrecent assignment involves working in a small group to brain-\nstorm different ways to recycle or re-use common household\nitems. A member of Emily's group asks her if she has any\nideas. Emily describes how she saves yogurt cups for organiz-\ning her beads. Her group members excitedly write down her\ncreative idea, and later Emily asks a question to one of the\nmembers about his idea for recycling and reusing items from\nWalker and Shore 9\nhome. In this part of the example, Emily begins to learn the\nvalue of question asking and discussing respectfully in a team\nsetting, indicating she is demonstrating engagement.\nStabilization\nStabilization involves solidifying a student or teacher's com-\nmitment to working within an inquiry classroom. It occurs\nonce the individual has explored various inquiry-role expec-\ntations, he or she has found it to be a positive experience, and\nthen he or she has fully engaged in its expectations. At this\npoint, inquiry-literate individuals positively value collabora-\ntion, are comfortable with problems that are not well defined,\nlook for patterns across knowledge areas, think imagina-\ntively and critically, and acknowledge multiple solutions to\ninteractions among those who have committed to inquiry\ninfluence the role-acquisition process. Thornton and Nardi\n(1975) considered the informal phase to feature increased\nconflict; however, in inquiry, due to the struggle experienced\nduring engagement, students' conflicting sentiments will\nmost likely be resolved before experiencing stabilization.\nEmerging inquirers will usually have already experienced\ndiffering expectations and may have accepted a certain level\nof uncertainty. According to Yellin's (1999) commitment\nphase, the role becomes a part of the individual's identity.\nYellin's assertion that this phase is characterized by increased\nconflict may also be more relevant to diversification, when\nthe individual adopts multiple and varied roles. Perhaps the\ncontent and nature of the conflicts might be different.\nWithin Emily's classroom, the students are working on\nanother unit activity, and have been asked to write a hypo-\nthetical letter to the mayor of the city proposing a new way\nfor the city to help protect the environment. With the new\ninquiry skills Emily has been learning throughout the unit,\nincluding researching online and obtaining input from a fel-\nlow classmate, she has proposed a yearly event in which\nmembers of the community join together to collect litter, fol-\nlowed by a barbecue fund-raiser. The money raised will be\ninvested in purchasing environmentally friendly products for\nlocal businesses. After finishing the assignment, Emily\nbegan researching the possibility of making this proposal\ninto a real community event.\nIn this example, Emily fully engaged in the assignment\nand, through collaboration but also independence, Emily\ndeveloped an ambitious idea that she continued developing\neven after the assignment was completed. Emily has more\ncomfortably taken on a number of the actions and expecta-\ntions associated with being an inquirer.\nDiversification\nOnce a student has achieved a certain level of comfort and\ncommitment as an inquiry student, a more complex process\nmay emerge that involves adopting additional and varied\nroles within the classroom. This involves conscious risk-tak-\ning, because it is inherently more complex. There is also a\nmore complex social component involved when taking on\nthe role of another person. If one is engaging in another per-\nson's role who is in a position of authority (e.g., teacher or\nteam leader among students), this can also be intimidating\nand therefore a disincentive to diversify a role. For example,\nthe student in addition to a learner role may now also take on\na hypothesizer or explorer role while the teacher may adopt\nadditional learner or partner roles (Aulls & Ibrahim, 2012).\nComfort with each role on an individual level allows for the\nmore complex process of diversification to occur.Appropriate\nscaffolding from the teacher or from other students is critical\nto success here. The teacher is responsible for ensuring that\nstudents will be successful in the roles they adopt. This can\nbe overwhelming and this process, in particular, often repre-\nsents what has been previously conceptualized as the role\nAlthough the above processes were primarily described from\na student's perspective, teachers may go through a similar\nprocess when engaging in inquiry.\nDiversification differs from stabilization because one\nmay commit to a role simply because it is appealing or enjoy-\nable; however, diversification occurs once a student has felt\ncomfortable enough or has become bored with a particular\nrole. Diversification and stabilization can therefore overlap.\nWithin Emily's classroom, the students have been working\non their summative unit activity. In small groups, students\nhave been asked to prepare a short presentation for a younger\naudience about the importance of recycling. The group mem-\nbers have collected pertinent information and are now decid-\ning what information to present. As one student is describing\nthe information she would present, Emily asks her how she\nmight make the information easier to understand for the\nyounger audience. The group members then engage in a dis-\ncussion about how the information can be meaningfully pre-\nsented. This is an example of diversification because Emily\nhas not only taken on the role of presenter, but she has also\nengaged in the role of an audience member by imagining if\nsomeone younger would be able to understand the presented\ninformation. Later, Emily's teacher walks by and asks Emily\nto further explain her section of the presentation because this\nwas something she had never heard before. This is an addi-\ntional example of diversification because Emily has taken on\nthe roles of student and teacher, while the teacher has now\nalso taken on a learner role.\nSocial interaction and dialog are key qualities of an inquiry\nenvironment, and they influence the diversification process.\nFor example, observing other students participating in the\nprocess of diversification might model the process, therefore\npossibly facilitating their own diversification process.\nAlso relevant to inquiry diversification is Turner's (2002)\nfunctionality principle in which there is a distribution of\nresponsibilities among individuals who adopt different roles\nbased on their skills, knowledge, and diversity. For example,\nin a group, each student may have specific or unique skills,\nand with increased decision-making power in inquiry, mem-\nbers may decide that each person will adopt a specific role to\naccomplish the task, including recorder, investigator, or pre-\nsenter. In addition, Turner recognized that when individuals\nlearn about each other's roles, role transitions are facilitated.\nThis may also apply to adopting new or additional roles.\nThornton and Nardi (1975) recognized the importance of\nindividual characteristics in their final role-acquisition\nphase, the personal phase. They acknowledged variability\nwithin roles due to the influence of expectations from previ-\nous experience, cultural beliefs, and personality. This also\napplies to role diversification and influences which addi-\ntional roles each student adopts. Diversification differs from\nYellin's (1999) final confidence phase in which roles\nbecome predictable. In an inquiry environment, the stu-\ndent's role is always changing because it expands and incor-\nporates several different roles. Yellin also accepted that a\npredictable role can lead to boredom and decreased motiva-\ntion. Focusing on student interest in inquiry somewhat pro-\ntects against these problems and facilitates motivation in the\nclassroom, making it advantageous, especially during diver-\nsification (Aulls & Shore, 2008). Diversification is more\nconsistent with Turner's (2002) interactional theory due to a\nrole's changing nature as well as the possibility for role cre-\nativity, which becomes a reality during this phase. Turner\nalso recognized that some roles are resistant to change.\nPerhaps this helps explain why some students struggle in\ninquiry. If they experience difficulty during any of the above\nprocesses, they may struggle in a setting in which role diver-\nsity is embraced.\nConclusion\nTheory is important to practice and provides a foundation for\nunderstanding complex phenomena. By reviewing tenets\nfrom role theory and role acquisition, a new or expanded\nframework was proposed that included a previously missing\nconceptualization, namely, inquiry-role diversification. The\npresent article offers a theory-based framework to help\nunderstand this process, applying tenets from role theory to a\nspecific process common in inquiry-based learning environ-\nments, namely, diversification. Better understanding of\ninquiry processes is important because inquiry education is\ncentral to numerous, ongoing, curricular reforms. Based on\nsocial-constructivist principles, inquiry can greatly improve\nthe learning environment. Currently, several inquiry phe-\nnomena are not fully understood, including role diversifica-\ntion that is frequently observed, but not well described.\nOur proposed framework for inquiry roles contains\nfour processes: exploration, engagement, stabilization,\nand diversification. During exploration, implicit and\nexplicit inquiry classroom rules are learned. Engagement\nis characterized by formally adopting and learning spe-\ncific role expectations of being an inquirer. Stabilization\nis characterized by commitment to being an inquirer.\nDuring diversification, individuals adopt different, addi-\ntional roles in the classroom. Limited research has been\nconducted on these processes, and the proposed frame-\nwork provides a previously unavailable conceptualiza-\ntion of this complex phenomenon.\nLimitations\nAlthough the proposed framework for inquiry roles incorpo-\nrated and synthesized several role-related tenets and was\nbased on role theory, additional empirical evidence examin-\ning each process and its specific characteristics is needed.\nImplications\nTeachers and students.A deeper understanding of role\ndiversification can provide teachers and students with a\nbetter sense of success in inquiry environments. Success in\ninquiry is measured differently, and not all students always\nachieve their full potential in inquiry classrooms. However,\nif greater knowledge is gained regarding roles, role acquisi-\ntion, and particularly role diversification, then strategies\ncan be developed to help facilitate transitions for students\nwho are struggling to adapt to inquiry's role-diversification\nchallenges.\nFurthermore, better understanding of these complex pro-\ncesses will help improve evaluation criteria within inquiry.\nIf students better understand how learning occurs within\ninquiry, this may contribute to a sense of empowerment,\nrather than frustration in inquiry. For example, if a student is\nstruggling to meet an assignment deadline, but is working\nhard on a topic of interest, this student might be penalized\nwithin a traditional classroom setting. However, in inquiry,\nthis student could be considered to be experiencing stabili-\nzation, a very positive and advanced learning process.\nConsultants and educational developers. The proposed frame-\nwork has multiple implications for school psychologists,\ncounselors, subject-matter consultants, and other profession-\nals because it presents a developmental understanding of a\ncentral phenomenon in inquiry classrooms. Specifically, this\nresearch carries implications for assessment, and in planning\ninterventions for struggling students. As inquiry becomes\nincreasingly central to curricula, classroom environments are\nchanging. The inquiry setting can be quite different from a\ntraditional classroom; it can often be busy and noisy due to\nstudents' enthusiasm about playing a much more active role\nin their learning. Examining student roles in the classroom\nand how these might affect learning would be a useful tool\nduring classroom observations for students with learning\ndifficulties.\nA consultant or educational developer's view of typical\nbehavior in the classroom might need to be altered consider-\nably in inquiry environments. Typical behavior in inquiry\nclassrooms (e.g., students actively investigating their own\neducational interests) might be considered inappropriate or\ndysfunctional in a traditional classroom setting. Properly com-\nprehending inquiry phenomena, for example, role diversifica-\ntion, in which the student may take on teachers' roles by\nchallenging presented information and asking questions, will\nlead to a better understanding of what should be considered\nappropriate classroom behavior. The same applies to what con-\nstitutes success in a classroom. Conditions for success vary\nconsiderably in an inquiry context. Success on an inquiry task\nmay not be based on the outcome alone, but perhaps also on\nhow much the student persevered or took on additional roles to\ninvestigate the concept.\nIn addition, students often act out because they are bored.\nSuch behavior may be decreased in an inquiry setting in\nwhich learning is shaped by students'interests. Furthermore,\ninquiry regularly requires group problem solving and dis-\nagreements can therefore occur often, but these can lead to\nimportant social and cognitive gains (Barfurth & Shore,\n2008). Such interpersonal disputes should not necessarily be\nconsidered dysfunctional. Overall, the classroom context\nhas a huge impact on student and teacher behavior.\nResearchers.This review has implications for plotting the\ngrowth of inquiry in a classroom, school, or among teachers\nand students. For example, if a student is experiencing\nincreased conflict in the classroom, perhaps this suggests that\nthe individual is experiencing engagement or even stabiliza-\ntion and not necessarily failing or underperforming in the\ninquiry setting. In addition, researchers could focus on the four\nprocesses of inquiry in future studies about classroom interac-\ntions. For example, it might be possible to develop a qualita-\ntive checklist for a classroom observation based on the\ndescriptions of each process; however, further empirical\nresearch will be required to validate the proposed theoretical\nframework.\nAuthors' Note\nCheryl L.
