    "reduced_content": "The possibility of genotype\u00adenvironment inter-\naction for memory performance and change was\nexamined in 150 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs from\nthe Swedish Adoption Twin Study of Aging (SATSA).\nWe used an MZ twin pair difference approach to\nexamine the possibility that genotype was associ-\nated with intrapair variability and thus suggestive of\ngenotype\u00adnonshared environment interactions.\nMultiple `variability genes' were found for longitudi-\nnal change in a semantic memory task including\ncandidates coding for apolipoprotein E (APOE) and\nestrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) as well as serotonin\ncandidates (HTR2A and 5HTT). One candidate also\nrelated to variability in change in episodic memory\n(5HTT). Of the significant associations observed,\ngenerally results indicated that MZ pairs who carry\nputative risk alleles were less variable than noncarri-\ners, suggesting that noncarriers may be more\nsensitive to environmental contexts. We sought to\n`contextualize' the possible nonshared environmen-\ntal influences for found gene\u00adenvironment (G \u00d7 E)\neffects by considering intrapair differences in mea-\nsured social and stress factors, including social\nsupport, life events and depressive symptoms.\nResults suggested that nonshared environmental\ninfluences associated with depressive symptoms\nmay moderate the G \u00d7 E relationship observed for\nESR1 and APOE and longitudinal semantic memory\nchange whereby noncarriers of putative risk alleles\nmay be relatively more sensitive to depression-\nevoking environmental contexts than carriers of the\nrisk allele. Thus, the contexts that facilitate or\nreduce depressive symptoms may affect semantic\nmemory resiliency dependent on genotype. Further\nwork ought to consider larger sample sizes as well\nas consider additional social and contextual factors.\nCognitive health in old age reflects accumulating bio-\nlogical, environmental and random influences over\nthe life course that may interact with one another.\nWith age, environmental factors, particularly person-\nspecific factors, play an increasingly important role in\nindividual differences in cognitive change across\ndomain (Reynolds et al., 2005). These nonshared\nenvironmental influences may suggest the presence of\ngene\u00adenvironment interactions (G \u00d7 E). If not directly\nmodeled, G \u00d7 E will become part of the estimate for\nnonshared environment (Falconer, 1989). Thus, it is\nimportant to consider specific environmental factors\nthat may affect one's cognitive resiliency and to look\nat how these may interact with genotypic characteris-\ntics. However, relatively little is known about either\nspecific environmental candidates or specific gene\ncandidates for cognitive decline let alone potential\ngene\u00adenvironment interactions. The only gene to have\nreceived much attention is APOE, which codes for\nthe primary cholesterol transporter in the brain,\napolipoprotein E (apoE). Social environment and\nemotional influences on cognitive aging have received\nlittle attention although some relatively recent find-\nings suggest stressful life experiences, social support,\nand socioecomic factors may influence cognitive\nchange (e.g., Beland et al., 2006; Holtzman et al.,\ndate have examined potential candidate gene\u00ad\nenvironment interactions involving social factors and\ncognitive aging traits.\nCandidate Socio-Environmental Factors\nCognitive reserve in late life may be affected by early\nlife or mid-life environmental factors (see Borenstein\ngood cognitive health in older age may be dispropor-\ntionately afforded to those who are socioeconomically\nadvantaged in early life, such that health-promoting\nenvironments and behaviors may coalesce. Socio-\neconomic status (SES) and related factors have been\nexamined as measured environmental effects in\ngene\u00adenvironment interaction analyses for general\nintelligence in adolescence (Harden et al., 2007),\ndementia and AD (see Borenstein et al., 2006).

Social or stress-related factors\npredictive of cognitive decline and/or dementia include\nlower social engagement or support, stress, and higher\ndepressive symptoms.\nSocial Support\nLower social support and social engagement have\nbeen associated with cognitive change in community-\nbased samples (e.g., Beland et al., 2005; Holtzman et\nal., 2004). For example, poorer cognitive functioning\nwas associated with lower participation in community\nactivities and lower family support, while cognitive\ndecline over a period of 7 years was associated with\nlower participation in community events at baseline\n(Beland et al., 2005). It should also be noted that\nchanges in social participation can occur due to cogni-\ntive decline. Cognitive loss can interfere with ability to\nengage socially; or cognitive loss could create a greater\nneed for social support from family.\nStress\nThere is a strong argument based on rodent, primate,\nand human studies that life stress that occurs early in\nlife or that is chronic may predispose to impaired hip-\npocampal functioning (e.g., Brunson et al., 2005;\nsome epidemiological evidence supporting an associa-\ntion between life stress and poorer memory\nperformance (e.g., VonDras et al., 2005).\nDepression\nThe occurrence of depressive symptoms may predict\nlater cognitive decline or dementia (Sachs-Ericsson et\nal., 2005) although the relationship is unclear. In par-\nticular, depressive symptoms might be early indicators\nof Alzheimer's disease (Wetherell et al., 1999) rather\nthan a risk factor. Indeed stress exposure may lead\nboth to increased depressive symptoms and cognitive\nCandidate Genes\nCandidate genes for cognitive aging traits have been\nless well studied than for the dementias such as\nAlzheimer's disease (AD). Dozens of candidates have\nbeen examined with respect to AD with the APOE gene\nshowing the most consistent association (see Blomqvist\ndidate gene association studies have been published for\ncognitive aging traits, and APOE is the most well\nknown candidate with associations found for cognitive\nfunctioning in general although most consistently for\nmemory performance (see Anstey & Christensen,\n2000). Mixed support has been observed for estrogen\nreceptor alpha (ESR1) and cognitive performance,\nimpairment and AD risk (e.g., Corbo et al., 2006;\nassociations for women but not men (e.g., Porrello et\nal., 2006) and where an association is found it is often\nmoderated by APOE e4 allele status. Indeed, a recent\nstudy of men and women suggests that APOE\nexpression may mediate the relationship between ESR1\nvariants and AD risk (Corbo et al., 2006): low serum\napoE levels, as observed in those with AD, were\nobserved for ESR1 homozygotes for the PvuII and XbaI\nvariants that also carried the APOE e4 allele. The\nextent to which ESR1 may be related to nonpathologi-\ncal cognitive change is of interest.\nIn nondemented twins from the Swedish Adoption\nTwin Study of Aging (SATSA) study we have observed\nassociations of APOE with working memory perfor-\nmance and change, A2M (which codes for the apoE\nligand alpha2-macroglubulin) with episodic figural\nmemory change (Reynolds, Prince, et al., 2006), and\nassociation of HTR2a (which codes for serotonin 2A\nreceptors) with episodic figural memory change\nGene\u00adEnvironment Interaction\nPsychosocial factors have been understudied as modi-\nfiers of gene\u00adphenotype relationships. Much of what we\nknow relates to physical environment factors or health-\nrelated factors. For example, studies have indicated\nmoderation of the APOE e4 AD risk association by the\noccurrence of head injury (e.g., Mayeux et al., 1995) and\nof APOE e4 status coupled with head injury increased\nthe risk of AD ten-fold which well exceeded the additive\neffect of each risk factor alone (Mayeux et al., 1995).\nThe increased risk of AD due to father's manual occupa-\ntion level was only observed for those who were APOE\ne4 positive (Moceri et al., 2001). Beyond SES, psychoso-\ncial factors measured later in life have not yet been\nexamined as potential modifiers of the relationship\nbetween APOE e4 and AD risk.\nWe know even less about gene\u00adenvironment interac-\ntions for cognitive traits. Neuropsychological\nperformance after head injury has been examined for\nnondemented patients between the ages of 16 and 65\nyears where APOE e4 carriers showed worse cognitive\nperformance on verbal memory, attentional and percep-\ntual speed tasks 6 months after the injury (Ariza et al.,\nhypertension predicted poorer cognitive performance in\nparticipants from the Nurses' Health Study (Kang et al.,\n2005). In terms of social factors, higher heritability esti-\nmates for childhood and adolescent cognitive ability\nhave been observed as social status and prosperity levels\nincrease suggesting the presence of a G \u00d7 E interaction\nIn light of the findings described above that suggest\nenvironmental influences may moderate the APOE cog-\nnitive performance or dementia risk associations, APOE\nmay act as a `variability gene' for normative cognitive\nchange. Whereas typical candidate gene\u00adphenotype asso-\nciation studies examine differences in phenotypic means\nor disease risk by genotype or allele status, candidate\ngene association with measures of trait variability, that\nis, `variability genes' (Berg et al., 1989), can be viewed as\ntesting gene\u00adenvironment interaction (Berg et al., 1989;\nChandra A. Reynolds, Margaret Gatz, Stig Berg, and Nancy L. Pedersen\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core. ReadCube, on 11 Sep 2016 at 00:33:51, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at http:/www.cambridge.org/core/terms.\nto make use of MZ twins given that within-pair differ-\nences would reflect nonshared environmental influences.\nFor example, Magnus and colleagues (Magnus et al.,\n1981) observed that MZ twin pairs who carried the M\nallele in the MN blood system showed less intrapair vari-\nation for serum cholesterol values than MZ pairs who\nwere NN homozygotes. If within-pair differences varied\nby genotype (e.g., M+ or NN status) that would indicate\nthe presence of gene-nonshared environment interac-\ntions, that is, differential sensitivity to the environment\ndependent on genotype. In the spirit of Berg et al.\n(1989), the extent to which APOE may be a `variability\ngene' in adolescence was examined by comparing\nwithin-pair differences among MZ twins for several lipid\nand lipoprotein traits (plasma cholesterol, triglycerides,\nand LDL cholesterol, and apoB and apoE lipoproteins)\nstratified by APOE phenotypes (de Knijff et al., 1993).\nPatterns of findings suggested that apoE e3e4 pairs were\nless variable than e2e3 or e3e3 pairs for plasma choles-\nterol, LDL cholesterol, and apoE lipoprotein across all\nmethods to assess intrapair differences. However, the\nintrapair differences amongst the different apoE pheno-\ntype classes were not significant. The authors concluded\nthat APOE may not be a variability gene for these\nplasma lipids and lipoproteins in adolescence.\nThe Current Study\nAlthough it appears that APOE may not be a variabil-\nity gene in adolescence per se (de Knijff et al., 1993),\nAPOE and other relevant gene candidates may act as\nvariability genes in later adulthood. Longitudinal\ngrowth curve analyses of cognitive measures tapping\nmemory abilities (Information, Digit Span, and\nThurstone Picture memory task) indicate increasing\ngenetic influences with age that may suggest that in\nlate life new genes come `online', or genetic influences\nmay become amplified. Indeed, prior studies have sug-\ngested APOE as a candidate for differential memory\nchange. Of particular interest for the current study is\nthe accumulating nonshared environmental variance\nfor all verbal, spatial, memory and perceptual speed\ntraits. The increasing nonshared environmental vari-\nance may suggest accumulations of environmental and\nrandom factors, as well as unspecified genotype-envi-\nronment interaction (Falconer, 1989). The extent to\nwhich APOE and other candidates such as ESR1 and\nHTR2a may be variability genes for memory change is\nunknown. In the present study on gene\u00adenvironment\ninteraction we consider APOE as well as other puta-\ntive AD candidates to consider whether they influence\nvariability in nonpathological memory change. Using\nan MZ pair differences approaches (e.g., Berg et al.,\nfollowing questions:\n1. Is there evidence for genotype\u00adenvironment inter-\nactions for cognitive change traits that tap memory\nabilities?\n2. Do any genotype\u00adenvironment interactions for\ncognitive change involve measured social support\nfactors, stress, and depressive symptoms?\nMethods\nSample\nThe analyses focused on 150 MZ pairs in SATSA (see\ndata available on the selected cognitive tests from up\nto five waves of in-person testing (IPT). Of the 150\nMZ pairs, 88 were female and 62 were male.\nIncompleteness of data resulted in variable patterns of\ndata available for the estimated growth parameters\n(described below). Analyses of cognitive ability level\ncognitive and genotype information were available.\nZygosity status was established through serological\nanalysis or analysis of DNA markers for 89% of the\nassigned through questionnaire methods. The accu-\nracy of the questionnaire-based methods used is about\n112 MZ pairs with both genotypic plus cognitive\ndata, 96% had zygosity established by serological or\nDNA marker analysis. In the remaining 4% (four\npairs) only one twin had available DNA information\nand questionnaire-based zygosity was used.\nDementia status was known for twins in the study\nwith diagnostic information available up to May 2006\nbased on in-person work-up (through 2001) or\nmedical registry diagnosis (up to May, 2006). We set\nto missing cognitive data that occurred after the esti-\nmated age of onset for any twins identified as\ndemented. Subsequently, 22 pairs where one or both\nbecame demented had at least one time point of cogni-\ntive data prior to age of onset in the current study\n(three pairs were concordant for dementia). Of the 22\npairs, 12 pairs had at least two time-points (one con-\ncordant for dementia) and only three pairs had three\nor more time points prior to age on onset (none con-\ncordant for dementia).\nMeasures\nCognitive Measures\nFor the present study, we selected memory-related\nmeasures for which prior analyses indicated increases\nin nonshared environmental variance (Reynolds et al.,\n2005). All tap some aspect of memory: (a)\nInformation subtest, a typical test of crystallized intel-\nligence requires semantic memory (Jonsson &\nMolander, 1964); (b) Digit Span, the sum of forward\nand backward includes working memory and attention\n(Jonsson & Molander, 1964); and (c) Thurstone Picture\nMemory recognition task requires nonverbal episodic\nmemory (Thurstone, 1938). Prior to growth model\nTwin Research and Human Genetics April 2007\nCognitive Aging and Social Factors\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Finkel et al., 2003; Reynolds et\ndependency. (Not accounting for pair status could\naffect standard errors of the average growth parame-\nters, but significance testing was not of interest in this\nphenotypic analysis whose object was to estimate to\nindividual growth parameters.) The growth curves were\ncentered at age 65 years and thus the intercept and\nlinear slope reflected the average ability and rate of\nchange at 65 years, respectively, and the quadratic\nparameter the acceleration in change throughout the\nage range. A linear model was fit to the Digit Span data\nas the quadratic model was not supported; thus, the\nlinear slope was constant throughout the age range.\nIndividual empirical Bayes (EB) estimates were\nrequested for the growth parameters. EB estimates for\nlinear and quadratic were set to missing if there were\nfewer than two time points (linear) or fewer than three\ntime points (quadratic). For the current study, data\nwere only considered for further analysis if participants\nwere members of MZ pairs and where both in the pair\nhad available EB estimates.\nSocial and Stress Measures\nMeasures tapping social support and life events were\navailable from the first in-person assessment (IPT1).\nDepressive symptoms using the CES-D scale (Center\nfor Epidemiologic Studies-Depression; Radloff, 1977)\nwere available from the second in-person assessment\nSocial support. Nine questions from an adapted\nversion of the ISSI (Henderson et al., 1980) measured\nobserved and perceived social support. Each of the\nquestions determined the quantity of support of\nvarious types (number of friends, family, etc, that one\ncould rely on) and perceived support; that is, how sat-\nisfactory was the support that they received.\nResponses to the observed support items and per-\nceived support items were separately standardized and\nsummed to quantify objective and subjective support,\nrespectively (see Bergeman et al., 1990).\nLife Events. Twenty life event items (e.g., retirement,\ndeath of child, divorce) from an adapted version of the\nSocial Readjustment Rating Scale (Holmes & Rahe,\ndent's rating of perceived importance ratings and\nsummed (Plomin et al., 1990). In addition, a subset of\nevents that were considered `uncontrollable' were\nweighted and summed.\nDepressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were\nmeasured by the CES-D measure (Center for\nEpidemiologic Studies-Depression; Radloff, 1977).\nThe current analyses used the total score based on a\nsum of 20 items rated on a 0- to 3-point scale.\nGenotypes\nGenotyping was performed on DNA extracted from\nblood samples collected during the third in-person\nmeasurement occasion (IPT3). Genotyping of 16 SNPs\nacross 15 candidates are available for the present\nanalyses, including: Apolipoprotein E (APOE), 2-\nmacroglobulin (A2M), angiotensin converting enzyme\n(ACE), advanced glycosylation end product-specific\nreceptor (AGER), butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE),\ncathepsin D (CTSD), dihydrolipoamide s-succinyl-\ntransferase (DLST), estrogen receptor 1 alpha (ESR1),\nserotonin 5-HT-2A receptor (HTR2A), 5-hydrox-\nytryptamine transporter (5HTT), insulin-degrading\nenzyme (IDE), interleukin 1 receptor alpha (ILA1),\nlow density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1\n(LRP1), nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3), tumor necro-\nsis factor receptor superfamily, member 6 gene\n(TNFRSF6). Most were prior candidates for AD (see\nBlomqvist et al., 2006), and others for depression and\nnormative memory performance. The candidates can\nbe loosely organized in terms of pathways, such as\nthose connected to amyloid deposition (APOE, A2M,\nBCHE, CATD, LRP1), cardiovascular disease (ACE),\nestrogen (ESR1), inflammation (AGER, ILA1,\nTNFRFS6), insulin (IDE), oxidation (NOS3, DLST),\ninformative MZ pairs (cognitive data plus genotype\ninformation) only one twin was genotyped and the\nresultant genotypes were assigned to both twins.\nIdentification of the candidate SNP's are available\nin Appendix A. With the exception of the 5HTT and\n5HTR2A candidates, all SNPS (or insertion-deletion)\nwere sequenced using the dynamic allele-specific\nhybridization (DASH) method (Prince & Brookes,\nthe 5HTT and 5HTR2A candidates are described in\nJansson et al. (2003). Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium\n(HWE) was tested using all available SATSA twins by\nrandomly splitting MZ and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs\ninto two samples and testing HWE on both samples.\nHWE was found for 14 of 15 candidates in both\nsamples (p  .05). LRP1 failed in one out of the two\ntwin samples tested. Resequencing of LRP1 excluded\ngenotyping error; rather, the rarity of the TT genotype\nmay have led to significance. Bonferroni correction\nbased on 15 tests suggested LRP1 would achieve\nAnalyses\nAnalyses proceeded in three stages. First, we tested for\nheterogeneity using the method proposed by Fisher\n(1925) before proceeding to test whether G \u00d7 E effects\nmay be present for the empirical Bayes (EB) estimates.\nThis was done for untransformed EB estimates as well\nas for rank-normalized EB estimates. Second, to test\nfor specific candidate gene\u00adenvironment interactions\nwe conducted variance ratio tests (Martin et al., 1983)\nChandra A. Reynolds, Margaret Gatz, Stig Berg, and Nancy L.

Lastly, we examined\nthe association of absolute pair differences in EB esti-\nmates of cognitive change (linear or quadratic) to\nabsolute pair differences in social and stress measures\nin a series of regression analyses. Transformations of\nthe absolute pair difference variables were necessary to\nreduce nonnormality. For the social environment pair\ndifference variables log transformation to base 10 was\nused. However, pair differences in EB growth parame-\nter estimates were resistant to typical transformation\nand thus we rank-normalized and standardized the\nabsolute pair difference values prior to analysis.\nResults\nHeterogeneity Tests\nWe first performed heterogeneity tests as outlined by\nof this test, if significant, would suggest mixtures of\ndistributions of differences, and thus would give some\nconfidence to proceed with formal tests of candidate\nG \u00d7 E. The Fisher (1925) heterogeneity test in effect\ncompares the mean of squared pair differences to the\nmean of absolute pair differences. The comparison is\nexpected to be greater than 0, thus we used a one-\ntailed significance criteria. Table 1 reports the findings\nfor untransformed and rank-normalized EB estimates\nfor growth, to examine the extent to which rescaling\nmay reduce the potential G \u00d7 E effect. A t statistic was\nconstructed with degrees of freedom based on the\nnumber of MZ pairs less one. Generally the observed\nheterogeneity effects for the untransformed EB growth\nparameters estimates were resistant to rescaling\nalthough not invariably, that is, the intercept for\nInformation became nonsignficant and the quadratic\nchange estimate for Thurstone's Picture Memory task\nwas at trend significance. However, transformation\nmay remove true G \u00d7 E effects and thus we proceeded\nwith G \u00d7 E variance ratio tests on untransformed vari-\nables although caution is warranted in over\ninterpretation of effects.\nVariance Ratio Test: G \u00d7\n\u00d7 E\nAfter finding evidence of heterogeneity, we proceeded\nwith tests of genotype\u00adenvironment interaction for all\ngene candidates, where we compared within-pair differ-\nences for those pairs who carried a putative risk allele\nversus those who did not carry the risk allele (e.g.,\nAPOE e4 carriers versus noncarriers; see Martin et al.,\n1983). The results of the variance ratio test will suggest\nwhether particular genotypes may be more sensitive to\nas yet anonymous nonshared environmental factors,\nresulting in greater environmental variability, or those\nthat may be relatively impervious to environmental\nfactors and show smaller environmental variability.\nBased on prior literature we identified particular alleles\nas being risk alleles (e.g., APOE e4) and otherwise the\nless frequent allele was considered as the risk allele.\nMean squared errors (MSE) for each genotype were esti-\nmated from analysis of variance (ANOVA) of twin pair\nnumber predicting the estimated EB growth parameter\nestimates. The variance ratio test was then conducted by\ntaking the largest MSE over the smaller MSE and com-\nparing the resulting F statistic to the appropriate\none-sided F-table and then doubling the p value as this\nis considered a two-tailed test with no specific predic-\ntion of which genotype group would show the larger\nTwin Research and Human Genetics April 2007\nCognitive Aging and Social Factors\n\n\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

In addition we report the ratio of MSEs of the\nrisk versus nonrisk groups (see Tables 2 and 3). If the\nrisk to nonrisk ratio is above 1.0 then the MZ pairs who\nare risk allele carriers show greater intrapair variability\nand would be characterized as more sensitive to environ-\nmental factors than noncarriers. If the risk ratio is less\nthan 1.0 then the risk allele carriers show less variability\nthan noncarriers; in this case, those who carry risk alleles\nwould be characterized as relatively more impervious to\nenvironmental factors.\nSemantic Memory (Information)\nTable 2 reports variance ratio tests for the linear and\nquadratic EB estimates for Information. Results indi-\ncate significant G \u00d7 E effects for the linear change\ncomponent at 65 years for ESR1 and 5HTT where\nthose with the risk alleles were more than two times as\nvariable as noncarriers. Results indicate multiple signifi-\ncant G \u00d7 E effects for the quadratic change component\nfor: (1) APOE, ESR1 and 5HTR2A where carriers\nwere less variable than noncarriers, and (2) 5HTT and\nLRP1 where carriers were three times as variable as\nnoncarriers (see Figure 1). Trend significance was\nobserved for ACE. The intercept (information perfor-\nmance at 65 years) also exhibited two significant\ngenotype\u00adenvironment interactions (not shown in Table\n2): CATD with a ratio of .21 and HTT with a ratio of\n1.92. Trend significance was observed for APOE with a\nratio of .57 for the risk allele carriers (e4) versus\nnonrisk MZ pairs. Overall, ESR1 and 5HTT both\nshowed association with intrapair variability for the\nlinear and quadratic EB estimates. However, ESR1 risk\ncarriers show greater intrapair variability in linear slope\nat age 65 years yet smaller intrapair variability in qua-\ndratic estimates (as well as for intercept although not\nsignificant). For 5HTT, risk carriers showed signifi-\ncantly higher variability in intercept, linear trend at age\n65 and quadratic than nonrisk carriers.\nEpisodic Memory (Thurstone)\nTable 3 reports variance ratio tests for the linear and\nquadratic parameters for Thurstone Picture Memory\nrecognition test. Results indicate significant G \u00d7 E\neffects for the linear change component at 65 years for:\n(1) CATD where those carrying the risk allele were less\nvariable than noncarriers, and (2) IDE where those car-\nrying the risk allele were more variable than\nnoncarriers. Results indicate one significant F test for\nthe quadratic change component for 5HTT where risk\nallele carriers were less variable than noncarriers (see\nFigure 1). Thus, the results for Thurstone suggested one\ncommon candidate with Information, 5HTT. Unlike\nthat for Information, 5HTT risk carriers showed lower\nintrapair variability in the quadratic component for\nThurstone indicating less sensitivity to the environment\nthan nonrisk carriers. ESR1 showed a similar pattern in\nvariance for quadratic estimates to that found for\nInformation of lessened variability for carriers than\nnoncarriers but was not significant (p = .10).\nWorking Memory\nThe linear component for Digit Span exhibited no sig-\nnificant variance ratio tests.

Nonzero\ncorrelations might suggest that nonshared environ-\nmental influences are in common between social and\nstress factors and nonshared environmental influences\nobserved for cognitive change. As described above it\nwas necessary to transform the pair difference vari-\nables to reduce nonnormality. Table 4 presents\nPearson correlation coefficients for the transformed\npair difference variables. The correlations reflect the\nextent to which pair differences in social factors are\nassociated with pair differences in cognitive change.\nThe number of pairs varies widely for each social\nfactor considered given that both members of the pair\nmust have sufficient cognitive data as well. We consid-\nered correlations above .20 for further regression\nanalysis. Pair differences in the quadratic parameter\nfor Information were associated with pair differences\nin CES-D scores at .25, p < .05. For pair differences in\nlinear and quadratic components of Thurstone Picture\nMemory, the correlations with pair differences in life-\nevents were above .20, although significance tests\nsuggested p values that exceeded .05 in both cases.\nCorrelations remained essentially the same when pairs\nwhere one or both were demented were excluded.\nRegression analyses were conducted next to\nexamine whether gene candidates and stress factors\nidentified in G \u00d7 E and correlation analyses, respec-\ntively, might predict intrapair differences in cognitive\nchange, that is, linear (Thurstone) and quadratic\ncomponents (Information and Thurstone; see Table\n5). Of particular interest is to consider whether geno-\ntype might interact with pair differences in the\nmeasured stress factors in their relationship with pair\ndissimilarity in cognitive change. If so, this would\nsuggest the presence of differential genotypic sensitiv-\nity to particular nonshared environmental factors.\nThat is, we hoped to identify the nonshared `E' in the\nG \u00d7 E analyses conducted. The gene candidate pre-\ndictors (G) were coded such that those carrying the\nrisk allele were coded 1 and noncarriers were coded\nas 0. The transformed absolute intrapair differences\nin stress factors identified in the correlation analyses\n(total life events and CES-D) were considered the\nnonshared environmental factor (E) in the analyses.\nFinally, we constructed an interaction by multiplying\nthe two predictors (G \u00d7 E). Thus, a significant main\neffect of genotype (G) would indicate the effect for\nrisk allele carriers on absolute intrapair difference in\nthe cognitive change parameter, that is, whether\ngenotype is associated with differential environmen-\ntal variability for carriers versus noncarriers. A\nsignificant E effect would suggest that environmental\nvariability for stress or social factors was associated\nwith environmental variability for cognitive change.\nA significant interaction (G \u00d7 E) would indicate a dif-\nferential effect of genotype on the relationship of\nenvironmental variability for the social or stress\nfactor (E) with the environmental variability in the\ncognitive change parameter.\nTwo of eight regression analyses suggested a sig-\nnificant interaction of genotype by pair differences in\nstress. Both the APOE e4 and ESR1 candidates\nshowed an interaction with pair differences in CES-D\non absolute intrapair difference in the quadratic com-\nponent for Information (see Table 5). As indicated by\nthe regression analysis results, greater pair differences\nin CES-D scores are associated with greater pair dif-\nferences in nonlinear change in Information\nperformance over age for noncarriers of the APOE e4\nand ESR1 risk alleles (see Figures 1 and 2). The\nresults suggest greater sensitivity to environmental\nfactors associated with depressive symptoms for those\nwho do not carry risk alleles (i.e., APOE e4 or ESR1\ng allele, respectively).

Possible candidate variability genes\nwere identified as well as measured environmental\nfactors that may moderate genetic effects on cognitive\nchange. The candidate variability genes imply the\ninvolvement of serotonin, estrogen, and cholesterol\npathways while the measured social and stress envi-\nronmental factor indicate a possible role for\ndepression-relevant environmental features that may\nmoderate associations between genes and cognitive\nchange on semantic memory.\nVariance ratio tests suggested genotype-environ-\nment interactions for age-related change in\nmemory-loaded cognitive tasks. Multiple `variability\ngenes' were identified for cognitive change, in particu-\nlar, the ESR1 and HTT candidates. Furthermore,\nnonshared environmental influences attributable to\ndepressive symptoms may reflect in part the non-\nshared environmental influences for semantic memory\nchange that interact with genotype, but only for those\nwho do not carry the APOE e4 allele or noncarriers of\nthe ESR1 risk allele. Thus, noncarriers of these two\ncandidates may be more sensitive to depression-induc-\ning or depression-reducing elements of the\nenvironment than those who carry the risk allele and\nthus show greater variation in semantic memory\nchange. Put the other way, those who carry the risk\nallele may be relatively less affected by alterations in\nthe environment.\nThe identification of APOE and ESR1 as variabil-\nity genes for accelerating change in the semantic\nmemory task (Information) is of interest given the\nwell-known association of APOE and possibly ESR1\nwith cognitive change and AD risk as well as evidence\nsuggesting that the association between ESR1 variants\nwith AD risk may be mediated by apoE expression\n(Corbo et al., 2006). APOE has been associated with\ncompromised semantic memory performance in non-\ndemented adults where e4 carriers demonstrated\npoorer performance on word fluency tasks than non-\ncarriers (Rosen et al., 2005). However, differential\npreclinical memory profiles have not been routinely\nnoted for APOE e4 carriers versus noncarriers\nThe identification of serotonin-related candidates\n5HTT and HTR2A as variability genes implicates the\nserotonin system in variability in memory-related cog-\nnitive change. We note a prior association with\n5HTR2A and degree of episodic figural memory\nchange (Thurstone) over age (Reynolds, Jansson, et\nal., 2006). In the current study HTR2A was only asso-\nciated as variability gene for quadratic change for\nsemantic memory (Information). Given that serotonin\ncandidates have been associated primarily with differ-\nential risk of depressive disorders, we find it surprising\nthat there was a lack of interaction between intrapair\ndifferences in CES-D and 5HTT or 5HTR2A affecting\nenvironmental variability for semantic memory or\nepisodic figural memory change.\nIntrapair variability for depressive symptoms were\npositively associated with intrapair differences in\nsemantic memory change but only for those who do\nnot carry an APOE e4 allele (i.e., APOE e2e2, e2e3,\nor e3e3 genotypes), or those who do not carry the\nESR1 risk allele. Altogether, those who do not carry\nthe risk allele for APOE or ESR1, respectively, may be\nmore sensitive to depression-inducing or depression-\nreducing elements of the environment. This might\nsuggest that interventions for maintaining cognitive\nresiliency, including reducing stressors that otherwise\ncould lead to increases in depressive symptoms, would\nhave greater impact for those who do not carry risk\nalleles. This may paint a rather deterministic picture\nfor APOE e4 carriers at first glance. Yet, evidence sug-\nTwin Research and Human Genetics April 2007\nCognitive Aging and Social Factors\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Furthermore, multiple clin-\nical studies of adults suggest that APOE e4 carriers\nmay respond better to interventions that moderate\ndietary fat (e.g., via better lipid profiles) than noncar-\nriers (see Corella & Ordova, 2005), although\nstandardized replication studies are needed in light of\nthe many negative studies reported. Put more properly\ninto perspective, our results suggest that there may be\na narrower range of environmental factors that one\ncould target for intervention for APOE and ESR1 risk\nallele carriers.\nIn prior analyses of candidate gene association\nwith mean differences in cognitive change in nonde-\nmented SATSA twins, APOE was associated with\nchange in the working memory measure Digit Span\n(Reynolds, Prince, et al., 2006), but was not likewise\nChandra A.

However, in the former study the\namplified decline was observed for e4 homozygotes,\nwhereas in the present study we considered e4 hetero-\nand homzygotes together for sample size\nconsiderations. Similarly, A2M and 5HTR2A were\nassociated with mean differences in episodic figural\nrecognition change over age (Thurstone Picture\nMemory) in prior studies (Reynolds, Jansson, et al.,\ncase neither were identified as `variability genes' for\nepisodic figural recognition change.\nThus far we have focused the discussion on well-\nknown gene candidates or those showing multiple\nassociations with growth parameters within and in\none case across cognitive tests. Other variability genes\nmay include CATD and IDE. The current findings\nsuggest CATD is predictive of differential environmen-\ntal variability in semantic memory performance at 65\nyears (Information) and both CATD and IDE as pre-\ndictive of differential environmental variability for\nlinear change at 65 years, that is, turning points, for\nepisodic figural memory performance (Thurstone).\nHowever, there is little to suggest what the environ-\nmental contexts might be amongst the social and\nstress factors considered.\nOverall, sample sizes may limit the ability to find\nassociations for the growth parameter indices of\nchange because multiple time points are required to\nestimate them. Low power of the variance ratio test to\nfind G \u00d7 E effects could have hampered efforts further\n(see Martin et al., 1983). Where multiple associations\nwere found they were found primarily within rather\nthan across traits, that is, the Information subtest,\nwhich may be explained in part by correlation among\nthe growth parameters. The variation in the growth\nparameters estimated reflects systematic growth vari-\nance given the fitted quadratic model; that is,\noccasion-specific error is removed, which may have\naided the current study in finding the reported associa-\ntions although sample size was constrained.\nAdditional studies ought to be considered to see if the\nidentified gene candidates are replicated.\nLimitations\nLimitations of the current study include the use of a\ntwo-stage procedure to analyze G \u00d7 E effects on cogni-\ntive change. We estimated EB indices of growth\nparameters prior to conducting separate heterogeneity\nor variance ratio tests on multiple correlated growth\nparameter facets. Type I error rate may be a concern\nbecause of the multiple tests conducted (15 candidates\nper growth parameter considered). We screened first\nfor evidence of heterogeneity and then proceeded to\nvariance ratio tests which reduced the number of tests\nrequired. We then observed eight significant findings\nout of 45 tests for Information across intercept, linear\nslope and quadratic, three of 30 tests for Thurstone\nacross linear slope and quadratic, and none out of 15\ntests for Digit Span for the linear slope. If we applied a\nBonferroni adjustment within cognitive trait assuming\nmoderate correlation amongst growth parameters,\nonly the 5HTT and APOE candidates would remain\nsignificant for the linear and quadratic terms for the\nInformation subtest as identified. We also reduced the\nnumber of regression analyses with putative\nsocial/stress factors by examining the presence of asso-\nciation between intrapair differences in social-stress\nfactors with intrapair differences in cognitive change\nbefore proceeding to analyses including genotype. In\nso doing we may have missed possible antagonistic\ninteraction effects.\nTwo of the cognitive tests considered are not `pure'\nmeasures of memory per se, that is, Information and\nDigit Span. Information taps semantic memory but is\nmore commonly considered a marker of crystallized\nintelligence. We used the sum of forward and back-\nward Digit Span. Digit Span forward may more\nprominently tap attention, although working memory\nis captured by backward Digit Span. Altogether we\nmay be measuring memory-relevant general cognition\nrather than select memory process.\nScaling factors and true G \u00d7 E may both lead to\nevidence of heterogeneity (Martin, 2000), a precursor\nto testing for variance differences by genotypes in the\npresent study. Rescaling the growth parameters using\na rank-normalization procedure did not result in the\ndisappearance of all significant heterogeneity, particu-\nlarly for the linear and quadratic parameters.\nNonetheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that\nthe present results may in part reflect scaling artifacts\nrather than true G \u00d7 E. Replication studies using other\ntwin samples and other cognitive measures are needed.\nThe G \u00d7 E analyses necessarily included complete\nMZ twin pairs such that both members had to have\ndata from at least one cognitive testing occasion to be\nconsidered for tests of intercept, two or more occa-\nsions for tests of linear slope, and three or more\noccasions for tests of the quadratic parameter. If G \u00d7\nE interaction effects were present for age at death or\ndropout this could have biased the current results.\nFor example, if APOE e4 allele status was associated\nwith attrition then the remaining e4 positive pairs\nmay be less variable on verbal change due to their\njoint survival.\nConclusions\nThe current study highlights the importance of gene-\ncontext interplay on longitudinal cognitive resilience\nand decline in humans. Ours is the first to suggest\n`variability genes' for cognitive aging phenotypes.\nVariability genes include the well-known candidate\nAPOE as well as ESR1, 5HTR2A, 5HTT, CATD and\nIDE.
