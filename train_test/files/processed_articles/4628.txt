Indications for\nwarfarin treatment comprised atrial\nEbrillation, valve replacement, pulmonary\nembolism, deep vein thrombosis, stroke and\natrial flutter. Exclusion criteria included\nconcurrent use of drugs known to interfere\nwith warfarin, impaired hepatic function or\nrenal function, thyroid disease, malignancy\nor history of radiation therapy, and age <18\nyears. The target range for the INR was 1.8\u00ad\n3.0. The initial loading dose of warfarin was\n3 mg per day for the first 3 consecutive days.\nThe first INR was determined on the fourth\nday of treatment and subsequently twice a\nweek, and the dose was adjusted according\nto the findings. Complete warfarin dosing\ninformation was retrieved from medical\nrecords to determine the warfarin mainten-\nance dose, defined as the dose relating to the\naverage of three INR measurements within\nthe target range over a minimum period of 4\nweeks. Demographic data including sex,\nage, weight and height were recorded, in\naddition to indications for warfarin therapy,\nconcomitant diseases, and concurrent medi-\ncations.
