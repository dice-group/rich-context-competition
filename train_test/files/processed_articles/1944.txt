An extensive\nbody of research has demonstrated that perceived control\nshows moderately strong cross-sectional relations with lev-\nels of health and social support (Krause, 2007; Lachman &\nhowever, about possible antecedent\u00adconsequent relations\nbetween levels of functioning and subsequent changes\nacross the three domains. To examine the nature and corre-\nlates of such relations, we apply change score (CS) models\nto 9-year longitudinal data from two occasions of the na-\ntional Midlife in the United States survey (MIDUS). Specif-\nically, we (a) empirically compare competing unidirectional\nand multidirectional accounts of across-domain associa-\ntions and (b) explore if and how changes in one domain are\naccompanied by changes in another domain and whether\nthe strength of these relations differs with age, gender, and\neducation.\nAntecedent\u00adConsequent Relations of Perceived Control to\nHealth and Social Support\nPerceptions of control refer to beliefs about one's capa-\nbility to bring about a given outcome (Lachman & Weaver,\ntonomy and self-determination are generally considered to\nbe essential constituents of successful aging and show con-\nsiderable associations with indicators of adaptation (Baltes\n& Baltes, 1990; Lachman, Neupert, &Agrigoroaei, in press;\nis well established that perceived control shows sizeable\ncross-sectional associations with various health measures,\nincluding better physical and mental health, and a longer\nlife (Krause & Shaw, 2003; Kunzmann, Little, & Smith,\nvarious forms of social support (e.g., caring for and appre-\nciating the other, empathy, providing help) have been linked\nto perceived control (Antonucci, 2001; Cohen & Wills,\n1985). However, the directionality and developmental se-\nquences of such associations are less well understood and\nhave rarely been empirically examined, particularly when de-\nvelopmental changes across the three domains are considered\nconjointly. We draw from Lachman's (2006) integrative\nAntecedent\u00adConsequent Relations of Perceived Control to\nHealth and Social Support: Longitudinal Evidence for\nBetween-Domain Associations Across Adulthood\nDenis Gerstorf,1 Christina R\u00f6cke,2 and Margie E.

To examine antecedent\u00adconsequent relations of perceived control to health and social support across\nadulthood and old age.\nMethods. We applied (multigroup) change score models to two waves of data collected 9 years apart from 6,210\nparticipants of the Midlife in the United States survey (MIDUS, 24\u00ad75 years at baseline). We used composite\nmeasures of perceived control (personal mastery and constraints), health (chronic conditions, acute conditions,\nand functional limitations), and social support (support and strain associated with spouse/partner, family, and\nfriends).\nResults. Analyses revealed evidence for direct and independent multidirectional accounts. Greater initial control pre-\ndicted weaker declines in health and stronger increases in support. In turn, increases in control were predicted by better\ninitial health and more support. Changes in control were also accompanied by concurrent changes in the other two do-\nmains, and relations involving control were larger in size than those between health and support. We found only small\nsociodemographic differences across age, gender, and education group.\nDiscussion. We conclude that perceiving control may serve as both a precursor and an outcome of health and social\nsupport across the adult age range and suggest routes for further inquiry.\nKey Words: Biopsychosocial factors--Differential aging--Longitudinal--Midlife in the United States Survey--\nSuccessful aging.\nconceptual model and consider control beliefs to be both an\nantecedent and an outcome of adaptation in the health and\nIn this model, preserved control beliefs or a lack thereof\nare expected to have profound motivational and behavioral\nconsequences (e.g., engagement and persistence in activi-\nties, particularly in the face of difficulties) that in the long\nrun either restrain or help to exploit an individual's\nresources. Perceived control thus acts as an antecedent con-\ndition that fosters health or social support. Specifically, in-\ndividuals who report greater control beliefs are often more\ninclined to adopt and continue with health maintenance be-\nhaviors, such as exercise and preventive care (Rodin, 1986;\nSeeman, Unger, McAvay, & Mendes de Leon, 1999). Sense\nof control may also be an important factor in how well\npeople manage to actively seek out, mobilize, and handle\nthe availability of social support (Lang, Featherman, &\nNesselroade, 1997). For example, despite plausible expec-\ntations that those in need will receive most support, indi-\nviduals with a strong sense of control are more likely to\nattract sources of support than those who convey a helpless\nIn turn, the Lachman and colleagues (1997) model also\nposits that control beliefs constitute an outcome of resources\nin the health and social domains. In particular, people in\nbetter health may perceive themselves to have the means for\nachieving desired outcomes, whereas aspects of poor health\nsuch as chronic conditions or functional limitations may\ndestabilize feelings of control (Cairney, Corna, Wade, &\nSimilarly, supportive social experiences and exchanges\nhave been proposed to constitute major sources for percep-\ntions of control (see also Antonucci & Jackson, 1987;\nthat may foster a sense of control include encouraging\nmastery attempts, providing supportive performance feed-\nback, and suggesting appropriate coping responses in times\nof strain. However, the empirical evidence in both domains\nis rather inconclusive, primarily because many studies are\nbased on cross-sectional data that preclude inferences re-\ngarding the temporal sequence (for discussion, see Martire,\nStephens, & Townsend, 1998). Longitudinal findings are\nalso mixed, with some studies reporting predictive effects of\nhealth or support for perceived control, whereas other stud-\nies do not (e.g., Krause, 1987; McAvay, Seeman, & Rodin,\npremise in this study is that perceived control serves both\nantecedent and consequent functions for adaptation in the\nhealth and social domains.\nThe nature and correlates of multidirectional across-\ndomain associations\nA key feature of the Lachman's (2006) model and other\ninterdependent nature of across-domain changes. Though\ndirectional inferences cannot be drawn from concurrent\nchanges, highly valuable insights can be gained from exam-\nining if change in one domain in the system is accompanied\nby change in another domain (Seeman & Lewis, 1995). For\nexample, decrements in perceived control might undermine\nthe pursuit of health maintenance behaviors, thereby\nresulting in declining health, which in the long run may\nlead to cascades of further reductions in control beliefs. In\na similar vein, control beliefs are often considered one\nmechanism underlying well-known relations between\nfacets of social support and health (Antonucci, 2001;\nBerkman, Glass, Brisette, & Seeman, 2000; Bisconti &\nBergeman, 1999). We thus expect the size of support-health\nrelations to be reduced when all three domains are consid-\nered simultaneously.\nConceptual and empirical work alike also suggests that\nmultidomain associations may be moderated by third\nHealth problems typically occur more often and are more\nserious in old age relative to young and mid adulthood\n(Aldwin, Spiro, & Park, 2006). Such health decrements in\navailable resources of strength and vitality can be expected\nto undermine and exert limitations on older adults' control\nefforts (Rodin, 1986). In a similar vein, a compromised\nhealth system may be particularly vulnerable to the detri-\nmental effects of lack of control. Both arguments suggest\nstronger control\u00adhealth associations in old age than in\nearlier phases of life. Also, one of the prime reasons why\nperceived control typically shows only minor decrements in\nold age may be because older adults increasingly attempt to\nderive their sense of control from more controllable and at-\ntainable sources, such as one's social network (Heckhausen,\nWrosch, & Schulz, 2010). This also suggests more pro-\nnounced control\u00adsocial associations in old age than in\nearlier phases of life. We will additionally explore if across-\ndomain associations differ by gender and education. Spe-\ncifically, women typically report more health problems\n(Moen, 1996) and are often more active in social net-\nworks (Antonucci & Akiyama, 1987). It thus appears con-\nceivable that these domains are more tightly connected to\nperceived control among women relative to men. Finally,\ncross-sectional reports indicate that perceived control buf-\nfers the negative health effects of low socioeconomic status\n(SES; Lachman & Weaver, 1998). Such across-domain as-\nsociations may thus be stronger for low-SES in contrast to\nhigh-SES groups.\nThe present study\nWe extend and qualify earlier insights into the nature and\nimplications of antecedent\u00adconsequent relations of per-\nceived control to health and social support across adult-\nhood. We go beyond previous reports by examining all\nthree domains conjointly and by targeting across-domain\nrelations in a longitudinal context. To do so, we applied CS\nyears at baseline) to address two sets of questions. First,\nconsidering initial level of perceived control as an anteced-\nent, we determined its predictive role for levels and changes\nin health and social support. Targeting change in perceived\ncontrol as an outcome, we simultaneously examined the\npredictive role of previous levels of health and social\nsupport. Based on our guiding conceptual framework\n(Lachman, 2006), we expected multidirectional associa-\ntions in that perceived control would uniquely predict sub-\nsequent changes in health and support and that initial health\nand support in turn independently would predict changes in\ncontrol. In a second step, we explored if change in one do-\nmain was accompanied by changes in other domains and if\ndifferential across-domain associations emerged in age,\ngender, and education subgroups.\nMethods\nWe used two-wave 9-year data from the national MIDUS\nDetailed descriptions of the study are published in Brim,\nA brief overview is given subsequently.\nParticipants and Procedure\nTo recruit MIDUS participants, a national sample of\nhouseholds in the 48 contiguous states with at least one\ntelephone was selected using random digit dialing. The\ncore sample of 7,120 noninstitutionalized adults was strat-\nified by gender and age with the greatest number between\nmin by telephone (70% response rate) and then received a\nquestionnaire in the mail containing the measures used in\nthis study. An average of nine years (range of 8\u00ad10 years)\nlater, 75% of survivors from the original sample agreed to\nparticipate. We included all participants with valid data on\nthe three target domains (control, health, and support) at\nthe first occasion, resulting in a sample of 6,210 partici-\npants. Of those, 62% provided data for the second wave.\nRelative to the remaining participants, those who contrib-\nmore people with 3 years of college or more, 48% vs. 36%;\nscores (for details, see below), we also found that longitu-\ndinal participants reported at baseline slightly more\nMeasures\nPerceived control was measured using a unit-weighted\ncomposite of four items assessing personal mastery and\neight items assessing perceived constraints (for details, see\nLachman & Firth, 2004). Participants were asked to indi-\ncate the extent to which they agreed with each of the items\n(e.g., \"What happens to me in the future mostly depends on\nme.\"), using a 7-point scale (1 = \"strongly agree\" and 7 =\n\"strongly disagree\"). Mastery items were reverse coded, so\nthat higher scores reflect perceiving more control (a  .85 at\nboth occasions).\nHealth was measured using a composite of chronic health\nconditions, acute conditions, and the number of functional\nlimitations. Chronic conditions were self-reports of the\nnumber of chronic medical conditions from a comprehen-\nsive list of 29 health conditions (e.g., asthma, thyroid\ndisease, migraine headaches, ulcer, hay fever, and stroke)\nparticipants had experienced or been treated for in the past\ntwelve months. For acute conditions, participants rated how\noften they experienced each of nine physical symptoms\nduring the past thirty days (e.g., lower backaches, trouble\ngetting to sleep or staying asleep, and sweating a lot).\nFunctional limitations represent the sum across items ask-\ning whether respondents had experienced any limitations in\ncarrying out eight (instrumental) activities of daily living\n(e.g., bathing; climbing; walking). To compute a compre-\nhensive measure of multiple aspects of health, standardized\nmeans across the three variables were aggregated and\nreverse coded, with higher scores reflecting better health\n(a  .71 at both occasions; for details, see R\u00f6cke & Lachman,\nSocial support was assessed with 24 items, 8 of which\nasked about the social support and social strain (but not de-\npendency) associated with each of three sources, spouse/\npartner, family, and friends. Participants were asked to an-\nswer each item (e.g., \"How much does your partner appre-\nciate you?\", \"How often does your partner criticize you?\")\nusing a 4-point scale (1 = \"a lot\" and 4 = \"not at all\"). Support\nitems were reverse coded, so that higher scores reflect stron-\nger support (a  .85 at both occasions; for details, see Walen\nTo examine whether the strengths of across-domain asso-\nciations differed by sociodemographic strata of age, gender,\nand education, we opted for a statistically thorough, yet\nstraightforward and parsimonious multigroup approach. To\nensure sufficiently large group sizes, we used cutoffs at age\nvs. old age: N = 1,243) and 3 or more years of college (less\nspectively, to contrast groups of different age and education.\nWe note that determining the cutoff points for dividing the\nadult life span into distinct age periods is always somewhat\narbitrary. Because of continuous demographic shifts in\nwork life and general life expectancies in industrialized\ncountries, precise transition ages are difficult to define. In\nour analyses, we follow earlier approaches using age 60\nyears as approximating the end of midlife and the start of\nyoung old age (for discussion, see Lachman & Firth, 2004).\nThe approach also provided the benefit of obtaining two\nsubsamples with reasonably large size. We also carried out\nfollow-up analyses that used different split ups of the groups\n(i.e., ages 55, 65, and 70 years as the cutoff) and found the\nsame substantive pattern of results as reported in the text.\nData Preparation and Statistical Procedure\nTo ensure a common metric across variables, measures\nwere standardized to a T metric (M = 50; SD = 10 at base-\nline). Intercorrelations and descriptive information for our\nmeasures are presented in Table 1. For example, across-\ndomain correlations were sizeable both between baseline\nlevels (e.g., rcontrol.T1 \u00ad health.T1 = .37) and between levels at\nbaseline and nine years later (e.g., rcontrol.T1 \u00ad health.T2 = .30).\nWe also note mean-level changes, which we corroborated\nby separate analyses of variance with two repeated mea-\nsures (T1 and T2). Largely consistent with extant reports\nLiang, & Bennett, 2007), our analyses revealed average\nstability in perceived control (p > .10) as well as average\nnot on these prototypical two-wave changes over a 9-year\nperiod but on examining between-person differences in\nacross-domain associations. We targeted this objective us-\ning a contemporary technique in developmental inquiry,\nCS models (see McArdle, 2009; McArdle & Nesselroade,\nIn CS models, the effect of variable X at T1 (XT1) on vari-\nable X at T2 (XT2) is constrained to a value of 1. As a conse-\nquence, some part of XT2 is exactly identical to XT1, and the\nresidual portion DX is explicitly parameterized and directly\nTable 1.

Highly educated persons had\n3 or more years of college. All correlations significant at p < .001.\ninterpretable as the raw change score. Importantly, this\nchange score is unobserved but as a latent variable directly\nrelated to the observation (Bollen, 2002). We generated a\nchange score independent of initial level by regressing la-\ntent change DX on initial level XT1. To address our research\nquestions, we estimate a conjoint change score model of the\nthree domains and inspect the direction and size of two sets\nof parameters. For the first question, we consider the simul-\ntaneously estimated regression weights that each factor at\nT1 has on the latent changes. These signify the predictive\nand reciprocal associations between control beliefs, health,\nand social support at baseline and two-wave change. For the\nsecond question, the change scores are allowed to correlate\nso as to represent across-domain correlations between con-\ncurrent changes. We also used statistically nested model\ncomparisons and the resulting loss in overall model fit (as\nindexed by the c2 difference per df) to evaluate whether or\nnot the size of a given parameter estimate differs between\nsociodemographic groups. Models were fit to the data using\nformation maximum likelihood estimation algorithms to all\ndata points available, which allowed treating incomplete\ndata as missing at random (Little & Rubin, 1987).\nResults\nAntecedent\u00adConsequent Relations of Perceived Control\nto Health and Social Support\nResults are presented in Figure 1. To begin with baseline\nlevels, there was a positive manifold of considerable size\nbetween perceiving greater control, better initial health,\nand more social support (e.g., scontrol.T1 \u00ad health.T1 = .37;\nshealth.T1 \u00ad social.T1 = .23). Most important for our question is\nthe prediction of two-wave change. Greater perceived con-\ntrol at baseline was predictive of less pronounced declines\nin health (b = .12) and stronger increases in social support\n(b = .10). To illustrate, Figure 2 graphs a scatterplot of\nperceived control and subsequent health changes and shows\nthat participants who reported a strong sense of control at\nbaseline, on average, were more likely to maintain health\nor to decline less.\nIn addition, between-person differences in perceived\ncontrol changes were uniquely predicted by baseline levels\nof both health and support. Specifically, increasing per-\nceived control over time was independently predicted by\nboth better initial health (b = .12) and more initial support\n(b = .09). In contrast, there were no across-domain associa-\ntions between initial levels and subsequent changes in\nhealth and support. Results from the CS model thus provide\nevidence for reciprocal antecedent\u00adconsequent relations of\nperceived control to health and social support. Sense of con-\ntrol was directly and independently predictive of subsequent\nchanges in health and support, and in turn, change in control\nwas predicted by previous levels of health and support. The\nmagnitude of the standardized path coefficients, however,\nwas in the range of small effect sizes.\nThe Nature and Correlates of Multidirectional Across-\nDomain Associations\nOur second objective was to inspect the correlated\nchanges and examine whether the strengths of associations\ndiffered between the sets of domains considered and across\nsociodemographic groups. To begin with the size of corre-\nlated changes reported in Figure 1, one can see positive and\nsizeable associations of between-person differences in rates\nof change across domains. Reports of increasing control\nover time were accompanied by less pronounced declines in\nhealth (r = .17) and stronger increases in support (r = .22).\nTo illustrate, Figure 3 shows a scatterplot of concurrent\nchanges in perceived control and social support, indicating\nthat participants who experienced increased support over\ntime were, on average, more likely to report more perceived\ncontrol as well. Both Figures 2 and 3 highlight the tremen-\ndous amount of between-person heterogeneity. A small and\nsignificant correlation was also found between changes in\nhealth and changes in support (r = .07).\nIn a final step, we examined if and how across-domain\nrelations differed by age, gender, and education. To do so, we\ncompared a baseline model (estimating all parameters freely\nin all age, gender, and education groups) in a hierarchical\nfashion with models that constrained all variances to be equal\nFigure 1.

Means, intercepts, and variances were omitted for clarity. Unlabelled unidirectional paths set to 1.\nacross groups, set all covariances and regressions invariant,\nand estimated all fixed effects to be invariant. Results of\nthese analyses are reported in Table 2.Age comparative anal-\nyses revealed highly significant losses of model fit when we\nfixed the average levels of functioning to be of equal size\nbetween young and middle-aged adults versus older adults (\nRow 5). As one would expect, follow-up analyses indicated\nthat, for example, older adults were on average in poorer\nhealth relative to young and middle-aged adults. Most im-\nportant for our question, setting the size of across-domain\nassociations to be invariant across age groups revealed a\nsmall but statistically reliable difference (Row 4). We note,\nhowever, that the loss in c2 per df was considerably weaker\nthan for setting either means or variances to be age invariant.\nAs it turned out, the magnitude of age differences in across-\ndomain associations was indeed relatively small, amounting\nto less than a 0.1 difference (e.g., bcontrol.T1 \u00ad social.D = .09 vs.\n.07). Our model comparisons by gender (Rows 6 through 10)\nrevealed gender differences in average levels (e.g., poorer\nhealth for women) and variances (e.g., more variability in\nhealth among women) but most importantly, no significant\nloss in model fit when setting across-domain relations invari-\nant across men and women. Analyses of education differ-\nences indicated reliable differences in across-domain\nassociations (Rows 11 through 15), but their absolute size\nwas rather minimal, and no single group difference exceeded\na 0.1 difference (e.g., bcontrol.T1 \u00ad social.D = .06 vs. .11 in the less\nwell and well-educated groups, respectively).\nFigure 2. Illustrating associations between initial levels of perceived control and subsequent 9-year changes in health in the two-wave longitudinal Midlife in\nthe United States survey data. The scatterplot illustrates that participants who reported high levels of perceived control at baseline, on average, were more likely to\nmaintain health or to decline less. The figure also highlights the tremendous amount of between-person heterogeneity. Data presented in T scores (M = 50 and\nIn sum, we found that changes in control beliefs were ac-\ncompanied by concurrent changes in the other two domains,\nand associations involving control were somewhat larger in\nsize than those between health and support.Analyses target-\ning sociodemographic characteristics indicated statisti-\ncally significant differences for age and education, but the\nsize of these differences was relatively small, suggesting\nthat change relationships were relatively consistent across\nsubgroups.\nDiscussion\nOur objective was to examine antecedent\u00adconsequent re-\nlations of perceived control to health and social support\nacross the adult age range. Applying CS models to two-\noccasion data over 9 years of 6,210 MIDUS participants\nrevealed evidence in line with our guiding conceptual\nframework that unique and independent multidirectional re-\nlations exist (Lachman, 2006). Consistent with the view of\nan antecedent role of control beliefs, we found that greater\ninitial perceived control independently predicted weaker\ndeclines in health and stronger increases in social support.\nIn turn, consistent with the view of a consequent role of\ncontrol, our analyses revealed that subsequent increases in\nperceived control were predicted by better initial health and\nmore initial support. Addressing the nature and correlates of\nsuch multidomain associations, we found that changes in\ncontrol were accompanied by concurrent changes in the\nother two domains. The strength of these relations differed\nby age and education, but differences were small in size. We\ntake our results to suggest that perceived control serves as\nboth a precursor and a consequence of health and social\nsupport across adulthood and old age, and we highlight\nroutes for further inquiry to thoroughly address questions\nabout developmental ordering.\nAntecedent\u00adConsequent Relations of Perceived Control to\nHealth and Social Support\nIn line with conceptual and empirical work, the present\nstudy reports sizeable associations and a positive manifold\nacross domains of perceived control, health, and social sup-\nrate and provide empirical evidence for our guiding\nframework (Lachman, 2006), suggesting that perceived\ncontrol serves both antecedent and consequent functions.\nOur findings add to the literature by examining all three do-\nmains conjointly and demonstrating that such relations ex-\ntend beyond the typically reported mean-level associations\nand generalize to longitudinal change.\nTo begin with, our results illustrate that perceived control\nrepresents an important predictor for key indicators of\nadaptation, namely both levels of and long-term changes in\nhealth and social support. Our longitudinal findings extend\nthe time frame over which buffering effects of control be-\nliefs against health declines have been reported from 1.5\nyears in the EPESE (Mendes de Leon, Seeman, Baker,\nSuccessful Aging studies (Seeman et al., 1999) to an average\nof 9 years. Conjointly, these findings are consistent with no-\ntions suggesting that a strong sense of control may help peo-\nple to engage in and maintain health-promoting behaviors\n(e.g., exercise, preventive care; Rodin, 1986). Our results also\nendorse and illustrate theories of control (e.g., Heckhausen &\nSchulz, 1995) according to which control beliefs allow peo-\nple to mobilize social support, particularly in times of strain.\nConsidering perceptions of control as a consequence, one\nimportant finding was that preserved physical health indeed\nconstitutes a unique source for between-person differences\nin control. Individuals in good health were not only more\nlikely to feel in control initially but also to report a gain in\ntheir sense of control over time. It is conceivable that better\nhealth provides more opportunities to experience self-related\nmastery and thus not only helps maintaining but also build-\ning one's sense of personal mastery and control. Similarly\nimportant, we found supportive relationships with one's\nfamily to have long-term beneficial effects for feelings of\ncontrol and an increase therein. These findings offer em-\npirical evidence for theoretical accounts proposing that\nvarious forms of social support represent prime sources for\nfeelings of control across the adult age range (Antonucci &\nJackson, 1987). For example, support may convey the sense\nthat people can count on someone if needed, which likely\nnurtures a sense of efficacy and control. Similarly, observ-\ning a close network member enacting a certain workout reg-\nimen may enhance one's own sense of efficacy to carry out\nand persist with the regimen (Bandura, 1997). It was be-\nyond the scope and possibilities of our study to explore\nthese and other possible mechanisms, so future studies ad-\ndressing such pathways are warranted.\nThe Nature and Correlates of Multidirectional Across-\nDomain Associations\nOur results about the nature and correlates of multido-\nmain relations correspond with notions that control beliefs\nare indeed embedded in a complex and pervasive system of\nreciprocal influences and may play a central role in this\ncontext. Of course, a comprehensive empirical test was not\npossible with two waves of data, but our findings neverthe-\nless provide useful initial insights on which future more\nmechanism-oriented studies may capitalize and elaborate.\nAs a first result, we found that changes in feelings of con-\ntrol were accompanied by functionally meaningful changes\nin the social and health domains. This finding is important\nin and of itself. It illustrates that a positive cross-domain\nFigure 3. Illustrating associations between 9-year changes in perceived control and social support in the two-wave longitudinal Midlife in the United States sur-\nvey data. The scatterplot illustrates that participants who experienced more social support over time were, on average, more likely to report increased perceived\ncontrol as well. The figure also highlights the tremendous amount of between-person heterogeneity. Data presented in T scores (M = 50 and SD = 10).\nmanifold not only exists between levels of functioning but\nalso between age-related changes in those domains. Gener-\nally speaking, our results point to the importance of opting\nfor a dynamic and systemic perspective when attempting to\nbetter understand level and change in perceptions of control\nacross adulthood. One may argue, for example, that a lack\nof or declines in perceived availability of social support\nmay threaten personal belief systems about control (e.g.,\nturn may have negative consequences for well-being and\nhealth (House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988). A major point\nimplicated in our findings is exactly the apparent need for\nmore research addressing such questions about the develop-\nmental ordering and reciprocal dynamics among the various\ndomains involved.\nSecond, our findings can also be taken to indicate the\nsubstantial role the variables included play for determining\nbetween-person differences in the three-variable system un-\nder consideration. At the same time, we found that associa-\ntions involving perceived control were reliably different\nfrom zero, whereas those between health and social support\nwere not. This result needs replication and extension, but\nwe take this pattern to highlight that a sense of control may\nplay a key role in the well-documented relations between\nsocial support and health (for overview, see Berkman et al.,\nrole would be to extend cross-sectional reports (Bisconti &\nBergeman, 1999) and examine if perceived control indeed\nmediates (fully or partially) longitudinal relations among\nsocial support and health. Establishing such effects also has\nmajor implications for the refinement of health prevention\nand intervention programs (e.g., attempting to boost percep-\ntions of control).\nFinally, the strength of across-domain relations was\nfound to differ by age and education, but differences were\nsmall in size. In essence, the general pattern was very simi-\nlar with some associations being slightly more pronounced\nin one group or another. These findings suggest that cross-\ndomain linkages between levels and changes in perceived\ncontrol, health, and support are largely independent of and\npervasive across a broad range of sociodemographic strata.\nFrom an intervention perspective, these are promising find-\nings because they highlight that boosting one variable (e.g.,\ncontrol) may also have enhancing implications for the other\ntwo variables (e.g., health, support), irrespective of the pre-\nceding functional level. In contrast, however, declines in\ncontrol appear to be foreshadowed by losses in health and\nsupport. More work is needed to better understand the pos-\nsible role of mediating events (e.g., disability, widowhood)\nand if and how control beliefs can be guarded against the\neffects of such age-related declines. At the same time, we\nnote several factors in our study that may have contributed\nto the relative lack of differential associations. To start with,\nprevious work on the importance of sociodemographics has\nprimarily been cross-sectional and focused on level,\nwhereas our study was longitudinal in nature and focused\non long-term changes. Similarly, including more process-\noriented variables such as social relations as additional pre-\ndictors in our analyses may have left relatively little variance\nto be explained by more macro sociodemographic charac-\nteristics. We also acknowledge that further in-depth studies\ntargeting potentially important nuances may provide useful\nqualifications to our results. For example, it appears con-\nceivable that control\u00adhealth relations are mediated by\nadopting health-promoting behaviors (Mirowsky & Ross,\n1998) that may reveal larger health-beneficial effects among\nlow-SES groups.\nLimitations and Outlook\nApplying CS models to two-wave data obtained from a\nnational sample across the adult age range provided for a\ndirect operational definition of our research questions and\nrevealed initial insights into reciprocal across-domain asso-\nciations. However, we note several limitations of our study.\nWith only two waves of data (and modeling manifest vari-\nables), CS models are not distinguishable from and reveal\nthe same set of findings as more traditional autoregressive\nmodels, which can produce biased results if the variables\nunder scrutiny are differentially reliable and (or) stable over\nTable 2.

It is thus imperative to replicate and\nextend any directional interpretations with more rigorous\nmethodologies (e.g., dynamic modeling tools; McArdle &\nHamagami, 2001). We note that these methods typically\nrequire data being collected over three or more waves to\nfully remedy the weaknesses inherent in other approaches\n(McArdle & Nesselroade, 1994, see Gerstorf, L\u00f6vd\u00e9n,\nAnother set of limitations revolves around the specific-\nity of our findings. To begin with, we note that the aging\nindividual is not fully described by three variables. Includ-\ning additional factors (e.g., cognitive functioning, well-\nbeing: Lachman, 2006) may thus help to better understand\nhow across-domain associations observed in this study are\nembedded in other complex systems of influence. In addi-\ntion, our social support measure assessed aspects of sup-\nport rather than dependency (e.g., emotional or financial)\nand also did not distinguish if the support received was\nindeed asked for and appreciated. This aspect is important\ngiven previous reports that receiving more help than\nwanted or needed may result in reduced feelings of control\nWe tapped this concern by replicating our pattern of find-\nings when we used a an inverse of social strain (Follow-up\nanalyses using various alternative indicators of our mea-\nsures yielded substantively the same pattern of results as\nreported in the text. Specifically, we have targeted (a) sepa-\nrate measures for social support and social strain rather\nthan a combined variable as the social support indicator as\nwell as separate measures for the three sources of support\nand strain (spouse/partner, family, and friends), (b) sepa-\nrate measures of acute health conditions, chronic health\nconditions, and number of functional limitations rather\nthan the unit-weighted composite across the three vari-\nables, and (c) income rather than education as the socio-\neconomic indicator. We additionally carried out follow-up\nanalyses (d) including linear interaction variables of the\nthree T1 indicators with either age or education in the pre-\ndiction of two-wave 9-year changes.), but a more detailed\nexamination of this possibility is warranted. Also, it would\nbe instructive to explore the extent to which between-person\nassociations revealed by two-wave data over 9 years are\nsimilar to within-person associations revealed by data\ncollected over many more, relatively closely spaced occa-\nsions (e.g., R\u00f6cke, Li, & Smith, 2009). It is also an open\nquestion whether or not the associations observed general-\nize to an age-based time metric, can be found over much\nshorter time frames, such as weeks or months, and if do-\nmain-specific control (e.g., feeling capable of eliciting de-\nsirable social or health outcomes) would have generated\nstronger effects in the respective domain (see Lang et al.,\n1997). A similarly promising route for future inquiry is\nwhether across-domain dynamics different from those\nfound in this primarily midlife and old age sample may\nemerge very late in life when individuals often approach\ncritically low levels of health (see Gerstorf, Ram, R\u00f6cke,\nOur study represents an initial effort to conjointly exam-\nine antecedent\u00adconsequent relations between level and lon-\ngitudinal change across perceived control, health, and social\nsupport. We have shown that perceived control facilitates\nadaptive functioning and helps to sustain and enrich one's\nmultidomain resources. At the same time, physical and\ninterpersonal resources such as good health and social\nsupport are linked to the availability as well as gains in psy-\nchological resources, such as perceived control. Our study\nthus provides further impetus to thoroughly examine pro-\ncesses involved in antecedent\u00adconsequent relations of con-\ntrol beliefs to health and social support.\nFunding\nThis research was supported by a grant from National Institute on\ninvestigation.\n"
