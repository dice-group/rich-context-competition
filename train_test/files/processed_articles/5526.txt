Historically,\nthese two traditions have employed distinct but complemen-\ntary theoretical models to understand the antecedents of SWB\nand physiological functioning. Occupational stress models\n(e.g. the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model; Demerouti\net al., 2001) have historically emphasized the disease model\nof health, highlighting the effects of negative job conditions\non strain and impaired physical and psychological health, and\npositive psychology models (e.g. the Broaden-and-Build the-\nory of positive emotions; Fredrickson, 2001) have focused on\nthe health-enhancing role of positive emotions and positive\nresources such as social support and resilience. As such, the\ncombination of these two traditions can generate complemen-\ntary insights on the linkage between SWB and physiological\nhealth outcomes.

Growing concern about employee health has energized\na search for modifiable antecedents of the proximal pro-\ncesses (i.e. physiological functioning) influencing employee\nhealth. Highlighting the need for research on employee\nhealth, the Center for Disease Control recently reported that\n\"productivity losses related to personal and family health\nproblems cost U.S. employers $1,685 per employee per year,\nbillion annually\" (Stewart et al., 2003). These\nlosses manifest in a variety of forms, including absenteeism,\nreduced performance, turnover-related training costs, disa-\nbility losses, and high health insurance costs (Goetzel et al.,\ntremendous social and financial burdens on society as a\nwhole. As a result, large-scale programs such as the Total\nWorker Health initiative have emerged, focusing on integra-\ntive approaches to improve employee health (National\nInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health, 2013).\nSimultaneously, evidence has accumulated to show that\nSWB--an important predictor of health--is modifiable\n(Tay and Kuykendall, 2013) and, as such, is an ideal target\nfor worker health interventions. However, in order to maxi-\nmize the benefit of worker health interventions targeting\nSWB as a key antecedent, it is necessary to have an integra-\ntive understanding of the link between SWB and the proxi-\nmal antecedent of health (i.e. physiological functioning) that\ndraws upon and unifies complementary perspectives from\nthe positive psychology and occupational stress traditions.\nIn this article, we establish the conceptual link between\nworker SWB and physiological health outcomes, focusing\nspecifically on the context of work. We provide a parsimo-\nnious and integrative model of the link between SWB and\nphysiological health outcomes, proposing that the linkages\nbetween SWB and physiological health stem not only from\nthe direct influence of SWB but also from common effects\nof work stressors and personal resources. Our model\nimplies that, by focusing on common causes, interventions\ncan be designed to simultaneously enhance SWB and phys-\niological health.\nAn approach allowing for the simultaneous improve-\nment of employee SWB and health would be invaluable, as\nSWB and physiological functioning are critically important\nto both workers and organizations. Worker SWB is associ-\nated with a wide range of work outcomes including job per-\nformance (Riketta, 2008), turnover decisions (Hom et al.,\n1979), organizational citizenship behaviors (Bateman and\ncoworkers and supervisors (Hershcovis et al., 2007).\nFurthermore, employee ill-health, as proximally caused by\npoor physiological outcomes, results in increased medical\ncosts for organizations (Goetzel et al., 2003) and decreased\nOur article is structured as follows. First, we define SWB\nand physiological functioning. Second, we provide a brief\nbackground on the perspectives we draw upon to build our\ntheoretical model--the positive psychology perspective and\nthe occupational stress perspective. We then provide our\nintegrative framework as shown in Figure 1 and discuss each\nof the mechanisms that link SWB and physiological health.\nFigure 1. Framework for subjective well-being and physiological functioning in the work context.\nKuykendall and Tay 3\nFinally, we conclude with implications of our model for\ninterventions simultaneously targeting worker SWB and\nhealth. Our article contributes to the literature on worker\nwell-being and health by proposing an integrative model that\nassimilates both the positive psychology and occupational\nstress traditions to explain the linkage between worker SWB\nand physiological functioning.\nSWB and physiological functioning\nSWB\nOur conceptualization of worker SWB follows the model\ncommonly used in well-being studies and positive psychol-\nogy, which consists of both evaluative and affective com-\nmeasure worker SWB reflect the model used in the broader\npsychological sciences. In the organizational sciences,\nmeasures of job satisfaction are typically understood to\ncapture primarily the cognitive aspects of SWB, whereas\nmeasures of job affect primarily capture the affective\naspects of SWB (Kaplan et al., 2009). Multi-dimensional\nmeasures of job satisfaction include dimensions such as\nsatisfaction with work, supervisor, colleagues, pay, com-\nmunication, and promotion (Job Descriptive Index (JDI);\nSmith et al., 1969). Indices of affective well-being at work\ninclude measures of frequent positive emotions and infre-\nquent negative emotions in the work context. Popular\nmeasures include the Positive and Negative Affective\nSchedule (PANAS; Watson et al., 1988) and the Job-related\nAffective Well-Being Scale (Van Katwyk et al., 2000).\nEvidence that measures of job affect and job satisfaction\nare related but distinct comes from recent meta-analytic\nfindings showing moderate correlations between measures\nof worker affect and job satisfaction, ranging from an\nConsistent with theory and empirical findings, our\nmodel posits that cognitive and affective components of\nSWB are distinct but tightly connected because of the bi-\ndirectional relationship between the two (see Figure 1,\nLinks 1 and 2). Compelling evidence for the influence of\nevaluations on feelings comes from the cognitive behav-\nioral tradition, which holds that cognitive reactions to or\ninterpretations of events drive affective reactions and sub-\nsequent behaviors. By learning to change default interpre-\ntations or evaluations of events, individuals are able to\nreduce undesired emotions and behaviors. The docu-\nmented effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy in\nmodifying a range of undesirable emotions (e.g. anger;\nBeck and Fernandez, 1998; anxiety; Hofmann and Smits,\n2008) provides support for positing a causal path from\ncognitive SWB (i.e. job satisfaction) to affective SWB\n(i.e. feelings).\nAdditionally, a strong body of evidence also supports\nthe assertion that feelings guide evaluations. For instance,\npeople tend to evaluate their life satisfaction as being higher\nwhen they are in happier moods than when they are in sad\nmoods (Schwarz and Clore, 1983). Such findings are con-\nsistent with the affect-as-information hypothesis (Clore,\n2001), which posits that affective cues such as mood and\nemotions influence judgments, \"serving as experiential and\nbodily information regarding how one feels about the object\nof judgment\" (Clore and Huntsinger, 2007). At a more\nbasic level, affect can also direct attentional focus to emo-\ntionally congruent cues and information, thereby generat-\ning cognitive consistency with affect (Dalgleish and Watts,\nBased on the evidence supporting the cognitive behavio-\nral perspective and the affect-as-information hypothesis,\nour model posits that job feelings influence job evaluations\n(Figure 1, Link 1) and that job evaluations influence job\nfeelings (Figure 1, Link 2).\nPhysiological functioning\nPhysiological functioning is commonly assessed as three\ndistinct but closely interrelated components: the cardiovas-\ncular system, which serves to circulate the blood through\nthe body; the immune system, which protects the body\nfrom disease caused by pathogens; and the endocrine sys-\ntem, which regulates the function of cells and organs in the\nbody. These aspects of physiological functioning have been\nidentified as likely biological mechanisms linking psycho-\nsocial factors to physical health (Miller et al., 2009) and\nhave been implicated in the development and progression\nof common chronic diseases (Antoni and Lutgendorf, 2007;\nRozanski et al., 1999). As such, impairments to physiologi-\ncal functioning are an easily detectable sign of underlying\nprocesses that lead to many of the most costly health end-\npoints such as hypertension, heart disease, acute myocar-\ndial infarction, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nPoorer cardiovascular functioning is usually indexed by\nhigher levels of blood pressure, heart rate, and pulse rate\nEndocrine functioning is indexed by different hormones\nsuch as catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopa-\nmine), cortisol, and prolactin. Higher levels of such hor-\nmones are often diagnostic of poorer health. Immune\nfunctioning is indexed by circulating concentrations of\nimmune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells, B cells, and\nT cells; by the functional capacities of those cells; and by\nproteins produced by immune cells known as cytokines.\nGenerally, greater numbers of immune cells are related to\nbetter immune response and more robust protection against\ndiseases (Herbert and Cohen, 1993). High levels of anti-\ninflammatory cytokines and low levels of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines can also indicate better immune function (Herbert\nand Cohen, 1993). Given these specific physiological indi-\ncators, if SWB at work is related to better physiological\n4 Health Psychology Open \nfunctioning, we would generally expect that SWB would be\nnegatively related to cardiovascular and endocrine indica-\ntors, but positively related to most immune indicators.\nComplementary perspectives of\noccupational stress and positive\npsychology\nWith these definitions of SWB in physiological functioning\nin place, we now provide a brief overview of the two tradi-\ntions our theoretical model integrates--the occupational\nstress tradition and the positive psychology tradition.\nOccupational stress tradition\nResearch in the occupational stress tradition focuses on the\neffects of negative work conditions on impaired physical\nand psychological health. Examples of negative work con-\nditions include--but are not limited to--hazardous physi-\ncal working environments (e.g. exposure to toxins, extreme\ntemperatures), non-optimal workload (i.e. too much or too\ndifficult work), and negative aspects of the social context\n(e.g. bullying, sexual harassment, workplace conflict). A\nkey goal of research in the occupational stress tradition is to\nidentify important negative work conditions and to advance\ntheory explaining how and when these conditions harm\nworker health and well-being with the goal of developing\nand promoting interventions that protect workers against\nthese negative conditions. Some of the most prominent\ntheories in this tradition include the Demand-Control\nModel (Karasek, 1979), the person-environment fit model\n(French et al., 1982), the Transactional Model of Stress\n(Lazarus, 1999), and the Job-Demands Resources Model\nPositive psychology tradition\nIn contrast, while research in the occupational stress tradition\nfocuses on identifying negative work conditions and under-\nstanding their effects and how to alleviate their effects,\nresearch in the positive psychology tradition focuses on iden-\ntifying positive emotions and resources that promote and\nprotect health and well-being and understanding how to cul-\ntivate these emotions and resources in workers. Research in\nthe positive psychology tradition is relatively new compared\nto research in the occupational stress tradition, and fewer\ntheoretical frameworks have developed. Currently, a leading\ntheoretical framework relevant to the current topic is the\nBroaden-and-Buildtheoryofpositiveemotions(Fredrickson,\n2001), which delineates health-enhancing benefits of posi-\ntive emotions and positive resources such as social support\nand resilience. Because research in the occupational stress\ntradition and the positive psychology tradition both provide\nimportant findings relevant to the link between SWB and\nphysiological functioning, yet do so through the distinct\napproaches of protecting workers from negative work condi-\ntions (in the case of occupational stress) and promoting posi-\ntive emotions and resources (in the case of positive\npsychology), they represent complementary perspectives,\nwhich can be integrated to form a more holistic understand-\ning of the relationship between SWB and physiological\nfunctioning.\nAn integrative framework\nWe propose an integrative framework that links worker\nSWB and physiological health as shown in Figure 1. In our\nmodel, we explain the relationship between worker SWB\nand physiological functioning as a result of the protecting\nand promoting influence of SWB on physiological func-\ntioning and also as a result of the common influences of\nstress and personal resources. Consistent with the positive\npsychological perspective, our model emphasizes that\nSWB promotes physiological functioning by directly\nenhancing physiological functioning. Consistent with occu-\npational stress perspectives, our model highlights the role\nof work stress as a negative influence on both SWB and\nphysiological functioning. Finally, consistent with both\npositive psychology perspectives and occupational stress\nperspectives, our model also highlights the importance of\npersonal resources such as hope, resilience, optimism, and\nself-efficacy in protecting workers against the effects of\nwork stress on SWB and physiological functioning. As\nsuch, SWB is linked to physiological health because of its\ncausal influence on physiological functioning, but also\nbecause of the common influences of work stress and per-\nsonal resources on both SWB and physiological function-\ning. We elaborate on these concepts and their linkages in\nthe following.\nSWB influences physiological functioning\nInfluence of positive emotions. Exemplifying the positive psy-\nchology tradition, the Broaden-and-Build theory of positive\nemotions explains that positive emotions promote health\nand well-being by broadening one's awareness and encour-\naging novel thoughts and actions, which eventually builds\nenduring social, intellectual, and emotional resources (Fre-\nopposite effects on awareness than negative emotions,\nwhich are known to narrow rather than broaden awareness,\nthey serve as an antidote to the cardiovascular effects of\nnegative emotions. Negative emotions are known to increase\ncardiovascular reactivity, which, if experienced frequently,\ncan lead to heart disease and cardiac events (Kubzansky and\nKawachi, 2000). An important determinant of whether fre-\nquent cardiovascular reactivity becomes harmful is how\nquickly individuals return to baseline levels of cardiovascu-\nlar functioning after events that increase reactivity. Research\nhas shown that individuals experiencing positive emotions\nKuykendall and Tay 5\nhave a speedier recovery from the cardiovascular effects of\nnegative emotions than individuals who do not experience\npositive emotions (Fredrickson and Levenson, 1998). This\nbenefit of positive emotions is referred to in the Broaden-\nand-Build framework as the undoing hypothesis. The key\npoint of the undoing hypothesis is that positive emotions\nprotect physiological health by undoing the effects of nega-\ntive emotions.\nThe positive psychological tradition has also shown\nthat, in addition to protecting physiological health against\nthe effects of negative emotions, positive emotions also\nappear to directly promote physiological health. Positive\nemotions, particularly deactivated positive emotions such\nas feelings of calmness and relaxation, decrease heart rate,\nblood pressure, cortisol levels, and inflammation (Pressman\nand Cohen, 2005). These relationships are independent of\nnegative emotions and depressed mood, indicating that\npositive emotions have effects on physiological health over\nand above the effects of negative emotions (Steptoe et al.,\n2009). While few studies have looked specifically at the\nlink between job affect and physiological functioning,\nthose that have supported the link between deactivated pos-\nitive emotions and improved physiological functioning\nFurthermore, positive affect also promotes and protects\nphysiological functioning by increasing the likelihood of\nindividuals engaging in behaviors that improve physiologi-\ncal functioning and decreasing the likelihood of engaging\nin behaviors that harm physiological functioning. For\ninstance, happy people--and by implication happy work-\ners--are more likely to exercise (Lox et al., 1999; Mishra,\nWatson et al., 1992) and are less likely to engage in\nsmoking, unhealthy eating, and drug and alcohol abuse\naffect may influence physiological function through health\nbehaviors.\nInfluence of job satisfaction. In contrast to positive and nega-\ntive feelings, job satisfaction is presented in our model as\nhaving a more distal influence on physiological function-\ning. Because satisfaction evaluations are not thought to\nactivate the same physiological processes as emotions, sim-\nply being satisfied or dissatisfied with one's job is not, by\nitself, likely to promote or protect health. However, because\nof the proposed bi-directional relationship between job sat-\nisfaction and job affect, we do expect a link between job\nsatisfaction and physiological functioning. As shown in the\nmodel, evaluations of one's job likely influence feelings in\nthe workplace and, as such, have a distal influence on phys-\niological functioning via positive and negative feelings.\nThe direct influence of SWB on physiological functioning,\ndriven by the effects of positive emotions, negative emo-\ntions, and the distal influence of job satisfaction, is shown\nby Link 3 in Figure 1.\nWork stress impairs SWB and physiological\nfunctioning\nWhile positive psychology focuses on positive emotions\nand resources, the rich tradition stemming from the \"dis-\nease\" model of health emphasizes the negative effects of\nstress on workers and the features that mitigate such effects.\nThe occupational stress perspective has conventionally\nfocused on stress as an effect of negative work characteris-\ntics. In this tradition, the JD-R model (Demerouti et al.,\n2001)--an adaptation of the Demand-Control Model\n(Karasek, 1979)--asserts that individuals will experience\nstress from their work when it makes high mental, physical,\nemotional, and other demands while affording few job\nresources such as support, autonomy, and feedback, subse-\nquently leading to poor SWB (i.e. negative feelings of\nfatigue and exhaustion) and health problems.\nThis process is depicted in our model as job conditions\ninducing work stress (Link 4) and work stress influencing\nboth SWB (Link 5) and physiological functioning (Link 6).\nWe conceptualize job conditions as objective or perceived\ncharacteristics of the job or work environment that may\ngenerate demands or afford resources and stress as a psy-\nchological reaction to demanding conditions. We adopt\ndefinitions of job demands and job resources from the JD-R\nmodel, defining job demands as \"those physical, social, or\norganizational aspects of the job that require sustained\nphysical or mental effort and are therefore associated with\ncertain physiological and psychological costs\" and job\nresources as\nthose physical, social, or organizational aspects of the job that\nmay do any of the following: (a) be functional in achieving\nwork goals; (b) reduce job demands and the associated\nphysiological and psychological costs; (c) stimulate personal\nCommon examples of job demands include interper-\nsonal conflict, emotional labor, work overload, job ambigu-\nity, and unsafe work environments. In contrast, common\nexamples of job resources include feedback, job control,\nand social support.\nWork stress and SWB. The relationship between stress and\nSWB has garnered strong evidence. A recent meta-analysis\nfound the unadjusted correlation between stress, measured\nas anxiety and strain, and job satisfaction to be -.32 (Far-\nagher et al., 2005). Numerous studies examining various\nwork contexts have shown that specific job characteristics\nare stressful, leading to lower job satisfaction (Bogg and\n2012). Research has also found that stressful work charac-\nteristics are related to negative job evaluations and feelings,\nincluding job dissatisfaction and emotional exhaustion\n(Dollard and Winefield, 1998). Experience sampling\nresearch using worker samples has demonstrated that\n6 Health Psychology Open \nstressful events are related to experiences of greater nega-\nZohar, 1999). The stress\u00adSWB link appears to be pan-cul-\ntural as a representative sample across the world found that\nthe experience of stress predicts lower SWB (Ng et al.,\nWork stress and physiological functioning.Work stress not\nonly affects SWB but also influences physiological func-\ntioning. Much of the research in the occupational stress tra-\ndition has emphasized the link between job conditions and\nphysiological functioning--with work stress being the pos-\nited, but often not explicitly measured, link between these\nconditions and physiological outcomes. Research has\nshown that job conditions such as high job demands and\nlow job control influence physiological outcomes such as\ncortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure (Gallo et al., 2004;\nKunz-Ebrecht et al., 2004). Despite the relatively low num-\nber of studies documenting the link between work stress\nand measures of worker physiological functioning (e.g.\nAlmadi et al., 2012), compelling evidence for the influence\nof stress on SWB has been shown by employee stress man-\nagement interventions. A meta-analysis on the effective-\nness of employee stress management interventions revealed\nthat such interventions enhance physiological functioning\neffects of work stress on the disease endpoints proximally\ninfluenced by physiological functioning, and the biological\nprocesses by which poor physiological functioning leads to\ndiseases, have been clearly documented (Miller et al.,\nPersonal resources enhance SWB and\nphysiological functioning\nIn our model, we propose that personal resources also pro-\nvide an important link between SWB and physiological\nhealth. The accumulation of personal resources can enhance\nSWB and physiological health. To avoid confusion with job\nconditions, our model focuses solely on personal resources,\n\"the psychological characteristics or aspects of the self that\nare generally associated with resiliency and that refer to the\nability to control and impact one's environment success-\nfully\" (Schaufeli and Taris, 2014: 49), such as self-efficacy,\nself-esteem, optimism, hope, and resilience.\nPersonal resources and SWB. Personal resources have been\na focus of both positive psychological perspectives and\noccupational stress perspectives. Positive psychological\nperspectives illuminate how SWB can enhance personal\nresources, which in turn lead to higher SWB. One of the\nfundamental tenets of the Broaden-and-Build theory (Fre-\nattention and influence thought-action repertoires--the\nrange of potential actions the body and mind are prepared\nto engage in--such that individuals are more likely to\nengage in novel and exploratory behaviors such as meeting\nnew people or playing a new game. In this respect, positive\nemotions stand in contrast to negative emotions, which\ntend to be associated with very narrow action tendencies\nsuch as fleeing as a response to experiencing fear.\nAlthough novel and exploratory behavior is not immedi-\nately critical to safety or survival, as are the immediate ben-\nefits of specific fight-or-flight action tendencies associated\nwith negative emotions, such novel and exploratory behav-\niors generated by positive emotions serve to build impor-\ntant personal resources over time. The Broaden-and-Build\ntheory posits \"positive spirals\" or feedback loops between\nSWB and personal resources such that SWB facilitates per-\nsonal resources via novel and exploratory behaviors and, in\nturn, personal resources enhance SWB. The bi-directional\nnature of the relationship between personal resources and\nSWB leads to a self-perpetuating system that underpins\nboth the development of lasting personal resources and\nlong-lasting SWB changes (see review by Garland et al.,\n2010). Applying this concept to workers, an experimental\nintervention that manipulated worker positive emotions via\nloving kindness meditations influenced a wide range of\npersonal resources, which subsequently increased life satis-\nfaction, providing support for the bi-directional relation-\nship between SWB and personal resources (Fredrickson\nContextualizing the concept of positive resources to the\nwork context, researchers have developed a taxonomy of\njob-related positive personal resources, including hope,\nresilience, optimism, and self-efficacy (Luthans et al.,\nstudies have shown evidence for a bi-directional relation-\nship between job-related personal resources and worker\nSWB. For instance, job-related positive emotions predicted\njob-related personal resources (e.g. hope, optimism, and\nself-efficacy in the work context) 6months later (Ouweneel\net al., 2012), and psychological capital--a combination of\nhope, optimism, efficacy, and resiliency--predicted psy-\nchological well-being, which includes an affective compo-\nnent, 3weeks later, controlling for psychological well-being\nreflect this bi-directional relationship between personal\nresources and SWB.\nThe link between SWB and personal resources has also\nbeen incorporated into the occupational stress tradition, as\nthe JD-R model has been expanded to include personal\nresources (Xanthopoulou et al., 2007). Specifically, the\nJD-R model (Demerouti et al., 2001) emphasizes that while\nnegative job characteristics (e.g. job demands) cause stress\nand harm health and well-being, positive job characteristics\n(e.g. job resources) increase personal resources and subse-\nquently enhance employee well-being. In the JD-R model,\npersonal resources function as a mechanism by which job\nresources influence SWB. Specifically, researchers have\nKuykendall and Tay 7\nposited that job resources activate employees' personal\nresources, allowing them to feel capable, perform confi-\ndently, be satisfied and happy with their work, and experi-\nence fewer negative feelings such as exhaustion (Luthans\nfound initial support that personal resources (i.e. self-effi-\ncacy, organizational-based self-esteem, and optimism)\nmediate the relationship between job resources (i.e. auton-\nomy, social support, supervisory coaching, and opportuni-\nties for professional development) and feelings of exhaustion\nFurthermore, researchers have suggested that personal\nresources can reduce perceptions of poor job conditions,\nwhich subsequently reduces stress. Such reasoning is con-\nsistent with interactional models of stress, which assert that\nresources such as optimism can influence both the percep-\ntion of and the response to one's environment. Some stud-\nies provide support for this reciprocal relationship (Kohn\ninstance, in a sample of Dutch employees, personal\nresources (i.e. optimism, self-efficacy, and organizational-\nbased self-esteem) predicted the perception of job resources\n(e.g. autonomy, social support, supervisory coaching, and\nprofessional development) (Xanthopoulou et al., 2007).\nLinks 9 and 10 in our model capture the bi-directional rela-\ntionship between job resources and personal resources.\nFurthermore, the path from job conditions to SWB via\nLinks 9 and 7 reflect personal resources as a mediator of\nthe relationship between job conditions and SWB.\nPersonal resources and physiological functioning.Personal\nresources likely mitigate the influence of work stress on\ncardiovascular, immune, and neuroendocrine functioning\n(Link 11). Research in the positive psychological tradition\nhas shown that individuals who possess the personal\nresources such as optimism and hope tend to engage in\nmore effective stress coping strategies (Fontaine et al.,\nresult, tend to experience quicker alleviation from stress\nand its associated effects on cardiovascular, immune, and\nneuroendocrine functioning.\nSuch reasoning is consistent with findings showing a\nlink between personal resources and health outcomes. In\nfact, studies have shown that optimism is robustly associ-\nated with protection against poor cardiovascular function-\ning, as indicated by optimistic individuals showing a slower\nrate of carotid atherosclerosis progression and a reduced\nrisk of developing hypertension than less optimistic indi-\nviduals (Boehm and Kubzansky, 2012; Matthews et al.,\nwith low inflammation--an indicator of good physiologi-\ncal functioning (Ikeda et al., 2011). Finally, a recent meta-\nanalysis found that optimism predicts immune functioning\n(r=.21) and physiological functioning (r=.17) in prospec-\nJob conditions\nFinally, we argue that job conditions--objective or per-\nceived characteristics of the job or work environment that\nmay generate demands or afford resources--have a direct\ninfluence on SWB, and subsequently on physiological func-\ntioning, that is not mediated by work stress or positive\nresources. A central tenet of the JD-R model is that negative\njob conditions (i.e. job demands) cause stress (Link 4),\nwhich subsequently harms well-being and health (Links 5\nand 6), whereas positive job conditions (i.e. job resources)\ngenerate personal resources (Link 9), which enhances well-\nbeing and protects health (Links 7 and 11). These two pre-\ndictions have garnered strong support (Schaufeli and Taris,\n2014). Negative job conditions, specifically job demands,\nevoke negative employee reactions, particularly in the form\nof job dissatisfaction and negative feelings, whereas posi-\ntive job resources lead to positive reactions, including job\nsatisfaction and positive feelings. For instance, workers who\nreported job demands in the form of high safety risk percep-\ntions were less satisfied with their jobs than workers who\ndid not report high safety risks. In contrast, workers who\nreported positive job resources in the form of a positive\nsafety climate had higher levels of job satisfaction than\nworkers who did not report a positive safety climate (Nielsen\nWe propose that, in addition to job conditions influenc-\ning SWB via work stress and personal resources, job condi-\ntions can also directly influence SWB because of their\neffects on feelings other than stress. Feelings of stress and\nanxiety are characterized by high activation and negative\nvalence (Russell, 1980). While such feelings are a common\nresponse to negative job characteristics, they are likely not\nthe only affective response evoked by negative job charac-\nteristics and work events (Weiss and Cropanzano, 1996).\nFor instance, interpersonal conflict at work or role overload\nmay cause individuals to feel sad or disappointed, in addi-\ntion to feeling stressed. Such low-activation negative emo-\ntions reflect a possible linkage between job conditions and\nSWB that is not mediated by stress. Link 12 in Figure 1\nshows the direct influence of job conditions on SWB that is\nprompted by job conditions that evoke low-activation nega-\ntive emotions.\nDiscussion\nTheoretical contributions\nOur perspective is the first to integrate occupational stress\nand positive psychological perspectives on the relationship\nbetween SWB and physiological health. This integration is\ncrucial because examining the relationship from only one\nof these perspectives omits important causal paths and\npotential confounding factors. For instance, the occupa-\ntional stress perspective focuses on the effects of work con-\nditions and the personal and organizational factors that\n8 Health Psychology Open \nmitigate the effects of those job conditions on both SWB\nand health. However, by omitting the direct influence of\nSWB on physiological functioning, the effects of factors\nsuch as job conditions and work stress may be overesti-\nmated. In contrast, by focusing primarily on the mecha-\nnisms linking positive emotions and health, the positive\npsychological perspective is limited because of a lack of\nconsideration of the broader factors confounding the rela-\ntionship between SWB and physiological functioning such\nas job conditions and work stress. Our model provides a\nframework for incorporating the important perspectives of\neach approach such that no key confounding factors are\nomitted.\nBy showing that the relationship between SWB and\nphysiological functioning is partially driven by common\ninfluences of work stress, personal resources, and job con-\nditions, our integrative model provides the foundation for\ninterventions that simultaneously enhance both SWB and\nphysiological functioning by targeting their common ante-\ncedents rather than focusing solely on the antecedents\nemphasized either by the occupational stress perspective or\nthe positive psychological perspective.\nImplications for research\nOur integrative model implies that, by targeting both work\nstress and personal resources, researchers can simultane-\nously enhance SWB and physiological functioning. A great\ndeal of research has identified effective interventions to\nimprove job conditions (National Institute for Occupational\nSafety and Health, 2013) and reduce work stress\n(Richardson and Rothstein, 2008). Fewer studies have\nexamined interventions to enhance worker personal\nalthough some initial evidence shows that psychological\ncapital--a combination of hope, optimism, efficacy, and\nresiliency--can be developed in employees using short\n\"micro-interventions\" (Luthans et al., 2006). However, no\nstudies have examined interventions simultaneously target-\ning personal resources, work stress, and job conditions.\nFuture research is needed to determine how to best com-\nbine interventions targeting all three of these identified\ncommon influences. Two key issues that need to be\naddressed when designing integrative interventions are the\nlevel of the intervention (organizational or individual) and\nthe degree of \"match\" between job conditions, stress, and\npersonal resources.\nLevel of intervention. Concerning the level of intervention,\ninterventions targeting stress and personal resources can\nhave individual- or organization-level targets. For instance,\nwork stress interventions focused on the individual often\ntarget coping styles, meditation, and progressive muscle\nrelaxation, whereas interventions focused on the organiza-\ntion often target job conditions that commonly evoke stress\nsuch as ambiguity, interpersonal conflict, safety problems,\nand high job demands. Similarly, personal resource inter-\nventions focused on the individual often target self-effi-\ncacy, whereas interventions focused on the organization\ntarget developing positive job resources such as supportive\nwork environments.\nWhile individual-level variables (e.g. stress and\nresources) are more proximal to SWB and physiological\nfunctioning than organization-level variables (e.g. job con-\nditions), choosing an individual-directed intervention,\nrather than an organization-directed intervention, to reduce\nnegative work experiences such as stress can send a mes-\nsage to employees that they, rather than the organization,\nare culpable for their negative experiences. Because of this\nrisk, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and\nHealth (2013) has emphasized the importance of\napproaches that seek to simultaneously address organiza-\ntion-level and individual-level causes of negative experi-\nences. Furthermore, the National Institute for Occupational\nSafety and Health (2013) has provided compelling evi-\ndence that workers are most likely to benefit from indi-\nvidual health-promotion interventions when the relevant\norganization-level features are simultaneously addressed.\nAs such, interventions targeting work stress need to ensure\nthat any individual-directed solutions are complemented\nby organization-directed solutions.\nWhether the same principle applies to personal resources\nis a topic for further research. Whereas a number of inter-\nventions have targeted job resources, fewer studies have\ntargeted individual-level personal resources. Further\nresearch is needed on effective individual-directed personal\nresource interventions, particularly whether interventions\nare most effective when both job resources and personal\nresources are targeted.\nIn summary, we suggest that researchers can enhance\nSWB and physiological functioning by designing interven-\ntions that simultaneously improve job conditions, enhance\npersonal resources, and reduce work stress. However, in\ndoing so, careful attention needs to be given to whether the\ninterventions target the individual or the organization.\nWhen addressing negative individual features such as\nstress, it is important that employees are not implicitly\nblamed for their experiences. Researchers can ensure this\nby including both individual-level and organization-level\ninterventions.\nTriple-matching. In addition to the level of the intervention\ntargets, it is also important to consider the \"match\" across\nspecific types of job conditions, stressors, and personal\nresources. The triple-match principle (De Jonge and Dor-\nmann, 2006) posits that resources are most likely to miti-\ngate the effects of stress when stressors (conceptualized as\nsimilar to our definition of job conditions), strains (concep-\ntualized as similar to our definition of stress), and resources\nare of the same type (i.e. emotional, cognitive, or physical).\nKuykendall and Tay 9\nInitial research appears to support the matching principle,\nparticularly for emotional and physical stressors (De Jonge\nand Dormann, 2006). Because personal resources, as con-\nceptualized in our article, are largely emotional, personal\nresource interventions may be most effective when used in\ncontexts involving emotional stressors (e.g. emotional\nlabor). As such, future research should examine whether\nthe type of stressor is a boundary condition on our integra-\ntive model or whether personal resources can buffer the\neffects of stress on the SWB and health of workers even\nwhen the stress is primarily cognitive or physical in nature.\nConclusion\nBoth employee SWB and health are of great importance to\nworkers and organizations. Because employee SWB and\nphysiological outcomes share common antecedents, inter-\nventions targeting these common antecedents are expected\nto result in enhanced SWB and physiological outcomes. By\nfocusing employee interventions on the common anteced-\nents of stress and resources, organizations can enhance and\nprotect both SWB and health.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency\nin the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\nAlmadi T, Cathers I, Hamdan Mansour AM, et al.
