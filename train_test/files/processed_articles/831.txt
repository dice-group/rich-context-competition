The goal of the analysis was to examine the association between health status and work behavior among men\naged 55-69. We specifically examined the conditions under which health is most strongly associated with labor force exit\nand reentry.\nMethods. The association between health and labor force transitions was examined using logistic regression analyses, based\non data from the 1984 and 1985 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation.\nResults. We found that for men aged 55-69 in the mid-1980s, poor health was positively associated with labor force exit,\nand negatively associated with returns to work. Although these main effects are very strong, we found that health was particu-\nlarly important among individuals for whom retirement was least attractive. Health had its most substantial association with\nwork transitions among men with working wives, as well as among men who were younger, or who had limited nonwork fi-\nnancial resources. Health also had a particularly strong association with work transitions among Black men, but only with refer-\nence to reentry decisions.\nDiscussion. Our results suggest that continued work may have limited appeal for men who are prepared for retirement, even\nwhen they are in excellent health.\nPOOR health is often highlighted as an important considera-\ntion in the decision to leave the labor force (e.g., Hardy,\nseveral studies suggest that disability-related exits occur fre-\nquently as well (Hayward, Friedman, & Chen, 1996; Hayward\nture clearly establishes that poor health serves as a barrier to ac-\ntive labor force participation, and suggests that good health is\nboth a prerequisite for and a motivating force in continued work\nactivity. However, those characteristics and resources that may\nalter the association between health and labor force decisions--\nsuch as features of family life or socioeconomic well-being--\nhave not been systematically examined. The purpose of this\nstudy was to examine the complex association between health\nand work transitions among older men, focusing on both labor\nforce exit and reentry. This research extends and refines our un-\nderstanding of late-life work behavior by showing that the asso-\nciation between health and labor force transitions is conditioned\nby important personal characteristics. For many men--those\nwho are older, who have nonworking wives or are unmarried,\nand those with adequate nonwork incomes--the correspondence\nbetween health status and labor force transitions is very limited.\nWork Life and Health Status\nResearchers agree that poor health often leads to an exit from\nthe paid labor force (see discussions in Bazzoli, 1985;\nBurkhauser, and Quinn (1986) find that older men who experi-\nence a decline in health retire at a younger age than expected.\nRecent evidence from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS)\nalso has shown that health status plays an important role in the\nearly withdrawal of older workers from the labor force (Bound,\nSchoenbaum, & Waidmann, 1995). The intrinsic relationship\nbetween work and health has led some researchers to treat them\nas jointly determined, or to examine retirement and disability\nas alternative pathways out of the labor force (Anderson &\nAt any given time, both health status and work status are em-\nbedded within a series of interlocking transitions. Work status is\naffected not only by features of one's earlier work career, but also\nby features of one's \"health career\" such as the onset and pro-\ngression of a disabling condition (Smith, 1985). All else equal, in-\ndividuals who are in poor health are motivated to leave the labor\nforce, and their healthy counterparts are motivated to stay. In ad-\ndition, reentry and partial retirement occur among a share of those\nretiring, but it is often of short duration (Ruhm, 1990). However,\nonce a person is in a nonworking status, poor health acts as a bar-\nrier to labor force reentry, while good health facilitates it\nThe variable effects ofpoor health on work status.--Given\nthe barriers to work experienced by many individuals in poor\nhealth, we anticipate a strong association between health status\nand work transitions. We expect that older working men in poor\nhealth are more likely to exit the labor force, and older non-\nworking men in poor health are less likely to reenter, than are\ntheir more healthy counterparts. Yet, health status is embedded\nwithin a matrix of other influences shaping work behavior, in-\ncluding the normative acceptability and the affordability of not\nworking, policy-based work disincentives, and factors motivat-\ning the desire for a retirement lifestyle. We anticipate that these\ninfluences will condition the extent to which health and work\ntransitions are associated with one another. Even those in good\nor excellent health may be drawn to nonwork, especially if\nother supports are present. To our knowledge, the ways in\nwhich health and other work-related characteristics influence\nwork transitions have not been systematically examined in pre-\nvious studies. We expect that the marginal influence of health\nwill be most pronounced for those otherwise lacking strong\nmotivation to retire.\nAmong men with limited nonwork income, relatively young\nmen, and men with a working spouse, the motivation to con-\ntinue working is great. All else equal, men who have nonwork\nincomes through pension or other forms of wealth are attracted\nto the retirement status. The nonworker role is particularly ap-\npealing to potential pension recipients; indeed, the work disin-\ncentive features of Social Security and many private pension\nplans are well documented (Quinn & Burkhauser, 1994; Wise,\n1997). In contrast, those lacking pension eligibility must choose\nbetween continued wage work and low retirement incomes,\nwhich may be supplemented by disability benefits in some\ncases. The pull to retirement becomes stronger as men age, both\nthrough normative pressures and through age-graded work dis-\nincentives. As reflected by the long-term decline in labor force\nparticipation of men in industrialized countries world-wide\n(Quinn & Burkhauser, 1994), aging men have increasingly ex-\nperienced a pull toward retirement that makes nonwork a nor-\nmative status, even among those in good health. In addition, lit-\nerature on the coordination of retirement decisions between\nspouses suggests that older men who have nonworking spouses,\nas well as those who are not married, may be more open to the\npossibility of retirement (Henretta & O'Rand, 1983; Henretta,\nSzinovacz, 1989). However, men with working wives also have\nan alternative source of income that may generate an income\nsubstitution effect should labor force exit be desirable.\nPoor health may override other motivations to work, yet\ngood health is expected to amplify these motivations, leading to\nparticularly high probabilities of remaining in the workforce, or\nto reentering the workforce if exit has already occurred. As a\nresult, men who have limited nonwork incomes, who are\nyounger, or who have working wives may be motivated to pur-\nsue a work attachment as long as health does not become so\npoor as to intervene.\nAlthough the interaction of health with other characteristics\nshaping late-life work behavior has not been systematically ad-\ndressed in the literature, some empirical evidence suggests that\nhealth has a stronger effect on retirement for some groups than\nfor others. For example, Sammartino (1987) reviews evidence\nsuggesting that the chances a man in poor health actually retires\nlikely depends on affordability as well as age, while Burr,\nMassagli, Mutchler, and Pienta (1996) note differences between\nBlack and White men in the effects of health on work behavior\n(see also Bound et al., 1995; Bound, Schoenbaum, &\nAdditional evidence suggesting that health may vary in its\ninfluence on work is provided by Henretta, Chan, and O'Rand\n(1992), who examined self-defined responses to work limita-\ntions, using data from the Social Security Administration's New\nBeneficiary Survey. They found that poor health is a significant\npredictor of several reported reasons for retirement that are not\nactually health-based. Thus, many individuals who reported re-\ntiring because they wanted to, could afford it, or for some other\nprimary reason, were also in relatively poor health (although,\naccording to these reports, health was not the factor prompting\nthe retirement). Moreover, among those reporting poor health\nas the primary reason for retirement, many gave additional jus-\ntification such as wanting to retire, or other reasons; this again\nsuggests that for some, health alone may be an insufficient basis\nof action. Although the goal of the Henretta and associates\nstudy (1992) was to examine reported reasons for retirement\nrather than the decision to exit or reenter the labor force, their\nresults suggest that a cluster of characteristics--often including\nhealth in combination with other precipitating factors--may\ndrive labor force decisions. Applied to our study, these results\nsuggest that the association between work transitions and health\nmay be shaped not only by the degree of disability, but also by\nhealth status interacting with other characteristics of the older\nindividual that shape motivation for work transitions.\nPreparation for retirement.--Other studies (e.g., Ekerdt,\nVinick, & Bosse, 1989) suggest that work behavior may be\nshaped by level of preparation for retirement. An individual\nwho has planned for or is otherwise open to nonwork would be\nmore likely to exit the workforce and remain nonworking.\nBecause other factors draw them to retirement, in these cases\nhealth status may be a secondary concern when making choices\nabout work. In contrast, Ruhm (1990) suggests that individuals\nwho make decisions regarding labor supply under conditions of\n\"considerable uncertainty\" experience higher rates of reentry as\na result. Ruhm finds support for this in that younger men, men\nlacking pension coverage, and non-White men are more likely\nto reenter the workforce. Health may be a very salient part of\nthe work-retirement decision process among those who are\nmaking work-related decisions under great uncertainty, and\nwho may not yet be prepared to assume the role of nonworker.\nFor these individuals, the continued attractions of the worker\nrole may be sufficiently great that those in good health continue\nto work, or resume working following a brief hiatus.\nCharacteristics or behaviors that make the nonwork role more\nacceptable, or that may signal the beginnings of a preretirement\nprocess (Ekerdt & DeViney, 1993), are therefore important con-\nsiderations.\nHypotheses\nThese arguments lead to a series of hypotheses about the\nvariable influence of health on labor force transitions. We sug-\ngest that the work-limiting influence of poor health on labor\nforce transitions will be stronger among those for whom non-\nwork may be most economically challenging, for the younger\nmen, as well as for those with working wives. Among those\nwho have or expect higher nonwork income, who are older,\nwho have a nonworking spouse, or who are not married, health\nis expected to make a smaller marginal contribution to the\nchoice to modify labor supply. Some literature (Burr et al.,\n1996) also leads us to anticipate differences in the association\nbetween health and work transitions between White and\nAfrican American men. These effects will be examined empiri-\ncally through inspection of a series of interactions including\nhealth status.\nMETHODS\nData\nIn this study we use data from a merged sample of respon-\nand Program Participation (SIPP; Kasprzyk, Doyle, Goldstein,\n& McMillan, 1987). The SIPP is designed to provide data for a\nnationally representative sample of the civilian, noninstitution-\nalized population. Panels are fielded for 2.5 years; the 1984\nFebruary 1985. The two panels are distinct and contain no over-\nthe present study to form a combined sample, in order to obtain\na larger sample for analysis. The SIPP interviews respondents\nevery 4 months and includes information on labor force behavior,\nhousehold composition, and other characteristics often reported\non a month-to-month basis. Each 4-month reference period is re-\nferred to as a wave. A health topical module through which in-\nformation on health status is obtained occurs in the third wave\nLabor force transitions are identified in this study through a\ncomparison of work status at two timepoints, 8 months apart.\nTo gauge the association between health and labor force transi-\ntions more accurately, we select respondents who participated in\nthe health topical module in each panel. The observation period\nfor this study begins at the time of the health report, which oc-\npanel. Our assessments of initial labor force status and other\ncharacteristics are also obtained at the start of this observation\nperiod. We then assess respondents' labor force status at the end\nof the panels, subsequent to the health report. Inasmuch as the\n1985 panel includes eight waves, and the health report occurs\nin the sixth, we compare labor force status two waves, or eight\nmonths, apart in both panels in order to make the covered time\nperiods equivalent in length. We are therefore comparing labor\nforce status reported in the third and fifth waves of the 1984\npanel, and in the sixth and eighth waves of the 1985 panel. Due\nto the censored nature of the data, the relatively short timeframe\ncovered, and the lack of repeated measures of key covariates\nsuch as health, examining the time dependency of these issues\nis not feasible with the SIPP.\nThe sample includes Black and White men aged 55 to 69 who\neither were included in both thefirstand last waves of our target\nperiod, or died or became institutionalized during this period.\nThose who left the sample during the observation period for\nother reasons (e.g., refusal to continue participating, moving out\nof the interview area) are excluded from the sample. These ex-\nclusions total 522 cases equivalent to 11 % of the unweighted\nsample. Comparisons of the respondents leaving the sample\nwith those remaining suggests that those attriting are less likely\nto report eligibility for pension income, report somewhat lower\nincomes, and are more likely to be from the 1984 panel. All\nother comparisons are not statistically significant.\nFeatures of the sample design and patterns of attrition are ac-\ncounted for by using modified weights generated from the data in\nour analyses. We start with the cross-sectional weights generated\nby the Census Bureau and included in the SIPP data for the initial\nwave of our data. These weights are then adjusted to account for\nattrition occurring during the observation period, taking into con-\nThe respondents selected for this study were born between\nhort. This cohort was indelibly affected by the economic up-\nheaval of the Great Depression (see Elder, 1974), and many of\nits members participated directly or indirectly in World War II.\nThese were among the first birth cohorts to have their work ca-\nreers fully covered by Social Security, and they benefit from the\nsubsequent changes to the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability\nInsurance program, such as the establishment of Medicare and\ninflation-adjusted Social Security payments. Large segments of\nthis cohort took advantage of the GI Bill to pursue higher edu-\ncation and advanced training in technical skills after the war.\nThey are the fathers of the baby boom generation and are noted\nfor the relatively high quality of their health and economic situ-\nations in later life. These men, who at the time of interview\nwere either potential or current retirees, represent a cohort of\nworkers against whom future groups of late-life workers and\nretirees will be evaluated. Although the SIPP data are older than\nemerging data sets with arguably better indicators of health,\nparticularly the Health and Retirement Study, they are the only\nsuitable source of information on this cohort of men, as they\nmove through their critical retirement decision phase of life.\nMoreover, among the most recent data available on the HRS\nyet moved into the ages considered here. In the future, research\nwill undoubtedly examine these same questions when addi-\ntional HRS data become available.\nVariable Definitions\nThe key theoretical variables are labor force participation\nand health. Recent research suggests that, for many older per-\nsons, retirement is far from a crisp transition out of the labor\nforce; instead, men often experience a period of time near the\nend of working life where moves in and out of the labor force\nare common (Mutchler, Burr, Pienta, & Massagli, 1997). Our\ngoal is not to assess retirement--an exit from the labor force\ndoes not necessarily correspond to a decision to retire (Henretta,\n1992). Rather, our purpose is to examine the relative stability of\nworker/nonworker roles in the presence of varying levels of\nhealth. Understanding that these statuses may be imbedded\nwithin a series of work transitions, we focus on labor force par-\nticipation during the month prior to last interview as our out-\ncome measure. This status, as well as labor force participation\nat initial observation, are assessed in the same way: men who\nreport either working, having ajob but not at work (e.g., on va-\ncation or temporary leave), or being unemployed (actively look-\ning for a job) are considered to be labor force participants.\nSeparate analyses are conducted based on labor force status at\nfirst observation, so those initially observed to be not in the\nlabor force, but participating in the labor force at last observa-\ntion, have reentered the labor force. Similarly, those initially ob-\nserved participating in the paid labor force, but not working or\nlooking for work at final observation, have exited the labor\nforce. Results of the separate analyses can therefore be inter-\npreted as reflecting the effects of the independent variables on\nlabor force transitions.\nThe measure of health used in this study is based on a self-\nranking of well-being: the five response categories range from\n\"excellent\" to \"poor.\" Although some observers note that\nmeasures of this type may reflect a desirability bias (Bazzoli,\nsuffer from response bias (Bound, 1991). Moreover, this criti-\ncism is most accurately directed toward concurrent studies of\nhealth and work behavior, in which temporal ordering cannot be\nestablished. In this analysis, self-reported health is assessed at\nthe initial interview, with the analysis focusing on work transi-\ntions occurring in the ensuing months. Note that among those\nnot in the labor force at initial observation, some of whom may\nnot have worked for several years, health status at the time of\nlabor force exit is unknown, although the health report is made\nprior to any work transitions observed during the 8-month ob-\nservation period. Inasmuch as perceived health may be the pri-\nmary basis of action on the part of the individual, the self-rank-\ning measure can be successfully employed as an overall\nindicator of health.\nA number of economic indicators are used in the analysis,\nincluding eligibility for a pension, personal income, and receipt\nof disability income. Pension eligibility assesses the availability\nof pension funds beyond income provided by Social Security.\nRespondents receiving pensions at initial interview are included\nwith those reporting that they would be eligible for pension in-\ncome if they retired within the next few months. Personal in-\ncome is the one-month total recorded at initial interview, re-\nflecting income of the individual prior to transitions in work\nstatus. For those working, much of this income is composed of\nearnings. For those not in the labor force, personal income is a\ncombination of Social Security and/or other nonwage re-\nsources. Income is logged in the multivariate analysis to ac-\ncount for its skewed distribution. Disability payments are also\nan important part of the decision to work (Bound & Waidmann,\nwe cannot assess whether a working individual would be eligi-\nble for disability payments--and virtually no working men re-\nceived those payments--receipt of disability income may form\na substantial barrier to returning to work. Accordingly, a\ndummy variable indicating whether disability payments were\nreceived is included in the reentry model only.\nA number of other indicators relating to work and socioeco-\nnomic status are also examined. Occupational status is mea-\nsured using a dummy variable distinguishing between manual\nand nonmanual workers. This indicator controls for features of\njob demands that impact on the health-labor force association,\nsuch as physical exertion (see Bound et al., 1995; Chirikos &\nfor discussion of occupational effects). For working individuals,\noccupational assessment is based on occupation reported for\ncurrent job. Respondents not working during the time period\nconsidered are assigned a value based on the occupation from\nwhich they retired, or the last occupation reported. Individuals\nwho remained uncoded (n = 264, or 6% of the sample) received\nimputed values on the occupational status measure based on re-\nported years of education.\nAn additional work-related variable is receipt of private in-\nsurance through current or past employment. Wise (1997) sug-\ngests that those covered by an employer's insurance may con-\ntinue to work, if insurance is otherwise unavailable, in order to\nbridge the time period until eligibility for Medicare is estab-\nlished. Moreover, if a worker is eligible for insurance coverage\nas a retiree, labor force exit may be facilitated. Wise finds that\nrespondents in the HRS who are eligible for retiree coverage\nare more likely to plan to retire by age 62, but only among those\nin excellent or very good health. The insurance variable avail-\nable in the SIPP reflects a respondent's coverage by private\nhealth insurance through a current or former employer, union,\nor pension plan.\nFinally, inasmuch as unemployment may precede or perhaps\nprecipitate an exit from the labor force (OECD, 1995), a vari-\nable is included in the exit model indicating whether unem-\nployment was experienced between the first and last observa-\ntion. This variable is not included in the reentry model, because\nmany men attempting to reenter the labor market would often\nexperience at least a short spell of unemployment as they search\nfor work.\nDemographic characteristics included in the analysis are age,\nmarital status, working status of spouse, and race. Age is as-\nsessed at initial observation. Wise (1997) identifies several dis-\ncontinuities in the association between age and work exit, cor-\nresponding to work disincentives in Social Security and many\nto a continuous age variable, spline functions were imposed at\n60,62, and 65 to test for these discontinuities. Spline functions\nat adjacent ages were also examined in order to assess the result\nof \"aging into\" eligibility through the panel. With one excep-\ntion, reflecting a discontinuity at age 65, these spline effects did\nnot significantly improve model fit and were omitted from the\nanalysis. The spline effect at age 65 also acts as an important\ncontrol on the disability variable in the reentry model, inas-\nmuch as those 65 and over are not eligible for disability pay-\nments. Marital status and working status of spouse are assessed\nat first observation. Men whose wives are in the labor force are\ncoded as having working wives. A dummy variable indicating\nrace of respondent is also included, as Black and White patterns\nof work are known to differ substantially throughout the life\nEducation level and net worth, although examined by past\nresearch as potentially related to late-life labor supply (Myers,\ntors of either exit or reentry. Therefore, to preserve statistical\npower, these variables were omitted from the analysis with no\napparent effect on the reported results. Variables not part of the\nanalysis that would be desirable include measures of job satis-\nfaction, self-reported desire for retirement, or other subjective\nindicators of attachment to work or nonwork. As no subjective\nindicators of this sort are available in the SIPP data, they cannot\nbe included in the current analysis.\nRESULTS\noutlined above. Members of the weighted sample have a mean\nage of 62, and 9% are African American. Just over a third of the\nmen have working spouses. About half of the respondents are\nor were manual workers, and nearly three quarters are either re-\nceiving pension income or will be eligible for a pension upon\nretirement. Six percent of these men, all of whom are under age\n65, report receiving some disability income. Half of the respon-\ndents report being covered by private health insurance through\ncurrent or former employer, union, or pension fund.\nTable 1 illustrates the observed transition patterns associated\nwith each work/health status at first interview. Overall, although\nmost older men experienced stable labor force statuses over the\nobservation period, about 10% either changed work status,\ndied, or became institutionalized. The relatively low rates of\nchange are a result both of the short observation period and the\nage heterogeneity of the sample. Given the cumulative nature\nof work exit decisions (e.g., the majority of older men who\nleave the labor force do not return), a longer observation period\nwould necessarily result in our observing a higher rate of exit.\nInasmuch as late-life reentry is often of short duration (Ruhm,\n1990) and embedded in a sequence of labor force exits and\nreentries (Mutchler et al., 1997), a longer time period would not\naffect the reentry rates to the same degree. However, we have\nno reason to believe that a longer time period would necessarily\nchange the extent or conditions under which health affects labor\nforce behavior. These transition patterns illustrate that good\nhealth was significantly associated with a higher level of attach-\nment to the labor force. Among those men initially observed in\nthe labor force, 91% of those in excellent or very good health,\nbut only 83% of those in fair or poor health, remained in the\nlabor force 8 months later. Rates of exit were twice as high\namong those in the worst health compared to those in the best\nhealth (16% vs 8%). Similarly, among those initially observed\nto be out of the labor force, men in excellent or very good\nhealth were more than twice as likely to return to the work force\nas were their counterparts in fair or poor health (8% of those in\nexcellent or very good health, but only 3% of those in fair or\npoor health). Probabilities of dying or becoming institutional-\nized were much higher for those reporting poor health at first\nMerged SIPP Sample3\nFirst Observation\nIn the Labor Force\nExcellent, very good\nhealth\nGood health\nFair, poor health\nNot in the Labor Force\nExcellent, very good\nhealth\nGood health\nFair, poor health\nTotal\nIn the\nLabor Force\n%(n)\nLast Observation\nNot in the Died/\nLabor Force Institutionalized\n%(\u00ab)\n%(\u00ab)\nn\npanels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), waves 3-5\naged 55-69 are included, excluding those who attrited during the months cov-\nered (n = 522).

Rates of exit for those initially\nobserved in the labor force (excluding those dying or becoming\ninstitutionalized in the interim) were 5% for men aged 55-59,\nReentry rates were 11%, 4%, and 3% for the same age groups.\nMoreover, health effects were most substantial among the\nyounger men. For example, the exit rates for the youngest men\nin the poorest health were more than three times as high as the\nrates for similarly aged men in the best health (10% vs 3%), but\namong the oldest men (those 65-69), exit rates were only 14%\nhigher for those in the worst health (24% vs 21 %). A similar\npattern of health convergence with age is noted for reentry.\nAlthough the descriptive results are consistent with our ear-\nlier arguments about the association between health and work\ntransitions, it is necessary to determine whether this pattern\nholds net of other characteristics known to shape labor force\nbehavior. Because of the categorical nature of the outcome vari-\nable, logistic regression techniques are used in the multivariate\nanalyses (Maddala, 1983). The sample is stratified by labor\nforce status at time 1, because the processes of exit and entry\nare assumed to be state-dependent (Hayward et al., 1996).\nAccordingly, two subsamples are defined at initial observation\nand analyzed separately: (a) men in the labor force and (b) men\nnot in the labor force. Stratifying the sample in this way allows\nus to examine the mechanisms determining the labor force exit\nprocess and the labor force reentry process separately, without\nconstraining them to be similar.\nA total of 55 men either died or became institutionalized\nprior to the last observation and are omitted from the multivari-\nate analysis presented in the subsequent tables. Although this\nrepresents only 1.3% of the sample, they are disproportionately\ndrawn from the pool of men reporting poor health at first obser-\nvation; therefore, care was taken to evaluate the potential bias in\nour results due to their exclusion. In additional analyses (not re-\nported here) we included those dying or becoming institutional-\nized as a third outcome category, using multinomial logistic re-\ngression techniques to analyze these models. The estimates\nobtained for the work-related outcomes were virtually identical\nregardless of whether or not death/institutionalization was re-\ntained as a competing outcome. This gives us confidence that\nthe results we report are robust with respect to this issue.\nBecause the retention of this third category poses methodologi-\ncal limitations in later stages of the analysis due to small cell\nvalues, the men who died or became institutionalized during\nthe study period are excluded.\nIn Table 2, odds ratios and confidence intervals from a multi-\nvariate binomial logistic regression analysis are presented. In\nthe first column of results, odds ratios reflect the chances of ex-\niting the labor force among those initially observed participat-\ning in the labor force. The second column reports odds ratios\nfor reentering the labor force, among those initially observed to\nbe not participating. The results illustrate that for this cohort of\nmen, net of other characteristics, poor health prompted an exit\nfrom the labor force among those initially participating, and in-\nhibited return to the labor force among those initially character-\nized as nonworking. Both comparisons reflect a substantial and\nTable 2.

Although self-ranked health is the preferred mea-\nsure for the current analysis, we replicated the analysis using\nthe only other measure of health status available in both the\nin the past 6 months. The results using this measure were very\nsimilar to those reported here.\nWith reference to the remaining variables in the model, and\nconsistent with other literature, an exit from the labor force was\nalso significantly more likely among the older members of this\ncohort (see Table 2, column 1). Nonlinearity in this positive as-\nsociation is indicated by a statistically significant spline effect at\nage 65, suggesting that the positive effect of age flattened\nbeyond the age of 65. Men with working wives were less likely\nto exit the labor force than were their counterparts with\nnonworking wives, and those not married. Those who worked\nin a manual occupation at first observation were significantly\nmore likely to leave the labor force, as were those who were el-\nigible for a pension. Those with more income were less likely\nto leave, reflecting the greater attachment to the work role asso-\nciated with higher wages. Men who experienced an unemploy-\nment event during the 8 months preceding final interview were\nsubstantially more likely to have left the labor force by the last\nobservation, suggesting that unemployment may precipitate\nexit. Race and coverage by employment-sponsored health in-\nsurance were not significantly associated with exits from the\nlabor force after controlling for these other characteristics. The\nmodel fit statistics listed at the bottom of the table suggest a\ngood fit to the data.\nFor this cohort, reentry among men initially observed not\nworking was significantly predicted by a somewhat different\nset of variables (see Table 2, column 2). Health, age, marital\nstatus, and occupation were associated with reentry, suggesting\nthat those in poorer health, those who were older, those without\na working spouse, and those in manual occupations were less\nlikely to reenter the workforce. Those covered by employment-\nsponsored health insurance were much less likely to reenter the\nlabor force (see Pienta, 1996, for similar results using the HRS\ndata). This indicates that the absence of private health insurance\nmay be an important motivation for resuming work. Similarly,\nmen receiving disability income were only a third as likely to\nreenter the labor force as their counterparts without disability\nincome. Income and pension eligibility were not associated\nwith reentry at this stage of the analysis, nor was a discontinu-\nous association with age noted.\nWe next assess the conditions under which health is most\nstrongly associated with work behavior. In the preceding dis-\ncussion, we suggested that men who were most drawn to the\nlabor force--those with working wives and those with limited\nnonwork incomes, as well as those who were younger--would\nbe most sensitive to health contingencies. Analytically, these\nexpectations require us to examine a series of interactions be-\ntween health and other characteristics of the individual. Wefita\nseries of models, each including a single interaction with health,\nand examine the results for improvement in model fit over the\nresults presented in Table 2 (model fit statistics are available\nfrom the corresponding author). In order to establish the condi-\ntions under which health has a variable association with work\nbehavior, all interactions including the combination of health\nand the other variables were examined. To facilitate interpreta-\ntion, predicted probabilities are generated based on the results,\nusing a consistent set of characteristics associated with the \"av-\nerage\" respondent (see footnote a in Table 3).\nAcross the sets of results, only two interactions improved the\nfit of the model for those at risk of exiting the labor force: the\ninteractions of health with marital status and with age. For those\nat risk of reentry (those not working at first observation), four\ninteractions significantly improved model fit: those involving\nhealth with pension eligibility, with personal income, with age,\nand with race. With the exception of race, these are the interac-\ntions we expected. The figures reported in Panel A of Table 3\nrefer to the probability that the typical respondent working at\nfirst observation was no longer working at the last observation.\nThefirstcolumn reports this probability for men who are in ex-\ncellent health (ranking 1 on the 5-point scale), and the second\nTable 3.

Estimates are based on an \"average\" respondent:\naged 62, not married/with nonworking spouse, eligible for a pension, manual\noccupation, mean income given time 1 work status, except when otherwise\nnoted in the Table. The formula for calculating predicted probabilities from bi-\nnomial logistic regression results is as follows (Cherlin, Kiernan, & Chase-\nLansdale, 1995):/? = (e^/(l + eXii)). The estimates from the multivariate logis-\ntic regression models used to compute the predicted probabilities are available\nfrom the authors.\nbMeasured at time 1; therefore reflects nonwork income only.\nand third columns report the probability for men who were in\ngood or poor health, respectively (ranking 3 or 5 on the scale).\nAll other respondent characteristics are the same for each row's\nestimates. The fourth column in the table reports the signifi-\ncance level of the interaction term (in all cases the main effects\nretain or take on significance as well).\nThe first line of the table reports estimated probabilities\nbased on the Table 2 results, and shows the progressive increase\nin probability of exit associated with poorer health. The next\ntwo lines of Table 3 (Panel A) are based on interactions between\nmarital status and health. The predicted probability of exit for\nmen with working wives and in excellent health was 0.07.\nSimilar men in poor health had a predicted probability of exit\nof 0.31. In contrast, men who had nonworking spouses and men\nwho were not married were not as responsive to health status in\ntheir decisions to leave the labor force. Those who reported ex-\ncellent health had a predicted probability of exit of 0.17--\nwhich is substantially higher than the other men in excellent\nhealth--but this probability increased to only 0.24 among those\nin poor health. In short, health had a significantly smaller im-\npact on these men's decisions to leave the labor force. The re-\nsults suggest that having a working wife may strengthen men's\nattachment to work if they themselves are in good health, yet\nfacilitates work exit among men who are in poor health (see\nThe interaction of age and health also results in a significant\nimprovement in model fit for men initially observed in the labor\nforce. These results suggest that younger men in this cohort\nwere most sensitive to health contingencies. Consistent with\nour arguments, those likely to have the greatest continued at-\ntachment to work--here, those too young to receive substantial\nretirement benefits--were most responsive to poor health. Men\nage 58 who were in poor health were expected to exit the labor\nforce at a rate that is four times the rate of their counterparts in\nexcellent health. In contrast, men age 62 who were in poor\nhealth had an expected probability of exit that is 1.5 times as\ngreat as their healthy counterparts. By age 66, men who were in\npoor health were expected to exit at a rate just 40% more than\ntheir healthy counterparts.\nPanel B of Table 3 reports predicted probabilities for the\nreentry models including interactions of health with pension el-\nigibility, personal (nonwork) income, age, and race. The first\nline suggests that, overall, the probability of return to work is\nlow, but that the effect of health is substantial. With regard to\npension coverage, differences in the probability of returning to\nthe labor force were minimal across levels of health, among\nthose eligible for or receiving pension income. Members of this\ncohort who were nonworkers with pensions were very unlikely\nto return to work even if in excellent health. In contrast, those\nwith no pension eligibility were significantly more likely to\nreenter if in excellent health. Overall, although the probability\nof return was small across the board, the effect of health was\nnegligible for those covered by a pension, but more sizable for\nthose not covered.\nHealth status also has a more substantial association with\nlabor force transitions among those with limited nonwork in-\ncome. Nonworking men with incomes at the 25th percentile\nwere substantially more likely to return to work if they were in\nexcellent health than if they were in poor health (a predicted\nprobability of 5% as opposed to 1%), while effect of health was\nprogressively more constrained for men at higher levels of in-\ncome. We note that these interactive effects of personal income\nand pension eligibility are, as would be expected, highly corre-\nlated with one another. When both sets of interactions are in-\ncluded in the same model, the coefficients involving pension el-\nigibility become nonsignificant, suggesting that both are\nreflecting higher nonwork economic resources.\nSimilar to the pattern reported for labor force exit, the inter-\naction with age reflects a strong impact of health on reentry\namong the youngest men, with health having little association\nwith reentry among those who were older. Finally, model fit\nstatistics suggest that a model including a race interaction\nprovides a significantly better fit to the data than does the main\neffects model, for the men initially observed not working. The\npredicted probabilities for both groups of men suggest that the\nassociation between health and work transitions was more lim-\nited for White men than for Black men in this cohort. Notably,\nBlack men in excellent health were particularly likely to return\nto work by the last observation. This result is consistent with\nthe observation that the higher levels of nonwork among older\nBlack men are more reflective of poor health than of the greater\ndesirability of the retirement status (Burr et al., 1996; Hayward\nDISCUSSION\nLabor force transition patterns of men aged 55-69 in the\nmid-1980s were examined with the goal of developing an un-\nderstanding of the conditions under which health status is re-\nlated to work behavior in later life. Previous research has estab-\nlished the association of health with work status and transitions\nOur study demonstrates that for the cohort of men considered\nhere, the effects of health status on both labor force exit and\nreentry are sizable. Those in poor health were considerably\nmore likely than their more healthy counterparts to leave the\nlabor force and to remain nonworking.\nAlthough selected interactions between health and other\nwork-related characteristics have been suggested in the litera-\nture, previous research has not systematically examined the ex-\ntent to which other relevant characteristics condition the associ-\nation between health and late-life work transitions. Our study\nextends previous literature by examining these interactive ef-\nfects. Results presented here suggest that for this cohort of men,\nhealth had its most substantial impact on those who were other-\nwise attracted to work because of family, normative, or eco-\nnomic factors. For example, men in our study who were in ex-\ncellent health and unmarried, or married to nonworking wives,\nwere much less sensitive to health contingencies in decisions to\nexit the labor force, suggesting that they may have been eager\nto experience retirement while in a healthy state. Those most\nlikely to continue working or return to work were those with\nother characteristics fostering a continued work attachment--in\nparticular, those whose wives were still working and those with\nlimited nonwork financial resources. The interactions of health\nwith age and with race (on labor force return) suggest that nor-\nmative or other pressures not measured here may also play a\nrole in an individual's response to health.\nOur results show that for older men in the mid-1980s, health\nshaped work behavior in different ways, depending upon other\nwork-related characteristics. If this pattern holds for subsequent\ncohorts, our results suggest that the influence of trends in health\nand disability may be partially determined by trends in other\nwork-related characteristics, such as marital status and eco-\nnomic status. For example, a combination of improved health\namong men, and rising rates of labor force participation among\nmarried women, would be expected to increase the attachment\nof men to the labor force. Yet, either trend in isolation would\nhave the opposite effect. Because men in moderate to poor\nhealth have lower than expected attachments to work if they are\nmarried to working women, rising rates of labor force activity\namong married women in the absence of improved health of\nolder men may result in higher rates of exit and lower rates of\nreentry. Similarly, rising rates of marital disruption may result\nin health having less of an influence on older men's work tran-\nsitions in the future.\nShould health status continue to improve into later life as ex-\npected, our results indicate that patterns of nonwork earlier in\nlater life may be curbed somewhat as a result. In our study, the\nyoungest men with the best health were least likely to exit the\nworkforce, and most likely to return if an exit had already oc-\ncurred. Yet, for this cohort, health had a substantially smaller\nassociation with work behavior for men in their 60s and be-\nyond. Improved health for these age groups, while a worthy\ngoal on other bases, may have little impact on labor force par-\nticipation rates among older men.\nOur study demonstrates that economic status also shaped the\nassociation between health and labor force transitions for this\ncohort, especially with regard to the reentry decision.\nAccordingly, the future impact of health on labor force transi-\ntions may be partially a result of trends in economic well-being\nin later life. Some research suggests that tomorrow's elderly co-\nhorts will be at least as well off in retirement as were their par-\nents (Easterlin, Schaeffer, & Macunovich, 1993). If so, efforts\nto retain healthy older men as part of the workforce will need to\nfocus on developing additional attractions to the work role, per-\nhaps focusing on the intrinsic appeal of work. However, other\nanalysts regard the economic status of future elderly cohorts as\nmore uncertain, given the rising age at which an individual may\nreceive full Social Security benefits, future (as yet undefined)\nchanges in Social Security eligibility, and the potentially nega-\ntive economic consequences of greater emphasis on defined-\ncontribution pension systems (Besl & Kale, 1996). As well,\nchanges in Medicare, coupled with the increasing reluctance\namong employers to offer retiree health insurance coverage\n(Besl & Kale, 1996), may alter the true costs of nonwork.\nShould economic difficulty be more commonly experienced in\nlater life, or should older men come to regard even the combi-\nnation of Social Security and pension incomes as inadequate to\nsupport their desired retirement lifestyle, the dual statuses of\nhealthy nonworker may become something that few older men\ncan afford. If so, we expect that labor force attachment may be-\ncome stronger, at least among those in good health.\nLimitations of the Study\nOur results, although suggestive, must be interpreted with an\nunderstanding of the limitations of our study. One limitation\nrelates to the short time period covered here. Due to the single re-\nport of health status in these data, men are observed over a period\nofjust 8 months, over which time work transitions are necessar-\nily limited in number. A longer observation period would result\nin higher estimated transition rates and, if there is a long lag\ntime between health-compromising events and work behavior\naccommodations, our analysis offers an incomplete assessment\nof the association between health and work transitions.\nHowever, it is unclear whether the primary outcomes of this\nstudy--examining the association between health and transi-\ntion rates, singly as well as interacting with other work-related\ncharacteristics--would be modified with a longer observation\nperiod. An understanding of the extent to which this limitation\nshapes our results will require replication with additional data,\nusing longer observation periods.\nAnother limitation of our study is the single self-reported\nassessment of health. If self-assessments are offered with sub-\nsequent work transitions planned, our conclusions may be\ncompromised. Moreover, although researchers of the health-\nemployment relationship have yet to agree on an optimal mea-\nsurement of health, a multiple indicator approach to assessing\nhealth would provide more confidence in our results (see Bound\nAn additional limitation is the lack of any subjective evalua-\ntions of work and retirement, such as attitude toward retirement\nand satisfaction with work, by the respondents in our study. It is\nuseful to consider the less tangible benefits of work for older in-\ndividuals if older men in good health are to be attracted to the\nworld of work. In addition, if some of the measures included\nare in fact proxies for intrinsic appeal of work (e.g., occupation,\nincome), our conclusions may be limited.\nFinally, the omission of women from the analysis is an impor-\ntant limitation. The exclusion of women from this study is justi-\nfied by the knowledge that women respond to work-related char-\nacteristics in different ways than do men (see Pienta, Burr, &\nMutchler, 1994), and the likelihood that the factors influencing\nthe association between health and work transitions also differ.\nYet, as women continue to make up a growing portion of the total\nworkforce, our understanding of the issues examined here will\nremain partial until parallel studies are completed for women.\nFuture research should focus on remedying these limitations\nof our research and establishing the generalizability of our re-\nsults. Although other data suitable for the examination of work\ntransitions suffer from their own unique limitations, the basic\nissues considered here could be examined using data from the\nNational Longitudinal Survey of Older Men, the Retirement\nHistory Study, and other data sources. Emerging data from the\nHealth and Retirement Study offer a promising opportunity for\nreplication of our results, and possible modification of our con-\nclusions, based on the experience of more recent cohorts. In ad-\ndition, the HRS offers multiple measures of health as well as\nsome constructs not available in our study. Indeed, several\ntrends in late-life work behavior, as well as the economy at\nlarge, suggest that contemporary cohorts may display some-\nwhat different patterns of behavior than those reported here\n(Herz, 1995). An increase in the number of pension recipients\nwho are working in the paid labor force over the last decade or\nmore may have contributed to growing normative support for\nworking in later life across the board. Along with these norma-\ntive shifts, other changes may have resulted in fewer barriers to\nreentering the labor force among contemporary cohorts.\nParticularly important in this regard is the growing importance\nof the service economy, which is noted for its flexible time\nscheduling and limited physical demands placed on workers.\nIncreased availability ofjobs with these characteristics may re-\nsult in today's older individuals in moderate to poor health\nbeing less likely to leave, and more likely to return, than those\n"
