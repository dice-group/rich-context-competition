Different studies have cast doubt over the validity of this indicator as it tends to overestimate actual attendance to a significant degree. The aim of this article is to compare data on church attendance provided by two different types of research conducted in the United States between 1975 and 2010: survey data (GSS) and data obtained from time use surveys (ATUS). This comparison has three main objectives: (1) to confirm the hypothesis that survey data tend to overestimate actual attendance; (2) to show that this overestimation is not constant over time and space, but tends to vary in an erratic and unpredictable way; and (3) to demonstrate that data provided by time use surveys are more reliable than the frequencies of churchgoing provided by traditional surveys when the objective is to identify trends in religiosity in a population.",

A central aspect of the recent debate on advancing knowledge\nabout religiosity focuses on the different problems of measurement using questionnaires and\ndaily diaries. The aim of this study is to clarify the meaning of the different indicators of church\nattendance that can be obtained from the two survey tools and assess their validity by using the\nUnited States as a specific case study.\nAs we shall see, \"church attendance\" can take on two different empirical forms: frequency of\nchurchgoing over a given period of time, which is more common and is usually measured using\nquestionnaires, or presence at church on one or more Sundays, which is used more rarely and is\nmainly measured through the completion of daily diaries.1\nAlthough the validity of frequency indicators has been under discussion for some time, there\nis still no unanimous consensuson the matter; some researchers advocate using them (Caplow\nNote: This article is an equal collaboration between these authors.
