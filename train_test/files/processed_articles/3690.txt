Several\nauthors have defined infotainment formats as audiovisual techniques and production\nstyles that emphasize dramatic structures, personalization, and human-interest approaches\nin television news stories. Examples of such techniques are eye-catching visuals, camera\nshots, movements and transitions, music background, montage techniques, and so on\nment consists of making news and politics engaging and emotionally rich (Thussu,\n2007), this form of news presentation has become a successful way to increase public\nAlthough infotainment has often been referred to as a synonym of soft news, its\nhybrid style is not confined to deal with a closed list of topics. A number of scholars have\nemphasized that the mode of presentation of the news is also decisive in regard to what\non this framework, this study will move beyond the topic dimension by focusing on the\naspects concerning the visual stylistic devices and audiovisual editing techniques. It\nanalyses the presence of infotainment in hard news and soft news stories and examines\nto what extent infotainment news formatting has taken place in the construction of social,\neconomic, political, and cultural reality in European television news.\nPrevious research has shown that television broadcasters experienced a gradual\nincrease in the development of infotainment formats in the narrative of television news\nstories of both American and European countries (Gonzalo et al., 2014; Grabe et al.,\nfor this increase can be found in media commercialization. Specifically, in Europe, the\nmajority of studies have addressed infotainment from a marketing perspective by\nasserting that media commercialization makes a difference in infotainment news con-\ntent and formatting on different television stations (Gonzalo et al., 2014). Although\nresults show that the effects of media commercialization for the European television\nmarket can still be seen in the amount of infotainment news employed by both public\nand private channels (Vettehen et al., 2011), the evidence for this relationship is insuf-\nficient. The current study adds to a more general understanding of the penetration of\ninfotainment in the production of TV news across Europe by examining the influences\nof market forces and media policy changes on the degree to which current European\nTV news is relying on stylistic elements of infotainment to narrate news topics. More\nspecifically, this study will focus on the television news market in the Netherlands,\nSpain, and Ireland; three European countries that present similarities regarding the\neconomic structures of the media market for private television channels, but differ-\nences when it comes to government policies regulating public media broadcasting ser-\nvices in the three countries.\nConceptualization, origins, and operationalization of\ninfotainment\nThe term infotainment refers to the merging of current affairs, news, and entertainment\nprogramming, and reflects modern trends in journalism (Thussu, 2007). In television\nAlencar and Kruikemeier 3\nnews, infotainment is characterized by the use of several dramatic structures, such as\nconflicts, personalization, interpersonal interactions, and a variety of audiovisual effects\ninfotainment point out that consensus cannot be reached regarding the conceptualization\nand origins of the term (Garc\u00eda Avil\u00e9s, 2007; Stark, 1997). Some authors argue that info-\ntainment dates back to 1960s and 1970s in the local news broadcasts of the United States\n(Gonzalo et al., 2014; Stark, 1997). Elements of narrative structures characteristic of\nfictional genres were adapted and used in local news programs as a new commercial\nstrategy to attract the audience and later on, it spread across American national TV chan-\nYet, interestingly, some scholars provide evidence to support the claim that infotain-\nment has actually emerged between the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the phenome-\nnon was largely spread in Western television channels (Prado, 2007; Vettehen et al.,\n2011). They note that the increasing popularity of commercial broadcasts against public\nnetworks explains the emanation of infotainment. In fact, one of the main reasons for the\nblurring of fact and fiction, news and drama, popular culture and reality, is rooted in the\nproliferation of cable channels and Internet sites that led to long-term transformations of\nthe business and production models operated by news organizations (Bennett, 2005).\nAlso, a shift in journalism standards towards the construction of dramatic sociopolitical\nscenarios is another intermediate factor that reinforces the use of infotainment in the nar-\npresentation of TV news stories to viewers offers similar characteristics of emotionally\ncompelling narratives, such as television series and soap operas.\nAs a consequence, this topic has raised concerns about the quality of news media both\nin public and academic spheres, arguing that infotainment trivializes news and current\naffairs resulting in serious implications for factual political knowledge and opinion form-\ning (Baum, 2003; Moy et al., 2005). Infotainment has often been connected to pejorative\nterms, such as tabloidization and sensationalism (Baym, 2005; Grabe et al., 2001;\nSchudson, 2003), contributing to a decrease in political knowledge conveyed by the\nmedia. The problem allegedly is that infotainment in television news complies with nar-\nratives that banalize even the most serious subjects by promoting entertaining televisual\nFrom this viewpoint, infotainment news has negative effects on how viewers process\nthe news. However, a number of studies have demonstrated that infotainment news char-\nacteristics have some beneficial effects on message comprehension and recall, given the\npotential of its features to convey narrative patterns that evoke high levels of emotions\namong viewers (Vettehen et al., 2011). Fr\u00fch and Wirth (as cited in Machill et al., 2007)\nhave analyzed the effects of various degrees of infotainment on the retention of televi-\nsion contents. The authors argue that the moderate use of certain infotainment features,\nsuch as cut frequency, camera movement, movement of objects, use of music background\nand special effects, results in the perception of quality information and the increase of\nretention performances. Instead, the negative use of these elements affects the perceived\nquality of information leading to a decrease in retention levels. For instance, a combina-\ntion of multiple infotainment characteristics may lead to poor outcomes in terms of recall\n4 Journalism \nIt is not, however, difficult to foresee that the increasing penetration of technical info-\ntainment features in the narrative of the news plays a crucial role in shaping the implica-\ntions of the phenomenon for audience processing of public information, as well as for\ndemocratic discourses. Recently, scholars have devoted greater attention to empirical\nanalysis of formal features of television news, arguing that a focus on topics/events is\ninsufficient to assess narrative patterns that influence the way infotainment is actually\nNarrative structure of television infotainment news\nThe structure of audiovisual narration in television infotainment news consists of organ-\nizing and articulating the various technical elements and editing techniques that provoke\nsensory and emotional reactions among viewers. Various audiovisual techniques defin-\ning infotainment news have been explored in studies conducted in both American and\nEuropean TV news programs (Djerf-Pierre, 2000; Gonzalo et al., 2014; Grabe et al.,\nclose-ups, camera movements, frequency of camera shots and transitions, post-produc-\ntion techniques, and audio manipulations. This study examines the various formal pro-\nduction feature categories that are characteristics of infotainment, but also to integrate\nnew structural techniques deriving from fictional narratives that actually have the poten-\ntial to include infotainment in the story. This section presents the first conceptual phase\nof the research by providing a detailed description of the audiovisual features used to\nidentify the presence of infotainment in our sample. In this study, the audiovisual narra-\ntive techniques fall into six categories (see Table 1 for an overview).\nThe type of image category refers to the organization of infotainment news accord-\ning to its visual expression. In this study, this category concerns the use of stock news\nimages where the image does not coincide with the content (Brosius, 1993). This genre\noften favors a choice of visuals that impacts viewers and promotes the spectacle of\nnews and the integration of dramatic elements in the production of television news\n(Lester and Cottle, 2009). The shot length category refers to the use of close-ups. This\nshows very little background, and concentrates on either a face, or a specific detail of\nmise-en-sc\u00e8ne.\nThe third audiovisual narrative category refers to camera movement techniques. They\nhave the potential to generate greater emotional involvement when exploring techniques\nthat feature more movement. In this study, there are four basic techniques that are often\nused to engage audiences: zoomshots, handheld, panning, boom (Gonzalo et al., 2014:\n90). Zoom lens contains a mechanism that changes the magnification of an image and\ngives the impression of movement and excitement in a scene where it does not exist. As\nto content analyses, Grabe et al. (2001: 641) analyzed the presence of zoom camera\nlenses in US TV newsmagazines. The results show that a `generous use of zoom move-\nments indicates a sensational production style' (Grabe et al., 2001: 647). In what refers\nto handheld camera movements, they can make the audience feel as if they are part of a\nscene, rather than viewing it from a detached, frozen position. Because handheld camera\nis used to heighten tension and give realism to events, this technique is included as a\npotentially infotainment feature. Panning is another structural feature that gives the shot\nAlencar and Kruikemeier 5\na feeling of movement and speed. It is used to give the viewer a panoramic view of a set.\nThis can be used to establish a scene. Aerial drones give a bird's eye view (boom). This\nworks and looks similar to a construction crane. It is used for high sweeping shots or to\nfollow the action of a subject (Garc\u00eda Jim\u00e9nez, 2003).\nThe forms of transition category illustrate the relationship between shots and how\nthey work together to form narrative meanings. Transition forms are editing techniques\nused to escalate the visual sequence with the purpose to draw and hold the viewer's atten-\ntion to the issues (Zettl, 2006). These types of visual resources can improve viewer's\nunderstanding and increase emotions as they provide more visually attractive news sto-\nSchaefer, 2001). Schudson (2003) warned that the increasing production of news that\nfocuses on sensationalism can limit the quality of journalism, and therefore, the ability of\nthe public to make informed social and political decisions. Zaller (2003) counters this\nclaim by calling for a change in new standards for news quality. Zaller argues that the use\nof entertaining editing techniques and `engaging displays' in news items helps focus the\npublic's attention on important issues. Based on Grabe et al. (2001), this study identifies\nthree stylized transitions that are often present in infotainment news packages: dissolves,\nTable 1. Overview of the narrative features.\nCategory Sub-category Description\nType of image Stock news images Showing an image that does not coincide\nwith the content\nShot length Close-up Using close-ups with less focus on the\nbackground\nCamera movement\ntechniques\nZoomshot Changes the magnification of an image\n\u00ad Handheld Camera is held in one's hand while\nmaking images\n\u00ad Panning Moving the camera to get a panoramic\noverview of a scene\n\u00ad Boom Using high sweeping shots to follow\nactions or to show a scene\nForms of transition Dissolve Gradual transition from shot to shot that\ntemporarily overlap\n\u00ad Fade Goes gradually to black or appears\ngradually from black\n\u00ad Wipe Supplant an image by wiping it off the\nscreen\nNarrative structure or\nmontage techniques\nMetric Series of related and unrelated events\nimages that are flashed on the screen\n\u00ad Analytic Editing a scene to show cause-and-effect\n\u00ad Comparison Comparing similar themes (e.g., in timing)\n\u00ad Collision The use of opposing imagery to suggest a\nthird concept\nAudio expression Music The use of music\n6 Journalism \nfades, and wipes. The image dissolves' technique features a gradual transition from shot\nto shot in which the two images temporarily overlap (Smith, 1991; Zettl, 2006). In the\ncase of `fades' or `dips', the picture either goes gradually to black (fade-out) or appears\ngradually on the screen from black (fade-in), signifying, much like a theater curtain, a\ndefinite beginning or end of sequence (Zettl, 2006). Wipe appears to supplant an image\nby wiping it off the screen (Smith, 1991; Zettl, 2006); it is a technique that draws atten-\ntion to itself and acts as a clear marker of change.\nThe montage editing category is defined as a series of processes that impose into the\npackage the news worker's interpretation of the event (Zettl, 1999: 292). Infotainment\nnarratives tend to explore more editing styles in news production. Zettl (1999) indicates\nfour main types of montage techniques in news package. First is the (1) metric montage,\nwhich according to Zettl (1999) features a series of related and unrelated events images\nthat are flashed on the screen at more or less equally spaced intervals; the scene is viewed\nas occurring faster. The fast cutting of images is used to convey higher tension and it is\nadapted to the rhythm of the music, emulating the style of video clip; (2) analytical mon-\ntage means editing a scene to show cause-and-effect; this technique usually promotes\nengagement and learning by requiring the viewer to fill in the blanks; (3) comparison\nmontage compares similar themes as expressed in dissimilar events; this technique\ndepicts a conflict or similarity between two subjects by presenting two points in time\nwithin one sequence; (4) collision montage uses opposing imagery to suggest a third\nconcept. In his longitudinal study, Schaefer (2001) has identified an increase over the\npast three decades in the number of montage editing techniques in television news. His\nstudy assumes that hard news \u00ad often associated with the use of more realistic/dry\naccounts featured by low levels of montage techniques \u00ad are developing narrative modes\nthat further explore infotainment resources and put more emphasis on dramatic elements\n(conflict, emotion, and personalization).\nFinally, the audio expression category was defined by the use of music in news items.\nIt is a crucial technical component in the articulation of infotainment and part of the edit-\ning process. Studies show that music contributes to give rise to emotions, drama, and\nhumor experienced by viewers (Seidman, 1981). Grabe et al. (2001) and Vettehen et al.\n(2011) have also measured the frequency and duration of music occurrences in their\nstudies.\nThe television news market in the Netherlands, Spain, and\nIreland\nIn the early 1990s, the liberalization and deregulation of the media in most European\ncountries had opened the doors for unprecedented competition between public television\nbroadcasters and the newly arrived domestic and foreign commercial rivals with their\npopular and entertaining programming (Garc\u00eda Avil\u00e9s, 2007). In what concerns the\nDutch case, the year of 1989 was marked by the end of the monopoly of public service\nbroadcasting with the rise of commercial broadcasts (Vettehen et al., 2011: 100). RTL\nNieuws was the first TV news program to compete with NOS Journaal, covering both\ndomestic and international news. In 1990, three commercial broadcast channels were\nlaunched in Spain: Tele-5, Antena 3, and Canal Plus. As a result, the public broadcaster\nAlencar and Kruikemeier 7\nRTVE (Radiotelevisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola) experienced a decline in audience numbers (Medina\nand Ojer, 2010). The Irish broadcasting landscape also experienced dynamic changes\nover the past years. National competition in television news market has been attributed\nto national economic growth, with the launch of TV3 in 1998, which is privately owned\nby a British private-equity group (Rafter et al., 2014). Until then, the public broadcast\nchannel RT\u00c9 had the full benefit of the available domestic advertising and its audience\ncompetition was limited to the UK services (i.e. BBC, UTV/ITV, and Channel 4).\nAs a result of the multiplication of the number of TV broadcasting stations in the three\ncountries, public broadcasting services started responding more and more to production\npatterns that clash with the public mission to serve democratic values and increase citi-\nzen knowledge about public affairs (Blumler, 1992). The intense competition for time\nand attention of audiences has gradually led public broadcasters to provide new formats\nand reporting styles featuring infotainment characteristics that were most commonly\nused in the new private channels (Hamilton, 2004).\nMore recently, the studies of Vettehen et al. (2011) and Gonzalo et al. (2014) have\nexamined the penetration of audiovisual infotainment features in public and commercial\ntelevision news broadcasts in the Netherlands and Spain, respectively. Their research indi-\ncates that the level of infotainment features have increased in Dutch and Spanish televi-\nsion news and that existing programs, such as the case of public TV news programs, have\nreacted to new programs by increasing the amount of infotainment in their news stories.\nSince 2012, the Dutch public broadcaster NOS has launched a new format for the NOS\nJournaal, which prioritizes stories that are relevant to viewers in detriment of the signifi-\ncance of facts (Gelauff, 2012). In the actual Spain's media landscape, infotainment has\nbeen consolidated in mainstream television channels with slight differences across public\nand private networks (Gonzalo et al., 2014). Studies on the tabloidization of the Irish\nmedia show two factors that can explain the demand for `tabloidization'in the Irish media\nsphere (Barrett, 2000). The first concerns the influence of British newspapers on the style\nof the Irish press. The close relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom ensures\nthat many Irish people were regularly reading British newspapers (Barrett, 2000). The\nsecond refers to the competitive Irish newspaper sphere, with the increase of the number\nof news media in the country. In this regard, it is important to mention that the majority of\nhouseholds had easy access to UK and other international channels, contributing to a\nhighly competitive television market for domestic stations (Rafter et al., 2014).\nConsequently, the penetration of infotainment is the result of increasing market pressures\nand can impact differently on varying media markets (Esser, 1999). In this sense, the political\ncontext is an important predictor of media dependence on economic forces. As Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck\n(2008) puts it, `the political system sets the institutional and regulatory boundaries for the\nmarkets within which the media are required to operate' (p. 241). Increasing independence\nfrom politics is thus strongly correlated with an increase in media commercialization. In Spain,\nboth public and private broadcasting no longer operate under the same political and economic\nmodels, which might influence the production of news. Since 2009, public media organiza-\ntions in Spain do not convey advertising contents, and, as a consequence, these do not consti-\ntute one of its sources of funding (Medina and Ojer, 2010). To some extent, different broadcast\nownership in the Netherlands and Ireland fall under the same economic and political regula-\ntions (Rafter et al., 2014; Vettehen et al., 2011). Overall, public and commercial broadcasts in\n8 Journalism \nboth countries became more dependent on market funds, whereas in Spain, broadcast owner-\nship fairs equally in terms of public and private funding (public broadcasting services depend\non the State while commercial stations depend on the market). So, in sum, it could be sug-\ngested that differences across countries can also be explained by policy changes in public\nbroadcast services of the three nations. The first research hypothesis follows from this:\nH1. Irish and Dutch television news broadcasts will use more audiovisual infotain-\nment features compared to Spanish television news programs.\nAs noted above, the new conditions imposed by the market in the search for the high-\nest audience ratings determine the new situation with television channels in the three\ncomparative nations. From the 1990s onwards, the time devoted to advertising has\nincreased considerably (Prado, 2007; Vettehen et al., 2011). Increased revenues and eco-\nnomic growth for both private and public television have taken place in the Netherlands\nand Ireland. The funding of public broadcast services in both countries has been pro-\nvided by both commercial and public sources, while commercial television channels\ndepended heavily on advertising and sponsoring.1 After the elimination of advertising as\na source of revenue for public media corporations in Spain, competition for the market-\ning share has increased among commercial broadcasting services (Medina and Ojer,\n2010). Given this background, private broadcasts in the three countries may be more\nvulnerable to infotainment. This leads to the second research hypothesis:\nH2. Commercial news broadcasts will use more audiovisual infotainment techniques\nin their stories than public news broadcasts.\nTypically, the formal characteristics of infotainment news are more likely to be found\nin the structure of soft news than that of hard news stories. The latter is characterized by\nthe use of a more formal structure, while soft news features storytelling forms and edit-\ning techniques to hook viewers, and to reel them in (Graber, 1994). In this light, it is\nargued that the narrative found in `soft news'resembles the characteristics defining info-\ntainment (Patterson, 2000). This study does not aim to quantify the thematic selection of\ninfotainment in television news programs of the three countries, but the extent to which\nformal infotainment features are present in the narrative form of hard news and soft\nnews. In other words, this study examines whether a better fit exists between soft news\ntopics and infotainments features compared to hard news topics and infotainments fea-\ntures. The third research hypothesis follows from this:\nH3. The use of audiovisual narrative features in soft news is greater than in hard news\ntopics.\nMethod\nDesign and sampling method\nOur content analysis included a sample of 639 news reports aired in the first 3weeks of\nSeptember 2013, in six prime-time TV news broadcasts of Ireland, Spain, and the\nAlencar and Kruikemeier 9\nNetherlands, one public and one commercial TV news broadcast in each country. Our\nselection of public broadcasting channels included Nine o'clock news (Ireland),\nTelediario 2 (Spain), and NOS Journaal (Netherlands). On the side of commercial TV\nnews,weanalyzedTV3News(Ireland),Noticias2(Spain),andRTLNieuws(Netherlands).\nBecause our analysis is concerned with the presence of infotainment elements rather than\nfocused on a specific topic or period, three full weeks of analysis of each news outlet\nwere used to answer our research questions and test the hypotheses proposed. No major\nevent occurred in the period of analysis, such as elections, holidays, or important sports\nevents that could potentially affect the study results.\nNews reports were selected as unit of analysis due to the high visibility of technical\ncomponents in this type of format. For being a self-contained story, a news report format\nfacilitates the operation of infotainment narratives and the description of their constituent\nelements. Beyond this, the selection of the news report content and format as unit of\nanalysis is chosen for being directly related to television news production in the frame-\nwork of the so-called News Industry (Pew Research Center's Journalism Project, 2014).\nIn this sense, news report is one of the media products that need to provide information\nin a manner that is profitable and in compliance with the needs of shareholders and\nviewers.\nThe coders were trained and supervised during a week of coding meetings at the\nUniversity of Amsterdam. Intercoder reliability was calculated based on a subsample of\n14 and 15 - in two coder sessions \u00ad TV news items using pairwise percentage agreement.\nWe found that this was continually above 64.4percent and thus indicated that the meas-\nurements were reliable.\nMeasurements\nIn order to examine the narrative elements characterizing infotainment in the news items\nfrom the six television news programs, this article has focused on the narrative structural\nvariables that indicate the use of infotainment in the piece. We take into account the top-\nics of a given news item as well as its format and audiovisual narrative elements.\nIndependent variables. The variable type of news broadcasts was defined as public and\ncommercial television news programs, including one type of news outlet per country\n(0=`public' and 1=`commercial', M=0.43, standard deviation (SD)=0.50). This code\nallowed for the assessment of possible differences regarding the use of infotainment in\ncountries that have a public as well as commercial broadcasting. The variable country\n32.3%). The thematic selection of infotainment is often linked with issues that are most\nlikely to impact viewers and increase visual spectacle (Stark, 1997). Our study is con-\ncerned with assessing the treatment of infotainment in both hard news and soft news\ntopics. Most studies tend to classify hard news as news that contains information on\npublic policy while soft news is often connected to news that are `more sensational,\npersonality-centered, less time-bound and more incident based than other news' (Patter-\nson, 2000: 4). For hard and soft news topics, we use eight different news sections con-\nveyed in our TV news sample. Hard news topics include categories of `foreign news'\nforeign news consists of news on politics and economy of foreign countries. Soft news\ntopics include `society/culture/arts' (15.6%), `accidents/catastrophes/crime' (15.2%),\n`war news/protests' (1.1%), `Sports' (5.5%), and `Weather' (0.5%). Table 2 presents the\nnumber of news stories of the six TV news programs during the period analyzed.\nDependent variables. The audiovisual narrative categories proposed in our analysis were\nderived from the theoretical framework mentioned before. They were operationalized to\nexamine the technical characteristics of infotainment in television news (Gonzalo et al.,\n2014). Following others, we pay special attention to audiovisual effects in TV news pro-\nduction and define the different resources that contribute to the spectacularization of\ninformation. Among these technical features, the most relevant ones for our topic of\ninquiry refer to recoding styles that privilege movement, the use of music, camera shots,\npost-production effects, editing of images, and profusion of transitions. Following\nthese studies, we coded six distinctive technical elements that indicate the use of\ninfotainment.\nType of image.It was defined by the presence of stock news images (M=0.04,\nShot length.This variable was measured as the number of close-ups (M=0.65,\nCamera movement techniques.These variables were defined by the presence of\nForms of transition.The number of transitions were counted, which were measured\nTable 2.

Montages techniques were defined by the\nAudio expression.Audio expression was defined by the presence of music (M=0.08,\nControl variables. It is very likely that the amount of technical characteristics of infotain-\nment is higher in longer news reports, than in shorter news reports (i.e. as we count the\namount of technical features, in long news reports, the likelihood the program uses dif-\nferent technical features is higher, because there is simply more time to use them). For\nthat reason, in our analysis, by using the variable time, we will control for the length of\nResults\nFirst, we examined the extent to which there are differences in technical characteristics\nof infotainment in television news across countries and between public and commercial\nbroadcasting programs using descriptive analyses. Results show that some features were\nfrequently present, for instance the use of analytics (91.4%) and pannings (71.0%) were\non average very popular. Other features were less popular, for instance the use of wipes\n(1.9%), stock (4.1%), and fades (4.1%). This indicates that the use of technical character-\nistics of infotainment generally differs. Some features are overly present in the news\nprograms that we included, while other technical features are not often included (see\nTable 3 for more detailed description per country and broadcasting system).\nInterestingly, following our expectations, we found differences across countries. We\nwant to refer to a few interesting findings. By using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with\nBonferroni post-hoc tests, we found that, in general, the handheld and stock images fea-\ntures were more often present in Spain than in Ireland (both p<.01) and the Netherlands\n(both p<.01). In addition, the use of dissolves was less often present in the Netherlands\nthan in Spain (p<.01) and Ireland (p<.01). The use of metrics was more often present in\nthe Netherlands than in Spain (p<.01) and Ireland (p<.01). Also the use of comparison\nwas more often present in the Netherlands and the least present in Ireland (all p<.01).\nBecause these descriptive analyses show that more differences were found for the\nNetherlands compared to the two other countries, we will use the Netherlands as our\ngeneral reference category in the next analyses.\nTo examine the use of technical features that characterize infotainment accurately, we\nconducted a logistic regression analysis with the technological features as dependent vari-\nables. Country dummies, a public/private broadcasting variable, and the news section\nwere used as predictor variables. Additionally, we include the length of the news items as\na control variable (see Table 4). In regards to our first hypothesis, we found that the pro-\ngrams in the Netherlands contained less technical infotainment features than those in\nIreland and Spain. More precisely, we found that zoomshots, handhelds, pannings,\ndissolves, analytics, and music were more often present in Ireland and Spain, than in the\nNetherlands (all p<.05). In addition, fades were also more often present in Spanish and\nIrish news (respectively, p<.01 and p=.06), than in Dutch news. Stock news images were\nmore often included in Spanish news than in Irish news (p<.01). Surprisingly, we found\nthat some narrative structure or montage techniques were not often present in the\nNetherlands compared to Spain and Ireland. Especially the use of metrics was less popular\nin Spain and Ireland, in contrast to the Netherlands (all p<.01). The use of comparison\nwas less often present in Ireland (p<.01) and the use of collision was not often included\nin Spain (p<.05), compared to the Netherlands. When we used Spain as a reference cat-\negory in the logistic analyses, we found that Spanish news contained significantly more\nTable 3.

This means that we found no clear evidence for hypothesis 1.\nFurthermore, we examined the role of public and commercial broadcasting in the use\nof technical infotainment features. Following our expectations, we found that commer-\ncial news broadcasts use more audiovisual infotainment techniques in their stories than\npublic news broadcasts in the three countries. More precisely, close-ups, handhelds, pan-\nning, analytics, and comparisons were more often used in commercial than in public\nbroadcasting programs (all p<.05). Thus, we found support for hypothesis 2.\nFinally, we examined the role of news section in explaining why some technological\nfeatures were used more often in one section, compared to another. In general, we found\nthat the use of technical characteristics of infotainment in specific news sections is dif-\nficult to predict (see Table 4). The evidence is less clear-cut then for the countries and\nbroadcasting type. For foreign news, handhelds (p=.01) and comparisons (p=.01) are\nmore often used compared to political news. Economic news included less dissolves\n(p=.01), but more stock news images (p=.01) compared to political news. Societal news\ncontained more close-ups, pannings, comparisons, and music (all p<.05) in contrast to\npolitical news. Crime news contains less dissolves (p=.01) than political news. Finally,\nsports news contained more pannings, cranes (booms), comparisons, and music than\npolitical news (all p<.05). These findings indicate that in hard news sections (such as\npolitical news, foreign and economic news), technical features of infotainment are used,\nbut evidence is not clear-cut, as some features are overly present while others are not.\nTherefore, we do not find support for hypothesis 3.\nConclusion\nThe current study draws on a vast and relevant literature on infotainment research to\nassess the presence of different audiovisual techniques, previously used as indicators of\nthe phenomenon in private and public news broadcasts of Spain, the Netherlands, and\nIreland. By using extensive content analyses of television news in the three different\ncountries, we expected to find more infotainment in the Dutch and Irish broadcast sam-\nple as they are driven by a stronger inclination towards market funds. However, we found\nthat Spain and Ireland included much more technical features or characteristics of info-\ntainment in television news compared to the Netherlands. There are two very likely\nexplanations for these results. First, the strong economic crisis in Spain and Ireland \u00ad\nbetween 2008 and 2009 - had an impact on media, and broadcasting in particular, with a\ndecrease of advertising revenues (Medina and Ojer, 2010). The severe consequences of\nthe economic downturn for media organizations in the two countries may justify the\nincrement of more infotainment features in their news programming, mainly in commer-\ncial broadcasts.\nSecond, many scholars argue that the presence of a strong public broadcasting service\nis a factor that affects the dominance of market forces (Cushion, 2012; Rafter et al.,\n2014). In the case of RTVE in Spain, the identity of the public broadcasting system is not\nso strong, and that was one of the main reasons why the Spanish government decided to\nnationalize the public system (Medina and Ojer, 2010). Although public news broadcasts\nin Spain are entirely funded by the government, it is still possible to see significant traces\nAlencar and Kruikemeier 15\nof infotainment in their TV news items, as they want to follow their commercial counter-\nparts and provide the same attractive news styles mixed with entertainment (Gonzalo\nConsequently, as we expected, we found that the use of infotainment techniques is\nmore often present in commercial (or private) broadcasting, than in public broadcasting.\nDifferences between both types of television stations can therefore be explained not only\nby economic factors but also by political forces regulating different broadcast ownership\nin each nation. Aside from the economic\u00adfinancial crisis, a shift in the governance of\npublic corporation has generated more competition for advertisement among commer-\ncial media organizations and foreign commercial channels in Spain. This policy change\nsuggests one possible explanation for the increasing integration of infotainment features\nin the news contents of private domestic television news editions in Spain.\nIn the Netherlands and Ireland, the fact that commercial broadcasting services com-\npete directly with public broadcasting for adverting as their sole source of income is\nclosely related with greater use of infotainment techniques in their news programming\n(Vettehen et al., 2011). Due to the competitive market of television channels in Ireland\nand the Netherlands, the presence of infotainment in public service broadcasts does not\nfall short when compared to private channels in the two countries. This finding corrobo-\nrates with others (Vettehen et al., 2011) who argue that Dutch public broadcasts have\ninvested in the creation of attractive news offers that could compete with that of the pri-\nvate networks, by increasing the amount of infotainment characteristics in their stories.\nFinally, we expected a greater use of audiovisual narrative features in soft news than in\nhard news topics. The results point, however, to other findings. Although we found that\nsome technical features of infotainment were more present in soft news topics, such as\nsocietal news, crime news, and sports news, the evidence is less clear-cut, as our findings\nindicate that in some cases economic news can also contain more technical infotainment\nfeatures than political news. Thus, the findings indicate no clear pattern of the use of info-\ntainment techniques across news topics as coded in this study. The findings are largely in\nline with a multi-dimensional approach to defining the different types of news (Baum,\n2003; Graber, 1994), in which the topic dimension is not sufficient to conceptualize hard\nand soft news and a focus on the style dimensions can help shape relevant changes of the\nstructure of news with the introduction of infotainment. Future studies should look for\nways to develop a more integrated approach to the analysis of formal features in television\nnews in order to assess how different types of news are incorporating these features.\nOne of the main contributions of this study relies on the comparative approach to the\nanalysis of infotainment features in television news of three European countries.\nAlthough infotainment was generally present in TV news broadcasts of the sampling\ncountries, the results of our analysis showed specific patterns regarding the presence of\nindicators of infotainment in each country. Another important contribution concerns the\ndevelopment of a narrative approach to the analysis of infotainment, by exploring vari-\nous codes that have not been systematically explored in content analysis of television\nnews. The use of audiovisual narrative features in the news has increased and its impact\non news reporting about matters of political and social significance raises questions\nabout the quality of the news both from the perspective of who consumes and who pro-\nduces the news.\nSome limitations of this study need to be highlighted. First, further studies should be\nable to extend the sample period. The analysis of longer periods allows for investigating\nthe evolution of infotainment news in mainstream TV news channels of the three coun-\ntries. Investigating the use of different infotainment features in European news over time\ncan offer rich insights into the impact of the phenomenon on political knowledge and\npublic opinion. Second, this study is limited to the analysis of infotainment narratives in\nprime-time television news programs. Therefore, future studies should include a larger\nsample of news broadcast to examine the extent to which infotainment trends can be\nconfirmed across program types and media platforms.\nDespite these limitations, the methodological approach of the current study proposed\nhas taken a step forward to cross-cultural approaches to the analysis of infotainment\nfeatures in European television news. Moreover, a cross-national comparative analysis\ncan open new avenues for this line of research by assessing whether infotainment fea-\ntures continue to exert great influence on production patterns that characterize modern\nnews broadcasts in Europe.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/\nor publication of this article: This research received a grant from the European Commission in the\nframework of Marie Curie Actions (FP7 Call).

Although the public broadcasting system in Ireland relies on dual funding, news and\ncurrent affairs cannot receive funding from the government and have to rely entirely on\nadvertisement. However, the identity of the Irish public broadcaster is still very strong,\nwhich might prevent the use of infotainment in their production of news (Rafter et al.,\nReferences\nAltheide DL (2004) Media logic and political communication.
