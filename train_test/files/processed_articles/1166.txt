There is also a strong social patterning of obesity and\noverweight, with a higher prevalence among women, racial/ethnic\nminorities and those from a lower socio-economic position (SEP).\nMost of the existing work in this area, however, is based on cross-\nsectional data or single cohort studies. No national studies to date\nhave examined how social disparities in obesity and overweight differ\nby age and historical period using longitudinal data with repeated\nmeasures.\nMethods We used panel data from the nationally representative Monitoring\ntrajectories of body mass index (BMI) over adulthood (age 18\u00ad45).\nSelf-reported height and weight were collected in this annual US\nsurvey of high-school seniors, followed biennially since 1976. Using\ngrowth curve models, we analysed BMI trajectories over adulthood\nby gender, race/ethnicity and lifetime SEP (measured by parents'\neducation and respondent's education).\nResults BMI trajectories exhibit a curvilinear rate of change from age 18 to\n45, but there was a strong period effect, such that weight gain was\nmore rapid for more recent cohorts. As a result, successive cohorts\nbecome overweight (BMI425) at increasingly earlier points in the\nlife course. BMI scores were also consistently higher for women,\nracial/ethnic minority groups and those from a lower SEP. However,\nBMI scores for socially advantaged groups in recent cohorts were\nactually higher than those for their socially disadvantaged counter-\nparts who were born 10 years earlier.\nConclusions Results highlight the importance of social status and socio-\neconomic resources for maintaining optimal weight.

Data\nfrom national surveys paint a consistent picture\nwhere women, individuals of lower socio-economic\nposition (SEP) and minority racial/ethnic groups have\nThis is consistent with the argument that social\ndisadvantage is a `fundamental cause'24,25 of obesity\nand overweight. People with more knowledge, money,\npower, prestige and beneficial social connections are\nbetter able to control weight gain, either through the\nability to make healthy food choices26,27 (by having\ngreater awareness of, access to, and resources to\npurchase healthy foods), or through greater opportu-\nnities for exercise, and safe play.28,29\nHowever, much of the literature on social disparities\nin obesity is based on data from repeated cross-\nsectional surveys1,4,6 or from single cohort stud-\nies.3,30,31 As a result, it is difficult to determine\nwhether patterns of weight gain over the life course\nrepresent true age effects or simply age differences in\nthe characteristics of cross-sectional samples over\ntime. Given the rapid secular changes that have\nbeen occurring in obesity prevalence, social disparities\nin trajectories of weight gain are likely to vary across\nhistorical time. The timing of birth exposes each\ngeneration or cohort to a particular window in\nhistorical time with its own unique set of social and\nenvironmental constraints and opportunities.32\u00ad34\nSocial patterns of weight gain are therefore inextric-\nably linked to the social and cultural conditions of the\nlarger society in which they are embedded across\ntime. Longitudinal data with repeated measures are\nneeded to identify how social disparities in obesity\nand overweight differ by age and historical period.\nWe use nationally representative panel data from\nthe Monitoring the Future Study (MTF) in the United\nStates to examine social disparities in adult trajec-\nThe MTF study is ideally suited to examine the recent\nupsurge in obesity and overweight among Americans\ncohorts followed prospectively over adulthood (age\n18\u00ad45), it is possible to simultaneously study indivi-\ndual weight change as well as period shifts in BMI\nover time. We hypothesize that BMI scores are\npositively associated with both age and historical\ntime, such that BMI trajectories will become increas-\ningly steep in more-recent time periods. We also\nhypothesize that BMI is inversely related to social and\neconomic advantage, such that, within each cohort,\nadult BMI trajectories will be steeper for socially\ndisadvantaged subgroups (i.e. women, racial/ethnic\nminorities and individuals of lower SEP).\nMethods\nData\nData are drawn from the MTF project, a nation-wide\nschool-based survey conducted annually in the United\nmore detail elsewhere)36 involves a nationally repre-\nsentative sample of high-school seniors (age 18)\nyear). For the panel component, a 16% representative\nsubsample ($2400 students per year) was randomly\nselected from each cohort for six biennial follow-ups\n(to the age of 30), and then at 5-year intervals to the\nage of 45, using self-completed mailed questionnaires.\nAll procedures are reviewed and approved on an\nannual basis by the University of Michigan's\nInstitutional Review Board (IRB) for compliance\nwith federal guidelines for the treatment of human\nsubjects.\nTo ease respondent burden in the MTF panel study,\nmultiple forms are used, with some questions\nappearing on only some of the forms. Since 1986\na random one-sixth of respondents received forms\nasking about height and weight. Thus, the final\nsample available for this analysis consists of 10 956\n2004. (Sample sizes for each high-school cohort\naverage 345 persons with up to nine observations\nper person.)\nSince subjects are selected in their senior year, the\nsurvey does not include high-school dropouts.35 Drug\nusers were oversampled for participation in the panel\nsurvey by a ratio of 3:1 (and then re-weighted for\nanalyses to reflect population estimates, as discussed\nbelow). Student response rates in their senior year\naverage 82.7%. Retention rates in the panel respon-\ndents are highest in the first follow-up after high\nschool (averaging 70% of the original cohort), and fall\nto an average of 64% in the biennial follow-ups\nthrough to age 32. Longer-term retention rates\nage 45.35 Using logistic regression analysis (with\nbackward elimination) we modelled the probability\nof participation at each wave according to a broad\narray of baseline socio-demographic characteristics\nthat could potentially influence study retention. Five\nvariables consistently predicted participation at each\nwave: female, White, coming from a two-parent\nfamily, enrolment in an academic high school and\nnot living in the southern region of the US at base-\nline. By deriving the predicted probability of parti-\ncipation from these five variables, each observation at\neach wave of data collection was weighted to account\nfor attrition (losses to follow-up as well as survey\nnon-response) based on the inverse probability of\nparticipation. Using this weight in our models\nresulted in only trivial differences in the coefficients\nin our results, ruling out the possibility that losses\ndue to attrition substantially bias our results.\nMeasures\nWe capture weight gain over adulthood with the BMI\n(BMI \u00bc kg/m2). Height was self-reported in inches\n(converted to metres for these analyses), and weight\nin pounds (converted to kilograms). Item non-\nresponse for height and weight was small in this\npanel survey, ranging from <1% (0.7%) to 2.3% over\nthe follow-up period. A BMI of 25 or higher is used to\ndefine `overweight'.37 BMI scores were excluded for\npregnant women.\nWe focus on three key social indicators: (i) gender;\n(ii) race/ethnicity; and (iii) lifetime SEP. Female is a\ndummy variable coded 1 for females and 0 for males.\nRace/ethnicity is represented by four dummy vari-\nables: White, Black, Hispanic and other racial/ethnic\ngroup (includes Asians and Native Americans).\nConsistent with a life-course perspective we include\nSEP both in childhood and in adulthood. Childhood\nSEP is the maximum of the respondent's parents'\neducation (less than high school, high-school\ndiploma, college degree or higher). Adult SEP is a\ntime-varying measure of completed education at each\nfollow-up (high-school diploma, college degree or\nhigher). [More sophisticated coding (differentiating\nassociate's degree, bachelor's degree or graduate\ndegree) did not yield differences in intercepts or\nslopes in the growth model]. In order to capture\nincreases in socio-economic resources afforded by\nmarriage, we take the maximum of the respondent's\nand spouse's education for those who were married at\neach follow-up. Although SEP can also be measured\nby income and occupation, social disparities in obesity\nhave typically been observed by educational levels and\nless consistently by income.4 As a result, we focus on\neducational attainment over the life course as our\nmeasure of SEP.\nStatistical analyses\nGrowth curve models38 were used to examine\ntrajectories of BMI over adulthood. Growth curve\nmodels belong to a general class of mixed models that\ntake into consideration the clustering of observations\nwithin persons and also have the capacity to handle\nunbalanced designs (inconsistent number of observa-\ntions per person).39 A two-level linear model was\nanalysed, with multiple observations nested within\npersons over time (adulthood). Age was used as the\nindicator of time. In order to facilitate parameter\ninterpretation, we centred age at the initial point of\ndata collection (age 18).\nThe structure of this model can be expressed by equa-\ntions at two levels. At level 1 (within-person model)\nBMI scores at time t are nested within individuals (i):\n\u00f0 \u00deti\n\u00ferti\nis the expected BMI score for person i at\nage 18 (since age is centred), 1i captures the rate of\nchange in BMI over the life course, and rti is the\nwithin-person residual (that part of an individual's\nBMI at time t not predicted by age).\nTo incorporate period effects we also include the year\nof data collection as a time-varying variable, again\ncentred on the initial year that BMI data were collected\n(1986). This allows us to examine period shifts in BMI\nacross all ages. (Cohort effects integrate age and period\neffects by capturing variations in BMI across groups of\nindividuals in the same high-school year as they age. We\ndo not focus on cohort effects in this paper. Rather, we\nexamine period differences in age patterns of BMI over\nadulthood.) We examine how adult trajectory slopes\nvary across historical time by modelling interactions\nbetween the age and year variables:\n\u00ferti\nThe level-1 parameters are then modelled as a\nfunction of individual characteristics (at level two).\nThe level two (between person) submodel assumes\nthat BMI trajectories vary across individuals, and we\nexplicitly model these differences as follows:\n\u00f0female\u00dei\n\u00f0female\u00dei\nHere, for example, the intercept and age slope from\nequation (1) are modelled as a function of gender,\nwhere 01 represents the difference in the initial BMI\nscore for females compared with males, and 11\ncaptures the difference in the rate of change in BMI\nover adulthood for women compared with men. (We\nalso modelled person-level differences in the slope for\nyear, but found no effects.) The residual errors\n; e2i) capture random variance in the intercept\nand slope values across persons, which we attempt\nto capture through the incorporation of additional\nperson-level variables. (Due to model limitations on\nthe number of estimated variance components, we set\nthe random variance for the age by year term to zero.)\nSubstituting equations (2.1) through (2.4) into\nequation (1) gives us the full composite model:\n\u00f0female\u00dei\n\u00fe\n\u00f0female\u00dei\n\u00fe\n\u00fe\n\u00fe rti\nWe used the MIXED procedure in SAS to estimate\nall models using full maximum likelihood, assuming\nnormally distributed residuals. (The distribution of the\nresiduals showed a good approximation to normality,\nwith little deviation from the diagonal in the normal\nprobability plots.) All analyses were weighted to correct\nfor the oversampling of drug users in the panel data.\nNested models were compared according to three\ngoodness-of-fit indices: (i) change in the \u00c02 log like-\nlihood (or deviance statistic), which follows a 2\ndistribution with degrees of freedom equal to the\ndifference in the number of parameters tested between\nmodels; (ii) change in the Bayesian Information\nCriterion (BIC), which makes an adjustment for\nmodel parsimony;40 and (iii) proportion of variance in\nBMI that is explained by a model (pseudo R2),\ncalculated by squaring the correlation between the\nobserved and predicted BMI values.\nResults\nDescriptive statistics\nThe individuals in this study were born between 1958\nSocio-demographic characteristics for the study\nsample at baseline (age 18) are presented in\nTable 1. Approximately one-quarter (26.2%) went on\nto receive a college degree over the follow-up period.\nTable 2 presents the weighted mean BMI scores for\nthe study sample over adulthood. Three specific high-\nschool cohorts are illustrated. Mean BMI scores\nincrease over adulthood, but at any given age BMI\nscores are higher in more recent cohorts.\nUnconditional growth model\nThe first column in Table 3 (Model A) presents the\nresults for the unconditional growth model without\nany person-level covariates. The value for the inter-\ncept (22.4) represents the average BMI score at age\n18. The coefficients for age express the average rate\nof change in BMI over adulthood. A second-order\npolynomial indicates that BMI scores increase steadily\nover young adulthood and then begin to flatten out\ntowards midlife, as illustrated in Figure 1. After\nincorporating the effects of age, variation in BMI\nremains both within persons and between persons\n(variance components), and additional person-level\nvariables may explain this variation. Note that ageing\nitself explains about 6.5% of the total variance in BMI\nscores.\nIncorporating period effects\nThe second column of Table 3 (Model B) incorporates\nthe period effect. The positive coefficient for year\nindicates that BMI scores have increased linearly since\nsince 1986. BMI trajectories were then allowed to vary\nby historical time by including interactions between\nage and the year of data collection (Model C in\nTable 3). Compared with the model including only\nage, the inclusion of secular time results in an\nimprovement in model fit and accounts for about\n34% of the residual variation between individual\nand historical time explain about 8% of the total\nvariation in BMI scores.\nA visual depiction of this age and period effect is\npresented in Figure 2. For simplicity, only three\nspecific high-school cohorts are illustrated. Members\nof the earliest cohort (born in 1958) were high-school\nseniors in 1976. Although height and weight data are\nnot available for this cohort until the age of 28\n(in 1986), the BMI trajectory for this group exhibits a\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics for adults in study sample at\nN\nWeighted\npercent\nRace/Ethnicity\nChildhood SEPb\nParents with college degree\nor higher\nRegion of residence\naBaseline refers to senior year of high school.\nbSEP, socioeconomic position (assessed by parents' education).\nTable 2 Mean BMI scores (\u00c6 SD) for high school cohorts\nn/a \u00bc Not available.\ngradual increase over adulthood. However, for each\nsuccessive cohort, BMI scores are higher and the early\nadult BMI trajectory becomes increasingly steep. As\na result, successive cohorts become `overweight'\n(BMI425) at increasingly earlier points in the life\ncourse.\nExamining social disparities\nThe models in Table 4 examine social disparities in\nadult BMI trajectories over time. As a reference point,\nthe first column in Table 4 replicates the coefficients\nfrom Model C in Table 3.\nDisparities by gender and race/ethnicity\nThe second and third columns of Table 4 add the\neffects of gender and race/ethnicity to the age and\nperiod effect model. Females and racial/ethnic\nminority groups are at greater risk of weight gain\nover the adult life course than white males (Model C).\n(There were no statistical interactions between any of\nthe socio-demographic characteristics and the period\neffect). However, since 1986 there has been a\nconvergence in BMI scores by racial/ethnic groups\nacross cohorts. Figure 3 illustrates racial differences in\nBMI trajectories across the same three high-school\ncohorts depicted in Figure 2, but for simplicity we\nplot trajectories for women only since there are no\ndifferences in the BMI trajectories between Whites\nand other race/ethnic groups and between Blacks and\nHispanics (Table 4, Model C), predicted BMI trajec-\ntories are only plotted for Whites and Blacks for\nillustrative purposes.\nAs illustrated in Figure 3, BMI scores are con-\nsistently higher across adulthood for racial/ethnic\nminority groups than for whites. However, over\ntime the BMI trajectories for whites tend to track\nthose for Blacks from earlier cohorts. For example,\nBMI scores for white women in the class of 1986\ntend to approach those of black women in the 1976\ncohort over the equivalent age range (age 28\u00ad36,\nFigure 3). Similarly, early adult BMI scores for white\nwomen in the 1996 cohort track closely those for\nBlack women who graduated from high school 10\nyears earlier.\nDisparities by lifetime SEP\nThe fourth column of Table 4 (Model D) adds\nchildhood SEP to the model. Consistent with a\nlife-course perspective on health disparities, higher\nSEP in childhood is protective of weight gain both at\nthe age of 18 and over adulthood. Individuals who\nhave a background of lower SEP in childhood\n(parents with less than college degree) have a\nhigher BMI at age 18 (initial status) and also have\nAge effect\nModel A\nPeriod effect\nModel B\nAge + period effect\nModel C\nFixed effects\nInitial Status\nRate of change\nVariance components\nGoodness-of-fit statistics\nStandard errors are in parentheses under the parameter estimates.\nhigher rates of annual growth in BMI over adulthood\nthan those whose parents had a college degree.\nChildhood SEP accounts for only a small part of the\neffect of racial/ethnic disadvantage [largely for\nHispanics, see Table 4 (Model D)], indicating that\nthere are other factors associated with racial/ethnic\nposition that carry an increased risk for higher BMI\nthat are not simply a function of SEP at birth.\nHowever, because of the period effect, even white\nmales from a high SEP have been gaining weight\nmore rapidly over adulthood in more-recent cohorts.\nFigure 4 illustrates BMI trajectories for white males in\nthe three separate high-school cohorts according to\nchildhood SEP. While BMI scores are consistently\nhigher in each cohort amongst those with lower\nchildhood SEP (parents with less than a high-school\neducation), at each age BMI scores for socially\nadvantaged groups in later cohorts are actually\nhigher than those for their socially disadvantaged\ncounterparts who were born 10 years earlier.\nThe protective effects of adult SEP over the life\ncourse are weaker than for childhood SEP (Table 4,\nModel E). High-school seniors who go on to receive\na college degree have somewhat flatter BMI trajec-\ntories over adulthood than their classmates who did\nnot pursue further education. However, achieved SEP\nin adulthood does not fully mediate the lingering\neffects of childhood SEP. Model E simultaneously\nadjusts for adult SEP and examines the residual\neffect of childhood SEP on BMI after accounting for\nthe mediating effects of adult SEP. Thus, social\ndisadvantage in childhood carries a persisting risk\nfor increased BMI throughout the life course. (There\nwere no statistical interaction effects between gender\nand adult SEP, race and adult SEP or between\nchildhood SEP and adult SEP.) Together, these\nsocio-demographic characteristics, along with ageing\nand historical time, explain over 12% of the total\nvariation in BMI scores over adulthood (final model\nDiscussion\nWe use 19 years of nationally representative panel\ndata for repeated cohorts of Americans to describe\nadult trajectories of BMI since 1986. We found that,\nnot only do BMI scores follow a curvilinear course\nover adulthood, but there has also been a linear\nincrease in adult BMI trajectories over historical\ntime. Thus, historical conditions have differentially\naffected adult trajectories of weight gain since the\nmid-1980s. As a result, one's BMI later in adulthood\nmay have less to do with one's age than with\nhistorical changes in social, environmental and\ncultural conditions that significantly influence caloric\nWe also found evidence of a `social patterning'45 in\nadult trajectories of BMI. Weight gain over adulthood\nis more rapid for disadvantaged social groups,\nincluding women, racial/ethnic minorities and those\nof lower SEP. As a result, social disparities in BMI\nbecome increasingly more pronounced over the adult\nlife course, which has ominous implications for future\nhealth disparities among these cohorts as they age.\nTargeted interventions towards these groups,46\u00ad48\nparticularly early in the life course,49,50 remain an\nimportant and worthwhile strategy.\nHowever, BMI scores have also been rising steadily\nin socially advantaged groups since 1986. Even white\nmales in a high SEP are at an increased risk for\nweight gain at any given age over time. This has\nimplications for preventive strategies. If the rise in\nobesity, as a public health concern, is approached\nfrom a `fundamental cause' perspective,24 weight gain\nis assumed to be the result of restricted access to\nhealth-enhancing knowledge and resources among\ndisadvantaged social groups. But our results indicate\nthat another strategy may need to be considered for\nthe prevention of obesity in the more advantaged\nsubgroups of society. These people presumably have\naccess to resources but are failing to use them\nAge\nBMI (kg/m2)\nFigure 2 Predicted trajectories of BMI by high-school\nAge\nBMI (kg/m2)\nFigure 1 Predicted trajectories of BMI over adulthood:\nTable 4 Growth models for BMI: fixed effect coefficients by gender, race/ethnicity and lifetime\nGrowth\nmodel + period\neffect + Gender\n+ Race/\nEthnicity\n+ Childhood\nSEP\n+ Adult\nSEP\nModel A Model B Model C Model D Model E\nFixed effects\nInitial status\nRate of change\n(continued)\neffectively. Similar findings are beginning to appear in\nthe literature, where social advantage does not confer\nthe expected protective effects against weight gain in\nAmerican adults.51\u00ad53 However, if these advantaged\nsocial groups begin adopting better nutrition and\nexercise behaviours afforded to them by their flexible\nsocial resources,25 we may observe a decline in their\nBMI trajectory over time, and this will only serve to\nmagnify the socio-economic gradient in obesity and\noverweight in future years.\nLimitations\nDue to the underestimation of weight in self-reported\ndata,54 BMI scores in this sample may be higher if\nweight were measured directly. However, because\nthere is no evidence of differential underreporting of\nweight in ethnic or racial minority groups, or by\ngender or SEP, the social patterns in BMI are not\nlikely to differ markedly from those reported here.\nBecause study subjects were selected in their senior\nyear of high school, high-school dropouts are not\nrepresented. Although panel attrition in the MTF data\nis nontrivial, statistically adjusting for attrition yielded\nno differences in the results. Because follow-up is\nongoing in this study, relatively fewer data points are\navailable for estimation at the tail end of the growth\nOur purpose in this paper was to describe social\ndisparities in BMI over adulthood as they change over\nhistorical time. The results highlight the importance\nof social status and socio-economic resources for\nmaintaining optimal weight. Yet, even those in\nadvantaged social positions, presumably with access\nto health-enhancing resources, have experienced an\nincrease in BMI in more recent cohorts. Thus,\npromoting access to resources and opportunities for\nhealthy eating and exercise may not be sufficient for\noverturning the obesity epidemic.\nTable 4 Continued\nGrowth\nmodel + period\neffect + Gender\n+ Race/\nEthnicity\n+ Childhood\nSEP\n+ Adult\nSEP\nModel A Model B Model C Model D Model E\nGoodness-of-fit statistics\nNote: Standard errors are in parentheses under the parameter estimates.\naReference group is male.\nbReference group is white.\ncReference group is parents with college degree.\ndReference group is college degree.\nSEP, socioeconomic position; HS, high school.\nFunding\nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation, as part of the\nYouth, Education, and Society Project; National\nInstitute on Drug Abuse, a part of the National\nInstitutes of Health; University of Michigan Center for\nSocial Inequality Mind and Body Life Course core\n[National Institutes of Health/National Institutes of\nChild Health and Human Development Grant\n"
