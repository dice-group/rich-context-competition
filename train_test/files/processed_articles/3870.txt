In practice, the\njaw is not only pulled forward by the fifth\nfinger but is also held in position by a\nbackward pull towards the upper jaw,\nwhich requires the operator's fingers to\nhave enough strength to maintain the\nairway. If the operator's hand becomes\nfatigued, which may particularly occur\nwhen the position is held for a long period\nof time or in obese patients, the airway may\nbecome partly obstructed, reducing the effi-\nciency of the ventilation. The main difficulty\nin keeping the airway unblocked in obese\npatients (or in difficult mask ventilation\nsituations) is maintaining the advancement\nof the mandible. To solve this problem, a\nchin-lift mask was devised; this customized,\nmanually adjustable intraoral appliance lifts\nthe tip of the jaw effectively and consistently.\nThe present study evaluated respiratory data\nobtained during anaesthesia induction using\nthe novel chin-lift mask, compared with an\noropharyngeal airway (OPA) with the EC-\nclamp technique.\nPatients and methods\nPeople with American Society of\nAnesthesiologists physical status I\u00adII and a\nbody mass index >30 who had cholecystitis\nand were scheduled for cholecystectomy\nunder general anaesthesia at the Tianjin\nUnion Medicine Centre, Tianjin, China,\nwere recruited sequentially to the study.\nPatients underwent physical assessments\nincluding history of snoring or sleep\napnoea, and other assessments to predict\nease of intubation. Patients with upper-\nairway abnormalities, facial hair, facial ana-\ntomical abnormalities, hiatus hernia, gastro-\noesophageal reflux, ischaemic or congenital\nheart disease, or severe acute or chronic lung\ndisease were excluded. After enrolment,\npatients were randomly assigned using a\ncomputerized random-number generator list\nto two groups: the OPA group, in which a\nstandard mask and OPA with the EC-clamp\ntechnique were used, and the CL group, in\nwhich the chin-lift mask was used.\nWritten informed consent was obtained\nfrom all study participants. The study proto-\ncol was approved by the Institutional\nReview Board of Tianjin Union Medicine\nCentre, Tianjin, China.\nAnaesthesia\nPatients fasted from midnight before the\noperation; no premedication was adminis-\ntered. After placement of routine monitor-\ning devices and capnography monitors, and\npreoxygenation with 100% oxygen for 3 min\nadministered via a standard mask in the\nOPA group and via the chin-lift mask in the\nCL group, anaesthesia was induced with\nkg fentanyl, 2 mg/kg propofol and 0.5 mg/kg\natracurium. A total fresh gas flow of 3 l/min\noxygen was delivered via the standard mask\nor the chin-lift mask. The ventilation par-\nameters were initially set at a tidal volume of\n10 ml/kg at a rate of 12 breaths/min. The\nadjustable pressure limiting valve was set at\nO. A standard circle circuit and 2-l\nbags were used.\nThe patient's position for induction\nwas supine, with the extremities resting\ncomfortably on padded surfaces in a neutral\nanatomical position. The head was rested\ncomfortably on a standard pillow that was\nraised in a `sniff' position. When the train-\nof-four count fell to <2, either an OPA and\nstandard mask was held in place using the\nEC-clamp technique or the chin-lift mask\nwas put in position. The latex-free chin-lift\nmask was designed for single use in adults,\nand is based on the standard mask. The\nchin-lift mask is constructed from polyvi-\nnylchloride approved by the International\nOrganization for Standardization (ISO\nnoncarcinogenic and generally well toler-\nated. At the bottom of the mask, there is a\nmatrix column with a J-shaped slide that\nholds a moveable insert (Figure 1A and 1B).\nThe straight section is 12.5 cm long and the\ncurved section is 5 cm long. The thickness of\nthe J-shaped slide is 2 mm. The radius of the\ncurved section is similar to that of a laryn-\ngoscope blade. The proximal end of the slide\ncontains 15 holes. When the slide is adjusted\nmaximally upwards, the tip of the slide\nreturns to the inside of the air cushion, so\nthe device can be used for both preoxygena-\ntion and provision of oxygen (Figure 1C).\nThe button at the front of the cylindrical\nmatrix column is pressed to adjust the length\nof the J-shaped slide until the tip of the slide\nmaximally lifts the jaw. The adjustable\nvertical range is 4 cm (Figure 1D). As soon\nas the operator releases the button, the\ninterior card slot in the matrix column is\nlocked into one of the slide holes and the tip\nof the J-shaped slide fits on the surface of the\noral mucosa of the lower jaw, so the chin is\nheld in a forward position relative to the\nstationary maxilla. This procedure takes\nFigure 1. The chin-lift mask: (A) front view, (B) side view, (C) slide adjusted maximally upwards, (D) slide\nadjusted minimally upwards.\n5\u00ad10 s. With the tip of the slide acting as a\nfulcrum, the operator places a thumb on the\ntop portion of the mask and the fingers on\nthe matrix column. The chin-lift mask\nallows the operator to lift the jaw upwards\nand simultaneously to extend the atlanto-\noccipital joint while applying enough down-\nward pressure to create an airtight seal\n(Figures 2 and 3). The dominant hand can\nthen ventilate the patient using a bag-valve\ndevice.\nThe same anaesthetist performed all the\ninduction procedures. He had been trained\nto use the chin-lift mask using mannequins\nprior to the study and had >10 years'\nclinical experience.\nAfter induction using the two types of\nmask, an endotracheal tube was inserted by\nan experienced anaesthesiologist.\nPatient assessment\nMean expired tidal volume (Vt), peak\ninspiratory pressure (PIP), mean inspiratory\npressure (MIP), tidal volume/peak inspira-\ntory pressure ratio (Vt/PIP), end-tidal\ncarbon dioxide (EtCO2\n) level and peripheral\noxygen saturation (Sp\n) were recorded\nduring anaesthesia induction. All data were\ncollected by a single observer,positioned in a\nmanner that was blinded to the type of mask\nbeing used.\nPatients with more than one of the\nfollowing criteria were defined as experien-\ncing difficult mask ventilation: (1) inability\nto maintain an Sp\ngas leakage beneath the face mask; (3) need\nto increase the gas flow to >6 l/min; (4) no\nperceptible chest movement; (5) two-handed\nmask ventilation requiring assistance by an\nanaesthesiologist; (6) more than two oxygen\nflushes needed.6 A reduction in Sp\nto\n<95% was considered to be a failure of\nventilation; in these circumstances, the study\ncould be terminated, a potential effective\nalternative to the `four hand/two person\nskill' was provided or immediate tracheal\nintubation was performed. This Sp\nthreshold was chosen because the more\nusual threshold of 90% might have posed\nan unacceptable risk in obese patients.\nStatistical analyses\nAll numerical data were presented as\nmean \u00c6 SD and were compared using\nFigure 2.

Assuming a 100 ml\nVt difference between the groups and a\nstandard deviation of 100 ml, a study\ngroup size of 50 individuals was calculated\nto be necessary to achieve a significant\ndifference between the groups with a power\nof 0.9.7 All statistical analyses were per-\nformed using SPSS\u00d5 software, version 15.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\nResults\n(14 female; 86 male) were included in this\nstudy, of whom 50 were assigned to the OPA\ngroup and 50 to the CL group.

The chin-lift mask\nprovided more effective ventilation than an\nOPA plus EC-clamp technique.

In\ncontrast, no cases of difficult mask ventila-\ntion occurred in the CL group. No airway\ninjuries (such as lip laceration or haema-\ntoma, dental injury, tongue laceration, pha-\nryngeal laceration or laryngeal laceration)\nwere observed in either group. No patients\nexperienced vomiting or aspiration.\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, the chin-lift mask\noffered advantages in most technical aspects\nof airway management in obese patients.\nThe chin-lift mask effectively lifted the jaw,\nproduced a patent airway and helped the\noperator successfully perform one-handed\nbag mask ventilation during the induction of\nanaesthesia.\nAdequate mask ventilation is an import-\nant component of patient safety dur-\ning induction of general anaesthesia.\nAnaesthesia reduces airway muscle tone\nand increases the collapsibility of the pha-\nryngeal structures, thereby causing airway\nobstruction.8 Obese patients may present\nwith difficult airways, and are more likely to\ndesaturate than lean people.9,10 Retraction\nof the mandible may contribute to the\nreduced airway size seen during anaesthe-\nsia.11 Studies have demonstrated that\nmanual anterior displacement of the man-\ndible (using techniques such as the chin-lift\nmanoeuvre) can dilate and stiffen the pha-\nryngeal airway.12,13 The chin-lift manoeuvre\nis a complex technique that requires consid-\nerable skill: the left hand lifts the chin and\nmaintains head extension while generating\nthe mask seal.14,15 This technique can be\neffective in elevating the hyoid and epiglot-\ntis, thereby increasing the exposure of the\nlaryngeal aperture and to some extent\nincreasing its size, especially in the absence\nof tone in the geniohyoid and genioglossus\nmuscles when a neuromuscular blocking\ndrug has been administered.16 The man-\noeuvre enlarges both the laryngeal inlet and\nthe pharynx. The chin-lift mask investigated\nin the present study was designed to emulate\nthe chin-lift manoeuvre. This novel method\nwas associated with a lower PIP, a higher Vt\nand Sp\nand less frequent difficult mask\nventilation compared with an OPA with the\nEC-clamp technique. This suggests that\nlifting the jaw upward enabled fresh gas to\nbe delivered with less upper airway obstruc-\ntion. Because of its simplicity of use and\nefficiency, the chin-lift face mask may help\nto prevent poor oxygenation and to\nTable 2.

The EC-\nclamp technique requires that the operator's\nfingers are strong enough to maintain man-\ndible advancement, which can easily lead to\nhand fatigue, especially in obese patients. In\naddition, this manoeuvre requires forceful\npressure on the patient's face with the tips of\nthe third, fourth and fifth fingers, which\noften causes redness and painful pressure\npoints. One advantage of the chin-lift mask\nis that it allows the anaesthetist to achieve an\neffective seal and easy ventilation for a range\nof patient facial types. The tip of the\nJ-shaped slide lifts the tip of the jaw, whereas\nthe thumb controls the posterior part of the\nmask so that the air cushion closely fits the\npatient's face to prevent leakage. Head\nextension is maintained by the torque\nbetween the tip of the slide and the pressure\non the posterior part of the mask. Mouth\nopening, which is a component of the airway\nmanoeuvres required for the improvement\nof upper airway patency, is automatically\nachieved by the intraoral slide of the chin-lift\nmask. Furthermore, by elevating the tip of\nthe jaw as in the single-hand chin-lift man-\noeuvre, the chin-lift mask helps to manage\nan unprotected airway by `giving an add-\nitional hand'. An OPA elevates the hyoid or\nepiglottis and displaces the tongue, thereby\nproducing a fixed-calibre channel in the\nretroglossal and supraglossal portions of\nthe airway. However, insertion of an OPA\nis not a benign procedure. The airway can\npush the tongue posterior and further\nobstruct the oropharynx if not inserted\ncorrectly. Substantial lacerations can occur\nif the lips or tongue are caught between the\nteeth and the oral airway. The airway can\nforce the epiglottis closed against the vocal\ncords if it is too long, resulting in com-\nplete airway obstruction.17 Too small an\nairway will force the tongue against the\npharynx, also producing an obstruction.18\nThe J-shaped slide of the chin-lift mask has\nan adjustable vertical range of 4 cm and\ntherefore does not invade the laryngeal\ncavity. In the present study, improved ven-\ntilation resulting in higher Vt, lower PIP and\nMIP and higher Sp\nvalues was observed in\nthe CL group compared with the OPA\ngroup.\nThe limitations of the present study\nshould be considered when interpreting the\nresults. First, the study could not be per-\nformed with the anaesthetist blinded to the\nmask used because of the obvious appear-\nance of the chin-lift mask; hence a bias could\nnot be excluded. Bias was minimized by the\nuse of a blinded observer to collect the data.\nSecondly, the mask was not evaluated in\nconscious patients. In the present study,\npatients were ventilated under controlled\nconditions in the operating room, which\noffered ideal conditions for airway manage-\nment. However, patients who require emer-\ngency airway control often have intact\nreflexes, so the results cannot be extrapo-\nlated to emergency settings. Thirdly, to\nminimize operator bias, the same male\nanaesthetist performed all the procedures.\nIt has been reported that sex is an independ-\nent risk factor for difficult mask ventila-\ntion.19 Hand size may confound the ability\nof operators to generate and maintain a\nmask seal using type of mask. Koga and\nKawamoto19 reported that men had a larger\nhand size and were able to provide higher\ntidal volumes than women using both of the\nmethods tested. Fourthly, although we did\nnot observe any adverse effects associated\nwith use of the chin-lift mask in this small\ncohort of patients, it is possible that prob-\nlems may arise in a wider population or if\nthe novel method was used for a prolonged\nperiod.\nIn summary, the present study demon-\nstrated that mask ventilation performed in\nanaesthetized and paralysed obese patients\nwas of better quality with the novel chin-lift\nmask than with an OPA using the EC-clamp\ntechnique. These results suggest that the\nchin-lift mask could be considered as an\nalternative to a standard mask plus OPA\nwith EC-clamp technique to maintain\nairway patency in obese patients. The role\nof this intraoral mask for upper airway\nmanagement during deep sedation, posta-\nnaesthesia care and general anaesthetic\ninduction requires further evaluation.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\n"
