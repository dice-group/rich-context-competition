One consequence of inactivity, low cardiorespiratory fitness, is an established\nrisk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality, but the preva-\nlence of cardiorespiratory fitness has not been quantified in representative US popu-\nlation samples.\nObjectives To describe the prevalence of low fitness in the US population aged 12\nthrough 49 years and to relate low fitness to CVD risk factors in this population.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants Inception cohort study using data from the cross-\nsectional nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nmal graded exercise treadmill testing to achieve at least 75% to 90% of their age-\npredicted maximum heart rate. Maximal oxygen consumption (V\nmax) was esti-\nmated by measuring the heart rate response to reference levels of submaximal work.\nMain Outcome Measures Low fitness defined using percentile cut points of es-\ntimated V\nmax from existing external referent populations; anthropometric and other\nCVD risk factors measured according to standard methods.\nResults Low fitness was identified in 33.6% of adolescents (approximately 7.5 mil-\nlion US adolescents) and 13.9% of adults (approximately 8.5 million US adults); the\nprevalence was similar in adolescent females (34.4%) and males (32.9%) (P=.40) but\nblacks and Mexican Americans were less fit than non-Hispanic whites. In all age-sex\ngroups, body mass index and waist circumference were inversely associated with fit-\nness; age- and race-adjusted odds ratios of overweight or obesity (body mass index\n25) ranged from 2.1 to 3.7 (P.01 for all), comparing persons with low fitness with\nthose with moderate or high fitness. Total cholesterol levels and systolic blood pres-\nsure were higher and levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were lower among\nparticipants with low vs high fitness.\nConclusion Low fitness in adolescents and adults is common in the US population\nand is associated with an increased prevalence of CVD risk factors.\nMETHODS\nPopulation\nThe NHANES is a nationally repre-\nsentative sample of the noninstitu-\ntionalized civilian US population.\nRace/ethnicity was self-reported, and\nparticipants were identified using a\ncomplex, stratified, multistage prob-\nability cluster design that over-\nsampled non-Hispanic blacks, Mexi-\ncan Americans, persons aged 60 years\nand older, and low-income individu-\nals so that nationally representative\nestimates of health could be generated\nin these often understudied popula-\nNHANES became a continuous bian-\nnual survey rather than the periodic\nsurvey that it had been in the past.\nThis report includes survey years\ndescription of the study design and\nsampling methodology for NHANES\nThe overall response rate for those\nwho completed the household inter-\nresponse rate for those examined in mo-\nbile examination units was 76.3%\nthrough 49 years without existing medi-\ncal conditions, diagnosed CVD, physi-\ncal limitations, or abnormal hemody-\nnamic parameters (ie, systolic blood\npressure 180 mm Hg, diastolic blood\npressure 100 mm Hg, or heart rate\n100/min) were eligible to partici-\npate in the cardiovascular fitness com-\nticipants in the age range for the\ncardiovascular fitness examination,\npleted the examination.

The initial goal of the sub-\nmaximal test was to elicit 75% of the\nage-predicted maximum heart rate\n(220-age). During the course of data\ncollection the protocol was modified to\nallow adolescents and adults to achieve\ntheir age-predicted maximum heart\nrate. To achieve this goal within the\nallotted test time of 8 minutes (2-\nminute warm-up and two 3-minute\nstages), the protocol was designed to ad-\nminister test protocols of varying dif-\nficulty (ie, speed, grade)8 to partici-\npants based on age, sex, body mass\nindex (BMI), and self-reported partici-\npation in physical activities.\nAll tests were supervised by trained\ntechnicians. Participants walked or ran\non treadmills. Heart rate was mea-\nsured at the end of warm-up and each\nminute during recovery using an au-\ntomated monitor with 4 electrodes con-\nnected to the thorax and abdomen. At\nthe end of each stage, heart rate and\nblood pressure were measured. Maxi-\nmal oxygen consumption (V\nmax)\nwas estimated by measuring the heart\nrate response to reference levels of sub-\nmaximal work. Higher V\nmax is in-\ndicative of more favorable cardiores-\npiratory fitness. Details of the protocols\nand fitness calculation formulas are\navailable.8\nAlthough submaximal exercise test-\ning is used clinically to diagnose CVD,\nit is less than ideal for estimating high\nfitness, as truly fit persons may not\nhave been asked to perform to their\nhighest level.9 Thus, we focused our\nreport on \"low fitness\" in the popula-\ntion by using categorizations of low,\nmoderate, and high fitness based on\nreference percentile cut points as rec-\nommended in the NHANES fitness\nassessment manual.8 Low (20th per-\ntiles), and high (60th percentile) fit-\nness was defined for adults based on\npublished data from the Aerobics Cen-\nter Longitudinal Study9,10 and for ado-\nlescents based on the FITNESSGRAM\nOther Measures\nData were collected at all study sites by\ntrained personnel according to stan-\ndardized procedures.6 Sociodemo-\ngraphic information (ie, age, sex, race/\nethnicity, educational attainment,\npersonal and family medical history)\nwas collected during the household in-\nterview. Physical examinations and\nlaboratory measurements were per-\nformed in a mobile examination cen-\nter. Weight and height were measured\nusing standard methods and digitally\nrecorded. Body mass index was calcu-\nlated as weight in kilograms divided by\nthe square of height in meters. Waist\ncircumference was measured horizon-\ntally at the uppermost border of the\nilium at the end of a normal expira-\ntion. Blood pressure was measured 3\nto 4 times (first measurement was\nexcluded) with participants in the\nseated position using a mercury\nsphygmomanometer.\nBlood specimens were processed lo-\ncally, then stored and shipped to cen-\ntral laboratories for analysis. Levels of\ntotal serum cholesterol and triglycer-\nides (measured in the morning exami-\nnation session only) were measured en-\nzymatically, levels of high-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were\nmeasured using precipitation, and lev-\nels of low-density lipoprotein choles-\nterol (LDL-C) were calculated using the\nFriedewald equation.13 Plasma glucose\nlevels (morning examination session\nonly) were processed using the refer-\nhemoglobin (HbA1c\n) values were stan-\ndardized to the method used in the Dia-\nbetesControlandComplicationsTrial.16\nOverweight and obesity were identi-\nfied in adults and adolescents by the\nWorld Health Organization BMI crite-\nrion.17 While participants with previ-\nously diagnosed hypertension and\nelevated resting blood pressure at the\ntime of examination were excluded\nfrom participating in the fitness test,8\nwe identified previously undetected\nhypertension in adults according to\nmodified guidelines (identification in\nthis survey was based on a single mea-\nsurement) from the Report of the Sev-\nenth Joint National Committee.18\nHypertension in adolescents was iden-\ntified as the 90th percentile of systolic\nor diastolic blood pressure based on\nage, sex, and height.19 Glucose level\nwas categorized according to cut\nDiabetes Association guidelines.20 The\nmetabolic syndrome was determined\nin adults by National Cholesterol Edu-\ncation Program Adult Treatment Panel\nCharacteristic\nAdolescents Adults\nFemale Male Female Male\nRace/ethnicity, %\nAnthropometrics\nLipids, mg/dL\nDiabetes measures\nBlood pressure, mm Hg\nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index; CI, confidence interval; HbA1c\n, glycosylated hemoglobin; HDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; NHANES, National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey.\nSI conversion factors: To convert mg/dL values to mmol/L, multiply total cholesterol and HDL-C values by 0.0259, triglyceride values by 0.0113, and glucose values by 0.0555.\n*Includes respondents indicating (1) multiracial; (2) missing race/ethnicity information; or (3) a single primary race/ethnicity other than Mexican American, other Hispanic, non-\nHispanic white, and non-Hispanic black.\nDetermined only in adults.\nCalculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.\n\u00a7Measured in a subset of 2542 participants.\nMeasured in adults as systolic or diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg, use of antihypertensive medications, or self-report of physician diagnosis.

The most striking in-\ndication of the health burden of low fit-\nness in the US population is the strong\nassociation among low fitness, obe-\nsity, and CVD risk factors that is al-\nready present in adolescents and young\nadults.\nWho Is at Risk?\nThere is a high prevalence of low fit-\nness in adolescents and a strong corre-\nlation between fitness and the presence\nofCVDriskfactors.Therelativelyhigher\nprevalence of low fitness in adoles-\ncents compared with adults in this re-\nport may be due in part to study exclu-\nsion criteria and the method for defining\nlow fitness. Adults with existing hyper-\ntension or other clinical CVDs, which\nare rare conditions in adolescents, did\nnot participate in the treadmill compo-\nnent of the examination. This poten-\ntially biased the sample of adults to-\nward being more fit. Alternatively,\nbecause aerobic capacity declines with\nage,22,23 the standards for defining ad-\nequate fitness in adolescents are higher\nthan those for adults. The categories of\nfitness used in this study were derived\nfrom an external reference standard for\nadolescents that was based on a smaller\nselect sample.11,12 Our data suggest that\nfew adolescents in an ethnically di-\nverse representative US sample meet\nthese fitness expectations.\nAlthough adolescents are not gener-\nally considered at risk for having clini-\ncal CVD events in the short term, the\ndevelopment of risk factors during ado-\nlescence and young adulthood sets the\nstage for heart disease in the middle and\nolder ages. Much of this evidence has\ncome from longitudinal studies such as\nthe Coronary Artery Risk Develop-\nment in Young Adulthood (CARDIA)\nstudy,24 the Bogalusa Heart Study,25 the\nAmsterdam Growth and Health Lon-\ngitudinal Study (AGHLS),26 and the\nCardiovascular Risk in Young Finns\nStudy.27 With the exception of CARDIA\nand the AGHLS, these studies have not\ninvestigated the relationship between\nobjectively determined fitness and de-\nvelopment of CVD risk factors, and only\nthe AGHLS measured fitness during\nadolescence. While we are unable to re-\nlate adolescent fitness to the subse-\nquent development of risk factors in this\ncross-sectional survey, we can extrapo-\nlate from previous research to suggest\nthat a large segment of US youth who\nare unfit and overweight are at risk for\nnegative cardiovascular consequences\nas they age.\nLow fitness is more prevalent among\nfemales compared with males, and\namong females, disparities by race/\nethnicity were apparent. Absolute lev-\nels of cardiorespiratory fitness differ be-\ntween females and males,22 but fitness\ncategorizations in this study were made\nbased on a sex-specific referent popu-\nlation. Because physical activity, the\nhealth behavior most strongly associ-\nated with fitness, is consistently lower\namong women,2 our findings of lower\nfitness among women are not surpris-\ning. Racial/ethnic differences in fit-\nness may also be explained by compar-\natively lower levels of activity in\nnonwhites vs whites. Sex and racial/\nethnic differences in low fitness nearly\nparallel the prevalence of obesity in the\npopulation28 and may account for the\nhigher prevalence of overweight and\nobesity in females compared with\nmales.29 The relatively higher preva-\nlence of diabetes and hypertension in\nracial/ethnic minorities may be attrib-\nutable, in part, to poorer fitness and\nTable 3.

The notable exception that may\nnot be due to health behaviors is the\ngenerally higher levels of HDL-C re-\nported among females and blacks.\nFitness and CVD\nNumerous studies in adult men and\ntween low fitness and increased mor-\ntality from cardiovascular and other\nlationship between low fitness and car-\ndiovascular mortality in particular\nis proposed to be mediated by the de-\nvelopment of CVD risk factors includ-\ning hypertension, diabetes, dyslipid-\nFurther, physical activity training in ef-\nforts to improve fitness have been\nshown to lower the risk of developing\nrisk factors, independent of changes in\nObesity and overweight could be de-\nscribed as the seminal public health\nproblem today.41 Body mass index and\nwaist circumference, which are esti-\nmates of overall and central adiposity,\nrespectively, demonstrated the most\nconsistent association with fitness in\nthis study, as evidenced by the highest\nmean values among the least-fit per-\nsons that decreased in a nearly graded\nfashion with increasing fitness. While\nthe correlation between low fitness and\nother CVD risk factors was not as con-\nsistent or dose-dependent, patterns in-\ndicated a generally worse cardiovascu-\nlar profile among the least-fit\nparticipants. We attempted to relate low\nfitness to the 10-year CVD risk using\nthe Framingham Risk Score among\nadults, but scores were generally too\nlow in this relatively young popula-\ntion sample selected to be at low risk.\nDespite this, evidence of higher BMI,\ntotal cholesterol level, and blood pres-\nsure with lower fitness status suggests\nthat less fit persons are at risk for de-\nveloping CVD if these deleterious pat-\nterns persist.\nStrengths and Limitations\nTo our knowledge, this is the first at-\ntempt to characterize fitness, deter-\nmined by objective treadmill testing, in\nadolescents and adults at the popula-\ntion level. However, these findings are\nnot without limitations. In this sample\nof US adults, fitness was estimated from\na submaximal treadmill test proto-\ncol.42 In contrast to symptom-limited\nmaximal protocols with or without di-\nrect measurement of oxygen consump-\ntion, submaximal testing is inferior for\ndetermining fitness because of its reli-\nance on prediction formulas.9,42 These\nprediction formulas, which are based\non estimates of predicted maximum\nheart rate that are often too low for\nphysically fit persons43 and may not ap-\nply to women,22 further compound the\nrisk of error. We were less confident in\nthe ability of the submaximal protocol\nto accurately estimate \"high\" fitness.\nConsequently, we chose not to focus on\nthe prevalence of this protective fac-\ntor in the population and were unable\nto quantify the level of fitness that cor-\nrelated with favorable CVD risk factor\nlevels in the population. Thus, recom-\nmendations for achieving specific lev-\nels of fitness cannot be made based on\nthis report.\nAlthough treadmill testing is gener-\nally considered a safe diagnostic test\nwhen conducted in the presence of\ntrained medical personnel, there re-\nmains a small risk of death during ex-\nercise. To balance the need for public\nhealth information about fitness with\nrisks to the individual survey partici-\npants, we surveyed a population at very\nlow risk for complications from exer-\ncise. Besides the obvious exclusion of\nolder adults who are at higher risk for\nCVD, individuals with previously di-\nagnosed hypertension were poten-\ntially the largest additional group of\nhigh-risk individuals who were not\ntested. An important consequence of\nthis restriction is that we are unable to\nmake generalizations to the popula-\ntion at greatest risk for CVD and the\ncomplications of low fitness--ie, older\nadults and individuals with existing risk\nfactors for CVD. As a result, these data\nlikely represent an underestimate of the\ntrue prevalence of low fitness in the\npopulation. There remains a paucity of\npopulation-level research on the dis-\ntribution of fitness in older persons and\npersons with comorbid CVD.\nCONCLUSIONS\nDespite these limitations, this report in-\ndicates that low fitness is a prevalent\nand important public health problem\nin the US population. The conse-\nquences of declines in physical activ-\nity over time are now evident by the\nlarge proportion of society with low lev-\nels of fitness. The correlations we re-\nport between low fitness and CVD risk\nfactors suggest a potential trend of in-\ncreasing morbidity and mortality from\nchronicdiseases--thefirstsignofwhich\nis the burgeoning obesity epidemic. His-\ntorical evidence from the campaign to\neducate about the dangers of cigarette\nsmoking indicates that education ef-\nforts, particularly among youth, can re-\ntard and reverse these negative health\nbehaviors. Thus, it is plausible that a\nsimilar education campaign about the\nhealth benefits of physical activity to im-\nprove cardiorespiratory fitness, in com-\nbination with changes in health care\npolicy to make environments more con-\nducive to physical activity, could be-\ngin to reverse this serious public health\nproblem.\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Carnethon had full access\nto all of the data in the study and takes responsibility\nfor the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the\ndata analysis.\nStudy concept and design: Carnethon, Gulati.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Carnethon, Gulati,\nGreenland.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Carnethon.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important in-\ntellectual content: Gulati, Greenland.\nStatistical analysis: Carnethon, Gulati.\nObtained Funding: Carnethon, Greenland.\nFinancial Disclosures: None reported.\nFunding/Support: Financial support for data collec-\ntion was provided by the National Center for Health\nStatistics (NCHS), a part of the Centers for Disease Con-\ntrol and Prevention, Department of Health and Hu-\nman Services.
