    "abstract": "Abstract\nPast research has typically shown negative effects of self-doubt on performance and psychological well-being. We suggest that\nthese self-doubt effects largely may be due to an underlying assumption that ability is innate and fixed. The present research\ninvestigated the main hypothesis that incremental beliefs about ability might ameliorate negative effects of self-doubt. We\nexamined our hypotheses using two lab tasks: verbal reasoning and anagram tasks. Participants' self-doubt was measured and\nbeliefs about ability were measured after participants read articles advocating either for incremental or entity theories of\nability. American College Testing (ACT) scores were obtained to index actual ability level. Consistent with our hypothesis,\nfor participants who believed ability was relatively fixed, higher self-doubt was associated with increased negative affect and\nlower task performance and engagement. In contrast, for participants who believed that ability was malleable, negative self-\ndoubt effects were ameliorated; self-doubt was even associated with better task performance. These effects were further\nmoderated by participants' academic ability. These findings suggest that mind-sets about ability moderate self-doubt effects.\nSelf-doubt may have negative effects only when it is interpreted as signaling that ability is immutably low.\n",

Specifically, it\ncan be considered the metacognitive representation of uncer-\ntainty about one's abilities. Self-doubt has been shown to\nhave many negative impacts, for example, the negative cor-\nrelation between self-doubt and self-esteem (e.g., Hermann,\nand the link between self-doubt and maladaptive coping\nstrategies such as self-handicapping and subjective over-\nachievement (e.g., Jones & Berglas, 1978; Oleson,\nPoehlmann, Yost, Lynch, & Arkin, 2000). We investigated\nwhether people respond to self-doubt differently, depending\non yet another metacognition about ability, namely, their\nmetacognition about the malleability of ability. We hypothe-\nsized that the belief that ability was malleable, commonly\nknown as implicit incremental beliefs of ability (e.g., Dweck,\ntive effects of self-doubt.\nSelf-Doubt\nMost people experience self-doubt at times, but some indi-\nviduals may experience chronic doubt about their compe-\ntence and routinely feel distress about upcoming\nperformance. If perception of self-worth is contingent upon\ncompetence or ability, self-doubt can become damaging to\nself-esteem (Wichman & Hermann, 2010). Indeed, self-\ndoubt is negatively correlated with self-esteem, with\nSelf-doubt is not the same as low self-efficacy. Self-efficacy\nis a strong personal belief that one can successfully perform\nin a specific domain (Bandura, 1997). Self-efficacy scales\nassess how certain people are that they can do a particular\ntask (cannot do at all to highly certain (one) can do;\nBandura, 1997). Self-doubt, however, reflects one's feeling\nof uncertainty about competence that may reach beyond a\nspecific sense of performance efficacy. The self-doubt scale\n(Oleson et al., 2000) includes such representative items as\n\"More often than not I feel unsure of my abilities\" and\n\"Sometimes I feel that I don't know why I have succeeded\nat something.\" Thus, people can have high self-efficacy\n(e.g., I believe I can perform the task) and yet still harbor\nself-doubt (e.g., but I am not sure my ability is high in this\narea. My high performance may just be due to high effort).\nResearch suggests that individuals use different types of\ncoping strategies to deal with chronic self-doubt. Self-\nhandicapping and subjective overachievement (Braslow,\nOleson et al., 2000) are two of the most notable\n1Western Kentucky University, Bowling Green, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nQin Zhao, Department of Psychology, GRH 3015, Western Kentucky\nEmail: qin.zhao@wku.edu\nIncremental Beliefs About Ability\nAmeliorate Self-Doubt Effects\nQin Zhao1 and Aaron Wichman1\n Keywords\nmetacognition, self-doubt, belief about ability, performance, psychological well-being\n2 SAGE Open\ncoping strategies. Self-handicapping involves behaving (or\nclaiming to behave) in ways that undermine one's own per-\nformance to obscure the link between ability and perfor-\nmance (Arkin & Baumgardner, 1985; Jones & Berglas,\navoid working on a presentation so that they can attribute\ntheir poor performance to factors such as underpreparedness\nrather than to low ability. Subjective overachievement as a\nself-doubt coping strategy entails expending an extraordi-\nnary amount of effort to achieve high performance (Jones &\neffort expenditure makes it difficult to attribute high perfor-\nmance to high ability, instead of effort.\nBeliefs About Ability\nSomething related to self-doubt that surprisingly has not\nbeenheavilyresearchedisincrementalbeliefsaboutability--\nbeliefs as to the extent to which ability is viewed as mal-\ndoubt literature implies that the negative consequences of\nself-doubt arise when people believe that ability is relatively\nfixed and stable. For instance, self-handicapping occurs\nwhen people believe it is better to withdraw effect and fail to\navoid admitting low competence. Overachievement as a\nnegative consequence of self-doubt similarly implies beliefs\nin ability as a fixed construct. Those who overachieve\nremain high in self-doubt in spite of their extreme effort\ninvestments; logically, if they had incremental beliefs, high\neffort should eventually translate into reduced self-doubt.\nWhat if high self-doubters believed that ability was mallea-\nble? Instead of self-handicapping or overachieving, self-\ndoubters who hold incremental beliefs about ability might\nshow both positive performance and psychological well-\nbeing outcomes.\nImplicit beliefs about ability have been studied in a vari-\nety of domains. According to Dweck (e.g., Dweck, 1999;\nDweck & Leggett, 1988; Hong, Chiu, Dweck, Lin, & Wan,\nbelief that ability is largely malleable and develops incre-\nmentally through effort (incremental belief); whereas others\nbelieve that ability is a fixed and stable entity (entity belief).\nIndividuals with incremental as opposed to entity beliefs dif-\nfer in motivational orientation and behavioral pattern.\nIncremental beliefs tend to motivate people to learn and to\ndevelop their abilities. Students with incremental beliefs are\nmore willing to take on challenging tasks and persist on them\npeople defensively to maintain a positive self-view of ability.\nStudents with entity beliefs tend to avoid challenges and to\nseek tasks that will prove that they are smart (Dweck, 1999,\n2006). Moreover, people with incremental beliefs put forth\nmore effort on a task after receiving negative feedback,\nwhereas those with entity beliefs tend to disengage from a\ntask after receiving negative feedback (e.g., Dweck &\nonstrates that students with incremental beliefs about ability\nshow higher academic achievement across challenging\nschool transitions and greater completion rates in challeng-\ning courses (see Yeager & Dweck, 2012). It is important to\nnote that these beliefs about ability vary on a continuum and\nchange dynamically based on environmental influences (e.g.,\nKurtz-Costes, McCall, Kinlaw, Wiesen, & Joyner, 2005).\nThe existing research on self-doubt and beliefs about abil-\nity is sparse. Reich and Arkin (2006) found that participants\nwho believed that their evaluators held an entity belief about\nability reported greater self-doubt about their upcoming test\nperformance when they expected to do poorly but less self-\ndoubt when they expected to do well, compared with their\ncounterparts who expected incremental evaluators. However,\nthese findings were about what self-doubters thought others\nbelieved, not about the self-doubters' own implicit beliefs.\nMore relevant to the current research, Wichman and Hermann\n(2010) were able to show a mediating effect of entity beliefs\nabout ability in the relationship between self-doubt and self-\nhandicapping (in a sample of more than 1,000 people). There\nis also evidence that compared with low self-handicappers,\nhigh self-handicappers are more likely to have entity beliefs\nPresent Research\nAny variable can serve multiple roles (e.g., Tormala, Brinol,\n& Petty, 2007). Although the prior work investigated beliefs\nabout ability as a mediator between self-doubt and maladap-\ntive coping, the focus of the present study was to examine the\ninteraction between beliefs about ability and self-doubt, that\nis, beliefs about ability as a moderator of the relationship\nbetween self-doubt and related outcomes. We hypothesized\nthat incremental beliefs about ability should diminish the\nnegative effects of self-doubt. Specifically, we expected that\nwhen people believe that ability was fixed, high self-doubt\nshould yield lower levels of well-being, lower task engage-\nment, and lower performance, compared with low self-doubt.\nHowever, when people believe that ability was malleable,\nthe difference between high and low self-doubt individuals\nshould be reduced.\nTo examine this idea, after collecting self-doubt scores,\nwe exposed the participants to a manipulation of their beliefs\nabout ability and then measured their ability beliefs, fol-\nlowed by our dependent measures. Measured ability beliefs\nwere used to predict the main dependent variables. These\nincluded measures of task performance, task engagement,\nand psychological well-being. American College Testing\n(ACT) scores (the ACT is a standardized college admission\ntest in the United States) were obtained to represent actual\nability level. Research on implicit theories shows that often,\nthe effects of these theories are most pronounced under dif-\nficult conditions, such as following a poor performance\n(Pollack, Burnette, & Hoyt, 2012), ego-depleting task (Job,\nZhao and Wichman 3\nDweck, & Walton, 2010), or, most relevant here, under con-\nditions where people perceive that they have low compe-\ntence (Ommundsen, 2001). We expected that low-ACT\nindividuals might have greater difficulty with our experi-\nmental tasks, and thus show most clearly the effects of\nimplicit theories moderating self-doubt effects.\nMethod\nParticipants and Design\nOne hundred university students (64 female) enrolled in\nintroductory psychology classes participated in the study for\npartial fulfillment of their class requirement. Participants'\nwere native English speakers and received partial course\ncredit for their participation. They were randomly assigned\nto either incremental or entity beliefs conditions.\nProcedure\nAll sessions were conducted on computers using MediaLab\n2012 software. After receiving instructions, participants\ncompleted the self-doubt scale (Oleson et al., 2000), an\neight-item measure ( = .82). Some example items are\n\"More often than not I feel unsure of my abilities\" and \"As\nI begin an important task, I usually feel confident in my\nabilities (reverse scored).\" Participants rated their level of\nagreement with each statement from 1 (disagree very much)\nto 6 (agree very much).\nNext, they started a \"reading comprehension\" task, which\nwas actually the manipulation of incremental or entity inter-\npretations of ability, as used by Miele and Molden (2010).\nThe article was named \"The Origins of Intelligence: Is the\nNature-Nurture Controversy Resolved?\" The article was fic-\ntitious and appeared as a publication in the November 2007\nissue of Psychology Today. The incremental and entity ver-\nsions describe scientific \"evidence\" that supported the idea\nthat intelligence/ability is environmentally determined and\ncan be improved over time, or that intelligence is genetically\ndetermined and remains stable over time. After the article,\nparticipants responded to three open-ended items (Miele &\nMolden, 2010) to increase the impact of the article.\nSpecifically, they (a) briefly summarized the main point, (b)\ndescribed the evidence that they found most convincing, and\n(c) described an example from their own experience that fit\nwith the main point of the article. Participants then com-\npleted an eight-item Personalized Measure of Theories of\nIntelligence (De Castella & Bryne, 2015), which was devel-\noped based on the Ideas About Intelligence Questionnaire by\nDweck (1999). Instead of general implicit theories about\nabilities, this personalized measure ( = .80) assesses stu-\ndents' personal theories about their own abilities. Personal\nbeliefs tend to be powerful predictors of motivation and per-\nformance (Bandura, 1997). Two example items are: \"I\nbelieve I can always substantially improve on my intelli-\ngence\" and \"I don't think I personally can do much to\nincrease my intelligence\" (reverse scored). Participants\nreported their level of agreement with each statement on a 1\n(disagree very much) to 6 (agree very much) scale.\nParticipants then completed three measures of psycho-\nlogical well-being. The first measure was the Positive and\nNegative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, &\nof words that describe different feelings and emotions such\nas \"distressed\" and \"proud.\" Participants were asked to read\neach item and indicate to what extent from 1 (not at all) to 5\n(extremely) they felt this way right now. The second measure\nwas the Performance Self-Esteem subscale of the State Self-\nEsteem Questionnaire (also called the Current Thought\nScale; Heatherton & Polivy, 1991). This 7-item question-\nnaire ( =.89) consists of statements such as \"I feel as smart\nas others\" and \"I feel frustrated about my performance.\"\nParticipants indicated their level of agreement with each\nstatement from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). The third mea-\nsure was a 20-item task anxiety questionnaire adapted from\nthe Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI; Spielberger et al., 1980).\nBefore participants responded to this questionnaire, they\nwere given sample items from the reasoning tasks that would\nbe used to measure their objective performance (see\nAppendix A) and told that they would be completing similar\nproblems. An example item on the questionnaire ( = .91) is\n\"I feel very panicky about the upcoming tasks.\" Participants\nrated to what extent they agreed with each statement out of a\n4-point scale from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much so).\nParticipants then started on the randomly ordered reason-\ning tasks (see Appendix A). After these tasks, participants\ncompleted measures of Task Involvement, Effort, and\nEnjoyment (Elliot & Harackiewicz, 1996); slightly modified\nto refer to the reasoning tasks used in this study. The Task\nInvolvement index ( =.74) consisted of six items such as\n\"While solving the reasoning problems, I was totally\nabsorbed in the problems.\" The Task Effort index ( =.95)\nincluded two items such as \"I put a lot of effort into solving\nthe reasoning problems.\" Lastly, the Task Enjoyment index\n( =.80) had three items, including \"I enjoyed solving the\nreasoning problems.\" Ratings were made on 7-point scales\nranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).\nLastly, participants completed a demographics question-\nnaire that included gender, age, major, ethnicity, and ACT\nscores. Participants were debriefed before leaving.\nResults\nArticle Version Effects\nWe first investigated the impact of the \"intelligence\" article\n(incremental vs. entity) on participants' ability beliefs. We\nreverse coded all entity items on the eight-item intelligence\nquestionnaire and then averaged across items so that higher\n4 SAGE Open\nscores indicated stronger incremental beliefs. Exposure to\nthe incremental (vs. entity) article caused higher incremen-\nwith that of previous research in which the same articles\nwere used to prime participants' ability beliefs (e.g., Miele\nwith Zhao et al. (2013), the present study showed a smaller\nmagnitude of the manipulation effect. In Zhao et al. (2013),\nthe article version produced a greater difference between\nthe incremental and entity groups: MIncremental\nMEntity\n= 22.6. In particular, the entity group in Zhao et al.\n(2013) reported lower incremental scores than the entity\ngroup in the current study.\nAnalytic Strategy and Data Preparation\nWe next examined the data for outliers and missing entries.\nOne case was identified as multivariate outlier, and thus\nexcluded from analysis. The identified case had an outlying\nCook's d value associated with verbal reasoning perfor-\nmance (larger than 1.20; next largest Cook's d value was\n0.18). This case also had a Mahalanobis D2 (Mahalanobis,\nticipants did not report ACT scores, resulting in a final sam-\nple of 92 for analysis.\nTo test our hypothesis that incremental beliefs of ability\nmight reduce the threat of self-doubt and yield positive out-\ncomes, we performed multiple regressions predicting each of\nthe following: performance on each of the two tasks, mea-\nsures of task engagement, and well-being measures. We pre-\ndicted these outcomes using dummy-coded article version\n(incremental vs. entity), standardized self-doubt scores, stan-\ndardized ACT scores, and all interactions. Regression results\nshowed that article version did not interact with self-doubt or\nACT scores to predict any of the dependent variables, p >\n.05. Although article version affected beliefs about intelli-\ngence, it was not directly related to our hypothesized effects\non the DVs. One possible explanation for this finding is that\nthe belief manipulation in the present study did not impact\nparticipants'beliefs as strongly as it could have. As indicated\nearlier, our manipulation produced a smaller magnitude of\neffect, compared with Zhao et al. (2013) where the same\narticles were used to manipulate beliefs.\nWe subsequently collapsed across the article version fac-\ntor and replaced it with the standardized continuous measure\nof (post-article) incremental belief scores. This change\naltered our approach from an experimental to correlational\none. We present our results organized into three sections\nbelow:\"TaskPerformance,\"\"MeasuresofTaskEngagement,\"\nand \"Measures of Well-Being.\" We predicted these outcomes\nusing standardized incremental beliefs, standardized self-\ndoubt scores, standardized ACT scores, and all interactions.\nThe ACT variable was included in our regression model to\nincrease power by controlling for what would otherwise be\nerror variance, and to allow us to investigate whether our\ntheoretically expected effects would be particularly strong\namong low-ACT individuals for whom actual ability did not\nalready suggest high levels of performance and engagement.\nTable 1 presents the descriptive statistics of our predictor and\noutcome variables, as well as correlations between them.\nTask Performance\nParticipants' performance on the two experimental tasks was\nfirst analyzed. Results for both tasks' regression models with\nstandardized self-doubt, implicit theories, and ACT, includ-\ning all interactions, showed F statistics significant at p < .001\nlevels. For verbal reasoning and anagram performance,\n78.5% correct, SD = 2.32), there was a three-way interaction\namong self-doubt, incremental belief, and ACT scores, B =\nfies the lower order effects, including a two-way interaction\nbetween self-doubt and incremental belief, p = .006, and a\ntwo-way interaction between ACT scores and incremental\nwere used to analyze the three-way interaction (Figure 1).\nThe results showed that for those with relatively higher ACT\nscores (+1 SD), the self-doubt \u00d7 incremental belief interac-\nHowever, for individuals with relatively low ACT scores\n(-1 SD), their performance was affected by a significant\ntwo-way interaction between self-doubt and incremental\ntion was such that for participants relatively low in incre-\nmental beliefs (-1 SD), higher self-doubt was associated\nexpected. However, for individuals higher in incremental\nbeliefs (+1 SD), the self-doubt effect was reversed. Self-\ndoubt was positively associated with performance, B = 1.20\n(SE = .44), p = .007. This finding supports the hypothesis\nthat incremental beliefs can change the nature of self-doubt\neffects, particularly for those with lower ACT scores, who\nmay feel less competent (cf. Ommundsen, 2001).\nSD = 4.16), there was a two-way interaction between self-\ndoubt and incremental belief (Figure 2), B = 1.16 (SE = .46),\np = .01, in addition to an effect of ACT scores, p < .001. No\nother effects were significant, p > .10. Simple slope tests of\nthe interaction showed a significant positive relationship\nbetween self-doubt and performance for individuals with rel-\natively high incremental beliefs (+1 SD), B = 1.35 (SE = .49),\np = .007. In contrast, for those with relatively low incremental\nbeliefs (-1 SD), self-doubt was negatively related to perfor-\ndid not reach significance. This pattern echoes the findings\nfor verbal reasoning, although without ACT moderation.\nZhao and Wichman 5\nTo summarize, incremental beliefs about ability amelio-\nrated the negative impact of self-doubt on task performance.\nOn the verbal reasoning task, this was particularly true for\nindividuals with low (ACT-assessed) actual ability.\nConsistent across tasks (verbal reasoning and anagram), for\npeople with strong incremental beliefs, a sense of self-doubt\nwas positively associated with performance. In contrast, for\npeople with strong entity beliefs, the overall pattern was that\nself-doubt impaired performance, with the proviso that ACT\nscores moderated this effect on the verbal reasoning task.\nMeasures of Task Engagement\nWe next analyzed measures of task involvement, effort, and\nenjoyment with the same standardized predictor variables\nand interaction terms. Regression results showed that model\nF statistics were significant for task involvement (p < .001;\nadjusted R2 = .20) and task enjoyment (p = .01; adjusted R2 =\nOn task involvement, there was a marginal three-way\ninteraction among self-doubt, incremental belief, and ACT\nginal two-way interaction between self-doubt and incre-\nmental belief, p = .06, a two-way interaction between ACT\nscores and self-doubt, p = .02, and effects of self-doubt,\np <.001, and ACT scores, p =.03.

For individuals with relatively low ACT scores\n(-1 SD), self-doubt \u00d7 incremental belief interaction was\nshowed that for low-ACT individuals relatively high in\nincremental beliefs (+1 SD), self-doubt was not signifi-\ncantly associated with task enjoyment, B = 0.29 (SE = .68),\np = .67. For low-ACT individuals also relatively low in\nincremental beliefs (-1 SD), though, higher self-doubt was\nassociated with lower task enjoyment, B = -2.53 (SE =\n1.09), p = .02.

Incremental beliefs about ability\nameliorated the negative impact of self-doubt on task\ninvolvement and enjoyment, particularly for individuals with\nlow actual ability. For low-ability individuals with strong\nincremental beliefs, self-doubt was unrelated to task involve-\nment or enjoyment.

However, ACT\nscores (actual ability) moderated self-doubt effects on these\nvariables (see Appendix B for these results).\nDiscussion\nPrevious research shows negative relationships between self-\ndoubt and a variety of outcome measures. We hypothesized\nthat incremental beliefs could change these relationships.\nAlthough the article version (incremental or entity) did not\ninteract with self-doubt or ACT score on our outcome vari-\nables, we were able to collapse across this factor and test our\nhypothesis with the post-article incremental belief scores.\nKeeping this in mind, our data are consistent with our main\nhypotheses. For all performance and task engagement mea-\nsures (except the effort measure), incremental beliefs moder-\nated self-doubt effects. Interestingly, these theoretically\nexpected effects were further moderated by ACT for verbal\nreasoning performance, task involvement, and enjoyment.\nIncremental beliefs ameliorated self-doubt effects on these\noutcome measures, particularly for low-ACT individuals.\nBeliefs about ability affect responses in performance situa-\ntions (see Dweck, 2012, for a review). Here, we show that\nthese beliefs also can moderate the effects of self-doubt. These\nfindings suggest that those who are particularly vulnerable to\nthe threat of self-doubt are individuals who have low academic\nability and believe that ability cannot be changed. Presumably,\nhaving a sense of self-doubt is less damaging if individuals\nbelieve that ability can be improved through effort. This mod-\neration effect indicates that self-doubt matters most on an aca-\ndemic performance task when it is perceived to index stable,\nlow ability (cf. Seligman, Abramson, Semmel, & von Baeyer,\n1979). Although this is a novel way to think about self-doubt,\nit is consistent with the consequences of an explanatory style\nthat attributes negative outcomes to stable, internal, and global\ncauses (Peterson, Seligman, & Vaillant, 1988). Self-doubt\nmatters most when it is seen as stable. Self-doubt is by defini-\ntion about an internal factor, ability. Only globality remains\nunspecified for high self-doubt, entity theory holders.\nOne plausible mechanism for our moderation effects is\nthat incremental beliefs may have made self-doubters more\nmotivated (or even \"fired up\") to do well on the tasks and\nhence eliminated the performance difference between high\nand low self-doubt groups. With entity beliefs, high self-\ndoubt likely yields lower motivation relative to low self-\ndoubt. Consistent with this idea, we found that incremental\nbeliefs moderated self-doubt effects for performance mea-\nsures and the task engagement measures of involvement and\nenjoyment. We found no incremental belief effects on the\neffort measure, consistent with past evidence that self-doubt-\ners with entity beliefs can adopt either self-handicapping\n(effort withdrawing) or subjective overachievement (effort\nenhancing) coping strategies. These strategies may have\ncombined to eliminate consistent self-doubt effects on the\neffort measure. Another possible mechanism for consider-\nation is that instead of focusing on how incremental theories\nboost motivation among high self-doubt individuals, one\ncould consider how in the presence of perceived low compe-\ntence, or after failure feedback, incremental theories have\nbeen shown to be more influential (Job et al., 2010; Pollack\net al., 2012). That is, rather than incremental theories moder-\nating self-doubt effects, perhaps it is self-doubt that moder-\nates incremental theories effects. Although experimental\nresearch would be required to adequately test this idea, it\nwould be consistent with previous research showing that\nincremental theories matter under conditions of relative\nadversity. This said, the evidence here suggests that incre-\nmental beliefs made self-doubters more deeply involved in\nthe tasks and enjoyed the tasks more, which in turn, improved\ntheir actual performance.\nFurther considering the specific results we found, in the\ncase of verbal reasoning, task involvement, and task enjoy-\nment, the effects of self-doubt and incremental beliefs were\nmoderated by participant ability (ACT score). This effect\nsuggests that self-doubt matters when it is considered diag-\nnostic for performance (i.e., in the absence of a strong basis\nFigure 5. Effects of self-doubt on negative affect, as moderated\nby incremental beliefs.\n8 SAGE Open\nfor expecting success due to high ability), and that only under\nconditions where self-doubt matters do incremental beliefs\nmoderate its effect. To be more specific, self-doubt reflects\ndoubts about ability. ACT is an objective measure of aca-\ndemic competence and can be understood as a proxy for per-\nformance efficacy. To the degree that competence is high,\nself-doubt might be expected to be less influential for perfor-\nmance, by such mechanisms as higher competence being\nassociated with more ability-relevant knowledge and greater\npersonal experience with the ability-related domain. In other\nwords, subjective doubt effects on performance may simply\nbe out-weighed by superior competence.\nThe absence of ACT moderation for anagram perfor-\nmance probably reflects the fact that the ACT does not assess\nthe kind of combinatory processes required to solve ana-\ngrams. It may also be the case that participants found the\nanagram task to be much more difficult than the verbal rea-\nsoning task, so that their efficacy to successfully complete\neach task was poor regardless of ACT-assessed ability level.\nThis is consistent with the fact that mean performance on the\nanagram tasks (57.7%) was lower than performance on the\nverbal reasoning task (78.5%). Under conditions where\nACT-assessed abilities were not clearly relevant to perfor-\nmance, self-doubt was likely considered more diagnostic,\nopening the door for the moderation of self-doubt by incre-\nmental beliefs.\nConsidering the measures of well-being, incremental\nbeliefs moderated the impact of self-doubt on general nega-\ntive affect, but not on performance self-esteem or task anxi-\nety. For these variables, ACT scores (not beliefs about\nability) moderated self-doubt effects, such that self-doubt\npredicted lower self-esteem and higher anxiety when ACT\nwere lower (see Appendix B). This suggests that in terms of\nnegative emotion relating to specific task performance, per-\nformance efficacy may be more effective than incremental\nbeliefs at pre-emptively buffering people prior to perfor-\nmance execution. We need to further investigate these ideas,\nbut the fact remains that on nearly all our performance and\ntask engagement measures, we found support for the hypoth-\nesis that implicit beliefs moderate self-doubt effects.\nThe present study is not without its weaknesses. For\ninstance, our sample is relatively small, and these data ulti-\nmately are correlational. Although measurement of both self-\ndoubt and incremental beliefs came before exposure to the\ndependent measures, there could be a third variable associated\nwith one or more of our individual difference predictors that\nmight be truly causal. Although the nature of our interaction\neffects makes it difficult to identify a possible third variable\nthat could account for these results, it remains a possibility. We\ncaution readers that although our correlational study resulted\nin the outcomes we expected from experimental manipulation\nof implicit theories, that the conclusions we draw do not have\nthe same certainty as those that would be derived from experi-\nmental evidence. Furthermore, we have presented a single\nstudy, which would benefit from replication and extension.\nGoing forward, it will be useful to achieve greater clarity on\nthe factors that caused our effects. Future research will hope-\nfully demonstrate that these findings are robust when subjected\nto experimental testing. Also going forward, these results have\nsignificant implications for some cross-cultural research.\nResearch suggests that students from ConfucianAsian countries\n(e.g., Hong Kong-China, South Korea, Japan, and Singapore)\nhave high academic achievement, but also higher levels of self-\ndoubt, compared with students from European countries (e.g.,\npeople's beliefs about ability and interpretations of self-doubt.\nFor example, ability is commonly believed to be innate and rela-\ntively stable in Western society (Weiner, 1986), and it is consid-\nered more important to succeed because of high ability than\nbecause of high effort (Covington & Omelich, 1979; Jones,\n1990). However, in Confucian culture, ability is believed to be\npeople may harness self-doubt as motivation to work harder\n(Hau & Ho, 2010). If the causal role of incremental theories of\nintelligence moderating self-doubt effects can be experimen-\ntally established, it may eventually be extended to provide an\nexplanation for some cultural differences.\nWe have known for some time that metacognitions can\ninfluence each other (e.g., Wichman et al., 2010). However,\nthis example of self-doubt and implicit beliefs, as uncertainty\nand malleability metacognitions targeting ability, is the first\napplication of this idea to better understand academic\nachievement. Our findings suggest that the most vulnerable\ngroup to the threat of self-doubt is the one with low academic\nachievement and entity beliefs about ability. Shifting mind-\nsets to believe in the malleability of ability ameliorates self-\ndoubteffects,notonlyintermsofenhancingtaskperformance\nand engagement, but also in improving general affect/well-\nbeing. We look forward to seeing additional tests of this idea,\nand to developing it to achieve better performance and well-\nbeing outcomes.\nAppendix A\nExamples of the Reasoning Tasks\n1. One of the tasks involves solving a set of 15 verbal\nreasoning problems. Each verbal reasoning problem\ninvolves analogies and you must choose the one\nalternative that best completes the statement or\nanswers the question.\nHere is an example:\n\nElated is to despondent as enlightened is\nto______B______\nA. aware B. ignorant C. miserable D. tolerant\n2. Another task involves solving a set of 15 everyday\nvocabulary anagrams. An anagram is a word made by\nusing letters of another word in a different order. You\nmust enter the anagram at the end of each word.\nZhao and Wichman 9\nHere is an example:\nTale: (Late)\nNote. Please contact either of the authors if you would like a copy of\nthese tasks.\nAppendix B\nAdditional Results on Performance Self-Esteem\nand Task Anxiety\nOn performance self-esteem, the regression coefficients\nrevealed a two-way interaction between self-doubt and ACT\neffects were significant, ps > .05. The same pattern of results\nwas observed for task anxiety: Effects of self-doubt (p <\n.001) and ACT scores (p = .02) were qualified by a two-way\ninteraction between self-doubt and ACT scores, B = -2.55\n(SE = .99), p =.01. The nature of these interactions was such\nthat self-doubt significantly predicted lower self-esteem and\nhigher anxiety, particularly for people with relatively lower\nACT scores. For participants with low ACT scores (-1 SD),\nhigher self-doubt was associated with lower performance\nrelatively high ACT scores (+1 SD), the magnitude of the\nself-doubt effect was reduced on performance self-esteem,\n(SE = 1.27), p = .001. Conceptually supporting our reasoning\nwith incremental beliefs about ability, these results show that\nfor performance self-esteem and task anxiety, actual ability\n(not beliefs about ability) moderated self-doubt effects.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAiken, L.
