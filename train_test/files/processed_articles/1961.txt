Although much of the re-\nsearch examining links between cortisol and CF has relied\non the experimental manipulation of cortisol levels (Lupien &\nhave been devoted to examining links between naturally\noccurring cortisol levels and CF (e.g., Seeman, McEwen,\nSinger, Albert, & Rowe, 1997). The diurnal rhythm of cor-\ntisol is garnering considerable empirical attention for its\nutility as an indicator of not only stress but also general\nneuroendocrine function and its potential links to physical,\nemotional, and cognitive health (Adam & Kumari, 2009).\nThe current study was conducted to examine associations\nbetween CF and the dynamics of daily cortisol across the\nadult life span in a national sample of adults.\nCortisol is a hormone secreted by the hypothalamic\u00ad\npituitary\u00adadrenal (HPA) axis. It is released in response to\nstress (Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004) but is more than just a\nproduct of the stress response and is a widely used indicator\nof general neuroendocrine/HPA axis health (Hellhammer\na diurnal pattern, reaching its peak within an hour after\nwaking and declining thereafter, until reaching a nadir at\napproximately midnight (Kirschbaum & Hellhammer,\nthe morning rise (MR) and the decline thereafter as the\ndiurnal cortisol slope (DCS; Adam & Kumari, 2009; Cohen\net al., 2006). Robust MR and DCS slopes are thought to reflect\na healthy HPA axis function and flattened profiles being\nAdditional evidence for patterns of healthy HPA axis\nfunction comes from a recent meta-analysis by Miller and\ncolleagues (2007) considering associations between chronic\nstress and HPA axis dysregulation. The authors found that\nchronic stress-related HPA dysregulation manifests as a\nflatter MR and DCS and higher overall total cortisol output.\nSuch dysregulation is also evidenced in lower morning\ncortisol levels and higher afternoon/evening levels. These\nconvergent patterns suggest that there are certain charac-\nteristics of diurnal cortisol indicative of healthy HPA axis\nfunction (i.e., steeper MR and DCS, higher morning lev-\nels, and lower afternoon/evening levels), which can inform\nhypotheses associations between cortisol and other con-\nstructs of theoretical interest.\nCF is one construct that has been linked to cortisol and\nreceived considerable empirical attention. Cortisol is thought\nto have proximal effects on CF by interfering with neural\ntransmission and subsequent behavioral performance\n2002) and more durable and distal effects via neuronal\ndeath from prolonged exposure to cortisol (Sapolsky, 1992).\nPreferential densities of cortisol receptors in the hippocampus\nAssociations Between Cognitive Function and Naturally\nOccurring Daily Cortisol During Middle Adulthood:\nTiming Is Everything\nRobert S.

We examined associations between cognitive function (CF) and the naturally occurring daily cortisol\nlevels using data from the Midlife in the United States survey and the National Study of Daily Experiences.\nbattery of cognitive tasks and 3\u00ad6 months later provided saliva samples upon waking, 30 min after waking, at lunch time,\nand at bedtime on 4 consecutive days.\nResults. Higher CF, particularly executive function, was associated with healthier daily cortisol profiles, including a\nsteeper diurnal cortisol slope, higher morning cortisol levels, and lower afternoon and evening cortisol levels.\nDiscussion. The results indicate that better CF is associated with healthier profiles of naturally occurring cortisol and\nunderscore the importance of the timing of cortisol sampling.\nKey Words: Cognitive function----Diurnal cortisol rhythm--Salivary cortisol.\nand frontal lobes have led researchers examining cognition\u00ad\ncortisol links to focus on tasks measuring episodic memory\n(EM), which is governed by the hippocampus (Squire,\n1992), and executive function (EF), which is governed by\nthe frontal lobes (Stuss & Knight, 2002). Although the\nmajority of research linking cortisol to CF has used experi-\nmentation to examine how acute changes in cortisol are\nassociated with CF (see Lupien & Lapage, 2001; Lupien &\nMcEwen, 1997 for reviews), there is a growing body of\nwork examining how naturally occurring cortisol levels and\nrhythms are associated with CF.\nFlatter DCS slopes have been associated with poorer EM\namong older adults experiencing memory deficits and\ndepressive symptoms (Fiocco, Wan, Weekes, Pim, & Lupien,\n2006), older adults positive for theAPOE-e4 allele, a known\nrisk factor for dementia (Gerritsen, Comijs, Deeg, Penninx, &\nGeerlings, in press), and poorer EF among community-\ndwelling older adults (Beluche, Carri\u00e8re, Ritchie, & Ancelin,\n2009). For morning cortisol levels, Lupien and colleagues\nhave shown that annual increases in 24-hr average basal\ncortisol levels are associated with poorer EM (Lupien et al.,\n1994) and smaller hippocampal volume (Lupien et al.,\n1998) among older adults. Similarly, Kuningas and col-\nleagues (2007) found that higher morning cortisol levels\nwere associated with poorer global CF, attention, and\nprocessing speed in older adults aged 85 years and older,\nwhereas Beluche and colleagues (2009) found that higher\nmorning cortisol levels were associated with poorer EF and\nEM in a community-dwelling sample of older adults. In\ncontrast, Gerritsen and colleagues (in press) found that\nhigher waking cortisol levels were associated with poorer\nEM performance but only among older adults carrying the\nAPOE-e4, whereas Kalmijn and colleagues (1998) found\nno reliable association between morning cortisol levels and\nan index of global CF. Finally, regarding afternoon/evening\ncortisol levels, Carlson and Sherwin (1999) observed that\nolder adults with higher afternoon levels of cortisol exhib-\nited poorer EM performance, whereas 12-hr overnight basal\ncortisol levels of Seeman and colleagues (1997) were as-\nsociated with poorer EM at baseline and greater declines\nin EM over a 2.5-year period among women. Similarly,\nGerritsen and colleagues (in press) found that higher corti-\nsol levels in the evening, just before bed, were associated\nwith poorer EM performance among older adults possess-\ning the APOE-e4 allele.\nResearch examining associations between the DCS,\nafternoon/evening cortisol levels, and CF seems to be rather\nconsistent showing that a flatter DCS and higher levels of\nafternoon evening cortisol are associated with poorer CF.\nFindings regarding morning cortisol are mixed, possibly\ndue to the timing of the cortisol assessments. Basal levels\nreported by Lupien were the average of samples taken over\na 24-hr period reflecting average cortisol output over a\ngiven time period that includes morning levels. Second,\nKuningas and Beluche observed that higher levels of cortisol\nwere associated with poorer CF, but Kuningas' morning\nsample was taken before 11 a.m. and Beluche's was taken at\nleast 1 hr after waking. Thus, in both studies, the samples\nwere possibly taken after the cortisol levels were likely\nalready starting to decline. Positive associations between\nCF and morning cortisol levels might be expected proximal\nto waking when cortisol levels are expected to be higher and\nincreasing, whereas negative associations might be expected\nonce levels have started to decline.\nPrevious research on cortisol and CF has also largely fo-\ncused on levels and dynamics of cortisol being important for\npredicting decrements in CF, implying a particular direction\nof effect. More recently, researchers have considered that\ncortsiol and CF may have a more dynamic relationship.\nExisting models of HPA axis function support this notion.\nAlthough cortisol is released from the adrenals and binds to\nreceptors in the hippocampus and frontal lobes, both these\nbrain regions also provide feedback to the hypothalamus as\npart of HPA axis downregulation (Lupien & Lapage, 2001).\nEmpirical support for such bidirectional associations also ex-\nists. Lupien and colleagues (2005) showed that evidence of\nchildrens' CF, with respect to making emotional attributions,\nsignificantly predicted morning basal cortisol levels. Using\nprospective longitudinal data, Power, Li, and Hertzman\n(2008) showed that lower childhood CF was predictive of a\nflatter DCS forty-five years later during adulthood. Further-\nmore, Applehans and Luecken (2006) found that EF was\nassociated with diminished cortisol reactivity to threat cues.\nRecent theoretical development regarding CF as an im-\nportant predictor of health complements these empirical\nfindings. Williams, Suchy, and Rau (2009) have reviewed\nevidence linking individual differences in CF, particularly\nEF, to better self-regulation, suggesting that EF is a\npotentially important characteristic for understanding\ndifferential exposure, reactivity, and recovery from stress.\nSimilarly, Gottfredson and Deary (2004) have suggested\nthat CF, particularly intellectual abilities related to EF,\nmay be associated with better health and longevity be-\ncause of increased skills useful in adaptation and prevent-\ning chronic disease. Here, CF may be beneficial for\nadapting to stressful situations and tempering immediate\nand prolonged reactions, and this may be reflected in\nhealthier naturally occurring cortisol profiles. Together,\nthis evidence supports potential bidirectional links be-\ntween CF and cortisol, however, evidence for such asso-\nciations during adulthood and old age, and considering\nboth EF and EM remains scant.\nThe current study\nThe current study was conducted to examine associations\nbetween CF and naturally occurring cortisol levels obtained\n3\u00ad6 months later using a national sample of adults ranging\nfrom 33 to 84 years of age. First, we examined associations\nbetween CF and both the MR and the DCS as well as cortisol\nlevels at each of four specific sampling occasions (upon\nwaking, 30-min postwaking, before lunch, and before bed).\nSecond, given the links between cortisol and the frontal\nlobes and hippocampus, we examined whether EF and EM\nfunction were each uniquely related to naturally occurring\ndaily cortisol. Consistent with previous literature, we hy-\npothesized that higher CF would be associated with MR\nand DCSs. Similarly, higher CF would be associated with\nhigher cortisol levels upon waking and 30-min postwaking\nbut lower levels before lunch and bed. Finally, given links\nbetween cortisol receptors in both the frontal lobes and the\nhippocampus, we expected EF and EM function to both\nexhibit unique associations with cortisol.\nMethods\nParticipants\nThe Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) II survey is com-\nthose participants, 4,445 completed the telephone cognition\nassessment and 2,022 completed the 8-day National Study of\nDaily Experiences (NSDE; 1,736 participants in the NSDE\nprovided cortisol assessments). A total of 1,500 participants in\nMIDUS completed both the telephone cognition assessment\nand the NSDE cortisol sampling protocol and serve as the sam-\nple for the current study. The mean age of the sample was 57\nwere female. The participants were fairly well educated, with\n30% having received a high school diploma or less, 51%\nhaving completed some college coursework or obtaining a\nbachelor's degree, and 19% having pursued education beyond\na bachelor's degree. The current sample is slightly older, more\neducated, in better health, and had higher CF scores (ps < .05)\nthan the full parent sample; however, these differences were of\nextremely small effect size (R2s < 1%).\nProcedure\nParticipants first completed the telephone cognitive as-\nsessment, and approximately three to six months later, they\nwere enrolled in the NSDE. Once enrolled in the NSDE,\nthey completed short telephone interviews about their daily\nexperiences and emotions. The interviews lasted approxi-\nmately 20 min and were conducted on eight consecutive\nevenings. Participants also provided four salivary cortisol\nsamples on Days 2\u00ad5 of the study. Data collection for the\n8-day interview protocol consisted of separate \"flights\" of\n30 participants, with the start day of the interviews being\nstaggered across the day of the week to control for the pos-\nsible confounding between day of study and day of week.\nParticipants received $45 for completing the study protocol.\nAssessment of Salivary Cortisol\nRespondents received a Home Saliva Collection Kit one\nweek prior to their initial phone call. Saliva was obtained\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics of Cortisol Samples and Sampling\nTimes\nCortisol (nmol/L) Time\nSample M SD M SD\nusing salivette collection devices (Sarstedt, N\u00fcmbrecht,\nGermany). Sixteen numbered and color-coded salivettes\nand instructions were included in the collection kit. In addi-\ntion to written instructions, telephone interviewers reviewed\nthe procedures and answered any of the participant's ques-\ntions. On Days 2 through 5, respondents provided four\nsaliva samples per day that were later assayed for cortisol.\nSaliva was collected immediately upon waking, 30 min\nafter waking, before lunch, and at before bed (Table 1).\nData on the exact time respondents provided each saliva\nsample were obtained from the nightly telephone interviews\nas well as on a paper\u00adpencil log sent with the collection kit.\nIn addition, approximately 25% of the respondents (N =\n430) received a \"smart box\" containing a computer chip that\nrecorded the time respondents opened and closed the box.\nCorrelations between self-reported times across collection\noccasions were all above .9. Correlations between self-\nreported times and times obtained from the \"smart box\"\nranged from .75 for the evening occasion to .95 for the\nmorning occasion.\nUpon completion of the saliva sampling procedure, the\nsalivettes were shipped to the MIDUS Biological Core\nat the University of Wisconsin, where they were stored at\n-60 \u00b0C. For analysis, salivettes were thawed and centri-\nfuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min, yielding a clear fluid with low\nviscosity. Cortisol concentrations were quantified with a\ncommercially available luminescence immunoassay (IBL,\nHamburg, Germany), with intra-assay and interassay co-\nefficient of variations below 5% (Dressend\u00f6rfer, Kirsch-\nbaum, Rohde, Stahl, & Strasburger, 1992). Almeida,\nMcGonagle, and King (2009) and Almeida, Piazza, and\nStawski (2009) provide additional information regarding\nthe assessment of cortisol in this study.\nCognitive Function\nCF was assessed in a telephone interview using the Brief\nTest of Adult Cognition by Telephone (BTACT: Lachman &\nkey fluid cognitive domains, including episodic verbal\nmemory (immediate and delayed recall; Rey, 1964), work-\ning memory span (backward digit span; Wechsler, 1997),\nEF (verbal fluency; Lezak, 1995), reasoning (letter series;\ncessing (backward counting). A total CF score was obtained\nby summing the scores on the immediate and delayed recall\ntasks and converting this to a z score. This standardized\nmemory score was then averaged with z scores for the re-\nmaining four tests to compute an overall composite score.\nFactor analytic work also supports a two-factor model, broadly\nrepresenting EF and EM factors (Lachman, Agrigoroaei,\nMurphy, & Tun, in press). EF was a z-score composite of\nthe digit span backward, category fluency, number series,\nand backward counting tasks, and EM was a z-score com-\nposite of the immediate and delayed recall tasks.\nCovariates\nSmoking Status.--Smoking status was determined by re-\nspondents identifying themselves as routine smokers as\nwell as the number of cigarettes an individual reported con-\nsuming on a daily basis during the study period. Individuals\nwho did not identify themselves as smokers or who did not\nreport smoking any cigarettes during the study protocol\nwere classified as nonsmokers. A dichotomous variable was\nused to index smoking status.\nMedication Use.--Participants reported their current use\nof medications known to influence cortisol, including steroid\ninhalers, steroid medications, medications containing corti-\nsone, birth control pills, other hormonal medications, and/or\nantidepressant/antianxiety medications (Granger, Hibel,\nFortunato, & Kapelewski, 2009). A dichotomous variable\nwas created to indicate whether a participant reported taking\nany of the aforementioned medications currently.\nSelf-rated Health.--Participants rated their physical\nhealth on a 5-point scale (1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = good, 4 =\nvery good, 5 = excellent).\nData Reduction.--Cortisol data from 27 participants\n(1.8% of the sample) identified as shift workers were\nexcluded. Furthermore, cortisol samples greater than 60\nnmol/L (n = 331, 1.4%) and for which corresponding\ncollection times were missing (n = 220, <1%) were also\nexcluded. Thus, the final analytic sample comprised 1,473\nparticipants providing 23,017 useable saliva samples.\nAnalytic Strategy\nWe modeled the diurnal rhythm of salivary cortisol using\na three-level, piecewise multilevel model, which allowed us\nto explicitly model variability in cortisol levels across the\nday, across days, as well as across people (Equation 1).\nTime since the second cortisol sample is used as the time\nmetric for this model, so the inflection point for the piece-\nwise model is set at the highest level of cortsol typically\nobserved in these data.\nCortisol = + MR + DCS\n+ DCS \u00d7 DCS + e\nodi di di odi di odi\ndi odi odi\n  \n \n\nWake-Up Timedi\n- MeanWake-Up Time.i\n\nWake-Up Timedi\n- MeanWake-Up Time.i\n\nWake-Up Timedi\n- MeanWake-Up Time.i\n\n- MeanWake-Up Time.i\n\n= \n+\n\n= \n+\n\n= \n+\n\n= \n+\nAccording to Equation (1), at Level 1, the cortisol level\nat occasion o, on day d, for person i, is a function of an\nintercept, which correspond to their cortisol level at the\ntime they provided their second sample (b0di\n), and three\nslope parameters. The first slope parameter (b1di\n) reflects\nthe MR and captures the rate of change between the first\nand second sampling occasions as a function of the\namount of time that elapsed between them. The last two\nslope parameters (b2di\n) represent the DCS. Linear\nand quadratic terms were included to capture both the rate\nof decline and the deceleration in the rate of decline in\ncortisol throughout the day as a function of the amount of\ntime that has elapsed since the time of the second sample.\nThus, all slope parameters can be interpreted as the rate\nof change in cortisol per hour from the time the second\nsample was taken.\nAt Level 2, the Level 1 intercept and slope parameters\nbecome outcomes, and each person's intercept, MR, and\nafternoon decline parameters on a given day are now pre-\ndicted as a function of each person's average intercept (d00i\n)\n) across the 4 days as well as\na person-centered time-varying covariate, wake-up time,\nwhich allows for systematic day-to-day coupling between\nwhen one wakes up and the magnitude of the slope param-\neters characterizing their daily cortisol rhythm.\nAt Level 3, the Level 2 parameters become outcomes,\nand each person's average intercept, MR, and DCS slopes\nacross the days are given as a function of the sample average\nPerson-level predictors are also included at this level of\nanalysis and are included to model differences in the intercept,\nMR, and DCS slopes as a function of individual differences in\nwere entered simultaneously, so the resulting estimates are\npartialled for the other predictors in the model.\nThis model also contains a number of variance compo-\nare Level 3 variance components and\nreflect individual differences in the intercept, MR, and linear\nDCS parameters, respectively. u0di\nare Level 2\nvariance components and reflect within-person, day-to-day\nvariability in the intercept, MR, and DCS slopes. Finally, eodi\nis the Level 1, or residual variance, and reflects variability in\ncortisol levels within-persons across the day (within-day).\nResults\nTable 2 presents the results of the model (Equation (1))\nestimating associations between CF and cortisol slopes\ncovarying for wake-up time, age, sex, education, smoking\nstatus, medication use, and self-rated health. The intercept\nof the model reflects the levels of cortisol at the time of the\nsecond sampling occasion (17.33 nmol/L). Since the model\nwas centered at the time of the second cortisol sample, the\nMR estimate is negative and indicates that cortisol levels\nincreased 6.55 nmol/L per hour elapsed between the first two\nsamples. The DCS reflects the rate of change in cortisol levels\nfor each hour since the time of the second sample. Here, the\nlinear DCS slope parameter indicates that cortisol levels ini-\ntially decreased at a rate of 2.00 nmol/L per hour initially, and\nthe quadratic DCS effect indicates that the rate of decline was\ndecelerating at a rate of .08 nmol/L per hour thereafter.\nWe observed a number of significant associations\nbetween our covariates and the parameters of the cortisol\nslopes. The within-person effect of wake-up time was sig-\nnificant indicating that on days people woke up later than\nusual, their cortisol levels at the second sampling occasion\nwere significantly higher than usual, their MR was flatter\nthan usual, and they exhibited a slightly greater rate of\ndeceleration of the DCS (ps < .05). Similarly, individual\ndifferences in wake-up time were associated with these pa-\nrameters as well indicating that people who, on average,\nwoke up later possessed lower cortisol levels at the second\nsampling occasion, a flatter MR, and a greater rate of decel-\neration in their DCS (ps < .01). We also observed age differ-\nences in these parameters such that older adults had higher\nTable 2.

Women exhibited significantly steeper MR and\nDCS than did men (ps < .05). Smokers exhibited a steeper\nMR and a flatter DCS than did nonsmokers (ps < .05). Par-\nticipants who reported better health had a steeper MR and\nDCS. Neither medication use nor education was significantly\nassociated with any of the slope parameters. Importantly,\nhigher CF was associated with slightly higher levels of corti-\nsol at the time of the second sampling occasion (p = .09) and\na steeper DCS (ps < .05). Alternatively, lower functioning in-\ndividuals exhibited lower cortisol levels at the time of the sec-\nond sampling occasion and a flatter slope profile throughout\nthe afternoon and into the evening (see Table 2 and Figure 1).\nNext, we considered how CF was associated with cortisol\nlevels at each sampling occasion. This was done by simply\nrestricting the statistical model shown in Equation (1) to\nfocus on each cortisol sampling occasions iteratively (i.e.,\nfour 2-level models), incorporating the same predictors and\ncovariates. This allowed us to consider the specificity of\nthe association between CF and cortisol levels at the four\noccasions across the day (Figure 2). CF was associated\nwith significantly higher levels of cortisol upon waking\nlevels of before lunch (estimate=-.25, SE = .13, p = .04) and\nNext, we considered whether individual differences in EF\nand EM were each uniquely associated with the parameters\nof the diurnal rhythm of cortisol as well as cortisol levels at\neach of the sampling occasions. To do this, we reestimated\nthe models used for the previous set of analyses but entered\nEF and EM as simultaneous independent predictors. Higher\nEF was associated with a steeper DCS (estimate = -.17,\nSE = .07, p = .01) and a larger quadratic slope, reflecting a\ngreater rate of deceleration in the DCS (estimate = .008,\nSE = .003, p = .02). No significant associations emerged\nbetween EM and the MR or DCS.\nA similar patterned emerged when considering EF and EM\nas predictors of cortisol levels at each sampling occasion\nFigure 1. Diurnal cortisol rhythm as a function of cognitive function.\nFigure 2. Cortisol levels as a function of cognitive function (+p < .10, *p < .05, **p < .01).\n(Table 3). Higher EF was associated with significantly lower\ncortisol levels before lunch (estimate = -.26, SE = .13, p = .05)\nand before bed (estimate = -.25, SE = .12, p = .05). Once again,\nnone of the effects with EM were statistically significant.\nAge Differences in Cognition\u00adCortisol Associations\nWe also explored age differences in the associations\nbetween our indices of cognition and cortisol by adding the\nage by cognition interaction as a Level 3 predictor to Equa-\ntion (1). None of the interactions were significant for either\nthe CF composite or the EF and EM composites (ps > .16).\nWe also explored whether age differences might be most\nevident in the oldest segment of the sample by testing non\nlinear age effects and similarly found no evidence to sup-\nport age effects (ps > .33).\nDiscussion\nThe current study produced a number of findings. First,\nhigher levels of CF were associated with healthier daily cor-\ntisol profiles, including a steeper DCS, higher cortisol levels\nupon waking and 30 min postwaking, and lower cortisol\nlevels before lunch and bedtime, three to six months later.\nSecond, the observed effects of CF on cortisol were largely\nspecific to individual differences in EF as EM showed no\nsignificant unique associations with any index of cortisol.\nThird, no significant age differences in the associations\nbetween CF and cortisol were observed. Furthermore, our\nconfidence in these findings is bolstered by the emergence\nof these significant effects after covarying for relevant con-\nfounding factors, including sex, education, smoking status,\nmedication use, and self-reported health. Finally, the cur-\nrent results underscore the importance of the timing of\ncortisol assessments and how cortisol levels across the\nday might be associated with other variables of theoretical\ninterest.\nAs expected, higher levels of CF were associated with a\nsteeper DCS. This result is consistent with previous studies\nshowing a similar association between steeper DCS and\nhigher CF among older adults (Beluche et al., 2009; Fiocco\net al., 2006; Gerritsen et al., in press). The studies by Fiocco\nand Gerritsen, however, showed a flatter DCS being associ-\nated with poorer EM, whereas Beluche and our study\nobserved associations specific to indices of EF. The sample\nemployed by Fiocco self-identified as having memory defi-\ncits and suffered from a number of depressive symptoms,\nwhereas Gerritsen only observed the association among\nolder adults possessing a risk factor for memory impairment\nand dementia, APOE-e4. Thus, clinical or disease-related\nprocesses could be a confounding factor. Our results echo\nTable 3.

One reason for the lack of\nassociation could be that only two samples were used to\ncapture the MR. Other research examining the MR has em-\nployed more intensive sampling of cortisol levels proximal\nto waking (e.g., Fries, Dettenborn, & Kirschbaum, 2009)\nand observed a more complex pattern than we could. One\nstudy that has examined the relationship between the MR\nand CF did so among younger adults and failed to observe\nan association (Pruessner et al., 2007). Thus, although the\nexisting body of research is small, there is little evidence to\nsuggest that individual differences in CF are reliably associ-\nated with the MR. The differential pattern of associations\nbetween CF, the MR, and DS is consistent with recent re-\nviews, suggesting that the MR and DCS may be distinct\nphenomena reflecting different underlying biological/\nneuroendocrine processes (e.g., Clow, Thorn, Evans, &\nHucklebridge, 2004) and merits further empirical consider-\nation to better understand factors associated with each.\nAssociations among CF and cortisol levels at each of\nsampling occasion revealed a complex, yet clear, set of find-\nings. Higher levels of CF were associated with higher corti-\nsol levels upon waking and 30 min postwaking but lower\nlevels of cortisol before lunch and bed. These results are\nconsistent with previous research showing higher morning\ncortisol levels and lower afternoon and evening cortisol\nlevels being associated with higher CF (Beluche et al.,\nThere is, however, research showing that higher morning\ncortisol levels are associated with lower CF (Kalmijn\ncortisol in the morning but after the MR had occurred,\nand cortisol levels would have likely started declining.\nThus, in terms of the timing of cortisol samples and their\nexpected association with CF, a simple distinction between\na.m. and p.m. seems a bit too gross. A positive association\nbetween cortisol levels and CF might be expected within\nthe first hour of waking when cortisol levels are expected\nto be higher and increasing. Once cortisol levels start to de-\ncline after reaching the zenith, associations might become\nnegative. Together, these results suggest that one important\narea of future research could be identifying how and when\nCF and cortisol levels should be associated depending on\nthe timing of the cortisol sampling.\nWhen considering how individual differences in EF and\nEM were associated with the MR, DCS, and cortisol levels\nat each sampling occasion, we found that the associations\nwere specific to EF. Higher levels of EF were associated\nwith a steeper DCS and lower cortisol levels before lunch\nand bed. These results differ from the findings using the CF\ncomposite in that EF was not significantly associated with\ncortisol levels for either of the morning samples. The asso-\nciations between the CF composite and morning cortisol\nlevels were not particularly robust, and splitting this com-\nposite into the EF and EM composites may have come at the\nexpense of reliability. The significant findings are, however,\nconsistent with previous research showing higher EF among\nolder adults with a steeper DCS and lower evening cortisol\nlevels (Li et al., 2006) and extends this research to show an\nassociation that is observable in a national sample of midlife\nand older adults.\nOur failure to observe associations between EM and\ncortisol is inconsistent with previous findings among aging\nsamples (Carlson & Sherwin, 1999; Gerritsen et al., in\npress; Li et al., 2006) but could be due to differences in the\ntasks used to assess EM or differences in the sample com-\nposition. Individual differences in EM may be more dis-\ncriminating during old age when age- and disease-related\nprocesses reflected in EM and hippocampal function are\nmore prevalent as compared with midlife. Furthermore,\nmore generally, MIDUS was designed as a study of midlife\nhealth and well-being. As such, the relative undersampling\nof older adults may have worked against us for detecting\nage differences in cognition\u00adcortisol associations between\nmiddle age and very old adults. Nonetheless, these results\nsuggest that DCS and cortisol levels across the day are\nreliably associated with EF but that the associations may\ndepend on the time of day.\nOur results are also consistent with recent theoretical\naccounts, suggesting that CF, and in particular EF, is an\nimportant predictor of neuroendocrine/HPA function (Power\net al., 2008) and health more broadly (Gottfredson & Deary,\nences in EF were predictive of healthier diurnal cortisol\nprofiles, the mechanism(s) underlying this association is\nunclear. Williams and colleagues have argued that EF is im-\nplicated in self-regulation, including reactivity and recovery\nfrom stress. Thus, one explanation could be that individual\npossessing higher levels of EF may be better at tempering\ntheir reactions to stressful experiences which in turn leads\nthem to have relatively healthier profiles of HPA axis func-\ntion. Applehans and Leucken (2006) showed that higher EF\nwas associated with dampened cortisol reactivity to threat.\nSimilarly, using MIDUS/NSDE data, we have shown that\nhigher CF was associated with dampened emotional reactiv-\nity to daily stressors (Stawski, Almeida, Lachman, Tun, &\nRosnick, 2010). Future research aimed at understanding the\nmechanism(s) underlying such cognition\u00adhealth linkages\nwould be an important contribution.\nLimitations\nOur estimate of the MR was defined by two cortisol\nsamples and the DCS by three samples. More intensive\nsampling of cortisol throughout the day will provide better\nresolution of the slopes and trajectories of cortisol through\nthe day and allow for more precise test of how CF is associ-\nated with the MR and DCS. Recent work on the MR sug-\ngests that sampling every 15 min from waking through at\nleast the first hour of the day may be needed to more accu-\nrately capture the complete dynamics of morning cortisol\npatterns (e.g., Hellhammer et al., 2007). Similarly, other\nlarge-scale studies have shown that the shape of the DCS\nmay be more complex than the quadratic shape we pre-\nsented here (e.g., Cohen et al., 2006), suggesting that more\nfrequent sampling (hourly or bihourly) could provide a\nmore comprehensive account of the dynamics of the DCS\nand reveal additional important associations. More inten-\nsive sampling regimens would also allow for a more precise\ntriangulation when the association between cognition and\ncortisol changes direction.\nAlthough we observed higher CF associated with higher\nmorning cortisol, Hellhammer and colleagues (2004) showed\nhypocortisolism in the morning to be associated with better\nhealth. Hellhammer defined hypocortisolism based on\n6-day work of low morning cortisol levels and a dexameth-\nasone suppression test, which provide a much stronger basis\nfor defining hypocortisolism. As such, we must view our\nresults with appropriate circumspection in that although\nour results suggest a pattern of result reflecting relatively\nhealthier versus relatively unhealthier patterns and profiles\nof cortisol, these results cannot be used as a concrete\nbarometer of truly healthy or unhealthy and unhealthy peo-\nple or hypocortisolism and hypercortisolism.\nWith respect to modeling the diurnal rhythm of cortisol,\nthere is not field-wide agreement on the \"correct\" way to\nmodel the DCS as some research has modeled the DCS\nfrom waking (e.g., Adam, Hawkley, Kudielka, & Cacioppo,\n2006), whereas others, like ourselves, have modeled the DCS\nfrom the peak or thereabouts (e.g., Kudielka, Broderick, &\nKirschbaum, 2003). Some have even used both in the same\nstudy (Matthews, Schwartz, Cohen, & Seeman, 2006). A\nsystematic examination contrasting these different methods\nand clear explication of the implications of each would be\nof tremendous benefit.\nThe measure of CF was designed to be used as a brief\ncomposite index for use in large-scale survey studies. It\nshould also be noted that our index of EF comprised four\nindicators, whereas the index of EM comprised two indica-\ntors, which reflected different dimensions of performance\non the same task. Thus, the reliability of these constructs\nmay have affected our ability to detect associations. Future\nresearch would benefit from more thorough and systematic\nexaminations of examining how EF, EM, and cortisol levels\nacross the day are associated as well as consideration of\nadditional domains of cognition would be of interest.\nFinally, the current study is cross-sectional and cannot\ndetermine the direction of the association between cortisol\nand cognition. Although CF was assessed 3\u00ad6 months prior\nto cortisol, it is unlikely that the later affected the former.\nWe, however, do not know that 3\u00ad6 months is the most\nrelevant window of time for durable downstream effects of\ncognition on cortisol. Longitudinal research tracking both\nover time and better understanding lead\u00adlag relationships\nwill be of great benefit for understanding the time course\nover which these dynamic relationships occur.\nConclusions\nThe current study was successful in providing evidence for\na complex relationship between CF and healthy profiles and\nlevels of naturally occurring cortisol. Higher levels of CF\nwere associated with a steeper DCS, higher levels of cortisol\nin the morning, proximal to waking, as well as lower cortisol\nlevels in the afternoon and evening, and these effects were\nlargely reflected in individual differences in EF but not EM.\nThe results of the current study underscore the importance of\nthe timing of cortisol sampling for understanding associa-\ntions between naturally occurring daily cortisol and CF as\nwell as other variables of theoretical interest as relatively\nhigher levels of cortisol do not always appear to be bad.\nFunding\nThis research was supported by grants from the National Institute of\nCenter for Population Health and Aging.\nCorrespondence\nCorrespondence should be addressed to Robert S.
