    "abstract": "Abstract\nLaboratory-based learning is increasingly considered to be an integral component of undergraduate education. However,\nstudents do not always perceive the value of laboratory learning in the college classroom. The current research sought to\ncreate an effective laboratory learning environment within a research methods course and to assess students' perceptions of\nthis approach at the end of one semester. This article reports the findings for two studies; in Study 1, a survey was given to 17\ncriminal justice, health care management and advocacy, and psychology students. In a subsequent semester, challenges from\nStudy 1 were addressed, and the same survey (i.e., Study 2) was given to 20 criminal justice and psychology majors. Across\nboth samples, students' responses to the laboratory learning paradigm were generally positive, yet concerns and challenges\nwere identified. Future research should attempt to address these concerns and to assess objective student outcomes, such\nas grades in the course.\n",

However, incorporating these techniques\ninto the classroom comes with its challenges; for example, it\nis often challenging to convince students to embrace coop-\nerative learning or, as they are used to calling it, \"group\nwork.\" As Giordano and Yost Hammer (1999) posit, it is\nwise to anticipate that students are going to be resistant to\n\"group work.\" Therefore, cooperative learning depends on\nthe ability of the instructor to convey the value of working\nwith their peers and to effectively facilitate group projects.\nDiane Halpern's guidelines for cooperative learning can\nbe used to anticipate, and address, issues of students'percep-\ntions of working in groups, and set up an environment that\nwill encourage cooperative, problem-based learning\n(Halpern, 2011). These guidelines include making sure that\nthere are never more than four students in a group and that\nstudents are strategically assigned to groups. Halpern also\nencourages a degree of positive interdependence, while also\nincorporating methods of keeping individual group members\naccountable for their contributions. In this model, the role of\nthe professor is to act as a facilitator, someone who can\nresolve conflict within groups, and ensure that the problem-\nsolving discussions are interactive and inclusive of all stu-\nToday, many colleges are revising their curriculum to fol-\nlow a laboratory learning model, which creates laboratories\ninside and outside of the classroom, and often depend on\ncooperative learning-based projects. Experts in the field of\neducation describe this model as providing, \"alternatives to\nlectures and `recitation'; they are a clarion call for hands-on\nlearning and social interaction among students with each\nother and collectively amongst faculty, staff and students\"\nthat there are challenges to the laboratory-based model such\nas getting undergraduate students to appreciate the value of\nlaboratory activities within a research methods course\n(Strategies for Success, 1999), particularly when they are\nmore familiar with the traditional lecture-based approach.\nAccording to Lewandowski and Sizemore (2011),\nresearch methods courses present unique challenges in terms\n1Southern Vermont College, Bennington, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nSarah Knapp, Donald Everett Axinn Division of Social Sciences, Southern\nEmail: sknapp@svc.edu\nLaboratory Learning in a Research\nMethods Course: Successes and\nChallenges\nSarah Knapp1\n Keywords\nlaboratory learning, cooperative learning, problem-based activities, undergraduate education, research methods\n2 SAGE Open\nof students' perceptions and attitudes; among these chal-\nlenges are that while students may be \"learning,\" they may\nnot be \"liking\" the course because they see research methods\nas one of those courses that you just have to get through to\ngraduate. Furthermore, although students seem to understand\nthe utility of biological research, this may not extend to\nsocial research. Finally, because statistics, research methods,\nand writing courses are often taught separately, students may\nnot be integrating their knowledge of all three together\n(Lewandowski & Sizemore, 2011). Dr. Lewandowski's\nexcellent mentorship contributed greatly to this project.\nThe rationale of the following two studies was to design,\nand improve upon, a research methods course that would\nreflect the need to integrate statistics, methodology, and writ-\ning (Lewandowski & Sizemore, 2011) using a laboratory\nlearning approach (DeCiccio, 2009) and guidelines for set-\nting up an effective cooperative learning environment\n(Halpern, 2011). The major goals were to foster students'\nperceptions of the value of laboratory learning, to instill an\nappreciation of research methods in the social sciences, and\nto improve student learning outcomes through cooperative\nlearning projects with their peers. The successes and chal-\nlenges of this approach are reported, and future directions\nidentified.\nThe goal of Study 1 was to create an environment that would\npromote laboratory learning throughout one semester of an\nundergraduate social research course. As this type of curricu-\nlum continues to be emphasized in higher education, it is\nimportant that best practices in delivering such a curriculum\nbe identified and embraced by students. Furthermore, cele-\nbrating successes and responding to challenges in an attempt\nto grow as teachers and as learners will lead to a more suc-\ncessful and knowledgeable community in institutions of\nhigher education.\nMethod\nParticipants.Participants in Study 1 were 17 undergraduate\n22 years). These students were enrolled in a research meth-\nods course at a 4-year liberal arts institution that is required\nfor all psychology, health care management and advocacy,\nand criminal justice majors. In Study 1, 10 of these students\nwere psychology majors, four were majoring in criminal jus-\ntice, and three students were health care management and\nadvocacy majors. When asked about their status at the col-\nlege, eight of them reported that they were seniors, graduat-\ning the following semester, eight of them were juniors at the\ncollege, and only one student was a sophomore. Finally, 80%\nof the participants had plans to attend graduate school at\nsome point in their future. This was a convenience sample;\nthe purpose of the survey was described to all students in the\nclass, and on the day of the final exam, the students were\ngiven the opportunity to complete the survey for extra credit\non the final. They were also told that if they chose not to\ncomplete the survey, they could sit quietly at their desks, and\nrequest an alternative extra credit assignment after class was\nover. The completed (or uncompleted) consent forms served\nas the method of assigning extra credit, or alternative extra\ncredit assignments. On the day of the final exam, 100% of\nstudents in the course provided informed consent to partici-\npate in a survey on cooperative and laboratory learning and\nreceived bonus points on their final exam.\nMaterials. The first set of Likert-type scale questions on the\nsurvey, which addressed students' perceptions of the effec-\ntiveness of laboratory learning, were adapted from Drouin's\n(2010) Formative Summative Assessment (FSA); partici-\npants were instructed to rate their responses on a scale of 1\n(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) to such items as\n\"The laboratory projects were a good way to practice key\nconcepts that we were learning in class.\" The second set of\nLikert-type scale questions on the survey, which addressed\nstudents' perceptions of the effectiveness of cooperative\nlearning, were adapted from a course evaluation survey\ndeveloped by Thompson et al. (2004); participants were\ninstructed to rate their responses on a scale of 1 (strongly\ndisagree) to 5 (strongly agree) to items such as \"every person\nin the group had an opportunity to share his or her ideas.\"\nFinally, based on a qualitative summary developed by Carl-\nsmith and Cooper (2002), students were asked to describe\ntheir thoughts, feelings, and/or observations about at least\nthree positive and three negative aspects of working in small\ngroups on the laboratory projects.\nDesign. The data for this study were collected using a survey\nmin for each student to complete. Twelve questions were\nLikert-type, close-ended scale questions, and the last two\nquestions on the survey were open ended. After the data were\ncollected, it was entered into Microsoft Excel, and the fre-\nquencies and means were calculated for each scale question.\nThe open-ended questions were organized into themes that\nfollowed the Halpern (2011) guidelines for cooperative\nlearning, which were used to structure the course.\nProcedure.A course in social research cross-listed in the\ncriminal justice, health care management and advocacy, and\npsychology majors was organized around the concept of lab-\noratory learning during a fall semester. The class met on\nMondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays with an extra session on\nWednesday afternoons for 14 weeks during which students\ncompleted eight laboratory projects in small groups through-\nout the semester. At the end of the course, students were\ngiven an opportunity to participate in an institutional review\nboard (IRB)-approved survey that elicited their feedback\nabout these laboratory sessions.\nThe course was structured so that students knew what to\nexpect each week. Monday and Wednesday mornings\n(Session I) were focused on discussing content and theory,\nincluding what they had learned from their reading for that\nweek. Wednesday afternoon (Session II) consisted of prob-\nlem-based laboratory assignments. Students were random-\nized into groups, ensuring that group membership was\ndifferent each week and students were able to work with each\none of their peers at least once. Students completed their\nlaboratory reports and forms rating each group member's\ncontribution (including their own), and submitted one labo-\nratory report as a group. On Friday, laboratory reports were\nhanded back and discussed, with the professor identifying\nand addressing any remaining issues with the material.\nAs an example of one laboratory project, in the unit on\nsurvey research, the entire class decided to construct a survey\non the everyday life of college students. Students were then\ndivided into groups of four, and each group wrote five survey\nquestions on one specific topic (i.e., athletics, the dorm, the\nlibrary, the classroom, and the dining hall) to be included in\nthe survey. Each group also hypothesized a relationship\nbetween two survey questions: one of their own questions and\none from another group. Every student in the class collected\ndata from five students at the institution, entered the survey\nresponses into one database, and analyzed the correlation\nbetween their hypothesized variables. In Study 1, the groups\nthen wrote and submitted one laboratory report together, and\nin Study 2, each student wrote an individual lab report. For a\nbrief description of each lab, see Table 1.\nResults and Discussion\nOverall, results showed that on an FSA, a 5-point Likert-type\nscale created by Drouin (2010), students enjoyed the struc-\nture of the labs (M = 3.75), found the labs useful (M = 4.10),\nand especially liked that the labs gave them an opportunity to\npractice and apply key concepts they were learning in the\nclass (M = 4.25; see Figure 1). On a 5-point Likert-type scale\nassessing their perceptions of cooperative learning\n(Thompson et al., 2004), students reported that they learned\nmore because they had the opportunity to explain things to\ntheir peers (M = 4.00), and felt that they completed the labs\nmore successfully together than they would have on their\nThe positive and negative comments provided by students\ncould easily be organized according to the guidelines set forth\nby Diane Halpern and used to design this course (see Table 2).\nTheir positive comments showed that students who would\nnormally be too shy to participate were given the opportunity\nto share their opinions and thoughts about the course material.\nThey also appreciated the opportunity to get acquainted with,\nand learn from, their classmates. Finally, they felt that the lab-\noratory projects allowed them to apply the information they\nwere learning in class, leading to a better understanding of the\nmaterial. In terms of the negative comments, students reported\nthat it was sometimes difficult to include everyone in the con-\nversation, and some of the laboratory project goals or instruc-\ntions were unclear. However, most of the negative comments\nwere related to individual accountability and conflict among\nTable 1.

Then, they identify their keywords, and summarize their findings.\nLab 5: Naturalistic\nobservation\nEach group proposes a study that will use naturalistic observation; when the proposal is approved by the\nprofessor, they complete observations, and together come up with three themes that emerged from\ntheir field notes. This is a two-part lab (taking place over 2 weeks).\nLab 6: Survey\nresearch\nThe class came up with a survey topic, and each group contributed a section of the survey (five questions\ntotal). Once the entire survey was compiled (by the professor or course apprentice), students\ncollected the data, entered it into Excel, and analyzed a correlation between one of their variables and\na variable from another group. In Study 2, students completed individual lab reports.\nExperimental\nresearch\nThe professor (or course apprentice) set up cups filled with different brands of soda. The students\nblindly tasted each brand and answered a series of survey questions. This was a within-subjects\nexperiment. Once the survey responses were compiled by the professor, each group was given one\nvariable on which to perform an analysis of variance. In Study 2, students completed individual lab\nreports. (Note: this is a twist on the original Pepsi Challenge in 1975; Bhasin, 2011).\nLab 8: Final project In Study 1, each student completed an article analysis. In Study 2, students chose their own group\nmembers and completed a research project.\nNote. IRB = institutional review board.\n4 SAGE Open\ngroup members; students felt that not all group members con-\ntributed equally and individual grades did not necessarily\nreflect that. Also, disagreement among group members was\ndifficult to solve due to conflicting personalities and level of\neffort. Finally, there were no comments, positive or negative,\nin terms of perceptions of the teacher as a facilitator, or coach,\nin the classroom.\nOverall, the data show that students embraced the labora-\ntory projects throughout this course. The structure of the\nlaboratory projects learned to better understanding of course\nmaterial, relationships with classmates, and opportunities to\nparticipate in class. However, there were also clear chal-\nlenges reported in the open-ended positive and negative\ncomments, in particular, the occasional lack of participation\nfrom peers, questionable fairness of individual accountabil-\nity, and conflict among group members.\nThe goal of Study 2 was to address the issues raised by stu-\ndents' open-ended responses from Study 1 in a subsequent\nsemester, keeping as many other elements of the original\ncourse structure, as well as the survey given at the end, as\nconsistent with Study 1 as possible.Afew important changes\nwere made in the structure of the course in an attempt to\nimprove students' perceptions of laboratory learning in\nresearch methods. Such changes included increasing the\nindividual accountability of each member in the small\ngroups, adding a course apprentice as another source of\nsupport to students in the class, clarifying the instructions\nand goals of the laboratory assignments, without changing\nthe content of each lab from one semester to the next, and\nfinally adding a more substantial final project that would\nallow students to choose their own groups and end the\ncourse on a positive lesson in cooperative learning.\nMethod\nParticipants. Twenty undergraduate students (47% female) in a\nsocial research course at a 4-year liberal arts college between\nThese students were enrolled in a research methods course at a\n4-year liberal arts institution that is required for all psychology,\nhealth care management and advocacy, and criminal justice\nmajors. In Study 2, 12 of these students were psychology\nmajors and eight were majoring in criminal justice. There were\nno health care management and advocacy students. When\nasked about their status at the college, 13 of them reported that\nthey were seniors, graduating the following semester; five of\nthem were juniors at the college; and two students were sopho-\nmores. Finally, 62% of the participants had plans to attend\ngraduate school at some point in their future. The sampling was\nidentical to Study 1. This was, once again, a convenience sam-\nple. After the purpose of the study was described to all students,\nthey were given the opportunity to complete the survey, or an\nalternative assignment, to count as extra credit toward the final\nexam grade. Eighty-one percent of the students in the course\nelected to complete the survey.\nMaterials.The materials used in Study 2 were exactly the\nsame as those in Study 1. The survey contained seven Likert-\ntype questions adapted from Drouin's (2010) FSA and five\nFigure 1.

(2004). Finally, students\nwere asked to describe at least three positive and three nega-\ntive aspects of working in small groups on the laboratory\nDesign.The design for Study 2 was also identical to the\ndesign for Study 1; the same study materials were used with\nno differences or changes made. These materials included a\n14-question survey that took students approximately 10 to 15\nmin to complete. Again, 12 questions were Likert-type,\nclose-ended scale questions, analyzed in Microsoft Excel,\nand the last two open-ended questions on the survey were\norganized into themes that followed the Halpern (2011)\nguidelines for cooperative learning.\nProcedure.As aforementioned, the goal of this study was to\nimprove the course, focusing on issues raised by students in\nStudy 1 while keeping all other elements consistent. Both\ncourses were taught on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays\nduring the fall semester; were of a similar size; and consisted\nof criminal justice, health care management and advocacy,\nand psychology majors. The lab assignments were very simi-\nlar throughout the semester, as was the general structure of\nthe course, and the same textbook was used for both courses.\nOnce again, Diane Halpern's guidelines for cooperative\nlearning were followed to anticipate issues and set up an\nenvironment that would encourage an understanding and\nacceptance of laboratory learning.\nA few changes were made to the course to address the\nissues raised in Study 1. At the conclusion of Study 1, stu-\ndents'negative perceptions of the laboratory-based approach\nto the research methods course rested mostly in the area of\nindividual accountability; they felt that individual grades\nwere unfair, and that some group members did not partici-\npate or contribute to the group in a meaningful way. As\naforementioned, improving the perception of cooperative\nlearning among students is a major goal of this research.\nTherefore, at the beginning of the next semester, the instruc-\ntor spent a significant amount of time emphasizing the value\nof cooperative learning in a research methods course. A sec-\ntion on cooperative learning was included in the syllabus,\nand most of the first class meeting of the semester was spent\nallowing students to create their own cooperative learning\ncontract. Each week, every member of every group received\nthe contract, read it, and signed it, agreeing to abide by its\nguidelines or receive a penalty in their grade. Finally, stu-\ndents completed individual lab reports for the three major lab\nprojects (naturalistic observation, survey, and experimental\ndesign) and were allowed to choose their own group for the\nfinal project based on their success (or failures) with the\ngroups they had formed during the semester.\nAnother area of concern from Study 1 was that there were\nno comments, positive or negative, in terms of perceptions of\nthe teacher as a facilitator, or coach, in the classroom. To\nimprove the perceptions of educator as facilitator, an upper-\nclassman who had performed very well in the course was\nmade a course apprentice as part of our Course Apprentice\nProgram (CAP). This way, there would be more than one\nleader in the classroom to facilitate learning and to support\nthe students both individually and in their groups.\nFurthermore, there was some confusion about the instruc-\ntions and overall goals for some of the laboratory assign-\nments, which may have led to some disagreements or\nineffective discussion among group members. To remedy\nthis, minor clarifications were made in the laboratory assign-\nments based on the previous semesters' suggestions.\nHowever, the content of the laboratory assignments was not\nchanged. For example, in Lab 2: Working with variables, the\ninstructor originally presented the students with two vari-\nables and instructed them to write a hypothesis, decide\nwhether the method used to test the hypothesis should be\nexperimental or non-experimental, identify the independent\nand dependent variables, and operationalize each variable.\nThis turned out to be too advanced for the students in week 2\nof the course, and different groups came up with different\nscenarios, so the answers were not standardized. Therefore,\nin the subsequent semester, the same research questions and\nvariables were presented to students, but the hypothesis\nstatement was already written out for them. That way, all stu-\ndents were working from identical hypotheses, rather than\nsome groups using one variable as the independent variable,\nand other groups using that same variable as the dependent\nvariable. They were then asked, from that hypothesis, to\nidentify the appropriate method, and the independent and\ndependent variables, and operationalize them.\nFinally, it seemed inconsistent to the goals of the course to\nmake the final project an individual article analysis when the\nrest of the laboratory projects had been completed in groups.\nTherefore, in Study 2, the final project was a study designed,\nconducted, analyzed, and presented in groups formed by the\nstudents based on their previous experience with students in\nthe class. This allowed the course to end on a positive note in\nterms of the amount of work that can be accomplished when\ncooperative learning is involved.\nResults and Discussion\nOnce again, results showed that students embraced labora-\ntory learning in the classroom. Responses on the FSA were\nvery similar between Studies 1 and 2. Students enjoyed the\nStudy 1), and especially liked that the labs gave them an\nopportunity to practice and apply key concepts they were\nStudy 1; see Figure 3). Although the responses on the FSA\nwere very similar between Studies 1 and 2, agreement with\ntwo of the statements on the perceptions of cooperative\nlearning scale was markedly higher. In Study 2, students\n6 SAGE Open\nagreed more with the statements that every person in their\ngroups had the opportunity to share their ideas (M = 4.18 in\nStudy 2, M = 3.60 in Study 1), and that they encouraged each\nother to contribute ideas within the group (M =4.24 in Study\n2, M = 3.25 in Study 1; see Figure 4). This may be explained\nby the changes that were made in the course between Study\n1 and Study 2, most importantly the addition of a course\napprentice to provide support for the students, the creation of\na cooperative learning contract signed by all the students in\nthe class, and the fact that students were allowed to choose\ntheir own group for the final project.\nFinally, the positive and negative comments provided by\nstudents were once again consistent with the guidelines used\nto organize the course (see Table 3). However, the comments\nfrom Study 2 were much more multifaceted, and there were\nmore positive comments than in Study 1. Once again, stu-\ndents felt that working together on hands-on projects lead to a\nbetter understanding of course material, and they appreciated\nthe opportunity to feel closer to, and learn from their class-\nmates. However, they also reported that sharing the workload\nhelped them to finish the assignments faster and more accu-\nrately, the new cooperative learning contracts increased indi-\nvidual efforts (but could be enforced more), and the structure\nof the class allowed students to improve their communication\nand teamwork skills. Also, including the course apprentice in\nthe class seemed to have led to an understanding of the teacher\nas a facilitator in the classroom. The course apprentice was\nseen as being available to answer questions when the teacher\nwas not, and peers were able to provide feedback when the\nteacher was unavailable or unclear.\nIn terms of negative comments, students reported that\nsometimes they were distracted or went off-topic in their\ngroup discussions, and it was difficult to work with students\noutside of class (on their final project) due to their busy sched-\nules and failure to communicate. Similar to Study 1, students\nalso reported that on some weeks (i.e., in certain groups) some\nstudents did not participate as much as others, and that because\nthe groups were always different, some personality types con-\nflicted and it was difficult to settle arguments.\nOverall, the data from Study 2 showed similar results to\nStudy 1, with obvious improvement on perceptions of labo-\nratory learning, and positive comments. However, there were\nalso the challenges presented by the occasional lack of par-\nticipation from peers and conflict among group members\npersisted.\nFigure 3. Mean students' evaluations of laboratory learning as\nmeasured by the Formative Summative Assessment in Study 2.\nFigure 4. Means for students' perceptions of the effectiveness of\nlaboratory learning in Study 2.\nTable 3. Positive (+) and Negative (-) Open-Ended Responses\nin Study 2.\nPositive interdependence\n + Working together allowed for more hands-on learning and\nbetter understanding of concepts\n + Sharing the workload led to faster and more accurate results\non the labs\n - With less structure, there were more opportunities for\npeople to get distracted or off-topic\nIndividual accountability\n \u00b1 Cooperative learning contracts increased effort in groups but\nshould be enforced more\n - There was a lack of participation among some group\nmembers (on some weeks)\nAppropriate assignment to groups\n + Opportunity to become closer to classmates, meet new\npeople, and make new friends\n - Groups were always different; some groups worked better\nthan others\nTeacher as facilitator\n + When the teacher was not available, the course apprentice\n(CAP) could answer questions\n + Peers explain things in a way that is different, and sometimes\nmore clear, than the teacher\n + Peers provided immediate feedback when the teacher was\nunavailable\nAttention to social skills\n + The structure of the class allowed students to work on\ncommunication and teamwork skills\n - There were sometimes personality differences among group\nmembers that caused arguments\n - It was difficult to work with group members outside of class\n(e.g., conflicting schedules)\nInteractive problem solving and discussion\n + Applying the information through the labs led to a better\nunderstanding of course material\n + Discussing with peers provided different perspectives, and\nothers to \"bounce ideas off of\"\nSummary and Concluding Discussion\nStudents in Study 1 and Study 2 seemed to appreciate the\ncooperative, problem-based, laboratory learning approach to\nresearch methods. Participants seemed to realize both the\nsocial and educational benefits of working with their peers\non difficult concepts within the course. However, the changes\nimplemented in Study 2 (e.g., the addition of a course appren-\ntice, the emphasis on the importance of cooperative learning,\nand the revision of laboratory projects to increase individual\naccountability) improved students' perceptions in a few\nimportant ways. First, students reported feeling slightly\ncloser to their classmates, had a little more enjoyment when\nworking with their peers, and more desire to complete labo-\nratory projects in other courses (see Figure 5). Second, every\nmean on the perceptions measure was higher, except for one;\nstudents did not report a better understanding of the material\nin Study 2 (see Figure 6). Perhaps the most striking improve-\nment occurred in the open-ended responses. Overall,\nresponses were much more positive, and multifaceted. This\nmight be an indication that students recognized and appreci-\nated more specific elements of the course than in Study 1. It\nmay also indicate, however, that the laboratory learning\nmodel adopted across the curriculum of the entire college is\nalso being viewed more favorably.\nThis study had a few strengths. First, in both studies, a\nhigh percentage of students in the class agreed to partici-\nevery reason to believe that their responses were open and\nhonest. Also, a majority of the students in each study had\nplans to attend graduate school (80% in Study 1 and 62% in\nStudy 2), so the success of this course was extremely rele-\nvant to this population. Furthermore, the idea for this proj-\nect came from a student who had taken the class, and was\nable to communicate her concerns, and those of her class-\nmates, from firsthand experience. Her contributions were,\nand continue to be, essential for the success of this project.\nFinally, using Halpern's (2011) guidelines for creating an\neffective cooperative learning environment provided an\nexcellent framework that was useful in setting up, main-\ntaining, and evaluating this classroom environment.\nThis study also had a few limitations. First, the results of\nthese studies are based completely on the subjective accounts\nof students in the class. Future studies should collect objec-\ntive data such as the effect on exams or overall grades when\nworking in groups versus working individually. Second, in\nboth studies, students were given the option to receive extra\ncredit in return for their participation. This may have\naffected their decision to participate, and could have biased\ntheir answers to the survey. Finally, occasional lack of par-\nticipation from peers and the conflict that may result from\nthis dynamic remain to be examined. It might have been\nuseful to ask for further elaboration on this, or suggestions\nfor improvement, to discern whether these were concerns\nspecific to this course or whether the bias toward individual\nwork over group work continued to persist.\nThe results of this study showed that a laboratory learning\nenvironment using cooperative, problem-based laboratory\ntechniques to teach an undergraduate social research course\nacross majors can be successful. Overall, students benefitted\nfrom the opportunity to learn from, and to teach their peers.\nThey also felt more comfortable contributing in small groups\nthan speaking up in front of the entire class, and applying the\nconcepts they were learning in class made them feel more\ncompetent with the course material. However, challenges\nremain. Groups continue to experience and struggle with\nsocial loafing and conflicting personalities among group\nmembers, even when students are randomly assigned to a\nnew group for each project. Further research should explore\nhow to form groups that will work well together and resolve\nconflict effectively, and to investigate whether these changes\ncan improve objective goals in the course, such as an increase\nin students' grades.\n"
