    "abstract": "Abstract\nWhite matter injury has been frequently reported in HIV\u00fe patients. Previous studies showed that HIV-1 Tat (transactivator of\ntranscription), a viral protein that is produced and secreted by HIV-infected cells, is toxic to young, immature oligodendro-\ncytes (OLGs). Adding Tat to the culture medium reduced the viability of immature OLGs, and the surviving OLGs exhibited\nreduced process networks. OLGs produce and secrete autotaxin (ATX), an ecto-enzyme containing a lysophospholipase D\n(lysoPLD) activity that converts lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a lipid signaling molecule that\nstimulates OLG differentiation. We hypothesized that Tat affects OLG development by interfering with the ATX-LPA\nsignaling pathway. Our data show that Tat treatment leads to changes in the expression of OLG differentiation genes and\nthe area of OLG process networks, both of which can be rescued by LPA. Tat-treated OLGs showed no change in LPA\nreceptor expression but significantly decreased extracellular ATX levels and lysoPLD activity. In Tat transgenic mice,\nexpression of Tat in vivo leads to decreased OLG ATX secretion. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments\nrevealed a potential physical interaction between Tat and ATX. Together, these data strongly suggest two functional\nimplications of Tat blocking ATX's lysoPLD activity. On one hand, it attenuates OLG differentiation, and on the other\nhand it interferes with the protective effects of LPA on OLG process morphology.\n",

This implies that toxic fac-\ntors released by previously infected CNS cells may inflict\nmore damage than the virus itself.\nOne candidate factor for HIV-induced white matter\ninjury is the HIV-1 viral protein Tat (transactivator of\ntranscription), which is a key component for efficient\ntranscription of the HIV genome. Tat has been shown\nto be continuously expressed and secreted by infected\nCNS cells and can be detected in the CSF (Wang et al.,\n2014) of HIV patients, even with cART (Johnson et al.,\n2013). Previously, we have reported that Tat significantly\ndecreases immature OLG viability (Zou et al., 2015).\nMoreover, Tat exposure also reduced the process net-\nwork formed by fine, branching processes that are typical\nat this stage, suggesting that Tat may also inhibit imma-\nture OLG differentiation.\nOLG development has been extensively studied and\nwell characterized both in vivo and in vitro. Newly\nformed oligodendroglial precursor cells (OPCs) migrate\nto their targeted destination to differentiate into pre-\nmyelinating OLGs, which ultimately evolve into mature\nOLGs and myelinate axons. It is also well established that\nOLG differentiation is controlled by the fine-tuning of\nboth intrinsic factors, such as transcriptional control\nand epigenetic regulation, and extracellular signals,\nincluding growth factors and mitogens (Zuchero and\ntein that has been shown to play a significant role in OLG\ndevelopment is autotaxin (ATX), also known as ENPP2,\nphosphodiesterase-Ia/ATX, or lysophospholipase\nD (lysoPLD). ATX is predominantly expressed and\nsecreted by OLG lineage cells (Fox et al., 2003; Zhang\net al., 2014) and has been shown to promote OLG devel-\nopment along the lineage via its two functional domains\ndomain, the modulator of OLG remodeling and focal\nadhesion organization (MORFO), was found to promote\nthe morphological maturation of OLGs (Dennis et al.,\n2008). The second domain, the enzymatic lysoPLD-\nactive site, generates the lipid signaling molecule lysopho-\nsphatidic acid (LPA; Tokumura et al., 2002; Umezu-Goto\ndifferentiation by epigenetically regulating the expression\nof OLG differentiation genes (Wheeler et al., 2015).\nSince both Tat and ATX affect immature OLGs, we\nhypothesized that Tat inhibits OLG differentiation by\ninterfering with the ATX-LPA signaling pathway. Our\nstudies showed that 18 hr Tat treatment led to a reduction\nin OLG process network area and in expression of the\nOLG differentiation genes, Ugt8 and Cnp. Although LPA\nby itself did not affect OLG morphology, it protected\nOLGs from Tat-induced process retraction, and rescued\ngene expression down-regulated by Tat. Tat also\ndecreased both extracellular ATX level and ATX's\nlysoPLD activity. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation\n(Co-IP) indicated a potential binding between Tat and\nATX, which may account for the reduced ATX secretion\nand lysoPLD activity. Together, these results suggest that\nTat may physically bind to ATX, inhibiting both ATX\nsecretion from OLGs and the extracellular lysoPLD\nactivity of ATX, and consequently, LPA signaling.\nDisrupting interactions between ATX and Tat may be a\npotential therapeutic strategy for protecting HIV patients\nfrom white matter injury.\nMaterials and Methods\nAll animal procedures were performed strictly in compli-\nance with protocols reviewed and approved by the\nVirginia Commonwealth University Institutional\nAnimal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\nTransgenic Mice\nFor in vivo Tat expression, a Tat-transgenic mouse line\nwas used as previously described (Bruce-Keller et al.,\n2008). In brief, expression of Tat was under the control\nof a tetracycline responsive element (TRE), which initi-\nates the transcription of the tat gene once it is bound by a\nprotein complex formed by the reverse tetracycline trans-\nactivator (rtTA) and doxycycline (DOX). Both the Tat\u00fe\nmice and their Tat\u00c0 littermates were genetically engin-\neered to express rtTA under the glial fibrillary acidic pro-\ntein promoter. As previously reported by our lab and\nothers, Tat mRNA can be detected in the CNS of Tat\u00fe\nmice within 48 hr DOX treatment (Bruce-Keller et al.,\n2008). Three-month-old Tat\u00fe transgenic mice and their\nTat\u00c0 siblings, regardless of sex, were fed with DOX-\ncontaining chow (6 g/kg) ad libitum for 10 days.\nPharmacological Compounds\nLPA (18:1; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in\nDMEM containing 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum\nand biotin-conjugated\nTat (biotin-Tat, ImmunoDx, LLC Woburn, MA) were\ndissolved in distilled water. In the experiments involving\npharmacological compounds, vehicle controls refer to an\nequal volume of the solvent that is used to dissolve the\ncompounds.\nATX-lysoPLD Activity Assay\nATX-lysoPLD activity was determined using a fluoro-\ngenic assay previously described (Ferguson et al., 2006;\nWheeler et al., 2015). In brief, primary OLG cultures\nwere grown in phenol-red-free media and treated with\nvehicle or Tat for 18 hr before supernatants were col-\nlected and concentrated (40\u00c2) via centrifugal filters\n(EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). The concentrated\n2 ASN Neuro\nsupernatants were then incubated with 2.5 mM FS-3 sub-\nstrate (Echelon Biosciences Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) at\n37C for 4 hr. Additionally, to determine whether Tat\ndirectly decreases ATX lysoPLD activity, conditioned\nmedium from untreated primary OLG cultures grown\nin phenol-red-free DMEM was concentrated (40\u00c2)\nsubstrate were added (Echelon Biosciences Inc., Salt\nLake City, UT) at 37C and incubated for 4 hr.\nChanges in fluorescence with time were measured at an\nexcitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wave-\nlength of 520 nm using a PHERAstar multimode micro-\nplate reader (BMG LABTECH Inc. Cary, NC.).\nRNA Isolation and Real-Time RT-qPCR Analysis\nIsolation of RNA from control and treated OLGs\n(Tat \u00c6 LPA) was performed as previously published\n(Wheeler et al., 2015). The following unmodified mouse\ngene-specific primer pairs were used:\nCnp:\nAtx:\nPgk1: (as reference gene):\nRT-qPCR reactions with at least two technical repli-\ncates per sample were performed on a CFX96 real-time\nPCR detection system (BioRad, Hercules, CA) using the\niQ SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad, Hercules, CA). PCR\nconditions were as follows: 95C for 3 min followed by 40\nFor all primer pairs, melting curves were used to ensure\nspecificity. Relative expression levels were determined\nusing the \u00c1\u00c1CT method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001).\nWestern Blot\nConcentration of proteins extracted from cultured OLGs\nwas determined using a BCA protein assay kit\n(ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Equal\namounts of protein samples were loaded on a Criterion\nprecast 4% to 20% gradient SDS gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules,\nCA), electrophoretically separated, and probed with anti-\nterase (CNPase; Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Bound\nprimary antibodies were detected with appropriate\nIRDye secondary antibodies (1:3000, Li-COR, Lincoln,\nNE), and imaged using an Odyssey Imager (Li-COR).\nProtein bands (sum of CNP1 and CNP2) were quantified\nusing Li-COR image studio software.\nPrimary OLG Culture\nImmature murine OLGs were cultured as previously\ndescribed (Zou et al., 2015). In brief, primary mixed glial\ncells isolated from brains of postnatal day 0 to 2 mouse\npups (CD-1, Charles River Laboratory, Wilmington,\nMA), irrespective of sex, were plated in Dulbecco's\nModified Eagle's Medium (DMEM; Life Technologies,\nCarlsbad, CA) supplied with fetal bovine serum (10%,\nThermo Scientific Hyclone, Logan, UT), glucose (6 g/L,\nSigma, St. Louis, MO), sodium bicarbonate (0.13%, Life\nTechnologies), and penicillin/streptomycin (1\u00c2, Life\nTechnologies). Culture medium was refreshed every\nother day. At day 8, O2A/glial progenitor cells were col-\nlected, as previously described (Zou et al., 2015), from the\nmixed cultures and replated on poly-L-lysine coated 12-\nwell plates or cover slips, at a density of 250,000 cells per\nwell or 15,000 cells per cover slip, and incubated in\nDMEM supplied with CNTF (10 ng/ml, Peprotech,\nRocky Hill, NJ), N-Acetyl Cystein (NAC; 5 mg/ml,\nSigma) and triiodothyronine (15 nM, Sigma) for 2 days\nto reach immature status before further experiments.\nTime-Lapse Imaging\nTime-lapse imaging of individual OLGs was performed\nas described by (Zou et al., 2011). In brief, OLGs were\ncultured in 12-well plates for 2 days before treatment with\nvehicle or Tat. Culture plates were then transferred to the\n) of a Zeiss Axio\nObserver Z1 system (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC,\nThornwood, NY). Individual OLGs were randomly\nWheeler et al. 3\nselected and imaged hourly for 18 hr then blindly ana-\nlyzed using the Zeiss Axiovision 4.8 software.\nImmunocytochemistry and Image Analysis\nO4 immunostaining was performed on live, unfixed cells.\nAll other immunostaining was performed after cells were\nfixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. O4 monoclonal anti-\nbodies (1:20, grown from hybridoma cells in our lab;\nKnapp and Hauser, 1996) were applied at room tempera-\nMillipore, Billerica, MA) was used to probe bound O4\nantibodies. All LPA receptor antibodies (Anti- LPAR1\n(Abcam), LPAR2, and LPAR3; Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX;\nLPAR4, Alomone labs, Hadassah Ein Kerem, Israel; and\nroom temperature for 1 hr, and corresponding secondary\nTechnologies). Antibody specific to ATX (Cosmo Bio,\nJapan) was also used at 1:1000 at room temperature.\nThe cell nucleus was stained with Hoechst 33342 dye\n(1:2000, Life Technologies). Images were taken on a con-\nfocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 700, Carl Zeiss,\nThornwood, NY) and processed using Zeiss Zen 2010\nsoftware. OLG morphology was assessed by determining\nthe overall process network (total O4+ area minus the\narea occupied by the cell body) as described previously\n(Dennis et al., 2008), but using ImageJ software (NIH).\nEvaluators were blinded to treatment groups.\nImmunohistochemistry\nThree-month old Tat\u00fe and Tat\u00c0 mice, both female and\nmale, were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde after they\nwere fed with DOX-containing chow for 10 days. The per-\nfused brain was dissected out and fixed with 4% parafor-\nmaldehyde overnight before washing three times in PBS and\nimmersed in 20% sucrose solution for 24hr. The brains\nwere then frozen in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek,\nTorrance, CA), coronally sectioned at 20mm thickness,\nand thaw-mounted onto Superfrost-plus slides (Fisher).\nThe sections were then immersed in acetone at \u00c020C for\n20min before they were washed with PBS and blocked with\nPBS containing 0.5% Triton and 5% cold fish gelatin\n(Electron Microscopy Science, Hatfield, PA) for 15min at\nroom temperature and probed with Rb anti-ATX (1:250,\nCosmo Bio, Japan) and Ms anti-APC (1:100, Millipore)\novernight at 4C. Images were taken on a confocal micro-\nscope (Zeiss LSM 700, Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) and\nprocessed using Zeiss Zen 2010 software.\nCo-Immunoprecipitation\nDynabeads Protein G (1.5 mg/50 ml, Life Technologies)\nwas first mixed with primary antibodies (5 mg):\nnon-specific mouse IgG (Abcam), mouse anti-V5\n(Abcam), rabbit anti-biotin (Abcam), or rabbit anti-\nATX (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) and washed\nthree times with PBS at room temperature. Concentrated\nsupernatant (500 ml) from a COS-7 cell line or primary\nOLG culture was mixed with 5 mg biotin-Tat and added\nto the Dynabeads-bound primary antibodies and gently\nrocked overnight at 4C. The next day, Dynabeads (with\nbound proteins) were washed three times at room tem-\nperature with PBS before being collected and then resus-\npended in loading buffer (2\u00c2 Laemmli buffer, Bio-Rad),\nheat denatured (95C, 5 min) and loaded (40 ml/sample) to\na 4% to 20% SDS-PAGE precast gel (Bio-Rad) for\nWestern blotting.\nStatistical Analysis\nOLG process network and Western blot of CNP were\nanalyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc\nBonferroni's testing (Figure 2(b) and 3(b)). Gene expres-\nsion (Figure 3(a), (c) and (b)) data obtained by RT-PCR\nwere analyzed using one-sample t test. Western blot of\nintracellular and extracellular ATX in cultured OLGs\n(Figure 5(b)), and quantification of ATX\u00feCC1\u00fe cells\nand extracellular ATX\u00fe pixels in Tat transgenic mouse\nbrain sections (Figure 6(b) and (c)), were analyzed using\nstudent's t test. Autotaxin lysoPLD activity assay was\nanalyzed using two-way ANOVA (treatment, time) fol-\nlowed by post hoc Bonferroni's testing (Figures 5(c), (d),\n6(a), and 7(d)). For all statistics, a p value .05 was con-\nsidered significant.\nResults\nTat-Induced Decrease in Immature OLG Process\nNetworks Is Reversed by LPA\nImmature OLGs exposed to HIV-1 Tat show significantly\ndecreased viability in vitro (Zou et al., 2015). In addition,\nsurviving cells exhibit abnormal morphology, indicating\nthat the differentiation of these cells is disrupted. To\ninvestigate the effect of Tat on the morphology of differ-\nentiating OLGs in more detail, immature OLGs were\ntreated with vehicle or Tat for 18 hr before morphological\nanalysis was performed. OLGs showed loss of fine,\nbranching processes starting as early as 4 hr following\nTat treatment, and ended up with significantly reduced\nprocess networks after the 18 hr experimental period\n(Figure 1).\nPrevious studies by Nogaroli et al. (2009) have shown\nthat the addition of LPA to maturing OLGs increased\nmembrane formation, and thus we examined whether\nLPA could reverse Tat-induced reduction of the\nOLG process network. Although the addition of 1\nor 10 mM LPA seems to promote OLG differentiation\n4 ASN Neuro\n(Figure 2(a)), it does not affect the total process network\narea of immature OLGs (Figure 2(b)). However, when\nadded concurrently with Tat, LPA protected cells against\nTat-induced process retraction.\nTat-Induced Reduction of OLG Differentiation Gene\nExpression Can Be Reversed by LPA\nWe next investigated whether Tat also affects the expres-\nsion of genes related to OLG differentiation such as, Cnp\n(UDP-galactose ceramid galactosyltransferase 8). CNP\nexpression is an early marker of OLG differentiation,\nand Ugt8 is responsible for the synthesis of galactosylcer-\namide, the major myelin glycosphingolipid (Kapitonov\nexpression of both Cnp and Ugt8 (Figure 3(a)). Since\nLPA protects against the negative effects of Tat on imma-\nture OLG process network area (Figure 2), we further\nexamined whether LPA rescues the reduced gene expres-\nsion in Tat-treated OLGs. Adding LPA concurrently with\nTat completely rescued the expression of Cnp and Ugt8\n(Figure 3(c)). Additionally, CNP protein levels reduced\nby Tat treatment could be rescued by the addition of LPA\n(Figure 3(b)). OLG expression of Cnp and Ugt8 has been\nreported to be regulated by the lysoPLD activity of ATX\n(Wheeler et al., 2015). However, qRT-PCR analysis\nshowed that Atx expression itself is in OLGs not affected\nby either Tat or LPA (Figure 3(a) and (c)).\nFigure 1. HIV-1 Tat decreases immature OLG process networks. Sample time-lapse images of immature OLGs treated with vehicle\u00c0 or\n100 nM Tat at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 18 hr. Tat treatment leads to decreased process network, especially after 4 hr, while process networks are\nstable or growing in vehicle-treated OLGs. (Arrows; Scale bar \u00bc 20 mm).\nWheeler et al. 5\nExpression of LPA Receptors Is Not Affected\nby Tat Treatment\nSince the effects of Tat on immature OLG morphology\nand differentiation gene expression can be rescued by\nLPA, we hypothesized that Tat interferes with the LPA\nsignaling pathway. To assess the LPA receptor (LPAR)\nexpression profile in our system, we performed immunos-\ntaining with antibodies specific to different LPARs in\nimmature OLGs. Results revealed the presence of\nFigure 2. LPA reverses the Tat-induced decrease in immature OLG process networks.

(b) Tat significantly decreased OLG process\nnetworks at 18 hr. LPA at 1 or 10 mM rescued the decreased OLG process network induced by 100 nM Tat. LPA by itself at both\nconcentrations has no effect on OLG process networks. (***p <.001 vs. 100 nM Tat; one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Bonferroni's\ntest, N \u00bc 4 independent experiments, !30 cells were counted for each N).\nFigure 3.

(a) qRT-PCR showed that\n18 hr Tat exposure decreased expression of Ugt8 and Cnp but had no effect on expression of Atx. (b) Western blot showed that 18 hr Tat\ntreatment decreased CNP levels in immature OLGs, which was also reversed by LPA. (c) qRT-PCR showed that Tat-induced decrease of\nUgt8 and Cnp expression can be rescued by adding LPA to medium. Concurrent addition of Tat and LPA also had no effect on Atx\nexpression.

Although ATX is a secreted protein,\nimmunostaining experiments showed that both vehicle-\nand Tat-treated OLGs are ATX positive, suggesting\nthat a portion of ATX is retained in the cytoplasm,\nwhich could represent the pre-pro-enzyme population of\nATX (Jansen et al., 2005; Figure 5(a)). Further studies by\nWestern blot showed that the total amount of ATX, col-\nlected from both OLG culture media (secreted) and cells\n(intracellular), was not altered by Tat treatment.\nHowever, Tat treatment altered the distribution of ATX\nby significantly increasing intracellular ATX and lower-\ning the level of extracellular ATX (secreted ATX)\nwhen compared with vehicle treatment (Figure 5(b)).\nFurthermore, media collected from OLG cultures treated\nwith Tat exhibited significantly decreased lysoPLD activ-\nity compared with vehicle-treated cultures (Figure 5(c)),\nconsistent with reduced ATX in the media. The reduction\nof lysoPLD activity in Tat-treated OLG media led to a\n$10% overall inhibition across all assay time points\n(Figure 5(d)).\nFigure 4. Expression of LPA receptors is not affected by Tat treatment. (a) Immunostaining detects LPAR1\u00ad4 and 6 on O4\u00fe immature\nOLGs (Scale bar \u00bc 10 mm).

The mean\nvalue for vehicle-treated OLGs was set to 100% (horizontal line), and values for Tat-treated cells were calculated accordingly. (One sample\nt test; N \u00bc 4 independent experiments).\nWheeler et al. 7\nExpression of Tat in vivo Inhibits OLG\nATX Secretion\nThe finding that Tat decreases extracellular ATX levels\nand lysoPLD activity in vitro led to further investigation\nof Tat's effects in vivo. Protein extracted from the whole\nbrain of Tat transgenic mice was used to assess the ATX\nlysoPLD activity in vivo. There was no significant differ-\nence in ATX lysoPLD activity between Tat\u00fe and Tat\u00c0\nmice (Figure 6(a)), suggesting that Tat expression does\nnot affect overall ATX expression and/or activity\nin vivo. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry experiments\nshowed significantly increased occurrence of cells that are\nboth CC1\u00fe and ATX\u00fe (Figure 6(b) and (d)) in the brain\nFigure 5.

Together, these data suggest that expression of Tat\nin vivo affects OLG ATX secretion\nPotential Physical Interaction Between Tat and ATX\nDecreases ATX Secretion\nIt has been well established that Tat can cross the plasma\nmembrane and enter the cytoplasm of several different\ncell types (Frankel and Pabo, 1988; Mann and Frankel,\nreduces the rate of ATX secretion from OLGs, both\nin vivo and in vitro, prompted the hypothesis that Tat\nmay interact with cytoplasmic ATX, and inhibits its\nsecretion. We first verified the ability of Tat to enter the\ncytoplasm of OLGs. Images taken by confocal micros-\ncopy showed cytoplasmic localization of biotin-\nconjugated Tat within 1 hr after Tat was added to the\nmedium (Figure 7(a)). To assess whether there exists a\npotential physical interaction between Tat and ATX, we\nperformed Co-IP using biotin-Tat and V5-tagged ATX,\ncollected and concentrated from the supernatant of a\nstably-transfected COS-7 cell line (Dennis et al., 2012).\nAs seen in Figure 7(b), V5-tagged ATX was detected in\nFigure 7. Potential physical interaction of Tat and ATX. (a) biotin-Tat was added to OLG culture media for 1 hr before immunostaining\nwas performed. Fluorescent microscopic images demonstrated that the majority of biotin-Tat was in the OLG cytoplasm and processes.\n(b) Concentrated supernatant collected from a stably transfected Cos7 cell line that secretes V5-tagged ATX was mixed with biotin-Tat,\nand immunoprecipitated (IP) with antibodies specific to V5 (left panels) or biotin (right panels) and processed for Western blot (WB)\nfor biotin (bottom panels) or V5 (top panels), respectively. Mouse IgG with no known specificity was used as negative control. While\nnothing was detected from msIgG precipitates, V5-tagged ATX was detected in anti-biotin precipitates, and vice versa. (c) Co-IP was\nalso performed using biotin-Tat and concentrated supernatant collected from primary OLG culture. ATX can be detected in anti-biotin\nprecipitates, but biotin-Tat can not be detected in anti-ATX precipitates. (d) Adding Tat to the supernatant collected from untreated\nprimary OLG cultures significantly decreased the ATX lysoPLD activity when compared with vehicle control (*p <.05, vs. Control;\ntwo-way ANOVA (Tat, Time) followed by post hoc Bonferroni's test, N \u00bc 4 independent experiments).\nanti-biotin precipitates and vice versa. As a control for\nnon-specific binding, neither V5-tagged ATX nor biotin-\nTat was detected in precipitates collected using a mouse\nIgG1 monoclonal isotype control (Figure 7(b)). It has\nbeen previously reported that ATX is synthesized as a\npre-pro-enzyme, whose N-term 27 amino acid residues\nare proteolytically removed before secretion (Jansen\net al., 2005). Since we used cell lines cultured in high\ndensity to harvest supernatants with high ATX concen-\ntration, and the antibody we used targets the C-term\nNUC domain of ATX, the two bands with different\nFigure 7(b) likely represent both the pre-pro-enzyme\nand the secreted ATX. To further verify the association\nbetween ATX and Tat in OLGs, the same Co-IP proced-\nure was performed using biotin-Tat and concentrated\nsupernatant collected from primary mouse OLG\ncultures. ATX was detected in anti-biotin precipitates\n(Figure 7(c)), indicating the existence of a potential phys-\nical interaction between ATX and Tat. Interestingly, in\nthe same experiment, biotin-Tat was not detected in anti-\nATX precipitates (Figure 7(c)), suggesting this interaction\nmay be disrupted by the binding between ATX and the\nanti-ATX antibody. Additionally, when Tat or vehicle\nwas added to the supernatant collected from untreated\nprimary OLG cultures, Tat significantly decreased the\nlysoPLD activity in the supernatant (Figure 7(d)).\nSince this experimental paradigm bypassed any potential\neffect on cells, this result suggests that Tat directly\ninterrupts the ATX lysoPLD activity, possibly due to\nits binding to ATX.\nDiscussion\nWhite matter injuries are frequently reported in HIV\npatients at all stages (Gongvatana et al., 2009; Zhu\nCNS has been known to maintain a population of OLG\nprecursor cells, which migrate to lesion sites upon injury\nand differentiate into myelinating OLGs to replace injured\nOLGs and regenerate lost, damaged myelin (Polito and\n2013). Interestingly, white matter injury persists when HIV\nRNA is undetectable in the CSF (Yilmaz et al., 2006;\nRagin et al., 2015). Our studies presented here show that\nHIV-1 Tat, which is continuously secreted by infected\nCNS cells, with or without viral replication, may physic-\nally interact with ATX. This interaction inhibits the secre-\ntion of ATX from OLGs and decreases extracellular ATX\nlysoPLD activity and subsequently, LPA production.\nSince the Tat-ATX interaction not only attenuates OLG\ndifferentiation, but also disrupts the protective effects of\nLPA on OLG process morphology, targeting this inter-\naction may be a therapeutic strategy to promote recovery\nof white matter injury in HIV patients.\nOLG lineage cells are targets of HIV-1 Tat.\nProliferation and migration of OLG precursor cells, via-\nbility of immature OLGs, morphology, and myelin-like\nmembrane production of mature OLGs have all been\nreported to be disrupted by Tat (Hauser et al., 2009;\nusing doxycycline-inducible Tat transgenic mice demon-\nstrated that in vivo expression of HIV-1 Tat for 7 days\nleads to significantly increased active caspase-3 expres-\nsion in O4\u00fe OLGs (Hauser et al., 2009). Follow-up stu-\ndies by Zou et al. (2015) further showed that 3-month\nexpression of HIV-1 Tat in the CNS causes significantly\ndecreased levels of myelin proteins MBP and MAG, and\nincreased occurrence of abnormal myelin structures. In\nthis study, our initial experiments found that immature\nOLGs that survived 18 hr Tat treatment exhibit a\ndecrease in process network area (Figure 1). It is also\nplausible that Tat alters the viability of these cells at\nthis stage represented by process retraction (Zou et al.,\n2015). Although LPA by itself does not promote process\noutgrowth, it protects against Tat-induced reduction of\nthe OLG processes network area (Figure 2).\nPreviously, we have reported that early OLG differen-\ntiation is regulated by gene expression changes down-\nstream of the ATX-LPA signaling axis (Wheeler et al.,\n2015). In this study, we found that Tat down-regulates\nOLG differentiation genes, Utg8 and Cnp (Figure 3),\nwhich can be rescued by the addition of LPA\n(Figure 3), strongly supporting the hypothesis that Tat\naffects OLG differentiation by interfering with the LPA\nsignaling pathway. Additionally, Atx gene expression\nin OLGs treated with Tat or LPA was not significantly\ndifferent from control (Figure 3), indicating that the LPA\nrescue of Cnp and Ugt8 gene expression was not attrib-\nuted to altered Atx expression.\nSince OLG Atx expression was not affected by Tat, we\nnext assessed whether Tat changes the expression of LPA\nreceptors. There are six bona fide LPARs, all of which are\nfound on mice OLGs, with LPAR1 being the most abun-\ndantly expressed (Zhang et al., 2014). Our experiments\nshowed that 18 hr Tat exposure did not affect the expres-\nsion of any of the known LPAR genes in OLGs. Thus, it\nis highly probable that the deteriorating effects of Tat on\nOLGs are mediated via altered LPA production, as a\nresult of decreased ATX lysoPLD activity, or an inhib-\nition in the secretion of ATX from OLGs, rather than\nLPAR expression.\nTat did not affect overall OLG Atx gene expression or\noverall abundance of ATX. However, our Western blot\nresults demonstrated a redistribution of ATX localiza-\ntion, with a lower amount of extracellular ATX, and a\nsignificantly higher amount of intracellular ATX in OLG\ncultures exposed to Tat (Figure 5(b)). This suggests that\nTat may inhibit OLG ATX secretion. Accordingly, Tat-\ntreated OLGs showed decreased extracellular ATX\nlysoPLD activity (Figure 5(c)). The extracellular ATX\nlysoPLD activity converts lysophosphatidylcholine\n(LPC) to LPA (Aoki et al., 2008), which has been\nshown to be the predominant source of extracellular\nLPA. Since LPA is needed for proper OLG development,\nreduced ATX lysoPLD activity may result in decreased\nLPA production, thus, leading to downregulated OLG\ndifferentiation gene expression. Hence, these results sug-\ngest a novel role for Tat in limiting the secretion of ATX\nfrom OLGs, thus reducing extracellular LPA production.\nATX lysoPLD activity was found unchanged in whole\nbrain homogenates of Tat\u00fe mice (Figure 6(a)). These pro-\ntein samples, however, could not distinguish intracellular\nand extracellular ATX, and these data are thus in line\nwith our in vitro findings, which showed that Tat treat-\nment does not change overall OLG ATX expression.\nFurthermore, and consistent with our in vitro results,\nimmunohistochemistry experiments showed that CNS\nexpression of Tat significantly increased the percentage\nof ATX\u00feCC1\u00fe cells and decreased extracellular ATX\nlevel (Figure 6(b)\u00ad(d)), suggesting that Tat reduces the\nsecretion of ATX from OLGs, and thus limits extracellu-\nlar ATX levels.\nIt has been reported that HIV-1 Tat contains a mem-\nbrane-penetrating sequence (amino acids 48\u00ad57), which\nenables it to translocate across the plasma membrane of\nvarious cell types (Mann and Frankel, 1991); however, it\nhas yet to be reported that Tat can enter the cytoplasm of\nOLGs. Due to the relative low affinity of most Tat anti-\nbodies, we used biotin-Tat to assess whether Tat enters\nOLGs and affects ATX secretion. Immunocytochemistry\nand confocal microscopy showed that biotin-Tat was\nfound clustered in the cytoplasm and major processes\nof OLGs within 1 hr after adding to the culture media\n(Figure 7(a)). Both Tat and ATX have been reported to\nphysically interact with other cellular components such as\nintegrin receptors (Hausmann et al., 2011; Urbinati et al.,\n2012), indicating the possibility of a protein complex\nformed by Tat and ATX and other cellular components.\nAlternatively and more speculatively, the crystal struc-\ntures of Tat and ATX reveal that both proteins contain\ncysteine-rich domains (Tahirov et al., 2010; Nishimasu\nof forming intermolecular disulfide bonds. We thus\nhypothesized that cytoplasmic Tat may bind ATX and\nlimit its secretion rate. Co-IP showed that biotin-Tat\nand V5-tagged ATX precipitated together (Figure 7(b)),\nindicating a potential physical interaction between Tat\nand ATX. Since the V5-tagged ATX used in the Co-IP\nwas collected from the supernatant of a stably transfected\ncell line, the concentration of ATX cannot be effectively\ndetermined and may exceed the physiological concentra-\ntion of ATX in vivo. To further validate this interaction\nbetween Tat and ATX in OLGs, Co-IP was also\nFigure 8. Proposed model for effects of Tat on immature OLG differentiation. In the CNS of HIV\u00fe patients, extracellular Tat, produced\nby productively infected cells such as microglia, enters the OLG cytoplasm and binds to ATX. This interaction between Tat and ATX may\nimpede ATX secretion and lead to reduced levels of extracellular ATX, and downregulated expression of OLG differentiation genes such as\nUgt8 and Cnp.\nperformed using ATX collected from supernatant of pri-\nmary OLG culture and biotin-Tat. In this setting, we\nfound that ATX can be precipitated by biotin-Tat but\nnot vice versa (Figure 7(c)). The anti-ATX antibody we\nused in this study recognizes and binds the C-terminal\nfragments of ATX. It is possible that this binding may\nalter the conformation of ATX, which disrupts the ATX-\nTat interaction. In this case, altered ATX conformation\nmay also lead to altered lysoPLD activity. Consistently,\nwe found that Tat significantly decreased the ATX\nlysoPLD activity when added directly to the supernatant\ncollected from untreated OLG culture (Figure 7(d)).\nAnother possibility is that the Tat binding site on ATX\noverlaps the antibody binding site, and thus was shielded\nby the bound antibody. Further studies are required to\nbetter characterize the binding site, affinity and stoichi-\nometry of the ATX-Tat interaction, as well as whether\nthis interaction requires additional adaptor proteins.\nTaken together, the studies reported here suggest an\ninjury mechanism where HIV-1 Tat expressed by infected\nCNS cells in HIV\u00fe patients enters the cytoplasm of neigh-\nboring OLGs, binds cytoplasmic ATX, and inhibits OLG\nATX secretion. Limited ATX secretion by OLGs reduces\nthe extracellular concentration of ATX and thereby\nreduces its overall ATX lysoPLD activity and the pro-\nduction of LPA, which consequently down-regulates\nOLG differentiation gene expression and compromises\nthe protective role of LPA against Tat-induced OLG\ninjury (Figure 8).\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The\nauthors gratefully acknowledge support from the NINDS:\nReferences\nAoki, J., Inoue, A., & Okudaira, S.
