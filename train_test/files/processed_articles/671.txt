The Gini index of inequality increased steadily after age 59,\nsupporting the hypothesis that within-cohort inequality increases in late life. However, a transition analysis found\nconsiderable mobility in relative statusfor individuals over a 15-yearperiod. These results suggest the need to develop\na longitudinal perspective on later-life economic status which distinguishes between individual-level and population-\nlevel outcomes and identifies the life events and characteristics of individuals thatpredict changes in economic status.\nFurther research is needed on the processes which lead to later-life inequality, and on the distributional impact of\npublic and private pension policies.\nECONOMIC well-being in later life is a central concern\nfor gerontological social policy and is the object of\nextensive income transfer and benefit systems. However, the\ndeterminants of economic well-being in later life, and the\ndistribution of outcomes which ensue, are insufficiently\nunderstood. It is generally accepted that mean income peaks\nin midlife and declines in late life, but analyses vary as to the\nage at which income peaks and the typical size of the\nsubsequent decline. An important question is whether eco-\nnomic inequality increases or decreases with advancing age.\nNo consensus exists with respect to this apparently straight-\nforward question (Crystal and Shea, 1990a), which we\naddress in this article with longitudinal data.\nUnderstanding income distribution among older Ameri-\ncans has a variety of important implications for policy.\nLater-life income distribution varies considerably among\ndeveloped countries (Smeeding, Torrey, and Rainwater,\n1993), and is shaped not only by the numerous vicissitudes\nof individual life events and choices, but also by policy\nchoices implicit in the design and regulation of retirement\nincome systems (Crystal, 1984). While working-age adults\nreceive most of their income from the labor market, most of\nthe income of older persons in the United States derives from\ntransfer payments aimed at assuring adequate retirement\nincome, funded either directly from governmental sources or\nfrom government-regulated, tax-advantaged private pension\nsystems. Individually purchased retirement accounts, also\ngovernment-regulated and tax-advantaged, play an increas-\ningly important role in the retirement income stream as well.\nPolicy decisions concerning the rules of public and private\nretirement income systems have important distributional\nconsequences; in making such decisions, information about\nthe net distributional impact of the present system as well as\nthe probable consequences of specific elements or changes\ntherein is an important starting point.\nReflecting public and legislative concerns about adequacy\nand equity of outcomes, the Social Security system incorpo-\nrates explicit \"leveling\" provisions which return a higher\npercentage of preretirement income, and a higher rate of\nreturn on contributions to the system, for lower-income\nworkers than for higher-income workers. However, cross-\nsectional analyses suggest that the effects of these mildly\nredistributive Social Security rules on total income are out-\nweighted by the unequalizing effects of other retirement\nincome sources (Crystal and Shea, 1990a). Considering the\nscale of governmentally sponsored or regulated income\ntransfers to older Americans and their cost to working-age\nindividuals, it is important to understand as much as possible\nabout issues of equity in the retirement income system and to\nunderstand the net pattern of financial outcomes it produces\nfor the older age group. Analyzing change in the level of\nincome inequality within a cohort as its members move from\ntheir working years to their retirement years provides a\npicture of the pattern of net outcomes produced by the\nretirement income system in later life, as compared to the\npattern of outcomes produced in midlife largely through the\ndirect consequences of the labor market. This article pro-\nvides distributional analyses at the aggregate level and anal-\nyses of transitions at the individual level; such analyses are\ncomplementary, providing different perspectives on later-\nlife outcomes. While needing to be supplemented by other\ninformation, income distribution outcomes are a significant\nand under-researched piece of the puzzle that needs to be\nassembled to adequately understand the impact of policy\nchoices on financial outcomes for older individuals.\nEmpirical estimates of income distribution in relation to\nage have varied, and are affected by a variety of conceptual,\nmethodological, and data choices and problems (Crystal,\n1986). Most published analyses of later-life economic well-\nbeing have relied on cross-sectional age comparisons, which\nconfound within-cohort trajectories and between-cohort dif-\nferences (Jianakoplos, Menchik, and Irvine, 1989). While a\nfew longitudinal studies have followed cohorts into at least\nthe earlier years of old age, there has been little use of such\ndata to estimate what happens to the level of inequality\nwithin a cohort as it ages. There has been somewhat more\nattention to the predictors of individuals' economic status at\ndifferent ages and of transitions in economic status, often\nacross relatively brief time spans. In one significant study,\nfor example, Leon (1985) analyzed the determinants of\nincome before and after retirement using Panel Study of\nIncome Dynamics (PSID) data, suggesting that preretire-\nment economic status is largely perpetuated in postretire-\nment status. Leon's analysis focused only on the year before\nand the year after retirement, with a sample of 285 house-\nhold heads who did not experience a change in household\ncomposition.\nLater-life economic outcomes for individuals involve a\ncomplex set of relationships over time among employment\nhistory, program structure and eligibility, and life events\nsuch as disability and widowhood. There is a shift of princi-\npal income sources from the labor market to public and\nprivate retirement income systems. The pattern of outcomes\nwhich ensues as these shifts take place reflects the structure\nof retirement income systems in interaction with the conse-\nquences of individual events and choices over the life\ncourse. In analyzing these outcomes, a number of studies\nhave taken an \"event-based\" approach to later-life eco-\nnomic status, focusing on the relationship between experi-\nencing a substantial decline in economic well-being in later\nlife (e.g., falling into poverty) and events such as retirement\nand the death of a spouse (Burkhauser, Butler, and Holden,\nappears to substantially increase the probability that an\nelderly woman will fall into poverty, but has less impact on\nthe risk of poverty for men. While public and private pension\nprograms often moderate the impact of retirement, dramatic\nincome changes sometimes take place at this time:\nBurkhauser and Duncan (1989) found that in 7 percent of\ncases, retirement is associated with at least a 50 percent\ndecrease in economic well-being. Changes in health status\nare also associated with downward changes in economic\nwell-being (Burkhauser, Butler, and Wilkinson, 1985).\n\"Event-based\" studies have been important in beginning\nto understand the impact of major life events on economic\noutcomes, and more such is needed. Less attention has been\npaid to change in overall income distribution within cohorts\nas they age. As a cohort progresses from midlife to late life,\nshifting from the labor market to the retirement income\nsystem as the principal source of income, does inequality\nincrease or decrease? Information on inequality is only one\nof the relevant criteria by which a nation's retirement income\ninstitutions can be evaluated; we also need to know more\nabout the types of income changes experienced by differ-\nently situated individuals and the way in which these\nchanges drive observed changes in income distribution.\nBefore interpreting within-cohort changes in income distri-\nbution, however, we need first to estimate these distribu-\ntional changes.\nResults of such analyses can shed light on the applicability\nof alternative theories of later-life income dynamics. Be-\ncause of the important role of Social Security pensions in the\nretirement income stream, it has often simply been assumed\nthat post-retirement economic resources are more equally\ndistributed than those before retirement age. A theoretical\nperspective with different implications, the \"aged heteroge-\nneity\" perspective, notes that in the latter part of the life\ncycle, aging is associated with a tendency to increased\nheterogeneity with respect to a wide variety of psychologi-\ncal, social, biological, and other characteristics (Dannefer\nand Sell, 1988). This would suggest that economic differ-\nences as well might tend to increase in later life, at least in\nthe absence of strongly redistributional policies. Thus, it is\nnot clear a priori what the net effect of aging on income\ndistribution in later life would be expected to be. Empirical\nstudies have variously characterized the process as one of\nLeon, 1985), and cumulative advantage/cumulative disad-\nThe leveling hypothesis posits that the increased later-life\nrole of public benefit programs is particularly beneficial to\nlower-income individuals and leads to a narrowing of the\nincome distribution. Fuchs (1984), for example, stated that\n\" . . . income is more equally distributed after age 65 than\nbefore that age. . . . The principal reason for the narrowing\nof inequality after age 65 is that Social Security benefits\nbecome more important and labor income less important,\nand the former is distributed much more equally than the\nlatter.'' Hurd and Shoven (1985), using data from the Social\nSecurity Administration's Retirement History Survey, re-\nported that during the 10 years of the survey, \" . . . real\nincome of the lower tail of the distribution has increased.\nThis is due to the sharp increase in SSI, Medicare, and Social\nSecurity for this population. . . . \" This finding appears to\nresult in significant part from the study's attribution of the\nper capita cost of Medicare to each individual as though it\nwere cash income, an approach which is controversial (Rad-\nThe \"status maintenance\" position was articulated by\nHenretta and Campbell (1976). Based on findings from a\nrepeated cross-section (\"pseudo-cohort\") analysis, they ar-\ngue that \" . . . the factors which determine income in retire-\nment are the same ones that determine income before retire-\nment.\" A \"status maintenance\" interpretation would\nsuggest that retirement income institutions perpetuate indi-\nviduals' preretirement relative economic status, and would\npredict a relatively limited degree of turnover in relative\nposition. The prediction of a \"status maintenance\" position\nas to the overall extent of inequality in the later-life income\ndistribution is not entirely clear; the assertion that the relative\nstatus of individuals is maintained, with the same factors\npredicting preretirement and postretirement status, would\nappear to be consistent with either narrowing or widening of\nthe income distribution.\nThe cumulative advantage/cumulative disadvantage hy-\npothesis suggests that some effects of early head starts and\nhandicaps may cumulate over the life span through a variety\nof mechanisms; for example, \"better\" jobs may be even\nmore sharply distinguished from \"worse\" jobs by their\nbenefits than by their salaries (Crystal and Shea, 1990a). To\nthe extent that these effects outweigh any redistributional\neffect of Social Security and means-tested benefits, this\nwould predict an increase in the overall level of economic\ninequality within a cohort as it ages. A \"cumulative advan-\ntage\" position would imply that individuals with economic\ndisadvantages that begin early in the life course, such as\nlimited education or minority-group membership, would not\non average improve their relative or absolute economic\nposition in later life. However, such a view is not necessarily\ninconsistent with turnover in the income distribution. For\nexample, a scenario in which modestly paid teachers and\nministers with good pension plans were to improve their\nrelative position after retirement, where commercial fisher-\nmen and welders without pension plans were to experience\ndeclines, would be entirely consistent with a \"cumulative\nadvantage\" model.\nIn characterizing the dynamics of economic well-being in\nlater life, an important and often-neglected conceptual dis-\ntinction is between individual and population dimensions of\nthe process. Collectively, the dispersion of income may\ndecrease, stay the same, or increase as a cohort ages. An\nentirely distinct question is the extent to which individuals\ndo or do not maintain their relative positions within the\ndistribution. Addressing this question requires data which\nfollow individuals over time. The distinction between indi-\nvidual and population dimensions of income dynamics can\neasily be missed in interpreting studies based on cross-\nsectional data. For example, findings by Henretta and Camp-\nthat such social background characteristics as education are\nas predictive of income after age 65 as before do not directly\naddress the question whether individuals remain at the same\nrelative economic status position, although Henretta and\nCampbell interpreted such findings as implying \"status\nmaintenance.\"\nWhile longitudinal data are essential to a satisfactory\nunderstanding of later-life income dynamics, such data are\nscarce, expensive to collect, and suffer from problems of\ntheir own such as sample attrition. Thus, most work on\nincome distribution in relation to aging has utilized cross-\nsectional data. Some cross-sectional studies have shown that\nincome inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, is\nhigher for older individuals than for younger age groups\nleveling hypothesis. Crystal and Shea (1990a), for example,\nconstructed a measure of economic well-being that took\naccount of household composition, assets, and underreport-\ning of some income types, using data from the 1984 panel of\nthe Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). In\nthis cross-section, inequality decreased with age up to ages\n35-44 and increased with age at older ages, with a Gini\ncoefficient of .415 at ages 75 + . These high levels of\ninequality are a concern since they suggest that despite mean\nincomes for older Americans which compare favorably with\nthose of nonelderly persons (Crystal and Shea, 1990b), those\nelderly persons in the lower part of the income distribution\nshare in this bounty only to a very limited extent; at ages\n75 + , the less well-off 40 percent snared less than 15 percent\nof their age group's total income.\nSince elderly and nonelderly individuals in this study were\nmembers of different birth cohorts, however, one cannot\nunambiguously attribute cross-sectionally observed differ-\nences to age rather than to cohort effects. The older individ-\nuals among whom observed inequality was higher may\nrepresent a \"high-inequality cohort,\" characterized by a\nhigh Gini coefficient at earlier ages as well. Further, the\ncomparison of population distributions by age tells us noth-\ning about the stability of relative position for individuals. An\nadditional problem is the effect of differential survival on\nincome distributions by age. If, for example, individuals in\nthe upper and lower extremes of the distribution were more\nlikely to survive than those in the middle, differential mortal-\nity might account for an apparent increase in inequality with\nage. In cross-sectional studies, one cannot observe and\ncorrect for the effects of differential survival, since it is\nunknown which of the individuals observed at younger ages\nwill survive to older ages.\nDespite these methodological problems with analyses\nfrom cross-sectional data, however, such work, along with\nstudies suggesting that income inequality among older per-\nsons in the U.S. is substantially higher than is the case in\nmost developed countries (Smeeding, Torrey, and Rainwa-\nter, 1993), leads us to hypothesize that inequality within a\ncohort will increase with age as the cohort moves from\nmidlife to later life. This hypothesis is also consistent with\nthe \"aged heterogeneity\" perspective suggested by Danne-\nfer and Sell (1988) and discussed above. In a similar vein, it\nhas been suggested by some economic theorists that the\npermanent income hypothesis, predicting that consumption\nand income from year to year follow a \"random walk\"\npattern, implies that economic inequality should grow with\nage (Deaton and Paxson, 1994). This theoretical perspec-\ntive, like the more sociological and epidemiological \"aged\nheterogeneity\" perspective suggested by Dannefer and Sell\n(1988), focuses on the effects of individual life-course\nevents over time, suggesting that the effects of luck will tend\nto lead to increasing differences. Linking such perspectives\nwith analyses of retirement income policies, the \"cumula-\ntive advantage\" model suggested by Crystal and Shea\n(1990a) would suggest that in the absence of strongly redis-\ntributive retirement income institutions (such as high mini-\nmum Social Security benefits), the vicissitudes of life events\nwould lead to higher inequality in later life. Research on the\ndistribution of income from non-public retirement income\nsystems such as private pensions suggests that these income\nsources tend to be received disproportionately by more\nadvantaged members of the labor force (Crystal, 1984), also\nsupporting the hypothesis that inequality may increase\nwithin a cohort as it enters its later years.\nIn order to adequately test this hypothesis, long-term\nlongitudinal data are required. In the present analysis we use\ndata from the National Longitudinal Survey of Older Men\n(NLSOM) to characterize income and inequality trajectories\nfor three 5-year cohorts of men followed from midlife to late\nlife. We also use these data to investigate the extent of\nmovement of individuals within the income distribution over\nan extended (15-year) period of time.\nMETHODS\nData and Measures\nBaseline interviews for the NLS Older Men cohort were\n59 in that year. The survey used a multi-stage probability\nsample designed to represent the civilian noninstitutiona-\nlized population of the United States for men of the specified\nages and their households (Parnes, 1981). Respondents were\ndrawn from 235 primary sampling units representing every\npersonal interviews on income during the previous year.\nRepresenting a 15-year span of ages at baseline, the respon-\ndents were divided for analytic purposes into three 5-year\ncohorts, each followed for a 15-year period. The overlap-\nping trajectories of these three cohorts provide a perspective\nwhich extends from ages 45-49 (Cohort 1 at baseline) to\nThe basic measure of income in the NLSOM data is\nfamily income of sample individuals. Use of family income\nto measure economic status requires an adjustment for the\nnumber of individuals who must share that income. An\nadjustment that is sometimes used is to divide family income\nby the size of the family to obtain per capita family income.\nHowever, this approach does not consider economies of\nscale in household expenses. A two-person home does not\nneed twice as many kitchens, refrigerators, or square feet as\na one-person household. We use a fairly standard poverty\nline (Orshansky scale) based adjustment which is intermedi-\nate between no adjustment and per capita family income\nment factor is calculated by taking the ratio of the poverty\nlevel for a given household's size to that of a one-person\nhousehold.\nA potential problem in the analysis is top-coding.

In order to exclude the possibility\nthat our results are artifacts of top-coding, we also performed\nsimilar analyses using a number of other measures of in-\nequality that are unaffected by top-coding at these levels,\nwith similar results.\nSurvey attrition and item nonresponse are a substantial\nproblem in longitudinal surveys of such long duration, and\nthe NLSOM is no exception. Our measure of income could\nbe missing for two reasons: item nonresponse or unit nonre-\nsponse (respondent not interviewed at a particular wave).\nItem nonresponse occurs when a respondent fails to answer\nthe questions regarding family income or family size (both of\nwhich are necessary in order to calculate our measure of\nfailed to report family income or family size. The number of\nmissing values due to noninterview increased as time went\n60 percent of all missing observations were due to the death\nof the respondent.\nIn order to assess and mitigate potential biases caused by\nunit or item nonresponse, we have computed the results\nseparately for two samples, \"survivors\" and \"everyone.\"\nIn the \"survivors\" analysis, we drop any observation that\nhas a missing value at the first or last observation (that is,\nvalues could arise due to either attrition or item nonresponse,\nsome observations dropped from the survivors sample are\ndue to item nonresponse in 1966. In the \"everyone\" analy-\nsis, the results for a given period represent all of the data\navailable for that period.\nTo the extent that changes in the composition of the\n\"everyone\" sample match the changes in the population,\nthe \"everyone\" sample will provide a good estimate of\ninequality changes at the population level. Therefore, the\nresults from the \"everyone\" sample are the most relevant\nfor understanding income adequacy and needs within the\npopulation actually surviving to the 65 + age. However, if\nattrition and item nonresponse in the \"everyone\" sample\ndiffer substantially from changes in the true population, then\nour estimates of income inequality could be subject to the\ncriticism that they are caused by these changes in the sample\nover time. Therefore, we also present results from the\n\"survivor\" sample since the \"survivor\" sample, for the\nmost part, follows the same individuals over time and, thus,\nmeasures changes in the distribution of income of this\n\"fixed\" sample. The \"survivor\" analyses filter out the\neffects of differential mortality or loss-to-followup on in-\ncome distribution within a cohort over time. The major aim\nof analyzing inequality trends in both ways is to determine\nwhether these observed trends are robust with respect to\nalternative definitions of the population in question. If\nresults are similar in both kinds of analyses, as they turn out\nto be, the inference is strengthened that there is a true within-\ncohort increase in inequality over time, which is not ac-\ncounted for simply by compositional change in the cohort\nand which describes the level of inequality among those\nsurviving to various ages.\nMeasurement of Income Inequality\nMeasures of income inequality are essentially dispersion\nmeasures of the distribution of income. Most analyses of\nincome inequality rely on single-value measures such as the\ncommonly used Gini coefficient, since measures that cannot\nbe summarized by a single value provide only an incomplete\nranking of income distributions. The measurement of in-\ncome inequality involves a number of problems. The con-\ncept of inequality has been operationalized in several differ-\nent ways, with the Gini coefficient one of the most widely\nused. Unlike quintile-based measures, which are also com-\nmonly used, the Gini coefficient is independent of the units\nused to measure income. Any mean-preserving spread ap-\nplied to a distribution will cause the Gini coefficient for that\ndistribution to increase.\nAnalyses utilizing Gini coefficients have often lacked\nconfidence intervals or hypothesis tests for differences in\ncoefficients, since these calculations are somewhat difficult\n(particularly for weighted data, which do not necessarily\nrepresent a well-defined distributional form). Even though\nvariance estimators for the Gini coefficient from unweighted\ndata have long been available (Glasser, 1962; Hoeffding,\n1948), tests relating to the sampling distribution of the Gini\ncoefficient are, according to Yitzhaki (1991), \"seldom\"\nperformed due to the complexity of the variance estimators.\nIn the present study, we used a bootstrap resampling method\nto perform rank tests on the estimated Gini coefficients. This\nprocedure also addresses the possibility that estimates are\nsensitive to measurement error at the extremes of the distri-\nbution. If a small number of observations have a large\nimpact on the Gini coefficient calculation, the resampling\nmethod will detect this by estimating a wider sampling\ndistribution for the coefficient. The present study uses sam-\nples of quite substantial size and, as will be noted, most\nobserved differences are statistically significant.\nEstimation of Gini coefficients and their confidence inter-\nvals with this data set must take account of the weighted\nsampling in the NLS. Let i = 1,. . . , k index individual\nobservations in the data such that the data are in ascending\norder by income (k denotes the number of observations). The\nincome and sampling weight for the ith observation are n,\nand wif\nrespectively. The formula for the Gini coefficient for\nweighted data can be written as\nWhen the sampling weights w, are constant across observa-\ntions, the above expression reduces to the formula for the\nCowell (1989) provides an unbiased estimator for the Gini\ncoefficient calculated from a weighted sample. However,\nNygard and Sandstrom (1989), in a Monte Carlo comparison\nof explicit variance expressions and resampling estimates of\nthe sampling distribution of the Gini coefficient, find no\nstatistical basis to prefer either technique. In this application,\nwe opted to use a resampling technique for hypothesis\ntesting on the estimated Gini coefficient. A bootstrap sample\nwas constructed by randomly sampling with replacement\nfrom the original sample until the sum of the weights in the\nbootstrap sample was (approximately) equal to the sum of\nthe weights in the original sample. A Gini coefficient was\nthen calculated from the bootstrap sample. We repeated this\nficients is an empirical estimate of the sampling distribution\nof the Gini coefficient from the original sample and is used to\ntest the significance of differences in coefficients from one\nwave to the subsequent wave. A rank test is used to evaluate\nthe hypothesis that the two empirical distributions were\ndrawn from the same underlying distribution. Let F, and F2\nrepresent the cumulative distribution functions of the two\nsampling distributions. The test assumes that F,(x) =\n(x + a). The null hypothesis is that a = 0, and the alterna-\ntive hypothesis is that a =\nA potential weakness of the Gini coefficient is its sensitiv-\nity to changes in the tails of the distribution. Such sensitivity\nmay be a problem if the data are top-coded or if there is\nmeasurement error in the tails. To demonstrate that our\nconclusions are robust, we confirmed our results with similar\nanalyses using three other measures of income inequality:\nthe coefficient of variation, the lower quartile of income as a\npercentage of the upper quartile, and the interquartile range\nas a percentage of the lower quartile. While the coefficient of\nvariation is sensitive to small changes in the tails of the\ndistribution, our other two measures will be unaffected.\nTo help inform our analysis of income inequality, we\npresent a number of results relating to the degree of individ-\nual mobility within the distribution of income. While related\nto inequality, high degrees of mobility can persist in the\npresence of increasing, decreasing, or constant inequality.\nFor example, if two individuals switch incomes, then in-\nequality remains unchanged but mobility exists within the\nincome distribution.\nRESULTS\nFigures 1 and 2 report average real adjusted income by\ncohort. Figure 1 depicts the results for the \"everyone\"\nsample, and Figure 2 depicts the results for the \"survivors\"\nsample. The \"survivors\" group includes all individuals with\nnonmissing observations of income at the first and last wave.\nFor the \"survivors'' group the sample size is the same for the\nfirst and last wave for each cohort, but at the second and third\nwaves the sample sizes are slightly smaller. This occurs\nbecause some of the individuals with nonmissing observa-\ntions at the first and last waves have missing values on the\nintervening observations. In the \"everyone\" sample all of\nthe nonmissing observations in a given wave were used to\ncalculate the average. The sample sizes in the \"everyone\"\nanalysis are substantially larger than in the \"survivors\"\nanalysis.\nyears of age for both \"survivors\" and \"everyone.\" For\ncohort 3 adjusted real income peaks at 60-64 years of age.\nThis difference in the peak earning years may be due to a\nperiod effect. Note that cohorts 1 and 2 had large increases in\naverage income from the first to the second observations\nwas one of strong real income growth in the United States,\nwhich may have resulted in a later age peak for the oldest\ncohort.\nIncome Distribution\nWithin each cohort, Gini coefficients were calculated at\neach wave. Because of the identification problem among\nage, cohort, and year of observation (any two of these define\nthe third), it is not possible to identify age, cohort, and year\neffects on the level of inequality unambiguously and simul-\ntaneously. However, one can make comparisons with such\ndata two dimensions at a time: in particular, one can com-\npare the level of inequality within each cohort as it reaches\ndifferent ages, and one can compare the level of inequality\nby age group at each time of observation. For survivors,\nthese results are depicted in Figure 3. Because we wished to\ntest the hypothesis that inequality within each cohort in-\ncreased as the cohort aged, we focused particularly on\ncomparing within-cohort inequality as the cohort reached\ndifferent ages (reading down the columns of Figure 3).\nHowever, since each 5-year cohort was observed at 5-year\nintervals, the results form a matrix which can also be read\n- Cohort 3\n- Cohort 1\n\u00b7 Cohort 2\n- Cohort 3\nAge\nacross (comparing cohorts with respect to inequality at a\ngiven age), or diagonally (showing cross-sectional compari-\nsons by age at each year of observation). Read diagonally, as\nindicated by the shading, Figure 3 shows a higher level of\ninequality among older respondents; this pattern was ob-\nserved at each time of observation. For example, in 1980 the\nsectional comparisons both for \"survivors\" and for \"every-\none' ' indicate that the Gini coefficient was higher at the older\nages, at each time of observation, consistent with the cross-\nsectional findings reported by Crystal and Shea (1990a)\nusing SIPP data.\nReading across the rows of Figure 3, we can compare\ncohorts with respect to the level of inequality experienced at\nthe point that the cohort reaches a given age (which was\nattained at different calendar years by each cohort). At ages\ncohorts, the level of inequality was higher in the oldest than\nin the youngest 5-year cohort, with the middle cohort experi-\nencing an intermediate level of inequality. At ages 65-69,\nwhere we can compare the older two cohorts, there was\nessentially no difference between them (Gini coefficients of\nWhen within-cohort change in income distribution was\nexamined, a pattern of increasing inequality over time was\nevident, both in \"survivors\" and in \"everyone\" analyses.\nFigures 4 and 5 provide a graphic depiction of the \"trajec-\ntory of inequality,\" as indicated by the Gini coefficients\nwithin each cohort as the cohort aged.

In the \"survivors\" analysis of the oldest cohort, for\nexample, the coefficient increased from .391 at ages 55\nthat inequality did increase within each cohort as it aged.\nIn order to test for significant differences between the Gini\ncoefficients, an empirical sampling distribution of 1000\nresamplings was constructed for each Gini coefficient pre-\nsented in Figures 4 and 5 using the bootstrap technique\ndiscussed above. We then used a rank test to evaluate\nchanges in income inequality over time for each cohort. We\nalso tested for differences in income inequality across co-\nhorts at each time period and at each age. The null hypothe-\nsis that there is no change was rejected in every case (at a\n95% level) except in the comparison of the \"everyone\" Gini\nWe also measured inequality using the coefficient of\nvariation, the lower quartile of income as a percentage of the\nupper quartile, and the interquartile range as a percentage of\nthe lower quartile.

For instance, in the survivors\nsample the interquartile range as a percentage of the bottom\nIndividual. Mobility\nTo understand the implications of these patterns of in-\nequality over time, it is also important to determine the\nextent of individual mobility within the income distribution.\nStudies of such shifts have often focused on the proportion of\ncases which experience transition from one status to another,\nsuch as from nonpoor to poor. It is useful, however, to\nutilize approaches which distinguish large changes from\nsmall ones and which provide information on the size of\nshifts. The median size of transitions upward and down-\nward, and the probability of transition from one income\nquintile to another, provide complementary perspectives on\nthe extent of income mobility. Table 1 shows the number of\ncases experiencing increases and decreases in income among\nsurvivors in each cohort as the cohort aged by 5-year incre-\nments, and the median size of the changes.

Changes in income from ages 60-64 to ages\ntwice as likely to be downward as upward, and downward\nchanges tended to be somewhat larger than upward changes.\nIn Table 1, even a small increase or decrease counted as a\npositive or negative change. However, the typical magni-\ntude of changes was substantial: the median absolute per-\ncentage change in real income ranged from 27 percent to 41\npercent, with the largest changes occurring as individuals in\nWhile Table 1 illustrates changes in real income, which\nreflect both the changing fortunes of the cohort and move-\nment within it, Tables 2 and 3 focus on individual shifts\nwithin each cohort's income distribution, that is, change in\nstatus relative to one's peers. Shifts were computed for 5-\nyear, 10-year, and 15-year periods. Table 2 shows the matrix\nof transition probabilities, for the full 15-year period, from\none quintile in the income distribution to another.\nQuintiles are numbered from 1 (best-off) to 5 (worst-off);\nbaseline quintiles are defined on the basis of an individual's\nadjusted family income in 1965, and ending quintiles are\ndefined on the basis of an individual's adjusted family\nincome in 1980. Rates of transition were substantial. In\nCohort 1, for example, members of the poorest quantile at\nbaseline had a 46.6 percent chance of being in the poorest\nquintile in 1980, so that more than half had shifted from this\ndisadvantaged position. Probabilities along the diagonal of\nthe matrix correspond to no change in quintile. Except for\nthe upper left-hand comer and the lower right-hand comer of\neach matrix, the probabilities along the diagonal are gener-\nally less than .30. That is, if an individual was in either the\nsecond, third, or fourth quintile at the baseline observation,\nthen he had less than a 30 percent probability of being in the\nsame quintile at the last observation. The higher stability\nrates in the upper left-hand and lower right-hand are in-\nfluenced by ceiling and floor effects, i.e., movements from\nthe best-off quintile can only be downward and vice versa.\nIn order to show 5-year as well as 15-year patterns of\ntransition and to distinguish transitions to adjacent quintiles\n(which could be caused by small shifts) from larger changes,\nTable 3 collapses the transition matrix to show the probabili-\nties of a change upward or downward of more than one\nquintile. Such changes represent sizable movements in rela-\ntive position within the distribution of income.

The first three columns of Table\n3 label the quintile at the beginning of the transition and\nprovide the sample sizes. The last four columns of the table\npresent the results; the dates across the top label the period of\ntransition.

When\nmovements from the highest and lowest quintile are corn-\nTable 2.

However, in the last\ntransition period, from an average age of 65 to an average\nage of 70, more individuals in the lowest quintile substan-\ntially improved their position than individuals in the highest\nquintile moved downward.\nDISCUSSION\nVariations in age of retirement, pension coverage, health\nand marital status, and many other intervening variables\nshape the distribution of later-life economic outcomes and\nthe distribution of income in later years. Through this re-\nsearch we aim to characterize the overall extent of inequality\nand mobility within the income distribution that is the net\nresult of these processes in later life. The results support the\nhypothesis that income distribution within each cohort in-\ncreases as the cohort passes into later life. This pattern was\nfound both in \"survivors\" and \"everyone\" analyses, sug-\ngesting that the pattern is robust and that the increase is not\nsimply the result of changes in cohort composition such as\ndisproportionate mortality at the extremes of the distribu-\ntion. The high level of economic inequality in later life and\nthe pattern of increase with age suggest that there may be a\nneed to reexamine the degree of protection which retirement\nincome policies provide to less-advantaged elderly individ-\nuals and to those who experience adverse life events that can\nthreaten their economic well-being.\nOver this relatively restricted range of cohorts, represent-\ning a 15-year span of birth years, the oldest of the three 5-\nyear cohorts appears to have experienced higher inequality\nthan the younger cohorts at a given age for ages under 65.\nHowever, by age 65-69, convergence was seen both in\n\"everyone\" and \"survivors\" analyses between the level of\ninequality of the oldest and the middle cohorts, the two\ncohorts which reached that age during the period of observa-\ntion. Indeed, the two younger cohorts appear to have experi-\nenced a sharper within-cohort increase in inequality after age\n59 than was the case for the older one. Because of the within-\ncohort increases, inequality reached a very high level (Gini\nhigher than 0.4) after age 65 for both 5-year cohorts that\nwere followed to that age range.\nBy themselves, of course, the distributional findings pro-\nvide only part of the picture needed to understand the\nconsequences of policy choices. The characterization of\nthese distributional outcomes needs to be followed up with\nmore work on the processes which produce these levels of\nTable 3. Probabilities of a Change in Status of More Than One Quintile (Cohorts 1 and 2)\nOrigin\nQuintile\nBest-off\nWorst-off\nn,\nn,\ninequality. Two important lines of work involve longitudinal\nanalyses of outcomes experienced by differently situated\nindividuals, and of the distributional impact of specific\nincome sources. Employment income received by individ-\nuals over age 60 and especially by those over age 65 appears\nto be one unequalizing factor (although it should be noted\nthat inequality in our study was even higher after age 70,\nwhen few individuals were still working). Private pension\nincome is another major unequalizing factor: such income is\nreceived mostly by individuals with the highest incomes\nfrom Social Security and other sources (Crystal and Shea,\ntributed than is total income (Crystal and Shea, 1990a), but\nthe redistributive elements in Social Security formulas do\nnot appear to be sufficient to produce a ' 'leveling effect'' for\ntotal income after retirement age.\nAnother perspective on the processes which may be lead-\ning to the observed high level of inequality observed at the\nlater ages can be gained by comparing inequality indices for\nelderly persons across countries with differing retirement\nincome systems, using cross-sectional census data. Benefits\n(both public and private) that are directly related to the level\nof preretirement contributions play a larger role in the U.S.\nthan in most developed countries for which comparative data\nare available, while public flat-rate benefits, minimum\nbenefits, and means-tested programs play a smaller role.\nSmeeding, Torrey, and Rainwater (1993), in a comparison\nof eight developed countries, found that minimum benefits\nin the U.S. were the smallest among the countries in propor-\ntion to median income for people of all ages. Social insur-\nance such as Social Security retirement pensions and means-\ntested income combined accounted for 58 percent of the\nincome of elderly people in the U.S., a lower figure than for\nany of the other countries. The relatively limited role of flat-\nrate, minimum, and means-tested benefits in the U.S. retire-\nment income system, and the prominent role of private\npensions, seems to be related to the high level of income\ninequality among older persons in the U.S. These structural\nfeatures may interact with individual life events in such a\nway as to produce outcomes that are problematic from the\npoint of view of equity and adequacy for less-advantaged\nelderly individuals. Smeeding, Torrey, and Rainwater found\nas measured by the Gini coefficient was higher for the U.S.\nthan for the seven other countries studied.\nBy their nature, cohort studies provide direct information\nonly on particular cohorts entering old age during particular\nhistorical periods. The extent to which the pattern of increas-\ning within-cohort inequality projects to later cohorts can\nonly be answered empirically. What the results do indicate is\nthat over a 15-year period of considerable real income\ngrowth for older people, for the cohorts which make up\ntoday's 75 + population, within-cohort inequality increased\nwith time. Members of these cohorts benefited from consid-\nerable increases in the real value of Social Security benefits\nduring the early 1970s, but this \"rising tide\" did not lead to\nreduced disparity in economic outcomes as cohort members\nmoved into their sixties and seventies.\nOur analysis of individual transitions suggests the impor-\ntance of distinguishing between population-level and\nindividual-level dimensions of the pattern of economic out-\ncomes. These distinctions are often obscured in studies\nbased on cross-sectional data, in which inferences about\nindividual-level outcomes must be made from population-\nlevel data. Comparison between cross-sectional and longitu-\ndinal results helps to define the several distinct empirical\nquestions which need to be addressed in order to develop a\nbetter understanding of later-life economic outcomes. First,\nwhat happens to the overall level of inequality within a\ncohort as that cohort ages? This is a population-level ques-\ntion which describes the distribution of resources within the\ncohort at a given time as it reaches various ages. A high and\nincreasing level of inequality implies a \"two worlds of\naging\" pattern of outcomes (Crystal, 1984), but does not tell\nus whether economically advantaged elderly persons are the\nsame individuals who were economically advantaged earlier\nin the life course. The present longitudinal analysis of NLS\ndata is consistent with cross-sectional analyses of SIPP data\n(Crystal and Shea, 1990a) in suggesting that the level of\npopulation inequality increases after age 65. A second and\ndistinct set of questions concerns the extent to which eco-\nnomic status is maintained over time for individuals. Here,\nthe longitudinal results suggest a fairly substantial level of\nturnover in the distribution, suggesting that individual status\nis not necessarily maintained.\nMeasuring the degree of stability through transition matri-\nces adds another dimension to the picture provided by the\ndistributional analysis and suggests several further questions\nas a focus for future research. The results tend to disconfirm\nthe claim that later-life outcomes are characterized by \"sta-\ntus maintenance.'' It could be argued (as it has for economic\nmobility at younger ages) that these results mitigate the\nproblematic nature of the high level of inequality observed\namong older people in the U.S. Certainly, they suggest the\nabsence of a rigid social stratification system by which\nretirement income institutions perpetuate the economic posi-\ntion occupied by an individual at midlife. However, the\nimplications of large changes in relative status may differ\nwhen these changes occur late in life, and depend on who\nexperiences upward and downward changes. Economic mo-\nbility in late life, as compared to such mobility earlier in the\nlife course, is less likely to result from the exercise of\nentrepreneurial initiative, ambition, and talent (or lack\nthereof) and more likely to result from other factors. Such\nfactors may include, on the one hand, adverse life events\nsuch as widowhood, severe illness, or the onset of functional\ndependency, and on the other hand such aspects of \"luck\"\nas good health, good fortune with investments, remarriage,\nor inheritance. For individuals whose life style was comfort-\nable at midlife, large downward transitions can represent a\nwrenching readjustment, and we found that such changes\n(downward transitions of more than one quintile) were not\nuncommon. For example, among those at the middle level of\neconomic status at baseline at ages 45-59 (those in the third\nquintile), who were experiencing fairly comfortable circum-\nstances at midlife, 19 percent were in the worst-off quintile\n15 years later, representing a poverty or near-poverty life\nstyle. These results suggest the need for further research on\nthe life events associated with such transitions, and the\ndegree to which social insurance and other retirement in-\ncome institutions protect individuals who experience health\ncrises, loss of a spouse, and other catastrophes to which\nindividuals are vulnerable in late life. It has been said that\n\"old age is not for sissies\"; social policy usually cannot\nprotect older people from such events, but it can provide\nsome protection from their financial consequences.\nIn the context of relatively high income mobility in later\nlife, what is the significance of the high level of inequality at\nthese ages and the widening of the income distribution\nwithin cohorts? Widening of an income distribution over\ntime tends to magnify the size of transitions within that\ndistribution. Shifts from the middle to the extremes of the\ndistribution will on average be larger than those from the\nextremes to the middle, producing \"big winners\" and \"big\nlosers\" in life's sweepstakes. The Gini coefficient's large\nsize at ages over 65 suggests that there is a wide gap in\neconomic well-being between those older people who fall at\ndifferent positions in the income distribution. Thus, for\nexample, going from the middle to the bottom quintile is a\nmore wrenching transition than would be the case in a\nnarrow income distribution which becomes further com-\npressed as a cohort ages. Similarly, upward transitions in\nrelative status are magnified in a distribution that is widening\nover time. Indeed, an interesting and under-researched story\nin gerontology involves understanding the circumstances of\nthose who make large improvements in their relative and\nabsolute economic position after retirement.\nFrom the point of view of equity, adequately interpreting\nthe implications of this set of findings will depend on further\nresearch on the circumstances of individuals who ultimately\nland in the penury represented by the low end of the income\ndistribution or the prosperity represented by the top end.\nHigh inequality would not be as much of a concern if the\nindividuals who wind up at the lower end of the distribution\nwere healthy individuals with strong potential support sys-\ntems, who may not have needed or qualified for public\nbenefits. However, we know from cross-sectional studies\nthat individuals who end up low in the income distribution\nafter age 65 tend to be in poorer health; to have more\nfunctional impairments; to have minimal or no financial\nassets; and to have other characteristics suggestive of long-\nterm economic disadvantage, such as less education and\nhistories of lower-status occupations (Crystal, 1996; Crystal\nCrystal, Shea, and Krishnaswami (1992) found that years of\neducation, typically completed before age 30, were more\npredictive of income after age 65 than earlier in the life\ncourse. Mobility in position in the income distribution, as\nobserved in our current study, does not necessarily mitigate\nthe implications of high levels of later-life inequality. In-\ndeed, there is some evidence to suggest that those individ-\nuals who are most economically vulnerable (because of\nlimited education, poor health, or other factors) experience\nthe full consequences of their vulnerability only in late life,\nwhile those with more advantaged backgrounds benefit dis-\nproportionately from \"reserve resources\" such as health,\npension entitlements, and investments at that time (Crystal,\nTo understand the extent to which such a scenario is\ntypical, more longitudinal research is needed on which\nindividuals are experiencing what kinds of income changes.\nWhat characteristics and life events predict major upward or\ndownward changes in economic status? To what extent, for\nexample, are such changes the result of changes in health\nand functional status or changes in marital status? Under\nwhat circumstances and to what extent does the \"social\nsafety net'' buffer such changes? To what extent can they be\nseen as the result of choices made earlier in life, on the one\nhand, or the result of unpredictable hazards of life, on the\nother? To what extent do permanent or early-established\nsocial characteristics of individuals such as race, gender,\nparental socioeconomic status, and education predict\npostretirement-age income? Results of the present study\nindicate the importance of these research agendas, which\nrequire longitudinal data that combine good-quality eco-\nnomic measures with considerable detail on health status,\nhealth care costs, functional status, and changes in social\ncircumstances.\nThis empirical analysis highlights a seeming paradox:\nincreasing inequality at the population level within a cohort\nas it ages, accompanied by a considerable degree of turnover\nin relative position. To understand the implications of the\nindividual-level changes, and to inform public policy, more\nlongitudinally based research is needed on the determinants\nof individual change in economic status, and on the way in\nwhich life events and the structure of the retirement income\nsystem interact in shaping these outcomes.\n"
