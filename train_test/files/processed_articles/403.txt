Introduction\nThe marked increases in prevalence of overweight and obesity over the last several decades in the\nUnited States poses a major public health concern [1]. Toxic metals may be conjectured to play a role in\ncontributing to obesity by displacing vital metals such as zinc, chromium, copper, iron, and magnesium,\nwhich may in turn affect energy production, carbohydrate tolerance, and other metabolic process[2]. In\nmice, zinc deficiency induced by a mutation in the Znt7 zinc transporter caused a reduced body weight\ngain that was largely due to the decrease in body fat accumulation [3]. In contrast, deficiency of other\nessential metals, chromium [4,5], copper [6], iron [7,8], and magnesium [9], causes an increase\nin adiposity. The toxic metals, lead and cadmium are ubiquitous environmental toxins that are related\nto a broad range of physiologic, biochemical, and behavioral dysfunctions[10,11] and recent\nepidemiologic studies have reported that environmental exposure to lead or cadmium concentration\nhas a graded association with several disease outcomes such as hypertension, peripheral artery\ndiseases, kidney diseases, and cognitive impairment [12-17]. To our knowledge, this is the first study\nto demonstrate an association between lead and other toxic metals and obesity.\nHeavy metals are a heterogeneous group of highly reactive substances, which may act as essential\ncofactors for physiologic processes and/or as toxic elements. Some metals induce oxidative stress\ndirectly, such as iron redox-cycling between Fe3+ and Fe2+ and creating superoxide (O2\n\u00ad) in the process [18].\nWhereas iron (Fe), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), vanadium (V) and cobalt (Co) undergo redox-cycling\nreactions under physiological conditions, other metals such as mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd) and\nnickel (Ni), and arsenic (As) increase oxidative stress indirectly by depleting glutathione and bonding\nto sulfhydryl groups of proteins [18]. The unifying factor in determining metal toxicity is the\ngeneration of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species [18].\nThe toxic metals we investigated in this study range from ubiquitous to rare in the environment.\nLead, cadmium, cobalt, antimony, and cesium are all on the 2007 CERCLA (Comprehensive\nEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act) priority list of hazardous substances\n(http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/cercla/index.html). The CERCLA requires the EPA to prepare a list, in\norder of priority, of substances that are most commonly found at Superfund sites (also known as the\nNational Priority List (NPL) sites). These contaminants are determined to pose the most significant\npotential threat to human health due to their known or suspected toxicity and potential for human\nexposure at these NPL sites.\nAs an initial exploratory inquiry, the present study investigated the association of body mass index\n(BMI) and waist circumference (WC) with toxic metals adjusting for age, ethnicity, and gender via\nmultiple linear regressions using participants aged 6\u00ad60 across National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES) 99-02. BMI is calculated as weight in kilograms/height in meters\nsquared and WC is measured in centimeters. The toxic metals examined included barium, cadmium,\ncobalt, cesium, molybdenum, lead, antimony, thallium, and tungsten.\n2. Experimental Section\nWe used data from the publicly available National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nHealth and Statistics (NCHS), the data are from a cross-sectional survey designed to yield a\nrepresentative sample of the U.S. non-institutionalized civilian population. The surveys have the same\nbasic structure and plan, and contain age, gender, race, height, weight, and WC. Anthropometric\nmeasures including height, weight, and WC were also obtained via the NHANES database\n(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/frequency/bmxdoc.pdf). In addition, the surveys are stratified\nmultistage probability samples based on selection of counties, blocks house-holds, and persons\nwithin households.\nMeasures of metals were assessed in urine samples from one-third of participants. For this analysis,\nas individual chemicals by high resolution gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) using\nisotope dilution for quantification. The metals data are adjusted for serum total cholesterol\nand triglycerides. In addition, the models were adjusted for the following two variables:\nsocioeconomic status and Creatinine. Socioeconomic status is adjusted for by including the poverty\nincome ratio (PIR). NHANES indicates that PIR < 1 are below the official poverty threshold and PIR\n 1 are above the poverty level. Creatinine, a break down product of creatine phosphate, was used as a\ncontrolling covariate because some heavy metals such as lead damage the kidneys and consequently\ncause an increase in serum creatinine, which is normally filtered by the kidneys [19]; creatinine levels\nare therefore relative measures of kidney damage. All metals levels were transformed by taking the\nnatural log (ln) of each in order to improve linearity and analyzed in their transformed form.\nBased on relatively high prevalence in the NHANES population, which is needed for statistical\nanalyses, we selected nine metals: barium, cadmium, cobalt, cesium, molybdenum, lead, antimony,\nthallium, and tungsten. Based on the above criteria, a total of approximately 3,816 participants with\nvalid BMI scores and 3,825 participants with valid WC score were used.\n2.2. Statistical Analysis\nThe primary analysis consisted of three regression models using all available participants testing for\nassociations with adiposity as assessed by BMI and WC. Two models regressed BMI and WC\nrespectively on gender, ethnicity, PIR, age, creatinine, and metals. All variables are included in the\nmodel simultaneously with the first five variables acting as covariates. The third model regressed WC\non the previous predictors but controlled for BMI. These models are referred to as additive models.\nEach of these models was extended by including two-way interactions between gender and metals.\nAll analysis, including descriptive statistics, were conducted using SUDAAN 9.01 (RTI\nInternational, Research Triangle Park, NC) or AM Statistical Software v.0.06 (The American Institutes\nfor Research, DC), which estimates standard errors using the sampling weights, strata, and primary\nsampling units (PSU) from NHANES allowing for the complex sampling procedures used.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. Descriptive Statistics\nDescriptive statistics for BMI and WC by gender, ethnicity, and age are displayed in Table 1.\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics for Detectable Toxins.\nBMI Waist Circumference (WC)\nGender\nMale\nFemale\nEthnicity\nMexican American\nOther Hispanic\nNon-Hispanic White\nNon-Hispanic Black\nOther Race\nAge\nCorrelations between BMI and WC with all variables in the models are displayed in Table 2.\nTable 2. Correlations Among all Variables in the Models.\n5. Creatinine\n7. Cadmium\nInspection of the quantities of the correlation matrix indicates that multi-collinearity is not a major\nproblem. The highest correlations are between creatinine and the metals, but creatinine is being used\nas a control variable in the models to take into account the toxic effect of metals on creatinine on the\nkidneys. After creatinine, the correlation between the metals is the next highest group. This might be\ncaused by a relatively high rate of co-exposures to these metals, such as via proximity to industrial\nwaste or incinerators.\n3.2. Additive Models\nResults of the additive regression models for all participants are presented in Table 3 with\ncorresponding least square means in Table 4.\nIn the model testing for the association with BMI, there are significant associations, independent of\nthe covariates, for ln barium, ln cadmium, ln cobalt, ln cesium, ln lead, and ln thallium, with the model\naccounted for approximately 28% of the BMI variance (Table 3), with 3% of the variance uniquely\nattributable to the metals. The associations are positive for ln barium and ln thallium. The significant\nmetal dose-responses for BMI are presented in Table 5. On the other hand, the associations are\nnegative for ln cadmium, ln cobalt, ln cesium, and ln lead. Age has a curvilinear association with BMI\nin that BMI increases at early ages, peaks around midlife, and begins decreasing.\nFor testing the association with WC, there are significant associations, independent of the\ncovariates, for ln barium, ln cadmium, ln cobalt, ln cesium, ln lead, and ln thallium. The model\naccounted for approximately 40% of the WC variance (Table 3), with 3% of the variance uniquely\nattributable to the metals. The associations are positive for ln barium and ln thallium, yet negative for\nln cadmium, ln cobalt, ln cesium, and ln lead. The significant metal dose-responses for WC are\npresented in Table 6. As in the previous molded for BMI, age has a curvilinear association with WC in\nthat WC increases at early ages, peaks around midlife, and then begins decreasing.\nTable 3.

WC refers to waist circumference. Joint Test refers to the simultaneous\ntest of all heavy metals.\nBecause of the high association of creatinine with obesity, a second set of regression models were\nestimated without using creatinine as a covariate. Results of these models are presented in Table 7.\nThe analyses largely indicate that the majority of results remain unchanged. The exceptions were the\nparameters estimates for ln molybdenum and ln tungsten which change direction without creatinine in\nthe model. However, neither ln molybdenum nor ln tungsten are significant whether creatinine is used\nas a covariate or not. Additionally, ln antimony became significant when creatinine was not used\nas a covariate. Even so, the results remain largely unchanged whether creatinine is used as a covariate\nor not.\nLead remained clearly consistent whether creatinine is used as a covariate or not. In order to see the\nassociation of lead with BMI and WC, a regression model was estimated using only ethnicity, gender,\nand age as covariates. Table 8 displays these results. The parameter for ln lead remained in the same\ndirection, but it is no longer significant. So it appears that all the metals must be taken into account in\norder to see the true association of ln lead with BMI and WC.\nTable 4.

Evidence suggests that WC is increasing in the population\nand is considered as a marker for body fat distribution [20-25], hence the analysis was included.\n3.3. Interaction Models\nAlthough the joint test for the interaction between gender and all of the metals were significant for\nboth the BMI and WC models, the change in variance seemed trivial. Specifically, the incremental\nvariance due to the interactions was always less than 0.05%. For this reason, the interaction models\nwere not pursued.\n3.4. Models for Adolescents and Adults\nBecause of the rapid changes of BMI from ages 6\u00ad18, the same analyses were conducted for\nindividuals ages 6\u00ad18 (adolescents) or 19 or older (adult). Tables 9 to 14 present the results of\nthese analyses. For adolescents, only barium, cobalt, and lead remained consistently significant. The\nsignificant metal dose\u00adresponses for BMI and WC are presented in Tables 10 and 11, respectively. For\nadults, with the exception of cobalt, all of the parameters estimates remained in the same direction and\nthose that were significant in the original model remained significant. The significant metal\ndose-responses for BMI and WC are presented in Tables 13 and 14, respectively.\nTable 9.

Conclusions\nOur results indicate several significant associations. The toxic metals barium and thallium are\npositively associated with BMI and WC, whereas cadmium, cobalt, cesium, and lead are negatively\nassociated with BMI and WC. Most toxic metals such as cadmium have more than one oxidation state;\naccordingly the same metal may have different effects on humans [18]. Weight gain or weight loss,\ndepending on the toxic metal, tends to occur at much lower levels of exposure of metals than those that\nmake animals or humans obviously ill. For example, the CDC health concern blood lead level (BLL) is\n10 g/dL, and higher levels warrant intervention such as chelation therapy, especially in children [26].\nconcentrations above the CDC health concern level [27]. A broad range of lead levels had negative\nassociations with BMI and WC, suggesting that levels much lower than 10 g/dL affect these traits.\nThis result is consistent with studies of neurodevelopmenttal defects in children associated with low\nblood lead levels that have led to call for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to reduce the\ncurrent screening guideline of 10 g/dL [28-31]. Exposure to lead can happen from breathing\nworkplace air or dust, eating contaminated foods, or drinking contaminated water. Lead has been\nfound in at least 1,272 of the 1,684 National Priority List (NPL) sites identified by the Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) (http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/cercla/index.html).\nThe other toxic metals in this study have various sources. Exposure to barium occurs mostly in the\nworkplace or from drinking contaminated water. Barium and barium compounds have been found in at\nleast 798 of the 1,684 NPL sites identified by the EPA. Exposure to thallium occurs mainly from\neating food, but high levels of exposure may occur in the workplace. Thallium has been found in at\nleast 210 of 1,416 NPL sites identified by the EPA. Exposure to cadmium happens mostly in the\nworkplace, but lower doses are obtained from breathing cigarette smoke or eating cadmium\ncontaminated foods. Cadmium has been found in at least 1,014 of the 1,669 NPL sites identified by\nthe EPA. The general population is exposed to low levels of cobalt in air, water, and food. Cobalt has\nboth beneficial effects, as part of vitamin B12, and harmful effects on health at high doses. Cobalt has\nbeen found in at least 426 of the 1,636 NPL sites identified by the EPA. Exposure to stable or\nradioactive cesium occurs from ingesting contaminated food or drinking water or breathing\ncontaminated air. High levels of radioactive cesium may occur after nuclear accidents or detonation of\natomic bombs. Stable (non-radioactive) cesium has been found in at least 8 of the 1,636 NPL sites and\nradioactive cesium has been found in at least 23 of the 1,636 NPL sites identified by the EPA.\nOne possible explanation for why some toxic metals (barium and thallium) positively associate with\nobesity is that they induce oxidative stress, which increases lipogenesis at the expense of energy\nproduction [32]. Oxidative stress can be either by directly generating free radicals, in the case of\nredox-cycling metals such as barium or thallium, or indirectly by non-redox cycling metals such as\nlead and mercury [18]. Indirect induction of oxidative stress can be mediated by reducing glutathione\nlevels or by interfering with iron metabolism. Reactive oxygen species directly or indirectly generated\nby metals can inhibit the normal mitochondrial metabolic function, and prevent the mitochondria from\nproducing energy, in the form of ATP, by oxidative phosphorylation. The lower levels of ATP,\ncoupled by the diminished efficacy of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle due to inhibition of enzymes\nsuch as aconitase, which are sensitve to oxidative stress, would cause the liver to divert metabolites to\nlipogenesis [32]. However, if metal-induced oxidative stress is a major cause of obesity, it is not clear\nwhy some metals, such as barium and thallium, positively associate with obesity, whereas other\nmetals, such as lead, cadmium, and cesium negatively associate with obesity.\nThe finding that lead, cadmium, cobalt, and cesium negatively associate with obesity is surprising.\nA recent study has shown that lead is a predictor of diabetic neuropathy, and that chelation therapy that\nreduces the lead burden slows the rate of diabetic neuropathy [19]. Also, even in patients without\ndiabetes, lead chelation therapy has been shown to slow the progression of chronic renal\ndiseases [33,34]. Furthermore, using data from the Normative Aging Study, Tsaih and colleagues [35]\nshowed significant interactions of blood lead and tibia lead with diabetes and renal function. For\nexample, increasing the tibia lead level from the lowest to the highest quartiles was associated with an\nincrease in the rate of rise of serum creatinine that was 17.6 fold greater in diabetics than in\nnon-diabetics. The implication of this result is that lead damages the kidneys much more readily in\ndiabetics than in non-diabetics [35]. Our study suggests that cadmium, cobalt, and cesium might\nfunction in a manner similar to lead in that, for whatever reason, they all negatively associate\nwith obesity. It will be interesting to determine whether, like lead, any of the other toxic metals in our\nstudy positively associate with diabetic neuropathy.\nHowever, urine lead levels, which were all that is available in the NHANES 99-02 studies analyzed\nhere, only reflect recent lead exposures and the abovementioned studies were careful to also analyze\ntotal lead burden by measuring lead levels after EDTA chelation [19,33,34], which mobilizes lead\nfrom the bone to the circulation, or X-ray analyses of bone lead [35]. Blood lead levels are only\nproportional to body lead levels if there is a constant exposure to lead. However, blood lead levels\nhave fallen over the past three decades in the U.S. because of the elimination of leaded paint and\ngasoline in the late 1970s, whereas the body burden of lead can last for several decades [36].\nIt is possible that the negative association between obesity and blood lead levels is misleading.\nThere is a positive association between creatinine levels and obesity, and several studies have shown\nthat body lead levels are proportional to creatinine levels because, as mentioned above, lead positively\nassociates with kidney dysfunction and this prevents proper filtration of creatinine, which is produced\nfrom creatine kinase breakdown in muscles from the blood [19,33,34]. Also, a recent study has shown\nthat recent severe weight loss can cause the release of stored lead from bones [37], and the weight\nhistory of the NHANES sample is not completely known. However, as shown in Figure 1, there has\nbeen a steady decrease in blood lead levels from 1977 to 2000 at the same time that there has been a\nsteady increase in obesity in the NHANES populations. This result is consistent with lead being\nnegatively associated with obesity. We note that Figure 1 is based on NHANES population studies,\nwhich are cross-sectional in that both metals and outcomes are assessed at the same time. Further\nprospective studies are needed to address the temporality of these findings.\nIn conclusion, there is, by and large, a negative association of heavy toxic metal urine\nconcentrations with BMI and WC. This suggests that the association of heavy metals with BMI and\nWC is still unclear because the findings here are in the opposite direction of past research\nand hypotheses. Future research should be further conducted in order to establish a clear understanding\nof the association of heavy metals with BMI and WC.\nFigure 1. There is a negative association between blood lead levels and obesity from 1976 to 2000.\n"
