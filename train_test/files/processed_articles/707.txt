    "abstract": "Abstract: Subsidized health care benefits would be guaranteed for early retirees ages fifty-five to\nsixty-four under President Bill Clinton's health care reform proposal. This is an important policy issue\nbecause persons in this age group are the least likely age cohort of the nonelderly population to be\nworking. They are also the most likely to face high and uncertain health care costs. Previous research\nhas shown that access to continuation of health insurance coverage encourages retirement before age\nsixty-five. These retirement effects can add substantially to the federal government's cost of providing\nhealth care benefits to early retirees. Based upon various assumptions for premium levels, the induced\nretirement effects of current workers, and the number of nonworkers qualifying for subsidized benefits,\nwe present total annual cost estimates to the federal government, based on 1994 figures, ranging from\n$9.1 billion to $19.6 billion, to provide subsidized benefits to the nonworking population between\nthe ages of fifty-five and sixty-four.\nUnder President Bill Clinton's health reform proposal, early retirees\nbetween the ages of fifty-five and sixty-four would be eligible for\ngovernment-subsidized postretirement health benefits beginning in\n1998. The plan would guarantee the basic benefit package for all nonwork-\ners ages fifty-five through sixty-four, provided they have met all of the\nrequirements for Social Security benefits except for age.2 The federal gov-\nernment would pay 80 percent of the average weighted premium, freeing\nfirms and individuals from paying a major portion ofthe costs.3 This premium\nwould be community rated and would not vary by age. For retirees with\nguaranteed benefits from their employer, the employer would cover the\nretiree's share of the premium.4\nHealth insurance costs are potentially a large percentage of retirees'\nexpenditures. This plan would encourage early retirement among workers\nby reducing their health insurance costs significantly. Large savings would\nalso accrue to firms that now provide early retiree health benefits, resulting\nin incentives for employers to encourage early retirement, especially in\nfirms with an older work force.5\nThe authors are affiliated with the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington, D.C. : Paul\nFronstin is a research associate, Sara Snider is a research analyst, William Custer is director of\nresearch, and Dallas Salisbury is president.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The availability of low-cost retiree health insurance is an\nincentive for the near-elderly to retire early.\nIt is almost certain that the provision of health care benefits to early\nretirees would reduce the labor-force participation of this group and drive\nup the federal government's costs of providing health care benefits. These\ncosts must be considered in the context of the current retired population\nthat would qualify for benefits as well as the working population that may\nbe induced to leave the labor force. Rising total costs of providing health\nbenefits to early retirees will become even more significant as the popula-\ntion ages. This DataWatch reports estimates of the costs to the federal\ngovernment of providing subsidized health care benefits to nonworking\npersons ages fifty-five to sixty-four, based on 1992 population estimates. A\nrange of estimates is presented based on assumptions about the premium\ncost and the number of persons who could be affected by this proposal.\nCharacteristics Of The Near-Elderly Population\nU.S. population.7 Exhibit 1 contains data on the major activity of the\nnear-elderly in 1992.

Approximately 0.01 percent never\nworked. If the near-elderly are guaranteed subsidized health benefits when\nthey retire early, the number of workers will decline. In addition, nonwork-\ners ages fifty-five to sixty-four also will be eligible for the subsidized benefits\nif they have met all of the requirements for Social Security except for age.\nAlthough the near-elderly have lower labor-force participation rates\nthan do other age groups, the majority of those ages fifty-five to sixty-four\n(64.1 percent) get their health insurance coverage from an employment-\nbased plan (Exhibit 2). This compares with 70.6 percent for persons ages\nSelected Sources Of Health Insurance, By Age Group And Major Activity, 1992\nAge/activity\nWorking\nRetired\nCould not find work\nOther activity\nWorking\nRetired\nCould not find work\nOther activity\nWorking\nRetired\nCould not find work\nOther activity\nWorking\nRetired\nCould not find work\nOther activity\nWorking\nRetired\nCould not find work\nOther activity\nWorking\nRetired\nCould not find work\nOther activity\nTotal\nTotal\nprivate\nEmployer coverage\nTotal\nNumber (millions)\nPercent\nt\nDirect\nIndirect\nOther\nprivate\nTotal\npublic\nMedicare\nNo\ncoverage\nSource: Employee Benefit Research Institute tabulations from the March 1993 supplement to the Current\nPopulation Survey.\nNote: Details may not add to totals because persons may receive coverage from more than one source.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The near-elderly are more likely than other age groups to have\nindividually purchased private insurance plans. Almost 13 percent have\nsuch a policy, compared with 8.8 percent of persons ages forty-five to\nfifty-four, and 7.1 percent of persons ages twenty-five to forty-four. The\nnear-elderly's high rate of individual coverage is a result of their weak\nattachment to the labor force and their increased likelihood of being\ndisabled. They are less likely to have employment-based health coverage,\nyet they are more likely than others to need some form of health insurance.8\nThe near-elderly are second only to the elderly in likelihood of having\npublicly provided health insurance coverage. In 1992 more than 17 percent\nof the near-elderly had some form of public coverage, compared with 10\npercent of the population ages forty-five to fifty-four, and 9.8 percent of the\npopulation ages twenty-five to forty-four. The major source of public insur-\nance for the near-elderly is Medicare; the near-elderly are more likely to\nhave Medicare coverage because they are more likely to be disabled and to\nqualify for the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program. Be-\ncause of their higher disability rates, the near-elderly are less likely than\nother nonelderly age groups to participate in the labor force.\nThe near-elderly were less likely than other nonelderly age groups to be\nuninsured in 1992. Less than 13 percent of the population ages fifty-five to\nsixty-four were uninsured, compared with 14 percent of persons ages forty-\nfive to fifty-four and 18.5 percent of persons ages twenty-five to forty-four.\nThe higher rates of insurance coverage also can be attributed to higher\nSSDI participation.\nSources of health insurance coverage differ by the work status of the\nnear-elderly. Workers between ages fifty-five and sixty-four were most\nlikely to have employment-based insurance, but many nonworkers also had\nemployment-based coverage. For example, 40.3 percent of early retirees had\ndirect employment-based health insurance in 1992.9 These benefits can\ncome in the form of retiree health insurance under the Consolidated\nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA).10 Interestingly,\n11.5 percent of persons in this age group who were looking for work were\ncovered by an employment-based plan. These persons were most likely\nusing COBRA coverage as a bridge during job turnover.\nCost Of Providing Health Benefits To Early Retirees\nData and methods. We used the March 1993 supplement to the Cur-\nrent Population Survey (CPS) to provide estimates of the federal govern-\nment's cost of providing subsidized health care benefits to nonworkers ages\nfifty-five to sixty-four. The CPS is the most detailed nationally repre-\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

We also must know how many persons have already stopped\nworking and would qualify for Social Security benefits at age sixty-five. We\nused results obtained by Jonathan Gruber and Brigitte Madrian to estimate\nthe effects of induced early retirement.11 These researchers found that state\nlaws mandating the availability of COBRA-type continuation of coverage\nfor one year result in a 20-60 percent increase in the probability that a\nperson age fifty-five to sixty-four will retire early. Since there are strong\nincentives to retire early when state laws mandate continuation of cover-\nage, we would expect even greater effects under the presidents reform\npackage because continuation of coverage would be guaranteed for a longer\nperiod of time and the cost savings to early retirees would be even greater.\nThe Clinton administration has estimated that under the president's\nproposal, the cost of an indemnity plan for a single adult would be $1,932\nin 1994. Other researchers have presented alternative estimates. For exam-\nple, the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI) estimated a premium\nof $2,202. Researchers from The Wyatt Company estimated a premium of\nHealth Insurance Association of America (HIAA) estimated a premium of\n$2,509.12 As mentioned above, the federal government's share of the pre-\nmium would be 80 percent; therefore, we used 80 percent of the lowest\na range of estimates of the federal government's cost of providing health\nbenefits to early retirees.\nBased upon data from the March 1993 CPS, we calculated a retirement\nsixty-four, and assumed that if the number of early retirees does not change,\n6.9 percent of workers in this age group would retire in any given year.\nExhibit 3 presents the results of our cost simulations under various assump-\ntions about the premium level and the retirement effects of workers. We\ngive estimates based upon three assumptions about the retirement effects of\nworkers combined with two assumptions about the number of nonworkers\nwho also would qualify for subsidized benefits.\nResults. Our estimates of the costs to the federal government of provid-\ning subsidized benefits to early retirees and nonworkers range from $9.1\nbillion to $19.6 billion. Approximately 90 percent of workers ages fifty-five\nto sixty-four would currently qualify for Social Security benefits; therefore,\nwe weight our estimates by 90 percent.13 Because we do not know how\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Cost estimates are based on 1994 figures.\nmany nonworkers would qualify for subsidized benefits, we use 50 percent as\na lower bound and 90 percent as an upper bound to derive a range of costs.\nWhen we assume that workers do not respond to the added incentives to\nretire, the cost of providing health benefits to workers who would have\nretired even without the subsidized benefits is $1.2 billion under the low\npremium and $1.5 billion under the high premium. This simulation allows\nus to put a lower bound on the cost estimate, even though we expect some\nchange in the number of workers who retire. For nonworkers, assuming that\n50 percent would qualify for subsidized benefits, we find that the cost to the\nfederal government for providing the benefits to the nonworkers is $7.9\nbillion under the low premium and $10.3 billion under the high premium.14\nIf 90 percent of the nonworkers qualified for subsidized benefits, the cost to\nthe federal government for subsidizing nonworkers would be $11.4 billion\nunder the low premium. The cost for nonworkers jumps to $14.8 billion\nunder the high premium.\nThe model also is simulated using a moderate level of induced retirement\nfor workers, based on previous research.

Based on Gruber and Madrian's research, the moderate probability of\nretiring early becomes 15.9 percent (up from 6.9 percent), representing 1.3\nmillion additional early retirees, and the cost of providing health benefits to\nearly retirees ranges from $2.9 billion to $3.8 billion, depending upon the\nlevel of the premium.\nA large retirement effect among current workers is also possible. Gruber\nand Madrian do not control for the additional effects that occur when the\nfederal government subsidizes 80 percent of the cost of community-rated\nhealth insurance premiums. Under a continuation-of-coverage mandate,\ngroup-rated health insurance will be available for only approximately eight-\neen months; under the president's plan, continuation of coverage will be\navailable until age sixty-five at only 20 percent of the average weighted\ncommunity-rated premium.15 This lower price of health insurance should\nhave some additional effects on the cost to the federal government of\nproviding subsidized benefits to early retirees. Assuming that the largest\npossible response to the guaranteed benefits package would be a 20 percent\nincrease in the number of workers who decide to retire early (representing\n1.8 million additional early retirees), we find that the range of costs to the\nfederal government of providing benefits to workers who are induced to\nretire becomes $3.7 billion under the low premium and $4.8 billion under\nPolicy Implications\nThere are several reasons for the range of cost estimates we have derived\nfor early retiree coverage. Costs are incurred because approximately 6.9\npercent of the near-elderly population retires each year. Under the Clinton\nplan, additional costs will be incurred when workers retire because the\nfederal government will pay a majority of the costs of the guaranteed\nbenefits. Nonworkers who have met the Social Security covered-quarters\nrequirement also will be covered under the president's reform plan. All of\nthese costs are uncertain because the level of induced retirement, the\nnumber of qualifying nonworkers, and the actual premium costs cannot be\nprecisely estimated. The lowest total annual cost the federal government\nwould face is $9.1 billion, assuming that the premium is $1,932, additional\nworkers do not retire early, and only 50 percent of nonworkers qualify for\nthe subsidized benefits.

If a person now retires early, he or she can always\nreturn to work. Some workers use early retirement as a way to ease them-\nselves out of the labor force. Many of these workers retire only partially,\nfinding part-time work until they are closer to age sixty-five. Under the\nHealth Security Act, retired persons would lose their subsidized benefits if\nthey returned to work. The proposed employer mandate would inhibit early\nretirees from returning to work because as employees they would not get\nsubsidized benefits and their employers would have to provide them with\nhealth benefits. The human capital costs also must be accounted for when\nestimating the costs of providing subsidized benefits to workers ages fifty-\nfive to sixty-four.\nNOTES\n1. The Health Security Act, if passed, would be fully implemented by 1998, but some\nstates would have the option to participate beginning in 1996.\n2. To qualify for Social Security benefits, a person must have worked at least forty quarters\nin Social Security-covered jobs. Under the president's proposal, single adults ages\nfifty-five to sixty-four with income over $90,000 and married couples with joint income\nof more than $115,000 would have to repay the subsidy at tax time. Only 2 percent of\nnonworking individuals ages fifty-five to sixty-four would have to repay the subsidy.\nThe estimates presented here do not account for these persons because their effect on\nthe total costs to the federal government is very small.\n3. The weighted average premium represents the average premium of all available health\nplans in an alliance weighted by the number of persons enrolled in each plan.\n4. See J. Davis, Retiree Health Benefits: Issues of Structure, Financing, and Coverage, Issue\nBrief 112 (Washington: Employee Benefit Research Institute, March 1991 ) for ways in\nwhich employers now fund retiree health benefits.\n5.

In addition, there is a mandatory five-month waiting period before\ndisability benefits begin; therefore, disabled persons are more likely to need some form\nof individual coverage in the interim.\n9. Direct employment-based coverage is coverage in one's own name. Indirect employ-\nment-based coverage is coverage provided through someone else's employer.\n10. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985 requires\nemployers with health insurance plans to offer continued access to group health\ninsurance to qualified beneficiaries. COBRA requires continued access for eighteen\nmonths for employees (twenty-nine months for the disabled) and thirty-six months for\nqualifying spouses and dependent children. Some states also have continuation-of-\ncoverage laws. See EBRI, Fundamentals of Employee Benefit Programs, 4th ed. (Wash-\nington: EBRI, 1990), for more information about the federal law; and J. Gruber and\nB.C. Madrian, \"Health Insurance Availability and the Retirement Decision,\" NBER\nWorking Paper 4469 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research,\n11. Gruber and Madrian, \"Health Insurance Availability and the Retirement Decision.\"\nThe authors provide estimates predicting the probability that a male would retire early\nbased upon individual characteristics, whether or not the person had employment-\nbased health insurance, whether the person was covered by a pension plan, and the\nnumber of months for which the person's state of residence mandated continuation of\nhealth insurance. We adjust their equation to reflect the number of months until a\nperson qualifies for Medicare, which reflects COBRA-type continuation of coverage\nuntil age sixty-five. We generalize their results to females, although this may overstate\nthe retirement effects of females.\n12.

We use data from the 1984 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to\ndetermine the number of workers ages fifty-five to sixty-four now qualifying for Social\nSecurity.\n14. Based on our data for workers, for nonworking persons reporting that they are retired,\nwe assume that approximately 90 percent of the nonworkers would qualify for Social\nSecurity at age sixty-five.\n15. This will be longer for persons in some states with continuation-of-coverage law lengths\nthat exceed the federal government length set in COBRA.\n16.
