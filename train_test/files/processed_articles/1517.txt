    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nThere is a high prevalence of chronic hyponatremia in the elderly, frequently owing to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic\nhormone secretion (SIADH). Recent reports have shown that even mild hyponatremia is associated with impaired gait stability and\nincreased falls. An increased risk of falls among elderly hyponatremic patients represents a risk factor for fractures, which would be\nfurther amplified if hyponatremia also contributed metabolically to bone loss. To evaluate this possibility, we studied a rat model of\nSIADH and analyzed data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). In rats, dual-energy X-ray\nabsorptiometry (DXA) analysis of excised femurs established that hyponatremia for 3 months significantly reduced bone mineral density\nby approximately 30% compared with normonatremic control rats. Moreover, micro-computed tomography (mCT) and histomorpho-\nmetric analyses indicated that hyponatremia markedly reduced both trabecular and cortical bone via increased bone resorption and\ndecreased bone formation. Analysis of data from adults in NHANES III by linear regression models showed that mild hyponatremia is\nassociated with increased odds of osteoporosis (T-score \u00ad2.5 or less) at the hip [odds ratio (OR) \u00bc 2.85; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03\u00ad\n7.86; p < .01]; all models were adjusted for age, sex, race, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, history of diuretic use, history of\nsmoking, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels. Our results represent the first demonstration that chronic hyponatremia\ncauses a substantial reduction of bone mass. Cross-sectional human data showing that hyponatremia is associated with significantly\nincreased odds of osteoporosis are consistent with the experimental data in rodents. Our combined results suggest that bone quality\nshould be assessed in all patients with chronic hyponatremia. \u00df 2010 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.\n",

Recent reports have suggested that chronic\nhyponatremia may not be a benign condition.(15\u00ad18) Even mild\nshown to have significant effects on cognitive function and gait\nstability and has been associated with a 67-fold increased odds\nJ\nJBMR\nAddress correspondence to: Joseph G.

We therefore initiated these studies to\nevaluate the possibility that hyponatremia may cause increased\nbone resorption in an attempt to release body stores of\nexchangeable sodium. Using an animal model of the human\nhyponatremic disease SIADH,(24) we monitored changes in\ntrabecular and cortical bone mineral content, histomorpho-\nmetric parameters of bone resorption and formation, and serum\nparameters of calcium homeostasis and calcium regulating\nhormones. We assessed the clinical relevance of our findings by\nanalysis of data from the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III) to test the hypothesis that\nhyponatremia is independently associated with increased odds\nof low bone mineral density in a representative sample of US\nadults aged 50 years and older.\nMaterials and Methods\nAnimal model of chronic hyponatremia\nAll experimental procedures were accomplished according to\nthe guidelines in the ``Care and Use of Animals,'' available at\ntional Animal Care and Use Committee of Georgetown University\napproved all animal experimentation according to federal and\ninstitutional policies and regulations. To produce hyponatremia,\nTaconic Farms, Germantown, NY, USA) were infused with\ndesmopressin (DDAVP, Aventis, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) at a rate\nof 5 ng/h via a subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipump\n(Alzet Model 2004; Durect Co., Cupertino, CA, USA) and were fed\n70 mL/d of a nutritionally balanced rodent liquid formula\n(F1268SP, BioServ, Frenchtown, NJ, USA) at a caloric density of\n1.0 kcal/mL.(24) At typical daily intakes, this supplied 30 IU/d of\nvitamin D3\nadministered via liquid diet feeding tubes (No. 9010, BioServ).\nRats were housed intermittently in metabolic cages (No. 650-\ncontrol group received a solid diet identical to the liquid diet in\ncomposition (AIN-76) and were infused with DDAVP. In\nexperiment 2, one group of control rats received a solid AIN-\n76 diet and another group the liquid diet without DDAVP. In both\nexperiments, the hyponatremic groups received DDAVP and the\nliquid diet. Rats in one of the hyponatremic groups and rats on\nthe solid AIN-76 diet in experiment 2 also received biweekly\n(GeroVita-\nmins, Zalmoxian Products, London, UK). Body weight was\nmeasured biweekly. The osmotic minipumps were replaced\nmonthly to maintain constant desmopressin levels. Serum or\nplasma sodium levels were monitored monthly and remained\nstable over the duration of the 3 month experiments. Survival\nblood (2 mL) was collected by tail vein venipuncture under\ninhalation anesthesia with isoflurane (3% in oxygen at 0.5 L/min).\nNonsurvival blood was collected by cardiac puncture, also under\nisoflurane anesthesia; after blood collection, isoflurane dose was\nincreased until the lack of heart contraction and respiration\nindicated death. Urine samples were collected over 24 hrs at the\nend of each month, both with and without preservative. Nine rats\nper group were studied in experiment 1 and six rats per group in\nexperiment 2.\nEvaluation of excised bones\nBone mineral density (BMD) of excised femora was measured using\ndual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) with a small-animal DXA\nscanner (Piximus II, Lunar GE, Madison, WI, USA) equipped with\nhigh-resolution scanning software (Version 2.10). Densitometer\nstability was tested daily before measurements by scanning a\nphantom provided by the company. Over the past year, stability\nwas characterized by a coefficient of variation of 0.466% from the\nlast 17 measurements. Additionally, femora were preserved in\nethanol and placed on a Delrin block supplied with the scanner.\nThree measurements were taken from each bone. The coefficient\nof variation of this measurement was 0.7%.\nMicro-computed tomographic (mCT) imaging of ethanol-\npreserved femora was performed at the University of Connecti-\ncut Health Center by Dr Douglas Adams. Trabecular and cortical\ncompartments of femora were quantified using a cone beam\nmicrofocus X-ray instrument (mCT40, Scanco Medical AG,\nBru\n\u00a8ttisellen, Switzerland). Serial tomographic images were\nrotation at 300 ms integration time. 3D images were\nreconstructed using standard convolution backprojection algo-\nrithms with Shepp and Logan filtering and rendered within a\n(isometric 16 mm voxels). Segmentation of bone from marrow\nand soft tissue was performed in conjunction with a constrained\nGaussian filter to reduce noise, applying density thresholds of\nments of the femur, respectively. Volumetric regions for\ntrabecular analysis were selected within the endosteal borders\nof the distal femoral metaphysis to include the secondary\nspongiosa located 1.6 mm ($4% of length) from the growth\nplate and extending 3.2 mm proximally. Trabecular morphome-\ntry included the bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular\nthickness (Tb.Th), trabecular number (Tb.N), and trabecular\nspacing (Tb.Sp), and these were measured directly without\nimposing a structural model (e.g., rod or plate).(25) For cortical\nmorphometry, 100 serial cross sections (1.6 mm) extending\ndistally from the diaphyseal midpoint between proximal and\ndistal growth plates were obtained. Cortical measurements\nincluded average cortical thickness, cross-sectional area of\ncortical bone, and subperiosteal cross-sectional area. Instrument\nand operator precision were quantified by repeated measure-\nHYPONATREMIA-INDUCED OSTEOPOROSIS Journal of Bone and Mineral Research 555\nments of the same bones and expressed as individual\ncoefficients of variation for each parameter of trabecular\nmorphology, yielding values of less than 3% for nearly all\nparameters, and typically less than 1%.\nBone histology and histomorphometry were done on femora\nand tibiae in experiment 1 and on femora, tibiae, and lumbar\nspine in experiment 2. To obtain dynamic histomorphometric\nparameters, rats were injected intraperitoneally at the end of\nexperiment 2 with calcein (15 mg/kg) 14 days before euthanasia\nand with xylenol orange (90 mg/kg) 3 days before euthanasia.\nExcised femora and tibiae from experiment 1 were fixed in 70%\nethanol, dehydrated in 95% ethanol, and stored in 100% ethanol.\nSample preparation and staining were carried out at the Armed\nForces Institute of Pathology, Department of Scientific Labora-\ntory (Washington, DC). The distal parts of femora were\nembedded in methyl methacrylate resin without prior decalci-\nfication. Consecutive 5 mm thick longitudinal sections were\nstained according to Von Kossa and Goldner's Masson-trichrome\nmethods. In addition, the proximal halves of the tibiae were\npreserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin, decalcified using\nformic acid solution, embedded in paraffin, and stained for\ntartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) using the acid\nphosphatase reagents and the recommended procedure from\nSigma, St. Louis, MO, USA. Similarly, excised tibiae from\nexperiment 2 were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phos-\nphate-buffered formalin (pH 7.4) at 48C for 7 days. Sample\npreparation, staining, and histomorphometric analysis were\ncarried out by the laboratory of Dr Gloria Gronowicz (Bone\nHistomorphometry Center, University of Connecticut Health\nCenter, Farmington, CT, USA). The proximal halves of tibiae were\ndecalcified in EDTA/NH3\nOH, dehydrated in progressive concen-\ntrations of ethanol, cleared in xylene, and embedded in paraffin.\nThe embedded bones were sectioned longitudinally and stained\nfor TRAP and counterstained with hematoxylin. In addition, we\ncarried out analysis on the lumbar vertebrae from experiment 2.\nBones were frozen using a liquid-nitrogen-cooled heat extractor\n(Gentle Jane, Instrumedics, Inc., Hackensack, NJ, USA) and Cryo-\nGel preservative (Instrumedics) on a metal grid. Longitudinal\n5 mm thick frozen sections were cut using a cryostat (Leica\nCM3050) and tungsten carbide knife. Sections were transferred\nto adhesive-coated slides using the CryoJane tape-transfer\nsystem (Instrumedics) and postfixed in paraformaldehyde.\nConsecutive 5 mm thick longitudinal sections were stained with\n5% silver nitrate according to the von Kossa method and\naccording to Goldner's trichrome method (protocol from\nElectron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) and for TRAP.\nFrom all sections, histomorphometric measurements were\ntaken from the secondary spongiosa and restricted to a 4 mm2\narea 400 mm distal to the growth plate\u00admetaphyseal junction,\naccording to standard procedures.(26) Histomorphometric\nmeasurements were made in a blinded, nonbiased manner\nusing the BioQuant computerized image analysis system\n(BioQuant, R&M Biometrics, Nashville, TN, USA) interfaced with\na Zeiss 410 inverted microscope. Static histomorphometric\nparameters were obtained from both experiments. Multi-\nnucleated TRAP-positive cells in close proximity to trabecular\nsurfaces were counted as osteoclasts. Dynamic histompho-\nmetric parameters were obtained from 5 mm undecalcified\nsections using fluorescence microscopy and a dual excitation\nfilter from Chroma Technology (Bellows Falls, VT, USA).\nChemistry\nSerum glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium,\npotassium, bicarbonate, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, and\nalbumin were measured using a microanalyzer. Corrected serum\ncalcium levels were calculated according to the following\nformula: Corrected calcium \u00bc measured serum calcium \u00fe [(4 \u00ad\nserum albumin) \u00c2 0.8]. Plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and\nfollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (RIA, rat-specific reagents\nfrom NIDDK National Hormone and Pituitary Program), insulin-\nlike growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (rat RIA, Diagnostic Systems\nLaboratories, Inc.), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]\nD] (RIA, DiaSorin),\n17b-estradiol (RIA, MP Biomedicals), intact rat parathyroid\nhormone (PTH) (two-site IRMA), osteocalcin (rat IRMA kit), and\ntotal and free testosterone (EIA kits, ALPCO Diagnostics) were\ndetermined by AnyLytics, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Urine pH,\nsodium, potassium, glucose, creatinine, total ketone bodies,\ncalcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and albumin were measured\nusing standard protocols of AnyLytics, Inc.\nNHANES III data analysis\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) is a cross-sectional survey that yields nationally\nrepresentative health information on the civilian, noninstitutio-\nnalized US population.(27,28) Owing to the increasing prevalence\nof hyponatremia and osteoporosis with age and the demon-\nstrated ability of T-scores to predict fractures in persons over 50\nyears of age, we focused our analyses on NHANES III participants\naged 50 years and older. Subjects with hypo-and hypercalcemia\nvated serum creatinine (>4.0 mg/dL) were excluded from\nanalyses owing to the possibility that these characteristics\nmay have been related to an underlying comorbidity that might\naffect bone density. We also excluded participants with\nhypernatremia ([Na\u00fe] > 145 mmol/L) because our interest was\nin comparing hyponatremic subjects ([Na\u00fe] < 135 mmol/L) with\nMultiple linear regression models were created to determine if\nthere were linear associations between bone mineral density\n(BMD) and serum [Na\u00fe] between hyponatremic and normona-\ntremic subjects. To test the null hypothesis that the odds of\nhaving osteoporosis were the same in persons with normona-\ntremia and hyponatremia, we also created two logistic regression\nmodels, one for the total hip and one for the femoral neck. The\nbinary dependent variable represented the presence or absence\nof osteoporosis based on the World Health Organization (WHO)\ndefinition (site-specific T-score below \u00ad2.5 SD), and the binary\nindependent variable of interest was the presence or absence of\nhyponatremia. All models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass\nindex (BMI), physical activity, history of diuretic use, and serum\npersons with hyponatremia and normonatremia, respectively. Of\nthese, thiazide diuretics were used by 10.5% and 4.7% of persons\nwith hyponatremia and normonatremia, respectively. Accord-\n556 Journal of Bone and Mineral Research VERBALIS ET AL.\ningly, three ``dummy'' variables were created to adjust for use of\nthiazide and nonthiazide diuretics relative to persons using no\ndiuretics. Dummy variables also were created to adjust for the\nknown effects of ethnicity on bone density (black versus white,\nMexican American versus white, and other versus white). The\nfinal models indicated no difference in adjusted odds of\nosteoporosis across categories of ethnicity or by smoking\nhistory. Therefore, race and smoking were excluded from the\nfinal models. There were no participants taking either selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephr-\nine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) in the hyponatremic subgroup,\nnormonatremic subgroup. Alcohol use was not included in the\nmodels because one-quarter of the sample was missing data for\nthis variable.\nStatistical analysis\nRat study results are expressed as the mean \u00c6 SEM. Statistical\nsignificance was determined by analysis using Student's t test for\ntwo-group comparison. Results from experiment 2 with four\ngroups were evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA)\nfollowed by the Holme-Sidak test for multiple pairwise group\ncomparisons and for comparisons of multiple groups against a\ncontrol group when results of multiple comparisons displayed a\nnormal distribution and equal variance. When data were not\nnormally distributed (e.g., serum vitamin D metabolite concen-\ntrations), Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance on ranks\nwas used for evaluation, followed by multiple comparisons\nagainst a control group using Dunn's method.\nThe NHANES III data were weighted to the civilian\nnoninstitutionalized population of the United States aged 50\nyears and older. Sample weights were used to adjust for unequal\nprobabilities of selection, oversampling, and nonresponse.\nStatistical analyses were performed using SAS (Version 9.1.3,\nSAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and SUDAAN (Version 9.0.1,\nResearch Triangle Institute) software.\nResults\nHyponatremia reduces bone mass in rats\nThe animal model of SIADH developed in our laboratory (24)\nemploys administration of the vasopressin V2 receptor agonist\ndesmopressin to rats fed a liquid diet to induce water retention\nand a dilutional hyponatremia. Previous results show that the\nhyponatremia is maintained as long as the desmopressin\ninfusions and liquid diet feedings are continued.(29) Using this\nprotocol, plasma or serum [Na\u00fe] levels were suppressed\nequivalently at the end of 3 months in both experiments\n(Table 1). Chronic hyponatremia did not cause observable\nchanges in the behavior and locomotive activity of the rats. There\nwere no significant differences in the weight gain or the final\nweights between rats on solid and liquid diets and between\nnormonatremic and hyponatremic rats (Table 2).\nWe assessed long-term effects of hyponatremia on BMD,\ntrabecular and cortical bone volume, static and dynamic\nhistomorphometric parameters, and the serum and urinary\nparameters of mineral metabolism and calcium regulating\nhormones after 3 months of hyponatremia in two separate\nexperiments. The first experiment was designed to establish the\neffect of sustained hyponatremia on bone mass, and the second\nexperiment was designed to reveal the effects of hyponatremia\nseparate from any potential effects on calcium metabolism.\nAnalyses of excised femurs using dual-energy X-ray absorp-\ntiometry (DXA) from experiment 1 established that hypona-\ntremia for 3 months significantly reduced BMD by approximately\n30% (p < .001) compared with normonatremic rats receiving\ndesmopressin and the same diet in a solid form (Fig. 1A). This\nfinding was reproduced in experiment 2 relative to additional\ncontrol rats fed the liquid diet alone (see Fig. 1B).\nMore detailed analyses of bone architecture using mCT\nmeasurements of excised femora also showed markedly\nreduced bone mass in the hyponatremic groups, including\ndecline of both trabecular and cortical bone parameters\n(Fig. 2A, B). Similarly, histology indicated that hyponatremia\nreduced both trabecular and cortical bone contents (see\nrepresentative images of von Kossa\u00adstained sections in Fig. 3).\nHistomorphometric analysis demonstrated that sections from\nthe femur, tibia, and spine of hyponatremic rats had reduced\nand an approximately threefold increase in trabecular\nseparation compared with sections from normonatremic\ncontrol animals (p < .01). However, there were no differences\nin the width of the growth plates, osteoid thickness, or osteoid\nvolume (data not shown).\nThe most striking histologic finding was that hyponatremia\nincreased the number of osteoclasts per bone area, defined as\ntartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)\u00adpositive multinu-\ncleated cells, by fivefold compared with normonatremic controls\nTable 1.

Similarly, in experiment 2,\nboth osteoclast numbers per bone area and osteoclast surface\nper bone surface were increased in both hyponatremic groups\ncompared with normonatremic controls (both p < .01; see\nFig. 4B). Indexes of bone formation did not show statistically\nsignificant differences between groups, although there was\na tendency toward lower mineral apposition rate (MAR) and\nbone-formation rate per trabecular bone surface (BFR/BS) in\nhyponatremic rats compared with control groups (MAR: control\nrats on solid diet with vitamin D treatment 1.27 \u00c6 0.21 mm/day\nand on liquid diet 1.23 \u00c6 0.04 mm/day versus hyponatremic rats\n0.64 \u00c6 0.3 mm/day; BFR/BS: control rats on solid diet with vitamin\nm3/m2 per day). Mineralizing surface per bone surface in the\ndynamic histomorphometry and osteoblast surface per bone\nsurface in the static histomorphometry did not show differences\nbetween the control and hyponatremic groups.\nAnalyses of serum and urinary markers of renal and liver\nfunctions and acid balance failed to reveal any consistent\nabnormalities. All the rats on liquid diet had low levels of serum\nvitamin D metabolites (both normal and hyponatremic)\n(Table 2); these levels were more reduced in hyponatremic\nthan in normonatremic rats. Consistent with the reduced\nconcentrations in hyponatremic rats, serum\ncalcium concentrations also were reduced in hyponatremic\nrats in experiment 1 (9.8 \u00c6 0.2 mg/dL in hyponatremic versus\nreduced serum vitamin D metabolite levels did not increase\nPTH levels in either experiment 1 or experiment 2 or\ncause mineralization defects recognizable by bone histology.\nMoreover, the difference in serum calcium concentrations in\nexperiment 2 were not statistically significant, the mean values\nremained within normal ranges, and the urinary calcium\nexcretion was unaffected (see Table 2). Therefore, it appeared\nto be unlikely that vitamin D deficiency was a significant factor\nin the hyponatremia-induced reductions in bone mass.\nAccordingly, treatment with vitamin D in experiment 2\nincreased serum 25(OH)D levels, urinary calcium excretion\nalso showed a trend to increase (but not statistically\nsignificant), and serum PTH levels showed a trend to decrease\n(but not statistically significant) in both the control and\nhyponatremic animals and slightly reduced the degree of\nreduction of bone mass (p < .05; see Fig. 1B).\nThe hyponatremic rats were found to have lower testosterone\nand slightly elevated LH and FSH levels compared with\nnormonatremic controls in experiment 1 (free testoster-\nFig. 1.

Cross-sectional association between hyponatremia and the odds\nof osteoporosis in adults aged 50 years and older in NHANES III. Odds of\nosteoporosis for the total hip and femoral neck in hyponatremic relative\nto normonatremic adults. Osteoporosis is defined as sex-specific BMD at\nthe hip (total and femoral neck) of 2.5 or fewer standard deviations below\nthe mean of whites aged 20 to 29 years. Data are expressed as the\nadjusted odds of osteoporosis in hyponatremic relative to normonatre-\nmic participants at the two sites, with the 95% confidence interval (CI) for\nthe estimates. Odds ratios are adjusted for age, sex, body mass index,\nphysical activity, serum 25(OH)D3\nlevels (ng/mL), and diuretic use (thia-\nzide and nonthiazide). The p values for the association of hyponatremia\nwith osteoporosis were .043 for total hip and .003 for femoral neck.\n560 Journal of Bone and Mineral Research VERBALIS ET AL.\nDiscussion\nThe studies presented here demonstrate that chronic hypona-\ntremia significantly diminishes bone mass in an animal model of\nthe human disease of SIADH. It is particularly striking that the\n30% reduction in BMD found in the hyponatremic rats is\napproximately twice that reported in various well-established rat\nosteoporosis models over similar periods of time using similar\ndensitometry methods, for example, 12\u00ad17% after ovariectomy\n12% with vitamin D deficiency.(30) Thus chronic hyponatremia\nrepresents a robust new animal model for the study of bone\nmineral metabolism and osteoporosis.\nPrevious studies using the animal model of SIADH developed\nin our laboratory have indicated that after several days of\nsustained hyponatremia, cellular volume regulation is completed\nin the brain,(14) after which longer-term compensatory mechan-\nisms predominate. Owing to these compensatory mechanisms,\nchronic hyponatremia in humans often remains clinically\n``asymptomatic.'' This may explain why potential long-term\nadverse effects have not been carefully evaluated in controlled\nstudies. However, recent reports have suggested that chronic\nhyponatremia is associated with significant adverse neurologic\neffects on cognitive function and gait stability and results in\nhigher frequency of falls.(33) A recent study from Belgian found\nthat mild asymptomatic hyponatremia was associated with\nincreased bone fracture incidence in ambulatory elderly\nBMD changes or potential metabolic consequences of hypona-\ntremia have yet to be described. Our studies therefore represent\nthe first demonstration that chronic hyponatremia also causes\nsubstantial metabolic effects in organs other than the brain.\nAlthough several factors may contribute to the induced bone\nloss seen with hyponatremia, the most notable is a marked\nactivation of osteoclastic bone resorption. This effect is\nconsistent with previous reports indicating that release of\nstored sodium from bone requires resorptive activity. The\nmechanisms of sodium sensing and sodium-concentration-\ndependent activation of osteoclasts are not known and warrant\nfurther studies. Another potential factor that may contribute to\nthe activation of osteoclastic bone resorption is hypogonadism.\nRecent reports indicated that the increased FSH, although mild,\ncould contribute to increased bone resorption and bone loss to\nsome extent.(35) However, serum estradiol levels, which are felt to\nrepresent the major factor associated with bone loss in\nhypogonadal males,(36,37) were not significantly different\nbetween the hyponatremic and control rats, and the decreased\nbone-formation indexes argue against a high-turnover type of\nosteopenia.\nMild vitamin D deficiency potentially would be consistent with\nthe decreased bone formation in this model. While vitamin D\nlevels are reduced in this model, replacement of vitamin D only\nslightly decreased the hyponatremia-induced reductions in bone\nmass in experiment 2. The lack of undermineralization by\nhistology supports the notion that vitamin D deficiency is not a\nmajor mechanism responsible for the hyponatremia-induced\ndecline in BMD. Nonetheless, each of these factors will need to\nbe explored via further studies to fully understand the degree to\nwhich they might contribute to the markedly reduced bone\ndensity found with chronic hyponatremia.\nBone resorption is carried out by osteoclasts, a process that is\nsubject to regulation by hormones and cytokines. These factors\ninfluence the number and activities of osteoclasts in concert with\nactivation of bone formation by osteoblasts. It is well known that\nhormonal and metabolic changes can uncouple bone resorption\nand formation, leading to bone loss and increased fragility.(38)\nAccelerated osteoclastic bone resorption has a central role in the\npathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis, a leading cause\nof morbidity in individuals over the age of 60 years.(39) Correction\nof hormonal abnormalities, calcium and vitamin D replacement,\nand antiresorptive therapy can reduce bone loss and fracture risk\nin over 50% of cases,(40) indicating the importance of identifying\nand treating secondary causes of osteoporosis. If hyponatremia\nrepresents an additional unrecognized risk factor for osteo-\nporosis in humans, appropriate preventive and therapeutic\nmeasures therefore would be warranted.\nCross-sectional data from NHANES III showing that hypona-\ntremia is associated with significantly increased odds of\nosteoporosis in humans support the experimental data in\nrodents and suggest direct clinical implications for these\nfindings. However, it should be noted that the NHANES data\nare cross-sectional, a design consideration that precludes our\nfindings from being interpreted in a causal framework. None-\ntheless, the NHANES data clearly show strong, consistent\nassociations between hyponatremia and osteoporosis at the\nfemoral neck and total hip. These results were adjusted for a\nnumber of factors that are known to be strongly and causally\nassociated with osteoporosis, further suggesting an independent\nrole for hyponatremia in osteoporosis. Our results apply only to\nadults aged 50 years and older without hyper- or hypocalcemia\nand without elevated serum creatinine because these were\nselection criteria for inclusion in the analysis sample. Although\nthese exclusions reduce the generalizability of results to a certain\ndegree, our exclusion criteria represent acceptable tradeoffs with\nrespect to identifying a clinically relevant age group for studies of\nnovel risk factors for osteoporosis and to ensuring exclusion of\npersons with clinical profiles that could be consistent with\nunderlying comorbidities affecting bone density. Despite these\nexclusions, the consistent associations between hyponatremia\nand osteoporosis in the NHANES analysis are not only\nnoteworthy, but they are also generalizeable to adults nation-\nwide who share clinical characteristics similar to those examined\nin this report.\nAlthough hyponatremia may engage common pathways as\nother causes of osteoporosis, hyponatremia-induced bone\nresorption and osteoporosis are unique in that they represent\nattempts of the body to preserve sodium homeostasis at the\nexpense of bone structural integrity. It is of interest that a\ndecreased extracellular sodium concentration may represent the\nsignal to mobilize bone stores of sodium via bone matrix\nresorption. This would explain previous data that low-sodium\ndiets are not associated with osteoporosis (41) because serum\nsodium concentrations generally are maintained within normal\nranges despite wide variations in sodium intake. Consequently,\nour results suggest that hyponatremia, rather than dietary\nsodium intake, represents a significant, previously unrecognized\nHYPONATREMIA-INDUCED OSTEOPOROSIS Journal of Bone and Mineral Research 561\nrisk factor for the development of osteoporosis. Based on these\nfindings in rats in association with our analysis of human data\nfrom NHANES III, we recommend that bone quality should be\nassessed in all patients with chronic hyponatremia and\nappropriate treatment initiated where indicated.\nWhile the incidence of osteoporosis solely owing to\nhyponatremia is likely relatively small, its true clinical significance\nlies in the likelihood that even mild chronic hyponatremia might\nact additively or synergistically with other causes of bone loss\nthat occur commonly with aging, thereby contributing to\nmorbidity and mortality in this increasing segment of the\npopulation. Whether activation of similar metabolic pathways in\nother cells and tissues might explain the well-known association\nbetween hyponatremia and poor clinical outcome across a wide\nvariety of different disease processes,(1) and potentially even\naccelerate the aging process itself, remains intriguing possibi-\nlities for future research.\nDisclosures\nJGV and JB contributed equally to this study.
