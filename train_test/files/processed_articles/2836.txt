We investigate the\ncyclicality of SME lending by local banks with vs. without a public mandate, controlling for\nlocation, size, loan maturity, funding structure, liquidity, profitability, and credit demand-side\nfactors. The public mandate is set by local governments and stipulates a deviation from strict\nprofit maximization and a sustainable provision of financial services to local customers. We\nfind that banks with a public mandate are 25 percent less cyclical than other local banks. The\nresult is credit supply-side driven and especially strong for savings banks with high liquidity\nand stable deposit funding. Our findings have implications for the banking structure, financial\nstability and the finance-growth nexus in a local context.\n",

Too many (too few) firms may obtain credit in a\nboom (recession). Regulations like the risk-sensitive capital requirements introduced with the\nBasel II Accord may further increase cyclical bank lending behavior. In a recession, the\nhigher ex ante default risk of bank borrowers triggers higher capital requirements for banks\nunder risk-sensitive capital rules, which may lead to a decrease of credit supply and a\ntightening of lending standards. Fewer firms and households obtain credit. This mechanism\nlowers corporate investments and consumer spending, and thereby amplifies the recession.\nThe opposite effect occurs during an economic boom, where excessive credit expansion may\nlead to an overheating of the economy. In recent years, policymakers and regulators have\ntherefore undertaken significant efforts to reduce the cyclicality of bank lending. These\ncomprise, for instance, macro-prudential policy tools, such as dynamic loan loss provisioning\nrules (Spain, Colombia and Peru), countercyclical capital buffers (Basel III Accord), loan-to-\nvalue caps (Japan), time-varying systemic liquidity surcharges, and stressed value-at-risk\nIn this paper we investigate whether the cyclicality of lending depends on government\ninvolvement in banks. In our analysis, we focus on lending to small and medium-sized\nenterprises (SMEs) for several reasons. SMEs represent the vast majority of all firms and they\ncontribute significantly to overall employment and growth in many countries. However,\nSMEs are more opaque, riskier, more financially constrained and more bank-dependent than\nlarge firms (e.g., Petersen and Rajan 1995). Therefore, bank lending to SMEs has always been\nprone to market failure because of problems arising from severe information asymmetries and\nits unattractive risk return profile. Financial institutions with special business objectives have\nemerged to overcome market failure (e.g., local savings banks and credit cooperatives in\nEurope; credit unions in the U.S.; international and domestic development banks). In addition,\ngovernment-led lending programs including direct subsidies and/or guarantees (e.g., the Small\nBusiness Administration (SBA) in the U.S.), and special lending technologies, such as small\nbusiness credit scoring and relationship lending, help overcome the inherent fragility of SME\nlending.\nBanks' business objectives, including profit orientation and other goals, fundamentally\ninfluence their lending behavior, in particular their scale, scope and timing. The main\nhypothesis of this paper is that government involvement in banks in the form of a \"public\nmandate\" lowers the cyclicality of SME lending. The public mandate is included in the banks'\nby-laws by local governments and stipulates a deviation from strict profit maximization and a\nsustainable provision of financial services to the local economy. Banks with such a public\nmandate are more likely to follow the business cycle than other banks, but we conjecture that\nthey do this to a lesser degree than other banks. If such banks effectively follow their public\nmandate, the lower cyclicality should be credit supply-side driven and not a consequence of\ndifferences in their borrower structures. Recent studies show that these banks help reduce\nfinancial constraints of SMEs (Behr et al., 2013) and that the performance of these banks is\npositively related to local economic development (Hakenes et al., 2015).\nTo test our hypothesis, we use panel data from around 800 German banks spanning the\nperiod from 1987 to 2007. Germany provides a particularly useful environment to test our\nhypothesis because of two institutional features. First, 96 percent of all firms in the German\neconomy are SMEs according to the definition of the European Commission (2006), which\nenables us to focus on SME lending. Second, Germany has a banking system in which local\nbanks with a public mandate and banks without a public mandate have been co-existing for\nbanks with a public mandate are known as savings banks, the other local banks are credit\ncooperatives. Both types of banks are small, local, and focus on simple business models\n(deposit taking and lending). They are also both geographically constrained as their by-laws\nallow them to provide loans only to borrowers from the same county. Importantly, savings\nbanks were founded by local governments in the 18th and 19th century (i.e., municipalities or\ncounty governments) and the public mandate is a binding legacy incorporated by the founders\nin the by-laws.1\nUsing this institutional setting we compare the cyclicality of SME lending by savings\nbanks with that of credit cooperatives from the same location. We measure lending cyclicality\nby estimating the sensitivity of banks' growth in SME lending to GDP growth and various\nalternative proxies. Our empirical set-up keeps bank size and geographic focus constant and\nenables us to directly test whether banks' business objectives that derive from the public\nmandate affect the cyclicality of the lending behavior. To the best of our knowledge, ours is\nthe first study that establishes a link between the cyclicality of SME lending and government\ninvolvement in local banks.\nWe obtain a surprisingly strong result. We find that SME lending by savings banks is on\naverage 25 percent less sensitive to GDP growth than that of cooperative banks from the same\narea. The effect is economically large and statistically highly significant. Such a strong\ndifference in the cyclicality of SME lending is surprising because savings banks and\ncooperative banks are both local banks and focus on basic financial services. We control for\nbank location, size, funding structure, profitability and credit demand-side factors using\ninteracted region-year fixed effects. The result remains robust when we use alternative\nmeasures of cyclicality, such as regional GDP growth, real growth in investments and the\n1 Furthermore, local politicians usually fulfil important supervisory functions in the savings banks and can\ntherewith exert influence on their lending behavior. In the remainder of the paper, we will refer to savings banks\nas public mandate banks and banks with government involvement interchangeably.\ncredit demand indicator from the European Central Bank's Bank Lending Survey. We further\nrule out that the lower cyclicality of savings banks' SME lending is due to bank size. One\ncould argue that smaller banks are less cyclical because the credit demand of their borrowers\nis less cyclical. However, the less cyclical savings banks are on average bigger than the credit\ncooperatives in our sample. We also find that all size groups within the savings bank sector\nare less cyclical than credit cooperatives, and we do not find that smaller credit cooperatives\nare less cyclical than bigger ones. Interestingly, we find that savings banks with the highest\nliquidity and the most stable deposit funding structure exhibit the lowest cyclicality in SME\nlending, suggesting that these banks are the ones that are best able to follow the public\nmandate. Moreover, the main result is credit supply-side driven. We document that the lower\ncyclicality of savings banks is significantly more pronounced in regions where bank\ncompetition is low. This is plausible because the observed lending should be closer to the\nintended credit supply in regions in which bank competition is relatively low as the\nbargaining power of banks vis-\u00e0-vis their borrowers is relatively high in such areas. We also\nshow that political influence, which affects to some extent the lending behavior of savings\nbanks, cannot explain the difference in the lending cyclicality between savings and\ncooperative banks. Finally, we rule out that the lower cyclicality of savings banks is\nassociated with a different attitude towards risk-taking.\nOverall, the evidence suggests that differences in business objectives of small local banks\nare the main driver of differences in their lending cyclicality. This conclusion has several\nimportant policy implications. First, policymakers can determine the cyclicality of local\nbanking markets by deciding on the mix of banks that follow strict profit maximization and\nthose that deviate from strict profit maximization to follow sustainability goals. This decision\nresults in banking systems characterized by high risk-high return, low risk-low return, or\nintermediate solutions. Second, one possibility to promote local economic growth is to\npromote SME lending. This can be achieved with local banks that follow a public mandate or\nsimilar institutional arrangements, such as government-sponsored or guaranteed lending, as\ndone by the Small Business Administration in the U.S. Our findings suggest that the public\nmandate reaches the goals envisaged by the banks' founders. Third, counter-cyclical\nregulations, such as capital buffers or dynamic loan loss provisions, are less necessary for\nbanks that already exhibit a lower cyclicality because of their business objectives.\nOur study contributes to research on the cyclicality of credit and research on government\ninvolvement in banks. First, recent research shows that public debt (corporate bonds) and\nprivate debt (bank loans) exhibit a different cyclicality. Becker and Ivashina (2014) examine\nthe cyclicality of overall credit supply using data on new debt issuances of large, publicly\nlisted U.S. firms. Firms switch from bank loans to bonds in times of tight lending standards,\nreduced aggregate lending, poor bank performance and monetary contraction. They show that\nthis substitution effect from private debt to public debt has predictive power for funding\nprovided by banks and corporate investments. Our paper focuses on an important component\nof the credit market that was excluded from their work, i.e., lending to SMEs.\nSecond, our work relates more generally to research on government involvement in banks.\nOn the one hand, there is evidence from cross-country studies that compare the lending\nbehavior of privately owned banks with that of government-owned or government-controlled\nmainly lend to large international firms, the public sector, and the government. The main\nfinding in these studies is that the large, central government-owned banks exhibit\nunderperformance and inefficient credit allocation because of agency problems, political\nIllueca et al., 2014; Carvalho, 2014). We note that virtually all studies in this field are based\non data from relatively large, central or regional government-owned banks. On the other hand,\nthere are studies that document positive aspects of government involvement in banking in the\ncontext of economic development (e.g., Stiglitz, 1993; Burgess and Pande, 2005; Ostergaard\net al., 2009). Government involvement in commercial or consumer banking aims at ensuring\ncredit supply to SMEs, promoting home ownership through mortgage lending, or fighting\npoverty. The reason for government involvement is market failure, i.e., capital markets and\nprivately owned banks fail to offer certain financial services. Behr et al. (2013) show that the\nlending behavior of small local banks in Germany that follow a public mandate helps to\nreduce financial constraints of SMEs. These banks neither underperform nor do they take\nmore risks than other banks. Moreover, Hakenes et al. (2015) find that the performance of\nsavings banks in Germany is positively related to local economic development. They\ndocument a beneficial effect of local banking on economic growth, while we document a\nbeneficial effect on the cyclicality of SME lending. Our result is consistent with their findings\nbut our explanation is different. We show that the lower cyclicality of SME lending by\nsavings banks is not due to a bank size effect but due to the public mandate of savings banks\nthat defines their business objectives. Moreover, Shen et al. (2014) analyze banks from more\nare on par with that of private banks. Underperformance is only found if government-owned\nbanks are required to purchase a distressed bank because of political factors. In addition, there\nis evidence that the outcomes of government involvement in banks depend on the legal and\npolitical institutions of the country (e.g., K\u00f6rner and Schnabel, 2011; Bertay et al., 2014). Our\nstudy contributes to this literature by showing that the cyclicality of small local banks' SME\nlending differs and that this difference largely depends on their business objectives.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the\ninstitutional background. In Section 3 we describe the data and provide descriptive statistics.\nIn Section 4 we explain our empirical strategy, report the main results, and summarize\nfindings from robustness tests. In Section 5 we investigate potential mechanisms through\nwhich the cyclicality of SME lending can be lowered. In Section 6 we perform further\nempirical checks and investigate alternative explanations. Section 7 concludes.\n2 Institutional background\nThe German financial system provides an ideal setting to test whether the cyclicality of SME\nlending by public mandate banks differs from that of banks without a public mandate. The\nGerman economy is dominated by SMEs that account for about 96 percent of all firms\n(European Commission, 2006). These SMEs largely depend on bank financing, in particular\nprovided by small local banks. The German banking system can be characterized as a typical\nuniversal banking system comprising three major pillars: the private credit banks, the credit\ncooperatives, and the banks with government involvement. Banks from these three pillars\nhave different business objectives, governance, and organizational structures, but they all\nhave to comply with the same regulatory and supervisory standards.\nThe sector of banks with government involvement consists of a large number of relatively\nsmall savings banks and a small number of large money center banks, known as\n\"Landesbanks\" (and excluded from our study).2 According to official data from the Deutsche\nBundesbank approximately 27 percent of total bank assets in Germany were held by banks\nwith government involvement in 2013 and 13 percent by savings banks. Savings banks\naccount for 19 percent of lending to non-banks. Specific rules in the by-laws and regional\nbanking laws constrain savings banks to operate locally and to focus on the provision of basic\nfinancial services like deposit taking and lending. Savings banks were established and are\ncontrolled by the municipalities of the geographic area in which they operate (i.e., city or\ncounty council). They do not have any owners. The key characteristic of these banks is their\npublic mandate that is stated in their by-laws. It stipulates to ensure non-discriminatory\nprovision of financial services to all citizens and particularly to SMEs in the region, to\nstrengthen competition in the banking business (even in rural areas), to promote savings, and\nto sponsor a broad range of social commitments (Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverband,\n2014). Furthermore, the by-laws require savings banks to operate only in the city or county\nthey are headquartered in. It is noteworthy that banks with similar characteristics, governance\nand business objectives exist in many other countries, for example, Austria, France, Norway,\nSpain, and Switzerland.\nThe privately owned cooperative banking sector, which consists of a large number of\nsmall credit cooperatives, accounted for 9 percent of total bank assets and for 13 percent of\n2 Landesbanks serve as regional money center banks for savings banks in their region, as housebanks for\nregional governments, and are active in complex financial services and international banking. The recent history\nof the Landesbanks shows the conditions under which government involvement in the banking sector has led to\nunderperformance and negative real effects (e.g., misallocation of credit, negative impact on real growth,\npolitical influence, as in La Porta et al., 2002). Because of their hybrid business model, we do not consider these\nbanks in our study.\ntotal lending to non-banks by the end of 2013.3 The size of this sector in the German banking\nsystem is, thus, comparable to that of the savings banks. The size and the business model of\nthe credit cooperatives are similar to those of the savings banks. They are regionally oriented\nand focus almost entirely on lending to local SMEs. Their private ownership results in a much\nmore pronounced profit maximization orientation, as explicitly written in the by-laws of\ncooperative banks. Credit cooperatives are small and local but not subject to government\ninvolvement, which makes it possible for us to examine the effects of the latter on the\ncyclicality of savings banks' SME lending. Similar to savings banks, credit cooperatives are\nnot idiosyncratic to the German banking system but can be found in many countries around\nthe world. For instance, the sister of the German credit cooperative in the U.S. is the credit\nunion. What is special to the German banking system is the long-run historic co-existence of\nsavings banks and credit cooperatives, which creates an ideal setting to test our main\nhypothesis.\nWe base our analysis of yearly bank-level data on balance sheets and income statements of\nunbalanced panel. To be able to analyze bank behavior over the business cycle, we consider\nonly banks with a minimum of five consecutive bank-year observations. In case of a merger\nor an acquisition, the observation for the respective year in which the event occurs is excluded\nfrom the data. The final sample comprises 461 savings and 330 cooperative banks, resulting\nby German savings banks and 63% of the assets held by German cooperative banks by the\nend of 2013. Table 1 reports summary statistics, calculated from average values over the time\nseries for each bank. We report the mean and standard deviation separately for savings and\ncooperatives banks as well as the difference in means and a t-test for significance of these\ndifferences.\nOur dependent variable is the growth in lending to SMEs, defined as the percentage\nchange of bank i's total loans to SMEs from the year t\u00ad1 to the year t: _ ,\n=\n( ) ( )\n( )\n. This variable is computed using bank and year-specific total\nlending and the sector-wide and year-specific fraction of loans to SMEs. Lending to banks is\n3 There are also head institutions in the cooperative banking sector. Like the Landesbanks, these cooperative\nhead institutions are not included in our analysis.\n4 Investment advisory firms, building societies, branches of foreign banks, and other specialized banks (also\nLandesbanks and head institutions of cooperatives) are excluded as well as atypical banks with a ratio of total\ncustomer loans to total assets below 25%.\n5 Our sample period ends before the start of the financial crisis of 2007-2009 because during these years\nextraordinary events in the financial system confounded the normal link between loan growth and GDP growth,\nmaking it impossible to study cyclicality of bank lending during this time period.\nTable 1: Summary statistics\nThis table reports the mean and standard deviation of key variables for savings banks and cooperative banks in\nGermany. All statistics are based on the average values per bank over time. SME_LG is de-trended and\nVariable description Variable Savings banks\nCooperative\nbanks\nDifference\nMean St.Dev. Mean St.Dev.

We de-trend the growth rates to adjust them for inflation and to make them\ncomparable to our business cycle indicators which represent real numbers. We further\nwinsorize SME loan growth at the 0.5% and 99.5%-percentile.6 On average, SME_LG for\nsavings banks is significantly higher for savings banks (1.29%) than for cooperative banks\n(0.49%). We further see that savings banks are on average significantly larger than\ncooperative banks, as indicated by total assets (TOTASSET) and total customers loans\n(CUSTLOAN). The relative interest income ( ,\n= ( )\n( , )\n) is an indirect\nmeasure of the average loan interest rate and not significantly different between savings banks\n(6.89%) and cooperative banks (6.84%). The relative net interest result ( ,\n) is similarly\ndefined except that in the numerator interest expenses as the bank's refinancing costs and loan\nloss provisions in the respective year are subtracted. This bank profitability measure is\nsignificantly higher for cooperative (1.50%) than for savings banks (0.74%). Furthermore, the\nequity-to-total assets ratio ( ,\n) \u00ad a key measure of bank solvency \u00ad is on average 4.40%\nfor savings banks and 5.12% for cooperative banks. The liquid assets ratio ( ,\n) is\nslightly smaller in savings banks (2.53%) than in cooperative banks (2.68%). Additionally, we\ncontrol for the maturity structure of a bank's loan portfolio by defining the long-term loan\nratio ( ,\n= ), which is significantly higher for savings\nbanks (69.3%) than for cooperative banks (59.3%). The interbank loan ratio ( ,\n=\n) indicates that cooperative banks (17.2%) are on average more active in\n6 This transformation does not influence the results presented below.\nThe figure displays the time series of real GDP growth of Germany. The grey-shaded areas indicate the two\ninterbank lending than savings banks (13.3%). It can be seen that cooperative banks rely\nsignificantly more on deposit funding during the sample period. The statistically significant\ndifferences of these variables between savings and cooperative banks indicate that they should\nbe included in the regression analyses because they might (at least partially) explain the\nvariation in SME loan growth rates.\nFinally, we use the real GDP growth rate in Germany as a standard indicator of the\nbusiness cycle. Our results are similar when we use alternative indicators of the business\ncycle. The GDP growth rate is computed using macroeconomic data from OECD statistics. Its\ndevelopment over the period 1987-2007 is displayed in Figure 1. As can be seen, our sample\n4 Empirical analysis\n4.1 Model specification\nWe estimate the following regression model with data on bank i in year t:\n_ ,\n= +  + (   ) + + _ ,\n+ _ ,\n+ + ,\n+ ,\n.\nThe bank-year-specific growth rate of lending to SMEs ( _ ,\n) is regressed on the\nyear-specific German real GDP growth rate ( ). In order to distinguish the differential\nReal GDP growth [%]\nyears\nRecessions Booms GDP growth\nimpact of macroeconomic fluctuations on loan growth between savings banks and cooperative\nbanks, we interact an indicator variable that takes on the value of one in the case of a savings\nbank with the real GDP growth rate (   ). As argued above, our hypothesis does\nnot imply that savings banks do not display any cyclical behavior but only that savings banks\nare less cyclical than cooperative banks. Hence, we expect a positive coefficient and a\nnegative coefficient for the interaction term.\nWe note that bank-specific SME loan growth rates exhibit second-order autocorrelation,\nfor which we control by including the SME loan growth rates of the two preceding years\n( _ ,\nand _ ,\n). From an econometric perspective, the estimation of\ncoefficients for lagged dependent variables with panel data suffers from the dynamic panel\nbias (Nickell, 1981). Therefore, we apply the dynamic one-step System GMM dynamic panel\nestimator of Blundell and Bond (1998) with Windmeijer's (2005) finite sample correction,\nwhere bank-specific fixed effects are purged by the forward orthogonal deviations\ntransformation of GMM\u00adtype instruments.\nWe add a vector of bank-specific control variables (Xt\u00ad1\n) that correspond to the ones\nreported in Table 1. Due to the potentially significant correlation between these variables,\nsome model specifications include only a subset thereof. Further, in some specifications we\ninclude year fixed effects ( ) or interacted year*region fixed effects ( ,\n), where the regions\nare the federal states in which the banks are located. The inclusion of interacted year*region\nfixed effects controls for region and time-specific demand side shocks that might hit savings\nand cooperative banks differently and therefore explain their different SME loan growth\nindependent of the growth of real GDP.\n4.2 Baseline results\nTable 2 presents the baseline results. In column 1 we report results for the specification\nwithout any control variables except the lagged SME real loan growth rates. The interaction\nterm   is negative and statistically significant at the 1%-level. This finding shows\nthat savings banks display a significantly lower cyclicality in SME lending than cooperative\nbanks, which is in line with our hypothesis. The result also shows that, while savings banks\nseem to be less cyclical than cooperative banks, they still engage to some extent in cyclical\nlending behavior because the total effect of  and   is positive (0.487 -\nIn column 2 we add variables to control for observed heterogeneity between savings\nbanks and cooperative banks. The main result does not change. In column 3 we add year fixed\neffects to control for time trends that may affect credit supply. Again, the main result is\nconfirmed.

Models (1)-(4) are estimated using the one-\nstep System GMM estimator introduced by Blundell and Bond (1998), where bank-specific fixed effects are purged by the\nforward orthogonal deviations transformation of GMM\u00adtype instruments. These instruments are created for our main\nregressors LGi;t-2\nand (GDPt *\n), and in order to bring the number of instruments in line with our finite sample\nsize, the number of lags used is limited accordingly. Furthermore, we create a collapsed set of GMM\u00adtype instruments for the\ncontrol variables RIIi;t-1\n, RNIRi,t-1\n, ETAi;t-1\n, LIQTAi,t-1\n, LTLRi,t-1\n, IBLRi,t-1\nand DEPRi;t-1\n.

Again, we find a significantly positive\ncoefficient for  and a significantly negative coefficient for   , implying that\nthe credit supply of savings banks is approximately 25 percent less sensitive to GDP growth\nthan that of cooperative banks (2\n= -0.256). In all subsequent analyses we consider the\nspecification in column 4 as our baseline model.\nThe estimates presented in column 5 are based on the same explanatory variables as in\ncolumn 4, but they are estimated using an ordinary least-squares estimator with bank-level\nfixed effects instead of the System GMM dynamic panel estimator applied in columns 1-4.\nThe coefficients show that the previous results are confirmed.\nIn column 6 we re-estimate the specification from column 4 on a propensity score-\nmatched sample (PSM) of savings and cooperative banks. The matching is based on the bank\nvariables displayed in Table 1. We use Kernel matching to create the two samples. The PSM\nprocedure should alleviate concerns that, despite controlling for observable differences in key\nbank variables, the comparability of the two bank types is limited because of unobserved\ndifferences in the two samples.7 Again, we find a significant difference in the cyclicality of\nSME lending by savings banks and cooperative banks.8 Both bank types display cyclical\nlending behavior, but savings banks are significantly less cyclical than cooperative banks.\nThese results are consistent with the conjecture that the deviation from strict profit\nmaximization reduces the extent to which banks exhibit cyclical lending behavior.\n4.3 Further evidence and robustness tests\nOne could argue that the indicator for the business cycle - GDP growth - does not fully reflect\nthe state of the economy. Moreover, it is possible that the lower cyclicality of savings banks is\nstage-dependent and potentially asymmetric. It could be that the average result is driven by a\nparticular lending behavior in one stage of the business cycle, i.e., smaller increase of lending\nin a boom or smaller decrease of lending in a recession. We address these concerns in two\nsteps.\n7 We acknowledge that the matching procedure is based on observable characteristics only and the two samples\nmight still differ in terms of unobservable characteristics that we are not able to control for in the regressions. To\nthe extent that such characteristics are correlated with the real GDP growth, they might affect our results.\n8 In additional analyses we compare savings banks and cooperative banks with privately owned commercial\nbanks in Germany. Commercial banks exhibit significantly higher cyclicality than the two other types of banks.\nHowever, considering that the commercial banks are not comparable to savings banks and cooperative banks in\nterms of size and business model we do not report the results here. The results are available from the authors on\nrequest.\nTable 3: Alternative indicators of the business cycle\nThe dependent variable is the real growth rate of loans to SMEs (LG_SMEi;t\n).

The first lag of\nthe IFO business climate index (IFOt-1\n), the real regional GDP growth rate (RegGDPt\n), real investment growth (INVESTt\n),\nand the loan demand by SMEs as measured by European Bank Lending Survey data (BLS_SMEt\n) serve as macro variables.\nWe report robust standard errors using Windmeijer's (2005) finite sample correction in parentheses below coefficients.\nSignificance levels *: 10% **: 5% ***: 1%.\n* RegGDPt\nLG_SMEi, t-1\nLG_SMEi, t-2\nBank controls and fixed effects yes yes yes yes\nWald test for 1\nFirst, we repeat our analysis with alternative indicators for the business cycle. As\nmentioned before, in all subsequent analyses we use - whenever econometrically possible -\nthe specification from column 4 in Table 2.\nIn column 1 of Table 3 we use the IFO business climate index as an alternative to GDP\ngrowth. This is a widely used survey-based index that indicates the state of the German\neconomy. The IFO index tends to be a leading indicator of actual GDP growth. Most\nimportantly, we find that the coefficient of the interaction term SAVi\nis significantly\nnegative, which is consistent with our baseline results. In column 2 we use the regional real\nGDP growth rate rather than the country-wide real GDP growth rate. Again, we obtain the\nsame findings: the coefficient of the real regional GDP growth rate is positive and the\ncoefficient of the interaction with the savings banks dummy is negative and significant. In\ncolumn 3 we use the growth rate of real investments and confirm our main result. In column 4\nwe use data from the Bank Lending Survey conducted by the European Central Bank.9 In this\nspecification we can directly rule out credit demand-side explanations for the differences in\ncyclicality across banks because the survey only gauges the credit supply side. Again, we find\nthat SME lending by savings banks exhibits a significantly lower cyclicality than that of\ncooperative banks. While the economic magnitudes of the effects are not directly comparable\nto the baseline result, we find that the composite effect is still positive in all four\nspecifications, indicating again that both bank types engage in cyclical lending behavior, but\nthe savings banks do so to a lesser degree. These results confirm that our main finding\nremains robust when we use alternative indicators of the business cycle.\nSecond, we replace GDP growth with two indicator variables that take on the value of one\nin periods with HIGH or LOW GDP growth, respectively, and zero otherwise. We use\nGermany's mean real GDP growth during the sample period as one split criterion to identify\nperiods with relatively high or low growth, and GDP growth = 0% as another split criterion to\nidentify periods with absolute growth or decline. This analysis makes it possible to examine\nwhether the reduced cyclicality in SME lending is symmetric through the cycle or\nasymmetric, i.e., only present in certain phases of the economic cycle. Table 4 presents the\nresults.\nIn column 1 of Table 4 we use the mean real GDP growth rate as a split criterion for\nHIGH and LOW periods. We find that the growth of SME lending by savings banks is\nsignificantly lower than that of cooperative banks during booms (coefficient of SAVi\n*\n=\n-0.389). We further find that the coefficient of SAVi\nis positive but not\nstatistically significant. In column 2 of Table 4 we use the 0% as a split criterion and find a\nstrong and symmetric effect through the business cycle: SME lending by savings banks grows\nat a lower rate than that of cooperative banks in periods with positive GDP growth and,\ninterestingly, it grows even during periods with negative GDP growth. The latter finding\nsuggests that savings banks are not only less cyclical but counter-cyclical during negative\nGDP growth periods. Such behavior may be sustainable because it is symmetric through the\nbusiness cycle, leading to an inter-temporal smoothing of credit supply.\n9 The Bank Lending Survey from the ECB contains 17 specific questions on past and expected credit market\ndevelopments. It is applied to senior loan officers of a representative sample of euro-area banks and is conducted\non a quarterly basis. We use the survey results for Germany for our analysis. More details about the survey can\nbe found here: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/money/surveys/lend/html/index.en.html.\nTable 4: High and low GDP growth\nThe dependent variable is the real growth rate of loans to SMEs (LG_SMEi;t\n).

Potential mechanisms are bank size, loan maturity structure,\nfunding structure and liquidity. First, one could argue that SME lending by smaller banks is\nless cyclical because the latter are more closely tied to the local economy, which might be less\nvolatile over time than the country-wide economy. However, our main result (i.e., savings\nbanks are on average significantly less cyclical than cooperative banks) in combination with\nthe fact that the average savings bank is almost twice as big as the average cooperative bank\nspeaks against this reasoning. We nevertheless carry out a formal test of a potential size\neffect. Note that in the previous analysis we normalized all bank variables by total assets but\nthis procedure does not allow us to directly detect a size effect. To do so, we create size\nterciles using average total assets of the savings banks (AVGSIZEi\n). We interact these size\nterciles with the SAVi\n* GDPt\nvariable. The resulting triple interaction term informs us\nwhether the lower cyclicality of savings banks is driven by savings banks in a particular size\ntercile. The comparison group in this regression is the average sized cooperative bank. We\nconduct the same analysis for banks' average long-term loan ratio (AVGLTLRi\n) to examine\nwhether maturity structure matters and whether banks' share of deposit funding\n) are potential channels through which lower cyclicality can be achieved. We\nalso investigate whether bank liquidity (AVGLIQTAi\n) is a potential channel. Table 5 presents\nthe results.\nIn column 1 of Table 5, the coefficient of the interaction term SAVi\n* GDPt\nis\nsignificantly negative, confirming our baseline result for the savings banks from Tercile 1.\nThe coefficient of the triple interaction term with Tercile 2 is positive, but not statistically\nsignificant, but the one for Tercile 3 is significantly positive. This finding indicates that the\naverage effect is also present at mid-sized savings banks, and to a smaller extent at larger\nsavings banks.\nIn column 2 of Table 5 we study whether loan maturity might be a channel through which\nsavings banks achieve lower cyclicality. We differentiate by savings banks' average long-\nterm loan ratio (AVGLTLRi\n) and find that the lower cyclicality of savings banks cannot be\nexplained with the maturity structure of bank lending. The coefficients of the triple interaction\nterms (with Tercile 2 and 3) are not statistically significant, but their difference is (p-value of\n0.004). This result indicates that the lower cyclicality is not due to a higher fraction of long-\nterm lending by savings banks compared to cooperative banks. Instead, there are differences\nin the loan maturity structure within the savings banks sector.\nIn column 3 of Table 5 we investigate whether the bank funding structure, in particular\nbanks' reliance on deposit funding - compared to wholesale funding - is a channel to achieve\nlower cyclicality in lending. We differentiate by savings banks' share of deposit funding\nrelative to overall funding. Similar to the test for bank size effects (column 1) we find that the\ncoefficient of the triple interaction term is positive and not statistically significant for Tercile\n2, but it is significantly positive for Tercile 3 (banks with the highest share of deposit\nfunding). The difference between both triple interaction terms is weakly statistically\nsignificant (p-value of 0.087). The cyclicality of the latter savings banks is similar to that of\nTable 5: Results by bank size, loan maturity, funding structure, and liquidity\nThe dependent variable is the real growth rate of loans to SMEs (LG_SMEi;t\n). All models are estimated using the one-step\nSystem GMM estimator introduced by Blundell and Bond (1998), where bank-specific fixed effects are purged by the forward\northogonal deviations transformation of GMM\u00adtype instruments. These instruments are created for our main regressors LGi;t-\n, GDPt\nand their interaction terms. We study the impact of four bank characteristics (size: AVGSIZEi\n, long-term lending:\n, deposit funding: AVGRELDEPi\n, and liquid assets: AVGLIQTAi\n). We create dummy variables for banks in the\nlower, mid and upper tercile (Tercile1, Tercile2 and Tercile3), which we interact with GDPt\nand SAVi\n. In order to bring the\nnumber of instruments in line with our finite sample size, the number of lags used is limited accordingly. Furthermore, we\ncreate a collapsed set of GMM\u00adtype instruments for the control variables RIIi;t-1\n, ETAi;t-1\n, LIQTAi,t-1\n, LTLRi,t-1\n, IBLRi,t-1\nand\n.

This finding is plausible because, on average, cooperative\nbanks exhibit a higher deposit funding ratio than savings banks (see Table 1).\nIn column 4 of Table 5 we investigate whether bank liquidity affects the cyclicality of\nSME lending. Higher liquidity might make it possible for savings banks to better follow their\npublic mandate. We measure bank liquidity with the liquidity ratio (AVGLIQTA), as in Puri\net al. (2011, p. 569). We find a very strong and significant coefficient for savings banks in\nTercile 3 (-0.449; highest liquidity ratio), while the baseline effect (-0.043) and the interaction\nterm with Tercile 2 (-0.201) display the expected negative sign but are not statistically\nsignificant. This result provides an important additional insight: Our baseline result becomes\nmuch stronger for savings banks that have sufficient liquidity to be able to lower the\ncyclicality of their credit supply to SMEs.\nTable 5 indicates that our main result is most pronounced for savings banks with the\nhighest deposit funding and savings banks with the highest liquidity, respectively. This\nfinding suggests that the degree of deposit funding and the liquidity situation might be the key\nmechanisms behind the lower cyclicality of savings banks' SME lending. We therefore carry\nout one additional test. We check whether differences in the sensitivity of deposits and\nliquidity to GDP growth between savings banks and cooperative banks can serve as\nmechanisms that enable savings banks to provide SME lending in a less cyclical way than\ncooperative banks. In these tests we re-estimate the baseline model from Table 2 with\npercentage changes in deposits and percentage changes in liquidity as dependent variables,\nrespectively. The right-hand side of the models is the same as in Table 2. Table 6 presents the\nresults.\nWe obtain two clear results. Column 2 of Table 6 shows that savings banks' deposits are\nless cyclical than those of cooperative banks. The coefficient of the interaction term SAVi\n*\nis -1.483 and highly significant. Similarly, column 1 of Table 6 indicates that the\nliquidity of savings banks is less cyclical than that of cooperative banks. The coefficient of the\ninteraction term SAVi\n* GDPt\nis -0.195 and highly significant. Both results are consistent\nwith the findings shown in columns 3 and 4 of Table 5 and suggest that deposit funding and\nthe liquidity of assets are mechanisms behind the lower cyclicality of savings banks' SME\nlending. They are able to achieve a lower cyclicality in SME lending than cooperative banks\nbecause they take advantage of less cyclical deposit funding and liquidity, respectively.\n6 Additional checks and alternative explanations\nIn this section, we present several additional tests to rule out alternative explanations. We first\ninvestigate the role of competition for the cyclicality of SME lending. We then rule out that\nour results are driven by local politicians exerting influence on the lending behavior of\nsavings banks. Finally, we analyze whether differences in the risk-taking behavior of\ncooperative and savings banks can explain our findings.\n6.1 Credit supply and bank competition\nWe first provide a more direct examination of the question as to whether the lower cyclicality\nof savings banks is a credit supply-side effect or a credit demand-side effect. A credit\nTable 6: Mechanisms behind the lower cyclicality of savings banks\nThe dependent variable in column (1) is the percentage change in banks' liquid assets (Liqi,t\n) and the dependent variable in\ncolumn (2) is percentage change in banks' deposits (Depi,t\n) All models are estimated using a least-squares methodology\nwith bank-level and interacted year*region fixed effects.

If savings banks lend to local borrowers that exhibit a less cyclical\ndemand for credit than those of cooperative banks, then our findings might not be driven by\nthe public mandate of savings banks but rather a selection effect in borrower clienteles.\nHowever, the main hypothesis of this study is that the credit supply of savings banks to SMEs\nis less cyclical because of their goal to provide sustainable credit to the local economy and\ntheir deviation from strict profit maximization (as expressed by the \"public mandate\" in their\nby-laws).\nThe previous results already indicate that the difference in lending cyclicality between\nsavings and cooperative banks is a supply-side effect. First, when we include region*year\nfixed effects to control for time-varying regional demand for credit this does not affect our\nfindings. Second, when we use the credit demand-related indicator for Germany from the\nEuropean Central Bank's Bank Lending Survey instead of GDP growth (column 4 of Table 3)\nwe obtain the same result as in our baseline analysis. Third, savings banks and credit\ncooperatives in Germany have been competing in the same regions for the same borrowers for\na very long period of time. Both bank types are subject to the mandatory regional principle\n(i.e., these banks are not allowed to lend to borrowers situated out of their home market). In\naddition, the \"Borrowers statistics\" on the German banking system (Deutsche Bundesbank,\n2009) suggest that the industry composition of these banks' lending portfolios is very similar.\nWe nevertheless provide this additional test that helps rule out that differences in credit\ndemand drive our findings. In this test, we take advantage of the cross-sectional and inter-\ntemporal variation in bank competition to identify whether the lower cyclicality of savings\nbanks is credit supply-side or credit demand-side driven. We split our sample in observations\nwith high and low bank competition. It is likely that the observed credit volume is more\nclosely related to the credit supply function rather than the credit demand function when the\nbargaining power of local banks vis-\u00e0-vis their borrowers is high. Bank bargaining power is\nhigh when local bank competition is low because borrowers have fewer alternatives to obtain\ncredit (e.g., Petersen and Rajan, 1995). If the lower cyclicality of savings banks is a credit\nsupply-side effect, then we should observe that this effect is stronger (i.e., savings banks are\neven less cyclical) when bank competition is low. To test this prediction, we augment our\nbaseline model (column 4 of Table 2) by adding the triple interaction term SAVi\n* logHHIc,t\n*\n(or: SAVi\n* COMP3c,t\n* GDPt\n; SAVi\n* COMP5c,t\n* GDPt\n), in which we use the\nHerfindahl-Hirschmann Index (HHI) or concentration ratios C3 and C5, respectively, as\nmeasures of regional bank competition.10 Recall that higher values of the HHI and the\nconcentration ratios indicate lower bank competition. Based on the above reasoning we\nexpect to find a significantly negative coefficient of this triple interaction term if the lower\ncyclicality of savings banks is a deliberately chosen supply side effect and not due to\ndifferences in credit demand. Table 7 reports the results.\nIn column 1 of Table 7 we find a negative and highly significant coefficient of the triple\ninteraction term SAVi\n* logHHIc,t\n* GDPt\n(-0.325). We obtain similar results for the triple\ninteraction terms with the concentration ratios C3 and C5 in columns 2 and 3 of Table 7.\nThese results indicate that savings banks are even less cyclical in their SME lending than\ncooperative banks when bank competition is low. This finding together with the evidence\npresented above suggests that our main result is related to the credit supply function of\nsavings banks, which is ultimately defined by the public mandate in their by-laws, and not\ndriven by differences in credit demand affecting savings and cooperative banks differently.\n6.2 Political influence\nWe next investigate the role of political influence on the cyclicality of savings banks in more\ndetail. One could argue that because of their important role as board members in controlling\nand supervising savings banks' activities, local politicians use savings banks to expand\nlending in election periods to increase the likelihood of becoming re-elected, and that this is\n10 For this test, the regions correspond to the federal states in Germany.\nTable 7: Cyclicality and bank competition\nThe dependent variable is the real growth rate of loans to SMEs (LG_SMEi;t\n). Model 1 corresponds to specification (4) of\nTable 2 and we apply the one-step System GMM estimator introduced by Blundell and Bond (1998) as explained above. The\nreal GDP growth rate (GDPt\n) serves as macro variable. GMM-style instruments are created for our main regressors LGi;t-2\n,\n, and their interactions with the savings banks dummy (SAVi\n) and a measure for competition at the level of federal\nstates in Germany. This is the natural logarithm of the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (logHHIc,t\n) in Model 1, the concentration\nratio based on the top 3 banks (COMP3c,t\n) in Model 2 and the concentration ratio based on the top 5 banks (COMP5c,t\n) in\nModel 3.

Political influence on lending behavior of public banks has been widely\nCarvalho, 2014). As described earlier, most of these studies focus on large public banks that\nare owned or controlled by central governments, hence, their settings are not closely\ncomparable to ours.\nIn our setting, it is unlikely that political influence plays a role in explaining our main\nresult. If political influence affects the lending behavior of savings banks, we should expect to\nsee an expansion of the lending volume in election years, for instance, to please voters. Such\npolitically motivated expansion of bank lending should be asymmetric: it should take place in\nrecessions but not in booms.\nWe can rule out this explanation for three reasons. First, political influence does not\nexplain why savings banks increase their lending volume less than private cooperative banks\nin booms. Second, municipal elections take place every four to five years in Germany, but\nthey are not scheduled simultaneously. There is no systematic correlation between the\noccurrence of election years and the state of the economy as reflected by the GDP growth.\nHence, political influence cannot explain why savings banks are less cyclical on average.\nThird, the analysis reported in Table 4 shows that the lower cyclicality is due to a symmetric\n(and not an asymmetric) lending behavior of savings banks: they expand credit less in booms\nand they contract credit less in recessions.\nWe nevertheless provide a direct test as to whether and how the differences in the lending\ncyclicality of savings banks and cooperative banks can be explained with political influence\non savings banks. We collect information about the years in which municipal elections take\nplace during our sample period.11 We create a dummy variable ELECTIONc,t\nthat equals one if\na municipal election takes place in the county in which the respective bank is located in that\nyear. We interact this dummy variable with the savings banks dummy and GDP growth (SAVi\n* GDPt\n) and add all other necessary terms to the baseline regression model\nas additional controls. The results are reported in Table 8.\nMost importantly, in column 1 of Table 8 we find a positive and significant coefficient for\nand a significantly negative coefficient for SAVi\n* GDPt\n, confirming our baseline\nresult that savings banks are less cyclical than cooperative banks. We also obtain a\nsignificantly negative coefficient for SAVi\n* GDPt\n. Crucially, this triple\ninteraction effect does not reduce the baseline effect of SAVi\n* GDPt\nbut it rather comes on\ntop of it. In column 2 of Table 8 we exclude election years from our sample and test whether\n11 Elections on the level of the municipality take place at the same time in all municipalities in a given federal\nstate in a given year in Germany. However, these elections do not take place at the same time across different\nfederal states.\nTable 8: Cyclicality and political influence\nThe dependent variable is the real growth rate of loans to SMEs (LG_SMEi;t\n). Model (1) corresponds to specification (2) of\nTable 2 and we apply the one-step System GMM estimator introduced by Blundell and Bond (1998) as explained above. This\nmodel is estimated for our full sample. The real GDP growth rate (GDPt\n) serves as macro variable. GMM-style instruments\nare created for our main regressors LGi;t-2\n, GDPt\n, and their interactions with the savings banks dummy (SAVi\n) and a binary\nvariable ELECTIONc,t\n. This variable takes on a value of 1 if there was an election in the respective year and county in which\nthe bank is located. Model (2) corresponds to specification (4) of Table 2, where we also include region-year fixed effects.\nThis model is estimated for all observations where ELECTIONc,t\n. takes a value of zero. We report robust standard errors\nusing Windmeijer's (2005) finite sample correction in parentheses below coefficients. Significance levels *: 10% **: 5%\nFull sample ELECTIONc,t\n* GDPt\n* GDPt\nLG_SMEi, t-1\nLG_SMEi, t-2\n* GDPt\nBank controls yes yes\nRegion-year fixed effects no yes\nour baseline results persist. We find that this is the case: the coefficient of SAVi\n* GDPt\nis\nsignificantly negative and has the same order of magnitude as our baseline result in Table 2.\nOverall, these tests suggest that despite some political influence on the lending behavior\nof savings banks, the cyclicality of savings banks' SME lending is still significantly lower\nthan the one of privately owned cooperative banks.\nFinally, we examine whether the lower cyclicality of savings banks is related to differences in\ntheir risk-taking behavior. The results reported in Table 4 suggest that the lower cyclicality of\nsavings banks is symmetric, i.e., they exhibit a higher loan growth than cooperative banks in\nrecessions and lower loan growth in booms. These results may imply that there is no risk-\ntaking effect because the lending behavior is symmetric over the stages of the business cycle.\nIf we assume that ex ante borrower risk is higher in booms (because of the pooling of high\nand low risk borrowers) than in recessions (because of the separation of high and low risk\nborrowers), then the lower (higher) participation of savings banks in booms (recessions)\nensures that their lending does not come with additional risks. However, it is possible that the\nhigher loan growth of savings banks in recessions implies that these banks lend relatively\nmore to riskier borrowers. It is therefore an empirical question as to whether this higher risk-\ntaking in recessions outweighs the lower risk-taking because of lower loan growth in booms.\nWe provide a more direct examination of the potential link between cyclicality and risk-\ntaking. For this purpose, we collect yearly bank-level information on write-offs and loan loss\nprovisions and create the indicator variable HIGHRISKi\nthat equals one if the write-offs and\nloan loss provisions relative to total assets exceed a certain threshold, and zero otherwise. The\nyearly information on the bank-level allows us to explore the cross-sectional as well as the\ntime series dimension in the variation of write-offs and loan loss provisions. In Model 1\n(Model 2) we set this threshold to the median (75%-quantile) of the year-specific write-offs\nand loan loss provisions relative to total assets. This classification allows banks to switch\nbetween the high risk and low risk category. In Model 3, we set the threshold to the 75%-\nquantile of the average write-offs and loan loss provisions relative to total assets.12 Under this\nclassification we assume that banks' risk-taking behavior is time-invariant. We include bank\ncontrols as before. We then study whether the lower cyclicality is mainly present at banks that\nlend to riskier borrowers by adding a full set of interaction terms of the variables SAV,\nand GDPt\nto our baseline regression model from Table 2. If the lower\ncyclicality comes with additional risk-taking we should find a significantly negative\ncoefficient of the triple interaction term SAVi\n* GDPt\n. Table 9 reports the\nresults.\nThe evidence speaks against the risk-taking hypothesis. The coefficient of SAVi\n*\nis significantly positive in Models 1 and 2. This means that the loan\ngrowth of high risk savings banks exhibits a higher sensitivity to GDPt\nthan the one of low\nrisk savings banks. This finding implies that the former are more cyclical than the latter,\nwhich is the opposite of our prediction under the risk-taking hypothesis. In Model 3, we apply\nthe time-invariant risk classification of banks and find that the coefficient of SAVi\n*\n* GDPt\nis not statistically significant. There is no link between the cyclicality of\nsavings banks' SME lending and their risk-taking behavior. Finally, we confirm our main\nresult in all three models because we find a significantly negative coefficient of SAVi\n*\n. Overall, these findings suggest that we can rule out that the lower cyclicality of\nsavings banks' SME lending comes with additional risk-taking.\n12 We obtain similar results if we use higher quantiles instead of the 75%-quantile.\nTable 9: Cyclicality and default risk\nThe dependent variable is the real growth rate of loans to SMEs (LG_SMEi;t\n). The regressions correspond to Model (2) of\nTable 2 where we apply the one-step System GMM estimator introduced by Blundell and Bond (1998) as explained above.\nWe use the real GDP growth rate (GDPt\n) to measure cyclicality. GMM-style instruments are created for our main regressors\nLG_SMEi;t-2\n, GDPt\n, and their interactions with the savings banks dummy (SAVi\n) and a binary variable HIGHRISKi\n. The\nlatter equals one if the write-offs and loan loss provisions relative to total assets exceed a certain threshold, and zero\notherwise. In Model 1 (2), this threshold is the 50% (75%)-quantile of the year-specific write-offs and loan loss provisions\nrelative to total assets. In Model 3, this threshold is the 75%-quantile of the average write-offs and loan loss provisions\nrelative to total assets. We include bank controls and fixed effects. We report robust standard errors using Windmeijer's\n(2005) finite sample correction in parentheses below coefficients.

We examine whether the cyclicality of SME lending depends on\ngovernment involvement in local banks, controlling for location, size, loan maturity structure,\nfunding structure, liquidity, profitability, and credit demand-side factors. Comparing local\nsavings banks that follow a public mandate and local cooperative banks without such a\nmandate in Germany provides an ideal setting to test whether this type of government\ninvolvement affects the lending cyclicality because SMEs are credit-constrained and bank-\ndependent.\nOur main result is that SME lending by banks that follow a public mandate is on average\n25 percent less cyclical than that of other banks from the same location. Various robustness\ntests confirm this finding. We also provide several pieces of evidence that the effect we\nidentify is a supply-side effect and cannot be explained by differences in credit demand vis-\u00e0-\nvis different types of banks. We finally rule out that the lower cyclicality comes with\nadditional risk-taking.\nThe lower cyclicality of SME lending by small local banks that follow a public mandate\ncan be explained as follows. First, they do not pursue strict profit maximization but pursue\ngoals related to the sustainable provision of financial services to the local economy. Second,\nsavings banks with high liquidity and a more stable deposit funding structure exhibit the\nlowest cyclicality of SME lending. Third, the lower cyclicality can be achieved through time-\nvarying differences in bank lending standards. Banks with government involvement approve\nrelatively more loan applications in recessions, but they reject relatively more applications in\nbooms. We cannot test the latter with our bank level data but we view this as an important\navenue for future research.\nOur study highlights an important link between local banking structure and SME lending\nand has several policy implications. Policymakers can determine the cyclicality of the\nbanking system (or local banking markets) by influencing the mix of banks that follow strict\nprofit maximization and those that deviate from strict profit maximization to pursue\nsustainability goals. Furthermore, one possibility to promote local economic growth is to\npromote SME lending. This can be achieved through local savings banks or similar\ninstitutional arrangements, such as government-sponsored or guaranteed lending. Finally,\ncounter-cyclical banking regulations, such as capital buffers or dynamic loan loss provisions,\nare less necessary and less effective for banks that already exhibit a lower cyclicality because\nof their business objectives.\nReferences\nAllen, F. and D.
