The rise in interest\nregarding consumer sleep tracking devices for research\nimplies the need for testing such devices against accepted\nsleep monitoring technologies. This article reports results\nfrom a validation study of the Fitbit sleep tracking device\nagainst standard actigraphy. Fitbit is a leading maker of\ndevices that claim to track sleep, although recent validation\nattempts have produced mixed results (Evenson et al., 2015;\nconsumer sleep trackers have also been the subject of valida-\ntion tests. Validation studies of the Jawbone UP device, for\nexample, have produced similar mixed results (de Zambotti\nmary of the claims and validity of numerous consumer\nsleep monitors is found in Russo et al. (2015), with a focus\non the question of their possible usefulness even absent\nclinical-level data validity. Our study intends to contribute\nto this debate. As we will show, our data are somewhat in\nline with previous conclusions. We provide evidence sug-\ngesting serious reservations about using the Fitbit device if\naccurate measurements are desired, but it may prove useful\nfor qualitative purposes in certain settings.\nMethods\nThis study adhered to the guidelines outlined in the\nwho each simultaneously wore a commonly utilized\nresearch-grade actigraph (Actiwatch Spectrum Plus: Philips\nRespironics) and a popular commercial sleep tracker (Fitbit\nCharge HR) for 4weekdays/nights. Both the Actiwatch and\nFitbit were set to sample data at 30-second epochs, and the\nFitbit was set to \"normal\" mode. We used the Pittsburgh\nSleep Quality Index (PSQI; Buysse et al., 1989) to identify\nboth good (PSQI5; n=20) and poor sleepers (PSQI>5).\nParticipants kept sleep diaries, and we report both raw and\ndiary-adjusted Fitbit data on total sleep time (TST) and\nA practical validation study\nof a commercial accelerometer\nusing good and poor sleepers\nDavid L Dickinson1,2,3, Joseph Cazier1 and Thomas Cech4\n Keywords\nactigraphy, Fitbit, longitudinal studies, sleep, validation studies\n1Appalachian State University, USA\n2Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA), Germany\n3Chapman University, USA\n4National Council for Community and Education Partnerships, USA\nCorresponding author:\nDavid L Dickinson, Department of Economics and Center for Economic\nResearch & Policy Analysis, Appalachian State University, 416 Howard\nEmail: dickinsondl@appstate.edu\nReport of empirical study\n2 Health Psychology Open \nefficiency. The procedures used for diary-aided scoring of\nthe Fitbit data were similar to validated actigraphy proce-\ndures (Goldman et al., 2007). Because participants simulta-\nneously wore both devices, this assured that the diary-aided\nscoring of both Fitbit and Actiwatch data utilized the exact\nsame sleep diary record. Participants were compensated\nUS$50 for participation, and procedures were approved by\nthe Institutional Review Board in the Office of Research\nProtection at Appalachian State University (IRB approval\nOn the first day, participants visited our lab and pro-\nvided written informed consent, completed the PSQI,\nreceived device instructions, and were assigned both an\nActiwatch and a Fitbit device. Before departing, partici-\npants were instructed to return to the lab each day for\nminutes. During this time, they com-\npleted sleep diaries online and lab technicians synced Fitbit\ndevices with lab computers and downloaded participants'\nFitbit and Actiwatch data from the previous day.\nStatistical methods used\nWe compare each participant's Fitbit nightly sleep meas-\nure to the analogous actigraphy-produced measure: time-\nin-bed (TIB), TST, sleep efficiency (as automatically\ndevice-scored), and TST/TIB (which we call quasi-\nefficiency). As noted above, Actiwatch data are scored\nusing validated procedures, and we examine Fitbit meas-\nures of TST using both raw and diary-adjusted data. To our\nknowledge, existing validation studies of consumer moni-\ntoring devices do not always adjust device data with input\nfrom sleep diaries, even though this is common in many\nresearch studies. Some devices require user activation of\n\"sleep mode,\" which may serve as a diary-type measure.\nThe Fitbit Charge HR does not require such user activa-\ntion. Also, some validation studies involve concurrent\npolysomnographic (PSG) data acquisition, but it is not\nalways clear whether consumer device data are adjusted as\npart of the scoring procedure.\nFor each outcome measure, M, we estimate the follow-\ning linear model:\nFitbit Actigraphy\n( ) ( )\n= + \u00d7 +\nwhere  is a random effects error term accounting for the\nmultiple observations (n=4) per participant (i.e. error terms\nare clustered by participant). The null hypotheses that both\n=0 and =1 imply Fitbit outcomes are statistically no dif-\nferent than Actiwatch outcomes on average. Rejection of\n=0 reflects a general over/underestimation by Fitbit of the\nactigraphy-based measure. Rejection of =1 indicates\nhypo- or hyper-sensitivity of the Fitbit to changes in the\noutcome measure, compared to actigraphy. All estimations\nof model (equation (1)) were performed using the panel\ndata random effects option in Stata 13 software.\nWe also performed Bland\u00adAltman analysis on the differ-\nences in device measurements (Bland and Altman, 1986).\nEnhanced Bland\u00adAltman plots were constructed using SAS\nsoftware, and these plots include the linear prediction and\npercent confidence interval on the difference between\nthe outcome measures of the two devices (sleep time or\nsleep efficiency).\nFinally, our unique longitudinal approach (most studies\nvalidate a device based on one night with PSG measures,\nfor example) allows us to examine whether any systematic\nmeasurement differences between devices are a function of\nmultiple measurements on the same participant.\nAll reported results are based on diary-adjusted (i.e.\n\"scored\") Fitbit and Actiwatch measures, as is typically\ndone with actigraphy data. Diary-adjusted scoring of the\nFitbit data significantly reduces the variance in sleep out-\ncome measures from the Fitbit (see section \"Results\"). In\nfact, the correlation between the Actiwatch raw versus\nversus scored data. Diary adjustments are used not to cali-\nbrate all the device data to match the diary, but rather the\ndiary is used as a complement to the device data when sleep\nstart/stop times are ambiguous in the device data record.\nResults\nFigure 1 and Table 1 summarize the key correlational\nresults, while Figure 2 highlights the importance of the\ndiary-aided scoring of the Fitbit data (i.e. manual adjust-\nments of raw Fitbit data similar to typical scoring proce-\ndures used with actigraphy in sleep research studies). In\nFigure 1, the scatterplot Fitbit data measures (TST and effi-\nciency) are compared to the analogous Actiwatch measure,\nwith the linear regression estimate of equation (1) superim-\nposed. Table 1 shows the full estimation results of TST, sleep\nefficiency (shown in Figure 1), TIB, and quasi-efficiency\n(not shown in Figure 1) as well as estimates for the separate\nsubsamples of good and poor sleepers. In most instances,\nTable 1 indicates that the Fitbit generally overestimates TIB,\nTST, and efficiency relative to the Actiwatch measure (i.e.\nrejection of =0 in favor of >0). The results most closely\napproximate =0 and \n=\n1 for the subsample of good\nsleepers, for whom we estimate that the Fitbit measure of\nTST is statistically indistinguishable from the Actiwatch\nTST measure. This correlational analysis does not, how-\never, draw our attention to the differences between device\nmeasurements, which may be sizable and still produce a\nhigh correlation measure between devices.\nStandard and enhanced Bland\u00adAltman plots showing\nmeasurement differences between devices were constructed\nfor TST, sleep efficiency, and quasi-efficiency measures. In\nFigures 3 to 5, we show results from analysis on the pooled\nsample as well as the subsamples of good and poor sleeper\ndata for each of these measures. The enhanced plots (right-\nhand side panel in each figure) include a linear prediction\nDickinson et al. 3\nFigure 1. Fitbit versus actigraphy (ordinary least squares line fit shown).\nTable 1.

In many\ninstances, the difference in sleep parameter measurement is\nnot only outside the random variation one might expect, but\nalso the magnitude of the differences is substantial.Also, the\nBland\u00adAltman plots reveal that longer recorded values of\nFitbit TST or sleep efficiency are associated with an even\nlarger difference between the sleep parameters that the Fitbit\nandActiwatch are measuring. Given theActigraph Spectrum\nis a well-validated and commonly used research device for\nobtaining such sleep measures (i.e. it is our benchmark\ndevice between the two), this finding indicates that the Fitbit\nis not sufficiently accurate in the precision of its measure-\nments compared to well-accepted device standards.\nFinally, we also conducted longitudinal analysis on\nwhether the day of testing (day 1, 2, 3, or 4) revealed any\nsystematic tendencies regarding the difference between\nFitbit and Actiwatch device measurements. The longitudi-\nnal data on each participant are shown in Figures 6 and 7,\nwhich in each case are separated by good and poor sleepers.\nOne can see that the data show that the Fitbit tends to over-\nestimate sleep efficiency and marginally overestimate TST\nacross all days, but regression results in Tables 2 and 3 con-\nfirm no systematic trend across days. Thus, the Fitbit may\nyet provide useful information regarding the qualitative\nchange in a participant's sleep trends, even though the spe-\ncific values are likely biased.\nDiscussion\nGiven the prevalent use of actigraphy for monitoring par-\nticipant sleep levels outside of a sleep laboratory\nenvironment, we aimed to assess the practical usefulness\nof the Fitbit device as an alternative to actigraphy in cer-\ntain contexts. The National Sleep Foundation places sig-\nnificant emphasis on sleep level targets and guidelines,\nand they routinely identify sleep deficits by comparing\nnightly sleep guidelines to self-report measures. One use\nof low-cost sleep monitoring devices may be to help\nassess within-participant sleep trends in settings where\nclinical accuracy is not necessary. In other words, con-\nsumer sleep tracking devices may still be qualitatively\nuseful for personal goal tracking or even some applied\nresearch purposes (e.g. Did intervention X significantly\nincrease John Doe's nightly sleep?).\nOur statistical analysis finds that diary-adjusted Fitbit\ndata show fairly reasonable correlation on the key TST\nvariable for good sleepers and somewhat lower but still\nhigh correlation on TST for poor sleepers. The regression\nfit between Actiwatch and Fitbit sleep efficiency (and it is\nunclear how that is defined with Fitbit) is inferior, which\nsuggests that perhaps the use of the quasi-efficiency meas-\nure, TST/TIB, may be more reasonable. Nevertheless, the\ncorrelation between Fitbit and Actiwatch quasi-efficiency\nis substantially lower than the correlation between their\nTST measures.\nAdditional analysis with Bland\u00adAltman plots show that\nthe magnitude of the differences between device measure-\nments can be substantial. In some instances, the difference\nin nightly sleep measured by the Fitbit is more than a full\nhour different from the analogous Actiwatch measure.\nAlso, confidence intervals on the predicted difference\nbetween device measurements as a function of the Fitbit\nmeasure typically do not include the \"zero difference\" line,\nand the predicted difference in device measurements is not\nconstant across the range of values in our data set. Finally,\nFigure 2. Fitbit scored versus raw nightly TST data compared to actigraphy (ordinary least squares line fit shown).\nLeft panel of Figure 2 reproduces the left panel of Figure 1 with axis rescaled for comparability with raw Fitbit data.\nDickinson et al. 5\nwe exploit the unique longitudinal nature of our data set by\nexamining whether the difference between Fitbit and\nActiwatch measures of TST and sleep efficiency differs\nsystematically over the course of the four evenings of data\nFigure 3. Bland\u00adAltman plots--total sleep time (TST). 95percent confidence interval shown.\n6 Health Psychology Open \ncollection--such analysis is not possible with typical vali-\ndation studies examining only a single night of device test-\ning. We do not find evidence of differences in device\nmeasurement differences across consecutive evenings of\ntesting. Overall, while the Fitbit may be useful for promot-\ning a heightened awareness and concern over one's sleep,\nFigure 4.

However, the significant positive\naverage relationship between device measurements\nFigure 6. Fitbit\u00adActiwatch longitudinal TST device differences.\nDickinson et al. 9\nsuggests a limited but useful role for the Fitbit for those\ninstances where the average sign of the effect is all the\nresearcher needs (e.g. assessing the directional impact of an\nintervention, assuming sufficient sample size). The qualita-\ntive value of the Fitbit data appears to be present for both\ngood and poor sleepers.\nFigure 7.
