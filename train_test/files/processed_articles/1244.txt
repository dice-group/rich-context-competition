In people aged 20 years, the crude prevalence\nof impaired fasting glucose was 25.7% and of impaired glucose tolerance was 13.8%, with almost\n30% having either. Over 40% of individuals had diabetes or pre-diabetes. Almost one-third of\nthe elderly had diabetes, and three-quarters had diabetes or pre-diabetes.

But\nwhereas diagnosed diabetes has risen\nsignificantly over the last 10\u00ad15 years,\nparticularly in non-Hispanic blacks,\nundiagnosed diabetes as a proportion of\ntotal diabetes has remained relatively\nstable and may be decreasing, particu-\nlarly in Mexican Americans.\nNHANES is unique because its results\nrepresent people in the U.S. noninstitu-\ntionalized population, and the survey, in\ncontrast with other national surveys, in-\ncludes a laboratory component that mea-\nsures FPG. NHANES was particularly\nsion of an OGTT not previously per-\nrecommended for screening for diabetes\nand IFG because it is more reproducible\nand convenient and less costly. FPG and\n2-h OGTT glucose, however, measure\ndifferent physiological phenomena (4).\nTwo-hour glucose is more sensitive than\nFPG to detecting glucose defects in the\nelderly (7). Whereas 91% of people hav-\ning diabetes by FPG were likewise classi-\nfied by 2-h glucose, the 2-h glucose added\nanother 2.6% of diabetes prevalence.

This explains\nthe doubling of the prevalence of undiag-\nnosed diabetes based on 2-h glucose\neither) and halving of pre-diabetes (aged\nWe note that determination of undi-\nagnosed diabetes and pre-diabetes by ei-\nther FPG or 2-h glucose was based on a\nsingle plasma glucose reading from sub-\njects who self-reported that they fasted\nappropriately, whereas retesting is sug-\ngested for diagnosis in a clinical setting.\nConsequently, some of the prevalence es-\ntimates may be overstated. In addition,\nlimited the ability to detect differences.\nNevertheless, some important differences\nwere detected between groups and over\ntime.\nAs shown in previous reports (3), di-\nagnosed diabetes remains more than\ntwice as high in non-Hispanic blacks and\nMexican Americans than in non-Hispanic\nwhites, after accounting for differences in\nage and sex distributions. The racial/\nethnic disparity is reflected in prevalence\nof total diabetes (diagnosed and undiag-\nnosed) and total hyperglycemic condi-\ntions. Undiagnosed diabetes was not\ngreater in these groups.\nDiagnosed diabetes increased signifi-\nand women. The rise in prevalence of di-\nagnosed diabetes was particularly promi-\nnent in non-Hispanic blacks and was\nreflected in a rise in total diabetes and to-\ntal hyperglycemic conditions over time\n(most prominently in non-Hispanic\nblacks).\nBased on both FPG and 2-h glucoses,\nalmost 40% of total diabetes was undiag-\nnosed. The proportion that was undiag-\nnosed was significantly higher in non-\nHispanic whites than in Mexican\nAmericans. The proportion of total diabe-\ntes that was undiagnosed tended to de-\ncrease between the surveys, but this was\nstatistically significant only among Mexi-\ncan Americans.\nThus, whereas diagnosed and total di-\nabetes and total hyperglycemic condi-\ntions remain disproportionately high in\nminority groups, it may be that diabetes is\nbeing diagnosed more frequently in these\ngroups, both over time and relative to\nnon-Hispanic whites. This was also found\ncused screening may be occurring in these\ngroups (19). Decreases over the past sev-\neral decades in the proportion of diabetes\nthat is undiagnosed have occurred only\namong the most obese (20).

This was reflected in their higher\nprevalences of total pre-diabetes and total\nhyperglycemic conditions. No differences\nby sex, however, were found in the prev-\nalence of diagnosed or undiagnosed dia-\nbetes. These observations currently lack\nexplanation. It is encouraging that preva-\nlence of pre-diabetes did not appear to\nincrease between the surveys; this is sur-\nprising given the increase in diagnosed\ndiabetes and obesity (10) over time.\nThe sheer magnitude of prevalence of\nhyperglycemic conditions found in\nquences of diabetes including its myriad\nof complications and costs both to indi-\nviduals and to society. The prevalence of\ndiabetes continues to increase over time\nbut appears to be recognized more com-\nmonly. Despite some evidence that over-\nweight and obesity may be plateauing in\nprevalences remain high; and, even in ad-\nolescents, features of insulin resistance\nare found in the presence of IFG (23).\nLifestyle modification including weight\nmanagement and increased physical ac-\ntivity should be prescribed and practiced\nin those with diabetes (24) and pre-\ndiabetes (25), particularly in minority\ngroups.\n"
