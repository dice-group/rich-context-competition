However, the rate of suc-\ncessful prosthetic rehabilitation has not\nimproved over 40 years.5 Effective postam-\nputation stump management and subse-\nquent prosthetic rehabilitation strategies\nremain to be established for transtibial\nRigid dressing management is generally\nthought to be the desirable postoperative\nmanagement in terms of progress in the\nmaturation of the stump,7\u00ad9 and it appears\nto enable earlier prosthesis fitting, thereby\nreducing the rehabilitation period as com-\nBut the risk of soft tissue ischaemia makes it\ndifficult to apply rigid dressings for transti-\nbial amputees caused by PAD.14 Soft dres-\nsing management is one of the options for\npostoperative stump management,10 but this\nmanagement method needs much more time\nfor wound healing,15,16 and uniform global\nstandard protocols for stump management\nand rehabilitation have not been estab-\nlished.14 Using removable rigid dressings\nwith silicone liners has been reported to be\nreduces the period of hospitalization for\ntion introduced a standardized stump\nmanagement and prosthetic rehabilitation\nprogramme using silicone liners in a time-\nseries framework after wound closure of\nThis present study investigated the effect\nof a standardized silicone liner programme\non the prosthetic rehabilitation period in\npatients who had undergone transtibial\namputation caused by PAD by retrospect-\nively evaluating the outcomes compared\nwith those following an earlier soft dressing\nmanagement programme that was used\nprior to the introduction of the standardized\nsilicone liner programme.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis retrospective study analysed the data\nfrom consecutive patients with PAD who\nhad undergone unilateral transtibial ampu-\ntations at local community hospitals and\nwere then referred to the Department of\nPhysical Medicine and Rehabilitation,\nHyogo Rehabilitation Centre, Kobe, Japan\nfor prosthetic walking training between\npatients underwent a standardized stump\nmanagement programme using silicone\nliners (silicone liner programme group).\nThe control group consisted of consecutive\npatients with PAD who had undergone\nunilateral transtibial amputation at local\ncommunity hospitals and were then referred\nto the Department of Physical Medicine and\nRehabilitation for prosthetic rehabilitation\nwhich was before the standardized\nstump management programme using sili-\ncone liners was introduced at Hyogo\nRehabilitation Centre, Kobe, Japan.\nControl patients had received soft dressing\nmanagement and trained on provisional\nprostheses that were made for them (soft\ndressing programme group). Data from all\npatients with vascular transtibial amputa-\ntion who were admitted to the Department\nof Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation\nduring both time periods were analysed in\nthis study.\nInclusion criteria for all study partici-\npants included: (i) ability to stand on their\nnonamputated leg either unsupported or\nsupported by one hand on a desk at the\ntime of admission to the Department of\nPhysical Medicine and Rehabilitation; (ii)\nno severe dysfunction of the nonamputated\nleg or their upper extremities such as joint\ncontracture and paralysis. Patients were\nexcluded if they had any Steinberg factors\nthat might impede their prosthetic walking\nability.21 Exclusion criteria were as follows:\n(i) history of silicone liner use; (ii) severe\nmental deterioration; (iii) advanced neuro-\nlogical disorders; (iv) congestive heart fail-\nure; (v) advanced obstructive pulmonary\ndisease; (vi) advanced hip or knee flexion\ncontracture ( 30 ). Postoperative stump\nmanagement and rehabilitation before\nadmission to the Department of Physical\nMedicine and Rehabilitation was not stan-\ndardized across the local hospitals in either\nstudy group. Stump wounds had already\nhealed fully when patients were referred to\nthe Department of Physical Medicine and\nRehabilitation.\nEach patient was informed of the purpose\nof this study, and verbal and written consent\nwas obtained. Patient anonymity was pre-\nserved. This study was approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board of Hyogo\nRehabilitation Centre (no. 1523) and it was\nconducted in accordance with the protocol\nand it followed the ethical and humane\nprinciples of human research.\nStump management programme using\nsilicone liners (silicone liner programme)\nThe duration of the programme naturally\nvaried according to the unique circum-\nstances of individual amputees, but the\nstandard programme was as described as\nfollows. After wound closure was confirmed,\ncompression treatment of the stump with a\nsilicone liner was initiated and continued\nfor 2 weeks (Figure 1). The choice of\nsilicone liner that was used, either an\n\u00a8 ssur, Reykjavik,\nor a 6Y75 Skeo Skinguard (Ottobock,\nDecember 2014), was based entirely on the\ntime period in which the patients were\nadmitted to the hospital. The silicone liner\nfitting period began at 1 h/day and was\ngradually increased by 2 h/day to eventually\nreach 8 h/day. From the third week, a pro-\nvisional prosthesis was made, using cast\nsockets and silicone liners, with training in\nstanding up between parallel bars beginning\non the same day (Figure 2). Training in\nstanding up and walking between parallel\nbars for 2 weeks was followed by 2 weeks of\nwalking training using walking aids. During\nthat period, suitable silicone liner sizes were\nselected and changed according to the con-\ndition of the stump, when necessary. The\ncast socket was also remade when necessary.\nFrom the seventh week, a provisional pros-\nthesis was made using thermoplastic sockets\nwith silicone liners fitted (Figure 3). The\nprogramme was completed after another 2\nweeks of intensive walking training, which\nincluded applied action training such as\ngoing up and down slopes and stairs, and\nwalking outside near to the rehabilitation\ncentre. Ideally, the total duration of the\nprogramme was 8 weeks, but it was appro-\npriately extended according to a patient's\nability to walk with their prosthesis.\nA schematic representation of the silicone\nliner programme is shown in Figure 4.\nWhen determining the silicone liner size,\nthe circumference at a location 4 cm from\nthe stump end was measured according to\nthe manufacturer's instructions, and then a\nliner that was one-size smaller than the\nmeasured value was, in principle, chosen.\nBefore starting a pressure treatment, a liner\nof the selected size was tried on by the\npatient under the supervision of a physician\nfor 15 min to check the sense of constriction\nat the stump and the state of the skin. If no\nproblems were found during the first check,\nanother trial fitting was done for 15 min to\nconfirm the same points. If no problems\nwere found after these two trials, a pressure\ntreatment was started from the following\nday. The treatment was stopped immedi-\nately if something undesirable or abnormal\nwas found on the skin due to wearing the\nliner. If the subject complained about a\nstrong sense of constriction at the stump,\nsuccessive liners each being one size larger\nthan the preceding one were tried until one\nof the appropriate size that caused no sense\nof constriction was found. Then, a liner of\nthe suitable size was adopted so as to avoid\nconstriction.\nIn this programme, no stump treatment\nexcept the adoption of a compression\ntreatment using a silicone liner was used\nduring the rest of the day and night. After\nstarting the training with a provisional\nprosthesis, the time span for wearing a\nsilicone liner was set at 8 h/day. The silicone\nliner was fitted by the patient alone without\nhelp from others.\nStump management programme using\nsoft dressings (soft dressing programme)\nThe soft dressing programme was used for\nstump management prior to the introduc-\ntion of silicone liner use in 2006 and it did\nnot include protocols for specific stump\nmanagement and rehabilitation based on a\ntime-series framework.14,16 Therefore, pro-\ngramme content was established, such as the\ntiming of provisional prosthesis application\nand gait training, as needed according to the\ndegree of stump maturity and the physical\nFigure 1.

Specifically, stump treatment using\nelastic bandages was introduced so that the\nprogramme could be performed for the\nlargest possible number of hours per day.\nThe compression treatment using elastic\nbandages was conducted by a physician or\nclinical nurses.

The\nsoft dressing programme was completed\nafter applied action training such as going\nup and down slopes and stairs, and walking\noutside near to the rehabilitation centre.\nThe training procedure and the goal of the\nprosthetic walking were the same as for the\nsilicone liner programme, but the duration\nof each type of training was not fixed in the\nsame way as it was for the silicone liner\nprogramme.\nInvestigation of clinical information\nThe interval between amputation and\nadmission to the Department of Physical\nFigure 2.

Soft dressing management is easier\nand safer to apply for vascular transtibial\namputees, but it needs a longer time to\nachieve wound healing, resulting in delayed\nprosthetic fitting, and it might increase the\ntime taken for prosthetic rehabilitation.6,14\nVarious reports demonstrated the efficacy of\na removable rigid dressing using silicone\nliners for achieving earlier stump healing\nfor reducing the rehabilitation period,17\u00ad20\ncompared with soft dressing management. In\nthe present study, the mean duration of\nprosthetic training required for the silicone\nliner programme was 77.3 days, a significant\nreduction of 48.1 days compared with the\nsoft dressing programme. The silicone liner\nprogramme investigated in the present study\nwas applied to patients referred from other\ninstitutions for a certain period after ampu-\ntation, so there was no continuous process\nfrom amputation through rehabilitation, a\npoint which differs from other reports.17\u00ad20\nHowever, provided that the silicone liner\nprogramme is implemented promptly after\nwound closure, it appears that the required\nperiod for rehabilitation can be shortened\ncompared with conventional soft dressing\nstump management. The reliable effect of the\nsilicone liner on the facilitation of stump\nmaturation might be the factor that contrib-\nuted to a shorter rehabilitation duration in\nAnother problem associated with rigid\ndressing management is it makes accessing\nthe wound much more difficult and thus\nmakes it harder for the medical staff to\ndetect any complications resulting from the\namputation, especially those caused by\nPAD.14 Removable rigid dressings with sili-\ncone liners makes wound inspection much\neasier than rigid dressings with plaster casts,\nand solves the problem of wound complica-\ntions related to rigid dressings. In this\npresent study, none of the patients experi-\nenced stump wound complications in either\nstudy group. These present findings suggest\nthat the standardized silicone liner pro-\ngramme can be safely used in patients with\ntranstibial amputations.\nTable 1. Demographic characteristics and results for patients who underwent stump management using a\nstandardized silicone liner programme or a soft dressing programme following unilateral transtibial\namputation resulting from peripheral arterial disease.\nCharacteristic\nSilicone liner\nprogramme group,\nSoft dressing\nprogramme group,\nData presented as mean \u00c6 SD or n of patients.\n*P < 0.05 compared with the soft dressing programme group; continuous variables were compared with Student's t-test and\ncategorical variables (i.e. sex) with v2-test.\nConventional soft dressing stump man-\nagement using elastic bandages has disad-\nvantages, such as variations observed in the\nprogress of stump maturation, which\ndepends on the skill level of the medical\nstaff in charge.17,18 Furthermore, soft dres-\nsing management lacks the protocols for\nconsistent stump management and rehabili-\ntation based on a time-series frame-\nwork.14,16 A standardized silicone liner\nprogramme presents clearly defined proto-\ncols in this respect (Figure 4), which might\nbe regarded as one of the factors that\nreduced the rehabilitation period. Even if\nadequate dressing management is not avail-\nable immediately after amputation surgery\nin institutions that lack well-established\nstump management and rehabilitation pro-\ngrammes, the standardized silicone liner\nprogramme could sufficiently achieve the\nfacilitation of stump maturation as well as\neffectively reduce the time needed for\nrehabilitation, provided that this pro-\ngramme is applied properly after wound\nclosure. This standardized silicone liner\nprogramme may be feasible in a community\nhospital setting that lacks a skilled pros-\nthetic team. The numbers of elderly transti-\nbial amputees due to PAD is expected to\nincrease considerably in the future.22\nTherefore, the establishment of an\neffective stump management protocol is\nimportant for both improving patient out-\ncomes and managing the economics of\nhealthcare. Using the standardized silicone\nliner programme might contribute towards\nhelping both of these issues by reducing\nthe time taken for patient prosthetic\nrehabilitation.\nThis present study had several limita-\ntions. First, the sample size was relatively\nsmall, so verification by multicentre studies\nrecruiting larger sample sizes is required.\nSecondly, it was not clear whether the\nsilicone liner programme could replace\nrigid dressing management because there\nwere no past data available for a comparison\nstudy. Thirdly, the study evaluated the\nrehabilitation duration as a primary out-\ncome measure to show the efficiency of the\nstandardized silicone liner programme com-\npared with the soft dressing programme.\nHowever, the patients in the soft dressing\nprogramme group were admitted up to 14\nyears earlier than those in the silicone liner\nprogramme group, which brings into ques-\ntion the suitability of the soft dressing\nprogramme group as a reliable comparator\ngroup. However, the demographic and clin-\nical characteristics of the patients in both\ngroups were similar in terms of age, sex,\ninterval between amputation and admission\nto the rehabilitation centre and stump\nlength. In addition, the stump wound in\nevery patient had already healed at the time\nof starting either programme. Physical con-\nditions were also similar in terms of their\nability to stand on their nonamputated leg,\nthe presence of upper extremity function,\nand the absence of comorbidities relating to\nSteinberg factors. The goal of prosthetic\nrehabilitation was also the same in both\ngroups. Furthermore, the funding models\nfor supply of prosthesis and prosthetic\nrehabilitation have not changed (except for\nthe introduction of silicone liners) in Japan\nover the period of this study. Taking all of\nthese factors into consideration, the patients\nin the soft dressing programme group were\nconsidered to be reliable comparators for\nthe silicone liner programme group.\nIn conclusion, the findings of the present\nstudy showed that the application of a\nstandardized silicone liner programme\nreduced the duration of rehabilitation in\npatients who had undergone unilateral\ntranstibial amputation as a result of PAD.\nThis standardized silicone liner programme\ncould be applied after wound closure regard-\nless of the stump management method\nemployed immediately after amputation\nand it might also be feasible in a community\nhospital setting that lacks a skilled pros-\nthetic team.\n"
