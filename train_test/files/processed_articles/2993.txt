A result of these ad-\nvances has been the emergence of se-\nrious chronic diseases as a major\npathway toward death.\nAmong the most common chronic\ndiseases are chronic obstructive pul-\nmonary disease (COPD), congestive\nheart failure (CHF), and end-stage liver\ndisease (ESLD). Together, these 3 dis-\neases account for almost 2 million hos-\ndeaths annually.1,2 In contrast to incur-\nable metastatic cancer, in which there\nis often a marked decline in weight and\nfunction near the end of life,3 diseases\ninvolving chronic organ failure tend to\nhave a more erratic course and to pro-\nduce death at a time that is difficult to\npredict.4-6 As a result, many patients\nwith COPD, CHF, or ESLD never ex-\nperience a time during which they are\nAuthor Affiliations: Center to Improve Care of the Dy-\ning, George Washington University School of Medi-\ncine and Health Sciences (Drs Fox, Zhong, and Lynn and\nMs Landrum-McNiff) and the Veterans Health Admin-\nistration National Ethics Center, Department of Veter-\nans Affairs, Washington, DC (Dr Fox); the Department\nof Medicine and Center for Health Care Research\nand Policy, Case Western Reserve University at\nMetroHealth Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio (Dr\nDawson); and the Health Services Research and Devel-\nopment Center at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore,\nMd (Dr Wu).

Broad inclusion crite-\nria identified 923 patients eligible for hospice care, of whom 70% survived longer than\n6 months.

This ob-\nservation has important implications for\nthe treatment of patients with such dis-\neases, especially with regard to their eli-\ngibility for hospice care.\nHospiceprogramsintheUnitedStates\nprovide specialized medical and sup-\nport services for the management of ter-\nminal illness, mostly in patients' homes.\nThe Medicare hospice benefit covers\ncomprehensiveservices,includinghome\ncare, short-term inpatient care, and\nmedication costs, and is paid at a daily\nHospicecareisalsoacoveredbenefitun-\nder most private insurance plans, man-\naged care organizations, and state Med-\nicaid programs.8 Hospice care has\nreceived widespread approval9,10 and is\nincreasing in popularity; in the last 5\nyears, annual growth in the number of\npatients receiving hospice care nation-\nwide has averaged 16%.8 The few stud-\nies comparing hospice with other care\nat the end of life suggest that (1) pa-\ntients11 and families are satisfied with\nhospice care, (2) patients have fewer\nregrets than nonhospice patients, and\n(3) patients receiving hospice care are\nmore likely to die in a way that is con-\nDespite its advantages, however, hos-\npice care serves a small portion of the\ndying population for only a short pe-\nriod of time. About 20% of patients who\ndie in the United States receive hos-\npice care.7 Most patients enrolled in\nhospice are dying of cancer, although\nthe proportion of hospice admissions\nfor other diseases has increased steadily\nin recent years.8\nUnder Medicare regulations, a ben-\neficiary is eligible for hospice care cov-\nerage only if both the patient's attend-\ning physician and the medical director\nof the hospice certify that \"the indi-\nvidual's prognosis is for a life expec-\ntancy of 6 months or less if the termi-\nnal illness runs its normal course.\"14\nSurprisingly, the precise meaning of this\ndefinition has never been explicated and\nphrase \"a life expectancy of 6 months\nor less if the terminal illness runs its\nnormal course\" could be interpreted to\nmean that among patients with simi-\nlar prognosis, more than half would be\ndead within6months.Alternatively,the\nphrase could be interpreted to require\na much higher degree of prognostic ac-\nwould be dead within 6 months).\nAggregate Medicare survival data\nsuggest that actual practice tends to re-\nflect the latter, narrower interpreta-\ntion.6 Only 15% of patients receiving\nMedicare hospice benefits survive\nlonger than 6 months. The median sur-\nvival of Medicare patients enrolled in\nment regulators, too, may expect a high\nlevel of accuracy in predicting 6-month\nsurvival--not only in terms of aggre-\ngate patient data, but also at the level\nof individual patients. Fraud and abuse\nauditors acting for the Department of\nHealth and Human Services Office of\nthe Inspector General have begun in-\nvestigating hospices and requiring re-\npayment to Medicare for some pa-\ntients who survived for more than 6\nmonths.18 The Institute of Medicine's\nCommittee on Care at the End of Life\nvoiced its concern that regulators \"may\nnot understand the uncertainty inher-\nent in projecting survival,\"19 and that\nthe Medicare prognosis provision \"im-\nplies a degree of precision that does not\nexist.\"20 As the National Hospice Or-\nganization (NHO) has pointed out, \"the\nOffice of the Inspector General's in-\ntense scrutiny has had a chilling effect\non appropriate referrals of terminally\nill beneficiaries.\"21 The effect has been\nespecially pronounced in patients dy-\ning of chronic conditions whose courses\nare difficult to predict.20\nThe comparatively predictable final\ncourseofcancer--withits1-to2-month\nphase of progressive decline at the end\nof life--is well suited to the hospice\nmodel of care.3 But for individuals dy-\ning of diseases other than cancer, ac-\ncess has been limited, in part because\nthey rarely manifest a discrete phase of\ninexorable decline at the end of life.5\nNonetheless, many have suggested that\nhospice care be expanded to manage the\ncare of persons dying of chronic dis-\neases such as COPD, CHF, amyotro-\nphic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer\nInanefforttoclarifyeligibilityforhos-\npice care among patients with CHF,\nCOPD, and other serious illnesses, the\nNHO has drafted guidelines for deter-\nmining prognosis in selected noncan-\ncer diseases.23 The guidelines were cre-\natedbyanexpertpanelafteranextensive\nreview of the medical literature con-\ncerning short-term mortality in noncan-\ncer diseases. They were intended as a\nstartingpointfordeterminingpatienteli-\ngibility under the Medicare hospice ben-\nefit, with the caveat that their accuracy\nwould need to be validated by future re-\nsearch. Despite this, they have already\nbeen widely accepted and used. In fact,\nthe Health Care Financing Administra-\ntion has distributed NHO's guidelines to\nits fiscal intermediaries as a tool to as-\nsist in the claims process.27 These of-\nfices have, in turn, used the guidelines\nin developing the conditions under\nwhich Medicare coverage for hospice\ncare is approved or denied.27\nIn this study, we applied a variety of\npotential criteria for determining prog-\nnosis, including those based on NHO\nguidelines, to an existing database28 to\nevaluate their accuracy in predicting\ndeath within 6 months among seri-\nously ill patients with advanced chronic\ndisease.\nMETHODS\nStudy Population\nThis analysis used data from the Study\nto Understand Prognoses and Prefer-\nences for Outcomes and Risks of Treat-\nSUPPORT enrolled patients, 18 years\nor older, who met specific criteria for\n1 of 9 serious illnesses (nontraumatic\ncoma, acute respiratory failure, multi-\norgan system failure with sepsis or ma-\nlignancy, COPD, CHF, cirrhosis, meta-\nstatic colon cancer, or inoperable non\u00ad\nsmall cell lung cancer) and who were\nadmitted to 1 of 5 medical centers (Beth\nIsrael Hospital, Boston, Mass; Metro\nHealth Medical Center, Cleveland,\nOhio; Duke University Medical Cen-\nter, Durham, NC; St Joseph's Hospi-\ntal, Marshfield, Wis; and the Univer-\nsity of California Los Angeles Medical\nCenter). Inclusion criteria were de-\nsigned to result in a group of patients\nwith an aggregate mortality rate of 50%\nwithin 6 months. Patients were ex-\ncluded if they died or were discharged\nwithin 48 hours of study enrollment,\nwere admitted with a scheduled dis-\ncharge within 72 hours, did not speak\nEnglish, or had acquired immunodefi-\nciency syndrome, multiple trauma, or\npregnancy.\nIn this analysis we focused on pa-\ntients with COPD, CHF, or ESLD. In-\nclusion criteria for COPD were clinical\ndiagnosis of COPD, chronic bronchitis,\nchronic obstructive lung disease, or em-\nphysema with breathlessness, respira-\ntory failure, or mental status change\nas the main reason for hospital admis-\nsion, and hypercapnia and hypoxemia\nif the patient was receiving room air, or\n50mmHgaloneifthepatientwas\nreceiving supplemental oxygen) docu-\nmented at admission.

Pa-\ntients with CHF were excluded from the\nstudy if they had any of the following:\nsevere COPD, shock, primary acute\nrenal failure, decreased systemic vascu-\nlar resistance, restrictive cardiac dis-\nease, circulatory overload, CHF primar-\nily due to valvular heart disease, cardiac\nsurgery, or thoracotomy during cur-\nrent hospitalization.\nInclusion criteria for ESLD were chart\ndocumentation of cirrhosis and at least\n2ofthefollowing:aserumalbuminlevel\nof 30 g/L or less, a serum bilirubin level\ncontrolled ascites, hepatic encephalopa-\nthy, cachexia, or a massive gastrointes-\ntinal tract bleed defined as transfusion of\n2 or more units of blood in 24 hours and\neitherhematemesisorgrossbloodonen-\ndoscopicvisualizationornasogastrictube\naspiration.\nData Collection\nAll patients admitted to the 5 hospitals\nwere screened daily by trained research\nnurses and those meeting disease and\nseverity criteria were enrolled.

Interviews in-\ncluded questions about the patient's\nfunctional status 2 weeks prior to study\nentry, weight change in the last 2\nmonths, and preferences about pallia-\ntive care. Functional status was mea-\nsured by a modified version of the Katz\nIndex of Activities of Daily Living\nScale.30 The Activities of Daily Living\nScale ranged from 1 to 7 points and\nmeasured impairment in bathing, dress-\ning, eating, continence, transferring, toi-\nleting, and walking, with a higher score\nindicating worse function. Preference\nfor palliative care was assessed by the\nquestion, \"If you had to make a choice\nat this time, would you prefer a course\nof treatment that focuses on extend-\ning life as much as possible, even if it\nmeans having more pain and discom-\nfort, or would you want a course of\ntreatment that focuses on relieving pain\nand discomfort as much as possible,\neven if that means not living as long?\"\nPrognostic Criteria\nVariables tested in this analysis were\nchosen to approximate the prognostic\ncriteria listed in the NHO's Medical\nGuidelines for Determining Prognosis in\nSelected Noncancer Diseases.23 The NHO\ncriteria were operationalized using the\nSUPPORT data as summarized in\nTABLE 1. Information was available rel-\nevant to each proposed domain. In the\ninstancesthatdatafromSUPPORT were\ninsufficient, a proxy measure in the\nsame domain was substituted. Proxy\nmeasures were selected to err on the\nside of broader inclusion.\nFor each patient case, 7 variables were\nanalyzed. Of these, 5 were general clini-\ncal criteria that applied to all patients\nregardless of their disease category: re-\nadmission within 2 months, home care\nafter discharge, activities of daily liv-\ning dependency of 3 or more, weight\nmonths, albumin level of less than 25\ng/L. In addition, 2 disease-specific clini-\ncal criteria were applied to each case:\ncor pulmonale and PO2\nor less while receiving oxygen in pa-\ntients with COPD; ejection fraction of\n20% or less and arrhythmia in pa-\ntients with CHF; and cachexia and\nmg/dL) or more in patients with ESLD.\nCurrentNHOguidelinesdonotspecify\nthe number or combination of the rec-\nommendedclinicalcriteriatobeusedto\npredict6-monthmortality;rather,clini-\ncal judgment is suggested.

In addition to prefer-\nence for palliative care, the different\ncombination criteria required varying\nnumbers of the 7 possible clinical crite-\nria relevant to the disease. Broad inclu-\nsion required at least 1, intermediate\ninclusion required at least 3, and nar-\nrow inclusion required the presence of\n5 of 7 possible clinical criteria.\nIn tabulating physiologic measure-\nments (PO2\n, albumin, creatinine), we\nused the most normal value if more than\n1 were available. For the interview data\n(preference for palliative care, use of\nhome care, activities of daily living de-\npendency, weight loss), surrogate re-\nsponses were calibrated to patients'\nresponses and substituted if the pa-\ntient was not interviewed but the sur-\nrogate was. In this analysis, patient in-\nformation was missing and surrogate\nresponses were substituted in 30.1% of\ncases for these scores, while neither pa-\ntient nor surrogate data were available\nin 17.6% of cases. Patients with no in-\nterview data did not differ signifi-\ncantly from patients with interview data\nin respect to disease severity, pre-\ndicted prognosis, or actual survival.\nData Analysis\nThe relevant clinical criteria and the 3\ndifferent combinations of criteria were\napplied to patients in each disease cat-\negory. For comparison, we also exam-\nined 6-month prognostic estimates of\nSUPPORT model,29 as well as actual re-\nferrals to hospice care. These analyses\nwere applied only to the subset of pa-\ntients who survived the enrollment hos-\npitalization, as they were considered the\nmost likely candidates for hospice re-\nferral and, therefore, the group for\nwhom prognostic criteria would be rel-\nevant in clinical practice.\nDescriptive statistics were used to\ncharacterize patients for each criterion\nregarding survival days after discharge\nfromtheindexhospitalization.Thenum-\nber of survival days was determined by\nthe National Death Index, updated to\nalive on this date, his/her survival time\nwas censored. The interquartiles of sur-\nvival days for patients who met each cri-\nterion were estimated using the Kaplan-\nMeierestimator.Tofurtherelucidatethe\nclinical usefulness of various methods\nfor identifying patients with a progno-\nsis of 6 months or less, we calculated\nsensitivity, specificity, and positive and\nnegative likelihood ratios (LRs).

Disease-specific criteria were selected from factors named in\nNHO guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and\ncongestive heart failure, excluding those that matched\nSUPPORT inclusion criteria. For chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisease we used evidence of cor pulmonale and hypoxemia\n55% on supplemental oxygen. For congestive heart failure we\nused ejection fraction 20% and supraventricular or ventricular\narrhythmia. The NHO guidelines do not specify criteria for\nend-stage liver disease, but to parallel the other analyses we\nchose documented cachexia and creatinine 153 \u00b5mol/L\n2. SUPPORT did not collect data on the 6 months prior to\nenrollment. Instead, we examined patients who were readmitted\nto a SUPPORT hospital within 2 months of the first discharge.\n3. Although home care nursing assessments were not available,\nwe were able to determine whether patients were prescribed\nhome care services after discharge.\n4. SUPPORT did not collect data on how recently a decline in\nfunctional status occurred.

The most restric-\ntive combination eliminated 99% of\npatients who died within 6 months.\nThus,thecombinationcriteriaweana-\nlyzedallsucceededinexcludingmostpa-\ntients who lived longer than 6 months,\nbut in doing so they also excluded the\nvast majority of the target group they\nweresupposedtoidentify--patientswho\nwere dead in 6 months or less. And even\nthough patients meeting various crite-\nria were somewhat more likely to die\nsooner, invariably a large proportion\n(53%) lived longer than 6 months.\nDoes this imply that suggested clini-\ncal guidelines for determining progno-\nsis in noncancer diseases are seriously\nflawed?Notnecessarily.Themorelikely\nimplication of this study is that the goal\nof determining in advance--with a high\ndegree of accuracy--which individual\npatients with COPD, CHF, or ESLD will\ndie within 6 months is unrealistic.\nThis analysis further suggests that if\na high degree of predictive accuracy is\ndemanded by those who interpret the\n6-monthprognosticrequirementforhos-\npice enrollment, few patients who die of\nthesetypesofchronicdiseaseswillbeeli-\ngibleforhospicecare.Settingthethresh-\nold high (eg, stipulating that only 20%\nof patients should outlive their 6-month\nprognosis) would eliminate hospice ac-\ncess for these patients almost entirely.\nNone of the criteria tested in this study\nsucceeded in identifying a population of\npatients who met this stringent stan-\ndard--notevenbyeliminatingmorethan\n99% of seriously ill patients.\nCertainly, the prognosis for patients\nwithadvancedCOPD,CHF,orESLDis\npooroverall--worseeventhantheprog-\nnosisofmanyterminalcancerpatients.\nBut while cancer patients are often in\nrelativelygoodhealthuntilaperiodnear\ntheendwhentheyexperiencesteadyde-\ncline,patientswithadvancedlung,heart,\nor liver disease tend to live for variable\nlengths of time in a continuous state of\npoorhealthpunctuatedbyintermittent\nexacerbations.
