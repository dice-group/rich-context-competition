Thermal\nsensitivity was assessed using a temperature-controlled plate at 7\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C. Individual paw lifts and overall\nduration of paw lifts were counted and measured for each limb. Paw withdrawal thresholds were measured using\nmanual and electronic von Frey monofilaments (MVF and EVF, respectively) applied to the metacarpal or metatarsal\npads. All measurements were repeated twice to assess repeatability of the tests.\nResults In healthy cats all tests were moderately repeatable. When compared with cats with osteoarthritis the PVF\nwas significantly higher in healthy hindlimbs in repeat 1 but not in repeat 2. Cats with osteoarthritis of the forelimbs\nshowed a decrease in the frequency of paw lifts on the 7\u00b0C plate compared with cats with healthy forelimbs, and\nthe duration of paw lifts was significantly less than healthy forelimbs in the first repeat but not in the second repeat.\nOsteoarthritic limbs had significantly lower paw withdrawal thresholds with both MVF and EVF than healthy limbs.\nConclusions and relevance QSTs are moderately repeatable in untrained cats. Kinetic gait analysis did not permit\ndifferentiation between healthy limbs and those with osteoarthritis, but thermal sensitivity testing (cold) does.\nSensory threshold testing can differentiate osteoarthritic and healthy limbs, and may be useful in the diagnosis and\nmonitoring of this condition in cats in the clinical setting.\nThe Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, Hospital for Small\nAnimals, Division of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, The University\nof Edinburgh, Easter Bush Veterinary Centre, Roslin, UK\nThe Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies and Roslin\nInstitute, Division of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, The University\nof Edinburgh, Easter Bush Veterinary Centre, Roslin, UK\nCorresponding author:\nElena Addison MA, VetMB, The Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary\nStudies, Hospital for Small Animals, Division of Veterinary Clinical\nSciences, The University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush Veterinary\nCentre, Roslin, Midlothian, EH25 9RG, UK\nEmail: elena.addison@gmail.com\nOriginal Article\nleading to an increase in the excitability of neurons within\nthe central nervous system. This activity-dependent syn\naptic plasticity leads to increases in synapse efficacy and\nreductions in inhibition, causing somatosensory abnor\nmalities such as allodynia, hyperalgesia or thermal\nhypersensitivity at local and remote sites from the\naffected joint.6 Central sensitisation therefore has impor\ntant implications for the diagnosis and effective treat\nment of pain.\nSomatosensory abnormalities can be assessed using\nquantitative sensory tests (QSTs). QSTs involve the\napplication of mechanical, thermal or electrical stimuli\nto an area to assess sensory and/or pain pathways.7 Two\nstudies have evaluated these in dogs demonstrating\nincreased sensory sensitivity in those with OA,8,9 which\nis likely to reflect the presence of central sensitisation.\nIncreased sensory sensitivity with a reduction in paw\nwithdrawal threshold has also been identified in cats\nwith OA using a von Frey anaesthesiometer.10,11 In these\nstudies cats were trained for gait analysis across a pres\nsure plate system and they were partially restrained in a\nmesh cage for paw withdrawal threshold assessment.\nClinical application of QSTs has the potential to aid\ndiagnosis of OA in cats and to help evaluate the efficacy\nof treatment. Experimental studies have demonstrated\ngood repeatability of these tests in an experimental set\nting,10 but, to our knowledge, no studies have evaluated\nthe application of QSTs to untrained cats in a clinical\nsetting.\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the repeat\nability of QSTs in a clinical setting in healthy untrained\ncats and to further investigate the somatosensory abnor\nmalities that are present in cats with OA to assess clinical\nutility in aiding diagnosis of this condition. It was\nhypothesised that QSTs would be repeatable in untrained\ncats and that cats with OA would demonstrate lower\npaw withdrawal thresholds and cold hypersensitivity,\nsimilar to findings in dogs.\nMaterials and methods\nThe study design was approved by the University of\nEdinburgh Veterinary Ethical Review Committee\n(Reference 14/12). Prior to a cat's enrolment in the study,\nall assessments were explained in detail to the owner\nand written consent was obtained. All tests were readily\nescapable.\nPhenotyping\nCats were recruited from February 2013 to November\n2014. All owners completed a questionnaire (see supple\nmentary material) assessing mobility, activity levels,\ngrooming habits and temperament.Activities were scored\nfrom 0 to 4 (0 = no problem completing the activity; 1 = a\nlittle problematic; 2 = quite problematic; 3 = severely\nproblematic; 4 = impossible). The presence of lameness or\nresentment to being handled was scored as 0 if negative\nand 1 if positive. The owner was asked if the cat sought\nseclusion, which was scored as 0 if they never sought\nseclusion; 1 if rarely; 2 if occasionally; 3 if often; and 4 if all\nthe time. The owner was also asked regarding the cat\nseeking interaction with family members and was scored\nas 0 if interaction occurred all the time; 1 if it occurred\noften; 2 if it occurred occasionally; 3 if it occurred rarely;\nand 4 if it never occurred.\nAll cats underwent a full physical and orthopaedic\nexamination by both authors to assess for any orthopae\ndic or neurological disease. Painful joints were identified\nand noted for each cat if present.\nMedical records and radiographic/CT images were\nreviewed in cats with painful joints to assess for the pres\nence of OA and response to analgesia.\nCats were placed into the `healthy' group if there was\nno evidence of activity/mobility impairment from the\nquestionnaire and were deemed to be in good general\nhealth following veterinary examination. Cats were\nplaced into the `OA' group if there was clear activity/\nmobility impairment from the questionnaire, consistent\njoint pain on examination, evidence of OA in those joints\non radiographic examination or CT scan and/or positive\nimprovement in mobility with a course of meloxicam. In\nthose cats treated with meloxicam this medication was\ntherapeutic concentrations should not have been pre\nsent. No cats received opioid analgesia.\nKinetic gait analysis\nA Tekscan pressure walkway consisting of two sensing\ntiles connected together to form a single low-profile 1 m\n\u00d7 0.5 m pressure walkway containing 1.4 sensels per cm2\nwas used. Two `Tekscan EH-2 Evolution' handles were\nused to connect the walkway to a laptop computer,\nallowing kinetic data to be analysed using proprietary\nsoftware (Walkway v7.02; Tekscan). The walkway was\ncalibrated as the per manufacturer's guidelines, and a\nproprietary equilibration file (20 PSI) was used when\ngathering data. The data were collected in a quiet room\nwith two cardboard boards on either side of the long\nedge of the walkway, with exits at the front and back of\nthe walkway. The cats were encouraged to walk across\nwith positive reinforcement with food, toys or the pres\nence of their bed, basket or owner. The cats walked\nacross the walkway at their own (self-governed) speed.\nThis was repeated until five valid trials were obtained.\nTrials were excluded if the cat ran, trotted, paused,\nstopped or turned its head on the walkway. Only trials\nwith a velocity in the central 50% of the cat's comfortable\nspeed were used. The peak vertical force (PVF), vertical\nimpulse (VI) and velocity were calculated. PVF and VI\nwere expressed as a percent of body weight. Symmetry\nindices were calculated using the following formula:13\nSI = 200 ([PVF PVF ]/[PVF +PVF ])\n\u00d7 -\nwhere SI stands for symmetry index, and PVF1\nwas the\nhigher value and PVF2\nwas the lower value. A SI of 0\nindicated perfect symmetry. A second SI was also used,\nwhich has been used in a previous study with kinetic\ngait analysis in cats:14\nWith this index a SI of 1 indicated perfect symmetry.\nCut-off values used to differentiate between lame and\nnormal dogs were evaluated to assess utility in cats,\nwhich were as follows:13\nCut-off value for lameness =\nmean SI + 2 x standard deviati\nion\n( )\nThermal sensitivity\nThe custom-designed thermal platform was manufac\n15 mm aluminium platform, which could be controlled\nat 7\u00baC (cold plate) or 40\u00baC (hot plate) (Figure 1). The cool\ning and heating was achieved using Peltier elements\nwith the `back' surface of the elements being maintained\nat room temperature with computer processor coolers.\nThe platform contained 18 Peltier elements and associ\nated processor coolers, which were arranged in six rows\nof three each. Twenty-one calibrated temperature sen\nsors were mounted in the platform and the temperature\nreadings from the six sensors surrounding each group of\nthree Peltier elements were used to stabilise the tempera\nture in that area of the platform. The Peltier elements\nwere driven by six reversible switching drivers and pro\nportional control was provided by pulse width modula\ntion of the drive signals and the choice of cooling or\nheating for each channel. The whole system was con\ntrolled by a PIC microcontroller, which acquired and\n\ndisplayed the temperature measurements at each tem\nperature sensor. The surface temperature was confirmed\non the top of the platform at multiple random points\nprior to use with a digital thermometer.\nCats were placed onto the plate at each temperature\nand after 10 s of habituation the number of times and\nduration that each paw was lifted clear of the plate sur\nface was recorded over 80 s. The plate was escapable (by\nwalking off) in all directions at all times. A period of at\nleast 5 mins with rest on a surface at room temperature\noccurred between testing at each temperature.\nPaw withdrawal threshold\nPaw withdrawal threshold was assessed with von Frey\nmonofilaments. In the first test manual von Frey mono\nfilaments (MVF) were used (Touch Test Sensory\nEvaluators; North Coast Medical & Rehabilitation\nProducts) (Figure 2). The filament was applied to the\npalmar or plantar aspect of the metacarpal or metatarsal\npad, respectively, when the cat was standing with mini\nmal manual restraint. A negative response was no paw\nwithdrawal with buckling of the filament. A positive\nresponse was the cat withdrawing its paw prior to the\nfilament buckling. The threshold sensitivity (measured\nin grams) was defined as the filament that induced a\npaw withdrawal at least three times in six repeated\nmeasurements.\nIn the second test an electronic von Frey device (EVF)\nwas used (Model 2391; IITC Life Science) (Figure 3). This\nhad a rigid probe (0.8 mm diameter tip) on a hand-held\nforce transducer (800 g internal load cell) with a thresh\nold monitoring anaesthesiometer, which gave readings\nin grams. The probe was applied to the same area as\ndescribed above. The force of the probe was steadily\nincreased until paw withdrawal was elicited or the maxi\nmum value of 400 g was reached. This was repeated\nthree times and the average of the three readings was\nused in the analysis.\nRepeatability\nAll tests were repeated on a second separate occasion\n(minimum of 2 h between tests) to evaluate repeatability.\nFigure 1 Custom-designed thermal platform, which could be\ncontrolled at 7\u00baC (cold plate) or 40\u00baC (hot plate)\nFigure 2 Example of a manual von Frey monofilament\nStatistical analysis\nData analysis was performed using three types of statis\nAll data were analysed to assess if they were paramet\nric or non-parametric. Left vs right limbs were evaluated\nin the healthy group, using the Mann\u00adWhitney U-test or\nthe paired Student's t-test (for non-parametric and para\nmetric data, respectively). Repeatability was assessed in\nthe healthy group using the Wilcoxon-signed rank test or\npaired Student's t-test (for non-parametric and paramet\nric data, respectively) to evaluate for differences between\nthe first and second repeat. Bland\u00adAltman plots were\nthen performed for each test.\nThe overall score for the questionnaire was assessed\nbetween healthy cats and those with arthritis. A Mann\u00ad\nWhitney U-test was performed to evaluate the difference\nin score. Each score for each activity was then assessed\nbetween the two groups using Fisher's Exact Test.\nAs the cats in the OA group had different joints\naffected, statistical analysis was performed to evaluate\ndifferences between healthy limbs and those limbs\naffected by OA. Differences between limbs were assessed\nusing the Mann\u00adWhitney U-test or the two-sample\nStudent's t-test (for non-parametric and parametric data,\nrespectively). A Bonferroni correction was applied to\ncorrect for multiple comparisons.\nResults\nPhenotyping\nIn total, 23 cats were recruited for the study, with 16 cats\nplaced in the healthy group and seven in the OA group.\nTwo cats in the healthy group were excluded as they\nboth had a painful left elbow joint on orthopaedic exami\nnation, leaving 14 cats in total in this group.\nThe median score of the questionnaire of healthy cats\nwas 2 and that of the OA cats was 14. The questionnaire\nscore was significantly higher for the OA group (P =\n0.0030). On individual activity assessment, walking (P =\nscored significantly higher in the OA group compared\nwith the healthy group.\nFive cats in the OA group were being treated with\nmeloxicam, which was stopped 48 h prior to testing. One\ncat in this group also had inflammatory bowel disease,\nwhich was well controlled on low-dose prednisolone (1\nmg [0.27 mg/kg] orally q24h). This cat developed vomit\ning if the prednisolone was stopped; therefore, treatment\nwas continued during testing.Another cat in the OAgroup\nhad been diagnosed with alimentary small-cell lym\nphoma, which was treated with dexamethasone (0.16 mg/\nkg subcutaneously every 2 weeks). Testing was performed\nat the end of the 2 week period, prior to a repeat dexa\nmethasone injection. Neither of these two cats had any\nabdominal discomfort on examination prior to testing. All\ncats in the OA group had radiographic (n = 2) or CT (n =\n4) evidence of OAin the painful joint except one cat, which\nhad painful joints and a significant improvement in mobil\nity with treatment with meloxicam (the owner had\ndeclined imaging). Joints affected included the hip joint\n(bilateral; two cats); the stifle joint (unilateral; two cats); the\nshoulder joint (unilateral one cat; bilateral one cat) and the\nelbow joint (unilateral one cat; bilateral one cat).\nSignalment\nIn total, 11 cats were male (seven healthy; four with OA)\nand 10 were female (seven healthy; three with OA).\nTwenty cats were neutered (14 healthy; six with OA) and\none cat with OA was entire. Thirteen cats were domestic\nshort- or longhair (11 healthy; two with OA) and eight\ncats were represented by the following breeds: British\nShorthair (two healthy); Birman (one healthy); Bengal\n(one with OA); Maine Coon (three with OA) and Persian\n(two with OA). There was no significant difference in sex,\nbreed or neuter status between healthy and OA groups.\nThe median age of the healthy group was 7 years and\n1 month, and that of the OA group was 12 years. Cats in\nthe OA group were significantly older than those in the\nRepeat testing\nThe second repeat of the tests was performed on the\nsame day for all cats, except for six who were not\nFigure 3 Electronic von Frey monofilament.

A gap of at least 2 h was\nleft between repeat testing performed on the same day.\nThree healthy cats had the second repeat tests performed\n4, 6 and 26 weeks after the first session. Three OA cats\nhad the second repeat tests performed 15 weeks after the\nfirst session.

The largest vari\nability was present for the MVF and EVF.\nHealthy vs OA limbs\nSee Table 1 for mean/median values and CIs for each\ntest. Table 3 contains the P values for each test.

All tests\nwere shown to be moderately repeatable; however, there\nwas an element of individual variability for all tests,\nwhich was particularly notable when using the von Frey\nmonofilaments.\nThe particular tests used in this study were evaluated\nbecause they have been shown to discriminate OA in\nlimbs in dogs.8 Ethical approval was obtained prior to\ncommencement of the study. With respect to the thermal\nsensitivity testing, hot and cold temperature thresholds\nwere chosen that would not cause pain or injury. Aprevi\nous study has demonstrated that the noxious heat stimu\nlus in cats is >43\u00b0C; therefore, a temperature below this\nthreshold was chosen.16 Literature regarding cold pain\nthresholds is limited. Nociceptors responsive to cold\ntemperatures in cat skin start to discharge between 15\u00baC\nand 20\u00b0C, with higher rates of discharge 5\u00b0C.17 The sec\nond threshold with a temperature of 7\u00b0C, although cold,\nis warmer than ground temperature during the winter,\nwhich many cats would be exposed to when roaming\noutdoors. Overall safety of exposure to certain tempera\ntures is not only reliant on the temperature alone, but is\nalso a function of the duration of exposure. Thermal test\ning in this study was therefore designed to be of short\nduration and easily escapable. All cats were closely mon\nitored and no adverse behaviour or discomfort was\nidentified for any cat during testing.\nKinetic gait analysis has been used in several previous\nacclimatised for at least 30 mins in the room with the\npressure plate or trained to walk across it with or without\na leash. In this study cats were completely na\u00efve to the\npressure plate with no level of training. Although our\nanalysis found the results repeatable it was a very time\nconsuming test in some cats in order to obtain five valid\ntrials. Some cats were easily motivated by the positive\nreinforcement; however, in other cats the positive rein\nforcement was much less effective and it took nearly an\nhour to get five trials. Therefore, in some cats this may be\na challenging test to perform in a clinical scenario owing\nto the variable response to positive reinforcement.\nThe symmetry index, which is regularly used in dogs,\nseems to be less useful in the cat. Two healthy cats were\nclassed as lame when this index was applied. SI2\nwas\nused for comparative purposes as it has been assessed in\nnormal cats in a previous study.14 They identified a mean\nhindlimbs. In our study the mean SIs and SDs were more\nvariable. Without leash training the cats may not be\nwalking `perfectly' across the plate. Very slight changes\nin speed or the cat looking around the room without an\nobvious head turn could lead to the increased variability\nseen, which on two occasions was enough for the healthy\ncats to be classed as `lame', using this approach.\nIn contrast to dogs, which have been shown to have\ncold hypersensitivity with stifle OA,8 we found some\nevidence of cold hyposensitivity in cats in forelimbs with\nOA. Increased sensory sensitivity is not always reported\nTable 4 Summary of the symmetry index results for the peak vertical force of osteoarthritic cats\nRange R1 Range R2 Mean \u00b1 SD R1 Mean \u00b1 SD R2 Lameness\ncut-off R1\nLameness\ncut-off R2\nR1 = repeat 1; R2 = repeat 2; SI = symmetry index; FL = forelimb; HL = hindlimb\nwith central sensitisation in humans; indeed, tactile and\nthermal hyposensitivity have been reported with knee\nOA alongside pressure hyperalgesia in the same areas.5\nThe reason for this has been suggested to be a result of\nthe descending inhibitory systems, which may become\nactivated to counteract the enhanced excitation of\nperipheral afferents to noxious stimuli. Therefore, the\nsensitivity of afferents to innocuous stimuli may also be\nThe cold hyposensitivity was only identified in the\nforelimbs in this study. The reason for this could be due\nto the methodology. If the cats wanted to move on the\ntemperature plate they often moved their forelimbs and\npivoted on their hindlimbs. This is likely to be the reason\nfor the increased frequency and duration of paw lifts\nobserved in the forelimbs in comparison with the\nhindlimbs. Therefore, with this test it would be more\nchallenging to pick up differences in thermal sensitivity\nin the hindlimbs. Alternatively, another interpretation\ncould be that cats with OA are less mobile and more\nreluctant to move around. However, this is not the case\nidentified with similar methodology in dogs with OA\nand in the kinetic gait analysis there was no significant\ndifference in the velocity of cats with OA in comparison\nto healthy cats. Although placing cats on the tempera\nture plate is a quick and easy test, its clinical utility may\nbe relatively limited given that it was only discrimina\ntory for cats with forelimb lameness.\nIncreased sensory sensitivity with a lower paw with\ndrawal threshold, as measured using von Frey monofila\nments, allowed consistent differentiation between OA\nand healthy limbs. This was a relatively quick and easy\ntest to perform using both electronic and manual tech\nniques. They also allow for quantification of pain by\nidentification of allodynia, which has important implica\ntions for analgesia treatment. Paw withdrawal thresh\nolds in cats consistent with allodynia have been reported\nIn our study, however, there was no significant differ\nence in paw withdrawal threshold between forelimbs\nand hindlimbs. Applying these thresholds to our EVF\ndataset revealed that no healthy cats had allodynia,\nwhereas 33% of OA cats in repeat 1 and 45% of OA cats\nin repeat 2 had thresholds suggestive of allodynia. In\ncomparing MVF with EVF we felt that the EVF was\nsuperior owing to its continuous data measurement, the\nfact that allodynia was incorrectly identified in some\nhealthy cats with MVF and the much shorter time it took\nto perform the EVF test.\nThis study has several limitations. The sample size is\nsmall; therefore, type II errors may have occurred. There\nwas also no imaging of the healthy cats prior to enrol\nment into the study. This was not performed as there\nwas no clinical justification to do so for the benefit of\nthese cats, which were perceived to be healthy. In\naddition, owing to the mismatch between radiographic\nsigns and macroscopic lesions,2 negative radiographic\nfindings would not have definitively ruled out the pres\nence of OA in these cats. The OA group itself was very\nheterogeneous, with different joints affected and some\ncats being either bilaterally or unilaterally affected. The\nmajority of cases of OA in cats are primary and related to\nageing; therefore, a more homogeneous group would be\nvery challenging to obtain. There were also differences\nin time between the first and second repeats as not all\ncats were available for same-day testing. Although the\nlatter two points are valid limitations, the purpose of the\nstudy was to evaluate the use of these tests in a clinical\nsetting, and this more closely approximates what can be\nachieved clinically. Finally, two cats in the OA group had\nother medical conditions \u00ad one had inflammatory bowel\ndisease and the other had alimentary small-cell lym\nphoma. Both cats had good long-term control of the con\nditions with low-dose steroids and showed no pain on\nabdominal palpation. As the conditions were not per\nceived to be causing chronic pain it is unlikely that they\nwould be causing central sensitisation in these cats in\ncomparison to the joints with OA, where obvious pain\nwas identified on clinical examination.\nConclusions\nAll QSTs were found to be moderately repeatable in\nhealthy, untrained cats. Kinetic gait analysis did not per\nmit differentiation between osteoarthritic and healthy\nlimbs, and had relatively limited clinical utility for diag\nnosis of this condition. In contrast to findings in dogs,\ncats demonstrate some evidence of cold hyposensitivity\nwith OA. Paw withdrawal threshold measured using\nvon Frey monofilaments allowed consistent differentia\ntion between osteoarthritic and healthy limbs, and may\naid diagnosis of this condition in combination with clini\ncal examination and a history of impaired mobility.\nAcknowledgements We would like to thank the owners\nand staff at the Hospital for Small Animals for their help with\nthis study.\nSupplementary material The following files are available:\nQuestionnaire used for phenotyping\nBland\u00adAltman plots for each test for evaluation of repeatability\nConflict of interest The authors declared no potential con\nflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/\nor publication of this article.\nFunding The authors received no financial support for the\nresearch, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\n1 Lascelles BD.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common cause of chronic\npain and develops with ageing in this species.1 Diagnosis\nis complicated by the fact that lameness is not a common\nfeature,1 and early cartilaginous lesions may develop\nwithout concurrent osteophytosis, which can lead to a\nmismatch between radiographic lesions, orthopaedic\nexamination findings and clinical signs.2 This is com\npounded by the lack of validated pain assessment and\nscreening tools in cats,3 which increases the difficulty in\nidentifying those affected by the chronic pain associated\nwith OA. In a clinical setting pain assessment of cats\nusually involves veterinary clinical examination, radio\ngraphy and discussion with the owner regarding the\ncat's mobility and behaviour.\nThe severity of radiographic lesions does not correlate\nwith the severity of pain experienced by humans with\nsymptomatic OA.4 Central sensitisation, which occurs in\nOA, has been suggested as the explanation for this incon\nsistency.5 In chronic painful states like OA, central sensi\ntisation is due to the sustained activity of nociceptors,\nRepeatability of quantitative sensory\ntesting in healthy cats in a clinical\nsetting with comparison to cats with\nosteoarthritis\nElena S Addison1 and Dylan N Clements2"
