Our objective was to estimate the proportion\nof young children in the US who have low levels of active play or high levels of screen time, or who\nhave both these behaviors, and to describe associations with age, gender, race/ethnicity, and weight\nstatus.\nMethods: We analyzed data collected during the National Health and Nutrition Examination\naged 4.00 to 11.99 years. Our main outcomes were reported weekly times that the child played or\nexercised hard enough to sweat or breathe hard (active play), daily hours the child watched\ntelevision/videos, used computers, or played computer games (screen time), and the combination\nof low active play and high screen time. Low active play was defined as active play 6 times or less\nper week. High screen time was defined as more than 2 hours per day. We accounted for the\ncomplex survey design in analyses and report proportions and 95% confidence intervals. We used\nWald Chi-square to test for differences between proportions. To identify factors associated with\nlow active play and high screen time, we used multivariate logistic regression.\n23.8% to 28.9%) had both these behaviors. Characteristics associated with a higher probability of\nsimultaneously having low active play and high screen time were older age, female gender, non-\nHispanic black race/ethnicity, and having a BMI-for-age 95th percentile of the CDC growth\nreference.\nConclusion: Many young children in the US are reported to have physical activity and screen time\nbehaviors that are inconsistent with recommendations for healthy pediatric development. Children\nwho are overweight, approaching adolescence, girls, and non-Hispanic blacks may benefit most\nfrom public health policies and programs aimed at these behaviors.\n\u00a9 2008 Anderson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBackground\nThe prevention of childhood obesity is a public health pri-\nority in the United States [1]. Recommendations for the\nprevention of childhood obesity call for children to be\nactive daily and to spend less time in sedentary pursuits,\nsuch as watching television and videos and playing video\nand computer games, collectively known as screen time\n[2-6]. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommend\nthat children accumulate no more than 2 hours per day of\nscreen time [3,5], and the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention recommend that children be active daily for at\nFew nationally representative analyses have been pub-\nlished describing relationships between sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics and physical activity in children\nunder age 12 [8-11], and we are unaware of published US\nestimates of levels of activity in children younger than 6\nyears old. A recent analysis of accelerometry data from the\nUS National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nrace/ethnicity in activity level among 6 to 15 year old chil-\n16 year old children's reported bouts of vigorous physical\nactivity per week also found differences in levels of physi-\ncal activity relative to child age, gender, and race/ethnicity\n[8]. Adolescent boys were more likely than girls to engage\nin vigorous activity, but at younger ages no difference by\ngender was observed; non-Hispanic white children\nreported more bouts of vigorous activity per week than\nnon-Hispanic black or Mexican American children [8].\nAmong 9\u00ad13 year old US youth surveyed by telephone in\n2002 [9], participation in organized physical activity was\nrelated to race/ethnicity, parental education, and parental\nincome with Hispanic and non-Hispanic black youth less\nlikely than non-Hispanic white youth to have participated\nin organized physical activity in the preceding 7 days, and\ngreater parental education and income being associated\nwith greater likelihood of the child having participated in\norganized physical activity [10]. Participation in organized\nphysical activity was not related to gender or age, but boys\nwere significantly more likely than girls to report having\nparticipated in free-time physical activity during the prior\nAssociations between television viewing, media use, and\nchildren's sociodemographic and weight status character-\nistics have been studied more frequently [12-17]. Many\nstudies have found that television viewing time and com-\nputer use is similar for boys and girls; however boys are\nmore likely than girls to play video games, and boys may\nbe somewhat more likely than girls to have very high\nscreen times (>4 hours per day) [15].\nSedentary behavior is not simply the inverse of physical\nactivity [18-20], and children who are highly physically\nactive may also spend a lot of time in sedentary activities.\nThus it is important to understand the prevalence and\nsociodemographic correlates of low levels of physical\nactivity and high levels of sedentary behaviour individu-\nally, as well as in combination. Very little is known about\nhow risk behaviors, such as low levels of physical activity\nor high levels of sedentary behavior, cluster together [21].\nWe are unaware of published reports representative of US\nyoung children that describe the proportion of children\nwho have the combination of low levels of activity and\nhigh levels of sedentary behaviour.\nThe high prevalence of childhood obesity underscores the\nimportance of monitoring population trends in children's\nactivity and screen time, and describing associations with\nchild age, gender, race/ethnicity, and weight status. Young\nchildren's physical, social, emotional, and cognitive\ndevelopment is enhanced by active play, particularly\nunstructured play [22]. Adequate daily activity and lim-\nited levels of sedentary behavior benefit children's cardio-\nvascular health, coordination, fitness, and psychosocial\ndevelopment [23-26] in addition to lowering risk for\nobesity.\nOur objective was to estimate the proportion of US chil-\ndren aged 4 to 11 years who are participating in low levels\nof active play, having greater than 2 hours per day of\nscreen time, or both participating in low levels of active\nplay and having more than 2 hours per day of screen time.\nWe also sought to understand the relationship of these\nbehaviors with child age, gender, race/ethnicity, and\nweight status.\nMethods\nWe analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition\nare representative of the civilian, non-institutionalized,\n2004 were combined as recommended by NHANES ana-\nlytic guidelines [27]. Survey design and operations are\ndescribed in detail, and data are publicly available at\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm. The Ohio State\nUniversity biomedical IRB has determined that because\ndata from NHANES are publicly available and partici-\npants cannot be identified, analyses of NHANES do not\nrequire IRB review.\nChildren were examined in the NHANES Mobile Exami-\nnation Center. A proxy reporter (typically a parent, most\noften the mother) responded to interview questions about\nthe subject child; for simplicity we will say 'parent'\nthroughout this report to indicate the proxy reporter.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nActive play\nA parent reported the number of times per week their\nchild played or exercised actively. Frequency and not\nduration of activity was assessed for children under age\n12. The wording of the question asked was, 'Now I'd like\nto ask you some questions about {Child's} activities.\nHow many times per week does {Child} play or exercise\nenough to make {him/her} sweat and breathe\nhard?'[28,29] We categorized a child as having a low level\nof active play if the response to this question was less than\n7 times per week. The American Academy of Pediatrics\n(AAP) [4], the American Heart Association [6], Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) [7], and the US\nDepartment of Health and Human Services and US\nDepartment of Agriculture [30] recommend that children\nbe physically active daily for at least sixty minutes.\nScreen time\nA parent reported the average hours per day their child sat\nand watched television or videos, and also the time the\nchild used a computer or played computer games. The\nspecific questions asked were, 'Over the past 30 days, on\naverage about how many hours per day did {Child} sit\nand watch TV or videos? and 'Over the past 30 days, on\naverage about how many hours per day did {Child} use a\ncomputer or play computer games?\" In each case,\nresponse options were: \"less than 1 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours,\ncoded a response of 'less than 1 hour' as 0.5 hours and a\nresponse of 5 or more hours as 5 hours. We summed aver-\nage hours of television/videos and computers/computer\ngames to estimate \"screen time.\" We defined high screen\ntime as greater than 2 hours per day.\nWeight status \u00ad BMI-for-age 95th\nChildren's weight and standing height were measured\nusing a standardized protocol as part of the physical\nexamination in the Mobile Examination Center. Four chil-\ndren, who were weighed while wearing a medical device,\nwere excluded from analyses. Body mass index (BMI) was\ncalculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of\nheight in meters. Age and gender-specific BMI percentiles\nwere calculated using the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention's BMI-for-age growth reference [31]. We\ndefined obesity as having a BMI z-score 95th percentile\nrelative to the CDC reference [5].\nRace/ethnicity\nRace/ethnicity of the child was reported by the parent and\nclassified by NHANES as Mexican American, non-His-\npanic black, non-Hispanic white, other Hispanic, or\nother. The category 'other' includes individuals who indi-\ncated a single race/ethnicity other than those above, iden-\ntified with 2 or more race/ethnicity categories\n(multiracial), or were missing information on race/eth-\nnicity. In our logistic regression analyses we combined the\ncategories 'other Hispanic' and 'other.'\nCovariates\nThe child's country of birth was reported by the parent;\nchildren were categorized as born in the US, or born out-\nside the US. We used the poverty income ratio (PIR) as a\nmeasure of socioeconomic status. PIR is a measure of\nwealth that is based on family income in relation to US\nCensus Bureau income thresholds for poverty; these\nincome thresholds take into account family size and com-\nposition. Higher PIR values denote greater wealth. To pro-\ntect confidentiality in NHANES, PIR is top-coded at 5 for\nall participants with a PIR above 5 [32].\nAnalytic approach\nChildren were grouped by age at last birthday into age cat-\nolds. To account for the complex survey design, sample\nweights were applied in all analyses. Analyses were con-\nducted with SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC);\nprevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals were\ncalculated using PROC SURVEYMEANS and PROC SUR-\nVEYFREQ. We used Wald Chi-square to test for differences\nbetween proportions and logistic regression (PROC SUR-\nVEYLOGISTIC) to test for age-related trends. An alpha\nlevel of 0.05 was required for statistical significance. To\nidentify sociodemographic and weight status factors asso-\nciated with low levels of active play and high screen time,\nwe used logistic regression with age (as a continuous var-\niable), gender, race/ethnicity, weight status, poverty\nincome ratio, and whether the child was born outside the\nUS as predictors. We hypothesized the possibility of a\nnumber of interactions between these risk factors, and\ntherefore we systematically tested for interactions between\nage and gender, gender and race/ethnicity, gender and\nweight status, and race/ethnicity and weight status in\nlogistic regression models.\nResults\nDemographic characteristics of US children aged 4 to 11\nyears are presented in Table 1. The prevalence of obesity\n(BMI z-score 95th percentile) among 4\u00ad5 year old and 6\u00ad\n8 year old children was approximately 15%, and was\nThe number of times per week that children in the sample\nwere reported to play or exercise hard enough to sweat or\nbreathe hard (active play) ranged from a minimum of 0 to\na maximum of 77. Weighted to be representative of chil-\ndren aged 4 to 11 years in the US, ten percent of children\nengaged in this level of active play two or fewer times per\nweek, and ten percent of children engaged in this level of\nactive play ten or more times per week.

For all age-gender com-\nbinations the median and 75th percentiles were 7 times\nper week, except for girls aged 9\u00ad11 years where the\nmedian was 6. The median number of hours of television/\nvideos watched per day by US children age 4 to 11 years\nwas two hours; ten percent of children watched 30 min-\nutes or less per day and ten percent of children watched 4\nor more hours per day. Half of US children age 4 to 11\nyears used computers or computer games for 30 minutes\nor less per day, ten percent of children used computers or\ncomputer games 2 hours per day or more, and the top five\npercent used computers or computer games 3 or more\nhours per day.

Interactions between age and gen-\nder, gender and race/ethnicity, gender and weight status,\nand race/ethnicity and weight status were tested and were\nnot statistically significant. In a multivariate adjusted\nmodel, the following characteristics were associated with\nincreased probability of having low levels of active play:\nolder age, female gender, Mexican American race/ethnic-\nity, and higher poverty income ratio (greater wealth).

As compared to adolescents, for younger children\nless is known about of these behaviors at the national\nlevel. In addition we provide estimates of the proportion\nof US children who both have low levels of active play and\nhigh screen time. Little is known about how frequently\nthese behaviors cluster in young children and we are una-\nware of previously published nationally representative\nestimates describing the proportion and sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics of children who have low levels of\nactivity in combination with high levels of sedentary\nbehavior.\nOur analyses suggest that a substantial proportion of\nyoung children in the US are inadequately active and\nhighly sedentary. Low levels of active play and high levels\nof screen time in young children are likely contributors to\nchildhood obesity rates in the US. When these behaviors\nare combined, as in almost 20% of 4\u00ad5 year old boys and\ngirls and over 35% of 9\u00ad11 year old girls, the positive\nenergy balance required for excess weight gain is particu-\nlarly likely to result [33]. That sedentary behavior and\nphysical activity are not strongly negatively correlated is\nperhaps surprising, and whether they are correlated\ndepends upon how both are measured, but having a high\nlevel of sedentary behavior does not presume that one has\na low level of physical activity [19,20]. Consistent with\nthis, in our analyses the correlation between active play\ngirls). In addition, other than age and gender, the sociode-\nmographic factors most strongly associated with low\nactive play were not the same as those associated with\nhigh screen time. Based on our multivariate models, Mex-\nican American children had increased likelihood of low\nactive play whereas non-Hispanic black children had\nincreased likelihood of high screen time. In contrast to\nother studies [18], we observed that higher wealth (pov-\nerty to income ratio) was associated with increased likeli-\nhood of low active play, but not associated with\nlikelihood of high screen time.\nIndependent of age, gender, race/ethnicity, poverty to\nincome ratio, and non-US country of origin, children with\na BMI z-score above the 95th percentile were more likely to\nhave the combination of low levels of active play and high\nscreen time. Although, cross-sectional analyses such as\nthese do not provide information about cause and effect,\nthey do indicate co-occurrence; regardless of causality,\nchildren with high BMIs are at higher risk for obesity as\nadults [34,35], and the combination of low levels of active\nplay and high levels of screen time may increase the like-\nlihood of obesity persistence into adulthood.\nOur findings are consistent with a growing body of\nresearch demonstrating high levels of television viewing\nand media use in children in the US and other developed\ncountries. Our study indicated that 65% of 4 to 11 year\nold children in the US spend, on average, more than 2\nhours per day in front of a television or computer screen\n(high screen time). Even for preschool children (4\u00ad5\nyears), 60% of boys and 55% of girls had high screen time.\nBy age 10, this proportion was above 70% in both gen-\nders. This is comparable to estimates from a study of 10 to\n12 year old children in Melbourne Australia, in which\n61% of boys and 57% of girls reported watching, on aver-\nage, more than 2 hours per day of television [36]. Like-\nwise, in a nationally representative survey of Canadian\nadolescents, 59% of girls and 66% of boys watched more\nthan 2 hours per day of television [14]. Analyses of the US\nThird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\ndren watched 4 or more hours of television per day [8].\nSimilarly, in the Health Behaviour in School-aged Chil-\nyouth watching more than 4 hours per day of television\nin Finland, 28% in Hungary and Scotland, and 37% in\nMendoza et al. examined preschooler's prior day media\nuse and reported that 31.4% of 2 to 5 year old children\nhad watched greater than 2 hours per day of television/\nvideos on the previous day; when computer use was\nincluded 37.3% of preschoolers had greater than 2 hours\nper day of screen time [16]. Consistent with this, in a US\nnationally representative telephone survey conducted in\nhad media use greater than 2 hours per day [17]. These\nestimates are substantially lower than our estimate for 4 to\n5 year old children of 58% having greater than 2 hours per\nday of screen time; this difference may be due in part to\nhow screen time was assessed. In the studies by Mendoza\net al. [16] and Vandewater et al. [17] parents were asked\nto report how much television, video, and computer time\ntheir child had on the previous day, whereas our estimates\nare based on questions asking parents to report the average\nhours per day their child watched or used a computer dur-\nthe questions about children's television viewing and\ncomputer/video use changed from the prior day to the\nIn our analyses of 4 to 11 year old children, age was\nrelated to screen time, with older children having greater\ndaily screen time than younger children. This is consistent\nResearch suggests that the association between age and\nscreen time may be curvilinear with increasing levels in\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nearly childhood, a peak at about age 9 to 12 years and\ndecreasing levels in adolescence [15].

Estimates from\nour multivariate model indicate that a girl was 77% as\nlikely to have high screen time as an otherwise similar\nboy. Some of this gender difference in screen time may be\ndue to computer/video game use rather than television\nviewing [36]. Consistent with other studies [41], children\nwho were born outside the US were less likely to have high\nscreen time.\nMany studies have shown an association between screen\nEvidence supports a number of different, but potentially\ncorrelated, mechanisms by which screen time may influ-\nence risk for obesity; these include exposing children to a\ngreater degree of food advertising and thus potentially\ninfluencing their intake of energy dense, nutrient poor,\nsnack foods [42-44], encouraging greater food consump-\ntion when children eat while viewing television [45,46],\nand impacting sleep quality or quantity [47,48]. Whether\nor not screen time displaces physical activity is controver-\nsial [19,49]. In our analyses, a statistically significantly\nhigher proportion of obese girls had high screen time\ncompared to non-obese girls (72% vs 61%) and this was\nparticularly true in the 6\u00ad8 year age category in which\n78% of obese girls had high screen time compared to 61%\nof non-obese girls. In boys, the difference between obese\nand non-obese boys overall (70% vs. 68%) was consider-\nably smaller and not statistically significant. Interestingly,\nas in the girls, it was the 6\u00ad8 year old age category for boys\nin which the difference in prevalence by weight status was\nlargest (75% of obese compared to 64% of non-obese 6\u00ad\n8 year old boys); however this difference in boys is not sta-\ntistically significant, and thus might be due to sampling\nerror. We speculate that the influence of obesity on a\nchild's screen time may be different by gender because of\nsocietal differences in how obesity is perceived in boys\nand girls; stigmatization of obesity is greater in girls, and\ngirls are more likely than boys to have concerns about\nappearance [50]. It is possible that obese girls are thus\nmore likely to socially withdraw and choose activities,\nsuch as screen time, that are typically more solitary. How-\never, our analyses are cross-sectional and as such provide\nno information about whether or not television viewing\ncauses obesity. In our multivariate model, obesity was\nassociated with increased likelihood of high screen time;\nhowever this was not a statistically significant association\nwhen controlling for the other variables in the model.\nEstimates of physical activity from nationally representa-\ntive samples of children under age 12 years are few; these\nestimates for US adolescents are more available because\nphysical activity is assessed in the Youth Risk Behavior\nSurveillance Survey [51], and was assessed in the National\nLongitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health [52]. Compari-\nson of estimates from our analyses of levels of active play\nto the few estimates of physical activity that are available\nfor preadolescent children in the US is difficult because of\ndifferences in question wording, respondent (parent or\nchild), and when the data were collected. In 2002, a\nnationally representative telephone survey of school-age\n(9 to 13 years) youth assessed self-reported participation\nin organized and unorganized physical activity and found\nthat 61.5% of these children had not engaged in any\norganized physical activity (outside of school) in the pre-\nvious 7 days, and 22.6% had not engaged in any unorgan-\nized physical activity [9,10]. Published analyses of\nyear old US children had engaged in 3 or more bouts of\nvigorous activity in the previous week [8]. Recently pub-\nlished analyses of physical activity as measured by acceler-\nometry in US 6 to 11 year old children indicate that 49%\nof boys and 35% of girls in this age range accumulate 60\nminutes or more of moderate or vigorous activity on at\nleast 5 out of 7 days [11]. These findings are not inconsist-\nent with our estimates of low levels of active play among\nnational comparisons of the level of physical activity\nthat US youth may be more active than youth in other\n2002 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Study\nreported engaging in at least 60 minutes of physical activ-\nity on 5 or more days per week, and this percentage was\nhigher than any other country (Ireland was next highest at\nIn adolescents, age-related declines in physical activity\namong girls and boys have been observed repeatedly [54-\n58]. Younger children have been studied less frequently,\nbut evidence suggests that age-related declines in physical\nactivity may begin before adolescence. Trost et al [59]\nstudied 1110 first- through twelfth-grade public school\nstudents in Western Massachusetts (US) and found that\nphysical activity was highest at the youngest grades and\ndecreased over the older grades. In a prospective study of\n379 Iowa (US) children observed at approximately age 5.5\nyears and again 3 years later, physical activity as assessed\nby accelerometery was higher at baseline than at follow-\nup [39]. Troiano et al [11] analyzed physical activity as\nfound that both the average accelerometery counts per\nminute and minutes per day in moderate or vigorous\nyear old boys, with a similar pattern by age for girls. In our\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nallowed for narrower age categories. We observed that 9\u00ad\n11 year old boys were more likely than 6\u00ad8 year old boys\nto have low levels of active play, and that the same was\ntrue for girls. In the European Youth Heart Study, 9 year\nold and 15 year old children from Denmark, Estonia, and\nPortugal were assessed, and the older children had lower\nlevels of physical activity than the younger children irre-\nspective of country or gender [60]. In contrast, analyses of\ncated that for boys and girls 11\u00ad13 year olds were some-\nwhat more active than 8\u00ad10 year olds [8]. We observed\nthat boys were more active than girls across the age range\nwe analyzed, and this is consistent with many previous\nand female gender were both associated with increased\nlikelihood of low active play.\nAssessment of physical activity in population-based stud-\nies of children presents substantial challenges [61]. Objec-\ntive monitoring of physical activity, as occurs with\naccelerometry, is beyond the scope of most studies and\nnot without its own methodological issues [61,62]. Begin-\nactivity by accelerometry for participants over age 6 years\n[11]. Questionnaire-based methods are more common,\nand rely on self- or proxy-reports (the latter most often by\na parent). Evidence for the validity of parent reports of\nchildren's physical activity is quite limited. A comparison\nof parent and child-reports of physical activity in seventh-\nthrough twelfth-grade youth found moderate agreement\nin the report of physical activity correlates [63]. In a recent\nstudy comparing early elementary school-aged children's\nresponses to those of their parents, moderate agreement\nwas found for reporting of commonly played games and\nactivities and transportation to school [64]. Young chil-\ndren are generally unable to accurately report the number\nof minutes spent in physical activity [65], and therefore\nparent reports or objective observations are necessary. In\nNHANES, subjects age 12 years and older are asked a\nseries of questions regarding their frequency, duration,\nintensity, and type of physical activity, whereas for\nyounger children, a parent is asked to make a much cruder\nassessment of frequency of bouts of moderate to vigorous\nactivity. In contrast, the screen time items query the\nnumber of hours of television or video viewing, or using\nthe computer. This approach makes good sense for televi-\nsion viewing, where TV is generally consumed in 30-\nminute portions [66]. However, this may not be true for\nother aspects of screen time, and little empirical data are\navailable to assess the accuracy of parental reports of chil-\ndren's computer or video use.\nSeveral limitations of our analyses are noteworthy. First,\nour estimates of the proportion of children who have low\nlevels of active play are likely to be underestimates. We\ncategorized children as having low levels of active play if\ntheir parent's response to the question, ''How many times\nper week does {Child} play or exercise enough to make\n{him/her} sweat and breathe hard'' was 6 or fewer. How-\never, some children who had 7 or more times of active\nplay per week may not play actively daily; for example, a\nchild could be play actively 7 times on 1 day and not again\nthe remainder of the week. Second, active play and screen\ntime were not measured directly; a proxy (generally a par-\nent) reported the frequency with which their child played\nor exercised hard enough to sweat or breathe hard, and\nthe hours per day their child watched television and vid-\neos or played on a computer. Research on social desirabil-\nity [67] would suggest that it is more likely that a parent\nwould over-report activity, and under-report screen time\nthan the reverse. For all these reasons, we believe that our\nestimates of the proportion of children who have low lev-\nels of active play or more than 2 hours per day of screen\ntime are conservative. Third, some aspects of screen time\nmay not have been captured; video games were not asked\nabout directly, and it is not clear whether parents would\ninclude video games when responding to the question\nabout computers and computer games. In addition, our\nanalyses are cross-sectional, and thus causal associations\ncannot be inferred between the sociodemographic and\nweight status factors we studied in relation to low active\nplay, high screen time, and the combination of low active\nplay and high screen time.\nConclusion\nMany childhood obesity prevention policies call for chil-\ndren to be physically active daily and to limit their televi-\nsion viewing and other screen time. It is worrisome that\nmany young children may not be engaging in active play\nevery day. Perhaps more worrisome is the combination of\nhigh screen time and low levels of active play. When high\nscreen time is combined with low levels of active play it\nraises questions about how young children are spending\ntheir time, and the impact this may have on their develop-\nment and ultimately the health of our society. Our analy-\nses make clear the potential for all segments of the\npopulation of 4 to 11 year old children in the US to\nbecome more active and less sedentary. Children who are\napproaching adolescence, girls, and non-Hispanic blacks\nare most likely to have low levels of active play and high\nscreen time, and may benefit most from public health pol-\nicies and programs aimed at these behaviors.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nSEA participated in the design and conception of the\nresearch, led the analysis and interpretation of data, and\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ndrafted the manuscript.
