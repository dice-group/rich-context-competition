A\nrecent report described associations between overweight\nand obesity and the prevalence of chronic conditions includ-\ning high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol levels in\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) III data (19).

In populations in which high levels of adiposity\nare common, such as the population of the United States,\nexcess body fat or adiposity is highly correlated with body\nweight (30). Thus, under these conditions, body mass index\n(BMI) is a convenient and valid measure of adiposity. BMI\nis calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms by the\nsquare of height in meters (kg/m2). A recent review supports\nthe use of BMI in clinical practice (31,32) to define over-\nThe present report provides detailed information on the\ndistribution of blood pressure and total cholesterol, and on\nthe prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia, in relation\nto levels of BMI for representative samples of white, black,\nand Mexican American adults in the United States. It pre-\nsents new information on relationships between BMI and\nHDL-C. The results, based on the Sixth Report of the Joint\nNational Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation,\nand Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) and\nNational Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) defini-\ntions of high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol, are\nrelevant to clinical practice and public health approaches to\nreducing the burden of overweight, obesity, cardiovascular\ndisease, and related conditions.\nResearch Methods and Procedures\nData Source\nThe NHANES are multipurpose health examination sur-\nveys that estimate the prevalence of chronic diseases and\nassociated risk factors for representative samples of the\ncivilian, noninstitutionalized population of the United\nStates. The third NHANES survey (NHANES III) was\nData for all 6 years of NHANES III are presented here. The\nsurvey consisted of an interview and examination in the\nhome and a detailed examination in a mobile examination\ncenter. Detailed descriptions of the design and conduct of\nNHANES have been reported (33,34). The cardiovascular\ncomponent was designed in cooperation with the National\nHeart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The protocols for mea-\nsurement of blood pressure, height and weight, and veni-\npuncture and laboratory methods for lipid determinations\nmeasured blood pressure three times with the participant\nresting quietly, sitting in a chair at home. A physician took\nthree additional blood pressure measurements in the mobile\nexamination center. In both venues, blood pressure was\nmeasured with a standard sphygmomanometer (W. A.\nBaum, Copiague, NY). One of four cuff sizes (pediatric,\nregular adult, large, or thigh) was chosen based on the\ncircumference of the participant's arm, as indicated by the\nmanufacturer's guidelines. Total cholesterol and HDL-C\nlevels were measured in blood specimens obtained during\nthe examination in a mobile examination center. All lipid\nmeasurements were based on a single blood determination.\nAdults were weighed without shoes in a hospital gown with\nan electronic-load cell scale in kilograms to two decimal\nplaces. Height was measured without shoes with a fixed\nstadiometer and recorded to the nearest millimeter.\nComplete data on age and race/ethnicity were available\nexcluding pregnant women. Approximately 98% of men\nand women had three to six blood pressure measurements\nand information on current use of antihypertensive medica-\ntion, 85% of both sexes had total cholesterol and HDL-C\ndata, and 90% of men and 87% of women had data on BMI.\nBecause of combinations of missing data, sample sizes\nBMI were excluded) to 15,645 for the high blood choles-\nterol model in Table 6 (persons with missing data on BMI,\ncholesterol, current smoking status, or education were\nexcluded).\nDefinitions\n30 kg/m2) were compared. These categories were selected\nto correspond to various national and international recom-\ntolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg, mean diastolic blood\npressure 90 mm Hg, or current use of antihypertensive\nmedication (25). This definition is consistent with the clin-\nical definition of high blood pressure in the JNC VI (40).\nThe means of three or more blood pressure readings ob-\ntained either at home or in the mobile examination center\nwere used in these analyses.\nHigh blood cholesterol was defined as total serum cho-\nmM) in women (27) to reflect the higher mean in women\nthan men. This definition is different from that used by\nNCEP's second Adult Treatment Panel (41).\nDyslipidemia was defined in some analyses as a ratio of\ntotal cholesterol to HDL-C of 4.5. The same definition\nwas used for men and women.\nBody Mass Index, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol, Brown et al.\nCurrent smokers had smoked 100 cigarettes or more in\ntheir lifetime and smoked currently; nonsmokers were not\nsmoking currently.\nStatistical Methodology\nNHANES III and SUDAAN software (Research Triangle\nInstitute, Research Triangle Park, NC), which takes into\naccount the stratified cluster sample design and oversam-\nestimates were determined by using sample weights in all\nanalyses. Crude and/or age-adjusted prevalence estimates,\nmeans, and SEs are provided by BMI category for non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican Ameri-\ncan men and nonpregnant women of 20 years of age. Age\nwas adjusted to the estimated year 2000 standard population\nby the direct method using 10-year age groups. Age-specific\n80. The sample sizes for 80 and over were small; they\nwere included in the 60 and over age groups in some\nanalyses. SEs were calculated by a technique for complex\nsurvey design and estimation procedures (42). Odds ratios\nwere calculated using logistic regression analyses per-\nformed separately for men and women. The models were\nidentical for each risk factor and included direct effects for\nthe categorical variables BMI, race/ethnicity, smoking, and\nage, and interactions between BMI and race/ethnicity and\nBMI and age; education was entered as a continuous vari-\nable (years of education). To estimate odds ratios incorpo-\nrating the interaction effects for both sexes from Table 6, the\nBMI odds ratio was multiplied by the odds ratios for age or\nrace/ethnicity and by the interaction terms. Reference cate-\ngories were BMI 25, non-Hispanic white, nonsmoker, and\naged 20 to 39 years as appropriate. Age group and race/\nethnicity were also used as stratifying variables in the fig-\nures; odds ratios were estimated separately for each group.\nResults\nDistribution of BMI\nAs reported previously (21), the distribution of BMI\nvaried with sex, race/ethnicity, and age (Table 1). Greater\nproportions of women than men had BMIs at the extremes\nof the distribution (BMI of 25 and BMI of 30). Among\nmen, a smaller proportion of Mexican American men had a\nBMI of 25. The proportions of men in the highest BMI\ncategory were similar among the three race/ethnic groups.\nCompared with white women, black and Mexican American\nwomen had smaller proportions at the lowest level of BMI\nand higher proportions at BMI levels of 27.\nThe proportion of men and women at the lowest level of\nyears through ages 60 to 79 years.

Systolic\nmm Hg) in the highest BMI category (30) compared with\nthe lowest BMI category (25). The difference in diastolic\nblood pressure between the highest BMI category and the\nlowest BMI category was 7 mm Hg for men and 6 mm\nHg for women. The expected higher mean blood pressures\nat older ages were seen within each BMI category for\nsystolic pressure, but diastolic pressures were lower at ages\nover 60 years in both sexes.\nAmong men, the prevalence of high blood pressure in-\ncreased progressively with increasing BMI, from 15% at a\nof higher prevalence of high blood pressure with increasing\nBMI was similar for white, black, and Mexican American\nmen, but the age-adjusted rates were highest among black\nmen within each level of BMI (see Figure 2). The preva-\nlence of high blood pressure increased with age among men\nat all levels of BMI. The increase in high blood pressure\nwith increasing BMI was greater in the two younger age\nyears, the prevalence of high blood pressure was seven\ntimes higher at the highest (30) BMI compared with the\nand over 80) there was a less steep increase in high blood\npressure prevalence with increasing BMI category.\nWomen showed a pattern similar to that of men with\nrespect to prevalence and relationship of high blood pres-\nsure to BMI (Table 3 and Figure 1). The prevalence of high\nblood pressure increased progressively from 15% among\nwomen with a BMI of 25 to 38% among women with a\nBMI of 30. The increased prevalence of high blood pres-\nsure with increasing BMI was present in white, black, and\nMexican American women; however, the age-adjusted\nprevalence of high blood pressure was highest among black\nwomen at every level of BMI (Figure 2). The prevalence of\nhigh blood pressure increased with age among women at all\nlevels of BMI. The relationship of high blood pressure with\nincreasing BMI was present in all age groups but it was\nsteeper in the younger age groups (Table 3 and Figure 1). At\n60 years of age, women with a BMI of 27 had two to\nfour or more times the prevalence of high blood pressure\ncompared with women with a BMI of 25. Among older\nwomen, the prevalence of high blood pressure was generally\nhigher in overweight and obese women than in leaner\nwomen. Odds ratios for high blood pressure adjusted for\nrace/ethnicity, education, and current smoking habits are\nshown for age-specific groups in Figure 3, where the greater\nodds ratios for high blood pressure at younger ages are\napparent. When BMI, age group, smoking habits and edu-\ncation were in the model, black men and black women had\nsignificantly higher prevalences of high blood pressure than\nwhite men and women, whereas prevalence rates were sig-\nnificantly lower in Mexican American than white men and\nwomen (data not shown). Education was related inversely to\nthe prevalence of high blood pressure in men and women.\nWomen, but not men, who smoked had lower rates of\nhypertension (Table 6). Interactions of the relationships of\nBMI with risk factors among age and race/ethnic groups are\ndescribed below.\nBlood Cholesterol\nMean serum cholesterol levels increased with increasing\nBMI from 193 mg/dL among men at the lowest BMI cate-\ngory to 211 mg/dL in men at the highest category of BMI\n(Table 4). Among women, total cholesterol levels increased\nat the highest BMI level. In both sexes, cholesterol means\nwere consistently lowest at BMIs of 25 but did not vary\nmuch with increasing BMI above 25.\nAmong men, the prevalence of high blood cholesterol\nranged from 13% at the lowest BMI level to 22% at the\nhighest BMI level. The age-adjusted prevalence of high\nblood cholesterol increased with increasing BMI in white,\nblack, and Mexican American men, but prevalence rates\nwere lower in black and Mexican American men except\namong obese men. (Table 5 and Figure 2). The rise in\nprevalence of high blood cholesterol associated with in-\ncreasing BMI was greatest among younger men. Men aged\nprevalence of high blood cholesterol as men of that age with\na BMI of 25. A similar but less steep trend was apparent\nat older ages. At all levels of BMI, the prevalence of high\nblood cholesterol among men increased from ages 20 to 39\nto ages 40 to 59, remained fairly stable in the group aged 60\nto 79, and then declined in the oldest age group (Table 5\nand Figure 1).\nThe prevalence of high blood cholesterol increased from\nto 30% among women with higher BMI levels; however,\nthere was no consistent rise with increasing BMI above 25\n(Table 5). Trends were similar for white, black, and Mexi-\ncan American women. Hypercholesterolemia was generally\nmore prevalent in white than in other women (Figure 2).\nThe prevalence of high blood cholesterol among women\nincreased with age, through ages 60 to 79, then decreased at\nall levels of BMI. The increase in prevalence with increas-\ning BMI was greatest in the younger age groups, and most\nBody Mass Index, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol, Brown et al.\nof the increase occurred from a BMI of 25 to a BMI of 25\nIn regression analyses controlling for race/ethnicity, ed-\nucation, and smoking, the odds ratios for high blood cho-\nlesterol were higher at BMIs of 25 compared with BMIs\nof 25 (Figure 3). Hypercholesterolemia was not related to\neducation or smoking in either sex (Table 6).\nMean levels of HDL-C were 10 mg/dL higher in\nwomen than in men and they decreased with increasing\nBMI in both sexes (Table 4). The mean HDL-C level for\nmg/dL at a BMI 30. Among women, the age-adjusted\nmean HDL-C level decreased from 59 mg/dL for women\nwith a BMI of 25 to 49 mg/dL for women with a BMI of\n30 (Table 4). Age-adjusted mean HDL-C levels were\ngenerally higher in black men and women than in white or\nMexican American men or women in all BMI groups (data\nnot shown). The decline with increasing BMI was present\namong men and women in all race/ethnic groups and age\ngroups.\nAmong men, the age-adjusted prevalence of low levels of\nHDL-C (35 mg/dL) increased with increasing levels of\nBMI from 9% to 31% (Table 5). Black men had the lowest\nprevalence of low HDL at all levels of BMI (Figure 2).\nHowever, the pattern of increasing prevalence of low HDL\nwith increasing BMI was generally similar among the three\nrace/ethnic groups and among men in all age groups, in-\ncluding those 80 and older.\nAmong women, the age-adjusted prevalence of low\nHDL-C (45 mg/dL) showed a pattern similar to that in\nBMI of 30. The prevalence of low HDL-C was lowest\namong black women; it tended to be higher in Mexican\nAmerican than white women at every level of BMI.\nTable 2.

Nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of low\nlevels of HDL-C with increasing BMI was greater in\nyounger men and women, where it was about twice as high\nin the overweight and three times as high in the obese\ngroups as in the leanest groups (Table 5 and Figure 1). In\nregression analyses, low HDL-C was related positively to\nBMI, white vs. black race, and cigarette smoking; it was\nrelated inversely to years of education in women but not in\nmen. Odds ratios for low HDL increased with increasing\ncategories of BMI when race/ethnicity, smoking habits, and\nyears of education were controlled (Figure 3 and Table 6).\nIn age group-specific analyses, odds ratios were highest in\nthe two youngest groups of men and the youngest group of\nwomen (Figure 3).\nDyslipidemia\nWhen dyslipidemia was defined as a ratio of total cho-\nlesterol to HDL-C of 4.5, the prevalence of this condition\nincreased with increasing BMI level in both sexes and all\nrace/ethnic groups. Prevalence rates were lower at ages 20\nto 39 and increased with age in women but were lower in\nthe oldest men compared with those aged 40 to 79 years.\nPrevalence rates were lower in black men and women\ncompared with other men and women (data not shown).\nHypertension and Dyslipidemia\nThe percentages of men and women with both high blood\npressure and a lipid abnormality are shown in Figure 1, and\nthe adjusted odds ratios are shown in Table 6 and Figures 2\nand 3. The patterns of the combined prevalence of the two\nrisk factors with increasing BMI and age are generally as\nexpected from the patterns present for each risk factor\nseparately; the association of BMI with both conditions\ntogether was strong in all analyses. Adjusted odds ratios\nincreased across categories of BMI. Odds ratios for both\nabnormalities were generally lower in Mexican Americans\nthan in whites or blacks, among women in smokers than\nnonsmokers, and in women with more education.\nMultivariate Odds Ratios\nRelationships between BMI and risk factors vary with\nsex, age, and race/ethnic group as shown in Tables 2\nthrough 5 and Figures 1 through 3. The results of including\ninteraction terms for BMI and age and for BMI and race/\nethnicity in multivariate models are shown in Table 6. The\neffect of BMI on high blood pressure is different for whites,\nblacks, and Mexican Americans as suggested by inspection\nof Figure 2 and confirmed by the analysis in Table 6. For\nexample, the odds ratios for high blood pressure show that\nthe chances of having high blood pressure with a BMI of 25\nTable 3.

In the multivariate models, the r2 coeffi-\ncients ranged from a high of 0.32 for high blood pressure\namong women to a low of 0.03 for high blood cholesterol\nFigure 3.

On average, the models accounted for only\n10% of the variance of each risk factor among men and only\nDiscussion\nThese data show in greater detail the previously described\npositive relationships of BMI to systolic and diastolic blood\npressures, and total cholesterol levels, as well as the nega-\ntive relationship of BMI to HDL-C levels. In general, the\nprevalence of hypertension, high blood cholesterol, low\nHDL-C, and high total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio increase\nwith increasing BMI, as does the combined prevalence of\nboth hypertension and dyslipidemia. These relationships are\nfound among men and women in all race/ethnic groups and\nin most age groups. Relative risks assessed by odds ratios\nare greater at younger ages, but prevalences of overweight,\nobesity, hypertension, and lipid abnormalities are higher at\nolder ages. Odds ratios also vary among race/ethnic groups\nas indicated by the significant interaction terms. Although\nthe impact of higher levels of BMI on prevalence of high\nblood pressure, abnormal lipids, and the two abnormalities\ntogether varies in terms of magnitude with sex, age, and\nrace/ethnicity, the importance of increasing BMI as a de-\nterminant of these conditions is clear.\nThe inverse relationship between cigarette smoking and\nweight is well documented (44), and cigarette smokers have\nlower levels of HDL-C (45). Thus, failure to control for\ncigarette smoking will result in an underestimate of the\nassociation between BMI and low HDL-C.\nCardiovascular risk factors are also known to vary in-\nversely with level of education and to cluster among those\nwith the least amount of education. However, the relation-\nship of BMI with high blood pressure and abnormal lipids\npersists when smoking habits and education as well as age\nand race/ethnicity are controlled in regression analyses. In\nother analyses based on NHANES III data, Must et al. (19)\nTable 4.

They also found higher prev-\nalence ratios for high blood cholesterol among overweight\nand obese men and women than among normal weight\npersons. These investigators used different categories of\nBMI, different criteria to define high blood pressure and\nhigh blood cholesterol, and different analytic approaches\nthan ours. Although their estimates of prevalence ratios and\nour odds ratios cannot be compared directly, results of\nthe two studies are strongly concordant in identifying BMI\nas a risk factor for high blood pressure and high blood\ncholesterol.\nAlthough cross-sectional studies do not provide informa-\ntion on the sequence of risk factor development, and cause-\nand-effect relationships cannot be inferred, these findings\nare consistent with the cross-sectional, longitudinal, and\nclinical studies that show cardiovascular risk factors are\nmore prevalent among overweight and obese people.

The\nbeneficial trend in cholesterol is probably related to dietary\nchanges (57), because only 2% of the population was\nusing cholesterol-lowering medications during this time pe-\nriod (58). Previous analyses of the NHANES data have\nshown that the mean percentage of calories from total\ndietary fat and from saturated fat decreased from 1976 to\nreported intake of total calories increased (56). Changes in\ncalorie intake may reflect increased consumption or im-\nproved changes in the dietary protocol to obtain more com-\nplete intake information (59). Increased levels of physical\ninactivity (60,61) as well as caloric intakes that are too high\nin relation to physical activity levels are probable explana-\ntions for the rising prevalence of overweight (32).\nSmoking cessation has been shown to be related to\nweight gain. The prevalence of cigarette smoking has de-\nclined dramatically over the past 30 years, and a large\nproportion of the population has quit smoking (23). Re-\nviews of the relationship between weight gain and smoking\ncessation have estimated that quitting smoking results in an\nFrom the NHANES III data, estimates of weight gain due to\nsmoking cessation were 10 to 11 pounds. But smoking\ncessation accounted for only a small part of the recent\nincrease in the prevalence of overweight; approximately\none-quarter of the increase among men and approximately\none-sixth of the increase among women could be attributed\nLimitations of this report include the fact that although\nBMI is highly correlated with body fatness (0.7 to 0.8) (64),\nit measures lean body mass as well as fat mass. It has been\nsuggested that central, particularly visceral, fat is a more\nimportant contributor to cardiovascular risk than total body\nfat. Measures of regional adiposity such as waist circum-\nference, waist-to-hip ratio, and subscapular to triceps skin-\nfold thickness correlate highly with other measures of over-\nweight such as BMI and may be even more strongly\ncorrelated with lipoprotein cholesterol fractions (64). How-\never, the BMI-risk factor relationships have been shown to\nbe independent of the measures used to characterize body\nweight or fat distribution. Some variability in the associa-\ntion of BMI and risk factors by sex, race/ethnic, and age\ngroups is to be expected, given biological variability in\nblood pressure, total cholesterol, and HDL-C, and the im-\nportance of factors such as heredity, diet, and exercise,\nwhich are known to influence these variables.\nThe adverse relationship between BMI and cardiovascu-\nlar risk factors is likely to be understated in these analyses\nbecause information on diabetes was not considered. Recent\nreports implicating overweight as a potent factor in the\netiology of type 2 diabetes include an analysis of NHANES\nIII data in which prevalence ratios for diabetes increased\nsteeply with increasing levels of BMI; they were 2 to 18\ntimes higher in obese than normal weight men and women,\ndepending on the severity of obesity (19). A study of\nmiddle-aged women found that a BMI of 23 to 25 was\nassociated with a fourfold increase in risk for diabetes\nmellitus compared with a BMI 22. These reports suggest\nthat optimal weight for height may be lower than a BMI of\nConclusion\nThe high prevalence of overweight is a major public health\nproblem in the United States. Thirty-nine million Ameri-\ncans are estimated to have a BMI of 30 and an additional\ntifies for a representative national sample of the adult pop-\nulation the distribution of BMI, the relationship between\nBMI and blood pressure and lipid levels, and the excess\nprevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia, separately\nand in combination among persons with a BMI of 25.\nThese findings indicate that levels of cardiovascular risk\nfactors are substantially lower at a BMI of 25 than at\nhigher BMI levels and suggest that levels of BMI that are\nused to define optimal weight, overweight, and obesity\nshould take into account the strong and consistent relation-\nships between BMI and cardiovascular risk factors and\nother health-related characteristics. Applying these preva-\nlence estimates to the population yields estimates that 28\nmillion Americans are obese (BMI of 30) and have high\nblood pressure, dyslipidemia, or both. Among those who are\nsion, dyslipidemia, or both conditions. Relative risks (indi-\ncated by odds ratios) and absolute risks (indicated by prev-\nalence rates) are both important in determining clinical\npractice and public health approaches to case finding, treat-\nment, and prevention of overweight, obesity, high blood\npressure, lipid abnormalities, and related conditions.\n"
