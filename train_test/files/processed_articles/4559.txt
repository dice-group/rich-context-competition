    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study utilizes an adapted version of the Social Justice Scale to capture and assess the extent to which social-justice-\nrelated values and attitudes toward labor standards relate to consumer intentions and behaviors. This social cognitive model\nassesses, based on Ajzen's theory of planned behavior, how \"perceived behavior control\" affects these behaviors either\ndirectly or indirectly through consumers' intentions. It is hypothesized that individuals who value fairness and equity in social\ninteractions are going to be more likely to engage with businesses that are known for ethical business practices and abstain\nfrom firms that are known to violate labor rights. The results confirm that consumers who are concerned with social justice\nare less likely to conduct business with enterprises that have the reputation of violating both human rights and labor rights.\nHowever, the results also reveal that consumers with low levels of \"perceived behavioral control\" justify their consumer\nbehaviors as they do not think that they can make a difference.\n",

Even though a majority of surveyed con-\nsumers said they would be willing to pay extra for products\nmade under \"good\" working conditions abroad or domesti-\ncally, rather than in sweatshops (Hiscox & Smyth, 2006), a\nstudy by Prasad, Kimeldorf, Meyer, and Robinson (2004)\nfound that most consumers preferred to pay less for the\n\"unlabeled\" (not fair trade certified) products, and that only\none in four was willing to pay more for \"labeled\" (fair trade\ncertified) products. However, the results did indicate that\nthose who were willing to pay more were willing to pay up to\n40% more for the labeled products. This coincides with\nresults from the Hiscox and Smyth (2006) study, which indi-\ncated that although volumes decreased for labeled products,\nprice increases made up for the reduced sales.\nFrank (2003) provides an excellent survey of the history of\nlabor- and middle-class efforts to mobilize shopping on behalf\nof working people from the late 19th century through the\npresent. The article outlines both class dynamics of such\nmovements and how they affect workers' ability to generate\nconsumer campaigns and what the author considers contem-\nporary middle-class campaigns that treat workers as unorga-\nnized, passive victims.

These were designed to make it easier for\nconsumers to make more informed decisions in the market.\nThese systems aimed at increasing the transparency of exist-\ning initiatives, independence of monitors, convergence of\nstandards, and dynamics among nongovernmental regula-\ntions, unions, and state enforcements. O'Rourke (2003)\nargues that with increased transparency, improved technical\ncapacities, and new mechanisms of accountability to workers\nand consumers, nongovernmental monitoring could comple-\nment existing state regulatory systems and thereby enhance\nthe consumers' ability to support workers' rights.\nMore than a decade has passed since O'Rourke's article\nwas published and concerns about labor and environmental\nstandards remain. Research continues to indicate that regula-\ntions (nongovernmental or governmental) or consumer cam-\npaigns have contributed to only minor changes. Bartley and\nChild (2009) found no support for their hypothesis that anti-\nsweatshop campaigns would decrease sales for firms exploit-\ning labor. They did, however, find that more intense\ncampaigns directed at products that are recognizable to con-\nsumers had discernible effects on sales.\nConcerns regarding ethical business practices are to a\ngreat extent shaped by cognitions and affects (Gregory-\nSmith, Smith, & Winklhofer, 2013). Some of these cogni-\ntions may be shaped by the individual consumer's perceptions\nof social justice, or the promotion of \"fair and equitable allo-\ncation of bargaining powers, resources, and obligations in\nsociety in consideration of people's differential power, needs,\nand abilities to express their wishes\" (Prilleltensky, 2001,\np. 754). It would be reasonable to expect that someone who\nvalues fairness and equity in social interactions would be\nmore likely to engage with businesses that are not known for\nunethical business practices. Stated differently, one would\nnot expect someone who is concerned with social justice to\nconduct business with enterprises that have the reputation of\nviolating human rights or what most people would consider\nethical behaviors. Nevertheless, previous research suggest\nthat consumers are often aware of the unethical behaviors but\njustify their behaviors for a number of different reasons (e.g.,\nThis article utilizes Ajzen's (1985) model of planned\nbehaviors to assess the extent to which social-justice-related\nvalues and attitudes relate to consumer intentions and even-\ntual behaviors. Specifically, we utilize The Social Justice\nScale (SJS) of planned behaviors developed by Torres-\nHarding, Siers, and Olson (2012) to capture and assess an\nindividual's social attitudes and values and other constructs\nthat might be related to social justice behaviors. Furthermore,\nwe also assesses how \"perceived behavior control\" affects\nconsumers' intended or actual behaviors either directly or\nindirectly.\nBackground, Theory, and Hypotheses\nContemporary Examples of Violations by Retailers\nTo position this article in a contemporary context, we will start\nby utilizing the largest retailer in the world as an example.\nMany have hailed the Wal-Mart story as an example of what\nthe \"American Dream\" can do for budding entrepreneurs as\nthe Walton family of Arkansas took a small business and\nturned it into an undisputed retail \"superpower.\" Critics, how-\never, have argued that the success has come at the expense of\nother retailers, suppliers, employees, and consumers.\nIn 2004, a Federal district court oversaw a class action\nlawsuit on behalf of more than 1.5 million current and former\nfemale employees of Wal-Mart retail stores nationwide (\"Pay\nEquality Overview\"). The most well-known court case that\npertains to Wal-Mart's discrimination against female employ-\nees is Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. The plaintiffs claimed\nthat women for years had been paid less than male workers\nin comparable positions. They also made the Federal court\naware of Wal-Mart's unchanging company system of passing\nover female employees when awarding promotions to man-\nagement. Cases much like this one have been brought to the\ncourt system all over America.\nWal-Mart's competitors have also been scrutinized for\ntheir business practices. In 2002, Target was one of a group\nof retailers that together paid US$20 million to settle class\naction lawsuits charging them with permitting sweatshop\nconditions in factories run by their suppliers in Saipari, part\nof the U.S. Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands in\nthe Pacific. More recently, additional discrimination and\ninequality business practices of Target have come forth. In\nto settle cases brought by the U.S. Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission involving alleged racial discrimi-\nnation in hiring in Wisconsin and a racially hostile environ-\nment in Pennsylvania. In 2004, a Target contractor paid\nUS$1.9 million to settle an overtime-violation case brought\nby the federal government on behalf of immigrant workers.\nIn 2009, another contractor settled an overtime lawsuit for\naccusing them of job discrimination and over US$10 million\nfor legal fees and costs. Eight current and former employees\nand one job applicant filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District\nCourt in Oakland, California. They claimed that Best Buy\nwas denying promotions, transfers, and desirable job assign-\nments to African American, Latino, and female employees.\nBest Buy did not deny these allegations, but instead decided\nto implement a decree.\nConsumer Behaviors and Planned Behaviors\nConsumer behaviors represent decision-making processes\nand acts of consumers when it comes to buying and using\nproducts (i.e., the exchange process). The construct rests\nSchulz and Braekkan 3\nupon the assumption that consumers and their behaviors are\nmotivated and purposive (Berkman, 1992; Bose & Sarker,\n2012). In other words, consumer behavior is a construct that\ninvolves choices and planned behaviors.\nWhen deciding which retail stores to shop in, and which\nto not, consumers appear to take their own personal prefer-\nence into consideration, and we do not know the extent of\ntheir awareness of unethical business decisions. A multitude\nof questions arise: Why do people continue to support com-\npanies with appalling business practices and are people sim-\nply unaware of these practices? or Could consumer behaviors\nbe explained by either cognitive dissonance?\nThe theory of cognitive dissonance has been considered\nessential in understanding consumer behaviors for some time\n(Bose & Sarker, 2012). The term describes a psychological\nstate in which cognitions, for example, beliefs, attitudes, and\nbehaviors, are at odds (Festinger, 1957) and is typically asso-\nciated with attitude change. This is where theories of planned\nbehaviors appear to be fruitful in understanding consumer\nbehaviors in lieu of what appears to be obvious poor business\npractices by the retailers.\nThe theory of planned behavior, first introduced by Ajzen\nin 1985, has been one of the most utilized and influential\nmodels for the prediction of human social behavior over the\nlast three decades (Ajzen, 2011). It represents a social cogni-\ntive model that yields a practical framework to consider how\nattitudes and related constructs might predict a number of\nbehaviors. The central tenet of this theory is that behavioral\nperformance is best directly predicted by one's stated inten-\ntion to act. Ajzen's theory and model have been applied to a\nrange of health-related behaviors, for example, levels of\nexercise, frequency of medical self-examinations, regulation\nof eating/nutrition, safe driving behaviors, and volunteerism,\nand in the field of environmental psychology (Hardeman\net al., 2002). The theory is also frequently used in areas such\nas advertising, public relations, and organizational behavior\nAjzen's theory appears to be particularly fruitful when it\ncomes to predicting and understanding \"ethical\" consumer\nbehaviors. Previous research has indicated that emotions and\nthe prevalence of dissonance play a significant role in con-\nsumer behaviors (see Gregory-Smith et al., 2013 as a recent\nexample). Violations by retailers, whether they materialize in\nthe form of gender or race discrimination, antiunion mea-\nsures, the utilization of child labor in the supply chain, or\nlack of worker benefits, are frequent topics in news media.\nHence, it is reasonable to expect that most consumers are\naware of potential unethical business practices among the\nmajor retailers in the marketplace.\nTaking a step back, Ajzen (1991) suggests that one's\nintentions to act are predicted by one's attitudes toward the\naction, subjective norms around the action, and one's per-\nceived behavioral control of the action. Attitudes involve\ngeneral dispositions toward a given behavior. As suggested\nby Torres-Harding and colleagues (2012), with respect to\nsocial justice, it would involve an individual's acceptance of\nthe social justice ideals and related values (e.g., such as the\nbelief that one should act for social justice, or that it is right\nor fair to promote equality of opportunity for everyone,\nregardless of background.)\nSubjective norms include support, or lack thereof, pro-\nvided in an environment for performing a given behavior.\nAjzen (1991) suggests that the inclusion of subjective norms\ndescribes a mechanism by which the social context can influ-\nence the occurrence of a behavior. Consistent with Torres-\nHarding and colleagues (2012), in social justice work,\ncontextual messages, norms, and support would facilitate\none's intentions to act for social justice.\nPerceived behavioral control is, according to Ajzen (1991),\none's perceived ability to perform an act. In a social justice\ncontext, this would encompass the extent to which a person\nfeels it is possible to \"make a difference,\" or the self-evalua-\ntion of whether one can have an impact on existing social con-\nditions. Ajzen notes that perceived behavioral control could\ndirectly predict intentions to act and, in some cases, also\ndirectly predict behavioral performance itself if the action\nitself was particularly difficult or challenging. Torres-Harding\nand colleagues (2012) suggest that many of the social justice\u00ad\npromoting actions could be viewed as particularly difficult or\nchallenging because it involves changing the status quo\nIt is expected that an individual's acceptance of social\njustice ideals and related values affect their consumer\nbehaviors. Specifically, it would be natural to assume that\nconsumers who value social justice will not engage in\neconomic exchanges with retailers who infringe on work-\ners' rights to unionize, are known to exploit workers, and\nwho utilize unethical practices throughout their supply\nchains (e.g., use of child labor or forced labor in facto-\nries). Hence, utilizing Ajzen's model, we propose the fol-\nlowing hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1a (H1a): Individuals with a high degree of\nacceptance of social justice ideals and related values (e.g.,\nattitudes toward the behavior), such as the belief that one\nshould act for social justice, or that it is right or fair to\npromote equality of opportunity for everyone, regardless\nof background will intend to act consistently with these\nvalues through their consumer behaviors.\nHypothesis 1b (H1b): Intentions to act will mediate the\nrelationship between the attitudes toward the behavior\nand the actual behavior.\nHypothesis 2a (H2a): Individuals experiencing subjec-\ntive norms in their environment in favor of performing a\ngiven behavior consistent with social justice will intend to\nact consistently with these values through their consumer\nbehaviors.\nHypothesis 2b (H2b): Intentions to act will mediate the\nrelationship between subjective norms and the actual\nbehavior.\n4 SAGE Open\nHypothesis 3a (H3a): Individuals with high-perceived\nbehavioral control with respect to social justice will intend\nto act consistently with values through their consumer\nbehaviors.\nHypothesis 3b (H3b): Intentions to act will mediate the\nrelationship between perceived subjective norms and the\nactual behavior.\nHypothesis 3c (H3c): Individuals with high-perceived\nbehavioral control will act consistently with their values\nthrough their consumer behaviors.\nThe full model is illustrated in Figure 1 below:\nMethod\nSample and Procedure\nThe participants in this study consisted of 299 (response rate:\n85%) undergraduate college students from a small liberal\narts college in the United States. Stratified sampling tech-\nniques were utilized to capture students at different class lev-\nels and from different fields of study. Following IRB approval\nby the institution, the subjects were provided with an\ninformed consent in which the subjects were told that the\nstudy aimed to study planned behaviors, intentions, and con-\nsumer behaviors. Of the respondents, 160 (53%) identified\nas male and 139 (47%) as female. The mean age was approx-\nMeasures. The study utilized an adapted version of the Social\nJustice Scale (SJS) developed by Torres-Harding and col-\nleagues (2012) designed to measure how college students\ndiffer on their attitudes and values regarding social justice.\nThe SJS is based on Ajzen's model and is designed with the\npurpose of measuring social-justice-related values, attitudes,\nperceived behavioral control, subjective norms, and inten-\ntions based on a four-factor conception of Ajzen's theory.\nThe development of the scale included a confirmatory factor\nanalysis and analyses for reliability and validity to test the\nproperties of the scale. Furthermore, we added items designed\nto capture the students' actual consumer behaviors and how\nthey let firms' labor standards and ethics affect their deci-\nsions to do business with a particular retailer.\nSocial Justice Attitudes (SJA) were measured utilizing the\noriginal 11 items from Torres-Harding and colleagues'\n(2012) scale. These items included \"I believe that it is impor-\ntant to make sure that all individuals and groups have a\nchance to speak and be heard, especially those from tradi-\ntionally ignored or marginalized groups,\" \"I believe that it is\nimportant to allow individuals and groups to define and\ndescribe their problems, experiences and goals in their own\nterms,\" and \"I believe that it is important to talk to others\nabout societal systems of power, privilege, and oppression.\"\nResponses were made on a 7-point scale ranging from 1\n(strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Cronbach's  for\nSocial Justice Perceived Behavioral Control (SJPBC)\nwas measured utilizing the original five items from Torres-\nHarding and colleagues' (2012) scale. These items included,\n\"I am confident that I can have a positive impact on others'\nlives,\" \"I am certain that I possess an ability to work with\nindividuals and groups in ways that are empowering,\" and\n\"If I choose to do so, I am capable of influencing others to\npromote fairness and equality.\" Responses were made on a\n7-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly\nagree). Cronbach's  for this scale was .67.\nSocial Justice Subjective Norms (SJSN) were measured\nutilizing the original four items from Torres-Harding and\ncolleagues' (2012) scale. These items included \"Other peo-\nple around me are engaged in activities that address social\ninjustices,\" \"Other people around me feel that it is important\nto engage in dialogue around social injustices,\" and \"Other\npeople around me are supportive of efforts that promote\nsocial justice.\" Responses were made on a 7-point scale\nranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).\nCronbach's  for this scale was .75.\nSocial justice behavioral intentions (SJBI) were measured\nutilizing the original four items from Torres-Harding and\ncolleagues' (2012) scale. These items included, \"In the\nfuture, I will do my best to ensure that all individuals and\ngroups have a chance to speak and be heard,\" \"In the future,\nI intend to talk with others about social power inequalities,\nsocial injustices and the impact of social forces on health and\nwell-being,\" and \"In the future, I intend to engage in activi-\nties that will promote social justice.\" Responses were made\non a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7\n(strongly agree). Cronbach's  for this scale was .86.\nAseven-item scale was developed and used to assess actual\nconsumer behaviors. Items included, \"I let price or quality of\nthe products that I desire dictate where I shop,\" \"I do not go out\nof my way to find a business known to utilize ethical business\npractices if a more convenient choice exists,\" \"I let retailers'\nbusiness practices influence my decision to shop at their\nstores,\" \"I do not shop with retailers that I know, or suspect\nsells products produced with child labor,\" \"I do not shop at\nretail stores if I suspect that working conditions are poor in fac-\ntories supplying their products,\" \"I do not shop at retail stores if\nI suspect that working conditions are poor in the stores,\" and\nFigure 1. Proposed full model.\nSchulz and Braekkan 5\n\"When shopping at retail stores I do not consider the retailer's\nreputation regarding their business practices.\" The items were\nselected following a preliminary factor analysis of 25 items.All\nitems had a 7-point Likert-type scale response format (e.g., 1 =\nstrongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree). Internal consistency\nestimates (alpha coefficients) were .86.\nA number of control variables were used in the analyses:\ngender, age, year in school, ethnicity, major, and previous work\nexperience. In addition, four items were generated to control\nfor the respondents' existing knowledge of labor issues. These\nitems included, \"I am concerned with retail workers'benefits,\"\n\"I pay attention to retail workers'rights to unionize,\" \"I am not\nconcerned with retail workers'wages,\" and \"I find it difficult to\nknow what companies utilize questionable business practices.\"\nAll items had a 7-point Likert-type scale response format (e.g.,\n1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree).\nResults\nThe means, standard deviations, intercorrelations, and reli-\nabilities for all the variables in this study are provided in\nTable 1.

However, individuals with high-\nperceived behavioral control endorsed consumer behaviors\nsuggested a direct relationship between perceived behavioral\ncontrol and behaviors, was confirmed.\nWe conducted follow-up analyses to see if the respon-\ndents' \"interests and knowledge\" in \"industrial relations\"\nand \"labor relations\" would affect the relationship between\nperceived behavioral control and the respondents' consumer\nbehaviors. Hence, a series of moderated regression analyses\nwere performed. Consistent with Aiken and West (1991), the\nvariables used in the interaction were centered at their means\nto make the results more interpretable.\nAs shown in Table 5 and illustrated in Figure 2, the effects\nof \"perceived behavioral control\" on \"consumer behaviors\"\nvaried across levels of \"interests and knowledge.\"\nAs Figure 2 illustrates, the positive relationship between\n\"perceived behavioral control\" and \"consumer behaviors\" was\nsignificantly strengthened among respondents endorsing high\n\"interests and knowledge.\" The slope analysis confirmed this.\nAmong individuals with low \"interests and knowledge,\"\nendorsing low \"perceived behavioral control\" scored on aver-\nage 2.60 on \"consumer behaviors,\" while individuals with low\n\"interests and knowledge\" endorsing high \"perceived behav-\nTable 4.

In other words, whereas there were minimal differences in\nterms of consumer behaviors when perceived behavioral con-\ntrol was low between individuals with different degrees of\ninterest and knowledge, the gap widened significantly as per-\nceived level of control increased. Specifically, there were sta-\ntistically significant differences on consumer behaviors scores\nbetween high and low interest and knowledge subjects among\nthose with high perceived control.\nDiscussion\nImplications\nThis study contributes to our understanding of how cogni-\ntions and affects regarding ethical business practices affect\nconsumer behaviors. Normally, one would expect that some-\none who values fairness and equity in social interactions\nwould be less likely to engage with businesses that are known\nfor unethical business practices. However, consistent with\nprevious research, findings in this article suggest that con-\nsumers who are aware of unethical behaviors do not neces-\nsarily let their intentions lead to consistent outcomes.\nResults from this study indicate that individuals scoring\nhigh on measures of social justice ideals and related values\n(e.g., attitudes toward the behavior), such as the belief that\none should act for social justice, or that it is right or fair to\npromote equality of opportunity for everyone, regardless of\nbackground showed intentions to act consistently with these\nvalues through their consumer behaviors (H1a), but these\nintentions did not relate to self-reported actual behaviors\n(inconsistent with H1b). In other words, intentions to act did\nnot mediate the relationship between the attitudes toward the\nbehavior and actual behaviors.\nSimilarly, individuals experiencing subjective norms in\ntheir environment in favor of performing a given behavior\nconsistent with social justice revealed intentions to act con-\nsistently with these values through their consumer behaviors\n(as suggested by H2a), but these did not translate into actual\nbehaviors (H2b). Hence, intentions to act did not mediate the\nrelationship between subjective norms and actual behaviors.\nSubjective norms can therefore be rejected as a possible pre-\ndictor of consumer behaviors that are consistent with such\nenvironmental norms.\nOn the contrary, the study confirmed that respondents\nendorsing high behavioral control with respect to social jus-\ntice both intended to act consistently with values through\ntheir consumer behaviors (H3a) and their actual behaviors\n(H3b). In other words, the results suggest that intentions to\nact both mediated the relationship between perceived subjec-\ntive norms and the actual behavior as these individuals\nreported acting consistently with their values through their\nconsumer behaviors.\nThere are a number of other takeaways from the findings\nin this study with respect to what we know about concerns\nabout labor standards and other social-justice-related issues.\nThese findings have been summarized in five major catego-\nries to make them concise and clear.\nFirst, attitudes and general dispositions toward a given\nbehavior, such as the belief that one should act for social jus-\ntice, or that it is right or fair to promote equality of opportu-\nnity for everyone, regardless of background, is not by itself a\npredictor of behaviors. Such attitudes appear to generate to\nsome intentions, but not necessarily lead to concrete actions.\nAs an example, having a favorable view of work that seeks to\nrectify wrongs in the workplace is not sufficient to affect\nconsumer behaviors.\nSecond, experiencing subjective norms, such as contex-\ntual messages, norms, and support may facilitate one's inten-\ntions to act for social justice, but not necessarily lead to\naction. In other words, this study revealed that although sub-\njects endorsing such support appeared to also endorse inten-\ntions to act consistently with these norms, they did not\nnecessarily act upon these intentions. Hence, attitudes, dis-\npositions, and environmental norms are not sufficient to\naffect consumer behaviors.\nThird, perceived behavioral control, or one's perceived\nability to perform an act in a social justice context, appears to\nbe a strong predictor of consumer behaviors. The extent to\nwhich a person feels it is possible to \"make a difference\" and\nhave an impact on existing social conditions will affect both\nintentions and actions according to these results. In sum-\nmary, Individuals who value social justice will not engage in\neconomic exchanges with retailers who infringe on workers'\nrights to unionize, are known to exploit workers, and who\nutilize unethical practices throughout their supply chains\n(e.g., use of child labor or forced labor in factories) unless\nthey perceive that their actions can change the status quo.\nFourth, it is evident that consumers need to be educated\nabout workplace rights. As Table 5 indicates, it is the combi-\nnation of interest and knowledge that affect actions. Interest\nalone is not enough. One may think of how generations of\nthe past were very well informed about social justice issues\nsuch as civil rights, Western warfare in other hemispheres,\nand gender equality and how these issues were pushed for-\nward by activists at a broad scale. Whereas issues of environ-\nmental concern appear to become a larger part of the U.S.\ncurriculum in both secondary and tertiary education systems,\nlittle is done to promote issues of workplace rights. These\nfindings strongly suggest that actions change when there is\nan interaction of knowledge and interest.\nFifth, we live with the challenge of limited \"behavioral\ncontrol.\" As Lilley, McNally, Yuen, Davis, and Henwood\n(2011) documented very well in their collection of essays,\nCatastrophism, the political left has, to a great extent, used\nfear tactics to call people to action and they question these\n8 SAGE Open\ntactics. Their arguments hinge on the idea that people become\npassive and compliant when issues are introduced as cata-\nstrophic or beyond their control. One may even argue that\nunless people are encouraged to \"make change\" one con-\nsumer at a time, we fall victims to the powers that want to\nmaintain the status quo. Table 5 reveals that experiencing\nbehavioral control is absolutely key for becoming an agent of\nchange.\nLimitations of Study\nWhereas the study has added to our understanding of how\nsocial justice attitudes, social norms, and perceived control\naffect consumer behaviors, there were limitations that should\nbe addressed. The data were based on self-reports that were\ncollected cross-sectionally. Biases may therefore be present\ndue to common-method variance (CMV). The study fol-\nlowed recommendations by Conway and Lance (2010) and\nPodsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, and Podsakoff (2003) and uti-\nlized existing instruments that have been proven to be both\nreliable and valid in previous studies in an attempt to over-\ncome some of these problems. The extent to which CMV\nwas a problem in the data was calculated based on the proce-\ndures described by Podsakoff and colleagues (2003). The\nresults indicated that the average variance explained by the\nCMV was less than 0.75%, which is considered acceptable\nand fair (Podsakoff et al., 2003). The surveys utilized coun-\nterbalancing question order to reduce the potential of such\nproblems. Finally, a remaining concern is the utilization of\nself-reports. This is difficult to overcome with this research\ndesign as the constructs measured are latent individual con-\nstructs and the authors were unable to observe actual\nbehaviors.\nFuture Studies\nFuture research could utilize longitudinal data. Causality was\nnot addressed in this study due to its use of cross-sectional\ndata, so there is a possibility that those acting consistent with\ntheir values experience higher perceived control as a result of\ntheir actions. Hence, these respondents could become more\ncognitively aware of how actions directed against unethical\nbusinesses generate \"control.\"\nAlthough the sample was of moderate size (n = 299),\nfuture studies could benefit from the use of larger samples\nand possibly a larger variety of respondents to draw compari-\nsons between different demographics. It could also be bene-\nficial to replicate this study and compare differences among\nsubjects with different income levels. One may look at how\nhigh-income individuals perceive the importance of labor\nstandards and other social-justice-related issues in compari-\nson with individuals with lower income.\nFuture studies may also use theoretical frameworks such\nas those offered by the theory of reasoned action (see\nFishbein &Ajzen, 1975 for an overview), which is frequently\nused in psychology to predict how individuals will behave\nbased on their preexisting attitudes and behavioral inten-\ntions, and Bandura's (see Bandura, 1986) concept of self-\nefficacy, to examine intentions and consumer behaviors. The\nlatter concept might be particularly fruitful in this context as\nit lends itself to examine various paths in the development of\nself-efficacy, the dynamics of self-efficacy, and lack thereof,\nand habits of attribution that contribute to, or detract from,\nself-efficacy.\nFinally, this study utilized college students who were\nasked to reflect upon their consumer behaviors and inten-\ntions. One may want to examine whether these results would\nhold true as age increases. If these behaviors are unique to\nthis group of consumers as a result of, for instance, limited\ndisposable income, the literature may benefit from a broader\ndemographic in future samples.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAiken, L.
