Hence, `new inequalities' may arise that lead to unequal prospects in, for instance,\neducational and occupational careers (e.g. DiMaggio and Bonikowski, 2008; Warschauer and\nMatuchniak, 2010). Of course, the question may be asked of how these `new inequalities' emerge\nand whether `traditional' mechanisms of social reproduction are also at work in this `new' domain.\nIn order to analyze adolescents' online reading behavior, we elaborate on the large body of\nexisting research on `offline' reading behavior and reading proficiency and apply it to online\nreading behavior. A dominant factor in the development of reading habits is the early reading\nsocialization experienced in the family home (Bus et al., 1995; Whitehurst and Lonigan, 1998).\nFollowing Bourdieu's (1977) theory of cultural and social reproduction, provision of a stimulat-\ning literacy environment in early childhood, for instance, by reading aloud or playing word\ngames, can be regarded as a core mechanism for the intergenerational transfer of parental cul-\ntural capital. However, it is unclear whether this `traditional' mechanism of social reproduction\nis also relevant to online reading behavior. In this article, we address this association between the\nhome literacy environment in early childhood and online reading behavior in adolescence. More\nconcretely, we focus on the parent\u00adchild interactive (intentional) aspect of the early home liter-\nacy environment, as in reading books together, playing word games, and singing songs, since\nthese activities seem most determinant in the process of reading socialization (e.g. Kloosterman\nSocial inequality is observed particularly for `informational' or `highbrow' traditional (i.e.\noffline) reading activities, and these reading activities, more than `recreational' or `lowbrow' read-\ning, are most beneficial for success in today's societies (e.g. Notten and Kraaykamp, 2010; Van\nDeursen and Van Dijk, 2016). Therefore, we focus here on `informational' online reading behavior\n(i.e. reading for information on the Internet), which has become a well-established concept in\nresearch on online reading and digital divides (Coiro, 2012; Leu et al., 2009). Informational online\nreading behavior includes activities such as reading news online and searching for information\nonline (Gil-Flores et al., 2012; OECD, 2011). Our first and general research question is as follows:\nTo what extent does the home literacy environment in early childhood stimulate informational\nonline reading behavior in adolescence? Here, we also analyze whether the early home literacy\nenvironment mediates at least some part of the association between parental cultural capital and\nadolescents' informational online reading behavior and whether the link between the early home\nliteracy environment and students'online reading behavior is mediated by students'offline reading\n(offline reading skills, reading behavior, and attitude toward reading).\nThe second research question addresses variations between countries in the association between\nthe early literacy environment and later online reading behavior. Prior research on parental reading\nsocialization suggests that the home literacy environment has a more pronounced positive effect on\nchildren's school performance in more developed countries than in less developed countries (Chiu\ntries' level of digitalization might be especially crucial in this regard. A comparison of countries at\ndifferent stages of digitalization might therefore reveal differences in the relation between early\nparental literacy socialization and adolescents' online reading behavior. This leads to our second\nresearch question: To what extent does the relation between the early home literacy environment\nand adolescents' informational online reading behavior differ between countries at different stages\nof digitalization? It can be expected that \u00ad also in the digital domain \u00ad when `basic needs' are\nfulfilled (i.e. when access to the Internet is widespread), differentiation occurs at the `next level',\nin this case, differential use of the Internet (Park, 2008; Van Deursen et al., 2015).\nWe use Bourdieu's (1977) theory of cultural reproduction as our theoretical framework and\ncombine it with digital divide research (e.g. DiMaggio and Hargittai, 2001; Halford and Savage,\n2010) to explain social inequalities in adolescents'informational online reading behavior.Although\nonline reading behavior can be regarded as a `new' form of cultural capital (Paino and Renzulli,\n2013), we argue that the `traditional' mechanisms of cultural reproduction are also at work in this\ndomain. We test this expectation using 2009 data from the OECD's Programme for International\nStudent Assessment (PISA) in combination with country-level information from the World Bank.\nConcretely, we analyze whether a stimulating literacy environment in early childhood is positively\nassociated with informational online reading behavior at age 15, and whether this association is\nstronger in countries with higher levels of digitalization (i.e. Internet diffusion). Our study's main\ncontribution lies in its combining the well-established role of the early home literacy environment\nin reproducing social inequalities with the more recent literature on online reading behavior and\nemergence of `new' inequalities in the digital domain.\nTheoretical framework and previous research\nDigital divides and online reading behavior\nThe ongoing development and diffusion of new information and communication technologies has\nled to `new'inequalities. Differences in access to the new technologies was one of the first inequal-\nities observed, spurring the notion of a `digital divide' in the 1990s (Compaine, 2001). For exam-\nple, individuals with a higher education and higher income were more likely to have access to the\nInternet at that time (National Telecommunications and Information Administration, 1999).\nHowever, with increasing Internet coverage in private households, this `first digital divide' is\nlargely overcome in `digitalized' countries. The widespread access to all kind of knowledge and\ninformation was initially believed to lead to more social equality in information-based societies\n(see, for example, Compaine, 2001; Peter and Valkenburg, 2006). However, more recent research\nfinds other dimensions of digital inequalities related to differences in usage and skills, which form\nthe core of the so-called `second digital divide' (DiMaggio and Hargittai, 2001; Hargittai and\nResearch on the second digital divide shows a clear association between individuals' socioeco-\nnomic status (SES) and their Internet behavior and digital skills. For example, Bonfadelli's (2002)\nstudy observes, `More educated people use the Internet more actively and their use is more infor-\nmation oriented whereas the less educated seem to be interested particularly in the entertainment\nfunctions of the Internet' (p. 65). Such social differences in Internet usage patterns tend to persist\nuntil today; some authors even find increasing inequality in `what we do online' (Van Deursen\net al., 2015: 259). This inequality is consequential because exactly those informational online read-\ning activities that are more frequently performed by individuals with higher SES are also more\n`capital-enhancing'. Van Deursen et al. (2015) argue that these kinds of activities `[increase]\nopportunities in the offline world, while recreational Internet activities [are] less likely to enhance\ncapital'(p. 261). Thus, social differences in informational online reading behavior likely strengthen\nsocial inequality.\nFinally, we must stress that not only individuals' online reading behavior is socially stratified\nbut also the skills necessary for online reading (Van Deursen and Van Dijk, 2015). Studies show\nmany similarities between offline and online reading (Coiro, 2011b), and findings largely confirm\nthat students' offline reading proficiency is positively associated with their current online reading\nactivities (see, for example, Coiro, 2011a; Gil-Flores et al., 2012). However, compared to offline\nreading, online reading has additional elements, such as navigation of search engine results, com-\nprehension of wiki entries, and critical evaluation of the source of information on a webpage (Leu\net al., 2009, 2011). Informational online reading behavior thus requires the integration of new\nonline reading skills with traditional offline reading skills. Hence, to find, read, and learn from\ninformation on the Internet, traditional reading skills might not be sufficient, but they are indispen-\nsable (Coiro and Dobler, 2007). Because of this importance of offline reading for online reading,\nour later empirical analyses account for the mediating role of individuals' offline reading skills,\nbehavior, and attitudes.\nBourdieu's theory of cultural reproduction and early reading socialization\nThe transmission of cultural capital from parents to children in the (early) socialization process is\na core element of Bourdieu's (1977, 1986) theory of cultural and social reproduction. We focus\nhere on cultural capital in the embodied state, which includes cultural skills and knowledge as well\nas tastes and attitudes. According to Bourdieu, this kind of cultural capital is needed to succeed in\nthe educational system. However, it `can only be produced by family upbringing'(Bourdieu, 1977:\nthe transmission of cultural capital in the early home environment is considered a core mechanism\nfor the reproduction of social inequality.\nRegarding young people's reading behavior and skills, this cultural capital transmission process\nmainly takes place via the home literacy environment. Parents engage in actual teaching and\ninstruction (e.g. reading to their children, teaching the alphabet), and they also serve as role models\nfor their children (e.g. by exposing children to their own daily reading habits and attitudes).\nEmpirical studies confirm that parents with more cultural capital (e.g. more books at home) con-\nduct these kinds of stimulating familial activities more frequently than parents with less cultural\nonly stimulate the cognitive development of their children but also shape their children's attitudes\ntoward reading (Evans et al., 2010; Kloosterman et al., 2011). Following Bourdieu's arguments\nabout the importance of an early beginning of the cultural capital transfer process, and taking into\naccount that socialization processes start at a child's birth, it seems reasonable to assume that the\nearly home literacy environment has an especially strong effect on children's reading behavior.\nThis mechanism is confirmed empirically in a vast array of studies (for an overview, see Bus\net al., 1995; Whitehurst and Lonigan, 1998). Many researchers demonstrate a correlation between\nthe home literacy environment at kindergarten age and children's later reading attitudes and behav-\neven demonstrated. For example, Nagel and Verboord (2012) report a strong effect of the reading\nsocialization climate in the parental home on the frequency of book reading by adolescents and\nyoung adults. A longitudinal study by Schoon et al. (2010) found effects of the literacy environ-\nment in early childhood on adult literacy at age 34.\nCultural reproduction and online reading behavior\nWe apply Bourdieu's theory of cultural reproduction to online reading and argue that online read-\ning behavior is an important form of cultural capital in today's digital world. Paino and Renzulli\n(2013) similarly applied Bourdieu's cultural capital theory to young people's computer proficiency.\nThey argued that `students who possess knowledge of computers and other digital devices [...] are\npresenting themselves as culturally competent members of our information-age society'(Paino and\nRenzulli, 2013: 126). Hence, familiarity with online reading activities, and especially informa-\ntional online reading behavior, seems a relevant form of cultural capital for a child's beneficial\ndevelopment and (future) educational success (see also DiMaggio and Hargittai, 2001; Thiessen\nand Looker, 2007). Lacking such online reading preferences, and corresponding proficiency, might\ntherefore limit children's future success and wellbeing.\nOf course, the question of whether the same mechanisms of cultural reproduction established\nfor `offline' reading behavior can also be found in the domain of informational online reading\nbehavior arises. We expect this to be the case. We argue that the specific skills and attitudes chil-\ndren acquire during their early reading socialization are also useful for online reading. However, as\nset out above, we expect this path to be at least partly mediated by children's offline reading.\nMoreover, in high SES families, where the parents possess a larger stock of cultural capital, early\nreading socialization is provided more often (Myrberg and Ros\u00e9n, 2009; Notten and Kraaykamp,\n2009b). And since early literacy activities likely stimulate informational online reading, we conse-\nquently expect that early reading socialization might mediate the influence of parents' cultural\ncapital on their children's online reading.\nThe relevance of the `traditional' intergenerational transfer of cultural capital has not yet been\nstudied in relation to this `new' form of cultural capital. Building on prior research (L\u00f3pez-Sintas\net al., 2012; Paino and Renzulli, 2013), the current study seeks to explain social divides in infor-\nmational online reading behavior and its development by integrating cultural reproduction theory\nand digital divide research.\nRegarding our application of Bourdieu's theory to informational online reading and in line with\nprior research, we formulate three hypotheses:\nH1. A strong home literacy environment in early childhood is positively associated with stu-\ndents' informational online reading behavior in adolescence.\nH2. The influence of parental cultural capital on students'informational online reading behavior\nis (at least partly) mediated by a stronger home literacy environment in early childhood.\nH3. The effect of a strong home literacy environment in early childhood on students' informa-\ntional online reading behavior is (at least partly) mediated by students' (offline) reading skills,\nattitudes and behavior.\nIn studying online reading behavior, the availability of computers and the digital climate in the\nparental home have to be considered. Prior research shows benefits of (early) computer use at\nhome for children's literacy skills (i.e. letter knowledge) as well as children's reading, word recog-\nnition, reading comprehension, and online reading proficiency (Attewell et al., 2003; Castles et al.,\n2013; Lee and Wu, 2012). Thus, to avoid spurious conclusions in our study and to exclude an\nalternative mechanism, we take account of the digital climate within adolescents' family home.\nCountry differences in the relation between early home literacy and online reading\nIn recent cross-national comparative research on reading, marked differences were found between\ncountries in the influences of the early literacy environment, parents' attitudes toward reading, and\nthe number of books in the home on children's reading skills (Barone, 2006; Chiu et al., 2012;\nask whether these country differences can be attributed to particular country characteristics and\nwhether they also pertain to informational online reading behavior. We are not aware of any previ-\nous studies of country differences in the association between the (early) home literacy environment\nand children's online reading behavior. However, research on digital divides and cultural reproduc-\ntion suggests some argumentation and expectations in this regard.\nAccording to digital divide research, computer and Internet access was initially limited, and\nthe preserve of the higher social strata in society. However, the ongoing process of digital\ndevelopment has made all kinds of assets (like computer hardware and Internet access) avail-\nable to the larger population. As a consequence, the initial social divide in digital access (i.e.\nthe first digital divide) gradually disappeared. This corresponds to the `diffusion of innovations\nmodel' (Rogers, 2003) and the `normalization model' from digital divide research (see, e.g.\nPeter and Valkenburg, 2006), which hold that (social) inequalities in online access eventually\ndisappear.\nHowever, recent research suggests that with the spread of digital access and the closing of the\naccess gap, a second digital divide emerges: inequality in digital behaviors and skills. This inequal-\nity is highly correlated with social stratification in different countries (see, e.g. DiMaggio and\nsocioeconomic position and socialization are demonstrably important in shaping and differentiat-\ning children's online behaviors in countries with different levels of development and Internet dif-\nAccording to the social and cultural reproduction perspective, parental investments may be\nmore pronounced and rewarding in more developed and digitalized countries, where children's\nbasic needs in the digital domain are met (i.e. access to computer hardware and the Internet; see\nalso Paino and Renzulli, 2013; Park, 2008). For `offline' reading, some scholars argued that in\ncontexts where educational resources and opportunities are more accessible (which they are in\nmore developed countries), high SES parents with higher levels of cultural capital may further\nstimulate their children's development (e.g. through reading activities at home) to retain their\nelite position. For instance, Chiu and McBride-Chang (2010) found that cultural communication\nwithin the parental home is more strongly linked to children's reading skills in countries with a\nhigher gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Hence, previous findings suggest that the effect\nof family factors and the home literacy environment is greater in countries with a higher level of\ncultural and economic development (Notten and Kraaykamp, 2009a; Park, 2008). So, in line\nwith Bourdieu's notion of cultural cleavages, a similar argument can be made regarding online\nreading: In countries with a higher level of digitalization, when the `basic needs' are met in the\ndigital domain (i.e. access to hardware and the Internet) and the first-level digital divide is\n(mainly) overcome, an even stronger social differentiation may occur with regard to digital\nbehaviors and skills (the second digital divide). The influence of (early) reading socialization on\nonline reading behavior in adolescence, especially informative online reading behavior, may\ntherefore be greater in countries with a higher rate of Internet diffusion. This leads to our next\nhypothesis:\nH4. The positive relation between a strong early home literacy environment and students'\ninformational online reading behavior is more pronounced in more digitalized countries.\nTo sum up, we combine the literature on (early) parental reading socialization with digital divide\nresearch, thereby applying a well-known mechanism for the reproduction of cultural and social\ninequality to the digital domain. Concretely, we analyze the association between the home literacy\nenvironment in early childhood and adolescents' informational online reading behavior and also\ntest whether this association varies between countries depending on countries' level of digitaliza-\ntion. This latter research question may also provide an indication of whether we should expect\nrising digital inequalities in the future.\nData, methods, and measurements\nData\nThe main source of data for this study was the 2009 OECD PISA. PISA measures the school perfor-\nmance of 15-year-olds by means of standardized tests. In addition, PISA administers student and par-\nent surveys to gain a detailed picture of student and family characteristics (see also http://www.oecd.\norg/pisa/). Our research uses data from both the student survey and the parent survey. Students were\nsampled via a two-stage design. First, in each country, a minimum of 150 schools was selected. Next,\nthirty-five 15-year-olds were randomly selected from each school (stratified sampling). Our focus on\nthe influence of the early home literacy environment restricted us to use only countries that voluntarily\nadministered the parental questionnaire, which includes questions about early literacy activities (this is\nalso why we used PISA 2009 rather than PISA 2012, which lacks these data). The questions on early\nliteracy environment were available for 13 countries: Chile, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Hong Kong-\nChina, Hungary, Italy, Korea, Lithuania, Macao-China, New Zealand, Panama, and Portugal.1 In these\ncountries, students took home the questionnaire to be filled in by their parents, though not all parents\ncompleted the survey (12.8% missing). We used only cases with parent interviews available.\nNext, we linked the PISAdata to two country-level indicators (from the World Bank) that appear\nparticularly relevant to online reading behavior and representative of a country's level of develop-\nment: a country's level of digital development and educational expansion. Because of the limited\nnumber of countries, we cannot generalize our findings to all countries (i.e. worldwide). We omit-\nted from our analyses students who reported never having used a computer (1.2% of the respond-\nents) and those with missing values on one of the included variables. Robustness checks showed\nthat taking account of the missing values (including missing values on the parent interviews) by\nmultiple imputation (MI; Rubin, 1987) did not affect the conclusions. Our final sample consisted\nMeasurements\nDependent variable.For our dependent variable, informational online reading behavior, students\nwere asked about their engagement in the following online activities: (1) reading e-mails, (2) chat-\nting online (e.g. via MSN), (3) reading news online, (4) using an online dictionary or encyclopedia\n(e.g. Wikipedia), (5) searching for online information to learn about a particular topic, (6) taking\npart in online group discussions or forums, and (7) searching for practical information online (e.g.\nschedules, events, trips, and recipes). Answer categories were (0) `don't know what it is' and `never\nor almost never', (1) `several times a month', (2) `several times a week', and (3) `several times a\nday'. Prior research on the same items distinguished between informational and recreational or\nfollowed this established differentiation. Of course, some of the items are rather ambiguous in this\nrespect (e.g. reading e-mails might be an informational or a recreational activity). Using the same\ning to a factor representing informational online reading behavior, and we followed this procedure\nand interpretation.2 We created an additive index measuring informational online reading behavior\nby taking the mean of these four items (re-scaled to a value range 0\u00ad12). Its Cronbach's alpha of\nIndividual-level independent and control variables\nEarly home literacy environment. Parents were asked how often they, or someone else in their home,\nundertook the following activities during the child's first year of education (International Standard\nClassification of Education 1 (ISCED 1)): (1) reading books, (2) telling stories, (3) singing songs, (4)\nplaying with alphabet toys, (5) talking about things they had done, (6) talking about what they had\nread, (7) playing word games, (8) writing letters or words, and (9) reading aloud signs and labels.\nAnswer categories were (0) `never or hardly ever', (1) `once or twice a month', (2) `once or twice\na week', and (3) `every day or almost every day'. An exploratory factor analysis revealed only one\ndimension.3 We constructed a scale measuring early home literacy environment by taking the mean\nof all nine items (re-scaled to a value range 0\u00ad27) (Cronbach's alpha:=0.80; ordinal alpha=0.88).\nParental cultural capital. Parental cultural capital is represented by parents'educational level and\nthe number of books at home. Parental educational level was measured by the highest parental\neducation in years, ranging from 3 to 18years of education. Students were asked to indicate the\nnumber of books at home, not including magazines, newspapers, and schoolbooks. The number of\nbooks in the home is an established indicator for parental reading attitudes and a `scholarly culture'\nat home, net of parental educational level (Evans et al., 2010; Marks, 2005). Answer categories\nranged from (0) `0\u00ad10 books in the home' to (5) `more than 500 books in the home'. We used\nthis as a quasi-metric variable but also tested an alternative version with dummy variables, which\nyielded the same results (a very linear pattern).\nAnother family feature included was parental occupational status, which is a relevant element\nof parental SES and measured by the highest parental score on the International Socio-Economic\nIndex of Occupational Status (ISEI) (Ganzeboom et al., 1992), ranging from 16 to 90. We also\nincluded family structure, indicating whether the respondent lived in a (1) `single parent family\nhome', a (2) `two-parent family home', or a (3) `mixed family home'.\nStudents' reading behavior, attitude and skills. We measured offline reading skills by students'read-\ning test scores. This variable was created by taking the mean of five plausible values gauging stu-\ndents' reading proficiency. Offline reading behavior was measured by the time students generally\nspent reading for enjoyment. Answer categories were (0) `I do not read for enjoyment', (1) `30min-\nutes or less a day', (2) `more than 30minutes to less than 60minutes a day', (3) `1 to 2hours a day',\nand (4) `more than 2hours a day'. Reading attitude was measured by 11 items indicating how much\nthe respondent enjoyed reading (e.g. `I read only if I have to', `reading is one of my favorite hob-\nbies') with answer categories ranging from (0) `strongly disagree' to (3) `strongly agree'. Negative\nitems were reversed. We constructed a scale measuring attitude toward reading taking the mean of\nDigital or online resources at home.Students were asked how many computers there were\nwithin the family home to derive the number of PCs at home. Answer categories were (0) `no\ncomputer', (1) `one computer', (2) `two computers', and (3) `three or more computers'. The\nvariable Internet access at home indicates whether students had Internet access within their\nfamily home. Answer categories were (0) `no access' or (1) `access at home'. In addition to\nonline resources at home, the PISA 2009 dataset includes a measure of students' digital skills,\nthat is, test results from the Electronic Reading Assessment (ERA). However, the ERA module\nwas conducted in only 7 of our 13 countries, so we could not use these scores for our analysis.\nSensitivity analyses including the ERA test scores as an additional control variable in those 7\ncountries did not change our results.\nFurther control variables.Respondents'age is a linear variable ranging from 15.25 to 16.33years.\nRespondents' gender indicates whether the student was (0) `male' or (1) `female'.\nCountry-level variables\nLevel of digitalization and development. The level of Internet diffusion indicates the percentage of\nWe also included a more global measurement of a country's level of development specifically related\nto `information-based' societies as a control variable. This was a country's level of educational expan-\nsion or tertiary education, measured by the gross enrollment ratio in tertiary education in 2009 (The\nWorld Bank, 2015b).4 This ratio measures the total enrollment in tertiary education (ISCED 5 and 6),\nregardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the total population of the 5-year age group following on\nfrom secondary school leaving. Note that this ratio may therefore exceed 100percent (see Table 1).\nFor inclusion in the analyses, all metric individual variables were z-standardized, and country-\nlevel variables were centered to the arithmetic mean. Table 1 presents an overview of all model\nvariables; Appendix 1 presents additional descriptive information per country.5\nMethod and plan of analysis\nThe aim of our study is to gain greater insight into the impact of early home literacy activities on\nstudents' online informational reading behavior and to determine how this relation is affected by a\ncountry's level of digitalization. We therefore employ ordinary least squares (OLS) regression mod-\nels with fixed country-effects and cross-level interactions (see Bol et al., 2014; M\u00f6hring, 2012). This\nmethodology accommodates the fact that the countries are rather dissimilar in multiple domains (e.g.\neconomics, politics, and culture). The fixed effects of the countries, by including country dummies in\nall models, capture all of the between-country heterogeneity. Therefore, in regression models with\ncountry-fixed effects, the main effects of country-level characteristics are excluded. However, the\nmoderator effect of macro-level characteristics (here, country-level characteristics) can be estimated\nin fixed effects models by means of cross-level interactions. The cross-level interaction effects then\nestimate possible differences in the effects of individual-level variables by country characteristics,\nwhich addresses our second research question. Therefore, we include cross-level interactions between\ncountry characteristics and early home literacy activities. In order to take into account the hierarchical\ndata structure with students nested in schools, we used clustering for schools in all models.\nWe estimate five models. The baseline or null model includes the country-fixed effect, that is, all the\ncountry dummies. Model 1 adds all control variables and parental cultural capital. Model 2 additionally\nincludes early home literacy activities, which is the focus of our research. Model 3 adds students'\noffline reading skills, reading attitudes, and reading behavior in order to test the extent that the impact\nof early home literacy activities runs indirectly via offline reading. Additionally, mediation tests are\nperformed (not presented) using the method proposed by Karlson, Holm, and Breen (KHB) (Kohler\net al., 2011), comparing model 1 to 2, and model 2 to 3. Model 4a and 4b use the same individual-level\nvariables as model 2, but add cross-level interactions between early home literacy activities and level\nof digitalization and tertiary education (country-level variables). The findings of the country-level\nfixed effects models appear robust across the 13 countries included; stepwise deletion of countries as\nwell as using a subset of only European countries did not affect our main conclusions.6\nResults of country-level fixed effects models\nIndividual-level results\nTable 2 presents the results of the regression models with country-fixed effects. In the null model,\nthe country-fixed effects account for 3 percent of the total variation in students' informational\nonline reading behavior. Apparently, students from different countries do not differ much in their\ninformational online reading behavior. Next, in model 1, parental cultural capital and all control\nvariables are included. The results indicate that students from parental homes with higher levels\nof cultural capital, that is, having parents with a higher educational level (b=\nbooks at home (b=0.090), are more avid online informational readers than students from families\nwith lower levels of parental cultural capital. These findings indicate a positive and direct correla-\ntion between cultural resources within the parental home and students' informational online read-\ning behavior.\nParental occupational status positively correlates with online reading behavior, as well as\nInternet at home and the supply of computers at home. Moreover, boys and older students are more\navid online readers than girls and younger students.\nIn model 2, early home literacy activities are additionally included. First, the findings show a\nsignificant and positive correlation between parental early home literacy activities and students'\ninformational online reading behavior, corroborating hypothesis 1.7 An increase in early home\nactivities by 1 standard deviation is associated with an increase in students'online reading behavior\nof 0.070 standard deviations (= a 14th of a standard deviation). This effect therefore seems rather\nmodest in size. However, also the effect size of the number of computers at home (one of the most\nimportant control variables) is only a 10th of a standard deviation (b\n=\ntherefore not much larger. Moreover, robustness checks indicate that the early home environment\nis significantly associated with each of the online reading activities included in our measure of\ninformational online reading behavior.\nTable 1.

Moreover, in line with hypothesis 2, parental\ncultural capital, represented by parental educational level and number of books at home, is partly\nmediated by early reading socialization. Comparing model 1 to model 2, a mediation analysis\nshows that 18.6percent of the effect of parental education and 9.4percent of the effect of the num-\nber of books on online reading behavior are mediated by the early home literacy environment (both\nindirect effects are significant with p0.001). This seems in line with Bourdieu's cultural repro-\nduction theory, since the reduction of the effects of parental cultural capital is quite substantial\nalthough not very large.\nIn model 3, we add students' offline reading skills, reading behavior, and reading attitude. All\nthree indicators positively relate to informational online reading. Hence, students who are better\nand more frequent and enthusiastic readers also tend to show more informational online reading.\nMoreover, the regression coefficient of early home literacy is reduced compared to model 2.\nComparing models 2 and 3, a mediation analysis shows that adolescents' reading skills, reading\nbehavior, and attitude toward reading together mediate 14.7percent of the effect of the early home\nliteracy environment on adolescents'online reading behavior. Adolescents'attitude toward reading\nalone mediates 10.5percent, while the mediation via reading behavior (3.1%) and reading skills\n(1.1%) is very small. However, all these indirect effects are statistically significant (p0.001).\nThus, hypothesis 3 is, in principal, supported by these results \u00ad however, the mediation effects are\nrather small. Even when controlling for students' offline reading skills, behavior, and attitude, the\ndirect effect of the early home literacy environment remains significant. Hence, early literacy\nactivities in the parental home seem to have a lasting direct effect on online reading behavior and,\nthough to a far lesser extent, also an indirect effect via students'offline reading skills, behavior, and\nattitude (see also Appendix 2). Note that the relation between parental cultural capital and online\nreading is partly mediated by students'offline reading: 10.8percent of the effect of parental educa-\ntion and 56.5percent of the effect of the number of books is mediated by students' reading skills,\nbehavior, and attitude (comparison between model 2 and model 3, p0.001).\nIn general, our findings agree with Bourdieu's notion of cultural reproduction and social dif-\nferentiation in cultural tastes and with previous research on the intergenerational transmission of\ncultural and media preferences.\nResults on country differences\nNext, we conducted a more in-depth exploration of possible between-country differences in the\nrelation between early home literacy activities and students'informational online reading behavior.\nTable 3 presents the results. In model 4a and 4b, the cross-level interactions between early home\nliteracy and a country's level of digitalization and tertiary education are included. The results show\nthat the impact of early home literacy on informational online reading behavior remains quite sta-\nble across countries with different levels of development (non-significant cross-level interactions).\nArobustness check including interactions between a country's level of digitalization and all control\nvariables leads to the same findings. This means that early reading socialization at home positively\ncorrelates with informational online reading behavior, apparently regardless of a country's level of\ndigitalization or educational expansion (i.e. developmental level of information-based society).\nThe findings indicate a rather similar degree of social inequality in the intergenerational transmis-\nsion of informational online reading behavior across countries with different levels of develop-\nment. To conclude, we do not find that the relation between a positive early home literacy\nenvironment and online reading behavior becomes stronger if a child grows up in a more digital-\nized society, which contradicts hypothesis 4.\nConclusion and discussion\nThis research aimed to gain greater insight into the association between early reading socialization\nin the family home and informational online reading behavior in adolescence, as well as to deter-\nmine country differences in this association. In framing our research model, we relied upon the\nliterature on the role and lasting effects of home literacy and parental reading socialization on\nchildren's `traditional' or `offline' reading behavior and skills. In formulating our hypotheses, we\nused Bourdieu's (1977) theory of cultural reproduction in combination with digital divide research.\nThis study serves to advance existing literature by integrating the established role of the early home\nliteracy environment in reproduction of social inequality with more recent findings on online read-\ning and digital divides. To test our hypotheses, we used 2009 data from the OECD's PISA, in\ncombination with country-level information from the World Bank.\nOur results suggest several conclusions. First, we find a positive correlation between early\nparental reading socialization and adolescents' informational online reading behavior. Thus,\nearly reading socialization, as in home literacy activities such as reading aloud and playing word\ngames, seems to predict online reading. This indicates that early home literacy activities are\nrelevant and might lastingly stimulate children's online reading behavior. We also find some\nTable 3.

Students from families with higher educated parents and with more books at home were\nmore avid informational online readers, in part because their parents actively stimulated reading\nin early childhood. Next, we find a positive relation between students' offline reading and their\ninformational online reading behavior. That is, students who are better and more frequent offline\nreaders, and who have a positive attitude toward reading, are also more avid online informational\nreaders. Moreover, offline reading skills, behavior, and attitude mediate a (small) part of the\nimpact of an early home literacy environment on informational online reading behavior. We\nmust therefore conclude that children from families where early home literacy activities are\ncommon become more avid readers, both offline and online. Overall, our findings suggest that\nthe traditional mechanism of cultural reproduction also underlies differentiation in online\nbehaviors.\nWe furthermore explored if, and to what extent, the relation between early home literacy activi-\nties and students' informational online reading behavior varies across countries with different lev-\nels of digital development. We find that the influence of the early home literacy environment is\nquite uniform across countries and does not vary with countries' levels of Internet diffusion or\ntertiary education rates. Our results therefore suggest that social inequality in informational online\nreading is rather persistent, in line with findings from research on the second digital divide. Note,\nhowever, that this inequality is not growing, as one would expect according to the cultural repro-\nduction hypothesis. Hence, children receiving more reading guidance in early childhood become\nmore frequent informational online readers \u00ad independent of their country's level of digital devel-\nopment. On one hand, this is positive, since the social gap in informational online reading is not\nwidening. On the other hand, children do not have equal opportunities, since our findings show that\nmastery of informational online reading, which is essential in today's knowledge-based societies,\nis highly socially stratified.\nAlthough we must formulate our conclusions with care, since we analyzed a limited number of\ncountries, our findings suggest a `new' expression of established social inequalities. Moreover,\nsince online informational reading behavior is indispensable in today's information societies,\nsocial differences herein may lead to inequalities in other domains, such as health, educational\nsuccess, and work status. We might therefore conclude that our study has produced evidence of\nthe notion of persistent inequality and continuation of the old-fashioned intergenerational trans-\nmission of reading behaviors into the digital domain. First, it shows that those who experience a\nstimulating `traditional' offline early home literacy environment are more inclined to read infor-\nmation online. Second, it shows that this inequality persists, even in more developed countries.\nFuture research might expand on this work by incorporating digital and online literacy activities\nin the home in early childhood. For instance, do digital picture books and other digital educational\ntools that parents share or provide to their young children also lastingly affect and stimulate chil-\ndren's offline and online reading skills and behavior? What is the relative importance of such\nonline reading activities compared to `traditional' offline reading activities? Also, since present\ngenerations grow up with social media use, future research could also include recreational or\ncommunicational online reading activities in the study of intergenerational transmission of\ninequality.\nFinally, some limitations of our study bear mentioning. We were forced to restrict our sample\nto the 13 countries that had included questions about early literacy activities in the PISA parent\ninterview. Thus, our results cannot be generalized worldwide. This underpins the relevance of\nfuture research on a larger sample of countries. Another limitation is that the questions on early\nhome literacy activities were asked retrospectively; however, they were asked separately (i.e.\nindependently) from the questions on adolescents' reading activities. Although many studies\nhave been performed with this particular measurement of early home literacy, one must still be\naware of possible memory bias, which may cast doubt on the accuracy of the answers.\nLongitudinal data would be preferable but are very difficult to collect in a cross-national design.\nFurthermore, the cross-sectional nature of the data does not allow for claims to be made on\ncausal relationships. Instead, all the associations found should be regarded as correlational and\ninterpreted with care. This problem affects all cross-sectional studies. In the current study it\nmeans that, though we find support for the hypothesized underlying causal mechanism, more\nexperience with informational online reading might to some extent also stimulate adolescents'\noffline reading.\nDespite these limitations, our research has produced a number of new insights. First, this study\nconstitutes the first country comparison of the association between early reading socialization at\nhome and online reading behavior in adolescence. It finds some evidence of a positive association\nbetween conditions in the family home in early childhood and informational online reading at\nabout age 15. The association, moreover, seems quite stable across the countries examined. This\nmay indicate that `traditional' mechanisms of cultural and social reproduction are still at work in\nour digitalized world, though this preliminary finding warrants replication and further develop-\nment in future research (preferably with longitudinal data).\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1.

We also checked for nonlinearity; our findings remained the same when including early home literacy in\nfive categories (as dummies).\nSupplementary Material\nThe Online Appendix is available for this article online.\nReferences\nAttewell P, Battle J and Suazo-Garcia B (2003) Computers and young children: Social benefit or social prob-\nBaker L, Scher D and Mackler K (1997) Home and family influences on motivations for reading.
