Our study examined the factors affecting the total inpatient pharmacy cost (TINPC) at the Universiti Kebangsaan\nMalaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC). In this retrospective study, we used 2011 administration electronic prescriptions records\nand casemix databases at UKMMC to examine the impact of sociodemographic, diagnostic, and drug variables on the TINPC.\nBivariate and multivariate analyses of the factors associated with TINPC were conducted. The mean inpatient pharmacy cost\nlevel III (B = 0.253, P < .0005) were the primary factors affecting the TINPC. For each day increase in the LOS and each\nincrease of a case of severity level III, there was an increase of approximately USD 11.97 and USD 171.53 in the TINPC per\nyear, respectively. Moreover, the number of prescribed items of drugs and supplies was positively associated with the TINPC\n(B = 0.081, P < .0005). Gender appears to have affected the TINPC; male patients seem to be associated with a higher TINPC\nand comorbidities had the greatest influence on the TINPC.\n",

To establish these linear relationships, we needed 2\nessential sources of individual patient-level data (IPD): phar-\nmaceutical cost data and patient characteristics (ie, diagno-\nsis, procedures, and e-prescriptions data).\nIPD captures the details of specific patient (depending on\nthe data source) and serves as a potential tool to analyze\npharmaceutical cost.4 However, many countries including\nMalaysia are hindered by the lack of the availability of\ndetailed illness costs at IPD, which can reflect negatively on\n1Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\n2Faculty of Public Health, Kuwait University, Kuwait\nCorresponding Author:\nSyed Mohamed Aljunid, International Centre for Casemix and Clinical\nCoding (ITCC), Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Jalan\nYaacob Latiff, 56000 Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\nEmail: saljunid@gmail.com\nthe health economic analysis relevant to the local health care\nsystem. The National University of Malaysia Medical Center\n(UKMMC) was a pioneer that adopted and developed its\nown casemix and Malaysian Diagnosis-Related Groups\nDRGs are patient classification systems (PCSs), which\nare technically and clinically practical systems that facilitate\nthe estimation of patient costs. They classify each patient\ncase according to the diagnosis and other case characteris-\ntics, such as the patient's age, gender, case severity, comor-\nbidities, and procedures performed.8 PCSs have long been\nrecognized as being of great importance in supporting deci-\nsion makers with resource utilization and helping with bud-\nget planning as well.9 MY-DRGs have been linked to and\nsupported by an effective pharmacy electronic prescribing\n(e-prescribing) system, which provides information about\nthe medicine prescribed as well as the quantity, dose, and\npathology at the individual level.10\nConsiderable research has been performed worldwide to\ncorrelate the cost-affecting factors with total hospital costs. A\ncombination of the drug and diagnostic data, rather than either\ntype of data alone, can better estimate total health care\ncosts.4,9,11 Most research, however, has had to use surrogate\ndata for the cost of individual patient care; some studies have\nincrease in the number of prescribed items,3 and demographic\nstructure17; and some have modeled drug expenditures based\non morbidity data.18\nThis article describes some factors that are likely to influ-\nence the TINPC. Our intent is to provide information to aid\nhealth policy makers, health-system pharmacists, and other\nhealth care managers to determine how future sociodemo-\ngraphic, diagnostic, and drug data will jointly affect phar-\nmacy expenditures in their own organizations.\nMethods\nStudy Design and Sampling Technique\nThis study is a secondary analysis of a retrospective study\nconducted at the University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical\npatients admitted in UKMMC from January 1 to December\nCasemix databases. Outpatient visits and patients who were\nadmitted before or after 2011 were excluded. To produce one\nset of data, shared variables such as patient medical registra-\ntion number (MRN), date of admission, and the principle\ndiagnosis were used to join the 2 sets electronically.\nStudy Outcomes and Definitions\nThe primary outcome of this study was the TINPC per\npatient. Figure 1 illustrates the costing approaches used to\ncalculate the TINPC, and the complete estimation methods\nare described in detail elsewhere.4\nA number of proposed factors that may have impacted the\nTINPC are shown in Figure 2. Patient sociodemographics\n(age, gender, and ethnicity) and diagnostic data (the LOS,\ntype of the cases) were extracted from casemix database, and\nthe drug data (the number of medications and supplies items\nprescribed in each episode of care) were extracted from the\ne-prescribing database.\nPatient age was defined as age at the last birthday on the\nday the patient was admitted to UKMMC. Gender was\nassigned base on sex, male (1) and female (2). The ethnici-\nties of the target population were Malay (1), Chinese (2),\nIndian (3), and other nationalities (a small minority of\nMalaysians who do not fit into the broader 3 ethnic groups)\n(4). Hospital LOS was defined as the duration the patient\nstayed in the ward from admission until discharge. In the\nMY-DRG system, the minimum LOS for any patient is 1\nday (at least), including patients who were admitted and dis-\ncharged on the same day. Therefore, the LOS was calculated\nfor each patient / episode using the following equation: (date\nof discharge \u00ad date of admission) + one. The number of\ndrugs and supply items is defined as the number of drugs\nand supplies prescribed in each e-prescription for each inpa-\ntient episode. Patient cases are categorized into 2 case\ngroups: medical and surgical cases. Medical cases are\npatients who were admitted to a medical-based discipline\nward without any major procedures. Surgical cases are\npatients who were admitted to surgical-based discipline\nwards and (usually) underwent major surgical procedures.\nMY-DRG is a casemix system used in Malaysia: it was\ndeveloped based on an international grouper called United\nNations University-Case Based Groups (UNU-CBG) grou-\nper. There are 3 severity levels for acute conditions in\nMY-DRG: severity level I (no complications or comorbidi-\nties), severity level II (minor complications or comorbidi-\nties), and severity level III (major complications or\ncomorbidities). The severity levels are determined by the\ngrouper based on the secondary diagnoses and procedures.\nThe severity level is assigned by the grouper software fol-\nlowing the algorithm.\nStatistical Analysis\nClinical and demographic characteristics were reported for\neach patient based on the episode of care (admission and\ndischarge). Some missing data were found during the data\nanalysis process; however, the extent to which the data\nwere missing was limited and did not affect the structure of\nstudy. The collected data were analyzed using Statistical\nPackage for Social Science (SPSS) program version 16.0\n(SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois).20 A normality test\n(Kolmogorov-Smirnov) was performed and all quantitative\ndata were found to be normally distributed. Descriptive\nanalyses were used to summarize the primary outcome of\nthis study (TINPC per patient) and the affecting factors.\nFurthermore, bivariate analyses (eg, Pearson's correlation\nanalysis, independent-sample t tests, and analysis of\nAljunid and Ali Jadoo 3\nvariance [ANOVA]) were performed to test the association\nbetween the factors and the study outcome. Significant fac-\ntors affecting the TINPC in the bivariate analysis (P value\n< .05) were included in the multivariate analysis.\nMultivariate linear regression analysis (backward\ntechnique) was performed to identify the significant factors\naffecting TINPC. In \"backward elimination,\" all indepen-\ndent variables are entered into the equation first and the\nvariables that are not significant are removed one by one\nuntil a satisfactory model is obtained.\nFigure 1.

However, it was\nnot possible to capture all possible factors. Only 32.7% of\nthe variation was explained; 67.3% of the variation remained\nunexplained. Clearly, other factors may affect the TINPC.\nIn the multivariate regression analysis, LOS and severity\nlevel III showed the strongest impact on the TINPC. These\nfactors appeared to have a significant and positive linear\nassociation with the TINPC. After controlling for other fac-\ntors, for each 1-day increase in LOS, there was an increase\nincrease in TINPC per year; and for each increase in one case\nof severity level III, there was an increase approximately\nyear.\nThese outcomes are expected in a tertiary hospital such\nUKMMC because the more severe cases are referred or\nadmitted. Most of these cases will be seen by the specialists\nand consultants, who are more likely to prescribe high cost\nand new generation drugs, as opposed to the first line or\ngeneric drugs that are often prescribed for less severe cases\n(level I and II).3,21 Moreover, patients with worse conditions\nare likely to need longer hospitalization stays because they\nmust be transferred to the high dependency health service.\nConsequently, they tend to consume more resources. These\npatients usually presented with severe complications and\ncomorbidities.\nPublic health care continues to be the most popular choice\namong Malaysians when seeking medical treatment, with a\nsignificant increase in hospital admission (ie, 1.53% from\nMinistry of Health Malaysia in the national budget has\nIn this study, the number of prescribed drugs and supplies\n(SD = 3.37) items reported in an earlier study conducted by\nAl-Junid et al (2007) at UKMMC.3 However, the number is\nhigher than the average number of 1.4 to 3.8 in South-East\nAsian countries.24,25 Indeed, similarities and differences in\nprescribing patterns and number of items have been reported\nacross different type of health organization.25 Various reasons\nsuch as financial incentives, lack of therapeutic training, and\nTable 2.

Al-Junid et al (2007) and his team found that higher\ndrug costs are related to an LOS of 6 or more days, severity\nlevel II and III, and an increased number of prescribed\ngeneric drugs (ie, 7 or more items).3\nDemographic structure is undoubtedly one of the most\ninfluential factors affecting the TINPC. Our study showed\nthat the patient's age has a significant and positive correla-\ntion with the TINPC. More resources are used for older\npatients, and more drugs are prescribed to them. This finding\ncould also result from the increasing health care demands\nattributed to steady increase in life expectancy as well as an\naging population and wide spread chronic diseases in\nMalaysia.1 Moreover, gender appears to affect the TINPC;\nmale patients seem to be associated with a higher TINPC\nthan female patients. For each increase in the number of\nmales, there was an increase of approximately MYR 28.378\n(equivalent to USD 9.15) increase in the TINPC per year.\nNote that the prescribed number of medications was higher\nin male patients 60 years of age and older, with an average\nLOS of more than 7 days.3\nSurgical procedures may also increase the LOS and con-\ntribute to high cost. UKMMC provides a tertiary referral ser-\nvices at the primary emergency reception center. In this\nstudy, surgical cases were significantly and positively related\nto the TINPC compared with medical cases. For each\nincrease in the number of surgical procedure cases; there was\nan increase of approximately MYR 31.432 (equivalent to\nMalay and Chinese ethnicities constituted up to 77.1% of\nour total sample population. However, in the multivariate\nregression analysis, these ethnicities unexpectedly contrib-\nuted to a lower TINPC compared with Indian and other eth-\nnicities; for each increase in cases of Malay and Chinese\npatients, there was a decrease of approximately MYR\n(equivalent to USD 68.42) in the TINPC per year, respec-\ntively.

The findings of this study should be interpreted in\nlight of a number of limitations. Because of limited time\nand resource constraints, this study was not designed to\ncover a representative number of hospitals in Malaysia. A\nlimited number of factors were tested against the TINPC.\nTherefore, our findings may not be generalizable to all\nmedical settings. However, we think that results of this\nstudy will contribute greatly toward the establishment of\nbaseline data to service and advance policy makers and\nhealth care providers to optimize and refine existing medi-\ncine policies.\nConclusion\nPharmaceutical expenditures have generally been viewed as\na potentially driver of total health care expenditures.\nTherefore, decision makers and pharmacy leaders are encour-\naged to stay appraised of important developments in research\nmethodology and health care policy to be effectively pre-\npared to address changes that might impact pharmacy spend-\ning. The analyses provided in this study focus on factors that\nare more likely to influence inpatient pharmacy cost.\nHowever, health care managers and pharmacy leaders should\nalso carefully monitor other factors that are related to outpa-\ntient visits and patient day care and that are likely to impact\ntotal pharmacy cost and, consequently total hospital costs.\nOur study results suggest that more complicated cases result\nin longer LOSs and that as more drugs and supplies are pre-\nscribed, the TINPC increases.\n"
