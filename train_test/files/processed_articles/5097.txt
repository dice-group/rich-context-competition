Although several neural mechanisms\nCarroll, Neitz, Neitz, & Williams, 2005; Kelly & Martinez-\n2012), the exact locus of such an adaptation is still vague\nphilosophers have provided biased and imprecise reports\nbased on color opponency (Byrne & Hilbert, 2003;\n1997), and only a minority of accounts have considered the\ncomplementary nature of afterimages (Bidwell, 1897; Geisler,\ntary color varies from author to author (Anstis, Vergeer, &\nfused with that of opponent colors (Livingstone, 2002;\nTsuchiya & Koch, 2005). Most of the debate has been based\non red/green contrast and occasionally on yellow/blue.\nHowever, opponent colors blue and yellow (unlike green and\nred) are also true complementary colors, in the colorimetric\nsense--as opposites on a line through the white point in the\nCommission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity\ndiagram (as defined in 1921 by the CIE). Therefore, as blue\nand yellow endorse both the complementary color model and\nthe opponent color model, they are not relevant here. In con-\ntrast, red and green have been key.\nThis article provides empirical evidence that challenges\ncurrent models of afterimages and backs up an account of\nafterimages as locally filtered RGB perception based on com-\nplementary colors.2 It will not address positive afterimages\nwhich appear to be based on different neural mechanisms.\nIn perceptual neuroscience, a widespread model of after-\nimages--the opponent model henceforth--maintains that, in\nresponse to a prolonged colored stimulus, the visual system\nadapts and generates an illusory complementary hue (Bidwell,\nBrocklebank, 1955) as predicted by Hering's opponent color\nKelly & Martinez-Uriegas, 1993; Macpherson & Platchias,\nEach hue produces its complementary hue in the afterimage.

Thus the after-image of red is blue-green\nSince then, several authors have emphasized the role of com-\nplementary colors as regards afterimages (Pridmore, 2008;\nview has not gained the same popularity. In this spirit, here I\npresent experimental results in contrast with all the above\nthree points of the opponent model. Such an evidence will\nsupport a different model of afterimages--the subtractive\nmodel henceforth--to the effect that\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 afterimage hues take place in RGB space rather than\nin Hering's color space;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 afterimage hues depend both on the stimulus and on\nthe background; and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 afterimages are not illusory additions, but localized\nRGB filtered perception.\nOn the basis of such an evidence, a new model of afterim-\nages is put to test. The key hypothesis is that the afterimage\nhue is estimated by the relation:\nA = B S,\n-k\nwhere S is the stimulus one stares at to induce chromatic\nadaptation, B is the background against which one sees the\nafterimage, and A is the color one afterimage.3 A caveat: B\nis not the background surrounding the stimulus, but the\nbackground one stares at after the stimulus (like the gray\nground in von Helmholtz's text). All colors are expressed\nby RGB triplets.4 The model suggests that, by modifying\nspectral sensitivity, in a stimulus-shaped local area, the\nvisual system filters off the stimulus hue from the back-\nground, thereby revealing hues that would not be visible\notherwise. The model predicts different afterimage hues\nfrom those predicted by the Hering-inspired standard\nmodel but consistent with complementary-based models\nConsider Figure 1, if S is saturated red (1,0,0), B is gray\n(\u00bd,\u00bd,\u00bd), and k is, say, \u00bd, then the color one afterimage is A\n= (\u00bd,\u00bd,\u00bd) - \u00bd \u00d7 (1,0,0) = (0,\u00bd,\u00bd), which is unsaturated\ncyan (cyanish gray). It is a prediction that conflicts with the\nopponent model, which predicts a green afterimage (C)\nrather than a cyan one (D). Such a difference allows us to\ncontrast the two models.\nResults\nExperiment 1: Red\u00adGreen Versus Red\u00adCyan\nAn entry way is the red/green complementary afterimage in\nwhich allegedly a red stimulus should produce a green after-\nimage and vice versa (see Table 5, and Figure 6a and 6b).\nSubjects stare at a red stimulus for 20 s and then afterimage\na color against a gray background for 5 s. Immediately after-\nward, the subjects are shown a green and a cyan square side\nby side, and asked to assess which of the two hues is more\nsimilar to the previously experienced afterimage. In such cir-\ncumstances, the opponent model predicts a green afterimage\n(Table 5), whereas the proposed model predicts a cyan after-\nimage. Remarkably, 99% of subjects reported a cyanish\nManzotti 3\nafterimage following a red stimulus, and 95% a magentish\nafterimage after a green stimulus (Table 1). Subjects' reports\ncontradict the standard Hering's opponent color model and\nare consistent with the proposed model.\nExperiment 2: Background Dependence\nThe previous experiment is consistent with the suggested\nsubtractive relation (A = B - kS) as long as the background\n(B) is achromatic. What if the background is colored? To test\nthe dependence on background hues, the previous setup has\nbeen applied to a number of combinations of color stimuli\nand colored backgrounds. The empirical outcomes are\nchecked against both the Hering-inspired standard model\nand the proposed RGB filtering model (see Table 2 and\nFigure 2). While the opponent model predicts that a given\nstimulus should produce the same afterimage regardless of\nthe background, the proposed RGB filtering model predicts\nthat the afterimage color should depend both on the stimulus\nand on the background. The experimental results align well\nwith the outcome predicted by the proposed RGB filtering\nmodel and conflict with the opponent model (Table 3).\nRemarkably, if different backgrounds ensue, the same stimu-\nlus leads to afterimage different hues.\nFor example, after a red stimulus (Figure 2, bottom row),\nthe opponent model predicts afterimaging green against a\nmagenta background, and the subtractive model predicts\nafterimaging blue--96% of subjects reported afterimaging\nblue (Table 3).\nExperiment 3: Complementary Afterimages of\nNegative Images\nComplementary afterimages of negative images offer fur-\nther empirical confirmation. I used a version of the Spanish\nCastle illusion in which viewing a hue-inverted image ren-\nders a subsequently shown achromatic version of the image\nin vivid color (Sadowsky, 2006). Consider the four images\nin Figure 3. P is the original picture; S is a negative version\nof P--Each RGB value is changed into its opposite; B is a\ngrayscale version of P; BN is a false-color version of P. In\nthis case, P provides value and saturation, and S provides the\nIf one stares at the negative image (S) and then shifts the\ngaze to the grayscale image (B), one will be bemused to tem-\nporarily see the colors of the original image (P). Is this a proof\nthat one sees illusory hues the grayscale image does not have?\nNot necessarily. An alternative explanation is the following.\nWhile one stares at the negative image (S), the visual system\nadapts, that is, it becomes desensitized to S's color compo-\nnents. Then, when the gaze shifts to the grayscale image (B),\nS's colors are filtered off from B's colors. The grayscale\nimage (B) contains all color components in equal measure.As\nthe negative of a negative is the original, the original image\ncolors remain (P). Likewise, the complementary of the com-\nplementary of a color is the color itself. Thus, the grayscale\nimage (B) contains the original positive image (P), and one\nperceives P's colors thanks to localized RGB filtering. One\ndoes not see illusory colors that do not exist; rather, one sees\nP's colors inside B because S's color components are filtered\nofffromB's,andthusonlyP'scolorsremain.6 Computationally\n , yet physically A B\n .\nAs a further proof, consider the counterexample offered\nby the false-color background (BN). According to the oppo-\nnent model, the background ought not to affect the presence\nor color composition of an afterimage. Here, the empirical\nevidence shows the opposite--If BN is the background, no\nafterimage occurs (96%, Figure 3). The availability of colors\ninside the background is a necessary condition for the occur-\nrence of the afterimage. The proposed RGB filtering model\npredicts and explains why. In fact, BN's colors have been\nchosen so as to lack the color components required to com-\npose the hues of the original picture. As a result, the afterim-\nage does not occur, no matter previous adaptation, because\nsubtractive filtering cannot add any missing color (in this\ncase, A = BN - kS  A = BN). If the opponent model were\ncorrect, one would see the original colors against both back-\ngrounds (B and BN). This is not the case. One sees the origi-\nnal colors only against the grayscale background (B).\nExperiment 4: No Light, No Afterimages\nThe last experiment is the most informal and the one that has\nbeen carried on the smallest sample. However, its results\nhave been consistent with the proposed model. In brief, sup-\npose the subject stares at a red square patch in a dark pitch\nroom. All of a sudden, the stimulus disappears completely\nleaving the subject in pitch dark. Will the subject see any\ncomplementary afterimage floating over the pitch dark visual\nfield? According to the opponent model of afterimages, the\nsubject should see a green afterimage floating over the dark\nbackground. Yet, this does not happen. On the contrary, the\nsubject does not experience anything. At most, they experi-\nence the persistence of a positive red afterimage that under-\ngoes the usual hue shifting. However, the prevailing\nexperience is just pitch dark; no afterimage ensues.\nThe same lack of afterimage happens even with a white\nstimulus. Consider the popular Jesus negative silhouette\nTable 1. Standard Model Versus RGB Filtering: Experimental\nResults.\nStimulus Standard model Proposed model Empirical evidence\nRed Green Cyan Cyan (99%)\nGreen Red Magenta Magenta (95%)\nCyan Orange Red Red (91%)\nMagenta Yellowish green Green Green (79%)\nNote. The percentage expresses how many subjects were in agreement\nwith the proposed model.\n4 SAGE Open\n(Figure 4a). If one stares at it for 20 s and then stares at a\nwhite surface, one will see a positive silhouette of Jesus--\nthat is, the negative of negative. Once again, the catch is that\nthe background is a white surface: White surfaces and screens\ncontain all color components. Due to local adaptation, the\nvisual system filters off the most prominent components of\nthe stimulus inside a stimulus-shaped area and a positive\nJesus silhouette is seen.\nWhat if the background is pitch black? If the Jesus sil-\nhouette were a mental image concocted by the brain inside\nthe visual system, it might well occur against a pitch black\nbackground. But it does not. If the experiment is repeated\nusing a pitch dark background, the outcome was surpris-\ning--96% of subjects reported no complementary afterim-\nage (Table 4).\nThe suggested explanation is that an afterimage is the\ncarving resulting from subtracting locally selected color\ncomponents to the external world. If there is no color to be\nfiltered, as is the case with pitch black, nothing can be fil-\ntered out. Thus, nothing changes. By means of subtraction, a\ncolor that does not exist cannot be obtained.\nIt is worth noting that total absence of light is necessary\nfor the afterimage failure. If one repeats the above experi-\nment using a laptop, a computer screen, or even a printed\nblack square, one will likely afterimage something. The\nreason is that, in all such cases, the alleged black is not\npitch black. In normal conditions, sheets of paper and dark\npatches always reflect some residual light. When a com-\nputer screen displays a black picture, a faint glow always\nleaks out, and so forth. Therefore, an easy way to do the test\nproperly is to stare at the stimulus on screen, at night, in a\ncompletely dark room, and then switch off the screen. If the\nroom is completely dark, one will not see any complemen-\ntary afterimage.7\nMethod\nIn all experiments, off-the-shelf commercial LCDs were\nused at their maximum brightness. Occasionally, the test was\nperformed using a video projector Epson EH-TW5300.\nExperiments 1 to 3 were performed in dim-lit indoor envi-\nronments with all artificial lights switched off and the shades\nTable 2.

A few unaware color-blind subjects\nmight have participated in the experiment.\nIn all experiments, the RGB space was chosen because it\nis the most straightforward choice for off-the-shelf LCD\nscreens. Of course, the RGB space approximates the amount\nof light frequencies trichromatic retinas pick up from the\nexternal world through S, M, and L cones (Frey & von Kries,\nthe model, the RGB color is close enough to the actual physi-\ncal quantities stimulating the cone system of the retina.\nThe experimental setups do not require any sophisticated\ntechnology.

Negative images\n(Experiment 3) and colored backgrounds (Experiment 2) are\nconvincing cases. If afterimages were created inside the\nvisual system, the visual system would be able to create any\ncolor, regardless of the background. On the contrary, all find-\nings show that the background constrains what one afterim-\nages (Experiments 1, 2, and 3).\nThe collected data are consistent with the hypothesis that\nthe colors one afterimages exist inside the background.\nAdaptation tunes the visual system so that it picks up the\ncolor components present in the background selectively. In\nManzotti 7\nnormal circumstances, trichromats cannot see, say, the red\ninside a gray patch because it is masked by identical amounts\nof green and blue. However, if subjects were both blue and\ngreen blind because of adaptation, they would see the red\nhue. In fact, gray patches contain red which is neither illu-\nsory nor mental; it is as real as any color can be. Afterimages\nmight well be filtered perception, but are perceptions\nnonetheless.\nBackground Dependence (Experiment 2)\nTraditional afterimage reports employ surreptitiously two\nperceptual tricks that might have misled both researchers and\nlaypeople (see below). First, experimental setups exploit\nachromatic backgrounds. Second, subjects' gazes are kept\nfixed onto a predesigned region either by frames or by fixa-\ntion points. Together, these two conditions guarantee that the\nfiltering does not occur on any wrong part of the visual\nfield--Background dependence can thus be neglected. It is\nno accident that experimenters invite onlookers to experi-\nence afterimages only while staring at a white or gray back-\nground: \"against a neutral surface . . . A black background\nemphasis added); \"look at a sheet of white paper . . . viewed\nagainst a white background . . . shift your eyes to the white\nadded); \"hovering against that gray background\"\nsmall, not-too-bright achromatic surface\" (Hurvich, 1981,\n(Byrne & Hilbert, 2003, p. 5, emphasis added); \"looking at a\n\"look at a blank sheet of white paper. You should see against\nadded); \"stare at the white disc\" (Gage, 1999, emphasis\nadded). Asking the subject to afterimage against an achro-\nmatic--white or gray--background is a perceptual sleight of\nhand. By imposing an achromatic and homogeneous back-\nground, experimenters discreetly smuggled the complete\ncolor palette.\nIn the past, color models addressed the dependence from\nWalraven, 1982); a fact that has been noticed since von\nHelmholtz's work. Such studies have stressed the influence\nof the background (and of the context) in terms of a two-\nstage model of color perception. However, this article\nfocuses on the role of background as regards negative after-\nimages rather than as a tuning factor in color perception.\nMoreover, such studies consider the influence of the sur-\nrounding background rather than the background that ensues\nthe stimulus perception. The point here is that the perceived\nafterimage colors are a subset of the background.\nNo Light, No Afterimage (Experiments 2 and 3)\nIf complementary afterimages are cases in which one sees\nexisting colors, one will not ever afterimage colors that are\nnot contained inside the background (Experiments 2 and 3).\nOne can only filter off color components; one cannot add\nany. Suppose one stares at a red stimulus. Due to color adap-\ntation, one becomes red blind. If one then stares at a white\nbackground, one will see the remaining hues, which are blue\nand green. Blue and green together make cyan. Thus, one\nwill see cyan. However, if one stares at a cyan background\n(green or blue), no red will be available to be filtered off.\nThen, as the proposed model predicts, no afterimage will\nensue. Cyan minus red is still cyan.\nShortcomings of the Notion of Complementary\nColor (Experiments 1, 2, and 3)\nAs regards afterimages, no a priori color space (Hering's,\nMaxwell's) can predict the right color one will afterimage\nfollowing a given stimulus, because what one afterimages\ndepends both on the stimulus and on the background. The\ntraditional notion that \"the hue of an after-image is deter-\nmined solely by the hue of the stimulus color\" (Wilson &\nby many, not last by von Helmholtz himself and others\nThus, the standard claim that one sees the complementary\ncolor of the stimulus is conceptually insufficient because it\nassumes that the afterimage color is a function of the stimu-\nlus color only. As is shown by data (see Figure 2, and Tables\n1 and 3), given a stimulus, many possible afterimage colors\ncan follow depending on the background color. As the color\none afterimages depend on both the stimulus and the back-\nground, given a hue, there is no unique complementary color.\nConclusion\nThe entry way of the article has been a ubiquitous mistake\nin afterimage reports--that is, the belief that a red stimulus\nresults in a green afterimage. On an achromatic surface, a\nred stimulus yields a cyan afterimage, and a green stimulus\nyields a magenta afterimage. The red\u00adgreen mistake is\nimpressive in that it has been made not only by laypeople\nbut by color scientists and perception philosophers as well\nIt is a remarkable error, because it has biased the way in\nwhich stimuli have been devised and outcomes have been\ninterpreted without anyone noticing the discrepancy.\nGenerations of college students have been trained to\nbelieve into a wrong notion. To demonstrate just how per-\nvasive and deeply entrenched the red\u00adgreen confusion has\nbecome in both scientific and philosophical accounts, a\nbrief survey of the available literature regarding afterim-\nages has been gathered (Table 5)--All reported statements\n8 SAGE Open\nare empirically wrong. The mistake is so pervasive that\nafterimage stimuli have been systematically drawn with\nthe wrong colors even in the most popular cases (Figure 6a\nand 6b). A green/yellow American flag does not produce a\nred/blue flag, but a magenta/blue one. Excellent textbooks\nare not immune.\nIn sum, the standard afterimage model survived unchal-\nlenged because reports have been biased both by the notion of\n\"mental\" colors and by the widespread use of Hering's oppo-\nnent color system. However, complementary afterimages are\nneither hallucinations, nor mental images, nor mental colors--\nThey are not additions to the world one sees. Afterimages are\na case of perception in which one perceives a subset of the\ncolors available in the external world in a stimulus-shaped\nlocal area. Complementary afterimages are not illusory oppo-\nnent hues but localized RGB filtered perception.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1. The expression \"negative afterimage\" is henceforth set aside\nbecause it might lead to confusion--for example, afterimages\nof negative images.\n2. The RGB space has been adopted because, albeit it is device\ndependent, it gives a rough estimate of the amount of light emit-\nted in three different bandwidths. Moreover, as shown by the\ncollected evidence, the results are consistent among different\ndevices. Yet, it would surely be interesting to test the proposed\nmodel against more precise colorimetric standards.\n3. A caveat. In the following, I will often use the word \"afterim-\nage\" as a verb rather than as a noun. I am aware this is not the\nstandard use. In fact, one of the points of the article is that after-\nimages are not visual objects but an alteration in the way one\nperceives colors--thus, \"afterimaging\" is \"perceiving colors in\na different way because of chromatic adaptation\" rather than\n\"seeing an afterimage.\"\n4. More exactly, the above is a\nI\n= Max (b\ni\n- k\u00b7s\ni\n, 0), where A = (a\n,\na\n, a\n), B = (b\n, b\n, b\n), S = (s\n, s\n, s\n).\nTable 5.
