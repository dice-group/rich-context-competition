    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe perception of job insecurity is known to be a stressful condition for employees. Less is known about employment\ninsecurity and the ways employees and their families deal with it. This study investigates whether participation in further\ntraining is a strategy that employees adopt to reduce perceived employment insecurity. As participation in further training is\noften costly and time-consuming, we assume that the family context is of importance for the decision to take part in further\ntraining. To take account of possible self-selection, we apply a propensity score matching procedure on longitudinal data\nfrom the Swiss Household Panel (2004-2013). Three main findings can be emphasized: first, participation in further training\nis not a strategy adopted particularly by employees who perceive high employment insecurity as they are less likely to train\nthan their secure counterparts. Second, even though further training is not a strategy that is actively adopted, employees\nwho train subsequently report lower levels of perceived employment insecurity. Third, the family context indeed influences\nthe likelihood to train: partnered employees are more likely to train and preschool-aged children act as a constraint on\nwomen's but enhance men's participation in further training. Yet, in the context of high perceived employment insecurity,\nchildren generally reduce their parents' likelihood to train as the parents may turn to other strategies that reduce perceived\nemployment insecurity.\n",

Hence, they experience a\nlack of controllability and predictability leading to a high bur-\nden as they are in the dark about their future (De Witte, 2005).\nThe sources of job insecurity are multiple (Greenhalgh &\nRosenblatt, 1984), and at the outset there are often objective\ntriggers such as mergers, downsizings, or the implementation\nof new technologies (Ashford, Lee, & Bobko, 1989). Yet job\ninsecurity also comprises a subjective dimension that is based\non the employee's interpretation of the situation. Some cir-\ncumstances may be unstable, but an employee can still feel\nsecure. Vice versa, the circumstances may be stable according\nto some objective criteria but the employee feels insecure as a\nresult of his/her interpretation of the situation (De Witte,\n2005). It is common to distinguish between cognitive and\naffective job insecurity. The former concerns the perception\nof the risk of losing one's job (Huang, Lee, Ashford, Chen, &\nRen, 2010). The latter refers to the emotional reaction to the\nperceived risk such as being worried or anxious (Pienaar, De\nWitte, Hellgren, & Sverke, 2013). Although high affective\njob insecurity often is a consequence of high cognitive job\ninsecurity (Huang et al., 2010), some employees are only\nlittle worried because they perceive good labor market pros-\npects (Chung & van Oorschot, 2011). Therefore, some\nscholars use the concept of employment insecurity: Even\nthough an employee may perceive high job insecurity (i.e.,\na high risk of losing the current job), he or she may be con-\nfident to remain in paid work but with another job and/or\nemployer (Chung & van Oorschot, 2011; Dixon, Fullerton,\nperceives a low level of employment insecurity despite high\nperceived job insecurity.\n1FORS, Switzerland\nCorresponding Author:\nFlorence Lebert, FORS Swiss Centre of Expertise in the Social Sciences,\nUniversity of Lausanne, Geopolis, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.\nEmail: florence.lebert@fors.unil.ch\nReducing Employment Insecurity:\nFurther Training and the Role of the\nFamily Context\nFlorence Lebert1 and Erika Antal1\n Keywords\nemployment insecurity, further training, family, propensity score matching, Switzerland\n2 SAGE Open\nThroughout this study we refer to the subjective dimen-\nsion of insecurity unless otherwise indicated. When using the\nterm of perceived job insecurity, we mean the perceived risk\nof losing the current job. In contrast we use the term of\nemployment insecurity when referring to employees who\nperceive a high risk of becoming unemployed which means\nthat they not only perceive a threat to their current job but\nalso lack confidence to find other (equivalent) employment.\nResearch on job and employment insecurity has shown\nthat the insecurity reduces physical and mental well-being\n(Sverke et al., 2002; Virtanen, Vahtera, Kivim\u00e4ki, Pentti, &\nFerrie, 2002). For job insecurity it has also been demon-\nstrated that it influences work attitudes and performance\nsome strands of research have considered coping strategies\nin psychological terms such as cognitive reappraisal or self-\nblame (e.g., Jordan, Ashkanasy, & Hartel, 2002; Mantler,\nMatejicek, Matheson, & Anisman, 2005), little attention has\nbeen paid to the practical actions that individuals may take to\nreduce insecurity (Cheng, Mauno, & Lee, 2014; Kalleberg,\n2009). We aim to fill this gap by examining one strategy that\nemployees may adopt: participation in further training. We\nassume that through investment in one's human capital job\nand employment, insecurity can be reduced. On the one\nhand, further training helps keeping one's skills up to date\nand therefore protects from dismissal (Lang, 2012). Hence,\nfurther training is supposed to reduce perceived job insecu-\nrity. On the other hand, it also helps in the case of job loss as\nit may increase the individual's employability and avoid\nexperiencing unemployment (Smith, 2010). Thus, we assume\nthat participation in further training also decreases perceived\nemployment insecurity. In the present study, we approach\nfurther training as training and learning activities that take\nplace on or off the job (Fleischhauer, 2007) but do not lead to\nan officially recognized diploma (Swiss Federal Statistical\nOffice [FSO], 2010). These activities (e.g., IT, management,\nor language courses [FSO, 2010]) can be supported by the\nemployer (financially, time-based, or by allowing flexibility)\nor born entirely by the employee (FSO, 2014).\nPrevious research has shown that participation in further\ntraining is highly selective and widely depends on individual\nand work-related factors (see, for example, Albert, Garc\u00eda-\nless explored, also family-related factors such as the pres-\nence of a partner, children, or economic hardship can be\nassumed to influence the individual's probability to train\nbe expensive and time-consuming and therefore less attrac-\ntive to some employees because of their family responsibili-\nties. The present study takes this selectivity into account by\nconsidering the family context and applying a propensity\nscore matching (PSM) procedure. We answer three ques-\ntions: First, do employees who perceive high employment\ninsecurity increase their participation in further training?\nSecond, does the family context (i.e., the presence of a\npartner, preschool-aged children, and economic hardship)\ninfluence the employee's likelihood to train, and third, does\nparticipation in further training lead to a subsequent decrease\nin perceived employment insecurity?\nState of the Research\nThe Influence of Further Training on Perceived\nJob Insecurity and Unemployment\nA few studies have investigated whether participation in fur-\nther training decreases job insecurity. Further training is\nexpected to increase the employee's human capital and there-\nfore his/her employability which subsequently reduces feel-\nings of job insecurity (Kohlrausch & Rasner, 2014; Lang,\ntraining was indeed related to lower levels of perceived job\ninsecurity. In contrast, Elman and O'Rand (2002) did not\nfind such an effect. However, in longitudinal studies, further\ntraining was identified as reducing perceived job insecurity\nIn a study from Germany, older employees benefited most\nfrom further training to decrease their perceived job insecu-\nrity (Lang, 2012). However, the effect was only found for\nemployees who irregularly participated in further training\nand employees who indicated that they participated in fur-\nther training to adjust their skills to new demands in the cur-\nrent job (Lang, 2012). In general, older as well as low-skilled\nemployees seem to benefit most from further training\nnot only a short-term but also a long-term effect from further\ntraining in reducing perceived job insecurity (Kohlrausch &\nConcerning unemployment, Dieckhoff (2007) showed\nthat further training reduced the risk of unemployment and\nincreased the probability of exiting from unemployment in\nGermany. In Switzerland, further training is one measure of\nits active labor market policy. However, it had a modest\nimpact on pushing individuals out of unemployment (Gerfin\nMost of the studies that evaluated the impact of further\ntraining focused on objective states such as unemployment\njob (in)security (e.g., Kohlrausch & Rasner, 2014; Lang,\n2012). Hardly anything is known about the effect of further\ntraining on perceived employment insecurity (Chung & van\nEmpirical Evidence for Determinants of\nParticipation in Further Training\nAs it will become apparent in this section, participation in\nfurther training is not randomly distributed in the population\nbut highly selective. Individual, work-, and family-related\nfactors influence an individual's likelihood to train.\nLebert and Antal 3\nConcerning the influence of perceived job and employ-\nment insecurity on participation in further training, only little\nevidence is available. Whereas some studies did not find an\nassociation between perceived job insecurity and the proba-\nincreased participation of employees perceiving high job\ninsecurity. Furthermore, employees with a fixed-term con-\ntract were less likely to participate compared with permanent\nemployees (Arulampalam, Booth, & Bryan, 2004; Kyndt &\nBaert, 2013). Presumably, those with a fixed-term contract\ngot less support from their employers as the payback period\nSupervisors were more likely to participate than operators\nrequire more skills: not only did supervisors need sound\nexpertise, but they also had to acquire leader skills (Green,\n1993). Concerning employees who recently joined an orga-\nnization, one would expect that they had higher probabilities\nto train as they may have to acquire new skills to accomplish\ntheir new tasks (Green, 1993). However, mixed findings\nwere reported, with some indicating lower probabilities for\nemployees with low tenure, while others finding higher\nprobabilities or no significant results (Albert et al., 2010;\nGaravan, Carbery, O'Malley, & O'Donnell, 2010; Green,\nreported for workload. Arulampalam et al. (2004) did not\nfind lower probabilities for part-time workers in a series of\nEuropean countries. However, Swiss (FSO, 2014) and Dutch\n(Nelen & de Grip, 2009) data showed that employees with\nhigher workload were also more likely to participate in fur-\nther training. The higher the involvement in paid work, the\nhigher the payback time and the more profitable the training\n(Leuven & Oosterbeek, 1999). In addition, employees work-\ning for companies that were undergoing downsizing or merg-\ners were more likely to participate in further training (Carbery\ncase of such restructuring processes, insecurity is high so\nemployees engage in strategies to increase their employabil-\nity (Cavanaugh & Noe, 1999). On the other hand, in the pro-\ncess of restructuring, employees may take over new tasks\nand responsibilities that they need to be trained for (Parker,\nChmiel, & Wall, 1997). Findings also indicated that further\ntraining was more likely in large firms (FSO, 2014; Knoke &\nKalleberg, 1994). In comparison with small firms, they tend\nto take a greater risk to train employees who have a lower\nprobability of recouping investment outlays (Harris, 1999).\nLarge companies also have a wider time horizon and a larger\ninternal market with better chances to benefit from training\ninvestments, and they have more possibilities to internally\norganize further training (Harris, 1999). Participation in fur-\nther training was also more likely in the public sector\nzations do not have the primary aim of profit-maximization,\nprivate organizations widely do. Fearing poaching, private\norganizations may refrain more from investing in the further\ntraining of their employees (Green, 1993). Employees work-\ning in occupations with continuing advancement (e.g., infor-\nmation technology or media) have a high risk of skill\nobsolescence (Smith, 2010). Therefore, these employees are\nconstantly urged to train to keep up with technological\nchanges. Employees in occupations in the banking and insur-\nance sector or in health and social care were also identified as\nAlong with these work-related factors, business cycles\npresumably also influence individuals' behavior on the labor\nmarket. When unemployment rates are high, competition for\njobs increases (Dieckhoff, 2007). To stay competitive,\nemployees need to develop and keep their skills up to date.\nHowever, to our knowledge nothing is known about the\ninfluence of unemployment rates on the likelihood to train.\nThe literature has also documented the influence of indi-\nvidual factors on the employees' likelihood to train.\nAccording to the human capital approach, women are less\nlikely to participate in further training as they have more dis-\nruptive careers and higher turnover rates which reduce the\npayback period and make further training less attractive to\nboth the women and employers (Simpson & Stroh, 2002).\nHowever, empirical results about gender differences in par-\nticipation rates were mixed (Kyndt & Baert, 2013). Whereas\nfor instance Lang (2012) did not find a difference between\nmen and women, Elman and O'Rand (2002) found women to\nbe somewhat more likely to train. Swiss data showed that,\ndue to their higher rates of participation in paid work, men\nwere also more likely than women to participate in further\nThe payback period is also shorter for older employees.\nAge indeed tended to be negatively related to participation in\nthat the lower participation rate of older workers was not the\nresult of individual preferences but of employer decisions.\nMoreover, employees with a low educational level had the\nlowest probability of participating in further training (Albert\nYet, due to their weak position on the labor market, employ-\nees with a low education level are most in need of further\ntraining to increase their competitiveness (Dieckhoff, 2007).\nAmong the individual factors that influence participation\nin further training, impaired health was identified as a con-\nstraint for further training as training requires high personal\ninvestment and energy levels (Sussman, 2002).\nSome studies did also consider family factors for the\nemployee's likelihood to train. The presence of a partner is\nsupposed to positively impact on the employee's probability\nto train due to his/her support and children may function as\nboth, a resource or a constraint, depending on the employee's\nfamily role (Greenhaus & Powell, 2012; Maurer, Weiss, &\nBarbeite, 2003). Previous research found evidence for the\npresence of young children to reduce participation in further\n4 SAGE Open\ntrast, findings for partner status were less clear: Elman and\nO'Rand (2002) did not find an influence of marital status on\nparticipation rates. In contrast, Harris (1999) identified single\nmen, and Green (1993) married women, as less likely to par-\nticipate. Furthermore, the economic situation of the house-\nhold turned out to influence an individual's likelihood to\ntrain: Sussman (2002) showed that financial issues came into\naccount for 40% of Canadian employees reporting that they\ndid not participate in further training because of the high\nexpense. In the case of Switzerland, the training costs may be\nan issue as only around 30% of employees received training\nthat was financially supported by their employer (FSO, 2014).\nHowever, these studies did not show whether the family-\nrelated factors functioned as a resource or a constraint in the\ncontext of high perceived employment insecurity. Therefore,\nwe will address this issue in the present study.\nAn Unresolved Issue\nThe literature review demonstrated that participation in fur-\nther training is highly selective, and it becomes apparent that\nthere are conflicting results concerning the determinants of\nparticipation in further training (i.e., the perceived level of job\ninsecurity, tenure, workload, partner status, and gender). The\nself-selection into further training may lead to biased esti-\nmates for the effect of further training on perceived job inse-\ncurity. Although less investigated, family-related factors such\nas children, the partner, or the financial situation of the house-\nhold were identified as important predictors of an individual's\nprobability to train. Yet the family context may not only con-\ntribute to the observed selectivity for participation in further\ntraining but also moderate the relationship between perceived\nemployment insecurity and participation in further training.\nIn the next chapter we will discuss our expectations in detail.\nFurthermore, we have shown that previous research\nmainly focused on unemployment and perceived job insecu-\nrity, and little is known about the impact of further training\non perceived employment insecurity. It should be considered\nthat participation in further training may not prevent the loss\nof the current job, but it may nevertheless increase employ-\nability which is assumed to reduce perceived employment\ninsecurity. Chung and van Oorschot (2011) have shown that\nemployees in countries with high expenditure on active labor\nmarket policies (such as further training) perceive lower lev-\nels of employment insecurity. However, it is not possible to\ndeduce from this study whether participation in further train-\ning measured on the individual level impacts on perceived\nemployment insecurity.\nMoreover, nothing is known about the effect of further\ntraining on the perception of insecurity in Switzerland.\nPresumably, due to comparatively low levels of unemploy-\nment and high productivity (Organization for Economic\nCo-operation and Development [OECD], 2013), employees in\nSwitzerland report comparatively low levels of employment\ninsecurity (Mau, Mewes, & Sch\u00f6neck, 2012). However,\nSwitzerland has a weak employment protection (Straubhaar &\nWerner, 2003): Every employee can be dismissed with a notice\nof 1 to 3 months (depending on the duration of service).\nTherefore, every employment has some degree of inherent\ninsecurity and every employee may suddenly have to compete\non the labor market to find new employment. In the context of\nweak employment protection, keeping one's skills up to date is\ncrucial. The share of companies based in Switzerland that sup-\nport their employees' training activities is one of the highest\namong the European countries (FSO, 2014). Yet, on an indi-\nvidual level, participation rates within these supporting com-\npanies are below average which emphasizes the selectivity of\nparticipation (FSO, 2014). Furthermore, Gerfin and Lechner\ning has a rather weak impact on the individuals' chances to\nfind a way out of unemployment. Therefore, it may be of inter-\nest to policy makers to understand whether further training has\nan impact on the subjective dimension of insecurity.\nTo address the mentioned shortcomings, we use Swiss\nlongitudinal data from the Swiss Household Panel (SHP) and\napply a PSM procedure to investigate whether participation\nin further training subsequently decreases perceived employ-\nment insecurity when accounting for the family context.\nTheoretical Perspectives\nParticipation in Further Training as a Strategy to\nReduce Perceived Employment Insecurity\nIn what follows, we will focus on perceived employment\ninsecurity, that is employees who do not only see their cur-\nrent job as insecure but also evaluate their labor market pros-\npects as weak and therefore perceive a high risk of becoming\nunemployed in the near future (Anderson & Pontusson,\nAn individual who experiences a discrepancy between the\ndesired and the actual level of employment security engages\nin behavior aimed at a reduction of the perceived insecurity.\nOne possible strategy is investment in human capital by par-\nticipating in further training (Kyndt & Baert, 2013).According\nto Schwarzer and Taubert (2002), this strategy can be consid-\nered anticipatory or preventive. If the occurrence of job loss\nis a fairly certain event, participation in further training is\nanticipatory and directed toward better coping with the\nimpending event. If the threat of job loss is less acute and its\noccurrence less likely, participation in further training can be\nconsidered a preventive strategy that mainly aims at reducing\nthe risk of the event actually occurring. According to the\nhuman capital approach, further training is a means to embed\nresources in employees (Becker, 1962). Therefore, we assume\nthat participation in further training is one strategy that\nemployees who feel insecure adopt: keeping one's skills up to\ndate offers protection from dismissal and increases employ-\nLebert and Antal 5\nHypothesis 1: The higher the perceived employment inse-\ncurity, the more likely participation in further training.\nFamily-Related Factors Influencing Participation in\nFurther Training\nIn this study, we put particular stress on family-related fac-\ntors as they often receive little attention although they influ-\nence decisions in the work domain. Greenhaus and Powell\n(2012) refer to this as the family-relatedness of work deci-\nsions, that is the extent to which demands and responsibili-\nties in the family domain affect decisions in the work domain.\nWe consider three family-related factors as influencing an\nemployee's probability of engaging in further training. First\nis the partner status, second the presence of preschool-aged\nchildren, and third the economic situation of the household.\nOn the one hand, singles (if they do not have children or\nother important family responsibilities) are free in their use\nof time as they do not have to conciliate their own activities\nwith those of a partner (Burchardt, 2010). On the other hand,\nthey are restricted in sharing duties such as securing an\nincome, keeping house, or organizational and administrative\ntasks. In contrast, individuals with a partner are less free in\ntheir time use because they need to consider their partner's\nshown that partnered individuals nevertheless have more\ntime at their free disposal when income (i.e., the possibility\nto purchase goods and services) is considered. Partnered\nindividuals generally also have higher social capital\nduties and provide support for each other. For participation\nin further training, this can mean that the partner provides\nemotional support by encouraging participation, and practi-\ncal support by making some time available to the other part-\nner to invest in further training (e.g., by taking over household\nchores, taking care of the children) or providing information\nand assistance (Maurer et al., 2003; Verbakel & de Graaf,\n2009). Therefore, we consider a partner to be a resource, and\nformulate the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 2: Partnered employees are more likely to\nparticipate in further training than employees without a\npartner (direct effect).\nWe furthermore expect that the partner is particularly\nlikely to function as a resource if support is de facto needed\n(Cohen & McKay, 1984), that is if an employee perceives\nhigh employment insecurity. In that case, the partner can be\nsupportive and actively help engaging in strategies such as\nfurther training. Therefore, we assume partnered employees\nto be even more likely to participate in further training if they\nperceive high levels of employment insecurity:\nHypothesis 3: Having a partner moderates the relation-\nship between perceived employment insecurity and\nfurther training (interaction). Partnered employees are\nexpected to be more likely to train when perceiving high\nemployment insecurity compared with insecure employ-\nees without a partner.\nPreschool-aged children are assumed to inhibit the prob-\nability of an individual to participate in further training when\nhe or she has high responsibilities in family work. Individuals\nhighly involved in family work have less time available, are\ndependent on external child care provision, and therefore\nless flexible in their time management (Burchardt, 2010;\nCrouter, 1984). Paid and unpaid work--and it is particularly\nthe case in Switzerland--are usually not equally distributed\nin couples (Baumgartner, 2008): In most households, women\ntake over the lion's share of childcare activities whereas men\nhave the main responsibility for the financial well-being of\nthe family. According to Greenhaus and Powell (2012), work\ndecisions are highly influenced by the individual's work and\nfamily roles. Accordingly, women are expected to take deci-\nsions that ensure the care and emotional well-being of the\nchildren, whereas men tend to take decisions that increase\ntheir employability and ultimately the family's financial\nresources. As a consequence of lower time resources and\ntheir family role, women are expected to be less likely to\ntrain when they have preschool-aged children. In contrast,\nmen are expected to be more likely to train when they have\npreschool-aged children, as further training increases their\nemployability and subsequently may enhance the family's\nfinancial resources (Chan & Auster, 2003):\nHypothesis 4: Women living with preschool-aged children\nare less likely to participate in further training than women\nnot living with preschool-aged children whereas men liv-\ning with preschool-aged children are more likely to partici-\npate than men not living with preschool-aged children.\nIn the face of perceived employment insecurity, we\nbelieve children to function as an incentive for their parents\nto secure a stable financial situation for the family. Nolan\n(2009) has demonstrated that parents would accept scaling\ndown their standard of living in case of job loss if it was only\nfor them, but they do not want it for their children. Therefore,\nwe expect insecure individuals with children to be more\nlikely to participate in further training as a strategy to reduce\nperceived employment insecurity. The constraint of pre-\nschool-aged children on their mothers' participation in fur-\nther training is expected to disappear in the context of high\nperceived employment insecurity.\nHypothesis 5: Individuals (men and women) with pre-\nschool-aged children who perceive high employment\ninsecurity are more likely to participate in further train-\ning compared with insecure individuals without pre-\nschool-aged children. The effect of gender is expected to\ndisappear.\n6 SAGE Open\nFurthermore, employees who experience economic hard-\nship are assumed to be less likely to participate in further\ntraining because they cannot afford the tuition fees, addi-\ntional arising expenses, and opportunity costs (Sussman,\nage for their participation in further training (tuition fees and\nHypothesis 6: Employees with economic hardship are\nless likely to participate in further training compared\nwith employees without economic hardship (direct\neffect).\nEmployees who perceive high levels of employment\ninsecurity are most in need of strategies to increase their\nemployability, even more so if they already face economic\nhardship. However, we assume that these employees can-\nnot afford the expenses related to further training\n(Sussman, 2002). Therefore, employees who experience\nboth employment insecurity and economic hardship may\nturn to other strategies and be less likely to participate in\nfurther training compared with individuals who perceive\nhigh employment insecurity but do not experience eco-\nnomic hardship.\nHypothesis 7: Economic hardship moderates the rela-\ntionship between employment insecurity and further\ntraining. Employees with economic hardship and high\nperceived employment insecurity are less likely to partici-\npate in further training compared with insecure employ-\nees without economic hardship (interaction).\nThe Consequences of Further Training for\nPerceived Employment Insecurity\nSumming up, we have argued that participation in further\ntraining is a strategy that employees who feel insecure adopt\nto reduce their employment insecurity and that the decision\nto train is influenced by the family context. Yet, research has\nshown that participation in further training is also highly\ninfluenced by the support of the employer (Kyndt & Baert,\n2013): If the training activities of the employees are benefi-\ncial for the company, employers may support them (Mincer,\n1989). A high share of companies encourage and support\nemployees in their training activities by bearing (part of) the\ncosts and/or time investments (FSO, 2010) or by valuing and\nencouraging participation and offering flexibility for training\nactivities (Kyndt & Baert, 2013). Although employer-sup-\nported further training may be firm-specific and therefore not\nnecessarily relevant for a future job with a new employer\n(Mincer, 1989), the employee who received support of the\nemployer for his/her training activities can derive some\ndegree of job security as the investment is only cost-effective\nfor the employer if the trained employee is retained in the\ncompany after the acquisition of the new skills and\nknowledge (Fleischhauer, 2007). If further training (whether\nemployer-supported or not) is transferable to other compa-\nnies, it is assumed to increase employability and reduce per-\nceived employment insecurity (Mincer, 1989). On the one\nhand, the employee may protect his/her current job through\nthe increased skills and knowledge, and on the other hand,\nhe/she may gain in competitiveness and confidence in find-\ning new (equivalent) employment if job loss occurs (Becker,\nHypothesis 8: Participation in further training reduces\nperceived employment insecurity.\nThe perception of employment insecurity does not only\ndepend on one's employability and training activities but\non a series of individual, work-, and family-related factors.\nFor this we refer to the existing literature. The following\nfactors are concerned and will be considered in the empiri-\ncal section: type of contract and size of the company, posi-\ntion within a company and recent change of employer,\nworkload, public versus private sector, industrial sector as\nwell as unemployment rates (Anderson & Pontusson,\nIn addition to the work-related factors, some family-\nrelated and individual factors are concerned: being partnered,\nhaving children and experiencing economic hardship, health\nstatus, gender, age, and educational level (Anderson &\nData and Method\nData\na longitudinal household study that repeatedly surveys a\ngeneral sample of the Swiss population by means of stan-\ndardized computer-assisted telephone interviews.

To control for the type of contract, we dis-\ntinguished between employees with a permanent, a fixed-\nterm, and an unspecified type of contract.\nPosition.To determine the individual's position within the\ncompany, the respondents were asked whether the supervi-\nsion of other employees was an official part of their job. If this\nwas the case, the respondents were coded 1, and 0 otherwise.\nChange of employer.As the change of employer was mea-\nsured at time t-1\n, it was assured that the change of employer\ntook place before the potential participation in further\ntraining.\nWorkload.According to the Swiss Federal Statistical Office\n(FSO, 2013), the respondents were regrouped into three cat-\negories: low workload with a percentage below 50 (in refer-\nence to a full-time job in the concerned company), medium\nOngoing reorganization. The respondents were asked whether\ntheir company was currently undergoing some form of reor-\nganization, restructuring, or privatization. As for a relatively\nhigh share of respondents the information was not collected,\nan unknown category was added to avoid further dropout due\nto partial non-response.\nFirm size. The size of the firm was measured with three cat-\negories: small firms with 1 to 24 employees, medium firms\nees or more.\nSector.Respondents who worked for a public organization\nwere coded 0, respondents working for a private organiza-\ntion were coded 1.\nOccupation. To assess the employee's occupation, the Inter-\nnational Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) was\nused (Ganzeboom & Treiman, 1996). As only few observa-\ntions were in the armed forces, these respondents were\nregrouped together with a residual group for whom no ISCO\ncode was available.\nRegional unemployment rates.We used the regional unem-\nployment rates for the major regions of Switzerland (Lake\nGeneva, Middleland, North-west Switzerland, Zurich, East\nSwitzerland, Central Switzerland and Ticino) provided by\nthe Swiss Federal Statistical Office. Unemployment rates\nwere assessed for the region of residence of the\nrespondents.\nPartner.The partner status was measured with a dummy\nvariable coded 1 for respondents with a partner.\nPreschool-aged children. We distinguished between individu-\nals living with preschool-aged children (younger than 7 years\nof age) in the household (coded 1) and individuals without\npreschool-aged children coded 0.\nEconomic hardship. It was based on a subjective evaluation of\nthe household's financial situation and measured with the\nfollowing question: \"How do you manage on your house-\nhold's current income, 0 means with great difficulty and 10\nvery easily?\" As the variable was reverse coded, a high value\nstands for great difficulties.\nEducational level. For the educational level, three categories\nwere used: low level, which corresponded to lower second-\nary education; medium level for upper secondary education;\nand high level for tertiary education.\n8 SAGE Open\nTable 1.

Those who responded that they felt \"well\" or \"very\nwell\" were considered to be in good health and coded 0; oth-\nerwise they were coded 1 (\"so, so,\" \"not very well,\" or \"not\nwell at all\").\nWe further included age, gender as well as year-dummies\nto control for period effects.\nMethods\nWe used a PSM procedure developed by Rosenbaum and\nRubin (1983). This method is employed to estimate causal\ntreatment effects, and especially to evaluate labor market\npolicies. As one of the foci of this study is the evaluation of\nthe effect of participation in further training on the level of\nperceived employment insecurity, the PSM is a well-adapted\nmethod. An important strength of the PSM is its ability to\naccount for the self-selection into treatment and therefore to\nreduce a potential bias due to unobserved heterogeneity\n(Caliendo & Kopeinig, 2008). Furthermore, the PSM does\nnot require functional assumptions.\nIdeally, a change of perceived employment insecurity\nshould be measured on the same individual when he/she has\nparticipated in training versus when he/she has not:\ni i i\n= ( ) ( )\neffi\nis the theoretical change for person i, Yi\n(1) is the level of\nperceived employment insecurity of person i when he/she has\nparticipated in further training and Yi\n(0) when he/she has not.\nAs these outcomes cannot be observed both on the same indi-\nvidual at the same time, the unobserved values (counterfac-\ntual outcomes) are approximated by the mean value of\nnon-participants. As participants and non-participants differ\nalso in other characteristics (X variables), this approximation\nmay cause a selection bias. The basic idea of the matching\napproach is to find the individuals among non-participants\n(control group) who are the most similar to the participants\n(treatment group) in all relevant pre-treatment characteristics.\nTo achieve this goal, balancing scores (functions of relevant X\nvariables so that the conditional distributions of these vari-\nables are independent of the assignment into treatment) are\napplied. These balancing scores (propensity scores) are the\nprobabilities of participation in further training given observed\nX variables (Caliendo & Kopeinig, 2008). In a usual proce-\ndure of estimation applying the PSM, first the propensity\nscores are computed and then the matching procedure is\nbased on these scores. Finally, the estimation of the treatment\neffect is evaluated on the so-called common support (overlap\nof the propensity scores of the treatment and the control\ngroup). The structure of the PSM is the following (Caliendo\n& Kopeinig, 2008): the parameter to be estimated is\nATT\n= =\n( )= ( ) =\n\n \n\n( ) =\n\n \n\n| |\n| ,\n-\nusing the propensity scores P(X)\nATT\nPSM\n= ( ) = ( )\n\n \n-\n( ) = ( )\n( ) =\n|\n( | ,\n| ,\n\n\n \n),\nwhere eff is the effect to be estimated, T is the binary variable\nfor the treatment (T = 1 if the person has participated in fur-\nther training and T = 0 if not) and ATT is the average treat-\nment effect on the treated, that is the effect of participation in\nfurther training on the level of perceived employment inse-\ncurity for the persons who effectively participated in the\ntraining.\nAs the treatment variable is binary, a logit model with rele-\nvant independent variables was adequate for estimating the pro-\npensity scores. Concerning the matching method applied, we\ntested several methods such as the nearest neighbor, caliper,\nradius, kernel, and local linear regression methods. For a com-\nprehensive introduction to the PSM see Caliendo and Kopeinig\n(2008). After comparing the matching qualities of these algo-\nrithms applied on our data set, we opted to use the kernel algo-\nrithm. This choice was not only based on the analytical results\nbut also on the theoretical properties: the kernel algorithm is a\nnon-parametric matching method that can be seen as a weighted\nregression (Smith &Todd, 2005), as it uses weighted averages of\nall individuals in the control group to construct the counterfac-\ntual outcome. The main advantage of this method is that more\ninformation is used and as a consequence the variance is reduced\nand the results are more robust (Caliendo & Kopeinig, 2008).\nThe estimation of the effect of participation in further\ntraining on the level of perceived employment insecurity\nwas then evaluated on the matched sample using ordinary\nleast squares (OLS) regression. The variable of interest was\nthe difference in the level of perceived employment insecu-\nrity measured on the same individual at time t0\n.\nConcerning the included independent variables, the same\nvariables as for the estimation of the propensity scores were\nused for time t-1\n(lagged variables). To test the presence of\nmoderating effects as assumed with Hypotheses 3, 4, 5, and\n7, we constructed interaction terms by multiplying the\nconcerned variables (Male \u00d7 Preschool-Aged Child;\nEmployment Insecurity (EI) \u00d7 Partner; EI \u00d7 Preschool-\nAged Child; EI \u00d7 Economic Hardship; EI \u00d7 Male; EI \u00d7\nMale \u00d7 Preschool-Aged Child).\nAs only the values of two consecutive years were con-\ncerned, we used cross-sectional individual weights. Finally,\nto deal with problems about normality, heteroscedasticity,\nlarge residuals, and high leverage points, we computed\nrobust standard errors of the coefficients.\nResults\nWe started with the logistic regression to calculate the propen-\nsity scores. In a first step, we included all the relevant vari-\nables and the interaction term Male \u00d7 Preschool-Aged Child to\ntest Hypotheses 1, 2, 4, and 6 (Model 1 in Table 2). In a second\nTable 2.

As EI \u00d7 Partner and EI \u00d7 Economic Hardship were\nnot statistically significant and for reasons of parsimony of the\nmodel, we removed them in a stepwise elimination procedure\nbased on the size of the p values. In a third step, we defined the\nfinal model used for the estimation of the propensity scores\n(Model 3 in Table 2). It contained a three-way interaction to\ntest Hypothesis 5 (i.e., the interactions Male \u00d7 Preschool-Aged\nChild; EI \u00d7 Preschool-Aged Child; EI \u00d7 Male; EI \u00d7 Male \u00d7\nPreschool-Aged Child).\nAlthough the most relevant variables explaining partici-\npation in further training discussed in the literature have been\nincluded, the pseudo R2 of .076 remained relatively low.\nHowever, the PSM performed well (Table A1 in the\nAppendix). The PSM reduced the bias on all but one variable\n(ISCO Cat. 1), but the difference between participants and\nnon-participants remained non-significant on this variable.\nOne treated observation was off the common support and\ntherefore excluded from the analyses.\nHypothesis 1 assumed that employees perceiving high\nemployment insecurity were more likely to train. Yet the\nresults in Model 1 in Table 2 showed that the opposite was\nthe case: the higher the perceived level of employment inse-\ncurity at t-1\n, the lower the odds of participation at t0\n.Therefore,\nno support was found for Hypothesis 1. This unexpected\nresult will be discussed in detail in the discussion section.\nRegarding the family-related factors, Model 1 in Table 2\nshowed that they indeed matter for an employee's odds to\nparticipate in further training. We found evidence for\nHypothesis 2 that expected employees with a partner to be\nmore likely to participate in further training: The odds of par-\nticipation at t0\nwith a partner compared with singles. With Hypothesis 3, we\nassumed a moderating effect of the partner on the relation-\nship between perceived employment insecurity and the prob-\nability to participate in further training. Model 2 in Table 2\nshowed that the interaction term for EI \u00d7 Partner was not\nstatistically significant. From this we deduced that in the\ncontext of high perceived employment insecurity, there was\nno additional impact of the partner on the probability to train.\nHypothesis 3 did not find empirical support.\nTurning to the presence of preschool-aged children, we\nfound support for Hypothesis 4 assuming that preschool-\naged children constrained their mother's but not their\nfather's participation in further training. In fact, women's\nlikelihood to train was influenced by the presence of pre-\nschool-aged children in the household: Women not living\nwith preschool-aged children at t-1\nparticipation at t0\ncompared with women who lived with\npreschool-aged children. The inclusion of the interaction\nterm revealed that men not living with preschool-aged chil-\ntion compared with men who lived with preschool-aged\nchildren. From these results, we deduced that women were\nindeed constrained by their children when further training\nwas concerned. In contrast, for men preschool-aged children\nwere even an incentive to participate in further training.\nWith Hypothesis 5, we expected children to function as\nan incentive in that they increase their parents'participation\nin further training when the parents perceive high levels of\nemployment insecurity. The gender differences were\nexpected to disappear. Model 3 in Table 2 showed that\nwhen including the three-way interaction, the effect of the\npresence of preschool-aged children on the probability to\ntrain remained as in Model 1: women with at least one pre-\nschool-aged child at t-1\nwere less likely, men with at least\none preschool-aged child more likely to train at t0\n. Yet as\nthe interaction term EI \u00d7 Male \u00d7 Preschool-Aged Child was\nnot statistically significant, we could deduce that there was\nno additional difference between men and women. What\nwas new was the finding that preschool-aged children mod-\nerated the relationship between perceived employment\ninsecurity and further training. However, the direction of\nthe effect was unexpected: In the context of employment\ninsecurity, the presence of preschool-aged children did not\nincrease but decrease the parents' probability of participa-\ntion in further training. Gender did not moderate the rela-\ntionship between perceived employment insecurity and\nparticipation in further training. Although Hypothesis 5\nwas mainly not supported by the data, we could indeed\nobserve that in the context of employment insecurity men\nand women showed a more similar behavior related to par-\nticipation in further training.\nFurthermore, we did not find statistically significant evi-\ndence for employees experiencing economic hardship in\ntheir household to be less likely to train (Hypothesis 6). Yet a\ntendency in this direction could be observed with odds ratio\nHypothesis 7 expected employees who experienced\neconomic hardship to moderate the relationship between\nperceived employment insecurity and participation in fur-\nther training. As the interaction term EI \u00d7 Economic\nHardship was not statistically significant, we rejected\nHypothesis 7 and concluded that the experience of eco-\nnomic hardship did not further reduce the employees'\nprobability to train.\nTable 3 depicts an OLS regression based on the matched\nsample, explaining changes in perceived employment inse-\ncurity. With Hypothesis 8, we expected employees who par-\nticipated in further training to perceive reduced levels of\nemployment insecurity. Controlling for the individual,\nwork-, and family-related factors, the results showed that the\naverage treatment effect on the treated ATT is about 0.103\nunits, which means that participants indeed reduced their\nlevels of perceived employment insecurity. Therefore, we\nlarge (what may influence significance), all the discussed\ncoefficients were important in size.\nFurthermore, Table 3 showed what other factors influ-\nenced perceived employment insecurity. The strongest pre-\ndictor of a change in perceived employment insecurity was\nthe level of employment insecurity at time t-1\n: Those who\nperceived high employment insecurity experienced a\ndecline. Agricultural and fishery workers (ISCO Cat. 6) as\nwell as supervisors reported reduced levels of employment\ninsecurity. In contrast, perceived employment insecurity\ntended to increase among legislators, senior officials, and\nmanagers (ISCO Cat. 1) as well as for employees who\nworked for a company that was undergoing some form of\nreorganization, for employees in medium and large firms\nand for those working in the private sector. Results also\nrevealed that high regional unemployment rates translated\ninto increasing levels of perceived employment insecurity.\nAmong the family-related factors, only economic hard-\nship turned out to significantly contribute to explaining\nchanges in perceived employment insecurity: Employees\nwho experienced economic hardship in their household\ntended to report increasing levels of perceived employment\ninsecurity. Furthermore, we could observe that older employ-\nees tended to report slightly decreasing, and employees in\npoor health increasing levels of perceived employment inse-\ncurity. Compared with women, men tended to report reduced\nlevels of employment insecurity--but only if they perceived\na low level of employment insecurity at t-1\nas indicated by the\nsignificant interaction term.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we addressed the question of whether employ-\nees perceiving high levels of employment insecurity par-\nticipated in further training and whether this participation\nsubsequently reduced perceived employment insecurity.\nBy applying a PSM procedure, we took account of the fact\nthat participation in further training is not randomly dis-\ntributed in the population but dependent on individual,\nwork-, and family-related factors. We also drew particular\nattention to the family context. Three main findings can be\nhighlighted.\nFirst, our study shows that participation in further train-\ning is not a strategy that employees actively adopt to reduce\nperceived employment insecurity, as those perceiving high\nlevels of employment insecurity are least likely to train.\nThis result is unexpected but can be explained by the\nemployer's support. Participation in further training is\nhighest when it is employer-supported (Kyndt & Baert,\n2013). According to the human capital approach, employ-\ners invest in training when chances are high that their\ninvestment becomes profitable (Becker, 1962; Mincer,\n1989). If employees perceive high employment insecurity\nas a result of objective circumstances, they may indeed not\nbe the ones employers invest in if it is uncertain whether\nthey will remain in the company. In addition, employees\nwho perceive high employment insecurity may invest their\nenergy in other strategies such as finding new employment\nSecond, our study shows that although further training is\nnot an active strategy to reduce employment insecurity, it\nTable 3.

This finding is in line with a study that demon-\nstrated that employees who received adequate on-the-job\ntraining felt positive about their job proficiency (Truitt,\n2011). This, in turn, may increase the employee's confidence\nto be a valuable member of the labor force and finally reduce\nthe level of perceived employment insecurity. Though we\napplied a different methodological approach and focused on\nperceived employment insecurity, our results are in line with\nprevious research that shows that further training increases\nemployability and reduces perceived job insecurity\nThird, we demonstrated that the family context impacts\nemployees' chances to train. The partner is a resource:\nCompared with employees without a partner, partnered\nemployees are more likely to participate in further training.\nThis result is in line with research that has demonstrated that\nsupport in the family domain positively affects behavior in\nthe work domain and the ways individuals deal with conflict-\ning demands from both domains (Adams, King, & King,\nRandel, & Stevens, 2006). However, in the context of high\nperceived employment insecurity, when employees actively\nhave to deal with their insecure condition, the partner does\nnot further increase the chances of participation in training.\nFrom this we deduce that the benefit of having a partner is of\nmore general nature and not related to his/her support for\ndealing with perceived employment insecurity, at least as far\nas further training is concerned.\nOur study also shows that the presence of preschool-\naged children constrains women's participation in further\ntraining whereas it increases men's participation. This\nfinding is in accordance with the predominant work and\nfamily roles of men and women in Switzerland. For\nwomen, who in Switzerland usually have the main respon-\nsibility for childcare and family work (Baumgartner,\n2008), their restricted flexibility due to the presence of\npreschool-aged children is reflected by reduced invest-\nments in their employability. In contrast, preschool-aged\nchildren are an incentive for the often breadwinning men\nin Switzerland (Baumgartner, 2008). As they usually have\nhigh responsibilities for the financial well-being of the\nfamily, they take career decisions that increase their\nemployability and the financial resources of the family\n(Greenhaus, Peng, & Allen, 2012). However, when the\nemployees' level of perceived employment insecurity is\nconsidered, it cannot be observed that gender differences\nincrease. Neither could we find empirical evidence for the\nassumption that children function as an incentive and\nenhance their parents' chances to train to increase their\nemployability. The opposite is true: Employees who per-\nceive high levels of employment insecurity and have at\nleast one preschool-aged child are less likely to train than\ninsecure employees without a preschool-aged child. As\nthere is no reason to believe that insecure parents fall into\ninertia, we deduce from this result that insecure parents\nmay turn to other strategies such as finding employment\nwith a new employer (Blau et al., 2008; Cavanaugh & Noe,\nFinally, we show that economic hardship is of subordi-\nnate relevance when participation in further training is con-\ncerned. Although there is a tendency for those who\nexperience economic hardship to be somewhat less likely to\ntrain, no additional constraint for further training is observed\nwhen economic hardship and employment insecurity cumu-\nlate. This finding may be explained by the fact that some\nemployees receive financial support from their employers\nThis study reveals some practical implications and points\nto issues that future research should address. Obviously there\nare ways to compensate for perceived employment insecu-\nrity: Participation in further training reduces feelings of\nemployment insecurity. Consequently, as a practical measure\nto reduce their employees' employment insecurity, employ-\ners could support their employees' training efforts through\nfinancial or time-based support. Women with preschool-aged\nchildren should receive particular support, as they are the\nmost constrained by their family context. Future research\nshould also consider other strategies that employees may\nadopt to reduce perceived employment insecurity. Our study\ndemonstrates that it is important to take the family context\ninto account.\nThe results contribute to a better understanding of how\nindividuals deal with perceived employment insecurity\nand the ways their family context influences their deci-\nsions. Nevertheless, the study has some shortcomings.\nFirst, it measures perceived employment insecurity using a\nsingle-item measure. Although it has been shown that sin-\ngle-item measures perform acceptably well (Wanous,\nReichers, & Hudy, 1997), the validity of results could\nincrease if more elaborate measurements are applied.\nSecond, the SHP does not include additional questions\nconcerning the type of further training or the support\nreceived by the employer. Therefore, it is not possible to\nanalyze more detailed aspects of further training. Third,\nfor lack of space, not all the control variables could be\ndiscussed in detail. Therefore, we mainly focused on the\nvariables of interest that were related to the hypotheses.\nFourth, pseudo R2 for the estimation of the propensity\nscore is relatively low. Future research should particularly\naddress the methodological issues that have arisen in this\nstudy. However, our study shows that PSM reduces the\nbias caused by self-selection into further training, and the\ninclusion of family factors has proven useful to draw a\nmore precise picture of how individuals deal with employ-\nment insecurity.\nAppendix\nTable A1.
