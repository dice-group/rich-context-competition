    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Much of the discussion around the Affordable Care Act has\nfocused on likely changes in coverage and access to care for adults.\nHowever, the law also alters coverage options for many low-income\nchildren. We used data from the new Health Reform Monitoring Survey\nChild Supplement to examine access to care and related outcomes for\nlow-income publicly and privately insured children. We found that over\n90 percent of low-income insured children had a usual source of care and\nhad parents who were confident that their children could get the health\ncare they need, regardless of their type of coverage. However, on a variety\nof cost-related measures, including difficulty paying the child's medical\nbills, out-of-pocket expenses, and satisfaction with health insurance\npremiums and copayments, children with Medicaid or the Children's\nHealth Insurance Program (CHIP) fared better than those with employer-\nsponsored insurance. These results have implications for debates about\nthe future of CHIP and other policies that affect public and private\ncoverage options available to children and families.\nLargely because of the success of Med-\nicaid and the Children's Health In-\nsurance Program (CHIP), the un-\ninsurance rate for children under\nage eighteen fell from 13.9 percent\nin 1997, when CHIP was signed into law, to\n(ACA) primarily expands coverage for adults,\nbut it also has important implications for\nchildren.\nChildren may gain coverage through new sub-\nsidies for low- and moderate-income families to\npurchase private plans in new health insurance\nMarketplaces or as a consequence of the ACA\nrequirement that people have health insurance\nor pay a penalty. Children's participation in pub-\nlic coverage programs may also increase as par-\nents' eligibility for Medicaid expands or because\nof new outreach efforts and streamlined eligibil-\nity and enrollment systems in Medicaid and\nCHIP. As a result of these and other provisions,\ntheuninsurancerate forchildren mayfallfurther\nunder the ACA.\nThe ACA may also lead to shifts in the distribu-\ntion of public versus private coverage for\nenrolled in Marketplace (exchange) plans as of\nmay cover more children over time because fund-\ning for CHIP is authorized only through Sep-\nThereareat least two proposals to extend CHIP\nbeyond that deadline. In its June report to Con-\ngress, the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Ac-\ncessCommission proposed atwo-yearextension,\nto allow time to address concerns about the\naffordability and adequacy of exchange cover-\nage--with the possibility of a further extension\nif the concerns are not addressed.4 In addition,\nSen.

This restric-\ntion applies even if the insurance requires a large\ncontribution to cover the child, which may limit\nthe affordability of Marketplace coverage for\nsome low-income families.\nSeveral states have also proposed implement-\ning the ACA Medicaid expansion by using Med-\nicaid funds to help newly eligible beneficiaries\npurchase private Marketplace coverage, with the\npossibility of extending this option to children in\nfuture years.6 Such an approach could shift addi-\ntional children from public to private coverage.\nThus, as policy makers consider issues related to\nCHIP reauthorization, subsidy eligibility rules,\nand alternative approaches to expanding Medic-\naid, it will be important for them to better un-\nderstand how well public versus private coverage\nsucceeds at meeting the health care needs of low-\nincome children.\nA great deal of research has found consistent\nevidence that health insurance improves access\nand service use for children.7 Several studies\nhave also compared access and use for children\nwith public versus private insurance using a va-\nriety of federal surveys, including the Medical\nExpenditure Panel Survey, the National Health\nInterview Survey (NHIS), and the National Sur-\nvey of Children's Health.8\u00ad11 After differences\nacross the two populations are controlled for,\nthe evidence suggests that children with public\nand private insurance are equally likely to have a\nusual source of care and to obtain recommended\nStudies have alsofound that children withpub-\nlic coverage have more difficulty accessing spe-\ncialist care, family-centered care, and after-hours\ncare.10,11 In contrast, children with private cover-\nage experience more cost-related barriers to\nBuilding on this previous research, we used a\nnew data source to provide a more recent picture\nof access and affordability for low-income chil-\ndren with public and private coverage just before\nthe ACA's 2014 coverage expansions. The Health\nReform Monitoring Survey (HRMS) was initiat-\ned in 2013 in response to the limited availability\nof timely data from federal surveys to track\nhealth insurance and access to care under the\nWe present estimates from the survey's Child\nSupplement (HRMS-Kids), which was added in\nsummer 2013 to provide estimates of health in-\nsurance and related health outcomes for chil-\ndren. This study provides current comparisons\nof access and use for children with public and\nprivate coverage and explores access to employ-\ner-sponsored insurance among the children who\nwould be most likely to lose public coverage if\nCHIP were not reauthorized. Our results are de-\nsigned to help inform emerging policy debates\nabout the structure of health insurance for low-\nincome children and families under the ACA.\nStudy Data And Methods\nData Source The HRMS is a quarterly survey\ndrawn from KnowledgePanel, a probability-\nbased Internet panel maintained by GfK Custom\nResearch and based on a representative sample\nof US households.13 More information on the\nsurvey's methodology can be found in the online\nAppendix.14 The core HRMS targets nonelderly\nadults because the ACA coverage expansions pri-\nmarily affect this population. Because children\nmay also experience significant effects of the\nACA, HRMS-Kids was added to the core survey\nin the summer of 2013. If a respondent to the\ncore survey reports that there are any children in\nthe household, a sample child is selected and the\nrespondent--a child's parent, in the vast majori-\nty of cases--is asked to provide information\nabout that child's health and health care experi-\nences. This article presents estimates based on\ndata collected in June\u00adJuly, September, and De-\nSharon Long and colleagues found that the\nHRMS produced reliable estimates for adults\nwhen compared to other nationally representa-\ntive surveys.16 Similarly, we found that the\nHRMS-Kids benchmarks closely to national sur-\nveys on key demographic and socioeconomic\ncharacteristics for children. For example, HRMS\nestimates of the uninsurance rates for all chil-\ndren and for age and racial or ethnic subgroups\nare similar to those from the American Commu-\nnity Survey (ACS) (Appendix Tables 1 and 2).14 At\nthe same time, the HRMS finds a higher rate of\nemployer-sponsored insurance and a lower rate\nof Medicaid or CHIP coverage than does the\nRates of health care use on the HRMS-Kids are\ncomparable to those on the NHIS, with just over\n80 percent of children on each survey reporting\na routine checkup in the past twelve months\n(Appendix Table 3).14 However, compared to\nthe NHIS, the HRMS reports that children are\nless likely to have a usual source of care and more\nlikely to report other access problems. A more\ndetailed discussion of the HRMS-Kids and com-\nparisons to the ACS and the NHIS can be found in\nthe online Appendix.14\nChild & Young Adult Coverage\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

However, it does provide an op-\nportunity to monitor ACA implementation in the\nperiod before estimates from these surveys are\navailable. For example, HRMS estimates from\nsix months before the expected release of NHIS\nestimates from the first three months of 2014.\nMoreover, an Internet survey provides consid-\nerable flexibility in the instrument, which allows\nfor the addition of relevant questions in re-\nsponse to the changing insurance and policy\nlandscape. Thus, despite potential anomalies\nin the sample compared to established federal\nsurveys, we believe that the HRMS-Kids can play\nan important role in monitoring health insur-\nance and access to care for children under\nthe ACA.\nAnalyses To provide insights about the trade-\noffs between public and private coverage for low-\nincome children, we examined several measures\nof access, affordability, and satisfaction with cov-\nple can report having multiple types of coverage,\nwe assigned each child to one type according to\nthe following hierarchy: employer-sponsored in-\nsurance; Medicare; Medicaid or CHIP; private\nnongroup insurance; nonspecified coverage;\nAn estimated 35 percent of children with fami-\nly incomes of less than 250 percent of the federal\npoverty level--which is how we defined low\nincome20--had employer-sponsored insurance\nat the time of the survey, while 50 percent had\nMedicaid or CHIP, and 11 percent were un-\ninsured (Appendix Table 4).14 The remaining\n4 percent had Medicare, nongroup insurance,\nor unspecified coverage. Our study sample fo-\ncused on low-income children under age eigh-\nteen who had been insured for the full twelve\nmonths before the survey and who had employ-\ner-sponsored insurance, Medicaid, or CHIP at\nthe time of the survey.\nBased on parental reports of children's expe-\nriences, we measured the share of children who\nhad a usual source of careand the shareswho had\nhad a routine checkup, a dental checkup, and any\nemergency department visits in the previous\ntwelve months. We also examined parents' re-\nceipt of anticipatory guidance (developmentally\nbased information on healthy lifestyles and the\nprevention of accidents and disease) from a\nhealth care provider. The five anticipatory guid-\nance topics we measured were as follows: how to\nkeep a child from getting injured, how much or\nwhat kind of food the child eats, how much or\nwhat kind of exercise the child gets, how smok-\ning in the house can be bad for the child's health,\nand how the child behaves and gets along with\nparents and others.\nWe explored nonfinancial and financial bar-\nriers to care, including measures of difficulty\nin finding various providers who would see the\nchild, estimates of out-of-pocket spending, un-\nmet needs for various types of care that resulted\nfrom affordability concerns, and problems pay-\ning any of the child's medical bills. We also ex-\namined parents' satisfaction with several fea-\ntures of their child's coverage. We defined\nsatisfaction as being very or somewhat satisfied.\nFinally, we examined whether parents were con-\nfident that their child could get health care if\nneeded. We defined confidence as being very or\nsomewhat confident.\nWe present both unadjusted and regression-\nadjusted differences between children with\nMedicaid or CHIP and those with employer-\nsponsored insurance. Regression-adjusted dif-\nferences controlled for the child's age, sex, race\nor ethnicity, general and mental health status,\nand functional limitations; and for the respon-\ndent's marital status, education, family income\nand homeownership status, census region, and\nMetropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status.\nThe adjusted differences were designed to\nmake the low-income children with public and\nprivate coverage more comparable to one anoth-\ner in terms of their observed health, demograph-\nic, and socioeconomic characteristics so that we\ncould assess the extent to which the differences\nin outcomes were related to insurance status as\nopposed to other factors. For example, low-\nincome children with Medicaid or CHIP were\nyounger, less likely to be white, and more likely\nto live with an unmarried parent, compared to\nlow-income children with employer-sponsored\ninsurance (Appendix Table 5).14\nPeople with access to affordable employer-\nsponsored insurance are ineligible for federal\nsubsidies under theACA. Thus,we also examined\naccess to employer-sponsored insurance for low-\nincome publicly insured children. We identified\nchildren on the HRMS whose adult respondent\nwas covered by or had been offered employer-\nsponsored insurance. Using information not\ntypically available on establishedfederal surveys,\nwe also identified children with access to depen-\ndent employer-sponsored insurance through ei-\nther parent.21 We used this information, along\nwith the current coverage distribution by in-\ncome, to consider potential changes in coverage\nfor low-income families under the ACA.\nLimitations This study had several limita-\ntions. Importantly, our adjusted differences\ncould not account for unobserved differences\nbetween children with public and private cover-\nage that may affect access to care.\nIn addition, reports on the presence or ab-\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Similarly, adult respondents might not al-\nways have accurately recalled the timing of the\nchild's health care experiences.\nAdditional measurement issues include sub-\njective perceptions of unmet needs, which might\nnot align with clinical judgment, and an inability\nto precisely identify subsidy eligibility because of\na lack of information on premiums for employer-\nsponsored insurance. We were also limited to\nnational estimates, despite the importance of\nstate variation in Medicaid and CHIP programs.\nFinally, we provide evidence that selected esti-\nmates from the HRMS-Kids are consistent with\nthose from federal surveys. However, we cannot\nrule out the possibility of selection bias in our\nsample.\nStudy Results\nAccess To Care And Service Use Low-income\nchildren with public and private coverage were\nequally likely to have a usual source of care\n(Exhibit 1). However, publicly insured children\nwere more likely than children with private cov-\nerage to have had a routine checkup in the pre-\nvious twelve months (86.3 percent versus\n80.1 percent). This difference remained signifi-\ncant after we adjusted for demographic, socio-\neconomic, and health characteristics. Children\nwith Medicaid or CHIP were also more likely to\nhave had a dental checkup than those with em-\nployer-sponsored insurance, but this difference\nwas no longer statistically significant after we\nadjusted for potential confounders.\nNearly 40 percent of children with Medicaid or\nCHIP had a parent who reported receiving advice\non all five of the recommended anticipatory\nguidance topics, compared to 26.0 percent of\nchildren with employer-sponsored insurance\n(Exhibit 1). After we adjusted for the character-\nistics of the two populations, the magnitude of\nthe difference was diminished, but it remained\nsignificant.\nNonfinancial And Financial Barriers To\nCare An estimated 4.8 percent of children with\nMedicaid or CHIP had a parent report trouble\nfinding a general physician who would see their\nchild, compared to 4.0 percent of children with\nemployer-sponsored insurance (Exhibit 2). On\nothernonfinancialbarriersto care, childrenwith\nMedicaid or CHIP also had slightly higher levels\nof difficulty in finding a specialist and a dentist\nthan children with employer-sponsored insur-\nance. However, none of these differences were\nstatistically significant.\nHealth Care Service Use For Low-Income Insured Children Ages 0\u00ad17, 2013\nPercentage-point difference\nMedicaid\nor CHIP ESI Unadjusted Adjusted\nChild has or had:\nParent received anticipatory guidance on:\nSOURCE Authors' analysis of data from the 2013 Health Reform Monitoring Survey Child Supplement.

Only 4.7 per-\ncent of children with Medicaid or CHIP had\nout-of-pocket spending of $500 or more for their\nhealth care in the previous year, while 28.4 per-\ncent of children with employer-sponsored insur-\nance had such costs. Adjusting for differences in\nthe characteristics of the populations reduced\nthe magnitude of these differences but did not\neliminate their significance.\nSatisfaction With Health Insurance Con-\nsistent with our findings on cost-related barriers\nto access in the previous section, we found that\npublicly insured children were much more likely\nto have a parent report being satisfied with\nthe premiums (75.0 percent) and copayments\n(73.2 percent) than children with employer-\ncent for premiums and copayments, respective-\nly) (Exhibit 3).

The remaining 6 percent had Medi-\ncare, nongroup insurance, or unspecified insur-\nance. Children with public insurance could expe-\nrience a change in their coverage if CHIP were\nnot reauthorized. Their income would qualify\nthem for federal subsidies in the Marketplaces.\nHowever, their eligibility would also depend on a\nlack of access to affordable employer-sponsored\ninsurance.\nAmong thesepublicly insuredchildren,38per-\ncent had access to dependent coverage through a\nparent's employer-sponsored insurance, and an-\nother 19 percent had a parent with access to\nemployer-sponsored insurance (Exhibit 4).25 Be-\ncause any access to affordable employercoverage\ncould make the family ineligible for a subsidy,\nthese estimates suggest that as many as half of\nthe children with Medicaid or CHIP coverage and\nfamily incomes above 138 percent of poverty\nmight not qualify for Marketplace subsidies if\nCHIP were not reauthorized.26 This could force\nfamilies to choose between purchasing a costly\nprivate plan and allowing their child to become\nuninsured.\nDiscussion\nMuch of the ACA research and policy attention is\ncurrently concentrated on adults. However, chil-\ndren may also experience major changes in cov-\nerage and access to care under the ACA.\nUsing estimates from the 2013 HRMS-Kids, we\nfound that over 90 percent of low-income in-\nsured children had a usual source of care and\nhad parents who were confident that their child\ncould get the care he or she needed, regardless of\ntheir type of coverage. We also found that low-\nincome publicly insured children fared better\nthan those with employer-sponsored insurance\non a variety of cost-related measures, including\nparents' difficulty paying the child's medical\nbills, level of out-of-pocket expenses, and satis-\nfaction with health insurance premiums and\ncopayments. Our analysis also suggests that up\nto half of publicly insured children with family\nincomes above 138 percent of poverty could\nbe ineligible for federal subsidies because of\ntheir potential access to affordable employer-\nsponsored insurance.26\nOur findings have implications for debates\nabout the future of CHIP and other policies that\naffect the public and private coverage options\navailable to children and families.

First,\nmany children enrolled in CHIP will not qualify\nfor Marketplace subsidies if they have a parent\nwith access to affordable employer-sponsored\ninsurance.27 Second, children with private cover-\nage often face higher premium and cost-sharing\nburdens than those with public coverage.3,11\nSimilarly, efforts to increase reliance on pri-\nvate coverage, including state waivers to expand\nMedicaid by using federal funds to purchase\nMarketplace coverage for eligible people, may\nalso subject low-income families to significant\nout-of-pocket costs. Thus, it will be critical for\npolicy makers to take into account the health\ncareneeds and financial resources of low-income\nfamilies as they consider options that could alter\nthe mix of public versus private coverage for low-\nincome children.\nBoth public and private coverage may have\nother benefits for children that we did not mea-\nsure. Medicaid and CHIP often provide coverage\nfor transportation and a variety of case manage-\nment services, which address the complex needs\nof low-income families.28 Along with lower costs,\nthese benefits may account for the significant\nshare of children whose families choose Medic-\naid or CHIP when they have access to employer-\nsponsored insurance.\nAt the same time, there are long-standing con-\ncerns about access to care for publicly insured\nchildren because of lower payments to providers\nand limited provider participation in public pro-\ngrams.29,30 The fact that over one-third of low-\nincome children have employer-sponsored in-\nsurance when some are likely to be eligible for\npublic insurance suggests that some low-income\nfamilies may prefer private coverage for their\nchildren. This may reflect a desire to keep fami-\nlies in the same plan or to address provider ac-\ncess, stigma, or administrative concerns associ-\nated with public coverage. These families could\nbenefit from the premium assistance approach\nto expanding Medicaid that is being proposed in\nseveral states.6\nConclusion\nThis analysis has provided important pre-ACA\nbenchmarks on coverage, access, and affordabil-\nity for low-income children. It will be important\nto continue monitoring these and other out-\ncomes for children as implementation of the\nACA continues. \nThe Health Reform Monitoring Survey\n(HRMS) is supported by multiple\nfoundations and the Urban Institute.
