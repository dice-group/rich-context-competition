    "abstract": "Abstract. The Poggendorff illusion is one of the most exhaustively studied illusions. Can it be revived\nas an interesting problem? Perhaps by moving it to a slightly different domain. Here, we consider\nthe occlusion of a subjectively linear ramp of tonal values. In a simple experiment, we find results\nclosely resembling those of the geometrical Poggendorff. Yet, the \"explanations\" offered for the latter\nhardly apply to the former case. Depending upon one's perspective, this may be taken to \"revive\" the\nPoggendorff illusion.\n",

He pointed out the illusion in a drawing by the astronomer\nZ\u00f6llner (1860) in a letter he received as the editor of his(!) Annalen der Physik und Chemie. Thus,\nthere is only a weak relation between the man and what we know as \"The Poggendorff\".\nThe Poggendorff illusion has been researched in great detail (Burmester, 1896; Day & Dick-\n\"Short & Sweet\", but very instructive account of the scientific methods wielded in our field. One feels\nsatisfied that the topic is closed.\nAs the authors happened to meet as lecturers at a summer course, sheer serendipity induced them\nto ask whether the Poggendorff might occur in different sections of the six-dimensional data volume\n(two spatial, one temporal, and three chromatic degrees of freedom). We decided on a position-lumi-\nnance plane. Thus, we occluded a linear brightness ramp. Our question was whether the two visible\nlegs of the ramp would reveal an illusory offset in brightness analogous to the offset in \"height\" char-\nacteristic of the traditional Poggendorff illusion.\nThere are some intricacies to deal with. For instance, the occluder and the background should not\noffer anchor points for the ramp. We decided to render the occluder in black\u00adwhite texture, and the\nbackground deep blue (Figure 1) because neither can be comfortably matched to a uniform gray level.\nWe also needed a subjectively linear (i.e., uniform) brightness scale, which we determined for each\nobserver before the actual experiment. To provide ample freedom for brightness adjustments in any\nPoggendorff rides again!\n*Corresponding author.\ndirection, we constrained the standard ramp to an intermediate range of gray values (64\u00ad191 from the\ndevice range 0\u00ad255). The task of the observers was to adjust the nominal brightness offset between\nthe two half-ramps such that they appeared as a single linear brightness ramp partially hidden by the\noccluder. The offset was applied symmetrically around mid-gray; when the right ramp was brightened,\nthe left ramp was darkened by the same amount (or vice versa). The perceptual offset experienced\nbefore manipulation of the physical offset is noticeable in Figure 1.\nEach of the authors completed three cycles of brightness calibration and measurement of the\n\"Poggendorff brightness offset.\" In each of the calibration sessions, we estimated the mapping f(x)\nfrom device coordinates x to a linear (uniform) brightness scale by adjusting a linear arrangement\nof five achromatic square targets such that the brightness differences between any two neighboring\nsquares were equal. The endpoints (\"dark\" and \"bright\") of the scale were fixed. We fitted a third-\norder polynomial (f(x) = a + bx + cx2 + dx3) to the three sets of settings resulting from each calibration\nsession and used this function to display linear brightness scales for the ramps displayed in the main\nexperimental sessions. In the latter, clicking the \"up\" arrow raised the brightness (i.e., f(x)) of the entire\nramp visible to the right of the occluder and simultaneously lowered the brightness of the entire ramp\nvisible to the left of the occluder (and vice versa for the \"down\" button). This setting was done three\ntimes in each session.\nThe global average reveals a very significant \"Poggendorff effect.\" However, it is not quite clear-\ncut: Although four of the authors showed very similar results, one author had the opposite effect. This\nproved reproducible, thus we have to leave an open end here. In Figure 2, we show the result on omis-\nsion of this participant, although there is hardly a visible difference with the full result. Anyway, the\neffect is huge (Michelson contrast 23 \u00b1 13%), and a graph of the result shows great similarity to the\noriginal Poggendorff. Note that device intensity values (rather than \"linear\" brightness f(x)) are plotted\non the y-axis of Figure 2 left. Plotted in terms of brightness, the curves would be straight rather than\nslightly curved.\nThe explanations that have been offered for the Poggendorff illusion appeal to the intricacies of\nthe perception of directions and angular relations. No such angular relations are present in our \"tonal\nPoggendorff.\" Nevertheless, the geometrical Poggendorff and our tonal Poggendorff are strikingly\nanalogous, both in structure (an interrupted ramp) and in the percept. This strongly suggests a deeper\nexplanation not specific to geometry or gray level. Our result certainly calls for further investigation:\nPoggendorff rides again!\nFigure 1. At left: The traditional Poggendorff illusion. A straight oblique line is occluded by a vertical outline\n\"bar,\" yet the right line segment appears \"higher\" than the straight extrapolation of the left line segment. At\nright: Demonstration of the \"brightness Poggendorff.\" Here, a linear brightness ramp is occluded by a vertical\ncheckered bar. Most people experience the right side of the ramp as \"brighter\" than it should be if the part of\nthe brightness ramp to the left of the occluder is linearly extrapolated. In order to avoid potentially confounding\nlightness anchoring or brightness contrast effects, we used a checkered \"occluder\" and a colored background with\n\"indefinite brightness values.\"\nPoggendorff rides again! 17\nReferences\nBurmester, E.

At left: The average of the three sessions by four of the authors (author JW had a qualitatively different\neffect, although this would hardly show up in the average). We used bilateral adjustment. The result looks much\nlike a regular \"Poggendorff illusion.\" The Y-axis represents the 256 gray levels on the computer monitor rescaled\nto (0\u00ad1). The red curve (occluded part dashed) shows a grayscale ramp which appears as a linear brightness scale\nwhen it is not occluded. When occluded in the middle, however, the lower part appears too dark (or, equivalently,\nthe upper part appears too light) for a subjectively linear brightness scale.. The blue curves show the readjustment\nof the two visible parts of the brightness ramp necessary to correct for this illusion. At this setting, the two visible\nparts appear as a single linear brightness scale partially hidden behind the occluder. The curves shown here are\nthe pointwise averages of the brightness ramps at the final settings chosen by the observers in terms of device\ngray values.
