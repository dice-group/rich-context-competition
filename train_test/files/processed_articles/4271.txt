Therefore, this present\nstudy evaluated the relationship between\neffect-site concentration (CE\n) of propofol\nand cardiac systolic function using TDI,\nin patients undergoing cardiovascular\nprocedures.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis was a single-centre, prospective study\nthat took place between January 2013 and\nCentre, Seoul, Korea. Patients undergoing\ngeneral anaesthesia under TIVA for cardio-\nvascular procedures were eligible for inclusion.\nExclusion criteria were: (i) age<18 years; (ii)\nurgent or emergency cases; (iii) allergy to egg\nor soybean oil; (iv) left ventricular ejection\nfraction (LVEF) <40%; (v) regional wall\nmotion abnormality; (vi) atrial fibrillation.\nThe study was approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board of Konkuk\nUniversity Medical Centre, Seoul, Korea\nWritten informed consent was obtained\nfrom all patients.\nAnaesthetic regimen and TDI\nAccording to our institutional protocol,\nanaesthesia was performed after all vasoactive\nagents including dopamine and phenylephrine\nhad been prepared. The anaesthetic technique\nwas standardized. In brief, the patient arrived\nat the operation room without premedication.\nAfter establishing routine patient monitoring\n(i.e. pulse oximetry, electrocardiography, non-\ninvasive BP monitoring and bispectral index\n[BIS; a measure of the depth of anaesthesia]),\na radial artery was cannulated for continu-\nous invasive systemic BP monitoring. Pre-\noxygenation and de-nitrogenation were\nachieved following eight breaths of maximal\ninhalation and exhalation with 100% oxygen.\nDuring induction of anaesthesia, each patient\nwas supplied with 100% oxygen via a tightly\nfitted mask. Target end-tidal carbon dioxide\n) concentration was maintained, and\nrespiration parameters (i.e. tidal volume and\nrespiration rate) were checked. Intravenous\nlidocaine (0.5mg/kg) was used to prevent the\npain induced by the propofol injection.\nTransthoracic echocardiographic assess-\nments using TDI were performed using\na 5 MHz transducer (GE Healthcare,\nWauwatosa, WI, USA) as recommended in\nguidelines.8 Pulsed wave TDI was evaluated\nafter obtaining an apical four-chamber view\nwith optimal gain and the best signal-to-\nnoise ratio. The sample volume was pos-\nitioned at the left lateral ventricular wall\nwith the mitral valve annulus. Three dis-\ntinctive velocities were recorded; upward\ndeflection during systole (systolic myocar-\ndial velocity, s0) and two downward deflec-\ntions corresponding to the early diastolic\nphase (early diastolic myocardial relaxation\nvelocity, e0) and late diastolic phase (late\nmyocardial relaxation velocity with atrial\ncontraction, a0) (Figure 1). The s0 velocity\nwas measured for assessment of LV systolic\nfunction.\nAll TDI assessments were performed by\nthe cardiac anaesthesiologist (S-H Kim) at\nthe end of the expiratory period to exclude\nrespiratory effects. A TDI assessment was\nperformed at baseline (i.e. CE\nafter the lidocaine injection. Anaesthesia\nwas induced by administration of propofol\nat an initial effect-site target concentration\nof 1.0 mg/ml using a target-controlled infu-\nsion device with a built-in modified Marsh\nmodel (Orchestra\u00d5 Base Primea; Fresenius\nVial, Bre\n\u00b4 zins. France).9 A second TDI\nassessment was performed 5 min after the\nplasma concentration (CP\n) and CE\nof\nFigure 1.

Further TDI\nassessments were made 5 min after the CP\nand CE\nof propofol were equivalent for all\ndose increases of propofol up to 4.0 mg/ml\n(Figure 2). At the same time-points, mean\narterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate\n(HR) and BIS were also measured.\nDuring the dose escalation of propofol,\nassisted or controlled ventilation using a\nface mask with 100% oxygen was used if\npulse oximetry fell below 95%. The tidal\nvolume, respiration rate and concentration\nof end-tidal CO2\nwere maintained at the\nsame values as for spontaneous ventilation.\nCrystalloid fluid was infused at 2 \u00c2 ideal\nbody weight (kg) ml/h throughout the entire\nanaesthesia.10 In the event that MAP\nbeats per min (bpm), a vasoactive agent (i.e.\nphenylephrine 30 mg or ephedrine 4 mg\natropine [HR <40 bpm]) was administered\nand the study was terminated to ensure\npatient safety.\nAfter all TDI assessments had been\ncompleted, anaesthesia care was continued\nby the attending anaesthesiologists until the\nend of surgery.\nStatistical Analyses\nThe CE\nof propofol and the corresponding\nTDI (s0 velocity), MAP, HR and BIS were\nevaluated. The TDIs were evaluated by three\nassessors, two were blinded observers\nand one (S-H Kim) had also performed the\nTDI assessments. To assess inter-observer\nvariability, the values of s0 according to CE\nof propofol were analysed using the intra-\nclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The\nICC is an established statistic for assessing\nmeasurement `reliability' and is defined\nusing variance components.11 The better\nthe agreement among assessors, the closer\nthe denominator is to the numerator and the\ncloser the ICC is to 1.0.\nThe primary outcome variable was s0 vel-\nocity.

The s0 velocity is less dependent on\npreload, closely related to LVEF,13,14 and is\nbetter correlated with ventricular contract-\nwall is composed of three myocardial layers\nwith non-homogenous deformation creat-\ning multiple directed movements including\ncircumferential and longitudinal contrac-\ntions.16 The subendocardial layer of the left\nventricle is mainly composed of longitu-\ndinal fibres and has greater oxygen con-\nsumption with less collateral blood flow\nthan the other layers.17 Therefore, the\nsubendocardial layer of the left ventricle is\nvulnerable to ischaemia.18 Even in patients\nwith normal LVEF, s0 velocity values are\noften low,19 but they provide early infor-\nmation regarding abnormal longitudinal\nsystolic function well before any deterior-\nation in LVEF.6 The s0 velocity has been\nreported to be a predictor of myocardial\nperfusion defect20 and has been shown to be\nuseful in the detection of early abnormal-\nities in LV in patients with coronary artery\ndisease.21 Therefore, in our opinion mea-\nsuring the longitudinal contraction with s0\nvelocity is a valid parameter for assessing\nearly cardiac systolic dysfunction in\npatients undergoing cardiovascular proced-\nures. Furthermore, the ICC statistic\nshowed that there was substantial inter-\nobserver reliability of the s0 velocity\nassessments.\nA previous study indicated that an s0\nvelocity below 8 cm/s suggests LV systolic\ndysfunction.12 In the present study, at pro-\npofol concentrations of 3.0 and 4.0 mg/ml,\nthe s0 velocity was near or below\n8 cm/s during cardiovascular procedures.\nThese observations indicate that propofol at\nconcentrations >2.0 mg/ml during TIVA\ncould induce deterioration of subendocardial\nfunction in patients with underlying cardio-\nvascular diseases even in those with normal\nLVEF. Therefore, because patients undergo-\ning cardiovascular procedures are usually\nsusceptible to low BP and have a right-shift\nin the autoregulation of coronary blood flow,\nthese current findings suggest that patients\nshowing an s0 velocity near or below 8 cm/s\nwith decreased MAP will require adequate\nand timely treatment. The combination of\npropofol as a hypnotic agent with remifenta-\nnil as an analgesic agent is the most com-\nmonly used regimen for achieving\nhaemodynamic stability during TIVA.22\nHowever, remifentanil has a limited effect\non myocardial contractility23,24 and may\ninduce hypotension with vasodilatation.1\nTherefore, a combination of remifentanil\nwith propofol >2.0 mg/ml during TIVA may\ncause significant haemodynamic deterior-\nation partly based on propofol-related longi-\ntudinal cardiac systolic dysfunction as\nobserved in this present study.\nAlthough there were no statistically signifi-\ncant decreases in MAP, HR or s0 velocity as\npropofol CE\nBIS decreased with statistical significance.\nThis finding is in agreement with another\nstudy where the effect of propofol on BIS was\nshown to be more rapid than its effect on\nsystolic BP.25 Therefore, it appears that at the\nonset of the effects of propofol on s0 velocity,\nits effects on MAP, HR and BIS could differ\nat the same CE.\nThe study was conducted at induction of\nanaesthesia rather than under maintenance of\nanaesthesia to confirm the true effects of the\ndifferent incremental increases of propofol CE\non the s0 velocity of the LV. If the study had\nbeen conducted under maintenance of anaes-\nthesia, assessing the true effects of propofol CE\nwould have been difficult because of various\nconfounding factors such as remifentanil,\nvasoactive medications and ventilation-related\npreload changes. Moreover, the incremental\nincreases of propofol CE\nduring maintenance\nof anaesthesia may have decreased the values\nof BIS to below the appropriate anaesthetic\ndepth with accompanying hypotension, which\nwould have required the addition of vaso-\nactive agents.3\nThe Marsh and Schnider models are\nwidely used as pharmacokinetic models for\npropofol.9,26 In the present study, the mod-\nified Marsh model was used and it has a\ncentral compartment volume of 0.228 ml/kg,\ngreater than the 4.27 l of the Schnider\nmodel.9,26 Therefore, compared with the\nSchnider model, the modified Marsh model\nrequires more propofol during induction\nand maintenance of anaesthesia to sustain\nthe same CE\n.9,26 The lower requirement of\npropofol with the Schnider model may have\ntranslated into a smaller decrement of s0\nvelocity. Therefore, the decline in s0 velocity\nmay differ according to the adopted phar-\nmacokinetic model for propofol.\nThe present study had several limitations.\nFirst, patients with regional wall motion\nabnormalities were not enrolled because it\nwas essential to include all segments of the\nLV wall for precise evaluation of s0 velocity.\nFurther studies are required to access LV\ncontractility after propofol infusion in more\ndiverse segments of LV. Secondly, the meas-\nurement of LVEF would have been helpful\nto confirm the effect of propofol on cardiac\nsystolic function. Previous research has\nreported good correlation between s0 vel-\nnot measured in the present study because of\nthe risk of displacement of the echocardio-\ngraphic transducer induced by frequent\ntransducer moving in the simultaneous\nmeasurement of s0 velocity. Research has\nshown that transducer displacement can\nresult in the misalignment of the angle for\nmeasuring TDI, which results in incorrect\nIn conclusion, the s0 velocity decreased as\npropofol CE\nImportantly, propofol CE\nwere associated with s0 velocity near or\nbelow 8 cm/s, which indicated cardiac sys-\ntolic dysfunction. Therefore, although the\nrecommended dosage for propofol is up\nto 4.0 mg/ml, caution should be taken\nwhen using propofol concentrations above\n2.0 mg/ml during TIVA in patients with\nunderlying cardiovascular disease.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research was supported by the Basic Science\nResearch Program through the National\nResearch Foundation of Korea funded by the\nMinistry of Science, ICT and Future Planning\nTable 2.
