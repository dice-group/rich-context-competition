The dependence of systematic risk on\nfirm size is compared with the size-dependent capital relief granted to SME lending in the\nregulatory minimum capital requirements of Basel II and Basel III. Key contributions of\nthis paper are the use of a unique data set of SME lending by over 400 German banks\ncovering both small and large banks and an evaluation of the asset correlations as a\nmeasure for systematic risk in the context of current regulatory capital requirements.\nSince regulatory capital requirements can affect the interest margins required by the\nlender, only their appropriate risk sensitivity will ensure an optimal credit supply.\nWe find that the relative differences between the capital requirements for large corporates\nand those for SMEs (in other words, the capital relief for SMEs in Basel II) are in\ntwo cases lower in the current regulatory framework than implied by the empirically\nestimated asset correlations: (1) In the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Approach this\ndifference amounts to up to 24 percentage points on average across rating categories. This\nconcerns only SME loans in the corporate portfolio. (2) For all loans assigned to the SME\nportfolio in the Revised Standardized Approach (RSA), this effect is considerably stronger.\nBefore interpreting these results as an indication to lower international regulatory capital\nrequirements, one should also consider the deliberately more conservative calibration of\nthe less risk-sensitive RSA (compared with the IRB approach) and the Germany-specific\nrobustness of the credit quality of SMEs within the sample period.\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nIn dieser Studie soll mithilfe einer empirischen Analyse auf Basis historischer Ausfallraten\ndeutscher kleiner und mittlerer Unternehmen (KMU) untersucht werden, inwiefern sich\ndie Unternehmensgr\u00a8\no\u00dfe auf das systematische Kreditrisiko bei der Kreditvergabe an\nKMUs auswirkt.

Discussion\nPapers represent the authors' personal opinions and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Deutsche\nBundesbank or its staff.\n1 Motivation and Overview\nOur paper belongs to a well-established strand of empirical work on the systematic risk in\nloans to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). We explore in particular the dependence\nof systematic risk on firm size and compare the size of this effect with the capital relief\ngranted to SME lending in the regulatory minimum capital requirements of Basel II.1\nAnother key contribution is the use of a unique data sample of SME lending by over\n400 German banks. What sets this sample apart is its comprehensive coverage of the\nparticularly rich and well-developed credit market for SMEs in Germany, the availability\nof banks' internal ratings, and the capture of the recent financial crisis in the time series.\nThe asset correlation is used as the key measure of systematic risk. It also drives the\nsystematic risk in the Asymptotic Single Risk Factor (ASRF) model of Gordy (2003) that\nis the basis of the regulatory minimum capital requirements in the Internal Ratings-Based\nApproach (IRBA) of Basel II.\nThe asset correlation is estimated in the first step from historical default rates by the\nMaximum-Likelihood (ML) estimator of Gordy and Heitfield (2002). In the second step\nand based on the asset correlation estimates, the dependence of capital requirements\non firm size is compared both with the dependence implicit in the current IRBA risk\nweight functions and with risk weights in the Revised Standardized Approach (RSA).2\nFor this purpose we consider the relative reduction in systematic risk which is measured\nas a capital requirement in the ASRF model, with respect to large firms. Thereby, our\nstudy also contributes to the empirical question of an appropriate (relative) calibration\nof regulatory capital requirements for SME lending.\nFor our analysis it is important to separate a potentially higher firm-specific (idiosyncratic)\nrisk of SMEs \u00ad that is typically reflected in higher default probabilities \u00ad from a potentially\nlower systematic risk of SMEs. Since capital requirements in the ASRF model refer\nby construction only to systematic risk, lower asset correlations (and therefore lower\nsystematic risk) compared with large firms would ceteris paribus also suggest lower\ncalibrated capital requirements for SMEs. Capital requirements of an SME loan in the\nIRBA depend on both, the default probability and the risk weight function that in turn\ndepends on the asset correlation value. As a consequence lower systematic risk for SMEs\ncan well be in line with higher capital requirements for SMEs if SMEs have higher default\nprobabilities, i.e., higher firm-specific risk, than large firms.\n1This treatment has been continued without change in the Basel III framework.\n2In the IRBA the capital requirements are computed by multiplying the credit exposure by a risk\nweight that is a function of the default probability, the recovery rate, the maturity and the asset type of\nthe loan. In the RSA the risk weight is tabulated and depends both on the borrower type and an external\nrating, i.e., a rating given by an acknowledged rating agency. Very often in this paper the terms \"capital\nrequirement\" and \"risk weight\" can be used interchangeably.\nOur empirical results can also be useful for an evaluation of current regulatory capital\nrequirements \u00ad subject to taking into account various conceptual and empirical caveats\nthat are described in more detail in Section 5. Since regulatory capital requirements can\naffect the interest margins required by the lender, only their appropriate calculation in the\nsense that they reflect the actual risk posed by the borrower will ensure an optimal credit\nsupply for the economy. Since SMEs are the backbone of the economy in many countries,\nsuch as Germany, appropriate capital requirements are crucial for economic growth.\nIn principle, an evaluation of regulatory capital requirements should distinguish between\nthe level of capital and the relative difference to other asset classes. In the development\nof Basel II the second aspect, often referred to as relative calibration, was addressed\nfirst. The level calibration instead was guided by the requirement to keep the overall\nlevel of capital in the international banking system broadly constant when transitioning\nfrom Basel I to Basel II. This was achieved in an iterative top-down calibration, guided\nby several quantitative impact studies coordinated by the Basel Committee on Banking\nSupervision.\nOur analysis is very much in the spirit of previous analyses that were carried out for\nthe relative calibration of Basel II. The asset correlations are estimated based on the\nASRF model underlying the IRBA capital requirements. We use large corporates as a\nbenchmark which means that they are assumed to be correctly calibrated in level. Then\nwe compare the relative difference of both, capital requirements based on estimated asset\ncorrelations and the current IRBA capital requirements from the capital requirements for\nthis benchmark. Comparing these two relative differences can provide useful information\nfor an evaluation of the capital relief for SMEs granted in Basel II.\nWe have to confine ourselves to this relative calibration since the appropriate level of\nregulatory capital cannot be satisfactorily assessed for the following two reasons:\n(i) The overall level of capital requirements was determined in the top-down calibration\nof the whole Basel II framework, involving also for example the 99.9% confidence\nlevel of the value-at-risk, the scaling factor of 1.06 of credit risk weighted assets,\nand the benchmark maturity of 2.5 years. There is no reason to believe that this\nvery different calibration goal will provide asset correlations similar to the estimates\nfrom time series of default rates.\n(ii) The asset correlation parameter in the regulatory risk weight function was calibrated\nin order to reflect a certain degree of sectoral concentration in portfolios of\nrepresentative banks.3 For this reason, any direct estimation based on the ASRF\nmodel would be, technically speaking, an estimation within a wrongly specified\nmodel.\nA well-established strand of empirical work now exists on the systematic risk in SME\nloans. Although the findings on the level of asset correlations in the ASRF model vary\nsubstantially, they tend to indicate lower rather than higher asset correlations overall\ncompared to the values used in the IRBA capital requirements. Table A.1 in the Appendix\nprovides a comprehensive overview of the existing empirical studies on asset correlations.\nFurther studies are summarized in the survey of Berg, Gehra, and Kunisch (2011). We\ndistinguish between two strands of empirical literature which lead to quite different results\nin terms of the level of asset correlations. The first strand uses historical default rates to\ndetermine default correlations or asset correlations. These studies include R\u00a8\nullmann and Scheule (2006), and Bams, Pisan, and Wolff\n(2012). These authors generally estimate lower values than the ones used in the IRBA. In\nthe second strand D\u00a8\nullmann, Kunisch, and K\u00a8\null (2010) have shown that asset correlation\nestimates based on equity prices tend to be somewhat higher than those based on default\nrates. Their results are reflected, for instance, in studies by Hahnenstein (2004) or Lopez\nSeveral studies which originated from Hahnenstein (2004) also assess the dependence\nof asset correlations on size, creditor quality (i.e., rating), and sector. For a sample of\nGerman firms D\u00a8\nullmann and Scheule (2006) find that asset correlations increase with size,\nbut they do not find an unambiguous relation to the creditor rating. In contrast, Dietsch\nand Petey (2004) find that for French and German SMEs \"asset correlations decrease\nsignificantly on average with the SME size\". However, their sample is considerably smaller\nthan the one used by D\u00a8\nCastro (2012), who distinguishes between sectors, world regions, and rating finds an\n\"inverse relation between correlation and the quality of the issuer\" using Bayesian\nestimation techniques. Also, Hansen, van Vuuren, and Ramadurai (2008) come to the\nconclusion that asset correlations vary geographically and that the relation between asset\ncorrelations and probability of default (PD) is ambiguous. For certain asset classes, as\nopposed to the Basel II predictions, they find a higher PD being associated with higher\nasset correlations.\nIn summary, previous empirical work is by and large inconclusive on the size of the\n3Since the ASRF model cannot capture sectoral concentration because of the assumption of the single\nrisk factor, the asset correlation for the risk weight function was \"calibrated\" as follows: It was set so\nthat the value-at-risk of the ASRF model was on average the same as the value-at-risk of representative\nportfolios of real banks in a multi-factor asset value model. In this way, the risk weight function implicitly\nalso reflects the sectoral concentration of those bank portfolios on average.\nappropriate asset correlations, although a tendency towards lower values than the ones\nchosen for the current regulatory capital requirements is observable.\nOur empirical results confirm previous findings that asset correlations increase with firm\nsize conditional on the rating category. Furthermore, they suggest that the relative\ndifferences between the capital requirements for large corporates and those for SMEs (in\nother words, the capital relief for SMEs) are in two cases lower in the current regulatory\nframework than implied by our empirically estimated asset correlations:\n1. In the IRB approach the empirically observed potential for increasing the difference\nin capital requirements between SME loans in the corporate portfolio and large\ncorporates might amount up to 24 percentage points dependent on firm size. This\ncould be achieved by adjusting the asset correlation parameters of the IRBA formula.\nFor SMEs in the IRBA retail portfolio, however, there is no empirical indication\nsupporting a change of the current minimum capital requirements.\n2. For all loans assigned to the SME portfolio in the RSA, the empirical results suggest\na significantly higher relative reduction compared to large firms than reflected in the\ncurrent capital requirements. The capital relief potential amounts to values between\nBefore the capital relief reflected in these figures is translated into a policy message\nto adjust the current regulatory capital requirements, several caveats also need to be\nconsidered, which are described in Section 5.\n2 Data Sample\n2.1 Desirable Properties of the Dataset\nThe sample should ideally cover as large a part of the entire SMEs and large corporates\nuniverse as possible. Since defaults are rare events and since the sample needs to be split\ninto several buckets the small-sample noise in the estimation results should be reduced\nto the extent possible. Systematic risk is driven by the evolution of the credit cycle over\ntime; therefore, it can only be measured from time series. Thus, it is important to have\na long time series that covers at least one full credit cycle.\nIt is also crucial that the definition of default is the same throughout the observation\nperiod since any change in the definition may have a significant impact on the level of\nobserved default rates and ultimately on the asset correlation estimates. This definition\nshould ideally be the Basel II definition of default: \"A default is considered to have\noccurred with regard to a particular obligor when either or both of the two following\nevents have taken place. (1) The bank considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its\ncredit obligations to the banking group in full, without recourse by the bank to actions\nsuch as realising security (if held). (2) The obligor is past due more than 90 days on any\nmaterial credit obligation to the banking group. Overdrafts will be considered as being\npast due once the customer has breached an advised limit or been advised of a limit smaller\nthan current outstandings.\" (See Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2006)) Since\nthis definition is wider than the insolvency criterion4 that has often been used in previous\nstudies (e.g., D\u00a8\nullmann and Scheule (2006)), we expect the number of defaults to be on\naverage higher and consequently the results to be more robust to small-sample noise in\nbuckets of low default rates. A recent study by Dietsch (2013) investigates the impact of\ndifferent definitions of default on measures of credit risk.\nThere should be no selection bias of SMEs included in the sample, e.g., by larger SMEs\nentering at an earlier stage and smaller SMEs at a later stage. Pooled data of a large\nnumber of banks can also help to reduce any bank-specific bias in the data.\nBased on empirical findings regulators chose to make the asset correlation in the IRBA\nrisk weight functions for corporate SMEs dependent both on the PD and the firm size.\nIn order to disentangle both dependencies, the sample should be broken down not only\ninto size buckets but also into rating buckets. This two-dimensional break-down further\nunderlines the need for the total sample to be of a sufficient size.\nThere should be no structural breaks in the sample caused, for example, by a significant\nchange of the rating methodology.\nLending policies as well as the cyclicality of the credit risk in SME loans may differ across\n4This is specified in the German Insolvency Code.\njurisdictions, for example, because of economic differences between the SME segments,\nstructural differences in the capital structure of SMEs, different lending policies (e.g.\nrelationship oriented banking vs. transaction oriented banking), or legal differences, e.g. in\nthe insolvency code. Since our results pertain only to the German SME sector, an analysis\non a country-by-country basis is required before generalizing the outcome to SME sectors\nof other countries.\n2.2 Data Description\nThe data that have been provided by both small and large German banks feature the\ndesirable properties listed in the previous subsection. They comprise submissions by\n2011. Defaults are counted for 14 semi-annual periods starting at the end of June and\nthe end of December, respectively. In each considered time period our sample on average\nincludes approximately 250,000 rated borrowers. Although the vast majority of banks\nhave adopted the RSA, their rating systems have been designed along the requirements of\nan IRBA rating system. The considered creditors include all domestic firms (except credit\ninstitutions) for which an IRBA PD has been available. Retail and specialized lending\nare not considered.\nDefault rates for certain rating-size buckets exhibit semi-annual seasonality due to\nbanks' provisioning policy. Thus, the underlying time series have to be seasonally\nadjusted. Since the data set contains only 14 half-yearly observations for every rating-size\nbucket, it is challenging to identify the seasonal pattern. In this regard, we apply the\ndifference-from-moving-average method to seasonally adjust the time series. In order to\navoid overadjustment during the financial crisis (second half year of 2008, both half years\nof 2009), these outliers are excluded from the estimation of the moving average. It should\nbe noted, however, that all data points are seasonally adjusted and visual inspection of\nthe new time series confirms the high quality of this approach.\nIn our sample every observation includes two figures: the number of borrowers at the\nbeginning of the respective period in the respective bucket, and the number of defaults\nup to the end of that period. Buckets are built in three dimensions: yearly turnover,\nrating, and time.5 If a borrower is included in the credit portfolio at the beginning of\nthe semi-annual horizon and its credit is redeemed in the following half year, the credit is\ncounted as 0.5 for the number of credits. Nevertheless this effect is minor. The upper panel\nof Figure 1 shows the number of borrowers and the lower panel the number of defaults\nwith respect to the rating category. The increase in numbers in the first two semi-annual\n5The availability of \"number of borrowers\" and \"number of defaults\" per bucket allows us to merge\nbuckets quite flexibly if the number of observations becomes too low for robust estimation results.\nperiods is clearly due to the step-by-step adoption of the rating methodology by the banks\nin 2004\u00ad2005. The fluctuation of the number of defaults is indicative for point-in-time or\n\"hybrid\" PDs, i.e., PDs that follow a mixture between a pure point-in-time and a pure\nthrough-the-cycle concept.\nFigure 1: Semi-annual number of borrowers and defaults with respect to rating\ncategory\n(a) Number of borrowers\n(b) Number of defaults\nThe rating buckets are defined according to the size and the rating of the borrower. Rating\ncategories are determined by a master scale invented by the Joint Banking Initiative for\nthe Financial Location of Germany (2010) (IFD). Its original purpose was to improve\nthe transparency of IRBA ratings and to enable borrowers to compare their own rating\nacross banks. This master scale comprises six rating classes I to VI with I being the\nbest rating. The different rating systems of each bank in Germany can be converted\ninto the IFD system. The sample period of seven years covers the recent global financial\ncrisis and roughly meets the requirement to include one full credit cycle. However, due\nto the robustness of foreign demand from outside Europe and due to special national\narrangements to support the German economy (for example, extensive use of flexible\ntime arrangements in order to avoid lay-offs, or the temporary introduction of the car\nscrapping premium), the sample period does not capture a period of severe recession in\nthe SME sector.\nSince observations are available for half years, the sample in total contains 14 semi-annual\nperiods in the time dimension. As the data is pooled across many banks it is important\nto ensure that double counting of defaults due to two or more banks granting loans to the\nsame customer is avoided. In our sample, the majority of banks adhere to the \"regional\nprinciple\" which states that banks are only allowed to serve customers within a specified\nregion. Therefore, there should be no significant distortion from the double counting of\ndefaults and the estimations should not be significantly biased. This has been assured via\nvarious robustness checks.\nThe size of the borrowers is proxied by the turnover which is published in the balance\nsheet of each borrower. The following six size categories measured in e million are chosen:\nof borrowers for each rating and size bucket. The majority of buckets is sufficiently\nfilled by borrowers; however, for the higher size categories, the number of borrowers is\ncomparatively lower.\nFigure 2: Number of average borrowers with respect to rating and size category\nFigure 3 shows the evolution of the number of borrowers and defaults, respectively, over\ntime in each turnover class. Disregarding the large increase in the number of rated\nborrowers in all turnover classes from the first to the second half of 2005, the number\nof borrowers has grown moderately for smaller borrowers and increased considerably for\nlarger enterprises. The number of defaults, as also evident from Figure 1, behaves in a\nrather volatile fashion, which can be attributed to the fact that banks usually report more\nwrite-offs at the end of the year.\nFigure 3: Semi-annual number of borrowers and defaults with respect to\nturnover class\n(a) Number of borrowers\n(b) Number of defaults\nFigure 4 illustrates the evolution of the default rates for each rating class (upper panel)\nand each turnover class (lower panel) over the considered time horizon. The highest\ndefault rates for the total sample are observed in 2005, well before the financial crisis\nstarted. This observation supports the view that German SMEs mastered the financial\ncrisis quite well. In general, the majority of empirical studies dealing with the estimation\nof asset correlations from default rates use yearly data.\nFigure 4: Semi-annual default rates in percent with respect to rating category\nand turnover class\n(a) Default rates by rating category\n(b) Default rates by turnover class\nIn order to validate the robustness of the estimation results based on semi-annual data,\nwe also aggregate the observation periods to an annual time span so as to conduct all the\nestimations with annual default rates. The main difference in yearly data is that they\nreduce the variation in the number of defaults over time. This smoothing effect is revealed\nin the time series of default rates in Figure 5 which shows the yearly default rates in each\nrating category (upper panel) as well as in each turnover class (lower panel).\nFigure 5: Annual default rates in percent with respect to rating category and\nturnover class\n(a) Default rates by rating category\n(b) Default rates by turnover class\n3 Model and Estimation Methodology\nThe analysis is based on the widely known ASRF model of Gordy (2003) that is also\nthe foundation of the IRBA risk weight functions for credit exposures in the banking\nbook. Default is triggered in this model if the ability-to-pay process Yi\nof firm i falls\nbelow an exogenous default threshold i\n. Yi\nfollows a standard normal distribution. It\ncan be decomposed into the return of a systematic and unobservable factor X and an\nidiosyncratic firm-specific part i\n:\nYi\n=\n\ni\n\u02c7 X + 1 - i\n\u02c7 i\n.\nX and i\nare independent for every obligor i and follow a Gaussian distribution. The factor\nloading\n\ni\nof the systematic risk factor can be interpreted either as the sensitivity against\nsystematic risk or as the square root of the asset correlation i\n. For this analysis the\ncommon assumption of a constant i\nis applied which is typical for such empirical studies\nas it allows this parameter to be estimated from a cross section. The Bernoulli variable\nLi\ndescribes if a credit event has occurred during the considered horizon (Li\n= 1) or not\n(Li\n= 0). It is important to differentiate between the unconditional and the conditional\ndefault probability. The unconditional default probability of obligor i for the time period\nt is defined as follows:\nP(Li\n= 1) = P(Yi\n< i\n) = (i\n)\nwhere  denotes the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal distribution.\nSince homogeneity in the obligor buckets is assumed, the index i for the distance to default\ni\nof a specific firm is dropped.\nIn this study the ML estimator advocated in Gordy and Heitfield (2002) is applied for\nretrieving the main results. The ML estimator is a very general estimator and allows for\nthe possibility that obligors in different rating and size buckets may be sensitive to different\nrisk factors. For robustness tests we employ a Method-of-Moments (MM) estimator6 and\nalso use annual time periods in addition to semi-annual ones for computing the default\nrates (see Appendix A.3\u00adA.5). The estimation methodology is described in Appendix\n6In addition we also employ the Asymptotic Maximum Likelihood Estimator that has been analysed\nby D\u00a8\nullmann et al. (2010) in small samples. The results for this estimator are available from the authors\non request.\n4.1 Asset Correlation Estimates\nTable 1: ML estimates for asset correlations and PDs (in percent)\nAsset correlation estimates\nhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nh\nRating Category\nTurnover (e m)\nPD estimates (one-year horizon)\nhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nh\nRating Category\nTurnover (e m)\nStandard errors determined analytically from asymptotic Fisher information matrices are given below in brackets.\nIn order to evaluate the relative calibration we need to consider that besides firm size\nmeasured by yearly turnover, credit quality, i.e., the rating, has also been found to be\na potential driver of the estimation of asset correlations (e.g., Hahnenstein (2004) and\nD\u00a8\nullmann and Scheule (2006)). This two-dimensional dependency is also reflected in the\ncurrent IRBA risk weight functions. Therefore, we estimate the asset correlation for a\nmatrix of rating and turnover buckets. This procedure enables us to compare capital\nrequirements for different size buckets conditional on the rating with the respective IRBA\ncapital requirements. The estimation results are presented in Table 1. Since the time\nperiods in the sample cover six months we have transformed the estimates of a half-year\nby the formula PD = 1 - (1 - PDh\n)2 into PDs for a one-year horizon. This\ntransformation is necessary for the analysis of the capital requirements since PDs in Basel\nII always refer to a one-year horizon.\nThe asset correlation estimates in Table 1 tend to increase with firm size when holding the\nrating constant. This increase, however, is not perfectly monotonic and more pronounced\nin some rating categories than in others. The level of asset correlations never exceeds two\npercent and is on average considerably below the asset correlations in the IRBA capital\nrequirements. A possible underestimation of the asset correlations could result from the\nfact that for each size and rating bucket the correlations were estimated for well-diversified\nportfolios with respect to business sectors. Since the applied time series is still relatively\nshort at seven years, as already discussed in Section 2, it is questionable whether one full\nbusiness cycle is captured in the estimations. If this is not the case, negative biases can\narise in the estimation of the asset correlations. (See for instance Gordy and Heitfield\nIn the next subsection we compare the capital requirements in Basel II dependent on\nturnover with the estimated capital requirements based on the asset correlation and PD\nestimates. Afterwards in Subsection 4.3 we evaluate the estimated capital requirements\nwith respect to the RSA. The asset correlation estimates depend not only on the turnover\nbut also on the rating. In the following we account for this two-dimensional dependence\nby weighting the IRBA or RSA risk weights with respect to the number of borrowers\nin each rating category. The advantage of this aggregation is that we can condense the\nassessment of the asset correlation estimates in a single figure.\n4.2 Evaluation of IRBA Capital Requirements\nWe consider the \"empirical risk weight function\", i.e., the risk weight function based on\nthe empirically estimated asset correlations, rather than the asset correlation estimates\nthemselves in order to assess the calibration of the IRBA capital requirements. The\ncurrent Basel II capital requirements are calculated according to the IRBA formulas.\nTurnovers above e 50 million are lumped together in a single bucket since the risk\nweight curve would remain flat above this turnover threshold (for a constant PD). For a\nturnover between e 2.5 and e 50 million we have applied the corporate risk weight function\nincluding the capital relief due to the turnover dependence of the asset correlation. The\nretail risk weight curve (Other Retail) has been applied for a turnover below e 2.5 million.7\nBy comparing the size dependence of \"estimated capital requirements\" (i.e., based on\nempirical asset correlation estimates) with the size dependence \"hard-wired\" into the\ncorresponding IRBA capital requirements we want to answer the question whether the\nsize dependence of IRBA capital requirements is appropriate in light of the new empirical\nresults. For this purpose, and for different size buckets, we consider the relative difference\nof the (estimated and Basel II) capital requirements from the corresponding capital\nrequirements of \"large\" corporates (i.e., firms with a yearly turnover higher than e 50\n7Analyses of the Bank for the Accounts of Companies Harmonised (BACH) database from the\nEuropean Committee of Central Balance Sheet Data Offices support the consideration of the first three\nturnover classes as Other Retail since the average ratio of turnover to liabilities of credit institutions\nrecent final data point.\nmillion) which serve as a benchmark8; by assumption they are correctly calibrated. If\nboth (relative) differences are negative (indicating a capital relief) and if the absolute\nvalue of the difference for the empirical estimates is higher than that of the difference\nfor the regulatory numbers, this may be interpreted as an indication that our empirical\nresults ceteris paribus would support lower Basel II capital requirements for SMEs. Table\n2 shows the estimated capital requirements and the Basel II ones in terms of risk weights.9\nTable 2: Capital requirements in terms of risk weights per rating class (in\npercent)\nEstimates\nOther Retail Corporate\nhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nh\nRating Category\nTurnover (e m)\nBasel II\nOther Retail Corporate\nhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nh\nRating Category\nTurnover (e m)\nIn order to determine the differences in capital requirements we calculate the relative\ndifference between each risk weight in all turnover classes up to e 50 million and the\ncorresponding risk weight for the largest turnover class (benchmark). As an example,\nconsider the relative difference between the estimated risk weight of turnover class (5, 50]\nand turnover class >50 in rating category I-III:\n=\n=\nThe same is done for the Basel II risk weights:\n=\n=\n8This segment comprises firms with a yearly turnover of at least e 50 million; the size adjustment in\nthe IRBA risk weight function is zero for this segment.\n9Appendix A.2.3 shows the empirical risk weight function based on estimated PDs and asset\ncorrelations.\nDoing this for each risk weight gives us the following reductions for the estimated and the\nBasel II capital requirements:\nTable 3: Relative differences in capital requirements by rating and turnover\nclass (in percent)\nEstimates\nOther Retail Corporate\nhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nh\nRating Category\nTurnover (e m)\nBasel II\nOther Retail Corporate\nhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nh\nRating Category\nTurnover (e m)\nSince the dependence of capital requirements on size and rating based on the asset\ncorrelation estimates is compared with the dependence implicit in the current IRBA risk,\ntotal differences are considered and presented in Table 4. Total differences of capital\nrequirements with respect to the benchmark \"large corporates\" are simply the absolute\ndifferences of the relative differences of the estimated capital requirements and the relative\ndifferences within Basel II. Again using the example of turnover class (5, 50] and rating\ncategory I-III the total difference of capital requirements amounts to\n= Est,I-III\nTable 4: Total differences of capital requirements in the Basel II IRBA for all\nrating and size buckets (in percent)\nOther Retail Corporate\nhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nh\nRating Category\nTurnover (e m)\nThe total differences in Table 4 vary to some extent, which means that it is difficult to\ndraw essential conclusions from this representation. Thus, for an overall assessment of\nthese results, average total differences of the capital requirements are applied in terms of a\nweighted average of all total differences for each turnover class using weights with respect\nto the number of loans per rating class. Table 5 shows all weights for each turnover class.\nTable 5: Mean weights for ratings per turnover class (in percent)\nOther Retail Corporate\nhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nh\nRating Category\nTurnover (e m)\nBy weighting the total differences with the number of obligors for each rating category,\na representative number of possible differences between Basel II and the empirical\nestimations for each turnover class is obtained in Table 6. For example, the average\ntotal difference in capital requirements for the size category (5, 50] is obtained as\nT\n= Est\nTable 6: Average total differences of capital requirements in the Basel II IRBA\n(in percent)\nOther Retail Corporate\nhhhhhhhhhhhh\nh\nDifferences\nTurnover (e m)\nTable 6 shows that the average total differences for the corporate portfolio and the retail\nportfolio move in different directions. For the retail portfolio, the gap between both\nrelative differences from the benchmark is positive but below ten percent. We define\naverage total differences below this threshold as economically insignificant. In contrast,\nfor all SME loans assigned to the corporate portfolio, the capital requirements of the\nestimated curve show significantly higher negative differences than Basel II does with a\ngap of about 22 percentage points.\nThese results for the IRBA indicate that there is a potential for increasing the relative\ndistance between the capital requirements for SME loans in the corporate portfolio and the\ncapital requirements for loans to larger corporates. This could be achieved, for example,\nby providing a capital relief for lowering the risk weights of SMEs relative to their current\ntreatment only for a certain turnover class or by adjusting the asset correlation parameters\nof the IRBA formula. In general, the results of Table 6 are not surprising and confirm\na perception already discussed when the Basel II framework was designed, namely that\nsplitting the SMEs between the corporate portfolio and the retail portfolio gave rise to a\ncliff effect between both portfolios.\n4.3 Evaluation of Capital Requirements in the Standardized\nApproach\nIn this subsection we compare the relative level of capital requirements implied by the\nasset correlation estimates with the RSA capital requirements. Table 7 calculates the\naverage total differences in the RSA. The RSA risk weight function is simply a step\nfunction with a risk weight of 100% if the firm is treated as a corporate exposure and 75%\nif it is assigned to the retail portfolio, i.e., if the exposure to the borrower does not exceed\ne 1 million which is comparable with a turnover of up to e 2.5 million (see footnote 7).\nThe results for the RSA are considerably stronger and economically more significant than\nthose for the IRB approach. The estimated capital requirements differ to a much greater\nTable 7: Average total differences of capital requirements in the RSA (in\npercent)\nOther Retail Corporate\nhhhhhhhhhhhh\nh\nDifferences\nTurnover (e m)\nextent from the benchmark \"large corporates\" (-34% up to -47%) than the regulatory\nfigures (0% up to -25%). For SMEs in the corporate portfolio, the results are directionally\nin line with those for the IRBA, but the average total differences are higher up to a level\nof 35 percentage points. In comparison to the corporate portfolio, the empirical results for\nthe SME loans in the retail portfolio indicate a lower but economically significant capital\nrelief potential between 15 and 22 percentage points. To sum up, for all loans assigned\nto the SME portfolio, the empirical results suggest that the relative reduction compared\nto large firms is significantly higher than reflected in the current capital requirements.\nBefore these results are interpreted in terms of a policy message, it needs to be considered\nthat the RSA is less risk-sensitive than the IRB approach in general which justifies a more\nconservative calibration. The robustness checks conducted support our results for possible\ncapital reliefs for SMEs and show to some extent higher effects. (Appendix A.3\u00adA.5)\n5 Policy Message\nIn our paper we have identified two cases in which our empirical results suggest that the\nrelative differences between the capital requirements for large corporates and those for\nSMEs (in other words, the capital relief for SMEs) are lower in the current regulatory\nframework than implied by our empirically estimated asset correlations. Since these\naverage total differences reflect the capital relief granted for SMEs by the regulators they\nmay indicate \u00ad in certain cases and if taken at face value \u00ad a potential for increasing this\ncapital relief. This would be equivalent to lowering the regulatory capital requirements\nfor SMEs, for instance by lowering the asset correlation values in the IRBA formula or\nby lowering the RSA risk weights directly. Before drawing this inference as the policy\nmessage of this paper, the following important caveats need to be carefully considered:\nThe RSA was deliberately calibrated more conservatively than the IRB approaches. This\ncan be explained by the significantly lower risk sensitivity of the RSA and the regulatory\nintention to retain incentives in terms of a ceteris paribus capital relief when banks switch\nto the more risk sensitive IRB approaches. The more conservative calibration is one reason\nwhy the capital requirements in the RSA are currently independent of firm size, which\nis one important driver for the empirically observed lower potential for reductions of the\ncapital requirements. It also suggests that at least a substantial part of the 15%\u00ad35%\ndifference between the current capital relief in the RSA and the capital relief implied by\nour new empirical results can be explained by this original calibration target.\nThe time series is still relatively short and the use of semi-annual rather than annual\ntime intervals for measuring the default rates does not remove the limitation that the\ndevelopment of the German economy is only captured over seven years. The substantial\nnoise in asset correlation estimates from such short time series has been well-documented,\nfor example in D\u00a8\nullmann et al. (2010) by Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, although\nthe sample period comprises the recent global financial crisis, the German SME sector\nappears to have been surprisingly unaffected.\nSince the regulatory minimum capital requirements are harmonized internationally\nnowadays, their modification appears reasonable only if the results of this study are\nalso broadly representative for other countries. This applies all the more since the\ndevelopment of the German economy during the financial crisis differs positively from\nthat in other European countries. Therefore, further analyses \u00ad possibly based on the\nsame methodology used in this paper \u00ad appear to be useful, especially for countries which\nalso have a strong SME business sector. This is left to further research.\nThe indicated potential for increasing the relative difference between risk weights for\ncertain size buckets for SMEs and risk weights for larger corporates is derived from the\ncurrent regulatory minimum capital requirements for large corporates which are assumed\nto be correctly calibrated. The assumption to use large corporates as a benchmark is well\nmotivated since, for reasons stated above (see Section 1), the study design does not allow\nus to quantify the absolute level of the minimum capital requirements. One could argue\nthat a compensation in the overall calibration of minimum capital requirements would be\nnecessary if the requirements are lowered for specific SMEs, in order to retain the overall\nlevel of capital in the banking system.\nA Appendix\nA.1 Literature Review on Asset Correlation Studies\nTable A.1: Asset correlation estimates of related studies\nStudy Data Time Period Estimation Method Estimated\nAC (in\npercent)\nAkhavein,\nKocagil, and\nNeugebauer\nRating agency data\n(Fitch Rating) on\nissuers, factor loadings\nunderlying the Fitch\nDefault Vector Model\nways: 1) estimating joint default\nprobabilities and transforming them\ninto asset correlations, 2) based on\nthe direction of rating changes, and 3)\nusing an equity-based factor model\nBams et al.\nDun & Bradstreet data\nset\nBluhm and\nOverbeck\nprobabilities and their transformation\ninto asset correlations\nCassart,\nCastro,\nLangendries,\nand\nAlderweireld\nMoody's database on\nissuer/obligator senior\nrating (corporates and\nfinancial institutions)\non the direction of rating changes.\nThey use two approaches, 1) based\non default events only (STRM), and\n2) considering all possible rating\ntransformations (DRTM)\nSTRM\napproach:\napproach: 2\nCarlos Cespedes\nand two-factor model\nDefault database on\nissuer/obligator senior\nrating (corporates and\nfinancial institutions)\nand Moody's database\non structured products\nAsset correlations are estimated for\naggregated data as well as for different\nsectors, world regions, and structured\nproducts.
