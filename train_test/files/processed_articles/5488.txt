However, those\nwho are at risk of harming themselves and\nothers and need to be closely monitored in\nterms of clinical, familial and social issues\nmay require inpatient treatment.2,3 Many\nstudies from various countries and cultures\nhave indicated that child and adolescent\ninpatient units are effective for treating\nindividuals with various psychiatric diag-\nnoses and conditions.4\u00ad8 Studies that inves-\ntigated the factors that play a role in\neffective psychiatric treatment of children\nand adolescents defined the individual char-\nacteristics of children, their parents and\nfamily, severity of psychiatric symptoms,\npsychiatric diagnosis, presence of comorbid-\nity and treatment method implemented,\nalong with the characteristics of the treat-\nment team as predictors of improvement.9\u00ad13\nAlthough previous studies have investigated\nthe outcomes of inpatient treatment of chil-\ndren and adolescents regarding improvement\nof general functioning and the continuity\nof this effect,8,14 factors affecting this\nimprovement have not been widely studied.\nTherefore, this study aimed to assess the\ncorrelates and predictors of improvement in\ngeneral functioning of children and adoles-\ncents who are treated in the child and ado-\nlescent psychiatry (CAMHS) inpatient unit.\nMaterials and methods\nThis study was approved by the Dokuz Eylul\nUniversity Medical Sciences Research Ethics\nCommittee.\nPatients and procedure\nAll children and adolescents who received\ntreatment at Dokuz Eylul University in the\nwere included in the study. This unit,\nwhich is located in Izmir Turkey, was\nfounded in 2005. This unit has the capacity\nto treat 15 children and adolescents at the\nsame time, with more beds for girls than\nboys. As a member of the Quality Network\nwhich is an initiative of the Royal College of\nPsychiatrist in the United Kingdom, this\nunit provides milieu therapy in conjunction\nwith medical and other therapeutic inter-\nventions in accordance with the patients'\nneeds.\nThe inclusion criteria of the study were\nat least 1 month of stay in the unit, receiving\nat least one axis I diagnosis according to\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text\nRevision (DSM-IV-TR),15 and being dis-\ncharged following planned procedures.\nAdditionally, those who had an increase in\nthe CGAS score at discharge compared with\nadmission were included.\nData were collected retrospectively from\nthe hospital records. Sociodemographic and\nfamily variables, clinical diagnosis based on\nDSM-IV-TR criteria and refined with the\nconsensus of the team members, the pres-\nence of comorbid psychiatric diagnosis and\nthe duration of treatment were noted on the\ndata collection sheet that was developed for\nthe purposes of this study. Additionally,\nindividual and familial risk scores, which\nwere routinely calculated at admission and\nCGAS scores at admission and discharge\nwere recorded. The difference between\nadmission and discharge CGAS scores con-\nstituted the \u00c1CGAS score.\nMaterials\nChildren's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS). The\nCGAS is an adaptation of the Global\nAssessment Scale and was designed to reflect\nthe level of functioning for a child or adoles-\ncent during a specified time period.16\nClinicians evaluated the child's functionality\nunder 10 sections with values ranging from\n1 to 100. Increasing scores indicate a better\ngeneral functionality.16 Shaffer et al.16\nadopted the Global Assessment Scale for\nadults to be used for children and adolescents\nand demonstrated that the CGAS is a useful\nmeasure of overall severity of disturbance.\nThis scale was found to be reliable between\nraters and across time with discriminant and\nconcurrent validity. The CGAS is widely\nIndividual and familial risk assessment. Risk\nassessment was performed by risk evalu-\nation forms that were developed by the\ninpatient unit in accordance with the\nQNIC norms. They were routinely applied\nto all patients at admission. The individual\nrisk assessment included a history of violent\nbehaviour, using sharp objects and/or a\nweapon, threatening behaviour, destroying/\nharming property, hurting animals, illegal\nbehaviour/punishment, self-harm, suicidal\nthoughts/attempts recently, using alcohol/\nsubstances, abuse (emotional, physical,\nsexual), inappropriate sexual behaviour,\nand the presence of any physical disability.\nThe total risk score was calculated out of 12\nand higher scores indicated higher risks.\nFamily risk assessment included items\ninquiring about insufficient supervision at\nhome, conflicts in the family, a lack of\ncooperation with school, unemployment/\npoverty in the family, a history of psychi-\natric disorder, self-harm/suicide in the\nfamily, a lack of social support and the\npresence of unemployment/poverty in the\nenvironment of the family. The total risk\nscore was calculated out of 8 and higher\nscores indicated higher risks.\nStatistical analysis\nSPSS Windows 22.0 packaged software was\nused for analysis.17 In addition to descriptive\nanalysis of data, Spearman's correlation was\nused to investigate the correlation of descrip-\ntive variables with the \u00c1CGAS. A multi-\nvariate linear regression model was used\nwith the \u00c1CGAS as the dependent variable\nto further clarify the predictive effects of\nvarious factors. A p value 0.05 was con-\nsidered to be significant in all analyses.\nResults\nthe inclusion criteria of duration of hospi-\ntalization and process of planned discharge.\nEighty-one patients were excluded from the\nstudy because of a shorter stay less than a\nmonth and/or unplanned discharge. CGAS\nvalues of 17 of the included patients could\nnot be found in the hospital records. Three\npatients were excluded from the study\nbecause they lacked any axis I diagnosis\naccording to DSM-IV-TR. Only one patient\nhad a negative \u00c1CGAS score at discharge\nand he was excluded from the study.\nAmong the remaining 287 patients,\nwere boys.

Older age and lower CGAS\nscores at admission predicted higher \u00c1CGAS\np< 0.001, respectively). However, a high famil-\nial risk score and having the diagnosis of early-\nonset schizophrenia were negative predictors\nDiscussion\nThis study assessed factors that were asso-\nciated with improvement in general\nfunctioning of children and adolescents\nwho were treated in the CAMHS inpatient\nunit. We found that older age and lower\ngeneral functioning at admission were pre-\ndictors of better improvement in terms of\ngeneral functionality. However, high famil-\nial risk factors and the diagnosis of early-\nonset schizophrenia were associated with\nlower gains in general functioning during\ninpatient treatment of children and\nadolescents.\nOur finding that older age was associated\nwith better improvement in general func-\ntioning during inpatient treatment of the\nyouth is in accordance with limited literature\non the outcomes of inpatient treatment at\nresponse to treatment can be hampered\nbecause of associated developmental issues\nin younger children. Additionally, early-\nonset psychopathologies in the child and\nadolescent age group generally have a worse\noutcome, whereas later onset is associated\nwith a better course. Therefore, older age\nand a higher positive change in general\nfunctioning in our sample is consistent\nAn interesting finding of this study is that\nlow-functioning individuals benefited more\nin terms of their general functioning during\ninpatient treatment. Although this initially\nappears contradictory, it is consistent with\nstudies from various cultures, which showed\nthat children and adolescents with a higher\nloss of functionality benefit more from\nTable 1.

Early-onset schizophrenia is\na more severe variant of the adult-onset form,\nwhich might be associated with poor quality\nof life and long-term general functioning.\nAlthough patients show improvement with\neffective psychiatric treatment, the rate of\nprogress may not be more than that of other\npsychopathologies in this age group.21,27\nOur study has some limitations. Changes\nin general functioning were assessed with the\nCGAS, which is based on clinicians' evalu-\nations. Inclusion of instruments that deter-\nmine the patients' and their parents' opinions\nmay provide more comprehensive data. The\nsingle centre and retrospective design may be\nother limitations of this study. Interpretation\nof our data requires caution in this respect.\nDespite the limitations of this study, this\nstudy shows that age, level of functioning at\nadmission, familial risk factors and the\ndiagnosis of early onset-schizophrenia are\nsignificant factors affecting the improvement\nof general functionality during psychiatric\ninpatient treatment of children and adoles-\ncents. Further studies on additional factors\nmay help to enhance inpatient psychiatric\ntreatment of youth because failure to provide\nappropriate treatment results in long-lasting\ndifficulties in various functional areas.\n"
