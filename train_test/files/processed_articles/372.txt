One in every 6 American adults recently reported hav-\ning hearing trouble, and prevalence rises with age to reach half\nof individuals aged 75 or more years (1).

The ``gold standard'' for\nmeasurement of hearing status is audiometry; however, au-\ndiometric testing among nationally representative samples\nhas been conducted relatively infrequently (10).

The lack of consistency in eliciting self-\nreported hearing status makes it challenging to assess long-\nterm trends in the prevalence of hearing loss among adults in\nthe United States.\nIn this study, we use partial data on audiometric testing to\nexamine and correct for biases in self-reports on hearing and\ndevelop valid estimates of levels and trends in the prevalence\nData were obtained from interviews and examinations in\n4 nationally representative survey series conducted between\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES),\nthese surveys were conducted on stratified multistage prob-\nability samples of the civilian noninstitutionalized popula-\ntion in the United States. A summary of the data sources is\nprovided in Table 1.\nMeasured data were obtained from the pure-tone air con-\nduction audiometry performed in 3 cycles of NHANES IV,\nhalf of the sample of adults aged 20\u00ad69 years were ran-\ndomly selected for testing. Participants were excluded from\naudiometric tests if they wore hearing aids and could not\nremove them for testing or if they had ear pain and could not\ntolerate headphones. The eligible sample size was 1,807 in\n(24). Procedures for collecting the audiometric data have\nbeen detailed elsewhere (10). In summary, an audiometry test\nwas performed by trained personnel in a sound-isolated room\nin the mobile examination center. Hearing threshold testing\nwas conducted on both ears of examinees at 7 frequencies\nAccording to the classification by the World Health\nOrganization, measured bilateral hearing loss was defined\nin this study as a value greater than 25 dB of the pure-tone\naverage of audiometric hearing thresholds at the speech\nTo be consistent with the definitions for measured hearing,\nself-reported bilateral hearing loss was defined as use of\nhearing aids in both ears or decreased hearing in the better\near.

Of the 5,742 respondents eligible for inclusion in\nthe audiometry examination of NHANES IV, 324 (6%) were\nexcluded from analysis because a test was not done at all,\nand 119 (2%) were excluded because of missing values. The\nfinal sample size with audiometric measurements was 5,299,\naccounting for 0.5% of the entire pooled sample.\nAs a preliminary descriptive analysis, the prevalence of\nmeasured or self-reported hearing loss among people aged\n20\u00ad69 years was computed directly from individual surveys\nby sex and year to characterize variation in prevalence esti-\nmates across surveys.\nNext, unit record data of all surveys were merged to in-\nvestigate differences in self-reports due to variation in\nSurvey (Year) Data Files Year Recodes\nfull-year files\nAnnual, as is\nperson questionnaire,\naudiometry examination\ncomponent\nrecord\nAnnual, as is\nadult file\nAnnual, as is\nAbbreviations: MEPS, Medical Expenditure Panel Survey; NHANES, National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey; NHIS, National Health Interview Survey; SIPP, Survey of Income\nand Program Participation.\nTrends in the Prevalence of Hearing Loss in US Adults 81\nquestion wording across surveys.

Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.\nPrevious studies indicated that self-reports may underes-\ntimate the prevalence of hearing loss (11, 21, 22). We found\nthat directions and patterns of bias varied by the wording\nand response scales of survey instruments. Overreporting of\nhearing loss is particularly pronounced in NHANES IV self-\nreports--as observed previously (11)--and in NHIS after\n1997. These findings might be partly attributable to the\nuse of a scaled response question, presumably resulting in\nworse accuracy against audiometry than self-reports based\non ``yes''/``no'' questions. Another possible factor is the\nlack of specification of which ear in the question. In these\nsurveys, a substantial fraction of people reported mildly\nTable 5.

One explanation for the underreporting\nof hearing loss in SIPP is that the question relating to hear-\ning a normal conversation did not easily accommodate the\n``slight impairment,'' i.e., inability to hear whispers, refer-\nenced in the World Health Organization classification (27).\nPeople who have problems in hearing whispers might not\nreport the impairment if they could hear a normal conver-\nsation with another person.\nAnother key finding of our study is that biases in self-\nreports may vary systematically with age. The likelihood of\nreporting hearing loss relative to audiometric tests attenuates\nwith increasing age. A possible interpretation is that expect-\nations for hearing decline with advancing age, which makes\nolder individuals less likely than younger ones to report hear-\ning loss. The large sample sizes in this study allowed us to\nestimate separate regressions by age group in order to char-\nacterize these varying patterns. If our approach were applied\nto smaller data sets, pooling across age groups might be\nnecessary for statistical power, which would add some con-\nstraints to the types of inference that could be made.\nA previous study has proposed tracking population health\nover time by using data on self-reported symptoms and\nimpairments from nationally representative surveys in the\nUnited States (31). Our results on survey-specific biases in\nself-reported hearing status reinforce the need for caution in\ninterpreting and comparing self-reports in different surveys.\nNevertheless, our findings indicate that partial data on mea-\nsured performance may be exploited successfully to correct\nfor these differences. This approach may have general utility\nfor enhancing the comparability of various health impair-\nments and symptoms measured with self-reports and, thus,\nfor improving the validity of monitoring long-term trends in\npopulation health.\nOur analysis has various limitations that should be noted.\nFirst, the survey samples exclude military personnel, resi-\ndents in institutions, and individuals aged 70 or more years,\nwhich may result in an underestimate of hearing loss preva-\nlence. Second, our model assumes that biases in self-reported\nhearing loss are constant over time within any given survey\n(barring changes in survey methods or items). This assump-\ntion will be overly restrictive if expectations have shifted over\nthe duration of a particular survey's implementation. Further\naccumulation of data including audiometric measurements\nwould enable empirical testing of this assumption based on\nmore flexible models. Meanwhile, the fact that identical ques-\ntion wording was preserved within each survey provides\nsome reassurance that this simplifying assumption may be\nreasonable.\nFrom a public health perspective, several plausible hypoth-\neses on the causes of declines in the prevalence of hearing\nloss in the 1990s might warrant further empirical investiga-\ntion. One explanation might be decreased incidence of noise-\ninduced hearing loss. Noise was reported to be the most\nfrequent cause of hearing impairment in US adults aged less\nnoise regulations, exposures to hazardous levels of noise de-\ncreased, and the use of hearing protection devices increased\nin the manufacturing and coal mining sectors (32, 33). Given\nthat hearing loss is still highly prevalent in the industrial\nsectors involving hazardous noise (34), however, further cor-\nporate and governmental efforts at hearing conservation\nmight be beneficial. Another possible explanation for de-\ncreased prevalence of hearing loss during the 1990s is im-\nprovement in screening and use of hearing aids, although to\nour knowledge there is no evidence that detection and treat-\nment of hearing impairment increased dramatically during\nthe period.\nEstimates of the prevalence of hearing loss from self-\nreport must be evaluated with caution because of differential\nbiases across age groups and surveys. However, correction\nof these biases is possible if audiometric measurements are\navailable from at least 1 survey, and if survey periods par-\ntially overlap with each other. Hearing loss remains an im-\nportant public health problem in the United States.\nFollowing the decline in the prevalence of bilateral hearing\nloss at the speech frequencies during the 1990s, more recent\ntrends have been stable in both adult men and women. Fur-\nther strategies to promote prevention of hearing loss at work\nand in communities may be needed to resume progress in\nreducing the burden of hearing loss.\n"
