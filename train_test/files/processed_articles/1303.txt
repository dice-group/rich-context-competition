Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America.\n \nONLY half of older adults in the United States with\na probable diagnosis of depression, anxiety, or psy-\nchotic disorder use mental health services (Klap, Unroe, &\nUn\u00fctzer, 2003). Perceiving need for mental health care\n(MHC) is an important step in deciding whether to seek\ntreatment (Mechanic, 1978; Mojtabai, Olfson, & Mechanic,\n2002), but little is known about how older adults determine\ntheir need for MHC. Existing studies either exclude elderly\npeople (Katz, Kessler, Frank, Leaf, & Lin, 1997; Mojtabai\net al.), do not account for subsyndromal conditions (Klap\net al.; Meadows et al., 2002), or use care utilization as a\nproxy for perceived need (Mojtabai et al.; Rabinowitz,\nGross, & Feldman, 1999). Not everyone who receives MHC\nmay perceive a need for care; others may demand that a\nperson utilize mental health services (Edlund, Un\u00fctzer, &\nCurran, 2006). In this study, we examine the relationship of\nperceived need for MHC (regardless of utilization rates)\nwith past-year mental illness, history of mental and physical\nillness, subsyndromal conditions, and history of alcohol\nabuse and/or dependence.\nOur study is based on principles from the common\nsense model of illness representation (CSM; Diefenbach &\nLeventhal, 1996). The CSM states that individuals make\ntreatment decisions based on illness beliefs regarding symp-\ntom identity, acuity and/or chronicity, severity, causes, and\ncontrollability. These beliefs are influenced by prior experi-\nence with a condition and information from social network\nmembers. From this model, we believe history and severity\nof mental illness, chronic physical illness history, alcohol\nabuse, attitudes toward MHC, and social support will influ-\nence perceived need for MHC in older adults.\nMental illness history may increase likelihood of per-\nceived need for MHC in two ways. First, individuals with a\nhistory of depression or anxiety who currently meet diag-\nnostic criteria for one of the two conditions might draw on\nprevious experience with the condition and infer that they\nshould use care (Howard Leventhal, personal communica-\ntory of depression or anxiety who do not currently meet\ndiagnostic criteria for either disorder might feel continued\ntreatment is necessary for maintaining current health status.\nHistory of depression and history of anxiety are related to\nMHC utilization in the general population (Burns, Wagner,\nthe relationship between history of mental illness and per-\nceived need in older adults is unclear.\nAdditionally, subsyndromal depression and anxiety and\ngreater numbers of depression or anxiety symptoms might be\nassociated with perceived need for care. Subsyndromal levels\nof depression and anxiety are associated with physical dis-\nability and poor physical health, in some cases to the same\ndegree as major depressive disorder (MDD) or generalized\nanxiety disorder (GAD; Beekman, Deeg, Braam, Smit, &\nKlerman, 1992). Furthermore, it is likely more difficult to\nignore or explain away symptoms as they proliferate; having\nmore co-occurring adverse symptoms may encourage indi-\nviduals to view symptom clusters as medical conditions war-\nranting treatment. Greater numbers of depression and GAD\nsymptoms are associated with higher odds of perceived need\nfor depression treatment in younger adults with probable de-\nIn addition to mental illness history, physical illness his-\ntory may be related to perceived need for MHC.

We used logistic regression to examine relationships among depres-\nsion, anxiety, chronic physical illness, alcohol abuse and/or dependence, sociodemographics, and perceived need\namong a national sample of community-dwelling individuals 65 years of age and older (the Collaborative Psychiat-\nric Epidemiology Surveys data set). Less than half of respondents with depression or anxiety perceived a need for\ncare. Perceived need was greater for respondents with more symptoms of depression regardless of whether they met\ndiagnostic criteria for a mental illness. History of chronic physical conditions, history of depression or anxiety, and\nmore severe mental illness were associated with greater perceived need for MHC. Future studies of perceived need\nshould account for individual perceptions of mental illness and treatment and the influence of social networks.\nKey Words: Anxiety--Attitudes--Beliefs--Depression--Mental health.\nsymptoms is associated with greater perceived need for\nperience with chronic conditions likely reflects experience\nreceiving medical treatment, whereas self-rated health is\nonly indirectly associated with treatment experience. Prior\nexperience (good or bad) with mental health treatment is\nrelated to greater odds of perceived need for care in younger\nadults (Van Voorhees et al., 2006). Furthermore, lower utili-\nzation of mental health services occurs in those without a\nregular source of medical care (Leaf et al., 1985). A history\nof receiving treatment for any condition may lead individu-\nals to medicalize symptoms and believe that mental health\nservices are beneficial.\nLittle is known about the association of alcohol abuse and/\nor dependence with perceived need for MHC in older adults.\nThere is mixed evidence as to whether alcohol abuse itself\nincreases the likelihood of perceived need for MHC (Edlund\n& Yu, 2005). The relationship may depend on abuse and/or\ndependence severity and whether comorbid mental illnesses\nare present. In people with mental illnesses, subclinical alco-\nhol dependence symptoms are related to lower odds of MHC\nuse, but three or more symptoms of alcohol dependence are\nrelated to greater odds of care use (Wu, Kouzis, & Leaf,\n1999). This suggests that people with some depressive symp-\ntoms who do not meet criteria for alcohol dependence may\nuse alcohol to self-medicate. If alcohol ameliorates the symp-\ntoms of anxiety or depression, individuals might not perceive\na need for mental health treatment. Once they are dependent\non alcohol, however, self-medication may be ineffective and\nlead to perceived need for treatment.\nIn addition to illness characteristics, social support may\naffect perceived need for MHC. Ill people often turn to so-\ncial network members to compare symptoms and experi-\nences and to discover where others have sought treatment\n(Leventhal, Musumeci, & Leventhal, 2008). Additionally,\nthose with supportive networks might feel their needs are\nmet within the network and may have decreased perceived\nneed for formal treatment. Little is known about the rela-\ntionship between social network quality and perceived need\nfor care in older adults, although better quality social sup-\nport is related to less utilization of physical health care and\nMHC in younger populations (Broadhead, Gehlbach, de-\nAttitudes toward MHC are another important determinant\nof perceived need. Fear of stigma, negative views of others\nwith mental illness, lack of confidence in mental health ser-\nvices, and fear of medication side effects are reasons people\ndo not seek MHC (Cooper-Patrick et al., 1997; Robb, Haley,\nBecker, Polivka, & Chwa, 2003; Segal, Coolidge, Mincic, &\nO'Riley, 2005). Positive attitudes toward MHC are correlated\nwith greater likelihood of perceived need for care in younger\nFinally, sociodemographic characteristics are also associ-\nated with perceived need. Some evidence suggests that rates of\nperceived need are highest among middle-aged adults (Edlund\nMojtabai et al., 2002). Racial differences in perceived need are\nnot always found (Edlund et al.; Meadows et al.; Mojtabai\net al.), but some have found lower rates of perceived need in\nAsians than in Whites (Sareen et al., 2005).\nTo examine relationships among perceived need and\nmental and physical health, we used cross-sectional data\nfrom the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys\n(CPES), which surveyed community-dwelling adults\nthroughout the contiguous United States about their mental\nhealth symptoms and health service utilization. We expected\nto see greater odds of perceived need for MHC among older\nadults with more severe past-year or history of mental ill-\nness, a history of greater numbers of chronic physical con-\nditions, and a history of alcohol abuse or dependence.\nInformation on attitudes toward care and consistent mea-\nsures of social support were not available for all members of\nour sample and were excluded from analyses.\nMethods\nThe CPES merges data collected between 2001 and\n2003 from three large studies of mental health: the Na-\ntional Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), the Na-\ntional Survey of American Life (NSAL), and the National\nLatino and Asian American Study (NLAAS). Samples\nwere obtained via four stages: Metropolitan Statistical Ar-\neas (MSAs) and counties, segments within each primary\nstage, households within segments, and random selection\nof one respondent per household (Heeringa et al., 2004).\n(In 20% of the NCS-R households, two adults were inter-\nviewed.) The data include sampling weights to account for\ndifferent probabilities of selection among survey compo-\nnents and oversampling of racial and ethnic minorities.\nFurther details of the survey methods are described else-\nwhere (Heeringa et al.; Kessler et al., 2004).\nof whom are 65 years of age or older. We excluded NCS-R\nrespondents who responded to a shortened version of the sur-\nvey, and only 25% of NLAAS respondents were asked about\nperceived need in order to reduce respondent burden for a fi-\nNSAL: n = 559). We retained the small set of NLAAS re-\nspondents to increase the racial diversity of the sample.\nSample demographics match national demographics from\nthe 2000 United States Census. According to the census,\n83.6% of the U.S. population is White non-Latino, 8.1% is\nAfrican American, and 44.5% is male (United States Census,\nAfrican American, and 42.9% male respondents.\nVariables\nThe dependent variable was perceived need for MHC in the\npast 12 months, and the explanatory variables were diagnoses\nand symptoms of mental illness, number of chronic physical\nillnesses, history of alcohol abuse and/or dependence symp-\ntoms, and sociodemographic characteristics.\nPerceived need for MHC.--Respondents who received\nMHC in the past 12 months (from a psychiatrist, psycholo-\ngist, social worker, counselor, physical health care provider,\nreligious or spiritual provider, or alternative medicine prac-\ntitioner) were asked if they sought care voluntarily. Respon-\ndents who did not receive MHC in the past year were asked\nif they felt a need to seek professional care for emotional or\nsubstance abuse issues. Consistent with another study of\nperceived need among NCS respondents (Katz et al., 1997),\nwe categorized respondents as perceiving a need for care if\nthey indicated care seeking was voluntary or if they felt they\nneeded to see a mental health professional. Of those who\nperceived need for care, there is likely a difference between\nthose who used care and did not use care, but the analysis of\nthis difference is beyond the scope of this article.\nPrevalence and severity of depression and anxiety.--\nProbable diagnoses were ascertained with algorithms from\nthe World Mental Health (WMH) Survey Initiative's adap-\ntation of the World Health Organization (WHO) Composite\nInternational Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0; Kessler &\n\u00dcst\u00fcn, 2004). These algorithms determined whether re-\nspondents met the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Men-\ntal Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria (without hierarchy) for\nMDD, dysthymia, GAD, and/or another anxiety disorder\n(post-traumatic stress disorder, agoraphobia with or without\npanic disorder, panic attack, panic disorder, and social pho-\nbia; American Psychological Association [APA], 1994).\n(Information on other anxiety disorders such as obsessive\u00ad\ncompulsive disorder or specific phobia was not available for\nmost respondents in our data set.) We characterized respon-\ndents' mental illness experience with two variables: \"past\nyear,\" which refers to those who met diagnostic criteria for\na disorder in the past 12 months (regardless of other, earlier\nexperience with mental illness) and \"history,\" which refers\nto those who satisfied lifetime diagnostic criteria for a dis-\norder but who did not meet that criterion in the past year.\nHistory among those who had met past-year diagnostic cri-\nteria was not available. All diagnoses and time periods refer\nto algorithms within the CIDI; none are self-reported. The\nWMH CIDI 3.0 was designed for epidemiological studies\nand has good concordance with the Structured Clinical In-\nterview for DSM-IV (SCID) for diagnosing any anxiety dis-\norder (area under receiver-operating characteristic curve\nIn addition to diagnostic criteria, we counted the num-\nber of symptoms of depression and GAD in the WMH\nCIDI. Depression symptoms included depressed mood,\nanhedonia, weight gain or loss, difficulties sleeping, psy-\nchomotor agitation or slowing, fatigue, feelings of worth-\nlessness, difficulty concentrating, and suicidal ideation.\nRespondents were asked about depression symptoms if\nthey reported ever having at least one 2-week period of\ndepression or a year or more with several shorter periods\nof depression; they were asked about symptoms that oc-\ncurred during the worst episode of depression they experi-\nenced in their lifetimes. All others were coded as having\nzero symptoms. GAD symptoms included occupation with\nnervousness or worries, restlessness, fatigue, irritability,\ndifficulty concentrating, muscle fatigue, and difficulty\nsleeping. Symptoms referred to those that occurred during\nthe worst episode of anxiety they experienced in their life-\ntimes; respondents without a worst episode were coded as\nhaving zero symptoms. Full lists of symptoms specific to\npast-year episodes were unavailable. Because the meaning\nof the number of symptoms of non-GAD anxiety disorders\ncould vary widely depending on the disorder, we did not\ninclude a symptom count variable for these disorders.\nWe constructed new algorithms for diagnoses of sub-\nsyndromal GAD and minor depression over respondents'\nlifetimes. We modeled subsyndromal GAD diagnoses af-\nter a previous study of the condition (Carter, Wittchen,\nPfister, & Kessler, 2001) and the minor depression diag-\nnoses reflect DSM-IV criteria for further study (APA,\n1994). The symptoms reported for these conditions were\nreported during respondents' worst-ever episode of de-\npression or anxiety.\nPeople tend to report fewer symptoms of past episodes of\ndepression with time and are less likely to report symptoms\nwhen they are not experiencing psychological distress\n(Aneshensel, Estrada, Hansell, & Clark, 1987). Perception of\nseverity and number of symptoms that respondents recall ex-\nperiencing are likely important factors influencing perceived\nneed, regardless of whether recall is perfectly accurate.\nPhysical health and cognitive functioning.--Respondents\nwere asked if a health professional had ever told them they\nhad heart troubles, ulcers, cancer, hypertension, diabetes,\nasthma, or chronic lung disease; we summed the number of\nconditions reported. Numbers of chronic conditions are\ncorrelated with length of hospital stay, increased physical\nlimitations, and increased mortality (Elixhauser, Steiner,\nHarris, & Coffey, 1998;Verbrugge, Lepkowski, & Imanaka,\nBecause a global measure of self-assessed health was not\navailable, we substituted a measure of functional limitation.\nFunctional limitations are highly correlated with self-assessed\nhealth (Mora, DiBonaventura, Idler, Leventhal, & Leventhal,\n2008). Cognitive functioning, self-care ability, and mobility\nwere measured by the World Health Organization Disability\nAssessment Schedule II (WHO-DAS II; Kessler et al., 2003;\nWHO, 2001). Scores are a product of frequency (number of\ndays) and severity of problems (none, mild, moderate, severe)\nrespondents reported experiencing in the past 30 days and are\nnormalized to have values ranging from 0 to 100, where\nhigher numbers indicate worse functioning. We transformed\nthe scores into z scores in the multivariate analyses.\nPrevalence of alcohol abuse and/or dependence.--Past-\nyear, historical, and lifetime diagnoses of alcohol abuse and\ndependence were assessed by the WMH CIDI. The WMH\nCIDI and SCID have good specificity for diagnoses of alco-\nKessler et al., 2005). We also counted the number of alcohol\nabuse and dependence symptoms ever experienced. Depen-\ndence symptoms included tolerance, withdrawal, drinking\nor becoming drunk when unintended, inability to reduce\ndrinking, spending many days recovering from drinking,\ndrinking instead of doing social activities or working, and\ndrinking although knowing it was leading to health prob-\nlems. Abuse symptoms included failure to fulfill role obli-\ngations, use in dangerous settings, and continued use despite\nsocial problems.\nSociodemographics.--Sociodemographics included age,\nsex, race (White non-Latino, African American and\nAfro-Caribbean, and other), marital status, education,\nhousehold size, and poverty index. The poverty index is\nthe ratio of household income to the poverty threshold\nused in the 2001 Census (adjusted for household size).\nAnalyses\nAnalyses were performed with SAS-callable SUDAAN.\nMultivariate logistic regression was used to examine rela-\ntionships among illness characteristics, sociodemographics,\nand perceived need for care. Variables were entered simul-\ntaneously in all models; only variables that were present in\neach component of the CPES were included in our analyses.\nThe regression was run separately with the entire sample for\ntwo different sets of mental health variables: a diagnosis\nmodel with variables for past-year and history of mental\nillness diagnoses, and a symptom model with counts of\nsymptoms occurring during the worst episode of illness re-\nspondents had experienced in their lives. Due to small cell\nsizes, lifetime diagnoses for minor depression, dysthymia,\nand alcohol abuse and/or dependence were excluded from\nanalyses. The relatively low prevalence of co-occurring\nmental illnesses, perceived need, and alcohol abuse pre-\ncluded us from examining interaction terms in the complete\nmodels. An additional model was run on the subsample of\nrespondents who never met diagnostic criteria for depres-\nsion or anxiety to explore relationships possibly obscured\nby the strong relationship between diagnosis and perceived\nneed for care. We tested for interactions between depression\nand/or anxiety and alcohol abuse and/or dependence in\nmodels unadjusted for physical health or sociodemograph-\nics. Akaike's information criterion with a second-order cor-\nrection (AICc) for small sample sizes was used to compare\nResults\nThe mean age of respondents was 74.6 years, and 9.3%\nwere 85 years of age or older. Few (2.5%) respondents met\npast-year diagnostic criteria for MDD, but 6.9% of respon-\ndents had a history of MDD. Only 2.3% had met criteria\nfor minor depression at some point in their lives. Of those\nwho reported at least one episode of depression over their\nlifetimes, the mean number of symptoms reported was 0.8\nfor GAD in the past year, but 2.7% had a history of GAD and\n5.1% met criteria for subthreshold GAD at some point in\ntheir lives. Of those who recalled an episode of anxiety dur-\ning their lifetime, the mean number of symptoms reported\nwas 0.6 (SE = 0.1, range = 0\u00ad7). Past-year diagnostic criteria\nfor non-GAD anxiety disorders were met by 5.4% of respon-\ndents; historical diagnostic criteria were met by 13.7%. Of\nthe sample, 4.6% reported any symptoms of alcohol abuse\nand/or dependence over their lifetime. Respondents experi-\nenced a mean of 1.3 chronic physical conditions (SE = 0.1).\nOf the entire sample, 7.3% (157) perceived a need for\nMHC in the past year. Of those who perceived a need for\nprimary care provider or mental health specialist in the past\nnot receive care. In bivariate analyses, perceived need for\ncare was less likely as age increased, and it was more likely\nto be reported by women and unmarried respondents (Table 1).\nPerceived need was more likely for respondents with MDD,\ndysthymia, GAD, subthreshold GAD, and other anxiety dis-\norders than for those without diagnoses, but not everyone\nwho met diagnostic criteria perceived a need for care. Half\nof respondents who met diagnostic criteria for MDD or\nGAD in the past year perceived a need for care. Conversely,\n4.7% of those who did not meet criteria for depression or\nanxiety in the past year perceived a need for care.\nPeople with perceived need had significantly more de-\nSE = 0.3) at some point in their lifetimes than those who did\nnot perceive need (depression: M = 0.7, SE = 0.1; GAD:\nM = 0.5, SE = 0.1). Perceived need also was more likely\namong respondents reporting any alcohol abuse and/or depen-\ndence symptoms than among those without any symptoms.\nTests for interactions between depression and alcohol\nabuse and/or dependence in models unadjusted for physical\nhealth or sociodemographics failed to find significant results.\nThere was, however, a significant interaction between past-\nyear GAD and number of alcohol abuse and/or dependence\nsymptoms. In this model, alcohol symptoms alone were not\nrelated to perceived need, but past-year GAD and past-year\nGAD with alcohol abuse and/or dependence symptoms were\nassociated with greater likelihood of perceived need (odds\nRespondents with worse WHO-DAS cognitive function-\ning and mobility scores were more likely to perceive need\nTable 1.

The odds of reporting perceived need were higher\nwith greater numbers of chronic physical conditions ever\nexperienced.\nMultivariate Analyses\nIn multivariate logistic regression analyses, model fit was\nslightly better when symptoms over the respondent's lifetimes\nwere included as regressors (AICc = 568.0) rather than past-\nyear diagnoses and history of diagnoses (AICc = 579.1).\nDiagnosis model.--When the model included past-year\nand historical diagnoses of depression and anxiety, both\npast-year MDD and history of MDD were significantly re-\nlated to perceived need (Table 2). Past-year GAD was re-\nlated to perceived need, but history of GAD was not.\nLifetime incidence of subthreshold GAD was related to\nhigher odds of perceived need. Respondents with past-year\nand history of a non-GAD anxiety disorder were more like-\nly to perceive a need for care than those without an anxiety\ndisorder. The number of chronic conditions ever experi-\nenced was related to perceived need as well.\nSymptom model.--When the model substituted counts of\nMDD and GAD symptoms experienced during worst life-\ntime episodes of illness for diagnoses, the odds of perceiv-\ning a need for MHC were higher with more depression\nsymptoms and more GAD symptoms (Table 2). As in the\ndiagnosis model, the odds of perceived need for care were\nhigher when respondents had a past-year anxiety disorder\nother than GAD and when respondents had a lifetime his-\ntory of more chronic physical conditions. Unlike the diag-\nnosis model, however, history of non-GAD anxiety was not\nrelated to perceived need in the symptom model. Perceived\nneed was more likely for those who had ever experienced\nsymptoms of alcohol abuse and/or dependence. Men were\nhalf as likely to report perceived need as women.\nPerceived need among those without depression and/or\nanxiety.--Among respondents who had never met diagnos-\ntic criteria for depression or anxiety, the number of depres-\nsion symptoms was still significantly related to perceived need\n(Table 2). Anxiety symptoms, however, were not related to\nperceived need. Additionally, men were less likely to per-\nceive a need for care than women, and respondents with a\nhistory of more chronic physical conditions were more like-\nly to report perceived need.\nDiscussion\nAs predicted, respondents with more severe mental ill-\nnesses, a history of depression or anxiety, and/or a history\nof chronic physical illnesses and alcohol abuse and/or de-\npendence symptoms were more likely to perceive a need for\nMHC. Past experience with illnesses and treatment, in addi-\ntion to symptom severity, may influence individuals' per-\nceptions of control over depression and anxiety and thus\ninfluence perceptions of need for formal MHC according to\nA history of depression or non-GAD anxiety was associ-\nated with higher odds of perceived need. This suggests that\nolder adults whose mental health condition has improved\naccording to diagnostic criteria may still experience distress\nor feel they could benefit from further treatment. Alterna-\ntively, according to the CSM, those who met past-year diag-\nnostic criteria for depression or anxiety and have a history\nof the disorder may draw on past experience with the condi-\ntion to evaluate how they might rid themselves of the symp-\ntoms most quickly and be more likely to perceive a need for\nMHC (Howard Leventhal, personal communication, Octo-\nof their present condition. From these data, we could not\ndetermine the relationship of history and perceived need for\nthose with past-year depression and/or anxiety nor could we\ndetermine whether respondents had received treatment for\nthe specific past episodes they reported.\nPeople meeting diagnostic criteria for MDD or GAD had\nhigher odds of perceived need than those with subsyndromal\nconditions, but subthreshold GAD and number of depres-\nsion and anxiety symptoms were still significantly associ-\nated with perceived need. These results, along with the fact\nthat perceived need for MHC is associated with psychologi-\ncal distress and suicidality regardless of whether one meets\ndiagnostic criteria for a disorder (Sareen et al., 2005),\nsuggest that diagnostic criteria may not always reflect indi-\nvidual assessments of depression and anxiety. Although\ndiagnostic criteria are correlated with perceived need, these\nTable 2.

Perceptions of se-\nverity or the extent to which symptoms interfere with daily\nlife for those not meeting past-year criteria for MDD or\nGAD may lead older adults to perceive a need for care. In-\ncreased symptom intrusiveness into daily life is associated\nwith greater distress for physical conditions (Delahanty\net al., 2007), but little is known about the relationship be-\ntween mental illness intrusiveness and perceived need for\ncare among older adults.\nPerceived need was significantly more likely when indi-\nviduals reported a lifetime occurrence of more chronic\nphysical conditions. Respondents who needed chronic care\nin the past likely have more experience receiving care in\nformal settings and may be more accepting of medical\ntreatment. This in turn may increase the likelihood of view-\ning psychological symptoms as a target for care from a pri-\nmary care provider or mental health specialist. Those with\nfewer problems may be more likely to rely on themselves\nor informal resources for emotional support. This is sup-\nported by the fact that none of the more general measures\nof physical health status were significantly related to per-\nceived need in multivariate analyses; it is not the physical\nhealth status, but the experience with medical care that is\nrelated to perceived need.\nThe relationship between alcohol abuse and/or depen-\ndence and perceived need was not affected by depression,\nbut it was affected by anxiety. When alcohol use was exam-\nined as an interaction term with past-year GAD, alcohol\nabuse and/or dependence was only significantly associated\nwith perceived need for those with past-year GAD. From\nthese results, it seems that alcohol abuse may be a reason\nfor perceived need on its own or perhaps when used as inef-\nfective self-medication for anxiety. Because alcohol abuse\nsymptom reports might have been reduced by social desir-\nability bias, those who reported any symptoms likely had\nworse experiences with alcohol. It remains to be seen\nwhether older adults who have some, but not many, symp-\ntoms of alcohol abuse are less likely to perceive a need for\ncare because they are self-medicating.\nFuture studies should include more specific measures\nof the decision-making process leading to perceived need\nfor care. They should include individuals' assessments\nof symptom \"identity, timeline, cause, controllability, and\nconsequences\" (as stipulated in the CSM; Diefenbach &\nof social networks and general attitudes toward mental\nhealth on individual assessments. If people with more sup-\nportive social networks are less likely to perceive a need for\ncare, it will be important to determine the relative benefits\nof supportive social networks versus formal MHC in ad-\ndressing mental health issues. If social networks are inhibit-\ning members from receiving care that may potentially\nimprove their symptoms, educational interventions about\nthe benefits of formal MHC may be useful.\nMany respondents who met past-year diagnostic criteria\nfor MDD or GAD did not perceive a need for care. There\nare several reasons why this may have occurred: they may\nhave negative attitudes about mental illness and MHC,\nthey might feel their interactions with social networks are\nsuitable substitutes for formal MHC, or their interactions\nwith social networks may lead them to have negative atti-\ntudes toward care. Although our data set did not allow us\nto examine these relationships, it is an important area for\nfuture research.\nIndividuals' perceptions of symptoms and severity are re-\nlated to whether they perceive need for MHC, and perceived\nneed is an important determinant of whether individuals de-\ncide to seek care (Mechanic, 1978). Understanding the type\nand development of these perceptions is central to develop-\ning an effective care plan and strategy for working with\nolder people with depression and anxiety.\nLimitations\nOur analyses are limited by the cross-sectional nature of\nthe data; we cannot show causal associations. Because we\nused secondary data, some useful information was unavail-\nable due to differing skip patterns for some questions in the\ncomponents of the merged data set (e.g., self-rated physical\nhealth was not available for all respondents). Past-year\nchronic conditions and symptom counts, attitudes toward\ncare, and consistent social support measures are not avail-\nable in all components of the CPES. It would have been\nideal to have consistent time frames for measures of past-\nyear physical and mental health. Furthermore, because of\nthe relatively low prevalence of minor depression and dys-\nthymia, this study had limited power to examine some rela-\ntionships between illness characteristics and perceived need.\nAn ideal model would have also included measures of self-\nassessed physical and mental health, attitudes toward care,\nquality of social support, and more health measures specific\nto the past 12 months. Finally, the results of this study can-\nnot be extended to individuals with cognitive disabilities or\ndementia who have proxies making health care decisions.\nThe CPES data used in this study, however, are the most\ncomprehensive data related to MHC in older adults.\nConclusion\nFew studies have examined perceived need for mental\nhealth services in older adults. This study examines the re-\nlationships between perceived need for care, patient mental\nand physical illness, and sociodemographics in the frame-\nwork of the common sense model.\nHistories of MDD and non-GAD anxiety were related\nto perceived need. Among respondents who did not meet\ndiagnostic criteria for depression or anxiety, the number of\ndepression symptoms ever experienced was related to per-\nceived need. This suggests that providers should be sensi-\ntive to symptom reports and individual assessments, even\nif they do not meet the diagnostic threshold for depression.\nConversely, many who met diagnostic criteria for depres-\nsion or anxiety disorders in the past year did not perceive\na need for MHC. It is important for these patients to un-\nderstand the importance of care for depression and anxi-\nety, as these conditions are related to poor physical health\noutcomes and increased mortality risk.\nDepression and anxiety symptoms are experienced by a\nconsiderable portion of community-dwelling older individu-\nals, but symptoms are not a sufficient condition for perceived\nneed. Future studies should focus on how individual percep-\ntions of mental illness and social network interaction influ-\nence whether individuals perceive a need for care and whether\nthey seek treatment. Future studies also should examine the\nassociation between perceived need and utilization and\nwhether need and utilization are related to illness characteris-\ntics and psychosocial factors in similar ways. Understanding\nprocesses that lead older adults to perceive need for treatment\nand decide whether to seek treatment could improve MHC\nutilization rates, which could lead to improved physical and\nmental health status as well as reduced health care costs.\nFunding\nMelissa M.
