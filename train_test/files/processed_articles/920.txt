Barsky, MD2\nPurpose: This study examines the value of self-\nreported health (SRH) as an indicator of underlying\nhealth status in a developing country setting. Design\nand Methods: Logistic regression methods with\nadjustments for multistage sampling are used to\nexamine the factors associated with SRH in 2,921\nmen and women aged 50 and older in rural\nBangladesh. Results: SRH incorporates multiple di-\nmensions of health status (including physical disability\nassessed by measured physical performance; self-\nreported limitations in activities of daily living, or\nADLs; self-reported chronic morbidity; and self-\nreported acute morbidity), severity, comorbidity,\nand trajectory in a similar fashion for both men and\nwomen and for different age groups. Older individ-\nuals are more likely to report poor SRH than their\nyounger counterparts, and women report significantly\nworse SRH than their male peers at each age group.\nIn both cases, this disadvantage can be fully\naccounted for by differences in measured physical\nperformance, ADL limitations, and chronic and acute\nmorbidity. Implications: Among older Banglade-\nshis, SRH is an easily recorded, multifaceted,\nnuanced indicator of underlying health status that is\nsignificantly associated with measured physical per-\nformance. Moreover, SRH appears to be indepen-\ndent of age- and gender-related norms.\nKey Words: Gender, Comorbidity,\nDeveloping country, ADLs\nOne of the major constraints in assessing the\nhealth of elderly populations is the lack of health\nstatus indicators that can be readily collected for\nlarge numbers of individuals with minimal expen-\nditure of resources (time, money, and logistics).\nThis has sparked considerable interest in self-\nreported measures of health status. Perhaps the\nmost widely used is self-reported general health\n(SRH), in which respondents are asked to classify\ntheir current health status on some form of\nhierarchical scale (e.g., good, fair, or poor). Multi-\nple studies have demonstrated that SRH is a good\npredictor of mortality and functional ability, even\nafter objective measurements of medical morbidity\n(e.g., laboratory tests or physicians' reports) have\nbeen controlled for (Appels, Bosma, Grabauskas,\nGostautas, & Sturmans, 1996; Borawski, Kinney, &\nMossey & Shapiro, 1982; Schoenfeld, Malmrose,\nBlazer, Gold, & Seeman, 1994; Sugisawa, Liang, &\nhypothesized that the strong predictive value of\nSRH, even after appropriate controls have been\ninstituted, is related to its multifaceted and nuanced\nnature, whereby it incorporates multiple dimensions\nof health (physical disability, functional or activity\nlimitations, and chronic and acute morbidity),\nmeasures of severity, indications of comorbidity,\nand past trajectory (Idler & Benyamini, 1997).\nRelatively few studies have explicitly examined the\nmultifaceted nature of SRH in detail (Idler, 1993;\nJohnson & Wolinsky, 1993; Leinonen, Heikkinen,\n& Jylha\nNatividad, Lin, & Chayovan, 2000), especially with\nregard to interactions between different dimensions\nof health, and the impact of past trajectory on SRH\n(Ferraro & Kelley-Moore, 2001; Wolinsky &\nSupport for this research was provided by the National Institute on\nHealth and Population Research for their generous support and\ncollaboration on the Matlab Health and Socio-Economic Survey, which\nprovided the data for this research project.\nWe appreciate the comments provided by J. P. Sevilla and Ajay\nMahal, both of the Harvard School of Public Health, and Jane Menken\nand Randall Kuhn, both of the University of Colorado at Boulder.\nAddress correspondence to Dr. M.

Inconsistent\ngender differences have been reported, with some\nstudies showing a female disadvantage (Gijsbers van\nWijk, van Vliet, Kolk, & Everaerd, 1991; Rahman,\nStrauss, Gertler, Ashley, & Fox, 1994; Zimmer et al.,\n2000) and others showing no disadvantage (Jylha\n\u00a8 ,\nGuralnik, Ferrucci, Jokela, & Heikkinen, 1998;\nLeinonen et al., 1998; McDonough & Walters,\ntrends, some studies have demonstrated that SRH\nremains constant or even improves with age (Barsky,\nFrank, Cleary, Wyshak, & Klerman, 1991; Idler,\ndespite the fact that there are age-related declines in\nphysical performance and increases in acute and\nchronic morbidity (Hoeymans & Feskens, 1996;\nLaukkanen, Leskinen, Kauppinen, Sakari-Rantala, &\nHeikkinen, 2000). Possible explanations of this\nseeming paradox are that, with increasing age,\nindividuals may adjust downward their expectations\nof good health by implicitly using age-related norms,\nand that physical health contributes less and less to\noverall perceptions of health (Idler, 1993; Leinonen\nThe detailed exploration of SRH has been largely\nlimited to the developed world. Very few analyses\nhave been published using data from developing\nZimmer et al., 2000), largely because of the absence of\ninformation on potentially key determinants of SRH\nsuch as acute and chronic morbidity, limitations in\nactivities of daily living (ADLs), and, what is most\nimportant, measured physical performance. Interna-\ntional explorations of SRH are particularly valuable,\nbecause there may be important differences in the\nassociation of SRH with other health indicators\n(Angel & Guarnaccia, 1989; Ferraro & Kelley-\nmight hypothesize that, because of lower levels of\neducation and formal contact with the health care\nsystem in the developing world compared with the\ndeveloped world, individuals in the developing world\nwould have less knowledge about acute and chronic\nmorbidity; consequently, the relationship between\nacute and chronic morbidity and other subjective and\nobjective health measures would be weaker in the\ndeveloping world than in the developed world. In\na similar vein, because of high levels of family support\nand lower expectations of independence of movement\nin the developing world versus the developed world,\none might expect physical disability and functional\nlimitations to have a weaker association with SRH in\nthe former compared with the latter.\nRural Bangladesh is an example of a developing\nsociety with widespread poverty, low levels of\neducation (particularly for elderly persons), low\nmobility for women outside the home, numerous\nenvironmental hazards, and poorly developed com-\nmunity health and educational infrastructure. Per\ncapita income is $370/year. The overwhelming\nmajority of older individuals live with adult children\n(mostly sons), and alternative sources of support--\nfinancial and otherwise--outside the family are\nscarce. The predominant occupation for rural men\nis agriculture, with labor force participation rates\nremaining very high even for older men. Women are\nlargely restricted by convention to activities within\nthe home and have relatively little opportunity to\nventure outside the homestead. Given the high level\nof poverty and the scarcity of health providers (4,071\nregistered nurse), contact with the formal health\ncare system is thought to be relatively infrequent.\nThe population of persons over the age of 50\nconstitutes approximately 10% of the population\nas a whole, and life expectancy at age 50 is ap-\nproximately 30 years with no significant gender dif-\nference (Aziz, 1979; Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics,\nIn this analysis we use a comprehensive data set\nfrom rural Bangladesh to investigate the following\nquestions. First, to what extent does SRH incorpo-\nrate multiple dimensions of health, severity and\ncomorbidity? Second, are there differences in SRH\nby gender, and, if so, what accounts for these\ndifferences? Third, does the relationship of objec-\ntively measured physical performance limitations to\nSRH change with age?\nDesign and Methods\nSubjects and Setting\nThe specific data for analysis come from the\nMatlab Health and Socio-Economic Survey (MHSS)\nin rural Bangladesh, which collected in 1996, in\na multistage sample design, detailed health and\nresidential compounds, and 4,364 households within\nthese baris. The sample was drawn from an ongoing\npopulation surveillance system in Matlab, 40 miles\nsoutheast of the capital city of Bangladesh and\nconsidered to be representative of rural Bangladesh\nMatlab surveillance system data have been used\nextensively in the demographic literature and are\nconsidered to be one of the few high-quality (i.e.,\ncomplete, accurate, and up to date) data sources in\nthe developing world. In particular, age reporting is\nconsidered to be highly accurate, which is a feature\nnot found in other South Asian data sources\nThe multistage sampling was conducted as fol-\nlows (Rahman et al., 1999). The Matab surveillance\narea consists of 8,640 baris or residential compounds,\nbaris were randomly sampled. The bari is the\nbasic unit of social organization in rural Bangladesh\nand in Matlab in particular (Aziz, 1979; Rahman,\n1986). Baris usually consist of a cluster of households\nlinked in many instances in a kin network (note,\nhowever, that approximately 16% of baris consist\nonly of a single household, and even in multi-\nhousehold baris, kin networks may exist only for\nsubclusters of households). Sampling baris rather\nthan households provides a better representation of\nfamily networks, a major focus of the MHSS. Within\neach bari, up to two households were selected for\ndetailed interviews. Within each selected household,\nall individuals aged 50 years and older were\ninterviewed. For those younger than 50, certain\ncriteria were followed to reduce the interviewing\nload vis-a\n` -vis large households.\nFor baris with two or fewer households, all\nhouseholds were chosen. For baris with more than\ntwo households, the first household was chosen at\nrandom. The second household was selected from\nthe bari in order of preference as follows: (a) the\nhousehold of the father or mother of the head of the\nfirst sampled household; (b) a household containing\na son of the head of the first sampled household\n(chosen at random if there are multiple sons in\nseparate households in the bari); (c) a household\ncontaining a brother of the head of the first sampled\nhousehold (chosen at random if there are multiple\nbrothers in separate households in the bari); and (d)\na second randomly selected household.\nIn this analysis we are concerned with the 3,054\nindividuals aged 50 years and older in the MHSS.\nThese individuals come from 1,985 baris out of the\nindividuals, 484 had missing information on physical\ndisability (measured physical performance limita-\ntions) and functional limitations (self-reported\nADLs). Thus, for the purposes of this study, we will\nbaris for whom we have complete information.\nTable 1 shows that, on key demographic and\nhealth indicators, there appears to be little difference\nbetween the 484 individuals with missing informa-\ntion on physical performance and ADL limitations\nand the 2,921 individuals in the final analysis sample.\nTo further explore the issue of the impact of\ndropping the 484 individuals with missing informa-\ntion from our final analysis sample, we conducted\nmultivariate analyses using all 3,054 eligible individ-\nuals, and we coded the missing information on\nobserved physical activity and ADLs as distinct\nunordered categories. Thus, in this expanded anal-\nysis, observed or measured physical activity was\ncoded as having one of three unordered possible\nstates: bad physical performance, missing physical\nperformance, or good physical performance, with\nthe latter being the reference category. In a similar\nfashion, with regard to reported ADLs, we coded the\nrelevant groups as having major ADL limitations,\nminor ADL limitations, missing ADL limitations, or\nno ADL limitations (the latter being the reference\ncategory). Note that no ordering of categories is\nassumed; that is, the missing category is not\nconsidered better or worse a priori than the other\npossible states. The resulting multivariate models\nthat treat the missing category as a separate possible\nstate without any assumption or ordering do not\nlead to any substantive change in our conclusions\ncompared with our results, which include just those\nwith complete information.\nVariables\nWith regard to our health measures, we have one\nobjectively assessed indicator, physical disability\n(assessed as measured physical performance), and\nfour self-reported measures, SRH, self-reported\nfunctional limitations (ADLs), self-reported chronic\nmorbidity, and self-reported acute morbidity.\nWe assessed physical disability objectively as in\nprior studies (Merrill, Seeman, Kasl, & Berkman,\nperform four timed physical tasks: maintaining side\nby side, semitandem, and tandem positions (bal-\nance); walking 8 feet, twice (gait); rising from a chair\n(lower extremity movement); and rotating the\nshoulder (upper extremity movement). Each task\nhad a three-level score, that is, 0 (unable to do the\nactivity), 1 (had some difficulty doing the activity),\nand 2 (could do the activity easily), assigned by an\nindependent observer. We constructed an overall\nsummary measure of all performance tasks by\nTable 1. Comparison Between Final Analysis Sample and Missing Observations\nChronic Morbidity (%)\nSample or Obs.

SRH \u00bc self-reported general\nhealth; Obs. \u00bc observations. Final sample consists of 2,921 individuals, from 1,783 clusters or baris. Missing observations are for\n484 individuals from 411 clusters or baris. 95% confidence intervals are given parenthetically.\n*The two groups are significantly different at p , .05.\nadding the four individual subscales, and this scale\nranged in value from 0 to 8, with higher scores\nindicating better performance. Those with scores in\nthe range from 0 to 5 were labeled as having poor\nphysical performance, with the reference group being\nthose with scores 6 and above.\nSRH was assessed with this item: ``What is your\ncurrent health status?'' Responses were scored as\ngood, fair, or bad. For analytic purposes, bad SRH\nwas coded as 1, with good or fair being coded as 0.\nIn the cultural context of this study population,\nindividuals even when they are in good health are\nreluctant to classify themselves as being in good\nhealth (because of the sense that ``it might attract the\nattention of `the gods'''), and the tendency is to say\nthat one is in fair health. Thus the fair health\ncategory in all likelihood is composed of a substantial\nproportion of people in good health, and it seemed\nreasonable to combine the fair and the good\ncategories, so that the dichotomy of poor versus fair\nor good would provide the sharpest contrast.\nMoreover, the dichotomous coding of poor versus\nfair or good has been used in other published studies\n(Wu & Rudkin, 2000). It is important to note,\nhowever, that a different coding scheme (i.e., poor or\nfair vs. good) would probably result in a less sharp\ncontrast and some attenuation in our results.\nFollowing Merrill and colleagues (1997), and\nRahman and Liu (2000), we constructed a series of\nmeasures for functional limitations (self-reported\nADLs). We used self-report information on 10 ADL\nitems, which were divided into two different clusters.\nThe first cluster included limitations in personal care\nand consisted of four items: the ability to (a) bathe,\n(b) dress, (c) get up and out of bed, and (d) use the\ntoilet. The second cluster included limitations in\nrange of motion and consisted of six items: the\nability to (a) carry a 10-kg weight for 20 yards, (b)\nuse a hand pump to draw water, (c) stand up from\na squatting position on the floor, (d) sit in a squatting\nposition on the floor, (e) get up from a sitting\nposition on a chair or stool without help, and (f)\ncrouch or stoop. Each cluster was summarized as 1\n(can easily do all the activities in the cluster) or\n0 (have trouble with one or more activities in the\ncluster). Individuals who scored a 0 on both clusters\nof ADLs were labeled as having major ADL\nlimitations. Those who had a score of 0 on the\nrange of motion limitation scale but scored a 1 on the\npersonal care limitation scale were labeled as having\na minor ADL limitation. Finally, those who scored\na 1 on both ADL clusters were labeled as having no\nADL limitations.\nSelf-reported chronic morbidity (Rahman et al.,\nconditions (anemia, arthritis, broken bones, cata-\nracts, vision problems, asthma, other breathing\ndifficulty, diabetes, pain or burning on urination,\nparalysis, tuberculosis, gastric or ulcer problems,\nedema, and a residual category called ``other\nconditions''). For each condition, respondents were\nasked to report whether they had experienced it in\nthe 3 months prior to the survey, and if so whether it\nhad caused them no difficulty, some difficulty, a great\ndeal of difficulty, or an inability to carry out their\nday-to-day activities. Those who reported none of\nthe 14 sentinel conditions were labeled as having no\nchronic morbidity. Those who had experienced one\nor more of the 14 conditions with some or no\ndifficulty in day-to-day activities were labeled as\nhaving minor chronic disease. Finally, those who had\nexperienced 1 or more of the 14 sentinel conditions\nthat had caused a great deal of difficulty or inability\nto carry out their day-to-day activities were labeled\nas having severe chronic disease.\nSelf-reported acute morbidity (Rahman et al.,\nconditions (headache, eye infection, toothache, cold\nand cough symptoms, vomiting and stomach aches,\nfever with chills, watery diarrhea, diarrhea associ-\nated with mucus or blood, skin problems, accidental\ntrauma, excessive menstrual bleeding, and a residual\ncategory called ``other conditions''). For each\ncondition, respondents were asked to report whether\nthey had experienced it in the 30 days prior to the\nsurvey or not. Those reporting at least one of the\naforementioned conditions were labeled as having\nacute morbidity. It is worth noting that, for both\nself-reported acute and chronic morbidity, the\nsummary measures are composed of heterogeneous\ncategories of symptoms and disease labels that reflect\nthe prevailing morbid conditions in rural Bangla-\ndesh. They are locally specific, and cross-country\ncomparisons using these summary measures would\nbe difficult to interpret.\nData Analytic Plan\nBecause of the multistage nature of the sample,\nindividual observations have been weighted appro-\npriately to reflect population representation (Rah-\nman et al., 1999). We used binary weighted logistic\nregression with sampling weights and adjustment for\nintracluster (i.e., bari) correlations to examine the\ninterrelationship between SRH and various underly-\ning health indicators. These indicators included\nobserved physical performance; reported ADL lim-\nitations (major and minor); chronic morbidity\n(major and minor); acute morbidity; and self-\nreported 1-year time trajectory of health. STATA\nstatistical software was used for all of the analyses\nand the multistage design corrections (STATA,\nResults\nTable 1 shows that there were no significant\ndifferences in various health indicators between the\nused in the final analysis. The missing individuals are\nslightly older, but they have the same mean values\nfor SRH, major and minor chronic morbidity, and\nacute morbidity. These results support the notion\nthat dropping the 484 individuals with missing\nobservations has not biased the results from the\nfinal analysis sample in any significant manner.\nTable 2 shows that, for a variety of health\nindicators, older individuals are generally more\nlikely to have poor health than their younger\ncounterparts and that for each age group women\nare by and large more likely to have worse health\nthan men. Note that, in both Tables 1 and 2, all\ncalculations use sampling weights and correct for the\nmultistage sampling design of the survey (STATA,\nIn Table 3 we use weighted binary logistic\nregression with adjustments for multistage sampling\nto examine the determinants of SRH, focusing\ninitially on the impact of gender and age. As already\nnoted, the outcome variable is bad compared with\nfair or good SRH. Table 3 shows that, unadjusted\nfor any other controls, there is a significant female\n2.12) for Model 1.

This age effect\npersists when controls are added for measured\nphysical performance but becomes statistically in-\nsignificant when controls are added for different self-\nreported health indicators. The results of the final\nmodel (Model 4) show that several different\ndimensions of health, such as physical disability\n(poor observed physical performance), functional\nlimitations (self-reported major and minor ADL\nlimitations), and acute and chronic morbidity, have\nindependent impacts on SRH. Moreover, for ADLs\nand chronic morbidity, there is a severity gradient in\nthe expected direction, with more severe conditions\nhaving more of an impact on SRH than less severe\nconditions. Finally, the results also indicate that\nthere is a negative interaction between some of the\ndifferent dimensions of health affecting SRH (i.e.,\nADL limitations and chronic morbidity). Thus the\nimpact of an ADL limitation on SRH is greatest\nwhen the individual has no chronic morbidity. If the\nindividual already has some kind of chronic\nmorbidity, the addition of an ADL limitation does\nnot affect SRH quite as much as it would in the\nabsence of chronic morbidity. In a similar manner,\nthe impact of chronic morbidity on SRH is greatest\nwhen the individual has no ADL limitation. If the\nindividual already has some kind of ADL limitation,\nthe addition of chronic morbidity does not affect\nSRH as much as it would in the absence of an ADL\nlimitation. Finally, gender and age interactions for\neach of these distinct health status indicators were\ntested and were found not to be significant.\nDiscussion\nBefore we discuss our results, we believe it is\nworth pointing out a number of salient caveats and\nTable 2.

First, because of the cross-\nsectional design and the subjective nature of many of\nour independent variables (self-reports of: chronic\nmorbidity, ADL limitations, and acute morbidity),\nthe potential for bidirectionality between our in-\ndependent variables and our outcomes cannot be\nruled out. Thus we are not able to make any\ndefinitive cause and effect statements, and we are\nlimited to pointing out associations. Second, our\nindicators of acute and chronic morbidity are\nheterogeneous composites of self-reported symptoms\nand disease labels (e.g., difficulty breathing and\nanemia), which may not necessarily correspond to\nobjectively diagnosed disorders.\nKeeping these caveats in mind, we find that our\nresults suggest SRH in our study population is\na multifaceted, nuanced indicator of underlying\nhealth status that incorporates different dimensions\nof health (physical disability--actual measured\nphysical performance; functional limitations--\nreported limitations in ADLs, and chronic and acute\ndisease or symptom status), severity, and comorbid-\nity. The independent effects of different dimensions\nof health point to the fact that there does not appear\nto be a single pathway, such as functional limi-\ntations, that determines self-reported health status\n(Johnson & Wolinsky, 1993). The results with\nregard to severity are noteworthy as they confirm\ntheoretical expectations that have not been tested\nexplicitly in most previous studies (Idler & Benya-\nmini, 1997). Our findings with respect to comorbid-\nity are particularly interesting in that they show that\nSRH is not merely an additive function of different\nkinds of health risks. On the contrary, the marginal\nimpact of additional health risks on SRH diminishes\nwith each existing problem for this study population.\nThis result underscores the complex weighting\nacross various dimensions of health that underlies\nSRH assessments (Idler & Benyamini, 1997).\nAs is the case in the developed world, we find\nstrong evidence of female disadvantage in SRH\nstatus. In our sample, this female disadvantage does\nnot vary with age (i.e., there are no Age 3 Gender\ninteractions), and it persists (in an attenuated\nfashion) when controls are added for objectively\nmeasured physical performance. Subsequently, how-\never, this female disadvantage appears to be fully\naccounted for by the fact that women are more likely\nto report more ADL limitations and more acute and\nchronic morbidity. One might be tempted to argue\nthat these findings suggest that female disadvantages\nin SRH reflect true gender differences in underlying\nhealth status. However, in light of the fact that ADL\nlimitations and acute and chronic morbidity are\nultimately self-reported, and not objectively mea-\nsured, one cannot rule out definitively that the\nportion of the female disadvantage not explained by\nobserved physical performance ratings is a function\nof differential reporting by gender. Although the\nreporting bias issue remains unresolved, our results\ndo indicate that marginal changes in physical\ndisability, functional limitations, and acute and\nTable 3.

We focus on objectively\nmeasured physical performance, which uses age\nindependent norms, and find that there are no\nsignificant age interactions. Thus the same level of\nabsolute, objectively measured, physical performance\nlimitation affects SRH in the same manner in the old\nold versus the young old. These results thus provide\nan interesting contrast to studies in other social\nsettings, which have suggested that physical limita-\ntions have a decreasing impact on SRH with\nEarlier in this article, we posited that the relation-\nship between SRH and other health-related measures\nmay be different in the developing world than in the\ndeveloped world because of differences in levels of\nknowledge about health conditions, differing expec-\ntations about physical mobility, and differences in\nsocial support. Although we are not able to explore\nsuch differences explicitly, we are able to explore\ngender differences in our study population, which\nmay mirror differences between the developing and\ndeveloped world. As women in this population have\nless education and less contact with the health care\nsystem than their male peers, one might expect that\nproportionately more women than men would be\nunaware of existing acute and chronic morbid\nconditions. Thus this might be expected to lead to\na weaker association for women than for men\nbetween acute and chronic morbidity and SRH\n(provided acute and chronic morbidity have the same\ntheoretical impact on SRH for both men and\nwomen). Gender differences were tested and were\nnot found to be significant.\nIn a similar vein, one could hypothesize that,\ngiven the low levels of mobility outside the home\nfor women and the lower expectations for physical\nstrength and coordination in this society, objec-\ntively measured physical limitations would have\nless of an impact on SRH for women than for men.\nThis was tested for and no gender interaction was\nfound.\nIn conclusion, our analysis provides support for\nthe notion that, in our study population, easily\nrecorded SRH assessments incorporate many of the\nproperties one would want in a composite health\nindicator, including multidimensionality, severity,\ncomorbidity, and trajectory. Moreover, SRH ap-\npears to be significantly correlated with a hard\nobjective measure of physical performance. Finally,\nin contrast to some other settings, in rural Bangla-\ndesh there appears to be no evidence that the impact\nof physical performance limitations on SRH is\ndifferent for women than for men and for older\nindividuals than for younger individuals.\nIt is hard to know to what extent our results hold\njust for rural Bangladesh. Clearly, some of our\nmeasures are locally specific (e.g., acute and chronic\nmorbidity summary measures). Moreover, as we have\nalready noted, there are in all likelihood different\ndegrees of knowledge about morbid conditions and\ndifferent behavioral expectations about health and\nvarying social support networks across different\nsocieties. Further exploration of the generalizability\nof our results will require parallel datasets from other\nsocial or environmental settings that will allow us to\ntest directly for both differences and similarities in the\nconceptualization of SRH measures.\nReferences\nAngel, R., & Guarnaccia, P.
