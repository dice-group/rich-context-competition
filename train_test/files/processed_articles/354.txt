Recent research is now even\nincluding potential negative effects on cognition in later\nlife.1\u00ad6 In two recent systematic review articles7,8 on over-\nweight and risk of dementia it was proposed that high body\nmass index (BMI) is independently associated with the risk of\ndementia. According to the reviews, the studies that reported\nsignificant associations had younger samples at baseline and\nlonger follow-up periods.\nOverweight should be measured in midlife to reveal the\nassociation with subsequent dementia because people often\nlose weight before diagnosis9 and early in the dementia\nphase.10 This fact is bound to blur the association between\noverweight and dementia in older samples. Another reason\nis that BMI is a better measure of adiposity in younger\nsamples as lean body mass is replaced by fat with increasing\nage.11 Thus, it is possible for old people to have relatively low\nBMI although they can have relatively high body fat. Finally,\nand most importantly, measuring overweight in midlife may\nreflect a more valid perspective on a person's lifelong\nexposure to overweight, especially given the fact that most\npeople tend to gain rather than lose weight in adulthood.\nThus, when in the life course a risk factor for dementia is\nmeasured, it determines whether and how the association is\nStudies that have addressed potential sex differences in the\nassociation between overweight and dementia risk indicate\nthat overweight may be a stronger risk factor for women\ncompared with men.3,14 Hayden et al.14 who used BMI in a\nsample of people aged 65 years and older to predict incident\ndementia, found an increased risk only for women; however,\nthe authors reported a problem with low statistical power in\nthe analyses of men. By using midlife assessment of BMI and\nskinfold thickness,3 it was found that midlife BMI predicted\ndementia among women only, whereas midlife skinfold\nthickness predicted dementia in both sexes, suggesting that\nBMI is an inaccurate measure of adiposity in men.\nCorrespondence: Dr LB Hassing, Department of Psychology, University of\nE-mail: Linda.Hassing@psy.gu.se\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nA related question is if overweight is differentially\nassociated with the most frequent types of dementia, that\nis, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD).\nThis has only been examined in three studies.1,14,15 Two\nstudies reported that overweight increases the risk of AD and\nnot VaD in women.1,14 In the study of Whitmer et al.15\noverweight (BMI between 25 and 30) increased the risk of AD\nand VaD to the same extent (approximately a two-fold\nincreased risk), whereas obesity (BMIX30) was more strongly\nrelated to VaD, indicating a five-fold risk, as compared with a\nthree-fold risk of AD. In a recent study by the same group,\nmidlife central obesity was found to predict dementia.4\nIn the investigation of the association between overweight\nand dementia it is important to include all covariates that are\ncorrelated with overweight and dementia and might affect\nthe association, such as age, sex, lifestyle factors (education,\nsmoking and alcohol consumption), diabetes, vascular\ndiseases and APOE e4 carrier status. The majority of the\nstudies addressing this issue include all relevant covariates,\nwith the exception of APOE e4 status.\nThe purpose of our study is to examine if overweight in\nmidlife is related to increased risk of dementia in later life.\nWe also examine if the risk is similar for men and women,\nand if overweight is differentially related to AD and VaD.\nFurthermore, the potential effect of APOE e4 allele will be\nexamined.\nMethods\nParticipants\nData on BMI come from the initial surveys that were\nadministered to form the Swedish Twin Registry. The\nSwedish Twin Registry was established in the late 1950s to\nstudy smoking and alcohol consumption in relation to\npotential risk of cancer and cardiovascular diseases.16,17 In\n1963, the twins answered questionnaires covering various\nenvironmental aspects including health and diseases, smok-\ning habits, alcohol consumption and information on weight\nand height. Almost 30 years later, two longitudinal studies\non cognitive aging were conducted using the same twins\nwho participated in the survey in the sixties, The Swedish\nand Origins of Variance in the Old\u00adOld19 (OCTO-Twin),\nstarting in 1991. For the purpose of this study information\nfrom the survey in the sixties and information from the\nSATSA and OCTO-Twin studies have been linked. All\nparticipants were informed about the study in accordance\nwith the ethics committee of the Karolinska Institute, the\nSwedish Data Inspection Board, and the institutional board\nat the University of Southern California or the Pennsylvania\nState University.\nThe eligible participants for this study were all individuals\nfrom the SATSA (n \u00bc 767) and the OCTO-Twin study\nwere included who had valid data on all variables and who\nwere screened for dementia (beginning in 1987 for SATSA,\nOverweight\nWeight and height is based on information from the survey\nin 1963. BMI was calculated by dividing the weight in kilos\nby the height in square meters (kg/m2). Overweight is\nnormally defined as a BMI between 25 and 30, whereas\nobesity is defined as a BMI greater than 30. In our sample,\nhowever, less than 5% were obese according to this criterion.\nTo gain statistical power, we therefore applied a slightly\ndifferent categorization with BMI dichotomized into two\ncategories with the top 25% of the distribution defined as\noverweight (BMIX26.5; coded as 1) and all others defined as\nnormal weight (coded as 0).\nThe information on heights and weights were self-\nreported, which is potentially a subject to bias. However,\nanalyses completed in the SATSA comparing self-reported\nand measured information on heights and weights (within a\n1 year period) resulted in a correlation of 0.97 for height and\n0.95 for weight.20 The mean differences (\u00b1s.d.) between self-\nreported and measured values were 1.2\u00b12.4 cm for height\nDementia and vascular risk factors\nThe OCTO-Twin and the SATSA are longitudinal studies with\nrepeated assessments at a 2- to 3-year time schedules. Thus,\nthe participants have been evaluated continuously across the\nstudy period with respect to dementia and vascular risk\nfactors.\nClinical diagnoses of dementia followed the DSM-III-R\ncriteria.21 All individuals were assessed with a cognitive test\nbattery during an in person visit. Individuals suspected for\ndementia were given a diagnostic workup, including an\ninterview with an informant about memory and cognitive\nproblems, review of in person cognitive test protocols and\nmedical records.22 Findings were presented at a multi-\ndisciplinary consensus diagnosis conference, attended by\nthe clinicians and chaired by a psychologist who had not\nmet the participant. Subtypes of dementia were assigned\nfollowing NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for Alzheimer's disease23\nand the NINDS-AIREN criteria for vascular dementia.24 All\nclinical diagnoses were completed without reference to\nneuroimaging. Prevalence rates of dementia in SATSA and\nOCTO-Twin have been found to resemble other similar\nstudies such as the Kungsholmen study25 in Sweden, and the\nFramingham study26 in the United States.\nA total of 312 individuals received a dementia diagnosis:\nOverweight in midlife and risk of dementia\nLB Hassing et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nmixed, secondary or unspecified dementia. Mean age at\nyears), and did not differ between the normal weight and the\noverweight groups.\nThe vascular risk factors of interest for this study are\nsmoking and alcohol habits, arterial hypertension, conges-\ntive heart failure, myocardial infarction, diabetes and stroke.\nThe information on smoking and alcohol habits comes from\nthe surveys in the sixties as well as from the longitudinal\naging studies (SATSA and OCTO-Twin). The smoking vari-\nable was coded as 0 for non-smokers and 1 for current or\nprevious smokers. The alcohol variable was coded as 0 for\nalcohol consumers and 1 for those who never use alcohol.\nInformation on diabetes and vascular diseases was obtained\nthrough self-reports and through a review of medical\nrecords. If there was any notification of a disease or a history\nof self-report the person was coded as having the disease. The\nfollowing diseases were included in the analyses: hyperten-\nsion, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, diabetes\nand stroke (0 \u00bc without the disease, 1 \u00bc with the disease).\nAPOE e4 carrier status was coded as 0 for non-carriers of\nthe e4 allele and as 1 for those carrying 1 or 2 copies of the e4\nallele. Information regarding APOE e4-carrier status was\navailable for only 732 individuals. Therefore, APOE e4 status\nwill not be included in the main analyses. However, it will be\nincluded in one complementary analysis in which potential\ninteraction with overweight on dementia risk will be\nexamined.\nData analyses\nGroup differences between the normal weight group and\noverweight group in background characteristics were ana-\nlyzed with t-tests and w2-tests. Odds Ratio for dementia was\ncalculated using an extension of the generalized linear\nmodel known as generalized linear mixed model (also\nknown as hierarchical generalized linear model27) to account\nfor the hierarchical structure in the data when accounting\nfor the dependency associated with twin pair status. Within\nthis modeling procedure we analyzed the logit function of\nthe probability of an event of diagnosis of dementia as a\nconditional function of BMI, eight dummy-coded covariates\n(that is, gender, smoking, alcohol habit, hypertension,\ncongestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, diabetes\nand stroke), two continuous covariates (age and education)\nand a random effect of the intercept reflecting estimated\nvariability across the twin pairs. The random effect was\nassumed to take a normal distribution with a mean of zero.\nRisk of dementia was first analyzed for the total sample and\nthen separately for men and women. In the next step, we\nexamined if BMI was differentially related to AD and VaD:\nthis was first analyzed for the total sample, then separately\nfor men and women. Two models were run in each\ncase. Model I included age, gender, smoking and alcohol\nhabit as covariates. In Model II, diabetes and vascular\ndiseases (hypertension, congestive heart failure, myocardial\ninfarction and stroke) were added along with the covariates\nincluded in Model I. The analyses were conducted using the\nGLIMMIX procedure in SAS version 9.1.28 The statistical\nanalyses regarding the association between overweight and\ndementia were based on one-tailed tests using the conven-\nResults\nSample characteristics\nThe sample characteristics are shown in Table 1. There were\nstatistically significant differences between the normal\nweight group and the overweight group, such that the\noverweight group had fewer years of education, comprised\nmore individuals who did not use alcohol, had more\nindividuals with hypertension, congestive heart failure and\nParticipant characteristics comparing controls with de-\nmentia cases are presented in Table 2. There were statistically\nsignificant differences between controls and cases, such that\nthe dementia group had more women, were older, had fewer\nyears of education, had shorter survival, comprised more\nindividuals who did not use alcohol, had more prevalent\ncongestive heart failure, stroke and APOE e4 carriers, and a\nRisk of dementia in relation to midlife BMI\nThe results from the logistic regression analyses that were all\ncorrected for twinship are presented in Table 3. Model I\n(adjusted for demographics, smoking and alcohol use)\nshowed that midlife overweight was associated with greater\nrisk of dementia, such that those with a BMI above the third\nquartile had a 59% greater risk of getting dementia in old age\nas compared with those with lower BMI. Further adjust-\nments for diabetes and vascular diseases in Model II did not\nsubstantially change this association. Among these covari-\nates, only stroke came out as a significant covariate\nWhen BMI was examined in relation to AD the same\npattern was found as with all dementia, although the\nassociation was stronger in terms of risk, OR \u00bc 1.71 in Model\nI and OR \u00bc 1.68 in the fully adjusted model. None of the\nvascular risk factors were statistically significant. Concerning\nVaD, the risk associated with higher BMI fell short out of\nrisk was substantially reduced in Model II by including\ning the significance of these factors in the etiology of VaD. In\nthis model, congestive heart failure (OR \u00bc 1.98) and stroke\n(OR \u00bc 6.97) were significantly related to risk of VaD\n(Po0.05), whereas diabetes was marginally significant\nand dementia risk showed the same pattern among men and\nOverweight in midlife and risk of dementia\nLB Hassing et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nwomen, therefore, these results will not be presented\nseparately.\nA complementary analysis was conducted in which APOE\ne4 carrier status was included in the analysis as a covariate as\nwell as the interaction term between BMI and APOE e4\nstatus. As only 732 individuals had information regarding\nAPOE e4 status, we first analyzed BMI status in relation to all\ndementia in the subsample of 732 individuals not including\nAPOE e4 status. This analysis resulted in an OR of 1.62 (95%\nas a covariate, the association between BMI status and\ndementia was somewhat weaker, although still statistically\nPo0.001), confirming the well-established role of APOE e4\nas a risk factor for dementia. The interaction between BMI\nand APOE e4 was not statistically significant (P \u00bc 0.781),\nindicating that having both risk factors does not have a\nmultiplicative effect on dementia risk but rather an additive\neffect (see Table 4).\nDiscussion\nThis study examined if overweight in midlife is related to risk\nof dementia in old age. Our results showed that midlife\noverweight significantly increased the risk of dementia in\nold age, even after controlling for known comorbid factors\nrelated to vascular risk. Further, the risk was increased for\nboth AD and VaD. However, by controlling for diabetes and\nvascular diseases the association between BMI and VaD was\nTable 1 Participant characteristics in normal weight and overweight groups\nNormal weight Overweight\nTable 2 Participant characteristics in the normal controls and dementia cases\nCases\nAll Controls\nDementia AD only VaD only\naAvailable for 732 individuals. * \u00bc Po0.05 comparing controls with cases.\nTable 3 Association between midlife body mass index (highest quartile) and risk of dementia (N \u00bc 1152)\nModel Ia Model IIb\nAbbreviations: OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence interval. aModel I is adjusted for age, sex, education, smoking and alcohol habits. bModel II is further adjusted for\nhypertension, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, diabetes and stroke.\nOverweight in midlife and risk of dementia\nLB Hassing et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nreduced to a non-significant level. This was not the case for\nAD. Finally, the sex-stratified analyses indicated the same\npattern for men and women.\nThere are few studies that have examined the long-term\nrisk of overweight in relation to dementia. This is reasonable\ngiven the practical demands associated with studies requir-\ning extensive follow-up time. Consequently, studies to date\nhave often used medical records to gain data on dementia\ndiagnoses, a procedure that is unlikely to capture all cases\nand include information on dementia subtypes. In our study,\nthe dementia diagnoses were made through a thorough\nclinical procedure resulting in a highly confident outcome\ndiagnosis. On the other hand, the BMI measure is based on\nself reports on weight and height, leaving a potential risk for\ninaccuracy in the report. However, correlational analyses\nconducted on SATSA,20 comparing self-reported and mea-\nsured data on heights and weights, resulted in correlation of\nvalid and reliable self-reported data. There are other\nmeasures of overweight that probably better reflect adiposity\nthan BMI, such as hip-to-waist ratio and circumference that\nwe unfortunately did not have in our data. Another issue\nthat needs to be highlighted when interpreting the results\nfrom this study is the issue of potential survival bias.\nIncluded in our study are people aged 45\u00ad65 years at baseline\nand who were alive at the start of the aging studies (SATSA\nand OCTO-Twin) on dementia. This implies that the\nparticipants were at the age of 69 \u00fe years (for the SATSA)\nand 80 \u00fe years (for the OCTO-Twin) at inclusion, meaning\nthat the results can only be generalized to people who\nsurvive into that age. Another issue, related to the sample, is\nthat it is constituted of twins, which means that there is a\ndependency within twin pairs. This was, however, dealt\nwithin the statistical analyses by using multilevel models\nthat account for the dependency within pairs.\nGenerally, our results are in congruence with results from\nstudies where overweight is measured in midlife and the\nfollow-up time for the dementia outcome is extensive.2\u00ad4\nWhen we analyzed the risk of dementia separately for the\nsexes the same pattern was found for men and women, a\nresult that contradicts one study that reported greater risk for\nwomen.14 Whitmer et al.3 found that the way adiposity is\nmeasured results in different dementia risk for the sexes,\nsuch that BMI predicted dementia only among women\nwhereas skinfold thickness was a significant predictor for\nboth sexes. Thus, there seems to be no substantial differences\nbetween men and women in this matter.\nPotential mechanisms by which overweight increases the\nrisk of compromised brain functioning in later life include\nvascular disease, diabetes, genetics and inflammatory\nprocesses. Overweight increases the risk of hypertension,\ndiabetes mellitus and stroke, all three known risk factors for\ndementia. Our study, along with other studies show that\neven after controlling for these comorbid risk factors,\noverweight is still a significant risk factor of dementia. This\ndoes not, however, rule out the possibility that these diseases\nare of importance, especially given the fact that both\nhypertension and diabetes-related conditions are under-\ndiagnosed and underreported in the general population.\nAPOE e4 carrier status is a known risk factor for vascular\ndisease and dementia.29,30 In our study, there were some-\nwhat more APOE e4 carriers in the overweight group. In the\nanalysis in which APOE e4 status was included as a covariate,\noverweight remained a significant independent predictor for\ndementia. Most interestingly, however, was that overweight\ndid not interact with APOE e4 status on dementia risk in a\nmultiplicative manner, supporting earlier findings from the\nFinnish CAIDE study.31 Another factor of importance is\ninflammation that has been shown to be associated with\ndementia.36 However, the direction of the associations\nbetween inflammation and the above conditions is con-\ntroversial. In a recent study35 it was demonstrated that the\neffects of the metabolic syndrome on cognitive decline were\nmediated by inflammation, such that those with high\ninflammation and the metabolic syndrome had a greater\nrisk of cognitive decline compared with those with low\ninflammation but a metabolic syndrome.\nTo summarize, in congruence with the few studies that\nhave assessed overweight in midlife and risk of dementia in\nlater life, our study gives further support to the conclusion\nthat overweight is a significant risk factor for dementia.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n"
