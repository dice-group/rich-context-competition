Plain\nwater intake was unrelated to the intake of energy and body mass\nindex but was positively related to dietary fiber and inversely related\nto beverages, sugars, and the energy density of foods; these associ-\nations were in the opposite direction for beverage moisture intake.\nTotal water intake was inversely related to energy from fat and energy\ndensity but positively related to dietary fiber, caffeine, alcohol, and\ndiet quality. The number of eating episodes predicted higher bever-\nage and food moisture and total water intakes.

The panel on Dietary Reference Intakes for\nElectrolytes and Water in its 2004 report established the first\nreference intake (ie, for Adequate Intake) for total water on the\nbasis of self-reported dietary data from the Third National Health\nthe expert panel also identified several gaps in the published\ninformation about water intake, including the association of\nwater intake profiles with diet and meal patterns (1).\nAs reviewed by Valtin (2), despite popular beliefs about the\nimportance of drinking 8 cups of water a day and the supposed\nbenefits of water intake in body weight management, there is\na surprising paucity of systematic studies in this area. A number\nof individual characteristics--eg, age, dietary sodium and protein\nintake, and physical activity--are known to affect water\nrequirements (1), yet little is known about whether self-reported\nwater intake is related to variations in these factors. Given the\ninterest in understanding the association (if any) of water intake\nwith a variety of health outcomes, including various cancers and\ncoronary heart disease (1), understanding correlates of water\nintake in a free-living population can help in the identification of\npopulation subgroups that may benefit from interventions.\nAlthough a number of studies have examined the nutritional\ncorrelates of the consumption of beverages, especially sweetened\nbeverages(3\u00ad7),similarinformationinrelationtoplainwaterortotal\nwater intake is scarce (8\u00ad10). In an attempt to fill in these gaps in\nknowledge, we used recent nationally representative data to ex-\namine: 1) the sociodemographic and lifestyle correlates of intakes\nof plain water, moisture in foods and beverages, and total water and\n2) the association of plain water and moisture intake with reported\ndietary characteristics and meal patterns of US adults.\nWe used data from the continuous National Health and Nu-\n1 From the Department of Family, Nutrition, and Exercise Sciences,\nQueens College of the City University of New York, Flushing, NY\n(AKK); the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Biostatistics\nBranch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,\nMD (BIG); and the Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University,\nChicago, IL (EAA).\n2 Supported in part by the intramural research program of the Department\nof Health and Human Services, National Cancer Institute, NIH (BIG).\n3 Address correspondence to AK Kant, Department of Family, Nutrition,\nand Exercise Sciences, Remsen Hall, Room 306E, Queens College of the\nCity University of New York, Flushing, NY 11367.

Each survey was\na stratified, multistage, national probability sample of the civilian\nnoninstitutionalized population of the United States (11\u00ad14). The\nsurvey procedures consisted of a household interview and\na health examination of the subject in the mobile examination\ncenter. Anthropometric measurements (height, weight, etc) and\nan in-person interview to collect 24-h dietary recall were obtained\nin the mobile examination center. All surveys used a computer-\nassisted dietary interview for obtaining a multiple-pass dietary\nrecall. Beginning with the NHANES 2002, the dietary recall was\ncollected by using the automated multiple-pass method, which\nwas developed and validated by the US Department of Agri-\nculture (12). Survey response rates for the individuals examined\nPlain water and moisture intake\nmuch plain water did you drink yesterday?\" after collection of the\n24-h dietary recall (11\u00ad13). Information about the intake of plain\ncarbonated water was obtained as part of the 24-h recall in 1999\u00ad\nasking a separate question after the recall (12, 13). However, the\nsurvey was collected by integrating water questions within the\n24-h recall rather than after recall (14). (The reasons for changes\nin the methodology for collection of plain water intake data\ndocumentation.) Because of these methodologic differences in\nhow plain water information was collected beginning with the\nvariables for plain water and moisture content of all foods and\nbeverages reported in the recall. For each 24-h recall, we ex-\namined 4 different types of water variables for this study: 1)\nintake of plain water (defined by the NCHS to include tap water,\nwater from a water cooler or drinking fountain, spring water, and\nnoncarbonated bottled water); 2) moisture in foods reported in\nthe 24-h recall; 3) moisture in beverages reported in the 24-h\nrecall; and 4) total water intake (the sum of plain water and\nmoisture in foods and beverages). We considered all types of\nliquid milk, shakes, fruit or vegetable juices, juice drinks, car-\nbonated and noncarbonated sweetened or unsweetened drinks,\ncoffee, tea, hot chocolate, all alcoholic drinks, and carbonated\nsurvey, we used the equivalent variable created by the NCHS\nand available in the public release data set. In all surveys, we\nincluded plain carbonated water in the beverages category.\nAnalytic sample\nAll respondents aged 20 y with a dietary recall considered\ncomplete and reliable by the NCHS were eligible for inclusion\nin this study (n = 13,431). We excluded recalls of pregnant and\nlactating women (n = 843), recalls from proxies (n = 270), re-\nports of 0 calories (n = 2), and recalls of those missing in-\nformation on water intake in the previous 24 h (n = 33) from the\neligible sample. With these exclusions, the final analytic sample\na reliable recall. After exclusions for pregnancy/lactating state\n(n = 353), recall from proxies (n = 54), and reports of 0 calories\n(n = 1), the final analytic sample included 4112 men and\nwomen.\nDietary and meal pattern variables examined\nWe examined the self-reported 24-h intakes of dietary energy,\nfat, carbohydrate, total sugars, added sugars, as well as dietary\nvariables identified as determinants of water requirements in the\nInstitute of Medicine report (protein, fiber, sodium, caffeine, and\n24-h alcohol) in relation to all water and moisture intake variables\noperationalized in this study. The \"added sugars\" variable was\nMyPyramid Equivalents Database of the US Department of\nAgriculture (15, 16). We also assessed the energy density of foods\nonly (plain water or beverages reported in the recall were not\nincluded in this estimation) as kilocalories per gram of reported\nfoods. By using the methods described previously (17), we\ncreated variables to assess meal patterns; these variables included\nthe number of eating episodes, mention of breakfast and any\nsnack in the recall, and the percentage of recalled intake re-\nportedly consumed after 1700 h. In addition, we assessed the\nassociation of all water intake variables with a simple measure of\noverall diet quality, which assessed the diet for variety among\nfood groups (mention of at least one food from each of the major\n5 food groups--dairy, fruit, vegetable, grain, and meat or al-\nternative in the recall). We have previously used this simple\nindicator of diet quality in relation to dietary nutrient intake and\nmortality as outcome (18, 19). Finally, where available\nintake variables with the Healthy Eating Index (20). The Healthy\nEating Index is a complex measure of diet quality created by the\nUS Department of Agriculture to assess concurrence with the\nDietary Guidelines for Americans (21).\nAnalytic methods\nWe used multiple linear regression methods to compute\ncovariate adjusted means (ie, predicted margins) of all water\nbody mass index, poverty-income ratio, years of education,\nsmoking status, day of diet recall, leisure-time physical activity,\naverage daily physical activity, any self-reported chronic disease,\nand survey wave (in analyses that included combined\nfrom covariate adjusted regression models by direct standardi-\nzation of the means to the distribution of the covariates for the\ncombined US populations represented by the weighted NHANES\nsamples (22). We examined the association of dietary, meal\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\npattern, and body-weight-related variables with each contributor\nof water intake as a dependent variable by adding the relevant\nnutritional or meal pattern variable to the multiple linear re-\ngression models. For dietary variables such as energy or nutrient\nintake, we present the regression coefficient and its SE to reflect\nthe predicted change in reported water and moisture intakes for\na given change in energy or nutrient intakes as independent\nvariables. Similarly, for associations of meal patterns with water\nand moisture intake, we present the associated regression co-\nefficient, its SE, and the P value. We present these associations\nby using regression models with and without energy adjustment.\nLow-energy reporting has been reported as a problem in national\nsurveys including the NHANES (23). Low-energy reporting\nmay affect the ability to detect associations of dietary intake\nexposures with weight-related outcomes. We examined low-\nenergy reporting in the present study by computing the ratio of\nreported energy intake to the estimated basal energy expenditure\nby using the sex-specific equation recommended by the Dietary\nReference Intake committee (24). For weight-related outcomes,\nwe present estimates of association that include the ratio of\nenergy intake to basal energy expenditure as an independent\nvariable. Respondents with complete information on all co-\nvariates were included in multivariate regression models.\nAll statistical analyses were performed by using SAS (version\n9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and software designed for the\nanalysis of complex survey data (SAS-callable SUDAAN, ver-\nsion 9) (25). SUDAAN software computes variance estimates\nthat are corrected for the multistage, stratified, cluster probability\ndesign of complex surveys. Sample weights provided by the\nNCHS to account for differential probabilities of selection,\nnoncoverage, and nonresponse were used in all analyses to obtain\npoint estimates. All reported P values for testing for significant\nassociation from regression models used the F-statistic with\na Satterthwaite correction for the df (26).\nRESULTS\nand notes the different associations between the combined 1999\u00ad\nthe online supplement.\nSociodemographic and lifestyle correlates of contributors\nMen reported higher adjusted amounts of moisture in bev-\nerages, foods, and total water (but not plain water) (P , 0.0001)\n(Table 1). The reported plain water intakes did not differ among\nrace-ethnic groups; however, race-ethnicity was a significant\ncorrelate of reported intakes of moisture in foods and beverages\nand total water. The self-reported plain water, beverage mois-\nture, and total water declined with increasing age (P  0.003).\nHigher education was associated with higher self-reported plain\nwater and food moisture intakes (P  0.003). Current smokers\nhad a lower intake of moisture in foods (P = 0.0002), but\na higher intake of beverages and total water (P  0.0003). Any\nleisure-time physical activity was associated with higher intakes\nof plain and total water; higher average activity on a typical day\nwas a correlate of a higher amount of moisture from beverages\nand total water. Body mass index (BMI) showed positive asso-\nciations with beverage moisture and total water (P  0.01).\nReported food moisture was higher on weekdays than on\nreported by men, those with a higher BMI, and in association with\nhigher average daily physical activity (see Supplement Table 1\nunder \"Supplemental data\" in the online issue). Years of edu-\ncation were unrelated to plain water intake.\nAssociation of contributors of water intake with intake of\ndietary nutrients and other dietary components reported in\nThe plain water intake was positively associated with the\nreported intake of moisture in foods but inversely associated with\nbeverage moisture intake (P , 0.0001) (Table 2). However, the\nintakes of moisture in beverages and foods were unrelated (P .\n0.05). Dietary energy intake was unrelated to plain water intake,\nbut was a positive correlate of the moisture content of foods,\nbeverages, and total water (P , 0.0001). Dietary protein (as\npercentage of energy) was unrelated to total water and related\npositively to plain water and food moisture intake but inversely\nrelated to beverage moisture (P , 0.0001). Intakes of dietary fat\nand carbohydrate (as percentage of energy) were inversely re-\nlated to total water intake (P  0.007). Energy density (kilo-\ncalories per gram) of foods was an inverse correlate of plain\nwater, food moisture, and total water, but a positive correlate of\nbeverage moisture (P , 0.0001). Dietary fiber and sodium in-\ntakes were positively associated with all components of water\nintake. The moisture content of beverages and total water were\npositive correlates of 24-h caffeine and alcohol intakes. Total\nsugars were inversely related to plain water intake (P = 0.04),\nbut positively related to moisture in foods and beverages and\ntotal water (P  0.0001). With adjustment for energy intake, the\nassociations of these dietary variables with components of fluid\nintake were generally attenuated, and sodium and total sugar\nwere not related to total water intake.\nsociation differed from those mentioned above: food moisture\nwas unrelated to dietary fat, carbohydrate, and caffeine intake\n(Supplemenetal Table 2 under \"Supplemental data\" in the online\nissue). Intake of added sugar was inversely related to plain water,\nbut positively related to other water variables.\nMeal pattern correlates of contributors of water intake\nThe number and amount of nonbeverage foods were positively\nassociated with all water variables except beverage moisture\n(Table 3). The reported number of eating episodes, mention of\nbreakfast or a snack, and the percentage of 24-h energy con-\nsumed after 1700 were not related to plain water intake (P .\n0.05). The number of eating episodes and mention of a snack\nwere positive correlates of moisture in foods and beverages and\ntotal water. Those who reported breakfast or a snack reported\nhigher moisture content of foods (P , 0.0001). Mention of all\n5 food groups in the recall was associated with higher intake of\nmoisture in foods and total water (P  0.0003), but not with\nplain water or beverage moisture.

The Healthy Eating Index\nwas unrelated to plain water intake but predicted higher food\nmoisture and total water intake.\nAssociation of self-reported body-weight-related variables\nwith contributors of water intake in the 24-h recall in\nSelf-perception of body weight was a weak independent\ncorrelate of beverage moisture intake (Table 4).

Relative to other smoking categories, current\nsmokers had the highest total water intake, largely because of\nhigher beverage moisture, given that the plain water and food\nwater intakes among smokers were lower. De Castro and Taylor\n(10) have also reported higher beverage intake in smokers.\nNotably, both leisure and average daily physical activity were\nassociated with total water intake; however, the association\nreflected higher plain water intake by those reporting any leisure\nactivity, but higher beverage intake by those reporting higher\naverage daily activity. Because fruits and vegetables are dietary\nconstituents with the highest water content, higher food moisture\nintake (noted in association with higher education, never/former\nsmokers, and recalls on weekdays) may be interpreted as in-\ndicating diets with likely contributions of these desirable food\ngroups. Arguably, higher food moisture intake may also reflect\nhigher food quantity intake; however, the observed associations\nremained unchanged by adjustment for energy intake (related to\namount of food). (Energy-adjusted estimates are not shown in\nTable 1 but are available from the authors.)\nThe inverse association of plain water intake with beverage\nmoisture but positive association with moisture in foods suggests\nsome substitution effect of plain water intake on beverage\nconsumption and possibly higher fruit and vegetable intake.\nAlthough these associations may be expected to affect energy\nintake, we found plain water and energy intake to be unrelated in\nall surveys. Popkin et al (8) have reported lower energy intake in\nassociation with plain water intake. We caution that these\ncomparisons are problematic because the analysis in the above\nstudy used a different definition of water and compared plain\nwater reporters and nonreporters, and the reported findings ap-\npear to be unadjusted for confounding due to factors related to\nenergy and water intake. Nevertheless, the associations of the\nintake of plain water with dietary fiber intake (positive), energy\ndensity of foods, and total and added sugars (inverse) do suggest\ndifferent dietary selections in relation to plain water intake. Other\ndietary characteristics examined in this study (intakes of protein,\ndietary fiber, sodium, caffeine, and alcohol) were discussed in the\nInstitute of Medicine report as possible determinants of water\nrequirements (1). All of these variables (except dietary protein\nintake and sodium intakes) showed positive associations with\ntotal water intake with and without adjustment for energy intake\nin our study. To our knowledge, there is no published information\non these associations to allow comparisons.\nSurprisingly, few studies have examined the association of\ndietary sodium intake with components of water intake (27, 28).\nA recent study has suggested that the association of sodium intake\nwith the intake of sweetened beverages may be a mechanism for\ninducing positive energy balance with consequent weight gain\nin children (29). However, in the present study, with adjustment\nfor energy intake--although sodium intake remained a positive\ncorrelate of food moisture--the association with beverage\nmoisture became inverse, and the overall association with\ntotal water intake was no longer significant. These observa-\ntions suggest that sodium and total water intake association\nmay largely reflect the association of food quantity and sodium\nintake.\nThe associations of reported meal patterns (number of eating\nepisodes, mention of breakfast or snack in the recall, and extent of\nenergy consumed in the evening) with plain water intake were\ngenerally unremarkable.

In the\npresent study, beverage moisture and total water intake increased\nwith increasing BMI in all surveys; however, the association of\nplain water intake with BMI and weight-related variables (history\nof attempted weight loss in the previous year and desire to weigh\nthese differences reflect different methods for collection of plain\nknown.\nIncreasing consumption of sweetened beverages has been\nsuggested as a potential contributor to higher energy intake with\nconsequent weight gain in the US population (5, 32). Moreover,\nthere is evidence that the satiating effect of beverages is lower\nthan that of solid foods with possibly poor regulation of the\nresulting liquid energy intake (33). As expected, we observed an\ninverse association of food moisture with the energy density of\nfoods (34). However, our results indicate that plain water and\nbeverage consumption had a divergent association with the en-\nergy density of foods reported in the recall with plain water\npredicting lower energy density and beverage intake predicting\nhigher energy density of foods, which suggests that another\nmechanism for higher energy intakes (beverage consumption)\noperates in association with high-energy density diets.\nBecause of within-person variability in food intake, a single\n24-h dietary recall is not suitable for determining usual intake\ndistributions (24); therefore, we do not attempt to describe usual\nintake distributions of various contributors of daily water intake.\nWe present population means and standard errors (for which\na 24-h recall provides an unbiased estimate) for the various water\nvariables and, when we examine associations, they are within the\ncontext of the 24-h recall. Measurement error, especially the\nmisreporting of energy intake, is an acknowledged problem in all\ndietary assessment methods (24). Although the use of automated\nmultiple-pass methods to obtain the 24-h dietary recall is an\nimprovement over older methods of collecting recalls, under-\nreporting of energy intake, especially in association with body\nweight, remains a problem (35). In a study of the sources of\nreporting errors in the automated multiple-pass method, bev-\nerages and vegetables were the largest contributors to energy\nreporting bias in highly educated lean men (36). Although our\nanalyses were adjusted for subject characteristics (such as body\nweight, level of education, and income) with known associations\nwith reporting errors, we acknowledge that it is likely that\nbeverage moisture, food moisture, and total water intake may be\nunderestimated in our study. Finally, although our study provides\nestimates of various contributors to total water intake adjusted for\nmultiple covariates, the NHANES public release data do not\ninclude information on geographic location and season of exam.\nWe expect geographic location and season of exam to be highly\ncorrelated in the NHANES data. We note that an analysis of the\ndata found relatively little seasonal variation in water intake\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that contributors of total\nwater vary with respect to the sociodemographic and lifestyle\ncharacteristics of the US population and in association with\nselected dietary characteristics. Given the divergent associations\nof plain water compared with beverage moisture intakes with\ndietary energy, fiber, sugars, and energy density, the study pro-\nvides evidence to encourage water intake over beverages and\nattests to the need to examine contributors of water along with\ntotal water intake.\nWe thank Lisa Licitra Kahle, Information Management Services Inc, Silver\nSpring, MD, for expert programming support.\nThe authors' responsibilities were as follows--AKK: responsible for all\naspects of this study--conceptualization of the study question, analytic strat-\negy, data analysis, interpretation of study results, and preparation of the man-\nuscript; BIG: involved in the conceptualization of the study question, analytic\nstrategy, interpretation of study results, and editing of initial drafts for scien-\ntific content; and EAA: involved in the conceptualization of the study ques-\ntion, literature review, and operationalalization of initial exposure variables.\nNone of the authors had a conflict of interest.\nREFERENCES\n1.
