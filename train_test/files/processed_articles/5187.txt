    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article examines the requirements for quality learning in Islam from the perspective of al-Zarnj and according to his\nbook, Ta`lm al-Muta`allim. This book has been a source of reference for both students and teachers in many educational\ninstitutions in Muslim countries, particularly, the Islamic boarding schools in Indonesia. The article attempts to understand\nthe students' learning requirements proposed by al-Zarnj in the above treatise. It is, therefore, a library-based research.\nThe research tackles many issues. It addresses the need for a broad-based learning process and analyzes the requirements\nin the light of the modern day learning circumstances. It was found that al-Zarnj's theory of quality learning is conditional\non six main principles which are, indeed, determinants of quality student outcomes. These are intelligence or high learning\nability; high motivation for learning; patience, emotional stability, and commitment to the learning process; availability of\nfinancial support; inspiration of the teachers; and disposition to time management in the learning process. The notion of\nquality education is fundamental to the classical perspective of learning in Islam.\n",

However, the present global\neducational situations occasionally give cause for concern.\nScholars are reviewing the current educational conditions to\ninfluence alternative policy making in educational institu-\ntions. In the Islamic context, there are equally many interre-\nlated issues that have been carefully reviewed (Halstead,\n2004). Consequently, Muslim scholars have advocated that\nan education system that is oriented toward the understand-\ning of life both here and the hereafter should be prioritized in\nMuslim societies.\nBy providing the guidelines that enhance the promotion\nof the individual's physical and ethical character, Islamic\neducation could be conceived as a process of learning that\nshapes and transforms the individual's intellectual experi-\nences and social behavior (al-Syaibany, 1979). Quality edu-\ncation is determined by not only individual human factors,\nbut also external conditions including the educational envi-\nronment. For instance, the educational environment plays a\nsignificant role in shaping the individual's character (whether\nas a child or as an adult). The conditions of the educational\nenvironment has an impact on the attainment of the goals of\neducation because they augment the effort of the teachers in\nimparting values to the students. It is an established fact that\neducation is obligatory on all Muslims, male or female.\nDespite that, for al-Zarnj, quality learning has certain\nrequirements that must be considered before it can be\nachieved. Indeed, knowledge acquisition is a process that is\nmade up of progressive steps each of which has its own\nrequirements (i.e., what has to be fulfilled before the student\ncan progress to that level). Therefore, while students are\nexpected to fulfill certain requirements before progressing to\nevery level, the institutions should themselves design the\nprinciples as well as the effective ways to apply them for bet-\nter results at each of these levels.\nAl-Zarnj's Ta`lm al-Muta`allim provides valuable\ninsights into the essential principles of teaching and learning,\nwhich could still be useful for both students and teachers and,\nfor that matter, Islamic educational institutions. Thus, the\nmain reasons for selecting this book, as Huda and Kartanegara\n1Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Malaysia\n2Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei\nCorresponding Author:\nMiftachul Huda, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Malaysia.\nEmail: hudaelhalim@yahoo.co.id\nUnderstanding Comprehensive Learning\nRequirements in the Light of al-Zarnj's\nTa`lm al-Muta`allim\nMiftachul Huda1, Jibrail Bin Yusuf2, Kamarul Azmi Jasmi1,\nand Gamal Nasir Zakaria2\n Keywords\nAl-Zarnj, Ta`lm al-Muta`allim, ethics, learning requirements, Islam\n2 SAGE Open\n(2015b) have outlined, are as follows. First, its principles\nhave been applied in designing many policies in educational\ninstitutions in the Muslim world, particularly the pesantren in\nIndonesia. Second, its model of teaching and learning is suit-\nable for achieving the aim of Islamic education. Finally, the\ncontent of the book forms the basic foundation of the current\neducation system in Muslim countries. Therefore, in the light\nof the contemporary educational circumstances, this article\nisolates and examines the requirements that, according to the\nbook, students and, to a large extent, teachers must fulfill to\nbe able to engage in and promote quality learning from the\nIslamic perspective.\nBrief Biography of Al-Zarnj and a\nGlimpse of His Ta`lm Al-Muta`allim\nAl-Zarnj was born in Zarnuj (Athiyatullah, 1970), a small\ntown in Eastern Turkistan, a state adjoining River Tigris. He\nwas one of the Islamic educational philosophers (and, indeed,\none of the pioneers in the field of Islamic education) who\nlived in the 13th century during the Abbasid regime. He\nbelonged to the Hanaf School of Islamic jurisprudence. He\noutlined his educational thought in the treatise entitled,\nTa`lim al-Muta`allim, in which he explores the ethical guide-\nlines both the teacher (the mu`allim) and the student (the\nmuta`allim) could follow to achieve better results in the\nteaching and learning process. Al-Zarnj is associated with\ntwo names (Athiyatullah, 1970). One is honorific (i.e.,\nBurhn al-Dn) while the other is his actual name (i.e., Tj\nal-Dn Nu`mn b. Ibrhm b. al-Khall al-Zarnj;\nHe is reported to have understudied and corresponded\nwith several scholars during the period of his learning.\nHowever, the following appear to be the most popular\n1. Fakhr al-Islm al-H\n. asan Ibn Mansr al Farghn\n2. Zahir al-Dn al-H\nce);\n4. Burhn al-Dn `Al ibn Ab Bakr al-Farghinan\n5. Rukn al-Dn Muh\n.ammad b. Ab Bakr Khwarzade\nIt is reported that by 1203, al-Zarnj had compiled all the\n13 chapters of this book. For this reason, many of his biogra-\nphers argue that the book was written in the 13th century\n(Athiyatullah, 1970). However, it appears that much of the\nwork was done earlier. In any case, it is a widely acclaimed\npiece and it is used as a source of reference for research in the\nfield of education by Muslims and Western academics alike\n(Syamsyuddin, 2012). In the Islamic educational institutions,\nparticularly, the pesantren, the traditional Islamic boarding\nschools in Indonesia, Ta`lm al-Muta`allim is often regarded\nas the book of basic learning guidelines for students (Nata,\n2003). It is a unique piece of work because its principles\nexplain the ethical foundation of teaching and learning. The\n13 chapters of this discussion include issues relating to the\nnature and merit of knowledge, the intention at the time of\nthe study, the types of knowledge permissible to acquire, and\nrespect for knowledge and those who possesses it. Others\ninclude hard work and perseverance in the learning process,\nwhen to start and organize the lesson, and tawakkul (trust in\nGod). He also discusses the time for the acquisition of knowl-\nedge as well as time management in the teaching and learn-\ning process. Other topics include how to cooperate with and\nshow compassion to others in the learning process, issues\nrelating to self-discipline during the time of learning, how to\nimprove one's retentive memory and overcome forgetful-\nness, and how to survive materially during the period of\nlearning.\nIt could be argued that this treatise served a good purpose\nfor students. This is because, it appears, many students at that\ntime encountered certain difficulties in education and the\nacquisition of quality knowledge; hence, they failed to\nachieve their aims. According to al-Zarnj (2008), most of\nthese students did not successfully meet their goals because\nthey were not mindful of the correct methods of learning.\nThus, as Von Grunebaum and Abel (1947) conclude,\nal-Zarnj's discourse facilitated the devising of a better\nstudy approach or method to guide these students about\nwhom he had read and heard from his own teachers. In other\nwords, he believed that the students had not been taught what\nwas most beneficial for them and had, therefore, wasted the\nchunk of their time on unbeneficial knowledge.\nThe Purpose of Learning in Islam\nIn appreciating the purpose of learning in Islam, it is essen-\ntial to first understand the concept of education and its roots\nin Islam. Three words denote education in Arabic. These\nare ta`lm (which means, schooling, teaching, or instruc-\ntion), tarbiyyah (which means, breeding, upbringing, or\nnurturing), and ma`rifah (which basically means, knowl-\nedge or know-how about something, learning, awareness\nabout a piece of information, etc.). Although the above\nwords, apparently, refer to different aspects of human\nawareness, all of them revolve around the concept of edu-\ncation. Quality education facilitates the expansion of one's\nknowledge and the development of good manners (Halstead,\n2004). Thus, there is a significant overlap between the three\nwords. At the core of the Islamic concept of education are\nthe principles that demand the production of graduates with\ngood morals, understanding of the Islamic codes of con-\nduct, and commitment to the belief in God (tawhd). In\nIslam, education is oriented to the tenets of the religion,\nwhich uphold the belief in God. The assumption is that,\nfrom the perspective of Islam, what is moral is religious;\nHuda et al. 3\nand so morality serves as the foundation of all processes\nincluding education, which is the process of creating and\nnurturing the human personality to absorb what is good.\nHowever, secular ethicists argue that although it is impos-\nsible to be religious without morality, it is possible to pro-\nmote morality without religion (Halstead, 2004; McKay &\nargument is that what is morally good does not necessarily\nimply or score a religious value and vice versa. By this\nunderstanding of morality or ethics, therefore, what is valu-\nable in the sight of religious people does not necessarily\nappear as ethical or moral on its own. Here, morality and\nethics are used interchangeably because what is morally\nNonetheless, in Islam, morality or ethics is always deter-\nmined by religious values and what is religiously com-\nmanded invariably becomes a moral obligation. Therefore,\nthe presence of morality is essential in Islamic education,\nwhich is to nurture morally inclined learned men and\nwomen to contribute to society's development.\nWhatever form it takes, education is expected to pre-\npare the students to work toward the achievement of cer-\ntain goals in life. Based on this principle, therefore, every\nlevel of education should have a purpose for the student\nand this has to be oriented to the well-being of both the\nindividual and the larger society. The specific purpose set\nfor any particular aspect of education is crucial for (a)\nassessing the benefit of that aspect for the society and (b)\nmeasuring the quality of the teaching process. Quality\nteaching prepares the students to face future challenges\nand serves as the basic requirement for achieving societal\ngoals. Hence, the purpose set for any field of education\ndetermines how dynamic the graduates that would be pro-\nduced would be. This implies that the teachers themselves\nhave to be dynamic at any material moment to facilitate the\nsetting up of a good standard for the transformation of\nhuman life in its entirety. In this regard, it is the methods\nthat are capable of aiding the achievement of the educa-\ntional purpose that will be used in the teaching and learn-\ning process at each level. In other words, the implementation\nof the entire principles of education and the formulation of\nteaching and learning methods are guided by the set pur-\npose. This is because all efforts would be focused on the\npurpose. In setting the purpose for any field of study, three\ncore issues must be borne in mind. These are the target\npopulation or the caliber of people it is designed for (i.e.,\nits objective for the human society), the accessible or pro-\njected societal needs (i.e., present, growing, and future\ndemands in the society). This is the consideration of the\nessential human needs and demands in the society\n(Marimba, 1989). The other is the implication of this field\nfor the Islamic way of life (Marimba, 1989). The above are\nrequired in setting a quality purpose in education from the\nIslamic perspective.\nQuality education has a clear purpose that applies to both\nthe learner and the educator (the teacher), and each of these\nknows his own rights and responsibilities (Jonassen &\nGrabowski, 2012). It is important to emphasize that educa-\ntion is a cooperative process in which individuals study\ntogether to achieve a purpose and equip themselves with the\nmethods for solving problems. Therefore, the best system of\neducation is basically built on problem-based learning. The\naim of education, and, indeed, the standard by which educa-\ntional success is measured, is the transformation of the indi-\nvidual through the development of both the moral and the\nrational selves. In Islam, therefore, the ideal education does\nnot only focus on good character-building (attitude) and spir-\nituality but it is also expected to create a worthwhile purpose\nor vision for the student. Thus, the curriculum has to be prac-\ntical. The assumption is that, in today's world, human perfec-\ntion cannot be achieved with religious knowledge alone.\nTherefore, its integration with the practical sciences reflects\nthe overall essence of knowledge in Islam, which accelerates\ntransformation in terms of spirituality, character, and mate-\nrial well-being and survival (al-Zarnj, 2008).\nThe purpose of the Islamic educational curriculum is to\ndesign topics that will equip the students with a competent\ntechnical know-how while sustaining their spirituality and\nreligious identity (al-Abrasy, 1975). However, the objective\nof the spiritual or religious aspects is to increase the student's\nawareness about his baser-self to transform him into the ideal\nperson the Islamic society expects. This is the main priority\nof education from the Islamic point of view. In Islam, human\nwelfare comprises spiritual and physical aspects. Thus,\nal-Zarnj argues that an individual who endeavors to learn\nmust first set the following general purposes for himself to\nsucceed. To\nAcquire knowledge about God and issues about the creation\nof humankind\n2. Make oneself pleasing to Allah\n3. Facilitate one's happiness here and in the hereafter\n4. Overcome one's own ignorance as well as that of others\nLive a religious life and maintain the Islamic religious\ntenets in one's life\nImprove one's cognition (`aql) to better oneself in the\nFrom the above, the student's purposes could be classified\ninto three main categories. These are the purposes that relate\nto the issues of `ibdah, the ultimate purpose of education in\nIslam. The rest are the purposes that relate to interpersonal or\nsocial (mu`malt) matters and the purposes set for the indi-\nvidual's material development (Huda & Kartanegara, 2015a).\nHowever, from al-Zarnj's perspective, the combination of\nthe above purposes, namely, the religious, the social, and the\nindividual's development-motivated purposes, determine\nhow successful the entire teaching and learning process\n4 SAGE Open\nwould be. This implies that, in education, the setting of the\nright purpose is a basic necessity. It is undeniable that social\nand individual developments are major goals of education\ntoday. Therefore, the same variables are expected to influ-\nence the purpose set by both the teacher and the student in all\nthe teaching and learning processes in order that the ethical\naspects will remain intact.\nEthical Considerations in the Learning\nProcess\nThe Islamic ethics on learning emphasize the responsibility\nof the students to their teacher in the course of the study.\nThese ethics, therefore, emphasize that the students must\naccord the teacher, and generally, all those who possess\nknowledge, a maximum respect. Besides the above, what\nthe students learn also has ethical implications. According\nto al-Zarnj, in designing a curriculum, the purpose as well\nas the ethical aspects (i.e., its religious implications) should\nbe carefully considered to ensure that they are in harmony\nwith the principles of Islam. He argues that not all fields of\nknowledge are ethical for consideration in education from\nthe Islamic perspective. Among the ethical fields are medi-\ncal science and, of course, Islamic jurisprudence. These are\nthe fields of knowledge that are useful for the society.\nHowever, in selecting the beneficial types of knowledge,\nthe availability of experienced or qualified teachers for\nthose fields is also an important prerequisite. In the third\nchapter of his Ta`lim al-Muta`allim, al-Zarnj illustrates\nthe key points that enable students to determine which\nfields are ethical and which are not. Students have to think\ncarefully before they choose disciplines in the course of\nlearning. Besides the general purposes enumerated earlier,\nal-Zarnj also suggests that students select fields of learn-\ning in accordance with the specific purpose or goals they\nhave set for themselves in life. This implies that the parents'\nchoices for their wards do not find favor here because the\nstudent's personal interest is very crucial in the choice of an\neducational career. Even so, he also argues that a field like\nastronomy is good for the Muslim students on condition\nthat one learns only what is helpful for determining the\ntimes and direction (qiblah) of worship. Thus, here too, he\nopines that the most recommended fields are those that\nhave a bearing on one's spiritual development (al-Zarnj,\nIn terms of the quality learning dynamics, however, the\nabove features help to identify the fields that are relevant for\nachieving the student's purpose or goal while synchronizing\nthat purpose with the Islamic values. For example, if a stu-\ndent purports to become an engineer, ethically, one must find\nout whether engineering is consistent with Islamic values. If\nthey are found to be compatible, then, as mathematics (M)\nand science (S) are basic to engineering, in addition to the\nIslamic values, the student must be encouraged to study\nM&S as requirements for achieving the purpose of becoming\nan engineer. This helps to nurture potentials without hurting\nthe Islamic values (Paramboor & Ibrahim, 2014).\nIn connection with the ethical issues in teaching and\nlearning, al-Zarnj identifies three types of human beings.\n1. The first category covers the virtuous person who\nalways not only expresses a good opinion, but also\ninteracts with and consults virtuous and intelligent\npeople. A person with good intellectual potentials\noffers good advice or counseling to his fellows and\nalmost always transforms his followers into people of\nfine morals, wisdom, and tolerance. Therefore, if this\nperson were to be a teacher, through his good super-\nvision, guidance, and counseling, his students would\ninteract better and engage with his instructions\n2. The second category is lower than the first one. This\nperson has no correct opinion about anything.\nNonetheless, he makes effort to consult others who\nmight know to update him. As it has been indicated,\nhe has no proper opinion of his own. However, a stu-\ndent who always has his own opinion about issues is\nmore inclined to learn to be analytic, looks at issues\ncritically, and attempts to recognize and solve prob-\nlems in a creative way. The one with a weak opinion\nabout things is often close-minded because he learns\nonly by listening to others. This type of person often\nturns out to be conservative and uncreative in the way\nhe perceives things. He always emphasizes the neces-\nsity for precedence and opens up to ideas but only to\nthe extent that others have affirmed or recognized\nthem through their own reasoning (Paramboor &\n3. However, the third category is the one who neither\npossesses any correct opinion about anything nor\nconsults or seeks information from others. This is a\nsign of arrogance (takabbur) in the learning process.\nSuch a person often boasts about any little knowl-\nedge he happens to possess. It is about this person\nthat the Arabs have a proverb: Man qla l adr wa\nhuwa yata`allam afd\n.alu miman yadr wa huwa\nyata`zzam (which means, \"He who says `I do not\nknow' and learns is better than him who knows but\npuffs himself up\"). The implication of the above is\nthat there should be a conscious effort to always learn\nfrom others even if one is in the know. Furthermore,\nit is better to search for knowledge and information\nfrom those with experience in a given subject and\nlocation. This gives us a lead into the view that much\nof what one acquires is through listening; and this\ncould be from within or outside the formal instruc-\ntional environment. Thus, he who does not know is to\nupdate himself from his own colleagues or precursors\nwho have the expertise and experience. In addition,\none is to remain open-minded and be willing to share\nHuda et al. 5\nwith others. This implies that an educational environ-\nment populated by virtuous and intelligent students\nor scholars is likely to produce virtuous and open-\nminded scholars and vice versa.\nPeople who are inclined to share and receive from others\nincrease their knowledge more than those who stay on the\nislands of their own wisdom. This is because teaching not\nonly imparts knowledge, but it also improves a person's wis-\ndom and increases his awareness. That is why the prophet is\nreported to have said that the best (the most virtuous) among\nhumankind are those who learn and teach it to others.\nAlthough, regarding this, he was particularly referring to the\nteaching and learning of the Qur'an, the pivot of Islamic\nknowledge. Nonetheless, consistent with al-Zarnj, the\nIslamic knowledge, for which the Qur'an serves as the focal\npoint of reference, transcends beyond mere spiritual (naqli)\nknowledge to rational (`aqli) knowledge like medical sci-\nence, and so forth, as well. It could be argued that Muslim\nprofessionals like medical doctors and engineers who are\nalso well-educated religiously or morally set for themselves\nbetter goals in life, which are often consistent with the\nIslamic belief in God.\nDue to the significant role ethics plays in the Islamic\nteaching and learning process, al-Zarnj proposes that\nteachers should focus more on the moral challenges in the\nsociety (al-Zarnj, 2008). In contemporary times, when stu-\ndents are expected to aim toward specific goals, the technical\nknow-how to facilitate the achievement of those goals\nbecomes the main focus of attention in the teaching process\n(Elliott, 2015). A student who has high aspirations requires\ndedication to achieve his goals. Nonetheless, from the\nIslamic perspective, nothing could be properly accomplished\nwithout religious values or divine intervention. This is why\nthe learning process moves conterminously with the reli-\ngious ethics. Al-Zarnj points out that in building students'\nintellectual capabilities, the system should take into account\nthe ethical issues bordering on human relationship such as\nrespect, humility, and obedience. These issues are crucial to\nsuccessful learning even in modern times.\nFrom the foregoing discussion, it has become clear that,\nin Islam, morality plays a vital role in shaping student's\nfuture aspirations. This makes the learning a mechanical pro-\ncess of facilitating the student's moral and rational transfor-\nmation through the application of specific principles. For\nthat reason, the programs ought to be relevant to the student's\ngoals as well as those of the society. In this vein, the studied\nprograms are expected to move hand-in-hand with the needs\nof the larger society. This is to enable the graduates to use\ntheir expertise to contribute toward the achievement of soci-\netal goals in the long run. That is necessary because the soci-\nety is the ultimate target of the entire education system.\nHowever, it appears that the issue of how to design quality\nprograms that back students' purposes in life while helping\nsociety to achieve its goals remains a major challenge of\neducation at all levels today. Yet, addressing this challenge is\ncrucial in helping students to properly engage with the core\nelements of learning in a comprehensive way.\nToward a Comprehensive Learning\nProcess\nGenerally, learning (ta`lm) can be conceived as the process\nof acquiring knowledge. Therefore, its main features are crit-\nical thinking and pragmatic problem-solving skills\n(Weinstein, 2012). The urge to learn can be active in a person\nthroughout his lifetime. This is because it is a human instinct.\nDespite this, the understanding of what happens in a person's\nimmediate surroundings is part and parcel of the individual's\nthinking skills, and this increases during the period of learn-\ning in school. One's physical experience in a particular envi-\nronment influences one's intellectual behavior, sense of\njudgment, and ability to solve problems. Thus, an individual\nwho studies in an educational environment where ethical\nstandards are very low is likely to have a different under-\nstanding of what is right or wrong in the larger society. A\ncomprehensive teaching that imparts to students virtues in\ncombination with critical thinking and problem-solving\nskills produces individuals who serve the society better. In\nensuring that students' behavior and character are shaped\nwithin the learning environment, it is important to design the\nprinciple for regulating their interactions. These principles\ngrant the teachers the opportunity to assess the students'\nproblem-solving capabilities through observation, for exam-\nple, during extracurricular activities. Educational principles\nare often designed using alternative strategies such as peer\nreview and institutional networking, all of which play sig-\nnificant roles in enhancing the quality of teaching and learn-\ning (Elliott, 2015). When teachers show active interest in\nstudents'moral well-being both in and outside the classroom,\nthey create the atmosphere for the students to support each\nother to learn these moral values. Thus, from the Islamic per-\nspective, a comprehensive learning takes place within an\neducation system in which the essential guidelines for teach-\ning and learning are guided by these tenets.\nFor this reason, al-Zarnj posits that the teaching and\nlearning process has some core features (al-Zarnj, 2008).\nThe teacher transfers knowledge through lectures on a sub-\nject to the student. The student is then expected to preserve it\nby not only listening but also writing, carefully observing,\nbehaving calmly, and trusting in God (tawakkul). Indeed,\nthese features are very important and manifest in the teach-\ning and learning process at all levels. Learning also involves\nthe acquisition of skills (be it for reasoning or for solving\nproblems), transformation of human behavior, and the man-\nagement of personal preferences (Jonassen & Grabowski,\n2012). It, therefore, aims toward the development of the per-\nson in totality (Brophy, 2013). However, the learning ability\ndevelops in stages. Therefore, the quality of the conditions,\nboth within and outside the classroom, is fundamental to the\n6 SAGE Open\nholistic or comprehensive learning process because it\nenhances the students' gradual self-awareness and in-depth\nappreciation of the processes of life.\nRequirements of Comprehensive\nLearning\nThe theory of learning is largely based on the fundamental\nassumption that the student is at the center of the teaching\nand learning process (Slade & Prinsloo, 2013). For this\nreason, any attempt to improve the problem-solving exper-\ntise of students must include educational principles that\nincorporate various skills or subjects. While the skills for\nresolving complex problems are major components of edu-\ncation programs, these skills require customized learning.\nIt is from this perspective that al-Zarnj argues that, if the\ntraining and development programs target the students'\nmind and spiritual self, the students will be prepared to\nface all challenges. Thus, among such training and devel-\nopment programs is what will aim at both the physical\ntransformation and the building of the soul (al-Zarnj,\n2008). The contextual meaning of \"building the soul\" is\nspiritual self-discipline or continence, which is central to\nhard work within the social context. However, self-disci-\npline or continence also implies forbearance in carrying\nout duties in the learning process. This demands careful\nplanning, observation, and evaluation, all of which require\ncreativity and self-control (Zimmerman, 2008). It is impor-\ntant to note that if students are guided in the learning pro-\ncess by experienced teachers, they show creativity in their\nway of thinking and doing things.As the teacher is expected\nto guide the students in a learning process in which both\nthe ethical and technical aspects shall move hand-in-hand,\nthe teacher becomes an all-inclusive or comprehensive\neducator, the moral educator (murabb) of Hussein Nasr\n(1987). This is because the above conglomerates will ulti-\nmately lead to comprehensive education that will promote\nself-criticism or introspection, self-discipline, self-motiva-\ntion, and willingness toward self-responsibility. This will,\nin turn, encourage the student's self-reliance, self-assur-\nance, independent thinking, and spiritual fortitude that will\neventually make him the perfect man (insn al-kmil) in\nthe Muslim society.\nIn addition to the above coordinates that will help to bring\nabout comprehensive education from the Islamic educational\nperspective, many other variables are needed to sustain it.\nThe provision of sustainable support for achieving results-\noriented education is a necessity for modern life. This is due\nto the significant role education plays in developing and\nnourishing people's potentials for continuous societal\ngrowth. That suggests that to facilitate a comprehensive\nlearning, all important stakeholders of an educational institu-\ntion must discharge their duties as required. In examining\ncomprehensive learning, al-Zarnj outlines six important\nrequirements. These include holistic intelligence or capabil-\nity for learning, motivation for learning, patience and com-\nmitment to the learning process, affordability and financial\nsupport, teacher's inspiration and determination, and com-\nmitment to time management in learning. As the above are\ncrucial for the comprehensive education, we shall examine\nthem below.\nHolistic Intelligence or Capability for Learning\nAl-Zarnj points out that the first requirement for learning is\nintelligence. This requirement weighs more on the side of the\nstudent than the teacher although, as a matter of fact, it is a\nrequirement for the teacher as well. Intelligence here is the\nability to understand the relationships between issues through\nthe process of mental abstraction and sensitization of data\nthat create new methods for solving difficult problems\n(Chiappe & MacDonald, 2005). This becomes an important\nmotivation for learning in the first place because it reduces\npressure on the brain. An intelligent student solves research\nproblems easily without stress and this encourages him to\nlearn more. This suggests that intelligence, as the capacity to\nacquire and apply knowledge, accelerates the performance of\nthe intellect and the ability to reason, which, in every practi-\ncal sense, bears the logic of education at all its levels today.\nNaturally, a high level of intelligence enables people to think,\nunderstand, and properly reason about what they see or per-\nceive. Beyond that, intelligence also helps one to practically\ntransform a piece of idea into tangible product or use this\nidea to formulate new theories. The intellect at this level is\nthe developed form that tries to contextualize ideas to gener-\nate new ones for improving one's well-being (Br\u00e5ten &\nStr\u00f8ms\u00f8, 2004). Given that every human being possesses a\ndifferent level of intelligence, the ability to understand infor-\nmation or interpret data also varies significantly. This\nexplains why students perform differently at the same level\nof education. Thus, as it has been indicated in al-Zarnj's\nTa`lm al-Muta`allim, intelligence is significant in the learn-\ning process because it helps the students to interact with\nideas.\nIntelligence determines a person's ability to learn. This is\nbecause it describes the human ability to skillfully use reason\nto understand ideas in a variety of situations and to apply this\nknowledge in different circumstances of life. The cognitive\nprocess has many aspects. These include, among others, mem-\norizing, logical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving tech-\nniques (Sternberg & Grigorenko, 2004). Indeed, al-Zarnj\nemphasizes that a successful learning requires the effective-\nness of all the aspects of one's cognition. Thus, in the context\nof applied behavioral knowledge, particularly clinical psy-\nchology, the human intellect has been one of the most widely\nresearched topics. High level of intelligence implies fully\ndeveloped cognitive ability and these, together, determine the\nsuccess of the comprehensive learning process.\nHuda et al. 7\nMotivation for Learning\nIn education, the motivation to learn plays an important role\nin encouraging the student. This requirement is of primary\nimportance or, perhaps, even more important than the first\none. This is because an intelligent person who finds himself\nin a school but does not have the slightest motivation to learn\nany particular field of study is like a round peg put in a square\nhole. The flair for learning, which al-Zarnj refers to as\nmotivation, arises from the combination of conscious, sub-\nconscious, and unconscious factors. These are the intensity\nof the student's desire or need, moral incentive or the value\nof the expected outcome, and personal expectations. These\nfactors also serve as the background for the achievement of\ngoals. For example, a student expends extra energy in study-\ning for a test because he or she wants a good grade. Here, the\ndesire for a good grade, which ultimately serves as the\nbenchmark for getting a good job after school, motivates him\nto learn more although he might not be so intelligent. Thus,\nmotivation is very important for learning. In the conscious\nattempt to acquire a particular skill, therefore, motivation\nbecomes a major consideration. For the teachers, however,\ndedication and self-sacrifice are major motivations (Huda &\nKartanegara, 2015c) although there are many others.\nMotivation enables the individuals to pursue their goals\nwith enthusiasm and conscious effort. Consciousness\nincreases one's learning potentials and ability to grasp ideas\n(Schutte et al., 1998). It facilitates personal concentration,\nwhich in turn enables a student to perform well in class.\nTherefore, motivation has a substantial impact on the emo-\ntional well-being of students and this manifests in the out-\ncomes either positively or negatively (Runco, 2005). It\nreflects in the performance of students in a wide range of\nactivities. In short, motivation affects all the personal deci-\nsions of a learner. It plays a leading role in enhancing the\ndesire that backs the achievement of goals. As it has already\nbeen implied, it enables students to accomplish a task with an\nengrossing interest. This is, irrespective of whether it is easy\nor difficult, because motivation not only increases their\ndesires but it also maintains their enthusiasm and resilience\nAl-Zarnj also posits that students are also motivated if\nthe teacher pays maximum attention to their opinions, judg-\nments, and values and appreciates their efforts and perfor-\nmance in the learning process. This is a good motivation\nbecause human beings are naturally more disposed to do bet-\nter when praised than when criticized; therefore, at the ele-\nmentary levels of learning, this should be taken seriously.\nPatience and Emotional Commitment to Learning\nPatience is a stable state of mind that enables a person to toler-\nate either delays in the fulfillment of personal goals or, particu-\nlarly, the prolongation of suffering without anxiety. In Islam,\npatience (sabr) is viewed as an important human quality. It\nconcerns the ability to persevere in time of inconveniences and\nthe subconscious effort to trust in God for the right time. In\nthis case, one could argue that the Islamic concept of patience\nhas a close affinity to the trust in God (tawakkul) which is\nwithin the ambit of the development of the soul. The soul\nremains active even in the face of severe challenges.\nNonetheless, the human physical ability to resist these chal-\nlenges is always a problem in the mundane existence.\nGenerally, patience has two main dimensions (Shihab, 2007).\nThese are\n1. The physical (external) dimension: This denotes the\nability to relax or persevere, for example, in the dis-\ncharge of one's religious duties such as prayers, hajj,\nand so forth. It is obvious that impatience could affect\nthe quality of one's prayers, whether in a congrega-\ntion or not. Whoever is in a hurry does not pray prop-\nerly. This category also includes fortitude in times of\nsuffering and both natural and unnatural delays in the\nfulfillment of personal goals.\n2. The mental (internal) dimension: This includes the\nability to control one's desires in such a way that\none's behavior will be free from shameful character-\nistics or emotional conditions such as excessive\nanger, quick temper, and so forth.\nConsistent with al-Zarnj's discourse, both categories above\nare important for the student. A quick-tempered student is\nlikely to encounter challenges not only in relating with his\ncolleagues but, as well, his own teacher when he is rebuked.\nHowever, learning could be very frustrating at certain stages\nof one's life and requires patience and perseverance to suc-\nceed. This is the basis of the Arabic proverb which reads,\nal-najh `qibah al-ladhna yajtahidn [which literally\nmeans, \"success is the reward of those who work hard (per-\nsevere)\"]. Hence, in the process of education, it is necessary\nfor students to be patient in all its categories. For al-Zarnj\n(2008), being patient and steadfast is at the root of all suc-\ncess. Nonetheless, he also argues that rarely are there people\nwho can be patient in all things. This is in line with the axiom\nthat \"everything is surely intended to a certain level, even the\nhighest, but it is rare for anyone to keep up in achieving what\npatience is a major determinant of success in all aspects of\nhuman life.\nClosely associated with the issue of patience and perse-\nverance is what one could refer to as \"the staying power.\"\nAl-Zarnj puts forward some essential principles for\nenabling students to stay put and continue to exert mental\npower during the periods of learning. These include the\nfollowing.\n1. It is essential that students always learn under the\nguide of a teacher. Normally, when people learn by\nlistening, they relax, tolerate, and capture ideas faster\n8 SAGE Open\nthan when they read on their own. Therefore, for\nal-Zarnj, students should learn mainly by listening\nto the teacher during the instructional hours. It\nappears that, due to the rigorous nature of the educa-\ntion delivery at the higher level, where students are\nencouraged to do independent research, this principle\nmight be more relevant to younger learners. Yet, it\nshould be noted that even at the higher levels, stu-\ndents patiently listen to lectures delivered by their\nteachers. Even among terminal research students,\nthere are directed-reading and thinking (Valeri-Gold,\n1987) and consultation for thesis research. All these\nrequire students' patience in waiting and listening to\nthe teacher known by different titles at each of the\nlevels (e.g., teacher, tutor, lecturer, supervisor, or\nmentor). The contemporary university students face\nthe challenge of access to low-quality information\ndue to the upsurge of Internet resources. With the\nadvent of the worldwide web, the present university\nstudents have more access to information than any\nother generation of learners. Regrettably, however,\nmuch of this information is prejudiced, faulty, or\neven incorrect (El-Koumy, 2006). Many individuals\npromulgate mischievous information on the Internet\ndue to either ignorance or ill motive. This requires\nstudents to exert extra mental effort to synchronize\ntheir own thoughts with the information they read to\nthink beyond or outside the information box. In an\nera of human insecurity (Yusuf, 2014) caused mainly\nby misconstrued religious beliefs and values, higher\nresearch students'access to information is of primary\nconcern in higher Islamic educational institutions.\nTherefore, the teachers' directing of reading and\nresearch at all levels is very important.\n2. A student is not supposed to leave a book until he has\ncompletely grasped the content at any material\nmoment. This brings in the issue of perseverance.\nThe human mind captures ideas in stages. Hence,\nwhen one is learning for a purpose, putting the learn-\ning material or the book down when one has not fully\ncaptured its salient ideas is discouraged by al-Zarnj.\nThe implication is that one should attempt to study\nonly when one has adequate time for the learning.\nOnce one begins to learn, one must continue until one\nhas fully comprehended the lesson.\n3. A student should not leave a subject for another with-\nout having clearly understood the first one. This is,\nparticularly, important in one's private studies out-\nside the instructional hours. During this period,\nswitching between subjects is not the ideal.\n4. A student should not vacate the learning environment\nwhen specific lessons on a certain subject are in ses-\nsion unless one is forced by necessity (darrah).\nWhen one leaves a class while a lesson is in progress,\nit will take one some moments, when one returns, to\nadjust to the pace of learning with one's colleagues.\nTherefore, it is in the student's interest to wait for the\nteacher to conclude the lesson before deciding to\nleave.\nAs a skill in learning, patience is a virtue that enables stu-\ndents to endure in the course of their studies. Thus, persever-\nance and patience are crucial to learning. On the teacher's\nown side, patience is significant for tolerating the eccentric\nbehavior of students and ensuring their academic success.\nAffordability and Financial Support\nFinancial support is a major challenge in the quest for\nknowledge whether at the formal or the non-formal levels.\nIt is an important ingredient for achieving one's purpose in\neducation. A sound financial standing helps the student in\nthe payment of fees and eases the suffering caused by the\ncost of living during the learning period. This is because\nstudents are not to depend on others for their sustenance\nexpenditures in educational institutions. These, among\nothers, include tuition fees and the cost of the physical\nfacilities like books, the learning materials. The extent to\nwhich funds are available for managing the above has\nimplications for the performance of the student. A student\nwho has a reliable source of funding is better motivated to\nperform well in school.\nHowever, this financial support also does not concern\nthe student alone but the learning environment itself as well\nas the teachers. It is a fact that the instructors themselves\nare better motivated to give out their best if they are sup-\nported through the provision of Teaching and Learning\nMaterials (TLMs) necessary for at least the teaching pro-\ncess. When the necessary resources for both teaching and\nlearning are provided, then we can expect quality education\nthat reflects the commitment of the parties to bring about\nquality educational results. In creating an atmosphere for\nquality education delivery, therefore, funding is very impor-\ntant (Carnoy, 2000). Partnership can play a crucial role in\nsustaining quality education. This reduces the expenditure\nstudents may have to incur while supporting learners with\nlimited or inadequate financial resources (Pouncey, Ennis,\nWoolley, & Connell, 2013). This happens if a chunk of the\neducational expenses are borne by the state although that\nalso comes with its own challenge. The separation of edu-\ncational institutions from state funding affects the quality\nof education and, consequently, students' enrollment and\nopportunities. The success of educational institutions\nlargely depends on the availability of financial support (V.\nM. Robinson, 2007). This implies that the issue of funding\nis an important factor in the learning process be it on the\nside of the student or the teacher and whether at the lower\nor higher levels. This makes al-Zarnj's perspective in this\nregard very relevant today.\nHuda et al. 9\nThe Teacher's Inspiration\nThe role of teachers in inspiring students cannot be underes-\ntimated in the learning process. In the course of instruction, a\nstudent is expected to be inspired by the teacher. This inspi-\nration increases the student's emotional attachment to the\nlearning process. The teacher's way of instructing must sup-\nport the cognitive development of the student. As a moral\nagent in the learning environment, the teacher is an exemplar\nwhom the students would try to follow. Hence, this inspira-\ntion is essential. Al-Zarnj identifies three types of teachers.\nThese are\n1. Shaykh al-ta'lm: This refers to a teacher who merely\nimparts knowledge. He might or might not be inter-\nested in the students' moral well-being (akhlq). The\ninterest of this teacher is to improve the cognitive or\nmental ability (`aql) of the student.\n2. Shaykh al-tarbiyyah: This is the teacher who, in addi-\ntion to transforming the mind of the student, also\nconcerns himself with the student's moral\nwell-being.\n3. Shaykh al-tarqiyyah: This is the teacher whose\nmethod of teaching transforms the student's way of\nthinking (cognition), moral as well as the spiritual\nwell-being. This is the S\n.f-teacher who is superior to\nthe first two.\nThis means that, as a role model, the teacher must have a noble\npersonality that is worthy of emulation and respect. Students\noften observe the behavior and attitude of their teachers not\nonly during the teaching and learning process in the class-\nroom, but also, outside the learning environment. That being\nthe case, the teacher's role in inspiring the students with noble\nvalues must manifest both within the school and outside it. A\nnoble teacher possesses good character traits that influence his\nstudents to admire him (Osguthorpe, 2015). For al-Zarnj, the\nquality of education also depends on the ability of teachers to\nperform this key role in the process of teaching. Furthermore,\na good relationship between the student and the teacher is cru-\ncial for enabling this inspiration and the striving for excellence\nthrough guidance. However, achieving such a relationship\nrequires that the student respects the teacher. This will create\nthe enabling opportunity for the teacher to give out his best in\nsincere and dedicated manner through combined physical,\nmental, and spiritual efforts. This will eventually bring the\nteacher to the third category above.\nStudents are able to perform better under teachers who\nunderstand their weaknesses and show them love through\nprofessional guidance in class. However, a good relationship\nbetween the parents and the teachers is also very important in\nmaintaining respect between the teacher and his student.\nWhatever the case, as the teacher is an inspirer or a model for\nthe students, al-Zarnj (2008) maintains that it is necessary\nfor him to always stay away from reprehensible ways of life.\nTime Management in Learning\nTime management here refers to (a) the right time to learn\nand (b) how each period is utilized by both the teacher and\nthe student during the learning process. The first refers to the\ntime during which learning is most preferred. On the other\nhand, the second refers to the process of planning and orga-\nnizing the day into periods to make judicious use of time for\nspecific activities and increase productivity (Adair, 2009).\nAl-Zarnj maintains that learning requires careful manage-\nment of time. To achieve good results, both the teacher and\nthe student have to be cautious about time. The proper man-\nagement of time also has an impact on students'performance\nthat students perform better when certain subjects are taught\nduring specific periods of the day (Klein, 2001). For exam-\nple, the memorization (h\n.ifz\n.) of the Qur'n is better fit for the\nearly morning. This is because, apart from the spiritual ben-\nefits, according to a research by Millar, Styles, and Wastell\n(1980), morning learning has a superior immediate recall\nthan learning in the afternoon or evening although Wile and\nShouppe also argue that \"material initially learned in [the]\nafternoon is more beneficial to long-term memory recall\"\n(p. 21). Anyone who memorizes will surely forget something\nat some point. For this reason, although al-Zarnj argues\nthat listening to the teacher makes the learning easier, he fur-\nther stresses that through writing, students will be able to\nretain much of what they listen to from their teacher. This\nperspective of al-Zarnj explains the two main modes of\nlearning, namely, learning by listening and learning by writ-\ning. As it has already been stressed, the former is the easiest\nmode of learning. However, it requires a strong retentive\nmemory. On the contrary, the latter is the more difficult\nbecause it also involves listening, in addition to writing,\nreading, and memorizing. In other words, after one has lis-\ntened to the instruction and committed it to writing, one has\nto re-read later and memorize it. Nonetheless, al-Zarnj\nplaces much emphasis on writing (after listening) as the best\nmode of learning because it is the most effective type for\nstudents with weak and retentive memories alike. This is\nbecause everyone can refresh his memory from what he\nwrote down earlier in the event of forgetfulness, which is a\nlikely consequence of memorization. Furthermore, mathe-\nmatics is probably better grasped when it is taught in the\nmorning than in the afternoon depending on other factors\npeople pick a language faster when they begin to learn it\nwhen they are young, preferably before the age of puberty\n(Johnstone, 2002). This confirms the view by Penfield and\nchildren mature, certain changes in the brain gradually ren-\nder it incapable of absorbing languages unconsciously as it\noccurs in the formative years. From the above, it is clear that\nnot teaching or learning at the right time invariably affects\nthe quality of the outcome. Therefore, the prioritization of\nactivities is a necessity in time management and it helps to\nsynchronize the most important activities with the available\ntime space (Schutte et al., 1998). This suggests that specific\ntime management strategies have to be devised. Generally, a\nwell-structured educational institution has a department\n(e.g., timetable planning committee) for helping both teach-\ners and students to manage time wisely.\nIn spite of that, the effectiveness of time management also\ndepends on some other personal factors. The success in the\nmanagement of one's time varies largely according to indi-\nvidual abilities and responsibilities (Priem & Butler, 2001).\nThere are many ways by which time could be managed effec-\ntively for good learning results. One is to make an up-to-date\nrecord of all important personal activities in order of priority\nso that the most important ones come first. This is then fol-\nlowed by the allocation of specific periods for each of these\nactivities bearing in mind the effort one will have to put in\neach of those activities as well as the goal set for every par-\nticular activity.\nSome Important Reflections\nFrom the foregoing discussion, it could be realized that\nal-Zarnj's discourse on quality learning contains important\nprinciples that could be useful for improving the perfor-\nmance of students and teachers today. The principles of his\nbook, Ta`lim al-Muta`allim, could address important practi-\ncal shortfalls in the present implementation of educational\npolicies. The essential theme that applies to virtually all edu-\ncation systems is the production of good and well-informed\npersonalities whose knowledge will not only be relevant but,\nas well, transform the society and maintain moral values.\nFrom the Islamic perspective, these moral values include\nwhat, from the point of view of the Qur'an and the prophetic\nsunnan, is capable of ensuring peace and tranquility at all\nlevels of the society. For al-Zarnji, therefore, Islam under-\nstands education or learning as an all-inclusive phenomenon\nthat covers all aspects of human development, be it rational,\nspiritual, or emotional. Therefore, all these must be achieved\nby the student at the end of his training. From al-Zarnj's\nstandpoint, anything less than the above defeats the purpose\nof education. The aim of Islamic education is to produce\ngraduates with values to facilitate successful life here and in\nthe hereafter. To achieve this aim without compromising the\nscientific or rational knowledge that is needed for the soci-\nety's material well-being, these values are expected to be\nmerged with the scientific fields of knowledge. Islam views\nthis type of education as an obligation (fard\n.) and it could be\nincumbent on the individual alone (fard\n.u `ayn) or the society\nas a whole (fard\n.u kifyah). For this and other reasons, the\nquest for knowledge is seen as a form of worship (`ibdah;\nIt has also become clear that, despite the fact that educa-\ntion is an obligation for all Muslims, there are specific\nconditions or requirements that must be fulfilled before one\ncould seek knowledge or before learning could be success-\nful. Among these requirements, it appears that, although\nmotivation and, particularly, intellectual capability (Pintrich,\n2003) are basic, financial support and affordability could be\nconsidered as very essential for quality education. This is,\nparticularly, relevant in today's educational pursuit. Research\nindicates that on the average, the measure of total expendi-\nture per-student is closely linked with better student out-\n2002). It is obvious that the effect produced might be higher\nin some fields of study than in others. The implication is that,\nin some cases, additional financial support matters more for\nsome students than others. Nonetheless, there are many other\nfactors that could moderate the impact of funding on student\noutcomes. These include, among other things, the student's\nown manner of spending. When money is spent wisely, it\nyields good outcomes for students. Also, TLMs, teacher\ncompensation, the recruitment and retention of a higher qual-\nity teacher workforce, all of which have financial implica-\ntions, are closely linked with quality student outcomes\nfunding in education, the disposable funds in the hands of\nindividuals are always not enough at any material moment.\nThis necessitates the involvement of the state in the funding\nof education at all levels. Research indicates that the continu-\nous improvements in funding in public schools has an impact\nsion of funds to schools provides the necessary conditions\nfor improving the quality of their results.\nNonetheless, the fulfillment of these requirements might\nnot guarantee the overall quality and ideal outcome until the\nmechanisms for accountability for the utilization of educa-\ntional funds are devised. Funds have to be properly invested\n(Baker et al., 2012). This brings back the issues of purpose\nand goal. It is required that the available resources are\ndirected to support key areas such as quality teaching, a good\ncurriculum that details the principal elements for guiding the\nquality of teaching, and an effective program for financially\nvulnerable students (ETS Policy Information Center, 2008).\nThe latter can be achieved through effective supervision and\nmonitoring. From the above, it is clear that, fundamentally,\nthe public funding of education is to ensure that\n. . . all students have access to high quality educational\nopportunities that prepare them to assume the responsibilities of\ncitizenship and to succeed in the economy [i.e., the society].\nAlthough intelligence or intellectual capability is a sine qua\nnon for a successful academic journey, no matter how intel-\nligent a person can be, if the necessary funds to support this\nintelligence are not available at the right time, the achieve-\nment of goals cannot materialize. Although it might differ\nfrom one student to the other, the ability to grasp complex\nideas and adapt them effectively to social and environmental\ncircumstance is nurtured through the reading of books, be\nthey published materials or self-written manuscripts. All\nthese come with financial cost to the student. Therefore,\nbeing a good learner implies that one consistently associates\nwith these materials and engages in various forms of reason-\ning in the face of financial barriers. And this will invariably\naffect the quality of the outcome. Wisdom acquired through\nreading can be applied in solving everyday problems and for-\nmulating strategies for bettering one's life. In this case, the\nabsence of these reading or learning materials due to poor\nfunding detracts a lot from the learning outcomes.\nAnother point of interest is the teacher's inspiration of the\nstudent. Every teacher wishes to inspire his students to put up\ntheir maximum in the course of teaching and even after-\nwards. Yet, enhancing students' interest in the classroom and\nencouraging them to achieve success have been a major chal-\nlenge for teachers of all categories, including even the expe-\nrienced ones. If the content is not relevant to the students'\nexpectations and goals (Malouff, Rooke, Schutte, Foster, &\nBhullar, 2008), it diffuses their motivation to learn.\nFurthermore, a good student\u00adteacher relationship is an essen-\ntial tool for inspiring the student (Malouff et al., 2008). This\nimplies that a teacher who wishes to inspire his students must\nfirst establish a cordial relationship with them and, in the\nIslamic way, allow recommended ethics to guide this rela-\ntionship. Children are much inspired or motivated by people\nwho make them feel safe, whether emotionally or physically,\nwhenever they are with them. In addition, the style of teach-\ning also goes a long way to inspire the students. A teacher\nwho uses an appealing style to teach is more likely to inspire\nhis students in the teaching process than those who use an\nold-fashioned and careless approach. It is undeniable that\nwhenever a student is being examined, the teacher's perfor-\nmance indirectly comes to light. Therefore, quality student\noutcomes reflect the competence of the teacher. This means\nthat, while motivation, be it emotional or in the form of fund-\ning, facilitates good outcomes, the teacher's expertise in\nsupervising and guiding is also very important. A teacher's\npoor performance is not difficult to tell (T. E. Robinson &\npoor teacher tells but the good teacher clarifies or elucidates.\nThe one who is superior to these two teachers goes further to\npracticalize the teaching by demonstrating. Yet, the greatest\nteacher inspires (Ward, 2001). From the Islamic viewpoint,\nthe teacher who inspires is a moral educator and a standard\nbearer or role model for the students. The assumption is that\nthe teacher who inspires is not only disposed to teach by first\ninforming, clarifying the information, and going further to\npracticalize it by demonstrating, but he also prepares well to\ninstruct (T. E. Robinson & Hope, 2013) and sets the standard\nfor the students' behavior in its entirety.\nIn spite of the above, the issue of increasing awareness\nabout teachers' responsibilities in creating favorable\nconditions in the classroom has conventionally not attracted\nmuch attention in a myriad of teacher training programs.\nMuch interest is shown in workers' funding and motivation\nthe field of teaching (Frase & Sorenson, 1992; Sargent &\nHannum, 2005). Yet, for several years, students' motivation\nin the learning environment has continued to pose a chal-\nlenge for all teachers, both the experienced and the less expe-\nrienced (Malouff et al., 2008). To properly engage the minds\nof students, teachers have to redefine their pedagogy to\ninclude learning theories that encourage originality in think-\ning and allow students to have their own understanding of\nthe world through personal experiences and deep reflections\non those experiences (Runesson, 2015). Students learn\nthrough their interaction with their teachers both in and out-\nside the classroom, especially in the early stages of learning.\nNonetheless, to achieve fruitful outcomes, all the examined\nrequirements must be satisfied so that learning could be\nall-inclusive.\nConclusion\nThis article examined the students' learning requirements\ndetailed in al-Zarnj's best-seller, Ta`lm al-Muta`allim. The\nbook expounds the principles for achieving quality education\nand could be useful for improving the performance of both\nstudents and teachers today. These principles address impor-\ntant practical shortfalls in the present implementation of edu-\ncational policies. The book details the requirements for\nbringing about well-informed personalities whose knowl-\nedge will be relevant for the transformation of the society\nand the maintenance of moral values. In attempting to appre-\nciate these requirements, although the research is basically\nlibrary-based, it addresses several issues that affect students\nand, to a large extent, teachers, in the teaching and learning\nprocess. Al-Zarnj identifies six principal requirements that\ncould promote quality learning among students and, to some\nextent, quality teaching among teachers. These include intel-\nligence and high learning ability; high motivation for learn-\ning; patience, emotional stability, and commitment to the\nlearning process; availability of financial support; availabil-\nity of inspiring teachers; and disposition to quality time man-\nagement in the learning process. It is found that these\nrequirements are still relevant to the contemporary situa-\ntions. It also came to light that much of what the student\ngrasps comes from his engagement with his teacher through\nlistening and observation both in and outside the classroom.\nTherefore, it is undeniable that high cognitive or intellectual\nability is an important requirement for learning at all levels.\nNonetheless, it is argued that the quality of learning, whether\nin the classroom or outside it, does not always depend on the\nstudent's cognitive ability alone. Rather, it is also determined\nby a multiple of motivational factors (Kubanyiova, 2006)\nsuch us the desire for learning and funding. In addition,\nfavorable conditions within the classroom environment (e.g.,\na good relationship between the student and the teacher) are\nmajor motivations for students (Pintrich, Marx, & Boyle,\n1993). These also have an impact on the learning outcomes\n(Kubanyiova, 2006). Furthermore, teachers play a vital role\nin creating the above favorable conditions and the motivat-\ning learning environment because they are expected to adopt\nnumerous positive measures (Brophy, 2004; D_\nto inspire through demonstrative teaching.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAdair, J.
