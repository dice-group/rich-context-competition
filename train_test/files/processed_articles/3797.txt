    "abstract": "Abstract\nIndividuals with disabilities often report difficulty interacting with health care professionals. Addressing this challenge requires\ngreater understanding of factors that exacerbate the odds of negative interactions between health care providers and patients\nwith disabilities. Drawing on the qualitative research describing the features of such incidents, we use logistic regression to\nexplore two dimensions of this dynamic: negative experiences with health care providers (e.g., doctors, specialists) and\nnegative experiences with health insurance carriers (e.g., for profit or non-profit health insurance organizations). Using a\nnon-probability sample of American families who have a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we find that negative\nexperiences with health care providers are associated with the family's income level, as well as changes in parental labor\nforce participation. The odds of a negative interaction with the insurance carrier are intensified when the family experiences\nfinancial difficulties and when they have a negative experience with the health care provider. Finally, families who are aware\nof laws and policies regarding ASD also report increased odds of negative experiences with their insurance carrier but not\ntheir health care provider. Policy implications of our findings are discussed.\n",

This situation has changed (Lantos,\n2007). Although a vigorous debate continues as to whether\nor not the prevalence of ASD has genuinely risen, the rate at\nwhich children are diagnosed with ASD has grown substan-\ntially in the last 20 years (Saracino, Noseworthy, Steiman,\nReisinger, & Fombonne, 2010). Whereas ASD was once\npost-millennial world, ASD occurs in somewhere between 1\n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014). Having\na health care practice not including a patient with ASD is\nbecoming increasingly unusual.\nEven so, health care infrastructures incompletely include\nindividuals with ASD. Many individuals with disabilities,\nincluding those with neurological differences, report unusual\ndifficulty accessing services (e.g., Chiri & Warfield, 2012;\nWarfield & Gulley, 2006) and interacting with health care\nof these difficulties arose from a history of expansive social\ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities including\noften unnecessary institutionalization. Disability activists\nhave at times attributed social exclusion of individuals with\ndisabilities to the \"medical model\" of disability (Shakespeare,\n2008). This characterization is connected to both historical\nand ongoing experiences of individuals with disabilities in\ntheir interactions with members of the medical community.\n1Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology, Washington State\nUniversity Vancouver, USA\n2School of Politics, Philosophy, and Public Affairs, Washington State\nUniversity Vancouver, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLaurie A.

Use of the phrase \"medical model\" as\na derogatory term can create both the impression and actual\nexistence of hostility toward all health care providers.\nRegardless of the motivation for alienation, creating more\neffective health care policy and practice for persons with\nASD requires a better understanding of factors increasing the\nlikelihood of a negative interaction between those working\nin the health care system and individuals with disabilities.\nThis article explores the factors affecting the negative expe-\nriences of families with children who have ASD, their health\ncare providers, and their health care insurers.\nWe focus on health care providers and health care insurers\nseparately because many parents are seeking services for\ntheir child with ASD in a private health care market, where\nthey are tasked with working with their child's physician or\nother direct-service providers to obtain services that will\nassist the child as well as interacting with the insurance car-\nrier to ensure that the services recommended by the pediatri-\ncian will be covered by the family's health plan. As such, we\ndefine \"health care providers\" as medically trained personnel\nwho provide direct-service medical care to patients with\nASD (e.g., doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, etc.).\nThese providers are distinct from the individuals working in\nhealth insurance companies, who disburse funds to said\npatients (and their families) to cover the costs of these ser-\nvices (hereafter referred to as \"health insurance carriers\").\nThe intensity of parents' experiences with these policy\nsubsystems may result in conflict or other challenging inter-\nactions as they negotiate caring for a child with ASD. While\nseveral analyses have carefully studied how parents of chil-\ndren with ASD are treated by individuals working in the\nRyan & Cole, 2008) and how they engage treatment options\noffered by their health care providers (Valentine, 2010), the\nrole of a critical player in care for persons with ASD--the\nhealth insurance carrier--is largely absent from scholarly\nstudy of parent care for children with ASD. This distinction\nis not a minor one. In private health care settings, providers\nmay advocate parents to pursue oneASD treatment approach\nfor which their health care insurer refuses to provide finan-\ncial coverage. As such, we investigate whether the factors\nassociated with a negative health care experience among\nfamilies caring for a child with ASD are unique to each\nentity. In our study, we answer three primary research\nquestions:\nResearch Question 1: What, if any, are the correlates of\nnegative experiences between caregivers of a child with\nASD and their health care providers?\nResearch Question 2: What, if any, are the correlates of\nnegative experiences between caregivers of a child with\nASD and their health insurance carriers?\nResearch Question 3: Do they overlap? These analyses\nwill shed light on potential changes to practice and to\nhealth care policy, which could result in improved interac-\ntions between individuals with disabilities and health care\nsystems.\nBackground\nProviding Care for Individuals With ASD\nPatients with ASD can present unusual challenges for health\ncare providers (Gurney, McPheeters, & Davis, 2006; Meyers\n& Johnson, 2007). The highly variable nature of this neuro-\nlogical difference among individuals can challenge physi-\ncians'abilities to make an accurate diagnosis of the condition.\nIn addition, prognoses for children diagnosed with ASD are\nalso unreliable (Matson & Smith, 2008). In the past, the vast\nmajority of children diagnosed with ASD became adults\nwho, if not institutionalized, were almost certainly depen-\ndent on their families of origin and social welfare programs\nnatory social attitudes contributed heavily to these outcomes.\nWhile observed and expected improvement in overall out-\ncomes for children with ASD is desirable, managing such\nuncertainty can complicate relationships between health care\nproviders, health care insurers, and their families.\nFurthermore, scientific questions surrounding ASD have\nbecome increasingly politically divisive in recent decades\n(Murray, 2012). Partially owing to suspicion of a causal rela-\ntionship between childhood vaccines and ASD and increased\ndependence on the Internet for medical information, oppor-\ntunities for spread of mistrust between caregivers and health\nParikh, 2008). In addition, untested (or less than thoroughly\nproven) interventions forASD are increasingly prevalent and\npopular, creating an additional challenge for health care pro-\nviders to help patients and their family members evaluate the\npotential benefits of treatment options given scientific\nuncertainty.\nDisability and Health Care\nAside from these diagnostic challenges, the nature of profes-\nsional training in the health care field can also serve as a\nsource of strain for patients with ASD and their families\n& Salley, 2007). Health care education generally focuses on\ndeviance from norms. In other words, an important aspect of\nlearning to practice medicine is exposure to human atypicali-\nties (Shapiro, 2008). Both issue stakeholders and disability\nstudies scholars have expressed concern that this mode of\nmedical education, while certainly efficient and effective\nfrom the standpoint of student exposure to human variability,\noveremphasizes deficits even when conditions are not asso-\nciated with declining functionality (Baker, 2011; Leiter,\n2007). A result of this overemphasis on deficits can be the\nso-called medical model of disability wherein the essence of\nDrapela and Baker 3\nthe individual becomes defined exclusively in terms of their\nThis model of disability is unfavorably contrasted with\nthe social construction model employed in disability studies\nliterature. Scholars using the social model of disability frame\nthe challenges associated with it as predominantly resulting\nfrom discriminatory social infrastructures. Although real-\nworld proponents of the medical model are virtually absent\nfrom modern Western democracies (Shakespeare, 2008), dis-\nability scholars and activists continue to express concern that\nparticularly within the health care community there exists a\nsubconscious tendency to revert to such essentialist thinking\nThe Parent as Case Manager for a Child With\nASD\nChildren are increasingly diagnosed with ASD during early\nchildhood, rather than later in life (Hutton & Caron, 2005;\nRyan & Cole, 2008). During this stage of life, they are depen-\ndent upon parents for all of their care; this is particularly so\nParents find themselves as a critical source of support and\nadvocacy for the child's treatment, yet they may have little to\nno formal knowledge or education of the complexities inher-\nent in this neurological condition (Tomes, 2007; Valentine,\n2010). This lack of knowledge is very stressful for parents\nwho often feel disempowered by the health care systems they\nmust rely on to assist their child or children withASD (Hutton\nPrior research has shown that some of these parents report\nnegative health experiences, expressing feelings of shock\nand disbelief at their abrupt treatment by clinical staff\ntive experiences appear to be heightened by parents'difficul-\nties accessing services for their child (Hutton & Caron,\n2005). Some parents report feeling so upset and disempow-\nered that they become an activist for children with disabili-\nties (Ryan & Cole, 2008). Social activism is one way in\nwhich parents have empowered themselves as stakeholders\nin the care for their children with ASD, which has led to\nimprovedcare.Forexample,theDisabilityRightsMovement,\nwhich began in the United States during the 1970s, was a\nvery influential force in eliminating the practice of institu-\ntionalization of individuals withASD (Ward & Meyer, 1999).\nSocial activism was also responsible for integrating individ-\nuals with disabilities into the American public school system\n(Leiter, 2004a). Both these examples illustrate the power of\nsocial activism to change disability policy among publicly\nfunded institutions in the United States.\nParents--especially mothers--play a vital role in that\nactivism because they are often case managers of their child's\ncare for ASD (Baker & Drapela, 2010; Hutton & Caron,\n2003). Because the American health care system is largely\nprivatized, case management activities usually involve coor-\ndinating the child's needs with both the health care provider\nand the health insurance carrier. These two entities some-\ntimes have diverse interests in the management of patient\ncare, with the former being geared toward treatment and the\nlatter toward assessing coverage and rationing availability of\ntreatment services. As such, we consider them separately in\nour study of negative health experiences among families car-\ning for a child or children with ASD. To date, research in this\narea has been based on qualitative methods that explored\nparents' perceptions, coping, and activism responses around\ntheir child or children's ASD (Gray, 1993; Hutton & Caron,\n2010). In this study, we build upon that literature by examin-\ning quantitatively how individual family characteristics,\nexperiences with and awareness of services for children with\nASD, and parental labor force participation are associated\nwith the odds of negative experiences with health care pro-\nviders and health care insurers among families caring for\nchildren with ASD.\nWe explore four areas of family life that may be associ-\nated with negative experiences among parents caring for a\nchild with ASD, their health care providers, and/or their\nhealth insurance carriers: (a) household/family characteris-\ntics, (b) family awareness of laws and/or policies regarding\nASD, (c) the family's type of health care coverage, and (d)\nparental work issues. While the correlates of conflict with\nhealth care systems may be infinite, we focus our attentions\non these four areas because of their relevance to the ASD\nliterature.\nCorrelates of Negative Experiences: Family\nCharacteristics, Policy Awareness, Health Care,\nand Parental Work Indicators\nHousehold/family characteristics.Parents' accessing health\ncare services for their children can be complicated, particu-\nlarly if they are parenting more than one child with ASD\n(Kuhn & Carter, 2010) or balancing the needs of a child with\nASD with those of a neurotypical sibling or siblings (Chiri &\nstressful conditions in their lives, we would expect that the\ngreater the number of children in the family, the greater the\nodds of having a negative experience with the child's health\ncare provider and/or the family's health care insurer. Fami-\nlies who have more than one member affected by ASD may\nalso exhibit greater levels of conflict with health care provid-\ners and/or health care insurers, due to the stress of coordinat-\ning for multiple-affected individuals. In addition, families\nwho live in either outlying suburban areas or rural areas may\nencounter difficulty in commuting to treatment sites for their\nchild or children with ASD (Gray, 1994; Hutton & Caron,\n2005). These challenges could enhance the odds of having a\n4 SAGE Open\nnegative experience with either the doctor, if the physician(s)\nare not willing to have flexible schedules to accommodate\nthe rural families' additional commuting time; or the health\ncare insurer, due to insurer's unwillingness to pay for out-of-\nplan services that may be closer to the family's rural com-\nmunity. Finally, there is some evidence to suggest that\nindividuals in upper-income families are more likely to chal-\nlenge physicians during the course of office consultations\nevidence that they are more willing to file malpractice law-\nsuits than lower-income families (e.g., Mullis, 1995). As\nsuch, we expect household income to be positively associ-\nated with having a negative experience with health care pro-\nviders and/or health care insurers.\nAwareness of autism-related policies and programs.Policies\nand programs focusing on the interests of individuals with\ndisabilities and their families generally seek to create condi-\ntions that enhance their participation in society (Dalton,\nness of the kinds of services their child or children with ASD\nshould be receiving (Ryan & Cole, 2008). Furthermore, such\npolitical engagement contributes to a rights-based under-\nstanding of disability typically involving a sense of outrage\nwhen individuals with disability receive disparate treatment\n(Leiter, 2004a). Such consciousness-raising efforts may\nincrease the odds of parental conflict with a health care pro-\nvider and/or a health insurance carrier, if the health care\norganization does not offer services for ASD patients or\nrestricts health care services for children with ASD to only\nthe most severely affected.\nHealth care coverage. Parents can encounter difficulties when\naccessing health care services for their children with disabili-\nties (Warfield & Gulley, 2006). Parents of children with ASD\ntend to have higher rates of unmet health care needs than either\nthe general population of children in the United States (Strick-\nland, Jones, Ghandour, Kogan, & Newacheck, 2011) or fami-\nlies caring for children with other types of disabilities (Chiri &\nbamoorthi, & St. Peter, 2013). Families caring for a child (or\nchildren) with ASD also report lower rates of satisfaction with\ntheir pediatrician, relative to families caring for children with\nother types of disabilities (Liptak et al., 2006). Some families\nqualify for Medicaid, a publicly funded health care program,\nand still other families go without health care altogether\nbecause they have no access to the private market through\ntheir employer and do not qualify for publicly funded health\ncare (Chiri & Warfield, 2012). Because health care services in\nthe United States are frequently delivered to families through\nprivate or not-for-profit corporations, insurance carriers may\nrefuse services to a patient with ASD because it is believed to\nbe not cost-effective for the health care organization.\nCovered access to clinicians who can treat a child with\nASD often depends upon referral from the child's\npediatrician. A child's primary care physician may not be\nconvinced of the possibility of a neurological difference in\nthe patient, and therefore may fail, or even directly refuse to\nrefer them for assessments by specialists (Carbone et al.,\nto greater odds of a negative experience with a child's health\ncare provider for families carrying either type of health insur-\nance, families with Medicaid may be at a higher relative risk\nfor two reasons: (a) The demand for such services far exceeds\nthe capacity of the public health care system to aid all who\nneed it, and thus the doctor is a gatekeeper for access to pub-\nlicly funded services; and (b) obtaining services on the pri-\nvate market is not usually an option for families on Medicaid\n(e.g., Ghandour, Hirai, Blumberg, Strickland, & Kogan,\n2014). Thus, the odds of having a negative health experience\nwith the child's health care provider(s) are expected to be\ngreater for families with Medicaid.\nParental work issues. Finally, we considered whether parents\nmade changes to their work lives, due to a child (or chil-\ndren's) ASD (e.g., Baker & Drapela, 2010; Gordon, Rosen-\nchange affects their chances of having negative experiences\nwith their child's doctor and/or the family's health insurance\ncarrier. These changes in family work may indirectly affect\nhealth care experiences among families caring for children\nwith ASD if financial burdens result from a parent's changed\n(or reduced) work schedules.\nThese four areas of family life form the bases of our\nexploratory analyses that will answer the aforementioned\nresearch questions.\nMethod\nData for this analysis were collected using a survey titled\n\"Autism, Health Care, and Public Policy: Experiences of\nFamilies with Health Care Systems.\" We used a cross-sec-\ntional study design and disseminated our survey in\nWashington and Oregon between the months of October\n\"Participation and Activities Limitation Survey\" created by\nStatistics Canada (Statistics Canada, 2006). Versions of the\nsurvey have previously been used to examine the experi-\nences of families with children with ASD in Missouri and\nBaker, 2007). The survey consists of 58 questions posed in a\nvariety of forms, including close-ended, multiple choice,\nLikert-type scale, and open-ended questions that address\nseven areas: demographics and socioeconomic characteris-\ntics; family history with ASD; education, treatment, and\ninterventions; ASD awareness and information; experiences\nwith health care providers; access to health care; and general\nimpressions of the health care system. The survey is designed\nto take approximately 45 min to complete.\nDrapela and Baker 5\nPrevalence figures for ASD have varied considerably\nover the years, with Centers for Disease Control surveillance\nstudies estimating its expression anywhere from 1 child per\n150 children aged 8 or below (Centers for Disease Control\nchildren (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014).\nWhile the factors associated with the increasing prevalence\nare a combination of increased ASD awareness and broad-\nened diagnostic criteria (see Saracino et al., 2010), even the\nhighest prevalence rate above would be cost-prohibitive for\nusing probability sampling methods (e.g., to obtain a sample\nfamilies).\nImportantly, we chose a convenience sampling strategy\nbecause it allowed us direct access to families caring for\nchildren with ASD. Even if we had the funds for a large-\nscale probability sample, we were still not assured of find-\ning enough families caring for a child with ASD who were\nwilling to answer our survey questions about their negative\nexperiences with providers and insurers. For example, fami-\nlies caring for children with special needs who are receiving\nservices through a \"medical home\" arrangement--where\nthe health care provider coordinates general and specialty\nmedical care and ensures that services are delivered on a\nroutine basis--may not have negative experiences with\neither the provider or the insurer, but may have ended up in\na large-scale probability sample (e.g., Strickland et al.,\n2011). Using a convenience sampling strategy allows us the\nmost cost-efficient way to find a sample that has recent\nexperience with the kinds of health care experiences that are\nthe focus of study.\nLocal leaders in the area of ASD were identified using a\ncomprehensive list of allASD-oriented groups in Washington\nand Oregon, and through reviewing articles in the local press\nand records of appearances at local stakeholders meetings.\nLeaders in these organizations publicized the study by post-\ning advertising flyers around their offices and announcing\nthe study at their regular meetings. They also publicized an\nInternet link that potential respondents could use to read\nabout the study and answer the survey. No additional efforts\nwere undertaken by the researchers to recruit members of\nunderrepresented groups.\nAll respondents completed the survey online (although\npaper copies were available, no one elected to complete\npaper copies). Caregivers were asked to provide their\ninformed consent to participate, and instructions indicated\nthat they could refuse to answer any question without pen-\nalty. Respondents were allowed to complete the survey only\nonce, though they were allowed multiple visits to the site to\ncomplete the instrument. Respondents with more than one\nchild with ASD were asked to complete the survey from the\nperspective of their experiences with their child who was\nfirst diagnosed with ASD (as opposed to the oldest child with\nASD since often an older sibling is diagnosed later than a\nyounger one if the younger child exhibits more behaviors\nassociated with ASD). The website recorded 563 visits,\ncomplete data for the variables used in the study. As such, we\nare using 66% of the completed forms in our analyses.2\nVariables\nDependent variables. Survey respondents were asked whether\nor not they, or their child, had ever had a negative experience\nwith the child's health care provider, operationally defined\nas a doctor, nurse, occupational therapist, or other direct-\nservice care provider. Survey respondents were also asked\nwhether they had a negative experience with their health\ninsurance carrier, which we have operationalized as the guar-\nantor of the child's health care services. Both questions spe-\ncifically asked the respondent to consider these negative\nexperiences as a result of their child or children's ASD. Both\nitems on the survey had dichotomous response categories,\nrequiring the respondent to answer \"yes\" or \"no.\"\nPredictor variables. As previously mentioned, negative health\nexperiences may be associated with both personal and house-\nhold/family characteristics of parents caring for a child or\nchildren with ASD. Four categories of factors related to\ninteractions with health care providers and insurers identi-\nfied in the literature were included in the study: household/\nfamily characteristics, the respondent's awareness of policies\nand services for ASD, health care coverage (access to health\ncare insurance), and parental work issues associated with\nIn terms of family characteristics, we asked respondents\nto list the number of children who were currently living in\nthe home with them, whether or not they lived in a rural area\n(1 = yes, 0 = otherwise), whether their child with ASD was\nmale or female (1 = male), and whether there were other per-\nsons in the family with ASD (1 = no one, 0 = otherwise). We\nmeasured total family income for 2005 ordinally, with the\nUS$160,000. Thus, a one-unit increase for this variable will\nrepresent a potentially substantial increase in annual house-\nWe measured two dimensions of policy awareness:\nwhether the respondent currently felt that the family had an\nunmet need for ASD services (1 = yes, 0 = otherwise) and\nwhether they were aware of public policies and laws related\nto ASD. We originally scaled this variable in an ordinal fash-\nion (1 = no awareness to 4 = total awareness), but it was so\nhighly skewed that we dichotomized it, collapsing the \"very\naware, aware, somewhat aware\" categories into \"awareness\"\nand 0 = all else.\nAccess to medical care was measured in two ways:\nwhether or not the family paid for their child (or children's)\nmedical care with Medicaid or whether they used private\n6 SAGE Open\ninsurance. We did not ask our respondents whether they\nused both types of insurance; our measure represents the\npredominant method of payment for health care used by\nthe family. We asked our respondents whether they used\ntheir own personal funds to provide services for their child\n(or children) with ASD, but due to a high level of missing\ndata for this question, we dropped this measure from our\nanalyses. To be consistent with the literature on health care\nand ASD, we used a dichotomous measure for medical\ncare through publicly funded insurance (Medicaid: 1 = yes,\n0 = all other). The reference category for these individuals\nare those using private insurance; thus, we can still mea-\nsure the effects of private and public insurance on conflicts\nwith health care providers and health insurance\ncompanies.\nWe asked families about any changes they had taken in\ntheir work lives, due to their child (or children's) ASD.\nSpecifically, we asked respondents whether they had experi-\nenced financial problems during the past year, due to their\nchild's ASD (1 = yes, 0 = no, not sure); whether they had not\ntaken a job, due to their child's ASD (1 = yes, 0 = no);\nwhether they had not taken a promotion, due to their child's\nASD (1 = yes, 0 = no); and whether they had chosen to work\nfewer hours, due to their child's ASD (1 = yes, 0 = no). These\nquestions are consistent with the types of indicators used to\nmeasure the financial burdens associated with providing\nhealth care to a child (or children) withASD, per the National\nSurvey of Children With Special Health Care Needs\n(NS-CSHCN; for example, Ghandour et al., 2014; Kogan et\nAnalytical Approach\nLogistic regression was employed to model the odds of fami-\nlies having a negative experience with either their health care\nprovider or their health insurance carrier. In logistic regres-\nsion, the primary analytical goal is to predict the odds of a\ndichotomous outcome, controlling for a set of conditions\n(covariates). Logistic regression allows for modeling of how\nfactors are either positively or negatively related to the odds\nof a negative health experience attributed by the parent or\nprimary caregiver to the child's ASD, while controlling for\nother covariates. Effect sizes are expressed in odds ratios\n(ORs), or the ratio of the odds of a negative experience of\none level of a covariate to the odds of a negative experience\nof another level of the covariate. The predictor variables\nwere entered into our logistic regression models in thematic\ngroups. Household characteristics were the first set of vari-\nables, followed by policies and services for ASD, then\nMedicaid use, and parent work variables. Our use of collin-\nearity diagnostics did not indicate the presence of multi-col-\nlinearity among our independent variables. Results are\ndiscussed in terms of their odds on the respondents'reporting\nnegative experiences with the child's doctor and/or the fam-\nily's insurance carrier.\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics\nAs shown in Table 1, more than half of our sample reported\nhaving a negative experience during the past year with their\nchild's health care provider, due to the child's ASD (58%),\nand more than two thirds of respondents had a negative expe-\nrience with their health insurance carrier, due to the child's\nThese differing percentages are consistent with our argu-\nment that families who are caring for a child (or children)\nwith ASD make conceptual distinctions between their\nchild's health care provider and their health insurance car-\nrier. Moreover, a greater proportion of the families in the\nsample had a negative health care experience with their\ninsurer, relative to their direct-service health care provider\n(i.e., doctor).\nNineteen percent (19%) of the families in our sample\nreport living in a rural area, a proportion that is very similar\nBureau, 2010a). The average number of children among\nhouseholds in our sample is 1.82 (Table 1), a number slightly\nless than the national average of 1.88 for the closest census\npercent (82%) of respondents self-report that their answers to\nour survey questions were specifically about their sons. The\nmale preponderance of ASD-affected individuals in this\nsample is consistent with the gender prevalence of this neu-\nrological difference in general population surveillance stud-\nies (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012).\nAlmost two thirds of the respondents in our survey indicated\nthat they did not have anyone else in the family with ASD\n(Table 1), a percentage that is slightly lower than a multi-\nstate study of children with special health care needs asking\nThe sample's average annual household income value was\ncategory of our four income groups). This broad range\nencompasses household incomes that are higher than the\nmedian household income for the United States in 2006--\nThe majority of our respondents described themselves as\nwell aware of the policies and services for ASD (86%), and\n75% of them stated that they had an unmet service need\nrelated to ASD (Table 1). These percentages are a bit higher\nthan the percentages derived from multi-state surveys of par-\nents who have children with special health care needs. Unmet\nneeds in these studies range from 4% (Chiri & Warfield,\nson for these discrepancies entails the recruitment strategy\nfor our study. We used a convenience sampling strategy\nwhere we contacted local leaders in the ASD outreach and\nadvocacy community in Washington and Oregon who publi-\ncized our study to persons who were caring for a child with\nautism. This strategy may be one reason why the prevalence\nDrapela and Baker 7\nof unmet health care needs for a child with ASD is higher in\nour sample than in studies of health care needs for children\nwith disabilities using larger samples collected with proba-\nbility sampling designs.\nTwenty-seven percent (27%) of the families in our sample\nare using Medicaid exclusively for their health insurance car-\nrier, a proportion that is slightly higher than the national rate\nof 21% (Table 1; Kaiser Family Foundation, n.d.). Given that\nfamilies in our sample who are carrying private insurance\nserve as the reference category for insurance type, there will\nbe ample opportunities for us to explore whether the odds of\na negative experience with the health care provider versus\nthe health care insurer will be distinct for those using\nMedicaid, versus those using private insurance.\nParental work issues affected several of the families in\nour sample (Table 1). Fifty-eight percent (58%) of respon-\ndents indicated that they had not taken a job, due to their\nchild's ASD; 57% noted that they had encountered finan-\ncial problems, due to their child's ASD; and 53% of fami-\nlies reported that someone in the family had worked fewer\nhours, due to their child's ASD. Around one quarter of the\nsample (23%) had not taken a promotion, due to the child's\nASD, and another 19% had changed jobs for the same rea-\nround of the NS-CSHCN showed that 57% of a multi-state\nsample of families with children with ASD reduced or\nstopped working, due to the child's condition. Financial\nproblems were experienced by 40% of this sample (Kogan\nRecall from our earlier discussion that we will explore\nthese correlates of conflict between families and the health\ncare system separately for health care providers and health\ncare insurance companies. We focus on these entities sepa-\nrately because many parents are seeking services for their\nchild with ASD in a private health care market, where they\nare tasked with working with their child's pediatrician to\nobtain services that will assist the child, as well as interacting\nwith the insurance carrier to ensure that the services recom-\nmended by the pediatrician will be covered by the family's\nhealth plan.\nNegative Experiences With the Child's Health\nCare Provider\nWe used logistic regression to estimate the odds of having a\nnegative experience with the child's health care provider on\nthe 13 covariates (Table 2). In all, 4 of the 13 predictor vari-\nables significantly affected the odds of a family having a\nnegative experience with the child's doctor, due to the child's\nASD: rural residence, household income, not taking a job\ndue to the child's ASD, and not taking a promotion due to the\nchild's ASD. These four variables have positive coefficients,\nmeaning that they significantly increased the odds of having\nconflict with a health care provider.\nTable 1.

A one-unit increase in the family's\nincome level (i.e., moving to the next group in our grouped\nincome variable) increases the odds of having a negative\nexperience with the child's doctor by more than 70%, all\nOur finding that persons from higher-income households\nhad significantly greater odds of having a negative health\ncare experience is consistent with our hypothesis that upper-\nlevel income individuals would be more likely to challenge\ndoctors than lower-income individuals (e.g., Haug & Lavin,\nParental work issues also affected the odds of conflict with\na child's health care provider. If a parent did not take a job,\ndue to the child's ASD, the odds of conflict with a health care\nprovider doubles (Table 2; OR = 2.13, p < .05), all else being\nequal. If a parent did not take a promotion, due to the child's\nASD, the odds of conflict more than doubled (Table 2; OR =\n2.43, p < .05). These items are consistent with an interpreta-\ntion of family financial strains created by ASD; however,\nthree other variables that also measured financial strains were\nnot statistically significant (e.g., financial problems, parent\nchanged jobs, and parent worked fewer hours--all due to\nchild's ASD). Rather, it may be the case that these two ques-\ntions are measuring some dimension of parent frustration at\nbeing either unemployed or underemployed, and it is having\nimpact on the interactions with the child's health care pro-\nvider (although we do not have those measures in our data).\nThe coefficients for families' levels of awareness of laws\nand policies regarding ASD and the families' unmet needs\nfor ASD were both positive, meaning that they increased the\nodds of having a negative health experience with their chil-\ndren's health care provider. These findings were consistent\nwith our earlier-stated predictions; however, these coeffi-\ncients were not statistically significant. These two results--\nthe latter in particular--were somewhat surprising, given\nthat families with children who have ASD experience high\nlevels of unmet needs for health care (Chiri & Warfield,\non Medicaid had a higher odds of a negative health experi-\nence with the child's provider (OR = 1.40), but this coeffi-\ncient failed to reach statistical significance as well. Despite\nthese non-significant predictor variables, the model in Table\n2 explains 18% of the variance in the odds of having a nega-\ntive health care experience with the child's health care pro-\nNegative Experiences With the Child's Health\nInsurance Carrier\nWe also used logistic regression to estimate the odds of hav-\ning a negative experience with the child's health insurance\ncarrier on the 13 covariates (Table 3). Only 3 of the 13 pre-\ndictor variables significantly affected the odds of having a\nnegative experience with the family's health insurance car-\nrier: being aware of laws and policies regarding ASD; expe-\nriencing financial problems, due to the child's ASD; and\nhaving a negative experience with the child's health care pro-\nvider (also due to the child's ASD).\nIf a respondent self-reported that he or she had an aware-\nness of laws and policies regarding ASD, his or her odds of\nexperiencing a negative experience with the health care\nTable 2. Factors Affecting Parent's Negative Experiences With a Child's Health Care Provider, Due to the Child's ASD (N = 215).\nNote. ASD = autism spectrum disorder; OR = odds ratio.\nDrapela and Baker 9\ninsurer was almost three and one half times greater than\npersons who did not report such an awareness, all other fac-\nawareness was associated with increased tensions between\nthe respondents and their insurance carriers, net of the type\nof insurance the families were using at the time they com-\npleted the survey. (Recall that \"Medicare\" is dichotomized\nto include persons with all other types of insurance as the\nreference category--thus, families who are carrying insur-\nance of any kind are represented in the regression equa-\ntion.) As previously mentioned, financial problems were\nalso a factor that significantly increased odds of a negative\nexperience with the child's health care insurer (Table 3).\nFamilies reporting that they had encountered financial\nproblems due to their child's ASD had four times higher\nodds of a negative experience with their health insurance\ncarrier than those families who did not have financial prob-\nlems, all else being equal (OR = 4.19, p < .001). These find-\nings are consistent with the expectation that parents'\ndifficulty gaining access to services for their child with\nASD would negatively affect their relationship with the\nchild's insurance carrier. Finally, families who indicated\nthat they had had a negative experience in the past year\nwith the child's health care provider doubled their odds of\nhaving a negative experience with their health care insurer,\nrelative to those families who did not have a negative expe-\nnearly one third of the variance in the dependent variable\nWhile these results are consistent with some of the expec-\ntations we articulated earlier in this study, there were some\npredictor variables that did not significantly affect the odds\nof our respondents' reporting a negative experience with\ntheir health care insurer. Household income did not signifi-\ncantly affect having a negative health care experience with\nthe carrier, which was a bit surprising, as prior research has\ndocumented that upper-income individuals are more likely to\nchallenge decision-making in medical organizations (e.g.,\nfor ASD services did not reach statistical significance\n(although the coefficient was in the expected direction),\nwhich was also of note, due to the fact that unmet need for\nservices is a challenge faced by families who are caring for a\nchild (or children) with ASD (Chiri & Warfield, 2012;\nStrickland et al., 2011). Our findings suggest that unmet need\nis not a critical factor in having a negative experience with\nthe health insurer--rather, it is the knowledge of policies and\nlaws regarding ASD that is a driving factor in families'\nchances of reporting a negative experience with their health\ninsurance organization.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we investigated three research questions:\nResearch Question 1: What, if any, are the correlates of\nnegative experiences between caregivers of a child with\nASD and their health care providers?\nResearch Question 2: What, if any, are the correlates of\nnegative experiences between caregivers of a child with\nASD and their health insurance companies?\nResearch Question 3: Do they overlap?\nTable 3. Factors Affecting Parent's Negative Experiences With the Health Insurance Carrier, Due to the Child's ASD (N = 215).\nNote. ASD = autism spectrum disorder; OR = odds ratio.\nThe results of our research answer the third question most\nclearly: Distinct factors significantly affect the odds of hav-\ning a negative experience with the health care provider ver-\nsus the odds of having a negative experience with the health\ncare insurer. Thus, one conclusion of our study is that fami-\nlies who are caring for their child (or children) with ASD\nmake conceptual distinctions between the two entities when\nthey are identifying challenges associated with providing\nservices for them.\nThis finding is a significant contribution to the ASD lit-\nerature. Many studies of negative health experiences among\nthese families focus either on parents' interactions with\ndirect-service health care providers, such as doctors and\nlenges to receive services for their affected children by using\nmedical surveillance approaches to document their unmet\nthat both the direct-service health care providers and the fis-\ncal guarantor of health care services (health care insurers)\nfigure into negative experiences among families caring for a\nchild (or children) with ASD, but in different ways.\nFactors that increased the odds of the family having a\nnegative health care experience with the child's doctor, due\nto the child's ASD, were rural residence, household income,\nthe respondent's not taking a job due to factors attributed to\nthe child's ASD, and whether a family member had not\ntaken a promotion as a result of having a child with ASD.\nRespondents living in rural residences expressed increased\nodds of a negative experience with their health care pro-\nvider. While we did not ask our respondents to report how\nmany miles they must drive to access services for their child\nwith ASD, patients in rural areas consistently report driving\ndistance as a barrier to accessing regular medical care visits\n(Arcury et al., 2005). As such, our finding is consistent with\nconflict that may arise between a health care provider and a\nrural family who may have difficulty keeping weekly\nappointments for ASD services such as occupational ther-\napy, applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapy, and other\ninterventions.\nHousehold income also significantly increased the odds\nthat a family would have a negative experience with the\nhealth care provider, with higher-income households having\ngreater odds of a negative experience than lower-income\nhouseholds. This was the case, even after controlling for any\nfinancial difficulties the family may have experienced, due\nto the child's ASD. It is entirely possible that the negative\nexperience reported by higher socioeconomic households is\nconsistent with other research studies finding a link between\nhigher-income individuals and questioning a physician's\nthat persons who have higher incomes are more likely than\nlower-income persons to raise questions with a doctor about\ntheir medical advice and request greater discussions\nof medical issues with their doctor. While their effects are\nindirect, through increased health knowledge, our income\nvariable has a direct effect on negative interactions with the\nprovider. Similarly, Mullis' (1995) research indicates that\nhigher-income persons have a greater propensity to file mal-\npractice lawsuits than lower-income persons. While we did\nnot measure these types of dynamics with health care provid-\ners, our finding is consistent with an interpretation of higher-\nincome households potentially being more willing to\narticulate their negative experiences with a health care pro-\nvider, relative to lower-income households.\nFamilies who altered their work habits due to their child's\nASD also experienced increased odds of a negative experi-\nence with the health care provider, relative to families who\ndid not make these choices. Specifically, persons who either\ndid not take a job or who did not take a promotion, ostensibly\nto accommodate the needs of their child or children with\nASD, doubled their odds of a negative experience with the\nchild's health care provider. While these variables are consis-\ntent with an interpretation of the financial impact of caring\nfor a child with ASD, they remained statistically significant\neven after household income was held constant in our regres-\nsion models. It is entirely possible that their link to a negative\nexperience with a child's health care provider may be due to\ntheir frustration or sense of loss regarding their altered career\nmay also be the case that the parent with the altered career\ntrajectory has gained both practical and medical knowledge\nabout ASD, thus increasing their willingness to question\nmedical authorities about their child's care (Gray, 1994;\nRyan & Cole, 2008). We do not have the necessary measures\nto isolate these intervening effects; thus, we leave them for\nfuture research.\nFactors that increased the odds of having a negative expe-\nrience with the health care insurer were the respondent's\nawareness of laws and policies regarding ASD, experiencing\nfinancial problems, due to the child's ASD, and having a\nnegative experience with the child's doctor in the past year.\nFamilies who reported having financial problems in the past\nyear due to their child's ASD had a fourfold increase in the\nodds of a negative experience with their health care insurer,\nrelative to families who did not experience money problems.\nThis finding was in the expected direction and consistent\nwith the literature on the financial hardships of caring for a\nThe fact that this variable significantly affected the odds of a\nnegative experience with the health insurance carrier but did\nnot affect the odds of a negative experience with the health\ncare provider suggests that families are aware of which of\nthese two entities makes the fiscal decision about access to\nhealth care resources for ASD. Families who had a negative\nexperience with their child's health care provider also had\ndouble the odds of having a negative experience with their\nhealth insurance carrier, relative to families who did not have\na negative experience. Thus, altered work habits, rural\nDrapela and Baker 11\nresidence, and household income have indirect effects on\nnegative experiences with health insurance carriers, via their\ndirect effects on negative experiences with health care\nproviders.\nRespondents who said they were aware of laws and poli-\ncies for ASD had triple the odds of having a negative health\nexperience with their health insurance carrier, relative to\nthose who did not have such awareness, a finding consistent\nwith the notion that when individuals educate themselves\nabout options that are available to them, they are more likely\nto critically evaluate their current situation than if they were\nnot aware of such options (e.g., Todd & Jones, 2003).\nBecause parents of children with ASD often find themselves\nin the position of being both caregiver and case manager for\nthe services their child needs, they act as an intermediary\namong pediatricians, specialists, and health insurance carri-\ners. Such pervasive engagement in social infrastructures may\nlead to politicization of stakeholders, producing a potentially\nquite positive effect for society at large--vibrantly engaged\ndiscourse in a democratic context. However, as this study\nsuggests, it might also be associated with increased potential\nfor negative experiences with social infrastructures upon\nwhich the stakeholder depends.\nThe study is not without its limitations. Foremost among\nthem is our use of a non-probability sampling design. While\nthis approach gave us an opportunity to model relationships\namong a much larger sample of families than had been done\nhave limited generalizability due to our convenience sam-\npling strategy. Second, because our data are cross-sectional\nrather than longitudinal, we can only interpret the relation-\nships among our variables as associations. We cannot iden-\ntify the causal mechanisms affecting negative experiences\nbetween caregivers of a child with autism, their health care\nproviders, and their health care insurers. Thus, while we\nwere able to identify distinct direct effects of our predictor\nvariables on the odds of negative experiences with health\ncare providers and health care insurers, we did not have the\nmeasures to investigate the intervening mechanisms that\nmight explain these direct effects. Future studies on families'\nnegative experiences with health care insurers should use\nlongitudinal data to more closely investigate the link between\ntheir awareness of laws and policies for ASD, their level of\nengagement in activism, and conflict between the insurers\nand the insured, for example. Finally, the results of our study\nmay have varied among members of different racial and eth-\nnic groups, as access to health care in general varies signifi-\ncantly by race and social class (Arcury et al., 2005). We were\nnot able to assess these effects due to very limited data on the\nrace and ethnicity of our respondents.\nDespite these caveats, our study underscores the need for\nresearchers in ASD policy to consider ground-level health\npractitioners as distinct conceptual entities from health care\nbureaucracies. This is critically important for scholars whose\nresearch populations are located in countries with a robust\nprivate market for health care services, as is the case in the\nUnited States. This is also an important distinction in the\nstudy of health care in the United States, as the country enters\ninto a period of transition during the implementation of the\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-\nIn seeking services for a child with ASD, many parents\nlearn about their child's disability and learn to work with the\ndiagnosis (Valentine, 2010). In doing so, they work to\nbecome aware of the resources inside and outside what is\nbeing offered to them that can help their child. Such an\nawareness is gained through parents' educating themselves\nabout the ASD diagnosis and understanding what services\nmay best fit with the child's presenting behaviors. This\nknowledge is usually obtained through a combination of\ninformation from the health care provider, Internet research,\nand books on ASD and its related conditions: for example,\nKranowitz & Miller's (2005) The Out-of-Sync Child,\nYes--Hopeless, No.\nIn addition, parents may also embark upon learning how to\nnegotiate their health care plan to maximize the services for\nwhich the child is eligible, or get the health care provider to\npay for services once their out-of-pocket deductibles for ser-\nvices have been reached. Such tasks may contribute to par-\nents' greater awareness of the impact of health care policy on\nthe lives of citizens. However, as is described in Paul Offit's\nAutism's False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and\nthe Search for a Cure, not all awareness is created equal.\nIdeally, experts working with children who have ASD and the\nparents of those children come together to promote policy\ninterventions designed to improve their lives rather than being\nassociated with more negative interactions. The results of this\nresearch suggest that alleviating these families' negative\nexperiences will have distinct paths for the health care pro-\nvider versus the health insurance carrier. Perhaps building\npositive interactions will have distinct paths as well.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1.
