Few\nstudies have examined this issue among married women\nfrom a social and contextual perspective. This study\ntargeted married women to examine factors associated\nwith unintended pregnancy using the ecological model of\nhealth promotion that focuses attention on both individual\nand social environmental factors. Data from the National\nSurvey of Family Growth (NSFG) were merged with\nNSFG contextual files to examine the major predictive\nfactors.\nResults Multilevel logistic regression modelling revealed\nthat married women of lower socioeconomic status,\nhigher parity, who lived in communities with a high rate of\nIntroduction\nReduction in the rate of unintended pregnancy in the USA\nis a national health priority. Progress in the reduction of\nunintended pregnancy has been difficult to achieve among\nwomen of childbearing ages. The Centers for Disease\npregnancies were not intended; by 2002 the percentage of\nunintended pregnancies slightly increased to 49%.1\nAlthough the rates remained stable, disparities have been\nnoted in terms of race, age, marital status and\nsocioeconomic status.2 The national Healthy People 2010\ntarget for the general population of women in the USA for\nintended pregnancies, set at 70%,3 will not be met.\nUnintended pregnancy is associated with significant\nand costly physical, psychological and socioeconomic risks\nto both mother and child.4,5 Children born as a result of an\nunintended pregnancy are more likely to be premature,\nhave a low birth weight, and are at increased risk for child\nabuse.2,6,7 Women who experience an unintended\npregnancy are more likely to have inadequate prenatal\ncare,7 a lower educational level, and live in poverty.2,8\nAlthough unintended pregnancy is higher among\nunmarried women, little attention has been paid to the\nsignificant and unique concerns that are experienced by\nmarried women. Among married women, approximately\nsurvey. Among married women, there has been little\nimprovement since 1995 when the unintended pregnancy\nrate was 28%.1 Explanations as to why married women\nhave not made significant progress in the reduction of\nunintended pregnancy are unclear.\nThe context of unintended pregnancy among married\nwomen in the USA\nAinat Koren, Barbara Mawn\nARTICLE\nSchool of Health and Environment, University of\nMassachusetts, Lowell, MA, USA\nAinat Koren, PhD, Assistant Professor\nBarbara Mawn, PhD, Nursing Program Director, Professor, and\nCo-Director of the Center for Health Promotion and Research,\nUniversity of Massachusetts\nCorrespondence to: Dr Ainat Koren, School of Health and\nEnvironment, University of Massachusetts Lowell, 3 Solomont\nE-mail: ainat_koren@uml.edu\nmarital dissolution had a higher probability of an\nunintended pregnancy.

    "reduced_content": "Keywords ecological model, family planning education,\nhealth promotion, married women, unintended pregnancy\nResearchers at the Emory Center on Health Outcomes\nand Quality9 reported that one-third of the unintended\npregnancies among the 1173 births examined in this study\noccurred among married, educated and commercially insured\nwomen. Only 40% of the women with unintended pregnancy\nreported using contraception at the time of the study.\nGoldsmith et al.10 also examined knowledge of emergency\ncontraception in a population-based sample of women in\nOregon. The majority (69.5%) of the sample included\nmarried women. They noted that lack of knowledge about\nemergency contraception was associated with unintended\npregnancy when controlled for marital status and age.\nTheoretical model\nWhile multiple factors have been studied in relation to\nunintended pregnancy, they have been examined in\nisolation and the knowledge base has been limited to teen\npregnancy, non-marital childbearing and other high-risk\npopulations. Limited research has been done among\nmarried women and unintended pregnancy. Also, studies\nhad observed pregnancy intendedness by looking at limited\nindependent variables and were not theory driven. Those\nthat were theory based focused on models of behaviour\nfocus and on one dimension of health promotion, such as\nknowledge, attitudes or skills. Few studies have used one\nof the ecological models to explain or predict unintended\npregnancy among married women. Moreover, limited\nresearch has been done to explore the influence of the\nenvironment on unintended pregnancies.\nKey message points\nG Unintended pregnancy is a complex construct\nassociated with individual disparities as well as other\nsocial and economic factors.\nG The ecological model of health promotion provides a\nholistic approach to unintended pregnancy but due to its\ncomplexity not all levels of the model were predictive of\nunintended pregnancy among married women.\nG Policies that support the inclusion of the spouse in\nfamily planning education need to be implemented in\norder to enhance the couple's ability to manage their\nreproductive health.\ngroup.bmj.com\nhttp://jfprhc.bmj.com/\nDownloaded from\nMcLeroy and associates11 developed an ecological\nmodel for health promotion that links health promotion\nstrategies that target individual behaviours and\nenvironmental influences. The ecological model consists of\nfive levels of analysis related to health behaviours and\npotential interventions.12 The intrapersonal level of the\necological model includes an individual's knowledge,\nattitudes, values, skills, behaviour, self-concept and beliefs.\nThe interpersonal level encompasses social networks, social\nsupports, families, peers and neighbours. The institutional\nlevel includes rules regulations and informal structures that\nmay influence behaviour. The community level is comprised\nof community resources, neighbourhood organisations, and\nsocial and health services. The public policy level constitutes\nrelevant legislation, policies and regulatory agencies.\nUnintended pregnancy in an ecological\nperspective: background\nIntrapersonal factors\nUnintended pregnancies occur among women of all\nsocioeconomic levels and all marital statuses and age\ngroups. Women under the age of 20 or older than 40 years,\nwho are poor, with less than high school education and of\nAfrican American race are especially likely to become\npregnant unintentionally however.2,4,5 Poverty is strongly\nrelated to greater difficulty in using reversible\ncontraceptive methods successfully; these women are also\nthe least likely to have the resources necessary to access\nfamily planning services and the most likely to be affected\nnegatively by an unintended pregnancy.3 Data from the\n2001 NSFG showed that low-income women had much\nhigher rates of unintended pregnancy than did wealthier\nwomen and that the disparity had increased since 1994.2\nThis disparity might reflect health insurance coverage\ndisparities where poor women are twice as likely to have\nno health insurance as compared to all women.13\nSeveral studies that have explored how religious\naffiliation affects contraceptive use revealed significant\ndifferences in contraceptive use styles among Catholics,\nProtestants, Jews and those of no religious affiliation.\nDifferences were hypothesised to be in relation to social\nnorms, differential sex roles, male\u00adfemale communication\npatterns, and the differential use of physician-based versus\nother sources of contraceptives.14,15 Other studies found\nlittle difference among Protestants, Catholics and Jews in\noverall contraceptive prevalence. However, Protestants\nrelied more heavily on tubal sterilisation than on other\nmethods, while Catholics were more likely to use the pill\nand Jews were more likely to use the diaphragm.16\nThe effect of childhood abuse and household\ndysfunction on women's sexual behaviour continues from\nadolescence to adulthood. Women who suffered frequent\npsychological or physical abuse were significantly more\nlikely to have an unintended first pregnancy than those\nwomen who did not.17\nInterpersonal factors\nNumerous studies support the notion that a woman's\npartner may have a major impact on her use or non-use of\ncontraceptive method. Miller18 showed that, among\nmarried women, dislike by the husband of a method being\nused was significantly associated with an increased\nincidence of subsequent non-use. Acceptability of the\nmother's pregnancy intention was highly associated with\nthe partner's attitude towards the pregnancy.9,19,20\nInstitutional factors\nProper use of contraceptive technologies for fertility\nregulation is linked to the availability of quality\ncontraceptive services providing a full range of safe,\napproved methods of contraception. The literature reported\nthe risk of unintended pregnancies to be associated with the\nfailure of contraceptive methods, non-use of contraceptive\nmethods, and lack of knowledge about contraceptive\noptions,21 suggesting limited access to family planning\ncounselling and the influence of the cost of\ncontraceptives.4\nCommunity factors\nA multilevel analysis of marital and non-marital fertility\nin the USA found that for married women the contextual\nfactors that affect the likelihood of a birth include the\nextent of full-time female labour force participation, the\npercentage of white-collar workers, and the percentage\nof females in the community who are separated or\ndivorced. In contrast, the contextual variables that\naffected out-of-wedlock birth included: female\nunemployment rate; median housing value; percentage of\nfemales separated or divorced; percentage of females at\nchildbearing age; sex ratio of the never married\npopulation; and the child/woman ratio for women aged\nwith higher levels of contraceptive effectiveness\nincluded rapid population growth, high socioeconomic\nstatus, and accessibility to family planning information\nand services. Community liberality, as measured by\nvoting patterns, was negatively associated with effective\ncontraceptive use.23\nPublic policy\nThe political atmosphere surrounding the years\nin favour of women who wanted to control their fertility\nand space their births. Although it was a time of new\ncontraceptive developments and advances, they were not\navailable to most of the target population. The media\npredominantly portrayed negative coverage by reporting\nmainly the complications of various forms of\ncontraception. Funding was cut for family planning\nservices and the services themselves were restricted. In\nthe year 2000, the Department of Health and Human\nServices announced increasing private sector insurance\ncoverage of contraceptives as an official public health\ngoal.24 Since then, considerable progress toward the goal\nhas been achieved; yet half of the women of reproductive\nhealth live in states where there is no such mandate.\nMoreover, the mandate relates to employees who are\ncovered through employers who purchase health\ninsurance and not to employees who work for employers\nwho self-insure.24 Health insurance continues to be a\nbarrier for women's reproductive health. A high\npercentage of poor women have no health insurance. In\naddition, federal spending under Title X declined between\ngrant programme dedicated solely to providing\nindividuals with comprehensive family planning and\nrelated preventive health services. The Title X programme\nis designed to provide access to contraceptive services,\nsupplies and information to all who want and need them.\nBy law, priority is given to persons from low-income\nGiven the dearth of research examining factors\nassociated with unintended pregnancy among married\nwomen, the purpose of the present study was to examine\nthe contexts in which unintended pregnancy occurs in this\ngroup. The proposed original model (Figure 1) based on\nMcLeroy et al.'s ecological model of health promotion\nUnintended pregnancy among married women\ngroup.bmj.com\nhttp://jfprhc.bmj.com/\nDownloaded from\nMethods\nThe study design was a secondary data analysis of the fifth\ncycle of the NSFG merged with contextual data available\nthrough the CDC. This study was approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board at the University of\nMassachusetts Lowell and the CDC Research Data Center.\nThe NSFG is a population-based survey of women,\naged 15\u00ad44 years, from the civilian non-institutionalised\nsector of the USA. The NSFG surveys women every 3 to 7\nyears on sexual activity, contraceptive use, family\nplanning, pregnancy intention, marriage and cohabitation,\nand infertility.26 At the time of this analysis, data were not\ndata collection; thus this study analysed the 1995 NSFG\ndataset. An analysis of the seventh cycle data is planned to\nexamine differences among the identified contextual\nfrom the first four levels of the socioecological model. The\nfifth level, public policy (i.e. the sociopolitical context in\nwhich the unintended pregnancies occurred) is described as\nthe background for this study.\nInclusion criteria for this study included women from\nthe USA who: were between the ages of 18 and 44 years at\nthe time of pregnancy conception; gave birth between the\nconception. The contextual NSFG data were available for\nthe women's addresses during the calendar years 1990,\npregnancy conception with the timing of the contextual\ndata collected and the women's address at the time the\npregnancy occurred, individual level data were merged\ncontextual data. The sample was limited to include\npregnancies that were conceived between the years 1985\nDefinitions of pregnancy intention vary. Often the terms\n`unplanned pregnancy' and `unintended pregnancy' are used\ninterchangeably. For the purpose of the study, a recoded\nvariable created by the NSFG data analysers was adopted.\nThe dependent variable, intendedness of pregnancy, was\ndefined as a dichotomous variable classified as unintended\nor intended pregnancy at the time of conception. To\noperationalise this concept, in the survey each woman was\nasked to think back to the time when she became pregnant.\nIf a woman responded that, at the time she became pregnant,\nshe did not want any more children, that pregnancy was\nclassified as unwanted. If the woman reported instead that\nshe did want a child in the future, she was asked whether that\npregnancy occurred too soon, too late or at about the right\ntime. Pregnancies that occurred too soon or were unwanted\nare classified as unintended, while those that occurred at\nabout the right time or too late are considered intended.5\nThe independent variables included seven\nintrapersonal indicators: age at conception, parity,\nrace/ethnicity, education, religious affiliation, exposure to\nsexual violence and poverty level income. Two main\ninterpersonal variables included were family background\nand husband's demographic factors such as race, education,\nreligious affiliation, and pregnancy intendedness. Family\nbackground included both the woman's father's education\nand intact status of her childhood family. The husband's\npregnancy intendedness was based on the woman's\nrecollection of her husband's pregnancy intendedness.\nThe availability of family planning services within the\ncounty of residence was chosen as an institutional level\nvariable from the NSFG contextual data set. Another\nindicator for the presence of institutions in the community\nwas the number of abortions per 10 000 women between\nthe ages of 15 and 44 years. Predictive community level\nfactors were divided into general categories: place of\nresidence and community marital status at the county level.\nThe place of residence was classified into: central cities of\nmetropolitan areas, suburban areas and non-metropolitan\nareas. Community marital status was measured by the\nproportion of women who were separated or divorced.\nKoren and Mawn\nFigure 1 An ecological model of factors\ninfluencing unintended pregnancy in\nmarried women. Figure developed by\nAinat Koren based on the general socio-\necological model for health promotion by\ngroup.bmj.com\nhttp://jfprhc.bmj.com/\nDownloaded from\nStatistics\nThe data were analysed using SAS version 8.12 (SAS\nInstitute Inc, Cary, NC, USA). As a preparation for the\nmultivariate analysis, several statistical procedures such as\nthe Chi square test, correlation tests and the Cochran-\nMantel-Haenszel statistical test were used to assess\nbivariate associations between the dependent variable\n(unintended pregnancy) and the variables chosen to\nrepresent the different levels of the ecological model. The\ncontextual county level variables were selected after\nextensive preliminary analysis and based on the literature.\nSeveral aggregate level variables were correlated with each\nother so that some of these variables could not enter into\nthe same statistical model at once. This happened\nespecially when the researchers introduced contextual\nvariables that could stand as a proxy for socioeconomic\nindicators such as female unemployment rate and\ncommunity education status. Since multicollinearity may\nlead to unstable estimates with large sample errors, only\none representative variable per theoretical model level was\nintroduced during the process of multilevel modelling\n(Appendix 1 shows the results from the bivariate analysis.)\nFor multivariate analyses, SAS PROC NLMIXED27\nprocedure was used to estimate the effects of the\ndimensions of individual and community characteristics on\nunintended pregnancies among married women. Two levels\nof data aggregation \u00ad individual and county level \u00adwere\nincluded in analysis. Because individuals are nested within\nregional contexts (counties used for this analysis), a\nmultilevel model was a preferable choice. These models\nmay be more realistic than models assuming that county\ncharacteristics have either no effect, or a constant effect on\nthe probability of having an unintended pregnancy.20\nIn this analysis, all regression coefficients other than\nthe intercept are constrained to be fixed across the county\nunits based on the assumption that the effect of the\nexplanatory variables does not differ between counties. A\ntwo-step analysis approach advocated by Raudenbuch and\nBryk28 was used. In a first stage of model building, models\nwith only individual effects were estimated. Consequently\nin the second stage, models with both individual and\ncounty variables were estimated due to the fact that several\ncontextual level variables were correlated with each other.\nResults\nTable 1 describes selected characteristics of women in this\nstudy. The table represents the weighted percentages that\nadjust for different sampling rates, response rates and\ncoverage rates so that accurate national estimates can be\nmade from the sample. The mothers were mainly of non-\nHispanic white origin (65%). Ninety-eight percent were\nmarried at the time of giving birth. Seventy-six percent of\nthe pregnancies were intended. This is comparable to the\npercentage of unintended pregnancies described by\nA significant association between pregnancy\nintendedness and place of residence while controlling for\nWomen living in central cities with a lower income had a\nhigher percentage of unintended pregnancies compared to\nwomen residing in the suburban and non-\nmetropolitan/rural areas belonging to a lower\nsocioeconomic status. In addition, there was a significant\nassociation between the proportion of women separated or\ndivorced in the community and unintended pregnancy\nwhile poverty level income was controlled for (p<0.0001).\nWomen living in communities with a higher divorce rate\nand a lower socioeconomic level had the highest\npercentage (37.18%) of unintended pregnancies (Figure 3).\nTable 2 summarises the results from the multivariate\nanalysis. The first model shows variability across counties\nfor pregnancy intendedness and therefore justifies the\napplication of this statistical method (Table 2, Model 1). In\nthe second model (Table 2, Model 2) the researchers\nintroduced the intrapersonal and interpersonal level\nvariables. The coefficients exhibited the predicted pattern\nconsistent with the literature. Non-Hispanic white women\nof higher socioeconomic level and lower parity had a lower\nprobability of an unintended pregnancy. The intact status of\nthe childhood family and the experience of forced sex was\na significant predictor as well but only in this model. Age\nat conception was not significant. This pattern followed\nthroughout the models.\nThe third model (Table 2, Model 3) introduced the\nhusbands' characteristics such as race, religion, education\nand pregnancy intention in addition to the community level\nvariable, the place of residence. Both were individual level\nvariables. The husband's race and perceived pregnancy\nintendedness showed a significant association with the\nprobability of unintended pregnancy. As with the women, a\nnon-Hispanic white husband had a lower probability of\nunintended pregnancy. The husband's positive pregnancy\nintendedness is significantly associated with the woman's\npositive pregnancy intendedness. The final model, Model 4\nFigure 2 Percentage of unintended\npregnancy among married women\nby poverty level income and place of\nUnintended pregnancy among married women\nLow Middle High\n-\nPercentage unintended (%)\ngroup.bmj.com\nhttp://jfprhc.bmj.com/\nDownloaded from\nintroduced contextual variables from the institutional\ntheoretical model level that showed significance at the\nbivariate analysis. The variables `family planning per\nwomen between 15 and 44 years' showed no significant\nassociation but improved the model fit (lowered the log\nlikelihood). The `proportion of women separated or\ndivorced' was included for the community level theoretical\nmodel level. The community marital status was\nsignificantly related to pregnancy intendedness (p<0.05).\nDiscussion\nThis study offers a unique contextual approach to examine\nthe relationship between several layers of a theoretical\nmodel using multilevel logistic regression. Overall,\nmarried women of lower socioeconomic status, higher\nparity, whose husband did not intend the pregnancy or who\nwere living in a community of marital instability had a\nhigher probability of an unintended pregnancy.\nThe only marginally significant contextual variable in\nthe model that increased the probability of unintended\npregnancy was the proportion of women in the community\nwho were separated or divorced. Previous research has\nfound that a married woman was less likely to have a child\nwhen she lived in a community where there was a high rate\nof separated and divorced families.22 The results of this\nstudy also suggested that the higher the rate of abortions in\nthe community, the lower the probability of unintended\npregnancy. The higher the rate of family planning services\nper 10 000 women in need, the lower was the probability of\nunintended pregnancy. Grady et al.23 found that community\nfamily planning clinics promote effective contraception\namong married women. Similarly, Foster et al.30 concluded\nthat family planning services in low-income families in\nCalifornia are essential to provide the necessary education\nand access to address long-terms needs related to pregnancy\nprevention. However, a recent review of the quality of\nfamily planning services concluded that the service quality\nmay vary significantly across sites.31\nOne explanation for the reason why community\ncharacteristics were not significant in the multivariate\nmodels could be the correlation between unobserved\nindividual characteristics and community factors.32 Those\nintrapersonal and interpersonal factors may enhance\nmarried women's vulnerability for a higher risk of\nunintended pregnancy, particularly when they are also\nexposed to unfavourable community and public policy\nfactors.33 Previous research looking at the impact of\ncommunity characteristics on a variety of outcomes\n(marital dissolution, fertility decisions, youth sexual\nactivity) did not find direct causal influence of\nneighbourhood characteristics on the studied outcomes as\nFigure 3 Percentage of unintended\npregnancy among married women\nby community family stability and\nTable 1 Selected sample characteristics\nVariables n % Weighted\n%\nPregnancy intendedness\nTimes married\nParity\nPregnancy order\nRace\nRespondent education\nReligion\nMetropolis residence\nKoren and Mawn\nLow Middle High\nPercentage unintended (%)\ngroup.bmj.com\nhttp://jfprhc.bmj.com/\nDownloaded from\nHusbands' perceived pregnancy intendedness was\nanother significant finding in this analysis, confirming\nprevious research that suggested that acceptability of the\nmother's pregnancy intention was highly associated with\nthe partner's attitude towards the pregnancy.18,19 Special\nefforts must be made to strengthen family planning\nservices to include men in counselling and to build positive\nmale attitudes toward reproductive health.30\nTable 2 Multilevel logistic models results predicting unintended pregnancy among married women\nPredictors\nIntercept\nINTRAPERSONAL\nAge at conception\nParity\nRace\nNon-Hispanic white\nOther (ref)\nPoverty level income\nEducation\nForced sex\nNo\nYes (ref)\nReligion\nNone/no specific\nRoman Catholic\nJewish/other\nProtestant (ref)\nINTERPERSONAL\nIntact childhood family\nTwo biological parents\nOther (ref)\nWomen's father's\neducation\nHusband's race\nNon-Hispanic white\nOther (ref)\nHusband's religion\nProtestant\nOther (ref)\nHusband's education\nPerceived husband's\nintendedness\nNot intended\nIntended (ref)\nINSTITUTIONAL\nFamily planning per\nwomen aged between\nCOMMUNITY\nMetropolis residence\nCentral cities\nNon-metropolitan\nSuburban (ref)\nProportion of women\nseparated or divorced\nEstimated variances \u00b50\nj\nGoodness of fit\n\u00ad2 log likelihood\nIndividual sample size\nCounty sample size\nModel 1: Null model.\nModel 2: Intrapersonal and Interpersonal level variables.\nModel 3: Added husband's characteristics and pregnancy intention with the community level variable, the place of residence.\nModel 4: Included all four levels of the social ecology model.\nTheoretical levels 1+2\n\n SE Sig\nTheoretical levels 1+2\n\n SE Sig\nTheoretical levels 1\u00ad4\n\n SE Sig\nNull Model\nUnintended pregnancy among married women\ngroup.bmj.com\nhttp://jfprhc.bmj.com/\nDownloaded from\nThe analysis revealed that the higher the woman's\neducation level, the lower the risk of unintended\npregnancy. Previous studies have shown a similar\nassociation between education and unintended\ncareer development and earning opportunities that are\nlikely to compete with domestic and childrearing\nresponsibilities.38 Since parity and race are related to\nsocioeconomic status, women with a lower poverty level\nincome had a higher parity and they are more likely to be\nnon-white. These results support findings from previous\nresearch indicating that women who were black and\nreported a lower socioeconomic status had a higher odds of\nhaving an unintended pregnancy compared with those of\nOf interest was the finding that Catholic women were not\nsignificantly more likely to have an unintended pregnancy\ncompared with Protestant women. Earlier studies have\nhypothesised differences among religious groups to be\nrelated to social norms, differential sex roles, male\u00adfemale\ncommunication patterns, and the differential use of\nphysician-based versus other sources of contraceptives.1,14,15\nIntact status of childhood family and past history of\nforced first sex showed significant association only at the\nsecond statistical model (Table 2, Model 2). As the model\nbecame more complex, other variables appeared to be\nstronger predictors (husband pregnancy intendedness, for\nexample).\nIn terms of the policy context, not much had changed in\nrelative to policies that impacted women and their partners\nwho are seeking to control their fertility from the time data\nwere collected for this survey to a more recent time period.\ntime period concluded that there is almost no change in the\noverall rate of unintended pregnancies with a slight rise for\nmarried women compared with the NSFG data from 1995.\nHealth insurance coverage rate during the compared years\nstayed at an average of 15% for the overall population,\nindicating persisting barriers to access to contraception and\nservices.39 Funding for family planning services for the\nlow-income population was cut and the services\nthemselves were restricted. Based on the described\nsimilarities, the same analysis using the seventh cycle of\nthe NSFG data should not be dramatically different from\nthese findings; however, comparative analyses are planned\nSeveral limitations were identified in this study. Given\ntheir holistic perspective, ecological models are very\ncomplex. Due to the complexity of the model and the large\nnumber of independent variables involved, several of the\npredictor variables may not be significant in the prediction\nof unintended pregnancy among married women due to the\nmultifaceted relation between the dependent variable and\nthe independent variables and between the independent\nvariables themselves. Another limitation of this study is the\npotential differences in cultural interpretation7,40 of the\nconstruct of pregnancy intention. Asking women to recall\npregnancy `intention' or `wantedness' from the past could\nalso lead to recall bias. However, previous research has\nshown that women can accurately recall pregnancy\ninformation after an extended period of time.41,42\nDespite these limitations, this study utilised a unique\napproach to examine the contextual factors associated with\npregnancy intendedness. Clinical implications include the\nneed for practitioners to identify those women at risk for\nunintended pregnancies with considerations of community\ncontextual factors in addition to personal risk factors. Also\nthe findings suggest that participation of husbands and\npartners in reproductive education, decision making and\nfamily planning services should be increased. Special\nefforts must be made to strengthen family planning\nservices to include men.\nFuture research in the planning stages includes a\ncomparative analysis of the NSFG seventh data cycle\nconstruct of pregnancy intention needs to be further refined\nto determine racial/ethnic and other cultural interpretations.\nIt is recommended that the social ecological model will be\nutilised to examine the contextual factors among married\nand unmarried women as well. Future population-based\nstudies should also include data from the women's partners\nto enhance interventions. This study has identified factors to\nsupport and enhance changes in practice with the aim of\nreducing unintended pregnancies in the USA. As the health\npolicy debate continues in the national arena, researchers,\nclinicians and policymakers need to come together to ensure\ncoverage for preventative services such as family planning.\nStatements on funding and competing interests\nFunding This study was not funded.
