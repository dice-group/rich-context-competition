Physical Activity in Individuals at Risk for Diabetes: Diabetes Prevention Program.\nquestionnaires with different time frames in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) cohort of 3234 overweight individuals aged > 25\nyr with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) from 27 centers across the United States. The three questionnaires were the Modifiable\nActivity Questionnaire (MAQ; past year), the Low-Level Physical Activity Recall (LOPAR; past 7 d), and the Third National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III; past month). This provided the opportunity to examine the relationship between the\nthree activity measures and to compare activity levels of the DPP sample with that of a national sample with IGT. Results: Leisure\nactivity determined by the three questionnaires significantly correlated with each other, although the correlations between MAQ and\nNHANES III were stronger (men: rho = 0.52; women: rho = 0.49; P G 0.01) than between LOPAR and either measure (men: rho =\ntolerance were significantly correlated with activity levels determined by MAQ and NHANES, but not LOPAR. Activity levels in\nDPP participants determined by the NHANES III questionnaire were generally higher than those reported by individuals meeting DPP\neligibility criteria who were part of the NHANES cohort for similar age, body mass index, and race or ethnicity. Conclusion: If the\nDPP participants were more active than a national sample of individuals with IGT, this would have implications for translation when\nusing the DPP lifestyle intervention in less active or less motivated populations. Finally, the weak relationship between activity levels\nobtained with MAQ and LOPAR may result from the fact that they encompass different time frames and different components of\nThe Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) was a\nrandomized clinical trial of diabetes prevention in\nelevated fasting glucose levels and impaired glucose toler-\nance (27).

Therefore, the\npurposes of this study were twofold: (a) to examine the\nmagnitude of the correlations among reported physical\nactivity levels in the DPP participants determined from\nthree different baseline activity questionnaires and between\nphysical activity levels determined by these questionnaires\nand measures of obesity and glucose tolerance; and (b) to\ncompare the prevalence of inactivity in individuals from\nthe DPP volunteer sample with the NHANES III cohort of\nindividuals in the United States with impaired glucose\ntolerance who had completed the same leisure activity\nquestionnaire a few years earlier.\nMETHODS\nNHANES III. This survey was conducted by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics at 89 U.S. locations between\nprobability cluster design with an oversampling of African\nAmericans, Hispanic Americans, and the elderly (16). A\nage completed a household interview. The survey included\na leisure physical activity questionnaire, which was also\ngiven to DPP participants at their baseline evaluation. The\nnumber of men and women who completed the physical\nactivity portion of the NHANES III and met basic DPP\nDPP. Details of the DPP study design have been de-\nscribed in detail (27). Participants were recruited for the\neach center approved the protocol, and all participants gave\nwritten, informed consent before baseline screening. Inclu-\nsion criteria included age of at least 25 yr, a body mass\nindex value of 24 kgImj2 or higher (22 or higher in Asian\nAmericans), physical ability to walk a quarter mile in\n10 min, and a plasma glucose concentration of 95\u00ad\n2 h after a 75-g oral glucose load. Standardized interviewer-\nadministered questionnaires were used to obtain data on\npersonal and medical history. Height and weight mea-\nsurements were used to calculate body mass index (BMI,\nkgImj2) and waist and hip circumference measures were\nused to determine the ratio of waist to hip circumference\n(WHR). Blood was drawn at baseline for fasting mea-\nsurements of glucose, HbA1c, and insulin and for 75-g\nOGTT measurements of insulin (30 min postload) and\nglucose (120 min postload). Immunoreactive insulin and\nproinsulin were measured in the plasma. These measures\nhave been described (6).\nSelf-reported physical activity levels were assessed at\nbaseline using three activity questionnaires with different\ntime frames: the Modifiable Activity Questionnaire (10),\nthe Low-Level Physical Activity Recall (8,20), and the\nNHANES III (16). These are described in detail below.\nThe modifiable activity questionnaire. The Modi-\nfiable Activity Questionnaire (MAQ) was designed for\neasy modification to maximize the feasibility and appro-\npriateness of physical activity assessment in a variety of\nminority populations and age groups (10) and is the pri-\nmary questionnaire used in the DPP (5). A unique feature\nof the MAQ is that the list of leisure activities is com-\nprehensive and appropriate for the DPP population because\nit was developed based on pilot work performed at all\nstudy sites. The MAQ has been shown to be both reliable\nand valid (through comparisons with activity monitors,\nfitness (field) testing, and the doubly labeled water\ntechnique) in adults and adolescents (2,9,25). The MAQ\nassesses past-year occupational and leisure activities,\nalthough leisure activity was the main focus of this effort.\nEstimates of leisure and occupational activity were calcu-\nlated separately as hours per week (hIwkj1) averaged over\nthe past year. Each activity was also weighted by its\nrelative intensity, referred to as a MET, thereby deriving\nMET-hours per week (METIhIwkj1) as the final unit of\nexpression. One MET represents the energy expenditure\nfor an individual at rest (1 MET = 3.5 mLIkgj1Iminj1 of\noxygen consumption), whereas a 10-MET activity requires\n10 times the resting energy expenditure.\nThe MAQ assesses both leisure and occupational\nphysical activity over the past year. Only physical activities\nthat demand energy expenditure greater than that required\nby activities of daily living (e.g., bathing, grooming, and\nfeeding) are assessed. For the leisure section of the\nquestionnaire, individuals were presented with a compre-\nhensive list of activities developed for the entire DPP\ncohort (determined by pilot testing) and were asked to\nreport the activities that they had participated in during the\npast 12 months. They were then asked to estimate the\nfrequency and duration for each activity identified. For\noccupational activity, individuals were asked to list all jobs\nheld during the past 12 months. For each job entry, data\nwere collected for time spent walking or cycling to work\nper day, as well as the average job schedule (months per\nyear, days per week, and hours per day worked). Activity\non the job was determined by the number of hours spent\nsitting at work and the most common physical activities\nperformed when not sitting.\nLow-level physical activity recall. The original 7-d\nPhysical Activity Recall (PAR) was developed primarily\nfor use in large population studies to evaluate habitual\nphysical activity levels in healthy persons (3,22,26). The\nLow-Level Physical Activity Recall (LOPAR) was modi-\nfied from the 7-d PAR (23,26) and validated for use in its\npresent form for persons having low levels of habitual\nphysical activity because it was suggested that the original\ninstrument might not be sufficiently sensitive to measure\nactivity in persons who are primarily sedentary (8,20). The\nLOPAR was validated in patients with peripheral arterial\ndisease as shown by correlations with maximal treadmill\ntreadmill walking time after exercise training (r = 0.46, P G\n0.05), and energy expenditure during home-based exercise\nIn type 2 diabetes, the LOPAR has also been correlated\nwith markers of exercise performance including V\nACTIVITY LEVEL IN ADULTS AT RISK FOR DIABETES Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise\nd\nCopyright @ 2006 by the American College of Sports Medicine. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\nAs with the original PAR, the LOPAR provides a\ngeneral measure of physical activity by assessing the total\nenergy expenditure of the individual at work and during\nhome and leisure-time activities for the preceding week\n(8,20). The LOPAR has been used in several treatment\nstudies (exercise training and atorvastatin) in individuals\nwith peripheral arterial disease (14,19,20). It has also been\nused in physiologic studies of persons with uncomplicated\nand recently diagnosed diabetes at baseline and after\ntreatment with exercise training (4).\nThe LOPAR assesses all types of physical activity\n(occupational, leisure, and home), although leisure activity\nwas the main focus of the present study. The amount of\nenergy expenditure for each activity is quantified in terms\nof metabolic equivalents for each activity. Participants are\nasked about the number of hours spent performing very\nMETs), and heavy (Q 6 METs) activities. Data are reported\nin MET-hours per week, derived by multiplying the amount\nof time spent performing an activity by the MET value of\nthe activity.\nPhysical activity questionnaire from the\nNHANES III. The physical activity questionnaire from\nNHANES III asked whether individuals had engaged in any\nof the following activities over the past month: walking,\njogging, bike riding, swimming, aerobics, dancing, calis-\nthenics, gardening, weightlifting, or ``other exercise, sports,\nor physically active hobbies not mentioned'' (16). The\nsummary leisure activity estimate was expressed as times\nper month because estimates of duration were not collected.\nIndividuals were classified as inactive if they did not report\nengaging in any of these activities over the past month.\nStatistical methods. For comparison of NHANES III\ncohort with DPP participants, the NHANES III sample was\nweighted according to the population weights provided for\nthe morning, fasting sample. The weighted percent who\nreported being physically inactive based on the NHANES\nIII instrument from the NHANES III cohort and the\npercent inactive among DPP participants were computed\nacross age, BMI, and race groups.\nComparing physical activity estimates deter-\nmined by three activity questionnaires among\nDPP participants. Spearman rank\u00adorder correlation coef-\nficients were determined to assess both the bivariate asso-\nciations between the various physical activity measures\nestimated from the three questionnaires and to examine the\nassociation between these physical activity estimates and mea-\nsures of obesity and glucose tolerance adjusted for age and\nstratified by sex in this cohort. Leisure physical activity levels\ndetermined by the MAQ were compared between men and\nwomen, ethnic or racial groups, and age groups (G 45 yr, 45\u00ad\n59 yr, and Q 60 yr) using the non-parametric Mann\u00adWhitney\nFIGURE 1-- Median hours per week of baseline leisure physical activity levels based on the Modifiable Activity Questionnaire (MAQ) in Diabetes\nPrevention Program (DPP) participants by sex, ethnicity, and age.

The mean BMI for the entire cohort ranged across\nBaseline leisure physical activity levels of the DPP\nparticipants from the MAQ are presented in Figure 1,\nstratified by sex, age, and race or ethnicity. Women\nreported being less active than men (P G 0.0001), and\nolder individuals (Q 60 yr of age) reported more leisure\nphysical activity (P G 0.0001) compared with younger age\ngroups. Finally, leisure-time physical activity levels varied\nby race or ethnicity, with the small number (N = 20) of\nAmerican Indian men reporting more leisure activity than\nany other group (P G 0.0002). Similar patterns for leisure\nphysical activity were observed based on the LOPAR\nquestionnaire (i.e., highest in the oldest age group and\nsomewhat higher in men than women; data not shown).\nCorrelations among the three physical activity measures\n(MAQ, LOPAR, NHANES III) collected at baseline of the\nDPP are presented in Table 1 stratified by sex.

The\nNHANES leisure estimate was significantly related to\nwaist-to-hip ratio in men but not in women. Likewise,\nphysical activity estimates obtained from the MAQ (leisure\nand total activity) and the NHANES III (leisure activity)\nwere generally significantly and inversely associated with\nfasting and 75-g OGTT measurements of insulin (fasting\nand 30 min postload), fasting plasma proinsulin, and\nHbA1c. The LOPAR leisure activity estimate was signifi-\ncantly and inversely correlated with fasting and 30-min\npostload insulin in men alone. Physical activity levels from\nthese three questionnaires were not consistently associated\nwith fasting or postload glucose values (Table 2).\nFinally, presented in Table 3 are the leisure physical\nactivity levels collected with the NHANES III instrument\nfor the DPP participants compared with activity levels\nreported by individuals meeting DPP eligibility criteria\nwho were part of the NHANES III cohort. In general,\nwomen were less active than men in both cohorts, with\nrelatively more women reporting being physically inactive,\nconsistent with the DPP_s MAQ and the LOPAR results.\nThe DPP women and men were less inactive than the\nNHANES III sample for most age, BMI, and race or\nethnicity groups.\nDISCUSSION\nMany of the current findings regarding the physical\nactivity levels of the DPP participants were anticipated and\nconsistent with previous literature. Among the DPP partic-\nipants, men reported participating in more leisure activity\nand, therefore, were less likely to report being inactive when\ncompared with women. This was a consistent finding across\nthree national U.S. surveys (National Health Interview\nwhere the ratio for the prevalence of physical inactivity for\nwomen compared with men ranged from 1.2 to 1.7 across\nthese three surveys (17). That men reported more leisure\nactivity and less inactivity than women was also seen in the\nsubgroup of the NHANES III cohort with known type 2\ndiabetes (15). Physical inactivity measurement in the\nNHANES III was based on reported participation in\nleisure-time physical activity alone and did not include\nparticipation in nonleisure activity such as housework or\noccupational activity.\nBased on the average number of hours of reported\nleisure activity per week averaged over the past year, the\nmost active age group in the DPP cohort was aged Q 60 yr.\nThis trend held, for the most part, across all sex and ethnic\ngroups. This finding is inconsistent with the general notion\nthat physical activity decreases with age in adults (17,24).\nCloser examination of national data collected around the\ntime of the DPP (17), however, showed that the percent of\nadults, particularly men, who reported regular, sustained\nleisure physical activity (five or more times per week for\n30 or more minutes per occasion) was somewhat higher in\nand women reporting participation in regular, sustained\nthe percent of men and women reporting participation in\nregular, sustained leisure physical activity in the 1992\nand 19.0% in women for the same three age groups. An\nincrease in leisure activity levels with retirement had also\nbeen seen in individuals from the Atherosclerosis Risk in\nCommunities Study (7). These data suggest that a\nsubstantial number of older adults of retirement age spend\na significant amount of their time engaging in measurable\nlevels of leisure physical activity. An additional explana-\ntion may be that the older DPP participants may have been\nmore physically active or lifestyle conscious throughout\nlife, and thus may have attained a later age before\nbecoming IGT and thus eligible for the DPP.\nThree different activity questionnaires that varied by\ntime frame were used to assess baseline physical activity\nlevels in the DPP. The advantage of assessing activity\nusing a survey with a short time frame, such as prior week,\nis that the estimate is less likely to suffer from recall bias.\nIn contrast, assessment over a longer time period such as\n1 yr is more likely to reflect ``usual'' behavior because\nactivity levels can vary with season, poor health condition,\nComparing the leisure physical activity results from the\nthree measures collected at baseline, it is not surprising that\nstrongly related, at least in part because the latter assesses\npast-week activity, whereas the MAQ asks about physical\nactivity over the past year. Previous studies in both\nadolescents (1) and adults (28) found stronger relationships\nbetween past-year physical activity assessment and the\naverage of four past-weeks recalls collected over the same\nyear than when just one past-week recall was used. It is\npossible that LOPAR repeated throughout the year would\nbe more strongly related to the past-year MAQ than one\ntime point alone.\nAnother consistent finding in the present study was that\nthe leisure sections of the MAQ and the NHANES III\nquestionnaires were more strongly related to each other than\neither one was to LOPAR. Part of the explanation for this\nfinding is the specific components of physical activity that\nthese three questionnaires assess. Both the MAQ and the\nNHANES III questionnaire assess the frequency of popular\nmoderate- to high-intensity leisure activities, whereas\nLOPAR attempts to quantify the entire spectrum of\nintensities, including activities of daily living, by asking\nabout the number of hours spent in sleep and in very light,\nlight, moderate, and heavy leisure activities during the\nprevious week. This difference in the components of\nphysical activity assessed by these questionnaires resembles\nhttp://www.acsm-msse.org\n830 Official Journal of the American College of Sports Medicine\nCopyright @ 2006 by the American College of Sports Medicine.

In general,\nthe NHANES III and the MAQ were significantly related to\neach other and to most of these biological variables, with the\nexception of glucose and WHR. In contrast, the LOPAR was\nfound to be less consistently related to any of these\nbiological measures, suggesting that its use may be more\nappropriate in lower-functioning individuals for whom it\nwas initially designed (8,20) or in a less diverse population.\nThe most interesting finding was that the level of reported\nphysical inactivity in the DPP cohort was less than that\nreported in the NHANES III subgroup with impaired\nglucose tolerance. This finding was evident across most\nage, BMI, and racial or ethnicity groups. Although the small\nsample size of the NHANES III subgroup may suggest a\nchance reason for this finding, another explanation might be\nthe different sample selection in the two studies. The\nNHANES III survey is a cross-sectional observational study\nof a random sample of the U.S. population. In contrast, the\nDPP cohort represents a volunteer sample of individuals\ncommitted to a long-term intervention study. In addition,\none of the inclusion criteria for the DPP was that you had to\nbe physically able to walk a quarter mile in 10 min, whereas\nsuch criteria for NHANES III did not exist. Considering the\nrange of options described above for the finding that\nreported physical inactivity in the DPP was less than that\nreported in the NHANES III, the most likely explanation is\nthat the DPP participants were a healthier and possibly more\nmotivated group of individuals because they agreed to\nparticipate in this clinical trial and they met the DPP\neligibility criteria. If this is true, these findings have\nimplications for the translation of the DPP findings. On\none hand, if the DPP cohort was healthier and somewhat\nmore motivated than individuals in the general U.S.\npopulation with impaired glucose tolerance, then it could\nbe more difficult to implement the DPP healthy lifestyle\nprogram in the latter. On the other hand, the impact of the\nDPP lifestyle intervention might be greater in those who are\nless active at baseline.\nOne of the main focuses in recent public health research\nis the effort to translate the lifestyle intervention portion of\nsuccessful efficacy trials such as the DPP program into the\ncommunity (18). Thus, the suggestion that those individ-\nuals in the general community in the United States with\nprediabetes would be less motivated than the DPP\nvolunteer cohort is an important finding. Coupled with a\nsmaller budget, less personnel, and less training and\nsupport, the likely addition of less motivated community\nparticipants adds to the challenge of these future translation\nefforts. In lieu of these difficulties, we need to adjust our\nexpectations accordingly with regard to the potential\nimpact of these community efforts.\nIn summary, baseline leisure activity in the DPP cohort\nsuggests that men and women in the DPP trial may have\nbeen more active than the small subgroup of individuals\nfrom the NHANES III cohort who had impaired glucose\ntolerance. This may possibly be a ``healthy volunteer\neffect''; if so, this would have implications for the future\ntranslation of the DPP lifestyle intervention in other\npopulations. Finally, the weak relationship between leisure\nphysical activity levels obtained with the MAQ and the\nLOPAR is consistent with the fact that they encompass\nboth different time frames and different components of\nleisure physical activity.\nThe work was compiled by The Diabetes Prevention Program\nResearch Group.
