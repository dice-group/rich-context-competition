This article subjects that binary to critical attention and proposes a limited\nsynthesis based upon the proximity of the pains of punishment to the intentional\nacts of sentencing authorities that would encourage a closer correspondence\nbetween criminal justice and social reality. Although this paper is situated in the\nsentencing practice of England and Wales, the model it proposes is abstract and\ncould be adapted to other jurisdictions.\nThe article begins by exploring the fundamental challenges facing attempts at\njust sentencing for both penal objectivists and subjectivists. It then lays out the\n`proximity' model in detail. Lastly, it considers the implications of this model for\nboth sentencing practice and penal policy.\nSentencing, delimitation, and difference\nThe orthodox definition of punishment\nSubjectivist and objectivist measurements of punishment tend to take subtly dif-\nferent approaches to the task of defining what `punishment' consists of. However,\nthey start from more or less the same point: the `Flew\u00adBenn\u00adHart' account, devel-\noped in the late 1950s and early 1960s. On this account, criminal punishment has\nfive characteristics. It is (a) unpleasant, (b) imposed for conduct that has breached\nlegal rules, (c) targeted against the individual responsible for that conduct, (d)\nimposed intentionally by State agents other than the subject, who are (e) acting\nFrom the perspective of measuring how much punishment a particular sentence\ninvolves, two of these five characteristics are seemingly in tension: element (a),\nunpleasantness, implies that severity is calculated according to how unpleasant\nthe subject's actual experience of punishment is; whilst for element (d), intention-\nality, what matters is how much unpleasantness the State's agents objectively\nintend. As a result, element (a) is sometimes given as an objectivising compromise,\n`normally considered unpleasant' (compare Walker, 1991: 1\u00ad3). Rather than rely-\ning on individual experiences, the accepted severity of the punishment is calculated\nin terms of how unpleasant something would usually be, determined by sentencing\nauthorities' experiences, and by the distant perspectives of penal policy-makers\nUltimately, this definition has proven popular amongst penal theorists and\npolicy-makers alike (e.g. Duff, 2001; Markel, 2001). It is especially hegemonic at\nthe level of sentencing, where decisions as to penal severity must necessarily be\nmade with imperfect knowledge about the penal subject's past and future con-\nmay not be completely irrelevant to the calculation of penal severity, in other\nwords, accepted wisdom posits that we can only do so much to take penal\nsubjects' circumstances and likely experiences into account at the point of\nsentence.\nPenal objectivism: The challenge of difference\nHowever, a central problem with this objective approach is that it obscures signifi-\ncant variation in the impact of criminal punishment upon different subjects. This\n`challenge of differences in impact' (Ryberg, 2010: 74\u00ad82) represents a particularly\nentrenched difficulty for the measurement of penal severity (e.g. Beccaria, 1764),\nespecially given the difficulty of achieving `just deserts in an unjust world' (Tonry,\nently by seemingly equal treatment, as a result of their expectations, prior experi-\nences, and social context. The failure to account for these differences ultimately\nresults in the entrenchment of differentiated treatment at every stage of the criminal\njustice process, which tends to magnify the impact of social injustices, such as\npoverty and racial inequalities, through criminal justice interventions (e.g.\nThis is a problem of under-definition of what `counts' as punishment. By focuss-\ning entirely upon what the State wants to do, rather than what it does, we implicitly\nfocus the State's normative obligation to justify its `pain delivery' (Christie, 1982)\non the aims of State actors, rather than on the consequences for individuals and for\nsociety. By measuring punishment only in terms of abstract deprivations of liberty,\nwe reify it (and its imperfections) as an inevitable and unquestionable aspect of our\nsociety, to be mediated by other social policy interventions, if at all. But that is not\nto escape the authoritarian and coercive nature of State punishment. It is only to\nMore to the point, the purely objective account of punishment is descriptively\nunsatisfying in an era when social research is making the lived experience of social\nphenomena evermore accessible. It is increasingly possible to perceive the impacts\nof punishment as a subjectively experienced reality as well as a political-philoso-\nphical transaction: to supplement the austere, abstract account of `law on the\nbooks' with fine detail about punishment as `something that is done to people\nand experienced by people' (Sexton, 2015: 115, original emphasis). If penal object-\nivism was necessary because of the challenges of taking subjective difference into\naccount at the point of sentence, then advances that social research has made in the\nhalf century since the `Flew-Benn-Hart' definition in detailing those differences are\nrelevant to the debate. A modern penologist still could not accurately predict the\nfuture experience of a penal subject, but she could at least contribute to recognising\npatterns in past empirical experiences to a greater extent. The epistemological\nobjection to subjectivised measurements of penal severity cannot be ignored, but\nit is overblown in the modern era.\nPenal subjectivism: The challenge of delimitation\nThere are, in short, compelling epistemic and ethical reasons to move away\nfrom a purely objective approach to measuring penal severity. However, a\nfully subjective measurement of sentence severity would also be subject to ser-\nious weaknesses. For one, even if social research has made subjective experi-\nences of punishment more accessible to penal decision-makers, the challenges of\naccurately and consistently predicting future experiences of punishment remain.\nEven if subjectivised punishment is an ideal situation, the complexities of human\nlife make perfect predictions unrealistic, compelling judges to either monitor\npenal subjects constantly for signs of over- or under-punishment (compare\ntors cause potentially radical inequalities in penal subjects' experiences of pun-\nishment. Neither possibility would be solve the `challenge of differences in\nimpact' discussed above.\nlenge of delimitation'. This is, essentially, a problem of over-definition: if the only\ncriterion for what counts as punishment is the subject's experience of unpleasant-\nness, then it becomes practically impossible to separate unpleasantness that is the\nresult of the intrusion of the penal State from unpleasantness that is otherwise\nextant in the subject's post-conviction life. As a result, accounts of subjective\npenal experiences tend to provide catalogues of hardship, and to offer little, if\nany basis for comparing the relative severity of particular sentences. That is, they\ntell us that punishment is unpleasant, and in what ways, but not how unpleasant,\nand as a result of which specific causes. However, to accurately measure penal\nseverity, which is a prerequisite of ensuring equality before penal law, we need\nprecisely that capacity for distinguishing punitive pains from non-punitive ones,\nin a way that allows for penal experiences to be meaningfully compared (Hayes,\nThis is one reason why the objectivising definition of punishment in terms of\nwhat is `normally considered unpleasant' has survived for so long. A purely\nsubjective account is no better at achieving just sentencing than a purely object-\nive one, and is considerably harder to operationalise. Any account of subject-\nivity is relegated to the formulation of penal policy, which necessarily deals with\nmacro-social issues in the abstract, rather than (directly) confronting the lived\nexperience of individuals.\nHowever, this prevents sentencing authorities from dealing with the painful\ncontexts in which they sentence, and to a certain extent excuses them of ethical\nresponsibility for imposing them. Epistemologically and ethically, we can do\nbetter than `normally considered unpleasant'. This article provides an overview\nof a model attempting to do so, framing penal severity so as to emphasise\nsubjective experience, whilst still allowing clarity about what punishments con-\nsists of.\nModelling the proximity of the pains of punishment to the\npenal State\nThe model I propose conceptualises punishment in terms of pain and categorises\nthose pains in terms of their proximity to the (penal) State. I should therefore start\nby defining these two key concepts.\nPain\nThe `pains of punishment' are a well-established subject of penological research,\nalthough it is only in the last few decades that a full range of custodial and non-\ncustodial sentences has been considered in light of them (e.g. Christie, 1982: 9\u00ad11;\nA pain of punishment can therefore be defined (at least for present purposes) as\na personal experience of physical, mental, or emotional suffering by a penal subject,\narising from their punishment by agents of a criminal justice system. That concept of\n`arising from' will need to be addressed in the rest of this article, since it cuts to the\nheart of the subjectivist/objectivist divide. However, it is important to stress that\nthis approach views punishment as intrinsically and subjectively unpleasant (com-\npare Matravers, 2016), and something that is only ultimately defined by individual\nexperience (however much that experience is structured by socio-demographic con-\ntexts such as gender, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic class, and sexual orientation).\nMoreover, the concept of `pain' needs to be understood as more than a neuro-\nlogical phenomenon \u00ad it includes physical agony, mental trauma, and emotional\nangst (Christie, 1982: 9\u00ad11). However, it is possible to speak of pains varying over\ntime and to compare them against one another in general terms. The pains of\npunishment provide a research intensive but richly detailed metric of punishment's\nIt is also important to stress the individuated nature of these pains, which may\nwell exist alongside positive experiences and penal outcomes. A probationer, for\nexample, may be happy to participate in unpaid work as part of her order because\nshe wishes to make reparations for her crime (I am grateful to my anonymous\nreviewers for this example). Like Raskolnikov, she is eager to suffer her punishment\nand may even look to derive something positive from it. But that does not mean that\nsuggests that those who are most engaged with community punishments are most\nlikely to experience particular pains, particularly the shame of their offending and\npains associated with rehabilitative processes themselves (Hayes, 2015: 90\u00ad94). Just\nbecause a sentence benefits the offender, it does not follow that it cannot also hurt\nOne difficulty with using the pains of punishment is that the concept was not\ndesigned for consistent comparisons between subjects. Indeed, most studies to date\nhave provided purely subjectivist accounts: detailed overviews of the (harmful)\nlived experiences of particular subjects' punishments (e.g. Christie, 1982: 9\u00ad11;\n1958: 64). But these still leave us with the problem of delimitation. Pains can\n(and routinely do) arise out of (re)actions to conviction and punishment from\ncommunity forces, friends, family, and other departments of State, for instance.\nAny use of the pains of punishment to measure penal severity must consider how\nmuch weight (if any) to give these factors in its calculus. This is where a consider-\nation of proximity comes into play.\nProximity\nPain does not exist in a vacuum. Whatever form it might take, it is caused, exa-\ncerbated, and ameliorated by specific factors. The interplay of these factors enables\nthe division of the pains of punishment into a taxonomy based upon the closeness\nof their relationship to the intentional actions of the penal State. Specifically, this\nmodel identifies four distinct classes (depicted graphically in Figure 1): direct pains,\nwhich are straightforwardly intended by the State; oblique pains, which can be said\nto be indirectly intended by the State, by analogy with criminal law; contextual\npains, which are unintended but still bear a causal connection to the severity of the\npenal intervention; and entirely unrelated pains that are only coincidentally extant\nin the subject's life during their punishment.\nThis distribution of pains enables us to revisit the question of which pains\nshould be taken into account when determining the severity of sentences.\nFigure 1. Model of the proximity of pains of punishment to the penal State.\nWe might take some or all of these groups of pains into account (with the exception\nof those which are wholly unrelated to punishment). Although this taxonomy still\nprovides no immediate means of ranking pains of punishment against one another\n(compare `penal impact' in Hayes (2016)), it does enable us to identify certain\ngroups of pains that are more or less clearly associated with the infliction of pun-\nishment, notwithstanding their lack of (penal State) intentionality.\nBefore discussing these categories in more detail, I should make two observa-\ntions about the model. First, Figure 1 is not (necessarily) to scale. One penal subject\nmay suffer numerous contextual pains, for instance, and another virtually none.\nSecond, there is no reason to assume that more direct pains necessarily contribute\nmore to the severity of individual sentences. Indeed, several pains that are routinely\nhighlighted as particularly severe by penal subjects, such as the interruption of\nfamily relationships, may be wholly contextual, whereas direct pains, such as lib-\nOverview of the proximity model\nSubject to those reservations, I now turn to the four categories of pains in more\ndetail. Direct pains are relatively straightforward. They are those pains arising from\nexplicitly intended penal State activities. The obvious examples of this sort of pain\nare those associated with the deprivation of liberty. When an authority sentences a\npenal subject to a particular punishment, they intend her to lose some of her free-\ndoms of choice and self-direction, whether through incarceration, or the more\npartial restrictions of choice arising out of community penalties (Durnescu, 2011:\nthe sentencing authority wants to happen to the penal subject, and so are easy to\nidentify from either the sentence itself, or the fundamental nature of the modes of\nUnrelated pains are equally straightforward: they are unintended by the penal\nState (although they may be intended by other branches of government) and are\nneither caused nor exacerbated by the conviction and punishment of the penal\nsubject. Thus, they cannot be said to have any proximity to penal State actions\nat all. The example in Figure 1 is personal bereavement. Suppose I am sentenced to\na community order, and thereafter a beloved relative suddenly and unexpectedly\ndies. One would expect this to hurt me profoundly, but that suffering could not\nreasonably be linked to the acts of the penal State.\nHowever, it is very easy for initially unrelated pains to become affected by State\npunishment. Suppose that my relative was terminally ill and my sentence prevented\nme from visiting him in his final days. Here, the separation of the pains of my\nbereavement from my punishment becomes trickier. To what extent, if at all,\nshould my personal loss now be considered as part of my punishment's severity?\nThe two remaining groups of pains, the oblique and the contextual, attempt to\nresolve some of these definitional issues. Let us discuss each in turn.\nOblique intent and the penal State: An analogy with criminal law\nOblique pains are a relatively narrow class of negative outcomes that the State can\nbe said to indirectly intend. They enable compromise between pure penal object-\nivism and subjectivism, because they engage with empirical experiences, whilst\nremaining compatible with the orthodox (Flew\u00adBenn\u00adHart) definition's `intention-\nality' requirement. It does so via an analogy to the concept of `intention' in English\ncriminal law.\nThe definition of `intention' has consistently confounded criminal lawyers,\nresulting in a relatively complex definition in the substantive law. To paraphrase\nthe classic example (see generally Pedain, 2003): I ship cargo on a transatlantic\nflight and secretly hide a bomb on board with the aim of destroying the cargo in\norder to claim on a lucrative insurance policy I have against it. I have no specific\ndesire to kill the craft's crew, and whilst I know they will be endangered, I hope that\nthey survive. My only aim is the destruction of the cargo. However, when the bomb\ndetonates, it destroys the aircraft, killing everyone on board.\nWhile it is easy to say that I intend the destruction of the cargo when I detonate\nthe bomb, it is harder to show that I `intend' the aeroplane's crew's deaths.\nNevertheless, the position of English law is that I may be taken to have intended\nthose deaths, provided that I: (a) accurately foresee the consequence (the death of\nthe crew) as a `virtual certainty' of my actions; and (b) undertake those actions\nIt is important to recognise that the substantive law's use of the concept of\n`intention' is slightly different to that of the orthodox definition of punishment.\nThe substantive doctrine of oblique intent is a means of deciding whether the\nsubject is culpable enough to be held criminally responsible. In the penal context,\nby contrast, we are asking whether the pains in question are sufficiently proxim-\nate to State agents' intentions to allow us to take them into account when\ndetermining penal severity. But responsibility and severity of impact are not\nthe same thing: the former does not affect the latter, especially if we accept\nthat subjective experience is what constitutes penal severity. We must be cautious,\ntherefore, about taking the legal test out of its conceptual and purposive context,\ndespite the intuitive appeal of holding the State to the same standards to which it\nholds its citizens.\nNevertheless, oblique State intent is a useful heuristic. It allows us to take some\nsubjective experiences into account when calculating penal severity, without sacrifi-\ncing our ability to meaningfully define punishment. Specifically, oblique intent\ncontains two relatively narrow classes of pains: general and specific oblique pains.\nGeneral oblique pains are those which are virtually certain consequences of\ncriminal conviction and punishment in all cases, but which are not directly intended\nby the sentencing judge. A good example would be the diminished employability\nthat routinely accompanies a criminal conviction. Internationally, criminological\nresearch suggests that convicts will spend an average of two more years than non-\nconvicted job seekers searching for employment, because of the stigma associated\nwith the status of being an (ex-)offender (e.g. Graffam et al., 2008). In other words,\nall forms of criminal conviction carry an unintended, community-caused effect that\nis likely to occur (and cause at least some pain) in almost every case.\nAccepting general obliquely intended pains into our analysis of penal severity\nshould not mean that we must assume that every (jobless) convict will face exactly\n24 months of additional job seeking ahead of them. Some penal subjects will face\nlonger or shorter periods of unemployment, and in any event, each individual will\nbe pained by that unemployment in different ways and to different extents (com-\nat sentence \u00ad for instance, via a general reduction in the duration and onerousness\nof sentences by policy-makers, calculated with reference to research findings\naround the duration and effects of post-conviction joblessness.\nThis is not really subjectivism, in that it assumes consequences in an individual's\n(inherently unpredictable) future on the basis of prior cases. Rather, this category\ncompromises between subjective and objective viewpoints. It allows us to alter our\nunderstanding of differences in (highly probable) impact over time, as the relation-\nship between conviction and pain-causing factors changes. This would be difficult\nand research intensive, undoubtedly, but by no means impossible. The more that\nphenomena such as reduced employability are explored (and made accessible to\nsentencing authorities) by social research, the easier it will be to accurately predict\nthe duration and subjective impact of reduced employability in specific cases to a\ngreater extent than is presently attempted.\nBy contrast, specific oblique pains are those which are virtually certain to arise in\nthe particular case of the sentenced person. It is possible to interrogate the subject's\ncircumstances much more directly here, using, for instance, pre-sentence reports,\nwhich are already a highly influential source of information for Anglo-Welsh sen-\nA good example of specific oblique pains would be those attending upon the\nloss of one's home as a result of being imprisoned. These outcomes may be\npredictable from information available to the court \u00ad for instance, where,\nunder the terms of the penal subject's housing arrangements, conviction results\nin automatic eviction. The sentencing authority can be virtually certain of the\nconsequence, however much it may not desire it. By recognising the virtual cer-\ntainty for that person, the possibility of recognising and accounting for the pains\nthat this outcome is liable to cause opens up at the sentencing stage. Again, the\nenquiry into which pains connect to particular consequences of punishment in\nparticular classes of offenders' contexts can be explored through social research\nand its potential to mitigate State punishments set within limits assigned by penal\npolicy-makers.\nThus, oblique State intention allows us to account for a range of subjective\nfactors that are relatively constrained, and which, although they tend to originate\noutside of the State, are sufficiently proximate to its decision-making that they can\nbe analysed at the point of sentence. They provide an opportunity to substantially\nmoderate the painfulness of penal State interventions, by better accounting for the\ndifferent circumstances of particular subjects, whether as individuals or as classes.\nHowever, it should be recognised that they do `objectivise' individual pains to\nat least some extent, making them only a partial tool for confronting the challenge\nposed by differences in impact to the accurate measurement of penal severity.\nContextual pains and State responsibility: Beyond the analogy with\ncriminal law\nContextual pains, by contrast, consist of a much wider array of potential causes\nand effects. The example in Figure 1 is of the cluster of pains that potentially attend\nthe interruption of family relationships by punishment. This might be relatively\ntotal, as with the loss of (direct) contact, outside of visitation, that attends impris-\nmore indirect interference with the freedom to spend time with parents, children,\nspouses, and other family members. Pains of separation, absence from key devel-\nopmental moments, or emotionally resonant events can be numerous, chimerical,\nand yet deeply significant in terms of their impact upon the penal subject's life\nwould achieve a greater deal of fidelity to social reality when measuring penal\nseverity, but doing so would require extremely fine detail on individual convicts'\n(predicted) circumstances.\nWhilst my analogy with oblique intent was constructed around pains that are (or\ncould be) foreseen as virtually certain at the point of sentence, contextual pains are\nless predictable. They cover a wide variety of actions and reactions by groups\nformally unconnected to the penal State, including but not limited to: other\npublic organisations, such as the welfare State and social services, charities and\nother third-sector organisations, private companies, community forces, friends and\nfamily, and indeed penal subjects themselves.\nMost significantly, however, these actors cannot influence the sentencing author-\nity, in that they may not be foreseeable, let alone virtually certain, sources of pain\nat the point of sentence. However, unlike unrelated pains, contextual pains bear an\nindirect connection to the subject's conviction and punishment. Pains that already\nexisted in the penal subject's life could be affected (positively or negatively) by the\nsentence, and new pains may be caused by the reactions of wider social actors to it.\nIn both cases we can say that, whilst not necessarily foreseen or even foreseeable by\nsentencing authorities, these sources of pain are still proximate to the State in that\npains are caused by penal intervention.\nI use causation here in a broader sense than the substantive law. Essentially, the\nlaw first identifies a broad range of factors that the outcome could not have\ntors to those which ought to render the relevant actor legally responsible (e.g. R v\nof this approach, see Hart and Honore\nconcerned here with the State's responsibility for the pains of punishment.\nRather our focus is the impact that those pains have on that punishment's severity.\nIn other words, our field of enquiry is broader here than in the legal determination\nof guilt, and so a broader definition of causation is appropriate.\nHowever, there is reason for caution when incorporating contextual pains into\nthe measurement of penal severity. At its most extreme, this category could encom-\npass virtually any suffering experienced over a period starting before, during, or\nlong after formal punishment is imposed. Moreover, since social experiences are\nrarely, if ever, the results of isolated causes, pains are likely to overlap in unpre-\ndictable ways. Where one subject might well distinguish between particular pains\n(`X hurts, and so does Y'), another may not (`I am in pain'). Arbitrarily separating\nout different categories of pains in the latter case risks both researcher bias and the\nvery ignorance of difference that the model is intended to avoid. In short, distin-\nguishing contextual and unrelated pains, and recognising their experienced impact,\nrequires careful, critical, and work-intensive empirical study.\nDespite these difficulties, however, there are compelling reasons to take at least\nsome account of contextual pains: first, because of the particular need to recognise\nthe impact of external actors upon the experienced pains of punishment; and second,\nbecause of the general inaccessibility of contextual pains to sentencing authorities.\nThe role that non-State actors play in criminal justice is inevitably controversial.\nThe State's monopoly over criminal justice is an entrenched political value in\nEngland and Wales (and in much of the Global West), in part because of that\nsystem's emergence as a means of replacement for destabilising private revenge.\nState punishment derives its legitimacy in part from the belief that it has `civilised'\nthe brutality of feudal retaliation by channelling it through impartial, dispassionate\nsion of non-State actors is therefore a significant disturbance of the State's trad-\nitional role in attributing guilt and punishment.\nMoreover, if the State is not a monopolist of punishment, it cannot guarantee\nthat the suffering it imposes is constrained by any principle of proportionality,\nparsimony, or penal minimalism. It is compelled: either to attempt to stop third\nparties from paining the penal subject without explicit State permission; or to\naccept that it plays only a partial role in punishing the individual, and mediate\nits own actions accordingly. All else is a retreat back towards the unsatisfyingly\nshallow accounts of pure objectivism.\nEven if we might want to achieve something like an abstract liberal vision of the\npunished individual in relation to their punishing society, in which punishment is\nabstract deprivation of political liberty, under the full control of the State (see, e.g.,\nMarkel and Flanders, 2010), we need to recognise that it does not describe modern\ncriminal justice, certainly not in contemporary England and Wales. This is particu-\nlarly the case in an era marked by a `dispersal of discipline', in which punishment is\nincreasingly inflicted alongside the subject's everyday life, and where it therefore\ninteracts with a wide range of social actors who might influence the experienced\npains of punishment (Cohen, 1985). We must recognise the impact that agents\nbeyond the penal State can have upon punishment's subjective experience, despite\nthe difficulties, because it is increasingly harder to separate out the penal from the\nwider social experience of the penal subject. If we are to meaningfully evaluate\npunishment, we must confront the institution as it is, and not as we would wish it to\nA further reason for taking some account of contextual pains is their very\ninaccessibility to sentencing authorities, and therefore to formal evaluations of\nexpected penal severity. By definition, contextual pains are insufficiently foresee-\nable to be accounted for accurately in determining likely penal severity. They\ncannot be `objectivised' in the way that oblique pains can, since it is much\nharder to accurately identify the factors that cause them, both in individual cases\nand in general. Thus, a sentencing authority seems compelled either to ignore these\nfactors (and the differences in impact they may cause), or to make rough estimates\nof their likely impact, at a cost to legal certainty.\nHowever, there is another option: penal policy, informed by social research, can\ntake greater account of contextual pains of punishment. Over time, policy-makers\ncould build up mechanisms for (a) recognising the factors that affect their inci-\ndence, such that they can be foreseen as virtual certainties (transforming contextual\npains into general or specific oblique pains); and (b) reforming guidelines for and\nconstraints of judicial decision-making, to recognise patterns in penal subjects'\nexperiences. Both approaches can play a role in providing a wider account of\nhow specific contextual pains affect the experienced severity of the penal subject's\nsentence, without fully surrendering the ability to separate punishment from its\nsurrounding contexts. A proximity-based account of penal severity can therefore\nassist in the development of a more socially accurate criminal justice system that is\nmore capable of doing justice in context.\nThe proximity model in penal policy and practice\nThis overview of the different levels of proximity of the pains of a given punishment\nto the penal State has been necessarily brief. It is not intended as a complete or even\npartial basis for public policy reform, but more as the first step towards setting a\nresearch (and policy) agenda. However, even this brief sketch enables us to identify\nsome implications for criminal justice policy and practice. In this final section, I\ntherefore explore different ways in which penal policy-makers and sentencing\nauthorities might utilise a proximity model to close the gap between what we\nthink we do as punishing communities, and what we actually do.\nBefore doing so, however, it is important to think about the different ways that a\nsystem might approach severity, penal moderation, and the impact of subjective\nexperience. In particular, one should avoid confusing normative attempts to pre-\nscribe how severe a prospective punishment should be with the evaluative, retro-\nspective analysis of how severe a particular punishment actually was (compare Duff\nand Green, 2011). At the prescriptive level, where sentencing decision-making\noccurs, any engagement with subjective experience must tread a very fine line.\nFirst, even allowing for modern improvements of social science's reach and\nscope, one can never predict the subjective experience of an individual subject.\nThe experience of any punishment is unique, coloured by the subject's context,\nattitudes, experiences, preconceptions, and surroundings during and after punish-\nment, including but by no means limited to the site/s of the punishment/s imposed\nSecond, using previous experience to construct guidance for prospective judge-\nments about an individual's prescribed experience of penal severity is inherently\nfraught with difficulty. Especially when information about subjective experience is\nalmost exclusively acquired through small-scale qualitative social research projects\nalisation. For instance, whilst it might be possible to say that the rich suffer a\ngreater reduction of their living standards in comparison to a poorer person\nthrough imprisonment, it does not follow that all wealthy penal subjects are\naffected equally as badly, or that we can precisely map levels on subjective suffering\nauthorities are to take the subjective experience of punishment into account\nwhen calculating penal severity, then they require highly tailored guidance that is\nas accurate as possible about how and to what extent specific circumstances are\nliable to increase or decrease the severity of the sentence.\nWithout wishing to downplay the difficulty of that task, it can at least be ame-\nliorated by the evaluative measurement of penal severity. By examining how\nseverely punishments have affected the lives of their subjects, one can build up a\npicture which is, if not predictive of future outcomes, at least capable of approx-\nimating it more closely, increasing the level of fidelity between legal norms and\nsocial experience. Doing so, however, requires an appreciation of the varying abil-\nity of different actors to identify pains in practice.\nWho can foresee indirect pains?\nDifferent State agents will necessarily have access to information about some pains\nbut not others. In particular, contextual pains are defined by the fact that they are\nmore or less unforeseeable at the point of sentence. Likewise, without access to\nspecific penal subjects' pre-sentence reports, penal policy-makers (such as the\nMinistry of Justice and Sentencing Council in England and Wales) cannot ade-\nquately foresee specific oblique pains. An overview of the differentiated foresee-\nability of pains at the sentencing and policy levels is laid out in Table 1.\nTable 1. Foreseeability of pains at the sentencing and policy levels\nAre pains foreseeable . . . . . . By sentencing authorities? . . . By policy-makers?\nDirect pains Yes Yes\nGeneral oblique pains Potentially (via policy guidance) Potentially (via research)\nSpecific oblique pains Yes (via Pre-Sentence Reports) No\nContextual pains No Potentially (via research)\nAny account of all categories within the proximity model, in other words,\nrequires dialogue between the sentencing and policy levels. Several implications\narise for both sets of decision-makers when using more proximity-based concep-\ntions of penal severity. These are discussed below.\nImplications for sentencing practice\nA proximity-based approach to penal severity need not mean any significant alter-\nation of the role of the judiciary. After all, subjectivism has always been a (limited)\nreality of Anglo-Welsh sentencing practice, due to the role played by judicial dis-\ncretion and pre-sentence reports (Nash, 2011). Rather, it would mean more formal\nrecognition of the existing role that these subjective factors play, the protection of\nsources of information about them, and a more structured approach to ensuring\nthat as full a range of pains as possible can be taken into account.\nIn particular, a proximity model would neither oppose nor support the existing\nAnglo-Welsh practice of using aggravating and mitigating factors in Sentencing\nCouncil guidelines to `fine-tune' a sentence after guilt has been determined.\nHowever, it is important to note that the present use of sentencing guidelines,\nand particularly of personally mitigating circumstances as they currently stand\n(Jacobson and Hough, 2011) can only partially contribute to this process.\nIn fact, the presently recognised range of personally mitigating factors does not\ndo much for the intersubjective gauging of penal severity. They provide classes of\ncontextual factors, leaving the judge with a wide discretion but little guidance as to\nhow much weight to accord to each. This can allow judges to recognise subjective\nguidance is still restricted to observations about classes of people, which, as dis-\ncussed above, is a crude measure of difference at best. Present systems of personal\nmitigation would at least need to be fine-tuned to deliver proximity-relevant mater-\nial, particularly as regards the weighting of individual factors.\nMoreover, the role of aggravation and mitigation in present sentencing guide-\nlines focuses heavily upon criminal acts, rather than convicts' circumstances.\nWhilst there are many factors that speak to the likely prospective impact of the\norder on the penal subject (and third parties), these must wait until after an initial\njudgement as to the factors that indicate the harm and culpability for the crime\nitself. It is only at this latter point, when the range of potential sentences has been\nmore or less decisively laid down (Padfield, 2011), that mitigation or aggravation\nbased on the penal subject's contexts can take place. This limits the ability of\npersonal mitigation to affect overall penal severity and places more emphasis on\nthe role of policy-makers in guiding judgements at the sentencing stage.\nIn short, personal mitigation is not enough by itself to serve as a vehicle for\nproximity-based severity judgements. Courts would need to take a more holistic\nperspective on sentencing, looking at the subject's conduct in comparison with\nthe pains that the sentence is likely to inflict on the specific individual in her\nunique contexts, insofar as the court is aware of them. Achieving this would not\nnecessarily require new tools but rather a different approach to how they are used\nin practice.\nAlthough that perceptual shift need not require considerable institutional\nreform, it would nevertheless profoundly affect sentencing practice. In particular,\none impact of adopting a proximity model of penal severity would be the realign-\nment of judicial attitudes towards alternative punishments to imprisonment. When\napproaching punishment as an abstract liberty deprivation, rather than a series of\nsubjective experiences or `pains of punishment', empirical evidence suggests that it\nis easier for judges to aggravate an onerous community penalty into a custodial\nsentence than to mitigate imprisonment into a non-custodial sentence (Hough\net al., 2003; Padfield, 2011). However, on a pains-based account, liberty depriv-\nation is only one potential source of punishment. Community-based punishments\nare not so much less punitive, therefore, but punitive in different ways, and suited to\ndifferent individuals as well as different offences. Recognising the pains of all types\nof punishments, and indeed the pains inherent in criminal conviction itself, would\nprovide one route towards improving the perceived legitimacy of non-custodial\nIt is important to remember that the capacity of social scientific advances in the\nretrospective recognition of contextual and oblique pains to assist predictive sen-\ntencing will always, inevitably, be partial. The objective of the proximity model at\nthe point of sentence cannot and should not therefore be to set up the judiciary as\nprophets, capable of accurately predicting social experiences. To do so would\ncreate a judicial interest in monitoring the precise level of pain experienced by\nthe penal subject, encouraging the State towards behaviour `dangerously approach-\ning sadism' (Markel and Flanders, 2010: 915). Instead, we should aim to close the\ngap between the predictions of penal severity that objectivised sentencing already\nmakes and the social reality experienced after sentence has been passed. To do so,\nhowever, requires access to retrospective information unavailable to sentencing\nauthorities. The involvement of penal policy-makers would thus be vital, both to\nguide sentencing decisions and to avoid increasingly punitive sentencing practice.\nImplications for penal policy\nWhilst the implications for sentencing practice are confined more to a change of\nperspective than of practices, the transition to a proximity-based account of penal\nseverity would imply a more significant shift at the level of penal policy. Since penal\npolicy-makers are able to access research findings on general oblique and context-\nual pains that sentencing authorities cannot consider, the proximity model would\nrequire them to engage with as wide a range of pains as possible, and build them\ninto existing laws, guidance, and judicial education in a way that enables judges to\npre-empt subjective experiences with greater (virtual) certainty.\nOverall, then, the task for penal policy would be to reform the law to better\nrecognise the impact punishments have when calculating penal severity; to commis-\nsion and engage with research to identify the circumstances in which particular\npains attend certain penal interventions, so that they can be incorporated into\njudicial decision-making as oblique pains of punishment; and to address the influ-\nence of external sources of contextual pains in determining penal severity.\nThis latter task, in particular, is one of deciding which contextual pains are\nunavoidable, and which can be minimised through wider policy interventions. It\nis one of deciding to what extent it is appropriate (and desirable) for communities\nand other external forces to partially determine the experienced severity of punish-\nment. Any recognition of punishment as a social phenomenon implies that the\nState must recognise at least some ability of wider social context to affect penal\nseverity, but beyond that, the precise level of recognition that contextual pains are\nan inevitable feature of punishment remains debatable.\nThis is, if nothing else, an opportunity for further research and refinement of the\nproximity model, which has, after all, been presented in a very broad-brush,\nabstract manner. Examining which factors affect subjective experience of pains in\ngeneral is a good start, but exploring the structuring impact of factors such as age,\nethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic class will help to refine and clarify how pain is\ncurrently distributed amongst penal subjects. This will allow us to identify the\ndistance between what is and what should be (at the level of policy, but also of\npolitical ethics) with more precision, providing targets for more specific and wide-\nranging policy (inside and out of the penal State) in future.\nHowever, it should be noted that concern with fine-tuning penal severity has not\nbeen at the top of the recent penal political-economic agenda of England and\nWales, which has been characterised for much of the last 40 years by a `law and\nally influencing current penal policy are therefore bleak, and one ought not to\nprematurely assume that the present shift away from explicit punitiveness towards\nmanagerialism in penal politics will make it any easier to encourage policy devel-\nopments in this direction.\nUnder these conditions, the researcher must be an advocate for policy consist-\nent with their work, by contributing to public discourses (and therefore, demo-\ncratic decision-making) through a robust, honest, and unbiased account of their\nfindings. In other words, the proximity model is not much use unless any aca-\ndemic proponents take seriously the public, and inherently political, nature of\nsocial research in democratic societies (Loader and Sparks, 2011; Noaks and\nConclusion: Proximity, pain, and the justice of punishment\nThe orthodox definition of punishment is a descriptively unsatisfactory account of\ncontemporary sentencing practice, forced by an historical and ongoing dilemma\nbetween objective clarity and expeditiousness, and subjective detail. It is possible to\nat least partially escape this dilemma by providing for at least some acceptance that\nthe severity of a punishment is constituted by its social experience, that is by the\nsubjective pains it actually engenders.\nWe can typify the relationship between pains in terms of their proximity to the\nformal State punishment imposed. They may be pains that are directly intended by\nthe sentencing authority; obliquely intended pains arising from either the general\nconsequences of conviction or punishment, or the specific known circumstances of\nthe penal subject; contextual pains that arise out of the multiple contexts of the\npunishment in question, which react to and intersect with the penal intervention; or\nwholly unrelated pains coincidental to penal processes. All but the latter have a part\nto play in measuring penal severity subjectively.\nThe proximity model is far from a perfect solution to the problem of doing\njust deserts in an unjust world, and whilst it is given here in a relatively broad\nand abstract form. Nevertheless, it provides a way of thinking about measuring\npenal severity that could increase the fidelity between the punishments that the\nState believes itself to be imposing in criminal sentences, and the pains actually\nexperienced as a result. Adopting such an approach would improve the accuracy\nof our measurement of penal severity, and so our ability to evaluate the extent\nto which criminal justice is done in practice. However, formal adoption of a\nproximity-based approach to sentencing would mean concerted shifts in both\nsentencing practice and penal policy, which will only be practicable through\nacademic contribution to public discourse. This, in turn, requires further aca-\ndemic research into the precise proximities of the pains of punishment to the\nimposing State.\n"
