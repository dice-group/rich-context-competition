This study examined whether psychological adjustment to widowhood is affected by three aspects of\nmarital quality--warmth, conflict, and instrumental dependence--assessed prior to the loss.\nMethods. The Changing Lives of Older Couples (CLOC) is a prospective study of a two-stage area probability sam-\nple of 1,532 married individuals aged 65 and older. The CLOC includes baseline data on marital quality and mental\nhealth and data on grief, anxiety, and depression collected 6, 18, and 48 months after spousal loss.\nResults. Widowhood was associated with elevated anxiety among those who were highly dependent on their spouses\nand lower levels of anxiety among those who were not dependent on their spouses. Levels of yearning were lower for\nwidowed persons whose relationships were conflicted at baseline and higher for those reporting high levels of marital\ncloseness and dependence on their spouses. Women who relied on their husbands for instrumental support had signifi-\ncantly higher levels of yearning than men who depended on their wives.\nDiscussion. The findings contradict the widespread belief that grief is more severe if the marriage was conflicted and\nsuggest a more complex relationship between bereavement and characteristics of the marriage.\nIDOWHOOD is characterized as one of the most dis-\ntressing of all life events (Holmes & Rahe, 1967).\nBecause the modern nuclear family is expected to be so-\ncially and economically autonomous, spouses may have few\nalternative sources of social, emotional, or instrumental sup-\nwhen a spouse dies, the survivor must not only adjust to the\nloss of a close relationship, but also manage the daily deci-\nsions and responsibilities that were once shared by both\n1992). In this study we examined whether psychological ad-\njustment to widowhood is affected by three dimensions of the\nmarital relationship (warmth\u00adcloseness, conflict, and instru-\nmental dependence, assessed at baseline) in a representative\ncommunity sample of widows and matched controls. Using\ndata from the Changing Lives of Older Couples (CLOC) sur-\nvey, we addressed three questions: (a) Does the effect of wid-\nowhood on depression and anxiety differ as a function of the\nquality of the marriage? (b) How does marital quality before\nspousal death influence grief? and (c) Do the effects observed\nunder (a) and (b) vary by gender?\nTheoretical Issues\nDespite widespread belief that widowhood is the most\nstressful of all life events (Holmes & Rahe, 1967), most\nstudies concur that only 15\u00ad30% experience clinically sig-\nnificant depression in the year following their spouse's\ndeath (Jacobs, Hansen, Berkman, Kasl, & Ostfeld, 1989;\nexplanations are generally offered for the inconsistent link\nbetween widowhood and adjustment. First, the mental health\neffects of widowhood attenuate over time, and studies that\nfocus on relatively long time horizons may underestimate\nthe short-term emotional consequences (Bruce, Kim, Leaf,\nson, Lovett, & Gilewski, 1990; Lund, Caserta, Dimond, &\nond, different aspects of mental health may follow different\nfocus only on a broad grief scale or a global measure of\nmental health, such as depression, may mask patterns among\nmore specific symptoms such as anxiety (Prigerson et al.,\noccupation with and pining for the deceased (Archer, 1999,\non three indicators of psychological well being: depression,\nanxiety, and yearning, assessed 6 months after the loss.\nA third explanation for the relatively weak relationship be-\ntween widowhood and psychological adjustment is that emo-\ntional responses to loss vary widely on the basis of personal\nresources, contextual factors, and personality. Personal re-\nsources such as education (Lopata, 1975), income (Arens,\nW\nport (Krause, 1986; Lepore, Silver, Wortman, & Wayment,\npression, anxiety, or grief. Contextual factors, such as the type\nor duration of illness experienced by spouse prior to death,\nmay also account for variation in widowed adults' psycholog-\nical adjustment (George & Gwyther, 1984; Norris & Murrell,\nfactors, such as an insecure attachment style or a tendency to\nruminate, also may make some particularly vulnerable to grief\n(Fraley & Shaver, 1999; Nolen-Hoeksema, Parker, & Larson,\nA fourth factor--the quality and nature of one's mar-\nriage--also may influence psychological reactions to wid-\nowhood. The loss of marriages providing the highest levels\nof warmth and support may be most distressing to survivors.\nThe link between relationship closeness and grief is a cen-\ntral theme of attachment theory (Bowlby, 1980). Attach-\nment theory holds that when a close emotional bond is sev-\nered--whether through death or separation--the grief process\nfollows (Bowlby, 1980). The grief process may involve\nfeelings of sorrow or sadness and anxiety, as well as yearn-\nBowlby's (1980) formulation of the grief process has two\nimportant implications for the study of adjustment to wid-\nowhood. First, the model suggests that all losses should not\nbe equally distressing; the dissolution of emotionally and\nsocially significant ties may elicit the strongest psychologi-\ncal reactions. A second implication of attachment theory is\nthat individuals display a series of diverse reactions to loss,\nincluding depression, anxiety (or \"active distress\"), or yearn-\ning for the deceased--an emotional reaction unique to loss.\nWe examined whether three emotional responses to spousal\ndeath (depression, anxiety, and yearning) were influenced\nby three aspects of the marital relationship (closeness, con-\nflict, and instrumental dependence).\nMarital Quality and Bereavement\nThe proposition that relationship quality is linked to dif-\nferent grief reactions can be traced back to psychoanalytic\ntheory. Psychoanalytic theories of grief hold that the loss of\na conflicted relationship is associated with prolonged or\n1959). Survivors who had ambivalent or difficult relation-\nships with their spouses are believed to have both anger to-\nward and a strong attachment to the deceased. These con-\nflicting feelings make it difficult for survivors to let go of\ntheir lost loved one, yet survivors simultaneously are angry\nThis argument is supported by Parkes and Weiss (1983),\nwho obtained retrospective assessments of marital quality\namong a sample of bereaved adults. Widowed persons who\nreported high levels of marital conflict showed relatively lit-\ntle distress and higher levels of social participation 6 weeks\nafter their spouse's death. Yet by 13 months after the death,\nthose reporting highly conflicted marriages were signifi-\ncantly less likely to have returned to effective functioning\nand after 24\u00ad48 months had higher levels of anxiety, guilt,\nand depression than did the low-conflict group.\nAn important methodological issue weakens the conclu-\nsion of Parkes and Weiss (1983), however. Retrospective\nassessments of marital relationships were obtained after the\nspouse died and thus may be biased positively (Futterman et\npersons often display a bias toward selective positive recall\nwhen describing their deceased spouses and may \"purify\"\nthe memory of the deceased (Lopata, 1973; Parkes &\nWeiss, 1983). Conversely, those who are most depressed af-\nter the loss may offer the most negative retrospective ac-\ncounts of their marriages (Bonanno, Notarius, Gunzerath,\nKeltner, & Horowitz, 1998). Depressed individuals evaluate\nthemselves and their relationships more negatively than do\nnondepressed persons (Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale,\nlikely to recall negative information about past experiences\nAn important longitudinal study of life transitions poses\nan alternative to the psychoanalytic theory of prolonged grief:\nWheaton (1990) countered that exiting a stressful role may\nenhance well-being. Although traditional theories of stress\nposit that all life transitions (such as spousal deaths or job\nlosses) are stressful (Holmes & Rahe, 1967), Wheaton\n(1990) argued that the impact of an event varies according\nto the context in which the transition occurs. Specifically, in\nWheaton's (1990) analysis, bereaved spouses who reported\nmarital problems at a baseline interview went on to experi-\nence significantly lower levels of distress at follow-up,\ncompared with those reporting fewer marital problems. We\nhave built upon the work of Wheaton (1990) in two ways;\nwe had a larger sample of widowed adults and considered\nthree distinct aspects of the marital relationship: closeness,\nconflict, and instrumental dependence (i.e., reliance on\none's spouse for performing daily tasks). Although the loss\nof warm, nonconflictual relationships may be linked to ele-\nvated grief and depression, the loss of a marriage providing\nhigh levels of instrumental support may be linked to ele-\nvated anxiety among widowed persons. If families are ar-\nranged so that one's spouse is the primary--or only--help-\nmate, then the loss of this source of instrumental support\nmay be distressing (Lopata, 1973; Volkart & Michael,\n1957). Drawing from the research and theory discussed thus\nfar, we proposed the following hypothesis regarding the\nmental health of widowed persons and matched controls:\nH1: The effect of widowhood on both depression and\nanxiety will increase as levels of marital warmth and\ninstrumental dependence increase and will decrease\nas levels of marital conflict increase. That is, the psy-\nchological toll of widowhood will be most severe for\nthose who experienced low levels of conflict, high\nlevels of warmth, and high levels of instrumental de-\npendence in their marriages at baseline.\nWe posited the following hypothesis regarding variation in\nyearning, a core component of grief, among a sample of\nwidowed persons only:\nH2: Yearning (at 6-month follow-up) will be nega-\ntively associated with conflict and positively associ-\nated with warmth\u00adcloseness and instrumental depen-\ndence (at baseline).\nWe also explored whether these patterns differ for hus-\nbands and wives. The protective effects of marriage are\nstronger for men than for women (see Waite, 1995, for a re-\nview). Wives are more likely than husbands to have alter-\nnate sources of emotional and social support (Antonucci,\nStroebe, & Schut 1997). Women also provide more emo-\ntional support to their spouses than do men (Gove, 1973;\nLee, 1988). Men who are in particularly warm and loving\nrelationships may be more inclined to depend exclusively\non their spouses for support, whereas men in conflicted rela-\ntionships may be forced to seek other sources of emotional\nintimacy and social support. Thus, high levels of closeness\nand low levels of conflict may be stronger predictors of\npoor adjustment among widowers than among widows.\nInstrumental dependence might also have different ef-\nfects on widows' and widowers' adjustment. In current co-\nhorts of older adults, men receive substantially more instru-\nmental advantages from marriage than do women, generally\nin the form of household tasks (Hartman, 1981; Miller &\nGarrison, 1982). After his wife dies, a widower may be par-\nticularly ill equipped to handle the daily tasks of maintain-\ning a household (Berardo, 1970). Yet widowers also have\ntwo distinct advantages not typically available to widows:\ngreater economic resources and a larger pool of potential\nspousal replacements (Lopata, 1973). Over the life course,\nmen earn substantially more than women and thus may have\nthe resources to purchase homemaking services (see Bian-\nchi, 1995, for a review). Moreover, because of men's mor-\ntality disadvantage, women aged 65 and older outnumber\nmen aged 65 and older by roughly 1.5 to 1 (U.S. Bureau of\nthe Census, 1996). Widowers may easily find companions\nto assist with the household tasks previously performed by\ntheir wives (Bengston, Rosenthal, & Burton, 1990). Thus,\nwe hypothesized that:\nH3: Marital warmth\u00adcloseness will be a stronger pos-\nitive predictor of yearning, anxiety, and depression\namong men (relative to women).\nH4: Conflict will be a stronger negative predictor of\nyearning, anxiety, and depression among men (rela-\ntive to women).\nH5A: Instrumental dependence for male-typed tasks\nwill be a stronger positive predictor of yearning, anx-\niety, and depression among women (relative to men).\nH5B: Instrumental dependence for female-typed tasks\nwill be a stronger positive predictor of yearning, anx-\niety, and depression among men (relative to women).\nOther Influences on Marital Quality and Adjustment to\nSpousal Loss\nOur analysis included indicators of three other potential\ninfluences on bereavement. First, we controlled mental health\nprior to loss to help distinguish one's affective state before\nthe death and change in affective state that occurred follow-\nthough most studies have examined prior depression as the\nsole indicator of prior mental health, we also considered\nanxiety at baseline. Second, the extent to which a presumed\nstressor, such as widowhood, affects the individual is linked\nto his or her other resources and vulnerabilities. Consequently,\nwe included controls for socioeconomic status (education,\nincome, and home ownership) at baseline. Finally, we con-\ntrolled both spouse's and respondent's physical health at base-\nline, because physical health may influence marital quality\nat baseline and mental health at 6-month follow-up (Booth\nMETHODS\nSample\nThe Changing Lives of Older Couples (CLOC) study is a\nprospective study of a two-stage area probability sample of\n1,532 married individuals from the Detroit Standard Metro-\npolitan Statistical Area (SMSA). To be eligible for the\nstudy, respondents had to be English-speaking members of\na married couple in which the husband was aged 65 or\nolder. All sample members were not institutionalized and\nwere capable of participating in a 2-hour interview. Approx-\nimately 65% of those contacted for an interview partici-\npated, which is consistent with the response rate from other\nDetroit area studies. Baseline face-to-face interviews were\nCLOC researchers monitored spousal loss by reading the\ndaily obituaries in three Detroit-area newspapers and by us-\ning monthly death record tapes provided by the State of\nMichigan. The National Death Index (NDI) was used to\nconfirm deaths and obtain causes of death. Of the 319 re-\nspondents who lost a spouse during the study, 86% (n \n276) participated in at least one of the three follow-up inter-\nviews, which were conducted 6 months (Wave 1), 18\nmonths (Wave 2), and 48 months (Wave 3) after the death.\nThe primary reasons for nonresponse were refusal to partic-\nipate (38%) and ill health or death at follow-up (42%). Con-\ntrols from the original sample of 1,545 were selected to\nmatch the widowed persons along the dimensions of age,\nrace, and sex. The matched controls were reinterviewed at\nthe three follow-up interviews at roughly the same time as\ntheir corresponding widowed persons.\nWe used two analytic samples in this study. The first in-\nterviewed at the 6-month follow-up and comprised 203 wid-\nowed persons and 87 matched controls. (Controls were not\navailable for all bereaved subjects at the 6-month follow-up\nbecause funding for the control sample was cut from the\nproposed budget and was reinstated halfway through the\ndata collection for the 6-month follow-up). The second sam-\nwomen) interviewed at the 6-month followup, or roughly\nMeasures\nDependent variables.--In the first part of the analysis,\nwhich contrasted the widowed and matched controls, we fo-\ncused on two dimensions of mental health at the 6-month\nfollow-up: depression and anxiety. Depression (  .83)\nwas assessed with a subset of 9 negative items from the 20-\nitem Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D)\nscale (Radloff, 1977). Respondents were asked to indicate\nhow often they experienced each of nine symptoms in the\nweek prior to interview. Response categories were \"hardly\never,\" \"some of the time,\" or \"most of the time.\" The nine\nsymptoms were (a) \"I felt depressed\"; (b) \"I felt that every-\nthing I did was an effort\"; (c) \"My sleep was restless\"; (d) \"I\nfelt lonely\"; (e) \"People were unfriendly\"; (f) \"I did not feel\nlike eating. My appetite was poor\"; (g) \"I felt sad\"; (h) \"I felt\nthat people disliked me\"; and (i) \"I could not `get going.'\"\nAnxiety (  .86) was assessed with 10 items from the\nRespondents were asked to indicate how often they experi-\nenced each of 10 symptoms in the week prior to interview.\nResponse categories were \"not at all,\" \"a little bit,\" \"moder-\nately,\" \"quite a bit,\" and \"extremely.\" Symptoms included\n(a) \"nervousness or shakiness\"; (b) \"trembling\"; (c) \"feeling\nsuddenly scared for no reason\"; (d) \"feeling fearful\"; (e)\n\"heart pounding or racing\"; (f) \"feeling tense and keyed\nup\"; (g) \"spells of terror and panic\"; (h) \"feeling so restless\nyou couldn't sit still\"; (i) \"feeling that something bad is go-\ning to happen to you\"; and (j) \"thoughts and images of a\nfrightening nature.\" For ease of interpretation, depression\nand anxiety scores were standardized and thus had a mean\nof 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\nIn the second part of the analysis we focused on widowed\npersons only and examined the correlates of yearning, con-\nsidered a \"core\" symptom of grief (Bowlby, 1980; Parkes,\n1985). Attachment theory holds that the essential dimension\nof grief that distinguishes bereavement from other forms of\nemotional distress is the act of pining for the lost person.\nYearning reflects an intermittent, recurrent, and obtrusive\nwish or need to recover the person who has died. Yearning\n(  .75) was assessed with four questions: \"In the last\nmonth (a) have you found yourself longing to have your\nspouse with you; (b) have you had painful waves of missing\nyour spouse; (c) have you experienced feelings of intense\npain or grief over the loss of your spouse; and (d) have you\nexperienced feelings of grief, loneliness, or missing your\nspouse?\" Response categories were \"no, never\"; \"yes, but\nrarely\"; \"yes, sometimes\"; and \"yes, often.\" Items were\ndrawn from widely used grief scales including the Bereave-\nment Index (Jacobs, Kasl, & Ostfeld, 1986), Present Feel-\nings About Loss (Singh & Raphael, 1981), and Texas Re-\nvised Inventory of Grief (Zisook, DeVaul, & Click, 1982).\nIndependent variables.--Widowhood was a dummy vari-\nable set equal to 1 indicating those who were widowed be-\ntween the baseline interview and the 6-month follow-up.\nThree dimensions of the marital relationship were consid-\nered: warmth\u00adcloseness, instrumental dependence (for both\nmale- and female-typed tasks), and conflict. These three di-\nmensions were chosen because they capture two of the most\nimportant functions of marriage for older adults: intimacy\nand interdependence (Atchley, 1985). A fourth dimension,\nemotional dependence, was considered, but it was not sig-\nnificantly related to psychological adjustment in the multi-\nvariate analysis and was thus dropped from the study.\nQuestions assessing each of the marital domains were\ndrawn from a modified version of the Dyadic Adjustment\nScale (Spanier, 1976). Respondents were asked to assess the\nfrequency with which they experienced a given condition\n(response categories were \"almost always,\" \"often,\" some-\ntimes,\" \"rarely,\" and \"never\") or how true a given statement\nwas in characterizing their marital relationship (response\ncategories were \"very true,\" \"somewhat true,\" \"a little true,\"\nand \"not at all true\"). Total scores equalled the scale-spe-\ncific average (standardized) across items. Italicized items\n(see next paragraph) were reverse-coded.\nWarmth\u00adcloseness (  .88) was assessed with a seven-\nitem scale with the following questions: (a) \"How much\ndoes your spouse make you feel loved and cared for\"; (b)\n\"How much is your spouse willing to listen when you need\nto talk about your worries and problems?\"; (c) \"There are\nsome serious difficulties in our marriage\"; (d) \"Thinking\nabout your marriage as a whole, how often do you feel\nhappy about it?\"; (e) \"Taking all things together, how satis-\nfied are you with your marriage?\"; (f) \"How often do you\nfeel bothered or upset by your marriage?\"; (g) \"My spouse\ndoesn't treat me as well as I deserve to be treated.\"\nConflict (alpha  .64) was assessed with a two-item scale\ncomprising the items (a) \"How often would you say you and\nyour spouse typically have unpleasant disagreements and\nconflicts?\" and (b) \"In some marriages there are times when\nyou feel very close, but other times when you can get more\nupset with that person than with anyone else. How much\ndoes this sound like the relationship you have with your\nspouse?\"\nInstrumental dependence was measured with the follow-\ning questions. \"Husbands and wives often depend on one\nanother to handle different responsibilities. At the present\ntime, how much do you depend on your spouse to handle or\nhelp with: (a) home maintenance and minor repairs; (b)\nkeeping up with checking and savings accounts and paying\nbills; (c) making major financial and legal decisions; and (d)\npreparing meals and doing general housework and laundry.\"\nResponse categories were \"a lot,\" \"some,\" \"a little,\" and\n\"not at all.\" Factor analyses yielded one three-item subscale\n(  .54), which tapped male-typed tasks (Items 1\u00ad3), and a\nsingle-item measure that tapped female-typed tasks (Item 4).\nConfounding factors.--Spousal health at baseline was\nassessed with the question \"Has your [spouse] had a serious\nillness, injury, surgery, or accident in the past 12 months?\"\nDepression and anxiety at baseline were measured exactly\nthe same way as the 6-month follow-up measures (Deroga-\nhealth at baseline was assessed with the question \"How sat-\nisfied are you with your health?\" Responses were \"com-\npletely satisfied,\" \"very satisfied,\" \"somewhat satisfied,\" \"not\nvery satisfied,\" and \"not at all satisfied.\" A dummy variable\nwas set equal to 1 for those who said they were \"not very\nsatisfied\" or \"not at all satisfied\" with their health.\nOther potential predictors of psychological adjustment to\nloss, including race, marital duration, social support from\nfriends, social support from relatives, religiosity, self-esteem,\nand provision of care to spouse prior to death, were included\nin preliminary analyses but were dropped because they were\nnot significant predictors of the psychological adjustment ( p \n.05) and because inclusion of these variables did not alter\nthe effects of marital quality on psychological adjustment.\nControl variables.--Control variables included: age, sex\n(where 1  \"female\"), home ownership at baseline (a di-\nchotomous variable where 1  \"owns home\"), total house-\nhold income at baseline (natural log of income), and educa-\ntion (a continuous measure ranging from 3 to 17 years of\ncompleted schooling). The total household income variable\nwas originally measured by asking respondents to indicate\nwhich of 10 income categories most accurately character-\nized their economic status. A continuous measure of income\nwas derived by taking the midpoint of each of the 10 in-\ncome categories. The natural log of income was used in this\nanalysis because the respondents' income distribution was\nheavily skewed toward the lower income categories.\nRESULTS\nSample Characteristics\nDescriptive statistics and t tests comparing means for the\nwidowed and matched controls are presented in Table 1.\nZero-order correlations among the dependent variables, mari-\ntal quality indicators, and baseline mental health measures\nare displayed in Table 2. Table 1 shows that widowed per-\nsons had significantly higher depression levels at the 6-month\nfollow-up, yet they did not differ from matched controls in\nterms of anxiety. The spouses of widowed persons were sig-\nnificantly more likely to have had a serious illness at base-\nline, and widowed persons reported significantly lower levels\nof dependence on their spouses for male- and female-typed\ninstrumental tasks at baseline. Widowed persons and con-\ntrols did not differ significantly in terms of marital warmth\nor conflict. The widowed also had slightly lower incomes\nand were less likely to own their own homes. These differ-\nences likely reflect effects of the spouse's declining health\nbefore death.\nThe zero-order correlations displayed in Table 2 were\nlargely as expected. Depression and anxiety were positively\nand significantly correlated, although this relationship was\nstronger at the 6-month follow-up (.626) than at baseline\n(.477). Among the marital quality indicators, conflict and\nwarmth were strongly and negatively correlated (.587),\nalthough conflict was not significantly related to instrumen-\ntal dependence. Baseline depression and anxiety were sig-\nnificantly correlated with only two dimensions of baseline\nmarital quality: warmth and conflict. Yearning at the 6-month\nfollow-up was significantly correlated with concurrent de-\npression (.492) and anxiety (.238), yet these values suggest\nthat the three dimensions of mental health are conceptually\nand statistically distinct.\nInfluence of Marital Quality on Mental Health of the\nWidowed and Nonwidowed\nOur main objective in this analysis was to explore\nwhether the mental health consequences of widowhood\n(i.e., depression and anxiety at a 6-month follow-up) were\nrelated to marital quality, assessed at baseline. Table 3 pre-\nsents ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models for the\ntotal sample (i.e., both widows and matched controls).\nModel 1 showed the effect of widowhood on depression,\nand Model 2 estimated the effect of widowhood on anxiety,\nbefore controlling marital quality. Models 1 and 2 revealed\nthat widowhood was associated with poorer psychological\nwell being (net of demographic and contextual factors). Be-\nfore marital quality was controlled, widowhood was associ-\nated with a .729 standard deviation increase in depression\nand a .116 standard deviation increase in anxiety scores.\nThe effect of widowhood on depression did not change ap-\npreciably after marital quality variables were added to the\nmodel as moderators. However, the effect of widowhood on\nanxiety was no longer significant when instrumental depen-\ndence was incorporated into the analysis, suggesting that the\nanxiety may be due to the loss of practical assistance with\ndaily demands.\nWe then expanded each model to include two-way inter-\nactions between widowhood status and each of the marital\nquality indicators. A significant interaction term suggests\nthat the consequences of widowhood vary on the basis of\nTable 1.

Of the eight two-way interaction terms, only\none was statistically significant at the p  .05 level: Instru-\nmental dependence for male-typed tasks moderated the ef-\nfect of widowhood on anxiety (see Model 3). We added a\nthree-way interaction term to Model 3 to assess whether the\nwidowhood status by instrumental dependence effect dif-\nfered for men and women; the three-way interaction was not\nstatistically significant at the p  .05 level. The statistically\nsignificant interaction effect (net of independent variables\npresented in Table 3, with all independent variables set\nequal to sample mean) is plotted in Figure 1.\nModel 3 and Figure 1 show that widowhood was associ-\nated with higher levels of anxiety among those who re-\nported average or higher levels of dependence on their\nspouse for performing male-typed instrumental tasks. Wid-\nowhood was actually associated with slightly lower levels\nof anxiety (compared with controls) among those who had\nlow levels of dependence on their spouse at baseline.\nInfluence of Marital Quality on Bereavement\nNext, we assessed whether yearning for one's spouse (at\nthe 6-month follow-up) was affected by the quality of one's\nmarriage, assessed at baseline. Table 4 presents OLS regres-\nsion models estimating the effects of marital quality on wid-\nowed persons' yearning. Model 1 was the baseline model,\nwhich included demographic, health, and control variables\nTable 2.

Model 2 incorporated mar-\nital warmth\u00adcloseness; Model 3 adjusted for marital con-\nflict; Model 4 assessed the influence of instrumental depen-\ndence, and Model 5 included the baseline model plus all\nmarital quality indicators. Marital quality played an impor-\ntant role in explaining variability in widowed persons'\nyearning. Although Model 1 accounted for only 3% of the\nvariance in yearning, the inclusion of individual marital\nquality items increased the adjusted R2 to anywhere from 6\nto 8%, depending on the specific marital domain. The final\nmodel, which included the three measures of marital qual-\nity, explained 12% of the variance in yearning.\nAs hypothesized, adjustment to widowhood was most\ndifficult for those who experienced the highest levels of\nemotional warmth and instrumental dependence in their\nmarriages. Each standard deviation increase in warmth\u00ad\ncloseness was associated with a .28 standard deviation in-\ncrease in levels of widowed persons' yearning (p  .001).\nThose who suffered conflicted marriages evidenced lower\nlevels of yearning; each standard deviation increase in the\nlevel of conflict in one's marriage decreased yearning levels\nby .17 standard deviation units (p  .01). To assess the\nclaim that the loss of a conflicted relationship is associated\nModel 3 for yearning at Wave 2 (18-month follow-up) and\nWave 3 (48-month follow-up). In these additional models\n(data not shown), the effects of baseline marital conflict on\nWave 2 and Wave 3 yearning were virtually identical to the\neffects found for Wave 1 yearning, suggesting that those in\nconflicted marriages did not experience delayed yearning;\nrather, they experienced better adjustment in both the long\nand the short term following widowhood.\nInterestingly, dependence on one's spouse for performing\nmale-typed tasks increased yearning significantly ( \n.270, p  .01), yet reliance on one's spouse for performing\nfemale-typed tasks was not significantly linked to yearning.\nHowever, as might be expected, this pattern varied by gen-\nder. Model 4 was expanded to include interaction terms for\nboth types of instrumental dependence by sex; the model\nthat dependence on one's spouse for performing male-typed\ntasks influenced yearning differently for men and women.\nEach standard deviation increase in instrumental depen-\ndence for male-typed tasks was associated with a .214 de-\ncrease in men's yearning but a .385 increase in women's\nyearning. The interaction term (net of all other independent\nvariables, with values of all independent variables set equal\nto sample mean) is plotted in Figure 2. None of the other\nmarital quality indicators interacted significantly with sex.\nTable 4.

Yearning (Wave 1) by gender and instrumental depen-\ndence for male-typed tasks. Note: All other independent variables\ncontrolled.\nWe estimated a final model (Model 5) to assess the ef-\nfects of the four marital quality indicators simultaneously.\nAlthough the coefficients and levels of statistical signifi-\ncance declined somewhat when all four marital quality indi-\ncators were controlled, the results nonetheless revealed im-\nportant linkages between marital quality and yearning. The\neffects of warmth and conflict each declined by 40 and\n30%, respectively, whereas the effect of dependence on\nspouse for male-typed tasks decreased by 8%. However,\ngiven the relatively small sample size (n  203) and a\nstrong correlation between warmth and conflict (r  .587;\nsee Table 2), it is notable that the instrumental dependence\n(for male-typed tasks) indicator was still significant at the p \n.01 level, and the warmth and conflict indicators ap-\nproached statistical significance (p  .10). The strength of\nthese findings is noteworthy, given that potential sources of\nmarital conflict and closeness, including spousal health, so-\ncioeconomic indicators, and baseline indicators of negative\naffect (i.e., anxiety and depression levels), were controlled.\nFew other variables were significant predictors of yearn-\ning. Anxiety at baseline was associated with elevated levels\nof yearning at the 6-month follow-up, although baseline de-\npression was unrelated to Wave 1 yearning. Interestingly,\ngreater economic resources at baseline were positively asso-\nciated with yearning. Those who owned their own home at\nbaseline had significantly higher levels of yearning. Perhaps\nthose who did not own a home experienced greater levels of\nsocial integration with neighbors in an apartment complex\nor retirement community. It is unlikely that homeowners at\nbaseline experienced the loss of their home or relocation\nfollowing their spouse's death; only 5% of homeowners at\nbaseline were no longer homeowners at Wave 1. Moreover,\nhousehold income at baseline was positively associated\nwith yearning. This finding is surprising given the vast\namount of research documenting an inverse relationship be-\ntween socioeconomic status and diverse indicators of nega-\ntive mental health (Dohrenwend, Levav, & Shrout, 1992). It\nis possible that those with the lowest income at baseline ex-\nperienced the smallest relative declines in their standard of\nliving following the loss of their spouse (see Holden &\nSmock, 1991, for a review), and thus may not have had to\ncope with the combined loss of both spouse and economic\nstatus simultaneously.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study we expanded upon prior research in four\nways. First, we used prospective data to examine the effects\nof marital quality (at baseline) on mental health at a 6-month\nfollow-up; thus, assessments of marital quality were not af-\nrecall bias. Second, we considered three conceptually and\nstatistically distinct aspects of the marital relationship:\ncloseness, conflict, and instrumental dependence. Third, we\nfocused on both men and women and assessed whether the\nlink between marital quality and psychological adjustment\ndiffered significantly for the two sexes. Finally, we included\nwidowed persons and a control group to address an impor-\ntant issue previously neglected in studies of widowhood:\nDoes the effect of widowhood on psychological adjustment\nvary on the basis of the nature of the marital relationship?\nWe found that widowhood is a significant predictor of\ndepression and that this large and significant effect does not\ndecline when marital quality indicators are incorporated\ninto the analysis. In contrast, the effect of widowhood on\nanxiety is no longer statistically significant when levels of\ninstrumental dependence are considered. This finding high-\nlights the importance of considering the unique pathways\nthrough which loss influences both \"passive depression\"\nand \"active distress.\" Although the loss of one's partner, re-\ngardless of relationship quality, may be associated with ele-\nvated sadness and depression, anxiety may instead be a re-\naction to the loss of a partner when accompanied by major\nchanges in daily responsibilities and burdens.\nOur analyses showed that the effect of widowhood on\nanxiety levels varies by how much one depended on one's\nspouse for performing male-typed tasks, such as home re-\npair and financial management. Compared with the married\ncontrols, widowed persons who reported high levels of de-\npendence on their spouse had significantly higher levels of\nanxiety at follow-up. This is not surprising; those who were\nnot dependent on their spouses presumably are better able to\ncare for themselves and maintain their households success-\nfully following the loss of their spouse. In contrast, among\nmarried controls, lack of dependence on one's spouse may\nsignify an uncooperative marriage. Because spouse's health\nat baseline is controlled, low levels of dependence on one's\nspouse are not attributable to poor spousal health.\nYearning, considered a core component of grief, is signif-\nicantly and strongly affected by marital quality. Consistent\nwith attachment theory (Bowlby, 1980), our findings sug-\ngest that all losses are not equal; adjustment to widowhood\nis most difficult for those experiencing high levels of\nwarmth and instrumental dependence and low levels of con-\nflict in their marriages. Our findings support Wheaton's\n(1990) assertion that role histories must be considered when\nresearchers are examining life transitions. Although classic\nstudies of stressful life events implicitly assume that all life\nevents can overtax individuals' coping resources and leave\nthem emotionally vulnerable (Holmes & Rahe, 1967), our\nfindings suggest that the impact of a stressor depends on the\ncontext surrounding the event.\nAlthough studies of divorce demonstrate that those exit-\ning troubled marriages are less susceptible to depression\nknow of no other prospective studies linking marital con-\nflict to adjustment following widowhood. Moreover, pre-\nliminary analyses of the CLOC follow-up data reveal that\nthis relationship holds when yearning is assessed at 18 and\n48 months following the loss. Our findings do not support\ntionship leads to delayed grief. However, our analyses did\nnot focus on extreme levels of grief, nor on long-term hori-\nzons (beyond 4 years); further analyses are needed to under-\nstand linkages between marital conflict and delayed grief.\nAlthough we expected to find that conflict and closeness\nwould have larger effects on men's adjustment, given that\nmarriage has greater protective effects for men (Waite,\n1995), we instead found no significant gender difference.\nWe found support for our hypothesis that dependence on a\nspouse for male-typed tasks would be a stronger predictor\nof anxiety for women, although we did not find dependence\non one's spouse for female-typed tasks to affect widows and\nwidowers differently. In fact, dependence on one's spouse\nfor performing homemaking tasks was not a significant pre-\ndictor of yearning.\nThese findings tell an interesting story about gender, de-\npendence, and socialization in current cohorts of older\nadults. Current cohorts of older widowers may not need the\nsame amount of informal support as do widows, because of\nearly socialization experiences (Stevens, 1995). The devel-\nopment of personal attributes such as independence and\nself-reliance may have been imbued in young men, but not\nyoung women, of the CLOC cohort. Future generations of\nolder women, who have higher levels of education, more\nyears of work experience, and more egalitarian divisions of\nlabor in their families (Bianchi, 1995), may be less suscepti-\nble to dependence on their husbands for home repair and fi-\nnancial management tasks. Under such a scenario, gender\ndifferences in widows' and widowers' anxiety levels might\nbe expected to decline among future cohorts of elderly.\nYet, at the same time, our findings suggest that adapta-\ntion to spousal loss may become more difficult in future co-\nhorts. The members of the CLOC sample belong to a cohort\nwho experienced relatively low levels of divorce and sepa-\nration, given both the social stigma accompanying divorce\nand the dearth of opportunities for women to provide for\nthemselves economically in earlier decades (Cherlin, 1981;\nHolden & Smock, 1991). Thus, men and women of this co-\nhort may have remained in marriages that provided rela-\ntively low levels of warmth and relatively high levels of\nconflict. If current cohorts of married couples are more\nlikely to dissolve dissatisfying marriages, then those who\nremain married until late life may have higher levels of mar-\nital satisfaction and thus may suffer more following the loss\nof these close relationships.\nFuture research on the linkages between marital quality\nand adjustment to loss should consider whether both spouses\nshare similar assessments of the marriage at baseline and\nwhether psychological adjustment to loss differs on the ba-\nsis of whose report of the marriage is being considered. Pre-\nliminary analyses of the CLOC data reveal quite low corre-\nlations between respondents' and spouses' assessments of\nmarital quality (most are less than .3), with the exception of\nmarital conflict. Spouses' assessments of marital conflict are\nhighly correlated (.473), and (the deceased) spouses' base-\nline reports of marital conflict are a significant negative pre-\ndictor of their survivors' adjustment to loss. In contrast, sur-\nvivors' psychological adjustment is not affected by their\nspouses' reports of dependence or warmth, suggesting that\nit is a person's own perceptions and feelings about his or her\nspouse that are related to bereavement.\nOur findings are potentially important to the sociological\nstudy of life transitions. If all life transitions--especially\nhighly anticipated ones such as widowhood in old age--are\nviewed as distressing (e.g., Holmes & Rahe, 1967), then\nrigid normative expectations for the expression of emotion\nmay be imposed on the individual (Averill, 1968). Wid-\nowed persons' failure to comply with normative expres-\nsions of grief, such as yearning for a deceased spouse, are\nsocially (and subtly) sanctioned: A denial of grief may \"en-\ntail a rejection of the original assumption that the relation-\nship was meaningful and close. The other alternative would\nbe to consider the lack of response as a sign of actual or po-\none's role history prior to spousal death, variations in be-\nreavement may be better understood.\nOur findings also have important implications for practi-\ntioners. Our data help identify a population at particularly\nhigh risk for anxiety--wives who were highly dependent on\ntheir spouses for performing instrumental tasks. The provi-\nsion of instrumental assistance and practical support with\ndaily activities and chores may help to alleviate their anxi-\nety. Our results further suggest that not all bereaved persons\nexperience similar levels of depression, anxiety, and yearn-\ning following the loss of a spouse. To the contrary, psycho-\nlogical adjustment to widowhood varies considerably on the\nbasis of the nature of one's marriage. Because the grief pro-\ncess varies in timing, intensity, and difficulty from one per-\nson to the next, what helps one person cope with grief may\nnot be helpful to another. Thus, interventions should be tai-\nlored to the bereaved person's circumstances and needs.\n"
