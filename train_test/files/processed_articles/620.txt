Subjects were all those 7260\navailable. These subjects were followed through to 1990.\nMEASUREMENTS: Measurements included self-reported height and weight, date of death if subjects died, sex, age,\nrace, measures of socio-economic status, number of living \u00aerst degree relatives, and responses to questions asking\nwhether the subject had retired due to poor health, had dif\u00aeculty eating, worried about their health, and felt their\nhealth was worse than during the prior year. Smoking status was not assessed.\nRESULTS: When analyzed via Cox proportional hazard regression, the relationship between BMI and mortality,\nrepresented by means of hazard ratio, was clearly U-shaped for both men and women. The base of the curves was\nfairly wide suggesting that a broad range of BMIs are well tolerated by older adults. The minimum mortality\n(estimated from the \u00aetted proportional hazard models) occurred at a BMI of approximately 31.7 for women and 28.8\nfor men. The results were essentially unchanged, if analyses were weighted, if various disease states were controlled\nfor, and if apparently unhealthy subjects were excluded.\nCONCLUSIONS: The \u00aending of the relatively high BMI (27\u00b130 for men, 30\u00b135 for women) associated with minimum\nhazard in persons older than seventy years supports some previously documented \u00aendings1 and opposes others2 and,\nif con\u00aermed in future research, has implications for public health and clinical recommendations.\nKeywords: body mass index (BMI); obesity; mortality; elderly; aged; Cox proportional hazard regression.\nIntroduction\nIn 1985 Andres1 published a re-analysis of the Metro-\npolitan Life Insurance Company data suggesting that\nthe relationship between mortality and body mass\nindex (BMI; kgam2) appeared to be U-shaped, the\nBMI associated with minimum mortality appeared to\nincrease with age throughout adulthood, and the\noptimal BMIs for older people were higher than\nconventionally believed. Since then, each of these\nissues has generated some controversy and debate.\nOne small scale (n  758) longitudinal study of\nelderly subjects3 failed to observe any elevation in\nmortality risk with increasing BMIs but most long-\nitudinal studies have con\u00aermed the U-shaped\nBMIamortality relationship in older men and\nwomen.4\u00b18 At least one widely cited study,2 that of\nthe Seventh Day Adventists, found a monotonic\nincreasing relation between mortality and BMI and\nno increase in optimal BMIs with age. However,\na recent reanalysis9 strongly questions the conclu-\nsions of the Adventist Study. The BMIs associated\nwith minimum mortality have generally been high4\nin studies of older people, typically ranging from\npeople, among whom optimal BMIs are generally\nthought to be in the range of about 20\u00b125. Finally, a\nstudy involving in-hospital mortality found that mini-\nmum mortality occurred in BMIs ranging from\nThis \u00aenal study is quite interesting but probably\nestimates a very different effect than do studies of\nthe longer term effects of BMI on mortality.\nThe purpose of this study is to assess the BMI\nmortality relationship in a large nationally represen-\ntative sample of US adults. Advantages of the sample\nto be employed include its representativeness, large\nsize, inclusion of both men and women, inclusion of\nsubstantial numbers of blacks and whites, and rela-\ntively advanced age (all subjects ! 70 y of age at\nentry). Additionally, inclusion of baseline indicators\nof poor health allow control for the effects of apparent\nill-health.\nCorrespondence: Dr DB Allison\nMethods\nDescription of the Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA)\nThe LSOA is based on both the 1984 National Health\nInterview Survey (NHIS) and the Supplement on\nAging (SOA). For details see References 11\u00b113.\nThese surveys select subjects through multi-stage\nprobability sampling procedures designed to yield\nunbiased estimates of population parameters for the\nUS noninstitutionalized civilian population.

Information assessed\nincludes selected lifestyle and demographic informa-\ntion, numerous questions about health and disease,\ncause and date of death for any subjects dying during\nthe study (obtained by record matching to the National\nDeath Index), and height and weight at entry.\nSubjects\nThe subjects in this study include all those persons\ninterviewed in 1984 for whom height and weight were\nHowever, only subjects who de\u00aened themselves as\nblack and white were used in this study, since there\nwere so relatively few subjects of the other race;\nwhich resulted in the total sample size of 7260\nactual sample size available for particular analyses\nmay be lower due to missing data on variables\nincluded within these analyses. Within each analysis,\nmissing data were handled by listwise deletion.14\nDescriptive statistics for the sample are provided in\nStatistical analysis\nThe primary statistical analysis consisted of\n(unweighted) Cox proportional hazard regression15\nwith time to death from the initial interview as the\nend point. The unweighted analysis was chosen\nbecause, as Harris et al16 suggest, when estimation\nof effects rather than baseline characteristics is the\nmain goal, weighting is less obviously necessary and\nin\u00afates the variances of parameter estimates. The\nindependent variable (BMI) and potential confounders\nwere entered into the model as continuous variables or\ndichotomous variables. Higher order power polyno-\nmials of BMI were included to represent curved\neffects if they were statistically signi\u00aecant.\nAlthough this was the primary analytic approach\ntaken, several alternatives were tried as a form of\nsensitivity analysis to determine if the results were\nessentially unchanged regardless of the method\nchosen. This included: (1) categorizing BMI into\ndeciles and treating it as a categorical variable to\ntake into account the possibility of markedly nonlinear\nrelationships between this variable and the end\npoint;17 (2) transforming BMI to BMI71 to see if it\nenhanced the model's \u00aet to the data; (3) repeating the\nanalysis using the sample weights; (4) repeating the\nanalysis on only those subjects that appeared to be in\ngood health, and (5) repeating the analyses without\nsubjects with BMIs less than 16 or greater than 40.\nThis last approach was adopted to account for the\npossiblity that values outside the range of 16\u00b140 were\nlikely to represent data codingatranscription errors or\nhigh leverage points.\nBecause sex, age, and race are often found to be\nassociated with both BMI and longevity, they were\nselected as potential covariates in the model. More-\nover, interaction terms between BMI and age and sex\nwere incorporated to test for possible effect modi\u00aeca-\ntion by age and sex. Income and education were\nTable 1 Subject characteristics\nWomen Men\nVariable Mean s.d. Range Mean s.d.

Number of living\n\u00aerst degree relatives was included because explora-\ntory univariate analyses showed it to be related to both\nBMI and mortality, (the correlation of number of\npoint-biserial correlation between number of living\nrelatives and dying before the end of the study was\nputative markers of prevalent disease or preexisting\npoor health were included. These were af\u00aermative\nresponses to questions asking whether the subject had\nretired due to poor health, had dif\u00aeculty eating,\nworried about their health, and felt their health was\nworse than during the prior year. We had hoped to\ncontrol for smoking but the necessary information was\nnot available.\nIn determining which variables to retain as covari-\nates, we used heuristic guidelines proposed by Green-\nland.18 Speci\u00aecally, we retained in the model any\ncovariates that were statistically signi\u00aecant at the\nchange in the estimated regression coef\u00aecients for\nBMI and its polynomials and associated interactions\nwhen deleted.\nIn order to estimate the BMI associated with mini-\nmum mortality, the \u00aerst derivative of the \u00aetted func-\ntions was taken with respect to BMI. This derivative\nwas then set equal to zero and BMI was solved for.\nResults\nPreliminary analysis\nThe unadjusted relationship between BMI and all-\ncause mortality is depicted in Figure 1 by means of\ndeath rate in each of the BMI deciles. As can be seen,\nthe relationship appears hyperbolic with a slight\nelevation in the highest decile for both men and\nwomen, and the observed minimum mortalities are\nmen and women. However, this observation is based\nonly on BMI without any control for other covariates.\nMain analyses\nTo determine a suitable model, all the covariates\nunder consideration, power polynomials of BMI up\nto the third order and the interactions of these poly-\nnomials with age and sex, were included in a full\nmodel. Then the guidelines speci\u00aeed above were\napplied to select variables to retain. As a result,\npower terms of BMI above the second-order were\nexcluded from the model. Race (Black or White) was\nnot statistically signi\u00aecant either, and moreover, its\ndeletion did not affect the BMI and BMI2 coef\u00aecients\nby more than 10%, it was not retained. Interaction\nterms between the BMI polynomials and sex and age\nwere examined: the age by BMI terms were not\nsigni\u00aecant and their deletion did not affect the BMI\nand BMI2 coef\u00aecients by more than 10% and they\nwere therefore deleted. For the income and education\nvariables, only education met the criteria for being\nretained in the model. Number of living relatives was\nalso tried as a predictor but did not meet criteria for\ninclusion in the model. Indicators of pre-existing\nhealth problems were all highly statistically signi\u00ae-\ncant. Interaction terms between these health indicators\nand BMI terms were tried but did not meet criteria for\nentry in the model. We also tried models including\nother indicators of preexisting disease as covariates.\nThese included af\u00aermative responses to the questions\n`Have you had [disease] in the last two years?,' where\nthe disease categories were cancer, Alzheimer's,\nosteoporosis, hip fracture, angina, hardening of the\narteries, hypertension, rheumatic fever, coronary heart\ndisease, myocardial infarction, other heart attack,\nstroke, arthritis, diabetes, aneurysm, blood clot, and\nvaricose veins. Regardless of which covariates were\nused, it did not appreciably affect the shape of the\nmortalityaBMI curve or the BMI associated with\nminimum mortality. Because there are concerns\nabout `over-control' in this context, we elected not\nto include these covariates in the \u00aenal model. Finally,\nwe conducted analyses excluding subjects who died\nduring the \u00aerst few (for example 1, 2, or 3) years as\nsuggested by some authors,19 such exclusion made\nlittle difference to the results. However, we do not\nreport these as part of our formal results as recent\nwork20 does not support the statistical validity of this\ntechnique. Thus, the \u00aenal model retained is the \u00aerst\nlisted in Table 2, we refer to it as the `basic' model.\nThe estimated coef\u00aecients and standard errors of this\nbasic model are presented in Table 3. The basic model\nis also depicted by means of sex-speci\u00aec hazard ratios\n(to their corresponding minimum hazard with respect\nto BMI) in Figure 2.\nAs can be seen, the relationship between BMI and\nmortality, represented by the hazard ratios, is U-\nshaped for both men and women. The base of the\nFigure 1 Sex-speci\u00aec proportion of people dying in each decile\nof BMI.\nBMI among elderly people\nDB Allison et al\ncurves is fairly wide suggesting that a broad range of\nBMIs are well tolerated by older adults.

The basic model was refit weight-\ning by the final sample weights provided for LSOA\nsubjects. This process increases the probability that\nthe results will be representative of the US population.\nThis model is displayed as model 2 in Table 2. As can\nbe seen, the parameter estimates are nearly identical to\nthose in the basic model and the weighted and\nunweighted BMI mortality curves were observed to\nbe virtually indistinguishable. For reasons described\nelsewhere,21 the standard errors of the statistics for\nthis weighted basic model are not perfectly accurate\nand therefore the P-values from the observed w2 are\nnot accurate either. We do not, therefore, report the w2\nand P-value for this analysis.\nExcluding subjects in apparent ill health. In a further\neffort to avoid any confounding effects of pre-existing\nill health, we repeated the final analysis excluding\nsubjects who provided affirmative responses to ques-\ntions asking whether they had retired due to poor\nhealth, had difficulty eating, worried about their\nhealth, or felt their health was worse than during the\nprior year. Three thousand, three hundred and five\nsuch subjects were excluded. The model fitted in this\nanalysis is listed as model 3 in Table 2 and is\ndisplayed graphically in Figure 3. As can be seen in\nFigure 3, although the overall predicted hazard ratios\nTable 2 Results of model \u00aetting\nModel no.

Based on 7157 subjects.\nBMI among elderly people\nDB Allison et al\ntend to be somewhat lower when apparently unhealthy\nsubjects are excluded, the shape of the BMI-mortality\ncurves (Figure 3) and their minima (Table 4) are\nlargely unchanged.\nAnalyzing BMI as a categorical variable. In the event\nof marked nonlinearity, a categorized measure of\nexposure may more easily capture the relationship\nbetween death and exposure level. Therefore, we\nrepeated our analysis with BMI divided into deciles\nas a categorical predictor rather than as a continuous\nvariable. However, following this exploration, it is\nusually best to return to a model parameterized with\ncontinuous predictors.22 Overall, the results were quite\nsimilar to the prior analyses for the left side of the\nBMI mortality curve. Moreover, the minimum morta-\nity was estimated in the 9th decile of BMI; which\nreflects relationship between and BMI and mortality\ndepicted in Figure 1. However, in the highest decile,\nthe elevation in mortality was less dramatic than\nFigures 2 and 3 might suggest. This appeared to be\ndue to the fact that the high-end portion of the BMI\ncurve associated with greater mortality appeared to\ncontain few subjects whose influence was `washed\nout' in the highest decile aggregate effect.\nModeling BMI71: In an effort to determine whether\nan alternative continuous parameterization might pre-\nsent a different picture and attenuate the right side of\nthe U-shaped BMI-mortality curve, we refit the basic\nmodel replacing BMI with BMI71 and BMI2 with\nBMI72: Let us call this `BMI-inverse' model. These\ninverses were chosen to model the potentially `hyper-\nbolic' relationship. The overall model fit in was nearly\nidentical to the basic model in terms of observed\nlikelihoods. The resulting fitted model is listed as\nmodel 4 in Table 2. In view of the BMI-mortality\ncurve of this model, it was observed that using the\ninverse did indeed attenuate the apparently deleterious\neffects of extremely high BMIs and, conversely,\naccentuated the apparently deleterious effects of\nextremely low BMIs. Because this model and the\nbasic model fit the data equally well (see w2 in\nTable 2), we were unable to select one as the\n`better' model. Nevertheless, we observe that the\ntwo models provide nearly identical estimates of risk\nthe female and male samples, respectively. This BMI-\ninverse model was refit by excluding ill subjects, and\nthe result is listed as model 5 in Table 2. The overall\nshapes of hazard ratios in this model were seen to be\nalmost identical to those from the previous BMI-\ninverse model with all subjects.\nExcluding subjects with BMIs below 16 and above 40.\nTo evaluate the influence of the extreme BMIs on the\nmortality relationship, the basic and BMI-inverse\nmodels without ill subjects were fitted again with\nfurther exclusion of subjects whose BMIs fell outside\nthe range of 16\u00b140. The resulting equations are listed\nas models 6 and 7 in Table 2, respectively. As can be\nseen, this exclusion had some influence on the estima-\ntion of coefficients. However, viewing the hazard ratio,\nit was observed that the overall U-shaped pattern of\nBMI-mortality relationship was little changed.\nSensitivity analysis in terms of nadir points of BMI.\nTable 4 displays the estimated sex-specific nadirs of\nBMI (the estimated BMI associated with minimum\nFigure 3 Estimated (from the basic model without ill subjects)\nsex-speci\u00aec hazard ratios as a function of body mass index (BMI;\nkgam2).

As can be observed, the variation of nadirs\nacross the models is small relative to the range\n(Table 4).\nDiscussion\nThe results of these analyses suggest that among\npeople aged seventy years and older, the lowest all-\ncause mortality occurs at a BMI in the low 30s for\nwomen and high 20s for men. The sample studied was\na nationally representative sample of US adults. The\nwomen) in relation to a lower all-cause mortality risk\nin persons greater than seventy years supports most\npreviously documented \u00aendings1 and opposes others.2\nTo some extent, the shape of the association of BMI\nwith mortality in this older group may be the result of\nother in\u00afuences on mortality overshadowing or\n`washing out' the effects of BMI among these older\nadults or alternatively higher BMIs being protective\nagainst diseases that primarily affect the aged. For\nexample, in a recent analysis of the LSOA data,\nWolinsky and Fitzgerald23 reported on the strongly\nin\u00afuential effect of age and body mass interaction on\nhip fracture risk in older women.\nOne interesting \u00aending of this research is the lack\nof differential association between BMI and mortality\nby race. Some authors24 did not consistently \u00aend an\nassociation between BMI and mortality among Black\nAmericans, suggesting that the BMI mortality asso-\nciation may be different for Blacks and Whites.25\nAlthough the total number of Blacks in this study\nwas relatively small, there was no evidence that BMI\naffected their mortality differently than it did for\nWhites.\nA number of issues affect the interpretation of these\ndata. Firstly, there was no control for smoking as\ninformation with regard to current smoking or `pack-\nyears' smoked was unavailable. To obtain some\nestimate of the number of people over age 70 who\nsmoke and the relationship between smoking and BMI\nin this age group, we tabulated data from the 1990\nNational Health Interview Survey. Of 2325 people\nover age 70 who responded to a question about\nsmoking, 23% reported themselves to be current\nsmokers. These smokers had a mean BMI of 23.6\n(s.d.  4.2) for nonsmokers. Thus, it is plausible that\nat least some of the increased mortality observed with\nlow BMIs in this study is due to confounding from\ncigarette smoking. Similar issues apply to `ever'\nsmokers. However, although some studies do \u00aend\nthat controlling for or eliminating smokers does sub-\nstantially attenuate the elevated risk of all-cause\nmortality associated with low BMI,26 the overwhelm-\ning majority show little to no effect of eliminating\never smokers or controlling for smoking status (for\nwords, the relationship between BMI and mortality is\nnot markedly different when controlling for (either\nstatistically or by strati\u00aecation) smoking, suggesting\nthat the confounding effect of smoking on the BMI\nmortality relationship may not be great. However, the\nfact that other studies \u00aend little confounding due to\nsmoking is hardly a guarantee that such confounding\ndid not exist in this study.\nSecondly, the heights and weights were self-\nreported. This is an issue shared with many other\nstudies5,26,30 evaluating the BMI mortality relation-\nship. Heyms\u00aeeld et al31 extensively tabulated\nstudies reporting the correlation between self-reported\nheight and weight. Among adults, eight studies\nreported the correlation between BMI calculated\nfrom measured height and weight and self-reported\nheight and weight. Seven observed correlations above\nBMIs based on self-report seem to be highly corre-\nlated with BMIs based on measured values. However,\nthere are systematic errors such that women almost\nuniversally underreport their weight and men tend to\nunderreport their weight when they are heavier than\naverage but overreport their weight when they are\nlighter than average.31 In the case of women, this\nunderreporting would have no appreciable effect on\nthe shape of the curve if the underreporting were\nroughly constant across the range of BMI. It would\nonly result in the nadir of the curve being moved\nslightly to the left. However, the most obese women\ntend to underreport their weight the most.32 It is not\nimmediately clear exactly how this differential report-\ning bias might effect results. Nor is it immediately\nclear what the exact effect of men's misreporting\nmight be on the results.\nThirdly, although subjects with apparently ill health\nwere excluded in an attempt to reduce the potential\nconfounding effect of pre-existing ill health on survi-\nval, it is always possible that some residual confound-\ning may have remained.\nFourthly, body weight was available at only one\ntime point. No information on weight change was\navailable thus precluding the estimation of the effects\nof BMI in a dynamic versus static statistical model. In\nother words, this study did not allow a differential\nassessment of the effects of having a certain BMI as\nopposed to changing one's BMI. Weight history as\nsuggested by Losonczy et al30 may be crucial to\nunderstanding the relationships between weight and\nmortality in old age. In a prospective study of\napproximately 6000 community resident white men\nand women age seventy years and older, there was a\nsigni\u00aecantly increased risk of mortality associated\nwith weight loss from middle-to-old age. However,\nafter adjusting for weight change from middle-to-old\nage, BMI in old age was a signi\u00aecant predictor of\nBMI among elderly people\nDB Allison et al\nmortality. This study30 highlights the value of asses-\nsing weight change in addition to utilizing a single\nweight time-point in understanding mortality out-\ncome.\nThere are obvious limitations associated with the\nuse of body mass as an index of fatness over more\nthorough body composition measures. While BMI is\ntypically referred to as an indicator of fatness, it also\nprovides information on fat-free mass. As Baumgart-\nner et al33 discusses, the risk attached to higher or\nindeed lower BMI's may be due to altered fat mass or\naltered sizeacomposition of fat-free mass. Especially\nin aged populations where the relationships between\nfat and lean masses is likely altered,33 BMI may be a\npoor indicator of risk. The differential association of\nBMI with body composition may explain the change\nin optimal BMIs across the age span.\nFuture research might pro\u00aetably take several direc-\ntions. These include similar prospective studies using\nbetter measures of body composition than BMI, over-\nsampling the extremes of BMI to get a better appraisal\nof the effects of these extreme weights, assessing\nweight and weight change simultaneously in dynamic\nstatistical models,34 and assessing cause speci\u00aec mor-\ntality.\n"
