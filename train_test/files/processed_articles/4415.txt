    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: We previously showed that Toxoplasma gondii infection induces severe neuropathology\nin the form of oxidative stress, high nitric oxide production, glial activation, and apoptosis. This\nstudy examined the association between glia maturation factor-beta (GMF-b) expression, activated\nastrocytes/microglia, and neuropathology in toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE).\nMethods: Mouse brain GMF expression was examined by immunohistochemistry on days 10 and\n30 post-T. gondii infection.\nResults: Neuropathology of infected mice was associated with increased GMF expression in\nreactive glial cells and neurons compared with healthy controls. Specific up-regulation of GMF-b\nexpression in glial cells was associated with increased gliosis in TE.\nConclusions: GMF up-regulation in glial cells causes neuronal destruction, suggesting a TE\npathological pathway involving GMF-mediated brain cell cytotoxicity. GMF-b may therefore be a\ngood biomarker for disease risk assessment and to estimate host neuropathy after exposure to\nT. gondii, as well as providing a new therapeutic target. This is the first study to demonstrate the\nexpression of GMF-b in reactive glial cells and its association with neuropathology in TE.\n",

The protocol was\napproved by the Committee on the Ethics\nof Animal Experiments of Kirikkale\nAnimal infection model and\nexperimental procedures\nAnimals (female Swiss albino mice; age 12\u00ad16\nweeks; weight 22\u00ad25 g) were obtained from\nSaki Yenilli Experimental Animal Production\nLaboratory (Ankara, Turkey) and were con-\ntinually monitored for survival, clinical con-\ndition, and weight until the time of tissue\ncollection. The low-virulence ME-49 strain of\nT. gondii was used for infection as previously\ncysts of T. gondii were harvested from the\nbrains of mice that had been intraperitoneally\ninoculated with 20 tissue cysts. We used 6 mice\ncontrol groups, 6 mice 10 days after infection,\nanimals in this study. Control group: 6 mice.\ngondii infection: 6 mice. Typical symptoms of\nacute toxoplasmosis, including lethargy,\nruffled fur, or hunched posture, were not\nobserved after infection with tissue cysts.\nAnimals are anesthetized before infection.\nThat is, when work begins. Then 10 and 30\ndays later they were sacrificed. Animals were\nanesthetized with 20mg/kg of ketamine and\n5 mg/kg of xylazine. Mice were then perfused\ntranscardially with saline solution followed by\nformalin solution using a peristaltic pump.\nAnimals. six animals in each groups. Control\ngroup: 6 mice 10 post-T. gondii infection: 6\nmice 30 post-T. gondii infection: 6 mice. Six\nhealthy mice, sacrificed at the beginning of the\nstudy, were used as controls for immunohis-\ntochemical analysis. No animals died before\neuthanasia.\nNecropsy and histopathology\nMice were anesthetized with pentobarbital\n(10 mg/kg) and sacrificed by cervical dis-\nlocation. The brains were quickly removed,\nand the squash smear technique was used to\nidentify T. gondii tissue cysts. Briefly,\nfive small randomly selected pieces of fresh\nbrain tissue from the infected group were\nplaced onto poly-L-lysine-coated glass\nslides. Sections were fixed in 10% neutral\nbuffered formaldehyde for 1 min, and\nrehydrated through a graded series of alco-\nhol for 1 min. Mayer's haematoxylin was\napplied to the sections for 30 s, which were\nthen washed with distilled water, dehydrated\nthrough a graded alcohol series for 1 min,\ncleared in xylene for 2 min, and mounted on\nglass slides. Non-stained natural image and\nthen dyed preparations were examined\nunder light microscope. I do the `squash\nsmear' interpretation in 2 ways. Unstained\nand haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained\ntissues were analysed.\nSections were fixed in 10% neutral buf-\nfered formaldehyde for 48h and washed\nunder tap water overnight. Following routine\ntissue preparation procedures, tissue samples\nwere dehydrated through a graded series of\nalcohol and xylene and embedded in paraffin\nblocks. Paraffin serial sections were cut at a\nthickness of 4\u00ad5 mm, mounted on glass slides,\nstained with H&E, and examined under a\nlight microscope (Olympus BX51 microscope\nequipped with a DP25 camera, Tokyo,\nJapan). The inflammatory infiltrate of the\nCNS was scored according to the system\nthe total numbers of focal or diffuse inflam-\nmatory foci in a sagittal section. Cuffing of\nblood vessels and inflammatory cell infiltra-\ntion in the meninges were also analysed. All\nsections were analysed in a blind manner by\ntwo researchers. All analyses were performed\nat 40\u00c2 magnification.\nImmunoperoxidase examination\nGMF-b expression was examined by immu-\nnohistochemistry using a commercial anti-\nbody (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA,\nUSA). Staining was visualized on 4 - to\n5 -mm-thick paraffin sections using an indirect\nstreptavidin/biotin kit (HRP; Thermo\nScientific). Tissue sections were placed on\nadhesive slides, deparaffinized for 5 min in\neach of three xylene series, and rehydrated in\na graded alcohol series and distilled water.\nAntigen retrieval was accomplished by boil-\ning sections on glass slides in citrate buffer\nEndogenous peroxidase activity was\nquenched in 3% hydrogen peroxide in abso-\nlute methanol for 7 min at room temperature.\nSections were rinsed three times with phos-\nphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 5 min\nbetween each step of the test. Sections were\nincubated in blocking serum for 5 min to\nprevent non-specific binding. Thereafter, they\nwere incubated with the primary antibody\n(Thermo Scientific) for 60min in a humidified\nchamber at room temperature. Sections were\ntreated with a biotin-labelled secondary anti-\nbody (Thermo Scientific) for 15min and\nstreptavidin-peroxidase enzyme for 15min\nat room temperature. Finally, sections were\nincubated in aminoethyl carbazole chromo-\ngen (Thermo Scientific) for 5\u00ad10min to\ninduce the colour reaction. Mayer's haema-\ntoxylin was applied as a counterstain for 1\u00ad\n2 min. Thereafter, sections were mounted\nwith water-based mounting medium\n(Thermo Scientific). As a control for non-\nspecific endogenous peroxidase and biotin\nactivities in each test, the primary antibody\nstep was omitted. Immunostaining was eval-\nuated using a binocular microscope and\nphotographed under a 20\u00c2 objective lens.\nHistomorphometric analysis and statistics\nThe density of positive staining was measured\nusing a computerized image system com-\nposed of a Leica CCD camera DFC420\n(Leica Microsystems Imaging Solutions,\nLtd., Cambridge, UK) connected to a Leica\nImaging Solutions, Ltd.). Five representative\nfields were selected and consecutive pictures\nwere captured by Leica QWin Plus v3 soft-\nware under a 20\u00c2 objective lens (Leica\nMicrosystems Imaging Solutions) at a setting\nidentical to the image system for analysing.\nWe used the same setting for all slides. The\nintegrated optical density of all GMF-b-posi-\ntive staining was measured, and the mean\nGMF-b-positive area/total area was calculated\nby Leica QWin Plus v3. All images were\ncollected under the same lighting\nconditions. To avoid observer bias, a blinded\ninvestigator quantified all sections. Data were\ndescribed in terms of mean and standard\ndeviation (mean\u00c6 SD) for area %. After\ncalculating the proportion (% pixels) of stained\narea to the whole field, the mean (in % pixels)\nstaining area for each slide was determined.\nGMF-b immunohistochemical results were\ncompared between groups using a one-way\nanalysis of variance and Tukey's multiple\ncomparison test. All statistical analyses and\ngraphs were prepared using GraphPad Prism\nversion 6.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla CA,\nUSA). P< 0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nHistopathological findings\nH&E-stained brain sections from control\ngroup animals exhibited normal\narchitecture, but tissue cysts were observed\nin the 30-day post-infection groups (Figure\n1(a)). Neurohistopathological changes\nincluded nonsuppurative and/or necrotizing\nnon-purulent meningitis, neuronal degener-\nation (Figures 1(a),(b)), focal gliosis (Figure\n1(b)), hyperemia, perivascular mononuclear\ncell infiltration, and shrunken Purkinje cells/\nneurons with a highly dense eosinophilic and\nnecrotic appearance. Glial proliferation was\nobserved throughout the brain. The differ-\nence between the findings on days 10 and 30\nafter infection was significant.

We previously\nshowed that tachyzoites and bradyzoites are\nnot the only agents responsible for TE\nneuropathology, but that high nitric oxide\n(NO) production, induced oxidative stress\n(OS), destruction of the blood\u00adbrain barrier,\nand internally- and externally-induced\napoptosis also play important roles.20\u00ad22 In\nthis study, we reported increasing expression\nlevels of GMF-b on days 10 and 30 in mice\ninfected with T. gondii compared with\nhealthy controls. This enhanced GMF-b\nexpression was observed in reactive glial\ncells, particularly in glial foci, suggesting\nthat the TE neuropathology is mediated by\nGMF-b.\nGMF has a high level of oxidase activity\nand causes the formation of reactive oxygen\nplays an important role in oxidation/\nwell as the apoptosis of renal proximal\nconvoluted tubule epithelial cells through\nincreased sensitization to OS.23 GMF-null\nastrocytes also demonstrate increased anti-\noxidant activity and reduced ROS produc-\ntion and lipid peroxidation,24 indicating that\nGMF is key to the formation of OS-\nFigure 4.

In previous studies,\nwe reported that OS and apoptosis play\nimportant roles in TE neuropathology,20,22\nwhile this state was associated with the\noverexpression of GMF-b in the present\nstudy. Thus, it appears that GMF-b\ncontributes to the OS-mediated neuropath-\nology and apoptosis observed in TE.\nGMF was previously shown to induce\ninterleukin (IL)-33 expression, which in turn\nleads to tumour necrosis factor (TNF)\nrelease and the production of NO, causing\nFigure 5.

Both disorders present with elevated\nactivity of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide\ndismutase,22,36 reduced expression of the anti-\nthan coincidental. Indeed, cytokine-mediated\nneuronal injuries are considered to contribute\nto the pathophysiology of schizophrenia,\ncausing a decrease in neuronal number and\ndensity.40 Additionally, increases in glial cell\nnumber and density, shown in this study to be\nassociated with TE, were also previously\nobserved in schizophrenia.41\u00ad43 In the present\nstudy, when compared with healthy control\ngroups, mice at 10 and 30 days post-T. gondii\ninfection showed elevated GMF expression,\nparticularly in glial cells, triggering proin-\nflammatory reactions. The most striking\nfinding of this study was the establishment\nof a previously unidentified correlation\nbetween T. gondii and schizophrenia.\nTaking all these findings into account,\nincreased GMF expression appears to be\nimportant in the pathogenesis of schizophre-\nnia caused by T. gondii.\nThe present study also showed that GMF\nis a potential CSF biomarker for TE as an\nindicator of T. gondii-related neuropathy.\nAs such a biomarker, it could be used to\nestimate host neuropathy after exposure\nto T. gondii, as well as the severity of\nacute/chronic TE, and to identify optimal\ntreatment.\nIn conclusion, TE studies suggest that\nCNS neuropathology is a complicated pro-\ncess. Our findings implicate GMF as a key\nmechanism in initiating cytotoxicity through\na novel proinflammatory pathway, leading\nto the pathogenesis of TE. This is the first\nreport to reveal that GMF expression, as a\nmediator of CNS inflammation, is abnor-\nmally increased in TE. We propose that\nGMF could be used as a novel biomarker to\ninform of the severity of TE and to predict\nthe disease course. This study showed that\nneuropathology seen in toxoplasmic ence-\nphalitis may be mediated by GMF-b in a\nvery large proportion. Therefore, GMF-b-\nrelated pathology must be well-defined for\nthis disease. Moreover, GMF inhibitor-\nbased therapies could be used in TE clinical\napplications to prevent CNS inflammation.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
