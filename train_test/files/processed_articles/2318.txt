Electronic health\nrecords (EHRs) can provide clinical decision\nsupport (CDS) to guide providers in discussing pre-\nventive topics. Use of CDS has been shown to\nimprove the care of children with asthma6 and\nADHD.7 While the use of EHRs in the USA is\nexpanding with an influx of governmental\nsupport,8 most are initially designed with adult\npatients in mind, and the impact of EHRs on pedi-\natric WCVs is unknown. Prior studies have assessed\nanticipatory guidance delivered at visits with paper\ncompared to computerized data entry,9 but none\nhave yet examined preventive services based on the\nfunctionality of an EHR. We analyzed a nationally\nrepresentative sample to assess whether functional-\nity of EHRs is associated with the length of WCVs\nand with reported rates of preventive counseling.\nMETHODS\nData source\nWe performed cross-sectional analyses, combining\ndata from the National Ambulatory Medical Care\nSurvey (NAMCS) and National Hospital\nAmbulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS)\nElectronic Medical Records Supplement from\nthe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS),\nand are publically available. NAMCS provides\ninformation about the use of ambulatory medical\ncare services; NHAMCS provides details about\nhospital-based outpatient and emergency depart-\nments in the USA. Both use a multistage probability\nsampling design for physician practices and patient\nvisits within practices, which, when weighted, pro-\nvides nationally representative estimates of ambula-\ntory visits in the USA. For each visit, the physician\nor a staff member completes a survey form that\nidentifies patient demographics, counseling topics\ndiscussed, International Classification of Diseases,\n9th edition (ICD-9) codes, and the visit duration.\nMeasures\nWe included WCVs (defined by ICD-9 codes\nV70.9) made to pediatric, family medicine, or gen-\neralist offices by children and adolescents aged\nNCHS,11 we categorized EHR use as none, basic,\nor fully functional, with the following criteria:\nbasic systems have the ability to record patient\nhistory and demographics, problem lists, physician\nclinical notes, and medication lists, perform com-\nputerized prescription ordering, and allow lab and\nimaging result viewing; fully functional systems do\nall of these functions, and also include drug inter-\naction warnings, ability to send prescriptions dir-\nectly to pharmacies, computerized orders for lab\ntests, highlighted out-of-range lab values, medical\nhistory and follow-up notes, and reminders for\nguideline based interventions or screening tests.\nProviders were able to answer `yes', `yes, but\nturned off or not used', `no', or `unknown' to each\nfunction. Providers answering `yes' to each item\nnoted above were labeled as basic or fully func-\ntional users of the EHR. These items are included\nin the meaningful use `Core Set' objectives. No\nEHR use was defined by participants who answered\n`no' to the question `Does your OPD [outpatient\ndepartment] use electronic medical records (not\nincluding billing records)?'\nWe delineated child age (infant, <2; child, 2 to\nBlack, Hispanic, or other); insurance (private,\npublic, other); and percentage of poverty in the\nand 20%). We identified the practice owner\n(physician, other hospital, or other); specialty\n(pediatric or general medicine); and provider type\nseen at the visit (Doctor of Medicine or\nOsteopathic Medicine (MD/DO), or physician\nassistant/nurse practitioner (PA/NP)).\nWe examined rates of counseling for the follow-\ning topics (as defined by survey questions): diet/\nBrief communication\nnutrition, exercise, growth/development, injury prevention,\ntobacco use/exposure, any health education (any of these listed\ntopics), and other health education (any topic other than those\nspecifically listed). We also assessed the total number of topics\ndiscussed, and the time spent at the visit (NAMCS only, not\nincluded in NHAMCS).\nAnalyses\nWe used 2 tests to compare the differences for categorical\ndemographic variables and topics being discussed between the\nthree different EHR categories. We used negative binomial\nregression to test for differences between the EHR categories\nfor the total number of topics being discussed, for both bivariate\nand multiple regression, since this was an over-dispersed discrete\nvariable. All analyses were done using Stata V\nweighted to be nationally representative, adjusted for the\ncomplex sampling design.\nRESULTS\nA total of 8650 visits were included in the dataset, representing\nan annual average of 47 million visits nationally. Given the\nhigher rate of recommended visits in the first year of life, almost\nhalf (45%) of visits were for children <2 years of age (table 1).\nThere were no significant differences in EHR use based on\npatient or practice demographic characteristics. Overall, 77% of\npreventive visits were performed with no EHR, 14% with a\nbasic EHR, and 9% with a fully functional EHR. Finally, 89%\nThe highest rates of counseling were for diet/nutrition (47%,\nTable 1 Sample demographics and practice electronic health record (EHR) functionality\nVisits (%) (n=8650) No EHR (%) Basic EHR (%) Fully functional EHR (%) p Value\nSex\nMD, Doctor of Medicine; NAMCS, National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey; NHAMCS, National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey; NP, nurse practitioner; PA, physician\nassistant.\nBrief communication\np=0.54) for none, basic, and fully functional EHRs, respectively\n(figure 1). While diet/nutrition, exercise, growth and injury\ncounseling trended toward being higher at visits with a fully\nfunctional EHR, these differences were not significant.\nTime (in minutes) spent at the preventive visit (19.8 vs 18.6\nvs 22.1 min; p=0.12) for none, basic, and fully-functional EHR\npractices, respectively, were similar when examined overall. If\nwe strictly compare basic to fully functional EHRs, the differ-\nences in time spent are significant, with fully functional EHR\nvisits taking 3.5 min more (18% longer) than those with basic\nTable 2 shows the total number of topics discussed at the pre-\nventive visit. Controlling for patient age, insurance, level of\npoverty, and provider specialty, practices with a fully functional\nEHR documented delivery of 34% more counseling topics than\nthose without an EHR (p=0.01). In addition, patients aged 2 to\n11% and 12% more counseling topics, respectively, than\ninfants. Individuals living in areas with 20% poverty received\n20% less counseling compared to those in areas with <5%\npoverty (p=0.04). General practitioners provided 43% fewer\ncounseling topics compared to pediatricians (<0.001).\nWhen time spent at the visit is included in the model, visits\nwith fully functional EHRs provided 36% more counseling than\nthe time spent, the average number of topics discussed increased\nby 12% (p=0.01), irrespective of EHR functionality.\nDISCUSSION\nThis is the first study to examine the quality of care delivered at\npediatric preventive visits based on the functionality of a prac-\ntice's EHR system. Based on a nationally representative survey,\nwe found that visits performed at practices with fully functional\nEHRs documented delivery of 34% more counseling topics than\nthose without an EHR. Notably, 18% more time was spent at\nWCVs with fully-functional compared to basic EHRs, and for\neach 10-min increase in time spent at the visit, 12% more topics\nwere documented as being discussed.\nRates of EHR use in our study were similar to a 2008\nnational study of adult and pediatric ambulatory practices (13%\nbasic, 4% fully functional),12 but lower than the rate of 32% in\n2009 of `advanced stage' EHRs reported for inpatient stays for\nsupport regional extension centers and bonuses to providers for\nusing EHRs in a meaningful way built into the American\nRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the number of prac-\ntices using `fully-functional' EHRs will increase rapidly, as\npractices increased from 8\u00ad17%, and others have noted.14\nThe number of counseling topics reported as discussed was\nhighest at visits with fully-functional EHRs. We must caution\nthat (a) the database includes topics reported to be discussed,\nand (b) we cannot necessarily assume causation in this cross-\nsectional study. However, we speculate that this association with\nfunctionality of EHRs could be related to age-specific templates\nFigure 1 Counseling delivered based\non electronic health record (EHR)\nstatus*\nTable 2 Factors associated with total number topics discussed at\na preventive visit for all visits\nTotal topics IRR (95% CI) p Value\nEHR practice\nNone/partial EHR (Ref) 1.0 \u00ad\nAge (years)\nInsurance\nPercent poverty\nProvider specialty\nPediatrics (Ref) 1.0 \u00ad\nEHR, electronic health record.\nBrief communication\nor cues incorporated into EHR templates; such structured WCV\ntemplates have been shown to improve provision of anticipatory\nguidance.15 16 This is promising as more practices move to\nusing such systems. It is unclear what EHR component might\nhave increased the counseling provided, since specific compo-\nnents of CDS were not measured in NAMCS/NHAMCS. In\naddition, the number of topics discussed do not equate to the\nquality of discussion or to patient behavior change. Future\nstudies are needed to assess these issues.\nRates of counseling were not significantly higher for any spe-\ncific topic, although there appears to be a trend toward greater\ndiscussion of each topic when a fully-functional EHR is used.\nOnly diet and growth were discussed at half of visits; all other\ntopics were discussed less frequently, with tobacco counseling\nnoted at only 11% of visits overall. Of note, documenting\ntobacco usage and providing tobacco cessation counseling for\npatients over age 13 is a meaningful use criterion to receive\nreimbursement from the Center for Medicaid Services.17\nTherefore it is likely that this measure will improve dramatically\nfor practices using EHRs. In a 2011 Cochrane review,18 docu-\nmentation of tobacco status did increase, as did referral to\ntobacco cessation counseling, when an EHR was in place.\nDocumentation was moderate for diet counseling, but quite\npoor for exercise counseling. These topics are categorized as\nalternative quality measures for meaningful use, so it is critical\nfor pediatric-oriented EHRs to integrate such documentation\ninto the workflow for providers to both provide and receive\ncredit for such counseling.\nStudies vary on whether computerized systems add time to\nvisits, with one study noting an additional 5 min spent at pediat-\nric preventive visits,9 and others showing no change.19 20 We\nfound that visits with a fully functional EHR took 3.5 min\nlonger than those with a basic EHR, which could relate to the\nadditional counseling provided. However, we do not have data\nabout how long each practice has used its EHR, which may\naffect visit length. While the definition of fully functional EHRs\ndid include provider prompts, we do not have details about the\ntype, placement, or use of prompts which must be easily visible,\ntimely, and integrated into the provider's workflow to be effect-\nive.21 22 Nevertheless, an increase of 18% in visit length for\nWCVs, if confirmed, represents a substantial lengthening of\npediatric visits.\nWhile the long-term goal of a fully-functional EHR is to\nimprove the quality of care delivered, simply having such a\nsystem does not ensure improved quality.23 24 Studies have\nshown that EHR systems are often not used to their full cap-\nacity,25 but clinicians who have used structured documentation\nand have relied on CDS provided better care for specific chronic\nconditions,26 had improved screening,27 28 and delivered better\npreventive care.29 Ideally, a pediatric-oriented EHR will be able\nto link to immunization information systems, provide decision\nsupport for immunizations, and dose medications by body\nweight, among other functions.30 We are hopeful that the\nfinding of increased counseling provided with a more functional\nEHR will carry over to other improved abilities to provide pedi-\natric preventive care.\nLimitations\nThe counseling provided and time spent at the visit was docu-\nmented by the provider, and could result in over- or under-\nreporting.31 Of note, the WCV times in our study were similar\nto the average time of 20.3 min for WCVs noted in a recent\nstudy (observed and timed).32 One other study has shown that\nproviders over-report time spent on the NAMCS survey33;\nhowever we would not expect under- or over-reporting to vary\nbased on EHR status. Also, we have no information about what\nCDS was in place.\nCONCLUSION\nIn this national study, we found that 34% more counseling\ntopics were documented at pediatric preventive care visits in\npractices using a fully-functional EHR compared to those\nwithout an EHR, but visits using fully-functional EHRs lasted\nlonger than WCVs using basic EHRs. Further studies should\nassess the impact of EHRs on patient care quality and outcomes.\nContributors CMR participated in the conception and design, analysis and\ninterpretation, drafted and revised the article and approved the final version.\nPGS participated in the conception and design, interpretation of the data, draft of\nthe article, and approved the final version.
