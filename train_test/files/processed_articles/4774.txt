Hence, they do\nnot allow an assessment of comparative effectiveness.\nParticularly debated in this respect are sulphonylureas\n(SUs) \u00ad frequently recommended as the preferred second-\nline therapy \u00ad where some studies, first suggested by the\nhighly controversial University Group Diabetes Program\n(UGDP) conducted in the 1960s,3 led to uncertainty about\ntheir long-term CV safety, an effect perhaps related to\nbinding on the potassium adenosine triphosphate (KATP\n)\nchannel in cardiac myocytes and other cells,4 but the\nresults of long-term randomized controlled trials (RCTs)\nhave not supported a deleterious CV effect of SUs.5,6\nDipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are oral\nglucose-lowering agents for second-line therapy when\nglycaemic control cannot be achieved with metformin or\nas first-line therapy where metformin is contraindicated\nor not tolerated.7 DPP-4 inhibitors are associated with the\nbenefits of significantly lowering blood glucose level\nwithout the side effects of hypoglycaemia or weight gain,\ntwo adverse effects that occur with SU.7,8 Linagliptin is a\nonce-daily, DPP-4 inhibitor with a xanthine-based struc-\nture that is characterized by a pharmacological profile\ndistinct from other drugs in this class,8 largely due to its\nnon-renal route of elimination (80% hepatic vs 5%\nrenal).9 Of interest, a 2-year randomized, double-blind\nphase III trial comparing linagliptin versus glimepiride in\n10.0%) on metformin background therapy \u00ad designed to\nassess the effects on glucose control \u00ad suggested a\nreduced relative CV risk with linagliptin [0.46; 95% con-\noutcome of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction\n(MI), non-fatal stroke or hospitalization for unstable\nangina [4-point major adverse CV events (4P-MACE)].10\nEven though all CV events were prospectively adjudi-\ncated, the study was a registration trial neither designed\nnor powered to assess CV outcomes, and the overall\nnumber of CV events was low (n=38). Nevertheless,\nthese findings are suggestive and provide the basis for the\nhypothesis of a potential CV benefit of linagliptin over\nglimepiride, which is currently being tested in the ongo-\ning CARdiovascular Outcome Trial of LINAgliptin\nVersus Glimepiride in Type 2 Diabetes (CAROLINA\u00ae).\nMethods\nis an ongoing, multicentre, randomized, double-blind,\nactive-controlled trial. It is designed to assess the effect of\nlinagliptin compared with glimepiride, in addition to stand-\nard of care, on CV events in adults with relatively early\nT2D at increased CV risk or established CV complications\nand with less than optimized glycaemic control. The study\nprotocol was approved by the respective Institutional\nReview Boards, Independent Ethics Committees and\nCompetent Authorities according to national and interna-\ntional regulations.\nTrial population\nPatients with T2D who were na\u00efve to therapy or on a non-\ninsulin secretagogue (SU or glinide) with HbA1c\nand 8.5%, or currently being treated with an insulin\nsecretagogue (in monotherapy or in a dual combination\nregimen<5years) with HbA1c\nelevated risk of CV events according to specific criteria\n(Table 1) were eligible for inclusion. Upon randomiza-\ntion, if a patient was on a SU or glinide, this secretagogue\ntherapy was discontinued and replaced with study medi-\ncation. For patients not on a secretagogue, study medica-\ntion was added to the existing regimen. At screening, any\nglucose-lowering background therapy should have been\nstable for at least 8\nweeks. No patients requiring insulin\ntherapy for glucose control were allowed in the trial.\nPrevious exposure to DPP-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like\npeptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists or thiazolidindiones\n(TZDs) was exclusionary. Subjects were required at base-\nline to have a body mass index (BMI)45kg/m2 and age\n40\u00ad85years. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are\nlisted in online Appendix 1.\nStudy design and follow-up\nEligible subjects underwent a 2- to 4-week, open-label,\nplacebo run-in period (Figure 1) during which background\nglucose-lowering therapy was continued unchanged.\nFollowing the run-in, patients still meeting the inclusion or\nexclusion were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive linaglip-\ntin 5mg, or glimepiride 1\u00ad4mg, once daily in addition to\ntheir background therapy. After a starting dose of 1\nmg/\nday, glimepiride was up-titrated at 4-week intervals during\nweeks to a potential maximum dose of 4\nmg/\nday. The dose of glimepiride was increased if the fasting\nself-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) values were\n>110mg/dL (6.1mmol/L), unless the investigator consid-\nered that it would place the patient at an increased risk of\nhypoglycaemia. The average of previous recent fasting\nSMBG measurements (from the patient's diary) prior to\nthe day of visit could also be used to guide up-titration at\nthe discretion of the investigator. Of note, patients on pre-\nvious glimepiride treatment were randomized to linaglip-\ntin or to continue on their current dose (i.e. if the glimepiride\ndose was 4\nmg/day, the masked starting dose would be\nIf applicable, patients are to continue their metformin\ntherapy (preferably >1500mg daily) and other background\ntherapy throughout the trial with an unchanged dose unless\nfor medical emergencies or other patient safety reasons. To\nensure an adequate level of glycaemic control for partici-\npants, investigators could institute glycaemic rescue medi-\ncation provided specific protocol criteria were met (details\nin online Appendix 2). Investigators were also encouraged\nto treat all other CV risk factors [lipids, blood pressure\n(BP), albuminuria, unhealthy lifestyle and smoking) in the\ncontext of local or regional guidance for primary or second-\nary CV prevention. Changes to medication were ultimately\nleft to the investigator's clinical judgement.\nPatients are instructed to attend the clinic at pre-speci-\nfied times (e.g. every 16th week in the maintenance phase)\nover the duration of the study, including patients who pre-\nmaturely discontinue study drug. Irrespective of whether\non study drug or not, all patients are followed to capture\nCV events. Attempts are consistently made to avoid miss-\ning data and prevent withdrawal of informed consent or\nlost to follow-up that can compromise the integrity of the\nstudy. All subjects will undergo a final visit during the\nclose-out period of the study and are to be followed-up for\nadverse events (AEs) for a period of 30days after individ-\nual study completion (Figure 1).\nRandomization and patient inclusion\nOnce inclusion criteria were confirmed, randomization\nwas undertaken using a computer-generated random\nsequence and an interactive voice and web response sys-\ntem, without any stratification, as is recommended for\nOutcomes and adjudication\nThe primary outcome of the study is the time to first occur-\nrence of CV death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI),\nnon-fatal stroke or hospitalization for unstable angina, that\nis, 4P-MACE.\nThree key secondary outcomes were defined: (1) time\nto the first occurrence of any of the classical 3P-MACE\nTable 1.

The steering commit-\ntee, which is led by the academic investigators and included\nmembers who are employees of the sponsor, supervises the\ntrial design and operation. An independent data monitoring\ncommittee (DMC) reviews interim safety data approxi-\nmately every 90days or on an ad hoc basis on request. The\nDMC will also perform two interim analyses (IAs) as dis-\ncussed below. The data will be analysed by the sponsor and\nalso independently analysed and validated by independent\nbiostatisticians at L-Biostat at KU Leuven Research and\nFigure 1.

The primary hypothe-\nsis is that linagliptin is not inferior to glimepiride for the\nincidence of 4P-MACE. This is by means of comparing\nthe upper limit of the two-sided repeated 95% CI at a non-\ninferiority margin of 1.3, which is mandated by the FDA\nfor CV trials evaluating new therapies for T2D.2 This test\nis the first in a five-step hierarchical testing strategy,\nwhere a subsequent test is only performed in case of a\nsignificant prior result: (1) non-inferiority test of the\nprimary outcome (4P-MACE), (2) superiority test of the\nprimary outcome (4P-MACE), (3) superiority test of key\nsecondary CV outcome (3P-MACE), (4) superiority test\nofthefirstkeysecondaryefficacyoutcome(HbA1c7.0%\nwithout rescue medication, moderate or severe hypogly-\ncaemic episodes and >2% weight gain at final visit) and\n(5) superiority test of the second key secondary efficacy\noutcome (HbA1c\n\n7.0% without rescue medication and\nwithout >2% weight gain at final visit).\nN\n=\n631 confirmed primary outcome events provides\n91% power to show CV non-inferiority, if the underlying\nhazard ratio (HR) for the incidence of the primary outcome\nbetween the linagliptin and glimepiride groups is 1.0 for\nthe specified one-sided alpha of 2.5%. If 1-year event rates\nare 2% in each treatment group, accrual time is 2\nyears,\nfollow-up time is 4.8years and the 1-year loss to follow-up\nyield the necessary number of events.\nFurthermore, 631 patients with 4P-MACE provides\n80% power to demonstrate superiority assuming a HR of\nfor linagliptin as compared to glimepiride.\nIAs. The DMC will perform two formal IAs of the primary\nevents have occurred. At each of these IAs, the trial could\nbe terminated if superiority for linagliptin is demonstrated\nwith respect to 4P-MACE and overall CV safety, with par-\nticular emphasis on CV mortality. Of note, at the second\nformal IA, the trial may also be stopped for futility, if supe-\nriority of glimepiride with respect to the primary outcome\ncan be shown prematurely or if a futility assessment shows\nthat the 1.3 non-inferiority margin likely will not be met,\nbased on a conditional power of less than 20%. The DMC\nis the sole group with access to unblinded results.\nTo prevent an inflation of the significance level, a group\nsequential design was chosen, where the O'Brien and\nFleming -spending function defines the allocation of the\none-sided overall significance level of 2.5% to the IA and\nnumbers of patients with 4P-MACE, the cumulative alpha\nAnalysis plan.The primary analysis will be performed on\nthe full analysis set (FAS). The FAS consist of all rand-\nomized patients who were treated with at least one dose of\nstudy drug. For the primary and secondary or tertiary CV\noutcomes, a classical intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis on\nthe FAS will be done including all adjudicated and con-\nfirmed events which occur until study end. The time to\n(first) event will be derived from the date of randomiza-\ntion. Patients who do not experience an event during the\ntrial period will be censored at their last documented study\nvisit.\nThe analysis of primary and secondary or tertiary CV\noutcomes will be based on a Cox's proportional hazards\nTable 2.

These sub-\ngroup analyses are considered as being of exploratory\nnature, and analyses will not be adjusted for multiple com-\nparisons. Further details on this are provided in online\nAppendix 6.\nResults\nPatient recruitment and baseline characteristics\nRecruitment into CAROLINA began in December 2010\nthe steering committee recommended to stop further\nrecruitment of patients solely fulfilling CV risk category\n`d' (i.e. the lowest CV risk). In total, 10,639 patients were\nin 43 countries. The main reason for screen failure was an\nHbA1c value not meeting protocol specifications. Of those\nrandomized, 6041 were treated with study drug.

In total, 82% of patients used metformin back-\nground medication at a mean\u00b1SD daily baseline dose of\ng. CAROLINA included patients based on four\nCV risk categories [from low to high (Table 1)], and 34.5%\nof the cohort had previous CV complications (MI: 13.8%,\ncoronary artery disease: 17.1%, stroke: 7.8% or peripheral\narterial occlusive disease: 5.5%), 8.5% had evidence of\nvascular-related end-organ damage as defined by impaired\nrenal function [estimated glomerular filtration rate 30\u00ad\nRenal Disease Formula (MDRD), albuminuria (urinary\nalbumin:creatinine30\n\u00b5g/mg in two out of three unre-\nlated specimens] or proliferative retinopathy. An age\n70years was the main inclusion criteria in 19.3% of sub-\njects, and 37.3% had multiple CV risk factors (without\nhaving established CV complications).

Of note, both of these studies\nwere relatively short in duration and drug exposure\n(median follow-up, respectively, 2.1 and 1.5years) and\nincluded patients predominantly, or exclusively, with\nmanifest CV complications. Whether a longer follow-up\nwould have led to a different result is not known; further\nan hypothesis generating findings supporting the con-\ncept of early intervention was seen in a subgroup analy-\nsis of the EXAMINE trial,18 suggesting that patients\nwith a shorter duration of T2D seemed to have benefited\nfrom alogliptin therapy as compared to those with a\nlonger duration.\nAn unexpected finding in the SAVOR-TIMI 53 trial\nwas a statistically significant increased risk for hospitali-\nzation for CHF, associated with saxagliptin therapy, and a\nrecent analysis of data in EXAMINE for alogliptin sug-\ngesting an increase in risk which was, however, not statis-\ntically significant.19 CAROLINA will also address\nthrough independent adjudication whether CHF hospitali-\nzations are increased with linagliptin or glimepiride and\nwhether death due to CHF occurs more frequently. This\nstudy will provide the greatest possible insight into\nwhether DPP-4 inhibitors hold advantages over SUs in\nterms of CV outcomes, and despite other ongoing com-\nparativeeffectivenessstudies,likeGRADE,20 CAROLINA\nis the only active-controlled comparator trial sufficiently\npowered to address CV outcomes. One interesting aspect\nrelates to the potential that hypoglycaemia, in particular\nsevere hypoglycaemia, may modulate and increase CV\nrisk.21 In a former study, it was demonstrated that hypo-\nglycaemia occurred at lower incidence with linagliptin as\ncompared to glimepiride.10 However, the relative deleteri-\nous contribution of hypoglycaemia on MACE remains to\nbe fully elucidated, and CAROLINA will also be able to\naddress this.\nOf note, in a recent pooled CV meta-analysis analysing\nthe comparative impact on CV events of SUs versus other\nagents, an overall neutral effect on CV events versus total\ncomparators was reported [odds ratio (OR) 1.08 (95% CI:\nindividual compounds (i.e. metformin, GLP-1 receptor\nanalogues, DPP-4 inhibitors and TZDs), a neutral effect\nwas reported for all classes of therapies except versus\nDPP-4 inhibitors where the analysis suggested a benefit of\nevents)]. It should be noted, however, that CAROLINA\nalso has its limitations, in particular since we do not\ninclude a placebo arm to assess the independent effects of\nlinagliptin and glimepiride.\nWith 6041 patients randomized, CAROLINA will also\nprovide insights beyond CV outcomes from the sub-stud-\nies, where recent data indicate a potential role for DPP-4\ninhibition, including impact on microvascular,23 renal\noutcomes,24 cognitive function,12 long-term beta-cell\nfunction14 and ambulatory glucose profiles13 and may\ndemonstrate further evidence on a recent observation of\npotential beta-cell protection with linagliptin in latent\nautoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA).15\nIn summary, the CAROLINA trial will help clarify\nthe CV safety and potential CV protection of long-term\nlinagliptin compared to glimepiride in early T2D pre-\ndominantly on background metformin therapy. The out-\ncome of the CAROLINA trial may generate the most\nrobust evidence in the decision-making process for\nselecting a second glucose-lowering agent after met-\nformin in T2D.\n"
