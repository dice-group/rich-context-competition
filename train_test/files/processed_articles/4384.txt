The teacher-researcher utilizes autoethnographical and psychoanalytical techniques of critical\nreflection and self-applied transportation theory, and arts-based research to unravel these perceptions and to enhance his\nautobiographical findings of both geographical and psychological place. One intent of the nonnative teacher-researcher was\nto uncover one predominantly White Texas high school community's actions and thoughts of racism and prejudice through\nhis own eyes while at times suffering from a relapse of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and anxiety. Another intent was to\ngive the teacher-researcher further perspectives into his biography, his own attitudes of racism, prejudice, and inequality, and\nfurther understandings into the underlying causes of depression that bound his experiences in geographical and psychological\nplace. Findings suggest that this teacher-researcher's use of psychological techniques while suffering from a relapse of MDD\nand anxiety can negatively impact his ability to locate physical and psychological aspects of place.\n",

Humpal1\n Keywords\neducational research, education, social sciences, educational psychology and counseling, curriculum, teaching, diversity and\nmulticulturalism\n2 SAGE Open\nThe following discussion of place has been bracketed\nfrom my autoethnographic study titled \"Challenging Ghosts\nin the Hegemonic Closet: An Autoethnography,\" which\nhighlights the perceptions of a Southern, White male teacher,\nat times experiencing bouts of Major Depressive Disorder\n(MDD) and anxiety in the predominantly White rural high\nschool community of Big Falls, Texas (mythical in name).\nAs the researcher-teacher I utilize critical reflection, self-\nimposed transportation theory, and arts-based research to\nunravel these perceptions and to enhance his autobiographi-\ncal findings.\nWhile one intent of this study was to give a White male\nfurther perspectives into his biography and his attitudes of\nracism, prejudice, and inequality, and further understanding\ninto the underlying causes of depression that bound his expe-\nriences in one place, another intent was to uncover one pre-\ndominantly White Southern high school community's actions\nand thoughts through the eyes of someone not born and\nestablished in the community. The study reveals that critical\nreflection and self-imposed transportation theory, while at\ntimes dangerous for the teacher-researcher experiencing\ndepression or anxiety, nonetheless, are effective tools for\nunleashing possible ties that bind both depression and anxi-\nety to original perceptions made within the community and\nestablishment of physical and psychological space.\nPlace\nTo say all research is a first-person narrative is not to say that\nall research is about the heart. The heart pushes the self for-\nward to places it doesn't belong. I don't want to go to places\nwhere the heart is not welcome. Such places frighten me.\n\"Are you frightened by the truth?\" would come the rejoinder.\n\"No, I'm frightened by what poses as the truth\" (Pelias,\nFor a good part of my adult life, I have been navigating\nthrough my world, mentally struggling at times to find my\nemotional place of comfort. I struggle with life, fearfully\nnavigating through what others justify as truths about mental\nillness and psychological spaces. I understand the need to eat\nhealthy and stay physically fit. I also understand the need to\nstay mentally fit. What I would give to be mentally healthy is\nin the subjective negotiation of \"passages through social sys-\nborders (Freire, 1984) in a hegemonic wilderness whereby\ntraditional empirical research of class and gender tends to\nignore such discussions that intersect historically with male\nteacher illness narratives. Peggy McIntosh (1990) tells us\nthat race and sex are not the only advantaged systems at\nwork. \"We need similarly to examine the daily experience of\nhaving age advantage, or ethnic advantage, or physical abil-\nity, or advantage related to nationality, religion, or sexual\norientation\" (para. 15).\nFor place to inform the act of inquiry it must be turned\ninside out; in other words, its essence must be uncovered\nand understood. The raw material of place must be brack-\neted in such a way that grants insight into the human con-\ndition, historical movement, and/or anthropological\nexpression. Joe L. Kincheloe and William Pinar (1991)\nextend Eudora Welty's insight by noting that the meaning-\nmaking process sets into motion a \"synergism\" whereby\n\"rhythms of time and fleeting glimpses of the unconscious\nare integrated with a knowledge and place to reveal hid-\nden designs\" where \"not only place itself is exposed but\nalso the elusive conversation between place and curricu-\nlum theory is audible\" (p. 8).\nOther writers and artists have also provided explanations\nand renderings of the significance of place in research, the\ndemand for autobiography, and \"working through\" place as a\nsymptom of culture. Brian Casemore (2008) notes the under-\nstandings of art critic Lucy Lippard (1997), French historian\ndemonstrate severing lived and embodied relationships to\nthe past can make it difficult to find meaning in the present.\nBut as Lippard argues in Casemore, \"The lure of the local\nconnects us to the past we have forgotten.\" What we are left\nwith then is the question of how one navigates through \"the\naspects of ourselves and our relations to others that have\nbeen obscured in our experience of place\" (as stated in\nMary Jacobus (1999) argues in \"Psychoanalysis and the\nScene of Reading\" that what readers do not see in fictional\nlandscapes can give them an \"unconscious sense of relating\nYet, she adds that these very same landscapes can provide a\nmedium in which the reader can work through personal and\nhistorical trauma (Casemore, 2008, p. 9). Furthermore,\nMitchell (2002) sees place in terms of Jacque Lacan's theory\nthat \"defines subjectivity as a place in language\" that has no\n\"no real physical dimensions, but is the representation of a\nframework is applied to place in the South through Lacan's\nuse of space, by relating his idea of space, place, and land-\nscape to Lacan's idea of \"The Symbolic, the Imaginary, and\nthe Real\" (Mitchell, 2002, p. x). It is in the Lacanian idea of\n\"The Real\" signifying a traumatic or historical event that\nMitchell argues is interwoven with the imaginary landscape,\nand helps to expose our transference,\" in the psychological\nsense of place.\nComplications\nIt does not take a catastrophic event to lose oneself in a fic-\ntional world. The symptoms of MDD and the application of\nsuch psychoanalytical tools as critical reflection and self-\napplied transportation theory complicated my awareness of\nnot only who I was, but also an awareness of where I was at\nmentally and physically. Heller (2002) tells us of critical\nreflection that,\nWe can understand journaling as the self-in-the-moment\nspeaking of and to a past self, but with a future self in mind . . .\nThe self simultaneously contains the experiences of the past\nalong with the possibilities of the future sees this as the value of\ngoing inward to find the proper direction. (as cited in Rossiter &\nFurthermore, self-applied transportation theory is a tool\nfor travel through song, film, television sitcom, art, medical\nrecords, school records, and life history memorabilia, includ-\ning photos, art, texts, for symbolic interactions between the\nobject and self, then return to the present reality, whereby\none can be entertained or informed, or seek clarification\nWhile geographically I have traveled hundreds of miles\nfrom Iowa to Texas, to Colorado, and back to Texas, my use\nof psychoanalytical tools in themselves did not hamper my\nawareness of my \"inner\" place. The very symptoms of MDD\nand the search for identity also threw off my compass. A few\nof the most common symptoms of MDD are deep feelings of\nsadness, marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities,\ninsomnia, increased fatigue, restlessness, feelings of worth-\nlessness or inappropriate guilt, and difficulty thinking, con-\ncentrating, or making decisions. Neither thoughts of death\nnor suicide entered my mind during the Major Depressive\nEpisode (MDE) I suffered during my study. In other words,\nMDD can \"color\" or \"inform\" your perception of reality.\nQuite often when I was not suffering from these symp-\ntoms, I asked myself, \"Am I a middle-aged White male high\nschool English teacher stuck in a predominantly White rural\nschool district in Central Texas, culturally and psychologi-\ncally isolated, yet historically connected to the people I was\nstudying?\" During the study, I discovered instances of rac-\nism and prejudice that reminded me of my racist and verbally\nabusive stepfather. One morning after the 2008 election of\nBarack Obama, I found a tattered American flag lying in the\nstreet outside of my home. It was my stepfather's death on\nmy birthday in 1998 that triggered my initial episode of\nMDD and brought forth unanswered questions from my past,\nand now in the current context of racism, I found compelled\nto have answered in an eerily familiar landscape.\nThe following findings from my study show the difficul-\nties and lessons I experienced locating my place.\nI love peacefulness of the mind generated by the absence of\nhuman sound. That's why I would explore a 200 acre wood near\nour house by myself many times. It didn't matter the season. In\nfall, after raking the fallen burnt orange brown maple leaves into\na pile at the bottom of a hill and then jumping into it, or after a\nstrong mid-January snowstorm smelling air you swear God\ncreated just for you while skating down your small frozen ravine\n. . . Later I would come to find out that is ozone . . . Or spring\nwatching the different colored finches, and squirrels . . . And\nthere I was. So when we would take a long trip to our cabin in\nNorthern Minnesota through Bemidji (Paul Bunyon country) to\nWoman Lake, all I did was absorb my surroundings . . . wasn't\nsure why, maybe the virgin images were calming. (Author,\nEvery time I hear Pearl Jam's \"Small Town,\" as it is nicknamed,\nI am reminded of why I dislike living in such communities. It\nreminds me of my faded days growing up in a small Northwestern\nIowa town that mammoths the rural speck I now live in by a\n12-fold population. But it is not so much its size, or population\nthat is reminiscent. It is who the population consists of . . .\nmostly White, mostly church-going, mostly blue collar, spare\nthe stench from meat-packing plants filling the air. I didn't want\nto be stuck in my childhood town working construction the rest\nof my life only to be visited years later by old friends. I wanted\nto get the hell out. Only now I am in nearly the same spot I was\nback when I graduated from college in 1984. I never looked\nback when I left in a December snowstorm in my orange 1968\nVW Beetle with an Iranian American student via Colorado\nSprings before heading to my television reporting job in South\nTexas. Now it is 2012, PhD in sight, job hunting in sight, and\nnow another possible escape from a small town in White\nAmerica where everyone knows my name, but who does not\nwant to say hello because I am not from here. (Author, personal\nBig Falls is the type of community that is prejudice against\noutsiders more than the color of your skin. If your family was a\npart of the community you were granted more access to than\nsomeone that moved into the community. There were times\nprejudice was reflected due to the color of your skin. African\nAmericans that grew up in Big Falls knew their place. As long as\n(African Americans) were participating and doing well in\nathletics, things were fine. Our parents only came to the school\nif there was a problem or maybe to see us play. They did not\n\"rock\" the boat and neither did their parents. (Author, personal\nBig Falls reminds me of my Iowa heritage. I am a\n52-year-old male of German, Bohemian, and French decent.\nWhites alone account for about 93% of the population,\nwhile Hispanic or Latino accounts for about 4% and African\nAmericans about 3%. People of German ancestry represent\nthe largest portion of the Iowa population. My grandfather's\ngreat grandfather left the far southern village of Mettenburg,\nGermany, around 1840 and moved to a small Irish settle-\nment in Minnesota. Grandma's great grandparents were\nfrom France. Both families were strong Catholics and had\nlittle wealth.\nIn Texas, the Czechs apparently brought with them the\nancient friction between Protestants and Catholics, which\ndeterred efforts for Czech national unity. Czechs were not\nonly Catholic, some were Protestant, Presbyterian, Moravian,\nyet shared similar interests in agriculture and celebrated\nCzech customs, but they did not share \"a common goal for\nbuilding a unified Czech community\" (Apperson, 1969,\np. 43). It was Presbyterians and Moravians who were more\ninclined to associate with the American Protestants than the\nCzech Catholics with American Catholics. Furthermore,\n4 SAGE Open\nPresbyterians with Calvinistic Reform theology were more\ninclined to communicate with mainstream American reli-\ngious groups than did the pietistic Moravians. Thus, it was\nthe Czech Presbyterians who served as leaders toAmericanize\nthe Czechs.\nCzechs and Germans apparently displayed common cour-\ntesies between each other, although the immigrant-majority\nCatholics \"were admonished to stay away from Protestants\"\nStruggle between, Czech, German, and Anglo-American\ncultures increased markedly in the 1920s and erupted into\nmanifestations against each other. \"Name calling, fights, and\nprohibitive use of languages other than English in schools\nwas common\" (p. 62). The discord between the two ethnic\ngroups was said to have contributed to the appearance of the\nKu Klux Klan in Texas and a local Klan group was formed in\nBig Falls. It was Protestant in sympathy and \"professed a\nprogram against crime and corrupt officials\" (Karlik, 1972,\nA group of over 200 Klansmen were allowed, despite requests\nagainst it, a short parade through the business district in January\n1923. Apperson, Karlik, and the town paper claimed, based on\n\"informed sources,\" that most of the Klansmen were not from\nBig Falls. These three sources reported that most of the\nKlansmen were from outside of the community and the number\nwas far less than expected. But today one can find the remains of\nthe local Klan's old meeting place next to a bird sanctuary about\ntwo miles from the Knights of Columbus Hall. After the parade,\nan anti-Catholic movement was fought with almost equal\npassion by a small group of Czech Catholics. The resulting\nfriction between the two cultures destroyed much of the unity\nestablished during the war. Catholic Czechs began to feel\nunaccepted because they were of foreign birth or parentage. The\nconflict helped to renew their isolation. (Karlik, 1972, p. 84)\nDepression's Impact on Perception\nAs the historical pattern of racism and prejudice began to\nemerge, my agnosticism and my increasing sense of isolation\nmagnified my anxiety and depression. The following emails\nwere hastily sent to my superintendent, assistant superinten-\ndent, principal, and assistant principal during what seemed a\neuphoric sense of what turned out to be a false sense of real-\nity. The emails note further conflicts with issues of trust.\nDuring this time, I was in a sense reaching out to even people\nin the hegemonic circle, needing to talk. However, my\ndepression and anxiety may have colored my view of reality,\non one hand distorting the public view of depression in a way\nthat people would accept it, particularly my bosses, and on\nthe other, masking the confidentiality of my research of this\nvery community that they were vaguely aware of.\nTeachers face anxieties and fears every day in the classroom . . .\nsociety does not care, administration does not care, kids do not\ncare . . . I have learned how to manage major depression\nthroughout my life . . . look where I am at . . . I was ranked 150th\nout of 220 in my class . . . yet today, I am a successful teacher\nand role model . . . I propose a short motivational performance\npresentation for teachers who suffer the same fears in the school\ncommunity and high school I do.\nThanks so much for the advice, especially about keeping it\nsimple. I am just going to focus on my life as an English teacher\nhere. Throwing in too many expectations beyond what I can\nreasonably handle while I am still teaching. The classroom and\nthe kids are still my responsibility, and my responsibilities will\nnot change wherever I go. (Author, personal correspondence,\nWhile struggling with distrust, isolation, and loneliness,\nwelcoming and creative realizations were emerging from my\nperceptions that would soon assure my return, the realization\nthat dominant cultures perpetuate prejudice, and the realiza-\ntion of inner healing transpires through such journeys:\nThe story, \"A Lesson Before Dying\" mentioned divorce, but in\nEarnest Gaines's sense it was a separating of our physical selves.\nIf we do divorce (separate) you take your role and responsibilities\nwith you. But while you are with these kids, you show them how\nto form their own view of the world and frame themselves. A\nperson's time is short on this earth, at least physically. It is\nteacher's mission, my mission to serve as a facilitator of method\nand tools of knowledge building so they can construct their own\nlens. I have to remember that, hate begets hate, even if I don't\nagree, we need to talk about ways of bridging gaps together\nthrough knowledge we call experience. (P. Slattery, personal\nOne bitter, but again, healing realization about society and\nmyself was that of hypocrisy, both of a private and public\nnature. The following journal entries further support the\nhypocrisy of Big Falls desire for self-sufficiency and isola-\ntion and my conflicting desire for peace and belongingness\nwhile criticizing their desire as negative:\nThis struggle is one of my realities . . . not being able to show my\nempathy, or gratitude to others at times of depression. So, if I am\na role model as a teacher, a person who has impact, and I do not\ndo anything about my lack of assertiveness to enact change on\ntheir behalf, I feel like a coward. (Author, personal\nIt's hard to find a spot without humans . . . and that seems to be\nmy story. I like being alone. Not all the time. Just during My\ntime. People see me and ask, \"Is everything all right?\" I say,\n\"Yes.\" But really it's not. I am melancholy. It seems I always\nhave been. I used to smile a lot. Not anymore. (Author personal\nThe ability to realize how depression and anxiety can both\ncolor and inform one's current struggle for meaning-making\ncame down to one question: If I could run through the\npredawn streets of Big Falls at 5 a.m. without incident, where\nis the danger? The euphoria I felt from a 24-min, 2-mile run\nthrough the streets of Big Falls began seeping through my\nsoul . . . So I ran the next day, and the next day, until by sum-\nmer's end I was running four early-morning jaunts through\nwhat was once scary territory. I began to feel safer, and to a\nlarge degree at peace with what I was experiencing. Some\npeople would say I lived an existential experience, others\nmight say it was just runner's high. Yet all I remember is that\n\"feeling\" you get when you feel this was not your doing . . .\nsomething or someone was at work in the greater scope of\nthings.\nIn my psychological space, my depression revealed per-\nsonal prejudices, current and past, of race and religion. My\nperceptions during this time also reveal my hypocritical\nnature, criticizing people of religious faith while speaking of\nreligious tolerance. This impacts how I have viewed the sub-\njects of this community. However, this also gives me greater\nunderstanding of how religion has played out through history\nin terms of the negative consequences of prejudice such as\nisolation.\nConsidering the amount of research I conducted about\nMDD and anxiety through numerous sources, I am not sur-\nprised that my journal entries and personal correspondence\nwritten during my relapse revealed I was fighting against\nhegemony. I was fighting against hegemony in terms of treat-\nment of my mental illness through medications against local\ncommunity powerbrokers, school district officials, princi-\npals, and parents of students with power who I could have\nactually have benefitted from. But this sensitivity informed\nme to be wary and critical of small, rural high school com-\nmunity members. It also reaffirmed my desire to move on to\na place I felt was home.\nValue for Others\nThis morning, I cut the remains of a 15-foot branch from a\n100-year-old pecan tree now lying before me. The drought of\n2011 sucked it dry, cutting off a constant source of life . . .\nand as the pecans formed and matured, the weight of the nuts\nplus a windstorm was all it took to down it atop the hard\nconcrete patio. Someone told me one time that divorce is\nworse than death. I am not sure I necessarily agree, because\nI have experienced divorce twice, and the deaths of my\nmother, father, stepfather, and others, as well as my own\ndeath experience. The tree that had provided my family with\na healthy nut in the late fall and a protective shade in the hot\nTexas summer was beginning to realize its once metaphori-\ncal winter. Death, divorce . . . they do share one thing in\ncommon, and that is the overriding sense of physical loss of\nthe living. I could extend those losses to include experiences\nthat keep us at least psychologically connected to physical\nbeings by memory.\nI noticed other pecan trees heading for their downfall as\nwell. The trees in my neighbor's yard, the Catholic church's\ncommunity center across the street, the trees planted at the\nformer high school built in the early 1900s, and some of the\nhundreds of trees scattered in the more than 100 square miles\nof the Big Falls Independent School District. I paused and\nthought of the great pines of Northern Minnesota and blazing\nashes of the Rocky Mountains near my parent's tombstone,\nand the very fallen branches my mom would climb while\nmotorcycling through the sparse Iowa woods.\nThe trees served as my mother's messenger, and my pro-\ntector of most things I have come to know as a White male. I\nadmired her fearlessness, fortitude, respect, empathy, and\nlove for nature and mankind. Through her, and later my step-\nfather (yes the White Irish bigot), I acquired growing respect\nfor women. It was not uncommon for us siblings to put on the\nboxing gloves and settle a fight with the rest of the family\nlaughing through the picture window. But later, as a teen, my\nstepfather warned us that if we ever picked a fight with a\nwoman, we would not see the light of day. I still have great\nrespect for my older sister Patty who can still lay me down\nwith a good punch.\nMore than that, as a married man, I watch with care and\nunderstanding how my wife, two daughters, and female stu-\ndents who have navigated a male-dominated world sometimes\nwith success, and other times with defeat. But with my moth-\ner's guidance, I am learning the impact such marks can make\nin the physical aspect of one's place and the psychological. As\na White male educator in a predominantly White rural high\nschool community, introducing curriculum that focuses on\nrace, ethnicity, class, gender, and mental ability, can be risky.\nIt was not that I felt I was the next \"great White hope.\" I actu-\nally felt like a White, Northern carpetbagger having difficulty\nselling his goods in a predominantly White, rural southern\ncommunity, not feeling any need to necessarily redeem myself\n(Remillard, 2011) or write a conversion narrative commonly\nfound among Southern Whites (Hobson, 1999).\nMore so, my narrative speaks to the underlying ecological\nunderpinnings of autopoetic narratives (Denzin, 1997) that\nexposes a Peliasian (2004) \"empathetic connection, [and] a\nbody that takes as its charge to be fully human\" (p. 1) in our\npersonal and professional lives. I would research the com-\nmunity again, and I will still promote pedagogical action\nwith possibilities that ignite educative experience-making in\nthese communities (Washington & Humphries, 2011).\nDespite rejection by some students from, and who were\nassimilated into the White rural Southern high school men-\ntality, others expressed their gratitude.\nI cannot concur more strongly with Pinar's view that\nsome Northerners wrongly tout a moral superiority when it\ncomes to a discussion of racism in the South. Little do\nMidwesterners remember their ancestral treatment of Native\nAmerican tribes during the early history of the plains, and the\ndisparaging of African Americans seeking economic refuge\nand freedom up the mighty Mississippi River after the Civil\nWar, only to find themselves embroiled in an economic battle\nstirred by White farmers and businessmen.\n6 SAGE Open\nIn keeping with memories and thought structures, I chan-\nnel my mother's muse by nurturing those very places I share\nwith my wife, my children, my students, my neighbors, and\neveryone else. Within those spaces, places, or landscapes\n(Greene, 1978), it is now time to ask ourselves, \"How will\nwe navigate through such a complex world that is at times\nimpatient, harmful, intolerant, disrespectful, inconsiderate,\nand self-centered towards nature and others, yet also seeks\npatience, tolerance, respect, protection and empathy for\nnature and others?\" It is time we call on our own muse to\nguide efforts toward a physical and psychological reconcep-\ntualization of the educative place we call the high school.\nWith our muse at our side, we will be guided from an educa-\ntively inclusive place to expanded spaces, not just new spaces\nwithin the high school, but also spaces venturing into the\nland that first brought our ancestors yearning for the toler-\nance, respect, and physical and mental well-being they once\nsought.\nMy call beckons classroom research that Henry Giroux\n(1992) says transcends borders, and in what Geneva Gay\n(2011) calls \"affective, humanistic, and transformative\"\nways (p. 39), by helping teachers and students explore new\nlandscapes of learning, and making individual choices and\nrelativity within the global community (Greene, 1978).\nSlattery (2006) accentuates the perpetuated problems sur-\nrounding attitudes in open discussion of issues involving gen-\nder, sexuality, race, and ethnicity, while further defending the\nneed for postmodern curriculum developers to, \"aggressively\nand consistently include lessons and experiences that will\nameliorate the divisions and hatred we face in the world today\"\nGay (2011), this call is a call for urgent restructuring of the\nhigh school as we know it, not only in the curriculum, the\nobjectives, and the physical architecture, but also in continued\nresearch supporting endeavors advocating cultural and aca-\ndemic equality among all students. As such, I ask other\nresearchers to join with me in reigniting further research into\n1. The restructuring of schools and other educational\ninstitutions that accommodate student-centered\nlearning of the community spaces they inhabit,\nincluding further student control in curricular deci-\nsions that consider their inner psychological spaces\nand awareness of physical surroundings impacting\ntheir sense of well-being, interpretation of their place\nin the community, local environment, and within a\nmulticultural world that transcends our comfort\nzones, and\n2. The inclusion of community members, such as archi-\ntects, artists, doctors, counselors, scientists, and spiri-\ntual leaders working with schools in nurturing an\ninteractive communal atmosphere that invites stu-\ndents and educators out of the classroom and into the\nlocal environment.\nThe lack of educators equipped to address these problems\nhas added to, \"the frustration, anger, and violence that\npractices of \"irrelevant or inadequate\" (Slattery, 2006,\np. 188) local school district philosophy and mission state-\nments can perpetuate divisions between philosophers and\neducators in curriculum development and theory, \"unless we\nsee philosophy of education as a vehicle for engendering jus-\ntice, compassion, self-exploration, empowerment, critical\nthinking, and ecological sustainability\" (p. 198). As Levin\n(2009) notes, \"Educators can't for a moment be complacent\nabout our place in public's hearts and minds--consequently\nin their wallets\" (p. 94).\nAside from calls for further research, there is a need for\ncontinued emphasis on student, educator, and community\ninvolvement in school redesign, curriculum delivery, and\nschool climate. Inherent in reconceptualized high schools in\nthe design should be facilities that provide spaces for physi-\ncal and artistic expression that allow for a greater sense of\nwell-being. Pilar Marin and Brett Brown (2008) argue that\nbeyond the academic development of students, school envi-\nronment also encompasses \"student physical and mental\nhealth, safety, civic engagement, and social development\"\n(p. 1). As such, they suggest that school policy and activities\nshould be viewed through the larger context. Schools have to\naffect student physical, mental, and nutritional help through\nteaching health classes, changing school lunch menus, physi-\ncal education classes and sports activities, programs address-\ning mental health issues of bullying, drug abuse, and stress,\nand mandated medical services.\nFurther reconceptualization entails a curriculum that\nallows opportunity for students to interact with their environ-\nment. Aside from student field trips, community and envi-\nronment-based student projects can be offered which would\nallow student interaction with community members, experi-\nSlattery 2006) and historical, autobiographical understand-\nings of their environment (Pinar & Grumet, 1976; Slattery,\nand Howley (1992), multiculturalism \"can only be made\nsense of when rural schools make sense of them in their own\ncircumstances\" when \"rural students can understand other\ncultures best when they understand their own culture well\"\n(para. 9).\nWalls are only reserved for utility rooms, offices, and\ngyms, while instructional areas utilize an open plan with\nboth large and small subareas. Reconceptualized high school\ncommunities could further provide greater access for expres-\nsive spaces through expanded offerings of art, music, and\nphysical activities not normally available to students due to\ncourse requirements and schedules.\nSome design experts and schools are taking the lead in\ndiscussions that include the involvement of students and\ncommunity in school redesign efforts. The Chicago\nArchitecture Foundation and its \"DiscoverDesign\" Internet\ntool for high school students teaches school design and con-\nstruction, and also provides a forum for input from other stu-\ndents, teachers, and design professionals (Discover Design,\n2011). Also, The School Planning Section of the North\nCarolina Department of Public Instruction assists school dis-\ntricts, architects, and designers in its state in the planning and\ndesign of high-quality school designs. Other websites, such\nas web Urbanist, also provide coverage of educational, and\ncreative works of culture from around the world that recently\ndisplayed 15 \"cool high school, college and university build-\ning designs\" such as the Austrian-designed Modern High\nSchool in central Los Angeles, and Orestad High School in\nCopenhagen.\nReconceptualized high schools could also cultivate stu-\ndent and educator opportunity for spiritual and emotional\ndevelopment within their environments (Slattery, 2006,\np. 71). Becoming more prevalent are schools based on such\nideas of Buddhist leader Daisaku Ikeda's curriculum of Soka,\nor value-creating, education. The value-creating focuses on\n\"cultivating individuals capacity to create values of gain,\ngood, and beauty\" and also \"the spirit to foster individuals\nwho create wisdom, courage, compassion, and other human\nvirtues through dialogue, global citizenship, and human edu-\nJust as \"Christianity cannot be separated from Paulo\nFreire's educational philosophy\" (p. 60), they add Buddhism\nis inherently tied to Ikeda's educational philosophy. But it's\nclear religious doctrine is not taught in any class. In addition,\nGoulah and Takao Ikeda assert schools promulgate human-\nism, spirituality, totally and virtues of wisdom, courage and\ncompassion because \"they will enable students to enjoy per-\nsonal growth and contribute to society\" (p. 61).While separa-\ntion of religion from schools is necessary, an atmosphere that\ndoes not hinder student choice in development of their spiri-\ntual well-being should be a cornerstone of our efforts. As\nsuch, Slattery (2006) argues \"we must find an appropriate\nway to teach theology, textual hermeneutics, cultural diver-\nsity, and critical analysis without cross the line of separate\nbetween religion and government\" (p. 77).\nThe thoughts of such reconceptualizations, whether in the\ndreams of a 52-year-old White male high school teacher in the\nSouth or in any other teacher's memory will just remain inside,\nunless researchers, educators, and other community members\nactively pursue such ventures with their muses as their guide.\nI know all too well the value of a tree.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\n1920: A clash of conservative cultures.
