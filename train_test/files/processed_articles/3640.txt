    "abstract": "Abstract\nSelf-reporting surveys in social science are commonly criticized for generating results that are often found not to reflect\nthe actual behavior of participants. This article discusses the limitations of such surveys specifically in exploring the Arabian\nGulf context and explains how the Islamic Work Ethic can create biases in survey research. The reflections in this article\nare based on the author's experiences in conducting social research in Bahrain using self-reporting questionnaires and focus\ngroups. The discussion presented in this article highlights the salience of socio-cultural factors in designs of research studies\nand suggests that the cultural context in which a study is conducted may significantly affect the adequacy of specific research\nmethods. This article also implies that, due to societal values, using self-reporting surveys to identify patterns in institutional\npractice may result in overrated self-evaluations rather than a description of \"what is.\"\n",

The first schools in the Gulf were kuttabs--that\nis, places were reciting and memorizing the holy Qur'an was\ntaught (Bahgat, 1999). Schools were also meant to replace\nfamily upbringing and graduate citizens who could quickly\nlearn to read and write to work in offices and to teach in\nschools (Quaddummi, 1995). Due to these influences, and\nthe resultant approaches to teaching and learning based on\ninculcation and rote pedagogy (Quaddummi, 1995), the Gulf\nmonarchies have struggled to find the balance between their\ntraditional values and the growing requirements of modern\nFindlow (2008) offers an analysis of this balance and\nargues that modernizing education in theArab states is driven\nby political and transnational agendas that underpin educa-\ntion reform in the context where secularism and religious\nfundamentalism meet. This is why we have seen modern cur-\nricula and teaching approaches being drawn into the local\ncontext of the Gulf countries as a means of alternatives to\neducation that has been perceived by international powers to\nbe in need of modernization but not considered from the\nlocal perspective (Hayes et al. 2015). On the other hand,\nresearch in areas of teacher work in particular suggests that\nthis modernization does not necessarily take place within\npractitioner attitudes toward education and that strong reli-\ngious and regional influences still underlie pedagogical prac-\nParticularly relevant to this article is what Jonathan, Ong,\nand Hairon (2009) highlight, that, despite working within the\nboundaries of fast moving internationalized education\nreforms, teachers in Bahrain continue to demonstrate the\nIslamic influence on their attitudes toward work. Jonathan et\nal. (2009) compare how two culturally different groups of\nteachers engaged with self-evaluations of their work, and\nprovide explanations to particular ratings of their teaching\nand leadership skills in cultural traditions and religious\nbeliefs of teachers in Bahrain and Singapore. Their analysis\nshowed that Bahraini teachers' evaluations of their own\nclassroom behaviors were significantly higher than those of\nteachers in Singapore.

Hayes1\n Keywords\nsocio-cultural, surveys, social sciences, Islamic Work Ethics, Bahrain\n2 SAGE Open\nIslamic influences on work in Bahrain and the value of\n\"effort\" that holds an important place in the Islamic Work\nEthic (IWE).\nJonathan et al. (2009) argue that kinship, effort, and com-\npetitiveness, which are all core values of the IWE, are still\nstrongly present in Islamic teaching communities like\nBahrain. They were described to have influenced the teach-\ners to self-enhance their behavior because Islam praises\nthose who work hard to achieve their goals (Jonathan et al.,\n2009). Taking these conclusions into account, it seems also\nthat IWE could help in explaining the conflicting research\nresults that will be discussed in this article, especially that the\nbalance between secularism and religious fundamentalism in\neducation in the Gulf seems not to have been completely\nsettled (Pavan, 2014). Within the tensions of global versus\nlocal, teachers need to find their way of \"pleasing\" the gov-\nernment who seem to deploy international curricula as a\nmeans to educational improvement but which has been found\nto violate their own beliefs about education (Hayes et al.,\n2015). Thus, the IWE seems to be a legitimate lens through\nwhich explanations of the ways in which those\n\"internally struggling\" teachers engage in research could be\nunderstood.\nTheoretical Framework--The IWE\nIWE is an orientation that originates from the teaching of the\nQur'an that describes people's attitudes toward work in the\nIslamic context (Rokhman, 2010). It describes a set of prin-\nciples that guides people's approach to work and their par-\nticipation in the workplace (Rokhman, 2010). It also\ndescribes work as a virtue and necessity for establishing\nequilibrium in private and professional life (Rokhman,\nAli and Al-Owaihan (2008) state that the main principles\nof the IWE include not only pursuing legitimate business,\nearning wealth according to capacities, quality of work, pay-\ning appropriate wages, relying on self, and generosity but\nalso avoiding bribery, cheating, greed, and monopoly. These\nprinciples are derived from the history of the Islamic state\nwhere merchants were responsible for the development of its\npower by trading honestly and building strong relationships\n(Ali, 2001). IWE is therefore based on the belief that those\nwho work hard will be awarded, people should take advan-\ntages of the opportunities that enable them to build their\nwealth, and they should conduct their business in a fair,\ntransparent, and just way (Ali & Al-Owaihan, 2008).\nWhat is particularly important in looking at IWE as a lens\nfor understanding research is the fact that it differs from the\nProtestant Work Ethic (PWE), followed largely in Western\ncontexts, in that it emphasizes intentions rather than out-\ncomes (Ali & Al-Owaihan, 2008). Although this difference\nhas been viewed by some researchers to be unimportant in\nunderstanding work outcomes (Awan & Akram, 2012), it\nmight be crucial for understanding research outcomes\nreported in this article. Ali and Al-Owaihan (2008) highlight\nthat\n. . . intentions constitute significant pillars in the IWE. They\nclearly differentiate the IWE from the work ethics of other\nfaiths. One of the fundamental assumptions in Islam is that\nintention rather than result is the criterion upon which work is\nevaluated in terms of benefits to the community. (p. 12)\nJonathan et al.'s (2009) findings cited in the previous sec-\ntion clearly link those intentions to the high self-ratings of\nteachers in Bahrain. Those links were significant for under-\nstanding the outcomes of the research discussed in this arti-\ncle as one set of findings presented in later sections of this\narticle was taken from a survey study whose aim was to\ndescribe the current teaching practices in English language\neducation in Bahrain. Understanding the possible influence\nof the IWE on teachers work helped in concluding that sur-\nveying teachers in schools about their practices was likely to\nbe viewed by those teachers as evaluations of their profes-\nsional practice. Following the IWE, we can conclude that\nthese evaluations were likely to be based on good intentions,\nas opposed to the actual classroom behavior (Ali &\nIn addition, a deeper analysis of the current English teach-\ning context in Bahrain can also help to fully rationalize the\nIWE as the theoretical framework for the conclusions drawn\nhere. It seems that the teachers who took part in the survey\nresearch could have been under a lot of \"performance pres-\nsures\" associated with the change in the approaches to teach-\ning in schools that were escalated after the quality assurance\nreview by the National Authority for Qualifications &\nQuality Assurance of Education and Training (NQQAET;\nDirectorate of Government School Reviews, 2014).\nThe NQQAET review commanded many schools to con-\nduct accurate self-evaluations to improve their overall per-\nformance. High performance was going to be judged based\non greater academic achievement of students and higher\nteaching standards (Directorate of Government School\nReviews, 2014). Teachers' professional practice was there-\nfore thoroughly inspected and the results from the reviews\nwere used to design new professional development programs\n(Directorate of Government School Reviews, 2014). The\neffectiveness of teachers' work was therefore judged on how\nwell they have followed on from the training programs they\nreceived (Directorate of Government School Reviews,\nConsidering these work pressures, the emphasis on inten-\ntion in the IWE provides a useful lens for conceptualizing the\noverrated teacher behavior in the survey study discussed in\nthis article. The IWE holds business motives in the highest\nregard and teaches its followers to \"persist in [their] action\nwith a noble end in mind\" (Imam Ali, cited in Ali, 2001). For\nteachers who follow the IWE, the important instruction is\nthat \"failure to perfect your work while you are sure of the\nalso holds that an important obligation for every man is\nengagement in economic activities of their nation (Ali,\n2001). This in Bahrain can be realized through improving\neducation.\nBahrain's transition to knowledge economy has spurred\nviews on education grounded in contributing toward the\nnation's public good, underpinned by the country's vision to\nbecome the regional economic power in the Gulf (Secretariat\nGeneral of the Higher Education Council, 2012). The IWE\nadvocates this approach to education by emphasizing that\nstruggle in working toward the realization of national ideals\nis necessary, which makes the IWE a leading force advocat-\ning productivity at work (Ali, 2001). Within this context,\nteachers need to perform very efficiently to meet the stan-\ndards that are set for them, demonstrating loyalty to their\nresponsibilities for raising student standards and commit-\nment to public good.\nWorkers who follow the IWE have been found to have an\nincreased sense of commitment to public good through striv-\ning to meet the organizational requirements (Shakil, 2011).\nIn fact, the higher the standards set by an institution, the\nhigher the commitment of workers seems to be (Shakil,\n2011). Within this commitment, however, the main emphasis\nstill seems to fall on intentions rather than the actual result of\nwork, and those intentions become the main criterion for\nThe IWE therefore provides a useful framework for\nunderstanding teachers' thinking about their work and the\nmotivations behind the high self-ratings of their own behav-\nior in the survey study that will be analyzed here. It seems to\nsuggest that teachers in Bahrain are highly committed to\ntheir work and that, through this commitment, they develop\nintentions to work hard to satisfy the needs of their institu-\ntions. Jonathan et al. (2009) had already suggested that these\nintentions may also affect the validity of evaluations of\nteachers' professional practice in the Gulf states, as they are\nlikely to be biased due to the emphasis on those intentions.\nThis article will additionally argue that the influence of the\nIWE also creates biases in Gulf research which uses self-\nreporting surveys to describe \"what is.\"\nReview of Literature\nSocietal and religious beliefs have increasingly been cited in\nliterature as a factor affecting the work of teachers, the deci-\nsions made by teachers, and the perceptions of teachers of\nMansour (2013), for instance, argues that it is imperative\nthat we consider teachers' views and perspectives on educa-\ntion and their own profession as they are crucial in under-\nstanding educational provision. This article will argue that it\nis also important to consider how teachers view the research\nprocess and its goals before making decisions regarding the\nstudy methods. As teachers' personal experiences and reli-\ngious beliefs seem to perpetuate their work, it is also plausible\nthat they play a role in teachers' attitudes toward research\nabout this work. Mansour (2013) finds that teachers' own\nreligious beliefs and societal values influence their perspec-\ntives on teaching and learning before entering a teacher train-\ning course, which in turn affected how they engaged with\ntheir training program. The same is said about the research\nprocess as research literature on the Arabian Gulf, suggests\nthat cultural beliefs become salient when participants engage\nwith a particular research method (e.g., Thomas, 2008).\nThese conclusions are significant for the discussion in this\narticle because if, for instance, the religious beliefs of pre-\nservice teachers are considered to be crucial for their engage-\nment with training (Mansour, 2013), and if collective nature\nof Arab societies is thought to be key to conducting focus\ngroups (Thomas, 2008), socio-cultural influences, such as\nthe IWE, are likely to also be crucial for developing an\nunderstanding of how teachers respond to survey items about\ntheir professional practices.\nIn fact, a report presented by the International Bureau of\nEducation and National Institute for Educational Research of\nJapan (IBE & NIER; 1995) suggested that teachers in\nBahrain hold specific views on the purposes of research.\nThese views reject everything that could threaten their pre-\nrogatives or interests. This has been reflected in the follow-\ning words in the Geneva meeting where the report was\npresented:\nWe can certainly observe the paradoxical behaviour of a great\npart of teachers who previously were described as supporters of\nusing research findings in the Ministry's decisions. In fact, this\ngroup of teachers remain enthusiastic to support such findings as\nlong as these findings are presented as a controversial matter,\nand therefore as long as their support could bring them in some\nintellectual distinction or some credit . . . In reality most of the\nfield practitioners are not so enthusiastic to carry out any practice\nwhich implies mastering new or additional skills. Therefore,\nwhen reforms fail, the bureaucracy can claim that it was not\nAfter receiving significant criticism of their practice from\nas the recommendations from the NQQAET to regularly par-\nticipate in professional development training (Directorate of\nGovernment School Reviews, 2014), it seems that Bahraini\nteachers might wish to engage in research with the view of\nprotecting their professional prerogatives. Influenced by the\nIWE, and therefore wishing to protect their future reward,\nthe teachers are likely to engage in research in a way that will\ndemonstrate their intentions to improve their skills and com-\nmitment to their work. Being seen as not trying could be\nviewed by their supervisors as very damaging to their careers,\nespecially that the majority of managers and government\nofficials in the Gulf have been found to build their work rela-\ntions on the IWE (Ali &Al-Kazemi, 2007;Ali &Al-Owaihan,\n\"Effort\" in particular seems to characterize the work of\neducation leaders in Bahrain. The Ministry of Education in\n4 SAGE Open\nBahrain have constantly tried [emphasis added] to reform\nthe national curriculum in English to shift the focus of lan-\nguage education from traditional teaching to communicative\napproaches and have continually strived [emphasis added]\nfor excellence and innovation (Al-Sulaiti, 2002). Other\nIslamic leaders and workers, outside the Gulf, in industries\nsuch as public sector in Pakistan (Ahmad, 2011) or financial\nsector in Indonesia (Rokhman, 2010) have also been\ndescribed as being driven by effort and innovation capability\n[emphasis added]. Jonathan et al.'s (2009) view is that it is\neffort [emphasis added] that is behind the high ratings of\nclassroom behavior of teachers in Bahrain, which are\ngrounded in intentions to work hard [emphasis added] rather\nthan the actual actions. This suggests strong links to the IWE\nand the possibility that the research participants in the study\nin this article, not wishing to be disclosed as lacking commit-\nment and effort during the research process, engaged in\nresearch in a self-appraising and protective manner.\nTeachers in particular seem to be the group of profession-\nals who are most likely to follow the IWE as the ethical\naspects of their professions are built on moral teaching, pub-\nlic good, and promoting citizenship (Abu-Saad & Hendrix,\n1995). These are also the core values of the IWE which is\nwhythe external dominations of foreign cultures connected\nin the case of Bahrain with transnationalization of education\ndo not play a significant role in the change of teacher atti-\ntudes towards work. Research in Arab teachers'values domi-\nnated by the culture of Israel revealed that the \"Western\"\norganization of the school where the teachers worked did not\nseem to have any effect on their attitudes to work (Abu-Saad,\n2003). The research found that individual effort in meeting\nobligations toward their organizations, underpinned by con-\ntribution to society and public good, was the strongest value\nunderlying those teachers' behavior (Abu-Saad, 2003). Abu-\nSaad (2003) also found that personal effort and achievement\nwere equally valued.\nPersonal effort, achievement, and best self-interests were\nstrongly emerging inAbu-Saad's (2003) study due to societal\npressures. Both men and women indicated that these were\nimportant work values; however, women scored higher on\nthese IWE factors. Although making a distinction between\ngenders is unnecessary for the objectives of this study, Abu-\nSaad's conclusions explaining the difference in scores\nbetween women and men effectively contextualize the expla-\nnations of the findings in this article. Abu-Saad (2003) pro-\nposes that the importance of self-interest, achievement,\ndetermination, and personal effort for women was under-\npinned by the need to prove themselves in a profession where\nthey \"are not welcomed by all\" (p. 48). This has parallels to\nthe situation of teachers in Bahrain which was explained\nabove, concluding that within the context of the current\nschool improvement program, these teachers need to also\nconstantly prove themselves to receive professional recogni-\ntion based on self-evaluations (Directorate of Government\nSchool Reviews, 2014). It is possible, therefore, that the\nsurveys in this study about teacher practice were viewed by\nthe teachers as self-evaluation tools, and the IWE provides a\nframework for explaining this conclusion.\nThe strong presence of IWE in Arab workers values (Ali\nthat the separation of religion from the work context, despite\nspecifically strong secular influences on education in the\nGulf (Findlow, 2008), might not have fully taken place. For\nthis reason, the IWE becomes a useful lens for interpreting\nthe conflicting results of the study discussed in this article.\nTaking into account that teachers'values shape how they per-\nceive specific circumstances (Schoenfeld, 1998), where tak-\ning part in the research is viewed as one of them, the IWE\nwill be used as a framework for understanding what goals\nteachers establish for themselves in a research project. The\nprinciples underlying IWE have been used in a number of\nresearch studies discussing the impact of the IWE on various\njob variables (Awan &Akram, 2012). Engaging with research\nhas been assumed in this study as one of the job variables\ntoo, something that teachers in Bahrain perhaps felt they had\nto do to receive recognition, as the recommendations from\nthe NQQAET encouraged them to continually review\nresearch as part of professional development. This perhaps\nexplains why they decided to take part in the study that will\nbe explained below in the first place, but exploring how they\nthought about their responses through the lens of IWE can\nhelp us make better decisions regarding research methods,\nparticularly the use of surveys. This article aims to discuss\nthe limitations of such surveys, specifically in exploring the\nArabian Gulf context and explains how the IWE can create\nbiases in survey research.\nBackground to the Research in Bahrain\nThe research that is used for the discussion in this article had\nbeen conducted in Bahrain for several years. The most sig-\nnificant stages of this research in terms of the aim of this\narticle are centered around two particular sets of findings.\nThe first one is the findings from the self-reporting question-\nnaire-survey; the second, from the focus groups that were\nconducted following the survey. To better understand how\nthese findings are used to discuss the limitations of self-\nreporting surveys in the Arabian Gulf which is the aim of this\narticle, some contextual information is presented below.\nThe overall aim of the research in Bahrain was to explore\nthe success of Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) in\nstate schools through self-reporting surveys and focus groups\nwith English teachers. The CLT was a new English teaching\nreform in schools at the time of research and describing how it\nwas received in the new socio-cultural context was important.\nA survey was therefore designed to gather information about\nhow and whether the classroom practice changed after the\nintroduction of the new reform. Using the survey seemed to be\nan obvious choice as descriptive surveys are commonly applied\nin social studies to examine organizational situations at a\nspecific time (Kelley, Clark, Brown, & Sitzia, 2003). Surveys\nare methods that allow researchers to examine the situations in\ninstitutions by describing actions, experiences, and knowledge\nof the employees (Kelley et al., 2003). Therefore, the survey\ncontained items regarding various aspects of CLT and the\nteachers were asked to indicate which aspects are implemented\nin classrooms (details of these items can be viewed in\nschools completed the survey and data were analyzed descrip-\ntively to identify the patterns in teaching.\nFollow-up focus groups were conducted to explore in\nmore depth the items indicated in the survey-questionnaire.\nApart from the purposes of triangulation to develop greater\nconfidence in the research data, the primary aim of the focus\ngroups was to discuss in more detail the teaching situation at\nthat time. The emerging patterns from the focus groups were,\nhowever, completely contradictory to the findings indicated\nby the survey data, which formed the rationale for this article\nthat highlights the limitations of self-reporting surveys in\nexploring work contexts in the Arabian Gulf.\nAlthough contradictory results may sometimes be noted\nduring a typical triangulation process, it was felt that the con-\nflict of results between those two sets of data was also rooted\nin the specific socio-cultural frameworks of the research par-\nticipants. The survey was piloted with a number of potential\nparticipants who were asked to provide comments about the\nclarity of the purpose of the study, the ambiguity of the items,\nand redundancy of some questions (Bryman, 2008). No com-\nments from teachers in the pilot study were returned that\nindicated any methodological issues with the survey. The\nsurvey items were additionally reviewed by the panel of\nexperts, which added to internal validity of the research.\nLack of methodological issues with the survey had led to\nconclusions presented in this article. The research on the\nimpact of the IWE on teacher behavior presented above sug-\ngested that contextual factors and teacher socio-cultural\nframeworks are important for understanding their attitudes\ntoward work (e.g., Abu-Saad, 2003). Combined with the lack\nof methodological issues in the survey research in Bahrain, it\nis argued in this article that they are also important in under-\nstanding teacher attitudes toward research. The review of\nliterature above suggested that the IWE is an equally legiti-\nmate framework for understanding individuals' perspectives\non research (Jonathan et al., 2009), which has conceptualized\nthe aim of this article to argue that limitations of survey\nresearch in the Arabian Gulf may additionally be caused by\nthe Islamic influences on research participants.\nBelow, the selected results that show the contradictions\nbetween the survey and the focus groups data are presented.\nSurvey Data\nTables 1 to 4 present the percentages of teacher responses to\nitems related to teaching and assessing reading and writing\nskills in English.\nWithin writing strategies (Table 1), the findings imply\nthat a large number of teachers place more emphasis on\ngrammatical and mechanical aspects of language teaching,\nrather than areas related to text coherence. Trends that are\nimportant for the focus of this article can be noted in relation\nto the focus of writing, where great importance of the writing\nproduct, the writing process, and the development of ideas\nwere shown.\nSimilarly, trends shown in Table 2 with regard to assess-\ning writing indicate important conclusions in terms of the\nissues raised in this article. These are mainly related to results\nwhich show that teachers strongly emphasize marking for\ncontent, language, and style.\nTable 1. Teacher Responses (%) to Section of the Questionnaire Regarding Teaching Writing.\nQuestion: When I teach writing, I\nconcentrate on Never Very rarely Sometimes Often Always\nNote. Percentages may not equal 100 because not all teachers answered all items.\n6 SAGE Open\nTable 3 demonstrates that teachers emphasize a variety of\nreading skills. The results show that the most common read-\ning techniques practiced in Bahraini schools are based on\ngeneral understanding of texts and they include inferring\nmeaning and identifying main ideas. Table 3 also indicates\nthat teachers often use more focused methods and require the\nstudents to read for specific information and guess the mean-\ning of unknown words.\nIn terms of assessing reading (Table 4), the teachers indi-\ncated that most frequently, they ask the students to recall\ninformation from texts. They also focus on questions that\nrequire interpretation of meaning, evaluation of texts, and\ncritical analysis.\nAll the survey data presented above are quite contradic-\ntory to what emerged during the qualitative focus groups.\nThe findings below illustrate these contradictions.\nFocus Groups Data\nContrary to the results presented above, during the focus groups,\nthe teachers indicated that teaching English is based on memo-\nrizing model answers for the exam. The teacher comments\nreported here were coded using consecutive numbers--that is,\nnumber 1 was given to the teacher who spoke first, number 2 to\nthe second teacher in each school. Letters A to J were randomly\nassigned to the 10 schools visited during data collection.\nThe quotes below illustrate the contradictions with the\nsurvey data.Although only selected comments are presented,\nit needs to be highlighted that these were repeatedly made by\nmany teachers in all schools.\nThe first quote presents contradictions to the results in\nTable 1 where it was indicated that great importance is placed\non the product and process of writing, as well as coherent\ndevelopment of ideas. Teacher 3B explains that it is difficult\nto apply these techniques in Bahraini classrooms because\nstudents are only interested in memorizing model answers\nfor the exam.\nThey take the model writing from the teachers. They just need\nthe model for the exam. Yes, we provide them with the model\nwriting . . . They hate you when you try to help them and explain\nwhat should be done first and then next, they don't like that, just\ndirect monotonous way of teaching. That's it. (Teacher 3B)\nTeacher 1E additionally explained that it is also difficult\nto teach in the way indicated in the survey because it is not\nthe accepted way of teaching in Bahrain.\nThey have model answers and they learn by heart. But, to be\nfrank, it's not only the teacher; it's not the teacher's choice to do\nthat. In the past, [name] used to give us the topic that will be on\nthe exam and we used to give them a piece of writing and they\nlearnt it by heart. And the teacher who doesn't do this will be\nblamed by the students and the parents [all agree]. (Teacher 1E)\nThis way of teaching is driven by students' aspirations to\nachieve high marks in the final exam, which contradicts the\nmethods of teaching and assessing writing and reading in\nEnglish indicated in the survey:\nThey only want to study because they will have the same\nquestion in the final. They don't want extra information.\n(Teacher 1A)\nVery often they say \"Give us the writing, and that's it, we don't\nwant reading, grammar\" and so on because they focus only on\nwriting, they are learning only for tests. (Teacher 3J)\nMy students always say that we only need the writing in your\nclass because this is the thing that will be tested in the exam.\n\"We don't need to study anything else. Just give us the writing,\nwe will study and we will pass.\" (Teacher 6H)\nTable 2. Teacher Responses (%) to Section of the Questionnaire Regarding Assessing Writing.\nQuestion: When I assess my students' writing Never Very rarely Sometimes Often Always\nNote. Percentages may not equal 100 because not all teachers provided answers to all questions.\nOverall, the results from the survey indicated that various\nhigher order language skills are taught in Bahraini schools\nand that students' knowledge is assessed in a way that\nencourages critical thinking. However, the focus groups\ncomments from the same teachers who completed the survey\nregarding foreign language pedagogy suggested that learning\nof English is entirely based on memorization and that assess-\nment is based on reproduction of knowledge. This has had\nsignificant implications for the aim of this article, supporting\nthe argument about the limitations of self-reporting surveys\nin the Arabian Gulf context.\nSo, What Implications Arose From\nThese Conflicting Results?\nAs indicated at the beginning of this article, surveys are com-\nmonly used to examine \"what is\" and to describe the state of\naffairs at a specific time (Kelley et al., 2003). It is also generally\nknown that self-reporting surveys are likely to generate evalu-\nations of behavior that may be higher than the actual actions\nbecause respondents always try to create a positive image of\nthemselves (Bryman, 2008). Although this has been widely\nacknowledged, the analysis in this article indicates that social\ninfluences developed through religious affiliations may addi-\ntionally affect the ratings from self-evaluation questionnaires.\nThe concept of the cultural context as a factor in making\nresearch decisions has not been fully embraced by method-\nological researchers, which is where the discussion of the\nconflicting results from research in Bahrain in this article,\nthrough the lens of IWE, has a potential to make significant\ncontributions. This discussion indicates that the socio-\ncultural context in which the research is to be conducted\nmight play an important role in research decision making. It\nis also suggested that certain cultures might be more influen-\ntial than the others, and the use of IWE in this article to\nexplain the conflict of results substantiates the differing roles\nof \"culture effect\" on research outcomes.\nWhile seeking explanations to the conflicting results that\nwere generated in Bahrain, the significance of the IWE as the\ntheoretical framework was quite strong. Viewing the conflict\nin results through the IWE allowed for greater appreciation\nof the role of culture in research designs. The IWE is built on\nfour pillars--effort, competition, transparency, and morally\nresponsible conduct--which guide conducting business in\nIslamic societies (Ali & Al-Owaihan, 2008). Because effort\nin Islam is held in highest regard (Ali & Al-Owaihan, 2008,\np.13), it provides a plausible explanation of why the contra-\ndictions between survey and focus groups data occurred. It\nsuggests that the conflict in results could be related to the\nself-rating nature of the survey which was based on teachers'\nTable 3.

If\nIslam praises those who work hard to achieve the desired\ngoals (Ali & Al-Owaihan, 2008), it is possible that the teach-\ners overrated their classroom behavior. It is also possible that\nif the survey was based on the ratings from, for instance,\ntheir reporting bodies, the biases in the Bahraini research\ncould have been avoided.\nJonathan et al. (2009) state that, generally, it is quite common\nthat self-ratings of what teachers do in the classroom tend to be\nmuch higher compared with the actual pedagogical behavior.\nThey also state that it is particularly common in teaching com-\nmunities such as Bahrain because of the IWE where \"the value\nof work in the IWE is derived from the accompanying inten-\ntions rather than from the result of work\" (p. 268). This is why\n\"Bahraini teachers seem to engage in more self-promoting to\nensure what they indicated in the rating scales were reflective of\nnot necessarily mean that they do not teach according to the\nexpected levels but that their self-evaluation is primarily based\non the long-term objectives of their work.\nIt was already explained in the background section of this\narticle that Bahraini teachers are under a lot of pressure con-\nnectedwiththenewschoolimprovementprogram(Directorate\nof Government School Reviews, 2014). It was also explained\nthat, for English teachers, this improvement brought about a\nnew teaching reform based on the CLT approach (Al-Baharna,\n2005). The items of the survey discussed in this article there-\nfore matched many of the CLT techniques because the inten-\ntion of the study in Bahrain was to describe the status of this\nreform in local schools. It is therefore possible that the teach-\ners who completed the survey recognized these items and\noverrated their behavior in the classroom, acting in their self-\ninterest (Jonathan et al., 2009). It is also possible that the\nteachers did it because they thought that the survey was eval-\nuating whether they were doing what they were supposed to\ndo and, as explained earlier in the literature review, they per-\nhaps thought that the research was going to give them some\nkind of distinction (IBE & NIER, 1995). However, during the\nfollow-up focus group sessions, when the teachers were asked\nto elaborate more on the difficulties caused by the context in\nwhich they were teaching, they were able to reveal the truth\nbecause they perhaps thought that the research could result in,\nfor example, reducing some of the teaching pressures.\nKabasakal and Bodur (2002) argue that at times of diffi-\nculty, Arab societies come together due to their socially\ningrained group loyalty and collective group support.\nThomas (2008) explains that this loyalty is also translated to\nfocus groups where participants \"stand together\" to discuss a\nresearch problem, which is why focus groups participants are\nmore likely to reveal the truth. Therefore, while the reflec-\ntions in this article indicate that the societal values of Arabs\nin the Gulf affect survey designs in social research in a nega-\ntive way, the same values seem to play a positive role in stud-\nies based on focus groups. Thomas (2008) argues that the use\nof focus groups in social research is suitable for researchers\nwho engage in exploring Arab cultures because the social\ncollectivity that characterizes Arab people is extremely perti-\nnent to this form of interviewing. According to Thomas\n(2008), trust between in-group members in Arab cultures is\nseen as central to conducting group investigations, which, in\nturn, allows for cultural values and beliefs of the researched\nto have some breathing space. The broader experiences of\nconducting focus groups research in Bahrain, which are not\nreported along the results in this article due to its focus on the\nconflict between survey and its related focus group data, sup-\nport this view in that they show real contributions to knowl-\nedge as a result of the collective perspective on social practice\nFinally, the fact that the school teachers were aware that\nthis research was approved by the Ministry of Education\nmight have led the teachers to believe that it was looking to\nevaluate how the programs in Bahrain were taught. This, on\none hand, might be related to reflexivity, which is commonly\nacknowledged in social research, but, on the other, it might\nalso stem from the strong influences of the IWE. Effort in the\nIWE is held in the highest regard (Ali & Al-Owaihan, 2008),\nwhich invariably involves constant evaluations of self. The\nreport on the perceptions of research in Bahrain cited in the\nliterature review (IBE & NIER, 1995) also explained that\nteachers are likely to take part in studies that will show their\nefforts and bring them rewards for their hard work. Therefore,\nit is possible that they viewed the research discussed in this\narticle as an opportunity to earn some credit, which is why\nthey might have rated their performance very highly.\nConclusion\nOverrated participant behavior is quite common in survey\nresearch; however, the important conclusion that emerged\nhere was that these ratings may vary depending on the cul-\ntural context of research participants. Jonathan et al.'s (2009)\nresearch cited earlier supports this by demonstrating differ-\nences in self-evaluations of professional behavior between\nAsian and Bahraini teachers, who were influenced by differ-\nent orientations on their work. It is therefore possible that if\nthe research discussed in this article was conducted in the\nAsian context, fewer contradictions would have been found\nbetween the survey and the focus groups data.\nThe important implications from the discussion of the\nresearch results from Bahrain in this article are that we ought to\nconsider the deeper values of the culture we are researching in\nour decision making regarding research methods. It has been\nargued here, mainly through the analysis of the impact of the\nIWE on teacher behavior and attitudes toward work, that socio-\ncultural frameworks of research participants can create biases\nin survey research. The discussion in this article indicated this\nby examining how cultural beliefs can create an influence on\nthe type of data that is normally produced through the use of\nstandard surveys. Surveys are used in social science to describe\n\"what is\" (Bryman, 2008), which is why a descriptive survey\nwas also designed to examine the situation of English language\neducation in Bahrain. The strong societal beliefs of teachers,\nhowever, influenced by the IWE, seemed to have had a signifi-\ncant impact on generating specific data. The analysis also sug-\ngested that these influences were perhaps even stronger than\nthe methodological assumptions underlying survey research.\nThis has significant implications for building designs of\nresearch studies in Islamic context where religiously shaped\nviews on self-evaluations, work, and performance may affect\nthe adequacy of specific research methods.\nThus, the main recommendations from the analysis pre-\nsented in this article are that researchers develop a deep\nunderstanding of the culture in which the research is to be\nconducted. The reflections presented here have indicated the\nneed to do this, specifically for the survey research. The dis-\ncussion in this article provided evidence which implies that\nsocietal beliefs should be considered equally with any philo-\nsophical, theoretical, and methodological assumptions in\nresearch design decision making.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAbu-Saad, I.
