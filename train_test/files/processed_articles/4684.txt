We document the adaptation process and establish the validity and reliability of the Attitudes Toward Suicide\n(ATTS) questionnaire among 262 healthcare personnel in 2 major public hospitals in the Klang Valley, Malaysia. The findings\nindicate that healthcare personnel in Malaysia have unique constructs on suicide attitude, compared with the original study\non a Western European sample. The adapted Malay ATTS questionnaire demonstrates adequate reliability and validity for\nuse among healthcare personnel in Malaysia.\n",

The second version of the ATTS questionnaire\nis composed of 37 items, scored on a 5-point Likert\nscale incorporating \"Strongly Disagree,\" \"Disagree,\"\n\"Undecided,\" \"Agree,\" and \"StronglyAgree.\" The responses\nwere coded as \"Strongly Disagree\" = 1 to \"Strongly Agree\"\n= 5, except for items 4 and 6, which were reverse coded.

The subject-matter\nexperts were a public health specialist (forward translation)\nand a psychiatrist (backward translation). To ensure content\nvalidity, a harmonization meeting was held to combine the\n2 versions of the translated questionnaire, comprising of a\nmultidisciplinary team of psychiatric, psychological,\nbehavioral science, public health, and linguistic experts.\nThe adaptation process took into account factors of barriers\nin linguistics comprehension, contextualized meaning\nattached to a construct, and possible interpretations of the\ntranslated instrument.35\nTwo pilot studies were conducted on the translated\ninstrument. Through a convenience sampling from 2 pub-\nlic hospitals, the authors recruited 51 and 49 healthcare\npersonnel for each pilot study, respectively. After review-\ning the results of the first pilot study, improvements were\nmade to items with low corrected item-total correlation,\nwhich contributed to the low total Cronbach's . A second\npilot study was implemented to test the improved ques-\ntionnaire, and, compared with the first version of the trans-\nlated questionnaire, yielded a higher total Cronbach's  of\n0.53. The Malay ATTS questionnaire was finalized for fur-\nther validation with a larger sample.\nPhase II: Validation Process\nParticipants.To validate a questionnaire, between 2 and 20\nparticipants.38 In this study, assuming that 8 participants are\nneeded per item, with a drop-out rate of 10%, 325 partici-\npants were targeted for recruitment.\nFor inclusion criteria, the following core medical and sur-\ngical departments were selected: general medical, general\nsurgery, accident and emergency, obstetrics and gynecology,\npediatrics, orthopedics, and psychiatry. Doctors, nurses,\nassistant medical officers, and medical attendant professions\nwere included. All participants were Malaysians, but trainees\nwere excluded from the study.\nProcedures.Participants were randomly sampled based on\nthe sampling frame with the names of all staff from the\nrelated professions and departments. Participation was vol-\nuntary, and strict confidentiality was maintained with no\nidentifier being used in the questionnaires. After giving\ninformed consent, participants filled out the questionnaire,\nconsisting of the Malay ATTS and demographic information,\nsuch as age, gender, race, religion, marital status, occupation,\neducation, department, years of service, number of suicidal\npatients cared for, and training in the management of suicidal\npatients. The participants returned the questionnaires within\na week, sealed in an envelope.\nStatistical analyses. Statistical analyses were conducted using\nthe Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS; version\n23) and the Analysis of Model Structures (AMOS; version\n20). Confirmatory factor analyses, involving principal com-\nponents analysis (PCA) extraction and promax rotation, were\nused to assess the construct validity of the MalayATTS ques-\ntionnaire. Ten- and 11-factor models were tested based on the\nfactor loading were excluded from further analysis.\nModel fit indices were employed in a confirmatory fac-\ntor analysis. This included chi-square-value/degree of\nTucker-Lewis index (TLI  0.95),40 parsimonious normed\nfit index (PNFI  0.50),41 root mean square error of approx-\nimation (RMSEA < 0.05),42 and test of RMSEA signifi-\noverall internal consistency of the scale and its subscales.\nItems that contributed to low  coefficients were excluded\nfrom further analysis.\nApprovals. This research obtained ethical approval from the\nMedical Research and Ethics Committee, Ministry of Health\nCommittee, National University of Malaysia (NN-035-\n2015). The authors complied with the required ethical stan-\nSiau et al 3\nResults\nParticipant Characteristics\nThere were 325 randomly selected participants. The final\nsample size for this validation was 262 participants (80.6%),\ndue to missing data. The researchers did not rectify incom-\nplete samples, due to confidentiality and the absence of\nidentifiers in the responses. Participants' demographics are\nlisted in Table 1.\nValidity Analysis\nThe minimum amount of data required for factor analysis\nwas met, with more than 7 cases per questionnaire item.\nFactorization, through the use of PCA using promax rotation,\nrevealed an acceptable Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sam-\npling adequacy (KMO = 0.73), which is above the recom-\nmended value of 0.60. Bartlett's test of sphericity was\nanti-image correlation matrix of all items were above 0.50,\nthus supporting the inclusion of each item in the factor analy-\nsis. In addition, the communalities for all items were above\n0.40 (see Table 2), suggesting reasonable factorability. Given\nthese overall indicators, factor analysis was performed on all\n37 items of the Malay ATTS questionnaire.\nPCA examined the solutions for 10 and 11 factors using\npromax rotation. The initial 11-factor solution was preferred,\nas it explained a higher percentage of cumulative variance\nand more items with insufficient primary loadings (>0.40)\nwere found for the 10-factor solution.\nFigure 1. Workflow of the translation, cross-cultural adaptation, and validation process of the English ATTS to the adapted Malay\nNote. ATTS = Attitudes Toward Suicide.\nPCA was conducted again on the 11-factor solution using\npromax rotation after eliminating 7 items from further\nanalysis due to (1) primary factor loadings of less than 0.40\ncient in the subfactors (items 4, 6, 22, and 35). The results\nrevealed that the 11 factors explained 63.24% of the variance.\nAll items had primary loadings above 0.40 (see Table 2).\nConfirmatory factor analysis was performed to test the\nmodel fit for the 11-factor solution, and compare it with the\n10-factor solution. The results demonstrate that both models\nmodel also demonstrated a goodness-of-fit according to the\nto meet the cutoff values required for NFI and TLI indices\n(see Table 3).\nReliability Analysis\nThe Cronbach's  for the domains ranged from 0.32 to\n0.76. The overall Cronbach's  for the adapted Malay\nATTS questionnaire was 0.72 (see Table 4), thus indicating\nthat these items measured the same construct or content.46\nDescriptive analysis of the questionnaire's items and fac-\ntors is shown in Table 4. The least endorsed item was\n\"People do have the right to take their own lives,\" while\nthe most endorsed item was \"It is a human duty to try to\nstop someone from committing suicide.\" Items 7, 10, 11,\ndents choosing the \"Undecided\" option.\nDiscussion\nThe study findings demonstrate that healthcare personnel\nmay have different categorical constructs on suicide com-\na milestone in the development of a suicide attitude question-\nnaire in Malaysia.\nIn terms of its validity, the item loadings of the adapted\n11-factor Malay ATTS questionnaire varied widely from pre-\nvious studies. Constructs in the adapted Malay ATTS ques-\ntionnaire suggest a distinctive health care viewpoint on\nsuicide attitude, when compared with studies tested on a\nWestern European general population,24 and college students\nwho make suicidal threats seldom complete suicide\" and\n\"Those who talk about suicide will not do it\" were grouped\nunder the \"Common/Normal\" factor in the original ATTS\nquestionnaire, but emerged as a distinctive factor in the\nadapted Malay ATTS questionnaire under \"Believability of\nSuicide Threats.\" This may reflect on the experience and\ndecisions that healthcare personnel need to undertake when\nencountering suicidal patients, compared with the general\npopulation. The factors \"Acceptability of Assisted Suicide,\"\n\"The Nature of Suicidal Ideation,\" and \"Duty to Prevent and\nMental Illness\" also emerged to indicate issues that surround\nthe health care establishment.\nTable 1.

The factor \"Loneliness and Avoidance\" may be\nindicative of isolation and the taboo surrounding suicide in\nMalaysia, especially among Muslims,33,34 who comprised\nthemajorityofrespondents.Thefactor\"AbilitytoUnderstand\nand Accept Suicide\" in the adapted Malay ATTS question-\nnaire merged items from the \"Resignation\" and \"Right to\nSuicide\" factors in the original ATTS questionnaire. This\nmay indicate that those who disagreed with the right to sui-\ncide could also be less understanding toward suicidal\npatients'reasons for wanting to die. Further explorations into\nthe right-to-die issue are important, as healthcare personnel\nwho expressed a permissive right-to-die attitude reported\nless competency in suicide-related interventions48 and were\nassociated with personal factors, such as suicide ideation his-\nConfirmatory factor analysis yielded mixed findings,\nwhere requirements for absolute fit indices, such as 2/df,\nRMSEA, and PCLOSE, were met, but the cutoff values rec-\nommended for relative fit indices, such as TLI and NFI, were\nnot. This may be due to the relatively large number of\nvariables51 resulting in poor fit values. The multidimensional\nnature of suicide attitudes24 may also contribute to this.\nIn terms of reliability analysis, the adapted questionnaire\ndemonstrated an acceptable overall Cronbach's  of more\nthan 0.70, thus indicating the internal reliability of the instru-\nment. When compared with Salander Renberg and\nJacobsson24 and Ji et al,29 the Cronbach's  value was slightly\nhigher. However, there was a large variation in the internal\nconsistency of factors, ranging from 0.32 to 0.76. This varia-\ntion also surfaced in other suicide attitude instruments (e.g.,\net al29), suggesting that attitude toward suicide could be a\nhighly sensitive issue resulting in conflicting and varied\nresponses from participants,24 especially in a cultural setting\nwhere suicide is stigmatized.47\nFinally, analysis of response proportions to each item\nrevealed that 8 items consisted of at least one-fifth of the\nparticipants choosing the \"Undecided\" option. Response\nfatigue, or low motivation, could be ruled out as the reason,\nbecause the position of these items ranged from the\nSiau et al 7\nbeginning, middle, and end of the questionnaire.54 Perhaps\nhealthcare personnel in this study felt a lack of knowledge or\ninformation to assess the believability level of a suicidal\npatient's communication (items 12 and 33) and the private\nexperienced a conflict between sympathizing with a termi-\nnally ill patient's wish to die and disagreement with the right\nto die (item 32), or were ambivalent about suicide as a taboo\ntopic for discussion (item 23).\nStrengths and Limitations\nAs the first study in Malaysia to cross-culturally adapt and\nvalidate a suicide attitude questionnaire, this study demon-\nstrated methodological vigor by employing random sam-\npling to ensure representativeness of the data. Participants'\nheterogeneity was also achieved, as is attested by the partici-\npants' age range, department, occupation, and experience in\nthe health care sector and in handling suicidal patients.As for\nits limitations, the drop-out rate and missing data could have\ncontributed to the response bias, which was not examined.\nNearly half of the respondents were inexperienced in manag-\ning suicidal patients; therefore, their attitudes may not be\nshaped by concrete encounters with suicidal individuals.\nHowever, we still consider their responses to be valid, as atti-\ntudes could constitute preconceived ideas, which may or\nmay not be modified by experience. This study focused on\nhealthcare personnel from 2 general hospitals, while provid-\ners from community and private settings were not repre-\nsented. Future studies employing different settings and target\ngroups are needed to further explore and improve the psy-\nchometric rigor of the adapted MalayATTS questionnaire, so\nthat comparisons can be made.\nConclusion\nThe adapted Malay ATTS questionnaire demonstrated ade-\nquate psychometric properties for use among healthcare\nTable 4.
