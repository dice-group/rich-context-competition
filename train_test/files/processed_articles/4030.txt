    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article describes the context and development of the new Nurse Practitioner Standards for Practice in Australia, which\nwent into effect in January 2014. The researchers used a mixed-methods design to engage a broad range of stakeholders who\nbrought both political and practice knowledge to the development of the new standards. Methods included interviews, focus\ngroups, surveys, and work-based observation of nurse practitioner practice. Stakeholders varied in terms of their need for\ndetail in the standards. Nonetheless, they invariably agreed that the standards should be clinically focussed attributes. The\npillars common in many advanced practice nursing standards, such as practice, research, education, and leadership, were\ncombined and expressed in a new and unique clinical attribute.\n",

The NMBA commissioned the drafting of the\nsecond version of the Standards for Practice for the\nNurse Practitioner (NP) in 2012, with the aim of revising\nthe standards to reflect contemporary and actual prac-\ntice. The authors of this article constituted the team\ninvolved in the development of the NP standards. We\npresent it here as an example of policy formation in\nwhich policy makers (NMBA) translated their visions\nof NP practice into a format that guides delivery of\ncare to achieve desired population outcomes (Smith-\n1School of Health and Human Sciences, Southern Cross University,\nLismore, NSW, Australia\n2Sydney Nursing School, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia\n3University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia\n4Nurse Practitioner Standards Review Project, Sydney Nursing School,\nUniversity of Sydney, NSW, Australia\n5Flinders Human Behaviour & Health Research Unit, Flinders University,\nAdelaide, South Australia, Australia\n6Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, Melbourne, Victoria,\nAustralia\n7Health Care Consumers' Association, Canberra, ACT, Australia\n8Australian College of Nurse Practitioners, Sydney, NSW, Australia\n9Aged and Community Services Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia\n10Faculty of Engineering, Health, Science and the Environment, Charles\nDarwin University, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nAndrew Cashin, School of Health and Human Sciences, Southern Cross\nUniversity, Rifle Range Road, Lismore, NSW, 2480, Australia.\nEmail: andrew.cashin@scu.edu.au\nPolicy, Politics, & Nursing Practice\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nppn.sagepub.com\nPolicy making can be framed as a drama that includes\na synthesis of evidence to make plausible arguments\n(Greenhalgh & Russell, 2006). The evidence required to\nform effective policies includes, but is not limited to,\nresults of empirical studies (Bernier & Clavier, 2011).\nSuccessful policy formation can also be based on synthe-\nsis of evidence developed through the three lenses of pol-\nitical knowledge, research-based knowledge, and field\nexperience (Head, 2008). This article draws from evi-\ndence in each of these lenses. The evidence that guided\nour development of the NP standards included a review\nof the literature, interviews with policy stakeholders,\nfocus groups with consumers, public consultation, and\nwork-based observation of NP practice. We first ana-\nlyzed findings from these different sources of evidence\nand then synthesized the findings with a focus on revising\nthe NP standards.\nThe health policy triangle, which emphasizes the inter-\naction of context, process, and content in forming health\npolicy (Walt & Gibson, 1994), provides the framework\nfor this research. Policy has multiple dimensions; this\narticle presents the outcomes that one might use to evalu-\nate the NP standards' success, failure, and effectiveness\nBackground\nCredentialing for advanced practice nursing (APN)\nvaries among nations. Pulcini, Jelic, Gul, and Loke\nrecognized the NP or APN role (Pulcini et al., 2010). Of\nsure maintenance, registration, or renewal (Pulcini et al.,\n2010). International definitions of advanced nursing prac-\ntice (ANP) identify characteristics of advanced practice,\nexpanded scope of practice, generality or specificity of\npractice, and sometimes the level of education required\n(e.g., master's degree; Stasa, Cashin, Buckley, &\nContext\nIn Australia, NP is a regulated title requiring endorse-\nment by the NMBA. Applicants who have completed an\napproved and required master's education programs of\nstudy and can document 5,000 hours of advanced prac-\ntice are eligible to apply for endorsement as NPs. NMBA\nstaffs assess the applications against the Australian NP\nStandards for Practice to determine a candidate's eligi-\nbility for NP endorsement (Nursing and Midwifery\nThe first National Competency Standards for the NP\n(now replaced by the Australian NP Standards for\nPractice) were commissioned by the Australian and\nNursing Midwifery Council (ANMC) and published in\ntime, 15 NPs participated in the research and development\nof the initial NP competencies. Although the number of\nNPs endorsed at the time of the release of the new stand-\nIn Australia, one set of NP standards is used for a\nrange of regulatory, educational, employment, and\nmonitoring purposes, irrespective of an NP's specialty,\npopulation focus, or geographic locale. The standards\nalso guide the development of curricula for NP master's\neducation programs (Australian Nursing and Midwifery\nCouncil [ANMC], 2009). Additionally, standards assist\nNPs in defining and validating their individual scopes of\npractice. Standards also enable evaluation of individual\nNP performance and inform other professionals and\nhealth consumers about NPs' capabilities and scopes of\npractice. The multipurpose NP standards in Australia\nmean that revision required a generic approach to con-\ntent rather than a practice specialty or population focus.\nWith this in mind, the major aim of the research project\ndescribed in this article was to analyze the gap between\nAustralia's existing 2004 National Competency\nStandards for the NP and actual NP practice. A\nsecond aim was to use a structured consultative and\niterative process to develop a provisional set of revised\nAustralian NP Standards for Practice.\nThe project consisted of three distinct phases: (a)\nliterature review, consultation, and synthesis; (b) gap\nanalysis and public consultation; and (c) validation of\nthe revised standards (see Figure 1). Each phase had a\ndistinct purpose and set of methods and built iteratively\non the findings of the preceding one. Phases 1 and 2\nencompassed ongoing engagement of stakeholders;\nPhase 3 was designed to ensure that the developed stand-\nards were applicable to actual NP practice. Although the\nresearch team conducted an extensive literature review to\ninform the process, Phases 1 and 2 largely refer to the\nwork conducted through the lenses of political know-\nledge, and practical and professional field experience\nThe institutional Human Research Ethics committees\nof both the University of Sydney and Southern Cross\nUniversity approved the study. The validation phase of\nthe project was undertaken in all of Australia's six states\nand two territories.\nPhase 1: Literature Review, Consultation,\nand Synthesis\nThe first phase--consultation and synthesis--consisted\nof a literature review, telephone interviews, and focus\ngroups. The literature review covered peer-reviewed\nin Australian and international publications, with special\nreference to countries with an identifiable NP role.\nTopics surveyed included NP role, scope of practice,\ncompetency and standards, and legal requirements. The\nterms advanced practice nursing, advanced nursing prac-\ntice, scope of practice, and extended practice were\nsearched separately in CINAHL, Medline, and\nPubMed online databases. The pearl-growing strategy\nwas utilized, where lists of references were searched to\nlocate additional articles not picked up in the original\nsearch (Harter, 1986). The research team also reviewed\nvariations in practice among jurisdictions (e.g., national\nand state) or sectors (e.g., public health system and pri-\nmary care), the impact of employment arrangements on\nrole and scope of practice, and relevant legislation and\nregulations. The results of the review were published sep-\narately (Stasa et al., 2014). The major finding was the\ngreat variability in the use of basic terms related to\nadvanced practice in nursing internationally and at\ntimes within countries. This imprecise use of language\nhas promoted confusion within the profession and the\npublic at large.\nThe second part of Phase 1 consisted of 17 1-hr\ntelephone interviews with six chief nurses, five profes-\nsional officers in state and territory health departments,\nand six AHPRA staff from South Australia, Western\nAustralia, Queensland, Victoria, and New South\nWales. The sample consisted of those who responded\nto a formal invitation to all state and territory depart-\nments to participate. The interviews sought information\non how the existing NP standards were used, particular\nchallenges with any item or wording, components of the\nexisting standards that should be retained, and changes\nto improve the standards' usability. All interviews were\naudiotaped and transcribed for subsequent analysis.\nAnother data source during this first phase was a\nworking group discussion among 48 NPs who responded\nto an invitation to participate at the annual Australian\nCollege of Nurse Practitioners conference in 2012.\nA research team member facilitated smaller groups,\nundertaking a detailed examination of each standard,\nits wording, and identification of content potentially\nrequiring revision. The subgroups reported their feed-\nback to the whole group for broad discussion concerning\nthe recommended changes.\nPhase 1 Findings\nFindings from interviews and focus groups with relevant\nstakeholders revealed five key themes: (a) use of lan-\nguage, (b) level of behaviors, (c) expression of attributes\nin guiding NP behaviors, (d) use of the standards, and (e)\nscope of NP practice. Each of these findings is discussed\nin more detail, below.\nUse of language for NP standards. Informants reported that\nthe standards required modernization and rewording, so\nthat consumers and others, such as clinicians and health\nadministrators, could clearly understand them. Feedback\nFigure 1. Phases of the development of the Nurse Practitioner Standards of Practice Australia project.\nfrom one NP, who expressed the sentiments of many\nothers, indicated that the language was \"too wordy,\nvague and unclear in places and a number of the compe-\ntencies are repeated.\" Interviewees who utilized the\nstandards to determine suitability to practice reported\nthat the existing standards lacked clarity as some word-\ning was difficult to understand. Some participants\nreported that use of the word autonomous in the stand-\nards was problematic, particularly for professionals in\nother disciplines who think that nursing should be part\nof a collaborative arrangement of patient care.\nThe notion of collaboration was important to many\nNPs who considered they made decisions within a team.\nHowever, these views were not unanimous, and other\nparticipants expressed that there should be a focus on\nthe independent and autonomous role of the NP. Some\nNPs considered that language used obscured other\nhealth professionals' understanding of the NP role,\nwhich potentially made certain NP practices (like\nprescribing and referrals) unnecessarily challenging.\nThe references to a nursing model in the previous stand-\nards were reported as not clearly understood as what this\nmeant was not clearly articulated.\nInterpretation of the level of behaviors in the\nstandards. Interviewees responsible for evaluating\napplications for NP endorsement asserted that appli-\ncants generally provided insufficient evidence of\nadvanced practice behavior, particularly in the attributes\nof leadership, education, and research. Interviewees also\nreported that applicants demonstrated knowledge gaps\nin what constituted advanced practice evidence. They\nsuggested that the standards needed to clearly distinguish\nthe difference between NP and registered nurse (RN)\npractice, which in turn will guide NP candidates.\nParticipants suggested that standards needed to accom-\nmodate the reality that an NP might be an expert in one\narea but not others. Most members of the NP focus\ngroup suggested that the standards needed to articulate\nthe knowledge requirements for working as an NP.\nIt was suggested that NPs may have skills in the same\nareas as RNs (e.g., clinical, research, ethics), but the level\nof knowledge of the NP must be more comprehensive,\nfar-reaching, detailed, and sophisticated.\nExpression of attributes to guide NP behaviors. Several inter-\nviewees responsible for policy formation and implemen-\ntation commented that some components of the NP role\nwere not clearly expressed in the previous standards.\nLeadership was considered to be challenging for NPs\nto demonstrate, even within their own organization.\nNP participants also expressed that clinical leadership\nwas a key aspect of the role. Other interviewees asserted\nthat some NPs have difficulty articulating their role to\nother health professionals and that they lack political\nastuteness and a working understanding of legal require-\nments. The evolved standards were seen as necessary to\ncreate an organizing framework for representing current\nNP clinical practice.\nNurse leaders recommended that research require-\nments be elucidated more clearly. They suggested that\nthe interpretation of research in the revised standards\nincludes clinical audit and highlighted the importance\nof NPs assuming responsibility for self-auditing their\npractice. The leaders relayed the need for NPs to under-\nstand the healthcare system's funding and financial\nstructures.\nFocus group participants also discussed the import-\nance of NPs as educators. Most clarified that this meant\nserving as role models and mentors to other nurses and\nhealth professionals, as opposed to referring only to\ndidactic classroom-based academic education.\nUse of the standards by NPs. Study participants agreed that\nstandards and competencies are useful guidelines for\ndetermining minimum expectations for novice NPs and\nthat with experience in the new NP scope, their practice\nwill develop beyond the minimum standards.\nParticipants stated that consistency in practice was\nimportant to give consumers confidence in NP practice\ncapabilities.\nMany NP focus group participants said that the\nstandards are important as a framework for their scope\nof practice, but as one NP said they did not use them, on\na day-to-day basis. Some of the NPs suggested that a\nmove from the abstract organizing pillars of the previous\nstandards to more clinically focussed standards was\ndesirable.\nScope of practice. There was general consensus that NP\napplicants need a set of agreed core attributes for use\nby all NPs, whatever their specialty. Some participants\nadvised that these generalist NP standards should build\non the NMBA RN standards with the addition of NP-\nspecific competencies. One NP commented that, \"NPs\nshould have a generalist capacity within their specialty\"\nand that \"if standards are too fixed they will quickly\nbecome outdated given the shortage of health workforce\nstaff that is predicted for the future.\" A strong theme\nemerged from the interviews that NPs were, in fact, not\nnecessarily more specialized in their practice than RNs\nbut indeed were specialists who had built up a broad\ngeneralist base.\nAnother key theme identified from interviewees was\nthe difficulties NPs had in providing evidence of\nadvanced practice and that to facilitate the process def-\ninitional clarity was needed between ANP and APN,\nterms sometimes used interchangeably and other times\nwith discrete difference (Stasa et al., 2014). Following\ncompletion of Phase 1, the authors, based on findings\nfrom the literature review, the telephone interviews, and\nthe NP working group, developed the revised draft\nstandards.\nPhase 2: Gap Analysis and Public Consultation\nPhase 2 focused on the revised draft of the standards\nundertaken through interviews and focus groups. The\nsame stakeholders as in Phase 1 were included, augmented\nby academics (Australian Council of Deans of Nursing\nand Midwifery), a sample of 32 healthcare consumers\nand a 10-week public consultation.\nConsumer and Carer Focus Groups\nSix health consumer focus groups were conducted in\nurban and rural locations across Australia, including\nWestern Australia, New South Wales, Queensland,\nCanberra, and South Australia. Thirty-two consumers\nparticipated for approximately 1 hr in group discussions\nfacilitated by a project team member.\nSeveral weeks before each focus group was scheduled,\nparticipants were sent a copy of the revised standards.\nThis approach was taken to provide participants\nsufficient time to review the provisional standards and\nidentify words or concepts that were problematic prior\nto the group session. Participants' responses to prompt\nquestions were audiotaped for three focus groups and\nrecorded by hand-written notes for the other three\ngroups. These six focus groups explored participants'\nknowledge of the role of the NP based on what was\nwritten in the standards. This included their understand-\ning of the language used, identification of whether they\nwould use the services of an NP, and reasons for their\ndecision. Using an inductive process, the data were the-\nmatically analyzed by the research team (Hsieh &\nShannon, 2005). Team members individually analyzed\nthe notes and electronic data from the six groups. The\nteam then collated shared findings. Some themes were\nmerged and others collapsed as they became redundant.\nThe team then reanalyzed the information to look for\ndata that affirmed or disrupted the thematic analysis.\nThe process of analysis continued until consensus was\nreached.\nKey Findings From Consumer Focus Groups\nWhen consumers were asked if they knew what an NP\nwas, the majority were unsure. A few did know about the\nNP role because they had used walk-in clinics managed\nby NPs in Australia. However, most did not understand\nthe difference between different titles of nurses (specific-\nally NPs, practice nurses, registered or enrolled nurses;\nsee Table 4), even though some participants said they\nknew which tasks nurses working in general\npractitioner's clinics undertook. Generally, participants\ncould not explain the difference between the practice\nnurse and the NP. Additionally, participants did not\nknow whether the practice nurse was a registered or\nenrolled nurse.\nConsumer focus group participants thought that the\nNP role as described in the standards would be most\nuseful in rural and remote locations or in after-hour set-\ntings, in which physician access was poor. However,\nwhen consumers were questioned further about the NP\nrole, some did not know that an NP could order diag-\nnostic tests and interpret the results. One participant\nsaid, \"NPs are like the nurses in the United States of\nAmerica who can diagnose and treat people.\" Some par-\nticipants were unaware that an NP service operated in\ntheir locale. Most participants did not know that NPs\ncould prescribe medication within their scope of practice\nand refer patients to other services. Some said they\nwould have used the NP services if they had known.\nConsumer group participants stated that if consumers\nare to use the standards, then the language needs to be\neasily understood. Another point that consumers made\nwas that NPs need to detail and promote their work to\nthe public and clarify what NPs do that differentiates\nthem from RNs.\nAlong with the need for plain and unambiguous lan-\nguage, focus group participants expressed how standards\nneeded to move from the abstract organizational frame\nof leadership, research, education, and practice, to a\nmore concrete clinically applicable format that repre-\nsented NP interactions with patients.\nConsultation and Feedback\nTwo types of consultation were conducted by the\nauthors to receive feedback on the next draft of the\nstandards: a month-long preliminary consultation with\nemployees and key NMBA stakeholders; followed by a\n10-week public consultation using a structured response\nsurvey. A limited amount of feedback (responses n \u00bc 10)\nwas received from the internal the AHPRA consultation.\nThe key feedback points were:\n. Strengthen areas such as professional development,\neducation/teaching, leadership, and research. One\nrespondent commented that within the professional,\neducation, and teaching realm, NPs should meet the\nregistration requirement for their own continuing pro-\nfessional development. Another respondent suggested,\n\"a nurse at this level should be teaching others, speak-\ning at professional forums, conferences and contribut-\ning to the teaching of undergraduates, newly graduated\nnurses, and nurses developing specialty skills.\"\n. Within the leadership domain, it was suggested that\nNPs be active in professional associations and forums\nand contribute to the development of policy, proced-\nure, and practice guidelines for the profession.\nAnother recommendation was that NPs contribute\nto maintenance of standards by participation in pro-\nfessional and registration/regulation bodies through\nprovision of advice, taking on a membership role in\nstandards committees, tribunals, and panels. It was\nalso suggested that NPs participate in community\nforums and awareness relating to health issues.\n. In addition to the level being sufficient to meet the NP\nStandard of Practice envisaged by respondents from\nhealth departments, other feedback suggested that the\ndefinition of APN as a legislated/protected title for\nNPs was problematic because nurses with advanced\nnursing could also be leading clinical teams and\nshould not be excluded from the title of APN, even\nthough their position titles are not regulated, and their\npractice is within the RN scope. Comments reflected a\nconflation of ANP in the RN scope, demonstrated in\nRN positions such as Clinical Nurse Consultant and\nits relationship to the NP. Feedback was inconsistent\nand sometimes appeared confused in understanding\nof definitions of advanced practice. The issue of the\nuse of standards in assessing suitability for endorse-\nment and the need for clarity in the standards and\naccompanying definitions were articulated. Several\nparticipants highlighted the lack of clarity regarding\nANP and confusion with APN making endorsement\nprocess a nightmare and open to subjective interpret-\nation. The internal consultation identified two key\nissues: some debate about perception of the standards\nas setting a minimum rather than maximum level; and\nthe operational definition of advanced practice, which\nremained contentious and in need of clarification.\nFollowing the Australian Health Practitioners\nRegulation Agency preliminary consultation, the draft\nstandards were made available for broader stakeholder/\npublic feedback. Although 152 separate responses were\nreceived, the number of responses varied for different\nstatements and cues. The average number of responses\nper Statement was 42. Responses were primarily related\nto individual wording as opposed to the need for\nconceptual revision. While some respondents proposed\nmore nuanced language, others requested further simpli-\nfication of language.\nPhase 3: Validation of the Revised Standards\nThe third and final phase was observation of NPs at\nwork. This phase was conducted through the lens of sci-\nentific and technical analysis (Head, 2008). It involved a\nstratified sample of 35 NPs from diverse locales in\nAustralia. This was the first Australian study to use a\nrepresentative stratified sample of NPs. NP practice was\ncompared with the fourth draft version of the standards\nto validate the standards' content. It also informed the\nfifth and final version of the standards.\nThe three major criteria for NP selection in this phase\nwere as follows: (a) their location in a state or territory\nbased on proportionate representation of NPs in all\nstates and territories; (b) whether they worked in an\nurban, regional, or remote location based on the\nMeasuring Remoteness: Accessibility/Remoteness Index\nof Australia (ARIA; Commonwealth Department of\nHealth and Aged Care, 2001) classification of their post-\ncode; and (c) their practice specialty (b and c determined\nproportionately; see Tables 1 to 3). Observers were either\nmembers of the research team or NPs trained to use\nthe observation instrument. Each NP was observed\nundertaking a routine day of practice. Observers noted\nbehaviors in a structured observation tool based on the\ndraft standards. Three types of observation evidence\nwere sought for each standard. They were as follows:\n(a) observations of behavior, (b) the NP speaking\nopenly about a process that was not visible to the obser-\nver (modus operandi thinking), and (c) artifacts or\ndocumented evidence, including teaching appointments,\npublished journal articles, and research projects.\nThe following are the key findings from the observa-\ntions: (a) all standards were visible in 97% of NPs observed;\n(b) 86% of the standard cues were observed or evidenced in\nmore than 80% of participants; (c) a high variance in levels\nof NP practice from novice to experienced existed,\nTable 1.

The validation observations confirmed that NPs\nwork across many different contexts of practice and sys-\ntems requiring high levels of systems literacy.\nThe validation of the standards through observations\nof the NPs at work was both informative and inspir-\national. Although the validation phase was technically\nchallenging to organize, it enabled the research team to\nobserve the diversity and sophistication of practice and\nthe impact of NP services in a rich variety of contexts\nacross Australia. It provided important evidence that\nenabled the team to conclude that the revised standards\nreflected NP practice in Australia and provided a basis\nfor future adaptation to specialty-specific standards.\nFollowing completion of Phase 3, the penultimate ver-\nsion of the standards was submitted to the NMBA for\nreview. The final standards as approved by the NMBA\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThe research and policy development process that we\nused allowed an iterative building of new draft NP\nstandards for Australia. Once we developed the draft\nstandards far enough, we were able to conduct work--\nbased observations. Stakeholder perspectives, especially\nthe importance of definitional clarification, were two\nmajor issues that arose through the iterative process.\nTension between the needs of different stakeholders in\nterms of the technical detail of the standards also\nemerged. The needs of consumers and carers differed\nfrom those of NPs, themselves, faculty designing univer-\nsity courses, and AHPRA staff assessing applicants for\nendorsement. Another theme that the initial phases of\nthe project generated was that the standards need to\ndepict NP attributes as clinically focussed, reflecting\nwhat an NP can do. The pillars from the Strong Model\n(Ackerman, Norsen, Martin, Wiedrich, & Kitzman,\n1996) of leadership, education, research, and practice\nare expressed in relation to NP clinical practice (see\nFigure 2).\nAnother important finding was that before standards\ncould operate effectively, they needed to include defin-\nitional clarity across ANP (as opposed to APN). This is\nessential to allow recognition of advanced practice\nwithin the RN scope for NP candidates applying for\nendorsement by the NMBA as an NP. Further, it was\nevident that the term NP needed to be clearly defined\nand separated from the colloquial term of practice\nnurse. This was addressed in the glossary of the stand-\nards (see Table 4).\nDefinitional clarity allows consumers and policy\nmakers to situate NPs among the other multitude of\nnursing titles that have proliferated internationally\n(Pulcini et al., 2010). This is a first step, matching nursing\nproviders with work to be done, or service sought. For\npolicy makers, this is particularly important in Australia\nwith its move to scenario-based modeling of the health\nworkforce (McCarty & Fenech, 2012). Scenario-based\nmodeling refers to the process of exploring possible\nfutures in health workforce through modeling based on\nTable 2.

Framework for the Nurse Practitioner Standards of Practice Australia.\nTable 4. Glossary Developed for Standards as Published in the Standards.\nAdvanced nursing practice (ANP): ANP is a continuum along which nurses develop their professional knowledge, clinical reasoning\nand judgment, skills and behaviors to higher levels of capability (that is recognizable). Nurses practicing at an advanced level incorporate\nprofessional leadership, education, and research into their clinically based practice. Their practice is effective and safe. They work within a\ngeneralist or specialist context, and they are responsible and accountable for managing people who have complex healthcare requirements.\nANP is a level of practice and not a role. It is acknowledged that ANP is individually attributed within a regulated nursing scope (enrolled\nnurse, registered nurse, or nurse practitioner).\nAdvanced practice nursing (APN): APN in the Australian nursing context identifies the additional legislative functions of an endorsed\nnurse practitioner that are outside the contemporary registered nurse scope of practice. Advanced practice nursing as a nurse practitioner\nis a qualitatively different level of ANP from that of the registered nurse due to the additional legislative functions and the regulatory\nrequirements. The requirements include a prescribed educational level, a specified ANP experience, and continuing professional devel-\nopment.\n(Advanced practice nursing should not be confused with the term practice nurse that is used colloquially to describe nurses working in the\ngeneral practice setting.)\nAttributes: Attributes are characteristics that underpin competent performance. http://www.anmac.org.au/userfiles/file/competency_\nstandards/Competency_standards_RN.pdf\nCompetence: The combination of skills, knowledge, attitudes, values, and abilities that underpin effective and superior performance in a\nprofession/occupational area.http://www.anmac.org.au/userfiles/file/competency_standards/Competency_standards_RN.pdf\nCues: Key generic examples of competent performance. They are neither comprehensive nor exhaustive. They assist the assessor when\nusing their professional judgment in assessing nursing practice. They further assist curriculum development. http://www.anmac.org.au/\nuserfiles/file/competency_standards/Competency_standards_RN.pdf\nNurse Practitioner: A nurse practitioner is an advanced practice nurse endorsed by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia to\npractice within their scope under the legislatively protected title \"nurse practitioner.\"\nPerson/people: In these Standards, person/people is used to refer to those individuals who have entered into a relationship with a nurse\npractitioner. Person/people encompass patients, clients, consumers, and families that fall within the nurse practitioner scope and context of\npractice.\nPrescribing: Prescribing is defined as the steps of information gathering, clinical decision making, communication, and evaluation which\nresults in the initiation, continuation, or cessation of a medicine.\nScope of practice: The scope of nursing practice is that in which nurses are educated, competent to perform, and permitted by law. The\nactual scope of practice of individual practitioners is influenced by the settings in which they practice, the health needs of people, the level\nof competence and confidence of the nurse, and the policy requirements of the service provider.\nwhat types of workers are capable to perform specific\nroles required in healthcare delivery. For consumers,\nthis is important when deciding whom to consult for a\nhealth issue.\nEvidence also highlighted the need to formally recog-\nnize that newly endorsed NPs may practice as novices\nand that it is necessary to set standards of required\nminimum attributes that build upon the foundational\nRN standards. Importantly, findings from this study\nconfirmed that instead of NPs becoming increasingly\nspecialized--more than other advanced and specialist\npractice roles within the RN scope--they actually\nbecome more generalist, building a broader base of prac-\ntice as required to safely exercise the extended privileges\nembedded within the NP scope. This finding is important\nas advanced within nursing has been applied as a direc-\ntional metaphor. Directional metaphors are one of the\nfoundational metaphors in Western thought (Lakoff &\nJohnson, 1980). The Western view of progress is condi-\ntioned by advancement, as the steady movement forward\nin the same direction in the name of progress (Donovan,\n1997). Yet, interestingly, our study shows that NP devel-\nopment and APN might require a reversal of direction.\nNP development moves toward optimizing the specialist\npractice, formed in ANP with the RN scope. This pro-\ncess involves building a broader generalist base on which\nto situate the specialist practice. So in effect rather than\nmoving further in the same direction of specialization,\nthe NP becomes more generalist. This finding highlights\nthe pragmatic element of distinguishing between ANP\nand APN. The project team developed clear definitions\nof each term, and they were endorsed as part of the\nstandard by the NMBA (see Table 4).\nThe project team also expected that there would be\nsome duplication between standards for APN and RNs\nbecause NPs are fundamentally nurses who have the\nability to fully utilize the RN scope and practice as\nNPs. Our findings suggested that although this might\nbe obvious to some nurses, the new standards needed\nto clearly state that NP practice is nursing practice.\nThis was principally motivated by the political concern\nof making sure NPs remained philosophically immersed\nwithin nursing and did not drift to the ideological pos-\nition of medicine, becoming mini-doctors.\nThe context and process used to formulate the policy\ntool of the Australian NP Standards for Practice,\ndirection for future evaluation of NP utilization. The\npolicy represents an internationally novel, clinical inter-\npretation of the pillar-based approach (Ackerman et al.,\n1996) to standards and provides definitional clarity to\nstakeholders. Evidence of policy success or failure is\nrarely clear-cut. Rigorous analysis more commonly\nshows that policy performs in the gray area in between\nabsolute success and failure, with relative success in some\nof the bundle of outcomes (McConnell, 2010). Hence, it\nremains to be seen how future analyses of these policy\nchanges will deem its success in achieving objectives\nacross the multiple uses of the standards.\nProject Limitations\nLimitations to this project are as follows: Stakeholder\ndiversity, single-day observations of a complex and vari-\nable role, and the need to balance subjective opinion\nfrom a diverse range of stakeholders all of which posed\nchallenges in the analysis. However, viewed in the con-\ntext of policy formation, all three lenses of political\nknowledge, scientific research-based knowledge, and\nfield experience have been consciously included\n(Head, 2008). As the distinction between policy and\npolitics is not clear-cut, and in some languages not\ndistinguished at all, this research limitation can be\nviewed as policy strength (Buse, Mays, & Walt,\n2005). Consultative processes including focus groups\nare limited by the fact that participants are often\nunable to move outside their own personal or profes-\nsional sphere of thinking (Yen et al., 2011). This limi-\ntation can bias findings toward support of the status\nquo. In focus groups, this effect can be compounded,\nas there can be a drive to normative discourses biased\nby more dominant members, even when the groups are\nConclusion\nIn clarifying constructs throughout the study, we strived\nto keep clear audit trails to demonstrate validity and\nrigor and hold to a clear process. Thus, we can defend\nthe mixed-methods design and the plural, cultural, and\npractical nature of the knowledge claims. The Australian\nNP Standards for Practice, while shaped by the\nAustralian-specific context and actors, provide novel\napplication of the pillar approach to standards. We\nhope that NPs in other countries might find this article\nuseful in revising their NP standards and offer sugges-\ntions as to how the research and policy process might be\nimproved. We also provide insight and advancement the\ndefinitional conundrum around advanced practice that\nconcerns nursing and NPs, globally.\n"
