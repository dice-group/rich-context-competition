An understanding of human\nexposure is critical for meaningful risk assessment. The\ninvestigations into human exposure have, for the most part,\nassessed intake based on food consumption estimates\ncombined with measurements or estimates of BPA in foods\nand in the environment (Kang et al., 2006; Wilson et al.,\n2007), rather than directly measuring human exposure.\nRecently, data on urinary levels of BPA in the United States\nExamination Survey (NHANES) have been made available\nrepresentative data for male and female subjects from ages 6\nto 60 \u00fe years. These data can be used to estimate daily intake\nof BPA, assuming steady-state excretion (Calafat et al., 2008).\nIn this paper, we describe the results of analyses of the\nNHANES urinary BPA data giving estimates of daily intake\nof BPA in the US population, for male and female subjects,\nand by age group. We first briefly discuss summary\ndatabase (for a more complete description, see Calafat et al.,\n2008). We then present the method used to estimate daily\nBPA intakes, and give information on the assumptions and\nparameters used as the foundation for the intake derivations.\nFinally, we compare these results to previously published\ndaily intakes from estimates of food consumption and food\nBPA concentrations and to health-based guidance values.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC)\nNational Center for Health Statistics data files for NHANES\ndata are from a subsample (Laboratory 24) of the total\npopulation sampled as part of NHANES (10,122 persons\n1.

Thus, the\nsubsample for which there are existing BPA data includes\nments were below the LOD.\nUrinary BPA percentiles and geometric means for all\nparticipants, and by age and gender, were given by Calafat\net al. (2008). Our separate analysis of the data, which\nprovides additional age categories used in the assessment of\ndaily intake, is shown in Table 1 (the results are within\n0.2 ng/ml of those given by Calafat et al.). In both analyses,\nweighting factors provided by CDC are applied to the\nraw data, resulting in estimates of percentiles and mean\nvalues that are meant to be representative of the US\npopulation.\nMethod for Estimating BPA Daily Intake\nThe following steps were used to estimate daily intake for\nNHANES database. For each individual in the NHANES\ndatabase with urinary BPA data, the urinary BPA concen-\ntration (ng/ml) was combined with 24-h urinary output\nvolume (ml) to determine daily excretion of BPA in units of\nnanogram/day (ng/day). This was assumed to be equivalent\nto the daily intake. To obtain the daily intake adjusted for\nbody weight (expressed in units of ng/kg-day), the daily\nintake for each individual was divided by that individual's\nbody weight, as reported in the NHANES database (Eq. 1).\nTo estimate various population (and population subgroups)\nquantities such as intake means or intake percentiles,\nweighted means and percentiles were calculated using\nthe NHANES 2-year weights provided for the Laboratory\n24 sample (as described in the NHANES analytic\nUrinary BPA \u00f0ng=ml\u00de\u00c2urinary output \u00f0ml=day\u00de=\nbody weight \u00f0kg\u00de \u00bc ng BPA=kg-day\nUsing this approach, distributions of intakes representative\nof the US population were determined for (i) all participants;\n(ii) participants by the following age groups: 6\u00ad11 years,\n(iii) participants by gender. The calculations of point\nestimates and confidence intervals for the geometric mean\nintakes and intake percentiles were carried out in the R\nplatform (Ihaka and Gentleman, 1996), using the survey\npackage written by Thomas Lumley (http://faculty.washington.\nedu/tlumley/survey/).\nBecause the NHANES data give information on urinary\nconcentrations, rather than intake, certain assumptions and\ndatabases were relied upon. The following sections describe\nthe underlying data supporting each assumption and\ndatabase used in this analysis.\nUse of Urinary BPA to Represent Daily Intake Excretion\nof ingested BPA into urine is essentially complete in 24 h\n(Vo\nthe glucuronide conjugate, so total BPA after hydrolysis of\nconjugates (referred to from this point onward as urinary\nBPA) in a 24-h urine sample approximates the BPA intake\nfrom the previous 24 h (Arakawa et al., 2004; Tsukioka et al.,\n2004). Thus, urinary BPA measures are useful for\nrepresenting total excreted BPA and provide a reasonable\nsurrogate for intake (Dekant and Vo\nUrine Volume- or Creatinine-Based BPA Data CDC\nprovides urinary BPA data both in units of ng/ml urine and\nng/g creatinine. To derive intake estimates, we are seeking\ntotal daily excreted BPA in units of mass, and so would need\nto adjust the NHANES data by either daily urinary output\n(volume) or daily creatinine excretion (mass), and\nassumptions about those two output values would be\nneeded. Many factors contribute to the daily variability in\ncreatinine output, including diurnal variation (possibly\nTable 1.

BPA measures reported in\nunits of ng/ml were selected for this analysis.\nDaily Urinary Output Data Given the lack of 24-h urinary\noutput data for the NHANES participants, it is necessary to\nuse generic values to describe typical urinary output based on\nage and gender to estimate total daily excretion of BPA in\nnanograms. Values for daily urinary excretion used in this\nanalysis (Table 2) were derived from the reference values given\nby the International Commission on Radiological Protection\nyears, the ICRP values used were those for the ``adult.'' For\nages 12\u00ad19 years, the ICRP values for 15-year olds were used.\nFor ages 6\u00ad11 years, the average of the ICRP values for the\nused. The only gender difference in ICRP values was for\nadults, with a lower value assigned to female participants\nThe ICRP values were based on several studies in the\npublished literature. To evaluate whether the ICRP values\ncorrespond to additional data in the literature, a PubMed\nsearch was conducted seeking information on the relationship\nbetween urinary output in healthy individuals, and age and\ngender. The literature search terms included ``daily,''\n``urinary,'' ``output,'' ``24-h,'' and ``volume.'' Literature\nfrom 1951 to present was identified using this search\nprocedure. The value of 600 ml/day for young children\nappears to be relatively consistent with additional informa-\ntion obtained from the literature. For example, a study on\nurinary fluoride excretion in 33 British 6-year-old children\n(mean \u00bc 9 years) had mean daily urinary excretion volumes\nChildren (aged 4 years) from Sri Lanka (N \u00bc 53) and\nFor healthy adults, an Internet search revealed general\n24 h, assuming ``normal'' fluid intake; MedlinePlus Medical\nEncyclopedia, http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/ar-\ngenerally consistent with this information. However, other\ninformation obtained from the published literature suggests\nthat the value of 1200 ml/day for female adults may be an\nunderestimate. For example, mean (10th to 90th percentile\nrange) 24-h urinary output values for 330 white US women\n(25th to 75th quartile range) 24-h urinary output values for\nvolumes for non-stone-forming women, with values ranging\nThe ICRP-based values as given in Table 2 are used in this\nanalysis. As daily intake is proportional to urinary output\n(Eq. 1), use of alternative values for urinary output would\nresult in proportional changes to estimates of daily intake.\nBody Weight Data To provide estimates of daily intake\nadjusted for body weight, we used body weight data from the\nreported urinary BPA data. However, 124 individuals from\nLaboratory 24 were missing either BPA or body weight data;\nthe total count of participants with all necessary data for\nestimating daily BPA intake is 2488. Mean body weights by\nage group and gender are given in Table 2.\nIt is instructive to compare the body weights reported\nby NHANES with generic values provided by the US\nEnvironmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Exposure\nTable 2. Values used for estimates of BPA intake.\nMale Female Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female\nDaily urinary output volumes derived from ICRP (2003) and Valentin (2002) as described in text.

Mean body weights by age group and\ngender for NHANES participants with BPA data and mean\nbody weights given by EPA (1997) are compared in Table 2.\nThe values from the NHANES data are somewhat larger\nthan the body weights given by EPA. Because daily intake is\ninversely proportional to body weight according to Eq. 1,\nsmall differences in body weight (e.g., deviations of 5 kg) will\nhave minimal impact on the intake estimates for adults, but\nwould have a greater impact on intake estimates for children.\nThus, estimates of intake using a combination of NHANES\nchemical data and EPA body weight data could overestimate\nintakes.\nResults\nPercentiles and means were estimated for BPA daily intakes\nurinary BPA data and individual body weight data as\ndescribed in the previous section.

Median\nBPA intakes for adolescents (12\u00ad19-year olds) are higher\nthan intakes for younger children (6\u00ad11-year olds), but the\ndifference is not statistically significant.

Median BPA intakes are statistically\nsignificantly higher for male subjects compared to female\nsubjects.\nDiscussion\nOn the basis of the NHANES urinary BPA data and the\nassumptions described in this paper, median daily BPA\nintakes for men are statistically significantly higher than for\nwomen. In addition, there were differences in median daily\nBPA intakes according to age groups, with adolescents (12\u00ad\n19 years) having the highest estimated intakes and the oldest\ngroup (60 \u00fe ) having the lowest estimated intakes. A\ndownward trend in intake with age starting from adolescence\nis apparent.\nThe underlying NHANES urinary BPA data showed the\nsame age and gender trends (Table 1), but the dietary intake\nestimates are a function of both urinary concentration\n(measured for each individual) and daily urinary output\n(estimated for groups). A sensitivity analysis for these data\nwas conducted by assigning a common value of 1400 ml/day\nTable 3.

The results of this\nanalysis removed the influence of gender in BPA intake.\nAdditional analyses with adult urinary volumes set at 1200 or\n1600 ml/day gave the same result, suggesting that the\nremoval of gender influence when adult male and female\nurinary output volumes are equal is insensitive to the choice\nof the urinary output value.\nTo determine the effect of using creatinine-adjusted urinary\nBPA data on the intake estimates, we computed intakes for\nthe overall sample population using the NHANES data on\nindividual urinary BPA concentrations, individual urinary\ncreatinine levels, age, body weight, and ICRP (2003) values\nfor daily creatinine excretion (using ICRP values for 10-year\n19 age group, and adult values for the remaining age groups).\nWe generally found that within age groups F with the\nexception of the 6\u00ad11-year olds, creatinine-adjusted intake\nestimates tend to be lower than intake estimates based on\nnon-adjusted urinary BPA data (6\u00ad11-year olds: B 40%\nB25% lower). Intake estimates based on creatinine-adjusted\nBPA concentrations and non-adjusted concentrations are\nfairly highly correlated (correlation coefficients ranging from\nAlthough estimates of intake percentiles are presented in\nthis analysis, caution is warranted in interpreting these\nresults. There are clear limitations imposed by the underlying\ndata and the methodology for estimating daily intake.\nEstimates of percentiles, particularly those in the tails of\nthe intake distributions, tend to be sensitive to the measure-\nments made for small numbers of individuals. As a result, the\nmedian values for the cohort will likely provide more reliable\nestimates of population median intake. An additional\ncautionary note is that intake estimates represent external\ndoses of parent BPA, not internal serum BPA levels. As\nreported by Dekant and Vo\nglucuronide formed during first-pass metabolism in the gut\nwall and liver is rapidly cleared from blood by the kidneys\nand excreted with urine;'' thus, urinary BPA measures are\nnot representative of serum BPA levels as minimal parent\ncompound is systemically circulated (CERHR, 2007; Will-\nIt is also reasonable to question whether spot urine\nsamples, as collected and analyzed for NHANES, are\nappropriate surrogates for 24-h samples or for longitudinal\nsampling of urine when estimating exposure to BPA. It has\nbeen suggested, based on a limited number of studies, that\nurinary BPA measures from spot urine samples are appro-\npriate for estimating average exposures to populations or\nshort-term individual exposures (Arakawa et al., 2004;\nDekant and Vo\nthat an ``uncertainty of approximately one order of\nmagnitude has to be accepted when using single spot urine\nsamples to estimate total daily intake by an individual''\n(Dekant and Vo\n\u00a8 lkel, 2008). It should be noted that BPA is\nrapidly excreted, and it is therefore unlikely that urinary BPA\nlevels would be constant throughout the day.\nFew chemicals have been the subject of investigations into\nthe temporal variability of environmental chemicals in urine\net al., 2008). A study on temporal variability of phenols and\nother chemicals in urine was carried out with 29 children who\nprovided several spot urine samples each over 6 months\n(Teitelbaum et al., 2007). Creatinine-corrected urinary BPA\nconcentrations were moderately correlated out to 12 weeks,\nand the authors concluded that the intra-individual stability\nin biomarker concentration ``indicates that more-or-less\nconstant exposure must exist to common environmental\nagents,'' as the compounds studied have half-lives of only\nhours to days. A study on temporal variability of urinary\nsingle urine sample showed ``moderate sensitivity'' for\npredicting a person's tertile category. The authors stated\nthat ``despite within-person variability in urinary BPA\nconcentrations, a single sample is predictive of long-term\nexposure (over weeks and months).'' Arakawa et al. (2004)\nfound a large between-day variation over 5 consecutive days\nbased on 24-h urine samples collected from five subjects\n(intra-individual variation of 91%). Arakawa et al. con-\ncluded that the results suggest that 24-h urine samples should\nnot be the basis for estimating long-term exposures in an\nindividual, but they can be useful for estimating average\npopulation intake of BPA in a cross-sectional study. Thus,\nalthough the NHANES cross-sectional data would appear to\nprovide a reasonable reference range for single day exposures\nand for estimating average population exposures (and\ntherefore intakes), it is less clear whether these data can be\nextended to understanding longer term exposures.\nThe predominant exposure route for BPA is via ingestion\nour estimates of daily BPA intake for the US population\nbased on NHANES urinary BPA data are compared with\nrecent international intake estimates based on measurements\nof BPA in environmental media and migration of BPA from\nfood packaging to food combined with exposure factors for\ningestion (a review of food and aggregate exposures to BPA\ncan be found in the CERHR (2007) report). Caution should\nbe exercised when comparing from our results to the studies\nincluded in Table 4. For example, although the intake values\nestimated by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA,\n2007) (Table 4) are substantially higher than those derived\nfrom urinary BPA data in the United States, according to\nBisphenol A daily intakes in the United States\nLaKind and Naiman\nEFSA, conservative assumptions were used in its dietary\nestimates, possibly explaining the discrepancy. The intakes\ndetermined by Wilson et al. (2007) are similar to our\nestimates, but they focus on an age group not represented in\nthe NHANES data. In a review by Kang et al. (2006), an\nupper bound of 1000 ng/kg-day for daily intake is given. On\nthe basis of the analysis in this paper, in the United States the\n95th percentile intake of the population is below 1000 ng/kg-\nday, and only 8 of the 2488 individuals in the NHANES\nsubsample exceeded that upper bound value. In contrast,\nDekant and Vo\n\u00a8 lkel (2008) estimate ``reasonable worst case''\nadult exposure to BPA to be approximately 100 ng/kg-day\nand average exposure to be 60 ng/kg-day. In this assessment,\ngeometric mean values were below 100 ng/kg-day for all\ngroupings analyzed. Miyakawa et al. (2006) and Higuchi\net al. (2004) estimated intakes from very specific food types\nthat would not apply to long-term intakes in the general\npopulation (daily consumption of canned trout and con-\nsumption of hospital food, respectively).\nFew studies have estimated BPA intake based on urinary\na maximum intake of 230 ng/kg-day. Miyamoto and Kotake\n(2006) used Monte Carlo analysis to estimate daily BPA\nbased on 24-h urinary BPA data from two studies in Japan\nn \u00bc 22) in conjunction with several assumptions, including\nlognormal distribution of the urinary BPA data, equivalency\nof 24-h urinary BPA and BPA intake from the previous day,\nand lognormal distribution of body weights with a geometric\nsubjects.
