Lee*\nSchool of Nursing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China\n Introduction\nDiabetes is becoming more serious worldwide. A recent\ndisability-adjusted life year and global years lived with disability\nattributed to diabetes have increased by 69% [1] and 68% [2],\nrespectively. High BMI and low physical activity are two well-\nknown risk factors of type 2 diabetes, yet they are still epidemic.\nHigh BMI and low physical activity are ranked second and sixth,\nrespectively, in the global risk factors of disability-adjusted life-\nyears in high-income North America [3]. Type 2 diabetes is a\ndisease not only among older adults but also among adolescents\n[4] and young adults [5], partly because of their high and\nsustained prevalence of obesity [6] and low physical activity [7].\nPhysical activity is a multi-dimensional, complex behavior that\ninvolves many attributes, such as duration, frequency, intensity\nlevel, and domains (such as leisure activity, occupational activity,\nor transport-related activity). Multiple domains have shown\ndifferent effects on health. For instance, a recent study showed\nthat occupational and household physical activity but not\ntransportation and leisure time physical activity were associated\nwith metabolic syndrome [8]. Furthermore, analysis of physical\nactivity data will become more complicated if sedentary behaviors\nhave to be taken into account. Recent studies showed that\nsedentary behaviors are risk factors for mortality, independent of\nphysical activity level [9]. Given that different domains of physical\nactivity maybe correlated, using traditional regression analysis with\nphysical activity is not preferred, because multicollinearity\nproblem will arise when correlated domains of physical activity/\nsedentary behavior variables are adjusted. The multicollinearity\nproblem can be avoided using cluster analysis, a simple method of\nidentifying the number of distinct patterns and their corresponding\ncharacteristics in a sample. Cluster analysis has been used to\nidentify patterns of self-reported physical activity [10], sedentary\nbehaviors [11], and objectively-assessed physical activity [12].\nAs the interlocking effects of BMI, physical activity, and type 2\ndiabetes have not been fully established, this study aims to explore\nthe longitudinal association between patterns of physical activity\nand sedentary behaviors during adolescence and the increase in\nBMI and prevalence of diabetes during young adulthood, using\ndata from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health\n(Add Health), a 14-year longitudinal cohort that followed the\nparticipants from adolescence in grades 7 to 12 to young\nadulthood.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nThe sample of Add Health comprises 80 nationally represen-\ntative high schools in the United States and one randomly chosen\nfeeder school from the 60 high schools that without a 7th grade,\nselected using a systematic sampling method. Overall, 79% of the\ngrades 7 to 12 completed an in-school questionnaire in Wave I\nA parent or guardian of the participants was invited to complete a\nparent-in-home questionnaire that included demographics, socio-\neconomic status, information of spouse, and relationship with\nchild. The present analysis was based on 6,504 participants with\npublicly available data. Among this group of participants, 4,834,\nand II, only in-home interviews were conducted, while at Waves\nIII and IV biological specimen were also collected. A total of 3,808\nto 17) at Wave I completed all Waves, and 62 of them were\nremoved due to missing physical activity and sedentary behavior\nvariables. After removal of outliers in physical activity and\nwere included in the present analysis. The incidence of diabetes\nand patterns of physical activity and sedentary behaviors between\nwere similar, but significant differences were found in sex (45.9%\nthe study design of Add Health. The data and the details of the\nstudy can be found in its official Web site, http://www.cpc.unc.\nedu/projects/addhealth/, and the Minimal Dataset is available at\nFile S2. This study was approved by the Institutional Review\nBoard at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Written\nconsent of both the adolescent and their parent were obtained.\nMeasurement\nLeisure time physical activity and sedentary behaviors at\nWaves I to III were assessed using an interviewer-administered\nquestionnaire. The interviews at Waves I and II included 11\nitems examining the frequency (Not at all, 1 or 2 times, 3 or 4\ntimes, and 5 or more times) and duration (hours per week) of\nphysical activity and sedentary behaviors in the week preceding\nthe interview (shown valid and reliable [13]). The interviews at\nWave III included the 11 items administered at Waves I and II\nplus 4 additional items that are applicable to young adults [14].\nNote that for some of these activities (such as the item ``In the\npast seven days, how many times did you engage in a hobby such\nas working on a collection, playing cards or board games, arts\nand crafts, drama, playing a musical instrument or singing with a\ngroup, or shopping just for fun?'') we cannot tell whether the\nnature of them are physically active or sedentary, thus were\nremoved from further analysis. As a result, only 25 out of the\navailable 37 items were included in the current analysis (7 at\nWave I, 7 at Wave II, and 11 at Wave III). Table S1 in File S1\nshows these physical activity and sedentary behaviors variables.\nHeight and weight at Waves I and II were self-reported, whereas\nthose at Waves III and IV were measured by the interviewers\nfollowing standardized protocols (details can be found in the Add\nHealth website, http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/\ncodebooks/wave3). BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided\nby the square of height (m2). As the variable of interest was the\nchange in BMI over time, according to similar studies [15], raw\nBMI values are reported as opposed to standardized values.\nInformation for education level of parent-in-home was collected\nat Wave I. Diabetes at Waves I to II and III was identified by\nparent-in-home and participants themselves respectively. Glucose\nand HbA1c level at Wave IV were obtained from dried blood\nspot assays. The glucose measure (available in 2,894 out of the\n3,717 participants) was classified as fasting if the measurement\nwas taken at least eight hours after last meal and non-fasting\notherwise. A participant demonstrated evidence of diabetes at\nWave IV if any of the following is met: [16] (1) fasting glucose $\nglobin A1c $48 mmol/mol (or 6.5%), (4) self-reported history of\ndiabetes, or (5) reported taking anti-diabetic medication.\nStatistical analysis\nThe k-means cluster analysis [17] was used to identify the\nnumber of physical activity and sedentary behavior patterns in the\nsample using 25 physical activity and sedentary behavior variables.\nAll these variables were standardized to a mean and a standard\ndeviation of 0 and 1 respectively using wave-specific means and\nstandard deviations to equalize their importance. The k-means\ncluster analysis aims to group the participants into non-overlap-\nping clusters by minimizing the within-group sum of squares. First,\nk (a pre-specified integer) cluster centers were randomly generated.\nThen, participants were assigned to the cluster with the shortest\ndistance to these cluster centers. Finally, the cluster centers were\nrecomputed using the new cluster assignment, and these steps\nwould be iterated until convergence was achieved. To determine\nthe best cluster solution, within group-sum of squares for k = 1 to\n15 were computed and the best k was determined using the elbow\nmethod [18]. The first two discriminant components were used\n[19] to characterize the clusters. The k-means cluster analysis\nusing the Hartigan and Wong's algorithm [20] was performed\nusing R 3.0.1 (R development core team).\nOne-way ANOVA (and Tukey post-doc test if significant) and\nPearson's x2 test were used to compare the differences between\nclusters for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. The\nincrease in BMI from Wave III to Wave IV and the incidence of\ndiabetes were adjusted for age, sex, smoking and drinking habits\n[21] at Waves I and III, education level of parent-in-home, and\nparental history of diabetes, using linear regression and logistic\nregression, respectively. The logistic regression for incidence of\ndiabetes excluded participants with diabetes history at Waves I to\nIII (n = 32) and was further adjusted for BMI at Wave I. Given\nthat the BMI were different between the clusters (see the Cluster\nprofile: demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, life-\nstyles, and biomarkers subsection below for details), for the\nincrease in BMI from Wave III to Wave IV, the same analysis was\nrepeated on non-overweight (BMI,25) participants. Smoking and\ndrinking habits at Wave II were not adjusted to avoid multi-\ndrinking respectively, both p,0.001). These analyses were\nperformed using IBM-SPSS version 20.0.\nSensitivity analysis\nTo confirm the association of PA, SB on increase in BMI and\ntype 2 diabetes, regressions were fitted using the original PA and\nSB variables as independent variable and change in BMI and type\n2 diabetes as dependent variable, with the same set of confounders\nadjusted. Another set of logistic regression with diabetes cases at\nWaves II and III (n = 7) included were performed.\nPhysical Activity, Sedentary Behaviors, BMI, and Diabetes\nResults\nCluster analysis\nFigure S2 in File S1 shows the within-group sum of squares of\ncluster solutions from k = 1 to 15. As a substantial reduction of\nwithin-group sum of squares from k = 2 to 3 were observed, a\nthree-cluster solution was deemed appropriate. The k-means\nand 3 respectively. Table S1 in File S1 shows the loadings of the\nfirst two discriminant components of the physical activity and\nsedentary behavior variables. According to the loadings, the first\nand second components were labeled ``exercise frequency'' and\n``sitting time''. Figure 1 shows the plot of all participants on the\nfirst two discriminant components. Note that participants in cluster\n1 had more sitting time, and hence, this cluster was labeled as\n``LPAHSB (low physical activity, high sedentary behavior)\ncluster''. Compared with cluster 2, participants in clusters 3 had\nmore sitting time and at the same time exercise more frequently,\nand hence, clusters 2 and 3 were labeled as ``LPALSB (low\nphysical activity, low sedentary behavior) cluster'' and ``HPALSB\n(high physical activity, low sedentary behavior) cluster'' respec-\ntively.\nCluster profile: physical activity and sedentary behavior\nTable 1 shows the sedentary behavior time variables in the\nthree clusters. Time spent watching TV and videos at Waves I and\nII among participants in the LPAHSB cluster were nearly tripled\ncompared with participants in the other two clusters. The trend of\nsedentary time was also different across clusters. Participants in the\nLPAHSB cluster had no change in time playing computer games\nP = 0.24), whereas an increase was observed for participants in the\nHPALSB cluster had longer sedentary time than those in the\nLPALSB cluster. However, the differences between these two\nclusters were of negligible effect sizes with an average Cohen's d\neffect size of 0.10 (in which a value of .0.2 indicates clinically\nsignificant effect [22]).\nTable 2 shows the physical activity and sedentary behavior\nfrequency variables in the three clusters. For a clear presentation,\nonly frequencies and percentages of the category ``five or more\ntimes'' were listed. Proportion of participants engaged in sports\nand exercise activities in the HPALSB cluster was much higher\nthan that in the other two clusters. At Wave I, more than half\n(53.7%) of the participants in the HPALSB cluster had engaged in\nactive sports, but this number was reduced to 26.3% and 13.0% in\nthe LPAHSB cluster and LPALSB cluster respectively. At Wave\nIII, participants in the HPALSB cluster were more likely to engage\nin all sports and exercise activities items. Note that participants in\nthe LPAHSB cluster had more frequent engagement of physical\nactivity than those in the LPALSB cluster. However, the\ndifferences between these two clusters were of negligible effect\nsizes with an average OR of 1.73 and 1.43 for Wave I and Wave II\nrespectively (in which a value of .2 indicates clinically significant\nCluster profile: demographic characteristics,\nsocioeconomic status, lifestyles, and biomarkers\nTable 3 shows the profile (continuous variables) of the three\nclusters.

The negative association between TV viewing\nat Wave II and type 2 diabetes may be a result of multicollinearity.\nAll the PA variables that were associated with the incidence of type\n2 diabetes had relatively high discriminant loadings on the SB\ncomponent (Table S1 in File S1).\nThe ORs did not differ from the original logistic regression with\nparticipants having type 2 diabetes at Waves II and III removed\nDiscussion\nThe cluster analysis identified three clusters of physical activity\nand sedentary behaviors across the three Waves. Participants in\ncluster 3 had low physical activity and high sedentary behaviors.\nThose in cluster 1 had similar level of physical activity but higher\nlevel of sedentary behaviors than cluster 3, while those in clusters 2\nsimilar level of sedentary behaviors but higher level of physical\nactivity than cluster 3. Note that a reduction of physical activity\nfrom adolescence to young adulthood was observed in all the three\nclusters, whereas a reduction of 25.8% in time spent watching TV\n(hours per week reduced from 31.3 to 23.2) was observed in the\nLPAHSB cluster. This was consistent with the previous finding\nwith the same dataset that physical activity declined with age [14].\nCurrent smokers at Waves I to III was less likely to be in the\nHPALSB cluster, and girls were more likely to be in the LPALSB\ncluster. Participants in the LPAHSB cluster had the greatest BMI\nwhereas those in the HPALSB cluster had the lowest BMI. These\nfindings were consistent with those of previous studies [11]. More\nthan one-fourth (27.0%) of the participants belonged to the\nHPALSB cluster, comparable with a previous finding of 29% [23]\n(percentage of active high school students).\nAlthough inadequate physical activity is a well-established risk\nfactor of diabetes [24\u00ad26] and high BMI or obesity [27], very few\nstudies analyzed the joint effect of physical activity and sedentary\nbehaviors. For example, consistent with our finding that partic-\nipants in the LPAHSB had a larger longitudinal increase in BMI, a\nmeta-analysis of 4 randomized controlled studies in children and\nyouth showed that decreasing sedentary behavior led to an\naverage of 0.89 kg/m2 decrease in BMI [28]. However, the vast\nmajority of these studies used the standard exposure-outcome\napproach treating TV viewing as exposure, BMI as outcome, and\nphysical activity as confounder, ignoring the effect of other\nsedentary behaviors including time spent playing computer games\nand watching videos. Using a cluster analysis approach, we can see\nthat sedentary behaviors were not associated with change in BMI.\nOur finding is consistent with a recent cross-sectional study on US\nadults examining the joint association between physical activity,\nsedentary behaviors, and BMI that found no association between\nBMI and total sedentary time [29], and this finding suggests a\npossibility that the association between sedentary behaviors and\nobesity is mediated by physical activity [26], which is usually\nlacking in sedentary people [30]. In addition, the observed\nassociation between TV viewing and BMI could also be mediated\nby unhealthy diet, which was supported by a study among US\nchildren that an additional hour of sitting was associated with 167\nkcal of energy intake [31].\nIt is evident that sedentary behaviors and physical activity lead\nto type 2 diabetes with independent effects among adults [25,30],\nbut this study only confirmed the effect of sedentary behaviors [24]\nbut not physical activity among adolescents. There are several\nexplanations on this phenomenon. First, it was suggested that the\nassociation between physical activity and type 2 diabetes is\nmediated by body fat [25]; thus during the 14 years of follow-up\nonly the control of body fat by physical activity was observed and a\nlonger follow-up period is required to observe the effect between\nbody fat and type 2 diabetes. Second, pervious study showed that\nblood glucose level was more strongly correlated with cardiore-\nspiratory fitness than energy expenditure [32], therefore it is\npossible that cardiorespiratory fitness mediates the association\nbetween physical activity and type 2 diabetes. Third, the most\ncommonly engaged sedentary behavior in our sample, watching\nTV, which comprised of 55% to 70% of the total sedentary time,\nwas shown to be associated with unhealthy diet [33] and this can\npartially explain the association between sedentary behaviors and\ntype 2 diabetes. Fourth, the follow-up period may be too short for\nFigure 2. Adjusted change in BMI and incidence of diabetes of the three clusters (LPAHSB: low physical activity high sedentary\nbehavior; HPALSB: high physical activity low sedentary behavior; LPALSB: low physical activity low sedentary behavior).\nPhysical Activity, Sedentary Behaviors, BMI, and Diabetes\nobserving the effect of physical activity on type 2 diabetes. A recent\nstudy showed that change in BMI was associated with risk of\nmetabolic syndrome [34]. It is therefore possible that lack of\nphysical activity leads to change in BMI, which was shown by the\ncurrent study, and this group of participants, although did not\nhave elevated risk of diabetes at Wave IV, was having higher risk\nof metabolic syndrome and elevated risk of type 2 diabetes at\nfuture. The findings of this study extend the literature by\nsuggesting possible pathways of the preventive effect of physical\nactivity on type 2 diabetes.\nThe strength of this study lies in the large, nationally\nrepresentative cohort data with 14 years of follow-up period.\nAlthough the study participants had a slight difference in terms of\ndemographic characteristics with the excluded participants, we\nbelieve that the results can be generalized to adolescents in US,\nand the biasedness induced for estimating the true effect of PA/SB\non increase of BMI and incidence of type 2 diabetes will be minor.\nThe use of cluster analysis allows identification of physical activity\nand sedentary behavior patterns specific in adolescents. Never-\ntheless, this study was not without limitations. First, physical\nactivity and sedentary behaviors were self-reported, which was\nsomewhat inaccurate [35,36]. Similarly, height and weight at\nWaves I and II were self-reported. In addition, non-exercise\nphysical activity such as job-induced activity was not assessed. To\nthe best of the author's knowledge, there are only cross-sectional\nstudies examining objectively measured physical activity and self-\nreported diabetes [12], and they could not infer causality. Thus,\nfurther research based on objectively measured physical activity is\nwarranted. Also, as there were very few participants that engaged\nin both high volumes of sedentary behavior and physical activity\nand/or exercise, the joint effect of them could not be evaluated.\nSecond, diabetes at Waves I to II and III was identified by parents\nand participants themselves respectively, and no blood samples\nwere collected. Therefore, only participants with diagnosed\ndiabetes reported could have been excluded from the regression\nanalysis and those with undiagnosed diabetes were included which\nmight induce bias. Also, the type of diabetes was unknown.\nHowever, the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes in adolescents is\nlow [5], so this limitation belongs to a minor one. Lastly, there are\nonly limited data on dietary intake pattern data, which is a possible\nconfounder of the association between TV watching and BMI\nTo conclude, relative to the participants in the LPALSB cluster,\nthose in the HPALSB cluster at adolescence had lower increase in\nBMI during young adulthood but no reduced risk of type 2\ndiabetes, while those in the LPAHSB cluster at adolescence had\nhigher risk of type 2 diabetes but no difference in the increase of\nBMI during young adulthood. For people with low levels of\nphysical activity engagement, reducing sedentary behaviors is\nprotective for type 2 diabetes. Future research of the effect and\nmechanism of reducing sedentary behaviors on the risk of type 2\ndiabetes is warranted.\nSupporting Information\nFile S1 Supplemental Tables and Figures.\nFile S2 Minimal Dataset.\n"
