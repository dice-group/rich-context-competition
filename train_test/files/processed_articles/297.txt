The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis\nthat low normal levels of total, free, and bioavailable testosterone are associated with prevalent\ndiabetes in men.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- The study sample included 1,413 adult men\naged 20 years who participated in the morning session of the first phase of the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional survey of the civilian, noninstitu-\ntionalized population of the U.S. Bioavailable and free testosterone levels were calculated from\nserum total testosterone, sex hormone\u00adbinding globulin, and albumin concentrations.\nRESULTS -- In multivariable models adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and adiposity, men in\nthe first tertile (lowest) of free testosterone level were four times more likely to have prevalent\nlarly, men in the first tertile of bioavailable testosterone also were approximately four times as\nThese associations persisted even after excluding men with clinically abnormal testosterone\nconcentrations defined as total testosterone 3.25 ng/ml or free testosterone 0.07 ng/ml.

These data suggest that low\nandrogen levels may be a risk factor for diabetes in men.\nIt has been suggested that sex steroid\nhormones may play a causal role in the\ndevelopment of insulin resistance and\ntype 2 diabetes (1,2). There is a growing\namount of literature examining the role\nsex steroid hormones may play in the de-\nvelopment of diabetes and cardiovascular\ndisease in women, but there has been rel-\natively less attention paid to this associa-\ntion in men. Men with endocrine\ndisorders that are associated with low tes-\ntosterone levels (hypogonadism), such as\nKlinefelter's and Wolfram's syndromes,\nhave an elevated risk of developing insu-\nlin resistance and diabetes (3,4). How-\never, the association between sex steroid\nconcentrations within the normal range\nand diabetes risk in men in the general pop-\nulation has not been well characterized.\nObesity, one of the most important\nunderlying causes of insulin resistance, is\nassociated with low testosterone levels in\nmen (5\u00ad7) and may partially or wholly\nmediate the process by which endoge-\nnous sex hormones influence diabetes\nrisk. Many previous studies have been\nconducted in small, highly selected pop-\nulations or convenience samples and/or\ndid not rigorously measure or control for\nthe possible effects of adiposity. The\npresent study was undertaken to investi-\ngate the association between sex steroid\nhormones and diabetes in the general\nadult male population in the U.S. Specif-\nically, we hypothesized that low levels of\ntotal, free, and bioavailable testosterone\nwould be associated with prevalent diabe-\ntes. We also hypothesized that this asso-\nciation would persist after controlling for\nthe potentially confounding effects of ad-\niposity.

The present study pop-\nulation was limited to men aged 20\nHeight, weight, and waist and hip cir-\ncumferences were measured as part of the\nNHANES examination. BMI was calcu-\nlated as weight in kilograms divided by\nthe square of height in meters. Partici-\npants were defined as having diabetes if\nthey answered \"yes\" to the question,\n\"Have you ever been told by a doctor or\nother health professional you had diabe-\ntes or sugar diabetes?\" Information on age\nand race/ethnicity were self-reported. De-\ntailed information regarding the collec-\ntion of data in NHANES III is available\nelsewhere (8).\nSex steroid hormones\nThe main hormones of interest in this\nstudy were measured total testosterone\n(serum), estimated bioavailable testoster-\none, and estimated free testosterone. Tes-\ntosterone is the major male androgen, and\nits free circulating levels are primarily de-\ntermined by sex hormone\u00ad binding\nglobulin (SHBG). Free (unbound) testos-\nterone accounts for a relatively small\ncirculating concentration of total testos-\nterone (2\u00ad3%). Bioavailable testosterone\nis the concentration of non\u00adSHBG-bound\ntestosterone and is comprised of both free\none levels. Total testosterone is the com-\nbination of circulating bioavailable levels\nand SHBG-bound levels (considered bio-\nlogically inactive). Measurements of free\nand bioavailable testosterone levels more\naccurately represent concentrations\nreadily available to tissues and metabolic\nprocesses.\nSerum testosterone, estradiol, andro-\nstanediol glucuronide (AAG), and SHBG\nconcentrations were measured as part of\nthe larger Hormone Demonstration\nProject, and all are included in the present\nstudy for comprehensiveness. Estradiol is\nthe major estrogen in men; AAG is an in-\ndicator of the conversion of testosterone\nto dihydrotestosterone, the major intra-\nprostatic androgen; and, as mentioned\nabove, SHBG is the major carrier of tes-\ntosterone and estradiol in circulation.\nBlood was drawn after an overnight\nfast for participants in the morning sam-\nple during either an examination at the\nmedical examination center or during an\nabbreviated examination at home. After\ncentrifugation, the serum was aliquotted\nLevels of sex steroid hormones and SHBG\nare stable after multiple freeze-thaw cy-\ncles (9,10). Serum concentrations of tes-\ntosterone, estradiol, AAG, and SHBG\nwere measured in the laboratory of N.R. at\nChildren's Hospital in Boston, Massachu-\nsetts. We used competitive electrochemi-\nElecsys autoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics,\nIndianapolis, IN) to quantify serum tes-\ntosterone, estradiol, and SHBG concen-\ntrations. AAG was measured by an\nenzyme immunoassay (Diagnostic Sys-\ntems Laboratories, Webster, TX). The\nparticipant samples were randomly or-\ndered for testing, and the laboratory tech-\nnicians were blinded to participant\ncharacteristics. The lowest detection lim-\nits of the assays were 0.02 ng/ml testoster-\nand 3 nmol/l SHBG. For quality control\nspecimens included during the analyses\nof NHANES III specimens, the coefficient\nof variation percentages were as follows:\nand free testosterone levels were calcu-\nlated from serum total testosterone,\nSHBG, and albumin concentrations (11).\nThe protocols for conduct of\nNHANES III were approved by the insti-\ntutional review board of the National\nCenter for Health Statistics, Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention. In-\nformed consent was obtained from all\nparticipants. The assay of stored serum\nspecimens for the Hormone Demonstra-\ntion Project was approved by institutional\nreview boards at the Johns Hopkins\nBloomberg School of Public Health and the\nNational Center for Health Statistics, Cen-\nters for Disease Control and Prevention.\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed us-\ning SUDAAN, as implemented in SAS v.\n8.1 (Cary, NC) software. In each analysis,\nwe applied sampling weights to take into\naccount the specific probabilities of selec-\ntion for the individual domains that were\noversampled, nonresponse, and differ-\nences between the sample and the total\nU.S. population. Because the serum con-\ncentrations were not normally distrib-\nuted, we compared geometric means by\nTable 1--Selected characteristics of the study population in men aged >20 years by diabetes\nOverall Diabetes No diabetes\nRace/ethnicity\nData are means or proportions  SE.\nSelvin and Associates\ndiabetes status. Molar ratios of tes-\ntosterone to SHBG, estradiol to\nSHBG, and estradiol to testosterone\nwere calculated and analyzed in the\nsame way.\nIn logistic regression models of\nprevalent diabetes, the highest\n(third) tertile of each hormone was\nused as the reference group and we\nadjusted for age, race/ethnicity, BMI,\nand waist-to-hip ratio, as these fac-\ntors may both influence hormone\nconcentrations and the distributions\nof which vary by diabetes status. In\nadditional logistic regression mod-\nels, we also examined the association\nof total testosterone, estradiol, and\nSHBG with diabetes after simulta-\nneously adjusting for the other two\nhormones and the risk factors listed\nabove. Simultaneous adjustment for\ntestosterone, estradiol, and SHBG al-\nlowed us to observe whether an as-\nsociation was present with one\nhormone while holding constant the\nconcentrations of the other two.\nRESULTS --Table 1 shows se-\nlected (crude) characteristics of this\nstudy population of men aged 20\nyears by diabetes status. Men with\ndiabetes were substantially older,\nmore likely to be non-Hispanic black\nor Mexican American, and had higher\nBMI and waist-to-hip ratio, highlight-\ning the importance of adjustment for\nthese factors in subsequent analyses.\nTable 2 displays the crude and\nage- and race/ethnicity-adjusted geo-\nmetric means of each hormone and\nmolar ratios by diabetes status. Total\ntestosterone and estimated bioavail-\nable testosterone concentrations\nwere lower in men with diabetes\ncompared with men without diabe-\ntes. Estradiol levels were similar in\nmen with and without diabetes.\nSHBG levels appeared higher in men\nwith diabetes but not after age and\nrace/ethnicity adjustment. Crude esti-\nmated free testosterone was lower in\nmen with diabetes, but this did not\npersist following adjustment.\nThe results from our adjusted lo-\ngistic regression models are dis-\nplayed in Tables 2 and 3. Total\ntestosterone, estradiol, SHBG, and\nAAG were not significantly associ-\nated with diabetes status after multi-\nvariable adjustment (Table 3).\nHowever, as shown in Table 4, there\nwas some evidence of an association\nbetween total testosterone and diabetes\nafter further adjustment for estradiol and\nEstimated free testosterone and bioavail-\nable testosterone were highly inversely as-\nsociated with diabetes status, even after\nmultivariable adjustment (Table 3). Men\nin the lowest tertile of free testosterone\nlevel were four times more likely to have\nprevalent diabetes compared with men in\nvalue for trend  0.04). Similarly, men in\nthe first tertile of bioavailable testosterone\nwere also approximately four times as\nlikely to have prevalent diabetes com-\npared with men in the third tertile (3.93\nThese associations persisted even after\nfurther adjustment for total cholesterol,\ntriglycerides, and systolic blood pressure\n(analyses not shown).\nWe also conducted sensitivity analy-\nses including cases of undiagnosed diabe-\ntes (diabetes defined on the basis of a\nfasting glucose alone; n  58) and exclud-\ning men with low total testosterone\nresults for estimated free testosterone and\ntotal testosterone were essentially un-\nchanged after excluding men with clini-\nparing men in the first tertile with the\nthird. The results for all models also were\nnot altered appreciably by the inclusion of\nundiagnosed diabetes in our case defini-\ntion (analyses not shown).\nCONCLUSIONS -- The indepen-\ndent association of low free and bioavail-\nable testosterone levels in our adjusted\nmodels suggest that testosterone insuffi-\nciency may be a risk factor for diabetes.\nAssociations of low free and bioavailable\ntestosterone levels with diabetes re-\nmained even after adjustment for age and\nknown confounding factors including\nrace/ethnicity and adiposity, as measured\nby BMI and waist-to-hip ratio. The asso-\nciation with low free testosterone per-\nsisted even after the exclusion of men\nwith clinically low total and/or free testos-\nterone levels, suggesting that this associa-\ntion was not entirely driven by\nhypogonadal men.\nWhile the directionality of the associ-\nations between low androgen levels and\nadiposity remain unclear, our data are\nconsistent with the hypothesis that an-\nTable 2--Crude and adjusted geometric means (95% CI) of sex steroid hormone concentrations in men aged >20 years by diabetes status, U.S. 1988\u00ad1994\nCrude geometric mean (95% CI) Adjusted geometric mean (95% CI)*\nOverall No diabetes Diabetes Overall No diabetes Diabetes\n*Adjusted for age and race/ethnicity.\nAndrogens and diabetes in men\ndrogens may directly influence glucose\nmetabolism and the development of insu-\nlin resistance independently of the effects\nof adiposity. Nonetheless, our results are\nnot as strong in magnitude as those re-\nported in some previous studies (12),\nlikely because we examined these associ-\nations in the general male population with\n\"normal\" range androgens. We did not\nobserve a clear association of total testos-\nterone concentration with diabetes. Con-\ntrary to previous studies (13\u00ad15), we did\nnot observe significantly lower levels of\nSHBG in diabetic compared with nondia-\nbetic men before or after adjustment.\nThe cross-sectional design is an im-\nportant limitation of this study. We can-\nnot determine the temporality of the\nassociations observed here between an-\ndrogen levels and diabetes. However, sev-\neral previous prospective analyses\ntestosterone level may precede the devel-\nopment of diabetes, lending support to a\ntemporal if not causal relation. Addition-\nally, including individuals with undiag-\nnosed diabetes, a population at an earlier\npoint in the progression of diabetes, did\nnot change our results. This is one of the\nlargest epidemiologic studies of andro-\ngens and diabetes in men in the published\nliterature (12); nonetheless, we were un-\nable to explore possible effect modifica-\ntion and subgroup analyses due to power\nlimitations resulting from the relatively\nsmall number of diabetic cases (n  101)\nin this general population.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy to examine the association between\nsex steroid hormones and diabetes in a\nlarge, nationally representative male pop-\nulation. Strengths of the present study\nwere the large sample and corresponding\npower to detect small differences, even\nafter adjustment for relevant covariates\nincluding measures of adiposity. Further-\nmore, we have shown here relationships\nof each major sex steroid hormone with\ndiabetes including differences by molar\nratios and multivariable models, which\nincluded simultaneous adjustment for to-\ntal testosterone, estradiol, and SHBG.\nThis study also benefited from the rigor-\nous and standardized measurement of de-\nmographic characteristics, laboratory\nanalyses, and anthropometric measures\nin the NHANES III Study.\nIn men, serum levels of testosterone\nand bioavailable testosterone decline with\nage (18); however, the clinical conse-\nquences of this decline are largely unchar-\nacterized. The literature investigating the\nassociation between androgen levels in\nmen and the development of cardiovascu-\nlar disease has been equivocal (19), with\nsome evidence of a possible protective ef-\nfect of higher testosterone levels (13,20\u00ad\n23). Diabetes is a known risk factor for the\ndevelopment of atherosclerosis and car-\ndiovascular disease. Further studies are\nneed to understand if the elevated risk of\ncardiovascular disease in hypogonadal\nmen and in men with \"low normal\" an-\ndrogen levels seen in some studies might\nbe wholly or partially mediated by the de-\nvelopment of diabetes. Additional epide-\nmiologic and etiologic studies are needed\nto clarify the mechanisms by which sex\nsteroid hormones may directly contribute\nto diabetes and other chronic diseases.\nTable 3--Adjusted* OR (95% CI) of diabetes by tertiles of sex steroid hormone concentrations, NHANES III\nQ1 (lowest) Q2 Q3 (highest) P trend\nTotal testosterone\nEstradiol (E2)\nSHBG\nAAG\nEstimated free testosterone\nEstimated bioavailable testosterone\nTotal testosterone:SHBG\n*Adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio.\nTable 4--Adjusted* OR (95% CI) of diabetes by tertiles of sex steroid hormone concentrations after mutually adjusting the hormones, NHANES\nIII\nQ1 (lowest) Q2 Q3 (highest) P trend\n*Simultaneously adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, and the other two hormones.\nSelvin and Associates\n"
