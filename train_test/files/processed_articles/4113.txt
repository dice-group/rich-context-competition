The data showed that the effect of CPFX on the viability of\ncells, as determined by neutral red uptake assay, was time-dependent, and the dose-\nresponse relation was biphasic. Cytotoxicity was not observed in the concentration\nrange 5-150 mg/l CPFX when the cells were incubated for 24 h. In contrast, lower\nconcentrations (5 and 12.5 mg/l) of CPFX increased the cell growth in all incuba-\ntion periods tested. Marked decreases in the viability of fibroblasts were observed\nrespectively (P < 0.05), However, when the cells were exposed to > 75 mg/l CPFX\nfor 48 h, no cytotoxicity was observed. By exposing fibroblast cultures to 75 mg/l\nCPFX for 48 h, an induction of LP enhancement and a marked decrease in in-\ntracellular GSH were observed, Vitamin E pretreaunent of the cells lowered the\nlevel of LP, increased the total GSII content, and provided significant protection\nagainst CPFX-induced cytotoxicity, The biphasic effect of CPFX possibly resulted\nfrom the complex dose-dependent rel.uion-drips be-tween reactive oxygen species\n(ROS), cell proliferation, and cc-Ilviabilitv.

Our recent studies on fluoro-\nquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CPFX) in human fibroblast cell cultures resulted\nin a biphasic response that appeared to be a good example for the hormesis concept\nOur interest in CPFX was started with a point of view that its adverse effects,\nparticularly phototoxicity and epileptogenic seizures, might be related to an oxida-\ntive stress induction. Considering the occurrence of oxidative radical reactions (at a\ncontinuous rate and usually in association with cellular electron transfer chains and\ncertain enzyme activities), the concept of the existence of a physiological steady-\nstate level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mammalian tissues is well accepted\n(Boveris and Cadenas, 1997). The consequences of xenobiotically induced distur-\nbances in that delicate balance are of great importance. Therefore, we investigated\nearlier the possibility of oxidative stress induction by CPFX in vivo and observed\nsignificant enhancement of lipid peroxidation (LP) and alteration of glutathione\nredox status (GSSG%) in cerebral and hepatic tissues of rats (Hincal and Taskin,\n1995). Furthermore, vitamin E or allopurinol pretreatment was found to be signif-\nicantly protective. Several investigators also reported that the phototoxic effects of\nquinolones were related to the generation of ROS, particularly singlet oxygen and\nsuperoxide anion, in the presence of lJVA irradiation in vivo and in vitro (Wagai\nIn the present study, our aim was to elucidate the involvement of oxidative stress\nand LP induction in the mechanism of action of CPFX in mammalian cells in the\nabsence of lJVA irradiation.\nChemicals\nPenicillin, streptomycin, and kanamycin were purchased from Boehringer-\nMannheim (Mannheirn, Germany), RPMI1640 medium and fetal calfserum (FCS)\nfrom Biological Industries (Israel), sodium bicarbonate 7.5% and Puck's saline A\nfrom Gibco (Scotland), fungizone from Squibb (Princeton, N], USA) and Tris from\nMerck (Darmstad, Germany). CPFX was a gift from Deva Laboratory (Istanbul,\nTurkey). The other chemicals, including a-tocopherol (vitamin E), were purchased\nfrom Sigma (Saint Louis, MO, USA).\nBiphasic Response of Ciprofloxacin\nCell Culture\nPrimary cell lines of fibroblasts were prepared after skin biopsy from voluntary\nhealthy adults aged 20-40 years. Dilacerated skin samples were incubated in calf-\nserum-rich culture medium [RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% FCS,\nL-glutamine (1.8 mM), penicillin (180 Uz'rnl}, streptomycin (180 mg/l), kanamycin\n(56 mg/l), and fungizone (0.9 mg/l)] at 37\u00b0C, in a humid atmosphere containing\nand 95% air (Forma, Scientific incubator) in 75 cm 2 plastic culture flasks\n(Nunc, Denmark) by the method of Hom (1976). The cells were re-fed two times a\nweek with fresh medium, split every seventh day, and the cells of5 and 10 subcultures\nwere used for the experiments.\nCytotoxicity Assay\nBefore exposure to CPFX, the cells were incubated for 24 h to allow adherence and\ninitiation of proliferation. CPFX was then added to the medium in eight different\ndoses to achieve final concentrations ranging from 5 to 150 mg/l, and the cells were\nincubated for 24, 48, or 72 h. Each concentration of drug was tested in triplicate.\nAll CPFX solutions were freshly prepared and protected from light (covered by\naluminum foil). During all treatment procedures, all culture flasks and petri dishes\nwere protected in the same way.\nNeutral red (NR) uptake assay for the determination of potential cytotoxicity\nof CPFX was performed by the method of Borenfreund and Puerner (1985). The\naccumulation of i\\R in lysosornes of viable cells was determined after an extraction\nprocess. The absorbance value of samples was read at 540 nrn and was corrected by\nsubtracting the mean absorbance value of cell-free controls. Results were expressed\nas the percent value (percent survival) of the mean absorbance of drug-free control\ncells.\nTo examine the protective effect of ,itamin E, the cells were preincnbated with\n50 Il~ vitamin E for 4 hand then exposed to 75 mg/l CPFX [or 48 h. The viability\nof the cells was evaluated by the NR uptake assay as described.\nDetermination of LP, Total GSH Level, and Antioxidant Enzyme Activities\nAfter incubation with 75 mg/l CPFX for 48 h, with or without !'i0 liM vitamin E\npretreatment, the cells were trvpsinized, resuspended in fresh mer [ia, and pelleted by\ncentrifugation. Pellet was washed three times with isotonic Tris-HCl (O.2mM, pH 7.4)\nbuffer, then resuspended in hypotonic Tris-l l'Cl buffer, pH 7.3, and grounded in a\npotter homogenizer at SOgfor 5 min. The lvsaie was used for the determination ofLP,\nthe total intracellular glulathiouf' (GSII) content, and the activities of antioxidant\nenzymes.\nLP was measured fluorometically as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances\n(TBARS) using a Perkin-Elmer model LS 50 fluorometer by the method of Richard\nFor the measurement of the total GSH: content, the lysate was diluted with\nmetaphosphoric acid (6%) [(lysate: metaphosphoric acid (5:1, v/v)], centrifuged at\nF. HincaI et al,\n1500g, 4\u00b0C, for 10 min, and supernatant was used for the total GSH determination\nby the method ofAkerboom and Sies (1981) as we described earlier (Emonet et al.,\nAfter further centrifugation of the cell lysate at 1500g, 4\u00b0C, for 10 min, superoxide\ndismutases (SODs), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and catalase (CAT) activities\nwere determined in the supernatant. The activities of total SOD, Mn SOD, and\nCuZn SOD were assessed by monitoring auto-oxidation of pyrogallol according to a\nprocedure adapted to the cells (Parat et al., 1998). The GPX activity was assessed by\nusing the method of Gunzler et at. (1974). The CAT activity was quantitated using\nthe method of Aebi (1984) by following the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide\nAll results were expressed as values normalized to the cell protein content, and\nprotein concentrations in the homogenate (total protein) were determined by the\nprocedure described by Shopsis and Mackay (1984) or in the supernatant (soluble\nprotein) according to the method of Lowry et at. (1951).\nStatistics\nThe two-tailed Mann-Whithney Ustest was employed to calculate statistical signif-\nicance between control and treated groups.\nRESULTS\nEffect of CPFX on the Survival of Normal Human Fibroblast Cells\nThe effect of CPFX on the viability of normal human fibroblast cells, as deter-\nmined by the NR assay, is illustrated in Figure 1. The data show that the effect of\nCPFX on the viability ofcells was time-dependent, and the dose-response relation was\nbiphasic. Cytotoxicity was not observed in the concentration range of 5-150 mg/l\nCPFX when the cells were incubated for 24 h. In contrast, lower concentrations (5\nand 12.5 mg/l) of CPFX increased the cell survival in all incubation periods tested.\nMarked decreases in the viability of fibroblasts were observed at concentrations of\n0.05). When the cells were exposed to > 75 mg/l CPFX for 48 h, no cytotoxicity was\nobserved. However, at the same concentration range following the 72 h incubation\nperiod, viability of the cells decreased compared to controls and 48 h.\nEffect of Vitamin E on the Cytotoxic Effect of CPFX\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, when vitamin E-pretreated fibroblasts were exposed\nto 75 mg/l CPFX for 48 h, the cell survival significantly increased compared to\nEffects of CPFX and CPFX Plus Vitamin E on LP, Total GSH Level,\nand Antioxidant Enzyme Activities\nBy exposing fibroblast cultures to 75 mg/l CPFX for 48 h, an induction of LP\nenhancement and a marked decrease in intracellular GSH were observed (Fig. 3).\nBiphasic Response of Ciprofloxacin\n-\ne\n::::l\nv:\na\nCPFX (mgtl)\n...\n::::l\nrJl\n=\na\nCPFX (mg/l)\n...\n::::l\nrJl\n~\na\nCPFX (mg/l)\nFigure 1.

Hincal et al.\nDISCUSSION\nQuinolones are potent antimicrobials with a broad spectrum of activity and\nare effective against a wide range of infections caused by gram-positive and gram-\nnegative bacteria, including Bacillusanthracis(Wolfson and Hooper, 1985; Blondeau,\n1999). They exert their bactericidal effect by inhibiting the bacterial DNA gyrase,\na type II topoisomerase (Gellert, 1981; Gootz et al., 1990). However, the influence\nof quinolones on mammalian DNA topoisomerases is several orders of magnitude\nweaker than prokaryotic topoisomerase II (Wolfson and Hooper, 1985; Hussy et al.,\n1986). They have the advantage of possessing a relatively good phannacokinetic\nprofile and bioavailability, and ease of oral dosing (Blondeau, 1999). In addition,\ncompared to other commonly used antimicrobial agents, quinolones are considered\nrelatively well tolerated. However, clinical experience has indicated that they have\nsome undesirable adverse effects including cutaneous reactions like phototoxicity,\njuvenile cartilage toxicity, and, although the incidence is very low, adverse central\nnervous system reactions including epileptogenic convulsions (Wolfson and Hooper,\nadverse effects is still unknown. On the other hand, the capacity of quinolones to\ninhibit cell growth and cell functions in various cell lines in vitro was well docu-\net al., 1993, 1996). Inhibition of the cell cycle and cell size progression in mitogen-\nstimulated human lymphocytes was reported (Forsgren et al., 1987), and CPFX was\nshown to have cytotoxic effects on both murine and human carcinoma cells in vitro\n(Zehavi-Willner and Shalit, 1992). Interfering denovopyrimidine synthesis (Forsgren\net al., 1987) or mitochondrial enzymes involved in energy metabolism (Lawrence et\nal., 1993) were suggested as the underlying mechanisms. However, in none of these\npublications was a biphasic dose-response curve reported. Results were presented\nto be dose-dependent; thus, with high concentrations of quinolone antibiotics, in-\ncluding CPFX, growth of various cultured mammalian cells was inhibited (Hussy\nCytotoxicity started at concentrations over 20 mg/l, more often in the range 40-\n80 mg/l, and complete growth inhibition was frequently observed at concentrations\nIn the present study, CPFX inhibited the proliferation of normal human fibrob-\nlast cells at a similar dose range as previously described. The inhibitory effect was\nobserved at concentrations of 50 and 75 lUg/I, and ::::50 lUg/I, when cells were in-\ncubated for 48 or 72 h, respectively. However, the effect of CPFX on the viability of\ncells was time-dependent, and the dose-response relation was biphasic. Low doses\nof CPFX appeared to be stimulatory at all incubation periods, whereas cytotoxicity\nwas not observed in the whole concentration range tested (5-150 mg/l) during the\n24 h of incubation. This delayed effect was pointed out earlier by Lawrence et at.\n(1996) and was described as a usual feature of the CPFX-induced growth inhibi-\ntion. Depending on the type of cells, the lag period was 2-4 days and corresponded\nBiphasic Response of Ciprofloxacin\napproximately to 3-4 cell doublings. They further observed a time-dependent de-\ncrease in cellular content of mtDNA prior to inhibition of cell proliferation with\nCPFX and related the observed cytotoxicity to the disturbances in the mitochon-\ndria. Their conclusion was that the inhibition of mammalian cell proliferation by\nCPFX is related to selective depletion ofmtDNA through an interference with mito-\nchondrial topoisomerase type II-like activity. Although we did not measure mtDNA\ndamage in this study, this mechanism might also be an explanation for the lag period\nwe observed.\nThe biphasic effect observed in the presentstudymay also resultfrom the complex\ndose-response relationship among ROS, cell proliferation, and cell viability, ROS are\ninvolved in cellular processes as diverse as proliferation, and cell death (Pervaiz and\nClement,2002). A growing body of evidence suggests that ROS, such as superoxide\nanions and hydrogen peroxide, function as intracellular second messengers involved\nin cellular signaling and, thus, can influence the growth as well as the death of the\ncell (Finkel, 1998; Clement and Pervaiz, 1999). In fact, it is well described by several\ncell models, including fibroblasts, that ROS exert a biphasic effect on cell growth\nprevious study with paraquat on HeLa cells (Seve et al., 1999), lower doses increase\nproliferation and higher doses lead to cell death by apoptosis or necrosis (Buttke\nand Dandstrom, 1994). In addition, cultured fibroblasts were reported to release\ntheir own free radicals (Murell et al., 1990). Their proliferation was inhibited when\nendogenous ROS were inhibited, whereas the effect ofexogenous ROS was biphasic.\nThe data obtained in the present study also showed the occurrence ofoxidative stress\nin fibroblast cell proliferation. Exposure of fibroblast cultures to 75 mg/l CPFX for\n48 h induced a significant level of LP and a marked decrease in intracellular GSH.\nThese observations were further supported by the data obtained with vitamin E\npretreatment of cells and were in good agreement with our previous in vivo results\nobtained in CPFX-treated rats (Hine'al and Taskin, 1995).\nConsidering the aforementioned facts and arguments, the overall interpretation\nof the results of the present study might be as follows. If fibroblasts need a certain\nlevel ofROS to proliferate, and if CPFX not only interferes with mtD:\\'A replication,\nbut also introduces ROS into the system, there might be a certain point at which a\nsensitive balance is established. Cell doubling time of fibroblasts is 22 h (Baudhuin,\n1975), hence, when fibroblasts are exposed to 75 mg/l CPFX for 48 h, two full cell\ndoublings may occur and Ill(' extent of dilution in the cellular content of mtDNA\nmight reach a critical point that is not sufficient to sustain the cell growth. However,\nthe level of ROS induced by higher concentrations (:::100 mg/l) of CPFX might\ncompensate for the effect of such a level of loss in mtDNA and, hence, the cells\ncontinue to grow. In fact, when exposure time was increased to 72 h, the cell viability\nand growth was affected starting with doses over 25 mg/l and continued to decrease\nin a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, more than one biochemical effect, such as\noxygen radicals, and mitochondrial loss might be responsive at different doses for\nthe cytotoxicity of CPFX, and the juxtaposition of these mechanisms might result in\nF. Hincal et al.\nthe biphasic aspect of the survival curves. Nevertheless, further studies combining\nmtDNA and ROS measurements at different time points and concentrations are\nneeded for making a precise conclusion.\nFree radical production due to exogenous chemicals occurs either during the di-\nrect redox cycling of the compound or metabolization by cytochrome P450. For\nCPFX, it is possible that the generation of ROS may occur during its oxidative\nmetabolism (Sorgel, 1989). In fact, in our recent study performed with hepatic rat\nmicrosomes, we observed the induction of free radical production by CPFX, which\nwas inhibited completely by a cytochrome P450 inhibitor, SKF525A (Giirbay et al.,\nThe results we obtained for antioxidant enzymes were not conclusive, and it ap-\npears that the effect of CPFX at this dose level and time period was not enough to\nproduce any significant changes in the antioxidant enzyme activities.\nIn conclusion, CPFX exerted a hormetic-like dose-response in normal human\nfibroblast cell cultures. The biphasic effect of CPFX possibly resulted from the com-\nplex dose-dependent relationships among ROS, cell proliferation, and cell viability,\nas well as a selective depletion ofmtDNA through an interference with mitochondrial\ntopoisomerase type II-like activity.\nREFERENCES\nAkerboom, TPM, and Sies, H (1981).
