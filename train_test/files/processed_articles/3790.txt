Using Poisson inverse Gaussian (PIG) regression,\nin this comment, I demonstrate that both papers' findings are sensitive to empirical specifications. In many model\nspecifications, women are cited less than men, but other specifications either show a null effect or that women are\nactually cited more than men in international relations. This illustrates that substantive model selections matter a great\ndeal for the conclusions we can make from our data.\n",

While not the first study within the social sci-\nences on citation gaps, Maliniak et al. (2013) showed that a\ngender gap was detectable in international relations (IR)\ncitation patterns. They find that across 10 different model\nspecifications, `all female'IR articles are cited significantly\nless than articles by men. This matters because citations\noften equate to research impact and impact affects tenure\ndecisions, promotions, and job opportunities.\nZigerell's (2015) recent article in this journal shows that\nchanging the model specifications through including or\nremoving variables, restricting the data to various percen-\ntiles, expanding the time line, and including other types of\narticles, that Maliniak et al.'s findings are not robust. Based\non these findings, Zigerell (2015) simply cautions readers\nto consider nuances in the citation gap in IR.\nIn this comment, I use Poisson inverse Gaussian (PIG)\nregression to replicate both Maliniak et al.'s and Zigerell's\nanalysis of the IR citation gap. The PIG model is ideal for\ncount distributions where there is a large initial peak and\nthen a very long tail of observations (Hilbe, 2014). Citation\ndata almost perfectly fit such a distribution: most articles\nreceive a handful of citations, while a few pieces receive\nthousands. In the replications, I show that PIG is the pre-\nferred model for all of Maliniak et al.'s and nearly all of\nZigerell's specifications, and that both articles make valid\npoints on the existence and scope of a gender gap in IR\ncitations. However, a gender gap is only observable in\nsome of Maliniak et al.'s models, and not all, and a gender\ngap is observable in many of Zigerell's models, and not\njust two.\nBelow I briefly discuss the PIG model before moving to\nthe replications.\nPIG regression\nSince King (1988), most political and social scientists\nunderstand that using linear regression is problematic when\ndealing with count distributions. Further, most researchers\nare aware that due to ubiquitous overdispersion negative\nPoisson inverse Gaussian regression\non citation data\nBrian J Fogarty\n Keywords\nCount models, Poisson inverse Gaussian regression, citation data, International relations\nUniversity of Glasgow, UK\nCorresponding author:\nBrian J Fogarty, School of Social and Political Sciences, University of\nEmail: brian.fogartyb@glasgow.ac.uk\nResearch Note\n2 Research and Politics \nbinomial (NB) regression is almost always preferred to\nPoisson regression. However, other count models have yet\nto be widely adopted throughout the social sciences. PIG is\none such model.\nThe PIG model is actually quite similar to the NB\nmodel, where both include a dispersion parameter and are\na mixture of two distributions (NB is a mixture of Poisson\nand gamma distributions, while PIG is a mixture of Poisson\nand inverse Gaussian distributions).1 The specific differ-\nence between PIG and NB is that PIG includes a cubic\nvariance function ( \u00b5 \u00b5\n+ 3 ), while NB (in the standard\nNB2 parameterization) includes a squared variance function\n( \u00b5 \u00b5\n+ 2 ) (Cameron and Trivedi, 2013). This simple dif-\nference, though, allows PIG to better handle long-tailed\ncount data (Cameron and Trivedi, 2013). In this paper, the\nPIG model uses a variant of the Sichel distribution since it\nis how the user-written Stata PIG command is parametrized\n(Hardin and Hilbe, 2012); however, see Cameron and\nTrivedi (2013) for a brief discussion of several other\nparameterizations.2\nReplications\nTable 2 all show that `all female' international relations\npublications receive significantly (at the 0.05 or 0.10 lev-\nels) fewer citations than publications by men. In Table 1, I\nreplicate their models using their original NB model and\nthe PIG model. For ease of presentation, I only include the\n`all female' results and the Akaike information criteria\n(AIC) for model comparison.\nLooking first at the AIC values, we see that the PIG\nmodel is preferred over NB for all 10 models. Not only\ndoes the PIG model make intuitive sense to use over NB,\ndue to the distribution of the data, but the PIG model fits the\ndata better than NB. Therefore, we have more confidence in\nthe results from the PIG model than the NB model.\nFigure 1 graphically illustrates the distribution of the\ncitation data and fitted probabilities for the NB and PIG\ndistributions. First, observe the heavily skewed distribution\nwhere a bulk of the observations occur early on but obser-\nvations still exist out to 1084. Second, note that the PIG\ndistribution fits the early counts slightly better than the NB\ndistribution. However, as noted above, the PIG distribu-\ntion's main benefit is in fitting the tail end of count distribu-\ntions; which unfortunately is difficult to graphically\ndemonstrate with the citation data.\nIn examining the results for `all female', we see that pub-\nlications by women are cited significantly less in models 1,\n2, 3, 7, 9, and 10. In the other four models, there is no statis-\ntically significant result for `all female'. However, one could\nargue that since `all female'is significant in Maliniak et al.'s\n`kitchen sink'model (model 10) that a gender gap does exist\nin IR citations. Further, in the PIG results where `all female'\nis significant, the effect size is smaller than in the NB results.\nFor example, in model 1 using NB, an all female article\ndecreases the expected number of citations by 4.96; while\nusing PIG, an all female article decreases the expected num-\nber of citations by just 0.556.3 There would be less to criti-\ncize if Maliniak et al. only included the `kitchen sink'model\nNotes: Cells are coefficients and standard errors for negative binomial (NB) and Poisson inverse Gaussian (PIG) regression, along with Akaike\ninformation criteria (AIC) for each model. Each model comparison has equal N. * p < 0.10, **p < 0.05.\nin their original paper. But, by trying to show `all female' is\nalways significant in a succession of models, a version of\nsensitivity analysis (Angrist and Pischke, 2010), we actually\nfind that Maliniak et al.'s findings are sensitive to what\npredictors are included in a model. This is an example where\nsubstantively justifying why certain predictors are included\nin an analysis may be a better approach than atheoretically\ntrying various combinations of predictors.\nFigure 1.

The bins are observed count frequency density and the spikes are the predicted count\nprobabilities.\nNotes: Cells are coefficients and standard errors for negative binomial (NB) and Poisson inverse Gaussian (PIG) regression, along with Akaike\ninformation criteria (AIC) for each model. Each model comparison has equal N. * p < 0.10, **p < 0.05.\n4 Research and Politics \nZigerell's (2015) main approach is to question the predic-\ntors and data used in Maliniak et al.'s study through a series\nof NB regressions. As nicely illustrated in Figure 1 of\nZigerell (2015), he systematically removes certain predic-\ntors, adds in other predictors and new data, and trims the\ntop percentiles across 15 models of the citation data.\nZigerell finds that besides from the `kitchen sink' model,\nthere is only one other instance where a statistically signifi-\ncant citation gap exists between men and women in IR cita-\ntions: a model that includes the temporal and geographical\nfoci of the studies.As above, in Table 2, I replicate Zigerell's\nfindings using both NB and PIG models, and only include\nthe `all female' results and AIC.4\nFirst examining the AIC values, we see that the PIG\nmodel is preferred over NB for 14 of the 15 models; how-\never, PIG is only slightly preferred over NB in model 15. In\nmodel 13, the NB model is likely preferred over the PIG\nmodel because the top 10% of cited articles are excluded,\nand thus the long tails that PIG is ideal for modeling no\nlonger exist. On the whole, as with the Maliniak et al. speci-\nfications, PIG makes better intuitive and statistical sense to\nuse than NB regression.\nThe PIG model produces considerably different results\nthan the NB model for the `all female' predictor. I find\nthat `all female' is statistically significant for models 1\u00ad7,\nficient for `all female' is actually positive for models 14\ngeographic focus predictors, excludes years controls, ten-\nured female, and coed papers predictors, and additionally\ntrims the top 2% of non-coed citations. Model 15 is the\noriginal `kitchen sink' model and trims the top 5% of\nnon-coed citations. The positive coefficient indicates that\nwomen are cited more than men in IR when heavily cited\nnon-coed papers are excluded. Like Maliniak et al., the\nreplications of Zigerell's models suggest that conclusions\nabout the existence of a gender gap in IR citations is sen-\nsitive to the data chosen and the construction of the\nConclusion\nThe replication results using Poisson inverse Gaussian\nregression are inconclusive about the existence of a gender\ngap in international relations citation patterns. Women are\ncertainly not always cited less than men and in some circum-\nstances might be cited more than men. There is some evi-\ndence that a gender gap may exist, but as mentioned above,\nit appears considerably subject to the substantive choices\nmade on the data and predictors included in models.\nWhile the main point of this comment is to illustrate the\nuse of the PIG model for social science count data, the anal-\nysis does not definitively settle what is the best model or\ntechnique for analyzing IR citation data. To do so, we may\nprefer an experimental or quasi-experimental design; some-\nthing which the citation data cannot provide. As discussed\nby Leamer (1983), the replications here serve as a form of\nsensitivity analysis using a statistical technique that appears\nto better fit the data-generating process.\n"
