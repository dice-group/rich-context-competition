The clin-\nical significance of the methylation status\nwas determined by analysing the correl-\nations with clinicopathological features and\ndisease outcomes.\nPatients and methods\nPatients and specimens\nThis prospective study enrolled consecutive\npatients with primary prostate cancer who\nattended the Department of Urology, The\nThird Hospital of Hebei Medical\nUniversity, Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province,\nInclusion criteria were: first histopatho-\nlogical diagnosis of prostate cancer by\nprostate biopsy; no history of other malig-\nnant tumours. Histological grading of each\ntumour was determined according to the\nGleason score;16 disease stage was\ndetermined according to the clinical\ntumour\u00adnode\u00admetastasis classification\nsystem of the American Joint Committee\non Cancer (T1\n),17 and the treatment\nstrategy used for each patient was accord-\ning to international guidelines.18 Patients\nwere followed up according to inter-\nnational guidelines.18 The control group\nconsisted of inpatients with benign pros-\ntatic hyperplasia (BPH), patients with\nbladder stones and healthy volunteers\nwho were attending the same hospital.\nControls were age-matched with prostate\ncancer patients and provided whole-blood\nsamples for serum production. The inclu-\nsion criteria for the control subjects were:\nno history of malignant tumours; serum\nPSA concentration <4 ng/ml.\nWhole peripheral blood samples (5 ml)\nwere obtained, prior to any treatment, from\nboth the patients and control subjects. These\nsamples were then left at room temperature\ncentrifuge (Thermo Fisher Scientific,\nRockford, IL, USA), and the serum was\nremoved and stored at \u00c080C until analysis.\nSerum PSA concentrations were determined\nusing a PSA enzyme immunoassay kit\n(Beijing Sanyuan Gene Engineering,\nBeijing, China) according to the manufac-\nturer's instructions.\nThe study was conducted in accordance\nwith the Declaration of Helsinki and\napproved by the Ethics Committee of the\nThird Hospital of Hebei Medical University\nWritten informed consent was obtained\nfrom all study participants.\nDNA extraction and MSP\nDNA was extracted from 500 ml of serum\n(QIAmp DNA Blood Mini Kit; Qiagen,\nValencia, CA, USA), then treated with\nbisulphite to convert any unmethylated\n(but not methylated) cytosine residues to\nuracil (EpiTect Bisulfite Kit; Qiagen) as\npreviously reported.19 The methylation\nstatus of the CDH13 gene was examined\nusing MSP, as described previously.13,20\nBriefly, the primers for the methylated reac-\ntion were as follows: CDH13 methylated\namplify a 243-base pair (bp) product\n(Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering\nTechnology & Services, Shanghai, China).\nThe primer sequences of CDH13 for the\nunmethylated reaction were as follows:\nunmethylated antisense, 50-AACTTTTC\nATTCATACACACA-30, which amplify a\n242-bp product (Shanghai Sangon\nBiological Engineering Technology &\nServices). The PCR reactions were carried\nout using ZymoTaqTM DNA polymerase\nand ZymoTaqTM PreMix (Zymo Research\nCorporation, Irvine, CA, USA) in a thermal\ncycler (BD Biosciences, Hercules, CA,\nUSA). PCR amplification of the modified\nDNA samples consisted of preliminary\ndenaturation at 95C for 5 min, followed\nannealing at 60C for 1 min, and elongation\nat 72C for 1 min for the unmethylated\nreaction; or 29 cycles of denaturation at\nand elongation at 72C for 1 min for the\nmethylated reaction; followed by a final\nelongation step at 72C for 5 min.\nNormal lymphocyte DNA methylated\nin vitro with CpG methyltransferase (SssI\nmethylase; New England Biolabs, Beverly,\nMA, USA) was used as a methylation\npositive control, and normal lymphocyte\nDNA was used as an unmethylation positive\ncontrol. Water blanks were included within\neach assay. The PCR products were sepa-\nrated in 2% agarose gel, stained with eth-\nidium bromide, and visualized under\nultraviolet illumination. Samples were\nscored as methylation positive when methy-\nlated alleles were present in the methylated\nDNA lane and methylation negative when\nbands were present only in the unmethylated\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed\nusing the SAS\u00d5 statistical package, version\n8.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). For\nstatistical purposes, serum samples were\ndivided into two tumour-grade categories\n(Gleason score 7 versus >7); patients\nwere categorized by age groups (<65\nversus !65 years) and according to the\nml).21 Fisher's exact test was used to\nevaluate the difference in the CDH13\ngene methylation status between patients\nwith prostate cancer and control subjects.\n2-test was used to assess the correlations\nbetween CDH13 methylation and clinico-\npathological features of disease. Kaplan\u00ad\nMeier survival analysis and log-rank test\nwere used to assess the difference in 5-year\noverall survival between patients with pros-\ntate cancer with methylated and unmethy-\nlated CDH13. Multivariate Cox\nproportional hazard model analysis was\nused to estimate the independent prognos-\ntic effect of CDH13 methylation, control-\nling for the classic risk factors of age,\ntumour stage, Gleason score and PSA. A\ntwo-sided P-value <0.05 was considered to\nindicate statistical significance.\nResults\nThis study analysed the methylation status\nof the CDH13 gene in serum samples col-\nlected from 98 patients with prostate cancer\nand 47 age-matched control subjects using\nMSP.

The detailed clinicopathological\nfeatures of the patients with prostate cancer\nare shown in Table 1. Analysis of the\nassociation between the methylation status\nof CDH13 and the demographic, clinical\nand pathological features demonstrated that\nCDH13 methylation in serum was signifi-\ncantly associated with an increased Gleason\nciation between CDH13 methylation and\nage (Table 1).\nSurvival data were available from all\npatients with prostate cancer. Overall sur-\nvival was defined as the time from date of\ndiagnosis until date of death from any cause,\nor last contact if the patient was still alive\n(range: 9\u00ad60 months). When the methyla-\ntion status of the CDH13 gene promoter was\ncorrelated with the overall survival of\npatients with prostate cancer, patients with\nunmethylated CDH13 had better outcomes\nthan patients with methylated CDH13\nvariate Cox proportional hazard model\nanalysis was carried out to estimate the\nindependent prognostic effect of CDH13\nmethylation, controlling for the classic risk\nfactors of age, tumour stage, Gleason score\nand PSA.

Such findings suggest that CDH13\nmethylation may play a crucial role in\nprostate cancer, which provides the ration-\nale for undertaking this present study, to\nevaluate the clinical significance of CDH13\nmethylation in the serum of patients with\nprostate cancer.\nIn the current study, the methylation of\nCDH13 in serum specimens from patients\nwith prostate cancer and control subjects\nwas analysed using MSP. The analysis\ndemonstrated that CDH13 methylation\noccurred frequently in patients with prostate\ncancer, while no methylation was found in\nthe control subjects. Moreover, CDH13\nmethylation was also observed in patients\nwith stage T1\ndisease. These current\nfindings suggest that CDH13 methylation is\ntumour specific and an early event during the\npathogenesis of prostate cancer. The results\nindicated that CDH13 methylation was\nassociated with an increased Gleason score,\nan advanced tumour stage, and a high serum\nPSA level, suggesting that CDH13 methyla-\ntion in serum is correlated with the clinical\nrisk factors of death. In addition, the 5-year\noverall survival of patients with prostate\ncancer was examined according to the\nmethylation status of CDH13 in serum.\nCDH13 methylation was associated with\nadverse 5-year overall survival. Moreover,\nmultivariate Cox proportional hazard model\nanalysis indicated that the methylation of\nCDH13 was independently associated with a\nstatistically significant increased risk of\ndetermination of CDH13 methylation in\nserum may convey relevant prognostic infor-\nmation and may become a useful predictor\nof disease outcomes in the future.\nIn conclusion, aberrant CDH13 pro-\nmoter methylation in serum correlates with\nthe clinical risk factors of death and was\nsignificantly associated with a worse disease\noutcome. Current findings suggest that aber-\nrant CDH13 promoter methylation may be\nused as a novel biomarker and a potential\ntherapeutic target for prostate cancer.\nHowever, this present study was limited by\na small sample size, and future multicentre\nstudies with larger sample sizes are needed,\nto confirm whether CDH13 promoter\nmethylation in serum could be used as a\nnovel predictor of overall survival in\npatients with prostate cancer.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of\ninterests.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
