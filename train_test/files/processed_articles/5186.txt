First, it is a question that has\nbeen neglected in studies of scepticism and sceptics. Scholarly\nand popular attention has centered on the cultural, ideological,\nmaterial, and psychological contexts of the sceptical phenom-\nenon. Second, the core views of sceptics, particularly the prom-\ninent publicists, filter through to the public.Those in the general\npublic who are receptive would be inclined, one might assume,\nto appropriate these arguments of the sceptic elites. In addition,\nthirdly, if one wished to counter or neutralize the sceptical argu-\nments, a thorough understanding is necessary of the types of\nobjections raised by sceptics to both the substance and conduct\nof mainstream climate science.\nTaking notice of sceptics' express objections to the sub-\nstance and conduct of mainstream climate science would\naddress one of the most enduring criticisms that sceptics\nhave continued to level against mainstream exponents,\nnamely that mainstream exponents are uncritically foreclos-\ning debate, and in the process become guilty of the exact\nsame thing they are accusing the sceptics of, namely, protect-\ning their vested interests, group-think, and pushing an ideo-\nlogical agenda.\nCritical exposure of the machinations and sociopsycho-\nlogical biases of certain sceptics can be helpful,2 yet we\nargue that progress in the climate debate will be better\nadvanced through open discussion and testing of arguments\nin the public sphere. Progress will not be achieved by avoid-\ning direct engagement with the specific claims of sceptics.\nInstead, we envision a long, hard-fought victory in which the\nscientific evidence debate should occupy the foreground. We\npropose that not all sceptics are of the entrenched/obstinate\nkind, and that many sceptics sincerely share the values of\ntransparency, critical freedom, and inclusivity associated\nwith serious scientific enquiry.\nThe article elaborates this argument by first describing the\nprevailing depictions of climate change scepticism in the\nscholarly literature, followed by a consideration of the dif-\nferential influences of scepticism at lay and elite levels. We\nthen outline the specific (Australian) context of the sceptic\nviews that will be canvassed, followed by a brief explanation\nof how we have used the textual analysis tool, Leximancer,\nto unpack some key texts. The main sceptical objections are\nmapped and cataloged, followed by a discussion of their sig-\nnificance and structure. The article concludes with some\nremarks about a way forward in dealing with climate change\nscepticism.\n1University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nBrian W.

Scholars claim that\nsceptics' opposition to mainstream climate science and cli-\nmate mitigation policies is, in fact, a smokescreen for\ndeeper values and consequent disputes about social and\nClimate change scholarship argues that governments need\nto steer their economies away from heavy reliance on fos-\nsil fuels, entailing a major transition with costly adjust-\nments. As such, the role of government, the role of the free\nmarket in determining the allocation of resources, and the\nprevailing consumerist culture in general have come under\nquestion. In short, the prevailing status quo is challenged\nby science-driven plans to reduce society's reliance on\nindustrial technologies that emit large concentrations of\ngreenhouse gas (GHG), and it is this threat, scholars and\nobservers insist, that sceptics are really targeting through\ntheir challenging of mainstream climate science (Boussalis\n& Coan, 2013, p. 3). The climate issues trigger, it is argued,\na defensive reaction from political conservatives (McCright\nThe worldview/ideological roots of climate change\nscepticism have been explored in the work of, among oth-\ners, Peter Jacques, McCright and Dunlap, and Clive\nHamilton. For Jacques, climate change scepticism is a spe-\ncies within the broader genus of \"environmental scepti-\ncism,\" and stems from a deep anthropocentrism among\nideological conservatives (Jacques, 2006). In his view,\nenvironmental scepticism \"guards against paradigmatic\nchanges to world dominant social values and institutions\nthat guide global accumulation and concentration of power\"\ncism is a defense of economic modernity. McCright and\nDunlap propose a similar thesis, describing climate change\nscepticism as one of the strategies deployed by conserva-\ntives to counter or undermine environmental \"moderniza-\ntion\" and associated policy reforms (McCright & Dunlap,\nscepticism as central to conservatives' persistent efforts to\nblock the policy strategies of \"environmentalism,\" which\nthey see as a major threat to Western notions of prosperity\nThe idea that climate change has become a battleground\nfor conflicting worldviews is also argued by some politi-\ncal anthropologists. The school of Cultural Theory associ-\nated with the work of Douglas, Wildavsky, and Thompson\nproposes that individuals, when faced with a challenge,\ntend to favor solutions and strategies consistent with the\n\"worldview\" associated with their \"cultural type\" (Verweij\nmost associated with climate change scepticism is the\n\"individualist,\" who according to Thompson favors \"indi-\nvidual pursuit of rational self-interest\" and \"the optimal\nallocation of resources\" through free markets (Thompson,\ncounter climate change might require major regulatory\ninterventions to reduce GHG-intensive production, but\nsuch policy transformations would run counter to the indi-\nvidualist preference for free markets and limited govern-\nment. As noted by Verweij and colleagues, individualists\nwould tend to discount both the scientific basis of climate\nmitigation policies and the merits of response policies. By\ncontrast, the individualists would tend to favor perspec-\ntives, consistent with their worldview, that nature is resil-\nient and that human innovation and entrepreneurship offer\nthe best prospect for addressing environmental challenges\nOther scholars have drawn on cognitive psychology for\nidentifying distinct cognitive processes that might contribute\nto an individual's stance on the climate issue. Mechanisms\nsuch as cognitive dissonance avoidance and assimilation bias\nhave been found to distort the interpretive powers of the indi-\nWhitmarsh, Seyfang, & O'Neill, 2011). These mechanisms\nexplain the significance of ideological, cultural, and other\nsocial predispositional influences. Avoidance of cognitive\ndissonance is the main cognitive-psychological process iden-\ntified by scholars as helping to explain sceptics' resistance to\nthe evidence of human-induced climate change. According\nto Upham et al. (2009), individuals tend to notice and inte-\ngrate information supporting their existing cognitive sche-\nmas, while ignoring or rejecting inconsistent information. If\na conflict arises, people will \"typically act to reduce the cog-\nnitive dissonance by changing their attitude to justify their\nbehaviour, claiming (or perceiving) to have little or no choice\nin their action, or denying any inconsistency\" (Upham et al.,\nScholars have also noted other cognitive heuristics or\nshortcuts, which might facilitate individual biases and\nmisjudgments. Nisbett and Ross (1980) have cataloged\ndiverse ways in which humans err in their judgments,\nmany of which have been applied to explaining climate\nbeliefs. The role of social groups and peer influence have\nbeen widely documented as shaping people's responses to\nIndividuals are inclined to, belong to, and remain loyal to\n\"affinity groups central to their personal wellbeing\"\nA sharply critical interpretation of climate change scepti-\ncism has drawn on the notion that such views are potentially\npathological.According to this view, sceptics, especially those\nVan Rensburg and Head 3\nengaging in public debate, display some of the behaviors con-\nsistent with the \"paranoid style\"--a term used by Richard\nHofstadter (1964) to describe the irrational behavior of extrem-\nist fringe elements. According to this claim, sceptics may\nexhibit the paranoid personality's sense of disconnection and\nalienation from the mainstream, and defensively attribute\nblame to specific enemies. Sceptics are, in the paranoid style,\nboth irrational and extreme in their views. The theme of scep-\ntic irrationalism is often used by champions of climate science\n(e.g., Hoegh-Guldberg, 2013). A related accusation is that\nsceptics indulge in conspiracy theories. Some scholars have\npointed to impact of the sceptics' suspicions that \"green\nextremists\" and \"self-serving scientists\" are manipulating the\nries may influence public opinion about the integrity and\nstrength of mainstream climate claims (Diethelm & McKee,\nThe above constructions of climate change scepticism\nfacilitate two interpretations of the phenomenon. A \"hard\"\nand critical interpretation holds that climate change scepti-\ncism is a contrived and ideological phenomenon. Sceptics\ndeliberately manufacture heightened doubts about the core\nclaims of mainstream climate science, as part of a strident\ndefense of the status quo. This critique is reflected in the\ntitles of numerous accounts of the activities of climate\nchange sceptics and their political and financial backers\nPooley, 2010). A \"softer\" interpretation of the phenome-\nnon is that the worldviews are acting indirectly, as back-\nground dispositions that are reinforced by various cognitive\nand psycho-sociological mechanisms noted previously\net al., 2011). In this \"softer\" interpretation, the cognitive-\npsychological drivers amount to dispositional influences\non individual behavior, somewhat like \"invisible hands\"\nInterestingly, the \"hard\" interpretation is most frequently\napplied to \"elite\" sceptics, whose leaders are often accused\nof cynical bad faith, whereas the \"softer\" or indirect inter-\npretation is reserved for \"lay\" sceptics, who are seen as\nmore na\u00efve and less capable of negotiating the complexi-\nties of climate change knowledge. It is to this dichotomy\nthat we will turn next.\nElite/Lay Distinctions\nSurvey research has demonstrated some commonalities\namong lay sceptics in terms of their cultural and value\nthe United States (Borick & Rabe, 2010; Dunlap, Xiao, &\nthe United Kingdom (Poortinga et al., 2011; Whitmarsh,\n2011) showed strong associations between several clus-\nters of ideas: conservatism, support for the free market,\nanthropocentricism, low concern about climate change,\nhigh scepticism about climate science, and opposition to\nclimate change mitigation policies. Surveys that focus on\npolitical party identification established the same pattern.\nAn Australian survey showed that, even under circum-\nstances of wide public concern about the climate during\n2007, political party identifications were strongly corre-\nlated with climate change beliefs. Labor and Green sup-\nporters were almost 3 times as likely as conservative party\nsupporters to believe that global warming would pose a\nserious threat in their own lifetime (Tranter, 2011, p. 89).\nSurveys in later years reaffirmed the partisan divide on the\nAustralian public opinion on the climate issue (Reser,\nBradley, Glendon, Ellul, & Callaghan, 2012) found that\nindicated concerns about climate change, whereas only\nhalf the conservative supporters felt the same.\nThe links between climate scepticism and political con-\nservatism are also evident at the level of political elites.\nFor example, conservative think tanks in the United States\nhave produced most of the \"environmental sceptical\" com-\nmentaries (Jacques, Dunlap, & Freeman, 2008; Union of\nConcerned Scientists, 2016), and have strongly influenced\nthe content of the printed media (Dunlap, 2009). A similar\ntrend was found in Australia, where conservative front\ngroups and think tanks have played leading roles in the\nclimate-sceptic campaigns (Hodder, 2010; McKewon,\n2012), buttressed by the role of the conservative Murdoch\nmedia outlets in promoting climate-sceptic positions\nparties in the United States and Australia have also been\nmore sceptical of the climate risks than their center-left\nand progressive counterparts (Dunlap & McCright, 2008;\nFielding, Head, Laffan, Western, & Hoegh-Guldberg,\n\"political ideology (left\u00adright) emerged as the most impor-\ntant predictor of politicians' climate change beliefs.\" They\nfound that\npoliticians from more left-leaning or politically progressive\nparties (Greens, Labor) had beliefs that more closely endorse\nscientists'beliefs about the causes and impacts of climate change\nand gave greater priority to climate change in their political\nwork. In contrast, conservative politicians were more uncertain\nand more sceptical about climate change and gave lower priority\nTranter (2013) found the same pattern: strong majorities\nof Green and Labor politicians believed (in a 2010 poll) that\n\"global warming will pose a serious threat to your way of life\nin your lifetime,\" in contrast to only a third of conservative\n4 SAGE Open\npoliticians (pp. 405-406). Interestingly, both Fielding et al.\nmate issues the politicians were even more polarized along\nideological lines than the voting public.\nThe similarity of correlations between personal biases\nand climate opinions at lay and elite levels, however, can\nobscure important differences in how scepticism is main-\ntained at these two levels. It is reasonable to suspect that\nlaypersons are more passive in both forming and maintain-\ning their climate views, by comparison with elite actors\nwho would be more active in assessing information and\nreviewing and revising their opinions. Marshall (2009)\npointed out that \"having neither the time nor skills to\nweigh up each piece of evidence\" the lay person \"fall(s)\nback on decision-making shortcuts formed by our educa-\ntion, politics and class.\"\nElites or intellectuals who actively tackle these issues in\nsome depth might be assumed to engage in careful analysis\nand assessment, rather than simply produce ideological\nconclusions. We argue that many (though not all) sceptics\ncould be expected to consider their arguments carefully, to\nbe self-aware about their own biases, and argue within\n\"normal\" levels of intellectual integrity (Van Rensburg &\nHead, 2017). Sceptics often claim that their queries and\ncounterarguments are scientifically grounded, and that that\nthey could change their positions if more conclusive evi-\ndence, in their estimation, emerged that could dispel their\ndoubts and concerns.\nAs a background to analyzing one selection of texts in\nsome depth, we first describe the political context of the\nperiod in which the views were expressed.\nTime Period\nAustralia has been a hotbed of debate over climate change\npolicy and climate scepticism for a long time. Contestation\nover the climate issue reached a peak during the period of a\nduced a new carbon-pricing scheme (Department of the\nEnvironment, 2011) as a result of policy negotiations to\nsecure the formation of a minority government after the 2010\nelection (Crowley, 2013). Labor gained the support of the\nGreens for the introduction of carbon pricing, despite sub-\nstantial business opposition (Christoff, 2013). Public opinion\nbon pricing and lower levels of public concern about the\nconservative opposition, the Liberal-National coalition, was\ndetermined to \"scrap the carbon tax.\" In September 2013, the\nconservatives won the election and they abolished the car-\nIn the following year, the climate issue subsided as an\nelectoral and legislative issue. It did resurface at intervals\nin the context of two prominent international events--the\nmunique included reference to climate policy, and the\nrelatively successful Conference of the Parties (COP) to\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange (UNFCCC) held in Paris in November\u00adDecember,\nDecember 2015 in Australia represented a much less\nheated period in terms of climate policy debates. In other\nwords, it was not complicated by election politics or leg-\nislative posturing. Politicians themselves made few forays\ninto the issue, leaving public commentary largely to indi-\nviduals (sceptics and nonsceptics) who had an enduring\ninterest in the issue.\nThe issue remained important, despite it subsiding in pub-\nlic prominence. A major survey on the climate change opin-\nions among Australians found that a substantial proportion of\nthe Australian public (38.6%) did not believe humans were\nresponsible for observed climate changes. A small group\n(7.9%) denied that the climate is changing at all. Combined,\nthese two groups of climate change sceptics outnumbered\nthe people who believe both that the climate is changing and\nthat humans are largely responsible (Leviston, Greenhill, &\nSample Composition and Text Analysis\nSole-authored opinion pieces by Andrew Bolt--a prolific\nand well-known Australian climate change sceptic, journal-\nist, newspaper columnist, radio commentator, blogger, and\ntelevision host--were collected from the Factiva Database\nof 17 unique articles were found in which the words \"climate\nchange\" or \"global warming\" occurred either in the title or in\nthe lead paragraph. The list of these 17 items is provided in\nthe appendix. Bolt is regarded as a significant opinion leader\nfor the lay sceptics in Australia. His work mobilizes a range\nof claims linked to science, political ideology, economic\ngrowth, and global competition.\nThe data set was subjected to a computerized text analysis\nto highlight the most significant words and concepts. The\nproprietary text processing software Leximancer was used\nfor this purpose. Leximancer exploits the quantifiable char-\nacteristics of a text corpus.

Proximity on the map indicates that\nconcepts appear in similar textual contexts, and vice versa.\nWhen concepts appear in polarized positions, it is indicative\nVan Rensburg and Head 5\nof weak relationships and mutually exclusive contexts,\nwhich usually occurs when the author offers multiple dis-\ntinct, relatively freestanding arguments. The concepts in the\ncenter of the map are well connected to most other concepts\nand are either important grammatical terms (which can be set\naside), or point to themes that are important to all (or most)\nof the distinct arguments in the text.\nFindings\nFigure 1 shows the concept map of the text sample after\nbeing processed by the Leximancer software. The central\narea of the concept map is encircled by the dotted oval. These\nconcepts are well connected to most other concepts on the\nmap, hence their central location. Some concepts in this area\nsimply reflect the topic of the text as predetermined by the\nsearch strategy. The terms \"Australia,\" \"emissions,\" and\n\"carbon\" would naturally be prominent and central to the\nviews of an Australian about climate change or global warm-\ning. Some other concepts in the central area serve generic\ngrammatical purposes, such as \"told,\" \"don't,\" \"leader,\"\n\"week,\" and \"year,\" and would have low value for under-\nstanding argumentative themes.\nRemaining in the central area, then, are six concepts (two\ngroups) that potentially add meaning to the general argumen-\ntative thrust of the text sample.

In other words, it is used in mul-\ntiple argumentative contexts and can be considered a recur-\nring theme in the text. It is used to indicate that a mind-set\nprevails in important government, scientific, and public sec-\ntors that climate change is something to be feared. Sceptics\nperceive this mind-set as a distortive influence on the public\nand that there is a need for a more \"realistic\" picture of the\nphenomenon. Sceptics are also convinced that some individ-\nuals and institutions exploit this mind-set to artificially main-\ntain momentum behind the call for urgent and comprehensive\nclimate change action.\nSceptics' perception of climate change as a massive unwar-\nranted \"scare\" is primarily underpinned by arguments repre-\nsented in the \"fact,\" \"tell,\" and \"truth\" concepts.These concepts\nare all related to the notion that the mainstream position lacks\nrigor in one respect or the other. The \"fact\" concept links to\nperceived inconsistencies in the scientific evidence (e.g., the\nclaimed hiatus in land surface and warming), the logic of cli-\nmate change measures (e.g., Australian emission cuts would\nrepresent only a miniscule proportion of what is needed glob-\nally to contain climate change), and the logic in supportive\narguments (e.g., containing climate change will not resolve or\nprevent indirectly related problems such as human conflicts\nover increasingly scarce natural resources). The \"tell\" concept\nequally links to a perceived lack of rigor in the mainstream\nposition. Here the sceptical perception is that mainstream expo-\nnents regularly withhold important contextual information\n(e.g., not disclosing the full costs of emission cuts), and that\nthey do not openly acknowledge uncertainties or contradictory\nscientific evidence. The \"truth\" concept also conveys the scep-\ntic notion that mainstream exponents present an incomplete\npicture of the scientific evidence (e.g., that some coral islands\nmight in fact be growing instead of shrinking).\nThe concept \"greens\" adds two quite different argumenta-\ntive themes. First, it contains the notion that those supporting\nthe climate change \"scare\" are doing so for the motive of\nleading the world to a radically alternative socioeconomic\norder. Sceptics suspect such an ideological agenda on the\npart of the far left (who they see as antagonistic to the polit-\nico-economic status quo and as seeking ambitious social and\neconomic transformation), and that center-left parties such as\nthe Labor Party are complicit, albeit somewhat na\u00efvely, in\nthis agenda. A second theme emanating from the \"greens\"\nconcept is a perception that the political left is willing to sup-\nport disproportional sacrifices and costs on their own host\ncountry (Australia in this case) to combat climate change\n(e.g., that Australia should not only abandon the coal indus-\ntry but also forego the benefits of fracking, nuclear power, or\nnew hydro-electric dams, while other nations such as the\nUnited States and China maintain a wide range of options).\nThe \"stop\" concept is related to the concepts in Concept\nGroup 1, which argue that the portrayal of climate science is\n8 SAGE Open\nnot entirely truthful or realistic. The sceptic argument here is\nthat the mitigation measures endorsed by mainstream cli-\nmate science would not \"stop\" the global warming that sci-\nentists so alarmingly predict. More realistically, the sceptic\nargument continues, efforts to \"stop\" climate change consti-\ntute a futile exercise against an unproven risk.\nThe concepts in Concept Group 1 (\"fact,\" \"tell,\" and\n\"truth\") overwhelmingly construct the sceptic notion that the\nmainstream climate position lacks rigor and is overblown, in\ncomparison with the concepts in Concept Group 2 (\"greens\"\nand \"stop\"). The \"green\" concept is the only concept that\nintroduces new argumentative lines (i.e., Bolt's specter of\nworld government and the claim that Greens and the left\nundermine local economic well-being).\nThus, the sceptical position as revealed in the text samples\ninvestigated here shows that sceptics emphasize a perceived\nlack of rigor in the mainstream position in relation to the\nscientific evidence behind climate change, as well as the\nlogic and outcomes of climate mitigation measures. The\nmain argumentative lines are built around perceived con-\nflicts in the evidence and partial or exaggerated presentation\nof the \"facts.\" These sceptic text samples seem to center their\ncriticism on the substance of mainstream exponents' claims,\nwith criticism of the motivations of left wing players as an\ninteresting but secondary source of concern for sceptics.\nThis is a significant finding for those concerned with\ncommunicating the mainstream view and those policy prac-\ntitioners who need to devise climate measures that would\nenjoy public support. It means that climate sceptical beliefs\nare potentially vulnerable to convincing arguments built\naround the scientific evidence and the need and benefits of\nmitigation measures. More importantly, it shows that climate\nsceptical criticisms are often built around a small number of\nexamples of perceived inconsistences and exaggerations. It\nwould not be necessary to \"convince\" sceptics of every\naspect of the science and every aspect of the case for early\nand effective climate intervention. The sceptical position can\nbe met by persistently responding to a relatively small num-\nber of specific criticisms (Van Rensburg & Head, 2017).\nUnderstanding the political and sociopsychological driv-\ners of scepticism can be helpful in devising sophisticated\ncommunication strategies that might appeal to sceptical\naudiences. However, the sceptic discourse as outlined here,\ndemonstrates that it is equally important to engage sceptics'\nsubstantive criticisms and concerns. Sceptics rely on per-\nceived inconsistencies and improbabilities in the evidentiary\nclaims of mainstream opponents to justify their continued\ncriticisms. From a sceptical point of view, the mainstream\nposition will continue to lack credibility as long as these per-\nceived inconsistencies and improbabilities have not been\ntackled head-on by mainstream protagonists. In fact, sceptics\ninterpret the lack of attention to their concerns as proof of\nwhat they perceive as scientific fiefdoms, closed circuit\nthinking, and professional and political manipulation of the\nclimate issue.\nConclusion\nWe argue that examining the specific objections of sceptics is\nimportant for devising more effective responses. We argue\nthat climate communicators and practitioners should con-\nstructively, patiently, and persistently respond to sceptical\ncriticisms, instead of trying to starve sceptics of public expo-\nsure by refusing to engage them. Ranalli (2012) cautioned\nagainst probing the underlying intentions of sceptics, sug-\ngesting that a more open-minded approach might open up\n\"opportunities for improved understanding\" (p. 202). The\nargument for greater openness and public debate rests on a\npositive conception of the public (including the sceptic ele-\nments) as relatively intelligent and scientifically capable\nwith sceptics over disengagement. This aligns with scholarly\nwork indicating the importance of \"social robustness\" in sci-\nIn practical terms, we recommend climate communicators\nand policy practitioners adopt five axioms for dealing with\nthe sceptic challenge:\nAccept Debate\nMainstream exponents of climate science and policy should\nuse every opportunity to convincingly put their case. It is a\nfallacy to believe that the sceptic challenge could be neutral-\nized by denying it public attention. Given the complexity,\nuncertainties, and vast array of climate-related scientific fields,\nsceptics have many stories about anomalous or contradictory\nevidence. Only by consistently winning the evidence-informed\ndebate can the science experts ensure the public is turned away\nfrom cynical scepticism. Mainstream climate exponents can\navoid much suspicion and derision from sceptic quarters, if\nthey are willing to engage with the sceptic arguments.\nAnticipate and Preempt Debate\nClimate science and policy communications tend to empha-\nsize the affirmative case. This may assist the sceptics in their\nclaim that key uncertainties are underplayed. If climate com-\nmunications included responses to anticipated critiques (such\nas constructing answers to Frequently Asked Questions), it\nwould create a stronger impression of even-handedness. It\nwould also help communicators to prepare themselves for\nthe inevitable challenges and debates.\nAcknowledge the Uncertainties in the Science and\nthe Risks in the Policies\nTransparency is an essential quality of good science. The uncer-\ntainties in climate science occur in the context of strong agree-\nment about the core trends, causality, and impacts. Avoiding\npublic engagement with sceptics has allowed them to elevate\nsome scientific uncertainties to undeserved prominence, and\nVan Rensburg and Head 9\nmaintain that the science is not settled. Similarly, in regard to\npolicy tools such as carbon pricing, communicators need not be\noverly defensive about such measures, as the case for carbon\npricing is strong. By acknowledging potential risks from poor\ndesign, communicators have the opportunity to explain how\nthose risks can be managed.\nCorrect Any Overstatements\nClimate science typically presents its assessments in terms of\nprobabilities. When the worst scenarios are dramatically\nhighlighted, sceptics can claim this represents premature\nscare-mongering. Science communicators should carefully\nqualify their claims, and demonstrate how policy measures\nare proportionate to the challenges faced. In rare cases where\nmainstream exponents misrepresent the scientific evidence,\ncommunicators should enhance the legitimacy of science by\npublicly correcting misrepresentations.\nMaintain a Respectful Tone\nComplaints by both sides about the acrimonious tone of\nsome exchanges need to be taken seriously. The label \"cli-\nmate denier,\" to name just one example, evokes deep resent-\nment among sceptics and merely distracts the debate from\nthe science issues. It is the derogatory opposite of \"climate\nalarmist.\" Sceptics range from the entrenched ideologists to\nthe seriously uncertain. It is the last group who would be\nmost responsive to patient and respectful engagement.\nAppendix\nwere analyzed in this article.

The terms \"scepticism\" and \"sceptics\" are widely used to\ndenote those unconvinced about the core claims of the main-\nstream climate science thesis, namely, that human activities\nhave significantly affected the global climate owing to higher\nlevels of atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs), leading to\nsuch impacts as sea level rise, higher temperatures, severe\nweather events, ocean acidification, and so on. This form\nof scepticism is different from the general norms and prac-\ntices of scientific scepticism--that is scholars undertaking\nclose scrutiny and critical review of each other's research\n(Van Rensburg, 2015). The label climate change \"sceptic\"\nis widely used in media discourse and academic analysis,\nand several prominent writers happily describe themselves\nas climate change \"sceptics\" (Painter, 2013; Painter & Ashe,\n2012).
