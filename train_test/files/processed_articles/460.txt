    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nBackground: Severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) might be associated with an accelerated\nage\u00adrelated decline of lung function.\nInformation on personal history was completed, and lung function testing and skin prick testing\nwere performed. Longitudinal data were compared intra-individually and with matched controls\nfrom the NHANES III dataset.\nResults: The ratio of residual volume/total lung capacity (RV/TLC) increased markedly from\nforced vital capacity (FVC) which decreased more rapidly than expected. Flow values were at the\nlower limit of normal range but remained relatively stable over time. Some individuals had\ncompletely normal lung function results.\nConclusion: Increasing static pulmonary hyperinflation with age is indicative of bronchiolar\ndysfunction or early emphysematous changes in survivors of severe BPD. Susceptibility for\nlong-term sequelae shows significant variability.\nharmful effects of barotrauma and oxygen\ntoxicity in prematurely born children,\ncausing an acquired lung disease called\nbronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) that was\ncharacterised by patchy bronchoalveolar\nscarring, atelectases and overexpansion.\nWith the introduction of lung protective\nventilation and the advent of surfactant,\nthe features of BPD have changed.2 Residual\nlung function abnormalities, mainly airflow\nobstruction and hyperinflation,3 were found\nin young adults, and emphysematous\nchanges found by CT raised the question\nwhether BPD might ultimately affect\npulmonary ageing, for example, by leading to\nthe development of chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease.4 5\nA unique cohort of 20 survivors of severe\nBPD born before the advent of lung protec-\ntive ventilation and surfactant has been\nobserved longitudinally into adulthood.\nNeonatal pulmonary management had\nincluded pressure-controlled mechanical\nventilation with peak inspiratory pressures\nO adjusted to repeated blood\ngas analyses; FiO2\n1.0 and 1 to 2 hourly suctioning and at least\n48-hourly changing of the endotracheal\ntubes. The individuals had undergone\npulmonary function testing at 1564 years\nthem could be contacted for follow-up at\nto participate. Subjects underwent skin\nprick testing to prevalent aeroallergens and\npulmonary function testing. Each individual\nwas matched for age, sex and height with\none to four individuals from the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey\nfollow-up (courtesy of Dr J.L. Hankinson,\nValdosta, GA, USA). Further details are\noutlined in the online supplement.\nThe perinatal characteristics were birth-\nO,\nendotracheal intubation for 38 (range\n4e96) days. Five individuals had been\ntracheotomised for an extended period. The\nfirst sequential lung function study in 1983\nand 1987 had revealed mean flow parameters\naround the lower limit of normal, but no\nsignificant changes over time.\nSix individuals reported a variety of\npersisting respiratory symptoms, mainly\nasthma, cough or shortness of breath during\nexercise. Four individuals with hay fever\nwere sensitised to pollens; an additional\nperson was sensitised to cat allergens\nwithout symptoms. Two individuals were\non occasional inhaled corticosteroids. There\nwere four current smokers (8e16 pack-years)\nand one former smoker. Six individuals had\nshown bronchial hyperreactivity to meth-\nacholine in 1987, two of whom still reacted\nIC\nIC\n%)\nERV\nERV\nRV\nT\nRV\nFigure 1 Stacked bar plots of static volumes in\nIC, inspiratory capacity; RV, residual volume; TLC,\ntotal lung capacity.

Smoking and other potential\nconfounders had no significant effect; lowest\nflow values were found among non-smokers.\nThe results are consistent with a progres-\nsive static hyperinflation into mid-adulthood,\nsuggestive of progressive bronchiolar dysfunc-\ntion or early emphysematous changes with\nageing in severe BPD. The relatively minor\nflow changes during the 20-year period indi-\ncate dysfunction of small airways and are\ndissimilar to chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisease, hinting to differing disease mecha-\nnisms. The current study is in line with the\nconcept of adult lung disease originating early\nin life. Susceptibility for long-term sequelae\nshows significant variability.\nAcknowledgements We are indebted to Christian\nSchindler, Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute,\nBasel, for his invaluable help with the statistical\nanalyses.
