At the same time, the field is less clear on the\ninterplay between fundamental and proximal causes--\nspecifically, how the risks generated at each level (social\nand physiological) are related to one other. The current\nwork draws from recent scientific work on the link between\nbody mass and inflammation, investigating competing models\nof risk accumulation in the interaction of (fundamental)\nsocial and (proximate) physiological risk factors among\nolder adults.\nLow socioeconomic status (SES) and high body mass in-\ndex (BMI) each pose risks for health and mortality. These\nrisk factors correspond to fundamental and proximal causes,\nrespectively. BMI and SES are negatively associated in\nmost developed societies (2), and each risk exerts an inde-\npendent effect on health net of the other (3). When consid-\nered jointly, however, the results are less consistent (4,5).\nThe purpose of this study is to advance an understanding of\nthe relationships between low SES, BMI, and C-reactive\nprotein (CRP).\nCRP is a nonspecific marker of inflammation that has\nbeen identified as a key biomeasure for cardiovascular dis-\nease risk for both men and women (6\u00ad8). Heightened CRP\nlevels are also associated with obesity and contribute to the\nconcern about why obesity is a danger for the development\nof metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (9,10).\nCRP levels of less than 1, 1\u00ad3, and more than 3 mg/l are\nconsidered clinical cut-offs for low, medium, and high level,\nrespectively, for cardiovascular risk (11).\nA growing body of evidence also demonstrates that CRP\nlevels exist along a sharp socioeconomic gradient, with dis-\nadvantaged groups at a marked risk for elevated levels of\nboth inflammation and cardiovascular disease (3,12,13).\nStudies examining the mechanisms underlying the SES\u00ad\nCRP relationship typically find that one-half to two-thirds\nof the association is attributable to lifestyle factors such as\nAt this point, however, a major limitation is that research-\ners have focused on additive models of BMI and SES for\nexamining CRP levels.

Low socioeconomic status and high levels of body mass are two risk factors for elevated C-reactive\nprotein, a biomeasure signifying inflammation. Though past research identifies the additive effect of these particular risk\nfactors, this study examines their interactive effects to uncover whether body mass index exacerbates or levels the detri-\nmental consequences of occupying a disadvantaged social position.\nMethods. This study employs a representative survey of American adults, aged 57\u00ad84 years, using self-reported and\nlaboratory measures. Additive and multiplicative linear regression models are used to analyze logged C-reactive protein-\nlevels (mg/l) drawn from assayed blood samples.\nResults. Significant negative interactions were observed between body mass index and two indicators of low socioeco-\nnomic status on C-reactive protein, reflecting a cross-over effect.\nConclusions. The results demonstrated the importance of a multiplicative model for studying risk factor accumula-\ntion and identify low socioeconomic status as an early and primary risk factor for elevated C-reactive protein.\nKey Words: CRP--besity--SES--Risk factor accumulation--SES gradient.\nDecision Editor: Luigi Ferrucci, MD, PhD\none to observe whether SES moderates BMI's more proxi-\nmal association with CRP, can illuminate the fundamental\ncause thesis and inform targeted efforts to reduce cardiovas-\ncular disease in the population.\nOne hypothesis is that people who are low in SES are\nmore vulnerable to the consequences of health-damaging\nlifestyle choices or endogenous biological risk factors than\nare advantaged people. This model is referred to as ampli-\nfied risk accumulation. With compensatory mechanisms in\nplace (e.g., more sophisticated medical acumen), people\nhigh in SES could offset some of the damage caused by\nknown cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., high body mass).\nThose already confronted with the varied risks associated\nwith low social standing would see their risks amplify, reap-\ning additional disadvantage with each accruing proximal\nrisk (e.g., high BMI). Research reporting positive interac-\ntions between SES and smoking status for morbidity risk\n(15) and positive interactions between SES and physical in-\nactivity for mortality risk (16) support this model.\nAn alternative specification, likewise based on a multipli-\ncative model, identifies that high SES groups would have\nthe most to lose from unhealthy lifestyles or endogenous\nbiological risks (e.g., high BMI). This model is premised\nupon a hierarchy of risks and recognizes that high SES\ngroups benefit from a host of other advantages such as safer\nwork, lower stress, superior medical care, and better living\nenvironments. Conversely, each risk will pose less potential\nthreat to health among low SES groups because they have\nless to lose after accounting for the toll associated with\nother risk factors (17). In this scenario, high SES levels the\nimpact of BMI on health.\nPrevious research on health risk factors shows limited\nsupport for this thesis, consisting mostly of studies using\naggregated neighborhood-level data (18) or analyses with-\nout tests of statistical significance (17). Surprisingly few\nstudies, however, investigate such interactive effects be-\ntween fundamental social causes and proximal physiologi-\ncal or behavioral causes.\nMethods\nSample\nThis study uses the National Social Life, Health, and\nAging Project (NSHAP), a nationally representative,\nages 57\u00ad85 in the United States. The NSHAP employs a\nmultistage area-probability design. In order to ensure\nadequate representation of particular demographic groups,\nrespondents were oversampled by race, age, and gender. To\naccount for these sampling strategies, all regression analyses\nare weighted and adjusted for the complex survey design in\nThe NSHAP data are advantageous because in addition\nto a full battery of questions regarding health and social be-\nhavior, the study included biological measures associated\nwith chronic disease risk such as CRP. The high response\nrate (75.5%) is a further desirable feature of the study. Fur-\nther details about the NSHAP study can be found in\nO'Muircheartaigh and colleagues (19)\nCRP\nAn 83% random subset of the NSHAP sample was as-\nsigned to have capillary blood collection, which resulted in\n1940 valid CRP records. Capillary blood was collected on\nfilter paper from a single finger stick and dried (20). After\nbeing mailed from the collection site to the laboratory, sam-\nples were stored at -25\u00b0C and assayed for CRP using en-\nzyme-linked immonosorbance (21). Values of CRP were\nrecorded in milligrams per liter and logged for regression\nanalysis. Because CRP levels of 10 mg/l and above are in-\ndicative of acute infections or injurious stimuli, we removed\nDue to the nonnormal, skewed distribution of CRP levels,\nvalues were log transformed for use in regression analysis.\nBMI\nA number of body measurements were taken during the\nbiomeasure component of the NSHAP interview. Staff took\nheight and weight measurement of respondents. BMI was\ncalculated with the standard formula (kg/m2). In prelimi-\nnary analyses, waist \u00d7 height ratio was used as an alternate\nmeasure of body composition but deleted it from the final\nanalyses for two reasons: the correlation between BMI and\nwaist \u00d7 height ratio was extremely high (r = .88) in this\nsample of older adults, and the relationships with CRP were\nnearly identical for BMI and waist \u00d7 height ratio.\nSES Indicators\nCommonly used indicators of SES include education, oc-\ncupational prestige, and income levels. For this sample of\nwas differentiated by whether or not the respondent gradu-\nated from high school (1 = high school degree, 0 = no high\nschool degree). With many persons currently retired and\nwithout a typical income, a measure of net worth was used\nto tap respondents' accumulated wealth. Prior research indi-\ncates that net worth or wealth is a preferable measure to in-\ncome among older populations (23). Participants were asked\nto estimate their net worth, considering all of their invest-\nments, properties, and other financial assets minus their\ndebt. Respondents who were unsure of their net worth were\ngiven a series of follow-up questions to narrow the estimated\nrange (e.g., \"would you say that all of your assets combined\namount to more or less than $50,000?\"). For cases asked\nthese follow-up yes or no questions, respondents were as-\nsigned the midpoint value between relevant categories (e.g.,\nEven with these less-specific retrieval questions, 135 cases\nrefused or were unable to answer the net worth question and\nwere dropped from final analyses. In sensitivity tests, analy-\nses of the full sample without dropping missing-net worth\ncases yielded parallel substantive findings to those presented\nherein. A dummy variable was created to differentiate re-\nspondents in the lowest 20% of household net worth from\nthose in the top 80%. Further cut-offs were also used in sen-\nsitivity analyses; results presented herein used the lowest\n20% because of the precedent for using quintiles to examine\nsocioeconomic health disparities (24).\nHealth Lifestyles\nFor health lifestyle variables associated with SES, we use\nself-reports of several health behaviors. Participants who\nreported currently smoking cigarettes or using pipes, cigars,\nchewing tobacco, or snuff were classified as current tobacco\nusers. Respondents who indicated that they formerly\nsmoked but no longer do so were considered past smokers.\nParticipants were asked about their engagement in physical\nactivities such as walking, dancing, or exercise and received\na score from 0 to 4 (0 = never engages in physical activity,\n1 = once a month, 2 = one to three times a month, 3 = one\nto two times a week, 4 = three or more times per week).\nFinally, respondents were coded according to their average\nlevel of alcohol consumption on days they drank: zero to\ntwo, three to five, or more than six drinks per day.\nAdditional Covariates\nIn addition to the chief independent variables, additional\ncontrols were included for a set of risk factors for inflamma-\ntion used in previous studies and available in the NSHAP\ndata set (3,12,25). First are a series of demographic covari-\nates. Age is coded in years, and sex is dichotomized. Race\nor ethnicity is divided into a series of dummy variables\n(White, Black, non-Black Hispanic, other race), with non-\nHispanic White as the excluded reference group. Clinically\nrelevant health factors include dummy variables for whether\nthe respondent was ever told by a physician that he or she\nhad one of the following conditions: heart problem, arthri-\ntis, emphysema or chronic obstructive lung disease, asthma,\nor diabetes. Respondents were also asked to rate their\nhealth, with categories ranging from poor (1) to excellent\n(5). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center for\nEpidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, an 11-item index\nconcerning feelings the respondent experienced in the past\nTable 1.

Hours slept per night were assessed\nwith a simple self-report of sleep on a typical night. During\nthe biomeasure collection portion of the NSHAP interview,\nall respondents received two blood pressure readings. Aver-\nage systolic and diastolic measurements were taken and in-\ncluded as control variables. Finally, three dichotomous\ncovariates were included for medications that may affect\ninflammation levels. Respondents were asked whether they\nwere regularly taking a list of prescription and nonprescrip-\ntion medications, among which included lipid medications,\nantihypertensive medications, or nonsteroidal antiinflam-\nmatory drugs.\nData Analysis\nAnalyses used ordinary least-squares regression to model\nthe natural log of CRP. In addition to an additive model with\nthe independent variables for SES and BMI, a series of in-\nteraction models were estimated that multiply each indica-\ntorofSESbyBMI.Graphsarepresentedtoaidinterpretation.\nResults\nTable 1 displays the coding and descriptive statistics for\neach variable stratified by education and by household net\nworth. It is clear from Table 1 that CRP levels are higher\namong people of low educational status and with low house-\nhold net worth, about 0.7 units higher for persons of lower\nstatus. BMI is also higher among the disadvantaged groups,\nas are several health-related behaviors such as current to-\nbacco use (low net worth group has higher levels), physical\nactivity, and heavy drinking behavior. Racial and ethnic mi-\nnorities are disproportionately represented in the low edu-\ncation and low net-worth group, as are those who have\nhealth troubles such as heart problems and diabetes, though\nwere was no significant difference in arthritis, emphysema,\nchronic obstructive lung disease, or asthma prevalence be-\ntween the groups. Those low in education and net worth\nalso rate their health as lower.\nHaving identified the health disparities between SES\ngroups, the next step is a multiple regression analysis of the\neffects of SES and BMI on CRP. Adjusting for all of the\ncovariates, the ordinary least- squares regression results\nshown in Table 2 reveal that each unit of BMI was associ-\nated with a 0.06 unit (p < .001) increase in the logged value\nof CRP. The model also includes the additive effects of SES\nand health behaviors. Respondents without a high school\ndegree had CRP levels 0.23 higher than those with a high\nschool or higher degree (p < .05). The additive effect of low\nnet worth, however, was nonsignificant. Of the health-re-\nlated behaviors, each except drinking was significant at the\n.001 level and associated with an increase in inflammation.\nA number of other factors were statistically significant pre-\ndictors: CRP was higher for women, persons with a poor\nhealth rating, and those not taking a lipid medication. (In\nsupplementary analyses, we estimated the model on men\nand women separately, but the results were quite similar.)\nThe final table extends the analysis by testing a series of\ninteraction terms (i.e., each indicator of SES multiplied by\nBMI). Although only the main effects and interaction terms\nare displayed, each equation adjusts for all variables in-\ncluded in the Table 2 analysis. In each model, both interac-\ntion terms were statistically significant and negative. To\ninterpret these results, one should first observe that BMI and\neach main effect that is significant manifest a positive rela-\ntionship with CRP: high BMI and low SES are associated\nwith elevated CRP. At the same time, each significant inter-\naction reveals a negative effect: people in disadvantaged\nsocial contexts derive less penalty for BMI on levels of in-\nflammation. Stated differently, the noxious effect of the risk\nfactors remain but are leveled somewhat at the high levels of\nBMI (Table 3).\nIn order to facilitate interpretation, two figures are pre-\nsented showing the effects of BMI on CRP among the so-\ncially disadvantaged groups relative to their higher status\ncounterparts. Figure 1 shows the relationship between CRP\nTable 2.

At the\nlower end of the BMI distribution, respondents with less\neducation experienced higher predicted levels of CRP (ln)\nper unit of body mass, but this pattern changed across\nBMI's range, with a cross-over point at about 39. Thus,\namong respondents whose BMI is near or above Class II\nobesity threshold (BMI > 35), the CRP levels of the persons\nwith a high school degree actually exceed those without a\nhigh school degree.\nA parallel pattern is observed in Figure 2 for the interac-\ntion of household net worth and BMI, but the intersection\npoint is much lower: 30.4. This means that among persons\nwho are more than the 30 BMI threshold, higher CRP levels\nare observed among persons with higher net worth--the op-\nposite of what is observed at the lower levels of BMI.\nDiscussion\nUsing a national sample of older adults, these analyses\nshowed that both low SES and high BMI are associated\nwith heightened levels of CRP, a key biomeasure for car-\ndiovascular disease (6,8,9). Although these fundamental\nand proximal causes of disease, SES, and BMI, respec-\ntively, are each a risk for heightened CRP, the actual impact\nof each factor on CRP is best understood when considering\ntheir conjoint influence. The association between BMI and\nCRP was leveled somewhat for persons without a high\nschool education or with lower household net worth. These\nfindings support a hierarchy of risks explanation, suggest-\ning that because lower SES individuals are generally ex-\nposed to more health risks, the unique contribution of\nBMI for CRP levels is actually lower than for their more\nadvantaged counterparts. This further exemplifies the need\nfor a more complex understanding of the relationship be-\ntween biomeasures of health and SES. No biological mech-\nTable 3.

C-Reactive Protein and Body Mass Index by Net Worth (Includes\nAdjustment for All Control Variables in Table 2).\nanism is currently available to explain this cross-over; the\nexplanation most likely lies in the interaction between\nhealth, health behaviors, and SES.\nResults are consistent with the analyses of Blaxter (17) of\nadults in England, Wales, and Scotland that revealed how\nunhealthy behaviors have the greatest effect \"when the\nsocial environment is good: rather less, if it is already\nunhealthy. Unhealthy behaviour does not reinforce disad-\nvantage to the same extent as healthy behaviour increases\nadvantage\" (p. 233). This suggests that there may be dimin-\nishing returns for selected risk factors when they are consid-\nered in tandem with other risks, emphasizing a distinct\napproach to the study of how risk factors accumulate.\nOther studies, however, demonstrate amplified risk accu-\nmulation between fundamental and proximal causes, such\nas when disease risk and mortality are higher for smokers\nwith low SES (15) or when mortality risk due to physical\ninactivity is highest among poorer people (16). Whereas we\nfound evidence of a leveling effect for the combined risks\non a different outcome, we articulate two inferences. First,\nexploring a broad range of health outcomes is probably the\nonly way to identify the interactions between social and\nphysiological factors in older adult health because the\nmechanisms of risk accumulation appear to be outcome\nspecific. Indeed, Rosero-Bixby and Dow (5) found support\nfor both amplification and leveling across an array of out-\ncomes. Second, regardless of the outcome considered, the\nbulk of the extant evidence points to the utility of multipli-\ncative models for studying how SES is related to health. A\npresumption of additive effects in models of risk accumula-\ntion may be misleading. Rather, multiplicative models are\nsupported in analyses on a range of outcomes and hold great\npromise to advance our understanding of how education\nand BMI jointly influence health outcomes (27).\nAn important limitation of this study is the cross-\nsectional nature of the data. The older adults studied have\naccumulated a lifetime of health-related experiences associ-\nated with their weight and stemming from their socioeco-\nnomic position. Accordingly, relying on a single-moment\nsnapshot and treating two respondents with identical BMI\nscores the same when in fact they may have widely diver-\ngent lifetime weight trajectories is a limitation.\nA second limitation is inherent in the population-based\ndesign of this older sample. Those with the highest risk pro-\nfile for cardiovascular disease would be less likely to sur-\nvive into their 70s and 80s, thereby making this sample\npotentially biased towards older adults in relatively good\nhealth. Though selection may bias the conclusions, we un-\ncovered considerable variability in CRP and a relatively\nhigh rate of obesity within this sample.\nIn conclusion, these analyses built on prior studies of risk\naccumulation in order to examine whether BMI exacerbates\nor diminishes the health effects of more fundamental social\ncauses of disease (1). Using two indicators of SES, we\nfound evidence that BMI has its most risky association with\nCRP among those who otherwise face fewer health risks.\nThis cross-over effect is an instance where class-based\nhealth disparities are leveled--not magnified--by a known\nrisk factor. At the same time, it raises the significance for\nidentifying why CRP levels rise so dramatically among\nobese persons of high SES.\n"
