Recent, national estimates of the clinical burden of thrombocytopenia among HCV-infected\nand Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) were used to examine the prevalence of thrombocytopenia among\nHCV-infected individuals in the United States.\nResults: Among 467 HCV-infected individuals in the survey (weighted population = 3,597,039), mean weighted age\nwas 46.7 years (standard deviation = 15.5) and 61.7% were male. Overall, 7.6% met the study definition of TCP at\n1.64). In the two adjusted models, the odds by time ranged from 1.24-1.40, depending on whether the model\nincluded demographic or laboratory variables or both, but did not reach statistical significance. Age was positively\nand significantly related to thrombocytopenia status.\nConclusions: As the HCV-infected population ages, the prevalence of thrombocytopenia is expected to rise. This\nstudy provides limited evidence of such an effect at the national level.\n",

Estimates of\nthe prevalence of thrombocytopenia in liver disease vary\nwidely, depending on the population and the platelet\nthreshold used [5,6]. Among studies of chronic liver disease\npatients where thrombocytopenia was defined as a platelet\nfrom 16-45% [6]. In clinical trials of interferon-based ther-\napy, more than one third of patients experienced a\ndecrease in platelet counts, with counts falling below 50 \u00d7\nnia while on antiviral therapy may lead to dose reductions,\ninterruption, or discontinuations of interferon, potentially\njeopardizing the chances of achieving sustained virologic\nresponse (SVR). In cases of portal hypertension and severe\nthrombocytopenia, HCV patients may be unable to initiate\nantiviral treatment due to low platelets.\nAn understanding of trends in the prevalence of HCV\nand its complications facilitates public health planning and\ntreatment efforts. Although the current incidence of HCV\ninfection is low, the aging of individuals infected with\nHCV over the past several decades suggests that the bur-\nden of liver disease in the United States (US) will continue\nto increase, with a peak in cirrhosis cases in the year 2020\npreceding peaks in liver cancer in the following decade [9].\nAs that happens, the prevalence of thrombocytopenia\n* Correspondence: kauf@cop.ufl.edu\n Contributed equally\n1Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, College of Pharmacy,\nUniversity of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2012 Kauf et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

However, recent projections of HCV and liver\ndisease burden in the US have not considered the preva-\nlence of thrombocytopenia [9-12]. Similarly, available esti-\nmates of the future cost of HCV which are based on past\ntreatment patterns may not reflect adequately the addi-\ntional cost associated with an increased prevalence of\nthrombocytopenia.\nThe most recent examination of thrombocytopenia at\nthe national level was conducted using the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)\nIII [13]. In that study, 13% of individuals with positive\nnot possible to determine trends across that time period\ndue to the nature of data collection during that survey\nphase. Newer administrations of NHANES, however, do\npermit an examination of trends in the US over conse-\ncutive, two-year periods. The objective of this study was\nto document national trends over the past decade in the\nprevalence of thrombocytopenia among individuals\ninfected with HCV, with the goal of informing efforts to\nmodel the prevalence of complications associated with\nchronic HCV infection.\nResults\nAcross the 10-year study period, 467 NHANES partici-\npants were identified as having confirmed HCV infection;\nHCV frequency translates to an estimated prevalence in\nlence), including both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases of\ninfection. Weighted summary characteristics for HCV-\ninfected participants are shown in Table 1. Mean weighted\nmarizes HCV-infected individuals with and without\nthrombocytopenia (defined as platelet count below 150 \u00d7\n109/L). Compared to those with normal platelet counts,\nindividuals with low platelet tended to be older (55.3 vs\n0.05 for all comparisons). Questionnaire items tend to\nhave a large number of missing values, and a limited num-\nber of participants were eligible for certain examinations,\nsuch as fasting glucose and fasting insulin; these items\nshould be interpreted with caution.\nFigure 1 shows the 2-year point estimates and 95% con-\nfidence intervals for the prevalence of thrombocytopenia\npants with and without confirmed HCV infection. Trends\nfor lower thresholds were unstable due to very small\nsample sizes and are not shown. Among HCV-infected\nindividuals, the prevalence of thrombocytopenia at the\nstatistically significant change from other periods. Trends\nin thrombocytopenia prevalence among non-HCV-\ninfected individuals followed a similar pattern, although\nat much lower levels. The rise in thrombocytopenia\nprevalence of 8 percentage points among those with con-\nfirmed HCV infection represented a 164.0% increase but\ndid not reach statistical significance. In contrast, throm-\nbocytopenia prevalence among non-HCV-infected indivi-\nduals was relatively stable during the same time period,\nPlatelet counts among patients with HCV were signifi-\ncantly correlated with several laboratory measures (data\nnot shown but available from the authors by request).\nThose not correlated with platelets included protein, fast-\ning glucose, and fasting insulin, although the ability to\ndetect relationships to the fasting variables was hampered\nby limited data availability. ALT and AST were signifi-\ncantly correlated with bilirubin, protein, hemoglobin, iron,\nand globulin. Of these, iron, protein, and globulin were\nexcluded from further analysis because they showed parti-\ncularly strong correlations with ALT and AST.\nResults for the three time-trend regression models are\nshown in Table 2. The univariate, biannual time trend\nreach statistical significance, can be interpreted as a bi-\nyearly increase in thrombocytopenia prevalence of 16%.\nIn adjusted models, the odds by time increased to 1.24-\n1.40, depending on whether the model included demo-\ngraphic or laboratory variables or both, but failed to\nreach statistical significance. Age was positively asso-\nciated with an increase in the odds of thrombocytopenia\nin both adjusted models. None of the laboratory\nmeasures was significantly related to thrombocytopenia\nstatus, although the coefficients were of the expected\nsign. The presence of thrombocytopenia was not asso-\nciated with ALT or AST level.\nDiscussion\nThis study is the first to report trends in the prevalence\nof thrombocytopenia across a national sample of indivi-\nduals infected with HCV. For the most recent time per-\n13%. Further, the prevalence over time among the non-\nHCV-infected US population remained fairly stable.\nWhile there was a dip in thrombocytopenia prevalence\namong the weighted population of all NHANES partici-\npants suggests that the decrease could be a function of\nlaboratory processing or some other systematic change\nduring that survey round.\nTable 1 Confirmed HCV infection study sample characteristics\nCharacteristic Confirmed\nHCV-Infected\nRaw Frequency\nConfirmed HCV-Infected\nWeighted Mean (SD) or Proportion\nPatients\nThrombocytopenia\nPopulation1\nNon-Thrombocytopenia\nPopulation1\nAnnual Household income, % 433\nTimes received health care over past 12\nmonths, %\nAlcohol use (drinks/day over past year),\nmean (SD)\nmean (SD)\nHCV = hepatitis C virus; SD = standard deviation; ALT = alanine aminotransferase; AST = asparate aminotransferase\nA prior study utilizing NHANES III data for the years\namong HCV-infected individuals. In that study, however, a\nplatelet counts across all participants-was used [13]. If pla-\ntelet counts remained stable, then the prevalence estimates\nfrom the current study, at a lower threshold, should have\npositively and significantly related to thrombocytopenia\nstatus. Taken together, these two studies suggest that the\nprevalence of thrombocytopenia among individuals\ninfected with HCV likely increased-perhaps substantially-\nover the past two decades. However, the spike in thrombo-\ncytopenia prevalence among HCV-infected individuals\nyears of data will be needed to delineate a clear trend.\nSeveral previous studies have examined platelet counts\namong HCV patient populations. Louie et al (2011) per-\nformed a systematic review of those studies conducted in\npopulations of 50 or more confirmed HCV-infected\npatients. Among the 9 studies which used a platelet\nmuch higher proportions reported in these studies com-\npared to the current analysis may be explained, in part, by\nthe inclusion in the present study of individuals with\nundiagnosed HCV infection. Davis et al (2010) estimates\nthat approximately 70% of individuals infected with HCV\nare unaware of their serostatus [9]. Among the 167\nHCV infection who responded to a follow-up telephone\nsurvey, 48.9% reported that they were previously unaware\nof their serostatus. It is likely that a large proportion of\nthose patients have yet to exhibit symptoms of liver dis-\nease, and one would expect a lower prevalence of throm-\nbocytopenia among such patients.\nThe use of NHANES presents both advantages and dis-\nadvantages for the examination of thrombocytopenia\namong individuals infected with HCV. The primary advan-\ntage of NHANES lies in its sampling strategy, which allows\nfor the examination of a nationally representative popula-\ntion of individuals. Additionally, NHANES has been con-\nducted on a biennial basis since 1999, allowing for the\nexamination of disease trends over the past decade. The\npresent study examines two conditions of which patients\nmay be unaware. HCV infection may remain asympto-\nmatic for several decades, such that many individuals\ninfected with HCV are unaware of their status [9]. Simi-\nlarly, thrombocytopenia is a laboratory abnormality that\nmay not appear as a specific diagnosis in administrative\ndata and patients may or may not identify it as a (known)\nmedical condition. Claims data or self-reported surveys\nthus would be inadequate to examine the prevalence of\nthrombocytopenia within the HCV-infected population.\nNHANES does present some limitations. Since HCV is\nrelatively uncommon among the general population,\nFigure 1 Prevalence of platelet counts below 150 \u00d7 109/L among individuals with confirmed HCV infection and all NHANES\nparticipants, 1999-2008. Note: Error bars represent 95% confidence interval for the proportion of HCV patients with TCP. HCV = hepatitis C\nvirus; NHANES = National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; TCP = thrombocytopenia.\nsample sizes within each 2-year survey period are small,\nlimiting the ability to detect changes over time, particu-\nlarly for lower platelet counts which may be more rele-\nvant to clinical practice. The small sample also\ncontributes to the volatility in the estimates; a difference\nof just one or two cases could have a large impact on\nthe prevalence estimates. Further, some high-risk groups\nsuch as the homeless and incarcerated individuals are\nnot represented. Because those groups have not been\nadequately studied, it is not known whether the risk of\nthrombocytopenia with such risk groups is higher or\nlower than among the overall HCV patient population.\nFinally, NHANES is a cross-sectional survey with limited\ninformation about patients' medical histories, including\nduration of HCV infection, liver disease status, treat-\nment history, and mode of transmission. Because\nNHANES lacks this information, it is not possible to\nmodel the relationship between chronic liver disease\nand thrombocytopenia. In particular, duration of HCV\ninfection is an unobserved latent variable that may be\nexplaining part of the variation in thrombocytopenia\nrates.\nDavis et al (2010) predict that the prevalence of cirrho-\nsis will peak in 2020 [9]. Previous investigators have sug-\ngested that the future burden of liver disease is likely to\nbe reduced only through improvements in the effective-\nness of antiviral therapy and increases in the numbers of\ncould be positively affected through the use of emerging\ntreatments which may safely improve platelet counts\namong HCV-infected patients [5,16]. One study has\nshown that treatment for low platelets can improve the\nability of some patients to initiate antiviral treatment\n[17], but further study is needed to see whether the use\nof such therapies will help patients initiate, maintain, and\ncomplete antiviral treatment. Moreover, non-peginter-\nferon-based treatment strategies for chronic HCV infec-\ntion, several of which are under investigation, may enable\nmore patients to initiate and complete anti-viral therapy\nand have a higher likelihood of SVR [18].\nConclusions\nThrombocytopenia increases health costs [5,19] and may\ninterfere with the ability of some patients to initiate or tol-\nerate antiviral therapy [1,2,17]. If the burden of HCV is to\nbe reduced, the clinical impact of thrombocytopenia in\nHCV-related liver disease must be addressed. A substantial\nproportion of HCV patients have low platelet counts, and\nthe prevalence of low platelets among individuals with\nchronic liver disease is likely to increase through the com-\ning decade. Future efforts to estimate the human and eco-\nnomic consequences of HCV infection should consider\nthe role of thrombocytopenia as both a clinical manifesta-\ntion of disease and a possible barrier to treatment.\nMethods\nData and patients\nMultiple years of NHANES data were used to examine\nchanges in the prevalence of thrombocytopenia among\nTable 2 Adjusted time-trend regression results\nHCV-Confirmed Patients (n = 467)\nVariable Model 1\nRace/ethnicity (vs White)\nHCV = hepatitis C virus; OR = odds ratio; CI = confidence interval; ALT = alanine aminotransferase; AST = asparate aminotransferase\nconsists of an interview and comprehensive medical\nexamination of a nationally representative sample of\nabout 5,000 persons each year. The interview compo-\nnent includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and\nhealth-related questions. The examination component\nconsists of medical, dental, and physiological measure-\nments, as well as laboratory tests administered by highly\ntrained medical personnel. NHANES study participants\naged 6 years and older were eligible for hepatitis C anti-\nbody testing, which was repeated in duplicate for posi-\ntive samples.\nAll participants with available information on hepatitis C\ntesting and evidence of confirmed infection (positive\nChiron RIBA 3.0 Strip Immunoblot Assay) were eligible\nfor inclusion in the current study [20]. NHANES partici-\npants also received a complete blood count with differen-\ntial in whole blood, which included platelet count and\nmean platelet volume, and a standard biochemistry profile.\nIncluded in the latter were alanine aminotransferase\n(ALT) and asparate aminotransferase (AST). Self-reported\ninformation about prescription drug use during the past\n30 days and medical conditions were included in the ques-\ntionnaire portion of the survey.\nStudy measures\nThe primary measure of interest for the study was throm-\nbocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia was defined as platelet\nexamined. Laboratory and examination variables used to\nassess the likelihood of thrombocytopenia included ALT,\nAST, iron, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, albumin, creati-\nnine, bilirubin, total protein, hemoglobin, white blood cell\ncount, and weight. Questionnaire variables included alco-\nhol use, marijuana use, health care utilization over the past\n12 months, and prior diagnosis of liver cancer. Demo-\ngraphic variables included age, gender, race/ethnicity, and\nincome.\nStatistical analysis\nSummary statistics for the variables noted above were\ncalculated for all confirmed HCV-infected NHANES\nparticipants. The proportion of confirmed HCV-infected\nparticipants meeting a threshold criterion for thrombo-\ncytopenia was calculated for each 2-year survey period\nand compared using Fisher's exact test. The proportion\nof all NHANES participants with low platelets in each\nperiod was provided as a comparison.\nTrends over time were analyzed via a series of logistic\nregression models to account for non-linear relationships\nbetween variables. The dependent variable in each model\nwas a dichotomous marker of thrombocytopenia (yes/no)\nfor each subject. The initial model considered only time,\nwith each 2-year survey timeframe considered as one per-\niod. Subsequent models included time plus demographic\nvariables (Model 2) and time plus demographic variables\nplus laboratory measures (Model 3). Pearson correlation\ncoefficients between laboratory measures were calculated.\nMeasures not significantly correlated with platelet counts\nwere excluded from the regression analysis to arrive at a\nmore parsimonious model. Similarly, laboratory measures\nwhich were significantly and strongly correlated with ALT\nand AST were excluded to avoid problems with multi-\ncolinearity and improve model fit. Strong correlations\nwere defined as correlation coefficients with absolute\nvalues exceeding 0.20. Questionnaire items with low\nresponse rates were not included due to missing data.\nOdds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were reported\nfor each model.\nSummary statistics, prevalence estimates, and regres-\nsion analyses were weighted to represent the US popula-\ntion using survey weights provided by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics. All analyses were conducted\nusing SAS version 9.2, with 2-sided tests of hypothesis.\nP-values of 0.05 or lower were considered statistically\nsignificant. The study was approved by the University of\nFlorida Institutional Review Board.
