To explore an approach by which these challenges might be\nmitigated, genetic maps of extant diploid and tetraploid cottons (Gossypium spp.) were used to infer the approximate\norder of 3016 loci along the chromosomes of their hypothetical common ancestor. The inferred Gossypium gene order\ncorresponded more closely than the original maps did to a similarly inferred ancestral gene order predating an\nindependent paleopolyploidization () in Arabidopsis. At least 59% of the cotton map and 53% of the Arabidopsis\ntranscriptome showed correspondence in multilocus gene arrangements based on one or both of two software\npackages (CrimeStatII, FISH). Genomic regions in which chromosome structural rearrangement has been rapid\n(obscuring gene order correspondence) have also been subject to greater divergence of individual gene sequences.\nAbout 26%\u00ad44% of corresponding regions involved multiple Arabidopsis or cotton chromosomes, in some cases\nconsistent with known, more ancient, duplications. The genomic distributions of multiple-locus probes provided early\ninsight into the consequences for chromosome structure of an ancient large-scale duplication in cotton. Inferences\nthat mitigate the consequences of ancient duplications improve leveraging of genomic information for model\norganisms in the study of more complex genomes.\n[Supplemental material is available online at www.genome.org.]\nThe generally more-rapid evolution of gene arrangement in an-\ngiosperms (flowering plants), relative to other higher eukaryotes\nsuch as animals, appears to be at least in part due to polyploidy\nand its consequences (Bowers et al. 2003). Polyploidy may result\nfrom the merger of more than one genome from species whose\nchromosomes can pair and recombine (autopolyploidy), or from\nspecies with divergent chromosomes that normally do not pair\nor recombine (allopolyploidy). It has long been suspected, based\non differences among taxa in chromosome number and size, that\nmany angiosperm genomes may have undergone ancient poly-\nploidization (Stebbins 1966). Bearing out early hints based on\nparallel arrangements of duplicated DNA marker loci (Kowalski et\nduplication in the Arabidopsis genome (The Arabidopsis Genome\nlution into multiple events (Vision et al. 2000; Simillion et al.\nevents to near () or before () the monocot\u00addicot divergence\nsuggest that virtually all angiosperms are paleopolyploids (Bow-\nBurgeoning genomic data are revealing that not only do\nmost angiosperms share a few ancient whole-genome duplica-\ntions, but many have also undergone more recent lineage-\nspecific duplications. For example, a duplication detected in the\nthe major cereals but not by more distant monocots such as Musa\n(banana) and Allium (Paterson et al. 2004). Recent investigations\nof large numbers of ESTs suggest genomic duplications in many\nadditional lineages (Blanc and Wolfe 2004). The curious failure of\nthis EST-based approach to validate the rice duplication suggests\nthat such methods underestimate the extent of genomic dupli-\ncation, for reasons that are not yet understood.\nBetter understanding of polyploidy and its consequences are\ncentral to comparative biology. Traditional models (Ohno 1970)\nsuggest that polyploidy may free one duplicated gene copy to\nevolve new function, with the fitness of the organism buffered by\nthe second copy. However, several recent findings are at odds\nwith this model, in particular, the reduced species-wide polymor-\nphism levels associated with recently duplicated genes in Arabi-\ndopsis (Moore and Purugganan 2003) and the long period for\nwhich duplicated genes retain partially redundant functions (Gu\net al. 2003). Theoretical considerations suggest that the fates of\nduplicated genes are closely associated with effective population\nsize (Ne\n) for a taxon (Lynch and Conery 2003). Thus, insights\nfrom microbes such as yeast with large Ne\nmay not extend well to\ncrown eukaryotes with small Ne\n.\nThe high frequency of duplications (especially in compari-\nson to dioecious organisms such as most animals) and experi-\nmental facility of angiosperms, together with their much smaller\nNe\nthan yeast, make them attractive models for dissecting the\n3Corresponding author.\nArticle and publication are at http://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/\nArticle\nwww.genome.org\nCold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press\ngenome.cshlp.org\nDownloaded from\nevolutionary consequences of polyploidy in higher eukaryotes.\nThese consequences may have many dimensions--for example,\npatterns of distribution of QTLs within a nucleus, across taxa,\nMing et al. 2001), together with intricate patterns of organ-\nspecific reciprocal expression silencing (Adams et al. 2003) all\nsuggest that nonlinear interactions between duplicated genes\nand genomes may contribute novel attributes to some polyploid\ncrops.\nThe complicated genome structure that results from re-\npeated cycles of genome duplication, each followed by loss of\none member of many duplicated gene pairs (\"diploidization\"--\n[Eckardt 2001b]), adds much complexity to deciphering the evo-\nlutionary history of plants. Understanding the relative relation-\nships between taxon divergence and genome duplication is es-\nsential to making truly orthologous comparisons among\nangiosperm genomes (Kellogg 2003). Such information adds a\npowerful new tool to help resolve the fates of individual genes\nand gene family members by more definitive determination of\northology and more precise links between gene duplication and\ntaxon divergence than have been realized using molecular clock-\nbased methods.\nGossypium (cotton) is an especially appropriate system in\nwhich to explore the comparative genomics of paleopolyploids.\nWhile the cereals have often been preferred models for angio-\nsperm comparative genomics, the relative lack of knowledge of\nnon-Poaceae monocots is presently a hindrance in studying an-\ncient genomic duplications. The Malvales (including cotton) are\npresently the nearest relative to Arabidopsis outside of the Bras-\nsicales, for which a detailed genetic map has been described.\nDating of the  event to after the cotton-Arabidopsis divergence\nassures that the two lineages differ by at least this ancient dupli-\ncation event (Bowers et al. 2003). Cultivated cottons are tetra-\nploids of relatively recent (ca. 1 Mya) origin from A- and D-\ngenome diploid ancestors that may themselves have shared com-\nCronn 2003). Colinearity among these genomes has been well\ncharacterized (Rong et al. 2004). Further, the A- and D-genomes\nshare common gametic chromosome number (13) with all six\nother genome types in the genus (B, C, E, F, G, K). That several\nrelated genera have many species with n = 6 has long hinted at\nthe possibility of ancient duplication in the cotton lineage, how-\never, solid evidence of such an event or its consequences has\nbeen lacking. Finally, the cotton-Arabidopsis comparison offers\npractical benefits--research into the genetic control of the seed-\nborne epidermal fibers that account for most of cotton's eco-\nnomic importance may benefit greatly from progress in under-\nstanding the growth and development of hair-bearing epidermal\ncells (trichomes) in Arabidopsis (Larkin et al. 2003; Schiefelbein\n2003). The recent discovery that a cotton Myb could rescue an\nArabidopsis gl1 mutant, and also induce seed trichome produc-\ntion in Arabidopsis (Wang et al. 2004) is particularly exciting.\nAs a further step toward unraveling the complexities that\npolyploidy introduces into comparative genomics, we explore in\ndetail the comparative chromosome structural evolution of Gos-\nsypium and Arabidopsis. Detailed genetic linkage maps of the tet-\nraploid and D-diploid cotton genomes (Rong et al. 2004) are used\nto infer the probable arrangement of mapped genes in a hypo-\nthetical common ancestor, mitigating both the consequences of\ndiploidization and the inability of genetic mapping studies to\ndetect DNA polymorphism at all duplicated loci. Analysis of this\ninferred gene order substantially improves the degree of corre-\nspondence in gene arrangement detected between the hypotheti-\ncal ancestors of cotton and Arabidopsis. The first insights into\nstructural genomic consequences of an ancient whole-genome\nduplication in cotton are revealed. This work points the way to\nmore effective leveraging of genomic information from botanical\nmodels in the study and improvement of major crops, and im-\nproved understanding of mechanisms underlying botanical di-\nversity.\nResults\nInferring gene order along the chromosomes of the\nhypothetical ancestor of the A and D genomes of Gossypium\nTo improve our ability to identify intragenomic duplication in\ncotton, existing genetic maps (Rong et al. 2004) were supple-\nmented with 147 new DNA markers that were likely (based on\nSouthern blot data) to detect two or more duplicated loci in a\nhighly polymorphic cross between diploids G. trilobum and G.\nraimondii, adding 290 new segregating loci. This yielded a total of\n1243 loci from the At subgenome (i.e., the 13 tetraploid chromo-\nsomes derived from an A-genome diploid ancestor), 1218 loci\nfrom the Dt subgenome (the 13 tetraploid chromosomes derived\nfrom a D-genome diploid ancestor), and 1014 loci from the D\ndiploid genome (Supplemental Table 1).\nA total of 781 probes were mapped to two or more loci in\ncotton. Alignments among homoeologous At, Dt, and D chro-\nmosomes were readily established based on 333 pairs of loci ar-\nranged in extensive blocks with corresponding order and orien-\ntation. An additional 87 pairs of loci revealed blocks of corre-\nsponding order but opposite orientation (reflecting inversions).\nHomoeologous reference loci were used as a framework to inter-\npolate the probable locations of additional markers that could be\nmapped in only a subset of the homoeologs. In the vast majority\nof cases, this reflects lack of genetic polymorphism. Even in in-\nterspecific crosses, per-locus polymorphism rates in tetraploid\ncotton are modest (e.g., Rong et al. 2004), and the likelihood of\nfinding polymorphisms at each of two homoeologous loci is\nsmall.\nSeveral lines of evidence show that gene loss per se is infre-\nquent in the At and Dt genomes. First, the vast majority of cDNA\nor other low-copy probes detect multiple \"alloallelic\" restriction\nfragments in tetraploid cotton, which comigrate with fragments\nin diploid progenitors (Reinisch et al. 1994). In a survey of 40\ngene pairs based on high-resolution SSCP, 100% of the 40 genes\nstudied were represented in tetraploid cotton by two homoeolo-\ngous copies (Adams et al. 2003), suggesting a rate of gene loss that\nis no more than 2.5%. Lack of rearrangement following poly-\nploid synthesis in cotton (Liu et al. 2001) and identical gene\ncomposition along corresponding At and Dt cotton BACs\n(Grover et al. 2004) support this view. While we cannot preclude\nthe possibility of occasional gene loss, all available evidence\npoints to it playing a minor role in the inability to map homoe-\nologs in tetraploid cotton.\nIn the absence of appreciable gene loss, the same principles\nthat apply to the inference of nonpolymorphic sites across the\nAt, Dt, and D genomes are appropriate for inference of approxi-\nmate gene arrangement along the chromosomes of their hypo-\nthetical common ancestor. To infer the probable gene order\nalong the chromosomes of a hypothetical common ancestor of\nthe At, Dt, and D genomes, the Dt genome was used as the pri-\nComparative genomics of cotton and Arabidopsis\nwww.genome.org\nCold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press\ngenome.cshlp.org\nDownloaded from\nmary map into which the other maps were merged. We chose Dt\nas the reference map because (1) it is virtually collinear with the\nD diploid map, in contrast to extensive rearrangement of the At\ngenome relative to its A ancestor (Brubaker et al. 1999), and (2)\nbecause the Dt map had 20% more markers than the D diploid\nmap so less inference is necessary. All\ncommon colinear loci within the same\nhomoeologous group were used as an-\nchor loci to start the construction of\nconsensus maps by simple interpolation\nbased on the relative spacings of nonan-\nchor loci between consecutive anchors.\nThe D map was merged into the Dt map\nfirst, followed by the At map, with the\nexception of chromosome ends (from\nthe end to the first or last common\nmarker). For regions that differed by in-\nversion, marker locations were interpo-\nlated based on the Dt order (Fig. 1A,B;\nSupplemental Fig. 1; Table 1).\nDifferences in polymorphism asso-\nciated with terminal markers may cause\nthe respective maps to have somewhat\ndifferent coverage of their respective\nchromosomes. As a best estimate of the\ncoverage of the respective maps, we con-\nsidered the centiMorgan length of the\nrespective maps from the last common\nmarker to the terminus. If the ends of\nthe At or D maps were longer than the\ncorresponding segments of the Dt map,\nthe longer segment was used as the pri-\nmary map for the affected end. The Dt\nmap was the longest for only three chro-\nmosomes (2, 4, 6), thus, the maps of the\nother 10 chromosomes are therefore\nsomewhat longer than the Dt map\n(Supplemental Fig. 1; Table 1). To deal\nwith translocations between tetraploid\n(At) Chrs. 2 and 3, and 4 and 5, the af-\nfected chromosomes were split, with the\nappropriate regions merged into differ-\nent D genome homologs (Supplemental\nTable 1). To implement the rules that we\noutline above for inferring the approxi-\nmate gene arrangement along the chro-\nmosomes of a hypothetical common an-\ncestor of the At, Dt, and D genomes, a\ncomputer program was written in PHP.\nIn partial summary, we assembled\n13 maps representing the inferred gene\norders along the chromosomes of the\nhypothetical common ancestor of the A\nand D genomes of Gossypium. Each con-\nsensus map was named according to the\nname of the diploid D genome chromo-\nsome, but with the prefix C (\"consen-\nsus\").

A framework of DNA markers that mapped to homoeologous sites (e.g., X1/X2 and Y1/Y2)\nwere used to interpolate the probable locations of additional markers (e.g., M1/M2) that could be\nmapped in only a subset of the homoeologs (for details, see Methods).

Vertical bars colored with yellow\nand green represented inverted regions on diploid D and At chromosomes, respectively, compared\nwith the inferred map. The vertical ellipses highlighted with blue represent possible locations of\ncentromeres, inferred as described elsewhere (Rong et al. 2004). Superscripted numbers in parenthe-\nses indicate centiMorgan locations that could not be shown between major gridlines on the map due\nto space, followed by markers at those locations.

Removal of 2305\nproximal duplicates from the match file left 5132 matching pairs\nthat were considered \"potential orthologs\" and used in compara-\ntive analyses.\nDistribution of Arabidopsis putative orthologs along inferred\nancestral cotton chromosomes\nThe distribution of best-matching Arabidopsis sequences on in-\nferred ancestral cotton chromosomes was not random.

Details of\ncorresponding regions are summarized in Supplemental Tables 3\nand 4 and presented in full in Supplemental Table 2.\nTo explore the consequences of duplication/diploidization\nin Arabidopsis for genomic comparisons, we compared the in-\nferred ancestral cotton map with both the modern Arabidopsis\ngenome and with inferred pre--duplication Arabidopsis gene or-\nders (Bowers et al. 2003). When CS2 was used for comparison of\n800 pairs of matching loci no longer occurred in clusters, reflect-\ning gene loss in modern Arabidopsis chromosomes following the\n event. As an example (Fig. 2), a region of 31.1 cM with 67 loci\nwas selected from C06. Among 39 cotton loci that had homologs\nin Arabidopsis, 24 showed conserved synteny with pre- duplica-\ntions, but only 17 with modern Arabidopsis. Using the inferred\nancestral Arabidopsis gene order increases the detection of con-\nserved synteny, so it was used in further studies.\nPatterns of conserved synteny between cotton and Arabidopsis\nWhile both CS2 and FISH revealed cotton-Arabidopsis correspon-\ndence between many common regions, there were also notewor-\nthy differences in reciprocal comparisons that used cotton\n(Supplemental Table 3) or Arabidopsis (Supplemental Table 4) as\nthe foundation. Based on evaluation of matching loci in their\ndistribution along the cotton chromosomes, CS2 detected corre-\nspondence over nearly twice as much of the genome as FISH,\nboth in total and along each chromosome. Most regions detected\nby CS2 were larger than, and inclusive of the regions detected by\nFISH, excepting regions determined with only two pairs of\nmatching loci (CS2 requires at least three matching pairs for sig-\nconsensus map, showed nonrandom correspondence, putatively\nsynteny, with at least one Arabidopsis -duplicated segment\nbased on CS2.

However, such\nassociations are suspect in that they accounted for a dispropor-\ntionately large share of the incongruities between inferences\nFigure 2.

Loci with \"%\" were sequenced, but no orthologs\nwere found in Arabidopsis. Loci highlighted in blue showed conserved synteny with 11 and in green\nwith 14. The remaining loci had orthologs in Arabidopsis, either showing conserved synteny with\nother duplications, or no synteny. Duplicated Arabidopsis genes contributing to assembly of inferred\ngene orders were linked with dashed lines.\nRong et al.\nwww.genome.org\nCold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press\ngenome.cshlp.org\nDownloaded from\nmade using the two packages. Overall, the lengths of correspond-\ning regions on individual chromosomes as estimated by CS2 ver-\nsus FISH were significantly correlated with one another, but only\nat a modest level (r = 0.28). There was very strong agreement\n(r = 0.51) in the portions of individual chromosomes that\nmatched only one other region of the genome. However, there\nwas virtually no relationship between the two packages\n(r = 0.017) in portions matching two other regions. Higher-order\nmatches lacked adequate data for meaningful comparison. A\none-to-one relationship was indicated for 50% and 74% of the\ncorresponding regions by CS2 and FISH, respectively. As illus-\ntrated in Figure 4, the number of corresponding regions, in par-\nticular those detected by CS2, appears to be related to marker\ndensity of the consensus map. Postulated centromeric regions\nappear to be especially high in both marker density and CS2-\ninferred correspondence among chromosomal segments. How-\never, we question whether the multiple associations among chro-\nmosomes in these regions truly represent conserved synteny--\nother work in our group (Bowers et al. 2005) has suggested that\nintercentromeric gene movement may be associated with evolu-\ntion of bivalent chromosome pairing in recently formed poly-\nploids. We speculate that such gene movement may cause CS2 to\nfalsely infer conserved syntenies. More information is needed to\ncarefully evaluate this hypothesis, in particular, the exact loca-\ntions of all cotton centromeres (which are presently approxi-\nmated). However, at present, we remain cautious of these multi-\nchromosomal associations, and suggest that the more stringent\nFISH algorithm may better represent true synteny (or lack\nthereof) in these regions.\nFurther improving the detection of conserved synteny\nbetween cotton and Arabidopsis\nThe combination of cotton segments showing paleo-\nhomoeology with one another appears likely to further improve\nthe identification of conserved synteny between cotton and Ara-\nbidopsis. Two corresponding chromosomal segments from C05\nand C09, respectively (Fig. 5), show six corresponding loci in\nments. If a consensus gene arrangement is constructed from the\ntwo segments, additional conserved syntenies are identified. For\nexample, when each cotton segment was considered separately,\nno one showed conserved synteny with 03 on Arabidopsis chro-\nmosome 1. But, when the two cotton homoeologous segments\nare merged, correspondences to two new portions of 03 are\nidentified (Fig. 5). Based on a consensus arrangement inferred\nfrom interleaving the two segments, a total of 11 additional Ara-\nbidopsis segments showed correspondence, with a maximum of\ntwo corresponding to the same cotton region. Sufficient data to\napply this approach on a genome-wide scale in cotton may\ngreatly extend the length of chromosomal segments over which\nconserved synteny can be inferred.\nDiscussion\nThe relatively close relationship of cotton and Arabidopsis, de-\ntailed genetic map for cotton, and potential importance of using\nfunctional genomic information and tools from Arabidopsis to\naid in dissecting economically important pathways in cotton\nmake this system an excellent case study for exploring compari-\nsons of gene order among divergent taxonomic families. The\na hypothetical common ancestor of the A and D Gossypium ge-\nnomes, by itself, is a valuable tool for a wide range of applica-\ntions. Due to the modest levels of DNA polymorphism among\nmodern (AD) polyploid cottons, we can genetically map both\nmembers of a homoeologous gene set in only about 20% of cases,\neven using interspecific crosses. The inferred map predicts the\nlocations of the remaining 80% of homoeologs that cannot be\nmapped in any one cross, resolving many incongruities between\nmaps of different tetraploid species (which often segregate for\npolymorphic alleles at different homoeologs). The inferred map\nis an excellent resource from which markers can be selected for\nmarker assisted selection, identification of introgression lines,\nQTL mapping, and SNP discovery using sensitive new techniques\nthat permit identification of informative DNA marker alleles in\nsequence-tagged sites such as these that had previously been\nmapped as RFLPs. A growing number of such studies have been\nThe inferred ancestral map is especially important for link-\ning the tetraploid cotton genetic map to emerging BAC-based\nphysical maps, in that it mitigates not only the omission of\nmonomorphic loci, but also any gene loss associated with \"dip-\nloidization\" subsequent to AD polyploid formation. Most of the\nmapped sequences have been used to anchor high-coverage bac-\nterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries of G. hirsutum, G. bar-\nbadense, and G. raimondii (see http://www.plantgenome.uga.edu/\ncotton/CottonDBFrames.htm), the latter of which is also being\ncompletely fingerprinted (http://www.plantgenome.uga.edu/\nprojects.htm#Cotton). This will permit us to resolve more pre-\ncisely the true arrangements of loci that are too closely linked to\norder with confidence based on genetic recombination.\nThe inferred ancestral map of cotton, together with similar\npre- Arabidopsis gene orders, far surpassed the usefulness of\ncomparisons made between extant Arabidopsis and cotton gene\norders to reveal conserved synteny.

Growing evidence suggests that historical esti-\nmates of the role of paleopolyploidy in angiosperm evolution\n(Stebbins 1966) were underestimates, and that the evolutionary\nhistory of all angiosperm genomes includes one or more cycles of\nfindings in cotton were foreshadowed by classical cytogenetic\nstudies (Muravenko et al. 1998) hinting that the ancestors of\ncultivated allotetraploid cotton experienced polyploidization\nevents that far predate the formation of modern allotetraploids\nin the Pleistocene. Wendel and Cronn (2003) systematically re-\nviewed the research results in this area and proposed that present\nAD-genome allotetraploids are likely to be at least paleooctaploid.\nMuch remains to be done. While we have found tentative\ncorrespondence of segments covering about half of the genome,\nwe must assume that many small rearrangements within these\nsegments have escaped detection by the coarse resolution af-\nforded by the (albeit relatively large) number of genetically\nmapped DNA markers in hand. Additional genetic information\nand eventually genomic sequence will further clarify the prob-\nable patterns of gene arrangement that predated this duplication\nin the cotton lineage.\nAlthough we have concentrated in this work on duplication\nevents that occurred more recently than the divergence of the\ncotton and Arabidopsis lineages from a common ancestor, the\neffects of still more ancient duplications shared by the lineages\nare also evident. In several cases, different Arabidopsis -dupli-\ncated segments matching the same cotton region corresponded\nto one another as a result of more ancient  or  duplications\nfound by Bowers et al. (2003) (Supplemental Table 2). For ex-\nample, the cotton chromosomal region shown in Figure 2 mainly\ncorresponded with 11 and 14, except for two loci having con-\nserved synteny with 20. The loci showing conserved synteny\nbetween C06 and four members of these two  duplications were\nlargely collinear on both cotton and Arabidopsis chromosomes.\nFrom Bowers et al. (2003), the homoeologous regions of 11 and\n14 are both thought to derive from the more ancient gene order\nThe true properties of the \"other half\" of the genome, in\nwhich we have not yet found even early evidence of ancient\nduplication, remain to be clarified. For many of these we may\nsimply have too little information to discern a \"signal\" of struc-\ntural conservation from among the many factors that may con-\ntribute noise to this data set. However, genomic regions in which\nchromosome structural rearrangement has been rapid (leaving\nno conserved synteny), appear also to have been subject to rapid\ndivergence of individual gene sequences. In analysis of potential\ncorrespondence, putatively conserved synteny between cotton\nand Arabidopsis (Table 1; Supplemental Table 2). To evaluate their\npatterns of distribution across the genome, the consensus maps\nwere subdivided into bins of 10 cM in length. While all chromo-\n(Fig. 6) contained very similar proportions of sequenced loci, the\npercentage of loci showing putative synteny with Arabidopsis was\nhighly variable. We further plotted the percentage of loci for\nwhich an Arabidopsis homolog could not be identified (Table 1).\nThere was a strong negative correlation (r = 0.57) between the\npercentage of loci (per bin) showing conserved synteny with Ara-\nbidopsis, and the percentage of loci showing no match in Arabi-\ndopsis. This indicates that different genomic regions may tolerate\nrearrangement at different rates, a hypothesis that has previously\nbeen suggested based on the failure to identify ancient duplica-\ntions in centromeric regions of both Arabidopsis and rice. A fas-\ncinating question for further study is whether such rapidly evolv-\ning regions contain a disproportionate share of genes that ac-\ncount for morphological or physiological divergence between\ntaxa, including reproductive isolation.\nOngoing improvement of analytical tools may also help to\nbetter resolve long-range comparative data. The main difference\nbetween CS2 and FISH is the method by which individual points\nin the data matrix are taken as evidence for conserved synteny. In\nCS2, Euclidean distance was used and if points are spatially close\nenough, they will be flagged as correspondence. This algorithm\nmay thus be especially prone to false positives in regions of the\ngenome in which low recombination per unit physical distance\nresults in high marker cosegregation and inability to resolve true\norders of genes along the chromosome. As we noted, CS2 tended\nto detect more correspondence and longer segments in marker-\nrich genomic regions, but multiple associations in these regions\nappear likely to include some false positives. In contrast, in FISH,\nManhattan distance was used and only the points close enough\nto meet likelihood thresholds and also in a roughly diagonal line\nare taken as evidence of correspondence. However, deviations\nfrom such a diagonal may be caused by a number of factors. For\nexample, localized inversions (Grant et al. 2000; Vision et al.\nrecently arisen deviations from an overall pattern of ancient cor-\nrespondence. Further, in comparisons of genetic maps to se-\nquences (or transcript maps as done herein), differences between\nrecombinational and physical distances will again cause devia-\ntions from the diagonal. Finally, with relatively sparse data from\ngenetic maps, many corresponding segments may only be com-\nprised of the minimal set of three (CS2) or even two (Brownstein\net al. 2003) data points. These factors motivated our decision to\ncompare the two different algorithms. While the ultimate solu-\ntion to these limitations will be to sequence the underlying ge-\nnomes, in the meantime, many investigators may reap much\nbenefit from botanical (or other) models in advancing the study\nof a wide range of additional genomes by careful consideration of\nthe consequences of paleopolyploidy, using these or other ap-\nproaches.\nMethods\nAssembling an inferred map of the hypothetical cotton\nancient genome\nGenetic linkage maps of the At (tetraploid A sub genome), Dt\n(tetraploid D sub genome), and D (diploid D genome) chromo-\nRong et al.\nwww.genome.org\nCold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press\ngenome.cshlp.org\nDownloaded from\nFigure 4.

The\nvertical bars highlighted with blue on the map represent the possible locations of centromeres (see Fig. 1B). Solid and broken vertical lines beside the markers represented the duplicated regions\ndetected with FISH and CS2, respectively. The 13 colors identified the chromosomes containing duplicated regions, as shown in the legend.\nRong et al.\nwww.genome.org\nCold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press\ngenome.cshlp.org\nDownloaded from\nsomes, reported by Rong et al. (2004), were used in the construc-\ntion of the inferred ancestral cotton map. A total of 290 new loci\nwere added to the D genome map since publication of the prior\nmap. The probes, procedures, and population used for mapping\nthese new loci were as reported by Rong et al. (2004).\nIt was previously noted that many probes detected multiple\npolymorphic loci (Rong et al. 2004). Many of the duplicates were\ndistributed at collinear locations on the At, Dt, and D chromo-\nsomes, respectively, permitting us to identify homoeologous\ngroups of At, Dt, and D chromosomes. Inferred ancestral maps\nwere assembled from the chromosomes of a homoeologous\ngroup by using common colinear loci for alignment. The Dt ge-\nnome was used as the primary map to which the other maps were\nmerged into. The D map was merged first, followed by the At\nmap, with the exception of chromosome ends (from the end to\nthe first common marker). If the ends of the At or D maps were\nlonger than the corresponding fragments of the Dt map, the\nlonger fragment was used as the primary map for the mapping of\nthis end (Fig. 1A). While this imposes modest bias in the recom-\nbinational lengths of terminal regions, it was necessary to accom-\nmodate the likelihood that the longest terminal interval covers\nmore chromatin than the others. If the markers are in a collinear\norder, but in the opposite direction, the order on the Dt chro-\nmosome was used. Loci that are duplicated on the homoeologous\nchromosomes but not in collinear order, or on nonhomoeolo-\ngous chromosomes, are identified by the addition of a lower-case\nletter at the end of the probe name in the consensus map. Rela-\ntive spacing along the consensus map of the loci in regions be-\ntween two consecutive markers shared by At or D and Dt are\ncalculated as follows:\nHere, M is the marker located on At or D and intended to be\nmerged into the inferred map. M2 is the relative location (dis-\ntance from the top of the inferred maps, cM) of the marker (M) in\nthe inferred map (Fig. 1A). M1 is the original location of marker\nM on At or D. Y1 and Y2 are the location (distance from the top\nof the each homoeologous chromosome, cM) of the first com-\nmon marker (Y) on the At (or D) and inferred map, respectively.\nX1 and X2 are the location of the second common marker (Y) on\nthe At (or D) and inferred map, respectively. To efficiently build\nthe inferred map according to the rules and formula mentioned\nabove, a Web-based computer program was compiled using\nPHP. The code of the program is available at http://www.\nplantgenome.uga.edu/MapMerger/.\nFigure 5.

Common markers between C05 and C09 were highlighted in red. The number in parenthesis after gene 1683 is the\nArabidopsis chromosome. The additional conserved syntenic blocks from Arabidopsis were presented as vertical dashed bars in between segments of\nconsensus cotton chromosomes C05 and C09. The corresponding loci (named per Fig. 2) were linked with lines, blue from C05 and green from C09.\nSolid and broken vertical lines beside the maps represent conserved syntenic regions detected with FISH and CS2, respectively, when C05 and C09 were\nindividually analyzed for conserved synteny with Arabidopsis.\nComparative genomics of cotton and Arabidopsis\nwww.genome.org\nCold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press\ngenome.cshlp.org\nDownloaded from\nComputer software\nsoftware packages were both used to identify putatively dupli-\ncated genomic regions within the hypothetical ancestral cotton\ngenome, as well as putatively corresponding regions between cot-\nton and Arabidopsis. Both packages treat single locus matches\nbetween a pair of genomes as point features that occur in a two-\ndimensional grid. The problem of identifying significant regions\nof colinearity between two genomes is thus reduced to the prob-\nlem of finding significant clusters of points in Euclidean space.\nFISH was designed for Fast Identification of Segmental Ho-\nmologs (Calabrese et al. 2003). FISH preprocesses the matched\nlocus data between two genomes to enforce symmetry and re-\nmove noise from the data set, and then identifies sets of neigh-\nbors. A dynamic programming algorithm is then used to follow a\ntrace-back path that picks the string of neighbors that will yield\nthe maximally extended block. To be considered neighbors by\nFISH, the Manhattan distance\n= |Xi\nXj\n| + |Yi\nYj\n|\nbetween a pair of points i and j must be less than the threshold\ndistance\n=\n+ log1 - T\nlog\nm\nn\n+\nwhere m = number of points, n = number of cells, and T = the\nprobability of having one or more neighbors within a distance\nless than dT\nFISH under the assumption that each cell contains a\npoint with probability m/n.\nThe CS2 package was developed by Ned Levine and Associ-\nates (Levine 2002) under funding from the National Institute of\nJustice and has been made freely available for educational and\nresearch purposes (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/\ncrimestat.html). Although initially developed for the analysis of\ncrime-occurrence data, the package performs measurements of\ncentral tendency, spatial autocorrelation, and hot-spot analysis\nthat can be applied to any spatial data set. Interoperability with\nexisting GIS programs such as ArcView (http://www.esri.com)\nand integrated Dynamic Data Exchange protocols make CS2 a\nflexible tool for both analyzing and visualizing spatial datasets.\nThis package has proven to be useful to scientists studying spatial\npatterns in ecology (Worrall et al. 2004) epidemiology (Brown-\ncould prove to be a powerful tool for assessing spatial patterns in\ngenomic data sets.\nOne CS2 tool useful to genomics is the nearest neighbor\nhierarchical clustering analysis, which provides a means of de-\nlineating significant clusters of points in Euclidean space. This\ntool identifies clusters by finding nearest neighbors that are sepa-\nrated by a Euclidean distance\n= Xi\n- Xj\n- Yj\nthat is less than a minimum threshold distance. This threshold\ndistance is defined to be a one-tailed confidence interval around\nthe expected random values for distance to nearest neighbors\nsuch that,\n=\nA\nN\nA\n\nwhere A is the Area being surveyed, N is the number of sampled\nincidents, and t is the t-value associated with a probability level\nfrom the Student's t-distribution. These nearest neighbor sets are\njoined into hierarchical clusters with a minimum size and prob-\nability level set by the user. CS2 will accept cluster sizes as low as\ntwo points, and can join points with probability values ranging\nis a text file identifying points and their cluster association, as\nwell as an ellipsoid shape file that may be exported to ArcView for\nvisualization of the distribution of clusters.\nIdentification of ancient duplications in the hypothetical\ncotton ancestor\nExcluding the collinear anchor loci used in the construction of\nconsensus maps, many duplicated loci were found at nonhomoe-\nologous locations. To evaluate whether these reflected ancient\nwhole-genome or large-scale duplication in the hypothetical an-\ncestor, these loci were analyzed with FISH and CS2. For FISH, all\nmarkers were arranged in their recombinational order along the\nmap, with co-segregating markers arranged alphabetically (i.e.,\narbitrarily) at a locus. A total of 13 map files were established,\nwith one file per chromosome. Match files are composed of pairs\nof loci from the same probe (named as matching loci). A total of\nthe following parameters: minimum block size, 2 (default is 3);\nFor CS2, the same set of match data as in FISH was used.\nInstead of the marker name used in the above match files, the\naccumulated distances from Chromosome 1 (C01) to C13 were\ncalculated and used as the locus name for all chromosomes. Only\none file was therefore created for all 13 chromosomes and is\ncomposed of two columns, numbers in each column represent-\ning one of the matching loci. The first column was displayed as\nthe x-axis and the second as the y-axis. CS2 analysis used the\nfollowing parameters: minimum points (pairs of matching loci)\nFigure 6.

The likelihood was set to 1%.\nThe lengths of conserved syntenic blocks were estimated by\ncalculating the distance between the delimiting markers in the\nblock detected by FISH or in the cluster detected by CS2.\nArabidopsis gene duplication database\nAssembly of inferred ancestral gene orders along duplicated seg-\nments in the Arabidopsis genome is described elsewhere (Bowers\nwere downloaded from NCBI, encoded by their chromosomal\norder and transcriptional orientation, and compared with each\nother using BLASTP. A total of 23,172 genes were shown to be in\nduplicated regions and grouped into 34 nonoverlapping chromo-\nsomal segments. Name and linear order of these 23,172 genes in\nthe assembled duplications was explained by Bowers et al. (2003)\nand can be found at http://www.nature.com/nature or http://\nwww.plantgenome.uga.edu/ploid.html.\nCotton probe DNA sequencing and BLAST search against\nArabidopsis sequence database\nMapped cotton probes were sequenced as reported by Rong et al.\n(2004) and listed in Supplemental Table 1. Cotton sequences as\nquery were compared with Arabidopsis gene sequences by search-\ning all 26,028 genes in the Arabidopsis sequence database using\nBLASTX. Here, cotton query sequences are DNA sequences and\nArabidopsis are translated protein sequences. The top 10 matches\nthat met a threshold of E < 1010 were used for further analysis.\nEvaluation of conserved synteny between cotton and\nArabidopsis\nBoth FISH and CS2 were also applied in the analysis of conserved\nsynteny between cotton and Arabidopsis, and the same param-\neters used as in the identification of ancient duplication in the\nhypothetical cotton ancestor. Cotton-mapping data used here\nwas the same as that in the identification of cotton ancient du-\nplication by CS2 with the following modifications. The location\nof a given marker was determined by the accumulated locus\nnumber along chromosomes instead of the accumulated genetic\ndistance. The marker location for a given marker was standard-\nized by multiplying the marker location of a given locus by the\nratio of the total Arabidopsis gene number to cumulative cotton\ngene number. This was based on the assumption that cotton and\nArabidopsis have a similar gene number. This was done so that\nthe two genomes could be aligned on x- and y-axes and direct\ncomparisons made in CS2 and have the same chance to be com-\npared in FISH.\nSimilarly, all 34 Arabidopsis  duplications were combined\nconsecutively into a single unit in ascending order of the dupli-\ncate segment numbers (in the nomenclature of Bowers et al.\n2003). The location of a given Arabidopsis gene was assigned as\nthe accumulated gene number. In order to avoid bias from proxi-\nmal duplicated genes on the estimation of conserved synteny\nbetween cotton and Arabidopsis, the distance (gene number)\namong the top 10 Arabidopsis matches to each cotton query se-\nquence were calculated before running FISH and CS2. If the best\nmatches were <30 genes apart along the Arabidopsis duplicated\nsegment, we tentatively considered the genes to be proximal du-\nplicates, and only one gene from such groups was kept for further\nanalysis. The middle gene in the proximal duplicates was kept\nbecause it was the best representative of all proximal genes. If\nthere was an even number of genes in the proximal duplication,\nthe first of the middle two genes was kept. We used the number\n30 because it was statistically unlikely (5%) that more than one\nmatch fell in an interval of this size by chance, even allowing\nconsideration of the top 10 matches. Similarly, if a single Arabi-\ndopsis gene matched multiple cotton loci <5 cM apart, we\ncounted only a single match.\n"
