    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe rise of Big Data in the social realm poses significant questions at the intersection of science, technology, and society,\nincluding in terms of how new large-scale social databases are currently changing the methods, epistemologies, and\npolitics of social science. In this commentary, we address such epochal (``large-scale'') questions by way of a (situated)\nexperiment: at the Danish Technical University in Copenhagen, an interdisciplinary group of computer scientists, physi-\ncists, economists, sociologists, and anthropologists (including the authors) is setting up a large-scale data infrastructure,\nmeant to continually record the digital traces of social relations among an entire freshman class of students (N > 1000).\nAt the same time, fieldwork is carried out on friendship (and other) relations amongst the same group of students. On\nthis basis, the question we pose is the following: what kind of knowledge is obtained on this social micro-cosmos via the\nBig (computational, quantitative) and Small (embodied, qualitative) Data, respectively? How do the two relate? Invoking\nBohr's principle of complementarity as analogy, we hypothesize that social relations, as objects of knowledge, depend\ncrucially on the type of measurement device deployed. At the same time, however, we also expect new interferences and\npolyphonies to arise at the intersection of Big and Small Data, provided that these are, so to speak, mixed with care.\nThese questions, we stress, are important not only for the future of social science methods but also for the type of\nsocietal (self-)knowledge that may be expected from new large-scale social databases.\n",

The cross-\ndisciplinary field of ``computational social science'' is a\ncase in point. Consider the following two citations,\ntaken from the agenda-setting 2009 Science paper co-\nauthored by leading researchers from this nascent field,\nand from a recent column in Huffington Post by US\nIn short, a computational social science is emerging\nthat leverages the capacity to collect and analyze data\nwith an unprecedented breadth and depth and scale.\nThe problem of Big Data is here to stay, which means\nthat in the coming months and years we'll need a legion\nof ethnographically trained analysts to produce `Thick\nData' \u00ad to save us from ourselves. (Stoller, 2013)\nLazer et al. (2009), of course, echo broader visions\n(in)famously made on behalf of the scientific ``Big\nData revolution'' such as Chris Anderson's controver-\nsial claim about a supposed ``end of theory'' (2008). On\nhis part, Stoller draws heavily on a blog posting by\nTricia Wang (2013), who argues that ``ethnographers\nmust engage with Big Data,'' for fear of being ``mini-\nmized as a small line item on a budget, and relegated to\nthe small data corner.''\nOur ambition in this piece is to sketch an alternative\nto these two mutually exclusive (and mutually hostile)\nunderstandings of the role and value of (seemingly)\n``big'' quantitative data and (seemingly) ``small'' quali-\ntative data methods and approaches in contemporary\nresearch and society. To do so, we pose the following\nquestions: how do the kinds of knowledge that can be\nobtained from ``Big'' (computational) and ``Small''\n(ethnographic) data, respectively, relate or not relate?\nIndeed, beyond the suggestion of Stoller and ``like-\nminded'' social scientists voicing tout court concern\nabout Big Data, might the notion of thick data\n(c.f. op cit; see also Boellstorff, 2013) be put to better\nuse to denote what relates, rather than what separates,\ninnovative approaches to future social science experi-\nments? Invoking Bohr's principle of complementarity,\nwe contend that social relations, as objects of both sci-\nentific and everyday knowledge, indeed depend on the\ntype of measurement device deployed for their observa-\ntion. At the same time, we propose that new productive\ninterferences may be expected to arise at the intersec-\ntion of Big and Small Data, provided that these are, so\nto speak, mixed with care.\nBelow, we explore such questions by way of discuss-\ning a specific social science experiment, which attempts\nto mix computational and ethnographic methods\ninto what might be dubbed ``Complementary Social\nScience,'' namely the Copenhagen Social Networks\nStudy. In this research project, an interdisciplinary\ngroup of computer scientists, physicists, economists,\nsociologists and anthropologists (including our-\nselves) has recently embarked on a novel attempt to\ncombine quantitative width and qualitative depth in\nmapping the spatio-temporal details of a concrete\nsocial network.\nSocial fabric: Remixing mixed methods\nThe Copenhagen Social Networks Study is a large-scale\ncross-disciplinary research program jointly hosted by the\nFaculty of Social Sciences, University of Copenhagen,\nand the Department of Informatics and Mathematical\nModelling at the Danish Technical University (DTU).\nOur 25-plus member big team collaborates to make con-\ntinuous recordings of social interactions at all commu-\nnication channels among an entire freshman class\n(N > 1000) of DTU students, using smart phones distrib-\nuted to students (as well as to members of the project\ngroup) as measurement devices (``socio-meters''). This\nallows us to digitally map out the ``complete'' social net-\nwork of an entire freshman class, including face-to-face\nencounters via Bluetooth, geo-location proximities via\nGPS, social network data via apps, and telecommunica-\ntion data via call logs. The set-up also includes, by way\nof ``embedding'' an anthropologist within the freshmen\ngroup for an entire year, ``thick'' ethnographic fieldwork\ndata on friendship and other social relations amongst the\nsame group of students. Simultaneously, researchers\ntrack different components of the social fabric via the\napplication of established survey methods (for an over-\nview, see Stopczynski et al., 2014). This vast and hetero-\ngeneous collection of data on a large-scale social\nnetwork infrastructure is being used to study:\n(i) How information and influence are transmitted\nand transformed in the DTU ``social fabric''\n(ii) How friendships, networks and behaviors form,\noffline and online\n(iii) How the researchers themselves study ``Big Data''\nand handle issues of ethics and privacy\nWithin this framework, a team of sociologists and\nanthropologists (senior scholars, doctoral students, and\nundergraduates) from Copenhagen University, led by\nthe two of us, conduct a joint ``Ant-Soc'' work package,\n2 Big Data & Society\nwhich aims to push current boundaries for mixing and\ncross-fertilizing quantitatively and qualitatively based\nsocial network research. We do this by exploring a\nnumber of closely interrelated research questions,\nthemes and methods at the core of current concerns\nin sociology, anthropology, and science and technology\nstudies (STS) \u00ad as well as in the cross-disciplinary fields\nof computational, digital, and experimental social sci-\nence \u00ad including:\n. Ethnographic fieldwork \u00ad how can ethnographic stu-\ndies of friendship and other social network relations\namongst students enrich or challenge computational\napproaches \u00ad and vice versa?\n. Quali-quantitative methods \u00ad does the rise of com-\nputational social science lead to a reconfiguration of\ntraditional splits between quantitative and qualita-\ntive research methods?\n. Big data experiments \u00ad what kinds of anthropo-\nlogical and sociological experiments does our set-\nup enable, and how might such innovations enrich\nexisting social-scientific designs?\n. Social life of Big Data \u00ad what new ethical, political\nand organizational challenges and opportunities\ndoes the rise of large-scale social databases pose to\nthe social sciences and society at large?\n. Research collaboration \u00ad taken as an object of STS,\nwhat may be learned about cross-disciplinary collab-\noration from the research program itself?\nIn terms of social science methods, the unique cross-\ndisciplinary and cross-institutional set-up of the\nCopenhagen Social Networks Study allows for drawing\ntogether two hitherto distinct literatures, on computa-\ntional social science (e.g. Lazer et al., 2009) and mixed\nmethods (e.g. Creswell, 2011), respectively. To the best\nof our knowledge, researchers in computational social\nscience are yet to acknowledge the potential significance\nto their work of grounded participant-observation in\nthe ethnographic tradition. Conversely, the mixed\nmethods literature so far has not picked up the chal-\nlenges and opportunities of large-scale digital data, and\nis therefore at risk of remaining trapped within an\nobsolete distinction between qualitative and quantita-\ntive (i.e. survey-based) approaches. This methodo-\nlogical remixing \u00ad which allows for new ways of\nstitching together computational and ethnographic\ndata \u00ad is what we propose to dub ``complementary\nsocial science.''\nBohr revisited: A complementary\nsocial science?\nWhat can we say about the relationship between ``big''\nor ``deep'' (i.e. computational) and ``small'' or ``thick''\n(i.e. ethnographic) data approaches in light of our\nexperiences from the Copenhagen Social Networks\nStudy project so far? To begin with, the collaborative\nresearch vision we advocate here differs from the hostile\nstance towards Big Data by increasing numbers of\nqualitative social scientists. Valuable as the emerging\nCritical Big Data Studies Paradigm (as one might call\nit) undoubtedly will prove to be, it tacitly relies upon\nand thus reproduces a problematic bifurcation between\n``hard'' quantitative evidence in need of further inter-\npretation and ``soft'' qualitative data imbued with ``the\nmeaning'' needed to close this hermeneutic gap.\nStoller's and Wang's positions:\n[I]t is increasingly important to recognize the value of\n`small data'. [. . .] Take, for example, the work of Veinot\n(2007), who followed one worker \u00ad a vault inspector at\na hydroelectric utility company \u00ad in order to under-\nstand the information practices of a blue-collar\nworker. [. . .] Her work tells a story that could not be\ndiscovered by farming millions of Facebook or Twitter\naccounts.\nWhile we very much sympathize with Boyd and\nCrawford's ambition to affirm the lasting value of eth-\nnography and its critical potential, arguments such as\nthe above also tend to reproduce prevailing assump-\ntions that ``big'' and ``small'' data and methods are\nsimply mutually exclusive. This runs counter to what\nwe would like to think the Copenhagen Social\nNetworks Study project allows for, which is to make\n``big'' and ``small'' data mutually dependent and enhan-\ncing, and thus potentially recalibrate this and other\nunhelpful bifurcations between so-called quantitative\nand so-called qualitative data worlds. That, after all,\nis what complementarity in Bohr's definition was all\nabout: an epistemological and ontological predicament,\nwhereby two phenomena or processes are at one and\nthe same time totally disparate and totally interdepend-\n``Complementarity entails two important features:\nmutual exclusivity and mutual necessity. For two vari-\nables to be complementary they have to be both simul-\ntaneously necessary and mutually exclusive. Otherwise,\nwhat is the paradox?''. Critical Big Data studies, it\nseems to us, risk losing the paradox of complementarity\nrather than benefitting from it.\nAnother problem with such an emerging ``critical\nconsensus'' amongst qualitative social scientists is its\noverly narrow understanding of what critique is.\nPut bluntly, there is something unsatisfactory\nabout reducing the intervention that sociologists and\nanthropologists like us can make on Big Data realities\nand discourses to a one-dimensional question of\nBlok and Pedersen 3\ndeconstruction and debunking. Again, we are of course\nnot claiming that allegedly ``neutral'' incipient hege-\nmonic discourses on, e.g., so-called non-theoretical\ncomputational social science can and should not be\nquestioned. All we are suggesting is that too much\ndefault Big Data bashing runs the risk of tacitly relying\non an assumed vantage point from outside these dis-\ncourses and practices \u00ad a quite conservative observa-\ntional ``fly on the wall'' position from which the\nanthropologist and sociologist are taken to enjoy\nunique access to both her object of study and a broader\n``context'' of which it is supposedly a ``part'' (cf. Riles,\n1998). Take, for instance, Mike Savage and Roger\nBurrows's (2007) otherwise pertinent points about\nwhat they (following Nigel Thrift) dub ``knowing cap-\nitalism''; surely, we might counter, there is more to the\nBig Data challenge than merely diagnosing a new form\nof capitalism?\nIn the Copenhagen Social Networks Study project,\nadopting such a conservative notion of critique would\nentail that physicists like Sune Lehman (the PI from\nDTU) were located fully within the large-scale social\nnetwork database investigated by our interdisciplinary\nteam, whereas sociologists and anthropologists, such as\nthe two of us, would be positioned on the outside of this\nBig Data reality and discourse. All we would do (or\npretend to be doing) as so-called critical anthropolo-\ngists and sociologists, then, would be to observe pur-\nportedly ``native'' computational social scientists by\nlooking at them from the outside in, seeking to identify,\nmonitor, trace, describe and ultimately decode the more\nor less exotic ideas and practices of this scientific\n``tribe.'' Yet, exciting and self-satisfying as this would\nundoubtedly be, we would thereby end up replicating\nthe dubious assumptions about mutual exclusivity\nbetween quantitative Big Data and qualitative small\ndata social science that we set out to transcend in the\nfirst place.\nOur vision of a complementary social science is\nmeant to offer a way of avoiding such pitfalls. By\nattempting to mix and even merge our own research\nagendas, perspectives, and methodologies with our\n``native'' computational social scientific ``informants,''\nwe have from the onset of the project attempted to\nposition ourselves within the large-scale social network\ndatabase under investigation, not on the outside of it \u00ad\nas would be the aspiration of many conventional\nscience studies approaches. For only by in this way\nstrategically striving to partly collapse our own\nresearch interests with those of the other researchers\ninvolved in the Copenhagen Social Networks Study\ncan we hope to move from mutual exclusivity to inter-\ndependency in the complementarity between computa-\ntional and ethnographic approaches. We like to think\nof this as a germane strategy for gradually\nreconfiguring the very epistemological, methodological,\nand political playing field onto which the recently\nmuch-hyped discourses of ``Big Data'' social science\nmake claim. As an attempt to work around and thus\ndistort what is on the inside and what is on the outside\nof various conventionalized bifurcations and contrasts\n(researcher vs. research object; natural science vs. social\nscience/humanities; ``hard'' quantitative vs. ``soft''\nqualitative data and approaches), our vision of a com-\nplementary social science contains the promise of an\n``immanent,'' non-skeptical critique (cf. Holbraad\net al., 2013) of narrowly technical and neo-positivist\ncelebrations of Big Data in research as well as non-\nresearch contexts.\nQuali-quantitative methods\nIn a recent article aptly entitled ``The whole is always\nsmaller than its parts,'' Latour et al. ask:\n[. . .] [I]s there a way to define what is a longer lasting\nsocial order without making the assumption that there\nexist two levels [of individuals and structures]. [. . .]\nInstead of having to choose and thus to jump from\nindividuals to wholes, from micro to macro, [we want\nto] occupy all sorts of other positions, constantly rear-\nranging the way profiles are interconnected and over-\nTo a large extent, this passage captures what the two of\nus hope to achieve from our quest to laterally assemble\ninto a single research reality (or ``research\nrelationality'') the two hitherto bifurcated social scien-\ntific arenas of Big and Small data: by stubbornly resist-\ning the temptation to perceive the cross-disciplinary\nCopenhagen Social Networks Study as comprised by\ntwo mutually exclusive methodological and\nepistemological domains \u00ad a quantitative and a\nqualitative one, respectively \u00ad we wish to insist on the\npotential for new and progressive forms of what Latour\net al. (2012) dub ``quali-quantitative methods.'' This,\nhowever, raises a new order of urgent questions.\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that, within algo-\nrithmically generated Big Data worlds such as the\ndigital database generated in our research program,\nthe ``part'' is indeed often bigger than the ``whole,'' as\nLatour et al. suggest. This is illustrated, for instance, by\nthe way in which complexity in quantitative social net-\nwork mappings tends to increase, as opposed\nto decrease, the moment one looks not for ``aggregate''\nstatic structures but for the replication, say, of ever\nmore fine-grained ``temporal motifs'' in dynamic inter-\naction patterns across smaller groups (Kovanen et al.,\n2011). But are such granularities necessarily the same in\nBig and Small data worlds?\n4 Big Data & Society\nBy investing so heavily in the promises of new large-\nscale ``digital trace'' databases, Latour et al. may risk\nlosing sight of the ways in which disparate data worlds\nrub off against and emerge from each other, rather than\nproducing new seamless ``wholes.'' Within computa-\ntional social science, for instance, the focus on granu-\nlarity ``drives forward a concern with the microscopic,\nthe way that amalgamations of databases can allow\never more granular, unique, specification''\nCopenhagen Social Networks Study project, we hope\nto extend the method of quali-quantitative research by\nmaking the very study of social relations \u00ad by means of\nethnographic fieldwork, surveys, digital traces, and so\non \u00ad part and parcel of the experimental set-up itself.\nBy doing so, we put ourselves in a position to experi-\nment on social science complementarity in practice:\nhow, we ask, may our experimental settings of obser-\nvation themselves be experimentally varied so as to\ncreate different kinds of mutual necessity between Big\n(computational) and Small (ethnographic) data? What\nforms of ``granularity,'' ``thickness,'' and ``depth'' arise\nfrom engaging in, rather than simply tracing, concrete\nwork of computational data design, compilation and\nassemblage, alongside ethnographic descriptions (see\nIn pursuing this kind of experimental approach, new\nand difficult questions of research ethics emerge, in part\nbecause established conventions on how to deal respon-\nsibly with issues of privacy, confidentiality, etc., differ\nwidely between (and to some degree also within) com-\nputational and ethnographic approaches. Here as well,\nhowever, much-needed dialogues and imports should\ngo both ways, as computational researchers stand to\nlearn from routine experiences, on the part of field-\nworkers, of gaining access to ``private'' layers of peo-\nple's lives far beyond what should ever be conveyed in\n``public'' research. We need to ask: what could ethically\nappropriate, and indeed ethically desirable, forms of\ncomplementary social science data be?\nAt this relatively early stage of our collective endea-\nvors, it is still premature to give definite answers to such\nepistemological and ethical questions. What we can\nprovide, however, is a flavor of what we have in\nmind. For example: how might the combination of\nethnographic embedding and computational data help\nus understand the way various affective moods,\nimpulses, and rumors spread throughout a collectivity?\ndata favored by most computational social science\nlends itself to entirely ``non-individualist'' accounts of\nsocial life, where the play of fluid and dynamic trans-\nactions is the focus of attention. In our setting, one\nquestion might be: what role does parties and partying\nplay in the formation of social connections, and how\ncan we quantify the importance of ``ambience,'' ``atmos-\nphere,'' ``togetherness,'' and so on in this respect \u00ad\n``quali-quantities'' which, from a standard sociological\nand anthropological point of view, would be purely\nqualitative? What, in turn, might such new data assem-\nblages that ``stitch together'' data worlds produced\nthrough computational and ethnographic methods do\nto established concepts of ``personhood,'' ``sociality,''\nand ``politics''?\nConclusion\nWe are well aware that our vision of a complementary\nsocial science for the 21st century raises many new\nquestions and numerous potential objections. Apart\nfrom the sheer ``technical'' challenges of remixing dif-\nferent methods, devices, infrastructures, and data forms\n(ranging from ethnographic field notes to database\nalgorithms) into ``thick'' data, questions arise at the\nheart of the philosophy of science. For example: if it\nis indeed the case that, in computational social science,\nwe leave behind the search for causal statistical model-\ning and enter a new world of visual ``pattern recogni-\ntime-honored distinctions between numbers and narra-\ntives; description and explanation; and indeed, simula-\ntion and the real world? Such questions, it seems to us,\nare not just becoming ever more pertinent with ongoing\ndigital social database developments (including recent\nscares and scandals). They can also only be addressed\nin the same ``messy'' interface between basic research,\nsocial and political engagement, and collaborative\nexperimentation, which Niels Bohr pioneered in\nhis time.\nFurthermore, as noted, our vision of a complemen-\ntary social science must respond to legitimate and\nurgent ethical and political concerns \u00ad raised by both\ncritics and supporters of computational data \u00ad with\nregard to issues of surveillance, privacy, and future\nmisuse of data. Once again, without claiming to have\nin any way ``solved'' these issues, the Copenhagen\nSocial Networks Study team has already taken some\nimportant steps in trying to make data available to\nthe research subjects themselves via apps and websites\n(including the official project website: https://\nwww.sensible.dtu.dk/), as well as more interactive on-\nand offline forums, and by including members of the\nproject team themselves in the experiment. In this sense,\nour notion of complementarity extends to the mutual\ndependencies of researchers and their subjects; to the\ngreatest extent possible, research subjects should be cast\nas co-producers of knowledge about themselves, just as\nresearchers should strive whenever feasible to render\nthemselves subject to their own research questions\nand methods. Our collaborative research program,\nBlok and Pedersen 5\nthen, is not just about methods and results; it is also,\nmore broadly or ``thickly,'' an experiment in ``data\ndemocracy.''\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author declares that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding\nagency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\n"
