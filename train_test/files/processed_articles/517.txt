We analysed the WHS data to assess the global patterns of\nself-reported wheeze and doctor-diagnosed asthma, two commonly reported measures of\nrespiratory health.\nIn total there were 308,218 participants with complete records, from 64 countries. The weighted\nmean age of the survey population was 43 yrs. Global prevalence of current wheezing symptoms\nranged from 2.4% in Vietnam to 24% in Brazil; the prevalence of diagnosed asthma ranged from\n1.8% in Vietnam to 32.8% in Australia. Overall, the prevalence of symptoms and diagnosis showed\na U-shaped pattern with the largest prevalence reported in low- and high-income countries. The\nsmallest prevalence was consistently found in middle-income countries.\nThese WHS analyses have provided global prevalence estimates of wheeze and doctor-\ndiagnosed asthma using data gathered simultaneously and consistently across six continents.\nThese findings support the need for continued global respiratory illness surveillance for disease\nprevention, health policy and management.\n",

All 192 WHO\nmember states were invited to take part in this effort and just\nover one-third participated.\nWhile the WHS collected data across six continents from adults\naged o18 yrs, ECRHS only gathered information from Europe\nand Australia, and ISAAC is restricted data collection to\nchildren aged ,15 yrs.\nIn the research described herein, WHS data were utilised to\nassess the global patterns of respiratory disease. The objectives\nof our study were to quantify the prevalence of respiratory\nsymptoms and diagnosis worldwide using data collected with\nidentical survey questions and systematic population survey\nmethods; and to describe the variations in respiratory\nsymptom and diagnosis prevalence across world regions\naccording to national income.\nStudy subjects and data collection methods\nThe WHS was administered in 70 countries, of which 68\nresponded to respiratory symptom questions and 64 reported\non asthma diagnosis. Each country's national health ministry\nwas responsible for the survey programme. The countries that\nchose to participate in the survey, their economic standing\n(income status), sample size and type of survey used (short or\nfull) can be found on the WHO website for the WHS [18]. The\nfull questionnaire included questions on several factors\nassociated with living conditions in most economically develop-\ning nations (such as mud housing) and collected information on\nsocial habits in countries where such surveillance systems do\nnot exist (such as smoking prevalence). The short version\nomitted several of these questions and was administered to\nmostly higher income countries. WHO provided each country\nwith the relevant training to carry out the survey and conduct\nThe WHS had a list of options and modules for the various\nsurvey components. The modules measured aspects of health\nin multiple domains: 1) risk factors, e.g. tobacco, alcohol and\npollution; 2) responsiveness of health systems and whether\nhealth systems met expectations; 3) coverage, access and\nutilisation of key health services, e.g. immunisation, treatment\nof childhood illness, sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/\nAIDS; and 4) healthcare expenditures. Each country chose\nwhich combination of modules to use.\nA number of pre-tested survey administration tools were\navailable and each country could choose the method that it\njudged most practical and cost-effective. The choices were the\nfollowing: household face-to-face survey; computer-assisted\ntelephone interview survey, which was conducted using\ncomputerised systems when there was good telephone net-\nwork coverage; and computer-assisted personal interview\nsurvey using a portable personal computer to replace paper\nand pen methods of data collection.\nThe eligible population for the WHS consisted of adults aged\no18 yrs. The sample from each country was stratified by sex,\nage and type of residence (rural/urban). Individuals were\nsampled from these strata and each respondent was given a\nseparate sampling probability value (or weight). Only one\nperson from a randomly selected household was interviewed\nfor the individual questionnaire and was ultimately included\nin these analyses.\nNational income\nCountries were grouped by their per capita gross national\nincome in purchasing power parity (GNI PPP) [18, 19], which\nwere taken from the World Bank's data and statistics tables [19,\n20]. Countries were classified into tertiles based on GNI PPP:\nanalyses were conducted on ungrouped countries as well as\nwith the tertiles.\nSampling weights\nThe WHS employed a probability sampling design. This meant\nthat every individual in the sampling frame (o18 yrs) had a\nknown and non-zero chance of being selected into the survey\nsample. Some countries used a single-stage random-sample\nstrategy; however, most sites carried out multi-stage cluster\nsampling methods and probability weights were used for each\nstage. In either case, the WHS sampling frame aimed to cover\n100% of the eligible population in the surveyed country.\nTherefore, the weighted estimates are corrected for the indivi-\ndual probabilities of being surveyed. Further details about the\nWHO sampling guidelines are available from WHO [18].\nFor a multi-stage cluster sample, the total probability of being\nsampled was calculated by multiplying all the probabilities\nwithin a sample stage. The inverse of this total probability was\nthe probabilistic individual weight for a specific person within\nthe country. A total weight was calculated for each country by\nadding all the individual weights and comparing the sum with\nthe country population; for countries that used a single-stage\nrandom sample or when the sum of all the weights did not add\nup to the adult country population (o18 yrs), a correction\nfactor was used. Therefore, the weighted data represented\npooled data corrected by the individual probability of being\nsurveyed (based on age, sex and urban/rural location) and\ncountry population.\nSex and age\nSex was recorded as female or male on the basis of the\ninterviewer's observation. The WHS questionnaire had two\nquestions for age. The primary question for age was a\ncontinuous variable. In cases where respondents declined to\nanswer the question, interviewers were advised to estimate\ntheir age in categories. For the purpose of these analyses, the\nage ranges were re-grouped into three categories: 18\u00ad29 yrs\nanalysis was conducted in 18\u00ad44-yr-olds to compare with\nanalyses of the entire the WHS population, as respiratory\nsymptoms (for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, for\nexample) are far more common at older ages.\nSmoking\nThe short version of the questionnaire omitted the questions\nrelating to tobacco smoking. The question on the long version\nwas, ``do you currently smoke any tobacco products such as\ncigarettes, cigars or pipes?'' with the following response\nchoices: daily; yes, but not daily; and no, not at all. A\nrespondent was considered a current smoker if he/she\nanswered positively (daily or yes but not daily).\nUrban/rural\nThe household survey for the WHS included information on\nlocation with the following categories used for classification: 1)\nurban; 2) peri-urban/semi-urban; 3) rural; and 4) other. These,\nalong with external databases describing population distribu-\ntions [21] for countries that had missing values in the WHS\n(Australia, Nepal, Norway, the Netherlands, and Slovenia),\nwere used to distinguish urban and rural areas during\nanalyses. Countries that had o50% rural households were\nclassified as mostly rural; those with ,50% rural were\nclassified as mostly urban.\nIncome inequality\nAn external database was used to import information on country\nlevel income inequality (Gini coefficient) to merge with the WHS\ndata [21]. The Gini coefficient is a measure of household income\ninequality within a country [21, 22]. Gini values for the Comoros\nwere not available and analyses were conducted by placing the\ncountry as high inequality, then low inequality, then by leaving\nthe country out entirely, to note any differences in disease\nprevalence for the categories. No difference was evident, so Gini\nfor Comoros was left as missing. Countries with 45 or greater for\na Gini coefficient were considered to have high income inequal-\nity, countries below 45 were considered to have low income\ninequality. Further summaries for the country classifications are\navailable in the supplementary material.\nRespiratory outcomes\nFive questions on respiratory symptom and diagnosis were\nused to describe current wheezing symptoms and diagnosed\nasthma.\nCurrent wheezing symptoms\nThese were indicated if there was a positive response to any of\nthe following symptom questions. During the last 12 months,\nhave you experienced any of the following: 1) attacks of\nwheezing or whistling breathing? (yes/no); or 2) attacks of\nwheezing that came on after you stopped exercising or some\nother physical activity? (yes/no). These questions differ\nslightly from those used in ECHRS (``have you had wheezing\nor whistling in your chest at any time in the last 12 months?'')\n[11, 23] and ISAAC (``have you had wheezing or whistling in\nthe chest in the past 12 months?'' and ``how many attacks of\nDiagnosed asthma\nThis was indicated if there was a positive response to any of the\ndiagnosis questions: 1) ``have you ever been diagnosed with\nasthma (an allergic respiratory disease)?'' (yes/no/don't know);\n2) ``have you ever been treated for it?'' (yes/no/don't know); 3)\n``have you been taking any medications or other treatment for it\nduring the last 2 weeks?'' (yes/no/don't know). Responses of\n``don't know'' were coded as ``no'' for the respiratory outcomes.\nThese questions differ slightly from those used in ECHRS\n(``have you ever had asthma?'' and ``was this confirmed by a\ndoctor?'') [11, 23] and ISAAC (no direct questions on asthma\ndiagnosis in the core questionnaire) [24\u00ad26].\nStatistical analysis\nThe authors received the final country datasets from WHO in\nAugust 2005. All analyses were conducted using SAS statistical\nsoftware (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) [27, 28]. SAS\nsurvey procedures (proc surveyfreq and surveymeans) were\nused to account for sampling weights and the complex sampling\ndesign effect. Further details of the data analysis methods are\ndescribed elsewhere [29, 30]. Proc glimmix (SAS Institute, Inc.)\nwas used to obtain weighted multilevel prevalence ratios as a\nmeasure of risk in these cross-sectional data.\nExcept for a few nonparametric analyses (to obtain Spearman's\nrank correlation coefficients), all analyses used the individual\nweights described above and accounted for the complex\nsampling design effect. Results were stratified by sex, smoking\nstatus (where available) and national income.\nMissing data\nRespondents who did not provide data on respiratory out-\ncomes were excluded from the analyses. Current wheezing\nsymptoms were not asked in Hungary and Nepal, and\ndiagnosed asthma data was not obtained from Guatemala,\nEthiopia, Nepal, Hungary, Israel or Mexico. Consequently,\nthese countries do not appear in any tables or figures for those\noutcomes.\nMiscoded responses or out-of-range codes were changed to\nmissing and excluded from the analysis. The question on\ntobacco smoking was not included in the short questionnaire,\nthus the following countries are missing from the analyses\nwith smoking: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland,\nFrance, Germany, UK, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy,\nLuxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and Portugal.\nThe study materials and methods were approved by the\ninstitutional review board at the University of Massachusetts\n(Lowell, MA, USA).\nRESULTS\nweighted mean age of the survey population was 43 yrs.\nFinland had the highest weighted mean age overall (53 yrs)\nand Slovakia had the lowest at 34 yrs. Among the portion of\nrespondents that answered the tobacco use questions, current\nsmokers were less frequent than nonsmokers. Rural house-\nholds accounted for 70% overall and there were slightly more\ncountries with high income inequality (55%). The middle GNI\nPPP category accounted for 44% of the global study popula-\ntion, while 35% were in the low-income group and 21% in the\nhigh-income countries.\nRespiratory outcomes and population characteristics\nCurrent wheezing symptoms were more prevalent than\ndiagnosed asthma (table 1). Smokers and those aged .50 yrs\nshowed the highest prevalence of both categories of asthma.\nMales more frequently reported current wheezing symptoms\nthan females. Overall prevalence patterns of current wheezing\nsymptoms and diagnosed asthma showed some expected\npatterns: an increase with age and more common in smokers\nthan nonsmokers.\nRespiratory outcomes among countries\nThere was a 10-fold variation in current wheezing symptom\nprevalence across countries (2.4% in Vietnam and 24.3% in\nBrazil). With a few exceptions, most of the countries\ngeographically in the global north had a higher prevalence of\nc\ncurrent wheezing symptoms than most of the countries in the\nglobal south (fig. 1).\nDiagnosed asthma showed a narrower range in prevalence\nacross countries; the majority of estimates fell within a four-\nfold range of prevalence, with Vietnam the lowest at 1.8% and\nAustralia the highest at 32.8% (fig. 2).\nRespiratory outcomes and national income\nRegression analyses that included national income without\ngrouping the countries into tertiles showed almost no associa-\ntion with respiratory symptoms or diagnosis (adjusted PR\nsis, respectively). However, for countries grouped by national\nincome, the high-national income group had the highest\noverall weighted prevalence for all respiratory outcomes, with\ncurrent wheezing symptoms at 11.7% (fig. 1) and diagnosed\nasthma at 9.3% (fig. 2). Prevalence was lowest in the middle-\nnational income group, with current wheezing symptoms at\n6.7% and diagnosed asthma at 4.5%. Nevertheless, the middle\nincome countries had the largest inter-country range in\nprevalence of current wheezing symptoms (3.3% in China\nand 24.3% in Brazil). For diagnosed asthma, the widest range\nin prevalence was found in the high national income group\n(4.2% in Russia and 32.8% in Australia).

Exceptions to this pattern were found for mostly\nurban regions and low-Gini countries, where the pattern\nshowed a peak in current wheezing symptoms for middle-\nincome countries and an increasing upward trend in diag-\nnosed asthma prevalence (moving from low- to high-income\ncountries) for urban regions only. This U-shaped prevalence\npattern remained in individual categories of smoking and sex,\nas well as in mostly rural regions and among high-Gini\ncountries, even after adjusting for age (table 2). The U-shaped\npattern remained even in subgroup analyses of 18\u00ad44-yr-olds.\nIt should also be noted that the highest prevalence of current\nwheezing symptoms was found in low-income countries with\nhigh income inequality (table 2).\nThe country-level correlation between diagnosed asthma and\ncurrent wheezing symptoms was lowest in the middle\nnational-income group (Spearman's correlation coefficient:\nDISCUSSION\nAmong the 68 countries with responses to wheezing symp-\ntoms and the 64 countries surveying diagnosed asthma\noutcomes in the WHS, the prevalence varied greatly, ranging\n32.8% for diagnosed asthma. In general, highly industrialised\n(higher income) countries, such as Australia and countries in\nWestern Europe, had the higher prevalence of current\nwheezing symptoms and diagnosed asthma, while lower\nprevalence was found in middle-income countries, particularly\nin eastern and central Europe. Brazil, as a middle-income\ncountry, was notable for its very high prevalence of both\ndiagnosed asthma and current wheezing symptoms. Although\nBrazil was in the middle-income countries, it had a high Gini\ncoefficient [21] and, thus, high within country income inequal-\nity and also had almost 85% (see online supplementary\nmaterial) of the survey population responding from urban\nhouseholds (high urbanisation) indicating that both the income\ninequality and high urbanisation might be factors in the high\nprevalence of respiratory disease reporting from Brazil [15].\nAt the community or national level, respiratory disease/\nasthma reporting could greatly affect the estimated prevalence,\nespecially if mortality rates from these conditions are high. In\nmost of the countries identified in the middle-national income\ngroup, GINA reports have identified very high-mortality rates\ndue to asthma relative to the low prevalence reported for this\ngroup [13, 16, 17]. However, even with low country reporting\nrates, other influential factors may be at play, such as:\nenvironmental (urban air) pollution, which has been identified\nas a risk factor for respiratory illness in both children [31\u00ad34]\nand adults [17, 35]; access to healthcare and disease informa-\ntion (which allow for disease identification, treatment, and\nhypothesis [39\u00ad44], which postulates that a lack of exposure to\ndirt in childhood may increase an individual's susceptibly to\nrespiratory illnesses, asthma in particular, and may explain\nthe high asthma prevalence observed for the high-income\nVietnam\nBurk Faso\nMyanmar\nMali\nLaos\nZimbabwe\nPakistan\nZambia\nGeorgia\nKenya\nGhana\nIvory Coast\nBangladesh\nMalawi\nCongo\na)\nMauritania\nComoros\nIndia\nSenegal\nChad\nAustralia\nPrevalence %\nSweden\nUK\nNetherlands\nNorway\nDenmark\nFinland\nFrance\nIreland\nBelgium\nGreece\nAustria\nLuxembourg\nSlovenia\nPortugal\nSpain\nSouth Africa\nGermany\nItaly\nUAE\nCroatia\nMalaysia\nSlovakia\nEstonia\nCzech Rep\nLatvia\nMauritius\nRussia\nOverall\nc)\nBrazil\nSwaziland\nDom Rep\nUruguay\nPhilippines\nParaguay\nSri Lanka\nUkraine\nNamibia\nTunisia\nTurkey\nMorocco\nBos Herz\nChina\nEcuador\nKazakhstan\nb)\nFIGURE 2.

Among low-income\ncountries, the influencing factors may be exacerbated by\npoorer access to healthcare.\nThe middle national income group was also distinguished by a\nhigh within-group range in prevalence of current wheezing\nsymptoms, while for diagnosed asthma, the within group range\nwas highest among the high-national income group. This\ndifference in within group range between diagnosed asthma\nand current wheezing symptoms may reflect the variation in\nreporting, as well as the disparity in access to healthcare and\ndisease information between countries, particularly within the\nnational income groups. For affirmative responses to diagnosed\nasthma, the participant had to have seen a physician and/or\nbeen taking asthma medications. Therefore, one would expect,\nas seen here, that asthma diagnosis questions would be more\nsensitive to country level of development (and hence access to\nmedical care) than the current wheezing symptoms questions.\nOne might also expect that the correlation between current\nwheezing symptoms and asthma diagnosis would vary by\nsocioeconomic and cultural differences, for which national\nincome may be a partial proxy. Country-level features, such as\naccess to healthcare, health literacy, willingness to report\nsymptoms and cultural differences in how breathing problems\nare labelled and understood, could all affect the ratio of current\nsymptoms to diagnosis of asthma. Consistent with this idea,\nthe country-level correlation between diagnosed asthma and\ncurrent wheezing symptoms was lowest in the middle-national\nincome group (Spearman's correlation coefficient: r50.37,\np,0.0001) and somewhat higher in both the low-national\nThe U-shape for the pattern of symptom prevalence across\ntertiles of GNI PPP seems to counteract the hypotheses that\nrelate increases in respiratory symptom prevalence to increased\nindustrialisation and, thus, increased national income [45\u00ad49].\nHowever, country level factors other than national level income,\nsuch as pollution levels (as in urban settings), may be far more\ninfluential in the association with respiratory symptom pre-\nvalence [13, 15]. Clearly, the prevalence of both symptoms and\ndiagnosis was quite high across urban regions regardless of\nnational income. It is likely that this U-shape pattern repre-\nsented a net effect of several different factors, with some\ncontributing to higher risk in low-income countries (occupa-\ntional hazards, pollution and poor access to healthcare) and\nothers tending to increase asthma risk and reporting in high-\nincome countries (pollution and greater awareness of asthma).\nFactors such as these may ``balance out'' in such a way that the\nmiddle-income countries have the lowest risks.\nA further challenge in data collection is that even in clinical\nsettings, asthma is not very well-defined [9, 13\u00ad16]. Physician\ndiagnosis varies greatly by country and many asthmatics are\nasthma also lead to difficulties in linking factors that may be\nassociated with asthma aetiology or exacerbation [1, 13\u00ad17].\nNevertheless, most surveys have found questions on wheezing\nWith these data, our analyses of the WHS presents an effort to\npresent information beyond that collected in other large\nrespiratory disease studies, such as ECRHS and ISAAC.\nConclusions\nThese WHS analyses have provided global estimates of wheez-\ning and doctor-diagnosed asthma prevalence using data that\nwere gathered concurrently, in a consistent and reliable fashion,\nacross a wide sample of countries. The patterns in these results\nsuggest different causes for self-reported wheezing and asthma\ndiagnoses in different socioeconomic contexts; there is a clear U-\nshaped pattern of disease prevalence across strata of national\nincome.
