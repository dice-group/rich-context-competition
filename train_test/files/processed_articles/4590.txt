Patients were assigned to one of the three treatment arms in Cycle 1; all patients\nreceived TIP in Cycle 2. Each cycle consisted of 28 days on and 28 days off the treatment.\nResults: A total of 60 patients [mean (standard deviation) age, 27.6 (8.4) years] were allocated\nto three treatment arms [TIS/TIP (n = 14); COLI/TIP (n = 28); TIP/TIP (n = 18)] in Cycle 1. The\nmean total administration time, which included device setup and cleaning, in Cycle 1 versus\nmin, and 4.2 versus 3.4 min, respectively. The difference in mean total administration time\nwas significantly shorter in Cycle 2 than in Cycle 1 for TIS/TIP (p = 0.0112) and COLI/TIP (p =\n0.0016) arms. Overall, 12 patients were found to have contaminated devices across the two\ntreatment cycles. In the TIP/TIP arm, no contamination of the T-326 inhaler was observed in\neither cycle. Treatment satisfaction, assessed by the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire\nfor Medication and ACCEPT\u00ae questionnaire, was better overall for TIP compared with TIS and\nCOLI. There were no unexpected adverse events and most were mild or moderate in intensity.\nConclusion: The T-326 inhaler used to deliver TIP was easy to use, required shorter total\nadministration time, and was much less frequently contaminated than the nebulizers. The\nsafety findings observed for TIP were generally consistent with its established safety profile.\n",

Furthermore,\nthe prevalence of microbial contamination of the\ndevices used was also compared in this study.\nMethods\nThis open-label, crossover, interventional, phase\nIV, 20-week trial was conducted at 22 centers in\nthe United Kingdom (8), Spain (5), Germany\n(4), Switzerland (3), and Ireland (2). The study\nprotocol was reviewed by an independent ethics\ncommittee/institutional review board for each\ncenter and was conducted according to the ethi-\ncal principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from\neach patient or their representative (parent or\nlegal guardian). CF patients aged 6 years with\nforced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1\n)\n25% to 90% predicted were recruited if they\nhad documented use of either COLI, TIS, or TIP\nfor at least one cycle, and two positive cultures for\nPa (either sputum, deep cough throat swab, or\nbronchoalveolar lavage), within the last 6 months.\nPatients with a current or past history of\nBurkholderia cepacia complex infection within\n2 years prior to screening, hemoptysis >60 ml\nwithin 30 days of Visit 2, serum creatinine level\n2 mg/dl, or a history of hearing loss or chronic\ntinnitus deemed clinically significant by the inves-\ntigator, were excluded from the study.\nStudy design\nThe study consisted of 6 visits (Figure 1(a)) over\n20 weeks. Patients were assigned to one of the\nthree treatment arms: COLI/TIP, TIS/TIP, or\nIn Cycle 1, patients in the COLI/TIP arm received\nnebulized COLI, 1 or 2 million units two or three\ntimes per day depending on local treatment\nguidelines for 56 days (no off-treatment period),\nadministered using the patient's usual nebulizer,\nand patients in the TIS/TIP arm received nebu-\nistered using the patient's usual nebulizer,\nfollowed by 28 days off treatment. In Cycle 2 of\nthese two arms, and in both Cycles 1 and 2 of the\nTIP/TIP arm, patients were treated with TIP,\ndays followed by 28 days off treatment.\nThe three inhaled antibiotics were compared with\neach other with respect to ease of use in Cycle 1\nin a real-world setting. Cycle 2 allowed the direct\nassessment of the `switch experience' from nebu-\nlized antibiotics to TIP. The study was open-label\nas blinding the delivery device for TIP was not\nfeasible, because a double-dummy design would\nhave imposed a great burden on the patients for\nthe feasibility of the study and conflict with meas-\nurement of the primary endpoint (ease of use).\nEfficacy and patient-reported outcomes\nEase of use was measured by the mean cumula-\ntive time required to administer study treat-\nments, including device setup/preparation, drug\nadministration, and device cleaning (including\ndisinfection, where applicable). The readiness of\nuse of the study treatment was assessed as the\nsum of the time of start to the time of comple-\ntion of delivery device preparation and the time\nof start to the time of completion of study treat-\nment preparation. In addition, patient's satisfac-\ntion and acceptance of the treatment were\nassessed14 by using the Treatment Satisfaction\nQuestionnaire for Medication (TSQM) and\nChronic Treatment ACCEPTance (ACCEPT\u00ae)\npleted the questionnaires by themselves in their\nlocal language in a quiet setting, and patients\nJ Greenwood, C Schwarz et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tar 251\naged <13 years completed the questionnaires\nwith the assistance of their parents or guardians.\nA patient preference survey was also conducted\nto evaluate the patients' experience in switching\nfrom COLI or TIS to TIP.\nMicrobial contamination of the delivery device\nwith Pa and other pathogens was analyzed in\nterms of light, moderate or heavy growth. The\nminimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of\ntobramycin and other selected antibiotics for Pa\nisolated from patients' specimens was assessed.\nThe other efficacy measures evaluated were\nchange in sputum Pa density (log10\ncolony-form-\ning units (CFU)/g sputum), changes in clinical\nlaboratory results and lung function [FEV1\n,\nforced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expira-\n)].\nThe delivery devices used by CF patients were\nassessed for microbial contamination and swabs\nwere collected from four locations on the nebulizer\nFigure 1.

This resulted in approxi-\nmately 13\u00ad33 min of time saving per administra-\ntion with the T-326 inhaler used for TIP\ncompared with nebulizers used for TIS and\nCOLI. Ease of T-326 inhaler use for administra-\ntion of TIP and reduction in administration time\nhave been associated with improved adherence\nand clinical outcomes.6 In general, treatment sat-\nisfaction, as assessed by TSQM and ACCEPT\u00ae\nquestionnaires showed better results for TIP,\nwith higher scores for `convenience' and greater\nacceptance for TIP, although there were decreases\nin scores reported in Cycle 2 compared with\nCycle 1 in some of the domains for both the\nTSQM and ACCEPT\u00ae questionnaires. These\npatient-reported outcome measures were sup-\nported by the shorter cumulative administration\ntime for TIP and a comparable efficacy profile as\nreported in other studies.11 Furthermore, when\nassessing the patient's preference of inhaled ther-\napy, the majority of patients showed either\n`strong' or `somewhat' treatment preference for\nTIP in the TIS/TIP and COLI/TIP arms over the\nnebulizers, which emphasizes the ease of use of\nTIP over other nebulized drugs.\nSeveral published studies have described frequent\ncontamination of home nebulizers with microor-\nganisms and reported that Pa constitutes the\nmajor contaminant.2,8 In the present study, the\nmajority of pathogens were isolated from the neb-\nulizer used to administer COLI in Cycle 1. The\nmicrobial contamination assessment suggested\nthat the T-326 inhaler used for TIP was much\nless frequently contaminated, thus potentially\nreducing the sources of infection in CF patients\ncompared with the nebulizers used for TIS or\nCOLI. These results advocate the use of T-326\ninhaler over nebulizers.\nConsistent with previous studies,11,12 sputum Pa\ndensities decreased in all the treatment arms.\nAlthough the mean FEV1\n% predicted at the end\nof the on-treatment period in Cycle 1 showed a\ndecrease in the TIP arm, and increases in the\nCOLI and TIS arms, the mean FEV1\n% predicted\nby the end of the on-treatment period in Cycle 2\nremained stable across the three arms. Overall,\nTIP showed comparable efficacy with TIS and\nCOLI, which is in accordance with previous\nIn addition, this study demonstrated that AEs\nwere comparable in all three treatment arms and\nno unexpected safety events were reported.\nAlthough cough is a common AE with inhaled\ntherapies,25,26 a clear trend was observed in the\ndecreased frequency of post-inhalation cough\nover time from Cycle 1 to Cycle 2 in the TIP/TIP\narm. Moreover, most cough events were of mild\nor moderate intensity in all the arms. Overall, TIP\nwas well tolerated and the safety findings observed\nfor TIP in this study were generally consistent\nThese results provide clinicians with further guid-\nance on the relative differences between the speed\nand ease of use of inhalers and nebulizers as well\nas evidence on the prevalence of microbial con-\ntamination of the inhalation devices in the real-\nworld setting. However, this was an open-label,\nnon-randomized study, which carries the risk of\nreporting bias, particularly for the patient-\nreported outcomes. In addition, data on the neb-\nulizer type were not collected, and therefore,\nresults are applicable to nebulizers in general but\nnot necessarily to any specific nebulizer.\nConclusions\nIn summary, the T-326 inhaler used to deliver\nTIP showed significantly shorter administra-\ntion and cleaning times compared with nebuliz-\ners used for COLI and TIS, suggesting that\nTIP is easy to use in CF patients treated for\npulmonary Pa infection. Ease of use was also\nsupported by the outcomes of the TSQM and\nACCEPT\u00ae questionnaires. Furthermore, the\nT-326 inhaler was much less frequently con-\ntaminated than the nebulizers, thus potentially\nreducing the sources of pathogenic bacteria in\nCF patients. In addition, this study provides\nfurther evidence on the efficacy of TIP as shown\nby the sustained suppression of Pa and stability\n% predicted.\n"
