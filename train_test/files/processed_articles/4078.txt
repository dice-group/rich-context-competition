As a consequence of the Cold War, American\nconservatives developed the reputation for being hawkish,\nyet military adventurism is not, nor ever has been, a prereq-\nuisite conservative value in America. Therefore, this essay\nwill explore the different approaches to foreign policy seen\nwithin the conservative big tent and examine the likely future\nof the hawks. Although intellectuals behind the different\nschools of thought will be discussed, the focus will be on the\nattitudes of politicians and grassroots conservatives. Some of\nthese intellectuals, particularly the realists, do not necessar-\nily identify as \"conservative,\" but they must be discussed as\nthey have influenced conservative foreign policy.\nSince the time of Reagan, American conservatives have\nbeen successful when they have been able to build a \"big\ntent.\" This essay need not rehash the already well-researched\nhistory of the making of this \"conservative big tent\" but will\nfocus on the present state of it as it pertains to foreign policy.\nThe \"conservative big tent\" referred to in this essay, there-\nfore, is the coalition of various foreign policy preferences\nthat have been welcome in the conservative movement from\nthe time of Reagan to the present. The conservative, in any\ncontext and any culture, seeks to conserve a set of values and\na way of life. For the conservative interventionist, war is not\nfought simply for the sake of war. Rather, if there is a per-\nceived threat to conservative values that require military\nintervention, the conservative will support it out of necessity.\nIt is important, therefore, to understand the debate over this\nnecessity within the conservative movement, to better under-\nstand conservative foreign policy in America.\nThe neoconservatives, the most hawkish in the conserva-\ntive big tent, have come to dominate conservative foreign\npolicy over the last decade, despite the Cold War being long\nover. Some in the conservative big tent argue that neoconser-\nvatives are not genuine conservatives. Although this essay\nwill not seek to answer that question, this debate will be con-\nsidered for the purpose of understanding these internal dis-\nputes within the conservative movement. Either way,\nneoconservatives have been a crucial to the conservative\nmovement at least since the Vietnam era, particularly on for-\neign policy. Although neoconservatives have been incredibly\nresilient and defied many predictions of their decline, their\nfuture prospects within the \"conservative big tent\" seem\n1Florida State College, Jacksonville, FL, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nRichard Wagner, Adjunct Professor of Political Science, Florida State\nCollege, Jacksonville, FL, USA\nEmail: professorwag@gmail.com\nThe Decline of Military Adventurism\nin the Conservative Big Tent: Why\nGrassroots Conservatives in the United\nStates Are Embracing a More Cautious\nForeign Policy\nRichard Wagner1\n Keywords\nconservatives, neoconservatives, military, realism, non-intervention, isolationism, war, hawks, doves, American Foreign Policy\n2 SAGE Open\ngrim at the moment. Like most social movements in the\nUnited States, the grassroots supporters of the conservative\nmovement are absolutely crucial to its direction, and there-\nfore the foreign policy preferences of grassroots conserva-\ntives will be carefully examined in this essay, particularly\ntoward neoconservative foreign policy. Given decades of\nneoconservative peaks and troughs, it would be irresponsible\nto predict certain doom for the neoconservatives as some lib-\nertarians have. However, neoconservatives are at least in a\ntrough since the wind down of the occupation of Iraq, and\nthey do not seem to be able to resonate with grassroots con-\nservatives as effectively as they did a decade ago, though the\nrecent ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) threat could\ncause grassroots conservatives to remain hawkish.\nThe Spectrum of Doves and Hawks in\nthe \"Conservative Big Tent\"\nTo argue simply that conservatives are either \"doves\" or\n\"hawks\" would create a false dichotomy. It is more accurate\nto break conservatives into roughly four categories: non-\ninterventionists, cautious realists, hawkish realists, and neo-\nconservatives. The two opposite ends of the spectrum are\nidealists in that they approach foreign policy with more nor-\nmative values, whereas the two realist approaches mainly\ndisagree over some of the consequences of power politics.\nThis spectrum varies with other ideologies and political\nmovements, but the conservative big tent can be effectively\ncategorized into these four groups. Nearly all self-identified\nconservatives in America fit somewhere into this spectrum.\nSince the Reagan era, they have become mostly locked in the\nRepublican Party and all in their own way value American\ninterests first. They all value American sovereignty and have\nlittle to no interest in the United States being a mutual partner\nin a larger \"global community.\" Most grassroots conserva-\ntives are probably not familiar even with the four terms men-\ntioned above, much less the intellectuals behind them.\nHowever, grassroots conservatives and Republican politi-\ncians alike hold such persuasions.\nThe non-interventionist (often of a libertarian-conserva-\ntive persuasion) usually contends that enemies of the United\nStates are so because they have been provoked. They con-\ntend that Al-Qaeda, for example, attacked on September 11,\n2001, in response to the strong U.S. military presence in the\nMiddle East. As Ron Paul so famously said in a 2008\nPresidential Debate, \"They don't come here to attack us\nbecause we're rich and we're free. They attack us because\nwe're over there\" (Ron Paul, 2007, Republican Presidential\nDebate). These non-interventionists were largely exiled from\nthe conservative big tent during much of the Bush adminis-\ntration, but they have been slowly welcomed back due in part\nTea Party, which has re-mobilized grassroots conservatives,\nemerged initially as a Ron Paul movement in 2007 but\nbecame a major force early into Obama's presidency with the\nbacking of conservative opinion leaders and funds.\nRegardless of what happens to the Tea Party itself, these\nPaulite-libertarians have grown substantially over the last 5\nyears, particularly with younger conservatives.\nThe cautious realists are often on the same side of foreign\npolicy with the non-interventionists, but for very different\nreasons. Realists will commonly reject the non-intervention-\nist view that other people and other nations will only be a\ndanger to us if we harm them. This would completely ignore\nthe balance of power that is at the core of realist foreign pol-\nicy. However, a cautious realist will usually avoid direct\nmilitary intervention, believing that military adventurism is\nimprudent. Cautious realists certainly support a strong\nnational defense, believing that enemies need not be pro-\nvoked to wish us harm, but that they will not cause us harm\nif it is not in their best interest. Unlike the strict non-interven-\ntionists, the cautious realists recognize the balance of power\nin international politics. Nuclear proliferation is certainly\ncompatible with this philosophy, as no two nuclear powers\nhave ever gone to war with each other directly. There have\nbeen many proxy wars, such as the infamous Vietnam War,\nbut never a direct war between two nuclear powers. Cautious\nrealists also are more likely than non-interventionists to sup-\nport military intervention to aid an ally, or to contain a rival\ngreat power. Presidents Reagan and Bush Sr. relied on this\napproach to foreign policy to contain and ultimately defeat\nthe Soviet Union, and to liberate Kuwait and weaken\nHussein's Iraq. Due to Reagan's popular status in the mem-\nory of nearly all American conservatives, there has been sig-\nnificant debate over Reagan's foreign policy legacy. Given\nthe context of the Cold War, however, and the clear opportu-\nnities Reagan had to call for more significant military adven-\nturism, Reagan's foreign policy was a cautious one. . Pat\nBuchanan seems to sway between isolationism and this kind\nof cautious realism. His recent views on ISIS, focused on\ncontainment and limited U.S. involvement, fit well into this\ncautious realist category (Buchanan, 2014). Many war weary\ngrassroots conservatives also fit here as well.\nThe non-interventionists and cautious realists make up\nthe dovish wing of the conservative big tent. It is made up of\nlibertarians, paleoconservatives, and center-right pragmatists\nsuch as Senator Tom Coburn. Although their reasoning dif-\nfers, they usually prefer non-intervention. The intervention-\nists are likewise divided into an idealist and realist wing.\nThe hawkish realists share a pragmatic view of the world\nwith their cautious counterparts. Hawkish realists are equally\naware of power politics and are constantly concerned with\nthat power balance. However, hawkish realists believe that\nfrequent displays of military prowess are necessary to ensure\nbalance. Although they view frequent military intervention\nas wise and prudent, they do not believe that the United\nStates can effectively \"make the world safe for democracy\"\nthrough military adventurism. Hawkish realists believe that\nthere are constant threats overseas that must be pacified, for\nthey are likely to attack in time if left to develop freely.\nHenry Kissinger easily fits into this \"hawkish realist\" cat-\negory. He was a supporter of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and\ndespite a few minor criticisms of some of President George\nW. Bush's tactics, he has maintained his position since that\ntime. Although more cautious realists believe that nuclear\nwarheads make war less likely due to the extremely high\ndeath toll of destruction of entire cities, Kissinger (2001) is\nfar more concerned:\nNuclear weapons have rendered war between countries\npossessing them less likely--though this statement is unlikely to\nremain valid if nuclear weapons continue to proliferate into\ncountries with a different attitude toward human life or\nunfamiliar with their catastrophic impact. (p. 23)\nIn contrast, non-interventionists and cautious realists\nalike believe that even if Iran, for example, develops nuclear\nwarheads, they will not use them as the rest of the world\nwould unite against Iran and dismantle the entire regime. The\nhawks would rather not take that chance on Iran's\nrationality.\nAmong grassroots conservatives, much of the \"Palinite\"\nwing of the Tea Party movement also fits into this hawkish\nrealist school of thought. Few of them, including Sarah Palin,\nhave any interest in \"policing the world,\" but eagerly support\nthe \"war on terror\" and maintain a significant U.S. military\npresence in the world. Much of the Republican Party in\nCongress can also favors a hawkish realist foreign policy,\nincluding Newt Gingrich, Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins,\nand so on. These are mostly post\u00adReagan era Republicans\nwho have supported maintaining a strong national defense\nand U.S. military presence in the world, but typically stop\nshort of believing that the United States can impose indefi-\nnitely its own moral principles on the world. However, they\nare quick to use military force on perceived threats, whereas\nthe cautious realists are more likely to weigh the costs and\nprefer containment.\nRealist foreign policy is always rooted in skepticism of\nthe ability of states to implement any significant normative\nagenda due to a firm belief that the realities of power politics\nwill always render such efforts futile. Therefore, realists\nacross the spectrum will inevitably reject the possibility of\nany lasting world peace and consider such efforts to be coun-\nterproductive. Hence, in their view, the world will never truly\nbe \"safe for democracy.\"\nWhatever neoconservatives may say of Woodrow Wilson,\nthey seem to share his view that the might of the U.S. mili-\ntary can \"make the world safe for democracy.\" Although\nneoconservatives share the hawkish realist support for fre-\nquent military intervention, they have the far more ambitious\ngoal of maintaining an unrivaled U.S. global hegemony.\nSome neoconservatives, such as Charles Krauthammer,\nembrace elements of realism as well. Krauthammer has\ndescribed himself as a \"democratic-realist,\" and much of his\ntone echoes classic realism. His views on the danger of\nemerging \"weapons states,\" for example, are compatible\nwith Henry Kissinger's concerns mentioned earlier. However,\nneoconservative efforts to impose an international order,\neven if unilaterally determined by the might of the United\nStates, are incompatible with centuries of realist thought on\nforeign policy since the time of Klemens von Metternich.\nessay, that \"[o]ur best hope for safety . . . is an American\nstrength and will--the strength and will to lead a unipolar\nworld, unashamedly laying down the rules of world order\nand being prepared to enforce them\" (p. 33). Krauthammer\nrepresents a neoconservative goal that is very ambitious and\nunlikely, but, like the realists, avoids the kind of abstract\nmoral justifications offered by the standard bearers of post\u00ad\nCold War neoconservativism. Bill Kristol and Robert Kagan\nhave a similar view to Krauthammer that \"American hege-\nmony is the only reliable defense against a breakdown of\npeace and international order\" (Kristol & Kagan, p. 22,\n1996). However, they also have a clear normative agenda, as\nfollows:\nIn the 1990s conservatives have built their agenda on two pillars\nof Reaganism: relimiting government to curtail the most\nintrusive and counterproductive aspects of the modern welfare\nstate, and reversing the widespread collapse of morals and\nstandards in American society. But it is hard to imagine\nconservatives achieving a lasting political realignment in this\ncountry without the third pillar: a coherent set of foreign policy\nprinciples that at least bear some resemblance to those\npropounded by Reagan. The remoralization of America at home\nultimately requires the remoralization of American foreign\npolicy. For both follow from Americans belief that the principles\nof the Declaration of Independence are not merely the choices of\na particular culture but are universal, enduring, self-evident\ntruths.That has been, after all, the main point of the conservatives\nwar against a relativistic multiculturalism. For conservatives to\npreach the importance of upholding the core elements of the\nWestern tradition at home, but to profess indifference to the fate\nof American principles abroad, is an inconsistency that cannot\nhelp but gnaw at the heart of conservatism. (Kristol & Kagan, p.\nNeoconservatism has long been difficult to reconcile with\nmany conservative core values. Bill Kristol and Robert\nKagan made the case for this rather effectively, as seen\nabove. However, the cost of constant military intervention\nclearly clashes with fiscal conservatism, as the U.S. budget\nover the last century has never been balanced during a full\nscale war. The assumption of a universal desire for democ-\nracy neoconservatives is difficult to reconcile with the pref-\nerence for tradition and global diversity held by most\nconservative intellectuals. Furthermore, military interven-\ntion has drastic consequences for the culture of the nation\nengaged, inevitably expands the size and scope of govern-\nment, and thus clearly rattles the preference for status quo\nand gradual, incremental change preferred by more\n4 SAGE Open\ntraditional conservatives, and even neoconservatives on\ndomestic policy. This is to be expected, as neoconservatives\ndid not so much embrace the conservative label initially as\nthey had it thrust upon them. Doves in the \"New Deal\nCoalition\" were labeling them \"neoconservatives\" long\nbefore Irving Kristol decided to embrace the label.\nConservatives, led by Reagan, welcomed neoconservatives\ninto the then-emerging conservative big tent, primarily due\nto mutual anti-communism. Neoconservatism should have\nbeen a victim of its own success when the Soviet Union col-\n2005, the conservative movement was dominated by neocon-\nservatives and hawkish realists. Max Boot was somewhat\ncritical of realist-conservatives but still seemed to accept\nthem as fellow conservatives. Leading up to Operation Iraqi\nFreedom, for example, Boot noted that these realists \"believe\nthat we should remove, or at least disarm, Saddam Hussein,\nbut not occupy Iraq for any substantial period afterward\"\n(Boot, 2002). He was referring in particular to Henry\nKissinger's position. Boot (2002) was particularly dismis-\nsive of Pat Buchanan, however, sarcastically referring to\n\"Mr. Buchanan and his five followers.\"\nKeeping Neoconservatism Alive--The\nBush years\nTy Solomon closely examined the psychological effects of\nconservatives spent much of the 1990s first clarifying exactly\nwhat it meant to be a neoconservative after the fall of the\nSoviet Union and then on how to present their message in a\nway that would appeal to grassroots conservatives. These\ngrassroots conservatives usually have a realist view of the\nworld, shifting from borderline isolationism to hawkish real-\nism, depending on the circumstances. William Kristol and\nRobert Kagan were effective in tying their adventurous for-\neign policy preferences to traditional values held by both\nconservative thinkers and the grassroots. Solomon (2013)\nexplains how Kristol and Kagan appealed to human desire\nfor wholeness and something lacking.\nKristol and Kagan harken back to the days when Reagan, in their\nview, summoned US spiritual and military might, stared down\nthe Soviet Union, and won the Cold War for the side of freedom,\nand when Teddy Roosevelt inspired Americans to embrace their\nglobal responsibilities . . .The United States is missing something\nBy appealing to many classic American conservative sig-\nnifiers such as \"American exceptionalism,\" \"freedom,\" and\nso on, as well as a sense that America was losing something\nit once had, grassroots conservatives would be convinced to\nsupport a far more proactive United States than is intuitive\nfor them.\nIt is difficult to determine whether this psychological\nappeal was intentional by neoconservatives. This would\nrequire significant research focused solely on that question.\nSolomon was careful never to accuse the neoconservatives of\npurposefully manipulating grassroots conservatives through\npsychological trickery, and this essay will also avoid such an\naccusation. Solomon's analysis of the psychological impact\nof neoconservative rhetoric is still very helpful in under-\nstanding the neoconservative influence on foreign policy\nwithin the conservative big tent, and that is why it is refer-\nenced here.\nSolomon focused the much of the first half of his study on\nCharles Krauthammer's essay \"The Unipolar Moment.\"\nAlthough Krauthammer's essay was respected by academics,\nthe fear of weapons states could at best convince grassroots\nto take a more hawkish approach to realism. The Kristol/\nKagan appeal to American values, however, was one that\nwould resonate, as it tapped into the decades-old sentiment\nheld by many grassroots conservatives that America was los-\ning its values, and that this would result in a diminished\nnation for future generations of Americans.\ntheir message, but grassroots conservatives still had little\ninterest in military adventurism. Walter Russell Mead has\nstudied the Tea Party movement and the long tradition of\ngrassroots rightist populism in America. He traces this back\nto the time of Andrew Jackson, and labels this group of\nAmericans who now make up the conservative grassroots as\n\"Jacksonian.\" These Jacksonians, in an ideal world, would\nprefer an isolationist foreign policy. They love the American\nway of life and distrust foreigners. If these foreigners are not\na threat, they would rather simply avoid contact with them.\nThey have no desire, as the neoconservatives, to bring\ndemocracy to the rest of the world. However, \"when the\nUnited States is attacked, they believe in total war leading to\nthe unconditional surrender of the enemy\" (Mead, W. R,\n2011). If the Jacksonians, these grassroots conservatives,\ncould be convinced that spreading democracy abroad was\ncorrelative with American way of life, particularly security,\nthen they could be convinced to support more broad-based\nmilitary intervention and perhaps even nation-building, fear-\ning that they could not afford to do otherwise.\nity of nearly all Americans, particularly the Jacksonians, or\ngrassroots conservatives. For the neoconservatives, this reaf-\nfirmed their belief that global democracy was necessary for\nsecurity. The Jacksonians, as a result, were more receptive to\nthis ideal. The neoconservatives then sought to spread\ndemocracy by force to the Mid-East, with these terror attacks\nas their justification. The Jacksonians were primarily con-\ncerned with punishing the terrorists but rarely objected to the\nnation-building efforts of the neoconservatives. For the\nJacksonian, defeat of the enemy was what mattered, and as\nlong as that condition was met, they were willing to tolerate\nother policy goals with their allies.\nthe conservative big tent became increasingly small in terms of\nideas. Non-interventionists were exiled, paleoconservatives\nlike Pat Buchanan found unlikely allies from the left as he\nbecame an MSNBC commentator, and realists who opposed\nthe invasion of Iraq were marginalized. Ron Paul, the lone-\nstar non-interventionist in the House Republican Caucus at\nthe time, believed that if the United States pulled out of the\nIslamic world, groups like Al-Qaeda would have no reason\nto attack. President Bush, embracing a more neoconservative\nresponse to the attacks, argued that \"they hate our freedom\";\nhence, it was a war of ideologies rather than of power poli-\ntics. Although not all conservatives calling for war necessar-\nily believed in George W. Bush's idealistic explanation, they\ndid fully support the invasion of Afghanistan, and most fully\nsupported the invasion of Iraq, despite the lack of evidence\nfor Iraq's involvement with the 9/11 attacks. Bush did attempt\nto justify the invasion of Iraq by tying them to Al-Qaeda\n(Hayes, 2003). However, he focused most of his justification\non claims that Iraq was violating UN requirements for\nWMDs, and pointed to Hussein's poor human rights record.\nThe WMD argument convinced enough of the realists, and\nthe neoconservatives simultaneously harped the human\nrights argument. Some of the Jacksonians, culturally isolated\nand reactionary, likely believed that there were ties between\nHussein and Al-Qaeda for the simple reason that they are all\nIslamic and hostile to the United States. Most of them, how-\never, were knowledgeable enough to know that the entire\nIslamic world as a whole was not to blame for the 9/11\nattacks. For the majority of Jacksonians, their support for the\nwar in Iraq rested on the belief that Iraq was a significant\nthreat. As time passed, and no evidence of any usable WMDs\nwas found, the neocon\u00adJacksonian alliance began to frag-\nment. A growing number of conservative realists in Congress\nbegan to question Bush and the decision to invade Iraq, and\nsome of these realists would later embrace the Tea Party\nmovement. From 2006 to the present, we are seeing the costs\nof neoconservative foreign policy. Due to a growing national\ndebt as a percentage of GDP, and the clear philosophical con-\nflicts between small government rhetoric on domestic\npolicy and an ever expansive, unconstrained foreign\npolicy;neoconservatives are finding it more difficult to reso-\nnate with grassroots conservatives.\nBy 2006, the war in Iraq had become widely unpopular,\nand American voters punished the GOP by sweeping the\nDemocrats into power. To add insult to injury, the Democrats\nfound a Presidential candidate in 2008 with an Islamic name\nand an Islamic father. This is clearly not the reason that\nDemocrats nominated Obama, but it certainly agitated some\nof the remaining Jacksonian hawks. It was clear at this point\nthat a hawkish Bush era Republican platform simply could\nnot win. Despite John McCain's \"maverick\" opposition to\nBush on many issues, McCain was and is even more hawkish\nthan Bush. This was at least part of the reason that McCain\nlost in 2008. It is doubtful that Pat Buchanan or Max Boot\npredicted that libertarianism would open the flaps allowing\nthe doves to flock back into the conservative big tent, but we\nhave seen this happen in recent years with Ron Paul, the Tea\nParty movement, and the more pragmatic Rand Paul. Despite\nrecent fears of ISIS, we are not likely to see the calls for\nnation-building and putting \"freedom on the march\" from\nthe younger generation of conservatives. The national debt is\nfar too high, the military budget is bloated, and younger con-\nservatives can easily see the correlation between warfare and\ngovernment growth. Given the costly failures in Iraq, Libya,\nand Syria, just to name a few;grassroots conservatives,\nyoung and old, and likely to limit military intervention to the\nsuppression of immediate threats.\nThe Tea Party--Are Hawks Welcome\nHere?\nThe Republicans knew that if they wanted to win in 2010,\nthey needed to accomplish two goals: cripple Obama's popu-\nlarity and convince voters that the GOP is no longer the Bush\nparty. The hawks would spend the next several years focus-\ning on domestic policy, knowing that voters had no taste for\nwar. The first goal was met by overwhelming obstructionism\nin Congress, despite being outnumbered. Senate Republicans\nfilibustered nearly every bill attempted by the Democrats.\nThis strategy helped to re-mobilize conservative grassroots\nvoters, but elections are not won with the base voters alone.\nThe GOP needed to grow their support.\nThe time had come for Ron Paul and the non-interven-\ntionists to return from exile. Originally, the Tea Party had no\nmore love for Bush and mainstream Republicans than they\nhad for Obama. As they grew in number, public opinion of\nthe Tea Party movement became increasingly polarized. In\nMarch 2010, Gallup showed that of those polled throughout\nthe year, 37% had a favorable view of the Tea Party com-\npared with 40% who viewed them unfavorably (\"Tea Party\nMovement,\" 2014). They were controversial but had a strong\nbase of support. Some on the left attempted to find common\nground with the Tea Party, and President Obama reached out\nto them more than once seeking solutions to the debt crisis.\nThe Tea Party initially had the popularity they needed but not\nthe financial resources. Fortunately for them, the conserva-\ntive/libertarian establishment jumped on the opportunity.\nAs the 2010 mid-term elections came near, funds from\nwealthy contributors such as the libertarian Koch brothers\nbegan to pour into the coffers of different Tea Party groups.\nGroups such as \"Freedom Works\" supported the Tea Party\nmovement as well. Pundits of the conservative big tent, such\nas Rush Limbaugh, who despised Ron Paul, embraced the\nTea Party and simply ignored the movement's Paulite ori-\ngins. Ron Paul did not create the Tea Party, it simply formed\naround him. This is difficult to prove, as the movement was\nspurious and had not yet gained the attention of mainstream\nmedia. There is a video on YouTube, however, showing an\nearly Tea Party demonstration in 2007 in support of Ron\nPaul. In this rare footage, Ron Paul supporters were carrying\ncrates labeled with policies they opposed, to symbolically\ndump into the river (\"Ron Paul Rockford Tea Party,\" 2007).\n6 SAGE Open\nEarly in, Paul seemed to have a positive view of the move-\nment but never attempted to lead them. The movement\nbecame widely popular following the famous Rick Santelli\nrant in 2009 and, as a result, created the misconception that\nthis movement actually began with Santelli. For most,\nincluding Walter Russell Mead, this was an honest mistake.\nHowever, it clearly worked to the advantage of desperate\nhawks. If these hawks were to be welcomed into the Tea\nParty, they needed Ron Paul to be as far removed as\npossible.\nThe Tea Party groups accepted the large corporate dona-\ntions, but most of them kept to their libertarian-leaning prin-\nciples, criticizing corporate welfare just as fiercely as food\nstamps. Likewise, the massive military industrial complex\nwas perceived to be just as wasteful and bloated as every\nother function of government and needed to tighten its belt.\nAmy Kremer, leader of the Tea Party Express, was inter-\nviewed on the \"Colbert Report\" and solidly defended the\nprinciples of the Tea Party. She refused to support tax\nincreases under any circumstances and continued to argue\nfor across the board spending cuts. When pinned down, she\npointed to a particular spending cut that the military could\nmake, as an alternative to tax increases (Kremer, 2011).\nHowever, it is not Kremer's Tea Party Express or the Tea\nParty Patriots that were highlighted by the mainstream\nmedia. Sarah Palin represents good ratings for mainstream\nmedia, and solid ideology for rightist establishment media,\nmainly FOX. It was therefore in the best interest of most\nmainstream media sources to highlight Sarah Palin and the\n\"Tea Party Nation,\" even though the other Tea Party groups\nhave largely severed ties to this particular group, and Sarah\nPalin gets mixed reviews from Tea Party advocates.\nAs the Tea Party movement lacks unity and hierarchy, and\nmuch of the developments were at the grassroots level, it is\nhard to explain exactly how the Palinite hawks grew within\nthe movement. But it is likely that they simply started show-\ning up at Tea Party rallies, first only promoting ideas upon\nwhich they agreed, such as tax cuts, spending cuts, and any-\nthing anti-Obama. It is clear that as the 2010 mid-terms drew\nnear, an increasingly hawkish voice began to emerge from\nthe Tea Party. Some Tea Party candidates, such as Rand Paul\nand Mike Lee, continued to reject military adventurism.\nOthers, however, like Allen West and Marco Rubio, used Tea\nParty rhetoric, speaking of limited government and the dan-\ngers of national debt, while likewise promoting a very costly\nforeign policy of military adventurism. As anti-Obama senti-\nment held the Tea Party together, most did not even notice\nthat these new Tea Party candidates had more in common\nwith Bush Jr. and Palin than they did with Ron Paul and the\nearly libertarians who started the movement. The 2010 victo-\nries were at least a short term victory for hawkish conserva-\ntives. However, it was not long before the Tea Party's\npopularity declined, and disillusioned libertarians started\nlooking elsewhere. What remains of the Tea Party seems to\nbe focused on returning to their libertarian origins, particu-\nlarly the Tea Party Express, and they are crossing their fin-\ngers for a Rand Paul GOP nomination in 2016.\nNeoconservatives Now--Staying Alive\nPublic opinion polls still show that Republicans are divided on\ntheir support for U.S. military commitments overseas.\nFurthermore, \"Tea Party Republicans\" are slightly less likely to\nsupport reducing military spending than other Republicans and\nother Americans in general. Still, according to a Pew Research\nPoll, 55% of \"Tea Party Republicans\" supported reducing mili-\ntary commitments overseas in 2011 (Pew Research Center for\nthe People, 2011). It is a slim majority, but still a majority. So if\nthe majority is so slim, it may seem hasty to conclude that\nhawkishness is on an almost irreversible decline.\nOne must consider this 55% figure more carefully, how-\nmovement was increasingly made up of older, mostly\nCaucasian Republicans. The Tea Party was also declining in\nwhen it was more libertarian leaning and was propelling Rand\nPaul to the U.S. Senate in an uphill battle against an incum-\nbent Republican. It is difficult to prove cause and effect here,\nand this essay will not attempt to do so. However, it is undeni-\nable that younger Americans are far less favorable to military\nintervention than older Americans. Republicans, therefore,\nhave far more to gain in future elections by shifting to a less\naggressive foreign policy. As has already been explained in\nthis essay and many other essays before, the hawkishness of\nthe conservative movement was largely a result of the Cold\nWar. Still, with recent fears of emerging ISIS, it is likely that\npublic support for cutting military spending or commitments\noverseas has at least temporarily declined.\nGrassroots conservatives today have little reason to sup-\nport a neoconservative foreign policy other than lingering\nattitudes from the Cold War era. As tensions build with\nRussia over Ukraine and Crimea, neoconservatives such as\nJohn McCain remind fellow Republicans that Putin was once\na KGB agent. This red herring appeals to a generation that\nlived in fear of the Soviet Union. To Americans who grew up\nin the Reagan era or thereafter, it means very little. The 9/11\nattacks gave hawks a temporary resurgence, but the terror\nhas faded as can be seen by popular support for withdrawal\nfrom Afghanistan and Iraq. Realists across the spectrum are\nlikely to view future justifications for military intervention\nwith skepticism. Even Henry Kissinger (2014), though a\nconsistent supporter of Operation Iraqi Freedom, has admit-\nted that \"the standard set by many supporters and critics of\nthe Iraq effort alike--proved beyond what the American\npublic would support and what Iraqi society could accom-\nmodate\" (p. 325). Kissinger consistently rejected \"nation-\nbuilding\" efforts in Iraq, and it is likely that he and other\nhawkish realists will in future demand clearer and more lim-\nited goals when undertaking future military interventions\nthan will be to the liking of the neoconservatives.\nNeoconservatives will need to find a way to appeal to\nyounger generations if they are to endure as the baby boomer\ngeneration dies off. Furthermore, with soaring national debt\nand a weak economic recovery, fiscal realities will also be a\nmajor challenge for the neoconservatives to overcome.\nKrauthammer, in his famous essay \"The Unipolar Moment,\"\nargued that a strong military would be sustainable, but\nblamed tax cuts and growing entitlements for America's fis-\ncal woes (which were far less severe at that time in 1991). It\nwould be nearly impossible to convince Americans to sup-\nport tax increases or any significant entitlement cuts, how-\never, making it nearly impossible to avoid the over US$600\nbillion a year Defense budget, which is second only to Social\nSecurity in its annual cost.\nLibertarianism, with its rebellious appeal to conservative\nyouth, is likely to grow. It is, however, limited by its inflexi-\nbility on welfare spending and its foreign policy of total non-\nintervention. Most Americans do not want a full withdrawal\nof all U.S. troops from all parts of the world when there are\nclear threats emerging, such as rising China, ISIS, and Russia\nin the Ukraine. The poll mentioned earlier also shows that\ndespite the 55% support among \"Tea Party Republicans\" for\nreduced military commitments overseas, only 18% support\ncutbacks to military defense spending, indicating a shift\ntoward realism, rather than libertarian non-intervention. The\nChinese Communist Party (CCP) is clearly not as dangerous\nas was the Soviet Union, but the popular viewpoint accord-\ning to this poll and many others is that China must be con-\ntained. Realists have favored this approach for at least a\ndecade (Walt, 2011). Recently, this has begun to resonate\nwith the grassroots conservatives, due to the CCP's unscru-\npulous trade practices and their ally North Korea, which is a\nmenace to South Korea and Japan. Libertarians do not have\na solution to this, other than \"free trade,\" which they hope\nwill foster mutual prosperity followed by peace. A growing\nnumber of Americans oppose \"free trade,\" at least with\nChina, due to likely currency manipulation and reputation\nfor poor quality products. Libertarians will not be able to\nresonate with grassroots conservatives very effectively on\nforeign policy issues once these details are debated.\nThe neoconservatives lately have shown signs that they\nmight attempt a more centrist platform (Heilbrunn, 2009).\nJohn McCain has referred to the libertarian-Paulite wing of\nthe GOP as \"wacko-birds\" for their opposition to many anti-\nterrorist surveillance programs. Other prominent hawkish\nRepublicans, such as Lisa Murkowski and Kelly Ayotte,\nhave been very critical of the radical Tea Party wing. There\nis certainly a centrist void present in Congress, and the neo-\ncons may have an opportunity to sell their message to disil-\nlusioned centrist voters. It is likely that they are considering\nJeb Bush. Marco Rubio is also a possibility for them, though\nhe lacks the same \"moderate\" credentials. Whereas John\nMcCain represents the hawks of the GOP establishment, his\nformer running mate, Sarah Palin, represents the hawks of\nthe grassroots. Although Palin shows no interest in moving\nto the center, the establishment hawks may go this route,\nthereby building a new grassroots base. Many Paulites play\ninto the hawkish migration to the center by denouncing the\n\"moderate\" hawks as \"RINOs.\"\nThe neoconservatives have certainly made a significant\nimpact on the conservative big tent. They not only survived\ndecades beyond their life expectancy (end of the Cold War),\nbut they also had an incredible impact on U.S. foreign policy\nduring the Bush era. Thinkers of the 1990s predicted a neo-\nconservative demise with good reason, but the neocons have\npersisted. Consequently, I am hesitant in this essay to make\nwhat might be another failed prediction of neoconservative\ndecline. However, neoconservatives now find it very difficult\nto convince the rest of the conservative big tent that fiscal\nresponsibility, the American way of life, family values, pref-\nerence for tradition, and constitutionally limited government\nare compatible with a one-size-fits-all democratic model for\nthe world and the military industrial complex necessary to\nmaintain American unipolarity. The present and future con-\nservatives are likely to focus on fiscal responsibility and indi-\nvidual freedom. As social liberals inevitably progress on\nissues such as same-sex marriage, conservatives are shifting\ntheir focus from direct opposition to instead the protection of\nreligious freedom (Arana, 2013). This far more modest goal\nis to ensure that social conservatives do not lose their freedom\nto maintain their more traditional lifestyles in a socially pro-\ngressive future. This will require a culturally pluralist outlook\nthat clashes with the neoconservative one-size-fits-all world-\nview. Limited government at home is ever more difficult to\nreconcile with unlimited government abroad, and this new\ngeneration of conservatives, unclouded by the specter of\nSoviet communism, can afford philosophical consistency in\ntheir efforts to limit the size of government and place greater\nfaith in the innovation of free individuals and voluntary asso-\nciation. If neoconservatives are to have a future beyond the\nbaby boomer generation, they will either need to find a way to\nappeal to the more libertarian-leaning conservative youth or\nbranch out beyond the conservative big tent.\nConclusion\nThe main purpose of this essay is to show that American con-\nservative foreign policy is far more complex than commonly\ndepicted by mainstream media or certain irritable pundits.\nThe secondary objective of this essay is to explain how neo-\nconservatives have not only endured but also thrived after\nthe Cold War. Many did not expect this, even some neocon-\nservatives. During the Bush era, it appeared that neoconser-\nvatives were simply the standard bearers of conservative\nforeign policy, with a tolerated realist minority. However,\nother perspectives existed even then and have now re-\nemerged to the point where they must be understood by the\nGOP \"Old Guard\" and mainstream political culture. We will\nstill hear the terms right-winged or to the right commonly\nused in reference to a hawkish foreign policy for some time\n8 SAGE Open\nyet, as old habits die hard. However, the conservative tent\nhas become big again, at least for electoral necessity if noth-\ning else.\nIt is hard to say which, if any, of these groups will domi-\nnate conservative foreign policy in America in the near\nfuture. However, they are all at a point of influence now\nwhere they must be carefully considered when looking at the\nconservative movement and future GOP nominations.\nConservatives and their opponents alike would be well\nserved by understanding the complexities of the conservative\nbig tent. For hawkish conservatives, they must accommodate\ntheir tent-mates. For more dovish conservatives, particularly\nnon-interventionists, they must understand that the situation\nis far more complex than a simple black and white--neocon-\nservative versus \"real conservatives\" scenario. American\n\"liberals\" and Democratic opponents of the conservative big\ntent should consider that a more dovish conservative could\neasily blindside a hawkish Democratic candidate if party pri-\nmary voters and strategists take for granted the assumption\nthat conservatives are inevitably hawkish. Pre\u00adCold War\nconservatives were complex and disparate in their foreign\npolicy preferences, and such complexity has now returned to\nthe post Cold War conservative big tent.\nThe main purpose of this essay is to analyze the diversity\nof foreign policy within the conservative big tent and provide\na model for understanding these different policy preferences.\nThis has been achieved by showing how nearly all conserva-\ntives fit into at least one of these four categories: non-inter-\nventionist, cautious realist, hawkish realist, and\nneoconservative. These four categories provide a better\nunderstanding of conservative foreign policy preferences\namong grassroots conservatives, intellectuals, and politi-\ncians. The essay has shown, as others have before, that neo-\nconservative dominance of conservative foreign policy has\nbeen in decline since about 2006. It was necessary to re-\nassert this, as many still take for granted the perception that\nconservatives are hawkish. It has also been shown that there\nare both philosophical and pragmatic reasons for conserva-\ntives to reconsider the hawkish foreign policy for which \"the\nright\" has become synonymous in the last several decades. It\nis unlikely that the conservative big tent will retreat into iso-\nlationism, as some neoconservatives fear. Although this\nessay predicts a more cautious foreign policy preference\namong conservatives going forward, this is a far cry from\nisolationism. Most conservatives still want to maintain a\nstrong military, aid for U.S. allies, and beneficial trade rela-\ntions. Neoconservatives certainly can adapt to this environ-\nment, and given the short memory span of the younger\ngeneration, neoconservatives could find a way, yet again, to\nreturn to prominence.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nArana, G.
