    "abstract": "Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience, the study of brain-behavior relationships, has long\nattempted to map the brain. The discipline is flourishing, with an increasing number of\nfunctional neuroimaging studies appearing in the scientific literature daily. Unlike biology\nand even psychology, the cognitive neurosciences have only recently begun to apply\nevolutionary meta-theory and methodological guidance. Approaching cognitive\nneuroscience from an evolutionary perspective allows scientists to apply biologically based\ntheoretical guidance to their investigations and can be conducted in both humans and non-\nhuman animals. In fact, several investigations of this sort are underway in laboratories\naround the world. This paper and two new volumes (Platek, Keenan, and Shackelford\n[Eds.], 2007; Platek and Shackelford [Eds.], under contract) represent the first formal\nattempts to document the burgeoning field of evolutionary cognitive neuroscience. Here,\nwe briefly review the current state of the science of evolutionary cognitive neuroscience,\nthe methods available to the evolutionary cognitive neuroscientist, and what we foresee as\nthe future directions of the discipline.\n1 All editorial decisions regarding this article were made by Associate Editor David Barash\nEvolutionary cognitive neuroscience\n",

In its simplest form, evolutionary cognitive neuroscience is the\nmerging of the fields of evolutionary psychology and cognitive neuroscience using\nmethodology from both disciplines and guidance from evolutionary meta-theory. In this\ncoalescence, the identification of neural substrates of psychological adaptations is\nparamount. A recent volume (Platek, Keenan, and Shackelford, 2007) presents the first\ncomprehensive overview of this emerging discipline, which is briefly reviewed here (see\nalso Platek and Shackelford, under contract). This article consists of three major sections:\n1) historical antecedents to and current state of evolutionary cognitive neuroscience, 2) a\nbrief introduction to methods available to the evolutionary cognitive neuroscientist and\npossible implementations of such methodologies, as well as references to more\nsophisticated texts on each methodology, and 3) future directions for the discipline.\nAntecedents to Evolutionary Cognitive Neuroscience\nCognitive neuroscience without evolution\nLike pre-Darwinian psychology and other social sciences, cognitive\nneuroscience without evolution will have difficulty accurately describing the functional\nworkings of the human mind. The number of articles appearing in journals such as The\nJournal of Cognitive Neuroscience, Cognitive Brain Research, Brain, Neuron,\nNeuroscience, Social Neuroscience and the Journal of Neuroscience answering questions\nabout brain-behavior relationships is staggering. What is more astounding, however, is the\ndearth of articles that present the results of evolutionarily-informed research or interpret the\nresults from an evolutionary perspective.\nA cognitive neuroscience approach to ultimate questions without evolutionary\nmeta-theoretical guidance makes little sense, about as much sense as psychological science\nwithout evolutionary meta-theoretical guidance. This is not to say that proximate questions\ncannot be answered by cognitive neuroscience alone. For instance, these methods have\nbeen instrumental in providing culturally relevant information for understanding the brain\nsystems implicated in reading disabilities (Price, 2005). However, an evolutionary\nperspective provides a structure from which to guide empirical investigations and\nhypothesis generation about brain-behavior relationships.\nPsychological mechanisms, domain specificity, and domain generality\nEvolutionary psychology assumes that an evolved psychological mechanism (and\nits corresponding neural substrates) is an information-processing module that was selected\nduring a species' evolutionary history because it reliably produced behavior that solved a\nEvolutionary cognitive neuroscience\nparticular adaptive problem (Tooby and Cosmides, 1992). Evolved psychological\nmechanisms are understood in terms of their specific inputs, decision rules, and outputs\n(Buss, 1995). Each psychological mechanism evolved to take in a narrow range of\ninformation--information specific to a particular adaptive problem. The information (or\ninput) that the organism receives signals the adaptive problem that is being confronted. The\ninput (either internal or external) is then transformed into output (i.e., behavior,\nphysiological activity, or input relayed to another psychological mechanism) via a decision\nrule--an \"if, then\" procedure.\nTooby and Cosmides (1992) suggested that the causal link between evolution and\nbehavior is made through psychological mechanisms. The filter of natural selection\noperates on psychological mechanisms that produce behavior. Natural selection cannot\noperate on behavior directly, but on the genes associated with the neural substrates that\ngenerate the psychological mechanisms that produce the behavior. Williams (1966) noted\nsimilarly: \"The selection of genes is mediated by the phenotype [psychological\nmechanism], and in order to be favorably selected, a gene must produce phenotypic\nreproductive success [adaptive behavior]\" (p. 25).\nThe majority of psychological mechanisms are presumed to be domain-specific.\nThe mind is comprised of content-dependent machinery (i.e., physiological and\npsychological mechanisms) that is presumed to have evolved to solve specific adaptive\nproblems. Psychological mechanisms can also be expressed as cognitive biases that cause\npeople to more readily attend to some pieces of information relative to others. This\npresumption of domain-specificity contrasts with the traditional position that humans are\nendowed with domain-general learning or reasoning mechanisms that are applied to any\nproblem regardless of specific content (e.g., Atkinson and Wheeler, 2004). A system that is\ndomain-general or content-independent, however, is a system that lacks a priori knowledge\nabout specific situations or problem domains (Tooby and Cosmides, 1992). Such a system,\nwhen faced with a choice in a chain of decisions, must select from all behavioral\npossibilities (e.g., wink, jump, remember father, smile, point finger, scream). This problem\nof choosing among an infinite range of possibilities when only a vanishingly small subset\nare appropriate has been described by researchers in artificial intelligence, linguistics, and\nother disciplines (see Tooby and Cosmides, 1992, for a review).\nNot only are there theoretical arguments against a content-independent system,\nmyriad evidence for domain-specificity comes from, among other areas, evolutionary\npsychological research (e.g., Cosmides, 1989; Cosmides and Tooby, 1994; Flaxman and\nSherman, 2000; Pinker and Bloom, 1990), cognitive research (e.g., Hirschfeld and Gelman,\n1994), studies of animal learning (e.g., Carey and Gelman, 1991; Garcia, Ervin, and\nKoelling, 1966), clinical neurological literature (e.g., Gazzaniga and Smylie, 1983;\nRamachandran, 1995; Sergent, Ohta, and MacDonald, 1992), and most recently the arena\nof functional neuroimaging (e.g., Platek et al., 2005; Takahashi et al., 2006). Practitioners\nof evolutionary psychology note that relatively domain-general mechanisms that function,\nfor example, to integrate and relay information between domain-specific mechanisms likely\nexist (e.g. attentional systems, anterior cingulated cortex, fluid intelligence, prefrontal\ncortex, etc.), but the vast majority of mechanisms are presumed to be domain-specific.\nSome of the controversy surrounding the relative domain-specificity of the mind\nseems to be rooted in the use of the term domain. Psychologists frequently used the term to\nrefer to particular domains of life, such as the mating domain, kinship domain, and\nEvolutionary cognitive neuroscience\nparenting domain. Subsequently, many have assumed that labeling a mechanism as\ndomain-specific restricts the proposed mechanism to a particular domain, and if evidence\ncan be garnered to show that the mechanism functions in more than one domain (e.g., the\nmating domain and the kinship domain), then it is taken as evidence for the domain-\ngenerality of the proposed mechanism. This, however, is incorrect. A domain, when\nreferring to a psychological mechanism, is a selection pressure, an adaptive problem\n(Cosmides and Tooby, 1987). Domain, then, is synonymous with problem. A domain-\nspecific mechanism refers to a problem-specific mechanism--a mechanism that evolved to\nsolve a specific adaptive problem. Although evolutionary and cognitive psychologists use\nthe term domain-specific, perhaps some confusion could be avoided if the more accurate\nterm problem-specific were employed. Although some psychological mechanisms operate\nacross different domains of life (e.g., face recognition, working memory, processing\nspeed), they still solve specific problems. Working memory, for example, solves the\nspecific problem of holding information in the mind for a brief period of time. It has been\nsuggested that evolutionary and cognitive psychologists might be better off avoiding these\ncontentious labels and simply describing the proposed mechanism and its function\n(personal communication, D. M. Buss January 2005).\nUnlike early psychologists and behavioral scientists (e.g., Skinner, Watson) who\nenvisioned organisms as \"blank slates\" capable of making an infinite number of\nassociations, evolutionary meta-theory is beginning to shed light on this flawed theoretical\napproach to behavior analysis (see Barkow, Cosmides and Tooby, 1992; Buss, 2005;\nCosmides and Tooby, 2005). In fact, many of the emerging studies are contending directly\nwith this \"standard social science model\" of psychology; i.e. that organisms posses one or\nmore general-purpose learning mechanisms and that \"biology\" plays little role in the\nmanifestation of behavior. Examples of some of the first psychological studies to\ndemonstrate that learning was not mediated by so-called general-purpose learning\nmechanisms were published several decades ago and mark what might be referred to as the\nbeginning of evolutionary thinking in psychology and a contributing factor to the\n\"cognitive revolution.\"\nIn his landmark study, Garcia (Garcia et al., 1966) discovered that animals learned\nto avoid novel food products that made them ill in as little as one learning/conditioning\ntrial--something that had not been demonstrated with any other stimulus class previously.\nLabeled conditioned taste aversion, this effect describes an adaptive problem that has since\nbeen demonstrated in almost every species tested (the exception to this rule appears to be\nCrocodilians, see Gallup and Suarez, 1987). This adaptation serves an important\nfunction--don't eat food that makes you ill or you might not survive to reproduce; i.e.\nbeing ill could result in a number of fitness disadvantages such as death, inability to avoid\npredation, inability to search and secure mates, and loss of mate value.\nIn a similar discovery, DaSilva, Rachman, and Seligman (1977) demonstrated what\nhe referred to as prepared learning. Prepared learning is a phenomenon in conditioning and\ncan occur rapidly because of putative biological predispositions. For example, it has been\ndemonstrated that it is much easier for humans (and animals) to form conditioned\nemotional responses--in this case, associative fear responses--to evolutionarily-relevant\nthreats such as snakes, insects, and heights than to present-day threatening but\nevolutionarily novel stimuli. In other words, it is easier to condition humans to develop a\nfear of snakes, spiders, and heights than it is to condition a fear of guns, cars, and knives.\nEvolutionary cognitive neuroscience\nThese studies demonstrated that psychological traits, similar to the design of bodily\norgans, were crafted by evolutionary forces that allowed our ancestors to survive. The\ninformation-processing mechanisms designed to deal with such situations as poisonous\nfood or potential threats to survival evolved as part of our ancestors' recurrent experience\nwith such situations. These studies refute a key premise of the standard social science\nmodel--there is no general-purpose learning mechanism. Rather, learning is a consequence\nof carefully crafted mechanisms dedicated to solving specific evolutionary problems (see\nefficient problem-solvers and the problems they are designed to solve are those that our\nancestors recurrently faced over human evolutionary history.\nAlthough domain-specificity seems to be the prevailing theoretical model of the\nbrain in evolutionary psychology, we note that there is also support for the existence of\ndomain-general mechanisms in areas of cognition and learning. Chiappe and MacDonald\n(2005) argue that the domain-general approach explains how humans may solve novel\nproblems and employ novel strategies to old recurrent problems; whereas the theory of\ndomain-specificity does not. Contrary to the claim that humans would have an infinite\nchoice of problem solving strategies without a module to guide them, Chaippe and\nMacDonald (2005) suggest that we have evolved motivational systems that provide\npositively or negatively charged cues to aid in novel problem solving. They criticize the\ndefinition of adaptation put forth by Tooby and Cosmides (1992) because it includes\n\"recurrence\", implying that there can be no adaptations to deal with novel problems. Their\nrevised definition of adaptation is as such, \"an adaptation is a system of inherited and\nreliably developing properties that became incorporated into the standard design of a\nspecies because it produced functional outcomes that contributed to propagation with\nsufficient frequency over evolutionary time\" (Chiappe and MacDonald, 2005, p.11).\nExamples of general intelligence and innovative problem solving can be seen in\nanimals as well as humans. For instance, common ravens (Corvus corax) can solve\nproblems that have not been part of their evolutionary environment. Henrich (2000)\ndesigned a study where ravens had to use novel techniques to get food from a string.\nResults showed that the ravens were able to solve this novel problem to get the food, not\nthrough trial and error, but through putative \"insight.\" Furthermore, Anderson (2000)\ndiscovered that rats were able to combine the steps from separately learned tasks to solve a\nproblem. Research with humans has bolstered the argument for domain-free capabilities.\nUsing measures of working memory capacity such as mathematical processing and a\nreading span task Turner and Engle (1989) discovered that scores on these tasks predicted\nreading ability. These results indicate that working memory may include domain-specific\nand domain-general mechanisms involved in several distributed processing tasks (Kane,\ndevised a theory that incorporates domain-specificity and general intelligence by\ndifferentiating between primary biological abilities and secondary biological abilities. The\nprimary abilities include language and simple quantitative abilities; these are domain\nspecific. Secondary abilities, such as reading and mathematics, use these primary ability\nmodules in a general way to solve novel problems. Geary states, \"Success at these\nbiologically secondary abilities is strongly correlated with general intelligence\" (as cited by\nChiappe and MacDonald, 2005, p. 17). Modules are critical for learning and problem\nEvolutionary cognitive neuroscience\nsolving, but domain-free mechanisms are key in employing information from the modules\nto solve new original problems (Chiappe and MacDonald, 2005).\nFear acquisition has been used to support the theory of domain-specificity, as some\nfears (evolutionarily relevant fears) are easily acquired and not easily extinguished (\u00d6hman\nstimuli without any evolutionary significance can \"gain control of the fear system\"\n(Chaippe and MacDonald, 2005, p.28). Results showed that participants demonstrated\nsuperior conditioning to a gun stimulus paired with a loud noise, than to snake stimuli. The\nextinction rate of the gun stimuli and the snake stimuli, when both were followed by a\nshock, was equal. Furthermore, there is evidence of two fear processing systems in the\nbrain. Fear is traditionally associated with amygdala activation, especially evolutionary\nrelevant fear stimuli; however, the hippocampus is activated when individuals are exposed\nto aversive unfamiliar stimuli. \u00d6hman and Mineka (2001) suggest that the hippocampal\nactivation allows the subject to take in all available information from the environment in\norder to better understand and assess the aversive stimuli.\nThe social brain hypothesis argues that the brain (especially the higher primate\nbrain) has evolved to its present form as a result of selection pressures imposed by the very\nsocial nature of the primate group structure (Dunbar, 2007; Jolly, 1969 as cited by Dunbar,\nlearning systems in humans are domain general in the critical sense that they allow us to\nbenefit from the experience of others, even when their behavior was not evolutionarily\nrecurrent in the EEA but is effective in achieving evolved goals in the current environment\"\n(2005, p. 33). Several studies have demonstrated that social learning is not confined to\nhumans. Rats observing conspecifics attaining food have in turn employed the observed\ntechnique to obtain food (Heyes, Dawson, and Nokes, 1992). Parrots have also been able to\nsocially learn non-species specific behaviors without reinforcement (Moore, 1996). Social\nlearning among primates \"coevolved\" with increased size of the executive functions,\nincreased innovative ability, as well as tool use (Reader and Laland, 2002). Chiappe and\nMacDonald claim that these findings buttress the argument for social learning having\nincreased importance as species employ innovative solutions through processes such as\nworking memory, fluid intelligence, and executive function, which are the foundations of\ngeneral intelligence.\nEvolutionary time lags and the environment of evolutionary adaptedness\nBecause evolution is an excruciatingly slow process, modern humans and their\nminds are designed for earlier environments of which they are a product. Our minds were\nnot designed to solve many of the day-to-day problems of modern society but, instead,\nwere designed to solve the recurring problems of our evolutionary past. Examples of\nevolutionary time lags abound: our difficulty in learning to fear modern threats, such as\nguns and cars, and our near effortless learning to fear more ancient threats, such as snakes\nand spiders (DaSilva, Rachman, and Seligman, 1977; \u00d6hman and Mineka, 2001) children's\nease in learning biologically primary mathematic abilities, such as counting, and their\ndifficulty in learning biologically secondary mathematic abilities, such as arithmetic\n(Geary, 1995); women will not concede to intercourse indiscriminately even though\nmodern contraception can greatly minimize the reproductive costs associated with\nintercourse; our preference for sugar and fat was once adaptive due to their scarcity, but has\nEvolutionary cognitive neuroscience\nnow become maladaptive. These few examples illustrate that our modern behavior is best\nunderstood when placed in the context of our environment of evolutionary adaptedness.\nThe environment of evolutionary adaptedness (EEA) is not a place or time in\nhistory but a statistical composite of the selection pressures (i.e., the enduring properties,\ncomponents, and elements) of a species' ancestral past--more specifically, the adaptations\nthat characterize a species' ancestral past (Tooby and Cosmides, 1990). Each adaptation\nevolved due to a specific set of selection pressures. Each adaptation, in principle, has a\nunique EEA, but there likely would have been overlap in the EEAs of related adaptations.\nTooby and Cosmides (1990) and other evolutionary psychologists, however, use\n\"Pleistocene\" to refer to the human EEA because this time period, lasting 1.81 to 0.01\nmillion years ago, was appropriate for most adaptations of Homo sapiens.\nAlthough our evolutionary past is not available for direct observation, the discovery\nand description of adaptations allows us to make inferences about our evolutionary past,\nand the characterization of adaptations may be the most reliable way of learning about the\npast (Tooby and Cosmides, 1990). Some adaptations provide unequivocal information\nabout our ancestral past. Our cache of psychological mechanisms associated with\nnavigating the social world tells us that our ancestors were a social species (e.g., Cosmides,\nTrivers, 1971). A multitude of psychological mechanisms associated with cuckoldry\navoidance tell us that female infidelity was a recurrent feature of our evolutionary past\n(Buss, Larsen, and Westen, and Semmelroth, 1992; Buss and Shackelford, 1997; Goetz and\nSome adaptations, however, do not make clear (at least upon first inspection) their\nlink with our ancestral past. There exists, for example, a mechanism present in the middle\near of all humans that is able to reduce sound intensity by as much as 30 decibels in 50\nmilliseconds. The attenuation reflex, as it is known, acts by contracting muscles that pull\nthe stirrup away from the oval window of the cochlea, preventing strong vibrations from\ndamaging the inner ear. The attenuation reflex meets the characteristics of an adaptation\n(e.g., economic, efficient, reliable), yet it is not obvious what selection pressures drove the\nevolution of this adaptation. What specific noises did our ancestors recurrently hear that\nwould create this noise reducing mechanism? That the muscles appear to contract as we are\nabout to speak suggests that our own loud voices might have been the impetus for this\nadaptation. Moreover, sound attenuation is greater at low frequencies than at high ones\n(and humans speak at low frequencies), also suggesting that ululating was a recurrent\nfeature of our evolutionary past. Thus, from discovering and describing adaptations, we can\ntentatively characterize aspects of our evolutionary environment.\nThis is not to be taken to indicate, however, that the aim of evolutionary psychology\nis to make inferences about the past. Evolutionary psychology is not post hoc storytelling;\nits practitioners often use a deductive approach, moving from theory to data. Evolutionary\npsychologists make predictions derived from hypotheses based on middle-level theories--\ne.g., Trivers's (1972) parental investment theory--then collects data to test their\npredictions. For example, Buss et al. (1992) tested the hypothesis proposed by Symons\n(1979) and Daly, Wilson, and Weghorst (1982) that the sexes would differ in their reactions\nto a romantic partner's sexual and emotional infidelity. Buss and his colleagues did not\nhappen to collect the appropriate data, analyze the results, and develop a post hoc\nexplanation for what they observed. Furthermore, claims of adaptations are typically stated\nEvolutionary cognitive neuroscience\nas tentative until the proposed adaptation has undergone rigorous hypothesis testing (see\nSchmitt and Pilcher, 2004). The inductive approach, however, should not be disregarded.\nMoving from data to theory is a common practice in all scientific enterprises (e.g.,\ncosmology, geology, and physics) and is known as \"explanation\" (Tooby and Cosmides,\nCognitive neuroscience with evolutionary theoretical guidance\nWhy do we need another discipline? Why is the ECN approach important? Without\nevolutionary meta-theoretical guidance, cognitive neuroscience will fail to describe with\nanything but superficial accuracy the human (and animal) mind. Cognitive neuroscience\nwill simply explain proximate mechanisms (i.e., the \"how\") of brain-behavior relationships\n(most often using theoretical models derived from standard social science models). This is\nonly half the equation. This approach misses the ultimate (i.e., \"why\") questions of brain-\nbehavior relationships. By adopting the ECN approach and directly addressing ultimate\nquestions about brain-behavior relationships, scientists will be in a position to better\ndescribe the cognitive processes and the neural correlates that they investigate. Likewise,\nwithout cognitive neuroscientific methods, evolutionary psychology may not be able to\nadequately describe and understand the neurophysiological mediators to psychological\nadaptations, and hence may never be able to accurately describe the evolved nature of the\nhuman mind. Without \"peering\" into the brain with techniques such as modern functional\nneuroimaging, evolutionary psychological investigations can only describe the cognitive\nprocessing of human mental characteristics. Evolutionary psychology can describe\nfunction, but is limited in its description of structure, and thus has no ability to relate\nfunction to structure, which might be important, especially in comparative investigations of\ncognitive evolution. The relationship between structure and function is inherently a\nproblem of evolutionary biology; i.e. the genes that give rise to brain structure and its\ncomponent nuclei and modularity, as well as its ability to process information, were the\ncombined units of selection. The need for an integrated science of the mind that utilizes\nevolutionary meta-theoretical guidance to cognitive neuroscientific investigations is\noverdue, but beginning to flourish.\nRecently, application of evolutionary meta-theory has been applied directly to\ninvestigations of the cognitive neuroscience kind. For example, O'Doherty and colleagues\n(2003; see also Winston et al., 2007) have begun to investigate neural correlates of facial\nattraction. O'Doherty et al. discovered that the orbitofrontal cortex appears to be activated\nwhen a person finds a face attractive, which suggests that facial attractiveness activates a\nreward or approach system in the brain. These findings have recently been extended\n(Winston et al., in press) to reveal a more distributed network of activation in the anterior\ncingulate cortex (ACC), superior temporal sulcus, and amygdala in response to evaluations\nabout attractiveness. Additionally, activation in the ACC and amygdala appear to be sex-\ndependent, showing increased activation in men only. These areas also are activated when\nmales are asked to imagine (Takahashi et al., 2006) or observe (Rilling, Winslow, and\nKilts, 2004) their mate engaging in infidelity, which suggests that appraisals of\nattractiveness of females by males is related to their decisions about fidelity and paternal\ncertainty (see Shackelford, Pound, and Goetz, 2005, for review). This work is currently\nbeing extended to investigate the role of the menstrual cycle in perceptions of attractiveness\namong female participants. Patel and Platek (in preparation) employed the new functional\nEvolutionary cognitive neuroscience\nneuroimaging technology, functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), to investigate\nwomen's perception of attractiveness as a function of the menstrual cycle while varying\nmale facial symmetry and masculinity. These findings reveal an interaction between\nperceptions of attractiveness and the menstrual cycle; i.e. women prefer symmetrical and\nmasculine men more during the period of ovulation. Additionally, these data show that the\nprefrontal reward centers (PFC) parallel this behavioral response; i.e. women display\nactivation of primarily left ventromedial PFC to symmetrical and masculine males during\nthe period of the estrous cycle when they are at greatest likelihood of conception and the\nopposite pattern when not at high likelihood of conceiving. Together these data suggest\nthat 1) there are sex differences in the neural processing of attractiveness that might be\nrelated to evaluations about paternity and sexual fidelity and 2) that in women, activation\nappears, at least in part, dependent on hormonal state.\nFurther, Baron-Cohen and colleagues (e.g., 1985, 2001) have been instrumental in\nidentifying the presence of a neural module dedicated to processing socially-relevant\ninformation (see also Frith and Frith, 1999). Baron-Cohen et al. demonstrated that the\nability to conceive of others' mental states appears to be 1) a highly modularized\nneurocognitive process and 2) specifically affected by certain neuropsychiatric pathologies,\nnamely autism (also schizophrenia, see Irani et al., 2007; Platek and Gallup, 2002).\nPatients with autism (and schizophrenia) appear to have deficits in social cognition,\nindependent of deficits in general intellectual functioning. These data suggest that the\ncapacity for social cognition is circumscribed and modularized and thus can be negatively\naffected independent of negative consequences in other cognitive domains. Several\nneuroimaging studies have supported the notion of a modularization of social cognition\n(e.g., Focquaert et al., unpublished data; den Ouden, Frith, Frith and Blakemore, 2005;\nIn an explicit test of an evolutionary psychological theory and follow-up to several\nbehavioral studies, Platek et al. (2004, 2005) employed functional magnetic resonance\nimaging (fMRI) to investigate sex differences in perceptions of children's faces as a\nfunction of facial resemblance. In two studies, they discovered that men, but not women,\nshowed activation in left and medial prefrontal regions of the brain when viewing self-\nresembling child faces. This finding is suggests that 1) men display an approach strategy\ntowards children who share facial resemblance with them (e.g., Davidson, Putnam, and\nLarson, 2000) and 2) men might inhibit a generalized negative response pattern, or\navoidance phenotype, toward children unless the child shares facial resemblance.\nPerhaps the most exciting application of neuroscientific methods to evolutionary\ntheory has been done in studies empirically testing modularity. Neuroscientific methods\nsuch as fMRI can subject theories and claims to rigorous falsification attempts. A very\nconvincing set of psychological experiments demonstrating evolved structures dedicated to\nsocial interaction and exchange have come from studies conducted by Cosmides, Tooby,\nand their colleagues. By modifying a logic problem known as the Wason Selection Task to\nreflect evolutionarily important social interactions (e.g., cheater detection), Tooby,\nCosmides, and colleagues have demonstrated that the human mind appears to have evolved\na cheater detection mechanism that is extremely efficient. They have provided\nneurological evidence for a cheater detection mechanism by showing that one can incur\nimpairment (i.e., brain trauma) to performance on cheater detection problems but remain\nrelatively unimpaired on other types of problem solving. Their data suggest that parts of\nEvolutionary cognitive neuroscience\nthe limbic system are implicated in the ability to detect cheaters in social interactions\n(Stone, Cosmides, Tooby, Kroll, and Knight, 2002).i\nDomain-specificity research continued as Dehaene, Piazza, Pinel, and Cohen\n(2003) examined whether the human brain has evolved with a certain \"predisposition to\nrepresent and acquire knowledge about numbers\" (p.487). They used behavioral data,\nneuropsychological evidence, and fMRI to investigate three parietal circuits for number\nprocessing. They discovered that the horizontal intraparietal sulcus (HIPS) region,\nassociated with activation during mental arithmetic and number representation, is the most\nlikely candidate for a domain-specific module. As a follow up, Shuman and Kanwisher\n(2004) tested whether or not this module was involved in nonsymbolic number processing.\nThey hypothesized that if the HIPS were a module specific to the representation and\nprocessing of numbers then the following would be true. First, symbolic and nonsymbolic\nnumber tasks (greater than vs. less than) would show activation in the HIPS. Second,\nNumerical tasks should engender greater activation in the HIPS than non-numerical\ndifficulty-matched tasks. Results failed to support the hypothesis. There was not significant\nbrain activation evidence to provide support for the existence of a domain specific cortical\nregion in the parietal lobe dedicated to the processing of symbolic and nonsymbolic\nnumbers.\nThese new investigations--applying cognitive neuroscientific methods to answer\nhypotheses posed from an evolutionary theoretical perspective--are bringing forth a new\nunderstanding of how the mind and brain evolved. In fact, these new research programs\nare re-casting much psychological research conducted through the 20th century into the\nECN perspective.\nFoundations for an evolutionary cognitive neuroscience and directions for future research\nA formal discipline of evolutionary cognitive neuroscience demands the integration\nof several branches of psychology, biology, and anthropology, including, but not limited to:\ncomparative neuroscience; archeology, physical anthropology, and paleoneurology;\ncognitive primatology; evolutionary psychology; and cognitive, social, clinical, and\naffective neuroscience. In other words, the foundation of ECN is interdisciplinary in\nnature. The discipline has been synthesized in a recent edited volume published by the\nMIT Press (Platek, Keenan, and Shackelford, 2007). What is apparent from the\nformulation of this volume is that for ECN to survive as a discipline, collaborations across\ndisciplines are going to be necessary, and the chapters presented in Platek, Keenan, and\nShackelford (2007) highlight this fact. We do not aim to replicate the contents of that\nvolume here, but for purposes of illustration we have reviewed some of the chapter\ncontents and themes. One will notice the application of Tinbergen's (1963) four \"Why's\"\nand proximate/ultimate dichotomy weaved throughout. This ethological framework is\nessential to the survival of ECN in that this framework forms the basis for examination of\nall behaviors from a biological perspective.\nOntogeny of brains and brain size\nThe prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, parietal cortex, and striatum seem to be the\nkey brain substrates underlying many of the complex cognitive processes in humans. How\ndid these structures evolve, allowing humans to supercede the cognitive processes of other\norganisms, especially when it comes to the noted cognitive capacities? Finlay and\nEvolutionary cognitive neuroscience\nDarlington (1995) contend that neurogenesis is strongly related to relative need for\nstructure; i.e. size of a neural substrate will be determined by the organism's need for that\nsubstrate for survival and reproductive maximization strategies. Stone (2007) extends this\nthesis by suggesting that natural selection acted on two factors--neuron number and\nconnectivity--to build brains with more complex cognitive capabilities. These theories\ncomplement each other. It has been reported that 96% of brain structure size is predicted by\nthe sizes of the surrounding structures (Finlay and Darlington, 1995). Neurogenesis impacts\nbrain structure, and given that humans have a longer period of prenatal development, more\nneurons are able to form. Finlay and Darlington surmise that natural selection could have\nacted on the brain through neurogenesis, but with large correlations between neighboring\nbrain structure sizes, longer gestational period subsequently allows for the entire brain to\nbecome larger. This parallels Stone's neurogenesis hypothesis.\nAlthough Finlay and Darlington, as well as Stone, show concurring and supporting\nevidence for the aforementioned theory of mammalian brain evolution, Barton and Harvey\n(2000) (also see Clark, Mitra and Wang, 2001, for a review) argue for a mosaic approach to\nbrain evolution. Barton and Harvey found highly significant correlated volumetric\nevolution relationships within well documented functionally related brain systems. Thus\nthey conclude that mammalian brain evolution implicated size changes focused in\nparticular structures and functional systems.\nHemispheric asymmetry, specialization, and handedness\nOne of the most remarkable commonalities between human and nonhuman\nprimates is brain lateralization, which is implicated in language, spatial abilities, and\nhandedness in humans and may exist in rudimentary forms in non-primates. Annett's\n(1985) right-shift theory of handedness is a well documented theory of genetic inheritance\nof handedness in humans. New research is beginning to show that non-human primates\nmay posses a hand preference, which begets the question of whether handedness is related\nto hemispheric specialization of cognitive capacities. Hemispheric specialization may be an\nevolutionary step towards the modularity of higher cognitive processes in humans.\nHopkins (2007) has been leading the investigation in handedness among non-human\nprimates. Using a paradigm called the TUBE test; he examined handedness among\nnonhuman primates and discovered lateralized processing in non-human primates,\nespecially in chimpanzees. This, he suggests, lends support to the hypothesis that\nchimpanzees might also possess lateralization of other important brain functions (e.g.,\nBox 1: Unanswered research questions about the neural correlates of brain size\ndevelopment\n\u00b7 Are developmental constraints responsible for a coordinated size change\namong individual brain components?\n\u00b7 Did natural selection act on behavioral capacities thus causing selective size\nchanges? These are not new questions. How can we use evolutionary\ncognitive neuroscience to test these hypotheses?\n\u00b7 Throughout evolution why did the neocortex increase in surface area, but not\nin thickness? How is the radial unit hypothesis relevant?\n\u00b7 How did social group size and social interactions impact evolution of cortical\nsize and complexity?\nEvolutionary cognitive neuroscience\ncommunication and spatial abilities). One noteworthy and inexplicable finding illustrated\nthat chimpanzees in captivity tended to exemplify handedness, whereas chimpanzees in the\nwild did not (McGrew and Merchant, 1997). Evolutionary developmental psychologist,\nBjorklund (2006), uses data from great apes and argues that, \"...our last common ancestor\nchimpanzees likely had the behavioral plasticity and sociocognitive precursors to modify\ntheir behavior and cognition via maternal effects toward a more human-like intelligence\"\n(p.213). Perhaps the chimpanzees in captivity, as they are reared in a human influenced\nenvironment, tend to show increased levels of handedness due to this interaction with\nhumans, who do show a very distinct preference for handedness.\nUsing Annett's (1985) theory many studies have illustrated that handedness is\nheritable. Hopkins also attempts to demonstrate a genetic expression of handedness in\nchimpanzees, but discovers that there is not a significant relationship between handedness\nin the offspring and maternal or paternal handedness. A study of handedness and birth\norder indicated that in middle-born offspring there is significant heritability of handedness\n(Hopkins and Dahl, 2000: Hopkins, Dahl and Pilcher, 2000). The significance of these\nfindings for cognitive evolution is yet unknown, but under close scientific scrutiny.\nReproduction and kin selection: Social control of reproductive efforts and success\nAre there common neurobiological mechanisms shared among animals? While fish\nseem like unusual subjects of study for evolutionary cognitive neuroscience, according to\nFernald (2007), species such as fish are valuable vertebrates to study because they present\napplicable models for sensory systems, brain organization, and motor outputs. Fernald's\n(1977) research with African cichlid fish (Astatotilapia [Haplochromis] burtoni)\ndemonstrates the interaction between social context and reproductive behavior and how this\ninteraction shapes the brain. African cichlids are territorial. Territorial males (T males)\nhave bold coloring and have control over a specific domain. This domain is enticing for\nnonterritorial male (NT) cichlids because it is only in these domains where food is\navailable. NT males are therefore camouflaged and colored similarly to females to allow\nthem to purloin food from T cichlid's domains. Fraley and Fernald (1982) discovered that\nif T males are reared in a group they develop at a slower rate than T males reared alone.\nNot only are T males reared in isolation larger in body size, but also the size of their gonads\nBox 2. Unanswered research questions about the relationship between\nhandedness and the evolution of higher cognition that is hemispherically\nspecialized.\n\u00b7 What is the relationship between domestication/enrichment/culture and\nhandedness among human populations? Are there epigenetic influences on\nhandedness and if so, what are they?\n\u00b7 What are the ultimate benefits of handedness to an individual and within\npopulations and how does this affect brain formation? Why is handedness\nheritable in middle born offspring and not others in the birth order?\n\u00b7 What is the relationship across species between handedness and other\nlateralized brain functions?\n\u00b7 What is the relationship between the evolution of handedness and the\nevolution of social cognitive (e.g., self-face recognition, theory of mind)\nprocesses that are highly lateralized in humans?\nEvolutionary cognitive neuroscience\nis larger. Fernald suggests that this is a function of having no competition for resources or\nsurvival. Other findings include the difference in body size, which is dependent on whether\ncichlids are raised with brood mates or with adult males (Davis and Fernald, 1990). When\nmaturing among adult males, gonad growth and size is suppressed compared to those\nreared without adult males around. One of the most fascinating discoveries of the\ninvestigation of cichlids is the remarkable change in brain structure as a function of social\nenvironment. In the brain of all vertebrates there are gonadotrophin releasing hormone\n(GnRH) neurons which guide reproduction. Fernald discovered that GnRH neurons are\neight times larger in T males as compared NT males (Davis and Fernald, 1990). Can the\nsize of the GnRH neurons in the brain change depending on social environment? The\nanswer appears to be yes. Moving T males into a group with larger T males, the smaller\nfish become NT males. Conversely, introducing NT males into a group of smaller NT\nmales, the larger males become T males. In examining the brains of these fish (pre- and\npost-environmental change), it is evident that the size of the GnRH neurons increases in the\ndominant fish after just four weeks in their new environment. Change in social status was\ninfluential enough to change GnRH neuron size in the brain of cichlids. This change was\nevident in adolescents and adults (Francis, Soma and Fernald, 1993).\nNeural correlates of love, attachment, and mate choice\nWhen we talk about romantic love it is common for people to generally reference the\nheart. But, it is the brain, not the heart that is the set of romantic attachment, love, and lust.\nThere appear to be distinct interconnected neural networks that govern the motivational and\nreward systems involved in romantic love (e.g., Aron, et al., 2005; Winston et al., in press).\nIt is a complex system based upon very specific neurochemical relationships in the brain;\nand therefore, this system becomes vulnerable when other chemicals are introduced. Fisher\nand Thomson (2007) have investigated the potential harmful effects of serotonin-enhancing\nantidepressants. Serotonin enhancing anti-depressants can interfere with oxytocin,\nvasopressin, and dopamine in the brain producing an array of effects including emotional\nblunting, decreased obsessive thoughts about a loved one, suppression of loving feelings,\naltered feelings of attachment, lowered sex drive, as well as inability to experience orgasm\nand fertility complications. Many of the aforementioned symptoms are essential to the\ndevelopment of a romantic relationship. Ultimately, Fisher and Thomson (2007) have\nargued that antidepressants interact with the natural neurobiological correlates of attraction\nand attachment and thus have detrimental effects on one's ability to form a stable pair-bond\nnegatively impacting one's ability to \"signal genetic and psychological fitness.\" The\nBox 3. Unanswered research questions about the evolutionary importance of\nneuroendocrine interactions.\n\u00b7 What is the relationship between territoriality and sperm competition\nmechanisms? This type of investigation could lead to discoveries about the\nneural mechanisms involved in territoriality as well as sperm competition in\nhumans.\n\u00b7 Do these same mechanisms exist across species and in humans?\n\u00b7 Are there effects of social group organization on neural correlates of\nterritoriality?\nEvolutionary cognitive neuroscience\nimpacts of these findings are interesting to consider in today's society where anti-\ndepressants and other such drugs are unreservedly prescribed.\nSocial Cognition: Mind reading and self-awareness\nThe study of the evolution of social cognitive mechanisms and self-awareness in\nhumans and non-human primates is contentious and represented by several different\ncompelling evidence for the capacity of mind-reading in rhesus macaques, a capacity\npreviously thought to exist only in humans and great apes. The findings of her work may\nserve to expand our understanding of the phylogenetic distribution of neurobiological\nmechanisms involved in such capacities. These data are contrary to the thesis put forth by\nGallup (1982) that only those organisms that could learn to recognize themselves could\nlater develop a sense of other, or theory of mind (see Focquaert and Platek, 2007). The\nemerging data from cognitive neuroscience suggests that Gallup's hypothesis is at least in\ncolleagues (e.g., 2001, 2003,) have been instrumental in developing this model using\nmodern functional neuroimaging technologies and patient populations (see also Irani et al.,\nin press). It appears that the neural substrates involved in self-recognition, namely the\ninferior frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobe in the right hemisphere are integral to the\ndevelopment of an internal self-representational system. These substrates appear also to be\ninvolved in processing the mental states of others (e.g. see, Platek et al., 2004, Northoff and\nBermpohl, 2004). Additionally, in participants who are inefficient at social cognition, these\nsubstrates are recruited differently (e.g., Focquaert et al., in preparation; Platek et al.,\nabout modular deficits in neuropsychiatric patients, namely patients within the autistic\nspectrum disorders, and suggest that these patient populations represent an instance of\nspecific modular deficit in mind reading and self-processing and might invoke assortative\nmating for such traits along a systemizing and empathizing quotient.\nBox 4.

How do variances in 5-HT levels\nimpact fitness?\n\u00b7 What are the specific neural correlates of lust and sexual excitement? Could\nresearch using portable brain imaging devices be used to measure neural\nactivation during foreplay, sexual intercourse, and post-copulatory\nbehaviors?\n\u00b7 Are there neural correlates impacted by absorption of chemicals from sperm\npost-copulatory?\nEvolutionary cognitive neuroscience\nMethods available to the evolutionary cognitive neuroscientist\nIn addition to traditional cognitive psychological methodology that typically\nemploys dependent variables such as reaction times, performance (e.g., Schutzwohl and\nKoch, 2004), decision judgment tasks (e.g., Singh et al., 1993), and implicit cognitive\nresponses to stimuli (e.g., Thomson et al., under review), evolutionary cognitive\nneuroscience employs methods that allow direct measurement of brain activation (i.e., brain\nelectric and magnetic responses and neurovascular responses), deficits in functioning\namong patients with specific lesions and/or neurocognitive impairments, and direct\nstimulation of the brain (e.g., TMS). Each of these methodological approaches or\ntechniques offers their own degree of trade-off between potential for ecological validity and\nlevel of intrusion or obtrusiveness (Simpson and Cambell, 2005). We discuss each of these\nbelow.\nMeasuring brain activation\nThere are currently two main ways in which brain activation can be measured--\ndirectly using magnetoencephalography (MEG) or electroencephalography (EEG), and\nindirectly by measuring the blood oxygen-dependent neurovascular response using\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, or diffuse optical\nimaging. MEG and EEG essentially measure changes in the electrical potential of\nunderlying neuronal populations. These techniques, thus, represent a relatively direct\nmeasurement of brain electromagnetic activity. Both techniques provide excellent temporal\nresolution, allowing researchers to plot the time course of stimulus or event evoked\nactivity. The two techniques, however, differ drastically in several ways that can be\noptimized by the evolutionary cognitive neuroscientist appropriately. MEG, while\nproviding as good temporal resolution as standard EEG using event-related potentials\n(because it measures the changes in magnetic energy of neurons), also provides fairly\naccurate spatial resolution and an easier solution to the inverse problem. This implies that\nMEG has the ability to provide information about the time course of neuronal activation\nand a relatively close approximation of the localization of such activation. The drawback\nto MEG is that it is significantly more expensive to purchase and maintain (on the order of\n5-10 times as expensive). On the other hand, EEG systems are relatively inexpensive\npreparation necessary to setup an experiment. For a high-density EEG measurement\npreparation time can be as long as 1.5-2 hours. This obviously draws from the experiment\nBox 5. Unanswered research questions about the evolution of social cognition.\n\u00b7 What introspective based social strategies (deception, intentionality, belief,\ndesire, and pretense) are driven by the evolution of self-awareness and theory\nof mind?\n\u00b7 How exactly do social prostheses (Kosslyn, 2007) and the mirror neuron\nsystem interact with the evolution of language, spatial cognition, and self-\nother action understanding?\n\u00b7 Does one have to be self-aware to employ social prostheses?\n\u00b7 Using the new techniques designed by Santos et al., can other animals (e.g.,\noutside the primate phyla, e.g., Corvids) be shown to demonstrate self-\nprocessing capacities?\nEvolutionary cognitive neuroscience\nby reducing participant motivation, increasing participant frustration, and limiting\necological validity. However, a new generation of mobile EEG/ERP systems are being\ndeveloped, which rely on advances in electrode technology and wireless transmission of\ndata. This is an obvious advantage to the evolutionary cognitive neuroscientist because it\nnow allows measurement in ambulating participants.\nThe other major techniques for observing brain activation include those\ninvolved in measuring the indirect blood oxygen-dependent level (BOLD) neurovascular\nresponse or regional cerebral blood flow and include functional magnetic resonance\nimaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and diffuse optical\nimaging/functional near infrared spectroscopy (DOI/fNIRS). Because PET utilizes\nradioisotopes it is not typically employed outside of the clinical domain for reasons of\nsafety; i.e. participants are exposed to radiation in order to measure regional cerebral blood\nflow (rCBF). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as the \"gold\nstandard\" in cognitive neuroimaging and is used in hundreds of laboratories around the\nworld. It works on the principles of differential magnetic properties of the oxygenated and\ndeoxygenated species of hemoglobin. Homogenization of tissue is achieved by using an\nextremely strong magnet, typically 1.5 Tesla (~20,000 times the magnetic force of the\nearth's gravitational pull) a 3 Tesla (~30,000 times the force of the earth's gravitational\npull). Subsequently a radio frequency pulse is passed through the tissue which blocks the\nhomogenization of tissue. Because oxy and deoxy hemoglobin have different paramagnetic\nproperties the return to homogenization of tissue varies in oxygenated and deoxygenated\nblood allowing the researcher to detect a difference in levels. fMRI is based on the premise\nthat when neurons fire they use oxygen and glucose and the body compensates for the\nutilization of such substances by increasing blood flow to specific regions that have\nbecome activated. Thus, a relative difference in oxygenation (via paramagnetism) ought to\nbe detectable in regions that are recruited for specific processing tasks. In reality the\nchanges in oxygenations are very small, which is why such strong magnets are employed.\nDetection of changes in oxygenation is nearly impossible with magnets weaker than 1.5\nTesla. fMRI, however, offers limited ecological validity. Participants are typically asked to\nlay on their back (although new upright magnets are beginning to be used)and remain as\nstill as possible (motion artifact can destroy detection of small changes in BOLD) for the\nduration of the experiment, which can last up to 2 hours, typically at least 1 hour. The\nparticipant is then exposed to a set of stimuli designed to parse out a specific type or\nprocessing while controlling for all related neural processing. For example, if you were\ninterested in measuring the neural correlates associated with a commonly researched topic\nfrom evolutionary psychology, say sex differences in romantic jealousy you would want to\ncontrol for the effects of sexual jealousy, emotional jealousy, and perhaps even non-\nromantic jealousy. This allows you to set up a series of statistical (image) contrasts to\nidentify regions that are uniquely activated by your stimulus of interest. Takahasi et al.\n(2006), for example, compared sexual jealousy to emotional jealousy to observe the unique\nactivation associated with sexual jealousy when controlling for activations associated with\nemotional jealousy in males and females.\nA newer method for investigating BOLD activation is diffuse optical\nimaging/functional near infrared spectroscopy (DOI/fNIRS). DOI/fNIRS measures the\nsame signal as fMRI, but does so using light. Oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin\nposses different absorption coefficients in the near infrared electromagnetic spectrum, thus\nEvolutionary cognitive neuroscience\nby measuring light reflection within the 700-900 nanometer range of the electromagnetic\nspectrum a researcher can determine (using the modified Beer-Lambert Law, Chance,\n1951) the relative and absolute amount of oxygenated and/or deoxygenated hemoglobin\npresent in a region of neural tissue. Researchers using fNIRS need to employ similar\ncontrols as those imposed on fMRI, with exception of restraining participants from moving.\nThe newest generation of fNIRS devices are highly mobile and can transmit data\nwirelessly, allowing subjects to ambulate while having brain activation measured. The\ntechnology is also relatively inexpensive when compared to fMRI systems which typically\ncost between $2-7 million USD. There are only a few companies manufacturing fNIRS\nsystems for research (e.g., Hitashi, Infrascan, NIRS) and the costs vary from between\nmethodology, however. For example, depth of light transmission is shallow. That is,\nmeasurements can only be made from light that passes approximately 1-1.5 centimeters\ninto the head, which only allows you to measure the cortex in adults. Additionally, because\nyou are using light, other tissue absorption coefficients need to be taken into account. The\nmajor hurdle for this drawback is hair, which if dark can eradicate any light from entering\nthe skull, let alone landing on the cortex.\nNeuropsychological patients\nThe use of neuropsychological patients with specific lesions (e.g., Gazzaniga and\nSergent, Ohta, and MacDonald, 1992) is common in behavioral neurology, clinical\nneuropsychology, and cognitive neuroscience (e.g., Farah and Feinberg 2000).\nAdditionally, the use of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders that appear to be\nrepresented by modular deficits in cognition is also common (Stone et al., 2002; Sugiura et\nal., 2000). Recently, utilization of these patients to test hypotheses from evolutionary\ncognitive neuroscience for the presence of evolved cognitive adaptations has become\npopular (e.g., Baron-Cohen et al., 2001; Stone et al., 2002). The use of patients with\nfocalized lesions allows researchers to investigate the role of specific neural substrates in a\ncognitive process that they're interested in. A classic example is that of Paul Broca, who\nwas interested in language development. He noticed, upon post-mortem inspection, that\nseveral of his patients who experienced language production deficits had focalized damage\nto the left inferior frontal lobe. This finding has now been confirmed by several research\nprograms (including neuroimaging) over the past century and this region has come to be\nknown as Broca's Area. Similarly, Baron-Cohen et al. (1985) noticed that patients with\nautistic disorder appeared to be particularly inept at social cognitive reasoning, while\nretaining functioning in other cognitive domains (e.g., general intelligence). He (and\nothers) have theorized that this specific deficit in social cognitive processing represents an\ninstance of a modular deficit in an evolved domain-specific (social reasoning) cognitive\nmechanisms. This finding has also been replicated several times over using a number of\nmethodologies, including functional neuroimaging, and has been extended to other similar\ncandidate populations (e.g., Irani et al., 2006). There even appears to be a genetic loading\nfor the possession of such modules, which lends further support to the evolutionary\ninterpretation; i.e. these modules are heritable (see Irani et al., 2006).\nEvolutionary cognitive neuroscience\nStimulating the brain\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a technique based upon Faraday's Law\nof induction which states that an activated transducer will charge another transducer, not\nactivated, but that is close in proximity and otherwise not activated. Since neurons are\nessentially electromagnetic transducers, that means that introduction of a strong\nelectromagnetic pulse into the brain can result in neurons becoming activated. This\ntechnique is highly invasive and demands intense screening of participants for seizure\npathologies, but if used correctly and safely can reveal significant information about the\nfunctional and spatial relationship between brain and behavior. The two most common\ntechniques used for TMS in cognitive neuroscience are known as single-pulse and\nrepetitive. Single-pulse TMS allows a researcher to interfere with normal cognition by\ndelivering a singly TMS to a region hypothesized as being implicated some process. If the\ntiming is correct, the participant will experience an inability to complete a task or set of\ntasks. Single-pulse TMS allows researchers to functionally localizeii regions of the brain\nimplicated in cognitive processing. Repetitive TMS on the other hand involves delivering\nlong trains of stimulation, which subsequently result in down (or up) regulation of a\nspatially localized population of neurons. This technique has been dubbed the \"virtual\nlesion\" technique (Pascual-Leone, Walsh and Rothwell, 2000) because the result is such\nthat the region stimulated becomes under (or over) responsive. The effect is transient and\nparticipants soon recover to normal, but during the time of the virtual lesion (~10-30\nminutes) the researcher can engage the participants in a number of cognitive tasks. The\nvirtual lesion method is similar to testing patients with focalized lesions or brain damage,\nbut there is no need to be concerned with long-term neural reorganization or the\ndevelopment of neurocognitive compensatory mechanisms.\nFuture directions for methods in ECN: Interdisciplinary approaches\nIt is likely that the most exciting advancements in technology for understanding the\nevolved mind are going to come from interdisciplinary collaborations. One of the most\nfertile of which, cognitive neurogenetics, is growing in popularity. Cognitive\nNeurogenetics involves researchers in cognitive neuroscience and genetics, or genomics.\nEssentially, it involves measuring brain responses as a function of allelic expression. For\nexample, possession of the val/met single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for the COMT\ngene is associated with less efficient frontal lobe processing, as measured using fMRI (e.g.,\nWinterer et al., 2006). The implications for such findings for the evolution of frontal lobe\ncircuits involved in executive function and social cognition are currently underway.\nConclusion\nThe synthesis of this broadly defined set of research programs might seem at\nfirst as an amalgamation of unrelated research disciplines. However, this is in fact not the\ncase. The overarching theme of evolution, specifically brain-behavior evolution, serves to\ntie together the topics that lay at the foundation of ECN. Although the research questions\nare quite different among evolutionary cognitive neuroscientists, the goal is the same: to\nuncover the workings and the evolutionary history of the mind. Further, as an explicit\nextension of evolutionary behavioral neurobiology, the ECN approach aims to understand a\nlarge spectrum of species differences and similarities, in addition to understanding the\nunique evolved capacities of the human mind and its neurobiology. Hence, the discipline is\nEvolutionary cognitive neuroscience\ninherently comparative and should include investigations and comparisons within species\nand across species. These new studies and reinterpretations of previous findings will add\nnot only to our understanding of how the brain works and how the brain and behavior\ninteract, but also why the brain and behavior interact and work in ways that contribute\nmeaningfully to an organism's (human or non-human) survival or reproduction. Because of\nthe synergistic combination of two vibrant fields--evolutionary psychology and cognitive\nneuroscience--the sum of which (ECN) is greater than its constituent parts, we are in the\nposition to also learn more about how the brain goes awry. For example, in Platek,\nhow modular deficits in patients with autism and schizophrenia can be interpreted and best\nunderstood from the ECN perspective.\nWe hope that this article impresses upon the reader the current drive in research\nprograms designed from an ECN perspective, as well as makes clear to the reader the need\nfor future research from this perspective. The ECN approach attacks investigation of the\nhuman mind as a modularly organized (yet clearly dependent) set of cognitive structures\n(see Barkow, Cosmides, and Tooby, 1992). We hope, in fact, that this article and the\nrelated volume (Platek, Keenan, and Shackelford, 2007) invigorate researchers to consider\nthis new strategy for future investigations and apply this theoretical stance to research they\nmight already have conducted. The development of new laboratories and research groups\ndedicated to the ECN approach is likely. Furthermore, by adopting an ECN approach,\nscientists will be in a position to think about uniquely human traits such as higher-level\nconsciousness, theory of mind, and self-awareness. In fact, ECN might be the only\napproach that can give rise to such an understanding. Evolutionary cognitive neuroscience\nmight be the newest \"science of the mind.\"\nReferences\nAnderson, B.

Interested readers can consult the text\nPrimate Cognition (Tomasello and Call, 1997) as well as a number of recent papers that apply the ECN\nii Here functional localization is differentiated from spatial localization for the simple fact that TMS\nrepresents a causal interference with brain function, while other techniques that offer spatial resolution (e.g.,\nfMRI) are correlative in nature. That is, the BOLD signal is a correlation of activity in a region of interest, or\nset of regions associated with some stimulus delivery, while TMS is the direct influence over brain function\nduring delivery of stimuli. Hence, since TMS can alter behaviour it is said to measure functional localization."
