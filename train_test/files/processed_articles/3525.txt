    "abstract": "Abstract\nEvidence is accumulating that American culture has become more individualistic since the 1950s. In the present research, we\nfocused on one plausible manifestation of individualism, the use of swear words in cultural products. We examined trends in\nthe use of the seven words identified by George Carlin in 1972 as the \"seven words you can never say on television\" in the\nGoogle Books corpus of American English books from 1950 to 2008. We find a steady linear increase in the use of swear\nwords, with books published in 2005-2008 twenty-eight times more likely to include swear words than books published in\nthat American culture has become increasingly accepting of the expression of taboo words, consistent with higher cultural\nindividualism.\n",

A burgeoning area of\nresearch explores trends in the characteristics of individu-\nals, such as in their living arrangements, baby name choices,\nand self-views (Grossmann & Varnum, 2015; Twenge,\nCampbell, & Gentile, 2012a; Twenge, Dawson, &\nCampbell, 2016), concluding that American culture has\nincreased in individualism, a cultural system that favors the\nself over social rules (Triandis, 1995). Another way to\nexamine cultural change is through trends in cultural prod-\nucts--media such as books, movies, songs, and advertise-\nments(Lamoreaux&Morling,2012;Morling&Lamoreaux,\n2008). Several studies of cultural products such as language\nuse in books have found increases in individualism, includ-\ning increases in the use of individualistic words and\ndecreases in collectivistic words (Greenfield, 2013),\ndeclines in words referring to moral character (Kesebir &\nKesebir, 2012), and increases in first-person singular and\nsecond-person pronouns (Twenge, Campbell, & Gentile,\n2013). Another study found increases in individualistic lan-\nguage in the lyrics of popular songs (DeWall, Pond,\nIn this article, we explore changes in another aspect of\nlanguage that may be connected to individualism: The use\nof swear words. The frequency of swearing over time has\nbeen a topic of some interest in popular culture. For exam-\nple, many suggest we now occupy a cruder culture where\nbad language is more common (Gillespie, 2013). \"One of\nthe things that upsets me about modern society is the\ncoarseness of manners,\" the late Supreme Court Justice\nAntonin Scalia said in 2013. \"You can't go to a movie--or\nwatch a television show for that matter--without hearing\nthe constant use of the F-word\" (Senior, 2013). Others\nhave been more sanguine about the free expression of\nswear words, seeing them as a marker of freedom.\nship of profanity in his well-known 1972 routine \"Seven\nwords you can never say on television.\" As Carlin's brother\nPatrick later commented about the routine, \"It was a free-\ning experience for millions and millions of people who\nwere young at that time. It took that restriction off people's\nshoulders and brought them down to a common level\"\n(Bella, 2012). These are opposing views on swearing, but\nboth point to the importance of individual freedom over\ntraditional social norms, a common conceptualization of\nindividualism.\n1San Diego State University, CA, USA\n2University of Georgia, Athens, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nJean M.

Twenge1, Hannah VanLandingham1,\nand W. Keith Campbell2\n Keywords\ncultural change, individualism, swear words, taboo words\n2 SAGE Open\nDespite the interest in trends in swearing, direct empirical\nevidence for the increasing use of swear words is lacking. In\nfact, studies of spoken frequencies of swear words suggest\nfew changes in their use between the late 1970s and mid-\ndo feature more taboo words, possibly indicating that\nAmerican culture has become more accepting of crude lan-\nguage. In this article, we examine changes in the use of swear\nwords since 1950 in written language, using the large Google\nBooks database of 5 million books (Michel, Kui, Presser,\nStudying changes in language use in books is important\nbecause cultural products such as books are a useful place\nto observe and quantify cultural change. As Lamoreaux\nand Morling (2012) argued, it is important to study cultural\nproducts for at least three reasons. First, culture includes\nthe context as well as the person, and cultural products\ncapture culture \"outside the head.\" Second, cultural prod-\nucts are not subject to the biases of that plague self-report\nmeasures, such as reference group and social desirability\neffects. Third, and perhaps most important, cultural prod-\nucts shape individuals' ideas of cultural norms and \"com-\nmon sense.\" People's behavior is often influenced by their\nbeliefs about what others in their culture believe and do,\neven if these assumptions are erroneous (e.g., Zou et al.,\n2009). Cultural products are likely one of the most com-\nmon sources for perceptions of cultural norms. Thus, if\nswear words are used more often in books, it might indi-\ncate an increasing acceptance of these words in the\nculture.\nCultural Shifts Relevant for Changes in\nthe Use of Swear Words\nWhy might the use of swear words increase in American\nbooks? As noted above, individualism is a cultural system\nthat favors the self more highly than the collective, and a\ngrowing body of research suggests that American culture\nhas become increasingly individualistic (Grossmann &\nexpression. Swear words allow the free expression of emo-\ntion, especially anger (Jay, 2009). Due to the greater\nvaluation of the rights of the individual self, individualistic\ncultures favor more self-expression in general (Kim &\nSherman, 2007) and allow more expression of personal\nanger in particular (Safdar et al., 2009). Thus, a more indi-\nvidualistic culture should be one with a higher frequency of\nswear word use.\nIn addition, swear words are also known as taboo words,\nas they are \"sanctioned or restricted on both institutional\ndefined as social rules or inhibitions, are less prominent in\nindividualistic cultures, which usually name fewer behav-\niors as social taboos (Triandis, 1995). Consistent with a\nrise in individualism, other behaviors once considered\ntaboos have faded in American culture. For example, social\ntaboos against premarital and homosexual sex have\ndecreased since the 1990s (Twenge, Sherman, & Wells,\nstigmatizing working mothers and atheists, have also\nbecome less prominent (Donnelly et al., 2016; Twenge,\nCarter, & Campbell, 2015). However, little research has\nexplored the loosening of social taboos in cultural prod-\nucts. The study on song lyrics (DeWall et al., 2011) exam-\nined antisocial words including swear words but was\nlimited to only 10 songs per year and did not examine\nswear words separately from antisocial words such as\n\"kill\" and \"hate.\"\nResearch suggests that swearing is linked to personality\ntraits such as extraversion, dominance, narcissism, and neu-\nroticism (Fast & Funder, 2008; Holtzman, Vazire, & Mehl,\nswearing was associated with high extraversion and low\nagreeableness (Kennison & Messer, 2017), a personality\nprofile empirically linked to high individualism via an asso-\nciation with grandiose narcissism (e.g., Miller et al., 2011;\nPaulhus, 2001). This profile is also linked to individualism\nconceptually, as high extraversion, especially boldness and\nassertiveness, and low agreeableness, especially low mod-\nesty and high grandiosity, are connected to an individualistic\ndrive to stand outside and above the group (Triandis & Suh,\n2002). Several studies also link narcissism directly to self-\nreported individualism across cultures (Cai, Kwan, &\nMeisel, Ning, Campbell, & Goodie, 2016). Average levels\nof extraversion and dominance (Terracciano, 2010; Twenge,\ncism (Twenge, 2015) have all increased among individuals\nin the United States. Thus, the frequency of swearing may\nincrease as well.\nThe Present Study and Hypotheses\nThe Google Books Ngram viewer allows the examination\nof language use in 5 million books (Michel et al., 2011).\nThe Ngram database reports usage frequency by dividing\nthe number of instances of the word in a given year by the\ntotal number of words in the corpus in that year, thus cor-\nrecting for changes in the number of published works and\ntheir length. To avoid confounds between year and coun-\ntry of publication, we drew from a corpus restricted to\nbooks published in one country (the United States, the\nAmerican English corpus). Books are also an ideal cul-\ntural product in which to examine language use, as they\nhave stayed relatively unchanged as a medium, in contrast\nto the significant changes in broadcast media, with the\nmovement from three main networks to cable to streaming\nvideo.\nTwenge et al. 3\nIn such research, a key question is which words to\nexamine. Two issues are of particular importance: (a) a\nlist of words that is somewhat objective, and (b) a list\nwithout a strong present fashion bias (i.e., words that have\nbecome fashionable or popular in recent years). This latter\nissue is problematic because any increase seen in the data\nmight simply reflect fashion trends rather than broader\npsychological changes. We attempted to address these\nissues by analyzing a list of swear words chosen by some-\none else (to provide some objectivity vis-\u00e0-vis the investi-\ngators) and chosen in a previous historical period (to\navoid present fashion bias). To that end, we used the\n\"seven words you can never say on television\" popular-\nized by comedian George Carlin in 1972 (shit, piss, fuck,\ncunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits; Bella, 2012).\nThis is a short yet reasonably comprehensive list of swear\nwords considered taboo in polite society. It differs some-\nwhat from other lists of commonly used taboo words such\nas that of Jay (2009) as it focuses on swear words rather\nthan simply taboo words (Jay's list is fuck, shit, hell,\ndamn, goddamn, Jesus Christ, ass, oh my god, bitch, and\nsucks). Some of the taboo words on Jay's list (Jesus\nChrist, hell) would be problematic to examine in fre-\nquency databases as indicators of cultural change as they\nare also used in other contexts where they are not taboo.\nNevertheless, the two words that appear on both lists (fuck\nand shit) account for up to half of the uses of taboo words\n(Jay, 2009). Three of the words on Carlin's list (cock-\nsucker, cunt, and fuck) are the same as the three identified\nby college students as the most taboo (Jay & Janschewitz,\n2008). Carlin's list thus identifies the most taboo words,\nmaking it a conservative test of the hypothesis that the use\nof taboo words has increased.\nWe began examining swear words in 1950, a common\nstarting point for the postwar era. Michel et al. (2011)\nnoted that the Google Books database is more reliable after\n1900, and most research examining changes in social rules\nThus, examining data after 1950 covers the decades in\nwhich social rules began to change, plus an extra two\nthan other indicators. Given previous research and cultural\nstudies pointing toward the relaxation of social taboos in\nAmerican society, we hypothesize that the use of swear\nwords will increase in American books between 1950 and\nMethod\nWe examined the American English (2009)1 corpus from\nthe Google Books Ngram database. The Google Books cor-\npus contains 4% of books published since the 1800s. These\nbooks were likely not truly randomly selected (Michel\net al., 2011); however, we assume these books were not\nselected in a way dependent on word use frequency that\nalso varied systematically with year. In addition, the Ngram\ndatabase is by far the largest database available of digitized\nbooks. As described in more detail in Michel et al. (2011),\nGoogle used 100 sources such as university libraries and\npublishers to generate a comprehensive catalog of books.\nThe books were digitally scanned and the corpus was win-\nnowed of serial publications, multiple editions, and books\nwith poor print quality, unknown publication dates, or mis-\ncoded language (e.g., a book listed in the library catalog as\nbeing written in English that was not actually in English).\nCountry of publication (in this case, the United States) was\ndetermined by 100 bibliographic sources (Michel et al.,\nOur unit of analysis was the frequency of the use of a\nword in a specific year. We then tested for changes in\nthose frequencies over time by examining the correlation\nbetween year and frequency, with the n in each analysis of\n58 (the number of years). Our results thus refer to the\nannual change in the frequency of the use of the seven\nswear words (shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, mother-\nfucker, and tits). We also examined two composites of the\nseven words. The first adds the use frequencies together (a\ncomposite of means); thus, it is more influenced by the\nwords used more frequently. The second adds the Z-scores\nof each of the seven words together; thus, it counts each\nword equally. The seven words formed a reliable index,\nCronbach's alpha = .71. We did not use smoothing in our\nanalyses or figures as we wished to capture the exact fre-\nquency in each year.\nBy definition, correlations represent the direction and\nfit of the linear relationship between the variables of\ninterest--here, the frequency and year. However, it is\nalso important to know the simple magnitude of the\nchange from the first part of the time period to the last.\nThus, we include a second effect size, d, based on the dif-\nference between use in the first 4 years of the time period\nused these means to calculate how many times more com-\nmon the use of the word (or words) was in the late 2000s\nThe American English corpus does not note any\nchanges in the types of books (fiction vs. nonfiction). As a\nsubstitute, we obtained the percentage of books published\nin the United States each year that were fiction from the\nStatistical Abstract of the United States (U.S. Census,\nwill use these statistics as controls in the analyses to rule\nout the possibility that any changes over time are caused\nby shifts in types of books. However, we have no way of\nknowing if these percentages are the same as those in the\ndatabase. In addition, the 1982 edition of the Abstract\n4 SAGE Open\nnotes that an increase in the number of books between\nin the recording of paperbound books,\" and more of these\npaperback books are likely to be fiction. Thus, the mea-\nsurement differed with time, so these analyses should be\ninterpreted with caution. Fortunately, the percentage of\nfiction books did not vary much by year, ranging from a\nlow of 7% to a high of 15%. As an alternative, we consid-\nered analyzing the English Fiction corpus of Google\nBooks; however, this corpus includes all books in English,\ncreating the possibility of confounding year with country\nof origin (if, for example, the corpus included a higher\npercentage of American books in later years).2 In addition,\nour interest was not specific to either nonfiction and fic-\ntion books.\nWe also examined whether the frequency of swearing in\nbooks covaried with the violent crime rate, obtained from the\nResults\nAmerican books in recent years became significantly\nmore likely to use each of the seven swear words in the\nyears since 1950, with a linear change evident in most\n(see Table 1, and Figures 1 and 2). Motherfucker was\n168 times more often. In total, American books used the\nthan the early 1950s. Effect sizes (ds) were also very\nin frequency of use (see Figure 3), but all increase over\ntime (see Figure 1).\nThe results were unchanged when controlled for the per-\ncentage of books that were fiction, r for mean composite\nwith year = .98, p < .001; r for Z-score composite with\nTotal swearing in books was positively correlated with the\nviolent crime rate, r for mean composite = .59, p < .001; r for\nDiscussion\nAmerican books contained dramatically more swear words\nbooks in the late 2000s were 28 times more likely than those\nin the early 1950s to come across one of the \"seven words\nyou can never say on television.\"\nThese findings suggest a notable decline in social\ntaboos against swear words consistent with previous\nresearch finding evidence for increasing individualism\n(e.g., Greenfield, 2013). American culture increasingly\nvalues individual self-expression and weaker social\ntaboos, and these trends are manifested in the increasing\nuse of swear words. If books reflect broader cultural\ntrends, it suggests that other cultural products such as\nmovies and TV shows may also demonstrate increases in\nthe use of swear words (a potential future topic for\nresearch; that said, any increases in swear words in broad-\ncast media may be confounded with the introduction of\nmedia not regulated by the Federal Communications\nCommission, such as premium cable and streaming\nvideo). Overall, these findings are consistent with the\nobservation that American culture has become more\naccepting of crude and coarse language.\nSeveral studies have found that swear words are more\nemotional and distracting than nonswear words (Bertels,\nKolinsky, Bernaerts, & Morals, 2011; Colbeck & Bowers,\n2012). This suggests that swear words are powerful ways of\nattracting attention. However, as they become more com-\nmon, they may lose their power. This prediction that the\nattentional power or \"shock value\" of swear words has\ndeclined could not be tested in these data but is an interesting\nquestion for future research.\nr with\nyear\nBeta for year\nTimes (\u00d7)\nmore frequent\nNote. All rs and betas over .10 have 95% confidence intervals that do not include zero. Beta for year squared tests for quadratic (curvilinear) effects.\nTwenge et al. 5\nThese data also suggest two more historical points. First,\nthe trend toward the use of swear words in books began before\nGeorge Carlin's 1972 comedy routine. His work therefore\ncaptured and possibly amplified an emerging cultural trend.\nSecond, this massive shift in the use of swear words in books\noccurred despite the U.S. federal government's efforts to\nreduce profanity on television. In this case, it seems the gov-\nernment was unable to constrain free expression broadly,\nsuch as in books (although they almost certainly have been\nable to on network TV). We have not examined other media\nin this research, but it is plausible that the cultural push for\nindividual expression has in part resulted in the boom of less\nregulated media such as satellite radio and cable television.\nIn summary, the use of swear words was significantly\nmore common in American books in the late 2000s com-\npared with the early 1950s, increasing in a primarily linear\nfashion over this time period. The size of this effect,\nexpressed as a d, is massive. This change is consistent with a\ncultural shift from more collective or communal values to\nmore individualistic, self-expressive values.\nNote.

We could not determine whether this downturn was due\nto an error in this database or to some other cause, so we con-\ntinued to rely on the 2009 database. Nevertheless, both data-\nbases showed dramatic increases in the use of swear words.\nFor example, the use of the word \"shit\" increased 57 times\ndatabase and 69 times in the \"American English (2009)\" data-\nbase we used in the primary analyses.\n2.
