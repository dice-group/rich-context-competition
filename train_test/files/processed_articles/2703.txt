Marijuana is the single\nmost commonly used illicit drug among US youth;\nthe prevalence of marijuana use continues to increase\ndespite the increases in the perceived harm of mari-\njuana (1\u00ad3). Documented studies indicate that mari-\njuana use can start at a very young age (4,5). The\nhealth burden of adolescent marijuana use is substantial\nbecause of a number of negative consequences of early\nmarijuana exposure, including developmental, neuro-\ncognitive, psychosocial, and behavioral problems\nDevelopmentally, early marijuana exposure has been\nfound to be associated with greater impairment in brain\ngrowth, severe cognitive consequences, and poorer\nlong-term health outcomes (4,8,10).

To our knowledge, only one\nstudy existed that ever examined the risk of marijuana\nuse initiation as a function of age. However, that study\nwas based on data from a female sample in the Midwest,\nand did not report hazards of initiation by age (22).\nMore recent data are required for more effective mea-\nsures to prevent marijuana use among youth in the\nUnited States.\nIn addition to an overall pattern, the likelihood of\nmarijuana use onset by age may differ by race/ethnicity.\nRacial/ethnic differences in the prevalence of marijuana\nand other substance use have long been recognized\nhas been attributed to differences in cultural backgrounds\nand the process of acculturation (31\u00ad34). Individuals'\ncultural background exerts great influence on their beha-\nviors (34). For example, the low hazards of substance use\namong Asian American adolescents than other groups is\nattributed in a large part to the cultural values against such\nbehaviors at the familial and community level (23). On\nthe contrary, stress associated with acculturation may\nincrease the risk for ethnic minority youth in the United\nStates to use drugs as coping strategies to deal with cul-\ntural conflicts and interpersonal tensions (35). The era of\nglobalization leads to the emergence of another racial/\nethnic group: multi-race due to the growing number of\ninterracial marriages (36,37). Relative to others, youth\nwith multi-racial backgrounds could be at a greater risk\nto initiate marijuana use because of potential higher\nfamily economic status, increased exposure to cultural\nconflicts, and more opportunities to access to marijuana\nPurpose of this study\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the like-\nlihood of marijuana use initiation across the age span\nfrom birth to adolescence, and further to emerging\nadulthood. Adolescence-emerging adulthood represents\na critical time in life that is highly susceptible to illicit\ndrug use. The ultimate goal is to provide more recent\ndata advancing our understanding on the period when\nyoung people are most susceptible to marijuana use,\nand develop potential interventions to prevent mari-\njuana use among young people in the United States.\nMaterials and methods\nData source and study sample\nData used for this study were derived from the 2013\nNational Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)\nthat are publically available for use. NSDUH is an annual\nnationwide cross-sectional survey, sponsored by the\nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services\nAdministration (SAMHSA). The purpose of this survey\nis to monitor the prevalence and correlates of drug use\namong the civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged\n12 years and older in the United States. The participants\nwere randomly selected using multi-stage clustered sam-\npling method. Sensitive questions, including marijuana\nuse were administered using Audio Computer-Assisted\nSelf Interviewing (ACASI) and Computer-Assisted Self\nInterviewing (CASI), while other questions were adminis-\ntered through Computed-Assisted Personal Interviewing\n(CAPI). The screening response rate was 83.93% and the\nWe elected to use the 2013 NSDUH data for this\nanalysis because they are the most recent data available\nin the designated website by SAMHSA (https://nsduh\nweb.rti.org/ respweb/homepage.cfm). To quantify the\nhazards of marijuana use onset by age, only participants\nin the age range of 12\u00ad21 years were included.\nParticipants older than 21 years in the public domain\ndata are presented by age group rather than single year\nof age. These participants (n = 28,495) were excluded.\nIn addition, participants who reported first marijuana\nuse younger than 5 years of age (n = 6) were excluded,\nResearch conduct\nThe study protocol was approved by the Institutional\nReview Board at University of Florida\nVariables and their measurements\nAge of onset of marijuana use\nThe key variable for this study was measured with data\nfrom self-reported age when a participant used mari-\njuana the first time in his/her life. In NSDUH, partici-\npants were asked: \"How old were you the first time you\nused marijuana or hashish?\" The reported age in years\nwas used for analysis. For 138 participants with missing\ndata on age of onset, imputed results were used.\nRetrospectively reported onset age has been used in\nsurvival analysis to estimate age patterns of the risk of\nonset, including onset of tobacco use (23) and alcohol\nconsumption (18,22). In such analyses, the valid esti-\nmate of the mean age of first use of a substance can be\nobtained assuming the reported errors in the age of\nonset to be normally distributed with a zero mean.\nOther variables for marijuana use\nParticipants were coded as \"lifetime marijuana users\" if\nthey answered \"yes\" to the question: \"Have you ever,\neven once, used marijuana or hashish?\" They were\nfurther coded as \"current marijuana users\" if they\nreported having used marijuana within the past 30\ndays in response to the question: \"How long has it\nbeen since you last used marijuana or hashish?\"\nDemographic variables\nThis group of variables were age (in years), gender\n(male/female), and race/ethnicity of White, Black,\nHispanic, Asian, multi-race, and others (American\nIndians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and other\nPacific Islanders). These variables were used to describe\nand compare the sample characteristics.\nStatistical analysis\nSurvival analysis was used to quantify the hazards of\ninitiation of marijuana use by age. Different from the\nage-specific rate of lifetime use, the hazards of initiation\nis referred to as the instantaneous probability at which a\ngroup of individuals at the beginning of an age may\ninitiate marijuana use during a 1-year period. With this\ndefinition, the single-year age data up to age 21 years\nallowed us to quantify the hazards of marijuana use\nonset from birth to age 20 years. Survival analysis is a\npowerful method to estimate the hazards of onset by\nage with a set of functions to characterize the time to\nWe constructed survival models to analyze the data\nby treating the reported age of first marijuana use as\ntime t, measured from birth to initiation of marijuana\nuse, and the initiation of marijuana use as the event (or\nfailure in survival analysis). Participants who had not\nyet initiated marijuana use at the time of the survey\nwere treated as censored. Although it would not be\npossible to know when and whether these participants\nmight start using marijuana, the survival modeling\nanalysis procedures automatically account for the\nhazards of these participants. With this modeling\napproach, the age pattern of the hazards of marijuana\nuse initiation was quantified based on a re-constructed\nlongitudinal cohort.\nThe SAS PROC LIFETEST for survival analysis\nwas used to analyze the hazards of onset H(t) at\nage or time t, and was estimated with the Kaplan\u00ad\nMeier product\u00admoment method. The proportion of\nindividuals who never used marijuana at age or time\nt, corresponding to the survival function S(t) was\nthus estimated using H(t). Subsequently, 1 \u00ad S(t)\nprovides an estimate of survival-model-based preva-\nlence of lifetime marijuana use by age from birth to\nage 21 years. With the modeled result of 1 \u00ad S(t), the\nmean age (95% confidence interval (CI)) of\nmarijuana initiation was estimated as the total area\nunder the curve 1 \u00ad S(t). This survival-model-based\nmean age is more reliable than the directly computed\nmean age from self-reported data using the \"svy\"\nstatement in Stata, which was used to compute\npoint estimate and 95% CI, considering the multi-\nlevel cluster random sampling strategy NSDUH used\nTo test if data were appropriate for survival analysis,\nplots of \u00adlog [S(t)] against time (age) and \u00adlog[S(t)]\nagainst log[\u00adlog[S(t)]] were used for individual survival\nmodels. An approximately linear distribution of the\nplot of \u00adlog[S(t)] against log[\u00adlog[S(t)]] was used as\nthe criterion to assess data\u00admodel fit (41). Lastly, the\nlog-rank test was used to assess differences in the\nhazards of marijuana use initiation between male and\nfemale gender and across racial/ethnic groups (41).\nThis approach has been frequently used in reported\nstudies to investigate the hazards of onset by age for\nStatistical analyses were conducted using the com-\nmercial software SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc.,\nCary, NC) and Stata, version 14.0 (Stata Corp., College\nStation, TX).\nResults\nDemographic factors and marijuana use\nThe study sample contained 26,659 participants aged\nWhite, and the mean age of the sample was 16.20 years\nlifetime marijuana use and 12.2% reported current use\n(see Table 1 for more details).\nHazards of initiation of marijuana use\nThe plots of \u00adlog[S(t)] against log[\u00adlog[S(t)]]\nshowed a distribution close to a straight line for\nthe overall sample and for the individual subgroups\nby gender and ethnic groups, indicating a good\ndata\u00admodel fit.

Additional results\nfor the survival-model-based estimates and directly\ncomputed mean ages of onset are presented in Table 2.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we documented the age pattern of mar-\nijuana use initiation among US youth up to age of 21\nyears. Up to age of 11 years, the risk of marijuana use\ninitiation is very low for both males and females. After\nage of 11 years, the risk increases rapidly with the first\npeak at age 16 years (corresponding to grade 10). After\na transient decline at age of 17 years (corresponding to\ngrade 11), the risk reached another peak at 18 years\nhigher than that at age of 16 years. The age patterns of\nthe risk of marijuana use initiation are similar by gen-\nder; but the level is higher for males than females,\noverall and by most of the racial/ethnic groups.\nFindings of this study indicate that the age pattern of\nmarijuana use onset differs from that of tobacco and\nalcohol use initiation. Reported data from published\nstudies on cigarette smoking and alcohol use indicate\nthat the likelihood of onset often peaks around age\nthe imbalance between physical and cognitive develop-\nment reaches the highest level (42,43). However, our\nstudy findings indicate a much delayed peak for mar-\nijuana use onset: 16\u00ad18 years of age with the highest\npeak at age of 18 years when a child becomes an adult.\nThis peak risk cannot be well explained by the imbal-\nanced development of physiology and cognition.\nThe current age pattern of marijuana use onset has\nsignificant implications for drug use prevention. Early\ninitiation of drug use in adolescence is positively asso-\nciated with drug use and abuse in subsequent years, and\nearly prevention has added effect to marijuana use\nuse onset was observed to increase rapidly at age of 11\nyears, while most existing marijuana intervention pro-\nin grades 9\u00ad12 or college who already had advanced to\nthe high-risk period for several years. Based on our\nfindings, effective drug use prevention should start no\nlater than age of 10 years before the risk of marijuana\nuse onset starts to increase. Further, findings from our\nstudy also showed a dip in the risk of marijuana use\nonset at 17 years when many students in high school\nare preparing for college entrance. This finding implies\nthat among many factors, emphasizing academic work\nand achievement may present a strategy to reduce the\nrisk of marijuana use onset in later adolescence.\nAdditional research is suggested to study the peak risk\nof marijuana use onset at age 18 years after high school.\nLikely explanations for this increased risk may include\nbut are not limited to reductions in parental monitor-\ning, increases in peer influence, and feeling rebellious\nwhen youth leave home the first time for college (5).\nOne surprising finding of this study is that the\nhazards of marijuana use initiation was the highest for\nUS youth with multi-racial backgrounds across the age/\ntime span up to age of 21 years. As the United States\nbecomes more racially diverse, differences in multi-\nracial and multi-cultural experience and the process of\nacculturation may play a key role in the drug initiation.\nThe finding that multi-race individuals experience the\nhighest hazards of marijuana use initiation than others\nneeds further research. It is likely that these children\nmay experience more intercultural conflicts at home,\nexclusion in schools, and the wider communities\n(36,37). They may also struggle in their identification\nwith a single racial identity or face pressures to not\ndissociate with one or more of their ethnicities when\nTable 2.

Furthermore, the\nmulti-cultural background may present increased\nopportunity for these youth than others to access\nmarijuana.\nConsistent with findings from studies on many sub-\nstance use behaviors (23,32), the hazards of marijuana\nuse onset is the lowest among Asian Americans. This\nphenomenon may be associated with the traditional\ncultural norms and values in the Asian countries,\nwhere the drug use among adolescents are unaccepta-\nble; and these value norms and values are still observed\nin families and communities in the United States (23).\nThe hazards for Black and Hispanic are similar to those\nfor White and higher than for Asian. Racial and ethnic\ndifferences in marijuana use onset represent a very\ncomplex question. Findings of this study provide\nsome preliminary data informing future behavioral\nresearch to investigate factors that may contribute to\nthe racial ethnic difference and to devise intervention\nprograms for high-risk groups.\nIn addition, the hazards of marijuana use initiation\ndiffered by gender. Relative to adolescent females,\nmales are more likely to initiate marijuana use during\nthe transition from adolescence to young adulthood.\nThis finding is consistent with data reported by others\nin previous studies (52,53). Furthermore, when the\ngender differences were assessed by racial/ethnic\ngroups, males are at higher risk to initiate marijuana\nuse than females if they are White, Black, or Hispanic.\nThese gender and racial/ethnic differences in the risk of\nmarijuana use initiation should also be considered in\ndrug use prevention programming.\nMean age of drug use initiation, including mar-\nijuana use initiation is a commonly used indicator\nin drug use research and prevention. Traditionally,\nthis statistic is computed based on the subsample of\nparticipants who initiated drug use. The mean age\ncalculated using this method tends to be underesti-\nmated because it does not consider the contribution\nof those in the sample who are likely to but have\nnot yet started drug use. The survival analysis pro-\nvides a method to overcome this limitation. In this\nstudy, we have shown that the traditionally com-\nputed mean age of marijuana use initiation is\nage 14.88, estimated by the survival-model-based\nmethod A greater difference was observed for the\n16.46). This model-based mean age can be used in\nresearch to define early and later initiation as seen\nin reported studies (4,7).\nThere are strengths and limitations to this work.\nThis study was conducted using the NSDUH data that\nrepresents the total US population. We used a retro-\nspectively reported age of onset to build a birth cohort\nto estimate hazards of marijuana use onset starting at\nbirth. This approach also enabled us to complete the\nanalysis avoiding bias due to attrition (drug users are\nmore likely to lost to follow-up than non-users) as\ninherited in longitudinal data (23). However, the lack\nof data by single year of age for participants older than\n21 years prevented this study from analyzing the\nhazards of marijuana use onset for age ranges older\nthan 21 years. In addition, we cannot examine the\nhazards of marijuana use onset for a more detailed\nracial/ethnic group analysis because no adequate data\nare available from the NSDUH public dataset. The\nfindings of this study could only be applied to mari-\njuana use, and other substances should be included in\nfuture studies. In addition to studying marijuana use\nonset alone, future research should pay attention to the\ninitiation of use of more than one substance and drug\nas a comorbidity to better understand the behavior and\nto more effectively inform drug use prevention.\nConclusions\nScientific data on the exact time when a person starts to\nuse marijuana is a prerequisite for evidence-based\nintervention and public health policy planning and\ndecision-making. This study is the first to examine the\nlikelihood of initiation of marijuana use by age from\nbirth to 21 years with data from a representative\nnational sample of the US population. Findings of this\nstudy add to the literature regarding the overall age\npattern of the risk of marijuana use initiation for the\ntotal sample and for both male and female genders and\nthe major racial/ethnic groups. Such data are urgently\nneeded for marijuana use prevention programming\namong the approximately 43 million US youth aged\nmarijuana use. Drug use prevention programs should\nconsider the age, gender, and racial/ethnic differences\nin risk of marijuana use initiation among adolescents\nand emerging adults. Intervention programs should be\ndeveloped for both parents and adolescents, and deliv-\nered to the right target population at the right time for\nbetter prevention effect. Attention has also to be paid to\nyouth with multi-racial/ethnic backgrounds because of\nthe risk of marijuana use onset among them is higher\nthan all others.\nDeclaration of interest\nThe authors report no conflicts of interest.
