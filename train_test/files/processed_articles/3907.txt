Entrenched within the inclusive pedagogical philosophy, the\ncurrent qualitative study executed individual interviews with 18 teachers, document analysis, and nonparticipant observations\nin the Midlands educational province of Zimbabwe to explore support practices for including learners with autism in regular\nEarly Childhood Development (ECD) classes. The study revealed that support practices for including learners with autism\nin regular ECD classes included entry competencies informed pedagogy, reinforcement, academic adaptations, socialization,\nconsultation, and strategic management of structured routines and compulsions. The institutionalization of comprehensive\nteacher education for inclusion and collaborative culture could optimize support practices for including learners with autism\nin regular ECD classes.\n",

The exceedingly com-\nmon categories of disability among Zimbabwean learners\ninclude intellectual and sensory impairments, including\nManyatera, 2014). In alignment with several other countries,\nincluding Botswana (Brewin, Renwick, & Fudge, 2008;\nChhabra, Srivastava, & Srivastava, 2010), South Africa\nZimbabwe decrees the education of learners with special\nneeds including autism in regular classes (Chireshe, 2011;\nunique needs in Zimbabwe are known as \"learners with dis-\nabilities\" (Majoko, 2013). These learners are entitled to\ninclusion once the Department of Schools Psychological\nServices and Special Needs Education of Zimbabwe has\nformally identified them (Musengi & Chireshe, 2012;\nMushoriwa & Gasva, 2008), enhancing access, equity, and\nequality in education.\nDespite the worldwide pursuit of inclusion, a universally\naccepted definition of it is illusive thus far due to conceptual\ndifficulties in defining it including what counts as evidence\nFlorian & Black-Hawkins, 2011). Inclusion can, however, be\nviewed as a philosophy which entails equal valuation of\nevery learner as belonging to the culture of the regular school\nconstituting presence, participation, acceptance, and achieve-\nment (Black-Hawkins & Florian, 2012; Forlin & Chambers,\nentails diagnosis and reduction of barriers to learners' access\nto regular settings, including educational institutions, com-\nmunities, and families, and maximizing support practices to\n1University of South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa\nCorresponding Author:\nTawanda Majoko, Department of Inclusive Education, College of\nEducation, University of South Africa, Pretoria 0003, South Africa.\nEmail: tawandamajoko@gmail.com\nPractices That Support the Inclusion of\nChildren With Autism Spectrum Disorder\nin Mainstream Early Childhood Education\nin Zimbabwe\nTawanda Majoko1\n Keywords\nautism, Early Childhood Development, inclusion, learners with special needs, regular classes, Zimbabwe\n2 SAGE Open\nsuccessful and effective practice embodies participation of\nall learners and their families in the activities of the regular\nschool communities while meeting their unique needs, as\nwell as contributing to the advancement of these institutions\nSince the adoption of inclusion in 1994, educational prov-\ninces across Zimbabwe report notable increase in enrollment\nof learners with special needs, including autism (Chireshe,\nand elsewhere, reveals that inclusion benefits both learners\nwith and without autism. Inclusive classes afford conducive\nsettings for growth and education of learners with autism\nalongside their typically developing peers (Chandler-Olcott\nO'Connor, & Kline, 2009). In addition, they can be stimu-\nlants for learning, development, and feelings of acceptance\nfor these learners (Emam & Farrell, 2009; Leblanc,\nRichardson, & Burns, 2009; Lindsay, Proulx, Scott, &\nThompson, 2014). Thus, inclusive pedagogical settings are\npremised on equalization of opportunities in education. Fully\nincluded learners with autism have more social support,\nsocial networks, and better educational targets in comparison\nwith their peers in special classes (Leach & Duffy, 2009;\nLindsay et al., 2014). Learners with autism who are included\nin regular classes develop a realization and accommodation\nof individual differences (de Boer & Simpson, 2009; Symes\n& Humphrey, 2010) as they are exposed to peers with a\ndiversity of temperaments and talents (Falkmer, Granlund,\net al., 2014). Inclusion in regular school classes also increases\neducational expectations for both learners with and without\nLimited systemic change in pedagogical institutions has\nculminated in little progress toward inclusion for learners with\nautism in the entire regular education curricula and contexts in\nseveral countries, including Zimbabwe. Attempts to promote\ninclusion and access to the regular school education curricu-\nlum have resulted in the shift primarily from where a learner\nreceives his or her educational program, to what and how the\nlearner is taught (Ballard, 2012). Currently, the assumption for\nteaching learners with autism is to consider these learners'\naccess to the regular classes focusing on the quality of learning\ntaking place (Humphrey & Lewis, 2008). The presence of\nlearners with autism in regular classes alone will not guarantee\nimproved outcomes for these learners (Bitterman, Daley,\nMisra, Carlson, & Markowitz, 2008; Falkmer, Ochlers,\nGranlund, & Falkmer, 2015). Successful and effective sup-\nports for their learning, acceptance, participation, and achieve-\nment need also to be provided (Chandler-Olcott & Kluth,\nWhereas in Zimbabwe, there is a dearth of studies on sup-\nport practices for including learners with autism in regular\nclasses, internationally, a number of studies have been\ncarried out on the subject. These include Humphrey and\n(2009). Common features of these studies are pooling\nresources, tailored teaching methods, essential training,\nteamwork, establishing collaborative cultures with families\nas well as nurturing a welcoming class climate. Although\nthese are presently considered model practices, further\nresearch will demonstrate how they are implemented in\nincluding learners with autism in regular classes. Many stud-\nies reveal numerous benefits of inclusion in regular educa-\ntion while indicating that support practices for including\nlearners with autism in regular classes are a fundamental\nglobal gap with respect to knowledge base (Emam & Farrell,\neral countries, including Zimbabwe, inclusion of learners\nwith autism in regular classes is notably escalating since the\nimperative to investigate how they are being served to\nimprove practice. In the absence of schools, teachers, and\nparents' ownership and commitment, full inclusion of learn-\ners with autism in regular classes will not be realized (Symes\n& Humphrey, 2010). Thus, the authentic voices of stakehold-\ners, who are the implementers of educational innovations,\nincluding teachers require solicitation because of their expe-\nrience and intuition regarding how inclusion of learners with\nautism in regular classes can be enhanced. In the subsequent\nsection, challenges in including learners with autism in regu-\nlar classes are presented.\nIncluding Learners With Autism:\nChallenges\nDespite the dearth of studies on challenges in including\nlearners with autism in regular classes in Zimbabwe, several\nresearchers have explored the subject internationally.\nBecause there are individual differences among learners with\nthe challenges revealed in literature may not apply to all of\nthem. Significant deficits in interacting and repetitive behav-\nior, interests, activities, and communication characterize\nautism (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013;\ncorresponding difficulty in social and language of autism\nLynch & Irvine, 2009), navigation of the social world is a\nchallenge to learners with autism (Jones & Frederickson,\nConsequently, learners with autism are about 20 times more\nvulnerable to social exclusion in educational institutions in\ncomparison with their counterparts without developmental\nFundamental aspects of development, which are often\nchallenging in pedagogy of learners with autism, include\nprocessing of sensory input, playing creatively, interacting\nsocially, and commutating verbally and nonverbally\nWilmshurst & Brue, 2010). Comprehending and conveying\npersonal needs to counterparts and teachers often challenges\nlearners with autism (Kasari, Locke, Gulsrud, & Rotheram-\ninstructions and reading teachers' verbal and body expres-\nsions may also be complicated for learners with autism\nWilmshurst & Brue, 2010). Because of sensory issues,\nlearners with autism have further difficulties in sustaining\nnoisy settings, others' touches, and keeping eye contact\nHumphrey, 2010). School environments are, however, busy,\nloud, and crowded (Farrell, Alborz, Howes, & Pearson,\n2010), which complicates these learners' inclusion in regu-\nlar classes. The complications of grasping the social domain\nfor learners with autism can restrict these learners' estab-\nlishment and reinforcement of relationships with their peers\nthat can invoke stress and anxiety in them (Bitterman et al.,\nthe complications in emotional and social understanding of\nPellecchia et al., 2015), support practices are needed to\ninclude them in regular classes. Due to the above challenges\nrevealed in previous studies, the current study sought to\ninterrogate support practices for including learners with\nautism in Zimbabwean schools.\nRationale for the Study\nAccording to Zimbabwe Ministry of Primary and Secondary\nEducation, including learners with unique needs, including\nautism, in education is a national priority (Chireshe, 2013;\nMpofu & Shumba, 2012). Consequently, educational prov-\ninces across the country, including Midlands educational\nprovince where the current study was carried out, have cited\na notable escalation in the placement of learners with special\nneeds, including autism, in regular Early Childhood\nDevelopment (ECD) classes (Chireshe, 2011; Mugweni &\nproportion of learners with special needs, including autism,\nare educated in regular classes (Chireshe, 2011; Majoko,\n2016), teachers and families confront the challenge of real-\nizing successful and effective inclusion despite the lack of\nclear policies, legislations, and adequate professional teacher\npreparation in the country (Mpofu & Shumba, 2012; Musengi\nWhile autism impairments are lifelong, they may be miti-\ngated through early intervention (Dingfelder & Mandell,\ninformation base for education and medicine reveal that uti-\nlizing inclusive pedagogy is among the best practices for\nserving learners with autism (Chandler-Olcott & Kluth,\nHorrocks et al., 2008) as it supports the optimum functional-\nity of these learners. Nevertheless, globally, including learn-\ners with special needs in regular classes is a complicated and\nill-conceptualized domain of teaching and learning (Emam\ngle to respond to the needs of learners with autism (de Boer\ning learners with autism is a worldwide challenge, it is criti-\ncal to explore support practices for including these learners\nin regular ECD as it is the foundation of further education.\nParents of learners with autism, among other stakehold-\ners, often express dissatisfaction with pedagogical services\nand programs and advocate for services and programs that\nare responsive to the uniqueness of these learners (Lynch &\nIrvine, 2009). Thus, more effort is needed to nurture regular\nclasses that are friendly to learners with autism (Emam &\n2010). As learners without developmental challenges usually\nemulate adults'behavior and attitudes, the attitudes of educa-\ntors toward the education of learners with autism in regular\nclasses are foundational as regards nurturing an inclusive\npedagogical setting (Barnes, 2009; Falkmer, Ochlers et al.,\nrange of needs among learners with autism is fundamental\nbecause these learners are likely to be socially excluded and\nThe realization of inclusion in education requires research\non teachers' comprehension of autism as well as their pre-\nparedness to meet the needs of learners with the condition\nseveral researchers have examined beliefs, attitudes, and per-\nceptions regarding including learners with special needs,\neducational processes, and supports in regular classes (Berry,\n2011). According to the best knowledge of the researcher,\nthere is a dearth of studies on pedagogy of learners with\nautism in Zimbabwe. Thus, this study explored support prac-\ntices for including learners with autism in Zimbabwean regu-\nlar ECD classes so as to add to the limited national literature\nbase as well as to glean practices to optimize access, equity,\nequality, and participation of these learners in education in\ntandem with the global and national priority. Specifically, the\nsubsequent research question was addressed:\nResearch Question 1: What are teachers' support prac-\ntices for including learners with autism in regular ECD\nclasses in Midlands educational provinces of Zimbabwe?\nMethod\nEmbedded in qualitative research methodology, the current\nstudy utilized a multiple-case study design. In the subsequent\nsection, the design, sites, participants, procedure, and analy-\nsis of data of the study are presented.\n4 SAGE Open\nStudy Design\nTo solicit teachers' support practices for including learners\nwith autism in regular ECD classes in Midlands educational\nprovince in Zimbabwe, this study was embedded in a multi-\nple-case study design. Qualitative research methodology\ninterrogates a given phenomenon from the people experienc-\ning it through textual descriptions that can be analyzed for\nthemes and can induce transferable interpretations (Pierce,\nfocused on individual participants' views, experiences, and\npractices, its methodological approach was entrenched in\nphenomenology. Phenomenological research is grounded in\nunderstanding of daily life situations of individuals (Pierce,\n2008). Teachers' practices for supporting inclusion of learn-\ners with autism in mainstream ECD classes constituted com-\nponents of daily life that were the focus of attention of the\nresearcher.\nStudy Sites\nZimbabwean schools are categorized into 10 administrative\neducational provinces. The current study was executed in\nregular public primary schools in the Midlands educational\nprovince. English is the medium of instruction in these insti-\ntutions. Midlands educational province comprises public pri-\nmary schools in rural, semiurban, and urban settings of\nKwekwe, Gokwe North, Chirumhanzu, Zvishavane, Gokwe\nSouth, Gweru, Mberengwa, and Shurugwi districts. One\ninstitution was drawn from each one of these settings from\neach district.\nParticipants\nThere are 766 regular public primary schools in Midlands\neducational province. To understand teachers' support prac-\ntices for including learners with autism in regular ECD\nclasses, public primary schools were purposively sampled\nfrom institutions that were inclusive of these learners. The\nsample constituted 18 public primary schools. Six institu-\ntions were drawn from urban, semiurban, and rural settings,\nrespectively. Recruitment of teachers was through contacts\nwith Midlands Provincial Education Offices of Zimbabwe.\nThe researcher distributed information letters to contacts in\nthe designated schools. Upon the head teacher's approval of\nthe study, information letters were distributed to teachers\nwho were perceived to satisfy the criteria for participation.\nThe criteria for teachers' participation in the study included\nthe following: at least a primary school teacher's diploma\nwith an endorsement in ECD and an undergraduate degree in\ninclusive education or related field of specialization; at least\nteaching experience of 4 years in a regular ECD class, includ-\ning a learner/learners with autism; and presently a teacher in\na regular ECD class with a learner/learners with autism in\nMidlands educational province.\nA total of 18 purposively sampled ECD teachers made\nup of 11 females and seven males, one per participating\ninstitution, participated in the current study. Theoretical\nsaturation informed the adequacy of the number of the\nstudy participants. It was realized when there was no emer-\ngence of relevant or new data with respect to respective\ncategories as well as when these categories were fully\ndeveloped as regards their variations, dimensions, and\nparticipants taught in a regular ECD class which had a\nmaximum of 17 four- to five-year-old learners. Each regu-\nlar ECD class included, at most, two learners who had high\nfunctioning autism whose intelligence ranged from aver-\nage to above average. Participants were between 31 and 57\nyears old with five to 15 years of teaching experience. In\naddition to a primary school teacher's diploma with spe-\ncialization in ECD, 12 participants had postgraduate quali-\nfications in special needs education. Each of them was a\nhost teacher to a student teacher. The researcher carefully\ngained entry into the schools, selected participants, and\nestablished cordial relations as well as maintained ethical\nprotocols.\nProcedure\nThe researcher sought and secured the ethical approval to\ncarry out the study from the Ministry of Primary and\nSecondary Education of Zimbabwe as well as Midlands\nProvincial Education offices. The researcher sought informed\nconsent from the participants before carrying out the investi-\ngation. The study was carried out between October 2014 and\nJuly 2015. Each participating school constituted a unit and\nunveiled a distinct context of regular ECD setting and cul-\nture. To interrogate support practices for including learners\nwith autism in regular ECD classes, similarities and differ-\nences from these pedagogical settings were discerned by the\nresearcher. The researchers carried out 18 individual inter-\nviews with participants, one interview per participant. Each\ninterview lasted an average of 44 min. The following ques-\ntions were designed to solicit data from individual teachers\non support practices for including learners with autism in\nregular ECD classes:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 How long have you been teaching? (This was a probe\nfor demographic information including number of\nyears taught and teaching qualifications.)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 How do you serve learners with autism in your regular\nclass?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 What works well when including learners with autism\nin your regular class?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 What can teachers do to include learners with autism\nin regular classes?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 What else would you like to add that we did not talk\nabout regarding including learners with autism in reg-\nular classes?\nWith individual participants' consent, audiotaping and\nverbatim transcription of all individual interviews were\ndone for subsequent analysis. Audiotaping facilitated more\naccurate collection of data. It also enabled the researchers'\nattention to the participants while interviewing them.\nEnglish was used in carrying out individual interviews.\nParticipants were interviewed in their classrooms after\nschool hours, and participation was voluntary without any\ncompensation. In spite of the organization and structure\nduring interviewing because of the utilization of the inter-\nview guide, the researcher ensured flexibility through con-\ntext-specific interrogation of issues.\nThe researcher carried out 18 nonparticipant class obser-\nvations, one per participant. The focus was on regular ECD\nclass interactions of all learners and teachers, learner interac-\ntions, pedagogical content, instructional approaches, learn-\ning materials and resources adaptation, instructional\nlanguage, class accommodation as well as inclusive class\nmanagement methods and techniques. Nonparticipant obser-\nvations were grounded in gleaning teachers' support prac-\ntices for including learners with autism in regular ECD\nclasses. These enabled the solicitation of \"thick descriptions\"\nfor understanding respective teachers' support practices for\nincluding learners with autism in regular classes. These\nobservations lasted 40 min on average. The researcher\nrecorded field notes using an observation guide. The\nresearcher held informal conversations with the participants\nregarding pedagogy after each observation as a follow-up to\nensure clarity. School observations through an inspection of\ninfrastructure facilities, including buildings, of each of the\nparticipating schools were also carried out by the researcher.\nTo ascertain institutionalized support practices for including\nlearners with autism in regular classes, access audits were\nexecuted. The researcher recorded observations in the obser-\nvation guide.Activities, resources, materials, and facilities of\nevery observed school were photographed while social\nrecord books, remedial records, schemes of work, and lesson\nplans were analyzed to yield data on support practices for\nincluding learners with autism in regular ECD classes.\nData Analysis\nData that were collected from several sites, methods, and\nsources were triangulated to illuminate on emerging themes\n(Creswell, 2009). Interviews, observations, and analyses of\ndocuments assisted in assessment of the extent of conver-\ngence and complementarity of findings and elaboration on\ndivergences between findings yielded (Silverman, 2009).\nWhile interviews facilitated comprehension of the process\nfor inclusion of learners with autism in regular classes,\nobservations augmented the contextual comprehension of\nthe practice for inclusion of these learners. Interviews illumi-\nnated on observations as well as aided in validation of other\nobservations. Triangulation of data constituted: identifica-\ntion of the study focus; discerning trends within and across\nsets of data; generation of initial codes; searching for simi-\nlarities and differences for identification of initial themes\nthat were overarching; reviewing of themes; definition, and\nrenaming of themes; and report writing. Data organization\nand interpretation were grounded in the focus of the study.\nUpon completion of the preliminary data analysis, the\nresearcher and two critical readers, who were experts in\nqualitative research, presented the primary themes that\nemerged to the participants for engagement and ultimately\nenhanced trustworthiness.\nFindings\nThrough analysis of data thematically, nine themes relat-\ning to support practices for including learners with autism\nemerged. They are as follows: entry competencies\ninformed pedagogy, structured routines, reinforcement,\nacademic modifications, environmental modifications,\nsocialization, communication, management of obsessions\nand compulsions, and collaboration and discourse. These\nwere foundational in including learners with autism in\nregular classes.\nEntry Competencies Informed Pedagogy\nAll (18) participants revealed that they entrenched pedagogy\nin entry competencies of learners with autism to include\nthese learners in regular ECD classes, as confirmed in the\nsubsequent selected statements (fictitious names utilized to\nensure participants' anonymity and confidentiality):\nSince my learners with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have\nvisual-spatial strengths, I use visual teaching and learning\napproaches to keep them focused on the taught concept. I use\nvisual supports of interest to them including natural and man-\nmade resources and materials in my teaching. I use pictures of\nlocal animals and fruits that motivate them to learn and keep\nfocused when teaching different subjects such as mathematics\nand science, expressive arts and social sciences.\nMeanwhile, other participants (14) reported that they used\nlearning styles that were commensurate with characteristics\nof learners with autism:\nLearning styles of children with ASD in my classroom including\nvisual, tactile, kinesthetic and auditory informs my teaching. For\ninstance, when I want a child with ASD to unlock the classroom\ndoor when he or she gets to the classroom in the morning, I\nsummatively explain while demonstrating exactly how to do\nthis. This supports children with ASD to successfully carry out\ntasks which results in their self-realization and social acceptance\nby their classmates without the condition. (Mbeva)\nMost participants (15) revealed that they were proactive\nrather than reactive in managing the behavior of learners\nwith autism to include these learners in regular classes:\n6 SAGE Open\nAs long as children with ASD do not engage in self-injurious\nbehavior, I patiently and consistently wait for them to calm\nwhen they throw temper tantrums. I have sensitized children\nwithout developmental challenges to continue with their\nactivities when their peers with ASD throw temper tantrums.\nChildren without developmental challenges understand and are\naccommodative of the behavior of their peers with ASD. (Nyati)\nNhoro added,\nI capitalize on the social strengths of my learners with ASD. In\ncooperative learning, I pair or group them with their typically\ndeveloping friends. Children with and without ASD engage\nsocially and academically. Interests and choices of learners\ndictate my grouping practices.\nObservations and document analysis revealed that the\nentry competencies of learners with autism informed peda-\ngogy in regular classes. All participants (18) were observed\nmanaging pedagogy based on the entry competencies of both\nlearners with and without autism. For instance, based on\ntheir verbal proficiency, some learners with autism were\nobserved being taught communication of personal informa-\ntion, including their names and surnames, dates of birth, and\nvillages, while others were observed being taught personal\ngrooming, including combing hair and tying shoelaces based\non their motor skills competence. With the support of student\nteachers, participants were observed providing individual-\nized instruction and support including coaching and prompt-\ning to both learners with and without autism who had baseline\nskills and competencies.\nStrategic Use of Structured Routines\nMost (13) participants reported that they strategically man-\naged structured routines in including learners with autism in\nregular classes. For instance, Bimha argued,\nI provide visual schedules of the events of every school day. I\nput such schedules in a location which is easily seen by all\nlearners in my classroom. Because of these schedules, learners\nwith ASD are always clear of expectations and settled.\nKamba elaborated,\nI write out visual schedules and pair them with picture symbols\nthat capture the attention of both pupils with and without ASD. I\nattach these schedules to the desks of all pupils. Because of\nstructured routines with visual supports that speak to the interests\nof learners, they are always aware and ready to execute daily\ncurricular and cocurricular activities.\nAs embodied in class diaries, most participants (14) were\nobserved extending visual displays and structured routines\nthat were ordinarily available for all learners. Visual supports\nincluding visual cues to augment oral communication, visual\nrepresentations of steps in class routines, labeled chairs, doors,\nobjects, chalkboards, daily schedules, individualized sched-\nules for both learners with and without autism, and visual\nschedules were observed for working stations. One participant\nwas observed requesting the learner with autism to read the\nupcoming activity of the day on the schedule of the class.\nReinforcement\nAll (18) teachers revealed that they used reinforcement in\ndeveloping and maintaining behavior and motivation in\nincluding learners with autism in regular classes. For exam-\nple, Haka argued,\nI reinforce nonpreferred activities of both educands with and\nwithout ASD with preferred activities, contingent upon\ncompletion of assignments. When an educand with or without\nASD, for instance, has complications in keeping focus on any\nsubject assignment, he or she can spend 10 minutes in the play\ncentre after completion of his or her assignment. Both educands\nwith and without ASD are enthusiastic to complete assignments\nbecause of my reinforcement system.\nTsenzi elaborated,\nI carry out a preferred reinforcer assessment in consultation with\nfamilies of learners with ASD and their counterparts without\ndevelopmental challenges before teaching. I provide\nreinforcement to learners with ASD and their typically\ndeveloping counterparts soon after their completion of tasks in\norder for them to make the connection. I use preferred reinforcers\nsuch as clay cows, wire cars and clay pots for effective\nreinforcement and ultimate shaping of the behavior of the\nlearners with ASD which facilitates their social acceptance in\nthe class.\nSeveral (13) participants reported that they used rein-\nforcements to manage the behavior of both learners with and\nwithout autism to facilitate inclusion:\nI reward socially approved behavior to support all learners to\nstay on task. This prevents behavioral outbursts by learners with\nASD which enhances their social inclusion in the classroom. I\nuse learners' favorite wild fruits, games, magazines and verbal\npraises for them to concentrate on assigned work. (Shato)\nThe environments of the observed classes were friendly to\nboth learners with and without autism. For instance, store-\nrooms were used as \"safety zones\" for learners with autism\nfor relaxation and calming down, and dull and limited wall\ncharts were used to eliminate distraction as well as sensory\noverload for learners with autism. Consistent with their daily\nlesson plans, all participants were observed using positive\nprogramming interventions including direct teaching of\nlearners with autism to inculcate behavior in them for com-\npliance with the expectations. Reinforcements, including the\npresentation of favorable rewards such as play time and ver-\nbal praises to enhance appropriate behavior, were used. All\nparticipants were observed using consequence-based inter-\nventions including ignoring behavior that was not interfering\nwith the class atmosphere and a token economy such as stars\nand stickers to reinforce the behavior of both learners with\nand without autism.\nAcademic Modifications\nAll (18) teachers reported that they used academic modifica-\ntions to include learners with autism in regular classes.\nI reduce the number of assignment items that learners with ASD\ncan complete. This sustains the attention of those with fine-\nmotor deficits and motivates them to learn. I also use alternative\nassessments to include learners with ASD. Alternative response\nmodes including drawing and signing answers in assignments\nfacilitates academic achievement of learners with ASD. (Mhara)\nNzou added,\nI seek support from other stakeholders including peer teachers\nand paraprofessionals in teaching educands withASD. Specialist\nteachers, educational psychologists, therapists, school\nadministrators, community health workers and parents support\nme. They support children with ASD in the social, psychological\nand educational domains including self-care which catalyzes the\ninclusion of these children.\nIn alignment with the content and the teaching and learn-\ning activities of their lesson plans, all participants were\nobserved delivering teaching and learning content in response\nto the cognitive level of functioning of learners with autism.\nParticipants were observed gradually increasing the level of\ncomplexity of pedagogical content and supporting learning\nwith visual information. This was done using hands-on\napproaches and concrete daily living examples in teaching\nand learning while breaking down complex teaching and\nlearning tasks into subtasks which were taught and sequen-\ntially reinforced based on learners' requisite skills. All par-\nticipants were observed analyzing and tackling academic\nskills, social skills, and life skills as subtasks with each step\ntaught but then linked to the next in a chain of subtasks in\nalignment with their lesson plans.\nEnvironmental Modifications\nAll (18) participants revealed that they modified the peda-\ngogical environments in including learners with autism in\nregular classrooms. Specifically,\nI adopt several environmental adaptations in my classroom\nincluding eliminating distracting stimuli such as noise, providing\nchoices, favorite peers and activities and using a nearby vacant\nclassroom as a relaxing zone. These eliminate inappropriate\nbehavior and develop positive behavior in educands with ASD\nthereby facilitating their inclusion.\nI keep the desks of learners withASD and some of their typically\ndeveloping counterparts close to me facing the front of the\nclassroom to ensure that they are on-task. Since learners with\nASD in my classroom do not tolerate noise, I have designated a\ntree at the back of my classroom as a quiet zone for them. They\nalso retreat to this quiet zone when they are overloaded with\nstimuli. (Mhembwe)\nBimha added,\nI eliminate environment nuisance variables to create a friendly\nenvironment for inclusion of learners with ASD. I have\nsensitized typically developing learners to maintain low levels\nof noise in the classroom and I avoid bright wall charts. This\neliminates anxiety in children with ASD contributing to their\nsocial and educational fitting in the classroom.\nConsistent with their schemes of work and daily lesson\nplans, most participants were observed using several class-\nroom management strategies to support a structured pedagogi-\ncal environment for the provision of consistency and clarity of\nexpectations in specific situations and anticipation of upcom-\ning events to learners with autism. Daily visual schedules for\nlearners with autism, with different tasks and alternate activi-\nties which fitted into overall classroom schedules, were\nobserved. Daily activities, which were written in lesson plans,\nwere presented visually and put on the desks of learners with\nautism to explain changes to activities and expectations.\nSocialization\nAll participants (18) reported that they taught social skills to\ninclude learners with autism in regular classes, as indicated\nin the subsequent selected statements:\nI provide pupils with ASD the opportunity to access peer models\nand social opportunities for participation and interaction in\ndiverse settings and activities such as school, work, and sport\nand recreation activities with appropriate natural cues, stimuli\nand reinforcers. I also teach social skills and comprehension of\nsocial situations using several strategies including social stories\nwritten by parents, typically developing pupils and myself.\nThese social stories present situations from the home and school\nlives which develop in pupils with and without ASD positive\nbehaviors for coexistence. (Bere)\nNyati elaborated,\nI craft easily seen and understandable periodically reviewed\nsocial rules which facilitate social interactions between learners\nwith ASD and those without developmental challenges. Since\nmy learners with ASD have social deficits, I use those without\ndevelopmental challenges as peer models and discussions,\ndebates, puppetry, questioning and rehearsal of strategies for\nsocial interaction. I also integrate disability issues in teaching\nwhich helps learners without developmental challenges to\nunderstand and accept their counterparts with ASD.\n8 SAGE Open\nMost participants (14) were observed using several strate-\ngies including the provision of opportunities for participation\nand interaction in diverse natural contexts with relevant\nstimuli, models, and natural cues. This was done to equip\nlearners with autism with social skills in alignment with\nteaching and learning activities which were in their lesson\nplans. These included social interaction\u00adoriented techniques,\nincluding puzzles, word games, role-play, drama, simulation,\ndiscussions, debates, playhouses, ball games, and hide-and-\nseek. Participants were also observed using social stories\nwhich constituted descriptive sentences, directive state-\nments, and perspective statements in supporting communica-\ntion, social interaction as well as including learners with\nautism in regular classes.\nCommunication\nAll teachers (18) revealed that they strategically taught com-\nmunication to learners with autism in including these learn-\ners in regular classrooms, as indicated in the subsequent\nselected excerpts:\nIn teaching communication, I target paying attention, imitation,\ncomprehension and use of language in social interaction to\nfacilitate the inclusion of learners with ASD. I take on board the\ncommunication abilities of learners with ASD in my classroom.\nSince most of them lack functional language, I use paired\ngestures with speech to ensure inclusive pedagogy. (Bimha)\nNyati added,\nAs a class, we use sign language and total communication to\ncommunicate with educands with ASD. As a result, there is\neffective teaching and learning of educands with ASD in the\ncompany of typically developing educands. Most importantly,\nthere is effective communication between typically developing\neducands and educands with ASD because of use of alternative\ncommunication.\nShato elaborated,\nI determine communicative attempts exhibited by the behavior\nof learners with ASD. I reinforce their appropriate behavior such\nas asking to go to the toilet appropriately and ignore inappropriate\nbehavior such as screaming when signaling to want to go to the\ntoilet. However, when it is complicated to ascertain the function\nof a learner's behavior, I use a behavior plan. This constitutes\nthe antecedent and consequence in managing the behavior of\nlearners with ASD. This promotes positive behavior in these\nchildren and their accommodation by those without ASD.\nMeanwhile, Bere argued,\nI use concrete language to eliminate abstract concepts as pupils\nwith and without ASD misunderstand abstract language. In\nteaching expressive arts, language arts, mathematics and\nscience, social sciences, technology and other subjects, I use\ndiverse teaching methods, strategies and techniques including\ngroup projects, telling and listening to stories, song and dance,\ndiscussions, debates, quizzes and rhymes to develop receptive\nand expressive language in children with ASD. Children with\nASD engage in learning with the rest of their classmates as I use\nteaching methods, strategies and techniques that are grounded in\ntheir interests and needs.\nConsistent with the content and activities of their lesson\nplans, most participants (16) and typically developing learners\nwere observed using several strategies to support communica-\ntion of learners with autism. These included clear, simple, pre-\ncise, and concise language, and familiar, concrete, and specific\nwords used daily. Participants paced their speech according to\nthe abilities of individual learners to afford them time for pro-\ncessing information. Participants also used social interaction\u00ad\norientedactivitiesincludingpairwork,groupwork,whole-class\nassignments, and games to support communication, thereby\nincluding learners with autism in regular classes.\nStrategic Management of Obsessions and\nCompulsions\nAll participants (18) reported that they strategically managed\nobsessions and compulsions to include learners with autism\nin regular classes, as confirmed in the following statements:\nI prepare and explain any changes regarding the daily routine to\nboth learners with and without ASD. I put picture symbols and\ntexts on the schedule to show change in routine, for instance,\nchange in break time. I then verbally and visually remind\nchildren learners with ASD of the upcoming events a few\nminutes before the transition in order to lower the potential for\nanxiety. (Bere)\nGudo elaborated,\nWhen introducing new activities and reinforcing positive\nbehavior, I use short intervals of time as my children have narrow\ninterests which they obsessively pursue. I use task analysis,\nprogressing at the rate of children's response to new content and\nactivities. I use reinforcement to optimize the probability of\nsuccess as it results in changes in the behavior of children with\nASD. I also use age-appropriate teaching and learning materials\nand resources, including toys, with both children with and\nwithout ASD to avoid labeling and stigmatization.\nMost participants (15) were observed affording learners\nwith autism the chance to retreat and relax and using proac-\ntive teaching approaches in keeping with their behavior man-\nagement record books. All observed participants had\nbehavior plans embodying targeted alternative behavior,\ninstruction and management strategies, and specific inter-\nventions based on identified behaviors of learners with\nautism. These written plans spelt out the goals for change of\nbehavior, adaptations in the environment, and reactive strate-\ngies, and set review dates for behavior goals.\nConsultation and Partnership\nAll participants (18) revealed that they consulted and part-\nnered with other stakeholders in including learners with\nautism in regular classes, as confirmed in the following\nselected statements:\nParents inform me about the current and future needs of their\nchildren with ASD. I use their strategies to manage and\ncommunicate with children with ASD. Typically developing\nchildren inform me about the interests of their peers with ASD\nincluding games and toys which I use in teaching. I also\ncollaborate with the community, speech and language\npathologists, educational psychologists, school administrators,\nspecialist teachers and traditional leaders to mobilize expertise,\nfinance, technology and materials such as toys, textbooks and\nstationary for both children with and without ASD. (Tsenzi)\nNyana added,\nI pool expertise in designing individualized educational plans\nfor children with ASD through working in consultation and\npartnership with families, student teachers, parents, educational\npsychologists, social workers and therapists. Because of\ncollaboration with our school community, donors, child welfare\norganizations, organizations of and for people with disabilities,\nsocial workers, therapists, churches and politicians, I have\nexpert, moral, social, psychological and material support in the\ninclusion of children with ASD.\nMost participants (16) were observed delivering services to\nlearners with autism in consultation and partnership with other\nstakeholders, including fellow teachers, student teachers, typi-\ncally developing learners, occupational therapists, speech\ntherapists, physiotherapists, nurses, community leaders, and\nschool administrators. For instance, some typically develop-\ning learners were observed informing the participants about\nthe favorite games of their peers with autism while some par-\nticipants were observed gleaning strategies from parents for\nmanaging the behavior of their learners with autism, including\noutbursts. An analysis of minute books revealed that most\ninstitutions had multidisciplinary teams for the delivery of ser-\nvices to learners with autism although such teams were not\nfully composed due to the lack of some members, including\ntherapists and educational psychologists.All observed settings\nhad scheduled meetings on school improvement plans for\ninclusivity in education for the year with parents, community\nleaders, professionals, and other stakeholders.\nDiscussion\nSince Zimbabwe adopted inclusive education in 1994 in\nalignment with the global arena, learners with special needs,\nincluding autism, learn in regular classes (Mugweni &\nHowever, the presence of learners with autism in regular\nclasses does not guarantee their learning and their\ncounterparts' welcoming of them (Brewin et al., 2008;\nHumphrey, 2008), creating a challenge for teachers (Lindsay\nis, nevertheless, fundamental in social, academic, career\ndevelopment, sense of belonging, and full participation of\nlearners including those with special needs, including autism,\nin regular schools, families, and communities (Maich &\nBelcher, 2012). Previous studies examined teachers' chal-\nlenges in including learners with autism in regular classes or\ntheir perception of the practice. There is, thus, a dearth of\nstudies on support practices for including learners with\nautism in regular classes, hence this research.\nSupport practices for including learners with autism in\nregular ECD classes in Zimbabwe found in this study are\nevidenced based and/or commonly used in other countries.\nIn including learners with autism in regular classes, teachers\nentrenched individualized instruction in whole-class peda-\ngogical context. Individuality of learners with and without\nautism informed pedagogy in regular classes. Teachers who\nmanaged the pedagogical content, process, and assessment\nin regular classes were found to respond to these learners'\nneeds, optimizing academic success and full participation of\nthese learners. Past research, similarly, found that inclusion\nembodies access and success of all learners, inclusive of\nthose with special needs and needing teaching and learning\nsupport (Black-Hawkins & Florian, 2012; Boyle, Topping, &\n& Linklater, 2010). Individuality of both learners with and\nwithout autism took center stage in teaching and learning to\nenhance inclusion in regular classes. Teachers' understand-\ning that every learner with or without autism is an individual,\nand the realization of the importance of looking beyond the\nlabel so as not to define learners by their diagnosis supports\ninclusion in regular classes. Teachers need to see past the\nlabel so that stereotypes are challenged and their expecta-\ntions about the capabilities of learners with autism are raised.\nTeachers also strategically managed structured routines to\nnurture rich pedagogical communities for learners with\nautism and their typically developing counterparts in regular\nclasses. To optimize inclusion in regular classes, teachers\nused visual schedules and reinforcement for both learners\nwith and without autism. This finding resonates with inclu-\nsive pedagogical philosophy (Florian & Black-Hawkins,\n2011), which requires teachers to extend what is generally\navailed to all learners and the creation of community of prac-\ntice instead of utilization of pedagogy that is appropriate for\nthe majority alongside something \"additional\" or \"different\"\nwith respect to learners who experience barriers to learning.\nTeachers managed pedagogy of learners with autism in the\ncommunity of their peers without the condition. In the same\nvein, previous studies reveal that inclusion entails the equal\nvaluation of every learner as a member of the school culture\n2011). Simple environmental adaptations can support inclu-\nsion of learners with autism in regular classes.\nConsistent with inclusive pedagogical philosophy (Florian\n& Black-Hawkins, 2011), which dismisses rigid perceptions\nregarding capability and the premise that including learners\nwith special needs hampers the achievement of those without\nspecial needs, teachers further focused on abilities rather\nthan limitations of individual learners with and without\nautism in regular classes. In developing and maintaining the\nbehavior and academic success of individual learners with\nand without autism in regular classes, teachers used rein-\nforcements. \"Learning for all\" informed teachers' manage-\nment of behavior and pedagogy in regular classes, which\npotentially curtailed differences. Similarly, past research has\nestablished that inclusive pedagogical settings support learn-\ners with autism to learn in the community of their typically\ndeveloping peers (Chandler-Olcott & Kluth, 2009; de Boer\nments, which are based on the interests of individual learners\nwith and without autism, support inclusion in regular classes.\nSimilarly, teachers used academic modifications in pursu-\nance of inclusion and educational success of both learners with\nand without autism in regular classes. Such academic modifica-\ntions included reduction of assignment items, task analysis, peer\nand paraprofessional support, and alternative response modes in\nquestion answering for learners with and without autism in reg-\nular classes. Thus, teachers' practices were in alignment with\nthe premise of inclusive pedagogy (Florian & Black-Hawkins,\n2011) that all learners can progress. Similarly, previous studies\nhave found that inclusive education entails coexistence and\nachievement of both learners with and without disabilities\nteaching, learning, and assessment strategies and techniques\nthat meets the individual needs of learners with autism, coupled\nwith support from peer teachers and paraprofessionals, supports\ninclusion of these learners in regular classes.\nTeachers also modified pedagogical environments to\ninclude learners with autism in regular classes. This finding\nis in alignment with Florian and Black-Hawkins's (2011)\ninclusive pedagogy, which obligates educators to research\nand adopt innovative strategies so as to facilitate teaching\nand learning of learners with and without developmental\ndelays. Teachers supported inclusion in regular classes by\nmaking modifications to the pedagogical environments\nwhich included the reduction of noise levels and strategic\nseating arrangements of both learners with and without\nautism. Similarly, previous studies advocate for nurturing\n\"autism friendly\" classes (Barnes, 2009; Falkmer, Ochlers\npedagogical philosophy of Florian and Black-Hawkins,\nwhich is grounded in viewing complexities with respect to\npedagogy as barriers in education, educators explored strate-\ngies for establishing and reinforcing pedagogical environ-\nments that facilitated learning of learners with autism in\nregular classes. Teachers' modification of regular classes\nthrough creating structured environment can assist in includ-\ning learners with autism in these settings.\nEducators further socialized learners with and without\nautism in supporting inclusion in regular classes. Teachers\nsocialized both learners with and without autism to facilitate\nsocial interaction in regular classes. Similarly, past research\nhas established that fully included learners with autism\nIshijima, Kasari, & London, 2010). Consistent with the\npremise of Florian and Black-Hawkins's (2011) inclusive\npedagogy that \"all\" learners succeed, teachers socialized\nboth learners with and without autism using peer models and\nin-class disability awareness information sessions. These\nstrategies supported full involvement and participation of\nlearners with and without autism in regular classes. Similarly,\nprevious studies reveal that inclusion entails equal valuation\nof every learner as an integral component of the culture of\nDonnelly & Watkins, 2011) involving access and success\nChambers, 2011). In the same vein, respecting the self-worth\nof individual learners as equal partners in the class informs\ninclusive pedagogy (Florian & Black-Hawkins, 2011).\nLearning of social skills embedded in home and school con-\ntexts can foster social development in learners with autism\nand ultimately facilitate their inclusion in regular classes.\nIn addition, educators supported communication of learn-\ners with autism so as to include these learners in regular\nclasses. In such facilitation, teachers paired gestures with\nspeech in communication; used sign language, concrete lan-\nguage, and total communication; reinforced positive commu-\nnication; and capitalized on the abilities of learners with\nautism. This finding aligns with Florian and Black-Hawkins's\n(2011) inclusive pedagogical philosophy, which requires\nteachers to focus pedagogy on what learners are able to do\ninstead of what they are unable to do. Similarly, previous stud-\nies have found that preparation of teachers for autism (Falkmer,\nfoundational in inclusion of learners with the condition in reg-\nular classes. Learner diversity informed pedagogy in regular\nclasses. In the same vein, Florian and Black-Hawkins's inclu-\nsive pedagogy requires teachers'accounting for differences as\nan important component of development of learners in con-\nceptualizing teaching. Teaching communication to learners\nwith autism and the utilization of argumentative techniques of\ncommunication based on their communication abilities can be\nhelpful in including these learners in regular classes.\nTeachers also strategically managed obsessions and com-\npulsions in including learners with autism in regular classes.\nIn alignment with Florian and Black-Hawkins's (2011)\ninclusive pedagogical philosophy which is entrenched in\nlearning for all--the idea of everybody (\"not some and\nmost\") instead of exclusively learners diagnosed of \"addi-\ntional needs\"--teachers' explained changes regarding daily\nroutines and used reinforcement focused on both learners\nwith and without autism. Such teacher application of a uni-\nversal approach to the management of obsessions and\ncompulsions potentially eliminated typically developing\nlearners'stigmatization of their peers with autism. Consistent\nevidence reveals that social justice and human rights princi-\nples inform inclusive teachers' management of both learners\nwith and without disabilities (Ballard, 2012; Donnelly &\nby the teacher that allows learners with autism to know about\nthe daily routine and be aware in advance of events taking\nplace can aid in including these learners in regular classes.\nTeachers engaged other stakeholders in including learners\nwith autism in regular classes. Teachers consulted and part-\nnered with parents, typically developing children, profes-\nsionals, and paraprofessionals in including learners with\nautism in regular classes. This finding concurs with Florian\nand Black-Hawkins's (2011) inclusive pedagogy, which\ndemands educators to collaborate with other stakeholders\nwho are respectful of learners'dignity. Teachers worked with\nother stakeholders in including learners with autism in regu-\nlar classes. Consistent evidence reveals that teacher collabo-\nration with other stakeholders in implementing inclusive\neducation is foundational in pooling inclusive resources\nmaterials, finance, and technology.\nResearch Limitations and Future Research\nParticipants of the present study were purposively selected\nfrom one province in Zimbabwe. As learners with autism are\nincluded in regular classes nationally, practices for support-\ning inclusion of these learners need to be solicited from a\ncountrywide representative sample for transferability of\nfindings. Resultantly, the transferability of the present study's\nfindings to regular ECD classes that include learners with\nautism in Zimbabwe cannot be known. Teachers may have\nchanged their instructional strategies because of their aware-\nness that they were being observed.\nThis study did not also incorporate perspectives and expe-\nriences of other stakeholders inclusive of both learners with\nand without autism and their parents, principals, social work-\ners, and therapists. Resultantly, whether these stakeholders'\nperspectives and experiences on support practices for includ-\ning learners with autism in regular ECD settings are consis-\ntent with those expressed by teachers cannot be ascertained.\nFurther research could solicit for the aforementioned stake-\nholders' perspectives and experiences to glean diverse sup-\nport practices for including learners with autism in regular\nECD classes. Comprehensive information that could serve as\na springboard for teacher preparation and development for\ninclusion of learners with autism in regular ECD classes can\nbe yielded.\nThe present research further explored teachers' practices\nfor supporting inclusion of learners with autism in regular\nECD classes, yet other practices of other stakeholders\ninclusive of parents, educational psychologists, and thera-\npists could also facilitate the practice of the philosophy.\nResultantly, future studies could solicit for the above-men-\ntioned stakeholders' support practices for including learn-\ners with autism in regular ECD classes. As this research\nrevealed the criticality of the attitudes and preparation of\nteachers in supporting inclusion of learners with autism in\nregular ECD classes, further research could examine mod-\nels of teacher preparation and development for autism.\nAlso, further studies could interrogate effective models of\ncollaboration between stakeholders and academic and envi-\nronmental adaptations in including learners with autism in\nregular ECD classes.\nConclusions and Recommendations\nAlthough challenges abound in including learners with\nautism in regular ECD classes, educators exhibited concep-\ntualization, positive attitudes and commitment to these learn-\ners, and the philosophy, and strategized to practice it.\nCapitalization of education authorities on teachers' concep-\ntualization and positive dispositions through supporting\nthem can optimize their support for including learners with\nautism in regular ECD classes. Inversely, education authori-\nties' failure to provide support may result in teachers' failure\nto include learners with autism in regular ECD classes. As\nthe sociocultural life and environment is critical in including\nlearners with autism in regular ECD classes, teachers' expo-\nsition to sociocultural issues in their preparation and devel-\nopment is indispensable in improving their effectiveness in\nservice delivery to these learners in regular ECD classes.\nConsidering teachers' centrality in including learners with\nautism, teacher training institutions need to institutionalize\ncomprehensive teacher preparation and development for\nautism to ensure teachers' professional competence in\nresponding to the diversity of learners with the condition in\nregular ECD classes.\nAs inclusion benefits learners with and without autism\nand the society in its entirety, all stakeholder individuals,\norganizations, and institutions need to work in collaboration\nand discourse for the advancement of the cause for the bet-\nterment of humanity. As competence of stakeholders is inte-\ngral in inclusion of learners with autism in regular classes,\nstaff development initiatives inclusive of conferences and\nmeetings need to be institutionalized for parents, teachers,\npolicy makers, and school communities to garner their sup-\nport and commitment toward the practice. In tandem with\nteachers' co-option of disability issues in teaching and learn-\ning, disability issues need to be incorporated in curriculum\ndevelopment to sensitize stakeholders, including typically\ndeveloping learners, on human exceptionality and the impe-\ntus for inclusivity. As collaboration of stakeholders is indis-\npensable in inclusion of learners with autism, communities\nof practice such as teacher\u00adteacher and teacher\u00adparent are\ninstrumental in including these learners through synergy and\nsyllogism. As multidisciplinary teams were not fully consti-\ntuted to support inclusion of learners with autism in regular\nclasses, the professional training of staff is an imperative. On\naccount of the criticality of adequate resources in including\nlearners with autism, schools need to collaborate with other\nstakeholder individuals, organizations, and institutions in\npooling requisite resources. Similarly, sensitization of teach-\ners on the available legal framework, technological, human,\ntime, financial, and material resources can enhance support\npractices for including learners with autism in regular ECD\nclasses.\nEthical Approval\nEthical approval to conduct this study was applied for and secured\nfrom the Head Office of the Ministry of Primary and Secondary\nEducation of Zimbabwe, Midlands Provincial Education Office,\nhead teachers of regular primary schools, and participating teachers\nbefore its execution. These parties were provided with information\nto secure the permission to carry out the study.\nInformed Consent\nParticipants were informed about the purpose of this study and pro-\nvided with the option of participation or nonparticipation. They\nwere also guaranteed of their right to withdraw from the study dur-\ning anytime if they so wished.\n"
