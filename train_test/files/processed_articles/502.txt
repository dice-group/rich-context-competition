In addition, abstractors code\nwhether jealousy or distress over an intimate partner's\nrelationship or suspected relationship with another\npersonal led to the homicide (coded as jealousy\n[lover's triangle]).18\nFor the purpose of this study, we limited our\nanalysis to women of reproductive age (15\u00ad54 years)\nfrom the 16 states reporting complete data to the\nNational Violent Death Reporting System. The CDC\nNational Vital Statistics System reports birth and\nmaternal mortality information for women in the\ncategory of \"under 15. \" However, we excluded\nwomen younger than 15 years because of the ex-\ntremely small sample size; the National Violent Death\nReporting System prohibits reporting of cells showing\nor derived from fewer than five deaths (zero cells may\nbe shown) and rates computed from cells containing\nless than 20 deaths or cases. Data were analyzed for\nrent sample available for the National Violent Death\nReporting System.\nThe primary focus of this analysis was to estimate\nthe overall rate of pregnancy-associated homicide and\nsuicide, describe the demographic characteristics of\nthe victims associated with these deaths, and esti-\nmate the prevalence of intimate partner conflict\nrelated to these deaths. We calculated the rates of\npregnancy-associated homicide and suicide by divid-\ning the total number of pregnancy-associated homi-\ncides and suicides, respectively, by the number of live\nbirths in the sample population, using data from the\nnational natality files of the CDC.20 We converted the\nresults to maternal mortality rates by reporting the num-\n1058 Palladino et al Pregnancy-Associated Homicide and Suicide OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY\ntive statistics to report demographic characteristics of\nvictims and the prevalence of intimate partner conflict\nassociated with the pregnancy-associated violent\ndeaths in our sample.

Women 24 years of age and younger\naccounted for more than half (53.9%) of the pregnancy-\nassociated homicides in our sample but make up only\none-third (33.6%) of all live births in the National\nViolent Death Reporting System states (P.01). In\naddition, victims of homicide were significantly more\nlikely to be aged 40 years or older as compared with\nwomen with all live births in the National Violent\nDeath Reporting System states.

Victims of pregnancy-\nassociated intimate partner homicide were signifi-\ncantly more likely to be unmarried as compared with\nall live births. We were unable to compare the\npercentage of women who were Asian or Pacific\nIslander or Native American because of the low\nnumber of deaths in these groups.\nDISCUSSION\nOur results indicate that pregnancy-associated homi-\ncide and suicide each account for more deaths than\nmany other obstetric complications, which may be\nthought of as more \"traditional\" causes of maternal\nmortality, and confirm the need to focus on the\nrelationships between sociodemographic disparities\nand intimate-partner violence with pregnancy-associ-\nated violent death. Our results demonstrate somewhat\nhigher maternal mortality rates than those previously\ndemonstrated in a national perinatal sample.23 Chang\net al23 reported a pregnancy-associated homicide rate\nand 1999 in the Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance\nSystem. Suicides were even less common in their\nsample. These differences may reflect the data collec-\ntion methods used by the two systems. The Pregnancy\nMortality Surveillance System is designed to collect\ndata on all pregnancy-associated deaths, regardless of\ncause. Reporting states use death certificate data or\nmatched death-to-birth certificate data to identify\ndeaths.23 The National Violent Death Reporting Sys-\ntem is designed to collect data specifically associated\nwith violent deaths. Abstractors code pregnancy\nand postpartum status based on findings from the\nvictim's death certificate and the medical examin-\ner's report.18 Mortality rates from other smaller\nstudies of pregnancy-associated violent death have\nbeen closer to our results for suicide deaths and\nhave demonstrated even higher mortality rates for\nDespite these differences in mortality rates be-\ntween the National Violent Death Reporting System\nand Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System, the\ncharacteristics of pregnancy-associated homicide vic-\ntims between the National Violent Death Reporting\nSystem and others, including Pregnancy Mortality\nSurveillance System, are strikingly similar. Victims of\npregnancy-associated homicide are more likely to be\nAfrican American, younger, and unmarried.23,24 In\naddition, our finding of the association between inti-\nmate partner conflict and both pregnancy-associated\nhomicide and suicide has been echoed by several\nthe National Violent Death Reporting System general\npopulation sample, more than one-half of female\nhomicide deaths (59.1%) are associated with intimate-\npartner violence, and more than one-quarter of sui-\ncides in female victims (26.1%) were related to inti-\nmate partner problems.22 In a postpartum study, 38%\nof female homicide victims were killed by a boy-\nfriend, husband, or ex-husband.26\nTable 3.

Although the\nNational Violent Death Reporting System now col-\nlects data from many states, it is not fully nationally\nrepresentative.22 Furthermore, because of the low\nrates of deaths in certain subpopulations (Asian or\nPacific Islander and Native American), we were not\nable to compare data among all ethnic groups. Na-\ntional Violent Death Reporting System abstractors\nare limited by the completeness and quality of the\nreports they receive, and personnel, death certificates,\nand law enforcement protocols may vary from one\njurisdiction to the next. For this reason, the National\nViolent Death Reporting System uses multiple com-\nplementary data sources and abstractors follow de-\nfined National Violent Death Reporting System pri-\nmacy rules in coding data.22 Although the National\nViolent Death Reporting System codes pregnant and\npostpartum status from multiple data sources, preg-\nnancy-associated deaths may still be underreported.\nPregnancies, even if identified, may not be reported\non death certificates, autopsies might not include\nexamination for pregnancy,27 early gestation and late\npostpartum status may be missed on autopsy, and\nfamily members and friends may have been unaware\nof early or unwanted pregnancies. Also, because a\nmajority of female deaths in the National Violent\nDeath Reporting System are coded as unknown preg-\nnancy or postpartum status (67.2%), our results may\nunderestimate the number of pregnancy-associated\nviolent deaths. In addition, we are unable to compare\nthe rates of pregnancy-associated violent death in\npregnant postpartum compared with nonpregnant\nnonpostpartum women because so many deaths were\nclassified as unknown status. Finally, protective factor\ndata would be helpful but are not collected by the\nNational Violent Death Reporting System because\nreports associated with violent death often contain\nonly circumstances associated with risk factors. Our\ndata provide information regarding potential risk\nfactors for maternal violent deaths but cannot prove\ncausation. In addition, this analysis focuses on demo-\ngraphic data and prevalence of intimate partner con-\nflict among victims of pregnancy-associated violent\ndata but did not cover all of the potential precipitating\ncircumstances that may be related to violent death.\nOur future research will involve analyses of other\npotential precipitating circumstances around mater-\nnal violent death, including substance abuse, life\nstress, and mental health diagnoses and treatment.\nDespite these limitations, our study highlights the\nunfortunate but important role of homicide and sui-\ncide as contributors to pregnancy-associated mortal-\nity. These findings suggest that effective prevention\nmethods aimed at perinatal psychosocial health are\nimperative. Unlike some obstetric complications, vi-\nolence is potentially preventable. Research is moving\nforward in developing evidence-based guidelines for\nperinatal depression care,31 identifying successful\nstrategies for engaging and training perinatal health\ncare providers in delivering mental health care32,33\nand engaging perinatal women in receiving mental\nhealth care services.34 Our findings also demonstrate\nthe frequent association of intimate partner conflict\nwith maternal violent death. Intimate-partner vio-\nlence has been associated with adverse outcomes for\nboth woman and neonate, including preterm labor\nand low birth weight, and may contribute to perinatal\nhealth disparities.35 Studies suggest that standardized\nscreening for intimate-partner violence is associated\nwith increased identification rates in pregnant\nwomen, and a recent intervention was shown to lower\nrecurrence risk for intimate-partner violence victim-\nization during pregnancy and the postpartum pe-\nriod.37 With continued focus on maternal violent\ndeath and a continued push toward the development\nof effective psychosocial interventions, particularly\npostscreening care, we may be able to reduce the\neffect of this unfortunate killer on American women,\ntheir children, and their families.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Victims of pregnancy-associated suicide\nwere significantly more likely to be older and white or\nNative American as compared with all live births in\nNational Violent Death Reporting System states.

However, the\nstudy of homicide and suicide has been limited by: 1)\na lack of information concerning victim-to-suspect\nrelationships; 2) studies limited to localized samples;\n3) little information regarding precipitating circum-\nstances to these deaths; and 4) likely underreporting\nof maternal violent deaths, especially because of\nreliance on death certificates alone.10\nWe sought to address these gaps in the literature\nby conducting a secondary data analysis of maternal\nviolent death from the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention's (CDC) National Violent Death Re-\nporting System, a multistate database that collects\ndata on violent deaths, including victim-to-suspect\nrelationships, using multiple complementary data\nsources. This study aims to estimate the rates of\npregnancy-associated (occurring during pregnancy or\nthe first year postpartum) homicide and suicide in a\nmultistate sample; compare these rates with other\ncauses of mortality during the perinatal period; de-\nscribe the demographic characteristics of victims of\npregnancy-associated violent death; and estimate the\nprevalence of intimate partner conflict associated with\nthese maternal deaths.\nAs previous data have suggested a strong associ-\nation between intimate-partner violence and pregnancy-\nassociated homicide, a significant association between\nintimate-partner violence and suicidal tendencies and\nsuicides in women,12\u00ad16 and a potential relationship\nbetween intimate-partner violence and pregnancy-\nassociated suicide exist,17 we hypothesized that inti-\nmate partner conflict may be related to pregnancy-\nassociated violent death. This relationship requires\nthe understanding of victim-to-suspect relationships\nand precipitating circumstances, variables that are\navailable in the National Violent Death Reporting\nSystem.\nWe conducted a secondary data analysis of the Na-\ntional Violent Death Reporting System, a multistate\nactive surveillance system controlled by the CDC.\nThe National Violent Death Reporting System began\ncollecting violent death data in 2003. Participating\nstates collect risk factor data on all violent deaths,\nincluding homicides, suicides, unintentional deaths\nby firearms, legal intervention deaths, and deaths of\nundetermined intent. Seven states participated in\nnumber of participating states increased to 17, includ-\ning South Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina, Vir-\nginia, New Jersey, Maryland, Alaska, Massachusetts,\nOregon, Colorado, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Wis-\nconsin, California, Kentucky, New Mexico, and Utah.\nAll states report statewide data except California,\nwhich gathers information only in a limited number\nThe National Violent Death Reporting System is\nincident-based (not victim-based), meaning that it\ncontains reports related to both victims and suspects\nassociated with a given incident within one incident\nrecord. This links all victims and suspects with a given\nincident, permitting researchers to determine if the\nsuspect was a partner of the victim. The system also\nuses multiple complementary data sources, including\nnot only death certificates but also coroner or medical\nexaminer records and police reports and contains\napproximately 250 unique data elements, including\ndata on victim characteristics and precipitating cir-\ncumstances of death.18 Each state health department's\nNational Violent Death Reporting System office co-\nordinates the abstraction process, which may include\nelectronic transfer of data from primary sources or\nmanual abstraction from the records maintained by\nprimary sources at their offices.18 A coding manual is\nprovided, and coding training is performed annually\nfor all participating states.39 In addition, the CDC\nprovides ongoing coding support through conference\ncalls and an e-mail help desk.39 National Violent\nDeath Reporting System states use multiple abstrac-\ntors to perform blinded reabstraction of cases for\nreliability checks. The CDC also conducts a quality of\ncontrol analysis, with a particular focus on abstractor-\nassigned variables. Further detail related to the Na-\ntional Violent Death Reporting System coding proce-\ndures is available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/\nprofiles/nvdrs.\nThe National Violent Death Reporting System\ncollects information regarding pregnancy or postpar-\ntum status at the time of death. Information regarding\npregnancy status is abstracted from the coroner or\nmedical examiner records and the death certificate.\nThe coding structure of the National Violent Death\nReporting System pregnancy status variable was de-\nsigned to match the U.S. standard death certificate,\nwhich was modified in 2003 to include checkboxes to\ndifferentiate whether a woman was pregnant, within\n42 days postpartum, within 1 year postpartum, or not\npregnant within the past year at the time of death.10\nBy 2005, only five of the participating National Vio-\nlent Death Reporting System states were using this\nversion of the U.S. standard death certificate.19 There-\nfore, two additional responses are available on the\ncoding tree for states with death certificates that do\nnot include a timeline that matches the U.S. standard\ndeath certificate: \"not pregnant, not otherwise speci-\nfied\" and \"pregnant, not otherwise specified.\"18 For\nthe purposes of our analysis, we treated values \"preg-\nnant at the time of death\" and \"pregnant, not other-\nwise specified\" as pregnant at the time of death and\nvalues \"not pregnant but pregnant within 42 days of\ndeath\" and \"not pregnant but pregnant 43 days to 1\nyear before death\" as pregnant within 1 year of death.\nThe CDC/American College of Obstetricians\nand Gynecologists Maternal Mortality Study Group\ndefined the term pregnancy-associated mortality to\ninclude \"any death of a woman while pregnant or\nwithin 1 year of the termination of pregnancy, regard-\nless of cause\"; this includes deaths related and unre-\nlated to pregnancy.4 In keeping with this terminology,\nwe used the terms pregnancy-associated homicide\nand pregnancy-associated suicide to represent deaths\nduring pregnancy or within 1 year postpartum attrib-\nutable to homicide and suicide, respectively. In addi-\ntion, we used the terms pregnancy-associated homi-\ncide rate and pregnancy-associated suicide rate to\nrefer to the number of pregnancy-associated homi-\ntively. We used the term pregnancy-associated violent\ndeath to refer to deaths from homicide and suicide\ncombined. The term \"pregnancy-associated\" refers to\nthe timing of the death and does not mean that the\nhomicide or suicide was caused by pregnancy or\npostpartum status.\nThe National Violent Death Reporting System\ncontains six variables related to intimate-partner vio-\nlence: victim-to-suspect relationship; intimate partner\nproblem (suicides only); perpetrator of interpersonal\nviolence (suicides only); victim of interpersonal vio-\nlence (suicides only); intimate-partner violence\u00adre-\nlated (homicides only); or jealousy (\"lover's triangle, \"\nThe victim-to-suspect relationship is abstracted\nbased on the police report and the coroner or medical\nexaminer records."
