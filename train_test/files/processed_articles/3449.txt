A very simple metalanguage test was designed and administered to 1,180 non-English majors\nat two Japanese private universities. Some of the participants' metalinguistic ability was compared with their standardized\ntest scores. For 639 participants who took the Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) Bridge\u00ae test, their\nreading scores and their metalinguistic ability showed the strongest correlations (r = .66), and for 87 participants whose\nscores from the Visualizing English Language Competency (VELC) test were available, the strongest correlation between the\ntwo tests was also with the reading section (r = .80). The results revealed that even very simple metalanguage, such as noun,\nadverb, and article, was not recognized by many of the participants.\n",

As the number of possible candi-\ndates diminishes, many schools had to compete for new stu-\ndents by diversifying the entrance selection methods and\noften lowering their entrance academic standards. According\nto Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science\njunior colleges, colleges, or universities managed to enter\nhas left many universities having to deal with students who\nare not academically ready for university studies. Ishii,\n11,481 university teachers surveyed recognized declining\nability among students. Of the 87%, 53% felt that this decline\nwas causing some problems, and nearly 8% felt that the\nproblem was serious enough to disrupt operation of classes.\nIn addition to the lowered academic standards for incoming\nuniversity students, changes in Japan's English education\nseemed to have affected students' basic knowledge of\nEnglish. The new Courses of Studies for junior and senior\nhigh school English courses, which emphasize communica-\nfectural English examination results of entering high school\nlevels steadily declined during the 8 years, with the biggest\ndrop in 1998, when new students who went through all 3\nyears of junior high school education under the new Courses\nof Study. According to a report by National Institute of\nMultimedia Education, of approximately 3,500 incoming\nuniversity freshmen at 26 different schools who took their\nEnglish placement test, only 24% of non-English major stu-\ndents at private universities had high school graduate level of\nEnglish proficiency, and 33% had less than junior high\nschool graduate level (Ono, 2005). These reports are based\non paper-based tests on vocabulary and grammar (Saita,\n2003) and listening, vocabulary, grammar, and reading (Ono,\n2005), so they do not directly reflect the communication\nskills of the test takers. However, there is little data suggest-\ning improved English communication proficiency of\nJapanese university students, and with declined ability on\nbasic vocabulary and grammar, it does not seem reasonable\nto hope that communication skills alone may have improved\n(Shite, 2007). The problem here may be that communication-\noriented English education replaced the more traditional\ngrammar instructions instead of being added to it.\n1Fukuoka University, Japan\nCorresponding Author:\nMiki Tokunaga, Language Education and Research Center, Fukuoka\nJapan.\nEmail: tokunagamiki@fukuoka-u.ac.jp\nExploring Metalinguistic Knowledge of\nLow to Intermediate Proficiency EFL\nStudents in Japan\nMiki Tokunaga1\n Keywords\nmetalanguage, grammar terms, explicit knowledge, Japanese EFL learners, Rasch analysis\nCreative Commons CC BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page (http://www.uk.sagepub.com/aboutus/openaccess.htm).\n2 SAGE Open\nExtensive amount of research on effects of different types\nof classroom instructions on language acquisition was con-\nconducted research synthesis and meta-analysis of 77 studies\npublished in 21 different journals and a number of edited\naverage effect sizes from 49 studies with sufficient data indi-\ncated that \"focused L2 instructional treatments consistently\noutperformed a range of control/comparison or baseline con-\nditions by an average of nearly one standard deviation unit (d =\nForms interventions, \"treatments involving an explicit focus\non the rule-governed nature of L2 structures are more effec-\ntive than treatments that do not include such focus\" (p. 195).\nJapanese students have little opportunity to use or be\nexposed to English outside the classes. In a survey of 3,700\nhigh school students (Benesse, 2006), only 6% answered\nthey have ever spoken on the phone in English, 18% have\nwritten an email in English, and 21% have read something on\nthe Internet written in English. In such an English as a\nForeign Language (EFL) environment, explicit instructions\nplay a crucial role to maximize learners' language acquisi-\ntion through practice. In university English classes, difficulty\narises when the students lack basic knowledge assumed by\nteachers to have been covered in junior and senior high\nschools. These students not only lack English proficiency,\nbut they also struggle to understand metalanguage used to\ndescribe the target language in classrooms and in textbooks.\nMetalinguistic knowledge is \"knowledge of technical\nterms such as `verb complement' and semi-technical linguis-\ntic terms such as `sentence'and `clause'\" (Ellis, 2009, p. 38).\nWhile some difficult terms are avoidable, some metalan-\nguage is necessary, especially if high-stake proficiency tests\nassess grammatical accuracy. For example, this study's par-\nticipants at University A had to take the Test of English for\nInternational Communication (TOEIC) Bridge\u00ae test for\ntheir compulsory English classes, and the result of the test\naccounted for 20% of the grade and was the deciding factor\nfor the following year's English class placement. Part 4 of\nthe test has 30 multiple choice sentence completion ques-\ntions, two examples from an official TOEIC Bridge\u00ae work-\nbook (Educational Testing Service, 2008) being,\n1. There are many ( ) accents in England.\na. regions b. regional c. region d. regionally\n2. The flowers in the window box have ( ) three inches in the last\nweek.\na. grown b. grew c. grow d. growth. (p. 53)\nTo explain the answers for such questions, metalanguage\nis essential. English translations of the explanations given in\nthe workbook are as follows:\n1. As the blank is followed by a noun accents, it requires\nan adjective regional to modify the noun.\n2. The phrase in the last week at the end of the sentence\nindicates a period of time in the past, and the have in\nfront of the blank shows that it is a present perfect\nsentence. Present perfect tense is have + past partici-\nple, thus the past participle grown is required.\nWithout basic metalinguistic knowledge such as noun,\nadjective, and present perfect, learners will have difficulty\nunderstanding explanations by teachers and textbooks for\nsuch test items. Before metalanguage can be used to describe\nanother language, metalanguage itself needs describing and\nexplaining to be understood by the audience (Berry, 2005).\nMany recent studies investigating correlations between\nlanguage proficiency and metalinguistic knowledge have\nfound positive correlations between the two. Elder and\n.76) between an L2 metalinguistic knowledge test and L2\nclass achievement of students who were studying Chinese at\nuniversity-level learners of French, compared the results of\noral and written grammaticality judgment tests and a French\nproficiency test. Highest correlations were found between\ntheir judgment tests and cloze sections of proficiency tests,\nwhich tested learners' knowledge of vocabulary, grammar,\nand structure. Roehr (2008) compared the results of a German\nlanguage test and a metalanguage test given to 60 university\nstudents studying German at a British university and found a\nresults of English metalinguistic knowledge tests and three\nEnglish language proficiency tests: computer-based Test of\nEnglish as a Foreign Language (TOEFLCBT); the Diagnostic\nEnglish Language Needs Assessment (DELNA), used at the\nUniversity of Auckland; and International English Language\nTesting System (IELTS). Correlations were significant with\nDELNA's reading component (r = .36), all parts of IELTS,\nespecially the reading section (r = .54), and all parts of\nTOEFL CBT\u00ae (listening r = .49, reading r = .57, structure/\nAlthough many of these previous studies measured meta-\nlinguistic knowledge through learners' ability to find and/or\ndescribe errors in ungrammatical sentences alone or in addi-\ntion to their ability to identify parts of speech, the first pro-\ncess may be too difficult for low-proficiency L2 learners.\nIida, Teele, and Kuwayama (2005) found that their metalan-\nguage test, which asked the participants to find, correct, and\ndescribe errors in sentences, was too difficult for low inter-\nmediate participants with an average TOEIC\u00ae score of 414.\nAs the English proficiency level of the participants of this\nstudy ranged from very low to intermediate level, a simpler\nmetalanguage test was necessary.\nResearch Questions\nThis study aimed to investigate the following two research\nquestions:\nTokunaga 3\nResearch Question 1: Is there a correlation between\nEnglish proficiency test scores and metalinguistic knowl-\nedge among low to intermediate proficiency Japanese\nuniversity students?\nResearch Question 2: What metalinguistic features can\nbe recognized by low to intermediate proficiency Japanese\nuniversity students?\nResearch Method\nParticipants\nA metalanguage test was administered to more than 1,200\nfirst and second year non-English majors at two private\nJapanese universities. English is a compulsory subject in\nJapanese secondary schools, so the participants have had at\nleast 6 years of formal English education. Removing non-\nJapanese students, those who only completed the first page\nof the double-sided test form, and those who did not sign the\nMetalanguage Test\nThe metalanguage test developed by the author had 36 items\nin four sections: (a) parts of speech; (b) parts of sentences;\n(c) tenses, voices, and moods; and (d) other. Participants\nwere asked to look at English sentences and choose a term\nwhich best described the underlined part or the whole sen-\ntence as below:\nChoose the name of parts of speech for the underlined\nword. Some choices may be used more than once, and some\nchoices may not be used at all.\n(A) noun (B) verb (C) adjective (D) adverb (E) auxiliary\nverb (F) article (G) preposition (H) conjunction (I) I don't\nknow\n1. Tom is a teacher. 2. Tom is a teacher.\nFor University B, whose students were expected to have\na higher English proficiency than students at University A,\nanother section with 10 items was added. This section was\nconducted as a pilot for further research on the relationship\nbetween metalinguistic knowledge and grammaticality\njudgment test. Following the format used in Elder (2009),\nand with possibility of increasing the number of partici-\npants in future study in mind, multiple choice format was\nused. Participants were asked to look at the underlined\nparts of English sentences and choose an answer which\nmost appropriately describes the error in each sentence as\nbelow:\nSome sentences below are grammatically incorrect.\nChoose the most appropriate explanation of the error for\neach sentence. Some choices may be used more than once,\nand some choices may not be used at all. (See Table 6 for\nanswer choices.)\n1. I have a friend who brother is a famous singer.\n2. If I see Tom tomorrow, I will ask him about it.\nAnswer choices included \"the sentence is grammatically cor-\nrect,\" and 4 of the 10 sentences were in fact correct.\nInstructions and answer choices were given in Japanese,\nas the purpose of this study was to assess the participants'L2\n(English) metalinguistic knowledge in L1 (Japanese). Most\nof the metalinguistic terms tested were sampled from the\nTOEIC Bridge\u00ae official workbook (Educational Testing\nService, 2008) and the TOEIC Bridge\u00ae official preparation\nguide (Educational Testing Service, 2002), both of which\ngave explanations for questions in Japanese. Additional\nterms that were closely related to the terms used in those\nbooks were added. All items were multiple choice questions\ntesting receptive knowledge of metalanguage without any\nproductive items, as Ellis (2004) points out that measuring\nreceptive rather than productive knowledge of metalanguage\nmay have greater validity because \"it is learners'understand-\ning of explicit linguistic constructs rather than their ability to\narticulate metalinguistic rules that is important where lan-\nguage acquisition and use are concerned\" (p. 267). The same\nanswer choices were used for all questions in each section,\nand all sections' answer choices included I don't know to\nminimize the effect of guessing. Students were encouraged\nto choose I don't know as the results were intended not only\nfor research but also to understand students' needs in class-\nroom and textbook terminology.\nOnly simple, high-frequency words were used to mini-\nmize test difficulty. A vocabulary analysis using Vocabulary\nProfile (Cobb, n.d.; Heatley & Nation, 1994) showed that the\ntest consisted mostly of words from the first 1,000 (87%) and\nsecond 1,000 (6%) word bands of the General Service List\n(West, 1953). Although the rest (7%) were categorized as\noff-list words, these were Tom, New York, movies, and com-\nmon Japanese names Keiko, Tama, and Yumiko. It is unlikely\nthat these interfered with participants understanding of the\nsentences.\nEnglish Proficiency Tests\nAll first and second year students at UniversityAtook TOEIC\nBridge\u00ae test as a schoolwide achievement test, and scores of\n639 participants were available for this study.TOEIC Bridge\u00ae\nis a test developed to assess basic everyday communication\nskills of beginner and intermediate level learners (Institute for\nInternational Business Communication, 2012). For 86 partici-\npants from University B, their scores from VELC (Visualizing\nEnglish Language Competency) test were available. VELC\ntest is a new standardized test recently developed especially\nto evaluate English proficiency of Japanese university stu-\n4 SAGE Open\nResults and Discussion\nRasch Analysis\nRasch analysis using the Winsteps\u00ae software package\n(Linacre, 2010) was conducted on the data from the metalan-\nguage test. Rasch analysis produces measures of item diffi-\nculty and person ability on a common equal interval scale\nmeasured in log-odds units, or logits. Figure 1 shows the\nWinsteps variable map with persons ranked by ability on the\nleft and items by difficulty on the right. A position higher on\nthe scale represents greater ability for a person or greater dif-\nficulty for an item. When person ability precisely matches\nitem difficulty, the person has a 50% expectation of success.\nThe M on each side of the axis shows the mean of person\nability and item difficulty. Participants' mean ability was\nhigher than mean item difficulty, and it can be seen that per-\nsons are distributed a little higher than items. As this test was\nintended to measure metalanguage recognition by low to\nintermediate proficiency learners, the scarcity of more diffi-\ncult items does not significantly affect the quality of this\nstudy. All this means is that higher proficiency students did\nnot have problems with the metalanguage that appeared in\nthis metalanguage test.\nCorrelations With Proficiency Tests\nThe 639 participants' TOEIC Bridge\u00ae test total scores\ndeviation of 19.8. According to Educational Testing Service\ncan only be converted to TOEIC\u00ae scores individually using\nall six sub-scores of the two section test, their conversion\nTOEIC\u00ae tests, showing that the average English proficiency\nof those 86 participants from University B is higher than that\nof the average English proficiency of 639 from University A.\nA Pearson correlation was used to analyze the correlations\nbetween the participants'measures from the metalanguage test\nand listening, reading and total scores from theTOEIC Bridge\u00ae\ntest and VELC test. Moderate to high correlations were found\nbetween the metalanguage test results and all sections of both\nproficiency tests (Table 1). In accordance with findings from\nFigure 1. Variable map showing person abilities on the left and item difficulties on the right.\nNote. Higher measure for persons means higher ability, and higher measure for items means more difficult. Each # shows five persons; . = 1 to 4 persons;\n\u00d7 = 1 item; M = mean; S = 1SD; T = 2SD.\nTokunaga 5\nwith the reading sections (r = .66 for the TOEIC Bridge group;\nr = .80 for the VELC group), which includes items testing\nknowledge of grammar and vocabulary.\nParts of Speech Items\nTable 2 lists the results of the parts of speech section of the\nmetalanguage test from the most difficult to the easiest item.\nThe two most difficult items were slowly in \"The teacher\nspeaks slowly\" and well in \"Yumiko can speak English well.\"\nThe most common erroneous response for both the adverb\nitems was adjective. There were two items testing for adjec-\ntives, kind in \"The teacher is kind\" and small in \"There is a\nsmall box on the desk.\" Although the difficulties of those\nitems were not as high as the adverb items, they were com-\nmonly mistaken for adverbs. This confusion between adjec-\ntives and adverbs may be considered negligible, especially\nfor the low-proficiency learners. However, the difference is\noften tested in English proficiency tests such as TOEIC\u00ae and\nTOEIC Bridge\u00ae. Also, because of the non-saliency of the\ndifferences in their forms and the redundancy to sentence\nmeanings, they are difficult to be noticed by learners, requir-\ning instruction for more successful language learning\nThe third most difficult item was the in \"The box is small\"\nmon wrong response was preposition, probably because those\nare also small function words. The difficulty of using English\narticles by Japanese learners has long been recognized and\nYamada & Matsuura, 1982). However, because of the diffi-\nculty, special attention is usually given in teaching of articles.\nIt seems futile trying to teach or learn how to use articles\nwhen the learners do not know which words are articles, espe-\ncially when there are only three of them: a, an, and the.\nThere were two auxiliary verb items, \"I will call you\ntomorrow\" and \"Yumiko can speak English well,\" and they\nwere the fifth and sixth most difficult items in this section.\nThe preposition on in \"There is a small box on the desk\" was\none of the easiest items in this section with 967 correct\nresponses. The easiest items in this section were the three\nnouns, but even those did not have 100% recognition. While\n1,152 participants correctly recognized the name Tom in\n\"Tom is a teacher\" as a noun, correct responses for box in\n\"The box is small\" decreased to 1,105, indicating that some\nparticipants confuse nouns with names. The word teacher in\n\"Tom is a teacher\" had even less correct responses, probably\nbecause of the location of the word in the sentence. Some\nparticipants seem to assume that nouns are always subjects.\nParts of Sentence Items\nThe parts of sentence section was included because the five\nsentence patterns S (subject) + V (predicate verb), S + V + C\n(complement), S + V + O (object), S + V + O + O, and S +\nV + O + C are very commonly used in Japan to teach English\nsentence structures. Table 3 lists the parts of sentence pat-\ntern items in order of the most difficult to easiest. The seven\nitems only tested complements and objects because subjects\nand predicate verbs were found to be too easy during pilot-\ning. The results show that the majority of participants had\ndifficulty distinguishing between complements and objects,\nwhich probably requires grammatical knowledge rather than\nmetalinguistic knowledge alone. The bigger concern here is\nlower ability participants choosing subjects and predicate\nverbs, suggesting that those participants did not know what\nsubjects and verbs of sentences were. Whether the ability to\ndistinguish those five sentence patterns can help improve\nlearners' language skills is an issue beyond the scope of this\nstudy, but not recognizing the names of these parts could\nhinder learning, as they are very frequently used in\nexplanations.\nTense, Mood, and Voice Items\nTable 4 lists items from the third section of the metalanguage\ntest: tenses, moods, and voices, also in order of item diffi-\nculty. As expected, causative was the most difficult with only\n127 correct responses and the highest difficulty of 3.39 logits\nof the whole test. The most common erroneous response for\nthis item was past perfect (n = 844). As past perfect is usually\ntaught and memorized as \"had + past participle,\" it is under-\nstandable that this item was wrongly recognized as one. At\nthe same time, this suggests the possible overgeneralization\nof grammar terms, as we see more examples in this section.\nThere was another causative item, \"She made her brother\nclean her room,\" but this item was significantly easier than\nthe first item, possibly because of the presence of two peo-\nple. The common errors for this item was passive (n = 105)\nand past perfect (n = 68). Distinction between sentences with\npast participles seems to be the problem, as the passive sen-\ntence \"The book was written by a famous writer\" and the\npresent perfect sentence \"I have finished my lunch\" both had\npast perfect as the most common errors. These overgeneral-\nizations could be a result of memorizing grammar rules with-\nout enough input or meaningful output practices.\nTable 1.

TOEIC = Test of English for International Communication; VELC =\nVisualizing English Language Competency. p < .01 (two-tailed).\n6 SAGE Open\nThe second and third most difficult items were participle\nconstruction sentences, one with a past participle and the\nother with a present participle. For both items, many partici-\npants chose interrogative. Interrogative sentences were not\nincluded as test items because the construction of interroga-\ntive sentences, starting with a base form of a verb with no\nsubject, seemed too simple. However, the results suggest that\nparticiple construction sentences were incorrectly recognized\nas interrogative sentences because they do not have a subject\nat the beginning and start with participles, which look like\nverbs. Although not a very easy sentence structure for\nJapanese learners of English to use, the subjunctive sentence\n\"If I were you, I would study harder\" was the second easiest\nitem in this section and the fifth easiest in the whole test. The\npresence of if has most likely helped the recognition.\nThe item with the lowest difficulty in this section was \"I\npants correctly recognizing it as a future sentence. If we look\nback in the first section of the test, will as an auxiliary was not\nso well recognized. While the item difficulty of will as a future\nTable 3.

This suggests that future function of the\nword will was more easily recognized than the grammar term\nof it. This could be a result of more communication-focused\ninstruction in secondary schools, and understanding the mean-\ning is more useful than knowing the linguistic term of the\nword. However, not knowing the grammatical function of the\nword could mean that they are not able to generalize its usage\n(i.e., will is followed by a base form of a verb, it is inverted to\nthe front of the sentence for questions, etc.) with other auxil-\niary verbs.\nOther Items\nThe last section intentionally included items for which con-\nfusion with similar terms were expected, and the results\n(Table 5) were not surprising. The most difficult item in this\nsection was antecedent of a relative clause, \"The woman\nwho is wearing a red dress is my sister,\" with only 383 cor-\nrect responses. Not knowing the term antecedent probably\ncauses very little harm, and it can always be explained as\n\"the noun described by the relative clause.\" However,\namong the wrong responses, overwhelming 511 chose sub-\nject pronoun, followed by 77 choosing possessive pronoun\nand 62 choosing object pronoun, raising concerns for the\nparticipants' understanding of pronouns. There were two\npronoun items in this section, he and his in \"He has finished\nhis work.\" Even though the subject pronoun he was the\neasiest item in this section, close to 150 participants\nanswered wrong with 53 choosing I don't know and 41\nchoosing antecedent. The possessive pronoun his, however,\nwas the third most difficult item in this section. While only\n95 chose subject pronoun. Because there are only limited\nnumber of pronouns, memorizing the terms and forms\nwould be worth more than the confusion and error caused\nwithout the knowledge.\nThe second most difficult item in this section was watch-\ning in \"I like watching movies\" as a gerund, and as expected,\nthe most common wrong response was present participle.\nThe opposite error of choosing gerund for present participle\nsleeping in the sentence \"The baby is sleeping\" was the\nfourth most difficult item in this section. The fifth was fin-\nished in \"He has finished his work.\" The verb with the same\npast and participle forms was chosen intentionally, and it was\nindeed confused with the past form. The opposite case with\nslept in \"The baby slept all night\" as a past form of the verb\nhad 275 participants choose past participle. The confusion\nwas also tested with a verb with different forms of past and\npast participle, written in \"The book was written by a famous\nwriter\" but this was the second least difficult item in this sec-\ntion. The last set of items in this section was the word who as\nan interrogative and a relative pronoun in \"The woman who\nis wearing a red dress is my sister\" and \"Who is that woman?\"\nrespectively. As expected, those two terms were mistaken for\neach other, with 84 responding as interrogative for relative\npronoun, and 71 doing the opposite.\nGrammaticality Judgment Section\nThis last section of 10 items were only given to participants\ngrammaticality judgment items had higher item difficulties.\nThe most difficult item was an error in participle construc-\ntion sentence, \"Look out the window of a bus, Keiko saw a\ncar accident.\" However, there were 79 erroneous responses\nchoosing \"the verb should be a gerund,\" which would pro-\nduce the same form as the correct response, \"the verb should\nbe a present participle form.\" The same can be said for the\nfifth difficult item, \"Tom is going to have his car fix.\" There\nwere 32 responses choosing to change the verb to its past\nform, which is the same as its past participle form.\nThe second most difficult item in this section was an item\ncorrecting a verb tense in a subjunctive sentence, \"If you\nTable 5. Other Items in Item Difficulty Order (N = 1,180).\nItem Item difficulty (logit) Correct (n) Common wrong responses (n)\nThe woman who is wearing a red\ndress is my sister.\nThe woman who is wearing a red\ndress is my sister.\nThe book was written by a\nfamous writer.\n8 SAGE Open\nhave a lot of money, what would you buy?\" with an item dif-\nficulty of 2.43 logits. There was also one correct subjunctive\nsentence in this section, but many participants wanted to\nchange the tense of the verb, making its item difficulty 1.49\nlogits. This suggests that even if a subjunctive sentence with\nif was easy to recognize with an item difficulty of -1.89 log-\nits (Table 4), correct structures of subjunctive sentences may\nnot be well understood by the participants of this study.\nSomething similar can be said for relative pronoun, which\nwas easy to recognize with an item difficulty of -1.07 logits\nin the previous section (Table 5). The erroneous responses\nfor three relative clause items in this section suggest that the\nrecognition of relative pronouns does not guarantee the\nunderstanding of how they are used.\nThe causative sentences were found to be difficult to iden-\ntify and were confused with perfect sentences in the previous\nsection (Table 4). In this section, the correct causative sen-\ntence \"I will have my staff call you by tomorrow night\" was\nthe third most difficult item, and again, it was confused with\nperfect sentence, with 78 participants wanting to change the\nverb to its past participle form.\nConclusion and Implications\nThis research addressed two questions: Is there a correlation\nbetween English proficiency test scores and metalinguistic\nknowledge among low proficiency students, and what meta-\nlinguistic features can low proficiency students typically rec-\nognize? The results supported the findings of other recent\nbetween metalinguistic knowledge and proficiency test\nresults in more advanced learners, and found significant cor-\nrelations between students' proficiency test scores and meta-\nlinguistic knowledge. The strongest correlation found with\nboth TOEIC Bridge\u00ae test and VELC test were with their\nreading sections, also supporting previous findings. The\nparticipants in this study had difficulty identifying basic\nparts of speech and parts of sentences, and showed confusion\nwith similar sentence structures and other grammar terms,\nsuggesting that many of them lack the metalinguistic knowl-\nedge to understand explanations given by teachers and text-\nbooks done using similar metalanguage. Also, the results of\nthe grammaticality judgment items suggest that knowing the\nmetalanguage does not equal to full understanding of the\ngrammatical structures. This means that teaching of metalan-\nguage for its own sake is of little use.\nWith that in mind, an important point to consider is which\nmetalanguage should be taught and used and which should\nbe avoided. With the spread of communicative language\nteaching and the controversy over the effectiveness of\nexplicit instruction in the past, the use and knowledge of\nmetalanguage have \"suffered increasing marginalization and\nHowever, as described in the previous sections, recent stud-\nies have shown correlations between learners' metalinguistic\nknowledge and their general language proficiency. Hu\n(2011), finding strong correlations (r = .72) between Chinese\nEnglish as a Second Language (ESL) learners' knowledge of\nmetalanguage and their ability to verbally describe English\ngrammar rules, suggests that \"the availability of a working\nmetalanguage was an aid to, rather than a distracting influ-\nence on, the participants' internalization of explicit gram-\nmar\" (p. 73). When a student prepares for an important\nproficiency test such as TOEIC\u00ae, which has a grammar\ncomponent, how can we explain why one of the answer\nchoices is correct without the use of some metalanguage?\nHow can we guide our students to write or speak more accu-\nrately? Is it possible to avoid using metalanguage completely\nand still give clear and precise explanations? Using metalan-\nguage can also make it possible to generalize grammar rules\nand allows the learner to apply the same rule in different sen-\ntences with different words as Hu (2010) describes:\nTable 6.

L = I don't know; G = The verb should be a present participle form; A = The sentence is grammatically correct; I = The verb should be a gerund; H\n= The verb should be a past participle form; D = The verb should be in its past form; B = The adjective should be an adverb; E = The verb should have a\nthird-person-s; J = The relative pronoun should be which; F = The verb should be will + base form (future); K = The relative pronoun should be whose.\nTokunaga 9\n. . . the explanatory precision with which a metalinguistic\ngeneralization can be made and the efficient delimitation of the\ncontexts to which the generalization applies. Metalingual terms\nthat are appropriately used can pre-empt both under-and\novergeneralization of the rules in question. (p. 181)\nThere are, however, cases in which the use of metalan-\nguage can confuse more than assist. As several examples\nshowed in the results of the current metalanguage test, mis-\nunderstanding and overgeneralization of grammar rules can\nresult from giving the rules without sufficient explanations\nand examples. Also, some of the technical metalanguage,\nsuch as antecedent, can easily be replaced with simpler\nterms. Also, the terms past participle and present participle\ncould do more damage than good, as \"present\" participles\nare not always used with present sentences and \"past\" parti-\nciples are not always used with past sentences. In this current\nstudy, for example, 199 participants thought \"I have finished\nmy lunch\" was a past perfect sentence, most likely from the\npast participle finished. For such terms that have confusing\nnames but are necessary in instruction, less-confusing names\nthat can still be commonly understood by both teachers and\nlearners may have to be established in class.\nThe findings in this study can support the importance of\nmetalanguage in second language acquisition, which has\nbeen regaining attention (Elder, 2009; Elder & Manwaring,\n2008) in a field in which explicit grammar teaching has\nsomehow been sidelined in the shadow of communicative\nlanguage teaching. Recognizing the importance of metalan-\nguage and explicit knowledge does not advocate the teaching\nof metalanguage with the goal of learning metalanguage for\nits own sake or a return to a teacher-centered grammar trans-\nlation methodology. How much or how little metalanguage\nshould be used would vary in different situations, but what is\nimportant is that the metalanguage used is understood by\neveryone. Investigating metalinguistic knowledge of under-\ngraduates in Hong Kong, Berry (1997) found wide differ-\nences between learners in their knowledge, and wide\ndiscrepancies between learners'knowledge and their English\nteachers' expectations, which overestimated learners' actual\nknowledge. Along with teaching learners necessary termi-\nnology, he emphasizes the importance of giving awareness\ntraining to teachers so they would realize that their classroom\nlanguage could be creating problems in their classrooms.\nHaving access to metalanguage \"may help sharpen under-\nallowing teachers and learners to talk about the target lan-\nguage with more precision when explaining, clarifying, prac-\nticing, using, and reflecting on the use of the language in\ndifferent types of teaching and learning styles.\n"
