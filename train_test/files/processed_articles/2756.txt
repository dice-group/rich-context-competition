    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Sedentary behavior (SB) is, irrespective of a person's physical activity levels, associated with a wide\nrange of deleterious outcomes such as diabetes, stroke and associated premature mortality. There are no nationally\nrepresentative, multi-national, population-based studies investigating the relationship between SB, chronic\nconditions, and physical multimorbidity (i.e., two or more chronic physical conditions). Thus, this cross-sectional\nstudy aimed to assess the association between chronic conditions, physical multimorbidity and SB among\ncommunity-dwelling adults in six low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We also explored the influential\nfactors of these relationships.\nMethod: The Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) survey included 34,129 adults aged 50 years. SB\nwas self-reported and expressed as a categorical variable [<8 or 8 h per day (high SB)]. Eleven chronic physical\nconditions (angina, arthritis, asthma, chronic back pain, chronic lung disease, diabetes, edentulism, hearing\nproblems, hypertension, stroke, visual impairment) were assessed. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation\nanalyses were conducted.\n(9.7%\u00ad12.1%), respectively. The prevalence of high SB increased in a linear fashion from 7.1% in people with no\nchronic condition to 24.1% in those with 4 chronic conditions. In the multivariable analysis, visual impairment\nwith high SB. Disability explained more than 50% of the association for all chronic conditions with particularly high\npercentages (>80%) for arthritis, asthma, and multimorbdity. Mobility problems explained 88.1% and 85.1% of the\nassociation of SB with arthritis and physical multimorbidiy, respectively. Pain was highly influential in the SB-arthritis\nrelationship (85.6%). Sleep/energy problems explained between 9.3% (stroke) to 49.1% (arthritis) of the association,\nand cognitive problems from 21.5% (stroke) to 33.4% (hearing problems). Findings for anxiety and depression were\nmixed.\nConclusion: In LMICs, those with chronic conditions and physical multimorbidity are significantly more sedentary.\nTargeted messages to reduce time spent sedentary among individuals with chronic conditions may ameliorate\nassociated disability, mobility difficulties and pain that are themselves the most important risk factors for SB.\n",

International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity\nBackground\nThe average life expectancy is increasing worldwide [1].\nIrrespective of the socioeconomic development of a\ncountry, the main causes of death and disability in\nmiddle-aged to older adults (i.e. 50 years or older) are\nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs), many of which often\noccur in combination [2]. The co-occurrence of two or\nmore chronic physical conditions is known as physical\nmultimorbidity [3]. With increasing population and life\nexpectancy, the disease burden of physical multimorbidity\nto both individuals and societies are increasing [4]. Al-\nthough data are scarce, in low- and middle-income coun-\ntries (LMICs) about half of middle-aged to older adults\nexperience physical multimorbidity (i.e. 2 or more chronic\nconditions), about 25% have at least three, and about 10%\nfour or more chronic conditions [5]. Physical multimor-\nbidity is an important risk concept as it is associated with\na lower quality of life [6], increased health-care utilization\nand costs [7], and ultimately, higher risk for premature\nmortality [8]. There is a consensus that in the years to\ncome, this disease burden will be greatest in LMICs [9],\nbut knowledge on physical multimorbidity from LMICs is\nlimited compared with HICs (95% of the available studies\nare from HICs), despite the fact that nearly 80% of NCD\nrelated deaths occur in LMICs [10].\nThe promotion of physical activity is an essential strat-\negy within the multifaceted care of middle-aged to older\nadults for the prevention and management of chronic\ndisease and physical multimorbidity [11]. Regular phys-\nical activity contributes to the primary and secondary\nprevention of a wide range of chronic diseases [12], im-\nproves quality of life [13], and is associated with reduced\nrisk of premature death [14]. There is also increasing\nevidence demonstrating that sedentary behavior (SB)\nshould be considered in this multifaceted care as it is, ir-\nrespective of a person's physical activity levels, associated\nwith a wide range of deleterious outcomes such as dia-\nbetes, stroke and associated premature mortality [15].\nSB refers to any waking behavior characterized by an\nenergy expenditure 1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs),\nwhile in a sitting, reclining or lying posture [16]. SB is\nhighly prevalent and pervasive in societies across the\nworld [17, 18]. A recent systematic review, virtually\nexclusively among western societies, demonstrated that\nmiddle-aged to older adults spend 65\u00ad80% of their\nwaking day being sedentary [19].\nResearch investigating the relationship between SB\nand chronic diseases has solely focused on high-income\ncountries. In addition, there is a particular dearth of re-\nsearch on SB and physical multimorbidity. In the only\nstudy on this topic to date, among 2048 American adults\nincrease in SB was associated with an 11% (adjusted OR\nbeing multimorbid (i.e. having 2 morbidities) [20].\nMoreover, the authors found that SB was associated with\nmultimorbidity independent of light-intensity physical\nactivity and adherence to moderate-to-vigorous physical\nactivity guidelines, which underscores the importance of\nminimizing prolonged SB (in addition to promoting\nphysical activity) in the treatment of multimorbidity.\nThe lack of nationally representative population-based\nstudies investigating the associations between SB, chronic\nconditions, and physical multimorbidity in LMICs is an\nimportant research gap given the rapid increase in chronic\ndiseases in these countries, mainly due to changes in life-\nstyle [21]. Furthermore, the association between chronic\nconditions or multimorbidity on SB may differ in LMICs\ndue to different disease profiles [22], suboptimal treatment\nof chronic conditions [23, 24], and differences in know-\nledge regarding the risks of being sedentary [25]. In\naddition, at the population level, there is a paucity of infor-\nmation on factors that might influence the relationship\nbetween SB, chronic diseases and physical multimorbidity.\nIn this study we focused on physical (mobility, disability,\npain and discomfort) and mental (cognition, sleep and en-\nergy, anxiety and depression) conditions as these variables\nhave all been associated with SB [26, 27] and the presence\nof chronic conditions [5]. Given the aforementioned gaps\nwithin the literature, we aimed to assess the association\nbetween chronic conditions or physical multimorbidity\nand SB among community-dwelling adults aged 50 or\nolder in six LMICs, and to assess the factors that might in-\nfluence this relationship. We hypothesize that higher\nlevels of SB are associated with the presence of chronic\nconditions and physical multimorbidity.\nMethods\nThe survey\nData from the SAGE were analyzed. This survey was\nundertaken in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, and\nWorld Bank classification at the time of the survey, all\nof these countries were LMICs. Details of the survey\nmethodology have been published elsewhere [28]. In\nbrief, in order to obtain nationally representative sam-\nples, a multistage clustered sampling design method was\nused. The sample consisted of adults aged 18 years\nwith oversampling of those aged 50 years. Trained in-\nterviewers conducted face-to-face interviews using a\nstandard questionnaire. Standard translation procedures\nwere undertaken to ensure comparability between coun-\ntries. If a respondent was unable to undertake the inter-\nview because of limited cognitive function, then a\nseparate questionnaire was administered to a proxy re-\nspondent. These individuals were not included in the\ncurrent study. The survey response rate ranged from\n51% (Mexico) to 93% (China). Sampling weights were\nconstructed to adjust for the population structure as\nreported by the United Nations Statistical Division.\nEthical approval was obtained from the WHO Ethical\nReview Committee and local ethics research review\nboards. Written informed consent was obtained from\nall participants.\nSedentary behaviour (outcome variable)\nIn order to assess SB, participants were asked to state\nthe total time they usually spent (expressed in minutes\nper day) sitting or reclining including at work, at home,\ngetting to and from places, or with friends (e.g. sitting at\na desk, sitting with friends, travelling in car, bus, train,\nreading, playing cards or watching television). This did\nnot include time spent sleeping. The variable on SB was\nused in the analysis as a categorical [<8 (coded 0) or\n8 h (coded 1) per day] variable. The eight-hour cut-off\nwas chosen as previous research indicated that being\nsedentary for 8 h/day in the general population is asso-\nciated with a higher risk for premature mortality [29].\nChronic conditions and physical multimorbidity (exposures)\nEleven chronic physical conditions (angina, arthritis,\nasthma, chronic back pain, chronic lung disease, diabetes,\nedentulism, hearing problems, hypertension, stroke, visual\nimpairment) were assessed. Chronic back pain was de-\nfined as having had back pain everyday during the last\n30 days. Respondents who answered affirmatively to the\nquestion \"Have you lost all of your natural teeth?\" were\nconsidered to have edentulism. The participant was con-\nsidered to have hearing problems if the interviewer ob-\nserved this condition during the survey. Blood pressure\nwas measured three times with a one-minute interval with\nthe use of a wrist blood pressure monitor (Medistar Wrist\nBlood Pressure Model S) and the mean value of the three\nmeasurements was calculated. Hypertension was defined\nas having at least one of the following: systolic blood pres-\nsure  140 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure  90 mmHg;\nor self-reported diagnosis. Visual impairment was defined\nas having extreme difficulty in seeing and recognizing a\nperson that the participant knows across the road [30]. A\nvalidity study showed that this response likely corresponds\nlogMAR) [30]. Diabetes and stroke were solely based on\nlifetime self-reported diagnosis.\nFor other conditions, the participant was considered\nto have the condition in the presence of either one of\nthe following: self-reported diagnosis; or symptom-based\ndiagnosis based on algorithms. We used these algo-\nrithms, which have been used in previous studies using\nthe same dataset, to detect undiagnosed cases [31, 32].\nSpecifically, the validated Rose questionnaire was used\nfor angina [33], and other previously validated symptom-\nbased algorithms were used for arthritis, asthma, and\nchronic lung disease [31, 34]. The questions used to\nassess self-reported diagnosis and the symptom-based\nalgorithms are provided in Additional file 1: Tables S1\nand S2. The total number of chronic conditions was cal-\nculated and categorized as 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Multimor-\nbidity was defined as 2 chronic conditions [32].\nMediators\nHealth status\nHealth status was evaluated with eight health-related\nquestions pertaining to four health domains including:\n(a) mobility; (b) pain and discomfort; (c) cognition; and\n(d) sleep and energy. Each of the four domains corre-\nsponds to those in common health related quality of life\noutcome measures such as the Short Form-12 (SF-12)\n[35], the Health Utilities Index Mark-3 (HUI) [36] and\nthe EUROQOL-5D [37]. Each domain consists of two\nquestions that assessed health function in the past\n30 days. The actual questions can be found in\nAdditional file 1: Table S3. Each item was scored on a\nfive-point scale ranging from `none' to `extreme/cannot\ndo'. For each separate domain, we used factor analysis\nwith polychoric correlations to obtain a factor score\nwhich was later converted to scores ranging from 0 to\n100 with higher values representing worse health func-\nAnxiety\nIn accordance with previous publications using a dataset\nwith the identical question, those who claimed to have\nsevere/extreme problems with worry or anxiety in the\nDepression\nQuestions based on the World Mental Health Survey\nversion of the Composite International Diagnostic Inter-\nview [42] were used for the endorsement of past 12-\nmonth DSM-IV depression using the same algorithm\nused in previous studies using the same dataset [32, 43]\n(Details provided in Additional file 1: Table S4).\nDisability\nDisability was assessed by the use of the 12-item\nvalidated version of the World Health Organization\nDisability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0)\n[44]. Item Response Theory analysis was used to create a\nscale ranging from 0 (no disability) to 100 (maximum\nControl variables\nThese included sex, age, wealth, highest level of educa-\ntion achieved (primary, secondary, tertiary), setting\n(urban or rural), living arrangement (alone or not), and\nemployment status (engaged in paid work 2 days in last\n7 days: Y/N). Wealth quintiles were created based on\ncountry-specific income.\nStatistical analysis\nThe statistical analysis was performed with Stata 14.1\n(Stata Corp LP, College station, Texas). The analysis\nwas restricted to those aged 50 years given the high\nprevalence of chronic physical conditions in this age\ngroup. We conducted multivariable logistic regression\nanalysis to assess the association between the number\nof chronic conditions including physical multimorbidity\n(2 chronic physical conditions) or each of the 11\nchronic conditions (exposure variables) and sedentary\nbehavior (outcome). Analyses using the overall sample\nin order to gain an understanding of the extent to\nwhich various factors may explain the relation of indi-\nvidual chronic conditions and physical multimorbidity\nwith SB, we conducted mediation analysis using the\noverall sample. We did not conduct this analysis for an-\ngina, diabetes, edentulism, and hypertension as these\nconditions were not significantly associated with SB in\nthe overall sample. We focused on anxiety, cognition,\ndepression, disability, mobility, pain/discomfort, and\nsleep/energy for their previously reported association\nwith the exposure (chronic physical conditions) and the\noutcome (sedentary behavior). We used the khb\n(Karlson Holm Breen) command in Stata [46] for this\npurpose. This method can be applied in logistic regres-\nsion models and decomposes the total effect (i.e., un-\nadjusted for the influential factor) of a variable into\ndirect (i.e. the effect of chronic conditions or multimor-\nbidity on SB adjusted for the factor) and indirect effects\n(i.e. the mediational effect). Using this method, the per-\ncentage of the main association explained by the medi-\nator can also be calculated. Each potential mediator\nwas included in the model individually. All regression\nanalyses were adjusted for sex, age, education, wealth,\nsetting, unemployment, living arrangement, and coun-\ntry. Country adjustment was done by including dummy\nvariables for each country. When the individual chronic\nconditions were the exposure variable, the models were\nalso adjusted for the presence of other chronic illness\nto account for comorbid chronic conditions. This vari-\nable included information on whether the individual\nhad any of the other ten chronic conditions (Y/N). All\nvariables were included in the models as categorical\nvariables with the exception of age, pain/discomfort,\ncognition, sleep/energy, and disability (continuous\nvariables). Under 5% of the data were missing for the\nvariables used in the analysis. Complete-case analysis\nwas done. The sample weighting and the complex study\ndesign were taken into account in the analyses. Results\nfrom the regression analyses are presented as odds\nratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The\nlevel of statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.\nResults\nThe final analytical sample consisted of 34,129 individ-\nlence of physical multimorbidity and high SB (i.e. 8 h/\nrespectively (Table 1).\nThe prevalence of high SB increased in a linear fashion\nwith an increasing number of chronic conditions ranging\nfrom 7.1% in people with no chronic condition to 24.1%\nin those with 4 or more chronic conditions (Fig. 1).\nThe results of the multivariable logistic regression ana-\nlysis assessing the association between chronic condi-\ntions or physical multimorbidity and high SB are\npresented in Table 2.

In terms of the number of chronic con-\nditions, in the overall sample, compared to those who no\nchronic conditions, the presence of one or 2 chronic\nconditions was not significantly associated with high SB\nSB.

The current\ndata confirm the findings from a previous study con-\nducted in a high-income country showing that SB is as-\nsociated with a higher risk for physical multimorbidity\n[20]. We found that most chronic conditions were asso-\nciated with a high SB status (i.e. eight or more hours per\nday) in the overall sample, although this relationship was\nmost notable among the oldest population (i.e. 65 years\nor older). Our mediation analysis showed that disability\nFig. 1 Prevalence of highly sedentary behavior by number of\nchronic physical conditions. Estimates are based on weighted\nsample.

As for physical multimorbidity,\ndisability, mobility difficulties and pain were also import-\nant factors mediating high SB.

The factors\nidentified in our study, which may explain the relation-\nship between chronic conditions and physical multimor-\nbidity with SB, should however be confirmed in\nprospective studies.\nIn the overall sample, those with arthritis (OR = 1.22)\nand chronic back pain (OR = 1.70) were more likely to\nTable 3 Mental health (anxiety, cognition, depression, sleep/energy) variables as mediators in the association between chronic\nconditions (multimorbidity) and highly sedentary behavior among adults aged 50 years\nTotal effect Direct effect Indirect effect\nExposure Mediator OR [95% CI] P-value OR [95% CI] P-value OR [95% CI] P-value % Mediated\nAbbreviation: OR Odds ratio, CI Confidence interval\nHighly sedentary behavior referred to being sedentary for 8 h/day\nModels are adjusted for sex, age, education, wealth, setting, unemployment, living arrangement, and country.

These re-\nlationships appear to be mainly explained by disability,\nmobility difficulties, and pain while cognitive problems,\ndepressive feelings, and sleep problems may also play a\nrole. In both conditions, pain might cause mobility and\nsleep problems and ultimately feelings of depression,\nwhich in turn can all result in people being more sed-\nentary. Previous literature in Western populations has\ndemonstrated that pain can result in mobility limita-\ntions, higher levels of SB [47], and depression [48].\nClearly, such an interplay of pain, mobility limitations\nand depression among people with physical multimor-\nbidity could play an even more pronounced role. Next\nto this, some SBs such as TV viewing, have been linked\npreviously to poorer cognitive function in middle-aged\nto older adults [49], although this is largely drawn from\nhigh-income populations. The reason why adults with\ncognitive problems are more likely to be sedentary is\nlargely unknown, but clearly this warrants further ex-\nploration. One possible explanation is that cognitive\nproblems, such as impairments in executive functioning\ncan result in difficulties in planning complex behaviors\nand consequently there might be an increased risk of\nfalls [50]. Falls are on its turn associated with a fear of\nfalling again and avoidance of activities due to this fear,\nwhich is also associated with grey matter volume loss\n[51, 52]. In the case of arthritis, cognitive problems\nmay be linked to SB via comorbid cardiovascular risk\nfactors or systemic inflammatory processes [53, 54].\nSedentary time and the number of sedentary bouts per\nday (i.e. 20 min) are associated with an increased 10-\nyear cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in people with\nTable 4 Disability, mobility, and pain/discomfort as mediators in the association between chronic conditions (multimorbidity) and\nhighly sedentary behavior among adults aged 50 years\nTotal effect Direct effect Indirect effect\nExposure Mediator OR [95% CI] P-value OR [95% CI] P-value OR [95% CI] P-value % Mediated\nAbbreviation: OR Odds ratio, CI Confidence interval\nHighly sedentary behavior referred to being sedentary for 8 h/day\nModels are adjusted for sex, age, education, wealth, setting, unemployment, living arrangement, and country.

It is known that many\nindividuals with asthma avoid physical activities for\nfear of exacerbating symptoms or triggering physical\nactivity-induced bronchoconstriction [56]. Studies\nhave shown that replacing SB with light intensity\nphysical activity can however improve asthma control\nand asthma-related quality of life [56], and is a pos-\nsible protective factor against asthma development\n[57]. As people with asthma are at an increased risk\nfor mobility problems and musculoskeletal pain [58],\ninterventions focusing on reducing this pain, discom-\nfort and mobility problems are probably essential as\nwell to reduce the time spent sedentary. Not only\nasthma, but also other chronic lung diseases such as\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may\ninduce mobility difficulties, pain, or disability. These\nfactors may predispose an individual to be more so-\ncially isolated due to their restrictions in ability to\nconduct activities of daily living or stigmatized as re-\nspiratory symptoms are often associated with tubercu-\nlosis in LMICs [59].\nFor over a decade, targeting increases in moderate to\nvigorous physical activity has been the emphasis of a\nlarge number of exercise training and behavior change\ninterventions in people with COPD [60], but with lim-\nited success [61]. The lower levels of physical activity\ncoupled with the often fragile physical and psychological\nhealth among patients with COPD may make reducing\nSB a more suitable conduit for behavior change [62, 63].\nIn our study, people with COPD had 1.48 times higher\nodds for being sedentary eight or more hours. Recent\nevidence showed as well that SB is an independent pre-\ndictor of mortality in subjects with COPD, even adjust-\ning for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and a\nnumber of other variables. Mortality was four times\nhigher in subjects with COPD who spend 8.5 h/d in ac-\ntivities requiring <1.5 MET [64]. Therefore, there is an\nurgent need to test interventions to reduce SB including\nthe provision of information about the health conse-\nStroke was associated with a 2.0 times higher odds for\nhigh SB in our study. A previous qualitative study in\nCanadian stroke survivors [66] demonstrated that there\nis also limited awareness of health risks of SB among\nstroke survivors.\nFinally, we also found significant associations between\nhighly sedentary status and hearing problems and visual\nimpairments. Hearing problems [67] and visual impair-\nments [68] should therefore be considered as important\nrisk conditions for SB in LMICs. Stigma and discrimin-\nation associated with these chronic conditions and a lack\nof social support may complicate daily life participation\nin these populations.\nPractical implications and future research\nOur analyses provide further evidence for the need to\ndevelop strategies to deal with a sedentary lifestyle in\nLMICs, and offer important hypotheses for testing in\nfuture prospective cohort studies. Our data add to the\nneed to increase awareness among care providers at all\nlevels of care in LMICs of the risks of SB of their pa-\ntients. Given the evidence in the general population of\nthe benefits of reducing SB, we propose that it is im-\nportant to test the efficacy and effectiveness of a dual\nstrategy in low resource settings by developing both a\nsmaller group of master trainers/supervisors (e.g. exer-\ncise physiologists and physiotherapists) and researchers\nand a larger group of practitioners (e.g. nurses) who are\nresponsible for minimizing SB in high risk groups. This\nmethod has been successfully employed for cognitive\nbehavioral therapy in trials in LMICs [69, 70]. A\nstepped-care approach, where patients start with self-\nmanagement in order to reduce their SB, may be a feas-\nible strategy in LMIC settings. Such self-management\nstrategies could, for example, include regular interrup-\ntions in sedentary time, such as standing or walking\nfrequently throughout waking hours, during television\ncommercial breaks or while using the phone. Then, if\npatients do not achieve significant reductions, they\ncould continue with a manualized approach under the\nsupervision of a non-specialist worker (e.g. nurses, oc-\ncupational therapists). Patients would only be referred\nto a specialist supervisor (e.g. exercise physiologists and\nphysiotherapists) if no significant reductions occur, for\nexample due to pain, sleep and cognitive problems or\nmobility problems or associated anxiety and depression.\nIt is known from physical activity research that inclu-\nsion of exercise physiologists or physiotherapists re-\nduces dropout rates from lifestyle interventions and\nconsequently improves outcomes [71]. Careful consid-\neration of which strategies would be most efficacious,\nand evaluation of this stepped-care approach, is essen-\ntial. The current available evidence is, however, mainly\nbased on evidence from high-income countries and\nshowed that lifestyle interventions focusing on light\nphysical activity participation reduced SB by 24 min/\nventions focusing on reducing time spent sedentary\nAlthough application of self-monitoring devices and\nalarms are not easy implementable in low resource set-\ntings, a recent International mobile-health Intervention\non physical activity, sitting, and weight in adult em-\nployees using light-weight, low-cost, non-interactive\npedometers as a self-monitoring and motivational tool\ndemonstrated reduction in sedentary time. In a 100-day\nprogram, participants were encouraged to increase inci-\ndental activity such as using stairs and avoidance of sitting.\nAfter 100 days, the time spent sedentary reduced in low-\nin middle-income countries [73].\nEfficacy trials of interventions focusing on SB among\npeople with chronic conditions in different cultural set-\ntings across LMICs are however urgently needed. If the ef-\nficacy and effectiveness of these SB interventions are well\nestablished in better equipped scientific settings with\ntrained research staff, the final step will be to fund inter-\nventions and initiatives to translate research findings into\n\"real-world\" settings while exploring its cost-effectiveness.\nIn order to justify the inclusion of programs focusing on\nSB reductions as a routine component in the treatment of\nchronic diseases and multimorbidity in LMICs, cost-\nbenefit analyses should be conducted in order to quantify\nthe financial implications of diverting resources or invest-\ning funds into such initiatives. Therefore, next to interven-\ntion studies exploring the efficacy of these programs,\neffectiveness research capable of driving practice change,\nalong with policy-level research, is urgently required. Min-\nistries of health and education will play a critical role in\nthis governance and policy development step. If research\nshows that reducing SB is efficacious and effective in the\nprevention and management of chronic diseases and mul-\ntimorbidity in middle-aged to older adults in LMICs, in-\nterventions should be mainstreamed in existing health\nsystems at all levels of care. Finally, since visual impair-\nments and hearing problems are associated with higher\nlevels of SB, future research could explore whether pro-\ngrams providing hearing aids and glasses might assist\nthose in need to become more physically active.\nLimitations and strengths\nThe current findings should be interpreted in light of\nsome limitations. First, the study is cross-sectional, and\ncause and effect cannot be deduced. Therefore, it remains\nunclear whether SB was caused by chronic conditions or\nvice versa. For example, SB is known to be a risk factor for\ncardiovascular diseases, while pain caused by arthritis may\ncause people to be more sedentary. Second, whilst we in-\ncluded all physical health conditions which were assessed\nwithin the SAGE, other physical conditions such as tuber-\nculosis, cancer and HIV may have been present and not\nidentified in the study. Therefore, the prevalence of phys-\nical multimorbidity is likely to be an underestimation and\nit is possible that the association between multimorbidity\nand SB could have differed if data on more chronic phys-\nical conditions were available. Third, since the information\non chronic conditions and SB was based on self-report,\nreporting biases may exist. Future research should utilize\nobjective measures of SB. Accelerometers-inclinometers\nare available that allow for valid and reliable SB behavior.\nFourth, by separating the sample into dichotomous SB\ncategories, we were not able to examine how different\nquantities of SB may affect morbidity. Finally, the present\nstudy did not include institutionalized people, which may\nlimit generalizability at a national level. Nonetheless, the\nstrengths of the study include the multi-national scope fo-\ncused on LMICs, countries which are not investigated yet\nin the prior research literature. Additionally, we investi-\ngated numerous potentially modifiable factors that can be\ntargeted for future interventions aiming to reduce SB.\nConclusions\nThe current study demonstrates that middle-aged to older\nadults with chronic conditions and physical multimorbid-\nity are significantly more sedentary. Future longitudinal\nresearch is required to confirm the directionality of our\nresults and explore influential factors. In addition, re-\nsearch on the efficacy and effectiveness of reducing SB in\nthe management of chronic diseases and physical multi-\nmorbidity in LMICs should be a priority for funding bod-\nies. Clinicians should consider in particular mobility\nproblems, disability and pain as potential barriers but also\nother mental health issues such as sleep problems and\npoor cognition.\nAdditional file\nAdditional file 1: Table S1.
