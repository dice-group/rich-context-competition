In any given study, adjustment for\navailable covariates may have been inadequate to produce condi-\ntional exchangeability between parous and nulliparous women. Fur-\nther, the effect of childbearing on women's obesity risk may be\n1990s among mostly White or Black women. However, the literature\non gestational weight gain provides circumstantial evidence that the\nassociation between childbearing and obesity varies by ethnicity and\nmay have changed in more recent maternal cohorts (13). For instance,\nlevels of gestational weight gain and post-partum weight retention,\nrisk factors for higher BMI and obesity, appear to be increasing over\ntime and are greater in U.S. Blacks versus Whites (4). In a more obe-\nsogenic and ethnically diverse population of women, the association\nbetween childbearing and obesity may be stronger than seen in previ-\nous studies. Alternatively, with higher obesity rates among contempo-\nrary young women, childbearing may be a less salient risk factor for\nincident obesity than in previous maternal cohorts.\nUsing data from an ethnically diverse, contemporary population of\nwomen, this analysis seeks to estimate the effect of childbearing\namong contemporary women who first gave birth in their late teens\nMethods\nPopulation\nData were from female respondents to the National Longitudinal\nStudy of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The baseline wave of Add\npublic and private school students enrolled in grades 7 through 12\n(14). The original Add Health survey focused on adolescent risk\nbehaviors and collected a wealth of behavioral data. The survey was\ncluster-sampled by school and also over-sampled subgroups including\nChinese students, black students with a parent who had completed\ncollege or attained a professional degree, and disabled students.\nAt baseline, detailed questionnaires were administered to each stu-\ndent and to the student's primary in-residence caregiver, preferen-\ntially female. Over the next 13 years, three more waves of data\nbaseline survey, all students except those in 12th grade at baseline\nall baseline study respondents were re-interviewed. Finally, in 2008\n(wave 4), baseline study respondents were interviewed again.\nExposure: incidence model\nThe main exposure was incident parity between waves 2 and 3. We\nexamined parity as a dichotomous variable (yes/no) because previ-\nous studies suggest that the first birth is uniquely important for obe-\nsity risk (3,6,8). We defined parity as having delivered a live birth\nor completed a full-term pregnancy, including a full-term pregnancy\nthat may have ended in stillbirth. Data on pregnancy histories were\ncollected at wave 3 from questionnaires administered via computer-\nassisted devices. The respondent detailed all her pregnancies, includ-\ning how and when they ended. Pregnancy data were not collected at\nparous at wave 2, we excluded women who reported that they had\ngiven birth or had full-term pregnancies that ended in 1996 or\nbefore.\nOutcome: incidence model\nThe main outcome was incident obesity between wave 3 and wave\n4. At both waves, obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI) \nrestricted the analysis to women who were nonobese (BMI < 30.0\nExclusions: incidence model\nThe analysis sample was restricted to women who were nulliparous\nin the wave 2 interview year and nonobese at wave 2 and wave 3.\n7.4%) or who reported having given birth within the past 6 months\nof the wave 4 interview (n 5 5, <1%), including three women fit-\nting both criteria, because temporary pregnancy-related weight gain\ncould lead to misclassification of the obesity outcome. An additional\n198 women were excluded because they were pregnant at wave 3.\nstatus at wave 2, wave 3, or wave 4: at wave 2, 33 respondents\n(<1%) were missing obesity status, at wave 3, 61 (1.4%) were miss-\ning obesity status, and at wave 4, 62 (1.4%) were missing obesity\n61% of the women present at all the waves of data collection.\nData analysis\nPropensity-score matching is a method of confounding control that\nattempts to balance the distribution of confounders in the \"treated\"\n(parous) and \"untreated\" (nulliparous) groups (16). One advantage\nof propensity-score techniques over traditional regression is that pro-\npensity scores reduce the dimensionality of confounders: a single\npropensity score summarizes information from many covariates (17).\nSecond, propensity-score methods allow one to more easily detect\n\"nonpositivity,\" when there are covariate patterns or combinations\nof the values of observed confounders where either none or all\nwomen are parous and in whom the effect of parity can thus not be\nvalidly estimated (18).\nFirst, to calculate propensity scores, we fit a logistic regression\nmodel in which the main exposure, incident parity, was the out-\ncome. The predictor variables were childhood demographic charac-\nteristics (described in next section). Next, each parous woman was\nmatched to one or more nulliparous women who had similar propen-\nsity scores (19). We used nearest-neighbor matching to estimate the\naverage treatment effect in the treated (ATT) respondents, parous\nwomen. Our main analysis matched nulliparous women to every\nparous woman within calipers of 0.1 times the logit of the propen-\nsity score. Finally, in this matched population, 7-year obesity inci-\ndence between wave 3 and wave 4 among the parous women was\ncompared to obesity incidence among matched nulliparous women.\nEach estimate of incidence difference had 95% Wald confidence\nConfounding control: Predictors in propensity score model.\nFor predictor variables, we chose confounders that temporally are\nlikely to precede the respondent's development of obesity and parity\nOriginal Article Obesity\nand logically are unlikely to be affected by the respondent's incident\nobesity (Figure 1). For instance, for most respondents, self-identified\nracial classification was set in childhood before childbearing or obe-\nsity onset and remained stable throughout adulthood (20). Another\nexample is parental education: because most parents would have\ncompleted their education by age 25 years (21), parental education\nis unlikely to be affected by the respondent's incident obesity or\nparity. In contrast, we did not include factors such as the respond-\nent's adult income or marital status that could be shared effects of\nparity and obesity. For instance, the likelihood of being married is\naffected by both a woman's childbearing and her obesity status\n(22,23). We assumed that adjusting for these shared effects could\ncause collider stratification bias, a type of induced selection bias\n(24,25); however, we did conduct analyses to evaluate the extent of\nthis potential source of bias.\nThe logistic model to predict \"exposure\" included demographic and\nchildhood characteristics that we hypothesized were on backdoor\npathways between parity and obesity status (Figure 1). The model\nunique indicator of the school attended, age, race/ethnicity, immigra-\ntion status, U.S. census region, parental education, urbanicity status\nof the school attended, and interactions and transformations of these\nterms, described below. Specifically, the following variables were\nincluded in the exposure model: unique ID of school attended at\nwave 1; age; age2; nominal 4-level census region (South, Northeast,\nMidwest, West); nominal school urbanicity (rural, urban, suburban);\ninteraction of census region and urbanicity; nominal 6-level parental\neducation; Black race; interaction of Black race and parental educa-\ntion; non-US-born immigrant; interaction of immigrant and Black\nrace; Mexican ethnicity; Cuban ethnicity; Puerto Rican ethnicity;\nCentral American ethnicity; other Hispanic ethnicity; mixed His-\npanic ethnicity; interaction of immigrant and Mexican ethnicity;\ninteraction of immigrant and Cuban ethnicity; five interaction terms\nof immigrant and all Hispanic ethnicities except \"mixed Hispanic\nethnicity\"; Chinese ethnicity; Filipino ethnicity; Japanese ethnicity;\nAsian Indian ethnicity; Korean ethnicity; Vietnamese ethnicity;\n\"other\" Asian Ethnicity; and mixed Asian ethnicities.\nSupplemental analyses. To examine whether propensity score\nmatching resulted in a different conclusion than a conventional\nregression model with covariate adjustment, we fit supplemental\nregression models to estimate the adjusted association between par-\nity and obesity. First, we fit regression models using a \"standard\"\nset of covariates used in previous regression modeling of this topic\n(7). These covariates were age, age2, rural/urban/suburban residence\nat baseline, 4-level race/ethnicity (Black, White, Hispanic, other),\nand a 3-level variable for mother's education.\nFinally, we conducted a prevalence analysis, estimating the associa-\ntion between parity at wave 4 and obesity at wave 4 without exclu-\nsions for earlier parity or obesity status. Generally, incidence analy-\nses are preferred over prevalence analyses because prevalence\nanalyses may be subjected to bias from causation and differential\nduration of prevalence of the outcome (26). However, the exclusions\nrequired for incidence analysis may limit generalizability and cause\nselection bias (24). By estimating the association using analyses sub-\nject to different sources of bias, we explored the robustness of our\nfindings. Moreover, as described in the Discussion, we believe that\nreverse causation and differential outcome duration are unlikely to\nhave biased the results of this prevalence analysis.\nResults\nTable 1 shows characteristics of the analysis sample for incident\nobesity before and after matching. About one-fifth of the respond-\nBefore matching, the parous and nulliparous women differed on\nchildhood demographic and community factors. Women who\nbecame parous were disproportionately more likely to grow up in\nthe South or a rural area and have parents who did not complete\nhigh school. In general, Black and Hispanic women were more\nlikely to become parous than were White or Asian women. The dis-\ntributions of propensity scores for women who experienced incident\nparity between wave 2 and wave 3 and those who remained nulli-\nparous at wave 3 showed overlap and little evidence of nonpositivity\nFIGURE 1 Simplified directed acyclic graph of relationship between childbearing and obesity, national longitudinal study of adoles-\nObesity Parity and Obesity Robinson et al.\n(not shown). After 1:1 matching with replacement, differences\nbetween parous and matched nulliparous women were reduced\nacross most variables (Table 1). Because we did not believe that the\ndistributions of these variables would be identical in the parous and\nnulliparous groups, we do not present any P-values testing that null\nDifferences in obesity incidence in matched\nsamples\nTable 2 shows differences in 7-year obesity incidence between parous\nand nulliparous women before and after propensity-score matching.\nBefore matching, obesity incidence was 3.2 percentage points greater\nin parous versus nulliparous women: 19.3% of parous women became\nobese between wave 3 and wave 4, whereas only 16.1%. of nullipar-\nous women became obese. Nearly all parous women could be\nmatched to a nulliparous woman, suggesting that the positivity\nassumption was not violated in this analysis (18). In 1:1 matching\nwith no replacement, the estimated difference in obesity incidence\nwas reduced to 0.0 percentage points. In 1:1 matching with replace-\nment, the estimated incidence difference was 0.9 percentage points.\nSupplemental regression analyses\nWe conducted regression analyses analogous to the matching analy-\nses. Generalized linear models with a binomial family distribution\nand log and identity links that included the same covariates included\nin the propensity-score model would not converge after 100 itera-\ntions of log-likelihood maximization. However, the unadjusted and\nadjusted estimates that could be fit were similar to the results from\nmatching with replacement. The main difference was that the confi-\ndence intervals were more conservative in the propensity-score\nmatching analysis.\nAnalyses of prevalent parity and prevalent\nobesity\nWe also performed a supplemental propensity-score analysis of the\nrelationship between prevalent parity and prevalent obesity. As\nexpected, about half the women (53%) were parous at wave 4. As\nshown in Table 3, the unadjusted prevalence difference in obesity\nwithout replacement and 1:1 matching with replacement. Regression\nresults also suggested null associations after adjustment.\nDiscussion\nWe hypothesized that there would be a positive association between\nchildbearing and obesity prevalence in a contemporary population of\nUS women. However, in both incidence and prevalence analyses,\nwe estimated only a small, inconsequential association between par-\nity and obesity. In other words, if these associations are similar in\nmagnitude to the true causal effect, it appears that there would have\nbeen little difference in obesity incidence in parous women in their\nlate 20s and early 30s if they had remained nulliparous.\nMost of the literature on the relationship between parity and weight\nstatus concerns postpartum weight retention in the first 12 months\nTABLE 1 Descriptive characteristics of analysis sample by parity\nstatus, before and after matching by propensity scores,\nUnmatched\nreplacement\nParous Nulliparous Parous Nulliparous\nAge, wave 4\n(mean, years)\nREGION (wave I)\nUrbanicity (wave 1)\nHighest parental education, wave 1 & wave 2\nHigh school\ngraduate/GED\nRace (Black/White)\nHispanic ethnicities\nCentral/South\nAmerican\nMixed Hispanic\nethnicities\nAsian ethnicities\nMixed Asian\nethnicities\nOriginal Article Obesity\nafter birth (28). These studies of short-term weight retention may\nnot reflect longer term effects of childbearing on weight gain (29).\nFor example, while a woman's weight may be greater a year after\nchildbirth than before childbearing, the difference may not reflect a\ncausal effect of childbearing on weight gain. Instead, the weight\ngain may be attributable to secular trends or aging: had the woman\nremained nulliparous, she may have still gained weight over time.\nEcological evidence supports the findings of the present study. Over\nthe past 35 years, age at first birth has increased, rates of adolescent\npregnancy have decreased, and lifetime parity has decreased even as\nobesity prevalence among adolescent girls and young women has\nincreased dramatically (2,30). Further, in countries with low rates of\nadult weight gain, there is little postpartum weight retention (31).\nHowever, some observational studies of the association between\nchildbearing and excess weight gain have found positive associations\n(6-9). The studies finding associations may have had limited ability\nto control confounding (6-9) and measurement bias from self-\nreported height and weight (7,8). In particular, because of the inter-\nrelated timing of incident obesity and incident parity in a woman's\nlife, many studies exclude large proportions of their samples, i.e.,\n50%, to conduct incidence analyses. The danger of this strategy is\nthat it could induce selection bias that produces confounding of\nunpredictable magnitude and direction (25).\nWe hypothesized that greater confounding control would signifi-\ncantly affect results, reducing the magnitude of a positive associa-\ntion between childbearing and obesity. However, in the incidence\nanalysis, unadjusted associations were only weakly positive. There-\nfore, our results may not differ from previous findings of positive\nrelationships because of confounding control; instead the association\nbetween childbearing and obesity may be weaker in contemporary\ncohorts.\nIt is notable that the unadjusted difference in incident obesity in\nparous versus unmatched nulliparous women was not statistically\nsignificant. By itself, restriction to a select population of nonobese,\nnulliparous young women yielded reduced differences in confound-\ning factors between the parous and nulliparous women remaining in\nthe sample. Despite the lack of statistical difference in the\nunmatched sample, it was still important to perform the propensity-\nscore analysis. First, the analysis controlled for residual confound-\ning, generating more valid estimates of the causal relationship\nbetween childbearing and obesity. Compared to the estimate in the\nunadjusted sample, the adjusted estimates were attenuated to the\nnull, strengthening our main conclusion. A second rationale for con-\nducting the propensity-score analysis is that propensity-score match-\ning allows one to more easily detect \"nonpositivity,\" when there are\ncovariate patterns or combinations of the values of observed con-\nfounders in whom the effect of parity cannot be validly estimated.\nOur analysis indicated that positivity was not a major problem here,\nfurther strengthening our confidence in the results.\nThe lack of associations in the present study could be interpreted in\nthree ways. One explanation is that there is no effect of childbearing\non obesity incidence. Under this interpretation, many new mothers\nwho experience postpartum weight retention were already on a tra-\njectory of weight gain and would have become obese over the long\nterm, even if they had not had a child. Contemporary U.S. women\nexperience great weight gain in their teens, 20s, and 30s regardless\nA second interpretation of the results is that there is heterogeneity\nof the effect of childbearing on excess weight gain: while child-\nbearing may increase obesity risk in some women, it would\ndecrease risk in another group of women. Under this interpretation,\nthe marginal, or overall, effect estimated by this study masks ele-\nvated risks and protective effects in population subgroups. For\ninstance, we plan to conduct additional analyses stratified by\ndemographic characteristics, such as race/ethnicity. If there is an\nidentifiable group of women for whom childbearing increases obe-\nsity risk, then it is important to identify factors that can be\nTABLE 2 Differences in 7-year obesity incidence between incident parous and nulliparous women, before and after\npropensity-score matching, National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, 1996-2008\nMatching scheme,\ncaliper Total N Parous N\nObesity incidence\nIncidence\nParous Nulliparous\nTABLE 3 Differences in obesity prevalence between parous and nulliparous women, before and after propensity-score\nmatching, National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, wave 4 (2008)\nMatching scheme,\ncaliper Total N Parous N\nObesity prevalence\nPrevalence\nParous Nulliparous\nObesity Parity and Obesity Robinson et al.\nmodified during pregnancy or postpartum. Additionally, women\nwho have lower postpartum weight versus prepartum weight may\nbe a target for interventions to maintain weight loss in new moth-\ners (3). Finally, a third interpretation of the null results is that the\nobserved associations are biased estimates of the true effect of\nchildbearing on obesity risk.\nThis analysis focuses more on the biological rather than social\neffects of pregnancy and childbearing. For example, we restrict to\nbiological mothers and include full-term pregnancies that end in\nstillbirth. Nevertheless, we recognize that the social aspects of child-\nbearing are inseparable from the biological aspects. In fact, the life-\nstyle changes associated with childrearing may be more important\nthan the physiological processes (34). Our estimate could include\nmultiple indirect effects, or pathways of action, including effects of\nchildbearing and childrearing on eating behaviors, disposable\nincome, and other risk factors for obesity.\nThis study has four major strengths. First, we analyzed data from a\nlarge, diverse sample of contemporary women. Second, to decrease\nbias from confounding and evaluate nonpositivity, we performed\npropensity-score matching on a rich set of prepregnancy maternal\ncharacteristics. Additionally, the ATT propensity-score matching\nestimated translatable effect estimates, incidence and prevalence dif-\nferences relevant to target populations of contemporary young\nparous women. Third, we had objectively measured data on height\nand weight. Finally, we explored the possible influence of selection\nbias and inadequate confounding control in our incidence analysis\nby conducting supplemental analyses of prevalent parity and\nobesity.\nIn the analysis of incident obesity, generalizability could be limited\nbecause exclusions narrow the target population to women who\nexperienced relatively early childbearing and are also somewhat\nresistant to obesity. Additionally, the selection bias could affect\nvalidity (24,35). For example, if parity causes obesity, then in the\nincidence analysis's restricted sample of women who were nonobese\nat wave 3, parous women are those who managed to prevent obesity\ndespite childbearing; therefore they are uniquely resistant to weight\ngain. As a result, a positive effect of parity on weight gain could be\nunderestimated unless one were able to control for all the factors\nthat predispose nonobese, parous women to be resistant to parity-\nassociated weight gain.\nThe analysis of prevalent obesity was not subject to these biases and\nproduced similar results as the analysis of incident obesity. Addi-\ntionally, parous and nulliparous women in the prevalence analysis\nhad more similar distributions of propensity scores (Supporting\nInformation Figures 1 and 2). They were likely more exchangeable\nthan in the incidence analysis as a result of being near the U.S.\nNear the median age for first birth, there are many newly parous\nwomen who are similar to nulliparous women who will become\nparous in the near future and vice versa. However, prevalence differ-\nence is a valid estimate of the effect of childbearing (versus delay-\ning childbearing) on obesity prevalence only if there is neither dif-\nferential outcome duration nor reverse causation. We believe\ndifferential outcome duration is likely to be small because obesity is\ngenerally a persistent state in U.S. adolescents and adults (33).\nMoreover, those at highest risk of obesity tend to have longest dura-\ntion, which would bias results upward. In contrast, reverse causation\ncould bias the estimate downward if obesity decreases parity risk.\nHowever, while obesity is associated with lower fecundity in clinical\nsettings (38), protective effects of obesity on parity may be negligi-\nble at the population level in contemporary women (39).\nThere are limitations to our analysis. First, our matching analysis\ndid not account for the complex survey sampling of the study. How-\never, we attempted to account for the probability of sampling and\nretention corrected by the survey weights by calculating propensity\nscores using the variables that comprised the sample weights, i.e.,\nrace/ethnicity, parental education, the interaction of race/ethnicity\nand parental education, and age. Further, controlling for clustering\nwould probably have increased the magnitude of the standard errors,\nnot affecting our interpretation of results. Second, to construct non-\npregnant, nonobese samples for the incidence analysis required\nexcluding a large proportion of eligible women because of their obe-\nsity or parity status at waves 2 and 3. Third, we only accounted for\nthe relative timing of incident parity and incident obesity in crude\ntime intervals, defined by the three time points at which data were\ncollected on obesity status by the parent study. In particular, in the\nincidence analysis, we did not take into account the incident parity\nbetween wave 3 and wave 4 of women who were nulliparous at\nwave 3. Additional restriction for births occurring between w3 and\nw4 could introduce selection bias and, moreover, make it impossible\nto ensure that parity occurred before obesity onset. However, failing\nto consider the wave 3-wave 4 incident parity could have biased our\nresults towards the null. Finally, this study does not disentangle the\nphysiological, social, and psychological mechanisms through which\nparity could affect obesity risk.\nFuture research may investigate whether childbearing has differential\neffects on women, increasing prevalence for some women while\ndecreasing it for others. If heterogeneity exists, it is important to\ninvestigate mechanisms by which childbearing is protective in some\nwomen while putting others at risk. Potential targets for investiga-\ntion include risk factors for gestational weight gain like prepreg-\nnancy BMI, race and ethnicity, single versus partnered status, socio-\neconomic status, sleep patterns, mental health, eating habits,\nphysical activity, breast-feeding behavior, and smoking resumption\nor continued cessation. Future research should also examine more\nspecific measures of adiposity or body composition and more long-\nterm postpartum weight retention. Finally, in most longitudinal stud-\nies, the timing of incident obesity is unobserved, making it difficult\nto control for reverse causation without potentially inducing selec-\ntion bias. To more precisely control for the complex timing of parity\nand obesity will require time-to-event analyses with many measures\nof weight to get at more precise timing of obesity. In summary, this\nanalysis of the relationship between parity and obesity provided lit-\ntle evidence that childbearing contributes to obesity prevalence in\nyoung U.S. women. Childbearing may not affect population-level\nobesity incidence in a diverse, contemporary population of young\nU.S. women. O\n"
