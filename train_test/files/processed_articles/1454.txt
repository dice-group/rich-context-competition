    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Results from previous population studies showed that mortality rates from acute myocardial\ninfarction and type-2 diabetes during the 1980s and 1990s in rural, agricultural counties of Minnesota, Montana,\nNorth and South Dakota, were higher in counties with a higher level of spring wheat farming than in counties\nwith lower levels of this crop. Spring wheat, one of the major field crops in these four states, was treated for 85%\nor more of its acreage with chlorophenoxy herbicides. In the current study NHANES III data were reviewed for\nassociations of 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) exposure, one of the most frequently used chlorophenoxy\nherbicides, with risk factors that are linked to the pathogenesis of acute myocardial infarction and type-2 diabetes,\nsuch as dyslipidemia and impaired glucose metabolism.\nMethods: To investigate the toxicity pattern of chlorophenoxy herbicides, effects of a previous 2,4-D exposure\nwere assessed by comparing levels of lipids, glucose metabolism, and thyroid stimulating hormone in healthy adult\nNHANES III subjects with urinary 2,4-D above and below the level of detection, using linear regression analysis. The\nanalyses were conducted for all available subjects and for two susceptible subpopulations characterized by high\nglycosylated hemoglobin (upper 50th percentile) and low thyroxine (lower 50th percentile).\nResults: Presence of urinary 2,4-D was associated with a decrease of HDL levels: 8.6% in the unadjusted data\n(p-value = 0.006), 4.8% in the adjusted data (p-value = 0.08), and 9% in the adjusted data for the susceptible\nsubpopulation with low thyroxine (p-value = 0.02). An effect modification of the inverse triglycerides-HDL relation\nwas observed in association with 2,4-D. Among subjects with low HDL, urinary 2,4-D was associated with increased\nlevels of triglycerides, insulin, C-peptide, and thyroid stimulating hormone, especially in the susceptible\nsubpopulations. In contrast, subjects with high HDL did not experience adverse 2,4-D associated effects.\nConclusions: The results indicate that exposure to 2,4-D was associated with changes in biomarkers that, based on\nthe published literature, have been linked to risk factors for acute myocardial infarction and type-2 diabetes.\nBackground\nChlorophenoxy herbicides, such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxy\nacetic acid (2,4-D) and 4-methyl-2-chlorophenoxyacetic\nacid (MCPA) have been used since World War II for\nweed control [1]. Commercial preparations of chloro-\nphenoxy herbicides may contain contaminants such as\npolychlorinated dibenzo- dioxins and furans [2],\nalthough the most toxic congener, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodi-\ntrichlorophenoxy acetic acid, has not been found in\ncommercial 2,4-D [3]. Chlorophenoxy herbicides are\ntransported in the environment for both short and long\ndistances (tens or hundreds of miles) from their point of\napplication [4,5]. 2,4-D has been found in house dust\n[6]. The presence of 2,4-D has been confirmed in\nstreams and drinking water reservoirs [7,8]. 2,4-D has\nCorrespondence: schreinemachers.dina@epa.gov\nEpidemiology Branch, Environmental Public Health Division, National Health\nand Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, Office of Research and\nDevelopment, US Environmental Protection Agency, 109 TW Alexander\n\u00a9 2010 Schreinemachers; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Several population studies have investigated\nthe potential association between level of spring wheat\nfarming and increased rates of adverse effects in these\nstates. Two studies compared agricultural regions in\nMinnesota [12,13]. Other studies were based on the\ncombined rural, agricultural counties of Minnesota,\nMontana, North and South Dakota. Wheat acreage per\ncounty was used as a surrogate exposure measure,\nbecause information on herbicide use by county was\nunavailable. The combined population studies showed\nthat more intense wheat farming per county was asso-\nciated with statistically significant higher rates of birth\nmalformations, and mortality from cancers, acute myo-\ncardial infarction, typy-2 diabetes, and renal disease\n[14-16]. The excess adverse health effects observed in\nthe general population in high-wheat versus low-wheat\ncounties, and the high use of chlorophenoxy herbicides\napplied to spring wheat, suggested that environmental\nexposures to these herbicides might be associated with\nrisk factors for these diseases. It is fairly well accepted\nthat a higher prevalence of a disease in one geographic\narea than in another area may be due to an environ-\nAs an approach toward investigating if environmental\nexposures to chlorophenoxy herbicides in high spring-\nwheat counties of Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota,\nand South Dakota played a role in the excess mortality\nfrom acute myocardial infarction and type-2 diabetes, a\nstudy was conducted involving subjects that had been\ntested for presence of urinary 2,4-D, an indicator of a\nprevious recent exposure. This cross-sectional study was\nbased on The National Health and Nutrition Examina-\nsurveys conducted by the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention (CDC) providing national estimates of\nthe health and nutritional status of the non-institutiona-\nlized U.S. population. A subset of the NHANES III sub-\njects, 20-59 years of age, was selected to participate in\nthe Priority Toxicant Reference Range Study for the\npurpose of assessing levels of common pesticides\n(including 2,4-D) and volatile organic compounds\n(VOC) in blood or urine [18]. No formal statistical sam-\npling procedure was used to recruit the volunteers.\nTherefore these volunteers were not representative of\n2,4-D exposure levels were comparable to the levels of\nresidents of spring wheat growing counties in\nMinnesota, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota,\nwho were environmentally exposed to chlorophenoxy\nherbicides during the spring season, most likely for sev-\nthe current study, subjects with urinary 2,4-D level\nabove and below the level of detection, were compared.\nThe focus of the investigation was on adverse changes\nof lipids and glucose metabolism, which have been\nimplicated in the pathogenesis of acute myocardial\ninfarction and type-2 diabetes [19,20]. The starting point\nfor the analyses was based on the following information:\n2,4-D, MCPA and the lipid lowering drug clofibrate (2-\n[4-chlorophenoxy]-2-methylpropionic acid ethyl ester)\nhave similar chemical structures, are lipid lowering in\nrats, and are PPARa ligands [21,22]; triglycerides and\nhigh density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) are negatively\nMethods\nData Source and exclusion criteria\nNHANES III survey data are publicly available and do\nnot contain any identifiable private information. There-\nfore any study based on these data is excluded from IRB\napproval. The purpose of the current study was to inves-\ntigate effects occurring in healthy subjects soon after an\nexposure to 2,4-D (half-life of less than one day) as indi-\ncated by its presence in the urine. For that reason the\nfollowing exclusion criteria were used: those that had a\nhistory of congestive heart failure, heart attack, diabetes,\nthyroid disease, lupus, and cancer, were excluded. In\naddition, subjects with a white blood cell count >12 \u00d7\n109/L, C-reactive protein >10 mg/dl, or glycosylated\nhemoglobin (HbA1c) >8%, which could be indications of\ninflammatory or metabolic problems, were excluded.\nUrinary levels of 2,4-D were determined by the isotope\ndilution and tandem mass spectrometry technique [25].\nSubjects with urinary 2,4-D levels below the LOD\nVariables and statistical analyses\nThe analyses included Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, Spear-\nman correlations, and linear regression models [26].\nBecause only 14% of the values of urinary 2,4-D, the\nexposure variable of interest, were above the LOD, it\nwas decided to use urinary 2,4-D as a binary variable,\nabove versus below the LOD, with values 1 and 0,\nrespectively. Associations with 2,4-D were investigated\nfor the following natural log-transformed outcome vari-\nables: HDL, triglycerides, nonHDL, insulin, C-peptide,\nplasma glucose, and thyroid stimulating hormone\n(TSH). The selection of these variables was based on\ntheir availability and known association with heart fail-\nure and insulin resistance [18,19]. Low density lipopro-\ntein cholesterol (LDL) values were missing for 45% of\nthe subjects. Therefore, the variable nonHDL was cre-\nated by subtracting values of HDL from values of total\ncholesterol. This definition of nonHDL includes all cho-\nlesterol present in lipoprotein particles considered to be\natherogenic [27,28]. The linear regression models\nincluded the following explanatory variables: 2,4-D (bin-\nary); HDL (continuous, log-transformed, included in all\nmodels except where HDL itself was the dependent vari-\nable); urinary creatinine (continuous, log-transformed);\ngender (0 = female, 1 = male); age (continuous); BMI\ncategorized as non-Hispanic White (referent), non-His-\npanic Black, Mexican American, and \"other ethnicity\";\nsmoking categorized as non-smoker (referent), past\nsmoker, and active smoker. Four additional variables\nwere checked for their effect on the beta coefficient for\nbinary 2,4-D using the change-in-estimate method [29]:\nalcohol consumption categorized as at least 30 drinks a\nmonth (wine, beer, or liquor) or less than 30 drinks a\nmonth (referent); education categorized as high-school\ncompleted or not completed (referent); household\nincome categorized as at least $20,000/year or less than\n$20,000/year (referent); hours of fasting prior to blood\nsample (continuous).\nLinear regression analyses were run for all available\nsubjects. In addition, two subpopulations that were\nexpected to be more susceptible, were selected: 1) sub-\njects with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) above the\nmedian (5.1%) of the total population, and 2) subjects\nwith thyroxine (T4) at or below the median (8.5 g/dl)\nof the total population. T4 and HbA1c with half-lives of\n7 and 120 days respectively, are likely to be indicators of\nhealth status prior to rather than as a consequence of a\nrecent 2,4-D exposure. High HbA1c and low T4 are\nknown to be associated with cardiac and metabolic\nadverse effects [18]. Subjects with either one of these\nconditions may be more vulnerable to potential effects\nfrom chlorophenoxy herbicides. HbA1c and T4 could\nhave been included in the model for all available sub-\njects as a continuous or categorical variable. However, it\nwas decided to run the regression analyses separately for\nthese susceptible subpopulations for ease of interpreta-\ntion. Regression results were presented as estimates with\n95% confidence intervals (CI). Because no formal statis-\ntical sampling procedure was used to recruit the volun-\nteers, weighting was not recommended for the analyses\nResults\nAmong the 1338 available subjects that volunteered for\nthe NHANES III VOC study, 375 had missing data on\nsubjects were excluded based on the exclusion criteria\nfor this study. Among the resulting 727 healthy subjects,\n1 to 28 mg/dl. Table 1 presents characteristics of these\nsubjects based on their 2,4-D status. Subjects exposed to\namong the continuous characteristics were observed.\nFigure 1 shows that the effect of urinary 2,4-D on tri-\nglycerides is not additive, as illustrated by the intersec-\ntion of the two smoothed interpolation lines\nrepresenting subjects with urinary 2,4-D below and\nabove the level of detection. The triglyceride-HDL\nSpearman correlation was stronger for the 2,4-D positive\nwith HDL levels of < 40 mg/dl showed increased levels\nof triglycerides associated with 2,4-D, while subjects\nwith HDL  40 mg/dl showed a decrease. This associa-\ntion was further explored in a linear regression model\nincluding an interaction term log(HDL)*2,4-D and\nadjusting for potential confounders. Similar regression\nmodels were run to evaluate the effect of the log(HDL)\n*2,4-D interaction on nonHDL, insulin, C-peptide,\nplasma glucose, and TSH.\nTo determine which one of the additional four predic-\ntor variables should be included in the models based on\nthe change of the 2,4-D coefficient, separate regression\nanalyses (main effects only) were run for each depen-\ndent variable including only subjects with low HDL\n(< 40 mg/dl), which was the more 2,4-D-reactive group\n(data not shown). It would have been difficult to observe\na change-of-effect in a model including all subjects with\n2,4-D present both as a main effect and in the interac-\ntion term. The results from these simplified models\nshowed that education had no effect, but income, alco-\nhol consumption and hours of fasting did change the\nestimate of 2,4-D by more than 10% for several of the\nmodels. Therefore, all final models included the addi-\ntional terms for income, alcohol consumption and hours\nof fasting.\nThe regression model for HDL (main effects only,\nTable 2) showed that 2,4-D was associated with a bor-\nderline significant 5% decrease of HDL when all avail-\ndecrease for subjects in the lower 50% of T4 (b-coeffi-\nOther factors associated with a decrease in HDL were\nbeing male, active smoking, and BMI  25. Non-Hispa-\nnic Black ethnicity and alcohol consumption were asso-\nciated with increased levels of HDL.\nMain-effects-only regression models for triglycerides,\nnonHDL, insulin, C-peptide, plasma glucose, and TSH\ndid not show any 2,4-D associated effects (data not\nshown). However, inclusion of the log(HDL)*2,4-D\ninteraction term identified several significant effects. To\nfacilitate interpretation of this interaction, an equivalent\nmodel was used replacing the log(HDL)*2,4-D interac-\ntion term with two separate log(HDL) terms, one for\nsubjects with 2,4-D < LOD and one for subjects with\n2,4-D  LOD. Results from this second model are pre-\nfor the interaction term.\nResults of the regression model for triglycerides\nshowed that both urinary 2,4-D and HDL played a role\n(Table 3). The 2,4-D effect on triglycerides was HDL\ndependent, as was also observed in Figure 1. The follow-\ning numeric example illustrates the HDL-associated 2,4-\nD effect on triglycerides. Using estimates for all available\nsubjects, and ignoring all other explanatory variables\n(Table 3), it was shown that by solving the equation:\n(HDL)\", 2,4-D had no effect on triglyceride levels at\nHDL = 48 mg/dl, which agrees with the approximate\npoint of intersection of the two fitted lines in Figure 1.\nSimilar calculations showed that at low HDL, e.g.\nTable 1 Characteristics of NHANES III subjects by urinary 2,4-D below and above the LOD\nCharacteristics Urinary 2,4-D\n% %\nEthnicity 0\nMean (SE) Mean (SE)\nOutcome variables\n*Wilcoxon test (2-sided) shows a statistically significant difference between subjects with urinary 2,4-D\nabove and below the LOD with regard to HDL (p-value = 0.006) and urinary creatinine (p-value < 0.0001).\n25 mg/dl, estimated levels for triglycerides were 137 and\nhigh HDL, e.g. 60 mg/dl, estimated levels for triglycer-\nrespectively. In other words, 2,4-D was associated with\nan increase of triglycerides at low HDL, and a decrease\nat high HDL. Effects were somewhat stronger for the\nsusceptible subgroup with HbA1c levels over 5.1% as\nindicated by the non-overlapping confidence intervals\nfor the two log(HDL) terms, and the p-value of 0.005\nfor the log(HDL)*2,4-D interaction term, in comparison\nto the all-available-subjects model with overlapping con-\nfidence intervals and the p-value of 0.01 for the interac-\ntion term. Other factors associated with increased levels\nof triglycerides were age, active smoking, and high BMI.\nBeing non-Hispanic Black and increased hours of fasting\nwere associated with decreased levels of triglycerides.\nNo association between nonHDL and 2,4-D was\nobserved (Table 4). In the model for all available sub-\njects, male gender, age, high BMI, and income were\nassociated with increased nonHDL. Non-Hispanic Black\nethnicity and HDL among subjects with urinary 2,4-D <\nLOD were associated with a decrease. The effects of 2,4-\nD on insulin and C-peptide (Tables 5-6) were most pro-\nnounced for the susceptible subpopulation with HbA1c\nover 5.1%. Similar to the numerical triglyceride example,\nit was shown that among subjects in this susceptible\nsubpopulation with low HDL (25 mg/dl), 2,4-D was\nassociated with an increase in insulin, from 9.2 U/ml\nhigh HDL (60 mg/dl) 2,4-D was associated with a slight\ndecrease of insulin, from 6.5 U/ml for 2,4-D < LOD to\n5.5 U/ml for 2,4-D  LOD. One subject with a value of\n102 U/ml insulin was considered an outlier (the next\nhighest value was 50 U/ml) and was excluded from the\nregression analysis. Other adverse factors associated\nwith increased insulin for this susceptible subpopulation\nwere non-Hispanic Black ethnicity and high BMI. Active\nsmoking was protective. Effects on C-peptide were simi-\nlar to those of insulin. At low HDL (25 mg/dl) 2,4-D\nwas associated with an increase in C-peptide, from 0.50\nLOD. At high HDL (60 mg/dl) 2,4-D was associated\nwith a decrease of C-peptide, from 0.34 pmol/ml for\ntwo confidence intervals for the log(HDL) terms did not\noverlap, which was in line with the highly significant p-\nHigh BMI was an adverse factor for C-peptide.

Male gender, age, \"other\" ethnicity, high BMI, and\nhours of fasting were associated with increased plasma\nglucose. The association between 2,4-D and TSH (Table\n8) was most pronounced for subjects in the susceptible\nsubpopulation with T4  8.5 g/dl.

Inclusion of the\ninteraction term \"log(HDL)*2,4-D\" in the regression\nmodel or using an equivalent model with separate terms\nfor log(HDL) with 2,4-D < LOD and for log(HDL) with\n2,4-D  LOD, showed that subjects with low HDL\nexperienced higher rates of 2,4-D-associated adverse\neffects than subjects with high HDL. Without this inter-\naction term or its equivalent in the regression model,\nthe 2.4-D effect would have been completely missed.\nPrevious exposures to pollutants, which may or may not\nhave included 2,4-D, may have contributed to the sus-\nceptibility of subjects, by lowering T4 or HDL, or\nincreasing HbA1c. The effect of increased susceptibility\nIndependent variables All available Susceptible subpopulations\ndue to existing conditions such as having high HbA1c\nor low T4, was tested in the regression analyses. The\neffect of low HDL as an existing condition prior to 2,4-\nD exposure could not be tested in this cross-sectional\nstudy. Only a follow-up study can determine if a 2,4-D\nexposure is associated with a further decrease of HDL\namong low-HDL subjects. The 2.4-D associated adverse\neffects of decreased HDL, increased triglycerides, insulin,\nC-peptide, and TSH, may be part of a causal path that\neventually may lead to weight gain, acute myocardial\ninfarction, type-2 diabetes, and possibly other diseases.\nThis concept is supported by a recent publication dis-\ncussing a new model for environmental disease in which\nprevious cumulative effects of different exposures may\nlead to increased vulnerability, thereby creating favorable\nconditions for overt disease [30]. It is not clear at this\npoint why no 2,4-D effect was observed for nonHDL in\nthe regression analysis. The lack of an association with\nIndependent variables All available subjects (n = 708) Susceptible subpopulations\nplasma glucose may indicate that in this study insulin\nand C-peptide are the better biomarkers to observe\nchanges in glucose metabolism.\nThe fact that the estimates for other predictors such\nas BMI and smoking, are in line with what is known in\nthe literature, supports the credibility of the methods\nused in this study. For example, both smoking and high\nBMI are known to be associated with low HDL levels\n[31]; moderate alcohol consumption is known to\nincrease HDL levels [32,33]. In the current study a\ndecrease of HDL was observed in association with BMI\n(in the form of a dose response) and with active smok-\ning, while alcohol consumption (30 or more drinks per\nmonth) was associated with an increase of HDL (Table\n2). In general, BMI was associated with each dependent\nvariable in a dose-response fashion.\nThe 2,4-D associated adverse effects have been\nobserved in other studies. 2,4-D is known to interfere\nIndependent variables All available subjects (n = 709) Susceptible subpopulations\nwith thyroid hormone transport and to possibly reduce\ntheir levels [34,35]. Thyroid hormones regulate lipid\nmetabolism by controlling the action of key enzymes in\nthe reverse cholesterol transport, in which HDL plays a\nmajor role [36-38]. A disturbance of the thyroid hor-\nmone homeostasis may impair the reverse cholesterol\ntransport process, which in turn may result in a\ndecrease of HDL, a characteristic of subclinical\nhypothyroidism [36]. When subclinical hypothyroidism,\nrepresenting mild thyroid failure, progresses to severe\nhypothyroidism however, normal or increased HDL\nlevels may be the result [36]. Subclinical hypothyroidism\nis a known risk factor for lipid abnormalities, endothelial\ndecrease in HDL plasma levels is associated with an\nincrease in coronary heart disease [41]. This has been\nobserved at all levels of LDL and triglycerides, for both\ndiabetics and nondiabetics, and for both sexes [42-47].\nIndependent variables All available subjects (n = 703) Susceptible subpopulations\nLow HDL is often accompanied by insulin resistance,\nobesity, and hypertension, which are risk factors for\natherosclerosis and are components of the metabolic\nThe \"favorable\" triglyceride-lowering effect observed\namong subjects with high HDL may be similar to the\nknown triglyceride-lowering effect in humans treated\nwith clofibrate or other fibrates with a chlorophenoxy\nstructure such as fenofibrate (1-methylethyl2-[4-(4-\nchlorobenzoyl) phenoxy]-2-methyl-propanoate) [41].\nThis is supported by an animal study showing that rats\ntreated with either chlorophenoxy herbicides or clofi-\nbrate showed a triglyceride lowering effect [22]. 2,4-D,\nMCPA, clofibrate, and fenofibrate are synthetic ligands\nof the peroxisome proliferator receptors PPARa, which\nactivate genes involved in lipid metabolism.

This effect, also\nnoted in rats, was thought to be due to increased hepa-\ntic glucuronidation of thyroid hormones [55]. The\nsimilarities of 2,4-D with pharmaceutical fibrates sup-\nport the notion that 2,4-D itself may be associated with\nadverse effects, although contribution by its contami-\nnants can not be ruled out.\nLimitations\nA major limitation is the fact that the results apply to\nthis study's subjects only, and are not representative of\nthe U.S. population. In addition, cross-sectional data are\nTable 7 Linear regression analysis of log(plasma glucose) on 2,4-D and covariates for ages 20-59, NHANES III,\nIndependent variables All available subjects (n = 708) Susceptible subpopulations\nnot always able to establish cause-and-effect. If the effect\ntakes place immediately after the cause, or is based on a\nstable system, use of cross-sectional data is appropriate\n[56]. However, when the system can be defined as\ndynamic, where the cause produces effects over time,\nstudies using cross-sectional data need to consider\nreverse causality [57]. Regarding this study, reverse caus-\nality would ask if presence of urinary 2,4-D could be\nconsidered a consequence of having low HDL. It seems\nmore likely that the observed changes in biomarkers are\na consequence of exposure to 2,4-D and/or contami-\nnants. Another limitation exists when exposures to dif-\nferent pollutants taking place at different times are\nassociated with the same adverse effect. It is difficult to\nseparate the contribution by different exposures to the\nsame adverse effect.\nConclusions\nBy showing that 2,4-D exposure was associated with\nadverse changes in lipid levels, glucose metabolism, and\nIndependent variables All available subjects (n = 705) Susceptible subpopulations\nTSH levels, which may predispose to heart disease and\ndiabetes, the current study provides support to results\nfrom a previous population study that showed excess\nmortality from these diseases in high-wheat counties\n[16]. The two types of studies complement each other.\nThe biomarker study contributed information on the\ntoxicity pattern of 2,4-D. The population study contrib-\nuted information on diseases associated with environ-\nmental exposure to chlorophenoxy herbicides. These\ncombined studies are an example of the recommended\nmethodology for studies on health effects associated\nwith environmental exposures [58]. The current study\nhas highlighted the major role of HDL in response to an\nexposure of 2,4-D. Future studies need to confirm these\nresults, and should further investigate the effect of other\nenvironmental pollutants on HDL and the HDL-asso-\nciated enzyme paraoxonase (PON), a known predictor\nof coronary events [42].\nAbbreviations\nBMI: Body mass index; 2,4-D: 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid; HbA1c:\nglycosylated hemoglobin; HDL: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; CI:\nconfidence interval; LDL: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LOD: level of\ndetection; MCPA: 4-methyl-2-chlorophenoxyacetic acid; NHANES III: National\nproliferator-activated receptor; T4: thyroxine; TSH: thyroid stimulating\nhormone; VOC: volatile organic compounds.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to acknowledge the valuable suggestions by JC Chen,\nthe review and suggestions by L.
