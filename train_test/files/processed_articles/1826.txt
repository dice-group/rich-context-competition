Also, currently there is little data available on the association between serum GGT level and clinically\nrelevant blood pressure (BP) categories earlier in the disease continuum, when hypertension prevention efforts\nmay be applicable. The association between serum GGT and prehypertension was examined in a nationally repre-\nsentative sample of US adults.\nMethods and Results Cross-sectional study among 5,827 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n1999\u00ad2002 participants aged 18 years without cardiovascular disease (CVD) and hypertension. The main out-\ncome-of-interest was the presence of prehypertension (systolic BP 120\u00ad139mmHg or diastolic BP 80\u00ad89mmHg)\n(n=2,269). Higher serum GGT levels were positively associated with prehypertension, independent of smoking,\nwaist circumference, diabetes, cholesterol levels and other confounders. The multivariable odds ratio (95%confi-\nThis association persisted in separate analyses among men and women. The results were consistent in subgroup\nanalyses by race-ethnicity, age, smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index, waist circumference and diabetes. In\nnon-parametric models, the positive association between serum GGT and prehypertension appeared to be present\nacross the full range of GGT, without any threshold effect.\nConclusions Higher serum GGT levels are associated with prehypertension in a nationally representative\nKey Words: GGT; Hypertension; NHANES; Prehypertension\nG\nstratified multistage probability sample based on selection\nof counties, blocks, households and individuals within\nhouseholds and included the oversampling of non-Hispanic\nblacks and Mexican Americans to provide stable estimates\nfor these groups. Subjects signed a consent form, and ap-\nproval was obtained from the Human Subjects Committee\nin the US Department of Health and Human Service.\nthe interview and examination components of NHANES\nexcluded (not mutually exclusive categories) participants\nwith prevalent hypertension (n=3,109), participants with\nmissing covariable data (eg, serum total cholesterol) (n=\n578) and participants with self-reported history of cardio-\nvascular disease (n=891), including coronary heart disease,\nmyocardial infarction, angina or stroke. This resulted in\n5,827 normotensive participants who were included for all\nhad prehypertension.\nMain Outcome of Interest: Presence of Prehypertension\nSeated systolic and diastolic BPs were measured using\na mercury sphygmomanometer according to the American\nHeart Association and JNC7 recommendations.\nmeasurements were averaged for systolic and diastolic pres-\nsures. Patients were considered hypertensive if they reported\ncurrent BP-reducing medication use and/or had systolic\ncurrent analysis, we excluded participants with hyperten-\nsion. The preferred outcome of interest in the current study\nwas the presence of prehypertension, defined as systolic\nbased on JNC7 criteria.\nExposure Measurements\nAge, gender, race/ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol in-\ntake (g/day), level of education, history of diabetes and oral\nhypoglycemic drug intake or insulin administration, hyper-\ntension and antihypertensive medication were assessed\nusing a questionnaire. Individuals who had not smoked\n100 cigarettes in their lifetimes were considered never\nsmokers, those who had smoked 100 cigarettes in their\nlifetimes were considered former smokers if they answered\nnegatively to the question \"Do you smoke now?\" and cur-\nrent smokers if they answered affirmatively. Body mass\nindex (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided\nby height in meters squared. After asking the participant to\nlift up their shirt, waist circumference was measured at the\niliac crest to the nearest 0.1cm.\nDetailed descriptions about blood collection and proc-\nessing are provided in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical\nTechnologists Procedures Manual.\n18 Serum GGT concentra-\ntion was assayed with a Hitachi 737 Analyzer (Boehringer-\nMannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) at White\nSands Research Center, Alamogordo, New Mexico (USA);\ndetails of laboratory measurements are available online.\nSerum total cholesterol was measured enzymatically. Serum\nglucose was measured at the University of Missouri Dia-\nbetes Diagnostic Laboratory using a modified hexokinase\nenzymatic method. Glycosylated hemoglobin was also\nmeasured at the University of Missouri using a boronate\naffinity high-performance liquid chromatography system.\nDiabetes was defined using American Diabetes Association\ncriteria as follows: a serum glucose 126mg/dl after fasting\nfor a minimum of 8h, a serum glucose 200mg/dl for those\nwho fasted <8h before their NHANES visit, or self-reported\ncurrent use of oral hypoglycemic medication or insulin.\nStatistical Analysis\nBecause of their skewed distributions, serum GGT was\nlog-transformed (base 2) when initially analyzed as a con-\ntinuous variable. We examined serum GGT level as quar-\nanalyses based on gender-specific GGT quartiles gave simi-\nlar results as GGT quartiles for the whole cohort; cutoffs for\nthe whole cohort were therefore used to simplify the pres-\nented tables. The odds ratio (OR) (95%confidence interval\n(CI)) of prehypertension was calculated for each GGT\nlevel, with the lowest quartile as the reference, using multi-\nvariable logistic regression models. We used 2 models: the\nage (years), sex-adjusted model; and the multivariable\nmodel additionally adjusted for race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic\nwhites, non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans, others),\neducation categories (<high school, high school, >high\nschool), smoking (never, former, current), alcohol intake\n(g/day), waist circumference (cm), diabetes (absent, pres-\nent), glycosylated hemoglobin level (%) and serum choles-\nterol (mg/dl). Trends in the OR of prehypertension across\nincreasing serum GGT category were determined modeling\nGGT categories as an ordinal variable. To examine the con-\nsistency of the observed association between serum GGT\nlevels and prehypertension, we performed subgroup ana-\nlyses by gender, race-ethnicity (Non-Hispanic whites,\nAfrican Americans, Mexican-Americans and others), age\n(<60, 60 years), current smoking (absent, present), current\ndrinking (absent, present), BMI (<25, 25kg/m2), waist\ncircumference (low [men <102cm, women <88cm], high\n(absent, present).\n20 In a supplementary analysis, to examine\nif the observed association between serum GGT and pre-\nhypertension was explained by inflammation, we addition-\nally adjusted for C-reactive protein levels (mg/L) in the\nmultivariable model. Sample weights that account for the\nunequal probabilities of selection, oversampling and non-\nresponse were applied for all analyses using SUDAAN\n(version 8.0; Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle\nPark, NC, USA) and SAS (version 9.2.; SAS institute, Cary,\nNC, USA) softwares; standard errors were estimated using\nthe Taylor series linearization method. To examine the\ndose\u00adresponse relationship between the observed associa-\ntion between GGT levels and prehypertension without line-\narity assumptions, we used flexible non-parametric logistic\nregression employing the generalized additive modeling ap-\nproach (R system for statistical computing, available from\nComprehensive R Archive Network [http://www.CRAN.\nR-project.org]) to calculate the odds of prehypertension,\nadjusting for all covariates in the multivariable model.

On closer examination, the dose\u00adresponse\nassociation between serum GGT and prehypertension\nappeared to be most evident at serum GGT levels within\nnormal limits (approximately <55g/L).\nIn a supplementary analysis, to examine if the observed\nassociation between serum GGT and prehypertension was\nexplained by inflammation, we additionally adjusted for\nC-reactive protein levels (mg/dl) in the multivariable model\nin Table2. The results were essentially similar. Compared\nto serum GGT quartile 1 (referent), the OR (95%CI) of pre-\np<0.0001. In a second supplementary analysis, we exam-\nined the association between quartiles of serum GGT and\nhypertension. Consistent with the results for prehyperten-\nsion, we observed a dose-dependent, positive association\nbetween increasing serum GGT and hypertension. Com-\npared to subjects in serum GGT quartile 1 (referent), the\nmultivariable OR (95% CI) of hypertension was 1.14\nDiscussion\nHigher serum GGT levels were found to be positively\nassociated with prehypertension in a representative sample\nof US adults, free of hypertension and cardiovascular dis-\nease. This association persisted after adjusting for age, sex,\nrace-ethnicity, waist circumference, smoking, alcohol intake,\ndiabetes mellitus, glycosylated hemoglobin levels and\nserum cholesterol, and was consistently present in subgroup\nanalysis by gender and important confounders. The OR of\nprehypertension increased in a dose-dependent manner with\nincreasing quartiles of serum GGT. In a subsequent analy-\nsis, employing nonparametric models, the observed positive\nassociation between serum GGT quartiles and prehyperten-\nsion was present continuously across the full range of GGT.\nOur results are in agreement with the current understanding\nof the role of GGT in hyerptension development, and fur-\nther contribute to the current literature by: (1) suggesting\nthat GGT levels are related to clinically relevant BP stages\neven earlier in the disease continuum, including prehyper-\ntension when primary prevention is possible; and (2) dem-\nonstrating the association between GGT and prehyperten-\nsion among major race-ethnicities in the USA.\nOur finding of a positive association between higher\nserum GGT level and prehypertension shows high internal\nvalidity, as shown by the magnitude of this association; in-\ndependence from related factors such as smoking, alcohol\nintake, waist circumference and diabetes mellitus; dose\u00ad\nresponse trend in nonparametric models; and the consisten-\ncy of this association in subgroup analyses by gender, race\nand several other factors. In nonparametric models, the\ndose\u00adresponse relation between GGT and prehypertension\nappeared to be most evident at serum GGT levels within\nnormal limits (<55g/L), a finding consistent with previous\nreports looking at hypertension.\n14 In the current study, the\nobserved association between serum GGT and prehyper-\ntension was present among non-drinkers also and persisted\nafter adjusting for grams of alcohol intake among current\ndrinkers. As serum GGT is also a marker of alcohol intake,\nthese findings are consistent with the hypothesis of an asso-\nciation with prehypertension independent of alcohol intake.\nThese results are also in agreement with previous cross-\nsectional and longitudinal epidemiologic studies that\nreported a positive association between higher serum GGT\nlevel and clinical hypertension, and extend the evidence to\nthe earlier stage of prehypertension, when primary preven-\ntion of hypertension is possible.\nSeveral lines of recent evidence suggest that an asso-\nciation between serum GGT and hypertension is plausible,\nincluding a direct role of GGT in the generation of reactive\noxygen species; an indirect role as a marker of increased ex-\ntracellular catabolism of antioxidant glutathione in response\nto oxidative stress; its predictive relationship to future\nelevations in plasma F2-isoprostanes, an oxidative damage\nproduct of arachidonic acid; its relationship to markers of\ninflammation; and its relationship to insulin resistance and\ncomponents of the metabolic syndrome.\nserum GGT has been shown to be associated with reduced\nkidney function among men without hypertension or dia-\nbetes.\nAs the current study examined a nationally representative\nsample of US adults, these results are generalizable to US\nadults. Furthermore, all data were collected following rigor-\nous methodology, including a study protocol with quality\ncontrol checks as discussed in the NHANES website.\nThe main study limitation is the cross-sectional nature of\nNHANES, which precludes conclusions regarding the\ntemporal nature of the association between serum GGT and\nprehypertension.\nIn conclusion, higher serum GGT levels were found to be\npositively associated with prehypertension in a representa-\ntive sample of US adults. Approximately 31% of US adults\nare reported to have prehypertension, a stage with higher\nrisk of converting to clinical hypertension, but when primary\nprevention is still possible.\na corollary observation is that subjects with prehypertension\nmay be a good target group for future hypertension preven-\ntion trials that aim to reduce serum GGT levels through\ninterventions based on nutritional or lifestyle factors shown\nto be inversely associated with serum GGT in observational\nstudies.\nReferences\n1.
