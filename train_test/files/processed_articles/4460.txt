    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe objective of this study is to determine whether different types of caregiver support services are associated with different\noutcomes for male and female caregivers. Information was obtained on 148 caregivers' use of three types of support services\nprovided by government-contracted agencies: counseling and education services, respite and supplemental services, and\nfinancial services. Five caregiver outcomes were included. Use of counseling and education services and financial services was\nassociated with better caregiver outcomes in female caregivers, but not male caregivers. Among caregivers using respite and\nsupplemental types of services, male caregivers showed better outcomes than did female caregivers. Female caregivers who\nused respite and supplemental services showed worse outcomes in caregiver mastery and caregiver satisfaction than those\nwho did not use the services. Male and female caregivers responded differently to the caregiver support service. Providing\nfemale caregivers with counseling services along with respite services may result in added benefits for female caregivers.\n",

To begin to answer this call, in the aim of\nunderstanding how different characteristics among caregiv-\ners are associated with the outcomes of particular caregiver\ninterventions, the current study explores how male and\nfemale caregivers respond to support services. We hope our\nstudy findings may be helpful to future development of care-\ngiver support services.\nMost research studies have examined caregiver related\nintervention as a monolithic category or have assessed only\none particular outcome, such as caregiver burden (Brodaty,\nGreen, & Koschera, 2003; Burns, Nichols, Martindale-\nAdams, Graney, & Lummus, 2003; Gallagher-Thompson et\nNewcomer, Yordi, DuNah, Fox, & Wilkinson, 1999; Roberts\n& Schacke, 2002). Only a few studies have used multiple\nmeasures to examine caregiver support service outcomes.\nChen and colleagues developed and tested an evaluation tool\nto assess multiple outcomes to evaluate different caregiver\nsupport services. Their study findings showed that different\ncaregiver support services are associated with different care-\ngiver outcomes (Chen et al., 2009). The current study used\nthe multiple outcome measurements used in Chen and col-\nleagues' study, and further investigated whether different\nservices were associated with different outcomes for male\nversus female caregivers.\nPurpose of Study\nThe purpose of this study was to determine whether different\ntypes of caregiver support services are associated with differ-\nent caregiver outcomes for male versus female caregivers.\nWe collaborated with Aging and Disability Services (ADS),\nthe local Area Agency on Aging (AAA) in Seattle,\nWashington, in a pilot study that evaluated a federally funded\nand state-funded project, the Family Caregiver Support\nProgram (FCSP), in King County in Washington State. In\nthis region, the FCSP provides various services to caregivers\nand their care recipients, including adult day care, in-home\nrespite, information services, and financial assistance to\nMethod\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis study was a descriptive, one-time survey of caregivers\nliving in King County who were reported as having received\nservices from local service agencies of ADS. Four local ser-\nvice agencies agreed to send out an invitation letter and ques-\ntionnaire to all caregivers who had received FCSP-funded\nservices. The University of Washington Human Subjects\nDivision approved this study.\nData Collection Method\nFor this study, each agency sent each of their caregiver cli-\nents a cover letter, a questionnaire, and a postage-paid return\nenvelope addressed to ADS. To protect client confidentiality,\nthe questionnaires were anonymous, and no follow-up\noccurred. A total of 866 survey packets were sent out, and\nMeasurements\nThe FCSP is a program with multiple components, which\ninclude various types of services, and it is likely that caregiv-\ners' experiences with the program are multifaceted as well\n(Van Houtven, Voils, & Weinberger, 2011). The tool used in\nthe current study, the Aging and Disability Services\u00ad\nCaregiver Appraisal Scale (ADS-CAS), assessed multiple\naspects of the caregiver experience. The ADS-CAS is based\non Lawton and Brody's(1969) Caregiver Appraisal Scale\n(CAS) for the appropriateness of its language and its cover-\nage of the broad scope of relevant caregiver experiences\n(Vitaliano, Young, & Russo, 1991). The CAS was developed\non the basis of both successful scientific evidence and hands-\non experience. The details of the process of developing the\nThe ADS-CAS includes three subscales: Subjective\nBurden (e.g., \"Your health has suffered because of the care\nyou must give to care receiver\" or \"Very tired as a result of\ncaring for care receiver\"), Caregiving Mastery (e.g., \"I can\nfit in most of the things I need to do in spite of the time taken\nby caring for care receiver\"), and Caregiving Satisfaction\n(e.g., \"Helping care receiver has made me feel closer to him/\nher\" or \"Care receiver shows real appreciation of what I do\nfor her/him\"). The ADS-CAS consists of 34 items, with 13\nitems, 12 items, and 9 items each for the Subjective Burden,\nCaregiving Mastery, and Caregiving Satisfaction subscales,\nrespectively.\nParticipants responded to each item on the ADS-CAS\nbased on a 5-point scale, from rarely or never (1) to most of\nthe time (5). Higher total and subscale scores represent more\npositive appraisals, except for the Subjective Burden sub-\nscale, where higher scores indicate higher perceived subjec-\ntive burden.\nIn addition to the three subscales, the ADS-CAS also sur-\nveys information about caregivers' age, gender, and relation-\nship to the care recipient; the types of care provided; and the\ntypes of caregiver support services used by the caregivers.\nAgencies reported providing a list of services, including (a)\ninformation about services, (b) assistance in accessing ser-\nvices, (c) caregiver counseling, (d) caregiver education and\ntraining, (e) financial assistance, (f) respite services/adult\nday care, (g) help with housework, (h) delivered meals, (i)\ntransportation, and (j) cash support. Caregivers were asked in\nthe survey whether they had used each of these services.\nThese 10 types of caregiver support services were further\ngrouped in three categories: (a) counseling and education\nservices, (b) respite and supplemental services, and (c) finan-\ncial support services. The counseling and education services\ncategory includes information about services, assistance in\naccessing services, caregiver counseling, and caregiver edu-\ncation and training. The respite and supplemental services\ncategory includes respite services/adult day care, help with\nhousework, delivered meals, and transportation. The finan-\ncial support services category includes financial assistance\nand cash support for caregiving. A general service satisfac-\ntion question is also included in theADS-CAS, with a 4-point\nscale response: poor (1), fair (2), good (3), or excellent (4).\nAfter reverse coding and multiple imputation, Cronbach's\nalphas for the ADS-CAS were .90. The power to detect sta-\ntistically significant differences between male caregivers and\nfemale caregivers was .72, and the power to detect differ-\nences between caregivers who reported having used at least\none service and those who reported not using any service\nwas .51 and .57 for male and female caregivers, respectively.\nDetails of the psychometric properties of ADS-CAS were\nData Analysis\nData analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package\nfor the Social Sciences (SPSS-PC, Version 16.0). Prior to\nanalyzing the data, all items were examined to assess the\naccuracy of variable calculations and missing values. If vari-\nables were missing at a rate larger than 5%, multiple imputa-\nDescriptive analyses were used to depict the characteris-\ntics of the caregivers and the support services they used.\nThree steps were included in the evaluation method. First,\nwe examined the gender differences in care provided and\nservices used using the t test. Second, we conducted\nMANCOVA to examine gender difference, comparing ADS-\nCAS scores between male and female caregivers (a) who\nreported using any of the 10 caregiver support services, and\n(b) who had used only one of the three categories of services.\nThird, we conducted MANCOVA to examine gender differ-\nences by stratifying male and female caregivers and compar-\ning their appraisals in the following categories: (a) among\nthose who reported using any of the 10 services versus those\nwho did not; and (b) among those who used only one of the\nthree categories of services versus those who did not use that\nparticular service category. (For example, caregivers who\nhad used services in the financial services category only and\nno services from other categories were compared with care-\ngivers who reported they had not used any services from the\nfinancial services category. Caregivers who were \"nonusers\"\nin one category may have used services in other categories,\nor may have reported not using any services at all.) As rec-\nommended by Chen (2010), analysis is focused on categories\nof service because analyses of individual types of service and\nof the three service categories revealed similar findings.\nCaregivers' age and the number of caregiving activities\nthey provided were controlled as covariates. The outcome\nmeasures were (a) the item mean of the ADS-CAS; the item\nmeans of each of the three subscales of the ADS-CAS: (b)\nSubjective Burden, (c) Caregiving Mastery, and (d)\nCaregiving Satisfaction; and (e) the caregivers' satisfaction\nwith the services they used.\nResults\nof 866). Five of the questionnaires were returned blank, and\ntwo were returned with no information on ADS-CAS but text\ninformation regarding their suggestions for future service\ndevelopment only. Furthermore, six of the responding care-\ngivers stated that they were not providing any care at this\npoint, and 16 did not specify their gender. As a result, only\n148 questionnaires were entered for quantitative data analy-\nsis. About 81.7% of the responding caregivers were female\nfrom less than 20 to more than 81 years old, with an average\nage of 57. The average age of male caregivers (65.3 years)\nwas significantly older than the average age of female care-\ngivers (56.4 years). The majority of responding caregivers\nstated that they were caring either for a spouse/partner\n(48.8%) or for elderly parents (41.2%). Male caregivers were\nmore likely to care for a spouse/partner (64.3%) than for\nelderly parents (32.1%), whereas a relatively equal percent-\nage of female caregivers were caring for a spouse/partner\nAbout 70% of caregivers provided personal care, 98.2%\nprovided at least one type of instrumental activities of daily\nliving (IADL) care, and 86.6% provided at least three types\nof IADL care. Caregivers provided from 1 to 10 types of care\n4 SAGE Open\nto their care recipients, with an average of 6.8 (SD = 2.24).\nAbout one third provided all 10 kinds of caregiving activities\nlisted in the questionnaire. Male and female caregivers pro-\ntypes of care to their care recipients, respectively. The most\ncommon type of care provided by male and female caregiv-\ners was different. The most common types of care provided\nby male caregivers were medication monitoring (92%) and\nfinancial management (77.8%); the most common types of\ncare provided by female caregivers were transportation\nof caregivers providing medication monitoring was signifi-\ncantly higher among male caregivers than female caregivers\n(p < .05). Among male caregivers, 92.6% provided medica-\ntion monitoring, whereas only 76.9% of women provided\nsuch care to their care receivers. The average number of\ncaregiving hours that the caregivers had spent in the previous\nfor female caregivers (p < .05). Forty-three percent of male\ncaregivers provided more than 50 hr of care in the previous\nweek, whereas almost 58% of female caregivers provided\nmore than 50 hr of care in the week preceding the survey.\nCaregivers reported using a range of zero to seven ADS\ncaregiver support services, with an average of 1.9 (SD =\n1.54). Male and female caregivers used an average of 1.8\nrespectively. The services most commonly used by male and\nfemale caregivers were information services (44.4% in male\ncaregiver vs. 54.5% in female caregivers) and respite ser-\nvices (33.3% in male caregivers vs. 28.1% in female caregiv-\ners). The percentage of female caregivers receiving cash to\nsupport caregiving was significantly higher than male care-\ncaregivers (13.2%) stated that they had not used any services,\neven though all the caregivers surveyed had been identified\nby agencies as service recipients.\nGender Differences in the Scores of ADS-CAS\nBoth male and female caregivers reported moderate levels of\nsubjective burden, caregiver mastery, caregiver satisfaction,\nand service satisfaction. After controlling for caregivers' age\nand the number of care activities provided, there were no dif-\nferences between male caregivers and female caregivers in\nthe ADS-CAS measures or satisfaction toward services, with\none exception: Male caregivers perceived a lower subjective\nburden than did female caregivers (p < .05; see Table 2).\nGender Differences in the Scores of ADS-CAS\nAmong Users\nA comparison of male and female caregivers' ADS-CAS\nscores among those who reported using at least one type of\nsupport services (from here on referred to as caregiver users\nvs. nonusers) revealed similar information as findings\nreported above that male caregiver users, compared with\nfemale caregiver users, perceived significantly lower subjec-\ntive burden (p < .05). When male and female ADS-CAS\nscores were compared by service category among those care-\ngivers who used a particular category of support services, the\ndata showed that male caregivers who used respite and sup-\nplemental services reported better outcomes than did the\nfemale caregivers who used the same service. Better out-\ncomes for male caregivers were found in several categories,\nincluding better ADS-CAS score (p < .01), less subjective\nburden (p < .01), better caregiving satisfaction (p < .05), and\nbetter satisfaction toward the support services used (p < .05).\nFor the caregivers who used counseling and education ser-\nvices, there were no differences between male and female\nTable 1. Care Provided by Caregivers.\nGender differences\nCare provided by family caregivers\ncaregiver users'outcomes. No male caregivers used financial\nsupport services, so outcomes for this category of support\nservices were not compared between male and female care-\ngivers (see Table 3).\nGender Differences in Mean Scores of Outcome\nMeasures (ADS-CAS) Between Users and\nNonusers of Services\nFurther analysis of use of caregiver support services between\nusers and nonusers of services revealed different outcomes\nfor male and female caregivers. Use of family caregiver sup-\nport services seemed to result in more significant effects for\nfemale caregivers than for male caregivers (see Table 3).\nAfter controlling for caregivers' age and the number of care\nactivities provided, female caregivers who used at least one\ntype of service showed significantly lower scores in ADS-\nCAS (p < .01), caregiver mastery (p < .05), and caregiver\nsatisfaction (p < .05) than did female caregivers not using\nany service. For male caregivers, those who used at least one\ntype of service showed no difference in outcomes from those\nwho did not use any service.\nAn analysis of service categories revealed additional sta-\ntistically significant relationships. The female caregivers\nwho used services in the counseling and education category\nonly perceived less subjective burden (p < .05) than did other\nfemale caregivers. Female caregivers who used only respite\nand supplemental services showed lower caregiver mastery\n(p < .05) and caregiver satisfaction (p < .05) than did those\nnot using respite services. Last, female caregivers who used\nonly financial support services showed better appraisals\n(higher total scores) on the ADS-CAS (p < .01), and per-\nceived greater caregiver mastery (p < .05) and caregiver sat-\nisfaction (p < .01) than did those caregivers not using any\nfinancial support services (Table 4). The results of our analy-\nses are presented in Table 4 as mean score differences\nbetween users of services and nonusers, and between users\nof a single service category and nonusers of that same ser-\nvice category.\nDiscussion\nThe different findings reported by male and female caregiv-\ners adds to the growing body of research in caregiving sup-\nport and provides suggestions for further service development\nfor male and female caregivers. In the current study, male\nand female caregivers provided different types of care to\ntheir care recipients and used different types of caregiver\nsupport services. After controlling for caregivers'age and the\nnumber of caregiving activities provided, the findings from\nthe current study reveal that gender differences played a role\nin caregiver appraisals. Chen (2009) reported that use of dif-\nferent services was associated with different levels of care-\ngiver appraisal, and findings from the current study provide\nfurther information regarding gender differences in caregiver\nappraisals. In the following sections, we further discuss the\ndifferent outcomes associated with male and female caregiv-\ners' use of different caregiving support services.\nTable 2.

(Male users' scores - Female users' scores)\n6 SAGE Open\nCounseling and Education Services\nFemale caregivers seemed to benefit more than male care-\ngivers from using counseling and education services. In the\ncurrent study, female caregivers' subjective burden tended to\nbe higher than that reported by male caregivers, consistent\nwith reports from other studies that female caregivers per-\nceived greater strain and burden from caregiving than did\nremained among the caregivers in the current study who used\nat least one type of support service and among those who\nused respite and supplemental services but not any other type\nof service. However, the discrepancy between male and\nfemale caregivers' perceived subjective burden becomes\nnonsignificant among caregivers who used counseling and\neducation category only. Further analysis revealed that\nfemale users of counseling and education category only\nreported a significantly lower subjective burden (p < .05)\nthan female nonusers, but no differences were found between\nmale users and nonusers. These findings could indicate that\nuse of counseling and education services is beneficial for\nfemale caregivers, while the effect of using such services for\nmale caregivers is less obvious. Research findings have\nshown that counseling and education services are effective in\nhelping caregivers deal with their own psychological needs\nand improve their relationships with care recipients (Brodaty\nSorocco, & Gallagher-Thompson, 2003). The findings in the\ncurrent study support this previous research and further indi-\ncate gender differences in outcomes of using counseling and\neducation services with further empirical evidences.\nIt is also important to note the possibility that female care-\ngivers who already perceive less burden may be more likely\nto use this type of service. Those caring for a recipient with\nmore severe disabilities and those who have fewer sources of\ncaregiving help may perceive a higher burden and therefore\nhave less energy to use counseling and education services\n(Markle-Reid & Browne, 2001; Toseland, McCallion,\nGerber, & Banks, 2002). However, a recent caregiver report\n(AARP, 2009) showed that female caregivers who provided\ncare for more than 21 hr a week and who perceived a higher\ncaregiver burden were more likely to use counseling and\neducation services. The report also pointed out that female\ncaregivers are more likely than male caregivers to provide\nintensive care and provide many hours of care (AARP, 2009).\nTherefore, the findings from the current study may indicate\nthat female caregivers, more than male caregivers, become\nmore aware of their needs and seek counseling and education\nservices to support themselves to survive as caregivers.\nFurther study to establish a stronger causal inference is\nmerited.\nRespite and Supplemental Services\nAlthough male caregivers did not seem to benefit as much as\nfemale caregivers from using counseling and education ser-\nvices, they did seem to benefit from using respite and supple-\nmental services. Among caregivers using respite and\nsupplemental services, male caregivers had higher scores on\nthe ADS-CAS, lower subjective burden, higher caregiver\nsatisfaction, and higher satisfaction toward the services they\nused than female caregivers. In addition, male caregiver\nusers of respite and supplemental services showed better\ncaregiver mastery than male caregivers who did not use these\nservices. What we did not expect was that female caregiver\nusers of respite and supplemental services showed worse\ncaregiver mastery and caregiver satisfaction than did female\ncaregivers not using these services.\nThese findings could indicate that male caregivers enjoy\nusing respite services as a means of recharging themselves,\nwhereas female caregivers do not. If this is true, it could be\ndue to traditional role expectations for female caregivers.\nTable 4.

Controlled for caregivers' age and number of caregiving activities they provided. CAS = Caregiver Appraisal Scale; SB = Subjective Burden; CM =\nCaregiver Mastery; CS = Caregiver Satisfaction; SS = Service Satisfaction.\nFemale caregivers are expected to be able to provide care\nand comfort to their families (Navaie-Waliser et al., 2002).\nUsing respite services might make female caregivers per-\nceive themselves as incompetent. Providing female caregiv-\ners with extra counseling services along with respite services\nmay result in added benefits for female caregivers (Cox,\nand supplemental services did not report any more positive\ncaregiver appraisals than nonusers did. The current study's\nfindings further indicate that male caregivers, but not female\ncaregivers, who use respite and supplemental services do\nreport more positive caregiver appraisals.\nFinancial Support Services\nFemale caregiver users of financial support services reported\nhigher scores on the ADS-CAS, higher caregiver mastery,\nand higher service satisfaction than nonusers of such ser-\nvices. There were no male caregivers in this study who used\nthis type of service. It could be that male caregivers are more\nlikely than female caregivers to be employed (AARP, 2004).\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and\nDevelopment (2011) reported evidence that caregiving leads\ntolowerwages,especiallyforfemalecaregivers(Organisation\nfor Economic Co-Operation and Development, 2011).\nTherefore, male caregivers may be more financially stable;\nthey may not need financial support services or may not even\nbe eligible to receive it. However, female caregivers are\nmore likely to need financial support services and may,\ntherefore, benefit more from this type of service. Providing\nfinancial services to caregivers is likely to offer them the\nopportunity to focus on their caregiving activities and to\ndevelop higher confidence and satisfaction.\nFeminist theory suggests that women have traditionally\nbeen cast in the role of caregiver, as a result of traditional\ngender roles and rigid family structures in which women\nhave been socialized to be responsible for various tasks\n(Baines, Evans, & Neysmnith , 1991). From a feminist point\nof view, providing financial support to caregivers could fur-\nther encourage women to fulfill their role as caregivers, and\nthus perpetuate women's oppression (Mackinnon, 2009).\nOur findings, showing better caregiver outcomes among\nfemale caregivers who received financial support services,\nprovide empirical evidence that female caregivers perceive\nhigher confidence and satisfaction rather than oppression\nwhen receiving financial support.\nHowever, we should not ignore another possible explana-\ntion--that the caregivers who were able to gain access to\nfinancial support funds were competent users of the system\nwho already had higher caregiving mastery and total ADS-\nCAS scores. Financial support for caregivers is a relatively\nnew service that has been developed in the last 15 years\n(Doty, Jackson, & Crown, 1998). A limited number of\nresearch studies have examined the effect of financial sup-\nport services for caregivers, and none has looked how gender\ndifferences influence use of these services (Eckert, Morgan,\n& Swamy, 2004; Mahoney, Simon-Rusinowitz, Loughlin,\nDesmond, & Squillace, 2004). The findings of this study\nencourage further investigation of the cost-effectiveness of\nproviding financial support services to caregivers.\nFurthermore, although eligibility criteria may prevent\nmale caregivers from using financial support services, both\nthe current study and a national caregiver survey report\nshowed that male caregivers are more likely than female\ncaregivers to help their care recipients with financial man-\nagement (AARP, 2009). Exploring the possibility that factors\nother than financial eligibility prevent male caregivers from\nreceiving financial support services could be important for\nfuture research studies.\nLimitations\nSeveral methodological issues limit the findings in this study.\nThe cross-sectional design made it impossible to draw causal\ninferences. The long and variable time between the time\ncaregivers received services and the time they responded to\nthe ADS-CAS is a threat to validity. We recommend that\nfuture studies add a variable to assess the time between ser-\nvice use and survey response. Moreover, past research has\nfound that caregivers' perceptions of distress may be influ-\nenced by different factors at different stages of caregiving\n(Vitaliano et al., 2002). Therefore, a longitudinal follow-up\nwould help to determine the optimal time to provide certain\nkinds of services, and this information would be valuable for\nfuture policy making.\nAnother limitation of this study was the low response rate\nof 20.4%. We have explored potential reasons for the low\nresponse rate. The first challenge is the fact that many care-\ngivers do not self-identify with the term caregiver. That is\npossibly why five questionnaires were returned blank. Self-\nidentification has been a recurring theme and challenge for\nimplementing and evaluating family caregiver supports in\nthe United States (Feinberg & Newman, 2006). The low\nresponse rate may also have to do with the substantial length\nof the ADS-CAS questionnaire. Jepson and colleagues\n(2005) studied the correlation between response rates and\nquestionnaire length and suggested that questionnaires above\na threshold of 1,000 words have lower response rates. Our\nsurvey questionnaire was over 5,000 words, even after we\nremoved two subscales from the CAS.\nDetailed information about care recipients was not col-\nlected for the length of our questionnaire. This may limit the\ngeneralizability of the study findings. We believe that the\ncharacteristics of caregivers in the current study may be\nclose to the general caregiver population; the caregiver\ndemographics in the current study show similar composition\nof age, gender, and number of services provided and received\ncompared with caregiver demographics in the National\nFamily Caregiver Study (AARP, 2004). There may well be\ndifferences in other variables, of course. Increasing the\n8 SAGE Open\nresponse rate in future work will be important and can be\naddressed by further decreasing the length of the question-\nnaire. Other methods that might increase the response rate in\nfuture studies include offering incentive payments, or per-\nforming follow-up.\nFinally, the power to detect statistically significant differ-\nences between male caregivers and female caregivers in this\nstudy was lower than .80. This could be due to the limited\nnumber of male caregivers who responded to our survey.\nWith further analysis, we found that if the number of male\ncaregivers who claimed to receive services increased from\n27 to 30, the statistical power to detect gender differences in\ncaregivers' experiences of using caregiver support service\nwould reach .81. Also, if the number of male and female ser-\nvice nonusers increased to 17 and 36, the power to detect\ndifferences between service users and nonusers would\nincrease and exceed .80 for both male and female caregivers.\nThe number of male caregivers who responded to our survey\nwas only about one fifth of our total study sample, which is a\nlittle less than the proportion of male caregivers surveyed in\nthe AARP (2004) family caregiver survey. Although infor-\nmation from male caregivers was limited, the message con-\nveyed through our study findings are still valuable for future\nfamily caregiver support services, especially for developing\ngender-sensitive services. For future studies, oversampling\nof male caregivers is recommended.\nConclusion\nThis study found gender differences in caregiver appraisal\nscores that add to the growing body of research in caregiver\nsupport and provide suggestions for further service develop-\nment. Not only did male and female caregivers report differ-\nences in caregiving activities and use of support services but\nalso responded differently to the support services they used.\nThe current study findings could shed some light on future\nservice development for caregivers of different genders. The\nstudy's findings can also serve as a basis for more rigorous\nfuture evaluations of caregiver support services.\n"
