This article examines whether sleep\nduration and efficiency in the weeks preceding viral ex-\nposure are associated with cold susceptibility.\nMethods: A total of 153 healthy men and women (age\nrange, 21-55 years) volunteered to participate in the study.\nFor 14 consecutive days, they reported their sleep dura-\ntion and sleep efficiency (percentage of time in bed ac-\ntually asleep) for the previous night and whether they\nfelt rested. Average scores for each sleep variable were\ncalculated over the 14-day baseline. Subsequently, par-\nticipants were quarantined, administered nasal drops con-\ntaining a rhinovirus, and monitored for the develop-\nment of a clinical cold (infection in the presence of\nobjective signs of illness) on the day before and for 5 days\nafter exposure.\nResults: Therewasagradedassociationwithaveragesleep\nduration: participants with less than 7 hours of sleep were\nlikely to develop a cold than those with 8 hours or more\nof sleep. The association with sleep efficiency was also\ngraded:participantswithlessthan92%efficiencywere5.50\nthan those with 98% or more efficiency. These relation-\nships could not be explained by differences in prechal-\nlenge virus-specific antibody titers, demographics, sea-\nson of the year, body mass, socioeconomic status,\npsychological variables, or health practices.

We also interviewed the vol-\nunteers about their sleep quality during the previous night on\n14 consecutive days. Other interview and questionnaire data col-\nlected during the prechallenge baseline included health prac-\ntices and psychological factors. The participants were then quar-\nantined in separate rooms, exposed to RV-39, and monitored for\n5 days to assess infection and signs and symptoms of illness.\nPARTICIPANTS\nments, were judged to be in good health, and had no missing\ndata (2 participants were excluded because of missing data) on\nrelevant variables. They were studied in 6 groups and received\n$800 for their participation. The study received institutional\nreview board approval, and informed consent was obtained from\neach participant.\nThe temporal sequence of events for a study trial is presented\nbelow.\nBaseline period\nEligibility screening (5-10 weeks before viral exposure)\nv Physical examination\nv Check blood sample for preexisting antibody to virus\nv Demographics\nv Height and weight\nv Perceived social status\nexposure)\nv Sleep\nv Positive emotions\nv Health practices\nQuarantine baseline day 0 (before viral exposure)\nv Psychological questionnaires\nv Nasal lavage for baseline virus culture\nv Baseline signs and symptoms of respiratory illness\nViral exposure\nQuarantine baseline day 0 (end of day)\nv Viral inoculation\nPostexposure follow-up\nv Nasal lavage for virus culture\nv Signs and symptoms of respiratory illness\n28 Days after viral exposure\nv Check blood sample for antibody to virus\nThe volunteers underwent medical screenings and were ex-\ncluded if they had a history of nasal surgery or any chronic dis-\norder (eg, asthma, cardiovascular disorders, or sleep apnea);\nhad abnormal findings on urinalysis, complete blood cell count,\nor determination of blood enzyme levels; were pregnant or cur-\nrently lactating; were positive for human immunodeficiency vi-\nrus; or were taking medication regularly (including sleep medi-\ncation). They were also excluded if they had been hospitalized\nfor psychiatric problems during the last 5 years or were cur-\nrently taking medications for psychiatric problems. To maxi-\nmize the infection rate, we also assessed specific levels of se-\nrum antibody to the challenge virus and excluded the\nparticipants with titers higher than 4. Demographics, weight,\nheight, and perceived social status were also measured at screen-\ning, while sleep, health practices, and other psychological mea-\nsures were assessed within the 23-day period just before the\nviral challenge.\nDuring the first 24 hours of quarantine (prechallenge), the\nvolunteersunderwentanasalexaminationandnasallavage.Base-\nline symptoms, nasal mucociliary clearance, and nasal mucus\nproduction were also measured. None of the volunteers re-\nported cold signs or symptoms, and no viral pathogen was iso-\nlated from any of the obtained nasal lavage samples. The par-\nticipants were then given nasal drops containing 125 times the\ndose of RV-39 needed to infect 50% of tissue cultures exposed\nto the virus. On each day of quarantine, they recorded their\nrespiratory symptoms and were assessed for nasal mucociliary\nclearance and nasal mucus production, and nasal lavage samples\nwere collected for virus culture. Approximately 28 days after\nthe challenge, blood samples were collected for serologic test-\ning. The investigators were blinded to all measures.\nThe participants were interviewed by phone on 14 consecu-\ntive evenings, with the first interview occurring 20 to 23 days\nbefore viral exposure. They were asked the following ques-\ntions based on key items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality In-\ndex and the Pittsburgh Sleep Diary7,8: What time did you lie\ndown to go to sleep last night? What time did you get out of\nbed this morning? How many minutes of sleep did you lose\nbetween the time you lay down to go to sleep (interviewer stated\nactual time) and the time you got out of bed (interviewer stated\nactual time) because you had difficulty falling asleep or you woke\nup and could not get back to sleep? Did you spend any time in\nbed between lying down to go to sleep (interviewer stated ac-\ntual time) and getting out of bed (interviewer stated actual time)\nintentionally awake (eg, reading or watching television)? If yes,\nfor how many minutes? Did you feel rested from your sleep\nwhen you awoke this morning (yes or no)?\nThe sleep scores were calculated for each of the 14 inter-\nview days. Sleep duration was scored as the number of hours\nslept (from the time the participant lay down to go to sleep un-\ntil the time he or she got out of bed minus the minutes of sleep\nlost minus the minutes he or she was intentionally awake), and\nsleep efficiency was scored as sleep duration divided by time\nin bed (from the time the participant lay down until the time\nhe or she got out of bed).7 We then averaged across the 14 days\n(at least 8 days of complete data were required; mean [SD] num-\nthe average sleep efficiency, and the percentage of days that the\nparticipant felt rested.\nWe controlled for viral immunity as assessed by the prechal-\nlenge antibody titer; age; body mass index2; race; income; edu-\ncation; sex; season of exposure (ie, spring, summer, autumn,\nor winter); psychological variables previously found to be as-\nsociated with risk for colds, including perceived social status,\nperceived stress, positive emotional style, extraversion, and\nagreeableness9-11; smoking rate; alcohol consumption; and ex-\nercise.

For exercise, participants\nwere asked, \"Did you exercise long enough to work up a sweat\nor get your heart thumping?\" \"If yes, \"For how many minutes\ndid you exercise?\" For smoking, \"Did you smoke any tobacco\nproduct?\" If yes, \"How many cigarettes, cigars, bowls of to-\nbacco?\" For alcohol consumption, \"Did you consume any al-\ncoholic drinks?\" If yes, \"How many (a glass of wine, a 12 ounce\nbeer, or a shot of hard liquor each equal 1 drink)?\" Scores for\neach behavior were computed as the arithmetic mean across\nPsychological variables that were assessed by question-\nnaire included a 10-item measure of the perceptions of stress\nin the participant's life12; the perceived socioeconomic rank as\nassessed by the participants placing themselves on a 9-rung lad-\nder in terms of where they stand in their country on income,\neducation, and occupation9; and extraversion and agreeable-\nness using the modified 5-item versions of the subscales from\nGoldberg's13 \"Big Five.\" Positive emotional style was assessed\nas the extent to which respondents reported feeling happy, calm,\nfull of pep, lively, and cheerful during each of the 14 interview\ndays, averaged across days.11\nVirus-specific neutralizing antibody titers were measured in se-\nrum samples collected before and approximately 28 days after\nvirus exposure14; the results were expressed as reciprocals of the\nfinal dilution of serum. Daily nasal lavage samples were frozen\nat -80\u00b0C and later cultured for RV using standard techniques.14\nOn each quarantine day, the participants rated the severity (dur-\ning the previous 24 hours) of each of 8 illness symptoms (nasal\ncongestion,sneezing,runnynose,earache,sinuspain,sorethroat,\ncough, and chest congestion) on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very\nsevere).15 Dailymucusproductionwasassessedbycollectingused\ntissues in sealed plastic bags.16 The bags were weighed, and the\nweight of the tissues and bags was subtracted. Nasal mucocili-\nary clearance function was assessed as the time required for the\ndye that was administered into the anterior area of the nose to\nreach the nasopharnyx.16 Baseline-adjusted daily scores for each\nmeasure were calculated by subtracting the appropriate base-\nline score from each postexposure daily score. Negative ad-\njusted scores were reassigned a value of 0. Total adjusted scores\nfor symptoms, mucus weight, and nasal clearance were calcu-\nlated by summing the respective adjusted daily scores over the\npostchallenge quarantine days.\nThe participants were considered to have a clinical cold if\nthey were both infected and met illness criteria. Infection was\ndefined as the recovery of the challenge virus on any of the\npostchallenge days or a 4-fold or greater increase in the virus-\nspecific serum neutralizing antibody titer (preexposure to 28\ndays postexposure).16 We used an objective illness criterion in\nthe primary analyses that required a total adjusted mucus weight\nof 10 g or more or a total adjusted nasal clearance time of 35\nminutes or more.6 By this criterion, the mean (SD) total ad-\nses using an illness criterion based on subject self-report.

Logistic regression was used to predict colds (1, yes; 0,\nno), and multiple linear regression was used to predict con-\ntinuous markers of objective illness and total subjective symp-\ntom scores. Sleep measures were treated as continuous vari-\nables, and we reported regression coefficients as well as their\nstandard errors and probability levels. To help clarify the na-\nture of the relationships and to provide a clearer estimate of\neffect sizes, we also fit regression equations using categorical\nmeasures of sleep (tertiles) and reported odds ratios (ORs) and\n95% confidence intervals (CIs). In the primary analyses, we re-\nported the association of sleep habits and both objective and\nsubjective cold criteria, but the remaining analyses focused on\nthe objectively determined outcome.\nRESULTS\ndeveloped a cold defined as infection and the objective cold\ncriterion; and 66 (43.1%) developed a cold defined as in-\nfection and the subjective (Jackson) criterion.\n(0.22) for the percentage of nights the participants felt\nrested.

Both associa-\ntions were graded. They were also robust in the face of\n16 control variables: prechallenge viral-specific anti-\nbody titers, age, body mass index, race, income, educa-\ntion, sex, season of exposure, psychological factors (per-\nceived stress, perceived social status, positive emotional\nstyle, extraversion, and agreeableness), and health prac-\ntices (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical ac-\ntivity). Associations of sleep duration and sleep effi-\nciency overlapped, with efficiency being the primary and\nindependent predictor. Interestingly, while measures es-\ntimating when a participant was sleeping (duration and\nefficiency) were predictive, the more evaluative sleep mea-\nsure--feeling rested--was not.\nMuch of what we know about sleep and health de-\nrives from prospective cohort studies that have used 1\nor 2 retrospective questions to assess habitual sleep du-\nration. These studies suggest that the lowest morbidity\n(coronary heart disease) and mortality generally occur\namong persons who report sleeping approximately 7 to\n8 hours a night.18,19 Our findings on risk for the com-\nmon cold suggest that there is a substantial risk associ-\nated with getting less than 7 hours of sleep per night. How-\never, unlike some of the mortality studies,18,19 we found\nthat increases in sleep duration above 8 hours are asso-\nciated with better (rather than poorer) health. One ex-\nplanation for elevated mortality among long sleepers is\nthat longer-duration sleep is merely a symptom of de-\npression, itself a risk factor for mortality. Our partici-\npants were screened for psychiatric disorders; there-\nfore, depression is not likely to be at play here. Another\nissue is that our sample was relatively young (mean age,\n37 years; maximum age, 55 years) and healthy, while evi-\ndence for longer sleep being detrimental derives from\nsamples that have included a large segment of older adults,\nmany of whom have chronic illnesses.\nSleep Efficiency, %\nAdjusted % With Colds by Objective Criteria\nFigure.

All rights reserved.\nThe data were quite consistent across outcome mea-\nsures, with the exception of nasal clearance function. The\nreason for this anomaly is not clear, although we found\nsurprisingly little variability (as compared with mucus\nweights or symptoms) in the day-to-day measures of na-\nsal clearance, suggesting a potential insensitivity of this\nmeasure.\nWhat mechanisms might link sleep to cold suscepti-\nbility? When the components of clinical illness (infec-\ntion and signs or symptoms) were examined separately,\nsleep efficiency but not sleep duration was associated with\nsigns and symptoms of illness. However, neither was as-\nsociated with infection (data not reported). This study\nwas designed to maximize the infection rate (partici-\npants selected for low antibody levels) and was not pow-\nered to fairly test whether sleep is associated with infec-\ntion (88% were infected). Consequently, no conclusions\nabout the role of sleep in infection can be made from this\nnull effect. However, the evidence is consistent with in-\ncreased clinical illness among individuals with poorer\nsleep being attributable to symptom expression. A pos-\nsible explanation for this finding is that sleep distur-\nbance influences the regulation of proinflammatory cy-\ntokines, histamines, and other symptom mediators that\nare released in response to infection.1\nThe relative ease of assessing self-reported sleep makes\nthese findings particularly useful to physicians and pa-\ntients,givingthemanapproximateindicatoronwhichthey\nyear-olds have found that about two-thirds report sleep-\ning 7 to 8 hours a night and approximately three-fourths\nreport 7 hours or more of sleep.20,21 Similar to the mortal-\nity studies,18,19,22 the data reported herein support the ar-\ngument that 7 to 8 hours of sleep is a reasonable target.\nHowever, they also suggest that even a minimal habitual\nfor an 8-hour sleeper) is associated with 3.9 times the risk\nof developing a cold.\nEvidence from actigraphy studies suggests that self-\nreported sleep slightly underestimates both duration and\ntotal number of nocturnal wakenings.23-25 Therefore, we\nmay want to be cautious about the exactness of self-\nreportedestimatesofsleepdurationandefficiencyandtreat\nthem as broad relative indicators. However, the actigra-\nphy studies suggesting self-report bias were conducted in\npersons with sleep disorders and other psychiatric and\nphysical problems.23-25 Self-report biases are likely less\nmarked in healthy samples with less disturbed sleep. More-\nover, if there are actually biases in self-reports of dura-\ntion and efficiency, these same biases would enter into pa-\ntients' attempts to meet specific sleep targets and hence\nhave little significance for clinical intervention. Finally,\nsince existing suggestions about what constitutes health-\npromoting sleep are based on studies of self-reported sleep\nhabits, our data can be more readily compared with ear-\nlier evidence on other morbidities and mortality.\nThat viral-challenge trials results are applicable to natu-\nral colds is supported by concordant evidence of these\ntrials, with epidemiologic data and by the close fit be-\ntween symptom timing and severity patterns and those\nfound in epidemiologic studies.10,26 Generalization of re-\nsults using RV-39 to those using other cold viruses is pro-\nvided by challenge studies showing that associations hold\nacross multiple upper respiratory viruses,10,11 including\nan earlier study of sleep efficiency and colds.6\nIn sum, according to our study results, measures of\nsleep predicted susceptibility to the development of a cold.\nAlthough both shorter sleep duration and lower sleep ef-\nficiency were associated with risk for illness, duration did\nnot predict independently of efficiency, which was a stron-\nger overall correlate of illness. Although the prospective\ndesign does not allow causal inference, it does eliminate\nreverse causation as an explanation. Because of the pro-\nspective design and the controls for multiple confound-\ning factors, these results strongly suggest the possibility\nof sleep playing a causal role in cold susceptibility. More-\nover, the use of a maximally reliable multiple day assess-\nment of sleep habits increases our confidence in the find-\nings of this study.\nCorrespondence: Sheldon Cohen, PhD, Department of\nPsychology, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Cohen had full access to all the\ndata in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity\nof the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.
