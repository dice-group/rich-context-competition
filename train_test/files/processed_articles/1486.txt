Screening was\ncategorized as those screened during the\nlast 5 years and told by health profes-\nsionals that they had high blood cho-\nlesterol, those screened during the last\n5 years and not told by health profes-\nsionals that they had high blood cho-\nlesterol, and those never screened or\nscreened more than 5 years ago. Cur-\nrent use of a cholesterol-lowering drug\nwas identified by self-reported taking\nof prescribed medication to decrease\nblood cholesterol levels. Participants\nwith high LDL-C levels were defined as\nunscreened if they were never screened\nor not screened during the last 5 years;\nundiagnosed if they were screened dur-\ning the last 5 years but never told they\nhad high blood cholesterol; and un-\ntreated or inadequately treated if they\nhad been screened and told they had\nhigh blood cholesterol, but their cho-\nlesterol was not controlled.\nData Analysis\nEstimated population prevalence and\nmeans with 95% confidence intervals\nwere calculated using SUDAAN statis-\ntical software (Research Triangle In-\nternational, Research Triangle Park,\nNorth Carolina) to account for nonre-\nsponse and complex sampling de-\nsign.13 The prevalence and means esti-\nmates were age-standardized to the\nused orthogonal polynomial coeffi-\ncients calculated recursively accord-\ning to the method of Fisher and Yates\nfor linear trend testing.13 Significance\nRESULTS\nThe weighted age-standardized esti-\nmates of CHD, CHD equivalents, CHD\nrisk factors, and ATP III risk catego-\nries are presented in TABLE 2 for each\nstudy cycle.

Several factors may contrib-\nute to this nondiagnosis. Our classifi-\ncation was based on the question, \"Have\nyou ever been told by a doctor or other\nhealth professional that your blood cho-\nlesterol level was high?\" Information\nabout when the participant was tested\nas well as their fasting status and com-\npleteness of the lipid profile is not\navailable in the NHANES question-\nnaires. Thus, a deterioration of lipid\nprofile since the last screening is pos-\nsible in some participants but is un-\nlikely to contribute substantially to our\nestimate.\nClinicians' awareness of and adher-\nence to the NCEP ATP III guidelines\nprobably play a key role. We found that\nassessing only total cholesterol and\nHDL-C levels instead of taking a com-\nplete fasting lipid profile as recom-\nmended in the NCEP ATP III guide-\nlines would misclassify approximately\n22% of participants as having optimal\nLDL-C levels when they really would\nbe in the high-risk category with high\nLDL-C levels. In a study of 500 ran-\ndomly selected US physicians, almost\nhalf failed to classify their patients' risk\nlevels correctly according to Framing-\nham scores.18 Lack of screening and di-\nagnosis can result in inappropriate treat-\nment.\nSecondary prevention has been\nproven to be cost-effective in reduc-\ning illness and death associated with\nCHD.19 However, our study found that\nalmost two-thirds of participants who\nwere at high risk for developing CHD\nwithin 10 years and who were eligible\nfor lipid-lowering drugs were not re-\nceiving medication. Our estimates\nwould be even higher had we used the\nmodification of the LDL-C goal for\nhigh-risk patients of less than 70 mg/dL\nNCEP ATP III report.20 A better under-\nstanding of factors leading to the non-\ndiagnosis of high LDL-C levels is\nneeded. Meanwhile, clinicians' com-\npliance with cardiovascular disease pre-\nvention guidelines can be improved\nthrough ongoing education.21\nEven when a clinician has opportu-\nnities to initiate therapeutic lifestyle\nchanges (eg, diet, exercise, and weight\ncontrol) or drug therapy according to\nthe NCEP ATP III guidelines, manage-\nment of high LDL-C levels may still be\nchallenging, especially in high-risk pa-\ntients. A recent study using data on\nnance organization administrative\nclaims database showed that LDL-C\ngoal attainment was not achieved\namong 61% of patients who received\nlipid drug treatment during the first 6\nmonths after an initial diagnosis of CHD\nor diabetes.22 Moreover, among those\nwho continued treatment for high\nLDL-C, half of the patients were un-\nable to reach their LDL-C goal regard-\nless of diagnosis (CHD vs diabetes), sex,\nstatin titration, lipid-modifying drug\nswitching, or treatment with a high-\npotency dosage of LDL-C\u00adlowering\ndrug. In a study of therapeutic life-\nstyle interventions that used 24-hour\ndietary recall data in 555 patients with\nCHD, only a small proportion (5%-\n12%) met the recommended consump-\ntion of vegetables, fruit, cereal fiber, and\ntrans-fat intake 1 year after diagnosis\nticipants in each) prospective observa-\ntional studies found that high baseline\nLDL-C values, pretreatment with cer-\ntain statins, high glycated hemoglobin\n) levels in patients with dia-\nbetes, and high body mass index were\nassociated with uncontrolled hyperlip-\napproximately 2% of participants in\nthe low-risk category had LDL-C lev-\nels appropriate for initiation of drug\ntherapy, and approximately 9% had\nlevels appropriate for the initiation of\ntherapeutic lifestyle changes. How-\never, use of drug therapy in young\nor low-risk adults remains controver-\nsial. The combination of low-fat diet,\nincreased physical activity, and\nweight control may decrease choles-\ndrug therapy.2 Results of 2 recent\nclinical trials show that a diet low in\nsaturated fat along with plant sterols\nand viscous fibers, soy protein, and\nnuts25 or, alternatively, therapeutic\nlifestyle changes combined with\ningestion of red yeast rice and fish oil\nsupplements, may be comparable\nwith statin use in lipid-lowering\nThe results of this analysis should be\ninterpreted in light of the following\nstudy limitations. First, the preva-\nlence of high LDL-C levels in the US\npopulation may be underestimated be-\ncause persons residing in long-term care\nfacilities are not included in the\nNHANES. Second, a misclassification\nbias is possible in our study: the pro-\nportion of participants in the high-\nrisk category may be underestimated\ndue to lack of data on peripheral vas-\ncular disease. In addition, the NHANES\nquestion on family history of heart\nattack or angina asks about first-\ndegree relatives younger than 50 years\nregardless of sex instead of using\nyounger than 55 years for men and\nyounger than 65 years for women,\nwhich are the ages considered to as-\nsess family risk factor in the NCEP ATP\nIII guidelines.2 Thus, some partici-\npants may be placed in the low-risk\ngroup instead of the intermediate- or\nhigh-risk category if the recom-\nmended age criteria by sex had been\nused. Third, although the collection of\nexamination and laboratory data was\nstandardized,self-reporteddatafromin-\nterviews and questionnaires may be\nsubject to misunderstanding and re-\ncall bias. Finally, although these analy-\nses show a striking decrease in the\nprevalence of LDL-C levels over 8 years,\nthe cause of the decline in LDL-C lev-\nels cannot be determined. There were\n4 different surveys over the 8-year span,\nbut each one was a separate cross-\nsectional study and precludes deter-\nmining causality. In addition, even\nthough temporal changes in potential\ncontributing factors, such as improve-\nment in treatment of LDL-C levels, can\nbe documented, the missing or lim-\nited information on the duration of\ntreatment, dose titration, and changes\nin type of medication used threatens the\nvalidity of such analyses.\nIn conclusion, among the NHANES\npopulation aged 20 years or older, the\nprevalence of high LDL-C levels de-\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Kuklina had full access to\nall of the data in the study and takes responsibility for\nthe integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data\nanalysis.\nStudy concept and design: Kuklina, Yoon, Keenan.\nAcquisition of data: Kuklina.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Kuklina, Yoon,\nKeenan.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Kuklina.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important in-\ntellectual content: Kuklina, Yoon, Keenan.\nStatistical analysis: Kuklina.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support: Kuklina.\nStudy supervision: Yoon, Keenan.\nFinancial Disclosures: None reported.\nDisclaimer: The findings and conclusions in this ar-\nticle are those of the authors and do not necessarily\nrepresent official views of the Centers for Disease Con-\ntrol and Prevention.\nAdditional Contributions: Darwin Labarthe, MD, MPH,\nPhD, director of the Division for Heart Disease and\nStroke Prevention, National Center for Chronic Dis-\nease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, provided insightful\nand critical review of the manuscript.\nREFERENCES\n1.
