    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: The use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) has grown worldwide, and there\nare concerns about increased unsubstantiated long-term use. The aim of the study was to\ndescribe the real-world use of PPIs over the past decade in an entire national population.\nMethods: This was a nationwide population-based drug-utilization study. Patterns of\noutpatient PPI use among adults in Iceland between 2003 and 2015 were investigated,\nincluding annual incidence and prevalence, duration of use, and dose of tablet used (lower\nversus higher), as well as the proportion of PPI use attributable to gastroprotection.\nResults: We observed 1,372,790 prescription fills over the entire study period, of which 95%\nwere for higher-dose PPIs. Annual incidence remained stable across time (3.3\u00ad4.1 per 100\npersons per year), while the annual prevalence increased from 8.5 per 100 persons to 15.5 per\n100 persons. Prevalence increased with patient age and was higher among women than men.\nDuration of treatment increased with patients' age (36% of users over 80 years remained on\ntreatment after 1 year compared with 13% of users aged 19\u00ad39 years), and was longer among\nthose initiating on a higher dose compared with a lower dose. The proportion of PPI users\nconcurrently using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decreased over the study period,\nwhile the proportion concurrently using acetylsalicylic acid, oral anticoagulants, or platelet\ninhibitors increased.\nConclusions: In this nationwide study, a considerable increase in overall outpatient use of\nPPIs over a 13-year period was observed, particularly among older adults. Patients were\nincreasingly treated for longer durations than recommended by clinical guidelines and mainly\nwith higher doses.\n",

Specifically, we aimed to\ndetermine patterns of use by patient and pre-\nscriber characteristics, including treatment dura-\ntion contrasting between higher- and lower-dose\nPPIs. Furthermore, we described the proportion\nof PPI use attributable to gastroprotection.\nMethods\nThis was an observational drug-utilization study\ndescribing the use of PPIs among the adult\nIcelandic population (19 years or older) during\nData sources\nThe Icelandic Medicines Registry (IMR) contains\nindividual information on all dispensed prescrip-\ntion drugs in outpatient care in Iceland since 1\nJanuary 2003. We received information from the\nIMR on PPI dispensing during the study period.\nAs of 2010, the IMR also contained information\non dispensed prescription drugs within nursing\nhomes in Iceland.31,32 Completeness of the IMR\nranged from 91% to 98% of all dispensed pre-\nscription drugs for the study years. Information on\nwholesale statistics of PPIs was provided by the\nIcelandic Medicines Agency.33\nThe Icelandic Population Register provided\ninformation about all citizens, Icelandic and for-\neign, residing in Iceland during the study period,\nincluding data on month and year of birth, sex,\nand date of death (if appropriate).\nUsing personal identification numbers, unique to\nevery individual residing in Iceland, we linked\ntogether the variables from these two registries.\nStudy drugs\nThe drugs of interest were classified according to\nthe World Health Organization anatomical thera-\npeutic chemical/defined daily doses (ATC/DDD)\nclassification.34 During the study period, four PPI\nsubstances were prescribed in Iceland: omeprazole\nWe further categorized each PPI type by available\ntablet strengths in milligrams as higher or lower\ndose. In the National Institute for Health and Care\nExcellence (NICE) clinical guidelines, PPI doses\n(in mg) are defined as standard/full dose, double\ndose, or low dose.12 In the current study, standard\nand double doses were defined as higher-dose PPIs\nand low doses as lower-dose PPIs (Table 1).\nover-the-counter (OTC) products in Iceland.\nHowever, the majority of PPIs during the study\nperiod were obtained by prescription rather than\nthese years (Supplementary Table S1).\nInformation on the indication for the prescription\nof PPIs was not available in the IMR. We explored\npotential reasons for PPI use by assessing the pro-\nportion of use attributable to gastroprotection,\nthat is, concurrent use of PPIs with acetylsalicylic\ning M01AX), oral anticoagulants (ATC codes:\nAnalysis\nWe presented overall use of PPIs in Iceland as the\ntotal number of dispensed DDDs to the adult pop-\nulation stratified by calendar year, PPI substance,\n\u00d3\u00d6 H\u00e1lfd\u00e1narson, A Potteg\u00e5rd et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 3\nand specialty of the prescribing physician (primary\ncare, gastroenterology, and other specialties).\nAnnual prevalence (per 100 persons) of PPI use\nwas defined as the number of adult individuals\nwho filled at least one prescription in the relevant\nadult population residing in Iceland on 1 July of\nthat year.

For\neach patient, we estimated duration of each filled\nprescription based on days' supply, assuming one\ntablet as a daily dose. We allowed for a grace\nperiod of 108 days (2 \u00d7 the median number of\ndays between dispensing, that is, the number of\ndays by which 50% of the population had received\na subsequent dispensing), to account for irregular\nprescription fills and added to the duration of\neach prescription. If a patient did not fill a new\nprescription within this time we considered them\nto have discontinued their PPI treatment. They\ncould then later re-enter the user population upon\ninitiating a new treatment episode. We followed\nincident PPI users for 5 years, from the date of\ntheir first PPI prescription (day 0), and calculated\nthe proportion of patients covered by dividing the\nnumber of users that were using the drug at day X\n(defined by 30-day intervals) by the number of\npeople who were still alive and had not migrated\nat day X.

We\nfound that 22% remained on treatment 1 year\nafter treatment initiation. The proportion was\nhighest among the oldest age group (36%) and\nlowest among the youngest (13%). Extended\ntreatment durations among older adults are con-\ncerning in light of widespread polypharmacy and\nincreased risk of adverse events with PPI use.41 In\nfact, we observed that nearly half of older adults in\nour data used PPIs concurrently with NSAIDs,\nacetylsalicylic acid, oral anticoagulants, or platelet\ninhibitors, reflecting the level of polypharmacy\namong older adults using PPIs. Given the recent\nevidence of PPIs potentially facilitating injurious\neffects of NSAIDs in the small intestines, espe-\ncially in older people and other high-risk patients,20\nthis pattern of high concurrent drug use might be\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 11\n8 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\nconcerning. However, as we were unable to link\nprescription data with clinical information, we\ncannot rule out that these patients were appropri-\nately prescribed PPIs as bleeding prophylaxis.\nThe vast majority of PPI users in our population\ninitiated treatment with higher-dose PPIs and\nafter 1 year 21% remained on that treatment, for\nexample, had not switched to lower-dose PPIs or\ndiscontinued treatment. This might indicate that\ntheir underlying symptoms are more severe than\namong those initiating treatment on lower doses\nand reflect the level of difficulty some users expe-\nrience when discontinuing treatment due to\nresurfacing symptoms.42\nRecently, Helgadottir and colleagues demon-\nstrated that among confirmed GORD patients on\nlong-term PPI treatment, women were more\nlikely than men to be able to lower their dose by\nhalf, while still achieving symptom relief.43 In our\nstudy we found no observable difference in treat-\nment durations by patient sex, nor did women\nseem more likely to initiate or maintain treatment\non lower-dose PPIs. Thus, it is conceivable that\nwomen might be able to tolerate lower PPI doses\nthan is mostly used nowadays.\nThe present study has several limitations. First, as\nwith all register-based drug studies, it is not cer-\ntain that individuals who filled the PPI prescrip-\ntions actually consumed the drugs. To address\nthis, we performed a sensitivity analysis\n(Supplementary Figure S1) requiring at least two\nPPI prescription fills within a year to count as a\nprevalent PPI user, which resulted in lowered\nprevalence estimates. Actual consumption might\nthus in reality lie between these two measures of\nprevalence. Second, the study data did not con-\ntain information on clinical characteristics such as\nindications underlying the PPI prescriptions and/\nor the severity of symptoms, which prevented us\nfrom drawing sound conclusions on the appropri-\nateness of PPI prescribing in our population.\nThird, information on PPI use within nursing\nhomes was not included in the IMR until 2010,\nFigure 5. Concurrent use of proton-pump inhibitors with drugs that are ulcerogenic or increase the risk of\nupper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Fourth, informa-\ntion on exact dosing for each prescription was not\navailable in our data preventing us from accu-\nrately assessing prescribed doses. Our assess-\nments of PPI doses were based on dispensed\ntablet strengths and therefore only an approxima-\ntion of actual doses. Finally, PPIs became availa-\nproportion of PPIs sold OTC was relatively low,\nranging from 1% to 10% of the total number of\ntherefore only have led to a slight underestima-\ntion of overall PPI use.\nIn conclusion, over a 13-year follow-up period we\nobserved a considerable increase of real-world PPI\nuse in a nationwide population setting, particu-\nlarly among older adults. We found that a number\nof patients stayed on PPI treatment for longer\nperiods than is recommended by clinical guide-\nlines, mainly on higher doses. In view of these\nresults, further initiatives towards appropriate pre-\nscribing of PPIs, especially in terms of the adop-\ntion of de-prescribing strategies, are warranted.\n"
