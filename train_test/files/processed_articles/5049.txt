The societal impact of homicide is exacerbated\nwhen cases take a particularly long time to solve or even remain completely unsolved,\nusually referred to as `uncleared'. An uncleared homicide typically means police have\nnot identified a suspect or do not have enough evidence for arrest. More generally, police\nare simply missing essential information about the suspect(s), including the victim\u00ad\noffender relationship, particularly when, for a period of time, the identity of the victim\nremains unknown (Quinet and Nunn, 2014).\nOutside Europe, homicide clearance rates currently range from 96 percent in South\nand Tobago (Maguire et al., 2010). In non-European Western countries, homicide clear-\nance rates vary from 91 percent in New Zealand (New Zealand Crime Statistics, 2015),\n87 percent in Australia (Chan and Payne, 2013), to 75 percent in Canada (Mahony and\nEuropean countries has revealed 98 percent of homicides being solved in Finland (Lehti\ncent in England & Wales (Smith et al., 2012), and about 80 percent in Sweden (Granath,\nOne may question, however, the validity of these figures when making interna-\ntional comparisons. Linking international homicide clearance rates is hindered by the\ndifferential use of definitions. Further, some reports exclude homicides committed in\nconjunction with a felony or other crime. In these statistics, homicides are coded as a\nby-product of another felony \u00ad for example, a homicide committed in the course of a\nrobbery is coded as a `robbery gone wrong' rather than a homicide (Finch, 2001).\nMuch of the homicide clearance literature to date relies on data from the United States\nbeen possible to compare homicide clearance rates between European countries,\nowing to differences in definitions, data sources and criminal justice procedures. To\novercome these limitations, for the purpose of this study we will make use of the\nEuropean Homicide Monitor, a unified data system including information on homi-\ncide cases, offenders and victims in four European countries: Finland, the Netherlands,\nSweden and Switzerland.\nThe need to shed light on internationally comparable homicide clearance rates in\nEurope is at least threefold. First, homicide is the most violent form of crime. The impact\nand consequences of homicide are severe for the relatives, friends and acquaintances\ninvolved. Unsolved homicides cause considerable psychological and emotional damage\nfor the bereaved. The uncertainty and the apparent lack of a motive for their deaths\ninhibit adequate mourning (Poijula, 2010; Wijk et al., 2013). Unsolved homicides are\naccompanied by feelings of insecurity, turmoil and injustice.\nLiem et al. 3\nSecond, unsolved homicides \u00ad owing to the long duration of investigations, whether\nor not followed by costly cold case investigations \u00ad are associated with high financial\ncosts, without leading to a positive outcome. Poor clearance rates may not only reduce\nmorale among police officers but also lead to diminished public trust in the criminal\njustice system, including the police (Riedel, 1999).\nAdditionally, certain homicides \u00ad particularly homicides taking place in a criminal\nsetting \u00ad that remain uncleared may constitute a risk of initiating new homicides as\nrevenge. Such chain-reactions and connections between certain homicides have been\nreported in prior studies (Granath, 2011). It is therefore fundamental to gain insight into\nwhat factors determine homicide clearance and, in turn, provide the basis for strategies\nnecessary to increase the homicide clearance rate.\nTheoretical background\nExamining the reasons for homicide clearance has potential policy relevance for improv-\ning low clearance rates, and may provide a window into police allocation of investigative\neffort (Roberts and Lyons, 2009). Several theoretical frames have previously been used\nin relation to homicide clearance rates. Roughly, these theories can be divided in two\ngroups: Black's theory on discretional factors (Black, 1970) and Gottfredson and\nHindelang's theory on non-discretional factors (Gottfredson and Hindelang, 1979).\nWhereas the first theoretical perspective holds that the police and political forces play a\ndecisive role in the (un)cleared status of a crime, the second perspective suggests that\ncase-specific factors affect the homicide clearance rate. Put simply, is homicide clear-\nance a function of extra-legal factors, such as the likeability of victims and offenders, or\nis clearance a product of the availability of investigative evidence leading to an arrest?\nDiscretional factors\nBlack's Theory of Law (1970) suggests that police use discretion in clearing homicide\ncases: they base their choices on the social characteristics of the victims and the areas in\nuation standpoint, cases with specific victim characteristics receive more `law', and\nhence are more likely to be solved, compared with other cases. For example, cases that\ninvolve female victims, white victims and younger victims are thought to be more likely\nto be cleared compared with cases that involve `less likeable' victims, such as victims\nwith a prior arrest record (Regoeczi et al., 2008; Roberts, 2007; Roberts and Lyons,\nsized that crimes are less likely to be solved when they occur in areas with lower social-\neconomic status, lower educational attainment levels, higher unemployment rates and a\nsmaller percentage of owner-occupied dwelling units (Litwin and Xu, 2007). What fol-\nlows is that those homicides will get less police attention and therefore are less often\nsolved (Lyons and Roberts, 2014). Later theorists have added that solving crimes, includ-\ning homicides, is a political process (Davis et al., 2014). From this perspective, the strat-\negy and amount of law available are not determined by the individual police detective\nbut are orchestrated at higher organizational levels. Here, the quantity of law given to\neach homicide case is affected by the culture and organization of the police force. In the\nsame line of reasoning, heavy crime workloads are thought to be associated with lower\nclearance rates (Par\u00e9 et al., 2007), suggesting that a high homicide rate goes hand in hand\nwith low clearance rates, although empirical findings assessing this premise are mixed\nNon-discretional factors\nRather than considering discretionary factors or political forces as an explanation for the\nprocesses that lead to an (un)successful clearance, Gottfredson and Hindelang (1979)\nsuggest that non-discretional factors, or factors outside police control, predominantly\ndetermine the odds of clearance. From this point of view, because homicide is such a\nunique crime, there is a strong organizational pressure on police always to be equally\nattentive to solving the case, irrespective of who the victim is or where the crime occurs\n(Litwin, 2004). From this perspective, only non-discretionary factors constitute essential\npredictors for clearance status, such as weapon type, location of the victim's body, area\npopulation, the relationship between victim and offender, homicide circumstances and\nsimultaneously committed offences (Litwin and Xu, 2007; Lyons and Roberts, 2014).\nEach of these factors, Hindelang and colleagues (1979) argue, influence the value and\namount of information available to the police, which in turn influences the clearance rate.\nHomicide clearance, according to this perspective, is thus primarily a function of whether\ninvestigators have enough evidence to make an arrest and not a choice of how vigorously\nto investigate (Roberts and Lyons, 2009).\nPrevious findings\nSo far, research has not provided strong support for Black's police discretion perspective.\nIt should be noted, however, that Black's theories have mostly been tested in democratic\nsocieties where the police force is under the more or less strict control of civil society.\nResearch in other types of societies is scarce at best. Keeping this caveat in mind, some\nstudies find that homicide clearance is equally likely for male and female victims\n(Addington, 2006; Litwin, 2004), whereas other studies suggest that cases with female\nvictims are more likely to be solved (Lee, 2005; Regoeczi et al., 2000). In terms of age,\nthe literature consistently points out that homicides of children have a high likelihood of\nbeing solved, owing to the frequent presence of family members in their company\n(Regoeczi et al., 2008). Homicides with elderly victims, however, have a lower clearance\nrate, which is probably because elderly people are more subject to robberies by unknown\nodemographic characteristics, such as marital status, also seem to influence the likeli-\nhood of clearance, as previous studies found cases involving divorced or single victims\nto be among the lowest clearance categories (Riedel, 1999; Silverman and Kennedy,\n1987). In terms of ethnic background, some studies find cases with ethnic minority vic-\ntims more likely to be cleared than those with ethnic majority victims (Regoeczi et al.,\n2000), whereas other studies identified cases with ethnic minority victims less likely to\nbe cleared (Litwin, 2004; Roberts and Lyons, 2011). Further, the relationship between\nLiem et al. 5\neconomically disadvantaged areas and clearance rate also seems to be mixed. Because\nthe solvability of cases occurring in community areas with greater economic disadvan-\ntage seems to be sensitive to temporal context (Litwin and Xu, 2007), so far there is no\nstraightforward support for Black's (1970) discretional factors.\nThere is some evidence that non-discretional (situational) characteristics may influ-\nence the likelihood of homicide clearance, with the availability of physical evidence and\ninformation being more decisive factors (Roberts, 2007). Homicides that include victims\nwho were found in public spaces, for example, seem to have a higher clearance rate\ncompared with homicides with victims who were hidden from the public eye, such as\nhomicides that lacked eyewitnesses (Sturup et al., 2015) or homicides that have taken\nplace in alleys (Litwin and Xu, 2007; Lyons and Roberts, 2014). In addition, cases with\nvictims found in private locations (such as homes or apartments) are the most likely to be\net al., 1999), since in those cases the perpetrator is almost always the (estranged) intimate\npartner or another family member (Litwin and Xu, 2007). Further, in terms of area popu-\nlation, findings are mixed. Some studies find homicides in populated areas to be more\nlikely to be cleared than those in less populated areas, which can be attributed to the\nwillingness of witnesses in densely populated areas to share information (Wellford et al.,\n1999). Others, conversely, find homicides occurring in a small town or sparsely popu-\nlated area more likely to be cleared (Litwin, 2004). Also, US studies find that homicides\ncommitted with a firearm are less likely to be cleared compared with cases involving\nother types of weapons (Litwin and Xu, 2007; Sturup et al., 2015), related to less forensic\nevidence being left at the scene and the accompanying greater physical distance between\nvictim and perpetrator (Geberth, 1996; see Roberts, 2007). Findings on the influence of\nalcohol intoxication are mixed: whereas some studies find alcohol intoxication to be\nassociated with lower clearance rates (Regoeczi et al., 2008), others report that cases are\nmore likely to be solved if the victim is intoxicated with alcohol (Granath, 2011; Sturup\net al., 2015). Finally, research shows that homicides are less likely to be cleared when\nthere is a concomitant felony, or when the homicide is drug-related or gang-related, com-\npared with homicides where a general altercation constitutes the main motive (Litwin\nand Xu, 2007; Regoeczi et al., 2000). This can be attributed to the fact that such homi-\ncides tend to be committed in areas with a lower likelihood of willing witnesses. Also, as\nRoberts (2007) pointed out, these homicides tend to have a random `hit and run' nature\nand are therefore harder to investigate effectively. In addition, such drug and felony\nhomicides typically involve strangers, which may further complicate the investigation\nbecause it is harder to identify a suspect (Jarvis and Regoeczi, 2009; Roberts, 2007).\nAgain, the vast majority of these prior studies have been conducted in the United States.\nSo far, it is not known to what extent these findings are also applicable to homicide clear-\nance in Western Europe.\nAim\nThe aim of this study is at least twofold. First, by making use of a unique, homogeneous\nmonitoring system, we seek to provide a very first overview of differences in homicide\nclearance in four West European countries: Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and\nSwitzerland. Second, we aim to assess which factors influence differences in homicide\nclearance both within and between these European countries. Studying homicide clear-\nance allows us to better understand the factors that influence clearance and helps provide\ninsight into how clearance rates might be improved (Roberts, 2007).\nMethodology\nThe European Homicide Monitor\nCause of death statistics, police statistics and other types of homicide data can be used to\nassess the frequency of homicides in different countries, but their comparability is not\nwithout problems owing \u00ad among other factors \u00ad to differential inclusion criteria. Further,\nwhereas some datasets include only victim-based information, other data sources are\nmostly perpetrator-based, hampering the matching and comparability of figures derived\nfrom these datasets. Detailed national data on the characteristics of homicides are even\nless comparable owing to legal and definitional differences. To overcome these limita-\ntions, we have constructed a joint homicide database entitled the European Homicide\nMonitor (EHM), enabling comparisons and analyses among European countries (for a\nThe EHM consists of 85 variables and includes victim, offender and incident charac-\nteristics. There are differences in the degree to which countries possess detailed informa-\ntion on each homicide. In the EHM, homicide is defined as an intentional criminal act of\nviolence by one or more human beings resulting in the death of one or more other human\nbeings. This definition covers similar legal codes for homicide in each of the four coun-\ntries studied and roughly covers the definition used in other multisite datasets such as the\nNational Violent Death Reporting System (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\n2016). In Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden, the definition covers the legal codes of\nmurder, manslaughter, infanticide and assault leading to death. Attempted homicides,\nsuicides, abortion, euthanasia and assistance with suicide are not included in the data.\nNeither are cases of involuntary manslaughter by, for example, drunk driving, nor cases\nof intentional but (by court decision) legally justified killings \u00ad for example, police offic-\ners shooting an individual in self-defence. Switzerland uses a slightly different defini-\ntion, which leads to the exclusion of assaults leading to death and the inclusion of killings\nfrom legitimate self-defence.1 For this study, we will apply the EHM framework to pro-\nvide an overview of all homicides that took place in the Netherlands, Sweden and\nHomicide data sources\nFinnish homicide data in the period 2003\u00ad14 have been maintained by the Institute of\nCriminology and Legal Policy at the University of Helsinki (ICLP) and have been added\ninto the Finnish Homicide Monitor (FHM). The FHM is based on information produced\nduring preliminary police investigations, and collected directly by the chief investigator\non a compulsory standard electronic form. For crimes that are not cleared within\nLiem et al. 7\na reasonable amount of time, the available data are registered about one year after the\ninitiation of the investigation, provided that the case is still being investigated as a prob-\nable homicide. The FHM contains a great number of detailed variables related to victim,\noffender and case characteristics, including external data on prior criminal court convic-\ntions of perpetrators and victims, and on court rulings. Owing to the extremely small\nnumber of unsolved cases in Finland during the period studied (nine cases), the outcome\nvariable was differentially defined in Finland. Cases whose clearance took less than 30\ndays constituted the outcome. These formed 93 percent of all homicides during the\nperiod in the country. Additionally, the observation period was extended to cover the\nHomicide data from the Netherlands for the period 2009\u00ad14 stem from three sources:\nmedia reports, police data and court files. Media reports on homicides are retrieved from\nthe Dutch Associated Press and LexisNexis. These reports are completed and verified\nwith digitalized national police data on homicide events. Third, homicide data are com-\npleted and verified by assessing hard-copy court files, which include the criminal pro-\nceedings of the case, interview excerpts with suspects, relatives and witnesses and, in\nseveral cases, forensic mental health reports.\nHomicide data from Sweden for the years 2009\u00ad13 are collated by the Swedish\nNational Council for Crime Prevention. The data include all cases known to the author-\nities as committed in 2009\u00ad13, with the clearance status (solved or as yet unsolved)\nregistered in over 99 percent of all cases. All assessments of cases are based on police\nfiles, the verdicts from the court (if a trial has been carried out) and records of a foren-\nsic psychiatric examination when such an examination had been carried out. In short,\nthe data contain a large number of variables with individual-level information on case,\nvictim and offender factors, providing possibilities for disaggregated analyses of clear-\nance trends. For detailed case, victim and offender analyses, data were available for the\nHomicide data from Switzerland stem from the Swiss Homicide Project, which con-\ntains a database covering all intentional, completed homicides in Switzerland in the time\nperiod 2005\u00ad14. This project is conducted by the University of St. Gallen and financed\nby the Swiss National Science Foundation. Homicide cases are identified by the cantonal\ndepartments of public prosecution, which additionally provided information about\nexceptionally cleared cases. Data on homicides with perpetrators undergoing a court\nprocedure stem from court files. For detailed case, victim and offender analyses, homi-\nDefinitions of variables\nEHM homicide incident characteristics include the homicide location, which is regarded\nas public when the event took place in a location such as a park, forest, recreational area,\nshop, restaurant, bar, street, public transportation or the workplace. A private location\nincludes the home of the victim or offender, a hotel, motel, dormitory or car. The modus\noperandi was determined by the cause of death of the victim based on external causes of\nmorbidity,accordingtotheWorldHealthOrganizationICD10(InternationalClassification\nof Disease) list of `Assaults'. In applying this system, the EHM employs the same\ndefinition as the International Classification of Crimes for Statistical Purposes of the\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Here, causes of death include firearms, blunt\ninstruments, sharp instruments, strangulation, hitting/kicking or other modus operandi,\nsuch as dying of poisoning, explosives, drowning, fire or motor-vehicle-related injuries.\nHomicide types include domestic homicides (partner, child and other family killing),\ncriminal milieu homicides (rip deals, narcotics affairs and homicides taking place between\nperpetrator and victim who are both involved in criminal activities, the homicide having\nto do with such activities), robbery killings (commercial businesses, private homicides\nand street robberies), homicides in nightlife violence, sexual homicides and other homi-\ncides. It should be noted that, because these homicide types are partially based on a known\nvictim\u00adoffender relationship, this variable is often missing in uncleared cases. For this\nproject, we use the following homicide victim and offender characteristics: gender, age\nand ethnicity. Whereas in US literature, race (White, Black, Latino) (Litwin, 2004;\nRegoeczi et al., 2000; Roberts and Lyons, 2011) has been used to denote majority and\nminority groups, we distinguish between ethnic majority ((parents or individual) same\ncountry of birth) and ethnic minority groups ((parents or individual) other country of\nbirth). In other words, individuals born in the same country where the homicide took\nplace, but with parents born in another country, are classed as ethnic minority.\nIn the EHM, a homicide is deemed to be solved if the police considered the case\ncleared with the arrest of a suspect or considered it as exceptionally cleared. Exceptionally\ncleared cases involve a suspect or perpetrator who is known to the police but for some\nreason cannot be (lawfully) arrested. Examples include charges being rejected by the\nprosecutor, perpetrators who committed suicide or perpetrators who left the country and\ntherefore the jurisdiction area (Riedel and Boulahanis, 2007). Exceptional clearances are\nalso sometimes referred to as `administrative closures' (Maguire et al., 2010).\nAnalyses\nIn order to determine differences between cleared and uncleared cases, ANOVA and chi-\nsquared tests were used. To estimate the probability of a homicide being solved or\nremaining unsolved, or, in Finland, being solved in less than 30 days or not being solved\nin this time frame, and to further assess the marginal effect of both discretional and non-\ndiscretional variables, multivariate analyses were conducted. Since our main outcome\nwas dichotomous (a homicide being solved or not; in Finland, solved in less than 30 days\nor in 30 days or more), we employed binomial logistic regression, using the enter method\nand reporting the odds ratio (OR). Analyses used SPSS version 23.\nResults\nDescriptive analyses\nNetherlands, 490 in Sweden and 225 in Switzerland. Table 1 reflects the victimization\nrates for each of these countries in the time period studied. Throughout the study period,\nthe homicide rate in three West European countries declined, from 2.24 to 1.63 per\nLiem et al. 9\nSweden. In Switzerland, in this period the homicide rate fluctuated around 0.50 per\n100,000. In the period under study, on average 98 percent of homicides were cleared in\nFinland, 77 percent in the Netherlands, 83 percent in Sweden and 95 percent in\nSwitzerland. The median number of days for cases to be solved was one day in Finland,\none day in the Netherlands, one day in Sweden and zero days (the same day the homicide\ntook place) in Switzerland.\nConsidering homicide event characteristics, results showed that in Finland, the\nNetherlands and Sweden, homicides taking place in a public setting were significantly\nmore difficult to clear compared with homicides taking place in a private setting (see\nTable 2). In Finland, 88 percent of `public' homicides were cleared in less than 30 days\nversus 95 percent of `private'homicides, in the Netherlands the clearance rate of `public'\nhomicides was 68 percent versus 81 percent of `private' homicides, and in Sweden 73\npercent versus 89 percent of homicides occurring indoors. In Switzerland, because of the\nvery small proportion of unsolved cases, the difference in clearance rate between private\nand public homicides remained non-significant. In terms of geographical location, in\nmost countries no significant differences in clearance were found in homicides occurring\nin urban versus in rural areas. The Netherlands constituted an exception, with a signifi-\ncantly higher likelihood of homicide clearance in rural areas (79 percent) versus urban\nareas (73 percent). Further, although in all countries but Sweden, the percentage of sin-\ngle-victim homicides being solved seemed to be somewhat lower than the percentage of\nmultiple-victim homicides being solved, this finding remained non-significant in all of\nthe countries. Regarding the modus operandi, results indicated various patterns: First,\nthere were significant differences in the clearance speed among Finnish homicides in\nterms of the method used in the homicide. A closer look at the results showed that homi-\ncides committed by `other' methods, such as drowning, smoke, fire, explosives or by\nmotor vehicle, were harder to clear (81 percent) as compared with other categories,\nincluding homicides committed by firearms (95 percent). Second, results indicated quite\nTable 1.

(Continued)\nthe opposite in both the Netherlands and Sweden, where homicides committed by fire-\narm had overall much lower clearance rates (56 percent in the Netherlands and 57 per-\ncent in Sweden) compared with homicides committed by other means. In Switzerland,\nwith an overall high clearance rate, the modus operandi did not influence the clearance\nrate, insofar as all homicides committed with a blunt instrument, by hitting or kicking, or\nby other methods were solved (100 percent). What all four countries had in common was\na relatively high clearance rate (in Finland, fast clearance speed) among homicides com-\nmitted by blunt or sharp instruments and by so-called `hands-on' methods, such as stran-\ngulation and hitting or kicking, with overall percentages ranging from 85 percent to 100\npercent. Although there were no significant differences in terms of the type of homicide\nin both Finland and Switzerland, in the Netherlands and Sweden the type of homicide did\ninfluence the likelihood of clearance. In both countries, homicides committed in a crimi-\nnal milieu (46 percent in the Netherlands and 48 percent in Sweden) and homicides in the\ncontext of a robbery (75 percent in the Netherlands and 73 percent in Sweden) had over-\nall much lower clearance rates compared with other types of homicide, such as domestic\nhomicides, nightlife homicides or sexual homicides.\nIn terms of victim characteristics (Table 3), in neither Finland nor Switzerland did\ngender seem to be associated with differences in homicide clearance, as both male (93\npercent in Finland and 95 percent in Switzerland) and female homicides (93 percent in\nFinland and 95 percent in Switzerland) were cleared by a similar rate. In the Netherlands\nand Sweden, in contrast, homicides involving a female victim had significantly higher\nclearance rates (90 percent in the Netherlands and 96 percent in Sweden) compared with\nhomicides involving a male victim (71 percent in the Netherlands and 76 percent in\nSweden). Significant differences between cleared and uncleared cases in terms of victim\nage were found in all countries except Switzerland. Whereas in Finland the cases hardest\nto clear were those with young victims under the age of 6 (81 percent) and with old vic-\ntims over 65 (88 percent), different patterns were observed in the Netherlands and\nSweden. Here, the lowest clearance rates were found among victims aged between 25\nand 39 (71 percent in the Netherlands and 69 percent in Sweden). Finally, bivariate\nanalyses for Finland, the Netherlands and Switzerland revealed no significant differ-\nences in homicide clearance rates between events involving an ethnic minority victim\ncompared with cases involving an ethnic majority victim. In Sweden, these groups dif-\nfered significantly, with cases involving an ethnic minority victim having a lower clear-\nance rate (65 percent) compared with cases with an ethnic majority victim (91 percent).\nMultivariate analyses\nIn line with the results from the binary analysis, multivariate analyses (see Table 4a)\nshowed that the likelihood of fast homicide clearance in Finland decreased significantly\nwhen young victims (OR = 0.306) or elderly victims (OR = 0.427) were involved.

Internationally, these rates are extraor-\ndinary high, even in comparison with other European countries such as Italy (67 percent\nEngland & Wales (85 percent) (Smith et al., 2012) and France (80 percent) (Mucchielli,\n2012). Because of the very high clearance rate in these countries, few differences were\nfound in homicide clearance in both bivariate and multivariate comparisons.\nResults showed that the country homicide rate does not seem to have a straightfor-\nward relationship with the clearance rate in any of the years under analysis, Finland is a\ncase in point. With its relatively high homicide rate in the European context, Finnish\nhomicide clearance rates are among the highest. The lack of such a relationship rejects to\nsome extent the assumption that a greater homicide caseload limits police resources and\nmakes cases inherently more difficult to clear (Par\u00e9 et al., 2007). This also raises ques-\ntions, as Litwin and Xu (2007) point out, about whether country homicide rates are a\nvalid measure of police workload. One should, however, note that, although the Finnish\nhomicide rates are high in Europe, in the global context they are among the lowest; thus\neven Finland is not a very good case to test the workload hypothesis.\nFrom Black's (1970) theoretical perspective, it would further be expected that discre-\ntional factors, such as the `likeability' of the victim, would provide an explanation for\nhomicides being solved or remaining unsolved. Based on Gottfredson and Hindelang's\n(1979) theory, however, non-discretional, case-specific factors would play a key role in\nexplaining why some homicides are solved while others remain unsolved. The results did\nnot provide overwhelming support for either of the two theoretical approaches, because,\nin all countries except Switzerland, differences in homicide clearance were found in both\ndiscretional (victim-based) and non-discretional (case-based) characteristics. Rather\nthan these theoretical perspectives providing explanations for the likelihood of a homi-\ncide being cleared, we believe that, for these four European countries, the answer lies in\nthe characteristics of the most prevalent types of homicide per country.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, homicides that take place in the private realm overall had the\nhighest clearance rates. Not only are victims killed in a private location most likely to be\nkilled by a family member or someone they know (Litwin, 2004), making the number of\nsuspects limited, such homicides are also frequently followed by the suicide of the per-\npetrator. Prior studies show homicide\u00adsuicide rates in Finland and Switzerland to be\nconsiderably higher than in other European countries, with rates in Finland ranging from\nNetherlands, respectively. The relatively high prevalence of homicide\u00adsuicide in Finland\nand Switzerland could partly explain the relatively high clearance rate in these countries\ncompared with the Netherlands and Sweden.\nFrom a different point of view, the low clearance rates in the Netherlands and Sweden\ncould be explained by the relatively high prevalence of criminal milieu related homicides\nin these countries and the low clearance rates associated with these types of crimes.\nFactors associated with such criminal homicides, such as male victims, victims with an\nethnic minority background and the use of firearms, were found to be significant predic-\ntors of homicide clearance in both countries. Among such homicides, even though victim\nand perpetrator may know each other, witnesses are not likely to share information\n(Litwin, 2004). Similarly, owing to the lack of physical contact between victim and per-\npetrator, firearms used in these homicides leave little physical evidence to work with\n(Alderden and Lavery, 2007) and hence, in line with findings reported in prior US studies\n(Roberts, 2007), result in lower clearance rates.\nIt should be noted that the relationship between homicide clearance and the use of\nfirearms was not present in either Finland or Switzerland. In neither of these countries\ndid the use of a firearm have an impact on the homicide clearance rate. In Finland, about\n40 percent of households own at least one firearm. They are mainly hunting rifles and\nshotguns;handgunownershipisrareasinotherWestEuropeancountries.ForSwitzerland,\nas B\u00e4nziger and Killias (2014) have pointed out, the lack of such a relationship may be\nattributed to some specificities of gun possession in Switzerland. Because of the militia\nsystem and a widespread tradition of hunting and collecting firearms, roughly one in four\nSwiss households owns at least one firearm. The situation is in many ways similar in\nFinland. In both countries these firearms are relatively often involved in cases of domes-\ntic homicide (Markwalder and Killias, 2012; Lehti, 2016), which by their very nature\nhave a high clearance rate.\nFirearm homicides in the Netherlands and Sweden, however, appear to be solved at a\nsignificantly lower rate (see Tables 2, 4b and 4c). This can be explained by the nature of\nfirearm ownership in these countries. Legal gun ownership is relatively high in Sweden,\nas roughly one in eight households possesses at least one gun (Granath, 2015). In the\nNetherlands, less than 5 percent of all households own a firearm (Van Kesteren, 2013).\nWhat these countries have in common is that firearm use in homicide is mainly concen-\ntrated in the use of illegal firearms in homicides in the criminal milieu or other urban\n`street' homicides (Granath, 2015), and seldom in domestic settings.\nFurther, based on the finding that homicides in the private realm were easier to solve,\none would also expect that homicides involving women, children and elderly victims\nwould be cleared at high rates, because these victims are typically killed in the private\nrealm rather than in public places. Although, for the most part, this held true in terms of\nhomicides with female victims, we did not find straightforward support for higher clear-\nance rates among very young or very old victims. One explanation could lie in the fact\nthat neonaticides \u00ad the killing of a new-born \u00ad are included among very young victims.\nBecause of the hidden nature of the pregnancy and the killing itself, such cases often\nremain unsolved (Brookman and Nolan, 2006). The greater difficulty of clearing cases\ninvolving elderly victims have previously been reported elsewhere (Addington, 2006;\nPuckett and Lundman, 2003), suggesting that victim age may not have a linear relation-\nship with homicide clearance (Regoeczi et al., 2008). Elderly victims, particularly elderly\nvictims living alone, may be killed in robbery homicides without witnesses, which are\ngenerally known for a lower clearance rate (B\u00e4nziger and Killias, 2014; Regoeczi et al.,\nAnother explanation may lie in the nature of victimization and lifestyle. In a prior\nstudy on unsolved homicides in Switzerland, B\u00e4nziger and Killias (2014) found a strong\nnexus between homosexuality and clearance rate. Accounts of similar cleared cases\nrevealed that (older) homosexual men often take other men to their homes with the pur-\npose of having paid sex. The authors stated it was not possible to examine whether the\nvictims died in the circumstances including paid sex. However, homicides occurring in\ncontexts where men without known ties operate are extremely difficult to solve.\nMethodological considerations\nThis is the first study to provide an overview of homicide clearance in four West European\ncountries. Using similar definitions and a uniform coding scheme, this study allowed for\nunique cross-country comparisons in factors influencing differences in homicide clear-\nance. In spite of our consistent, standardized methodological approach, this study is not\nwithout flaws. First, this study did not include cases of missing persons where no body\nwas found. In all four countries, such cases are usually labelled as a disappeared person,\neven if the police strongly suspect a homicide. Following other studies (Sturup et al.,\n2015), because of the unknown nature of these cases (including potential suicides or\nvoluntary disappearances), these cases have not been included in the study. This may\nhave resulted in a general under-count of the total number of homicides, including an\nunder-count of unsolved homicides.\nFurther, whereas some countries have homicide monitoring systems available with a\ngreat level of detail, which allows for the assessment of factors such as alcohol intoxication\nin victims and perpetrators (Lehti and Kivivuori, 2005; Sturup et al., 2015), criminal record\nof victims and perpetrators (Sturup et al., 2015), or sexual orientation of victims (B\u00e4nziger\nand Killias, 2014), this level of detail was not available in all participating countries. This\nlevel of detail would allow us to assess a third theoretical perspective, in addition to the\nvictim devaluation (discretional) and event characteristics (non-discretional) points of view,\nnamely the lifestyle perspective (Rydberg and Pizarro, 2014). Lifestyle theory posits that\nparticular lifestyle choices, such as going out at night and spending time away from the\nhome, may contribute to future (homicide) victimization by facilitating convergence in time\nand space with potential offenders and other risky situations (Rydberg and Pizarro, 2014).\nHomicides taking place between individuals equally enmeshed in a deviant lifestyle may\nsignificantly complicate the clearance of such cases. In our work on the EHM, we continue\nto optimize the degree and level of detail of information to test these and other hypotheses.\nAlso, even though we are able to apply the same EHM coding scheme to our national\ndatasets, allowing for exceptionally high internal validity, owing to national data protec-\ntion acts we were not able to merge raw, potentially identifiable data from our national\ndatasets into one dataset for this study. We hope that future endeavours to meet these\nlegal ramifications will allow us to combine our data and to conduct multivariate analy-\nses across countries.\nFinally, prior research suggests that much is to be learned from shifting the conceptu-\nalization of clearance from the traditional dichotomy of cleared/uncleared to an examina-\ntion of the length of time to clearance (Regoeczi et al., 2008). Based on the findings\npresented in this paper, this may be particularly relevant for Switzerland. An alternative\nmodelling decision (that is, one based on time-to-solve) might have been more produc-\ntive because of the very small number of uncleared homicides during the examined time\nperiod. In terms of future research, the inclusion of time-to-solve and other data such as\nthe density, structure, expertise and operations of police departments may help improve\nour understanding of homicide clearance.\nFunding\nNote\n1.
