Male-female dif-\nferences in circulating homocysteine concentration have\nbeen reported (3\u00ad7), but lower concentrations in females\nmay be characteristic of the premenopausal years only\n(3\u00ad5). Young women have lower rates of occlusive vascular\ndisease than do young men, but the male-female gap nar-\nrows later in life (5). A possible cause is the decline in estro-\ngen production that accompanies menopause, with a con-\ncomitant rise in homocysteine. Findings supportive of this\nhypothesis include reports of markedly reduced plasma\nhomocysteine concentrations in pregnant versus nonpreg-\nnant women (8), lower homocysteine concentrations in\nusers of oral contraceptives versus nonusers (9), an increase\nin circulating homocysteine concentration after age 50 years\nthat is steeper in females than in males (4, 10), and reduc-\ntion of both homocysteine concentration and vascular dis-\nease risk in estrogen-treated postmenopausal women (11).\nData from the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III) provide a unique opportu-\nnity to explore the variation of homocysteine concentration\nwith estrogen status in a large representative sample of the gen-\neral US population, across a broad spectrum of ages. Our ear-\nlier analyses of NHANES III data confirmed in the US popu-\nlation male-female differences in homocysteine concentration\nfrom adolescence on, as well as an abrupt increase in homo-\ncysteine concentration in women after age 50 years that may\nindicate an effect of menopause (4). These findings suggest the\nhypothesis that estrogen status modulates homocysteine con-\ncentration, but the sex difference could also be attributable to\nmale-female differences in muscle mass (7) or nutritional sta-\ntus (12). In this report, we address the estrogen hypothesis\nspecifically by stratifying women according to available indi-\ncators of estrogen status and performing comparisons of\nhomocysteine concentration among women of higher inferred\nestrogen status, women of lower inferred estrogen status, and\nmen. These comparisons are performed after controlling for\nalternative explanations for between-group differences, such as\nserum vitamin levels, markers of muscle mass, and age.\nSample population\nThe National  s\nconducted by the National Center for Health Statistics,\nHomocysteine, Estrogen Status in NHANES III 141\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, obtained\nnationally representative data on the health and nutritional\nstatus of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population\nthrough interviews and direct physical examinations (13,\n14). Toward this goal, some population subgroups, includ-\ning young children, older persons, Blacks, and Mexican\nAmericans, were oversampled. All respondents gave their\ninformed consent, and the NHANES III protocol was\nreviewed and approved by the National Center for Health\nStatistics' National Health and Nurition Examination\nSurvey Institutional Review Board.\nHomocysteine concentrations were measured as an\nserum samples derived from participants aged 12 years. All\nsample members were invited to undergo a physical exami-\ntion to be examined, and homocysteine measurements were\nsurements for examined individuals resulted from the failure\nto obtain a blood sample or from a lack of surplus sera.\nHomocysteine measurement\nBlood was drawn and processed in mobile examination\ncenters under controlled, constant environmental conditions\naccording to a standard protocol (15). Participants had\nfasted for varying lengths of time, but analyses demon-\nstrated that length of fast had no measurable effect on homo-\ncysteine concentrations. Whole blood, which was not\ntreated with anticoagulant, was collected in serum separator\ntubes and was held at room temperature for 30\u00ad60 minutes\nbefore centrifugation. Sera were separated, frozen at \u00ad20\u00b0C,\nand transferred on dry ice to the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention's central laboratory for priority analyses.\nSamples went through 1\u00ad4 freeze-thaw cycles. After prior-\nity analyses were completed, additional analyses were car-\nried out subject to approval by the Surplus Sera Bank\nSteering Committee. The surplus sera were stored at \u00ad70\u00b0C\nfor 8 months to 3 years before being analyzed for total\nhomocysteine concentration. Plasma samples frozen for up\nto 10 years have been shown to be acceptable for character-\nizing a person's plasma total homocysteine concentration at\nthe time the samples were drawn (16). Serum total homo-\ncysteine concentration refers to the combined concentration\nin serum of trace amounts of the free amino acid homocys-\nteine, oxidized disulfides comprising a molecule of homo-\ncysteine bound to a molecule of another sulfur-containing\namino acid (about 30 percent), and protein-bound homocys-\nteine (about 70 percent) (2). The serum total homocysteine\nconcentration was measured by the high-performance liquid\nchromatography method of Araki and Sako (17) at the US\nDepartment of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research\nCenter on Aging after approval by the New England\nMedical Center Human Investigations Review Committee.\nSubject classification\nFor data analyses, subjects were first stratified by age and\nthen by inferred estrogen status within age group. Age\ngroups corresponded to the years near menarche (ages\nperimenopausal years (ages 45\u00ad54 years), middle age (ages\n55\u00ad69 years), and old age (70 years). The question of inter-\nest for each age range concerned whether the geometric\nmean serum total homocysteine concentration varied\naccording to estrogen status. Estrogen measurements were\nnot available, however, and estrogen status was inferred\nfrom sex, serum concentration of follicle-stimulating hor-\nmone, where available, and interview responses regarding\nvarious aspects of reproductive history (table 1).\nClassification of women <35 years of age relative to\nmenarche, premenopause, or postmenopause (excluded)\nwas based on self-report. Girls under 17 years old were\nasked how old they were when their menstrual periods\nstarted to occur, and a possible response was \"Haven't\nstarted yet.\" Those who gave an age were classified as\n\"postmenarche\"; those who said their periods had not\nstarted yet were classified as \"premenarche.\"\nWomen 17 years old were classified as pregnant under\nthe following two circumstances: 1) if they said they were\npregnant in response to a specific interview item and 2) if a\nurine pregnancy test (given to examined women aged 20\u00ad49\nyears) gave a positive result. Use of estrogen supplements\nand oral contraceptives was defined as self-report of current\nuse (dose information was not available). Women in the age\nrange 17\u00ad34 years who provided menstrual histories and did\nnot report either a double oophorectomy or the combination\nof at least 3 months of amenorrhea and a single oophorec-\ntomy were considered premenopausal. Ninety-five percent\nof those considered premenopausal reported that their last\nmenstrual period had occurred <2 months prior to the inter-\nered premenopausal and had reported that their last men-\nstrual period had occurred 2 months prior to the interview,\neight had had surgery to remove the uterus but not the\novaries, 28 had been pregnant during the year prior to the\ninterview or were breastfeeding at interview, 21 had had a\nmenstrual period within 3 months of the interview, and one\nhad apparently unexplained amenorrhea for a year prior to\nthe interview but had been pregnant within 2 years of the\ninterview. Only three of the remaining 16 had a body mass\nindex between 19 and 26 kg/m2 (for six subjects, the body\nmass index was >40; for two, it was <18), but seven of the\n16 had menstruated within 6 months of the interview, and\nanother two had menstruated within a year of the interview.\nSerum concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone\nwere used to classify women aged 35\u00ad54 years as either\n\"premenopausal\" (follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)  35\nIU/liter) or \"postmenopausal\" (FSH > 35 IU/liter). All\nwomen aged 55 years and older were considered post-\nmenopausal unless the follicle-stimulating hormone concen-\nwomen aged 55 years, neither the reproductive history nor\nthe follicle-stimulating hormone concentration was avail-\nable. However, the follicle-stimulating hormone concentra-\ntion was missing for only one woman aged 55\u00ad60 years.\nreported that they had menstruated in the past 2 years.\nStatistical analysis\nTo account for the complex NHANES III survey design\n(i.e., a staged sampling scheme and unequal probability of\nselection and nonresponse), data were analyzed using\nSUDAAN statistical software (18), and sample weights\nwere incorporated into analytical procedures. Because total\nhomocysteine concentrations were extremely skewed, the\nvalues were logarithmically transformed before being used\nin data analyses. The SAS system (19) was used to create\nand manipulate the data files. A p < 0.05 was considered sta-\ntistically significant for all analyses.\nPreliminary data analyses accomplished two goals: 1) the\ndescription of subjects stratified by age group and inferred\nestrogen status as to sociodemographic characteristics, body\ncomposition indicators, and status as to vitamin B-12, folate,\nand cigarette smoking; and 2) the evaluation of univariate\nrelations between these factors and the two main variables\nof interest--the serum total homocysteine concentration and\nestrogen status category. All of these variables were consid-\nered potential confounders of the relation between serum\ntotal homocysteine concentration and estrogen status based\non one or more of the following three criteria: 1) relation to\ntotal homocysteine concentration demonstrated in previous\nstudies (i.e., age, creatinine, vitamin B-12, folate, and ciga-\nrette smoking), 2) consistent consideration as a potential\ntotal homocysteine correlate in previous studies (i.e., body\nmass index), or 3) status as a major sociodemographic char-\nacteristic not previously well studied (i.e., race-ethnicity).\nDepending on the scale of the potentially confounding vari-\nable (i.e., continuous or categorical), linear regression\n(SUDAAN PROC REGRESS) or cross-tabulation\n(SUDAAN PROC CROSSTAB) procedures were used to\nperform the two preliminary data analytical functions.\nMeans were compared via F tests; contingency tables were\nanalyzed via chi-square tests.\nAlthough smoking data were collected from all subjects,\nin the age group <17 years, only seven subjects, none of\nwhom was in the premenarche category, were regular pack-\na-day smokers. Consequently, potential confounding by\nTABLE 1.

An additional\n157 subjects in various age ranges were excluded from data\nanalyses because of missing information on potential con-\nfounders.

More specifically, we\nexcluded pregnant girls aged <17 years (n  6), apparently\napparently premenopausal women aged 55 years (n  21).\nThe final proportion of the phase 2 sample members\nThe relation between the serum total homocysteine con-\ncentration and the estrogen status category was analyzed via\nmultiple linear regression analysis using SUDAAN PROC\nREGRESS. Point estimates and 95 percent confidence inter-\nvals of the geometric mean (inverse of the logarithmic\nmean) total homocysteine concentration were calculated for\nvarious estrogen status categories from the least-square\nmeans and standard errors generated by the regression pro-\ncedure. Three separate models were run to adjust for poten-\ntially confounding factors. The basic model included age (to\nadjust for any residual confounding by age within age strata)\nand race-ethnicity. The intermediate model included the\nbasic model variables plus cigarette smoking, body mass\nindex, and serum creatinine. The full model included the\nintermediate model variables plus serum concentrations of\nvitamin B-12 and folate. We explored possible effect modi-\nfication by race-ethnicity, cigarette smoking, and vitamin\nstatus by including appropriate interaction terms individu-\nally in the full model. Initially, means and 95 percent confi-\ndence intervals were reported without regard to possible\neffect modifiers. However, after the serum folate concentra-\ntion was identified as a modifier of the effect of sex on the\nserum total homocysteine concentration at ages consistent\nwith women's childbearing years, the folate distribution for\nthat age range was divided into fifths, and confounder-\nadjusted mean serum total homocysteine concentrations and\nassociated 95 percent confidence intervals were generated\nfor premenopausal women and men separately for each of\nthe five serum folate categories.\nRESULTS\nTable 2 presents and compares descriptive statistics for\nsubjects stratified by age group and estrogen status category.\nA finding common to all age ranges was statistically signif-\nicantly higher serum creatinine concentrations in men as\ncompared with all subgroups of women.

Specifically, the premenarcheal girls tended to be of\nyounger age, higher folate status, and lower body mass\nindex, and they had lower serum creatinine concentrations.\nand users of oral contraceptives (n  366) were younger\nthan subjects in other estrogen status categories. Men in this\nage range (n  1,764) were more likely to smoke than were\nwomen in all subgroups. Oral contraceptive users had a\nlower body mass index than subjects in other subgroups and,\ncompared with other nonpregnant women (n  1,751) and\nmen, they were of lower vitamin B-12 status and more likely\nto be non-Hispanic White. Pregnant women were of higher\nfolate status than subjects in the other subgroups.\nIn the age range 45\u00ad54 years, women who were post-\nmenopausal (n  168) or receiving estrogen replacement\ntherapy (n  87) were older than other women (n  219)\nand men (n  354). Women in this age range tended to\nsmoke less than the men, but only the premenopausal\nwomen smoked statistically significantly less. Finally, estro-\ngen users were of somewhat higher folate status than were\nmembers of other subgroups.\ndiffered from members of other subgroups; they were statis-\ntically significantly younger than non-estrogen-using post-\nmenopausal women (n  562), and they were of higher\nfolate status and more likely to be non-Hispanic White than\nboth the other women and the men (n  638).\nAmong NHANES III participants aged 70 years, non-\nestrogen-using postmenopausal women (n  670) were\nolder than the men (n  524), but estrogen-using women\n(n  48) were not. Elderly estrogen users were of somewhat\nhigher folate status than the other women and the men, but\nin this age range, it was the non-estrogen-using women who\nhad the highest serum vitamin B-12 concentrations.\nEstrogen users in this age range were statistically signifi-\ncantly less likely to smoke than were members of the other\nsubgroups and, similar to the middle-aged estrogen users,\nthey were more likely than members of the other subgroups\nto be non-Hispanic White.\nTo summarize, each one of the potentially confounding\nfactors was statistically significantly related to inferred\nestrogen status in at least one age stratum, and all but body\nmass index were statistically significantly related to serum\ntotal homocysteine concentration in at least one age stratum.\nThe basic multivariate model (table 3) revealed no statis-\ntically significant difference in the serum total homocys-\nteine concentration between girls who had and had not\npassed menarche, but the menstruating girls alone had lower\ntotal homocysteine concentrations than the boys. In the age\nrange 17\u00ad44 years, the total homocysteine concentrations of\nwomen, whether or not they were oral contraceptive users,\nwere significantly lower than those of men, and the total\nhomocysteine concentrations of pregnant women were sig-\nnificantly lower than those of not only the men but also the\nnonpregnant women.\nThe total homocysteine concentrations of women aged\n45\u00ad54 years in all estrogen status categories were lower than\nthose of the men. Significant differences were also found\nbetween women who were either premenopausal or receiv-\ning estrogen replacement therapy and those who were post-\nmenopausal but not receiving estrogen therapy. Results were\nsimilar for older men and women.\nChanges from the basic to the intermediate model\nresulted mainly from the inclusion of a term for serum cre-\natinine in the model, which tended to bring the means for\nmen and women closer together. Nevertheless, the total\nhomocysteine concentrations of premenopausal women,\npregnant women, and women receiving estrogen replace-\nment therapy continued to be significantly lower than those\nof the men.\nAddition of terms for serum concentrations of folate and\nvitamin B-12 to the multivariate model resulted in some-\nwhat higher mean total homocysteine estimates for preme-\nnarcheal girls, pregnant women, estrogen users, and all cat-\negories of elderly subjects. However, the between-group\ndifferences noted with simpler models tended to be main-\ntained. To summarize, the serum total homocysteine con-\ncentrations of menstruating women in all age ranges were\nlower than those of comparably aged men. Furthermore, in\nthose age ranges that included postmenopausal women, the\nmeans of postmenopausal women not receiving estrogen\nreplacement therapy were comparable with those of men\nand higher than those of women taking estrogen supple-\nmentation. Finally, among women in their childbearing\nyears, pregnant women had serum total homocysteine con-\ncentrations that were much lower than those of subjects in\nall other estrogen status categories, but the serum total\nhomocysteine concentrations of oral contraceptive users\nwere indistinguishable from those of other nonpregnant\nwomen of reproductive age.\nThe between-group differences we found were not modi-\nfied by race-ethnicity, cigarette-smoking status, or vitamin\nB-12 status. Serum folate status did affect the total homo-\ncysteine advantage of premenopausal women over men,\nhowever. More specifically, when men of low folate status\naged 17\u00ad44 years were compared with premenopausal\nwomen who were also of low folate status, the serum total\nhomocysteine concentrations of the men and women were\nvery similar (figure 1). When men and premenopausal\nwomen of higher folate status were compared, however,\ntheir serum total homocysteine concentrations differed.\nDISCUSSION\nThe results of this study show that a sex difference in\nmuscle mass, as reflected by the serum creatinine concen-\ntration, partially explains the higher serum total homocys-\nteine concentrations of men as compared with women.\nFurthermore, the high nutritional status of hormone users\ncontributes to the comparatively low serum total homocys-\nteine concentrations of postmenopausal women receiving\nHomocysteine, Estrogen Status in NHANES III 145\nestrogen replacement therapy. Nevertheless, when these\nconfounding factors were controlled for, three differences\nsuggestive of an effect of estrogen status on the serum total\nhomocysteine concentration were observed: 1) the serum\ntotal homocysteine concentrations of premenopausal\nwomen of all ages were statistically significantly lower than\nthose of comparably aged men; 2) pregnant women had\nextremely low serum total homocysteine concentrations;\nand 3) elderly estrogen users showed a total homocysteine\nadvantage over elderly postmenopausal women who were\nnot receiving estrogen replacement therapy.\nUnlike estrogen supplementation, oral contraceptive use\nappeared to have no effect on the serum total homocysteine\nconcentration, a finding that has been obtained by others\ncontemporary oral contraceptives usually contain low doses\nof synthetic estrogens, whose effects may be different from\nthose of natural estrogens. Another factor to keep in mind is\nthat oral contraceptives are used by women of childbearing\nage, whose estrogen status is already high. Whether oral\ncontraceptive use would offer an advantage to elderly\nwomen is unknown.\nThat pregnant women have very low circulating homo-\ncysteine concentrations has long been known (8). Walker et\nal. (23) recently found that folate supplementation in preg-\nnancy contributed to the low levels, but we showed that the\nhigh folate status of pregnant women did not entirely\nexplain the difference between pregnant and nonpregnant\nwomen. Although pregnant women have higher estrogen\nlevels than men and nonpregnant women, their condition is\nunique in many other ways that might account for their low\nserum total homocysteine concentrations. Walker et al. (23)\nsuggested that homocysteine levels may decrease in preg-\nnancy because of utilization by the fetus, a hypothesis raised\nby the observation of a decreasing plasma total homocys-\nteine gradient from the maternal vein to the umbilical vein\nto the umbilical artery. On the basis of animal studies, Kim\net al. (24) hypothesized that cortisol, which rises during\npregnancy, might also contribute.\nOur findings regarding a possible effect of menopause on\ntotal homocysteine concentrations were consistent with those\nof Wouters et al. (25), who found higher plasma homocys-\nteine concentrations in postmenopausal versus pre-\nmenopausal women in a comparison that could not exclude\nage as a possible explanation for the difference. That study\nalso demonstrated a negative association between serum\nconcentrations of 17-estradiol and postmethionine plasma\nhomocysteine among the 46 premenopausal subjects. A\nSwedish population-based study of men and women aged\n35\u00ad95 years (7) revealed stable plasma total homocysteine\nTABLE 3.

Men's total homocysteine concentrations, on\nthe other hand, increased with each successively higher age\nrange. These results were similar to those reported from our\ngroup's earlier analyses of NHANES III data (4). Brattstrom\net al. (7) concluded that homocysteine values did not\nincrease with age in women in a manner that suggested an\neffect of menopause. However, our results and those of\nBrattstrom et al. could be interpreted as indicating that\nwomen's total homocysteine concentrations, unlike men's,\nare kept from rising until an age range when all of the women\nwould have passed menopause. Both the data from\nBrattstrom et al. (7) and our results from the current investi-\ngation showed that, after the age of menopause, any differ-\nence in total homocysteine concentration between men and\nat least non-estrogen-using women was accounted for by the\nhigher serum creatinine concentrations of men. An analysis\nof the Framingham study data attributed a male-female dif-\nference in total homocysteine concentration observed among\nelderly cohort members to a sex difference in B-vitamin sta-\ntus (12), but neither the serum creatinine concentration nor\npostmenopausal estrogen use was considered in that study.\nBoth a descriptive study recently completed by our group\n(26) and a study of Belgian school-age children (21) sought\nto provide reference ranges for circulating total homocys-\nteine concentration in children and adolescents. To our\nknowledge, ours was the first attempt to specifically link\nmenarche to the onset of male-female differences, however.\nAuthors of the Belgian study reported a sex difference in\nplasma total homocysteine concentration among subjects\naged 15\u00ad19 years but not in younger age ranges. The\nNHANES III data revealed statistically significant male-\nfemale differences in all age ranges, but the two studies\nwere not completely comparable. The next younger age\nrange of Belgian children to the age range 15\u00ad19 years\nincluded boys and girls as young as 10 years, 2 years\nyounger than the youngest NHANES III participants whose\ntotal homocysteine concentrations were measured. While\nthe age range 10\u00ad14 years certainly included girls who had\nnot passed menarche, we identified only 68 female\nNHANES III participants who had not begun to menstruate,\nand some of those were undoubtedly on the verge of menar-\nche. Taken together, results of the Belgian study and our\nfinding of a clear male-female difference only between boys\nand menstruating girls aged <17 years remain suggestive of\nan effect of menarche, but further study is needed.\nWe found that the total homocysteine advantage to pre-\nmenopausal women versus similarly aged men was\nrestricted to a subgroup with higher folate status. On the\nother hand, the total homocysteine benefit enjoyed by\nelderly estrogen users over other postmenopausal women\ndid not seem to be affected by folate status. Data graphed in\nfigure 1 showed that the benefit of being a premenopausal\nwoman was realized at serum folate concentrations other\nthan those consistent with folate deficiency (serum folate\nconcentration < 6.8 nmol/liter) or very low folate status. The\n20th percentile of the folate distribution of women aged 70\nyears (the age range for which estrogen users had lower\nserum total homocysteine concentrations than non-estrogen\nusers) was 10.2 nmol/liter, and only five estrogen users had\nconcentrations that low. Our data thus did not permit an\nanalysis of the effect of folate deficiency or very low folate\nstatus on the relation between estrogen supplementation and\nthe serum total homocysteine concentration.\nSeveral mechanisms have been hypothesized for estro-\ngenic effects on homocysteine metabolism. Boers et al. (5)\nhave suggested that methionine may be catabolized more in\npremenopausal women than men by a methionine transami-\nnation pathway that does not result in homocysteine accu-\nmulation. In support of their hypothesis, this team of inves-\ntigators reported higher concentrations of transamination\nmetabolites in premenopausal women versus young men\n(6). How estrogen per se might stimulate the transamination\npathway (as opposed to the well-known transsulfuration\npathway) has yet to be suggested nor has transamination\nactivity been demonstrated to differ between pre- and post-\nmenopausal women or between estrogen-supplemented and\nnonsupplemented postmenopausal women. Animal studies\nhave supported the notion that estrogen might prevent\nhyperhomocysteinemia through increased methionine syn-\nthase activity in the kidney (24), and Boers et al. (5) have\npointed out that the noted variation in homocysteine con-\ncentration with estrogen status could also be explained by\nvariation in transsulfuration or renal excretion rates.\nThis study had many strengths. Among them were the\nvery large sample size, the broad age range of the subjects,\nthe representation by the sample of the US population, the\nseveral estrogen status categories that could be distin-\nguished, the data on follicle-stimulating hormone (used as\nHomocysteine, Estrogen Status in NHANES III 147\nan indicator of menopause in the perimenopausal age\nrange), and our ability to control for several potentially con-\nfounding factors.\nThe chance for information bias to have affected the\nresults was minimal given our infrequent reliance on other\nthan blood data for assessment of status as to the dependent\nvariable, independent variables, and possible confounders of\nthe relation between the two. We used menstrual histories\nprovided by female subjects for assessment of menopausal\nstatus, but only in an age range when being postmenopausal\nwould be unlikely. We included as \"premenopausal\" some\nyoung women with unexplained amenorrhea who may have\nbeen of low estrogen status; however, excluding these\nwomen from analyses had no effect on results. Hormone use\nwas entirely self-reported, but reports were likely to be\naccurate, especially since current use was of interest.\nAmong potential confounders, only smoking status, age,\nand race-ethnicity were reported by the subjects.\nDespite the study's strengths, we cannot definitively\nattribute the observed differences to estrogen without actual\nestrogen measurements. On the other hand, no known\nhomocysteine correlate was left uncontrolled. Three vari-\nables we considered in addition to those controlled for in the\nfull multivariate model were region of the country, urban-\nrural character, and season when the examinations and inter-\nviews took place. Adding terms for these factors to the full\nmultivariate model had no effect on the results.\nThe response rate for homocysteine measurements was 64\npercent, and a small number of additional subjects were lost\nbecause of missing information on estrogen status indicators\nor potentially confounding factors. Comparisons between\nsubjects included in the data analyses and interviewed sub-\njects excluded for missing information revealed few differ-\nences; however, included subjects were younger and less\nlikely to have had a heart attack than subjects who were\nmerely interviewed. Both heart attacks and age are related to\ntotal homocysteine concentration (1, 2, 4), and physicians'\nprescription of estrogen could be related to heart attack his-\ntory. It is thus reassuring that results did not change when\nanalyses were restricted to those who had not had heart\nattacks or strokes. Also relevant to the difference we found\nbetween estrogen users and nonusers is the consistency of that\nfinding with results of small clinic investigations (22, 27), one\nlarge uncontrolled study (28), and a controlled trial (29). After\nreviewing these studies, van der Mooren et al. (11) recently\nconcluded that homocysteine concentrations can be reduced\nby postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy. Oral estro-\ngen was also found to be effective in reducing the circulating\nhomocysteine concentrations of 22 elderly men (30).\nThis study was the first to look at indicators of estrogen\nstatus through the majority of the life cycle in a large popu-\nlation-based study, and results were generally consistent\nwith the hypothesis that estrogen status is inversely related\nto the circulating total homocysteine concentration. Future\ninvestigators of this relation should attempt to link actual\nestrogen measurements to total homocysteine measurements\nand to specific metabolic pathways that might result in\ndecreased homocysteine production or increased homocys-\nteine clearance from the circulation.\n"
