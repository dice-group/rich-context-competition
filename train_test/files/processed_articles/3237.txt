While some\naspects of this topic are not related to economics, it is important to assess the potential\nmacroeconomic consequences and, thus, the potential costs and benefits for domestic\nagents. The present paper contributes to this topic by simulating various scenarios and\ntheir economic effects.1 Specifically, it uses a New Keynesian three-region DSGE model\n(the three regions being Germany, the euro area and the rest of the world) to explore\nwhich macroeconomic effects could be triggered by refugee migration to Germany. The\nmodel simulations assume population growth of 1% of the native population. Refugees\nare initially solely transfer recipients for the period of one year, but are then gradually\nabsorbed by the labour market over time.\nThe simulations show that the demand stimulus triggered by the migration of transfer\nrecipients is the predominant economic impact initially, but that as time progresses, the\nchange in supply-side conditions in the labour market comes to the fore. The population\ngrowth briefly increases aggregate output by less than 0.1% (demand stimulus). Over\nthe longer term, the impact depends on the qualification structure which the migrants\nachieve in the long run. Per capita output and consumption increase/decline when migra-\ntion improves/worsens the workforce qualification structure over the long term because\nthe strength of the aggregate increase in output and consumption is then more than/less\nthan proportional. If, over the long run, the refugees achieve the same qualification struc-\nture as natives, there are no long-term changes in output and consumption. Assuming\nthey improve the qualification structure in the long term, per capita output and con-\nsumption might even climb by 0.34% and 0.38%, respectively, whereas per capita output\nand consumption are projected to decline by 0.43% and 0.48%, respectively, if all the\nrefugees migrating to Germany (are in a position to) only perform low-skilled tasks over\nthe long-term horizon as well.\nDespite the overall increase in the labour supply, the aggregate unemployment rate\nwill remain static over the long term if the migrant qualification structure is brought into\nline with that of natives. Even in the worst-case scenario \u00ad in which all the migrants\nremain no better than low-skilled over the long run \u00ad there is just a 0.14 percentage point\nincrease in the aggregate unemployment rate because labour demand is raised by supply-\ndriven cuts in real wages as well as shifts in demand towards employees with different\nqualifications. In this worst-case scenario, the average costs do not rise above 0.5% in\nterms of individual gross wage and income losses. Generally speaking, though, the more\ndirectly native employees compete with migrants, the more likely it is that they will face\nwage losses (including over the long term), while other groups look set to benefit. The\nfiscal impact of refugee migration is small.\nAll in all, it can be concluded that (integration) measures that cause the migrant\nqualification structure to closely match that of the native population over the long term\ndo not lead to any noteworthy GDP and consumption losses while a partial or total failure\n1The author takes the view that humanitarian considerations should, as a rule, trump economic\nfactors, at least in a strong economy like Germany, and that is especially the case for refugee migration,\na development which is mostly set in motion by catastrophic events. That notwithstanding, this paper\nwill focus exclusively on economic effects.\nto close the skills gap can very well have negative economic consequences. Of course, our\nmodel simulation has some caveats. First, when assuming a different labour market\nstructure (such as, for example, a labour market with search frictions), the labour market\ntransmission may be different. Second, changes in the skill composition of immigrants\nare assumed to happen exogenously as we do not model incentives for attaining higher\neducation. And, third, in our model simulations, we analyse the effects of an exogenously\ngiven immigration flows ignoring the incentives of successful integration measures for those\nwho could potentially decide to migrate to Germany. While these issues are important to\nbe addressed in future research, our results seem to be backed by analyses which, at least\npartly, address the caveats mentioned above. Adda et al (2016) use a life cycle model\nto demonstrate that policy decisions that obstruct the integration of refugees can lead to\nsignificant welfare losses not only for the refugees themselves but also for natives, while\nsuccessful integration can even yield welfare gains (see also Dustmann et al, 2016). This\nis also confirmed by Busch et al (2016).\nThe present paper adds to the debate by explicitly taking into account short, medium\nand long-term demand and population effects and demonstrates what should be inter-\npreted in the debate as \"stimulus\" and as a structural effect of refugee migration, besides\nshowing how short and long-term factors interact with one another. What this paper does\nnot do, however, is provide concrete guidance on how good integration can be a success.\nThat is a topic that should certainly be addressed by future research. For an overview of\nhow this could be achieved, see EP (2016) and the literature discussed therein.\nOther institutions, too, have sought to gauge the economic effects of the refugee migra-\ntion. Many papers exploring this topic focus on the (fiscal) demand stimulus triggered by\nthe migration of refugees, and illustrate that refugees are largely reliant on government\ntransfers and thus trigger a corresponding government-funded demand stimulus. That\nstimulus is often amplified by direct increases in government consumption, since transfers\nare not the only items that are increased \u00ad non-financial benefits or public assistance are,\ntoo. Most papers put the resulting impulse from refugee migration for GDP growth at\nan annual rate of between 0.1 percentage point and 0.2 percentage point for the next\n2015). The study that most closely resembles this paper in terms of the demand stimulus\ntriggered by an increase in government expenditure was prepared by the German Council\nof Economic Experts (SVR, 2015). Like this paper, they, too, use a DSGE model to\nanalyse the fiscal stimulus. The transmission mechanisms and dimensions in the present\nmodel, which a corresponding stimulus would trigger, are comparable.\nOne factor which has so far received less attention in the current simulations is that,\nbesides providing somewhat short-lived stimulus for demand, refugee migration also un-\nleashes long-term effects. That is because at least some of the migrants will probably\nstay in their host country, and the medium to long-term effects of migration, especially,\ncannot necessarily be equated with the impulse that higher fiscal expenditure can provide\n\u00ad particularly since the medium to long-term effects exert a much stronger impact on the\nlabour market which simply do not exist in the case of fiscal-only stimulus. The European\nCommission uses its DSGE model QUEST to analyse a temporary population increase\nnative population) triggers, all other things being equal, similar short to medium-term\neffects to those modelled in the present simulation of the paper with regard to population\ngrowth \u00ad that is, an increase in aggregate output and a simultaneous decline in per capita\noutput. In the labour market, a rise in employment as well as a reduction in wages can be\nidentified. The Commission does not, however, differentiate between the effects on differ-\nent groups of the population, which might not be the same. The International Monetary\nFund likewise analyses the effects of refugee migration using the EUROMOD microsim-\nulation model by simulating two shocks, one to the size of the population, the other to\ngovernment expenditure (Aiyar et al, 2016). The study finds that a small stimulus is\ngenerated at first (slightly smaller than in the DSGE analyses), but that the medium\nto long-term effects are extremely sensitive to the assumptions made regarding labour\nmarket integration.\nLessons learnt in this regard from earlier periods of migration are also discussed. Beyer\n(2016) discusses past experience of labour market integration in Germany, while Battisti\net al (2015) analyse specific policy proposals in the field of integration. They find that\nthe minimum wage in particular as well as an increase in the standard Hartz IV rates\nare not conducive to promoting integration. Ruist (2015) discusses the lessons learnt in\nSweden, and Braun and Weber (2016) outline the situation in post-war Germany. The fact\nthat refugee migration can influence the surge of rather more conservative to right-wing\npolitical parties, and the manner in which this occurs, are demonstrated by Dustmann et\nal (2016), who use Denmark as a case study. Ottaviano and Peri (2012) identify slightly\npositive effects on the wages of the native US population in the period from 1990 to 2006\nbecause, first, migrants and natives constitute imperfect substitutes and, second, migrants\ntrigger a demand stimulus. Mandelman and Zlate (2012) detect similar effects in their\nanalysis of migration flows across the US/Mexican border. Earlier work on immigration\nin a DSGE context can be found in, among others, Acosta et al (2009), Barwell (2007),\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview\nof the simulation model used and describes how the simulation is designed. Section 3\npresents the possible long-term effects triggered by the different scenario assumptions,\nwhile section 4 looks at the short to medium-term effects. Section 5 summarises and\nconcludes this paper.\n2 The influx of refugees to Germany: model imple-\nmentation\nThis section begins by outlining the simulation model used before moving on to discuss\nthe specific assumptions and model implementation.\n2.1 Simulation model\nWe use the GEAR model for the following simulations, which is a standard New Keynesian\nDSGE model of a monetary union that consists of two regions and is embedded in the rest\nof the world. The baseline model is estimated for Germany, the rest of the euro area and\nthe rest of the world with the aid of Bayesian techniques. Compared with other models\nin this class, the GEAR model comprises a complex labour market structure that is also\ncapable of modelling involuntary unemployment, a disaggregated fiscal sector as well as\na robust representation of trade flows. More precisely, in the model, households make\noptimal choices regarding savings in physical capital as well as national and international\nassets and purchases of consumption and investment goods.2 The latter add to the private-\nsector capital stock which is rented out to private firms. Household members also decide\nwhether or not to participate in the labour market. Those who participate may find a\njob in the private or in the public sector or stay unemployed. Unemployment is modelled\nin line with Gal\u00b4\ni et al. (2011). Hence, households receive interest and\nwage payments, unemployment benefits and other fiscal transfers, and they pay taxes.\nIn line with Gal\u00b4\ni et al. (2007), it is also assumed that a fraction of households does\nnot participate in asset markets and consumes the entire income each period. Those\nhouseholds have become known in the literature as \"rule-of-thumb\" (RoT) households;\nwe call the other type of households optimisers.\nFurthermore, households enjoy some monopoly power on the labour market because\ndifferent types of labor are needed in production, and these are not perfectly substitutable.\nWage setting is associated with Rotemberg adjustment costs in the sense that changing\nnominal wages is costly for firms and for workers. This prevents wages from \"perfectly\"\nadjusting to the current economic situation which, in the end, induces potentially ineffi-\ncient wage and employment fluctuations (see Ascari et al., 2011, and Ascari and Rossi,\nOn the production side, monopolistic competitors in each region produce a variety\nof differentiated products and sell these to the home and foreign market. We assume\nthat there is no price discrimination between markets. Firms use labour and private\ncapital as production inputs. Public employment and the public capital stock can be\nproductivity-enhancing. However, the provision of these inputs is outside the control of\nfirms and conducted by the fiscal authority. Cost minimisation determines the amount of\nlabor and capital input demanded by each firm. Because firms enjoy monopolistic power,\nthey are able to set their nominal price. Price setting is also associated with Rotemberg\nadjustment costs.\nThe fiscal authority purchases consumption and investment goods produced in the\nprivate sector. The latter increases the public capital stock which may, in turn, improve\nprivate-sector productivity (for example, because of better infrastructure). The govern-\nment also employs public-sector workers for whom it has to pay wages. Services provided\nby these public-sector workers may also affect private-sector productivity positively (for\nexample, because of better governance). Introducing immediate positive spillovers from\nthe public to the private sector follows the idea of Baxter and King (1993), Pappa (2009),\nemployment benefits and other transfers to private households. It also has to pay interest\non outstanding debt. Fiscal authorities finance themselves with distortionary taxes on\nprivate consumption, on labor income and on capital returns, lump-sum taxes as well as\nsocial security contributions paid by firms. They can also issue new debt. The monetary\nauthority sets the nominal reference interest rates. In the euro area, it sets a common\n2As we will see below, we assume that, when refugees enter Germany, they are wholly reliant on\ngovernment transfers and non-financial benefits and do not have asset holdings for the period of one year.\nOnce they enter the group of asset holding households, we assume that they enter the big household\nfamily and thus share the household's wealth in equal amounts. However, the first immigrant entering\nthis household type needs about 8 years to do so. Before this, no immigrant will be an asset holder.\nrate according to a Taylor-type rule that responds to area-wide inflation and output gap.\nThe rest of the world is reduced to a three-equation VAR process (output, inflation and\ninterest rate) as in Christiano et al. (2011).\nIn order to make this paper self-contained, we provide a detailed model description in\nthe appendix. Besides the model modifications explained in the main text, this is basically\na repetition of the model description already provided by Gadatsch et al (2016).\nSince the qualification/productivity (hereinafter used synonymously) of the working\npopulation has a major bearing on the question discussed here, we extend the basic\nmodel so as to incorporate a suitably heterogeneous productivity structure in Germany\n\u00ad both in the original equilibrium but notably following the influx of refugees. It is\nassumed that the German native population can be broken down into three groups: high-\nproductivity, medium-productivity and low-productivity employees. They account for\n30%, 60% and 10% of the population, respectively, and their relative productivity is\ndetermined on the basis of the gross (hourly) wage differences in steady state. The\ngross hourly wage received by high-productivity households is assumed to be twice as\nlarge as that of medium-productivity households and three times larger than that of\nlow-productivity households (see Destatis, 2016a). Unemployment within the groups, in\nthe original long-term equilibrium, stands at 3%, 6% and 24%, respectively (see IAB,\n2016a). A fourth group is added to the basic model consisting of households that do not\nparticipate in the labour market and subsist entirely on transfer payments. It is assumed,\nin the initial steady state, that the population share of this latter group is zero, ie that\nthis group does not exist. The share can rise temporarily or even permanently following\nthe influx of refugees and simply increases aggregate consumption demand.\nEmployees from the groups participating in the labour market constitute imperfect\nsubstitutes in the production function of firms (formally captured by a CES aggrega-\ntor), with the result that firms will generally continue to have a demand for labour from\nthose groups as long as the marginal utility of the corresponding labour input equals or\nexceeds the marginal production costs (ultimately real wages plus social security contri-\nbutions). Imperfect substitutability between natives and immigrants may even be higher\nthan postulated here given that immigrant workers face, among other things, language\nbarriers (see, for example, Card, 2007, and D'Amuri et al, 2010). If we were to introduce\nthis within-skill-group heterogeneity of natives and immigrants, the transition results pre-\nsented below would be more in favour of the native population because, at least at the\nbeginning, they would not directly compete with the immigrants. Still, the long-run re-\nsults would remain the same as long as we assume that immigrant workers fully assimilate\nin the long run. Compared to the baseline model of Gadatsch et al (2016), the aggregate\nproduction function of the representative firm in Germany is extended to:\nya\nt\n= Aa\nyG,a\nt\nKa\na ~\nNP,a\nt\n- a\nwhere ~\nNP,a\nt\ndenotes a CES aggregate of different types of labour similar to Perri (2006) and\nt\ncaptures the effect of public employment and capital on\nprivate-sector productivity, Aa\nis total factor productivity and a\nis a fixed cost yielding\nsteady-state profits to be zero.3 The parameter 0 < a\n< 1 gives the share of private\ncapital, Ka\nt\n, in production. In order to simplify matters, we assume that there are only\nthree types of employees: highly, medium- and low-skilled workers such that the CES\naggregate is given by\n~\nNP,a\nt\n= a h\nN\n\u00b5a,h\nt\nnP,h,a\nt\n)\n+ m\nN\n\u00b5a,m\nt\nnP,m,a\nt\n)\n+ l\nN\n\u00b5a,l\nt\nnP,l,a\nt\n)\n,\nwhere \u00b5a,x\nt\n= Pa,x\nt\n/Pa\nt\nis the share of German highly, medium and low-productive workers,\nPa,x\nt\n, with x = h, m, l, over total German population, Pa\nt\n. nP,x,a\nt\nis the corresponding per-\nhousehold employment level and N\n, with vN\nbeing the substitution elasticity\nbetween these worker types. a is a scaling parameter determining aggregate labour\nproductivity, while i\nN\ndetermines (relative) productivity between worker types.\nWith ra\nk,t\nbeing the consumer price index (CPI)-deflated rental rate of capital and\nt\n) wa,x\nt\nbeing real gross labour costs when employing a worker of type x = l, m, h,\nincluding CPI-deflated private-sector real wages, wa,x\nt\n, and the firms' social security con-\ntributions at rate sc,a\nt\n, each firm's cost minimization problem yields\nt\n) wa,x\nt\n= mca\nt\nAa\n)\nKa\n~\nNP,a\nt\na\nyG,a\nt\na x\nN\n~\nNP,a\nt\n(z)\nx\nN\n\u00b5a,x\nt\nnP,x,a\nt\nN\nand\nra\nk,t\n= mca\nt\nAa\na\nKa\n~\nNP,a\nt\nyG,a\nt\nwhere mca\nt\nare real marginal costs. Note that, in these equations, we already made use\nof the fact that marginal costs and, hence, the capital-to-labour ratio are common to all\nfirms in equilibrium.\nThe household sector is analogous to the one presented in Gadatsch et al (2016)\nand, therefore, its presentation is relegated to the appendix. However, given that we\nnow have three different household types participating in the labour market in Germany,\nwhereas Gadatsch et al (2016) assume only two, we need to extend the household sector\nby an additional group. As in Gadatsch et al (2016), we assume that only highly-skilled\nhouseholds behave Ricardian (ie they save and borrow), while all other household types\nare assumed to be RoT households. Given an analogous household sector, labour supply\ndecisions are also analogous. However, we no longer assume that there is a union that sets\none economy-wide average wage but allow for type-specific wages as indicated in equation\n(3). This implies that, while the general modelling of the wage setting is analogous, it\nis now undertaken at the household level (see appendix for details). Total population in\nGermany is defined as\nPa\nt\n= Pa,h\nt\n+ Pa,m\nt\n+ Pa,l\nt\n3Note that yG,a\nt\n= a\nKG,a\nt\nKG,a\nNG,a\nt\nNG,a\ndenotes the impact of public-sector employees and\nthe public capital stock on private production, where KG,a determines the relevance of public capital in\nthe private-sector productivity function and NG,a the relevance of public employment, while a\nscaling parameter; see also Gadatsch et al (2016) for a more in-depth discussion.\nwhere Pa,x\nt\n= \u00af\nPa,x +pop,x\nt\n, the bar indicating steady-state (ie long-run equilibrium) levels,\nand pop,x\nt\nis a population shock specified in the following section.\n2.2 Simulation design\nWhen simulating refugee migration, a distinction must be made between short, medium\nand long-term migration. Specifically, this means that assumptions first need be made\nas to the number of refugees currently migrating to Germany who will stay there perma-\nnently. To capture the immigrant influx, the simulation makes the stylised assumption\nthat the population in the model grows by 1% (ie that around 800,000 people) at date\nt = 0. Assumptions also need to be made concerning the migrants' qualification levels (ie\nwhich productivity group they should be assigned to). The baseline scenario assumes that\nthe migrants' average labour productivity will not differ in the long run from that of the\nnative average workforce of the German population: the 1% population growth is thus\nsplit into high-, medium- and low-productivity employees to match the composition of the\nnative workforce. We do, however, test the robustness of our assumptions to demonstrate\nthe differences that occur if all the migrants become/remain (i) high-productivity, (ii)\nmedium-productivity or (iii) low-productivity employees. In terms of our model simula-\ntions, this implies that, for the long run, we assume \u00af\nPa,x\nnew\nPa,x\nold\nin the baseline\nscenario, whereas \u00af\nPa,x\nnew\nincreases in line with the numbers presented in Table 1 in the\nother scenarios.\nWhile the assumptions presented above reflect the long-term situation used to calcu-\nlated the new long-term equilibrium, we also need to make assumptions regarding the\nshort to medium-term developments. Specifically, this means defining scenarios for the\ntimescale of refugee migration, for the incidence of refugees who initially migrate to Ger-\nmany and then leave the country again (either voluntarily or due to deportation) and for\nthe pace of integration.\nFor simplicity's sake, we assume that, at a certain point in time, refugees equal in\nnumber to 1% of the native German population migrate to Germany and also stay there\nfor the long term. This assumption allows us to analyse the economic transmission mech-\nanisms in isolation, free from the distorting impact of additional migration and emigration\nflows. We assume, for the purpose of our simulation, that migrant refugees are wholly\nreliant on government transfers and non-financial benefits for the period of one year and\nthat they do not participate in the labour market, in an effort to model the average time\nof just under one year that it takes to process an asylum request. Once the refugees have\nbeen granted asylum (all migrants in the baseline scenario), they can be integrated into\nthe labour market in principle. However, we assume that not all migrants immediately\nbegin looking for work, but that they do so at an annual rate of 0.125 and that they first\njoin the group of low-productivity employees. It is assumed that, following a period of four\nyears following immigration, employment (through \"learning by doing\") and vocational\ntraining will have caused a certain percentage of the refugees to become as productive\neach quarter as the average native medium-productivity employee (again at an annual\nrate of 0.125). Later on, a further percentage of individuals from this pool is assumed to\nbecome as productive as the average native high-productivity employee, with the result\nthat the ratio of high and medium-productivity employees to low-productivity employees\nin the steady state does not shift in the baseline scenario. These assumptions presume\nthat the adjustment process in the population structure will last 60 years in total (ie that\nthe qualification structure of the 1% population growth will need 60 years to match that\noriginally found in the native population; Figures 1 and A.1 in section 4 and the ap-\npendix, respectively, plot the implied population developments). The assumed transition\nrates imply that a refugee who manages to reach the highest qualification group spends an\naverage of eight years in each group and that pop,x\nt\nis chosen accordingly.4 Owing to the\ninherent ridigities in the model, adjustment of other macro aggregates will take longer.\nIn addition to the assumptions made regarding refugee migration itself, we also need\nto make assumptions regarding the resulting fiscal implications. All in all, we initially\nassume that annual fiscal expenditure comes to 0.6% of GDP for migration at a rate equal\nto 1% of the native population (see German Federal Statistical Office, Destatis, 2016, for\nthe cost assumptions used and their composition; the increase in staff costs is assumed\nto be caused by a corresponding increase in staffing levels). This expenditure includes\ndirect transfers to asylum seekers (20%), an increase in social security and other non-\nfinancial benefits (70%) as well as a rise in refugee support staff costs (10%). As a next\nstep, these data can be used to calculate transfers, government consumption and staff\ncosts per refugee, which come in at around 1,250 Euro per month (the latest estimates\nput this figure at 1,000 Euro, but that does not detract from the general thrust of the\nanalysis). The gradual absorption of refugees by the labour market reduces the aggregate\nexpenditure, since it is paid only per capita as long as refugees have not joined the labour\nmarket and is discontinued altogether once they have. The individuals concerned then\nreceive transfers equal to the \"standard\" transfers for their respective qualification group.\nIn other words, if it is assumed that further expenditure on integration measures remains\nnecessary even after refugees have joined Germany's labour market, which may not be\nunlikely, the present simulation would understate the corresponding costs and should be\nregarded as a lower bound.\nIt is assumed that these costs are not immediately financed but that over the long\nterm, they will have funding that comes into play after four years in the form of a non-\ndistortionary lump-sum tax that is payable (only) by non-liquidity-constrained \u00ad forward-\nlooking and well-qualified \u00ad households, this funding acting to bring the debt ratio back\nto the starting level in the long run and then keeping it at a constant level. Although no\nsuch tax exists in the real world, it is a useful tool for modelling consolidation in model\nsimulations (see also Attinasi et al, 2016 for a more detailed discussion). In effect, this\nassumption can prevent the emergence of additional distortions that are not triggered\n4The transition rates are indeed chosen ad hoc due to the lack of reliable data. Recent findings of the\nGerman Institute for Employment Research however suggests that, while indeed being lower qualified than\nthe average native German on average, refugees coming to Germany may not be too different from native\nGerman population in terms of their ideals and educational prospects (IAB, 2016b). B\u00a8\nonke and Neidh\u00a8\nofer\n(2016) show that, at least in the second generation, past (Italian) immigrants who came to Germany did\nnot face worse educational prospects than their German counterparts, whereas Hatton (2013) provides\nevidence that refugees integrate more slowly than other immigrants. On the other hand, Aslund and\nRooth (2007) suggest that good labour market conditions and low unemployment rates \u00ad as we currently\nobserve in Germany \u00ad should speed up labour market integration. Hence, assuming 60 years for the\nrefugee generation(s) to adjust to the German one does not seem to be overly implausible. Nevertheless,\nin an appendix, we will also show the transition dynamics if all the migrants become/remain (i) high-\nproductivity, (ii) medium-productivity or (iii) low-productivity employees as a robustness analysis. In\nthese cases, pop,x\nt\nis chosen such that the corresponding long-run equilibrium is reached. We concentrate\nonly on the baseline scenario in the main text.\nby migration itself. Thus, using this tax as a fiscal instrument would allow the effects\nshown to be attributed solely to the assumed population growth and government spending\nincrease. The simulation results presented later in this paper show the long-term change\nin the lump-sum tax needed to stabilise the debt level. A positive value denotes a fiscal\nburden, while a negative value stands for relief. In principle, it can be said that in the case\nof a fiscal burden and the use of a distortionary fiscal instrument \u00ad distortionary labour\nincome taxes, for example \u00ad the effects on macro aggregates outlined below will be more\nnegative depending on the increase in the degree of distortion triggered by the instrument\nused. The opposite holds true in the case of relief. In the long run, aggregate government\nconsumption and investment expenditure expands in line with the 1% population growth,\nthereby leaving the respective government per capita expenditure at a constant level.\n3 Refugee migration in Germany: the possible long-\nterm effects\nTable 1 gives an overview of the above-described long-term population growth in Ger-\nmany as well as its assumed distribution among the various categories. It also shows the\npopulation percentage of highly-skilled, medium-skilled and unskilled households result-\ning from the above-described assumptions in the new steady state. It is obvious that, in\nthe baseline scenario, this does not differ from the original steady state. In all the other\nscenarios, the percentage share of those into which the immigrants are classified increases\nin line with the assumptions, while the other percentage shares decline.\nTable 1: Long-term increase of the various population categories\nScenario: Baseline Highly-skilled Medium-skilled Unskilled\nIncrease of...\nPopulation shares of...\nNote: Table shows long-term population growth in Germany by scenario and skill group\nas percentage growth rate and the new long-run population shares by skill groups after the\nassumed immigration inflow in per cent.\nTable 2: Long-term effects for selected macrovariables\nScenario: Baseline Highly-skilled Medium-skilled Unskilled\nMacro aggregates\nPer capita macro aggregates\nNote: Table shows percentage (point) changes of new long-run steady-state values of selected\nmacrovariables relative to initial steady state. The primary deficit ratio is expressed in\npercentage point deviations excluding changes in lump-sum taxes as described in the main\ntext.\nTable 2 shows the long-term effects of refugee migration on selected macroeconomic\nvariables. Overall, it should be noted that the population growth of 1% of the original do-\nmestic population boosts gross domestic product (GDP). GDP growth is smaller (larger)\nthan 1% if the immigrant refugees' level of productivity lies below (above) the average\nlevel of productivity of the original domestic population. In the baseline scenario, GDP\ngrowth is slightly below the growth in population, which is explained by the relative in-\ncrease in the German population's percentage share of the world's total population. As a\nresult, GDP per capita falls slightly in the baseline scenario, although we feel that this is\nmore in the area of uncertainty and not the central outcome of the simulation and should\ntherefore not be overinterpreted.\nFrom the point of view of the model, this latter effect can be explained as follows.\nThe increase in population in Germany means that, with a given export demand for\nGerman goods, per capita export demand falls ceteris paribus. This can be interpreted\nas an \"exogenous\" demand shock (especially with regard to demand from the rest of the\nworld, since demand per capita there is given exogenously). To partly compensate for this,\nGerman firms lower their prices, resulting in a fall in the relative price of German goods.\nIn the long run, however, this increases the relative costs of capital for German firms, as\nhouseholds in the old and new steady state demand a given (in the end, parameter-fixed)\nreal rate of interest in order to invest in capital. Relatively speaking, a given long-term\nreal rate of interest measured by the price of the bundle of goods thus increases businesses'\ncapital costs.5 This leads to firms reducing their capital input, which (in relative terms)\nresults in slight losses of output. Ultimately, this is due to the fact that Germany's\npopulation weight in the world has been increased exogenously. In a closed economy (or\ngiven corresponding population growth at home and abroad) this effect would be non-\nexistent, resulting in the per capita variables remaining unchanged. How momentous this\nprice effect is in reality and whether it can be compensated for by alternative modelling\nof firm entries and exits (as in, for example, Alessandria and Choi, 2007, or Ghironi\nand Melitz, 2005) or possibly changes in product market regulation (as in, for example,\nCavallari, 2010) is something that cannot be examined in the present analysis. This\ncould, however, be a component of future research on the macroeconomic effects of refugee\nmigration.\nIt is intuitively obvious that the GDP effect is all the greater, the more skilled the\nimmigrants are. If all the refugees are/remain low-skilled workers, GDP increases by no\nmore than just under 0.6%, whereas the increase is all the higher, the more skills they\nacquire. The negative effects on GDP per capita are then also commensurately smaller\n(or more positive) depending on how much better the long-term skills level of the refugees\nis/becomes.\nIn all cases, there is an increase in aggregate private consumption in Germany after\nthe refugee migration in the long term. However, the increase in consumption mostly\nslightly lags the increase in GDP, resulting in aggregate consumption per capita being\nsomewhat reduced as a rule \u00ad with the exception of the scenario in which it is assumed\nthat refugee migration has a positive impact on the structure of productivity in Germany\nin the long term. Differing reactions of individual private consumption occur, however,\nwithin the various categories (of highly-skilled, medium-skilled and unskilled households).\nIf all the immigrants become highly skilled over the long term, the per capita consumption\nof the highly-skilled category decreases, while the medium-skilled and unskilled households\nincrease their per capita consumption. The converse applies if all the refugees become\nmedium-skilled or remain unskilled over the long term. In the baseline scenario, all\nhouseholds are faced with slight falls in per capita consumption. This can be explained\n5In order to not consume today but to invest in capital (or assets), households want to be compensated\nfor this consumption-utility loss by higher expected consumption-utility tomorrow. The latter is, in the\nend, given by their discount factor   (0, 1), which is a fixed parameter, and which determines the real\ninterest rate to be 1/-1 in steady state. Lower selling prices in the new steady state, however, relatively\nincrease capital costs of firms as  is fixed.\nprimarily by the restrained growth in total per capita gross wages and salaries (which runs\nroughly in parallel with per capita GDP) as well as the above-described slightly reduced\ninput of capital (see also Table 3).\nThus, households' consumption adjustments are primarily determined by the labour\nmarket developments described in detail below (see also Table 3). Generally, it is possible\nto state at this stage already that the individual labour income of each of the types of\nhousehold falls (rises) if the category turns out to be larger (smaller) once the immigrants\nhave become fully integrated.\nBesides labour income, a part for highly-skilled/optimising households is also played by\nthe earnings performance as well as the tax burden (as described in section 2.2, expressed\nas a change in the lump-sum tax only levied on this type of household). The aggregate\ncorporate profits distributed only to these households grow roughly in line with GDP. This\nmeans that the average per capita profit distribution falls (increases) if the percentage\npopulation growth in this segment is above (below) the increase in aggregate profits.\nIf all the refugees become highly skilled, this percentage share of the population grows\nsubstantially more strongly than the profits (see also Table 1), and the relevant per capita\nearnings of the highly-skilled households decline. In the baseline scenario, there are no\nsignificant gains/losses in earnings, whereas the per capita profits show an increase in the\nlast two scenarios.\nThe state of public finances (ie the primary deficit ratio - calculated excluding the\nlump-sum tax) deteriorates slightly, especially in the scenarios with lower-skilled immi-\ngration because there is a decline in per capita income tax, consumption tax and capital\ngains tax revenues in real terms, while real spending per capita (deflated by domestic\nprices) remain largely constant.6 The fiscal situation improves only in the scenario in\nwhich the immigrants are all highly skilled in the long term; this can be attributed to\nthe increase in the tax assessment bases in real terms \u00ad which more than offsets the rise\nin spending \u00ad and, to a lesser extent, to the denominator effect (rising GDP per capita).\nA slightly higher primary deficit can be translated into a hike in the per capita lump-\nsum tax that is levied only on the highly-skilled households. This per capita increase\nis ceteris paribus all the smaller, the larger the number of people among whom it can\nbe spread; this is especially relevant in those scenarios in which refugees also become\nhighly-skilled/optimising households over the long term (see Table 2).\nIn summary, the per capita consumption of highly-skilled households increases in those\nscenarios in which these households benefit from the increases in profits as well as gross\nwages and salaries that more than offset the hike in tax, ie the scenarios in which the\nimmigrant refugees become only medium or low-skilled even in the long term. If all\nrefugees become highly-skilled households in the long term, both the lower per capita\n6In the baseline scenarios, the deficit ratio, the interest expenditure ratio and the primary deficit ratio\nare (approximately) unchanged in the long term, since it is assumed that the debt ratio is stabilised\nand unchanged compared with the situation taken as a starting point and the long-term interest and\ngrowth conditions are (almost) unchanged. The change in the primary deficit ratios shown in Table 2 is\ncalculated excluding the change in lump-sum tax. The table shows how the primary deficit ratio changes\nwithout a policy change due to the assumed population growth. To compensate for this, a corresponding\ncut or hike in the lump-sum tax is required, since the deficit ratio \u00ad as mentioned \u00ad ultimately remains\nunchanged. A negative value in Table 2 means that the primary deficit ratio has fallen (fiscal growth is\nmore positive) and, to that extent, the per capita taxes can be lowered taking into account the real tax\npayments on government debt. The opposite holds for a positive value.\nprofit distributions and the lower per capita level of employment with simultaneously\nlower wages (see Table 3) are high enough to more than offset the slight cut in the\nlump-sum tax. In this case, the per capita consumption of highly-skilled households also\ndeclines, which remains the case to a lesser extent in the baseline scenario.\nTable 3 shows the long-term labour market trends triggered by refugee immigration\ngiven various scenarios.\nTable 3: Long-term labour market trends\nScenario: Baseline Highly-skilled Medium-skilled Unskilled\nNote: Table shows percentage (point) changes of new long-run steady-state values of selected\nlabour market variables relative to initial steady state taking. By taking into account changes\nin domestic prices, wage changes are related to real wages.\nPopulation growth increases the aggregate supply of labour. Owing to the overall rise\nin macroeconomic output and the capital stock, the aggregate demand for labour also\nrises at the same time. In the aggregate of the baseline scenario, the increases in supply\nand demand cancel each other out, causing the aggregate unemployment rate to remain\nconstant. If only permanently low-skilled households immigrate, the aggregate unemploy-\nment rate goes up slightly, which is due to the fact that the immigrating refugees remain\nin a category that is characterised by an above-average unemployment rate, and therefore\nthe aggregate unemployment rate rises. The category-specific \u00ad individual \u00ad ratios remain\nconstant in all the scenarios. Category-specific per capita employment remains virtually\nunchanged as well, with the category-specific aggregate change in employment developing\nin line with the percentage category-specific change in population (see also Table 1).\nThe per capita employment and unemployment rates are held constant in the new\nlong-term equilibrium by adjusting the long-term wages. Generally speaking, an increase\nin the potential labour force lowers wage claims, with the decline in the baseline scenario\nbeing the result of marginally lower output per capita (which is to be qualified as de-\nscribed above, however). Here, redistributions among the categories may occur if there is\nimmigration into a specific category. If, for example, all immigrants become highly-skilled,\nwages will fall in this segment of the labour market, yet rise in the other segments. Much\nthe same applies to long-term immigration into the medium and unskilled segment. Since\nimmigrants move into all the categories in the baseline scenario, wages show an equally\nslight fall in all the categories in this case. Growth of the household-specific sum of gross\nwages and gross salaries derives in the baseline scenario from wage changes resulting from\nwage negotiations, not from changes in employment. For the aggregate, the respective\nincrease in population then also has to be taken into account. These wage changes are\nprimarily responsible for the changes in consumption shown in Table 2.\nIn summary, this means that individual employees are generally affected (more) neg-\natively by population growth with regard to wage losses if they are in direct competition\nwith the immigrants. The other categories, on the other hand, gain slightly.7\n4 Refugee migration in Germany: the possible short\nto medium-term effects\nThe text below sets out the short to medium term macroeconomic effects that are incurred\nif, in addition to the permanent change in demographics described in the previous section,\naccount is also taken of the migration-induced time shifts in Germany's demographic\nstructure and the resulting fiscal demand effects (in the shape of a temporary deficit-\nincreasing rise in government spending) as outlined in section 2.2. In each case, an\noverview is provided of developments over the first ten years. The adjustment path\ntowards the new long-term equilibrium detailed above which spans a period of around 60\nyears is presented in its entirety in the annex. We focus on the baseline scenario in the\nmain text, while the graphs for the other scenarios are relegated to the appendix, too.\nAs we can see, the general findings discussed in the main text go through except that,\nof course, the new long-run steady state discussed in the previous section will be reached\ncorrespondingly.\n7This does not hold entirely, however, if two categories of employees are easily substitutable. In this\ncase, the effects would be distributed more equally among both categories.\nFigure 1 shows the population growth that may be expected to arise from the as-\nsumptions described in section 2.2 for the first ten years following the influx of migrants,\nassuming that the country's long-term demographic structure does not change in terms\nof people's skills (as assumed in the long-term baseline scenario). As alternative sce-\nnarios, simulations are made of what will happen if i) the demographic structure of the\nnew steady state occurs immediately (dashed red line) and if ii) no long-term population\nincrease occurs but there is nevertheless an initial rise in government spending (a pure\nstimulus simulation; green dotted line that is not distinguishable in Figure 1 as it is ob-\nscured by the zero/blue line in the bottom right-hand panel). Scenario ii) accordingly\nillustrates how the economy would have evolved in the absence of long-term migration\nbut with a fiscal stimulus of the magnitude of initial migration-induced spending.\nFigure 1: Population growth over the first 10 years\nGerman highly productive population\nquarters\npercentage points\nGerman medium-productive population\nquarters\npercentage points\nGerman unproductive population\nquarters\npercentage points\nAsylum seekers (rel. to initial German population)\nquarters\npercentage points\nBaseline Immediate population increase Pure stimulus\nFigure 2 shows the development of selected macrovariables that results from the growth\nin population and its underlying structure. The refugee migration triggers an aggregate\nincrease in demand (=stimulus),8 because the population rises immediately and the as-\nsumption is made that all immigrants consume the total volume of received transfers in\nthe course of the first year and that government consumption (exogenously assumed) is\nraised.9 This causes aggregate GDP to increase, rising the most strongly (and, ultimately,\npersistently) if it is assumed that the final state of Germany's demographic structure (in\n8The simulation envisaged by the German Council of Economic Experts (SVR, 2015) that is mentioned\nin the introduction assumes that exogenously determined government spending and transfers rise for a\nperiod of three years before then returning to their original level according to the estimated fiscal rules.\nThe pure stimulus simulation presented here is broadly similar, except that the strength and trajectory\nof the stimulus have been adapted to match the other scenarios.\n9In the scenario in which refugees possess the same skills as the native population from the outset, no\ndirect demand stimulus is generated, as section 2.2 makes clear.\nline with the qualifications acquired in the end) sets in immediately. In the baseline\nscenario, in which refugees start out as transfer recipients before gradually migrating to\nthe labour market, the initial increase is roughly equal in size to that seen in the pure\nfiscal stimulus simulation and slowly grows alongside the corresponding demographic shift\n(see Figure 1) to reach the new equilibrium level described in the preceding section. In\nthe case of the pure stimulus simulation, the stimulus dissipates and GDP consequently\nreturns to its original level. In the baseline simulation, GDP per capita first increases\nbefore then falling as the labour force expands, initially in terms of a growing number of\nlow-skilled workers. Over time it then reverts to its starting level as the pattern adapts to\nthe original qualification structure (see also section 3 as well as Figure A.2 in the annex).\nSince the population in the pure stimulus simulation remains the same, GDP and per\ncapita GDP move in the same direction here.\nDevelopments in the labour market are depicted in Figure 3. In the case of the stimulus\nsimulation, the effects are as one would expect. The need to raise production pushes\nup labour input and brings unemployment down, causing wages to rise. As the stimulus\ndissipates, the system returns to equilibrium. However, wages respond fairly sluggishly on\naccount of the wage adjustment costs. In the simulation entailing a permanent increase in\nthe size of the population and the immediate onset of the original demographic structure,\nthe unemployment rate rises because the labour supply is \"suddenly\" broadened. The\naverage per capita length of employment decreases because more individuals are out of\nwork, causing wages to fall (comparatively rapidly) during the adjustment process, leading\nto higher demand for labour. However, owing to wage adjustment costs, it takes more\nthan 5 years (20 quarters) for the labour market to return to a state of equilibrium.\nThe baseline scenario set out in section 2.2 in which refugees successively migrate to the\nlabour market then amounts to a blend of the two scenarios described earlier. At first, it is\nthe stimulus effect that dominates (to a slight degree), but this is subsequently supplanted\nby the effect of population growth. The initial wage effects are weaker here than in the\npure stimulus simulation as wage negotiations, in particular, are conducted in a forward-\nlooking manner and the economic actors anticipate population growth (as well as the new\nlong-term equilibrium). In the case of highly and medium-skilled households, no wage\nlosses occur along the entire transition path because refugees do not compete with these\nhouseholds until the increase in GDP has reached a level that prohibits employers from\nany longer threatening to do away with these employees' jobs during the wage negotiation\nprocess in a significant manner as they are dependent on these workers' productive labour\ninput.\nThe per capita consumption growth of medium and low-skilled households is deter-\nmined by the way in which the labour market evolves (see Figure 2 for details of con-\nsumption and Figure 3 for labour market trends). In line with wage and employment\ndevelopments, per capita consumption of both the aforementioned groups thus goes up\nat first before dipping below the baseline slightly over time so as to return to its original\nlevel (see also Figure A.3 in the annex) for low-skilled employees.\nFigure 2: Macro developments over the first 10 years\nAggregate GDP\nquarters\npercent\nPer-capita GDP\nquarters\npercent\nAggregate investment demand\nquarters\npercent\nPrimary deficit ratio\nquarters\npercentage points\nAggregate priv. consumption demand\nquarters\npercent\nPrivate consumption of productive HH\nquarters\npercent\nPrivate consumption of medium-productive HH\nquarters\npercent\nPrivate consumption of unproductive HH\nquarters\npercent\nPer-capita priv. consumption demand\nquarters\npercent\nPer-capita consumption of productive HH\nquarters\npercent\nPer-capita consumption of medium-productive HH\nquarters\npercent\nPer-capita consumption of unproductive HH\nquarters\npercent\nBaseline Immediate population increase Pure stimulus\nFigure 3: Labour market developments over the first 10 years\nTotal unemployment rate\nquarters\npercentage points\nUnemployment rate productive HH\nquarters\npercentage points\nUnemployment rate medium-productive HH\nquarters\npercentage points\nUnemployment rate unproductive HH\nquarters\npercentage points\nAggregate real wage\nquarters\npercent\nReal wage productive HH\nquarters\npercent\nReal wage medium-productive HH\nquarters\npercent\nReal wage unproductive HH\nquarters\npercent\nTotal per-capita employment\nquarters\npercentage points\nPer-capita employment productive HH\nquarters\npercentage points\nPer-capita employment medium-productive HH\nquarters\npercentage points\nPer-capita employment unproductive HH\nquarters\npercentage points\nTotal per-capita lab supply\nquarters\npercentage points\nPer-capita lab supply productive HH\nquarters\npercentage points\nPer-capita lab supply medium-productive HH\nquarters\npercentage points\nPer-capita lab supply unproductive HH\nquarters\npercentage points\nBaseline Immediate population increase Pure stimulus\nIn the case of both these groups aggregate consumption is more than offset in the\nmedium term by the accompanying population increase. Aside from the relevance of\ndirect wage developments, highly-skilled/optimising households also anticipate the long-\nterm loss of income that results from a slightly reduced employment rate together with\nlower wages and from lower per capita profit distributions alongside higher lump-sum taxes\n(in each case in the new steady state; see section 3) and are already scaling back their\nconsumption accordingly in line with the permanent income hypothesis. The per capita\nconsumption of these households only rises when wages themselves rise by a significant\nenough margin. When calculating aggregate consumption, it is also necessary to consider\nthe corresponding demographics of the group in question. Aggregate macroeconomic con-\nsumption increases immediately because, for one thing, the short-term consumption losses\nincurred by highly-skilled households is more than offset by increased consumption on the\npart of medium-skilled and unskilled households, and for another, additional private con-\nsumption demand is generated by households that previously did not exist. Since these\nhouseholds are, however, (low-income) transfer recipients whose level of consumption is\ntherefore below average \u00ad and destined to remain so on account of the assumed demo-\ngraphic trend \u00ad per capita private consumption demand initially declines in the baseline\nscenario before rising again (the consumption demand of transfer recipients is not explic-\nitly shown as per capita consumption of this group is fixed to transfers).\n5 Conclusions\nRefugee migration, its repercussions, and the manner in which these two issues are being\naddressed remain at the forefront of political discourse in Germany to this day. While\nsome aspects of this topic are not related to economics, it is important to assess the\npotential macroeconomic consequences and, thus, the potential costs and benefits for\ndomestic agents. This paper adds to the literature by simulating various scenarios and\ntheir economic impacts with the aid of a New Keynesian DSGE model.\nIn summary, this paper finds that measures that cause the migrant qualification struc-\nture to closely match that of the native population over the long term do not lead to GDP\nand consumption losses, yet partial or total failure to close the skills gap can very well have\nnegative economic consequences. A failure to integrate migrants could reduce per capita\noutput and consumption by 0.38% and 0.43%, respectively, while integration measures\nthat improve the qualification structure in Germany could even yield per capita output\nThe present paper adds to the debate by explicitly taking into account short and\nlong-term effects and identifying what should be interpreted in the debate as \"stimulus\"\nand as a structural effect of refugee migration, besides showing how short and long-term\nfactors interact with one another. However, it is not providing concrete guidance on how\ngood integration can be a success. This, however, is a topic that should be addressed\nfurther by future research.\nAppendix\nIn this appendix, we fill first show the adjustments over the entire transition path in the\nbaseline scenario before showing transitional dynamics if refugees remain i) low-skilled,\nii) become only medium-skilled or iii) all become highly skilled. Then, we will focus on\nthe model description and calibration.\nA.1 Developments via entire adjustment path in base-\nline scenario\nIn this section of the appendix, we show the entire transition path of the baseline scenario\nfrom the old to the new steady state after refugee migration.

more detailed description of the model, which is, in principle, a\nshortened repetition of the model description provided by Gadatsch et al (2016) including\nthe modifications necessary for the simulations in the present paper. Note that we omit\nthe description of shocks because they are not relevant for the analysis at hand.\nWe assume that the world consists of three regions, two of them member of the Eu-\nropean Monetary Union (EMU). The third region, representing the rest of the world, is\nmodelled as a three-equation VAR. Without loss of generality, we index country-a agents\nin the interval [0, Pa\nt\n], where \u00af\nPa = 1 in the initial steady state, country-b agents in [0, Pb]\nand country-c agents in [0, Pc]. Hence, Pj, with j = b, c, is the initial steady-state size of\ncountry j relative to country a. We will continue by presenting the necessary equations\nfor country a(=Germany), where our model modifications come in.\nFirms: In each country, there is a measure-Pi\nt\n, with i = a, b, c, continuum of firms\nin the final goods sector. Firms are owned by optimising households. Each final goods\nproducer purchases a variety of differentiated intermediate goods, bundles these and sells\nthem to the final consumer under perfect competition. The producer price index (PPI)\nof goods produced in country i and sold in j is defined as Pi,j\nt\n. We assume that the\nlaw of one price holds across regions, so firms in country a set their price Pa,a\nt\nfor all\nmarkets. Multiplying with the nominal exchange rate, then, yields the price of country-a\ngoods charged in the other countries, that is Pb,a\nt\n= Sb,a\nt\nPa,a\nt\nand Pc,a\nt\n= Sc,a\nt\nPa,a\nt\n, where\nthe nominal exchange rate Sj,a\nt\nis defined as country j currency per unit of country-a\ncurrency. Clearly, Sj,a\nt\nis one within the monetary union. The maximization problem of\nthe representative final goods firm reads\nmax\n{~\nya\nt\n(z):z[0,Pa\nt\n]}\nPa,a\nt\nY a\nt\n-\n^ Pa\nt\nPa,a\nt\n(z)~\nya\nt\n(z)dz, (B.1)\nwhere Y a\nt\n= \u00b4 Pa\nt\n~\nya\nt\n(z)(a-1)/a dz\nis the production function, ~\nya\nt\n(z) his demand\nfor each differentiated input good z and Pa,a\nt\n(z) the price of each input. a\nis the elasticity\nof substitution between differentiated goods. The first-order condition of the maximiza-\ntion problem yields ~\nya\nt\n(z) = (Pa,a\nt\n(z)/Pa,a\nt\n)-a Y a\nt\n, which implies that the PPI of country\na is given by Pa,a\nt\n= \u00b4 Pa\nt\nPa,a\nt\n(z)1-a,t dz\n.\nPrivate intermediate goods firms on the continuum z  [0, Pa\nt\n] operate as monopolistic\ncompetitors in the product market. Each firm produces its intermediate good variety with\nthe Cobb-Douglas production function presented in the main text, equation (1). Note\nthat, here, we deviate from the original model provided in Gadatsch et al (2016). Taking\ninto account that the capital-to-labour ratio is common to all firms in equilibrium, this\nyields equations (3) and (4) of the main text, from which we can also derive real marginal\ncosts mca\nt\n.\nEach intermediate goods producer sets its own price Pa,a\nt\n(z) to maximize intertempo-\nral profits: the difference between revenues and production as well as Rotemberg price\nadjustment costs, the latter indicated by a cost parameter a\n. The maximization problem\nin CPI-terms can be stated as\nmax\n{P a,a\nt+s\n(z):z[0,Pa\nt\n]}\nEt\n\ns\na\na\nh,t+s\na\nh,t\nPa,a\nt+s\n(z)\nPa\nt+s\n- mca\nt+s\nya\nt+s\n(z) - adjP,a\nt\nY a\nt+s\nsubject to\nadjP,a\nt\n=\na\nPa,a\nt+s\n(z)\n(a,a\n)a (\u00af\na,a)1-a Pa,a\n(z)\nPa,a\nt+s\nPa\nt+s\nand ya\nt\n(z) = ~\nya\nt\n(z) = (Pa,a\nt\n(z)/Pa,a\nt\n)-a Y a\nt\n. The parameter a\n [0, 1] determines the\nmagnitude of price indexation on past inflation, a,a\n, or steady-state inflation, \u00af\na,a.\nBecause optimisers own firms the intertemporal discount factor of a firm includes only\nthe marginal utility of optimising, highly-skilled households, a\nh,t\n.\nHouseholds: As mentioned in the main text, we assume that the economy is pop-\nulated by three types of representative households: highly, medium- and low-productive\nhouseholds, indexed by x = h, m, l. Only highly-skilled households save and borrow, such\nthat the remaining population is assumed to be liquidity constrained as in Gali et al\n(2007). The corresponding population shares \u00b5a,x\nt\nare given in the main text. Further-\nmore, following Gali et al (2011), household members are represented by the unit square\nand indexed by a pair (hx\n, jx\n)  [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1]. Household members differ in the type of\nlabour service they are specialized in, hx\n [0, 1], and by their personal disutility of work,\njx\n [0, 1]. The latter is given by w\na,x\n\u00b7 ja\nx\nif employed and zero otherwise. w\na,x\nan exogenous labour disutility scaling parameter. a\n> 0 determines the shape of the\ndistribution of work disutilities across individual household members. Values not indexed\nby x are common across household types. Assuming that the utility of household mem-\nbers positively depends on consumption and that there is full risk sharing of consumption\nwithin a household as, for instance, in Andolfatto (1996), the utility of household-type x\ncan be written as Et\n\ns\na\nU Ca\nx,t+s\n, na\nx,t+s\n(hx\n) with\nU(\u00b7) =\nCa\nx,t+s\n- ha\n\u00af\nCa\n- w\na,x\n^ na\nx,t+s\n(hx)\nja\nx\ndjdhx\n=\nCa\nx,t+s\n- ha\n\u00af\nCa\n- w\na,x\nna\nx,t+s\n(hx\ndhx\nwhere 0 < a\n< 1 is a subjective discount factor, Ca\nx,t\nis household type x-specific private\nconsumption, and ha\n [0, 1] is an external habit persistence parameter based on type-\nspecific aggregate consumption of the previous period, \u00af\nCa\n. a\ngoverns the elasticity\nof intertemporal substitution. na\nx,t\n(hx\n)  [0, 1] denotes the household type x-specific\nemployment rate in period t among workers specialized in labour-type hx\n. Consumption\nof private goods, Ca\nx,t\n, is a composite of goods produced at home and abroad. In country\na, household type-x consumption aggregator is given by\nCa\nx,t\n= (na\na\na\nCa,a\nx,t\na + (na\nb\na\nCa,b\nx,t\na + (na\nc\na\nCa,c\nx,t\na\na\nwhere na\ni\n, with i = a, b, c, are the weights of goods in the consumption bundle according\nto their origin, implying na\na\n+ na\nb\n+ na\nc\n= 1, and a\nis the elasticity of substitution between\nthese goods. Ci,j\nx,t\n, with i, j = a, b, c, is a good consumed by households of type x in region\ni which is produced in region j. To derive the CPI of country a, Pa\nt\n, we note that total\nspending on consumption goods must obey Pa\nt\nCa\nx,t\n= Pa,a\nt\nCa,a\nx,t\n+Pa,b\nt\nCa,b\nx,t\n+Pa,c\nt\nCa,c\nx,t\n, where\nPi,j\nt\nis the PPI described in the previous section.\nNominal consumption expenditures of households amount to (1 + c,a\nt\n) Pa\nt\nCa\nx,t\n, where\nc,a\nt\nis the consumption tax rate. Income of liquidity-constrained households is given by\nnet wage income from employment in the private and the public sector, nP,x,a\nt\nand nG,x,a\nt\n,\npaying nominal gross wages Wa,x\nt\nand WG,a,x\nt\n, with x = m, l which are both taxed by the\nrate w,a\nt\n. Note that, in contrast to Gadatsch et al (2016), we now index employment\nand wages by x as we no longer assume that wage bargaining and uniform employment\ndistribution are undertaken by one economy-wide union but that they are determined\nat the household level. Unemployed household members receive nominal unemployment\nbenefits Pa\nt\n\u00b7 UBa,x. Those members who decided to participate in the labor market, La\nx,t\n,\nbut who did not find a job are unemployed, i.e. Ua\nx,t\n= La\nx,t\n-na,x\nt\n, are unemployed. Taken\ntogether, and noting that liquidity-constrained consumers spend their entire income each\nperiod, their budget constraint in real CPI-terms becomes\nt\n) Ca\nx,t\n= (1 - w,a\nt\n) wa,x\nt\nnP,x,a\nt\n+ wG,x,a\nt\nNG,x,a\nt\n+ UBa,x La\nx,t\n- nx,a\nt\nAnalogously, the budget constraint for optimising highly skilled households in real terms\nis given by\nt\n) Ca\nh,t\n+ Ia\nh,t\n+ Ba,a\nh,t\n+\nj=b,c\nSa,j\nt\nBa,j\nh,t\n+ BG,a\nh,t\n+ Ta\nh,t\n= (1 - w,a\nt\n) wa,h\nt\nnP,h,a\nt\n+ wG,h,a\nt\n, nG,h,a\nt\n+ UBa,h La\nh,t\n- nh,a\nt\n+\na\nt\n+ Ba,a\n+\na\nt\nBa,b\n+ Sa,c\nt\na\nt\nBa,c\n+\na\nt\nBG,a\nt\nra\nk,t\nka\n+ k,a\nt\na\nka\n+ Da\nh,t\n,\nwhere we have to take into account that optimizers save and borrow. Bi,j\nh,t\nare private\nbonds purchased in country i issued by country j, BG,a\nt\nis a government bond issued by\nthe fiscal authority in country a, which is held by domestic households only, and Ia\nh,t\nare\npurchases of investment goods, which is an aggregator analog to private consumption\n(see equation (B.4) above). a\nt\n= Pa\nt\n/Pa\nis CPI inflation. In addition to the wage and\ntransfer income, optimisers also receive interest on their bond holdings, at rates ia,j\nt\nfor\nprivate and iG,a\nt\nfor government bonds. Furthermore, optimizers receive a return, ra\nk,t\n, on\ntheir capital, ka\nh,t\nand pay lump-sum taxes Ta\nh,t\n. Capital depreciates at rate a\nand the\ngovernment taxes capital gains net of depreciation at rate k,a\nt\n. Da\nh,t\nare the profits of\nfirms. The law-of-motion for capital is given by\nka\nh,t\n)ka\n+\n\nIa\nh,t\n- Ia\nh,t\ni\na\nIa\nh,t\nIa\nwhich states that today's capital stock equals yesterday's capital stock net of depreciation\nplus new investments net of investment adjustment costs, i\na\nh,t\n/Ia\n.\nLabour demand and supply: Turning to labour demand, we have to differentiate\nbetween private and public sector demand. As in Forni et al (2009), we assume that labour\ndemand in the public sector gets uniformly allocated among household types, where the\npublic sector sets nG,a\nt\n= nG,x,a\nt\n. Consistent with OECD data we assume that, in steady\nstate, type-specific public sector wages include a markup, mga, on type-specific private\nsector wages.\nIn the private sector, a perfectly competitive agency buys the differentiated individual\nlabor services supplied by households, transforms them into a homogenous but still type-\nspecific composite of labor input, nP,x,a\nt\n, and sells that to intermediate goods producers,\nwho demand different labour types according to equations (2) and (3). Hence, labour\nagencies solve for each variety of labor service, h,\nmax\nnP,x,a\nt\n(h):h[0,Pa\nt\n]\nnP,x,a\nt\n=\n^ Pa\nt\nNP,x,a\nt\n(h)\n(w\na,x\na,x\ndh\nw\na,x\n/(w\na,x\nsubject to a given level of the type-specific wage bill \u00b4 Pa\nt\nWa,x\nt\n(h) nP,x,a\nt\n(h)dh = WBa\nt\n. The\nsolution of this problem is the standard private-sector labor demand for each variety. w\na,x\nis the type-specific labour substitution.\nTaking labour market conditions (i.e. wages and employment) as given, any household\nmember specialised in type hx\nlabor will find it optimal to participate in the labour market\nif and only if utility from working exceeds his or her disutility. When defining the marginal\nmember for which this condition holds with equality as La\nx,t\nand noting that jx\nLa\nx,t\ncan be seen as the labour supply of household-type x; see Gali et al (2011) for a more\ndetailed discussion. Hence, the labor supply decision of households can be summarized as\na\nx,t\nt\n) wa,x\nt\nnP,x,a\nt\n+ wG,x,a\nt\nnG,x,a\nt\n+ UBx,a La\nx,t\n- nx,a\nt\n= Nx,a\nt\nw\nx,a\nLa\nx,t\na ,\nwhere a\nx,t\nis the corresponding marginal utility of consumption.\nWage setting: In contrast to Gadatsch et al (2016), we no longer assume that there\nis a utilitarian union that sets an economy-wide wage but that households will undertake\ntheir wage setting themselves. This implies that, for each household type x = h, m, l,\nthere will be a different wage. But, within each household type, there will be no wage\ndifferential. Besides this, wage setting is modelled analogously. Hence, a household max-\nimises income of its members by optimally choosing nominal wages Wa,x\nt\n(h), taking into\naccount the disutility of work and the effects on labour supply and demand. Furthermore,\nwage setting is due to Rotemberg adjustment costs, indicated by the parameter w\na\n. For-\nmally, each union maximizes with respect to Wa,x\nt+s\n(h), nP,x,a\nt+s\n(h) and Lx,a\nt+s\nthe expected utility\nEt\n\ns\na\nx,a\nt+s\nt+s\n)\nWa,x\nt+s\n(h)\nPa\nt+s\nnP,x,a\nt+s\n(h) +\nWG,x,a\nt+s\n(h)\nPa\nt+s\nnG,x,a\nt+s\n(h)\n+ UBa,x (Lx,a\nt+s\n(h) - nx,a\nt+s\n(h)) - adjW,x,a\nt\n- w\na,x\nNx,a\nt+s\n,\nsubject to (B.9), labour demand resulting from (B.8) and nx,a\nt\n= nP,x,a\nt\n+nG,x,a\nt\n. The wage\nadjustment costs, adjW,x,a\nt\n, under Rotemberg are defined as\nadjW,x,a\nt\n=\nw\na\nWx,a\nt+s\n(h)\na\nw\na (\u00af\na Wx,a\n(h)\nWa\nt+s\nPa\nt+s\nin the above equation. The solution is symmetric, so that Wx,a\nt\n(h) = Wx,a\nt\n, Lx,a\nt\n(h) = Lx,a\nt\nand nP,x,a\nt\n(h) = NP,x,a\nt\nfor all h in equilibrium. Defining La\nt\n= \u00b5hLh,a\nt\n+ \u00b5mLm,a\nt\n+ \u00b5lLl,a\nt\nas the total labor force, we can then define the economy-wide unemployment rate as\nt\n= (La\nt\n- Na\nt\n) /La\nt\n, where Na\nt\n= \u00b5hnh,a\nt\n+ \u00b5mnm,a\nt\n+ \u00b5lnl,a\nt\n. As in the case of price\nsetting of goods, we allow for potential indexation on past wage inflation, a\n, and\nsteady-state wage inflation, indicated by the parameter w\na\nPolicy and market clearing: Fiscal and monetary policy are model exactly the\nsame as in Gadatsch et al (2016). Therefore, and because they are standard anyway, we\nomit presenting the relevant equations here. However, note that, as we now have three\nhousehold types instead of two, and as we allow for group-specific wages, fiscal revenues\nand spending must be adjusted to take account of this. Furthermore, in the equations\ndetermining aggregate demand and international trade in goods and assets, we must allow\nfor German population to be time-varying, ie we need to set Pa = Pa\nt\nwherever it appears,\nwhile Pa\nt\nis defined in equation (5).\nCalibration: In calibrating the model, we strongly rely on the main parameter\nvalues presented in Gadatsch et al (2016), who estimated the baseline GEAR model\n(without different skill groups and population growth) for Germany during the period\n1999 to 2013. As the targets for the rest of the Euro Area (RoE) are exactly the same,\nwe omit their presentation here, which also holds for the parameter calibration.\nTable B.1: Targeted initial steady state values\nTarget variable for Germany\nInitial population size, Pi 1 (2.6 for RoE)\nShare of highly-skilled employees, \u00b5h 0.3\nShare of medium-skilled employees, \u00b5h 0.6\nShare of low-skilled employees, \u00b5h 0.1\ncontinued on next page\ncontinued from previous page\nTarget variable for Germany\nFiscal policy\nPublic purchases ratio, CG\nGDP\nPublic investment ratio, IG\nGDP\nPublic employment ratio, NG\nN\nTransfers (incl.

They are based on Gadatsch et al (2016). For the unemployment rates, we deviate\nfrom the original paper as we are aiming at capturing the group-specific unemployment rates\ngiven by IAB (2016a) as described in section 2.1. Furthermore, we target group-specific wage\ndifferentials to match those also described in section 2.1 (see Destatis, 2016a), which allows\nus to obtain the values for i\nN\npresented in Table B.2.\nAs in Gadatsch et al (2016) we will first set some target values which the initial steady\nstate of the model is supposed to reflect. These target values are based on EMU data\ndescribed in more detail in Gadatsch et al (2016) and they are summarised in Table\nB.1. As Gadatsch et al (2016), we also target a net foreign asset position of zero and a\nreal exchange rate of one in the initial steady state, which allows us to obtain the the\nconsumption/investment preferences for domestically produced and foreign goods, ni\nj\n, in\nthe private consumption/investment baskets. We also normalise German GDP to one\nand set GDP in the rest of the Euro Area to 0.871 in order to capture per capita GDP\ndifferences observed in the data. Furthermore, we assume that the economies comply\nwith the Maastricht criteria in the long run and set the debt-to-GDP ratio to 60%.\nThe parameter values are standard values from the literature or taken from estimates\nin Gadatsch et al (2016). A detailed description on the parameter choice \u00ad at least those\nthat we are able to set autonomously \u00ad can be found there. However, note that, as the\nmodel used in the present paper entails some modifications, we need to derive some of\nthe parameter values \"endogenously\" to have our model match the targeted steady state.\nTable B.2 summarises our parameter choice, pointing out those parameters that deviate\nTable B.2: Calibrated parameters\nTarget variable for Germany\nPreferences\nIntertemporal elasticity of substitution ,  1\nParameter influencing Frisch elasticity,  15\nSubstitution elasticity between home and foreign goods,  0.9790\nLabour disutility of highly-skillede, w\nh\nLabour disutility of medium-skillede, w\nm\nLabour disutility of low-skillede, w\nl\nTechnology\nPublic sector productivity shifter,  1.22\nSubs.

Hence, we assume all the other feedback parameters in the fiscal rules to be zero.\nWe also need to increase  (slightly) to 15 in order to guarantee stationarity in the model.\ncontinued from previous page\nTarget variable for Germany\nInternational sector\nFrictions\nElasticity pub. inv. w.r.t. output, Kg 0.084\nElasticity pub. emp. w.r.t. output, Ng 0.074\nNote: Table shows calibrated parameter values. They are standard values from the literature\nor taken from estimates in Gadatsch et al (2016). Those that we had to endogenously calculate\nin order for our modified model to replicate the steady state indicated by Table B.1 are marked\nby an e. While one may expect the parameter N to have significant effects on the results,\nit can be shown that its influence is on the outcome only minor, especially in the long run.\nHowever, wage differentials between skill groups decrease when substitutability increases,\nespecially along the transition (results can be send upon request).\nReferences\nAcosta, P., E.
