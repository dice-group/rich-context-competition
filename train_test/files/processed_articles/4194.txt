    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study investigated the effects of users' familiarity with the objects depicted in icons on the\ncognitive performance of icon identification. First, without knowing the specific semantic\ninformation of icons, 20 participants were required to search for target icons among visually\nsimilar distractors for 3-hour-long training sessions across 1 week, during which their familiarity\nwith different icons was manipulated by differential exposure frequencies. Half of the icons were\npresented 10 times more often than the other half. Subsequently, participants' abilities to recall\ncorresponding semantic information when cued with associated target icons were tested after\nthey had learned all the icons. The results showed that, in both the visual search task and the\nsemantic information recall task, participants performed significantly better when the icons were\nmore familiar. Importantly, the effects of icon complexity in the visual search task diminished as\nparticipants became familiar with the icons, and the beneficial effects of familiarity in the semantic\ninformation recall task were larger when the icons were complex. These findings have practical\nimplications for icon design. When creating new icons for time critical user interfaces, icons should\nbe kept as simple as possible and employ familiar, commonly used, graphics.\n",

Compared with words,\ngraphic symbols are able to transcend language barriers (Bocker, 1996; Caplin, 2001;\nCorresponding author:\nChengqi Xue, School of Mechanical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing 211189, China.\nEmail: ipd_xcq@seu.edu.cn\nCreative Commons CC BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without\nfurther permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sage-\npub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\ni-Perception\njournals.sagepub.com/home/ipe\nStevens, Brennan, Petocz, & Howell, 2009) and convey large amounts of information in a\nHuang, Bias, & Schnyer, 2015; Muter & Mayson, 2007; Perry, Stevens, Wiggins, & Howell,\n2008). However, people are still likely to misinterpret the meanings of icons that are poorly\ndesigned. Thus, reducing cognitive friction and improving the user experience are critical\nproblems in icon design.\nIn general, when designers create an icon, three icon characteristics need to be taken into\nconsideration: visual complexity, concreteness, and semantic distance (Garcia, Badre, &\nStasko, 1994; McDougall, Curry, & de Bruijin, 1999; Silvennoinen, Kujala, & Jokinen,\n2017). To date, numerous studies investigated the effects of these icon characteristics on\nvisual search performance: people responded more quickly and more accurately to simple\nicons than complex icons (McDougall, de Bruijin, & Curry, 2000), users were more efficient at\nunderstanding concrete icons compared with abstract icons (Rogers & Oborne, 1987;\nStammers & Hoffman, 1991), and icons with close semantic distance were easier to\nidentify (Goonetilleke, Shih, On, & Fritsch, 2001; McDougall, Curry, & de Bruijin, 2001).\nHowever, a few researchers noticed that performance differences between different icon types\ndiminished after users had gained considerable experience with the icons (Green & Barnard,\nfactors considered central to icon usability. The findings indicated that performance\ndifferences between concrete and abstract icons diminished after icon sets were used more\nfrequently. To further explore this issue, Isherwood, McDougall, and Curry (2007)\nexperimented with an icon identification task over a long series of trials to mimic the\neffects of increasing user experience. Participants were required to select the target icon\n(from a grid of eight icons) that they thought matched the label of semantic information.\nMeanwhile, they received different feedback when they chose the correct or incorrect icons.\nThe results indicated that the importance of icon characteristics changed with user\nexperience. Previous studies have shown familiarity to be a very important factor that\nhas lasting effects on icon identification (e.g., Isherwood et al., 2007; McDougall et al.,\nHowever, there are two forms of users' familiarity with icons (Isherwood et al., 2007).\nThe first is familiarity with the relationship between an icon and its associated semantic\ninformation, which relates directly to its frequency of use. The second form is familiarity\nwith the object depicted in an icon, which refers to users' familiarity with the icon outside of\nany semantic context and independent of its purpose. That is to say, although a person may\nbe familiar with the object depicted in an icon, he or she may not know the exact meaning of\nthat icon. For example, people who have never surfed the Internet or used smart phone will\nbe unlikely to recognize that the icons in Figure 1 refer to home page and setting. However,\nwe can still consider these two icons as high familiarity icons because the objects depicted in\nthem, a house and a gear, often appear in our daily life.\nUnfortunately, previous studies seem to overlook the effects of the second form of\nfamiliarity. Depending on the user's experiences in daily life, the familiarity with the\nobjects depicted in icons might also have effects on icon identification. For example, when\nwe see a button that we have never used before, we might understand it better and recall its\nfunction more accurately if it includes a familiar symbol. Therefore, the present study aims to\ninvestigate the role of users' familiarity with the objects depicted in icons during icon\nidentification.\nAlthough only a few studies have explored the effects of familiarity on icon identification,\nnumerous researchers have conducted extensive studies in other related areas, such as picture\nnaming (e.g., Sirois, Kremin, & Cohen, 2006), Language learning (Groot & Keijzer, 2000),\nand word recognition (Coane, Balota, Dolan, & Jacoby, 2011; Meier, Reymermet, &\nthe accuracy of immediate serial recall was better for non-word syllables that occur\nmore frequently. Poppenk, Ko\n\u00a8 hler, and Moscovitch (2010) revealed that regardless of\nwhether familiarity was experimentally manipulated or formed by prior experience, it was\neasier for participants to recall familiar proverbs compared to novel ones. Almeida, Knobel,\nFinkbeiner, and Caramazza (2007) employed a delayed picture-naming task to test their\nhypothesis that stimuli frequency affected the processing of input stages. Nelson and\nShffrin (2013) used a novel training paradigm to familiarize participants with new\nknowledge about Chinese characters and then tested participants' performance on memory\ntasks. These studies demonstrated that participants' familiarity with stimuli could\nsignificantly affect their information encoding or retrieval performance. Therefore, because\nicon identification is a cognitive process that includes the encoding and retrieval of the\nassociations between icons and representations, we assume that users' familiarity with the\nobjects depicted in icons would affect their identification performance.\nTo explore our prediction, in the current study, we experimentally manipulated the\nexposure frequency of the icons that were unknown to our participants by asking them\nto perform a series of visual search tasks for similar icons. As a result, participants\nshould be more familiar with the high-frequency icons. Then, we employed a semantic\ninformation recall task to investigate the effects of familiarity with the objects depicted\nin icons after participants had learned all the icons. We expect that people identify\nfamiliar icons and recall corresponding semantic information more successfully. Moreover,\nin addition to familiarity, two more independent variables (icon complexity and concreteness)\nwere also employed in this study; we will explore whether there are interactions between\nthem as well.\nMethod\nEthics Statement\nThe procedure in this study was approved by the International Review Board of Southeast\nUniversity. Participants read and signed a consent form before participating in the\nexperiment.\nParticipants\nTwenty college students, 12 men and 8 women (ages ranging from 22 to 29 years) from\nSoutheast University participated in this study. All participants were volunteers and had\nnever participated in similar experiments before.\nFigure 1. Examples of high familiarity icons.\nShen et al. 3\nMaterials and Design\nThree hundred and eighty icons were chosen from the symbols used on industrial machineries\nand household goods as well as from the icons used in the systems of computers and smart\nphones. Before the formal experiments, we recruited 50 volunteers to rate all the three factors\n(complexity, concreteness, and familiarity) of each icon on a 5-point scale. Instructions were\nsimilar to those adopted in previous studies (Gilhooly & Logie, 1980; McDougall et al., 1999,\n2000; Snodgrass & Vanderwart, 1980). For complexity ratings, icons were to be regarded as\ncomplex if they contained a large amount of detail or intricacy (1 \u00bc definitely simple,\n5 \u00bc definitely complex); for concreteness ratings, icons were to be regarded as concrete if\nthey depicted real objects (1 \u00bc definitely abstract, 5 \u00bc definitely concrete); for familiarity\nratings, icons were to be regarded as familiar if they often appeared in daily life\n(1 \u00bc definitely unfamiliar, 5 \u00bc definitely familiar). Based on the rating results, 80 icons from\nfour sets were used in the experiment (20 complex and abstract icons, 20 complex and\nconcrete icons, 20 simple and abstract icons, and 20 simple and concrete icons, see\nAppendix). Subsequently, one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs), followed by Newman-\nKeuls comparisons, were conducted to ensure the ratings differed in accordance with the\nrequirements of each experimental condition (McDougall et al., 2000). The results indicated\nthat there were significant differences between the complexity ratings of the complex group\nicons groups, F(3, 76) \u00bc .74, p \u00bc .44. Table 1 shows the mean ratings and standard deviations\nfor complexity, concreteness, and familiarity in each icon set.\nSubsequently, each icon was assigned a Chinese word as a piece of semantic information\nwhich offered a relevant description of the paired icon. The assigning of semantic information\nto icons was based on the agreement between five experts (icon designers). To ensure that the\nicon/semantic information pairs used in our experiment were at the same level, we asked\n20 volunteers to rate the semantic distance of each icon/semantic information pair (1 \u00bc not\nclosely related, 5 \u00bc very strongly related). Semantic distance is a measure of the closeness of\nthe relationship between the icon and what it is intended to represent (McDougall et al.,\nThe result of ANOVA showed that there was no significant difference in semantic distance\nFinally, without changing the overall shape of each icon, we modified some details (e.g.,\nadding or deleting lines, enlarging or narrowing internal elements, changing filling areas, etc.)\nTable 1. Mean Ratings and Standard Deviations for Complexity, Concreteness, and\nFamiliarity in Each Icon Set.\nIcon set\nIcon characteristic\nComplexity Concreteness Familiarity\nMean SD Mean SD Mean SD\nand created four distractors for each icon (e.g., see Figure 2). By using these distractors,\nparticipants had to encode the entire icon rather than a subset of features in the visual\nsearch task.\nVisual Search Task\nParticipants performed a visual search task during three sessions on three different days in a\nweek, and each session consisted of 440 trials (see Figure 3). A 5-minute break was given\nduring one experimental session. For each participant, there were 80 icons (20 complex &\nabstract icons, 20 complex & concrete icons, 20 simple & abstract icons, and 20 simple &\nconcrete icons) in total. Taking the icon set of complex & abstract as an example, 20 icons\nwere randomly assigned into high- and low-frequency groups such that 10 icons were high-\nfrequency icons and the other 10 were low-frequency icons. As the ratio of high versus\nlow frequency was fixed to be 10:1, and therefore, by using these 20 icons, we had 100\n10 \u00c2 1 \u00bc 10). Same procedure was applied to the rest three groups. Altogether, we had 400\nsimple & abstract trials, and 100 simple & concrete trials) and 40 low-frequency trials\n(10 complex & abstract trials, 10 complex & concrete trials, 10 simple & abstract trials,\nand 10 simple & concrete trials), making total of 440 trials. Each experimental trial began\nwith a fixation, and participants had to press any button to continue. Participants saw a\nFigure 3. Trial sequence for visual search task.\nFigure 2. Examples of target icon and visual similar distractors.\nShen et al. 5\nrandomly selected target icon in the center of the screen for 1 second, which was followed by\na display of four similar icons. Participants were required to respond as to whether the target\nicon was present or absent. After participants pressed a button, they received auditory\nfeedback that indicated whether their response was correct or not. The target icon was\npresent in the search array in half of the trials. The trial order and whether the target icon\nwas present or not in each trial were randomly determined for each subject and session. The\ndependent variables were accuracy and response times in reporting whether the target was\npresent or absent in each trial.\nSemantic Information Recall Task\nAfter we familiarized participants with 80 icons over a 3-hour-long training (the visual search task\nwith three sessions), with half of the icons exposed more frequently, each participant learned the\nrelationships between icons and semantic information one by one in random order. Subsequently,\nparticipants' abilities to recall the semantic information were tested (see Figure 4). In the study\nsession, each experimental trial began with a fixation, and participants had to press any button to\ncontinue. Participants saw a randomly selected target icon and associated semantic information for\n3 seconds before the next trial appeared. The icon-semantic information pairs were same for all\nparticipants. In the test session, a cued-recall test was given after participants had learned all the\nicons and sematic information. A randomly selected icon appeared in the center of the screen for 1\nsecond, followed by a display of the input box. Participants had to recall the semantic information\nassociated with the icon and enter it in the input box. There was no time limit, and participants did\nnot receive any auditory feedback during this task. We instructed participants to try their best to be\nas accurate as possible in recalling and entering the semantic information, and we only measured\naccuracy in this task.\nFigure 4. Trial sequence for semantic information study and test.\nResults\nWe analyzed response time (RT) by linear mixed-effects regression, and we analyzed accuracy\ndata via logistic mixed-effects regressions (Baayen, Davidson, & Bates, 2008; Jaeger, 2008).\nFor the RT analyses of the visual search task, we considered only correct trials (9.3% error).\nThen, we excluded from the analyses cases with RTs greater than 3 median absolute\ndeviations above or below the median RT, calculated separately for each participant,\nsession and condition (3.4%).\nVisual Search Task\nOver the 3 days of training, participants performed better on the visual search task (see\nFigure 5), becoming faster, \u00c1AIC [akaike information criterion] \u00bc \u00c01,820, LLR [log\nthe search display.

According to the familiarity encoding methods\nused in related areas (Almeida et al., 2007; Nelson & Shffrin, 2013), we manipulated\nparticipants' familiarity with icons and created familiarity differences between high-frequency\nicons and low-frequency icons by controlling the exposure frequency of the icons in a visual\nsearch task. Compared with the visual search tasks used in previous studies, the current study\nemployed a stricter experimental design: (a) Instead of using different target icons as\nFigure 8.

Thus, in order\nto find the target, participants had to encode the entire icon, which avoided participants'\nexorbitant accuracy and too-quick responses based on the difference of any obvious feature.\n(b) To minimize the pre-exiting familiarity differences between icons, high- and low-frequency\nicons were randomly selected for each participant. (c) Half of the icons were exposed 10 times\nmore often than the other half. As a result, the familiarity difference between high-frequency\nand low-frequency icons should be obvious after three days of training.\nMost results of the visual search task were consistent with the results of previous studies\nicons had significant effects on response times and that visual search performance improved\nwith user experience. However, in the current study, because icon familiarity was manipulated\nby different exposure frequencies, we observed the effects of icon familiarity more clearly (see\nFigure 3). Participants' visual search performance was definitely faster and more accurate when\nthe icons were from high-frequency groups. Here, we provide more direct evidence\ndemonstrating that icon familiarity significantly affects visual search performance.\nMoreover, McDougall et al. (2000) only analyzed the data of response times because the\nparticipants in their experiment made a minimal number of errors. Therefore, the effect of\nicon familiarity on visual search accuracy was still unknown. To resolve this issue, as\nmentioned earlier, we appropriately increased the difficulty of the visual search task. As\npredicted, we obtained the data on proportion correctly, and the results indicated that\nvisual complexity also had a significant effect on visual search accuracy (see Figure 4).\nIn addition, our results showed that there was a significant interaction on the accuracy of\nthe visual search task. The differences in accuracy between simple and complex icons\ndiminished greatly as participants became familiar with the icons. The reason for this, we\ncontend, is that as the exposure times of the complex icons increased, participants became\nmore familiar with the features of each complex icon. As a result, it became less difficult for\nthem to identify the target icons, and the error rate declined significantly. Besides, since the\nsimple icons contained fewer features, search performance for simple icons was still better\nthan that for complex icons and tended to stabilize with time. However, there was no\ninteraction effect in response time of the visual search task. The differences in response\ntime between simple and complex icons were relatively constant throughout the training\nsession. It is most likely due to that the training session was not enough. The left panel of\nFigure 6 shows that the increasing of accuracy after the Day 2 was very little, which appeared\na ceiling effect. However, the response time of simple icons kept decreasing after the second\nsession, implying the inadequacy of training (see the right panel of Figure 6). We instructed\nparticipants to identify target icons as accurate as possible, and there was no time limit in the\nexperiment. Thus, the training needed to improve RT would be longer than that for accuracy.\nTherefore, we would expect to see the interaction effect in response time as well if the\nparticipants were provided sufficient training.\nFinally, our results also showed that although there was no effect of icon concreteness on\nvisual search accuracy, people responded more quickly to concrete icons than to abstract\nicons (see Figure 5). One possible explanation is that concrete icons contain more objects that\npeople often see in their daily lives, and it might be easier for people to identify icons that\ninclude more familiar elements.\nSemantic Information Recall Task\nAfter numerous trials of familiarity training with icons that differed in terms of their\nfamiliarity, the effects of icon familiarity in the semantic information recall task were\nexpected to be observed more directly. Our results revealed that users' familiarity with the\nobjects depicted in icons indeed influenced icon identification. As predicted, participants\nperformed significantly better when the icons were more familiar. According to the theory\nof Johnson, Paivio, and Clark (1996), the processing of semantic information recall can be\ndivided into three steps: (a) search for and locate the icon, then preliminarily identify the\nobject depicted; (b) retrieve relevant information stored in one's memory based on the results\nof identification; and (c) activate the correct semantic information associated with the icon.\nWe contend that users' familiarity with the objects depicted in icons may influence one or\nmore steps in the cognitive processing described earlier.\nNumerous researchers have suggested that the currently active information in an\nindividual's working memory will decay gradually with time, and it will become\nunavailable to subsequent processing if it is not reactivated (Baddeley, Thomson, &\nthis point of view, Working Memory is limited by how often activation can be rehearsed and\nby how quickly they decay. If reactivation can occur more frequently, it might prevent item\nactivation from decaying or reduce decay rate greatly. In the semantic information task, all\nthe relative representations were held in memory and began decaying after participants\nfinished encoding the relationships between icons and the semantic information. We\ncontend one possible explanation is that compared to more familiar icons, less familiar\nicons were relatively more difficult to reactivate, then the related semantic information\ndecayed faster, hurting recall performance as a result. Moreover, spreading activation\nmight be a more likely explanation of the frequency effects on semantic recall. The theory\nof spreading activation assumes that retrieval of information from declarative memory is\ngoverned by information activations, and items with higher activations can be retrieved more\naccurately and faster than items with lower activations (Anderson, 1983; Collins & Loftus,\n1988). Besides, activation could also spread over a semantic network rapidly, from one item\nto associative relevancy (Anderson & Pirolli, 1984; Anderson, Reder & Lebiere, 1996).\nAccording to this theory, the high-frequency icons spread more activation than the low-\nfrequency icons in the visual search task. Correspondingly, the icons with higher activation\nspread more activation to the associated semantic information, which resulted in better\nperformance in the semantic recall task. On the contrary, other researchers believe that the\nrepresentations do not decay on their own but that attempting to hold a large amount of\ninformation actively in one's working memory results in interference, such as confusion,\ncompetition, or feature overlap, which hinders the retrieval of information (Nairne, 1990;\nOberauer & Kliegl, 2006; Oberauer, Lewandowsky, Farrell, Jarrold, & Greaves et al., 2012;\nSaito & Miyake, 2004). Within this framework, we contend that familiarity with the icons\nplayed an important role at the learning stage. If the icons were more familiar, the\nrelationships between the icons and the semantic information were better encoded, and\nthus the representations were stronger and less susceptible to interference. Meanwhile, if\nthe icons were less familiar, especially those containing more complex visual details, the\nrelationships between those icons and their semantic information became relatively weak,\nwhich likely accounts for the participants' impaired recall performance.\nIn addition, the results also showed that icon complexity was another important factor\nthat influenced participants' semantic information recall performance. The explanation might\nbe similar to that concerning the effects of familiarity, as discussed earlier: The information of\ncomplex icons was more difficult to reactivate and decayed faster as a result, or the\nrelationships between complex icons and semantic information were not encoded\nsuccessfully during the learning stage, and thus, they were more susceptible to interference.\nHowever, it should be noted that we did not observe a significant effect of concreteness,\nwhich Isherwood et al. (2007) identified in their study. The reason for this, we believe, is the\ndifference between experimental paradigms. In the experiment of Isherwood et al. (2007),\nparticipants were required to select the icons that they thought matched the semantic\ninformation, but without learning the correct meaning of the icons. In contrast, in our\nstudy, participants completed a study session before they took the semantic information\nrecall test.\nMoreover, our results also showed that there was a significant interaction between\ncomplexity and familiarity (see Figure 7). When the icons were simple, the recall accuracy\nfor both high-frequency icons and low-frequency icons was high. However, when the icons\nbecame complex, the participants' accuracy with low-frequency icons decreased greatly, while\ntheir accuracy with high-frequency icons could still be maintained at a high level. That is to\nsay, the beneficial effects of familiarity in the semantic information recall task increased when\nthe icons became complex. Thus, in a sense, improving icon familiarity can reduce the\nperformance difference caused by icon complexity. A similar phenomenon can also be\nobserved in Figure 8. The reason is that compared to the other three types of icons,\ncomplex and abstract icons were most difficult for participants to identify and recall.\nImplications for Design\nThese findings have important implications for the design of icons. (a) If visual search activity\nis the key task of the digital interface, and the operator's response time seriously affects the\nquality of the entire mission, for example, in aircraft operations, nuclear power control, and\nweapons operation, then reducing icon complexity should be a top priority. The reason is\nthat the effect of icon complexity on reaction time does not diminish as users receive extra\ntraining. Thus, in this case, designers should reduce the amount of details in icons to lessen\nthe visual complexity. (b) If the task is not time-critical and the context in which the digital\ninterface used is relatively relaxed, the designer may increase the level of details in icons to\nmake the whole interface more attractive to users. Although the improvement of icon\ncomplexity might influence the identification of the icons at the beginning, that effect will\nquickly diminish as a result of user experience. (c) Designers should not merely consider the\nuser's familiarity with the relationship between an icon and its meaning; the effect of the\nicon's familiarity should also be taken into consideration when designers create new icons.\nIcons containing more familiar symbols are easier to remember and identify. Thus, unless the\ndesign of a new icon is very simple, in most cases, it is better for designers to use common\ngraphics to create new icons.\nConclusions\nUsers' familiarity with icons takes two forms: familiarity with the relationships between icons\nand semantic information, and familiarity with the objects depicted in icons. Although\nnumerous studies have demonstrated that the former is one of the primary determinants of\nicon identification, it is still not known whether the latter affects the cognitive process. In this\narticle, we investigated the effects of users' familiarity with the objects depicted in icons on the\ncognitive performance of icon identification. The results showed that, in both visual search\ntask and the semantic information recall task, participants performed worse when the objects\ndepicted in icons were less familiar. Importantly, the detrimental effects of low familiarity on\nrecall performance increased as the complexity of icon increased. These findings extend our\nunderstanding of how familiarity affects icon identification. However, this study is limited in\nseveral aspects. (a) Due to the limitation of experimental equipment, we only analyzed the\naccuracy data of the semantic information recall task. More data such as eye movement data\nand electroencephalograms (EEGs) can be collected to provide more convincing evidence. (b)\nParticipants in this study are all college students who have rich experience of using human-\ncomputer interfaces. However, the user groups should be diverse in reality, including\nchildren, elder, etc. In the future, we will employ more advanced experimental equipment\nand expand our study to more participants and more participant diversity.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article: This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of\nReferences\nAlmeida, J., Knobel, M., Finkbeiner, M., & Caramazza, A.
