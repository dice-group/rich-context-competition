More than half of the\nUS adult population has consumed alcohol in the last\n30 days, and 5% of the American adult population is\nreported to consist of heavy drinkers.2 Excessive alcohol\nuse was responsible for 80 000 deaths in the United\namounts of alcohol consumption after the onset of liver\ndisease are associated with increased mortality.1\nAlcoholic liver disease (ALD) is an important cause of\ncirrhosis and a direct consequence of excessive alcohol\nuse. ALD encompasses a broad spectrum of liver pathol-\nogy, from simple steatosis to alcoholic steatohepatitis, cir-\nrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.4\u00ad8 Long-term alcohol\nuse has synergistic effects with other causes of chronic\nliver disease to accelerate progression of liver disease.1 For\nexample, patients with Hepatitis C who regularly consume\nalcohol experience an accelerated progression to fibrosis,\nand a higher incidence of cirrhosis and hepatocellular car-\ncinoma (HCC).9 In the United States, alcohol-related liver\ndeaths account for 48% of cirrhosis-associated deaths.4\nHowever, the impact of alcoholic liver disease on overall\nand cause-specific mortality in the US general population\nis not fully understood. The aim of this study was to assess\nthe impact of ALD on overall mortality, liver-related mor-\ntality and cardiovascular mortality as ALD can be consid-\nered an entirely preventable disease through screening and\nappropriate treatment strategies.1, 7, 10\nMETHODS\nTo assess the impact of alcoholic liver disease on mortal-\nity, we used the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III) and the NHANES\nIII Linked Mortality Files.6 The survey was conducted\nfied, clustered sample design to obtain a representative\nsample of the total civilian, non-institutionalised US\npopulation. It includes an in-home interview for demo-\ngraphic and basic health information, a health examina-\ntion within a mobile examination centre, and laboratory/\nimaging tests (including ultrasonography of the\ngall-bladder and liver). Public use data files were\nobtained from the NHANES website (http://www.cdc.\ngov/nchs/nhanes.htm). The study was approved by the\nInova Institutional Review Board.\nStudy population\nDuring NHANES III, 33 994 participants were inter-\nviewed in their homes, in which standardised question-\nnaires were used to obtain self-reported data on age, sex,\nrace or ethnicity, smoking and current medical condi-\nwere reported, including non-Hispanic white, non-His-\npanic black, Mexican American and Other, which\nincluded all Hispanics who were not Mexican American\nand also all non-Hispanics from racial groups other than\nwhite and black. A positive smoking history was defined\nas ongoing smoking or having smoked at least 100 ciga-\nrettes in life. Ninety-two per cent of the interviewed per-\nsons underwent health examinations, in which blood and\nurine specimens were obtained, and a number of body\nmeasurements and tests were performed including\nheight, weight, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic\nblood pressure, glucose tolerance tests, diabetes tests,\ngeneral biochemistry tests, antibody tests and ultrasonog-\nraphy.7 The present study was restricted to participants\naged 20\u00ad74 at the time of the examination with complete\ndata on demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity), history\nof smoking and alcohol consumption, history of type II\ndiabetes, body mass index, waist circumference, blood\npressure measured at the time of examination, as well as\ngradable hepatic ultrasound video images for hepatic\nsteatosis assessment. The following tests also were\nrequired for all individuals in this study: serum glucose,\ntriglyceride, high-density lipoprotein, aspartate amino-\ntransferase, alanine transaminase, transferrin saturation\nlevels, and viral hepatitis serologies for hepatitis B virus\n(HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV).\nStudy definitions\nExposure to alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption\nwas assessed during the alcohol and drug component of\nthe NHANES III medical examination.6 Participants were\nasked if they had at least 12 drinks of alcohol in their\nentire life and in the past 12 months. Persons who\nreported no alcohol drinking in their entire life were con-\nsidered to be never drinkers. History drinkers were defined\nas persons who reported drinking at least 12 drinks of\nalcohol in their entire life, but none in the past 12 months.\nCurrent drinkers were defined as persons who reported at\nleast 12 drinks of alcohol in the past 12 months. The\namount of current alcohol consumption was determined\nfrom self-reported number of days with alcohol drinking\nand the average number of drinks per day when they\ndrank alcohol in the past 12 months. In this study, we\nAlcohol and liver mortality\ndefined one drink as 10 g ethanol, which represented\n12-oz of beer, 4-oz of wine or 1-oz of liquor. Average daily\nalcohol consumption was estimated by: the number of\ndrinks on a drinking day 9 10 g 9 the number of drink-\ning days over the past 12 months/365. Moderate alcohol\nconsumption was defined as 1\u00ad19 grams of alcohol con-\nsumption per day. Excessive alcohol consumption was\ndefined as average daily alcohol consumption of 20 g or\ngreater.12, 13 A subcategory of excessive alcohol consump-\ntion was considered as heavy alcohol consumption and\ndefined as 30 g or more of alcohol consumption per day.\nParticipants who did not answer the alcohol consump-\ntion questions and participants who reported drinking\nalcohol in the past 12 months but did not report the fre-\nquency or amount of alcohol consumption were\nexcluded from this study.\nElevated liver enzymes. Elevated liver enzymes were\ndefined as serum alanine aminotransferase level greater\nthan 40 U/L or aspartate aminotransferase level greater\nthan 37 U/L in men and alanine aminotransferase or\naspartate aminotransferase level greater than 31 U/L in\nwomen.\nAlcohol-related liver disease (ALD). ALD was presumed\nin participants who reported excessive alcohol use\n(20 g/day) for the past 12 months and had elevated\nliver enzymes at the time of the medical examination in\nthe absence of other chronic liver diseases including\nCH-B, CH-C and iron overload as defined above. The\nunexposed group (controls) included individuals with no\nexcessive alcohol consumption and no other possible\nchronic liver diseases such as CH-B, CH-C, NAFLD,\niron overload and elevated liver enzyme.\nCovariate definitions\n\u00b7 Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM) was defined as a fasting\nglucose value of 126 mg/dL or greater or the use of oral\nhypoglycaemics and/or insulin.\n\u00b7 Insulin resistance (IR) was evaluated using the homo-\neostasis of model assessment score (HOMA), which was\ncalculated using the formula: fasting serum insulin (U/\nIR was defined as a HOMA score of 3.0 or greater. DM\nand IR were combined as one variable DM/IR in our\ndata analysis.\n\u00b7 Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure\nof 140 mmHg or greater, diastolic blood pressure of\n90 mmHg or greater, or being on oral antihypertensive\nmedications.\n\u00b7 Obesity was defined as a body mass index greater than\n30 or a waist circumference more than 102 cm in men\nand more than 88 cm in women.\n\u00b7 All sera were tested for core antibody to hepatitis B\nvirus (anti-HBC). Serum testing positive for anti-HBC\nwas tested further for the hepatitis B surface antigen\n(HBsAg). Chronic Hepatitis B (CH-B) was presumed in\nindividuals with positive HBsAg.\n\u00b7 All sera from participants were tested for antibody to\nhepatitis C virus (anti-HCV). Serum testing positive for\nanti-HCV was tested further for HCV RNA. Participants\nwith positive HCV RNA were considered to have\nchronic hepatitis C (CH-C).\n\u00b7 Elevated serum transferrin saturation is a commonly\nused indicator for a predisposition of iron overload.\nPotential iron overload is defined as serum transferrin\nsaturation greater than 50%.\nwas assessed by reviewing ultrasound video images origi-\nNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was defined as\npresence of moderate-to-severe hepatic steatosis from the\nultrasound examination in the absence of any other evi-\ndence of chronic liver disease such as ALD, CH-B, CH-C\nand iron overload.\nFollow-up for mortality\nThe main outcomes in this study were all-cause mortal-\nity, liver-related mortality and cardiovascular mortality.\nThe NHANES III Linked Mortality Files provide mortal-\nity follow-up data from the date of NHANES III survey\nfrom a probabilistic match between NHANES III and the\nNational Death Index (NDI) death certificate records. In\naddition to mortality status, the linked file contains\nmonths of follow-up from examination date as well as\nto recode all deaths according to ICD-9 and ICD-10\n93\u00ad95) included causes of death such as viral hepatitis,\nhepatocellular carcinoma, alcoholic liver disease, and\nother chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Cardiovascular\nof death such as ischaemic heart diseases, heart failure,\natherosclerosis, cerebrovascular diseases, aortic aneurysm\nand other diseases of arteries, arterioles and capillaries.\nIndividuals without available mortality follow-up data or\nwho died of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\nG. Trimble et al.\nStatistical analysis\nWe compared the baseline characteristics of participants\nby the status of ALD using chi-squared test for indepen-\ndence. Periods of risk of death were defined in months for\neach participant between NHANES III examination date\nand the date of death or the end of follow-up (31 Decem-\nber 2006). Previous studies have shown that participants'\nage, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking status and disease condi-\ntions including obesity, DM/IR and hypertension were\nassociated with mortality.17 Cox proportional hazards\nmodel was used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confi-\ndence intervals for deaths from all causes, cardiovascular\ndisease and liver disease by status of ALD. To examine the\namount of alcohol consumption on the survival of patients\nwith ALD, stratified analyses by levels of alcohol con-\nsumption were conducted. Each model was adjusted for\nmajor demographic and clinical confounders including\nage, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking history, obesity, diabetes/\ninsulin resistance and hypertension. Exploratory analyses\nrevealed that the effect of obesity on mortality varied\nacross age groups; therefore, the interaction between age\nand obesity was included in the multivariate model. Statis-\ntical significance was set at P < 0.05.\nThird National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey is based on a complex multistage probability\nsample design. The sampling weights incorporate the dif-\nferential probabilities of selection and include adjust-\nments for noncoverage and nonresponse. Sample weights\ntogether with stratification and clustering were incorpo-\nrated into our analysis to estimate variances and test for\nstatistical significance.6 All analyses were performed\nusing stand alone SUDAAN 10.0 (RTI International,\nResearch Triangle Park, NC, USA).\nRESULTS\nAfter applying the exclusion criteria, a total of 8306 par-\nticipants remained in the analytical samples. Both groups\nTable 1 summarises the characteristics of participants\naccording to their diagnosis.\nThe impact of excessive alcohol use on mortality\nThe median follow-up was 178.27 months for persons\nwith alcohol-related liver disease, and 175.35 months for\ntheir controls. At the end of the follow-up, 13.86%\npersons with ALD died. Their deaths were attributed to\ncontrast, 11.25% of persons without ALD died. These\nrelated deaths.\nThe unadjusted hazard of liver-related death was sig-\nnificantly higher for persons with ALD as compared with\nP = 0.01). After adjusting for the other covariates in the\nmultivariate analysis, ALD was associated with even\nhigher risk of liver-related death (HR, 7.06; 95% CI,\nOn the other hand, the unadjusted analysis showed that\nALD was not associated with increased risk of all-cause\nTable 1 | Characteristics of\nstudy participants by liver\ndisease status from NHANES III\nCharacteristics\npercent \u00c6 S.E.\npercent \u00c6 S.E.

Additional adjustment for\nthe other variables did not materially alter the results in\nthe Cox model (Table 2).\nIt is important to note that for individuals with ALD,\nliver disease was the top cause of death, accounting for\n18.5% of all deaths. On the other hand, among partici-\npants without ALD or any other liver diseases, the top\ncause of death was cardiovascular disease, which\naccounted for 32.5% of all deaths (Table 3).\nDISCUSSION\nThis study used population data collected for\nNHANES III to assess the impact of ALD on overall\nmortality and cause-specific mortality in the US gen-\neral population. These data show that patients with\nALD are at increased risk for liver-related mortality,\nbut not for overall mortality or cardiovascular mortal-\nity. In this population-based analysis, subjects with\nALD were more likely to be of age 55\u00ad64 (non-ALD\nhad a higher proportion of >65), male, and have Mex-\nican American and non-Hispanic white ethnicity than\ncontrols.\nDespite the increased prevalence of vascular risk fac-\ntors such as smoking, insulin resistance and hyperten-\nsion, liver disease proved to be the most common cause\nof death in the ALD population, accounting for 18.5% of\nall deaths. This is different from a similar popula-\ntion-based analysis of patients with non-alcoholic fatty\nliver disease (NAFLD).17 Using the same NAHNES III\ndatabase, NAFLD patients have been shown to have a\nhigher overall mortality compared with the general pop-\nulation, with cardiovascular disease being the primary\ncause of death, accounting for 25% of all deaths.18 Our\nstudy showed that the ALD population did not have an\nTable 2 | Hazard ratios (HR) and 95 confidence intervals (CI) of all-cause and cause-specific mortality, by ALD\nCharacteristics All-cause mortality Cardiovascular mortality Liver-related mortality\nAge\nRace/ethnicity\nObesity\nBold values depict statistical significance.\n* ALD was defined as having elevated liver enzyme at the NAHNES III examination and self-reported average daily drinking of\n20 g of alcohol during the past 12 months.\nTable 3 | Causes of death in different cohorts\nTop 3 Causes of Death*\nControls\nwithout ALD\nCardiovascular disease (32.8%), lung\ncancer (10.3%), pneumonia or other\nchronic lower respiratory disease (6.9%)\nALD Liver disease (18.5%), cardiovascular\n* Based on the unweighted percentage of all deaths for each\ncause-specific death.\nG. Trimble et al.\nincreased risk for overall mortality or cardiovascular\nmortality, but only liver-related mortality.\nOne possible explanation for the cardiovascular out-\ncomes noted in this trial is the previously observed bene-\nfit of alcohol consumption and the reduction in\ncardiovascular events.19, 20 A recent meta-analysis\nshowed the minimal dose of wine at which maximal pro-\ntection could be obtained for cardiovascular mortality to\nbe 24 g/day, with similar findings for beer consump-\ntion.19 A more recent study found that the possible\nmechanistic reason for the cardioprotective effect of a\nmoderate use of alcohol was related to the AKT and\nnuclear factor (NRF2) mechanism to regulate the oxida-\ntive stress response.10 As ALD was presumed in partici-\npants who reported alcohol use greater than 20 g/day\nwith elevated liver enzymes, we can assume that the\nALD population in this study would experience the\npotential benefits described. Also, in the largest prospec-\ntive study of alcohol use and mortality, the greatest\nreduction in mortality from coronary artery disease\noccurred among drinkers who had the presence of heart\ndisease, stroke or other pre-existing risk of cardiovascular\ndisease at enrolment, which were characteristics with a\nhigh prevalence in ALD cohort.21\nIn patients at risk for liver disease, any possible benefit\nfrom a cardiovascular perspective seems to be countered\nby the significantly higher risk of liver-related mortality.\nOf the patient characteristics associated with a higher\nrisk of liver-related mortality, only advanced age proved\nto be statistically significant.\nDespite its long-term follow-up and in-depth clinical\nand mortality data, our study does have some weak-\nnesses. The most important weakness is the relative\nsmall sample size of patients with ALD, which may\nhave led to our inability to show some important\npotential associations as well as being responsible for\nthe large confidence interval seen in some of the hazard\nratios. Nevertheless, the long-term follow-up mortality\ndata make this study quite unique and important. It is\nalso important to recognise that the NHANSES III data-\nbase is based on a complex multistage probability sam-\nple design. The sampling weights incorporate the\ndifferential probabilities of selection and include adjust-\nments for noncoverage and nonresponse. Different\nweights may be associated with each individual in the\nsurvey. After applying weights in the analysis, the same\nobserved events may end up with different estimated\nIn summary, our study finds that patients with ALD\nare at an increased risk for liver-related mortality. This\nrecognition of ALD as an important cause of preventable\nmortality at the population level should prompt the\navailability of resources to address this important public\nhealth issue both nationally and globally.\nAUTHORSHIP\nGuarantor of the article: None.\nAuthor contributions: All authors have participated in\nthe study, writing of the manuscript and approved the\nfinal version of the manuscript.\n"
