We investigated whether this effect applied to performance on practical, everyday tasks. In a computer-\nsimulated restaurant scenario, participants acted as virtual servers, delivering \"plates of food orders\" to tables set up in\ndifferent \"rooms.\" Plate destination was communicated using either a distinctive alphanumeric code or a homogeneous\nnumeric code, both of which indicated the room and table number for delivery of food orders. We examined accuracy\nof plate delivery when two (low load) or three (high load) coded assignments were given per delivery trial. As expected,\nperformance declined from the low- to high-load condition. Importantly, performance declined less with alphanumeric\ncompared with all-numeric communication of assignments. Results suggest that increasing the distinctiveness of assignments,\nby using alphanumeric codes, can boost performance in real-life situations to significantly improve memory-related task\nperformance, particularly when cognitive load is taxed.\n",

Flustered servers buzz around\ntables prioritizing simultaneous requests in a desperate\neffort to \"save footsteps\" and remember who ordered what.\nIt is no wonder that classic studies on memory mnemonics\nhave investigated the on-the-job performance of bartenders\n(Beach, 1988) and waiters (Bekinschteina, Cardozoa, &\nWith three or four hot plates in hand, keeping track of where\nthe food is to be delivered can be difficult, especially when\ninundated with details on individual food specification, and\ntable location, of the hungry guest who ordered it!

While this study suggests there are indeed\nmethods being used by experts to improve memory in real-\nworld situations, the authors suggest there is a need for more\nlab-based studies that can directly manipulate factors\nthought to influence memory performance. In this study, we\ndo just that by examining how a cognitive theory could be\nused to aid memory in a real-life scenario in which memory\ndemands are high.\nA series of cognitive studies by von Restorff (1933) dem-\nonstrated that people make fewer errors when recalling atyp-\nical items (e.g., an isolated letter) presented within\nhomogeneous sets of numbers than when recalling items\n(e.g., a particular number) presented within a homogeneous\nset of numbers. This memory effect is analogous to the find-\ning in studies of perception, whereby a black square is more\ndistinct when portrayed within a white than gray background\n(Craik, 1983). The von Restorff effect, also known as the\nisolation effect, is robust (for reviews, see Schmidt, 1991;\nWallace, 1965). Essentially, the effect shows that when a dis-\ntinctive item is embedded in a stimulus display of otherwise\nrelated items, that item is retained significantly better than a\ncomparably located, but related item, in a similar set. It has\nbeen observed with a variety of stimuli such as words, using\nrelated paired associates compared with unrelated associates\n(Kimble & Dufort, 1955); with digits mixed with syllables\ncompared with other digits (Fabiani & Donchin, 1995); and\n1University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nMyra A.

The effect can also be used to confer an over-\nall memorial advantage to lists containing an isolate; the\nexplanation being that under conditions in which an organi-\nzational process on memory can occur, material is encoded\nin a more structured manner, in turn producing greater mem-\nory performance (Cimbalo, Capria, Neider, & Wilkins, 1977;\nWebster, Leland, & Bartlett, 1997). Recent work also sug-\ngests this effect extends to spatial information. For example,\nGu\u00e9rard, Hughes, and Tremblay (2008) showed that short-\nterm serial recall was enhanced for both the location and the\nserial position of a red dot when presented among a sequence\nof otherwise black dots, highlighting the role of distinctive-\nness in enhancing memory. Based on these studies, we can\nmake predictions about how to maximize accuracy when\nbusy servers deliver plates of food to specific rooms and\ntable locations in a restaurant.\nThe current work extends this traditional research in the\ncognitive domain to a real-life scenario. We examined the\nrole of distinctiveness of delivery instructions on memory\nfor location of plate deliveries to tables in a simulated res-\ntaurant setting. In contrast to studies of the isolation effect\nthat have examined retention of syllables, digits, or word\nlists using conventional laboratory procedures, we created\na simulation of a work setting in which memory was central\nto performance, and the form of encoding could draw upon\nthe von Restorff effect (or not). Specifically we manipu-\nlated whether locations for plate deliveries were communi-\ncated to servers using a number-only (homogeneous) or an\nalphanumeric (atypical, or nonhomogeneous) coding sys-\ntem for room and table location for plate delivery assign-\nments. Indeed, numerous large restaurants currently use a\nnumeric-only code to represent the destination for plates of\nfood. For example, orders are picked up from the kitchen,\nwith table location coded as a series of numbers, such as\ngested by the recent popularity of television cooking shows,\nin high-pressure restaurant environments (e.g., Fox broad-\ncasting's popular show Hell's Kitchen), and video games\nthat simulate high-pressure restaurant scenarios (e.g.,\nRestaurant Empire, Enlight Software, USA), there is a need\nfor optimizing plate delivery in large restaurant settings,\nwith multiple rooms. What sets apart good versus poor\nwaiters is not their ability to remember a couple of orders,\nbut instead it is their ability to recall multiple orders and\nCognitive research suggests that errors in delivery could be\nreduced by taking advantage of the isolation effect. For\nexample, memory for destinations would be improved if\nlocation were coded using an alphanumeric code, such as\nA21, in which room location is denoted with a letter rather\nthan a number.\nWe know that working memory has a limited capacity\ncomplexity of information given to a learner also contrib-\nutes to cognitive performance (Baddeley, 2000; Sweller,\n1988). To determine the extent to which these factors\nwould likely impact performance on our restaurant task,\nwe manipulated \"load\" of to-be-remembered information.\nIn our \"low load\" condition, two codes, or delivery assign-\nments, were given to participants, and in the high-load\ncondition, three codes were given. In all conditions, to\nmimic real-world conditions in restaurants, each assign-\nment was compound, involving various specific plates\n(e.g., \"steak, medium rare\") assigned to particular seats. It\nwas expected that in the high-load relative to low-load\ncondition, accuracy would decrease. As suggested by\nBaddeley and Hitch (1974), because working memory has\na limited capacity, the amount of information given to a\nlearner likely contributes to cognitive overload. If the von\nRestorff effect, and limited working memory capacity,\napplies to performance in more realistic situations, the\neffect of load should interact with code type in our study,\nsuch that accuracy will be higher in the alphanumeric than\nnumeric condition but only in the high-load condition.\nKnowing whether memory can be enhanced in scenarios\nsuch as these could delineate how cognitive theories and\nstrategies might be applied to attain expertise in everyday\nactivities.\nMethod\nParticipants\nSixty-six undergraduate students from the University of\nrange = 17-35 years), took part in the study. Participants\nwere recruited from the University's introductory psychol-\nogy course. They received academic credit toward their psy-\nchology course for participating.\nDesign\nThe study design consisted of one within-participant factor,\nload (low vs. high), and two between-participant factors,\norder of load (low-load first vs. high-load first), and the form\nof code used at encoding of assignment (numeric vs. alpha-\nnumeric). Performance in relation to these factors was\nassessed using each participant's score of correct deliveries\nof plates to the specified room, table, and seat (proportion\ncorrect).\nStimulus Material\nThe computer task was created for this study using\nMicrosoft's Visual Studio 2008. Participants completed the\ntask using a laptop computer, headphones, and a mouse. An\noverhead view of simulated rooms containing tables was\nshown on the computer screen (see Figure 1).\nFernandes et al. 3\nProcedure\nBriefing.Each participant was instructed that the computer\ntask involved acting as a \"server in a busy restaurant.\" They\nwere told to deliver plates to assigned destinations as quickly\nand accurately as possible.\nSimulated RestaurantTask. On a computer screen, participants\nwere familiarized with an overhead view of the restaurant\nfloor plan (Figure 1). The experimenter pointed out the dif-\nferent rooms where plates would be delivered. Each room\nhad a configuration of tables numbered in sequence. Only\nwhen participants were able to demonstrate their understand-\ning of the layout by describing it back to the experimenter\nwere they provided with headphones. In this way, we were\nable to control for bias on the part of participants who might\nsimply choose to deliver plates to the closest table possible in\nan effort to move quickly through the task.\nDepending on the participant's randomly assigned encod-\ning condition, information on the room and table number\nwas contained either in a numeric code (a three-digit number\nsuch as 324) or an alphanumeric code (a letter and a two-\ndigit number, for example, A24) that was spoken through the\nheadphones. The first character in a numeric code was the\nnumber 1, 2, 3, or 4, representing the Patio, Lounge, Atrium,\nand Studio, respectively. The first character in the alphanu-\nmeric code was the letter P, L, A, or S, representing the Patio,\nLounge, Atrium, or Studio, respectively. In both encoding\nconditions, the final two characters in the code were digits\nrepresenting a table number. Following presentation of the\ncode, entr\u00e9e names (plates) with respective seat numbers\nwere given. An example of a complete serving assignment\ngiven by numeric code is\nTable 124; spaghetti, seat 1, hamburger, seat 2, rolled ribs,\nAn example of an alphanumeric coded assignment is\nFigure 1. An overhead view of the simulated restaurant scene shown on a computer screen to participants in our study.\n4 SAGE Open\nTable A24; spaghetti, seat 1, hamburger, seat 2, rolled\nribs, seat 3.\nAs detailed below, participants heard either two (low\nload) or three (high load) such assignments on each trial,\nwith codes either all numeric or all alphanumeric depending\non encoding condition. Presentation of assignments took\napproximately 5 to 8 s, depending on the load condition.\nAfter all of the assignments were given, a list of entr\u00e9e names\nfor that trial would appear in a textbox in the same order as\npresented (simulating the fact that in real life, a server would\nbe able to see all of the plates arrayed in front of him or her).\nParticipants were instructed to deliver the plates in the order\nthey had been assigned, by finding on the computer screen\nthe correct room and table for each plate, and then clicking\non the appropriate seat. As participants thus delivered plates\nto seats, entr\u00e9e names disappeared from the textbox.\nIn the low-load condition, two different assignments were\ngiven on each of 20 trials. In the high-load condition, three\nsuch assignments were given on each of 30 trials. In both\nload conditions, approximately half of the assignments\ninvolved three entr\u00e9es (like the examples stated above) and\nothers involved four entr\u00e9es (in a mixed ordering).\nSpecifically, for the low-load condition, there were 9 three-\nentr\u00e9e and 11 four-entr\u00e9e assignments, and for the high-load\ncondition, there were 13 three-entr\u00e9e and 17 four-entr\u00e9e\nassignments. Participants were randomly assigned to receiv-\ning either the low-load or high-load condition first.\nParticipants were required to achieve an 80% accuracy\nlevel on a set of 10 practice trials before commencing the\nexperimental trials. Our intent was to minimize \"learning\neffects\" on initial experimental trials.\nResults\nA 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 repeated measures ANOVA was conducted, with\none within-participant factor, load (low vs. high), and two\nbetween-participant factors, order of load condition and\nencoding (numeric vs. alphanumeric). The dependent vari-\nable was the percentage of instances in which participants\ncorrectly executed their assignments for placing plates at\nparticular tables. This score may be considered to be a pro-\nportion-correct score, as it was calculated as the total number\nof correct seat placements divided by the total number of\nEstimation of the main effect of load yielded the expected\nmance with high load, relative to low, was evident both with\nAlthough the main effect of encoding was not statistically\npartial 2 = .03, importantly, there was a significant Load \u00d7\nfinding: From the low-load to the high-load condition, per-\nformance declined less with the alphanumeric encoding\ncompared with the numeric encoding.\nSecondarily, although the main effect of order did not\np = .509, partial 2 = .00, this factor did interact with load,\nThis interaction appears to reflect a practice effect, inasmuch\nas high-load performance was particularly poor when it was\nthe first condition encountered and low-load performance\nwas slightly lower when first.

Knowing whether memory can be\nenhanced in scenarios such as these, by taking advantage of\nthe well-established von Restorff (1933) effect, would extend\ncurrent cognitive theories and importantly, suggest strategies\nthat can be applied to enhance memory in everyday activi-\nties. Given the limited capacity of working memory, we pre-\ndicted that if the von Restorff effect applies to performance\nin our simulated restaurant environment, the effect of assign-\nment load should interact with code such that accuracy would\nbe higher in the alphanumeric than numeric condition--\nthough only in the high-load condition. This is precisely\nwhat was found.\nFigure 2. Mean proportion correct for correct placements\nof plates in relation to load (number of table assignments given\nper trial) and type of encoding of assignment (numeric vs.\nalphanumeric).\nNote: Means of proportion correct are shown next to graphed points.\nFernandes et al. 5\nIt is possible to argue that the benefit of the alphanumeric\ncode arose because the letters we selected, P, L, A, and S, are\nthe first letters of the \"room\" locations, Patio, Lounge,Atrium,\nand Studio, respectively. This correspondence may have con-\nferred a semantic advantage, rather than providing more dis-\ntinctiveness, to the alphanumeric code. We favor a\ndistinctiveness explanation, however, because the restaurant\n\"servers\" were otherwise unfamiliar with the simulated restau-\nrant. This unfamiliarity implies that the semantic meaning of\nP, L, A, and S was slight, thus minimizing any semantic facili-\ntation of memory and performance. What is more, in a pilot\nexperiment, arbitrary letters (W, X, Y, and Z) were used in the\nalphanumeric code instead of letters corresponding to words\n(e.g., P signifying the Patio room). Results took the same form\nas in the present study, with higher proportion correct in the\nalphanumeric than numeric condition--though only in the\nhigh-load condition. The letters used in the procedure were\nchanged in the current study, in part, because of difficulties\nthat some participants had in understanding the computer-gen-\nerated pronunciations of the pilot study's letters, which limited\nour ability to find a statistically significant interaction.\nThe change to the primary experiment's particular letters\nalso enhanced the procedure's external validity. In actual res-\ntaurants, it is difficult to imagine that when management of\nthat restaurant takes our advice to switch to an alphanumeric\ncode, that arbitrary letters such as W, X, Y, and Z will be\npreferred over P, L, A, and S. Thus, by allowing some poten-\ntial \"contamination\" of the isolation effect, which inspired\nthis research, from semantic effects, we demonstrated\nenhancement of performance by a change in procedure that\nrestaurants may actually use (and should use, from what we\nhave observed).\nIndeed, a paradox challenges the designer of any applied\nexperiment: to incorporate the blend of ecological factors\nthat make up reality, while conducting a tightly controlled\nexperiment where distinct variables can be manipulated to\ndraw causal inferences. Given the scope of our research\nquestion, it was impossible to fully satisfy both of these ide-\nals in one study. In any event, our study has shown that well-\nknown effects within the lab can be applied to enhance\neveryday performance on memory-related tasks.\nThe von Restorff effect has been shown in other work to\nenhance memory, even in populations known to have mem-\nory difficulties. Bireta, Surprenant, and Neath (2008) showed\nthat memory performance in a lab setting can be increased in\na population of senior citizens when one item is made dis-\ntinct from the other items in a list during encoding (akin to\nour alphanumeric vs. numeric code in the current study);\nthey showed memory for the distinctive item is improved, in\nline with the isolation or von Restorff effect. Smith (2011)\nrecently showed the same pattern of memory benefit in older\nadults, when the contrast between an isolated and back-\nground items was increased. There is no reason to suspect\nthat the benefits to performance documented in the current\nstudy, from employing an encoding strategy that takes\nadvantage of the isolation effect, would not extend to such\npopulations. Research in patient populations suggests the\nisolation effect is reliant on the integrity of the medial tempo-\nral lobes, and it is only in populations in which this brain\nregion is compromised, or lesioned, that we fail to see a ben-\nefit (Kishiyama, Yonelinas, & Lazzara, 2004). It seems that\nencoding strategies that highlight distinctiveness by increas-\ning the contrast between items at encoding, such as using an\nalphanumeric compared with numeric code, are a general\nmeans to best organize input to promote enhanced output;\neven studies in chimpanzees show a similar isolation effect\non memory (Beran, 2011). In conclusion, our results extend\nthis line of research by showing that increasing the distinc-\ntiveness of delivery assignments in a restaurant-like setting,\nby using alphanumeric codes that promote an isolation effect,\ncan significantly improve memory-related task performance,\nparticularly when cognitive load is taxed as is often the case\nin real-life scenarios.\n"
