The purpose of the study was to examine the relationships between the status of\nsubclinical thyroid conditions and cognition among adolescents in the United States.\nMethods: Study sample included 1,327 adolescents 13 to 16 years old who participated in the\nThird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Serum thyroxine (T4) and\nthyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were measured and subclinical hypothyroidism, subclinical\nhyperthyroidism, and euthyroid groups were defined. Cognitive performance was assessed using\nthe subscales of the Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised (WRAT-R) and the Wechsler\nIntelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R). The age-corrected scaled scores for arithmetic,\nreading, block design, and digit span were derived from the cognitive assessments.\nResults: Subclinical hypothyroidism was found in 1.7% and subclinical hyperthyroidism was found\nin 2.3% of the adolescents. Cognitive assessment scores on average tended to be lower in\nadolescents with subclinical hyperthyroidism and higher in those with subclinical hypothyroidism\nthan the score for the euthyroid group. Adolescents with subclinical hypothyroidism had\nsignificantly better scores in block design and reading than the euthyroid subjects even after\nadjustment for a number of variables including sex, age, and family income level.\nConclusion: Subclinical hypothyroidism was associated with better performance in some areas of\ncognitive functions while subclinical hyperthyroidism could be a potential risk factor.\nBackground\nThyroid hormone plays a crucial role as a regulator of\nnervous system myelination, of growth and puberty, and\nof metabolism and organ functions [1]. It has been well\nrecognized that hypothyroidism at early stages of life,\nsuch as congenital hypothyroidism, can cause various\nabnormalities including mental retardation and delayed\nmyelination [2,3]. Disorders affecting the thyroid gland\nrepresent the most common endocrine pathology in\nchildhood [4].

There\nis mounting evidence to suggest that mild (subclinical)\nthyroid disorders may be potential contributors to signif-\nicant clinical conditions [6]. However, the relationship\nbetween subclinical hypo-hyperthyroidism and cognition\namong adolescents has been studied much less. In the\nThird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III), serum total thyroxine (T4) and thyroid\nstimulating hormone (TSH) were measured, and cogni-\ntive function was assessed for adolescents 12 years or\nolder. Using the data from NHANES III, this study exam-\nined the relationship of subclinical hypo-hyperthy-\nroidism with cognitive performance among adolescents\nin the United States.\nMethods\nData and study sample\nData from the Third National Health and Nutrition Exam-\nination Survey (NHANES III) were used for this study.\nUsing a stratified multi-stage probability sampling design,\nNHANES III collected data representative of the non-insti-\ntutionalized civilian U.S. population, aged two months or\ndesign and operation of NHANES III can be found else-\nIn the youth sample of NHANES III, there were 2,216 chil-\ndren 12 to 16 years old at the time of the interview.\nserum thyroxine and thyroid stimulating hormone. Ado-\nlescents who did not participate in the cognitive assess-\nment were excluded from this study. One subject who\nreported use of medication for thyroid disorder was also\nexcluded. Consequently, the sample used in this study\nVariables of interest\nT4 was the sum of the free and protein bound forms in\nserum and measured by radioimmunoassay.

The\nreference range of TSH was 0.39 to 4.6 mIU/L. The meas-\nurements of T4 and TSH were detailed in NHANES III [9]\nand elsewhere [10]. Hyperthyroidism was defined as clin-\n\u00b5g/dl. Hypothyroidism was defined as clinically signifi-\ncant if TSH > 10 mIU/L and T4 < 4.5 \u00b5g/dl and subclinical\nCognitive function was evaluated using the subsets of two\ntests: the Wide Range Achievement Test \u00ad Revised (WRAT-\nR) and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children \u00ad\nRevised (WISC-R) [11,12]. Two subsets of the WRAT-R\ntest, arithmetic and reading, were administered. Two sub-\nsets of the WISC-R test, a verbal component (Digit Span)\nand a performance exam (Block Design), were also\nadministered. The WISC-R test was administered first and\nwas followed by the WRAT-R test. Raw scores were\nrecorded. Standardized scores were determined using the\ncalculations provided in the WRAT-R and WISC-R manu-\nals. The age-corrected scaled scores for the subsets, which\nare comparable between WRAT-R and WISC-R, were pro-\nvided in NHANES III data set and were analyzed in this\nstudy. The cognitive assessments were performed accord-\ning to a standard protocol described in the NHANES III\nOther variables of interest included sex, race/ethnicity,\nage, poverty income ratio, language used, and the exam-\niner who conducted the cognitive assessment. These vari-\nables were based on the operational definitions set forth\nin the NHANES III. Race/ethnicity referred to the follow-\ning four categories as reported by the primary respondent\nin the screening and family interview portion of the sur-\nvey: non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic African American,\nMexican American, and other (i.e., Hispanics not of Mex-\nican origin or non-Hispanics from racial groups other\nthan white or African American). Age used in this study\nreferred to chronological age (in completed months) at\nthe time of the NHANES III examination and was con-\nverted (divided by 12) to years for analysis. The poverty\nincome ratio was the ratio of the reported family incomes\ndivided by the poverty threshold, which is produced\nannually by the Census Bureau and adjusted for changes\ncaused by inflation. The variable was categorized into <1,\n1\u00ad2, >2, and a missing category was also created for anal-\nysis. Families were below the poverty line if their poverty\nincome ratios were less than one. In the cognitive assess-\nment, Spanish was used as alternative language to English.\nCodes for the examiners who conducted the cognitive\nassessment were recorded in the NHANES III data set.\nData analysis\nDescriptive statistics including proportions and means\nwere used to describe the characteristics of the study sam-\nple. General linear models were used to compare mean\nlevels of cognitive assessment scores among adolescents\nwith the subclinical hyperthyroidism and with subclinical\nhyperthyroidism to the mean score among the euthyroid\ngroup. The cognitive assessment scores among the differ-\nent groups were further analyzed with adjustment for sex,\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nrace/ethnicity, age, poverty income ratio, language used,\nand examiner in the cognitive assessment by including\nthese variables in the models. To account for sampling\nstrategy, such as over-sampling and clustering in the\nNHANES III, all the general linear models were performed\nusing SPSS Complex Samples (an add-on module for\nSPSS for Windows) for complex sampling design with\napplication of the weights established for the NHANES III\nThe NHANES III data sets are accessible at the US Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention's website. Because our\nstudy was a secondary analysis of the data existing in the\npublic domain, it was exempt from review by the East Ten-\nnessee State University Institutional Review Board. The\nstudy was carried out in compliance with internationally\nrecognized guidelines on ethics.\nResults\nThe study sample consisted of similar numbers of males\nand females. For a small number of adolescents, cognitive\nfunction was assessed in Spanish. African Americans,\nMexican Americans, and adolescents from low-income\nfamilies were over-represented in the sample as indicated\nby the percentages (Table 1), reflecting the design feature\nof NHANES III. A total of ten examiners performed the\ncognitive assessments for the study sample.\nTwenty two subjects (1.7%) were classified as having sub-\nclinical hypothyroidism and 30 subjects (2.3%) as having\nsubclinical hyperthyroidism. There was no clinical hyper-\nthyroidism or clinical hypothyroidism identified by our\ncriteria. Three subjects had TSH levels above 10 \u00b5g/dL but\nT4 levels all were within the reference range.\nMean scores of each cognitive assessment tended to be\nlower in adolescents with subclinical hyperthyroidism\nand higher in adolescents with subclinical hypothy-\nroidism than that in the euthyroid group (Table 2). For\nexample, mean scores of block design were 8.36 for the\nsubclinical hyperthyroidism group, 9.19 for the euthyroid\ngroup, and 11.62 for the subclinical hypothyroidism.\nMean scores in reading and block design were signifi-\ncantly higher in the adolescents with subclinical hypothy-\nroidism than the scores in the euthyroid group.\nTable 3 shows the results from the general linear model\nadjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, poverty income ratio, test\nlanguage, and examiner. Even after the adjustment, ado-\nlescents with subclinical hypothyroidism had signifi-\ncantly higher mean scores in reading and block design\nthan euthyroid adolescents (the reference group).\nTable 1: Characteristics of the study sample (n = 1,327)\nCharacteristics n %\nSex:\nEthnicity/race:\nPoverty Income Index:\nTest language:\nAge (in years):\nTable 2: Cognitive assessment scores by thyroid condition among adolescents: The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nArithmetic Reading Block Design Digit Span\nn Mean (SE) Difference\n(SE)\nMean (SE) Difference\n(SE)\nMean (SE) Difference\n(SE)\nMean (SE) Difference\n(SE)\nSubclinical\nhyperthyroidis\nm\n(Reference)\n(Reference)\n(Reference)\n(Reference)\nSubclinical\nhypothyroidism\nn, Sample size.

Our analysis found a higher average cognitive score\nin mild hypothyroidism and a lower average cognitive\nscore in mild hyperthyroidism in adolescents in compari-\nson to the euthyroid group. Mean scores in reading and\nblock design were significantly higher in adolescents with\nsubclinical hypothyroidism than the scores in the euthy-\nroid group.\nIn children, contrary to congenital hypothyroidism, sig-\nnificant correlations between low thyroid hormone value\nand higher achievement in psychoeducational tests at\ndiagnosis were observed in pediatric endocrinologists'\npractices. Behavior problems and decline in school per-\nformance after initiation of treatment for juvenile\nacquired hypothyroidism were recognized [15]. It was\nhypothesized that these children were overachievers in\nthe thyroid-deficient state because of the decreased activ-\nity levels and lower arousal. We demonstrated that sub-\nclinical thyroid status was correlated with cognitive\nfunction. Cognitive performance tended to be better for\nadolescents with subclinical hypothyroidism. It is possi-\nble that these children were overachievers due to\ndecreased activity levels and lower arousal also. Although\nour data does not support poor cognitive function in\nacquired juvenile subclinical hypothyroidism, it is possi-\nble that prolonged and severe forms of hypothyroidism\nmight have negative effects on cognitive functions. Treat-\nment of subclinical hypothyroidism in children with psy-\nchiatric disorders, behavior problems, and learning\ndisabilities is not an uncommon practice. The benefit of\nsuch treatment is controversial. Our findings suggest that\ntreatment decisions of subclinical hypothyroidism in chil-\ndren should be very cautious.\nMean scores of the cognitive assessments tended to be\nlower for adolescents with subclinical hyperthyroidism\nthan that for adolescents with normal TSH levels,\nalthough the differences in the cognitive assessments did\nnot reach statistical significance in this study. This may\nsuggest that hyperthyroidism may be a potential risk fac-\ntor affecting the cognitive performance among adoles-\ncents, though the effect could be indirect. Children with\nhyperthyroidism usually present with behavioral distur-\nbances such as attention problems, difficulty in concen-\ntration, and hyperactivity, which may lead to poor\ncognitive performance [16]. Attention disturbances in\nchildren with hyperthyroidism become attenuated once\neuthyroidism is achieved through treatment [17].\nRoutine screening for thyroid disease with thyroid func-\ntion tests is not recommended for asymptomatic children\nor adults [18]. The clinical impact of subclinical thyroid\ndisease is not fully known. In this study, subclinical thy-\nroid condition might be associated with cognitive per-\nformance; therefore monitoring thyroid function in\nadolescents with cognitive disorder could be helpful. The\nimportance and timely diagnosis and treatment of sub-\nclinical thyroid disease, however, continue to be conten-\ntious research topics at this time.\nThis study used data from a national sample of adoles-\ncents residing in the United States, thus study findings\ncould be applicable to the adolescents on a population-\nwide basis. However, the study has several limitations.\nFirst, the number of adolescents with T4 and TSH values\nbeyond the reference ranges was rather small in this study.\nThus, the study might have insufficient power to detect\nthe differences between the groups in certain subscales of\ncognitive function. This might explain that compared to\nthe euthyroid group, adolescents with subclinical hyper-\nthyroidism appeared on average having a lower score in\neach of the cognitive subscales, but the difference did not\nreach statistical significance. We were also unable to per-\nform meaningful analyses stratified by race/ethnicity or\nsocial economic status due to the limited sample size. Sec-\nond, cognitive performance was assessed using the subsets\nTable 3: Adjusted differences\u00b6 in mean cognitive assessment scores by thyroid status among adolescents: The Third National Health\nArithmetic Reading Block Design Digit Span\nn Mean\nDifference\nSE Mean\nDifference\nSE Mean\nDifference\nSE Mean\nDifference\nSE\nSubclinical\nhyperthyroidism\nSubclinical\nhypothyroidism\n\u00b6Mean difference was derived from the general linear model with adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity/race, poverty income ratio, test language, and\nexaminer using SPSS Complex Sampling.\nn, Sample size.

The clinical significance of the differences in\nthe cognitive assessments observed among adolescents\nmay be limited by the lack of standards for the partial\nassessment scores. Furthermore, the NHANES III cogni-\ntive assessment scores were on average much lower than\nthe standardized data for the subscales of WRAT-R and\nWISC-R even among the healthy adolescents. This has\nraised questions on the appropriateness of using NHANES\nIII data to assess cognitive outcomes [19]. We realized that\nin NHANES III, the cognitive assessments were performed\nby trained technicians (not psychologists) and in a less\ncontrolled testing environment, which might not be com-\nparable to the standard situation. However, the cognitive\ntests were applied to adolescents in NHANES III indiffer-\nently regarding their thyroid status. We believe that the\nassessment scores for the different groups would indicate\nthe relative levels of cognitive function among the groups.\nThe NHANES cognitive data has been used to examine the\neffects of environmental tobacco smoke, food insuffi-\nciency, and blood lead levels [20-22]. Therefore, our esti-\nmates on the relationships between the subclinical\nconditions and cognitive function were thus not likely dis-\ntorted.\nConclusion\nSubclinical hypothyroidism was associated with better\nperformance in some areas of cognitive functions while\nsubclinical hyperthyroidism could be a potential risk fac-\ntor.\nAbbreviations\nNHANES III, Third National Health and Nutrition Exam-\nination Survey\nT4, total thyroxine\nTSH, thyroid stimulating hormone\nWRAT-R, Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised\nWISC-R, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nDr. Tiejian Wu initiated the research idea and performed\ndata analysis.
