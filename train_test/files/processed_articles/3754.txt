Records of observations precede records of\ntheir verbal descriptions; that is, the products of art precede those of writing. Relatively little\nis known about the origins of visual art. Examples of marks made on tools and cave walls\nhave been dated to many thousands of years ago, but we do not know when such activities\nbegan. Writing had its origins around 5,000 years ago. The adoption of experimental methods\nto record observations is a development of recent centuries. What we consider to be art\ninvolves the distillation of specific observations into spatialised representations (what we\ncall pictures) or of categories of observations into stylised representations (typically written\nwords). Both pictorial images and written words are spatially extended, and both can be\nconsidered as icons. The term icon now has several connotations, but it derives from the\nGreek word eikon meaning likeness or image. It is in this sense that it will be used here so\nthat an icon can be equated with a pictorial image.\nPerception has evolved to make and maintain adaptive contact with the environment.\nThrough the action of the senses an organism seeks sustenance, shelter, and sex in order to\nsurvive and reproduce. The senses of all species have become adapted to the demands of\ntheir survival and reproduction, and there is a great variety in the ways in which senses have\nevolved. In addition, the human senses are linked to an intricately organised brain, which\nhas evolved to extract more than the elements of material sustenance. It furnishes us with\nintellectual sustenance, too, and extracts from the patterns of sensory stimulation links to\nlanguage and thought. Humans not only use their senses but they also muse about them.\nParadoxically, much of this musing has concerned minor errors of perception (referred to here\nas eye contricks) rather than the constancies of what we perceive. Despite the long history\nof recording perceptions, attention continues to be directed to eye contricks--the small\ndeviations from constancy that we call illusions. Constancy and illusion can be considered\nas existing on a continuum from veridical perception (reflected as a Brunswik ration of 1)\nto complete illusion (as in some instances of induced motion, when the physically moving\nparts are seen as stationary and the stationary parts as moving in the opposite direction).\nMost of our perception involves constancy or minor deviations from it; these latter we call\nillusions (or eye contricks). Artists have developed an array of eye contricks in order to\nachieve their ends--conveying an allusion to the objects or classes of object they represent.\nIt will be argued that visual scientists now share this concern with artists. They examine\nrepresentations of objects (usually pictorial representations of them) rather than the objects\nthemselves: they are engaged in intricate manipulations of eye contricks which might not\nfurther our understanding of object perception.\nFigure 1. Icon Tricks (\u00a9 Nicholas Wade).\nThe concepts of image and icon have thrived on their vagueness, and so attempts\nhave been made to refine them (see Wade 1990). An icon corresponds to a pictorial\nimage: it is spatially extended and can share some of the projective characteristics of the\nobject represented. Thus a photograph of a pipe is an icon or spatialised image because\nit corresponds to a projection of the three-dimensional object onto a two-dimensional\nsurface. It also represents a specific pipe viewed from a particular direction. The word PIPE\nis similarly an icon or stylised image, but it refers to a category of objects rather than to\nspecific exemplars. Like all pictorial images, icons are eye-cons: they provide a distillation\nof a complex object or idea into a simple pictorial shape. They create the impression of\nrepresenting that which cannot be veridically presented. Despite the clich\u00e9 that the camera\nnever lies, the links between icon and object are tenuous in photographs. The dimensions of\ndistance or depth as well as motion are missing from the pictorial image or icon, and this\nalone introduces all manner of potential ambiguities. Wagemans et al (2011), Koenderink et\nal (2011), and van Doorn et al (2011) discuss the apparent depth in pictorial images and the\nways in which they can be measured. The history of art can be considered as an exploration\nof the missing link between icon and object: the many pictorial tricks applied by artists\nallude to the dimensions that icons and pictorial images do not contain--depth and motion.\nEye-cons (as in Figure 1) can be more honest--they can reflect tricks of vision so that what is\nseen does not necessarily correspond to what is presented.\nThe term \"eye-con\" is also a play on words. The English language affords vast license for\nword play, and I will engage in this exercise in the titles of the eye-cons presented. However,\nmy main concern with \"eye contricks\" is to engage in a play on images rather than words. That\nis, less attention has been directed to the shapes of letters and words than to the meanings\nthey convey. Indeed, even that great artistic wizard with words and images--Ren\u00e9 Magritte\n(1898\u00ad1967)--did not apply his artistry to letter and word shapes. He was more concerned\nwith confounding the verbal and visual labels than with complicating the shape of the word.\nConcrete or visual poetry has shown a similar reluctance to manipulate the fundamental\n1996). I will use letter and word shapes in a variety of graphical ways in order to play tricks\nwith icons. A broader range of eye contricks involving \"perceptual portraits\" can be seen in\nWade (2006) and at http://neuroportraits.eu.\n2 Stylised and spatialised icons\nWe all make icons (pictorial images) constantly, though we rarely think of them in this way--\nwe can all write although most of our writing is now done indirectly via a computer keyboard.\nAccordingly, pictorial images can be either stylised, like the letters of our written language, or\nspatialised, like drawings, paintings, and photographs. Figure 2 conflates these two types of\nicons by presenting the words in both conventional and idiosyncratic scripts: conventional\nuppercase letters spell the words IMAGE repetitively in the top half and WORD in the\nbottom half. However, these conventional letter shapes are enclosed within idiosyncratic and\nincomplete script for WORD at the top and IMAGE at the bottom; only parts of the complete\nletters are presented, and they are joined by an equally idiosyncratic AND. The handmade\nwords are more difficult to read as a consequence, unlike the conventional printed letter\nshapes. Moreover, the colours themselves play parts in the perceptual puzzle: the red is\nphysically equivalent throughout, as is the blue, but they do not appear so. Owing to colour\nassimilation, the red looks darker in the upper half than in the lower, and the blue looks\nlighter in the lower than the upper half.\nStylised pictures, as in written scripts, are obviously arbitrary and dependent upon\nconvention. Chinese pictograms differ markedly from our alphabetical letters, but they can\nbe arranged to allude to the same objects by those schooled in the rules of the language. Thus,\nwritten words are also instances of visual allusions. They present us with indirect references\nto objects and ideas. They are stylised images that usually have little spatial similarity to the\nthings they signify. This is the basis for the discordant tune played by Magritte on his pipes\n(Figure 3). The word \"pipe\" has little in common spatially with the vast variety of objects\nthat would be members of that category. In this sense, a word is worth a thousand images!\nTo be more precise, a stylised image is worth an infinite number of spatialised images: any\nobject can be represented by an infinite number of spatialised images by varying its pictorial\ndimensions, viewpoint, etc. We can make words less indirect by depicting the shape of the\nobjects to which they refer. That is, the stylised image (the shape of the word) can represent\nthe class of objects the word signifies, whereas the spatialised image is a specific instance of\na member of that category. The simulated reality of both spatialised and stylised pictures\nis appositely portrayed in a picture by Magritte entitled The Perfidy of Images (see Foucault\nFigure 2. Images and Words (\u00a9 Nicholas Wade).\nMagritte's initial pipe painting was produced around 1928, and he made several variations\non the theme. The title signalled his desire to pit word against image: printed beneath the\nspatialised image of the pipe are the words \"This is not a pipe\". Thus, the viewer is confronted\nwith the message that although this looks like a pipe it is actually pigment on canvas, ink or\nsilver crystals on paper, or light on a screen: the pictured pipe cannot be smoked or handled,\nindeed it seems to be floating in air rather than supported on any surface. We do not know if\nthere ever was an actual pipe that Magritte painted. He might have represented a pipe from\nhis imagination, in which case it would have been a pipe dream! Note that Magritte painted\nthe words, too, so he was using one symbolic picture (the written word--a stylised image) to\nsay that another symbolic picture (the shape and colour of the pipe--a spatialised image)\nwas not the object represented. When the painted pipe and painted words are in conflict like\nthis we are more likely to think that the pipe shape does not correspond to the object rather\nthan question the relation of the word shape to its referent.\nWhen objects are represented in isolation they tend to be depicted in what can be\nreferred to as the stereotypical view (Wade 1990). This has also been called a typical outline;\nother terms for it have been canonical or prototypical views. They all involve minimal\nforeshortening of the most asymmetrical axis. Therefore, the stereotypical view is the\nmost informative two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional object. Another\nway of describing the stereotypical view would be as the least ambiguous silhouette (see\nWagemans et al 2008). The pipes in Figure 3 could have been photographed from many\nother directions, some of which would not have been readily recognised as pictures of a pipe.\nMagritte's painting depicted a pipe from the side with its bowl inclined slightly towards the\nviewpoint; the side view does not shorten the asymmetrical axis of the pipe stem, and it is\nthe stereotypical viewpoint. There is less relation between Magritte's painted word PIPE and\nthe shape of actual pipes than there need be. The variety of letter shapes is vast--from the\nminor variations in typefaces to the extravagant ornamental shapes used in advertising and\ncalligraphy. When we take the vagaries of handwriting into account, the range of recognisable\nletter shapes explodes even further, as is evident with the upper-right pipe in Figure 3.\nIt encompasses two ways of writing the words UNE PIPE. The lower one corresponds to\nFigure 3. These Are Not Magritte's Pipes (\u00a9 Nicholas Wade).\nMagritte's handwriting, but the uppermost one is idiosyncratic and complements the shape\nof Magritte's painted pipe. Does the combination of the shape of the pipe with the word used\nto describe it make it more like a pipe? The pipe was not an arbitrary instrument on which\nMagritte played his surreal chords! He was, in fact, rebelling against ideas prevalent in the\nlate 1920s regarding the universality of the pipe or tube shape, as advocated by the architect\nle Corbusier (Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret, 1887\u00ad1965). Pipes can also be tubes, and they can\nhave a variety of other meanings, too, which can be alluded to by word pictures shown in\nMagritte described himself as a philosopher who wielded a paint brush rather than a\npen, and his confounding of stylised and spatialised images speak to this appellation. His\ntune was played on more than pipes. In his painting Ceci n'est pas une Pomme he painted\nan apple with the caption stating that it was not one. Again, the equivalence, rather than\nthe conflict, between stylised and spatialised icons can be emphasised, as in Figure 4 (left).\nApples featured in many of Magritte's paintings and often obscured the facial features of his\nsubjects. For example, in The Great War an apple is painted in front of the bowler-hatted\nfigure. A variant of the theme is played in Figure 4 (centre), in which identity is partially\nexposed. Magritte also made a series of paintings in which he gave false names to pictured\nobjects. In his Key of Dreams he divided the canvas into four quadrants and painted a pictorial\nimage in each of these. Three were accompanied by inappropriate verbal labels: beneath\na picture of a horse the words THE DOOR were painted, a clock was accompanied by THE\nWIND, and THE BIRD beneath a picture of a jug. This icon trick has been turned on its\nstylised head in Figure 4 (right), where the jug is THE BIRD. The sounds of the verbal labels\nare determined by the demands of language, and the same object is given varied vocalisations\nin a variety of languages. In this sense they can be considered as arbitrary, as can the letter\nshapes or scripts used to capture the particular sounds.\nOne of the reasons why we equate pictorial images with the objects they represent is\nbecause of the many camera-derived images we see constantly in print, on television, and\non computer screens. It is these perspective pictures that provide us with such a satisfactory\nsubstitute for reality. The camera always lies: it delivers a time-frozen image of a dynamic\nworld. We do not see by means of static images in the eye; our eyes are in continual motion\ndue to either involuntary or voluntary eye movements. This is quite unlike any image a\ncamera can deliver.\nFigure 4. The Apple of His Eyecon (\u00a9 Nicholas Wade).\n3 Illusions as eye contricks\nEye contricks are much more than visual illusions, although they can operate at this level.\nBecause icons and pictorial images generally seem to convey their meaning with such\nimmediacy, we rarely stop to ponder the paradoxes they pose. If they are so important, we\nshould understand more about the way we see them and the processes that are involved in\nmaking them. Pictorial representations, like those captured by a camera, are traditionally\nreferred to as creating illusions of objects in three-dimensional space, but this is less than\naccurate because it betrays a misunderstanding of what is meant by the term illusion. Such\npictures are visual allusions rather than visual illusions. The distinction is more fundamental\nthan a single letter, and it can be illustrated in Figure 5. The words VISUAL ILLUSIONS are\ndimly defined by the green and yellow outlines and the slight difference in colour and contrast\nto the background. Throughout the figure there are red vertical lines; they are parallel to one\nanother, but they probably look tilted one way and then the other. This is an example of an\nillusion.\nFigure 5. Allusory Illusions (\u00a9 Nicholas Wade).\nIllusions are the result of genuine and consistent mistakes in our perception (Gregory\nred vertical lines in Figure 5. That is, a constant mismatch occurs between perception of\nan object property and the physical description of it. The lines are physically vertical and\nparallel even though they appear to be tilted away from one another. This is because of the\nwavy lines they cross: without them the lines would look parallel and there would be no\nillusion. Illusions are unitary and compelling perceptions, whereas allusions involve the\nperception of at least two aspects of pictures simultaneously. There are two visual allusions\nin Figure 5. One is an allusion to depth--the wavy lines look like a three-dimensional surface;\nthe depth might appear ambiguous, with one set of curves looking like humps then like\nhollows, but the depth is apparent while at the same time the surface of the page is seen as\nflat. This is the most pervasive form of visual allusion we encounter, and it has proved to be\none of the most persistent concerns throughout the history of art. Representational pictures\nhave a dual reality: they are perceived as what they are--marks on a flat surface--while at the\nsame time representing objects. They are allusions because viewers do not try to handle the\nobjects depicted as they would the actual objects they represent. There is no doubting the\nflatness of the surface on which the marks are made. The other allusion in Figure 5 (which\nis more difficult to discern) is a self-portrait. It might not be immediately visible, but it is\nthere physically in the slight thickening of the blue wavy lines. The geometrical design carries\nwithin it, virtually unseen, another picture. It might be necessary to blur the pattern in some\nway in order to see the hidden image; some people can do this by focusing their eyes on some\nimaginary point between the picture and their eyes, and others can do the same by shaking\nthe head from side to side or by shaking the surface on which the picture is printed. This type\nof visual allusion is rather like a literary allusion, where the indirect reference remains in the\nbackground--but once appreciated it cannot be dismissed.\nIn visual science illusions provide the quintessential examples of eye-cons. Spatial or\nchromatic features that are physically equivalent appear otherwise because of the context\nin which they are placed. Illusions as departures from veridical perception have been a\nconstant source of enquiry throughout the recorded history of vision. Nonetheless, they\nwere imbued with increased significance in the late 19th century. On the one hand, they\nliberated psychology from physiology and, on the other, they were considered to hold the\nkey to unlock the secrets of perception. Moreover, they could be readily visualised via simple\nicons which induced compelling contrasts. Paradoxically, some of the first illusions displayed\nin this form were of phenomena that could be experienced in the natural environment, like\nthe moon and waterfall illusions (Wade 2005a). Helmholtz (1867) was able to see the start of\nthis illusory movement, and he also added a static illusion that is called Helmholtz squares\n(Figure 6). It is basically an example of the horizontal\u00advertical illusion: the area defined by\nhorizontal lines appears smaller than that made up of vertical lines.\nThe illusions that attracted the interests of many 19th-century visual scientists were those\nlabelled \"geometrical optical\" by Oppel (1856). They consist of relatively small but reliable\ndistortions of visual space, mostly in the domains of size or orientation. Many novel forms\nwere devised and depicted in the final decades of the century, and they often bear the names\nof those who first drew and described them (see Vicario 2008). Geometrical optical illusions\nare phenomena of the late 19th century, when the likes of Ponzo, Poggendorff, Mach, and\nM\u00fcller-Lyer described their eponymous phenomena. It is, however, instructive to examine\nwhy there should have been this burst of illusory activity in the late 19th century. Put another\nway, why did icons assume such a central role in the study of visual perception? It could\nhave been due to the combination of two powerful strands of thinking about vision. The\nfirst stems from the 17th century, when Kepler and later Scheiner elucidated the dioptrical\nproperties of the eye. They thereby set in train the idea that the problem of perception has\nan icon as its starting point--the static, two-dimensional retinal image. The retinal image\nwas considered as static, and the problem was seen as restoring the missing dimension of\ndistance from the ambiguous projection. However, this is both a physical and a physiological\nfiction.\nThe static retinal image is a convenient physical fiction because it allows us to draw\nray diagrams that describe the dioptrical properties of the eye. It is a physiological fiction\nbecause the eye is never still and the receptors collect energy at differential rates depending\nupon wavelength and luminance. Nonetheless, these fictions continue to drive our models of\nvision. The second strand relates to the experimental approaches to the study of perception\nexperimental rigour of the physical sciences should be brought to bear on the study of\nperception. Thus stimulus variables should be isolated and manipulated in quite unnatural\nways in order to determine how perception is modified. It is difficult to manipulate solid\nobjects, but it is exceedingly easy to create novel pictorial images or icons. Moreover,\nWheatstone himself had shown that the perception of three-dimensional space can be\nsynthesised from the use of two appropriate flat drawings. So pictures or icons became the\naccepted stimuli for the study of vision. Once accepted, the psychologists then rediscovered\neye contricks that had been a part of the artist's armoury for centuries, and they devised\nFigure 6. Helmholtz Squared. Helmholtz is enclosed twice within squares like those he printed, defined\nby either vertical or horizontal lines; the blue lines are physically the same throughout (\u00a9 Nicholas\nWade).\nThe Helmholtz squares illusion is based on the distortions of space in the cardinal\norientations. It is now called the horizontal\u00advertical illusion, and it is usually represented\nas single lines in an inverted T shape. It incorporates both orientation and extent, whereas\nmost others involve one of these dimensions alone. Two orientation illusions are shown\nin Figure 7. That on the left consists of the original figure used by Johann Karl Friedrich\nappearing to be inclined. Z\u00f6llner sent his icon to the journal Annalen der Physik und Chemie\nwhich was edited by Johann Christian Poggendorff (1796\u00ad1877), whose portrait is shown in\nFigure 7, left. Poggendorff noted that the edges of the cross-hatched lines appeared out of\nalignment, and his name is now associated with that illusion. A more contemporary drawing\nof the Z\u00f6llner illusion is shown on the right: the concentric squares appear to be distorted\nbecause of the diagonal lines that cross them. Z\u00f6llner's portrait is also alluded to in the\nillustration on the right; it might be difficult to discern initially, but when it is seen his palsied\nright cheek and lip will be evident.\nIllusions of length were represented somewhat later, but they have been subjected to more\nintense experiment and interpretation than those of orientation. The illusions of Franz Carl\noptical illusions have an important place in the history of psychology, because they were\namongst the factors that led Wundt to establish his Psychological Institute at Leipzig in\n1879--he could not envisage how illusions could be accounted for in physiological terms;\nand so they, along with consciousness, required a separate discipline. Wundt took as his\nyardstick the proximal stimulus (the retinal image)--and he could not accept that, say, two\nlinear extents (like the horizontal lines in Figure 8, left) that produced equivalent retinal\nextents could yield perceptual inequality due to physiological processes. Thus, geometrical\noptical illusions are important in the context of establishing psychology as an independent\ndiscipline: there was considered to be no physiological correlate of perception. Psychologists\nlike Wundt sought to determine correlates, and the one most favoured at that time was in\nterms of eye movements, although other higher-level alternatives were also entertained.\nContrast phenomena provided another potent source of visual illusion. Although the\ninfluence that a surrounding colour can have on an enclosed one had long been known,\nFigure 7. Illusions of Orientation. On the left Poggendorff is shown in the diagram Z\u00f6llner published\nin Poggendorff's Annalen; it illustrated the illusions with which both are associated. Z\u00f6llner can be\nseen on the right in a modern variant of his orientation illusion; his right eye is centred in the pattern\nand he is facing to the left (\u00a9 Nicholas Wade).\nFigure 8. Illusions of Extent. Left, the two red horizontal lines are the same physical length but they\nappear different: the upper one appears longer. This was described by M\u00fcller-Lyer, whose bearded\nfeatures are present in the illustration. Right, converging lines create contrasts in size perception, as is\nevident in the two same-sized portraits of Ponzo: the upper one appears larger than the lower one (\u00a9\nNicholas Wade).\nsubtle effects of brightness contrast were described in the 19th century. For example, Ludimar\nthe left of Figure 9--dark dots appear at the intersection of the lighter lines. He related the\nillusory dots to the operation of simultaneous contrast. The converse, where light grey dots\nare seen at the intersections of the darker lines, was described later by Karl Ewald Konstantin\nThe Hermann grid on the left of Figure 9 contains the face of Hermann, and the Hering grid\non the right contains Hering's portrait.\nFigure 9. Hermann-Hering Grids. The grid on the left contains the face of Hermann, whereas the grid\non the right carries the face of Hering. The faces will be seen more easily if the figure is viewed from\nseveral metres (\u00a9 Nicholas Wade).\nThe Hermann and Hering grids have assumed a position of considerable importance\nin contemporary visual science, as they have provided a means by which receptive fields\nrecorded physiologically can be related to \"perceptive fields\" determined psychophysically\nThe dimensions of concentric receptive fields are smallest in the retinal ganglion cells\nreceiving their input from the central fovea, and they increase in size with increasing distance\nfrom the fovea. This is probably the reason why the Hermann-Hering dots are not visible\nat the fixated intersection: both the centre and surround would fall between the squares\nand within the intersections, so that there would be no differential response from them, and\nno illusory dots. If the separations are made sufficiently small, then the dots can be seen at\nthe fixated intersections. It is by this means that measuring the limiting dimensions of grids\nyielding the illusory dots has been used to estimate the sizes of perceptive fields at different\neccentricities in human vision.\nIn the 19th century the study of illusions was used to argue for the independence of\npsychology from physiology. The static proximal stimulus had been described, and so the\ntwo lines of the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion would project equal length lines on the retina and visual\nneuroscience stopped at the retina--so physiologists could not account for the illusion.\nIllusions were studied in the late 19th century because they were not amenable to the extant\nphysiology--hence their place in psychology. They also fostered the use of two-dimensional\nstimuli in perceptual experiments, giving vision the aura of scientific respectability.\n4 Pictures as eye-cons\nPictorial images are icons which provide allusions to objects, and some of the eye contricks\nthat can be played with the transition from three to two dimensions. Indeed, this is grist to\nthe artistic mill: icons incorporate ambiguities and impossibilities that are rarely or never\npresent in objects. Are icons so central to understanding perception? What is the relationship\nbetween perception of pictorial images and of the objects they portray? Will understanding\nicons facilitate our interpretations of vision, or vice versa? And how do those peculiar eye-\ncons, geometrical optical illusions, relate to other forms of pictorial representation? It could\nwell be argued that the study of vision will not be furthered by the examination of such\noddities.\nFigure 10. Allusionists. Portraits of Dali (left), Picasso (centre), and Duchamp (right) are carried in\ndesigns that characterise some of their artistic and visual endeavours (\u00a9 Nicholas Wade).\nFigure 11. Optrio. Vasarely, Riley, and Wilding can be seen in Op Art designs of the type they produced.\nAll include portraits facing to the left, but that of Wilding also contains a right-facing portrait (\u00a9\nNicholas Wade).\nMagritte was not alone in generating subtle eye contricks: others on the surrealist scene\nwere sowing similar seeds. For example, Salvador Dali (1904\u00ad89) and Marcel Duchamp\n(1887\u00ad1968) drew upon the emerging experimental research on vision to further their\nartistic ends. Dali not only amplified ambiguities in many of his early paintings but also\npresented more subtle variations on the digitised images of Abraham Lincoln, constructed\nby Harmon and Julesz (1973)--see http://www.michaelbach.de/ot/fcs_mosaic/. Duchamp's\nrotoreliefs, produced at around the same time as Magritte's pipe pictures, followed\nrapidly on the heels of Musatti's (1924) experiments with the stereokinetic effect, where\nsimple circular patterns appeared in depth when rotated--see http://lite.bu.edu/vision-\nflash10/applets/Depth/Benussi/Rotorelief.html and http://www.opprints.co.uk/stereokinetic-\n3-4-6.php. Other kinetic works by Duchamp were based on visual persistence. His Rotary\nGlass consisted of propellers of glass on which arcs were painted: when they were rotated\nrapidly they created the impression of circles (see Wade 1978). Between both these artists,\nand influencing them artistically, was Pablo Picasso (1881\u00ad1973). The development of\ncubism represented an attempt to embrace the other missing dimension in icons--time--by\ncapturing views of the same subject at different moments of movement. All three artists are\nshown in Figure 10. On the left Dali's trademark moustache encloses contours alluding to\nambiguous depths from which his third eye peers. In the centre Picasso can be seen within\ncubist depictions of his name PABLO PICASSO, and Duchamp's profile is part of a pattern\nthat, if rotated, would appear like a cone in depth.\nThe science and art of vision merge in the genre referred to as Op Art. Op Art is first and\nforemost geometrical and hard edged: the shapes displayed are precisely defined by sharp\nedges, and the assemblage is geometrical rather than naturalistic (see Follin 2004; Guigon\nworks are generally abstract, with no representational features. The aspect that distinguishes\nthe genre from many other forms of geometrical abstraction is the dramatic visual effects\nproduced by the arrangements of contours. The works induce an immediate interaction\nwith the observer because the viewer's eyes are a fundamental feature of the interaction\nbetween icon and observer. Not only do Op Art works \"strike the eye\" but they also undergo\ndynamic changes in the process of observation. This is the context for the meeting between\nvisual art and visual science. One of the leading exponents of the genre was Victor Vasarely\n(1906\u00ad97), who is dimly discernable in the red-and-green grid shown on the left of Figure 11.\nVasarely constantly experimented with geometrical abstraction, and he tried to remove the\nimprint of personality from his work, much of which can be mechanically produced. His\nconcern was with simple geometrical shapes like circles, squares, and triangles, and he\nvaried the sizes, colours, and relations between these in many ingenious ways (Holzhey\n2005; Vasarely 1965). He produced a large number of works in stark black and white, and\nthese were often visually vibrant--they would appear to move, or the shapes would seem\nto reorganise themselves into novel configurations. These marked the beginning of Op Art\nin the 1950s. Later, he worked more with colour, often using synthetic materials for added\nintensity. Another pioneer of Op Art is Bridget Riley (Figure 11, centre), who is best known for\nher high-contrast, black-and-white paintings of geometrically periodic patterns. Movements\nand distortions of the patterns are seen even though none are occurring on the picture plane\nwithin the visual system of the observer, and so they are truly interactive paintings. Her\nportrait is embedded in a drawn design that displays many of the visual distortions seen in\nher paintings. The wavy radiating lines appear to shimmer and move, particularly around\nthe inflection points of the curves; the contours fluctuate in clarity, being sharply defined at\none moment and blurred at the next. These changes are a consequence of minor variations\nin the curvature of the crystalline lens, which produce transient astigmatism. It is when the\ncontours are blurred that Bridget Riley's portrait can be seen. The wavy lines also display\nanother phenomenon--that of impossible figures. The contours can appear to represent\na three-dimensional surface, but one that could not be realised: curves which appear like\nbumps on one side look like hollows on the other. Following a hump or hollow from one\nside to the other will result in an inflection of the surface near the vertical midline, adding to\nthe visual tension generated by the design. Both Vasarely and Riley (as well as the other Op\nArtists) were, however, drawing on a longer tradition both in visual science and in art.\nWhen two periodic patterns are superimposed, slightly out of alignment, a new configu-\nration emerges that is determined by the intersections of the component patterns. This is\ncalled a moir\u00e9 pattern (after moir\u00e9 antique or watered silk, which has a pronounced parallel\nweave). When two gratings are inclined relative to one another, the dominant impression is of\nthe parallel moir\u00e9 interference fringes due to the regions of minimal overlap of the gratings. It\nis obvious from the name alone that moir\u00e9 patterns have long been observed, but they have\nalso proved to be of interest to physicists over the last century. Illustrations of more complex\nmoir\u00e9 patterns can be found in textbooks of optics as well as in many art galleries; examples\ncan be found at http://www.opprints.co.uk/moire-fantastic.php. Moir\u00e9 patterns have proved\nparticularly potent in the works of a number of Op Artists. One of the greatest exponents\nare due to the interaction between a vertical grating and a radiating pattern. He is portrayed\ntwice, facing left and right, with his features defined by slight variations in the sizes of the\nelements. Small separations in depth between the interfering components magnify the depth\nseen in the disparate moir\u00e9 fringes, and Wilding utilised this effect to create a novel form of\nFigure 12. Ceci est Magritte (\u00a9 Nicholas Wade).\nThis selected survey of eye contricks has now come to an end. As was intimated at the\noutset, it is rarely the eye that is being conned by icons, but it is the brain that is struggling to\nfind the solution to the paradoxes that pictorial images pose. Magritte was concerned with\neye contricks--demonstrating the allusory nature of all images--and so it is fitting to end\nwith one of him (Figure 12).\n5 Conclusion\nTo question the appropriateness of icons as the stimuli for vision is more subversive than it\nmight at first appear. Are not our ideas of the retinal image also iconic? We have certainly\nprogressed in our physiological knowledge since Wundt; indeed, there are now physiological\ninterpretations of illusions. But have our ideas about the nature of the retinal image advanced\nalso? Visual phenomena provide the bedrock for science and art. Both disciplines revel in the\nlicense allowed by iconic manipulation. Natural vision is binocular and dynamic, yielding\nthe perception of depth and motion. Icons are flat and static, but, when modified and\npresented via a computer, they can present us with perceptual paradoxes. The deeper puzzle\nis whether visual science is being conned by icons. Is it being seduced by the simplicity of\nimage manipulation and losing sight of the functions that vision serves? Is vision now the\nscience of eye-cons?\nReferences\nFollin F, 2004 Embodied Visions: Bridget Riley, Op Art and the Sixties (London: Thames & Hudson)\nFoucault M, 1983 This is not a Pipe translated and edited by J Harkness (Berkeley, CA: University of\nCalifornia Press)\nGablik S, 1976 Magritte (London: Thames & Hudson)\nGregory R L, 2009 Seeing Through Illusions (Oxford: Oxford University Press)\nStrasbourg)\nHelmholtz H, 1867 Handbuch der physiologischen Optik in Allgemeine Encyklop\u00e4die der Physik\nvolume 9 (Leipzig: Voss)\nHering E, 1907 \"Vom simultanen Grenzkontrast\" in Graefe-Saemisch Handbuch der gesamten Au-\nHermann L, 1870 \"Eine Erscheinung des simultanen Contrastes\" Pfl\u00fcgers Archiv f\u00fcr die Gesammte\nHollander J, 1991 Types of Shape (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press)\nKoenderink J, van Doorn A, Wagemans J, 2011 \"Depth\" i-Perception 2 in press\n& Hudson)\nLingelbach B, Ehrenstein W, 2002 \"Das Hermanngitter und der Folgen\" Deutsche Optikzeitung 5\nNinio J, 2001 The Science of Illusions translated by F Philip (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press)\nOppel J J, 1856 \"Neue Beobachtungen und Versuche \u00fcber eine eigent\u00fcmliche, noch wenig bekan-\nnte Reaktionsth\u00e4tigkeit des menschlichen Auges\" Annalen der Physik und Chemie 99 540\u00ad561\nPinna B, Reeves A, 2009 \"From perception to art: how vision creates meanings\" Spatial Vision 22\nRiddell A, 1972 Eclipse: Concrete Poems (London: Calder & Boyars)\nRiley B, 2009 Bridget Riley: Flashback (London: The Hayward Gallery)\nRoberts A M (Ed.), 2011 Poetry Beyond Text (Dundee: University of Dundee Press)\nRobinson J O, 1972 The Psychology of Visual Illusion (London: Hutchinson)\nSpillmann L, 1994 \"The Hermann grid illusion: a tool for studying human perceptive field organiza-\nvan Doorn A, Koenderink J, Wagemans J, 2011 \"Rank order scaling of pictorial depth\" i-Perception 2\nin press\nVasarely V, 1965 Vasarely (Neuchatel: Griffon)\nVoss E, Drucker J, 1996 Experimental, Visual, Concrete: Avant-garde Poetry since the 1960s (Amster-\ndam: Rodopi)\nWade N, 1982 The Art and Science of Visual Illusions (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul)\nWade N, 1990 Visual Allusions: Pictures of Perception (London: Lawrence Erlbaum)\nWade N J, 2005a Perception and Illusion: Historical Perspectives (New York: Springer)\nWade N J, 2006 \"Perceptual portraits\" in Neurobiology of Painting (San Diego: Elsevier) pp 17-38\nWade N J, 2009 \"Allusions to visual representation\" in Neuroaesthetics (Amityville, NY: Baywood) pp\nWagemans J, De Winter J, Op de, Ploeger A, Beckers T, Vanroose P, 2008 \"Identification of\neveryday objects on the basis of silhouette and outline versions\" Perception 37 207\u00ad244\nWagemans J, van Doorn A, Koenderink J J, 2011 \"Measuring 3D point configurations in pictorial\nWheatstone C, 1838 \"Contributions to the physiology of vision: part the first.
