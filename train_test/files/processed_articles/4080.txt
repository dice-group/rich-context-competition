There were 15 quantitative studies and 8\nqualitative studies. The stress and coping model developed by Lazarus and Folkman was the most popular theory that was\nused to guide the studies. The variables that were explored in the quantitative studies consisted of social support, stress,\ncoping, caregiver burden, quality of life (QOL), and others. The qualitative findings revealed that there were several themes\nsuch as the following: the meaning of being family caregivers for cancer patients, the meaning of care, the experiences of\ncaregivers, and the problems and needs of family caregivers in the Thai context. The evidence from the 23 studies reviewed\nshowed that the state of knowledge of cancer caregivers in the Thai context is at an early stage compared with the state of\nknowledge in Western countries. More research needs to be done to explore the concepts related to negative and positive\noutcomes of caregiving.\n",

There are\nadvances in medicine to treat cancer, but the numbers of can-\ncer patients who die from this disease increase every year.\nMoreover, there are the ongoing changes in the health care\nsystem (American Cancer Society, 2010; Jemal, Siegel, Xu &\nWard, 2010). This change has resulted in a shift of cancer care\nfrom hospital to home settings (Girgis & Lambert, 2009). The\nnumbers of cancer patients seen in the outpatient department\nThis shift indicates that the family's involvement in caring for\npersons with cancer has increased and may reflect an increas-\ning impact of cancer on family members (Given, Given &\nThe literature suggests that cancer patients have several\nkinds of problems and needs including symptom manage-\nment, disease and treatment monitoring, medication admin-\nistration, psycho-emotional support, assistance with activities\nof daily living, and assistance with instrument care (Esper,\ncan cause burdens for family caregivers because they are\noften unprepared to provide care for the patients at home\n(Cameron, Shin, Diane Williams, & Stewart, 2004). They\nalso receive only minimal attention from most health care\nproviders, who tend to be focused primarily on the patients'\nneeds (Ferrell et al., 2011). They are a vulnerable and at-risk\npopulation that remains neglected by the health care system\n(Blum & Sherman, 2010). Hence, it is not surprising that\nresearch findings revealed that family caregivers' various\nneeds and health concerns pertaining to caring for a loved\none with cancer at home are inadequately explored.\nSpecifically, knowledge and information needs have been\nreported as the greatest needs among family caregivers\n(Blum & Sherman, 2010). In addition, the results of studies\nwith cancer caregivers found that cancer affects all aspects of\nfamily caregivers including their physical, psychological,\nsocial, financial, and spiritual well-being (Girgis & Lambert,\nneed help from other people and health care providers to\n1Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand\n2Boromarajonani College of Nursing, Saraburi, Thailand\n3University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nWarunee Meecharoen, Boromarajonani College of Nursing, Saraburi\n18/64 Tedsaban 4 Road, Tambon Pakpriew, Muang District, Saraburi\nEmail: warunee_mee@yahoo.com\nFamily Caregivers for Cancer Patients in\nThailand: An Integrative Review\nWarunee Meecharoen1,2, Laurel L.

We will be less effective in\nplanning care if we do not understand the needs of family\ncaregivers for cancer patients in the Thai context. Hence the\npurpose of this integrative review was to describe findings\nfrom studies of Thai family caregivers for cancer patients as\na basis for facilitating new directions in research and clinical\npractice.And so the research question that guided this review\nwas, \"What is the state of knowledge about family caregivers\nfor patients with cancer in Thailand?\"\nMethod\nThe literature review for this study includes a search of the\nThailand Library Integrated System (ThaiLIS), the Research\nLibrary of National Research Council of Thailand, E-Theses\nin the Library of Thai universities including Burapha\nUniversity, Chiang Mai University, Chulalongkorn\nUniversity, Kasetsart University, Khon Kaen University,\nMahidol University, Naresuan, University, Prince of Songkla\nUniversity, and Thammasat University, this with no date\nlimitations. In addition, published articles in Thai journals,\nhard copy of theses, and reference lists of articles found by\nhand searching were included in this review. E-theses,\nresearch articles, and hard copy of theses that were included\nin this integrative review had to meet the following inclusion\ncriteria: qualitative or quantitative research design, study par-\nticipants were adult family caregivers providing care for adult\npatients with cancer in Thailand, published or unpublished,\nand in Thai or the English language. Key search terms that\nwere used included caregiver, carer, spouse or partner, rela-\ntives, family member, caregiving, and cancer in Thai and the\nEnglish language. An electronic form was developed by the\nresearcher to record detailed information about research.\nThe data were extracted from the primary study in the fol-\nlowing areas: research title, author, year of publication, pub-\nlication vehicle (e.g., thesis, journal article), research\nquestion/purpose, framework, method, variable, instrument,\nparticipant, characteristics of caregiver, and findings. Data\nwere analyzed using descriptive statistics (e.g., frequency,\npercentages, mean, and range) to describe the information\nobtained from the research studies. Moreover, content analy-\nsis was used to categorize the research findings. Categories\nthat were extracted and presented in this article included\nstudy characteristics, conceptual or theoretical frameworks,\nresearch variables, sampling techniques and caregivers' char-\nacteristics, and research findings.\nResults\nStudy Characteristics\nThere were 23 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The\nwere from 5 journal articles, 17 theses, and 1 dissertation. Of\nthe research designs used in the 23 studies in this review, 15\nstudies were quantitative design and 8 studies were qualita-\ntive design. The quantitative studies comprised 14 descrip-\ntive or correlational studies (Chansirimongkol, 2007;\nPhuwarawuthipanich, Nampetch, & Khamwicha, 1996;\nManeewan, Panutat, Sudjinda, & Paisalsuthidaj, 1994;\nWannasiri, 2005) and one quasi-experimental study\n(Sakunhongsophon, 1997). The qualitative studies comprised\nthreephenomenologicalstudies(Duandaw,2004;Kitrungrote,\nWonghongkul, Chanprasit, Sutharangsee, & Cohen, 2008;\nPrechavittayakul, 2006), one ethnography and phenomeno-\nlogical study (Klungkong, 2009), one ethnographic perspec-\ntive study (Junda, 2004), and three qualitative studies in which\nthe researchers did not provide details of the study design\nConceptual Frameworks\nAll quantitative studies (15 studies) described the conceptual\nor theoretical frameworks that were used to guide the\nresearch. They were the transactional model of stress and\ncoping developed by Lazarus & Folkman in 1984 (seven\nstudies, 46.67%), Roy's adaptation model (two studies,\ncaregiver burden developed by Oberst in 1991 (one study,\n6.67%), caregiver burden of Zarit, Reever, and Bach-\nof stress coping (one study, 6.67%), and the model developed\nby the researchers (two studies, 13.33%).\nResearch Variables\nThe variables that were explored in the quantitative studies\nconsisted of social support (six studies, 40%), caregiver's\nMeecharoen et al. 3\ncaregiver burden (four studies, 26.67%), caregiver's needs\n(three studies, 20.0%), quality of life (QOL; three studies,\nence (one study, 6.67%), adaptation (one study, 6.67%), hope\ngiving behavior (one study, 6.67%), and family hardiness\nSampling Techniques and Caregiver's\nCharacteristics\nMost sampling techniques were purposive sampling (22\nstudies, 95.7%), and one was simple random sampling (one\nstudies, 4.3%). The data for the studies were gathered from\nseveral sources including tertiary/supertertiary hospitals (17\nstudies, 73.9%), cancer centers (two studies, 8.7%), home\n(three studies, 13.0%), and mixed-source (one study 4.3%).\nMost studies (14 studies, 60.9%) recruited the participants\nfrom the outpatient department. The number of study partici-\npants ranged from 30 to 270 caregivers in quantitative stud-\nies and 7 to 17 caregivers in qualitative studies.\nThe caregivers' characteristics varied among the studies.\nThe family caregivers ranged from 14 to 79 years of age, with\nand married (74.09%). In the 17 studies that reported the rela-\ntionship between family caregiver and cancer patients, most\ndren. The types of cancer patients who received care from\nfamily caregivers were breast cancer (two studies), head and\nneck cancer (two studies), mixed types (15 studies), or those\nthat did not specify the type (4 studies). Moreover, most stud-\nies (13 studies, 56.52%) focused on several stages of cancer\nincluding advanced stage. There were 9 studies that focused\non family caregivers for patients with advanced or terminal-\nstage cancer.\nResearch Findings\nThe quantitative studies reported various findings. For\nexample, some studies reported that the family caregivers\nhad moderate to high level of stress and had a fairly good\nUngwattansirikul, 2007). Studies indicated that the level of\ncaregiver burden, and caregiver needs perceived by family\ncaregivers were at a moderate level (Kasinpila, 2007;\nWannasiri, 2005). Family caregivers' problems and needs\ncomprised physical, psychological, financial, family, social,\nand knowledge (Maneewan, et al., 1994). Moreover, corre-\nlational studies indicated that there was the relationship\nbetween several factors and caregiving outcomes. For\nexample, caregiver's needs were positively related to care-\ndiness was negatively related to caregiver burden (Tamtup,\n2005), caregiver burden was negatively associated with\ncaregiver adaptation (Cheewapoonphon, 1998), and social\nsupport and coping were positively associated with care-\nDetails are provided in Table 1.\nIn the qualitative studies, the experiences of Thai family\ncaregivers varied. The research findings also revealed sev-\neral themes such as the following: the meaning of being\nfamily caregivers of cancer patients, the meaning of care,\nthe experiences of caregivers, and problems and needs of\nfamily caregivers in the Thai context. The theme pertaining\nto the meaning of being family caregivers of patients with\ncancer comprised four categories: (a) It was time to return\nfavors to the patients, (b) they could take better care of the\npatients than somebody else who was not a family member,\n(c) they displayed sympathy, understanding, and willingness\nto take care of the patients, and (d) it was their responsibility\n(Wiseso, 2002). The theme pertaining to meaning of care\ncomprised two categories: (a) to help patients in every mat-\nter to make them comfortable physically and mentally and\n(b) to help patients do what they could not do for themselves\n(Prechavittayakul, 2006). The theme about the caregiver's\nexperiences comprised six categories: (a) \"being committed\nfor life to spouses,\" (b) \"enhancing the spouse's comfort,\"\n(c) \"being a co-sufferer,\" (d) \"readjusting themselves,\" (e)\n\"appreciating people's support,\" (f) and \"being gratified\nwith self-development and marital life growth\" (Kitrungrote,\nDiscussion\nThis article is the first integrative review of family caregivers\nin Thailand. It is acknowledged that there may be several\nstudies that might have been missed because the current\ndatabase in Thailand falls short of inclusivity; most of the\nstudies were not published in any journals. Even though this\nreview included quantitative and qualitative studies, it is dif-\nficult to synthesize information and draw conclusions about\nthe state of knowledge of family caregivers for patients with\ncancer in Thai culture. Hence, characteristics of family care-\ngivers and related methodological issues will be discussed in\nthis section.\nCharacteristics of Family Caregivers\nIn the Thai context, a family caregiver was defined as a fam-\nily member who has blood relations with patients (i.e.,\nfather, mother, sister, bother, son, daughter, nephew, or\nniece) or a legal relationship (i.e., husband, wife, daughter\nin law, son in law, or mother in law), who lives in the same\nhouse with a loved one with cancer, and who provides\nunpaid care for a cancer patient (Chansirimongkol, 2007;\nnition was consistent with the traditional definitions of\nTable 1.

If patients died,\nthe caregivers would accept it. This reflected\nthat caregivers' wills were determined by\nreligious study of Islam. Their will to conduct\ntheir duties came from spiritual strength\nbased on religious study.\n8 SAGE Open\nfamily that includes a nuclear family comprising father,\nmother, and one or more children, or the extended family\ncomprising grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins (Blum,\n2010).Although the National Family CaregiversAssociation\n(2010) stated that defining the meaning of family caregivers\nwas complicated and varied according to the people who\ndefined it, the Thai definition of family caregiver seemed\nsimilar to its meaning in the Western perspective. However,\naccording to the definition in the Thai context, a family\ncaregiver usually referred to a person in an extended family,\nand the Western family caregiver was often referred to as a\nperson in a nuclear family. The extended family scenario\nmight have advantages for Thai patients with cancer because\nthey will have several personal resources that can help them\nto deal with their cancer effectively. In both cultures, the\nfamily caregiver was usually a wife, mother, grandmother,\nor other female family member because caregiving was\nviewed as a feminine activity or quality (Blum, 2010). So, it\nis not surprising that this review found that most of family\ncaregivers were female.\nMethodological Issues\nMethodological issues that were discussed in this section\nincluded the study's theoretical framework, samples issues,\nand instrument issues.\nAll Thai studies in the review were developed by master's\nor doctoral students and the nursing faculty from several uni-\nversities. Moreover, the researchers used the conceptual or\ntheoretical framework to guide their research. Therefore, it is\nbelieved that all studies that were included in this review\nwere developed by using rigorous scientific methodology.\nTheoretical framework.The stress and coping model devel-\noped by Lazarus & Folkman (1984) was the most popular\ntheory that was used to guide the research. If we compare the\nstudies in Thailand to studies in Western countries, it can be\nseen that Thai studies were consistent with the second gen-\neration of cancer caregiver studies in Western countries,\nstudies that focused on the seriousness or magnitude of stress\nthat cancer caused in their caregivers (Lewis, 2009). The\nstudies in this generation used the stress-adaptation-coping\nmodel as a guide. Although the Thai studies used models that\nwere developed in Western contexts, the research findings\nrevealed that those models fit with the data in the Thai con-\ntext. But increased model testing needs to be done in Thai-\nland in any case.\nSample issues.There was limited access to the participants\nwho were family caregivers for cancer patients in Thailand\nbecause there is no adequate database concerning said cancer\ncaregivers. Most participants (97.1%) in the studies were\nrecruited by purposive sampling from outpatient department\nin the tertiary hospitals. There were only 47 caregivers who\nwere recruited from home-based settings. Most quantitative\nstudies (60%) had small sample sizes (< 100 samples). As a\nresult, the current research findings cannot be generalized to\nthe cancer caregiver population as a whole. If researchers\nwant to increase their understanding about caregiver's expe-\nriences and outcomes, they need to increase recruitment of\nmore participants in community or home-based settings.\nThis should help refine the database for future studies.\nInstrument issues.Evidence suggests that most instruments\nfor data collection in the Thai studies were borrowed from\nWestern cultures. Examples of the instruments that were\ntranslated into Thai language were the Zarit Burden Inter-\nview (ZBI) developed by Zarit, Reever, and Bach-Peterson\n(1980); the family hardiness index (FHI) developed by\nMcCubbin Thompson, and McCubbin (1996); the Jalowiec\nCoping Scale (JCS) developed by Jalowiec (1988); and the\nsocial support questionnaire (SSQ) developed by Schaefer et\nal. (1981). Although these instruments were developed in\nWestern contexts, they continued to have high reliability\nwhen used in Thai culture. However, researchers still need to\nassess these carefully when they use the translated question-\nnaires because the characteristics of Thai caregivers may be\ndifferent from Western caregivers. In the Thai context, reli-\ngion, belief, culture, and traditional ways of life played major\nroles in the caring for family members. The caregiving for\npatients who were their spouses or parents was a way to\nshow appreciation. Taking care of a family member is an\naffective reward and a strong norm of familial obligation in\ndhist caregivers especially believed that caring was a way to\nreimburse for past good deeds, to gain merit, and to return\ngratitude to their relatives. The caregiving role was perceived\nas an integral part of a Thai's life, an unavoidable task that\nwas provided with love, sympathy, and attachment (Subgra-\nnon & Lund, 2000). Conversely, Western people are nor-\nmally more independent from family ties than people in\nAsian countries. When Westerners assume roles as primary\ncaregivers, they may experience more suffering because they\nare less likely to be familiar with such new roles. Therefore,\nimpacts of cancer caregiving may differ widely between\nThais and those adhering to Western caregivers'\nperceptions.\nConclusion and Recommendations\nThe number of cancer caregivers should increase continuously\nin the near future. Evidence from the 23 studies reviewed\nshowed that the state of knowledge concerning cancer care-\ngivers in the Thai context is in an embryonic state compared\nwith the state of knowledge in Western countries. The research\nfindings revealed that providing care for cancer patients has\nvarious impacts on caregivers. Several concepts related to\ncaregiver outcomes (i.e., caregiver burden, caregiver's QOL,\ncoping, and social support) need to be examined more closely.\nThere are some possible limitations of the present review.\nMeecharoen et al. 9\nFirst, there may be a number of studies that might have been\nmissed because of the inadequacy of the database in Thailand;\nmost of the studies cited were not published in any journals.\nSecond, all of the studies were developed by nursing scien-\ntists. So the state of knowledge may be not broad in scope.\nThird, all studies in this review were developed by nursing\neducators rather than by nurses in a clinical setting. The pres-\nent study may not fully reflect the phenomena of caregiving\nfrom the clinical perspective. Future research needs to further\nexplore the concepts related to negative and positive outcomes\nof caregiving. More studies are needed with focus on sample\nsizes, and which include sensitivity to measurements specific\nto Thai culture. Expanding the understanding of caregiving's\nimpact and related factors in cancer caregiver populations\nwould enable nurses to develop innovative interventions to\ndecrease negative outcomes and improve positive outcomes of\ncaregiving for cancer patients.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAntonovsky, A.
