These sub-\nsyndromal depressive symptoms, often\nreferred to as \"depressed mood,\" are as-\nsociated with high societal costs due to\nincreased morbidity and high utilization\nof health services.1-5 From the perspec-\ntive of older persons themselves, de-\npressed mood significantly affects their\nwell-being and ability to function.67\nPhysical disability among depressed\npersons not only is significantly higher\nthan among nondepressed persons, but\nalso is similar or even greater than the\ndisability found among patients with\nchronic medical illnesses.8\nThe relationship between depression\nandphysicalfunctioningisacomplexone\nwhose specific causal ordering is hard to\nunravel. Researchers so far have mainly\nfocusedonself-reportedmeasuresofdis-\nabilityandfoundthatthecross-sectional\nassociation between depressed mood\nand disability seems to hold longitudi-\nnally.1,6,7 Even in longitudinal studies,\nhowever,itisdifficulttoexcludethepos-\nsibility that disability is a cause rather\nthan a consequence of depressive symp-\ntoms. Further, the interpretation is\nhampered by the possibility that de-\npressed persons may give overly pessi-\nmisticappraisalsoftheirfunctioningand\ndisability.9 Even when their functional\nstatus remains the same, persons who\nare depressed tend to become more de-\npressed over time and, therefore, may\nreport more physical disabilities.10,11 Fi-\nnally, disability measures assess the\npoorer end of the spectrum of physical\nfunctioning but have less ability to dis-\ntinguish higher levels of physical abili-\nties. Consequently, whether depression\naffects physical function along its full\nspectrum remains to be examined.\n\u00a91998 American Medical Association.

Since it is unknown\nwhether the effect of depressive symp-\ntoms is limited to high symptom levels or\nwhether it increases linearly with in-\ncreasing symptom levels, a continuous\nmeasure of depressive symptoms as well\nas a dichotomous classification of de-\npressed mood are used.

The results were simi-\nlar when the analyses were restricted to\nsubjects without physical disability.\nThus, in older persons at the high end of\nthe functional spectrum, depressive\nsymptoms were also predictive of sub-\nsequentdeclineinphysicalperformance.\nOur results are compatible with find-\nings by others that depressive symp-\ntoms were associated with subsequent\nself-reportedphysicaldisability.1,6,7 How-\never, by using a battery of physical\nperformance tests that covers the entire\nspectrumofphysicalfunctioning,wedem-\nonstrate that the effect of depressive\nsymptoms is not limited to physical dis-\nability,butthatdepressivesymptomsalso\npredict physical decline outside the dis-\nabled range. Since performance-based\nmeasures have been shown to be less bi-\nased by mood, cognition, and personality\naspectsthanbyself-reportsofphysicaldis-\nability,10,11 our findings provide addi-\ntional,morecompellingevidenceforalink\nbetween depressive symptoms and sub-\nsequent physical decline. Our results\ncomplement another set of population-\nbased research data indicating that poor\nphysicalfunctionisariskfactorfortheon-\nbodies of research suggest that depres-\nsion and poor physical function are mu-\ntually reinforcing, causing a progressive\ndownward spiral in the physical and psy-\nchological health of older persons.\nResearchers have hypothesized both\nbiologically mediated pathways and psy-\nchological mechanisms for a link be-\ntween depressive symptoms and physi-\ncal function. Animal and human studies\nfound that psychological distress causes\nneural, hormonal, and immunological al-\nterations. By increasing the sympa-\nthetic tone, decreasing vagal tone, and\ncausing immunosuppression, depressed\nmood may enhance susceptibility to dis-\nease and result in decreased physical\nhealth in general.35-37 Also, persistent so-\nmatic symptoms of depression, such as\nfatigue or sleeplessness, may worsen the\nhealth status over time. Via psychologi-\ncalmechanisms,depressedmoodmayim-\npede recovery processes by discourag-\ning persons from obtaining adequate\nmedical attention and rehabilitation; fol-\nlowing treatment regimens; or engag-\ning in healthy lifestyles, such as exercis-\ning, not smoking, and maintaining\nhealthful eating habits. Data collected in\nvided some evidence for physical activ-\nity as one of the mechanisms in the link\nbetween depression and physical de-\ncline: depressive symptoms were signifi-\ncantly associated with less engagement\nin walking, gardening, and vigorous ex-\nercise activities during the last month.\nFuture studies should further examine\nto what extent reduced engagement in\nphysical activities explains the greater\nphysical decline in older depressed per-\nsons.Furthermore,depressionmaylimit\ncognitive capacities and may cause a ten-\ndencytoamplifyphysicalsymptomssuch\nas fatigue and pain.38 This psychological\nconductmayunderminetheeffortneeded\nto maintain physical function over time.\nSome alternative explanations should\nbe given as well. Depressive symptoms\nmay represent an adjustment reaction to\nsubclinical symptoms or disease that, in\nthemselves, would place subjects at\ngreater risk for subsequent physical de-\ncline. In addition, performance measures\nreflect not only what a person is physi-\ncallycapableofdoingbutalsowhataper-\nson is willing or motivated to do. How-\never,sinceweusedlongitudinaldatawith\nadjustment for level of performance at\nthe time that depression was measured,\nit is not likely that our findings are ex-\nplained by a reduced motivation to per-\nform among the depressed subjects. Fi-\nnally,thedepressionandphysicaldecline\nlink may be due to a third factor (such as\norganicbraindysfunctions)thatisrelated\nto both conditions.\nPhysical function is an integral com-\nponent of achieving and maintaining\nindependence in ADL and a major con-\ntributor to the overall health status of\nelders. Lower levels of physical perfor-\nmance strongly predict institutionaliza-\ntion, death, and subsequent disability.\nIn line with others,24,39 our findings sug-\ngest that physical decline reflects mul-\ntiplefactors,includingolderage,disease\nstatus, and psychosocial factors. In\ncontrast to most other significant pre-\ndictors, depression is a potentially modi-\nfiable and preventable condition. There-\nfore, prevention and treatment of\ndepressive symptoms may be one of the\nmost effective targets for interventions\naimed at reducing physical decline and\nincreasing the number of years during\nwhich older people are free of disability.\nAlthough such interventions might be\nmore feasible and cost-effective if lim-\nited to the most depressed persons, our\nfindings suggest that there may not be a\nneed to limit these efforts strictly to\nthose who meet certain criteria for de-\npressive disorders. The risk association\nbetween depressive symptoms and\nphysical decline seems to represent a\ncontinuum along the entire spectrum of\nphysical function. Even outside the dis-\nabled range, a higher level of depressive\nsymptoms increases the risk for subse-\nquent decline in physical performance.\nAs opposed to major depression de-\nfined by DSM-IV criteria, depressed\nmood is very common in the older gen-\neralpopulation,affectingmorethan10%\nin our cohort.

Although\nmore appropriate care for depressed\nmood,consistingofincreasedcounseling\nand use of appropriate antidepressant\nmedications, has been shown to be cost-\neffective in terms of commensurate im-\nprovements in older persons' health and\nwell-being per dollar spent,42 few formal\nclinical trials have been conducted. Our\ndatasuggestthatsuchtrialsmaybeuse-\nful to see whether treatment of de-\npressed mood may prevent the process\nwhereby depressive symptoms and\nphysical dysfunctions interact to cause a\nprogressive downward spiral in the\nhealth status of older persons.\nThis study was supported by contracts N01-AG-\nNational Institute on Aging.
