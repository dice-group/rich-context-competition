NEISS-AIP is operated by the US\nConsumer Product Safety Commission\nin collaboration with the National\nCenter for Injury Prevention and\nControl, Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention.34 A NEISS-trained re-\nsearcher at each institution is respon-\nsible for reviewing the chart and\nentering data related to each injury\nvisit, including the patient's age,\ngender, race, and ethnicity; the date of\nthe injury; the location where the injury\noccurred in the community; the body\npart to which the injury occurred; the\nintent and perpetrator (if intentional);\nthe patient's diagnosis and disposition;\nand a detailed account of the injury\nevent as gleaned from the medical\nrecords.

Visits by patients between the\nARTICLE\nages of 5 and 19 years were included in\nthe analysis.

Patients of black and American\nIndian race and of Hispanic ethnicity\nwere also found to have higher risk of\nintentional injury\u00adrelated EDVs in both\nsettings when compared with un-\nintentional injuries (Table 3).\nFor intentional injury\u00adrelated EDVs\nfrom the school setting (Table 4), vari-\nous demographic risk factors were\nidentified as follows: 10- to 14-year and\nAmerican Indian race, and Hispanic\nsettings (Table 4), girls were less likely\nto have an intentional injury\u00adrelated\nEDV compared with boys in the school\nsetting but were more likely than boys\nto have an intentional injury\u00adrelated\nEDV in the outside-school setting. The\nrisk of an intentional injury\u00adrelated\nEDV was found to be lower for the 15- to\n19-year age group in the school setting\nwhen compared with the outside\nschool setting. Black race and Hispanic\nethnicity were both found to confer\nhigher risks for the school setting when\ncompared with the outside-school set-\nting (Table 4).\nAdescriptionoftheEDVsispresentedin\nTable 5 for the 2 settings. Fractures\nwere identified more often in the school\nsetting, whereas lacerations were\nidentified more often in the outside-\nschool setting. The proportion of inju-\nries due to traumatic brain injury was\nhigher in the school setting compared\nwith the outside-school setting. Poi-\nsoning was identified as 1 of the top 5\ndiagnoses for the outside-school set-\nting. Conversely, strain/sprain was\ncommon in the school setting but\ncomparatively not as common outside\nof school. The proportion of EDVs due to\nassault as an immediate cause was\nhigher in the school setting, and those\ndue to self (intentional self-harm) or\nlegal intervention were more common\nin the outside-school setting.\nWith regard to disposition, the overall\nrisk of hospitalization (hospitalized/\ntransferred/observed) in all settings was\ntentional injury\u00adrelated EDV compared\nwith an unintentional injury\u00adrelated\nEDV. The likelihood of hospitalization\nafter an intentional injury\u00adrelated\nEDV (versus an unintentional injury\u00ad\nrelated EDV) was lower for the school\nwhen compared with outside the school\n(Table 3).\nDISCUSSION\nDespite increased emphasis on safety\nat school and evidence of a decreasing\ntrend, children aged 5 to 19 years still\nexperienced a substantial number of\nintentional injuries at school over the\ntime period studied.

This gender difference\nis interesting, especially because pre-\nvious studies have identified male\ngender to be a risk factor for injuries in\nresearch is needed to understand why\nthis disparity exists.\nAnother important finding from this\nstudy is that middle school\u00adaged chil-\na significant burden of intentional\ninjury\u00adrelated EDVs in the school set-\nting. This is in contrast to the out-of-\nschool setting where high school\u00adaged\nstudents (15- to 19-year-old group) were\nfound to have the highest burden. This\ndistribution persisted through the\nstudy time period and was consistent\nwith our earlier study.5\nPrevious studies have documented that\nAfrican American race and Hispanic\nethnicity are associated with increased\nlikelihood of bullying and its associated\nOur study also suggests that racial dis-\nparity persists for the risk of intentional\ninjury\u00adrelated EDVs. In addition to stu-\ndents of black race and Hispanic eth-\nnicity, American Indian youth were found\nto be high risk. Interestingly, these de-\nmographic risks are much higher in the\nschool settingcomparedwiththeoutside-\nschool setting. This finding suggests the\nneed for developing interventions that\nmeet the needs of these populations.\nOf note, there is no information in\nNEISS-AIP regarding the racial and\nethnic background of perpetrators or\nof the overall racial/ethnic composition\nof the school where an injury occurred,\nthus limiting understanding of the ra-\ncial disparity phenomenon.\nTABLE 3 Univariate Logistic Models for Intentional Injury\u00adRelated EDVs Compared With\nUnintentional Injury\u00adRelated EDVs for Inside- and Outside-School Settings\nVariable Inside-School Setting Outside-School Setting\nAge\nGender\nRace\nEthnicity\nNon-Hispanic 1.0 (reference) 1.0 (reference)\nTop 5 diagnosis\nContusion/abrasion 1.0 (reference) 1.0 (reference)\nDisposition\nDischarged 1.0 (reference) 1.0 (reference)\nTABLE 4 Separate Multivariable Logistic Models for Predictors of Intentional Injury\u00adRelated EDVs\nCompared With Unintentional Injury\u00adRelated EDVs in the 2 Settings\nVariable Inside-School Settinga Outside-School Settingb\nAge\nGender\nRace\nEthnicity\nNon-Hispanic 1.0 (reference) 1.0 (reference)\nMultivariable logistic models adjusted for age, gender, race and ethnicity.\nWhen considering the types of injuries\nsustained due to intentional mecha-\nnisms, it is important to note that the\nrisk of sustaining traumatic brain\ninjuries was similar to that of sus-\ntainingabrasions/contusions.Thehead\nand neck region was also found to be\nthe most common body region affected,\nfollowed by the upper extremities. This\nfinding is in contrast to earlier studies\nthat documented upper extremity to be\nthe most frequently affected body part\nin all school injuries.4,7 Possibly related\nto this phenomenon, most of the in-\ntentional injuries in our study sample\nwere reported to be to the result of\nassault, and 90% reported the per-\npetrator to be either a friend or an\nacquaintance in the school setting.\nOther studies have shown that a bul-\nlied victim frequently knew the bully\nand that the incident usually involved\na past disagreement.28 When consid-\nering the perpetrators, it is notable\nthat 10% of the EDVs were reportedly\ndue to multiple perpetrators in the\nschool setting. Intentional injuries and\nviolence have immense mental health\neffects on the victims, and studies have\nreported that victims may be involved\nwith future violence, either as victims\nor as perpetrators.21,22 With the knowl-\nedge that intentional injuries continue\nto be a significant problem in the school\nsetting, and in light of the limited in-\nformation that these data offer re-\ngarding perpetrators, it is clear that\nmore work needs to be done to un-\nderstand the victim-bully relationship to\ndesign preventive efforts.\nThe risk of hospitalization in our study\nwas found to be higher for intentional\nversus unintentional injury\u00adrelated\nEDVs in either setting. If being hospi-\ntalized is a proxy for sustaining a seri-\nous injury, these data document that\nchildren sustained more serious inju-\nries resulting in hospitalization when\nthe injury was intentionally inflicted\ncompared with unintentional injuries.\nThis finding further emphasizes the\nimportance of the problem and need\nfor preventive efforts.\nThis study was limited in terms of its\nability to completely capture the full\nrange of injuries suffered by children,\nboth in and out of the school environ-\nment. Because the NEISS-AIP data\nsource is predicated on the injury\nresulting in an EDV, it does not include\npatients who were directly admitted to\na hospital. This limitation also points\ntoward the inherent selection bias de-\npendent on the sampling design and\na caregiver's decision to seek medical\ncare in the ED. For example, studies\nhave shown that there may be over-\nreferral to the ED from school after an\ninjury.9 Additionally, care may have\nbeen sought at a primary care office,\nurgent care center, or other medical\nprovider, and those visits would not\nhave been captured here. Another\nlimitation is the data's wide CIs that\nTABLE 5 Characteristics of EDVs Related to Intentional Injury in the School and Outside-School\nSettings\nVariable School Setting,\nOutside-School\nTop 5 diagnosis\nPrimary body part affected\nIntent\nPerpetrator\nTop 5 immediate cause of injury\nDisposition\na National estimates ,20 actual cases or 1200 estimated cases may not be statistically stable.\nARTICLE\nresult from national estimates that\nare based on a restricted sample of\n66 hospitals. It is also important to note\nthat NEISS data do not code for the\nacuity of a visit and do not report data\non fatalities in the school setting, which\nmay limit understanding of the most\nserious injuries.\nAlthough the NEISS-AIP database col-\nlects information on a wide range of\npatients, it lacks the granularity that\nwould be necessary to more fully an-\nswer questions one might have about\nan individual injury. This, in turn,\nmakes it difficult to ascertain the\nspecific circumstances under which\neach of the injuries occurred. A\nplethora of characteristics related to\nthe school environment, including the\nphysical environment and location of\na school, supervision provided while in\nthe school environment, demographic\ncharacteristics of perpetrators, and\nmany others, all may have an effect on\nthe occurrence of an individual in-\ntentional injury. Precise detail about\nthe intentional injury event can assist\nin developing preventive strategies\nespecially related to using the princi-\nples of the Haddon Matrix.37\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere are substantial numbers of in-\ntentional injury\u00adrelated EDVs from\nthe school setting. Our study identi-\nfies age, gender, and racial and ethnic\ndisparities associated with school-\nbased intentional injuries, empha-\nsizing the need for the development\nof culturally appropriate preventive\nstrategies.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Epidemiologic approaches to\nFANTASY FOOTBALL: I was recently emailing with one of my advisees when she\nconfessed that she was feeling stressed. As she is a fourth year medical student\npreparing to interview for a highly competitive residency position, I offered some\nwords of wisdom on the application process and the strength of her application.\nShe responded that her stress was not because of her upcoming interviews but\nbecause it was draft night for her fantasy football league.\nFantasy football is a game in which fans create imaginary teams selected from\nplayers in the National Football League. Fans score points and compete against\neach other based on the statistical performance of their selected players. This\ncreates intense interest in games across the nation. It turns out that fantasy\nfootball is incredibly popular \u00ad so popular that even football stadiums have to\naccount for a fan's desire to keep track of his or her players.\nAs reported in The New York Times (Sports: September 14, 2013), the days when\nfans could only see their local football team play by attending a game in person\nare long gone. With high-definition TV, high-speed internet connections, and round\nthe clock programming, fans can see almost any game any time and track how\nwell their local and fantasy teams are doing from the comfort of home. Recog-\nnizing the popularity of fantasy football, stadiums are now being outfitted with\nlounges packed with TV screens showing all the games being played, high-speed\ninternet connections, comfortable chairs, air conditioning, and easy access to\nfood and drink. Fans dispirited by the play of the home team can wander into the\nlounge and root for their fantasy football players. Lounges in some stadiums are\nso popular that bouncers are employed to control access and crowding.\nWhile it seems a bit odd to purchase a ticket essentially to spend the afternoon in\nasports bar,theteams are tryingtobattleflaggingattendanceand createagreat\ngame-day experience. As for my advisee, she does not attend the games in person,\npreferring to keep track of the New England Patriots and her fantasy team by\nsmartphone. And, she told me that she had a very successful draft.\nNoted by WVR, MD\nARTICLE"
