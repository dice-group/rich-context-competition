    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe research was a partial replication of Devah Pager's study of the effect of a criminal record on employment opportunities\nin the Milwaukee, Wisconsin labor market. A quantitative and qualitative method was utilized to examine the effects of a\ncriminal record, race, and the relationship between employers' willingness to hire ex-offenders and their actual hiring of ex-\noffenders. An experimental audit was conducted by two testers (one Black male and one White male) to audit 30 employers.\nThe results supported Pager's findings. There was a dramatic negative effect for the Black male tester. Three themes emerged\nfrom the testers' diaries and debriefings: (a) the application process was influenced in the favor of the White male by a\n\"gatekeeper,\" (b) racism was evident, and (c) an emotional effect was noted on both testers. Finally, during a telephone\nsurvey of the same employers, they indicated a willingness to hire both ex-offenders regardless of their race, yet the audit\nrevealed the opposite.\n",

Harrison and Karberg (2004) of the U.S. Bureau\nof Justice Statistics examined the United States prisons and\njails population at midyear 2003. The United States ended\nthe decade of the 1990s with more people behind bars than\nthe increase in the number of people in our jails and prisons\nunparalleled any other in our nation's history. Harrison and\nIt was also reported that African Americans comprised 47%\nof the United States jail and prison populations, yet only 13%\nof the nation's population.\nCarson and Sabol (2012) of the Bureau of Justice Statistics\nsubmitted an analysis of the corrections population in a\nreport called \"Prisoners in 2011.\" Their analysis revealed\nthat the state and federal prison populations had declined\nyear in a row that the prison population had declined.\nAccording to Carson and Sabol, their analysis also revealed\nthat during the same period African American and Hispanic\nmales and females were incarcerated at a higher rate than\nWhites in all age groups.\nThe problem was discussed in a special report from the\nBureau of Justice Statistics titled \"Prevalence of\nmore than 5.6 millionAmericans had served time in prison or\nwere currently in prison. The report provided updated esti-\nmates of the lifetime chances of going to prison using stan-\ndard demographic life table techniques that projected the\nlikelihood of incarceration for someone born in 2001. The\nprevalence report revealed that if the rates of first incarcera-\ntion remained the same, 6.6% of all persons born in the\nUnited States in 2001 will go to State or Federal prison dur-\ning their lifetime. More specifically, Bonczar claimed that\nbased on his calculation of the prevalence of imprisonment\nin the United States, roughly 1 in 3 Black males born in the\nUnited States in 2001 are expected to go to prison in their\nlifetime compared to 1 in 17 White males.\nCox (2010) examined crime, incarceration, and employ-\nment in the context of economic choice theory.

According to Alexander, the \"War on Drugs\" has led\nto close to one-half of young African American men being\nincarcerated in our jails and prisons or labeled felons for life.\nAlso, the felony disenfranchisement laws deny them the\nright to vote and serve on juries, and legally discriminated\nagainst in employment, education, and housing.\nThe literature has examined the effects of a criminal his-\ntory on employment and future earnings (Allgood, Mustard,\nRaphael, and Stoll (2003) argued that arrests and imprison-\nments are associated with lower employment and earnings,\nsuggesting that lower employment and earnings for ex-\noffenders were about 10% to 30% lower than for comparable\nindividuals with no criminal record. In his study of employ-\ners' demand for ex-offenders in Los Angeles, it was reported\nthat 80% of employers' surveyed indicated they would not\nhire or accept an application from an ex-offender. Employers'\nwillingness to hire ex-offenders is limited, therefore attribut-\ning to the higher rate of recidivism among individuals with a\ncriminal history. The proposed research will further examine\nthe effect of a criminal record on employment opportunities\nwith regard to differences between Black and White male\nsubjects.\nBackground of the Study\nused field experiments to study discrimination against minori-\nties and ex-offenders in the low-wage labor market. Holzer\n(2003) examined an employer's reported willingness to hire\nan ex-offender and their actual hiring of ex-offenders. The\nsubjects in Holzer's research were 619 employers in Los\nAngeles. A 20-minute telephone survey was used to collect\nthe data. The main variable in the research included indicators\nthat reflect an employers' reported willingness to hire ex-\noffenders and their actual hiring practices. More than 40% of\nthe employers suggested they would \"probably not\" or \"defi-\nnitely not\" be willing to hire someone with a criminal record.\nThirty-five percent of the respondents indicated that their\nresponse would depend on the crime.\nA major policy concern of Holzer's (2003) research was\nemployers' reluctance to hire ex-offenders. Research has\nshown the notable praise we hear about the progress made in\nracial equality is not consistent with actual experiences of\nand Pager & Quillian (2005) identified similar findings as\nthey studied the effects of a criminal record on job searches\nby ex-convicts in Milwaukee and New York City. Pager used\nan experimental audit design and a survey to compare\nemployers' reported willingness to hire ex-offenders and\ntheir actual hiring practices. The studies conducted in\nMilwaukee and the New York City job markets used matched\npairs of testers to apply for entry-level positions. Moreover,\nthe effect of race in the findings was significant. Only 14%\nof Blacks with a criminal record received call backs com-\npared with 34% of White non-criminals (p < .01). Also,\nWhites with criminal records received more favorable treat-\nment than Blacks without criminal records (14%).\nthe employers'willingness to hire matched their actual hiring\npractices. Employers were surveyed after the testers had\napplied for entry-level positions.\nDuring this second phase of Pagers' study, the same\nemployers were given an opportunity to respond to a tele-\nphone survey on their hiring process (Pager, 2003; Pager &\ncases, employers were unwilling to consider equally quali-\nfied applicants on the basis of their criminal record.\nPager and Quillian (2005) found employers that were\nadministered the survey indicated a greater willingness to\nhire ex-offenders than was evident during the audit.\nResponses obtained in the survey reports did not accurately\nreflect the actual behavior of an employer (Pager, 2003;\nStatement of the Problem\nThe door is locked against a prisoner and he goes to live in a\nhidden world. If you were to enter that world you should be\nstartled by what you see. In the United States today we have\n2.1 million people behind bars. . . . Forty percent of the prisoners\nnationwide are African Americans. . . . Out of sight out of mind\nis not acceptable for any part of our justice system. (Supreme\nMauer (1995) examined the status of African Americans\nmales within the criminal justice system. He reported that\none in three Black men between the ages of 20 and 29 were\nunder some form of criminal justice control in 1995.\nMauer (2013) reported that the rate of incarceration of\nAfrican American males declined by 9.8%. A decade of mass\nincarceration of African Americans has declined from the\noverall rate of incarceration. According to Mauer, the ratio of\nBlack/Hispanic to White is 6.4:1. It can be concluded that the\ndecline in the United States prison population had a marginal\neffect on the rate of African Americans incarcerated com-\npared with Whites.\nOther studies reported similar, disturbing findings of\nAfrican Americans being under control of the criminal jus-\ntice system. For instance, Beck and Mumola (1999) argued\nimprisoned at some point in his life, compared with 4% for a\nWhite male. They argued, similar to others, that African\nAmericans comprised 13% of the nation's population, yet\nwere imprisoned at 6.6 times the rate of Whites. In November\ntics reported that 6.98 million offenders were under the con-\ntrol of the criminal justice system.\nMethod\nResearch Site\nThe research site was Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The timeline\nfor collecting and analyzing the data from the three samples\nThe 2005 census American Community Survey indicated\nAmerican and that the Milwaukee African American popula-\ntion had become the city's largest ethnic group.\nThe 2010 United States Census (Census) reported that the\ncity of Milwaukee was 39.2% African American, 3.5%\nAsian, 17.3% Hispanic, and 37% White. The Census reported\nthat the city of Milwaukee experienced a .4% population\nDescription of Sample: Experimental Audit Sites\nand Participants\nThe job sites underwent two randomizations. The first came\nfrom the initial random selection from the Milwaukee Journal\nSentinel and JobNet. The second randomization placed them\ninto the Criminal Record (CR) and No Criminal Record\n(NCR) categories. This allowed each tester the opportunity\nto frequent the same number of job sites. Plus, each tester\nvisited the same job site and both applied based on whether\nthe employer is randomized as CR or NCR. This allowed for\nboth the Black and White tester to visit the same job site\nunder the same experimental conditions (CR or NCR).\nThe goal was an equal number of trials for each tester. The\ntesters applied for 30 entry-level job openings. Fifteen were\nCR and fifteen were NCR job sites. The dependent variable\nis the number of call backs from the employer after receiving\nthe application. Also, an interview or a job offer is counted as\na positive contact.An average of 10 audits (5 CR and 5 NCR)\noccurred a week. The rest of the week the testers called the\nresearcher by telephone to schedule their start.\nEach tester received individual training on how to respond\nto questions about a CR or NCR. The assigned criminal his-\ntory of both testers was the same. The assigned criminal his-\ntory was a conviction for possession of cocaine. Each tester\nused a script to recite or write if they were questioned about\nor had to give an explanation of their criminal record. The\nBlack male tester wrote or stated the following:\nI was stopped by the police for a traffic violation. I ran a red\nlight. I was patted down after the traffic stop and the officer\nfound a small amount of cocaine in my pocket. I went to court\nand pled guilty. The Judge told me that I had too good of a record\nand education to be doing something so foolish. He informed me\nthat he was giving me six months in the House of Correction to\nteach me a lesson.\nThe White male tester received the following script if\nasked or required to give an explanation of his criminal\nhistory:\nI was at a party at a friend's apartment. The party got loud and\nthe police was called. I was patted down by an officer and a\nsmall amount of cocaine was found in my pocket. I was arrested\nand went to court where I pled guilty. The judge informed me\nthat he was going to teach me a lesson to keep me from making\na similar mistake in the future. He sentenced me to 6 months at\nthe House of Correction.\nThe Audit Process\nThe audit consisted of the testers reporting to one of the ran-\ndomly selected employers on their assigned list. If the job\nsite is a CR job site, the testers indicated on the application,\nif required, an arrest for possession of cocaine. If required,\nthe testers included in the application the script regarding the\ncircumstances of the arrest and the disposition. The testers\ndid the same for any interview. If the audit site is designated\nan NCR job site, the testers completed the application and\nindicated, if required, no arrest or conviction history.\nEach tester had a separate voice mail box to use on the\nemployment application. A call back to the voice mail box by\nan employer was counted as a positive response. Also, if the\ntester was interviewed or offered a job on-site this was con-\nsidered a positive response.\nApproach of the Study\nThe purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of\na criminal history and race on the willingness to hire ex-\noffenders. Pager (2003) suggested the use of the survey as\na measuring tool of employment discrimination may not\nyield an accurate reflection of employers' hiring process.\nPager argued that the employers surveyed may answer\nwith the \"political correct\" response about their hiring\nprocess, which may conflict with actual practices. The\ncurrent study will compare the employers expressing a\nwillingness to hire ex-offenders and their actual hiring of\nex-offenders.\nThe following research questions guided the study:\nResearch Question 1: What are the effects of a criminal\nrecord in accessing employment opportunities?\nResearch Question 2: What is the impact of race in\naccessing employment opportunities?\nResearch Question 3: To what extent does a discrepancy\nexist between employers'expressed willingness to hire an\nex-offender and their actual hiring practices?\n4 SAGE Open\nThe current study focused on the efforts of Black and\nWhite ex-offenders to obtain employment in the city of\nMilwaukee. The study used an experimental model to assess\nthe effects of a criminal record on employment. In addition,\nit examined the use of a survey as a measurement tool for\ndiscrimination.\nThe research consisted of three phases (an experimental\naudit, a diary, and a telephone survey). The first phase\ninvolved an experimental audit that included one Black and\none White male tester who applied for real entry-level jobs.\nThe testers were assigned to randomly selected employers\nassigned a Criminal Record and No Criminal Record.\nMoreover, in the second phase, the testers maintained a diary\nof their experiences during the application process that was\nanalyzed using the constant comparative method (Creswell,\nThe third phase was a telephone survey administered to\nthe same employers that were audited. The survey provided\nemployers an opportunity to reveal their hiring processes. A\ncomparison was made of the employers' hiring practices\n(experimental audit) and their expression of a willingness to\nhire ex-offenders (survey).\nVeenman (2010) examined research methods that studied\nlabor market discrimination that used statistical analyses,\nbehavioral research, ethnographic observations, and attitude\nresearch. Veenman suggested that no one method was supe-\nrior to the other, and found strength and limitations of each\nmethod. Based on these findings, Veenman argued that\nexaminations of labor market discrimination should employ\nmultiple methods to support the reliability of the results. For\nexample, Veenman suggested using a combination of statis-\ntical analyses of observational data and paired testing to\nstudy the prevalence of discrimination and its impact on the\nlabor market.\nExperimental audits of employers hiring practices simu-\nlate that part of the process in the real world. The audits\nallowed for an examination of practices as they occur in the\nlabor market, as testers pose as applicants for real positions.\nA test for discriminatory or illegal practices in housing dis-\ncrimination was conducted by the United States Department\nof Housing and Urban Development (HUD; Turner & Ross,\n2003). Turner and Ross maintain testers were matched based\non similar characteristics such as race, age, physical appear-\nance, and self-presentation. They were assigned similar char-\nacteristics of education and work experience to apply for\nrental units.\nBoth visited a real estate or rental agent, made the same\nrequests, and provided the same personal information. Each\ntester systematically and carefully recorded the information\nand assistance he or she received from the agent. If the\nminority and White testers were treated differently in impor-\ntant ways, the test provides direct and powerful evidence of\ndifferences in the kinds of treatment that can be expected\nwhen they search for housing. The current research used a\nsimilar model to examine employment hiring practices in\nMilwaukee.\nResearch Rationale--Experimental Audit\nBertrand and Mullainathan (2003) concurred with Pager\ngested that surveys do not contain all the characteristics that\nemployers observe when hiring, promoting, or setting wages.\nBertrand and Mullainathan maintained that audit studies pro-\nvided some of the \"cleanest\" non-laboratory evidence of\nlabor market discrimination.\nAccording to Riach and Rich (2002), this use of testing\nhas been used for many years, and it is a valuable investiga-\ntive technique. Testing has been described as a process of\npresenting individuals with equal qualifications and similar\npersonal traits to the same employer (Bussey & Travina,\n2003). The significant difference in the individuals was often\nrace or gender.\nResearch Rationale--Diary\nIn the current experimental audit, each tester maintained a\ndiary of his interaction with the employer.The testers recorded\ntheir interactions with the employer or representative imme-\ndiately after leaving the premises. They recorded the day,\ndate, time, and location in their diary. They also recorded their\nconversations with the employer or representative at each\nsite, as well as a physical description of each. Furthermore,\nthey recorded the approximate age, build, hair color, and\nother characteristics to assist in identifying the individuals.\nConstant comparative analysis was used to obtain data\nrelevant to the testers' interaction with the employers. Each\ntester diary entry described the overall interaction with com-\nments made by the employer or representative. The diary\nentries were read four times and the top three prominent\nsimilarities or emergent themes were recorded.\nDescriptive Data About Site: Telephone Survey\nThe third data sample was collected through the use of a tele-\nphone survey administered to the same employers that were\naudited. Data analysis of the telephone survey resulted in\ndescriptive statistics. The results were compared to the infor-\nmation obtained from the other two phases, thereby increas-\ning the validity of the telephone survey.\nThe current telephone survey is an adjusted version of the\nreduced to those variables important to the present research\nquestions.\nThe telephone survey comprised of 28 multiple-choice\nquestions. It was designed to solicit responses regarding the\nattitudes of employers about different kinds of applicants\nfor entry-level positions. The survey included questions\nregarding the employer, the hiring procedures, and the\nemployer's attitudes about various kinds of applicants.\nExamples of the questions asked were as follows:\nNext, I am going to ask about several types of applicants. Please\ntell me if you would accept each type for an entry-level position.\n8. An applicant who is on welfare?\nWould you say you definitely will accept, probably will accept,\nprobably will not accept, or absolutely will not accept? Don't\nknow\u00adno opinion, Refused/no answer.\n10. An applicant who had a criminal record?\nWould you say you definitely will accept, probably will accept,\nprobably will not accept, or absolutely will not accept? Don't\nknow\u00adno opinion, Refused/no answer.\nThe telephone survey was administered by a business\ncommunication specialist who has many years of experience\nconducting telephone interviews. The calls to the employers\nyielded a response rate of 57%.\nData Collection/Analysis--Experimental Audit\nThis study used an experimental audit to produce data rele-\nvant to the research questions. The experimental audit was\nconducted by Black and White male testers who applied for\nreal entry-level jobs in the city of Milwaukee. The definition\nfor entry-level job opening included those that require no\nprevious experience and no education greater than high\nschool. Also, any position legally exempting an ex-offender\nwas not included. The testers were assigned job sites that had\nbeen randomly selected as a criminal record or no criminal\nrecord employer to examine the responses.\nThe variable measured was the number of call backs from\nthe employer after receiving the application. The appropri-\nateness of the methodology for the research was in its ability\nto compare the experiences of testers and real ex-offenders\nseeking employment. It also allowed for the examination of\nthe effect of race on employment opportunities. Yinger\n(1986) described fair housing audits as a means of catching\nindividuals in the act of discrimination. Yinger maintained\nthe use of testers was an opportunity to measure discrimina-\ntion while at the same time observing it in a natural setting.\nAndersson, Jakobsson, and Kotsadam (2012) used a cor-\nresponding test for ethnic and gender discrimination in\nhousing in Norway. Andersson et al.'s design used faked let-\nters in response to apartments listed for rent in Norway. The\ncorrespondence letters signaled to the reader the ethnicity,\ngender, and socioeconomic class. Andersson et al.argued the\nuse of tests allowed for the examination and measurement of\ndiscrimination parameters that would be impossible to\nevaluate.\nOthers have used audits or correspondence testing to\nexamine discrimination. Johnson and Lahey (2011) used\nmatched pairs of resumes to examine hiring of older women\nin entry-level positions. Johnson and Lahey compared the\nuse of audit studies to having a natural field experiment.\nFurthermore, they compared it to humans in the real-world\nwhere you are given the opportunity to examine the responses\nto characteristics of race, gender, or age.\nPaluck (2010) expressed a similar description of the real-\nworld richness of audit studies. Paluck agreed with Veenman\n(2010) that the combination of the qualitative method and field\nexperiments presents the opportunity to have measurable data\nand participant information in a controlled environment.\nNeumark (2010) suggested the value of using audit stud-\nies in discrimination research. Neumark described audit or\ncorrespondence studies as a means of establishing identical\ncharacteristics in an application process except for race, gen-\nder, or ethnicity. A review of the literature shows how others\nuse audit or correspondence studies to examine discrimina-\ntion in the labor market, health care, housing, and education\nin the United States and internationally (Andersson et al.,\nFor the current experimental sample, separate voice mail\ntelephone accounts were established for each tester to use on\nthe employment application. This was used for the employer\nto call back the tester regarding the employment opportunity.\nThe call backs are the dependent variables. Analysis of the\ndata from the call backs was based on the number of\nresponses by criminal record and non-criminal record. In\naddition, an analysis was done on the responses based on the\nrace of the tester. The data were analyzed using descriptive\nstatistics. This consisted of averages and percentages.\nPager (2003) used inferential statistics to analyze the call\nbacks received from the testers based on the race and crimi-\nnal history of the tester. The current research analyzed the\ncall backs similar to Pager considering whether there was a\nhiring preference based on race or criminal history. Also, the\nsample of 30 employers and two testers are too small to have\nconfidence in the statistical significance of the comparison.\nThe study relied on descriptive ability of the results as\nopposed to inferential power.\nStatistics\nThe statistically significant difference is based on a sample\nsize of 30 employers and two testers. The sample size is\ndecreased even more when the 30 employers are divided into\n15 CR and 15 NCR job sites. Therefore, the test for statistical\nsignificance is only being used to support the descriptive\nstatistics.\nWe calculate for the null hypothesis and the alternate\nhypothesis:\n6 SAGE Open\nTest statistics:\nZ\np p\nn\nn\n=\n-\n-\n+\n-\n( ) ( )\n, where P\nr r\nn n\n=\n+\n+\nwhere\np\n: proportion of White Male Tester\np\n: proportion of Black Male Tester\nn\nr\n= Proportion of White Male Tester \u00d7 n\nr\n= Proportion of Black Male Tester \u00d7 n\nThese values are used to determine the Z. The Z calcula-\ntions lead to the calculation of the P value.\nP\nr r\nn n\n=\n+\n+\nThe alternative hypothesis is two-tailed, P value = 2 \u00d7\nP (z < 0.30) and the level of significance is specified as\nAgain, the test of statistical significance is used for\ndescriptive purposes. The sample size of 30 employers\ndivided evenly between two testers is a limitation in the cur-\nrent research.\nResearch Results\nThe three most common job titles were Waitstaff (23%), cus-\ntomer service representative (20%), and delivery driver\n(20%). These job titles represented 63% of the sample. Auto\nparts person, custodian, and lot attendant\u00adauto made 21% of\nthe other job titles. This is followed by cashier, clerk/\nshipping, laborer, auto lube, and warehouse accounting for\n15% of the job titles.\nFindings Related to Research Questions 1 and 2:\nExperimental Audit\nThe experimental audit findings addressed the research ques-\ntions about the effects of a criminal record and race on\nemployment opportunities in the city of Milwaukee for each\nof the Testers.\nThe Effect of Race on Call Backs for the Testers\nThe current research (Figure 1) revealed the White male tes-\nter received 47% of his call backs when he applied for\nemployment with NCR compared with 40% when applying\nfor employment with a CR. The results show there was little\ndifference in the effect of a CR on the White tester for receiv-\ning call backs. The CR did not reduce the likelihood of a call\nback for the White male tester. There was a statistically sig-\nnificant difference (p < .05; significance level was set at the\n.05 level) between the call backs for the Black and White\ntesters.\nThe race of the testers is examined to determine if differ-\nences occurred for Black tester when compared with the\nWhite tester. The effect of race can be observed in Figure 2.\nIt can be observed the Black tester with NCR received 27%\nof the call backs compared with 47% for the White testers. It\ncan also be observed the White tester with a CR received\n40% of the call backs while the Black tester with a CR record\nreceived no call backs. The results suggest that a Black male\nwithout a criminal record is less likely to receive a call back\ncompared with a White male with a criminal record. Also, a\nBlack male with a CR will receive fewer call backs than a\nWhite male with a CR.\nA statistically significant difference (p < .05) exists\nbetween employment opportunities based on CR in the\nWhite and Black tester. But, there is no statistically signifi-\ncant difference between a non-criminal record on employ-\nment opportunities in the White and Black testers.\nAfter testing for the effect of a CR for the White tester, it\nis concluded that there is no significant effect (p > .05) of a\nCR for the White tester. But a test of significant effect of CR\nfor Black tester indicated there is a significant effect for the\nBlack tester. Moreover, the comparisons were made from a\nsample of 30 employers.\nThere are limitations regarding the statistically signifi-\ncance difference in all the findings attributed to the sample\nsize. Therefore, the test for statistical significance is only\nbeing used to support the descriptive statistics.\nPersonal Contact: Interviews\nThe design of the current audit study allowed for direct com-\nparisons of personal contact by race. This is permissible\nWhite Male\nBlack Male\nCall backs\nCR\nNCR\nFigure 1. Percent of call backs from the CR and NCR job sites.\nNote.

Figure 3 repre-\nsents the percent of call backs associated with personal\ncontact. Personal contact is described as the employer inter-\nviewing the tester or offering a job on the spot. Furthermore,\nit could be extra dialogue with the tester and a subsequent\ncall back to the tester. It could also be dialogue or action that\nfavored one tester over the other. The only personal contacts\nrecorded in Figure 3 are those involving an interview.\nFigure 3 reflects the frequency of the impact of personal\ncontact (interview). Personal interviews resulted in 20% of\nthe call backs for both the Black and White tester. Both tes-\nters received 10% of their responses from interviews. It is\nimportant to note the Black tester received the majority of his\nresponses during personal contact (10%) compared with\n3.3% call backs from voicemail. Voice mail box communica-\ntions accounted for 36.6% of the call backs for both the\nBlack and White tester.\nFindings Related to Research Question:\nTelephone Survey\nThe final research question addressed employer expressed\nwillingness to hire and their actual hiring practices. Data\nanalysis of the telephone survey resulted in descriptive sta-\ntistics. The first series of questions addressed background on\nthe company regarding its product or service and number of\nemployees. The next group of questions in Figure 4 addressed\nthe employer's application process. A component of Pager's\n(2001) survey contained a vignette of hypothetical applicants\nfollowed by a series of questions designed to examine the\nemployers' willingness to hire specific workers. It is impor-\ntant to note that the analysis of the responses from the tele-\nphone survey was based on a sample size of 57%.\nFigure 4 indicates that 60% of the employers during the\ntelephone survey responded they always use a written appli-\ncation. It also shows the same percentage of employers\n(60%) who use a written application also conduct a personal\ninterview and verify references.\nThe next series of questions address the employers' atti-\ntudes toward disadvantaged or stigmatized applicants.\nDisadvantaged or stigmatized worker is defined as welfare\nrecipients, applicants with a GED but no high school\ndiploma, applicants with spotty work history, applicants who\nhave been unemployed for a year or more, and ex-offenders\nFigure 5 represents the responses to the telephone survey\nquestions regarding attitude toward hiring disadvantaged\nworkers. Figure 5 indicates that no employer responded with\nan unwillingness to hire a disadvantaged worker. Every\nrespondent showed they \"probably will\" or \"definitely will\"\nhire a disadvantage worker. The degree of commitment to\nhire a disadvantage worker varied among the respondents.\nMore respondents (43.3%) indicated they \"probably will\"\nhire applicant with a criminal record (AppCR) than \"defi-\nnitely will.\" The highest responses for having a positive atti-\ntude toward a disadvantaged worker is GED (40%) followed\nby Welfare (26.6%) and an applicant unemployed (UNEMP;\n20%) for a year or more. Even though AppCR is the lowest\nresponse for \"definitely will,\" it is the highest response of\nThe next series of questions asked about the employers'\napplication process when hiring employees into entry-level\npositions that do not require a college degree. The employers\nwere asked during the telephone survey, \"Over the past year,\nhow often have you required new hires for entry-level posi-\ntions to take a drug test?\" The majority of the respondents\n(53.3%) indicated that they required a drug test. Another\n3.3% indicated the drug test were required sometimes.\nThe next series of questions inquired into the employers'\napplication process when hiring into entry-level positions\nand whether the applicant has a criminal history. The\nemployer is asked, \"Over the past year, to your knowledge,\ndid the application form you used include a question about\nthe applicant's criminal background (that is, did you ask\nImpact of Personal Contact\nVoicemail\nBlack Male\nWhite Male\nInterview\nFigure 3.

Only 10% of the employers indicated\nthat they did not solicit information regarding the applicants'\ncriminal history.\nThe telephone survey asked, \"When do you usually do the\ncriminal background check?\" The results illustrated that\n50% of the employers indicated they conduct a background\ncheck \"after applicant is interviewed, before hire.\" No\nemployer indicated they do the background check before the\napplicant is interviewed.\nThe next question solicited the employers' frequency of\nhiring an individual with a criminal record within the past\nyear. The employer is asked, \"Approximately, how many\nmen with criminal records has your business hired in the past\nyear?\" The employers' response indicated that 30% of the\nemployers hired 1 to 5 applicants with a CR within the past\nyear. Another 3.3% of the employers indicated that they\nhired 11 to 15 applicants with a CR within the past year.\nThe next series of questions were from hypothetical appli-\ncants for an entry-level position. The employer was read the\nbelow directions and description of a hypothetical applicant.\nThe last group of questions was based on a profile that is\nconstructed to emphasize specific work and crime-related\ncharacteristics. In one reading, the applicant is described as a\nBlack male named Chad. In the other reading, he was\ndescribed as a White male called Chad.\nThe following statement and series of questions were read\nNow I'm going to describe some hypothetical applicants for an\nentry-level opening you are trying to fill. Please indicate the\nlikelihood that you would hire the applicant in each case.\nChad is a 23-year-old Black male. He finished high school and\nhas had steady work experience in entry-level jobs. He has good\nreferences and interacts well with people. About a year ago,\nChad was convicted of a drug felony and served 12 months in\nprison. Chad was released last month and now is looking for a\njob.\nThe telephone survey participants were read the above\nvignette and then asked, \"How likely would you be to hire\nChad for an entry-level opening in your company?\" The\nsame vignette was read with Chad being a White male. The\nonly thing that changed in the vignette was race of Chad.\nThe frequency distribution for hiring an applicant with a\ndrug felony is illustrated in Table 1. BMDF represent the\nvignette with Chad being a Black male with a drug felony.\nWMDF represent the vignette with Chad being a White male\nwith a drug felony. BMDF is 6.7% \"very likely\" to hire and\nthis is the same for WMDF (6.7%). Only 6.7% of the respon-\ndents indicated they were \"very likely\" to hire a Black male\nor White male with a drug felony. The respondents indicated\n(\"somewhat likely) a preference to hiring a WMDF (10%)\nThe respondents indicated that a total of 13.3% of \"some-\nwhat unlikely\" and \"very unlikely\" were unlikely to hire the\nWhite Chad (WMDF) with a drug felony. This is compared\nwith a combined total of 23.3% of \"somewhat unlikely\" and\n\"very unlikely\" who indicated they were unlikely to hire a\nBlack Chad (BMDF) with a drug felony.\nThe frequency of the responses to whether the employer\nwill hire an applicant who committed a property crime is in\nTable 1. The respondents were asked, \"Instead of a drug\ncrime, what if Chad had been in prison for a property crime\nsuch as burglary?\" The frequencies indicate the employers\nresponded very similar to hiring both the Black Chad and\nWhite Chad with a record of a property crime. BMPC repre-\nsents the vignette with Chad as a Black male who committed\nthe property crime instead of the drug crime. WMPC repre-\nsents the vignette with Chad as a White male who committed\nthe property crime instead of the drug crime. The frequency\nindicates a combined total of \"very likely\" to \"somewhat\na property crime. Only 3% separate BMPC and WMPC. Yet,\n20% of the employers reported they were \"somewhat\nunlikely\" to \"very unlikely\" to hire either the Black male or\nWhite male who committed a property crime.\nTable 1 reflects the employers' responses to hiring the\nhypothetical Chad who is convicted of a violent crime. The\nemployers indicated that Chad the Black male convicted of a\nviolent crime (BMVC) is not \"very likely\" to be hired in an\nentry-level position. No respondent indicates they were\nlikely to hire Chad who is a BMVC. However, 10% of the\nTable 1.

Plus, more employers (16.7%)\nwere \"very unlikely\" to hire WMVC compared with 13.3%\nfor BMVC. But, if you compared the two negative responses\nof \"very unlikely\" to \"somewhat unlikely,\" the result is about\nTable 1 illustrates the employers responded similarly to\nhiring hypothetical Chad whether he is a White male who\nreceived drug treatment (WMDT) or a Black male who\nreceived drug treatment (BMDT). The employers indicated\nthey were \"somewhat likely\" (26.7%) to hire either Chad\nwho had completed drug treatment.\nThe same vignette is read to the employers with Chad as\na White male and Chad as a Black male who instead of being\nreleased from prison last month, Chad had gotten out of\nprison 6 months ago and had been working at a car wash\nsince his release. Table 2 illustrates the frequency of the\nemployers'responses. Twenty percent of the employers indi-\ncated they were \"very likely\" to hire White Chad (WMEXP)\nand 16.7% of the respondents indicated they were likely to\nhire Black Chad (BMEXP). It should be noted that 30% of\nthe respondents indicated they \"somewhat likely\" hire\nWMEXP compared to 33.3% of the respondents indicating\nthey \"somewhat likely\" hire BMEXP. There is no statisti-\ncally significant difference (p > .05) between proportions of\nWMEXP and BMEXP for combined effect of \"somewhat\nlikely\" to hire with work experience.\nThe use of the vignette during the telephone survey gave\nthe employers an opportunity to state their willingness or\nunwillingness to hire a Black or White male under different\nhypothetical circumstances. What can be concluded from the\nresponses is a willingness of the employers to treat both\napplicants the same. Their responses indicated that there is\nan unwillingness to hire either the Black or White male for\ncriminal behavior. The level of unwillingness increases\nbased on the seriousness of the offense. But, there is little\ndifference in their willingness on the basis of race.\nAgain, there are limitations associated with the statisti-\ncally significance difference in the findings. There were 30\nemployers involved in the study. The telephone survey did\nnot include all of the employers because some did not want\nto participate in the survey. Therefore, the sample size is too\nsmall for any meaningful test of significance.\nComparison of the Results From the Audit,\nDiaries, and Telephone Survey\nThe current study examined the relationship between find-\nings from the audit study, diary entries, and telephone survey.\nThe data came from the same employers who participated in\nthe audit and the telephone survey.\nThe audit revealed that the criminal record for the White\nmale tester had little effect on his call backs. The White male\ntester received 40% of his call backs when applying for\nemployment with a criminal record. The audit also revealed\nthat the White tester received 47% of his call backs when he\napplied for employment with no criminal record. However,\nthe effect of a criminal record is substantially different for\nthe Black male tester. The audit revealed that the Black male\ntester received no call backs when applying for employment\nwith a criminal record. He received 27% of the call backs\nwhen he applied for employment with no criminal record.\nThese findings were supported by the specific entries into\nthe diaries of the testers (Wells, 2013). This data reflected\nthat the employers and their representatives favored the\nWhite male tester who received more interviews from per-\nsonal contact. For instance, it became apparent that the gate-\nkeepers were favoring the White tester. The Black tester was\ndenied applications while data supported that the White tes-\nter received an application from the same person. There was\nalso evidence in behavior notations to support that this was\nintentional on the part of the employee (Wells, 2013).\nA telephone survey was used to identify those who indi-\ncated a willingness to hire ex-offenders with a drug convic-\ntion during the telephone survey and compared their verbal\nresponses to their actual behavior in the audit. The results\nrevealed 73% of the criminal record job site employers par-\nticipated in the telephone survey. The analysis revealed 36%\nof the criminal record job site employers participating in the\nsurvey indicated a willingness to hire an applicant with a\ncriminal record and a drug conviction regardless of race.\nAlso, 55% of the same respondents reported an unwilling-\nness to hire an applicant of either race if they were convicted\nof a drug offense. The results indicated that the willingness\nto hire or not was influenced by race.\nDiscussion\nthat a White male with a criminal record received more call\nbacks than a Black male with no criminal record. The current\nstudy supported the findings of Pager. This study examined\nthe effects of a criminal record and race on employment\nopportunities in the city of Milwaukee.Another aspect was the\nTable 2. Hire Applicant With Job Experience.\nNote. BMEXP = Black Male Experience; WMEXP = White Male Experi-\nence.\ninvestigation of employers' willingness to hire disadvantaged\napplicants. The related research questions were as follows:\nResearch Question 1: What are the effects of a criminal\nrecord in accessing employment opportunities?\nResearch Question 2: What is the impact of race in\naccessing employment opportunities?\nResearch Question 3: What is the relationship between\nemployers' expressed willingness to hire an ex-offender\nand their actual hiring practices?\nThe following will be a discussion of each of the above\nresearch questions.\nEffects of a Criminal Record and Race\nQuestions regarding a criminal record and race were exam-\nined by conducting an experimental audit. Two testers, one\nBlack male and one White male, went to the same job site\nseeking employment. They presented themselves with the\nsame qualifications at each job site. Job sites were divided\nthrough randomization evenly as a Criminal Record or No\nCriminal Record job site. The only major difference in the\ntwo testers is race.\nThe effect of race in these findings is strikingly large. The\nBlack tester without a criminal record received only 27% call\nbacks relative to 47% of White tester. In fact, the White tester\nwith a criminal record received more favorable treatment\n(40%) than the Black tester without a criminal record (27%).\nIt is obvious that the results indicate race favor the White\nmale tester. Race continues to play a dominant role in shap-\ning employment opportunities, it is equal to or greater than\nthe impact of a criminal record. The major finding is there is\nlittle difference in the effects of a criminal record on the\nWhite tester for receiving call backs.\nThe results indicate that when compared with their White\ncounterparts, Blacks are considered for employment little\nless than half as much. Also, Black males without a criminal\nrecord will do considerably worse than White males with\nprior criminal convictions. The compelling effects of race\nthus continue to direct employment decisions in ways that\ncontribute to persisting racial inequality. When the effects of\nrace and criminal record are combined, the problem grows\nmore intense. Not only are Black male more likely to be\nincarcerated than Whites; according to these findings, they\nmay also be more strongly affected by the impact of a crimi-\nnal record. The results were blatant and shocking that when\nall else is held equal but race, the employers preferred the\nWhite tester.\nEmotional Effect\nAn unexpected consequence of the audit study was the nega-\ntive emotional effect of the process on the Black male tester.\nBoth testers recorded their experiences with the application\nprocess. The Black male tester recorded instances of being\nscreened prior to receiving an application, treated rude, and\ntold positions were filled when they were not (Wells, 2013).\nThis emotional effect was documented in the Black tester\ndiaries and debriefings.\nThe effect is consistent with the description of race-\nrelated stress described by Pieterse and Carter (2007). They\nargued that Black Men have a higher incidence of discrimi-\nnation than Black Women. Pieterse and Carter suggest that\nrace related-stress is a by-product of discrimination and\nshould be included in mental and physical health-related\nexaminations and inquiries.\nThe debriefings and diary entries of the Black male tester\nrevealed how these experiences had a negative emotional\neffect on him. The effect was attributed to the constant rejec-\ntion and negative behavior of the gatekeepers toward the\nBlack tester. The diaries exposed a dark side of the employ-\nment application process. It showed employees at the lowest\nlevel of the business screening out applicants (Wells, 2013).\nExpressed Willingness to Hire Ex-Offenders and\nTheir Actual Hiring of Ex-Offender\nAtelephone survey was used to examine the employers'will-\ningness to hire disadvantaged workers. The survey was con-\nducted from the same employers visited by the testers under\nthe experimental audit. The responses indicated all employ-\ners were willing to hire a disadvantaged worker. This\nincluded applicants with a drug felony.\nIt is clear from the current research that employers will\nrespond to a survey favorably toward hiring ex-offenders.\nThis is contrary to their actual practice. When faced with hir-\ning an African American with a drug offense on his record,\nno one called back the Black tester. The current research is\nconsistent with others who question the legitimacy of\nresponses to the sensitive nature of race in a survey (Bertrand\nThe responses in the telephone survey were compared to\nthe findings in the audit. The respondents in the survey indi-\ncated a willingness to hire a Black male with a drug felony at\na higher frequency than the actual experience. In the audit,\nthe Black male tester received no call backs from the\nCriminal Record Job sites. Also, the respondents indicated in\nthe survey they were willing to hire both Black and White\napplicants at the same frequency (6.7%).Yet, in the audit, the\nWhite male tester received 40% of his call backs, while the\nBlack male tester received none.\nFindings Compared to Related Literature\nThere is a good body of literature regarding the effects of\ncriminal history, race, and willingness to hire ex-offenders in\nthe labor market. The current research supported the research\nthat argued there was a negative effect on employment\nopportunities in the labor market for ex-offenders and minor-\nities. Also, the study supports the research that suggested that\nthe survey should not be the only device measuring employ-\nment discrimination. The literature will attest to the enormity\nof the problem of a criminal record, race, and employment.\nMeasuring Employment Discrimination\nVeenman (2010) argued that examinations of labor market\ndiscrimination should employ multiple methods to support\nthe reliability of the results. The existing study used an\nexperimental audit, diaries and debriefings, and a telephone\nsurvey to investigate the effect of a criminal history and race\non employment in the Milwaukee labor market.\nThe findings reinforced the themes that unemployment\namong ex-offenders impact the measurement of racial dis-\ncrimination in employment. Furthermore, multiple means of\ninquiry are important to discern labor market discrimination.\nThe results are consistent with other researchers who suggest\nthat the use of a survey as a measuring tool of employment\ndiscrimination may not yield an accurate reflection of\nemployers' hiring practices (Pager & Quillian, 2005; Yinger,\n1986). It is necessary to use multiple techniques that include\nexperimental audits if we are going to uncover hidden pro-\ncesses and information impacting labor market discrimina-\ntion. It was evident in the current research that the audit of\nemployers yielded information that is not easily obtained\nwith a survey. The audit results is strong support for the per-\nspective that information obtained from testing is a direct\nmeasure of discrimination. Also, the audit allowed for a\nunique opportunity to examine discrimination first-hand in a\nreal-word setting. This could not be done with a survey. The\npersonal contact between the testers and the employer or rep-\nresentative was captured in a meaningful way through the\nIt is important to recognize that employment discrimina-\ntion remain a problem in the workplace for ex-offenders. The\nfailure to adequately monitor and measure discrimination by\nemployers is a major concern. It was observed in the current\nresearch that the actions of the employer representative could\nlead to legitimate allegations of discrimination. Allowing\nunqualified employees to question potential applicants\nregarding their criminal history can lead to a violation of the\nanti-employment discrimination law (Wells, 2013). The level\nof these practices extends to human resource managers and\nowners. It is disturbing that a human resource manager inter-\nviewed an applicant on the basis of a recommendation from\nthe receptionist and another because she thought she had a\nfriend who went to school with the applicant's brother. If\nthese practices are allowed to continue, it will result in fewer\nAfricanAmericans and other minorities in the workplace, the\nresponsibility rests with the employers, management, and\nregulatory agencies.\nLimitations\nThe research revealed the impact of a criminal record and\nrace on employment and wages of ex-offenders. If a White\nmale with a criminal record has a greater chance of gaining\nemployment than a Black male without a criminal record,\nthis suggests that discrimination in hiring should be a major\nconcern for policy makers. Yet, there are some limitations to\nthe current study. The limitations pertain to the parameters\nunder which a study is conducted as well as the areas the\nresearch did not intend to address (Leedy & Ormrod, 2005).\nOne limitation of the study is the experimental audit\nmodel, which has not been frequently used to examine\nemployment discrimination. This model is more commonly\nused in examining discrimination in housing, insurance\nredlining, and mortgage brokerage.\nAnother limitation of the study is the sample. The sample\nsize of 30 employers divided into two equal groups is too\nsmall for substantive inferential statistics. This is not reflec-\ntive of the diverse job market in the study area.\nThe current research used only two testers, thus limiting\nthe comparison to only two subjects. Also, the research was\nrestricted to Black and White male testers. The current study\ndid not consider the effect a criminal history would have on\nwomen and other minority groups.\nThe testers received training in seeking employment. Yet,\nonce the testers entered into the job site, their actual practices\nwere not observed, thus presenting another limitation. For\nexample, the entries in their diaries represent only one side of\nthe interaction.\nThe research was restricted to only employers who\naccepted applications in-person. Many employers require\napplicants to apply online. Also, many employers use\nemployment agencies or job-services to screen applicants.\nThis eliminated a number of employers from the study. Both\nprocesses make it difficult to make generalization regarding\nemployers' hiring practice.\nThe limitations in the current research should be ade-\nquately examined in future research. The main focus of the\ncurrent research was on African American males because it\nwas reported that one in three Black men was under some\nImplications\nThe current research extends our knowledge of the effect of\na criminal history and race in the labor market. It also\naddresses research that relies on the trustworthiness of sur-\nvey responses. The findings have implications for practice,\nresearch, leadership, learning, and service.\nGovernment Enforcement\nGovernment oversight is grossly missing in the area of\nemployment discrimination based on race and criminal\nhistory in the Milwaukee area. The government needs to\nestablish testing procedures for unlawful employment prac-\ntices similar to those in this study and housing discrimination.\nIf employers do not police themselves, then they must be\npoliced. Testing is a legitimate means of policing employers.\nProbation and Parole Agencies\nIt is a common practice for probation and parole agents to\nrequire their clients (ex-offenders) to seek employment.\nYet, no system is in place to monitor whether the employer\nis unlawfully rejecting the client. The agents can sanction\nthe clients for not seeking employment but do not\nreport employers who unlawfully reject their clients.\nDocumentation can result in identifying those employers\nengaging in a pattern of discrimination. An effort should be\nmade to gather information on those employers not hiring\nex-offenders and why. A cooperative effort must be estab-\nlished between the Wisconsin Division of Community\nCorrections and the state agency responsible for investigat-\ning discrimination in employment.\nImplications for Research\nThe current study has implications for further research\nrelated to replication and generalization. Both are impor-\ntant for the credibility of research findings. A larger sam-\nple is needed to examine the impact of discrimination in\nurban cities. Furthermore, the larger sample can include\nan examination of diverse groups of employers. The\nmajority of the employers in the current study are small\nbusiness owners.\nFurther research should also include employers who are\nusing online computer applications. This process virtually\neliminates \"real-life\" experiences and personal contact. How\nare they screening their applicants for elimination? Research\nshould be expanded to include women, Asian, and Latino\ntesters. Replications including these groups can be used to\ndetermine if there are similar effects of discrimination based\non gender, race, and criminal history.\nGeneralization\nThere is a need for the current research to be expanded to\nother cities. It is important to determine if the responses are\nunique for Milwaukee. The study can be replicated to further\nexamine \"real-life\" experiences of applicants. The diary\nmethod (Wells, 2013) is an effective model when data are\nregularly analyzed using the constant comparative method.\nTesters can be manipulated based on race and gender, and\nother purposeful factors. Similar findings in other cities shall\nsignal a national problem in discrimination. Moreover, other\ncities with a different ethnic, racial, and economic make-up\nmay yield different results.\nConclusion\nThe findings revealed during the experimental audit that a\nCR and NCR had no effect on the call backs for the White\nmale tester. The Black male tester received no call backs\nwith a CR. The Black male tester with NCR received fewer\ncall backs than the White male with NCR. The telephone sur-\nvey revealed over 43% of the employers indicated they\n\"probably will\" hire an applicant with a CR, but, only 13%\nindicated they \"definitely will\" hire an applicant with a CR.\nThe results of the telephone survey pointed out that no\nemployer indicated they were unlikely not to hire a disadvan-\ntaged worker. Again, the employers expressed willingness to\nhire or not to hire was not consistent with their actual\npractices.\nThere were events during the audit that could not be cap-\ntured using merely survey methods. For example, in some\ncases the Black male tester was denied applications, was\nsubjected to a pre-application screening, and was told posi-\ntions were filled. Yet, at one job site the Black male tester\nwas praised by an African American manager as being one of\nthe most qualified applicants he had seen in 2 years but still\ndid not get a call back. In another case, an African American\nemployer offered to make sure the application of the Black\nmale tester got to the manager. He also told him how to fol-\nlow-up on the process. The Black male tester received a call\nAuthor's note\nThis article is based on the dissertation of Lenard Wells while\nattending Cardinal Stritch University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAlexander, M.
