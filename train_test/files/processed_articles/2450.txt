Gatny2\nYasamin Kusunoki3\nJennifer S. Barber4\n Introduction\nIn the United States, the term `pregnancy scare' describes when a woman who wants to\navoid pregnancy believes she is pregnant, but later learns that she is not. For example,\nas one respondent (who did not desire a pregnancy) told us shortly after her pregnancy\nscare, \"I thought there could have been a chance that I was pregnant but it turned out\nthat I wasn't, so I am very thankful for that.\" Many respondents reported, \"I missed this\nmonth's period,\" or \"My period started seven days late\" to explain why they\ntemporarily thought they were pregnant.\nPregnancy scares are common \u00ad over half of the young women (54%) who\nparticipated in a recent survey conducted by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen\nand Unplanned Pregnancy (2013) reported that they had had a pregnancy scare. In the\nHenry J. Kaiser Family Foundation's National Survey of Adolescents and Young\nAdults, 3 in 5 respondents reported that they or their female partner had ever\nexperienced a pregnancy scare (Hoff, Greene, and Davis 2003). Relatively little is\nknown about pregnancy scares and their consequences.\nOur first objective is to describe the young women who experience pregnancy\nscares. We hypothesize that disadvantaged sociodemographic background\ncharacteristics and early experiences with sex, lack of contraception, and pregnancy\nwill be associated with pregnancy scares, much as they are associated with unintended\npregnancy.\nOur second objective is to examine the link between pregnancy scares and\nsubsequent unintended pregnancy. A pregnancy scare may be an indicator that a young\nwoman is at high risk of an unintended pregnancy, for several reasons. First, adjustment\nto the idea of a possible pregnancy might introduce some ambivalence into a young\nwoman's desire to avoid pregnancy. This can occur after a miscarriage of an unintended\npregnancy. As one respondent told us, \"I found out I was pregnant and I miscarried. I\ndidn't know that I wanted a baby until I lost it. That is why part of me wants to get\npregnant now. I'm not trying to but I would be happy if I did.\" If pregnancy scares\naffect pregnancy desire, or ambivalence about pregnancy, in a similar way, then\npregnancy scares will have a direct effect on the likelihood of experiencing a later\npregnancy. Second, for imperfect contraceptors, a pregnancy scare is likely to precede\nan actual unintended pregnancy, because the average pregnancy rate for any given\nDemographic Research: Volume 31, Article 40\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1231\nmonth is only about 50% for young women even when sex is perfectly timed to\novulation (Dunson, Colombo, and Baird 2002). Third, personality traits or skills that\nlead to pregnancy scares may predict unintended pregnancy as well \u00ad for example, the\nability to consistently adhere to a contraception regimen.\n2. Methods\nWe use data from the Relationship Dynamics and Social Life (RDSL) study, which\nresiding in a Michigan county. Women were selected from the state driver's license and\npersonal identification card databases. Investigators conducted a 60-minute face-to-face\nyear follow-up study that required completion of weekly online or telephone surveys\nabout contraceptive use, relationships, and prospective pregnancy intentions. In this\npaper we refer to the follow-up study as \"the journal,\" and the weekly surveys as\n\"journals\". The follow-up study concluded in February 2012. The response rate for the\nbaseline interview was 84%, 99% agreed to participate in the journal, and 75%\nparticipated in the journal for at least 18 months.\nIn this study we use only the first 18 months of the journal data to minimize bias\nfrom attrition. We analyze the weeks in which the respondent was not pregnant and did\nnot strongly desire a pregnancy. We use two questions from the weekly surveys that\nmeasured pregnancy desires to identify those weeks. The first question asked\nrespondents how much they wanted to get pregnant during the next month. The second\nquestion asked respondents how much they wanted to avoid getting pregnant during the\nnext month. Both questions used a response scale from 0 to 5. Figure 1 summarizes the\ncombined responses to these two questions, which we describe as strong antinatal,\nmoderate antinatal, ambivalent/indifferent/moderate pronatal, and strong pronatal. The\ndesign of these measures and how they relate to subsequent pregnancy have been\ndescribed elsewhere (Miller, Barber, and Gatny 2013). In this study we omit weeks\nclassified as strong pronatal in Figure 1. The result is an analytic sample of 901 young\nGatny, Kusunoki & Barber: Pregnancy scares and subsequent unintended pregnancy\n1232 http://www.demographic-research.org\nFigure 1: Categories of the combined responses to the questions measuring\npregnancy desires\nOutcomes. Each week, respondents were asked about their pregnancy status, and are\ncoded as \"not pregnant,\" \"probably pregnant,\" or \"pregnant.\" \"Pregnant\" is defined as a\nself-report of a positive pregnancy test. Of the 901 young women in our analytic\nperiod. Table 1 summarizes these statistics. Of those women who experienced an\nunintended pregnancy during the study, 89% reported only one and 11% reported two.\nDemographic Research: Volume 31, Article 40\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1233\nTable 1: Percent of sample experiencing unintended pregnancy and\nPercent\nAny unintended pregnancy 13\nNumber of unintended pregnancies (among those who experienced any\nAny pregnancy scare 9\nNumber of pregnancy scares (among those who experienced any pregnancy\nBecause we are analyzing only weeks in which respondents do not desire\npregnancy, any \"probably pregnant\" report that is not subsequently verified by a\npregnancy test (or, eventually, a birth, miscarriage, or abortion) is considered a\n\"pregnancy scare\". Descriptive statistics of these measures are also presented in Table\nscares during the 18-month study period. The majority reported only one pregnancy\nscare (78%), but a substantial proportion reported two (13%), and even three or four\npregnancy scare within the study period, and among the 85 women who reported a\npregnancy scare, 34 (40%) subsequently had an unintended pregnancy during the study\n(not shown in tables). Among the 816 women in our analytic sample who did not report\na pregnancy scare, only 88 (11%) subsequently had an unintended pregnancy during the\nstudy (not shown in tables).\nSociodemographic characteristics and adolescent pregnancy-related experiences.\nWe include characteristics measured in the baseline interview, summarized in Table 2.\nAll of these variables are dichotomous, except high school GPA, which is continuous.\nCurrently receiving public assistance includes WIC (Women, Infants and Children\nProgram), FIP (Family Independence Program), cash welfare, or food stamps.\nOther indicators. In regression models we use the total number of journals\ncompleted to control for repeated observation and exposure time. And, in hazard\nmodels, we include respondents' time in study, time in study squared, and total number\nof journals completed, to control for the increasing hazard of pregnancy and repeated\nGatny, Kusunoki & Barber: Pregnancy scares and subsequent unintended pregnancy\n1234 http://www.demographic-research.org\nobservations. Time in study is coded in months and ranges from 0.49 to 18 months,\nFirst we calculate the descriptive statistics for all independent variables for the total\nsample, as well as two subsamples: those who never experienced a pregnancy scare,\nand those who experienced a pregnancy scare (Table 2). Independent samples' t-tests\nindicate whether the independent variables are statistically different in the two\nsubsamples. Next we investigate these characteristics in a multivariate context, using\nlogistic regression for models of experiencing any pregnancy scare, and Poisson\nregression for models of the number of pregnancy scares (Table 3). Lastly, we estimate\nhazard models, implemented using logistic regression, to illustrate the relationship\nbetween a pregnancy scare and subsequent unintended pregnancy (Table 4). All\nanalyses were conducted in Stata 12.1 using the logit, poisson, and xtlogit commands.\nThe hazard models were estimated with xtlogit to account for the clustering effect of\nmultiple journals per respondent.\n3. Results\n3.1 Characteristics of respondents who had a pregnancy scare\nTable 2 shows that, overall, sociodemographic characteristics associated with\ndisadvantage are overrepresented in the subsample of young women who experienced a\npregnancy scare. For example, while only 32% of those who did not experience a\npregnancy scare are African American, 54% of those who experienced a pregnancy\nscare are African American. Also, young women with early pregnancy-related\nexperiences are overrepresented in the pregnancy scares subsample.\nDemographic Research: Volume 31, Article 40\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1235\nTable 2: Sociodemographic characteristics and adolescent pregnancy-related\nexperiences\nTotal\nSample\nSubsample who did\nnot experience a\npregnancy scare\nSubsample who\nexperienced a\npregnancy scare\np-\nvalue\n% % %\nSociodemographic Characteristics\nAdolescent Pregnancy-Related Experiences\nNote: + p < 0.10; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001 (one-tailed independent samples t-tests for significant differences between the\ntwo subsamples)\na mean GPA presented for sample and subsamples; b std. dev.=.59\n3.2 Multivariate models of experiencing a pregnancy scare\nThe results in Table 3 are similar to the bivariate results presented in Table 2, although\nsome of the associations are not statistically significant in the multivariate models.\nFurther, the results are quite similar across specifications \u00ad characteristics associated\nwith the probability of experiencing a pregnancy scare are also associated with the\nnumber of pregnancy scares actually reported, with only minor differences.\nColumn 1 shows that young women who are African-American, did not have a\ntwo-parent family structure, had a lower GPA in high school, and/or were living with a\npartner had higher probability of a pregnancy scare. In addition, young women who had\nhad sex without birth control in the past had marginally higher probability of a\npregnancy scare.\nGatny, Kusunoki & Barber: Pregnancy scares and subsequent unintended pregnancy\n1236 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 3: Regression coefficients for models of any pregnancy scare (logistic)\nand number of pregnancy scares (poisson) (N=901)\nAny Pregnancy\nScare\nNumber of\nPregnancy Scares\nSociodemographic Characteristics\nAfrican American\nBio mom <20 years old at 1st birth\nTwo-parent childhood family structure\nHigh school GPA\nCurrently receiving public assistance\nLiving with partner\nAdolescent Pregnancy-Related Experiences\nAge at first sex < 16 years\nTwo or more sexual partners\nEver had sex without birth control\n1 or more prior pregnancies\nOther\nTotal number of journals completed\nNote: Standard errors in parentheses.\n\nColumn 2 shows that these same individual characteristics are also associated with\na larger number of pregnancy scares. In addition, young women with two or more\nsexual partners experienced a marginally higher number of pregnancy scares than their\npeers. This suggests that women who had multiple sexual partners are\nDemographic Research: Volume 31, Article 40\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1237\ndisproportionately represented in the group that experienced multiple pregnancy scares.\nIn these multivariate regression models, having had sex without birth control is the only\nadolescent pregnancy-related experience strongly related to pregnancy scares. Recall\nthat in the bivariate models, on the other hand, early sex, multiple partners, prior sex\nwithout birth control, and one or more prior pregnancies are strongly related to\npregnancy scares. This suggests that early sex, multiple sexual partners, and prior\npregnancy are associated with pregnancy scares largely because of the\nsociodemographic characteristics of those young women who have early sex, multiple\npartners, and teen pregnancies, or because of their association with having sex without\nbirth control. This is consistent with existing research; for example, finding that early\nsexual debut is associated with less contraceptive use (Kusunoki and Upchurch 2011;\nalso that respondents who completed more journals were more likely to report a\npregnancy scare, likely in part because it is associated with more time in the study\nperiod.\n3.3 Multivariate models of the hazard of experiencing an unintended pregnancy\nFinally, in Table 4 we estimate hazard models to illustrate the relationship between a\npregnancy scare and subsequent unintended pregnancy rates. Model 1 includes only the\ncontrol variables and shows higher unintended pregnancy rates among young African\nAmerican women, those whose mothers had their first birth as a teen, those with a\nlower high school GPA, those receiving public assistance, and those living with a\nromantic partner. In terms of respondents' prior experiences, unintended pregnancy\nrates are higher among those who had sexual intercourse at or before age 16, had two or\nmore sexual partners during adolescence, and/or had an adolescent pregnancy. In\naddition, the time variables are significant \u00ad the risk of unintended pregnancy increases\nthroughout most of the study period, but then declines slightly near the end (indicated\nby the small negative coefficient for the variable indicating squared months in the\nstudy). Respondents who completed more journals during the study also had a lower\nhazard of unintended pregnancy. Note that because total number of journals completed\nis net of time in the study in these models, the negative coefficient likely represents the\ntype of respondent who completed many journals within a specific period. Thus, the\nnegative association is due to characteristics that lead respondents to complete more\njournals and also reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy, for example,\nconscientiousness.\nGatny, Kusunoki & Barber: Pregnancy scares and subsequent unintended pregnancy\n1238 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 4: Logistic regression coefficients (additive effects on log-odds) for\nmodels of the hazard of unintended pregnancy (N=901 individuals,\nAny pregnancy scare\nSociodemographic Characteristics\nAfrican American\nBio mom <20 years old at 1st birth\nTwo-parent childhood family structure\nHigh school GPA\nCurrently receiving public assistance\nLiving with partner\nAdolescent Pregnancy-Related Experiences\nAge at first sex 16 years or less\nTwo or more sexual partners\nEver had sex without birth control\n1 or more prior pregnancies\nOther\nTime in study\nTime in study2\nTotal number of journals completed\nNote: Standard errors in parentheses.\nDemographic Research: Volume 31, Article 40\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1239\nModel 2 shows that young women who experienced a pregnancy scare had higher\nsubsequent unintended pregnancy rates than those respondents who did not. More\nprecisely, the weekly log-odds of experiencing an unintended pregnancy were 99%\nhigher, which translates into nearly double the unintended pregnancy rate for women\nwho had a prior pregnancy scare compared to those who did not.\nModel 3 indicates higher unintended pregnancy rates after a pregnancy scare even\nwhen measures of sociodemographic characteristics are included as controls. In other\nwords, although women from disadvantaged backgrounds experience more pregnancy\nscares and higher unintended pregnancy rates, young women who experience a\npregnancy scare have higher unintended pregnancy rates than their peers without a\npregnancy scare, net of their disadvantaged background. However, the fact that the\nmagnitude of the pregnancy scare effect declines by 20% between models 2 and 3\nindicates that pregnancy scares are associated with unintended pregnancy in part\nbecause of the sociodemographic characteristics linked to both experiences.\nThe adolescent pregnancy-related experiences added to Model 4 explain an\nadditional 6% of the relationship between pregnancy scares and unintended pregnancy,\nbut the coefficient remains large and statistically significant. Although adolescent\nexperiences with early sex and multiple partners are strongly related to the rate of\nunintended pregnancy, for the most part they do not explain the difference in\nunintended pregnancy rates between young women who experienced pregnancy scares\nand those who did not.\n4. Discussion\nWe found that a substantial proportion (9%) of young women experienced a pregnancy\nscare during the 18-month study period. A wide range of sociodemographic\ncharacteristics and adolescent experiences were associated with pregnancy scares in our\nbivariate analyses. However, in our multivariate analyses, only being African-\nAmerican, growing up with something other than a two-parent family structure, having\na lower high school GPA, living with a romantic partner, and having sex without birth\ncontrol during adolescence were independently associated with a higher probability of a\npregnancy scare. We found similar results when we predicted number of pregnancy\nscares. This suggests that although pregnancy scares occur to all types of young\nwomen, those from less advantaged backgrounds are more likely to experience a\npregnancy scare than those from more advantaged backgrounds.\nWe found that 21% of the unintended pregnancies were preceded by a pregnancy\nscare within the study period, and \u00ad even more dramatic \u00ad more than 40% of women\nwho reported a pregnancy scare went on to experience an unintended pregnancy, even\nGatny, Kusunoki & Barber: Pregnancy scares and subsequent unintended pregnancy\n1240 http://www.demographic-research.org\nduring the relatively limited period of observation in our study (18 months). In our\nhazard models, pregnancy scares are a strong predictor of unintended pregnancy,\nindependent of key sociodemographic characteristics and adolescent experiences. In\nother words, young women who experience a pregnancy scare have higher unintended\npregnancy rates than those who do not, regardless of their background. This suggests\nthat pregnancy scares may be a harbinger of a future unintended pregnancy.\nIt is beyond the scope of the current study to discern the mechanisms that explain\nwhy pregnancy scares are followed by unintended pregnancies, but future research\nshould examine whether young women's attitudes or behaviors change after this\nexperience. Of course, we cannot rule out that other unknown or unmeasured factors\nassociated with unintended pregnancy are captured by pregnancy scares. But even if\nthis is the case, a pregnancy scare could mark an important point for intervention.\nThe study has several limitations. The single county sample design may decrease\nthe generalizability of the results. The sample does, however, hold constant the\ngeographic differences in pregnancy scares and/or unintended pregnancy rates, as well\nas the geographic factors (e.g., media, policy, etc.) that are not a focus in this study. The\nvery few Latinas in the county, and in our sample, precludes assessing them as a\nseparate category. Research has estimated that other surveys capture only about one-\nhalf of abortions (Jones and Kost 2007). Thus, unintended pregnancies that end in\nabortion are likely underrepresented in our analyses.\nFinally, although we measure pregnancy desires prospectively with two unipolar\nscales, this measurement does not fully capture the range of emotions surrounding\npregnancy. We also use a broad definition of \"unintended\" in this analysis \u00ad we\nconsider all pregnancies that were not fully intended (i.e., strong desire to get pregnant\nand no desire to avoid pregnancy) to be unintended. Our goal in this analysis was not to\ndevelop a complex measure of the intention status of pregnancies or pregnancy scares,\nbut rather to limit our analyses to time periods when young women were not\nspecifically trying to become pregnant.\n5. Conclusions\nOur research describes the young women who have pregnancy scares \u00ad information we\nmust have for reducing the incidence of these distressing events. In addition, we find\nthat pregnancy scares often precede unintended pregnancies. Asking young women\nwhether they have ever had a pregnancy scare is a simple and straightforward way to\nassess pregnancy risk, and may help clinicians gauge how effectively young women are\nusing their chosen contraceptive method.\nDemographic Research: Volume 31, Article 40\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1241\n6.
