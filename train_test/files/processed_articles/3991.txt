While aliskiren inhibited this activity, valsartan did not. We noted that production of reactive oxygen species\nintensified and the bioavailability of nitric oxide diminished in the glomeruli of diabetic mice. Aliskiren and valsartan\nsignificantly ameliorated these effects. They suppressed glomerular production of reactive oxygen species and urinary\nalbumin excretion. In fact, urinary albumin excretion in diabetic mice treated with aliskiren or valsartan was lower than\nthat in untreated diabetic mice. Furthermore, aliskiren and valsartan significantly reduced glomerular permeability by\nmaintaining the glomerular endothelial surface layer.\nConclusion: Fluorescence resonance energy transfer could provide a new tool for evaluating tissue and plasma\nenzymatic activity.\n",

While the\npathogenesis is understood well enough to prevent pro-\ngression of diabetic vascular complications, it is still not\nsufficiently clear.\nAlthough systemic renin activity is suppressed in dia-\nbetes, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors exert\nrenoprotective effects.2 This is possible because the\npathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy appears to involve\nactivation of local/tissue RAS (independently regulated in\neach organ). Inhibiting RAS activation is important in\norder to prevent the progression of diabetic nephropathy.2\nAliskiren, a renin inhibitor, is renoprotective in diabetic\nanimal models.3\u00ad5 It suppresses RAS activity by directly\ninhibiting renin activity in the most upstream portion of\nRAS.6 Since aliskiren has high affinity for renal tissue and\nprolonged activity,7 it should provide good control of\nhypertension with strong renoprotective effects. While it is\npossible to measure tissue RAS activity, no reports of in\nvivo images exist. We developed a novel technique to vis-\nualize tissue renin activity in vivo by utilizing a fluores-\ncence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system and\nconfocal laser microscopy. We used this in vivo imaging\ntechnique to examine the possible involvement of local\nRAS in diabetic nephropathy. In addition, we studied the\nFeasibility of fluorescence energy transfer\nsystem for imaging the renoprotective\neffects of aliskiren in diabetic mice\nKengo Kidokoro, Minoru Satoh, Seiji Itano, Atsunori Kuwabara,\nTamaki Sasaki and Naoki Kashihara\n Keywords\nRenin, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, in vivo imaging, albuminuria, diabetic nephropathy\nDepartment of Nephrology and Hypertension, Kawasaki Medical\nSchool, Japan\nCorresponding author:\nMinoru Satoh, Department of Nephrology and Hypertension, Kawasaki\nEmail: msatoh@med.kawasaki-m.ac.jp\nOriginal Article\n2 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nrenoprotective mechanisms of aliskiren and its inhibitory\neffect on renin activity.\nMethods and materials\nExperimental animals\nThe experimental protocol (No. 11-055) was approved by\nthe Ethics Review Committee for Animal Experimentation\nof the Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Japan. Male\nC57BL/6J mice (six weeks old) were purchased from\nCharles River Japan (Kanagawa, Japan). The mice were\nhoused in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room\nwith a 12-h light\u00addark cycle. They were fed standard labo-\nratory animal chow and had free access to tap water.\nWe induced diabetes in the mice (n=40) by intraperito-\nneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ; Sigma Aldrich, St.\nLouis, Missouri, USA), at a dose of 50 mg/kg/d for 3 d as\na modified Animal Models of Diabetic Complications\nConsortium protocol of multiple low-dose STZ injections.\nBlood glucose was measured using Medisafe Mini\n(Terumo, Tokyo, Japan). Mice with blood glucose levels\n300 mg/dl a week after the final STZ injection (n=30)\nwere considered diabetic. Six weeks after they developed\ndiabetes, the mice began a four-week course of either\nn=10) or no treatment (n=10). We injected aliskiren into\nthe peritoneum using an osmotic pump. Valsartan was\nadministrated by gavage. Same-aged non-diabetic male\nmice were used as controls (n=8). At 18 weeks of age,\nbody weight was recorded, and blood pressure was meas-\nured by the tail-cuff method with an automatic sphyg-\nmomanometer (BP98A; Softron, Tokyo, Japan). Then, the\nmice were placed in metabolic cages for 24 h to collect\nurine. We sacrificed them using sevoflurane gas in order to\ncollect blood samples. Serum creatinine level was meas-\nured using an enzyme assay (Nescoat VLII CRE kit;\nAlfresa Pharma, Osaka, Japan). Urinary albumin levels\nwere determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\n(ELISA) using a murine microalbuminuria ELISA kit\n(Albuwell M; Exocell, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA).\nEvaluation of renin activity in vivo using renin\nFRET substrate\nWe obtained renin FRET substrate (5-FAM/QX 520) from\nAnaSpec (San Jose, California, USA), and we used a mul-\ntiphoton excitation laser-scanning fluorescence micros-\ncopy confocal microscope system (TCS SP2 AOBS MP;\nLeica-Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) for this study.\nIn order to infuse a dye, we placed each mouse under\nsevoflurane-induced anesthesia and inserted a catheter into\nits right external jugular vein. Afterwards, we made a\n15\u00ad20 mm dorsal incision under sterile conditions to\nexteriorize the left kidney. We removed a cortical slice\nless than 1 mm thick to allow imaging of the most super-\nficial glomeruli. Bleeding was minimal and stopped\nspontaneously within 2 min. During all procedures and\nimaging, the mice's core body temperature was main-\ntained at 37\u00b0C with a homeothermic table. A 0.1 ml vol-\nume of 70 kDa Texas Red dextran (neutral, excitation\nWaltham, Massachusetts, USA) solution (2 mg/ml) was\ninfused through the jugular venous catheter to identify\nglomeruli. Next, for analysis of renin activity, a 0.1 ml\nvolume of renin FRET substrate solution (0.5 mM) was\ninfused. The integrating fluorescein intensity in the glo-\nmerular tufts for 5 s from injection was measured\nto evaluate the renin FRET activity as previously\ndescribed.8 The result was shown as relative intensity\ncompared to the control group.\nPlasma renin activity assay\nPlasma renin activity was determined using a Fluorometric\nSensolyte 520 Mouse ReninAssay Kit (AnaSpec) following\nthe manufacturer's protocol.\nDetection of endothelial surface layer\nSections (4 m thick) were prepared from renal tissue\nsamples embedded in paraffin and stained with tetrameth-\nylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated wheatgerm agglu-\ntinin (WGA; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California,\nUSA). Tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated\nWGA-stained kidney sections were analyzed using\nTCS-NT system software (Leica-Microsystems, Wetzlar,\nGermany). For evaluation of glomerular endothelial sur-\nface layer (ESL), percent positive area was measured\nwith a color image analyzer (WinLoof; Mitani Co., Fukui,\nrandomly selected from each mouse, and the mean score\nwas calculated.\nIn situ detection of nitric oxide and reactive\noxygen species (ROS)\nThe production levels of nitric oxide and ROS resulting\nfrom nitric oxide synthase (NOS) coupling were imaged\nby confocal laser microscopy after renal perfusion of\n2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA;\nTokyo, Japan) and diaminorhodamine-4M acetoxyme-\nthyl ester (DAR-4M AM; excitation 560 nm, emission\n575 nm, Sekisui Medical) with L-arginine as previously\ndescribed.9\nKidokoro et al. 3\nIn vivo imaging of macromolecule hyperfiltration\nA multiphoton excitation laser-scanning fluorescence\nmicroscopy confocal microscope system (TCS SP2\nAOBS MP; Leica-Microsystems) was used for imaging of\nmacromolecule hyperfiltration.

Statistical comparisons were made using the\nMann\u00adWhitney U test or the one-factor analysis of vari-\nance with a Tukey\u00adKramer test for multiple comparisons.\nA p value of <0.05 was considered significant.\nResults\nPhysiologic and biochemical data\nPhysiologic characteristics of the four groups are listed\nin Table 1. The STZ, STZ with aliskiren (STZ+Alis), and\nSTZ with valsartan (STZ+Val) groups had significantly\nlower body weight and higher serum glucose and creati-\nnine levels compared to mice in the control group. We\nnoted that among STZ, STZ+Alis, and STZ+Val groups,\nserum glucose levels were similar and serum creatinine\nlevels did not differ. Meanwhile, blood pressure readings\nfor mice in the STZ+Alis and STZ+Val groups were\nsignificantly lower than for mice in the control and STZ\ngroups, but blood pressure readings between STZ+Alis\nand STZ+Val groups did not differ. Finally, mice in the\nSTZ group excreted significantly higher levels of urinary\nalbumin compared to mice in the control group (Figure 1).\nHowever, mice in the STZ+Alis and STZ+Val groups\nexcreted significantly less urinary albumin than mice in\nthe STZ group.\nIn vivo imaging of renin activity in kidney and\nplasma renin activity\nWe detected in vivo renin activity in the kidneys by inject-\ning renin FRET substrate (see Supplementary Material).\nAs shown in Figure 2(a), high fluorescence was observed\nin the glomeruli of mice in the STZ group compared to the\ncontrol group. We noted that while aliskiren suppressed\nfluorescence intensity in the STZ group, valsartan did not.\nThe integrating fluorescein intensity in the glomerular tufts\nwas significantly increased in the STZ group compared to\nthe control group (Figure 2(b)). These changes were com-\npletely suppressed by aliskiren, but not valsartan.\nPlasma renin activity was assessed with an assay kit\nusing the FRET system. We found that plasma renin activ-\nity in the STZ group was much higher than in the control\ngroup (Figure 2(c)). Plasma renin activity was also higher\nin the STZ group compared to the STZ+Alis group.\nTable 1.

In\nother words, the specificity of this technique for visual-\nizing local tissue renin activity might not be high.\nHowever, renin gene and protein expression have been\nMoreover, PRR expression has been reported in the\nglomerular cells, such as mesangial cells, podocytes, and\nvascular walls.18\u00ad20 In this study, we observed fluores-\ncence that might be from podocytes. Therefore, we rea-\nsoned that the fluorescence observed in the glomeruli\nreflected renin enzymatic activity in the glomeruli. This\ntechnique might be an effective method for evaluating\nrenin enzymatic activity in vivo.\nPeti-Peterdi et al. have used renin FRET substrate\nto visualize renin enzymatic activity in freshly dissected\nkidney tissue.21 However, no studies have evaluated renin\nenzymatic activity in living animals until now. We visual-\nized and evaluated the in vivo renin enzymatic activity\nof the glomeruli by intravenously injecting renin FRET\nsubstrate. We found that renin enzymatic activity in mice\ninjected with STZ was higher than mice in the control\ngroup. Aliskiren suppressed that activity. We also noted\nthat aliskiren and valsartan ameliorated the effects of\ndiabetes by decreasing glomerular oxidative stress and\nlowering nitric oxide bioavailability. Moreover, both\nagents reduced glomerular hyperpermeability in diabetic\nmice. By suppressing renal oxidative stress, aliskiren and\nvalsartan helped maintain the glomerular glycocalyx in\ndiabetic mice, reducing glomerular hyperpermeability,\nwhich reduced excretion of urinary albumin.\nRecent evidence has revealed that the intrarenal RAS\nactivation is an important factor to the pathogenesis of\nrenal injury.22 In general, the intrarenal angiotensin II gen-\neration is increased, despite suppression of the systemic\nRAS, in diabetic nephropathy.23 In STZ rats, an increase in\nrenal renin was demonstrated.12 Direct demonstration of\nincreased renin mRNA in the expanded mesangial area of\nkidney tissues from diabetic patients was also shown by in\nsitu hybridization studies.24 Indeed, local renin production\nis increased in the diabetic kidney. Local renin increase\ncauses the progression of diabetic nephropathy via several\npathways. We showed that both inhibition of renin by\naliskiren and angiotensin receptor blockade by valsartan\nare effective for renoprotection in the diabetic kidney. So\ninhibition of local RAS, especially blockade of local angi-\notensin II signaling, may be more important for treatment\nof diabetic nephropathy.\nOne limitation of this study is that it is unclear\nwhether fluorescence of renin FRET substrate reflects\nonly tissue renin activity. In future studies, researchers\nshould establish methods to distinguish between plasma\nrenin activity and tissue renin activity. Another limitation\nis the difference between the renoprotective effects of\ndirect renin inhibitors and ARBs was not clear. Previous\ndata indicate that aliskiren and valsartan have synergis-\ntic protective effects,3 suggesting they may have differ-\nent renoprotective mechanisms, but more time might be\nneeded to clarify the beneficial effects of these agents.\nFurthermore, another limitation is that we used STZ-\ninduced diabetic mice, which is type 1 diabetes. In clini-\ncal medicine, type 2 diabetes is more prevalent than\nFigure 4. Evaluation of glomerular endothelial surface layer\n(ESL).

Since no\ndifference was found between the protective effects of\naliskiren and valsartan against nephropathy, further exami-\nnation is needed.\n"
