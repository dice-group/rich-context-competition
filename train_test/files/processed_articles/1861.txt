Venkat Narayan\n \nDisease Control and Prevention, US Department of Health and Human Services, Atlanta, GA.\nThe relation between height and lower extremity peripheral insensate neuropathy among persons with and\nwithout diabetes was examined by use of the 1999\u00ad2002 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nwith 5,229 subjects aged 40 or more years. A monofilament was used to determine whether any of three areas on\neach foot were insensate. Peripheral insensate neuropathy was defined as the presence of one or more insensate\nareas. Its prevalence was nearly twice as high among persons with diabetes (21.2%) as among those without\nwomen (9.4%), but the difference was not significant after adjustment for height. Greater height was associated\nwith increased peripheral insensate neuropathy prevalence among persons with and without diabetes (p < 0.001).\nThis association was characterized by a sharp increase in prevalence among persons who were taller than\n175.5 cm. Peripheral insensate neuropathy risk was significantly higher among those taller than 175.5 cm (adjusted\nodds ratio \u00bc 2.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.5, 3.5). The authors conclude that body height is an important correlate\nof peripheral insensate neuropathy. This association largely accounts for the difference in peripheral insensate\nneuropathy prevalence between men and women. Height may help health-care providers to identify persons at high\nrisk of peripheral insensate neuropathy.\naging; body composition; data collection; diabetes mellitus; peripheral nervous system diseases\nAbbreviations: A1c, glycated hemoglobin A1c; CI, confidence interval; NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey; SE, standard error.\nPeripheral insensate neuropathy is common in the middle-\naged or older adult US population (1). It is one of the\nmost disabling complications of diabetes because of its high\nincidence and its potential to lead to lower extremity ul-\nceration, deformation, and amputation (2). Early identifi-\ncation of neuropathy, tight glycemic control among people\nwith diabetes, smoking cessation, and other preventive care\nare considered key public-health strategies against costly\nfoot complications (3\u00ad6). Factors associated with neuropa-\nthy include diabetes mellitus, poor glycemic control, male\nsex, White race, and older age (1, 7, 8).\nThere is also growing, yet still unappreciated evidence that\nheight may be an important and practical predictor of periph-\neralinsensate neuropathy or lower extremityamputation (7\u00ad9).\nHeight may increase the risk of peripheral insensate neurop-\nathy because of increased axon surface exposure to toxins.\nMost studies that have noted a relation of height with periph-\neral neuropathy or amputation were conducted among persons\nwith diabetes mellitus (7, 10\u00ad15), and few population-based\nstudies have been conducted (13). It is unknown whether\nthere is a threshold in the association between height and risk\nfor peripheral insensate neuropathy in the general population.\nReprint requests to Dr. Yiling J.

In particular, it\nallowed us to examine whether there are threshold effects\nin the association between height and peripheral insensate\nneuropathy and whether any association is modified by\nthe effects of factors such as diabetes status, sex, and race/\nethnicity.\nThe NHANES is a nationally representative survey of the\nUS civilian noninstitutionalized population conducted by\nthe National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for\nstaff have conducted interviews and performed physical\nexaminations on a continuous basis. Participants are inter-\nviewed in their homes about their health history, health\nbehaviors, and risk factors and subsequently undergo the\nphysical examination at a mobile examination center. The\nprocedures to select the sample and conduct the interview\nand examination have been described elsewhere (16). In-\nformed consent is obtained from all participants, and the\nprotocol has been approved by the institutional review board\nof the National Center for Health Statistics.\nThis report is based on 4 years of NHANES data (from\nanswered the diabetes questionnaire during this time, 5,848\n(87.8 percent) also underwent the health examination, which\ndid not undergo the peripheral insensate neuropathy ex-\namination because they refused or had a physical/health\nlimitation, because of technical problems and errors in mea-\nsurement, or because of some other unspecified reason; 86\nmore were excluded from our analysis because they had no\nheight measurement. Thus, peripheral insensate neuropathy\nexamination results and height were available for 5,229 sub-\njects aged 40 or more years.\nAssessment of peripheral insensate neuropathy\nPeripheral insensate neuropathy was assessed by testing\nsubjects' foot sensation with a standardized 5.07-gauge\n(10-g force) Semmes-Weinstein nylon monofilament ac-\ncording to a standard protocol (1). Health technicians ap-\nplied pressure with the monofilament at three sites on the\nbottom of each of the subjects' feet (plantar, first metatarsal\nhead; plantar, fifth metatarsal head; and plantar, hallux) (i.e,\na total of six sites). They applied the monofilament until it\nbuckled and then held it for another second. A site was con-\nsidered insensate if there were 1) two incorrect responses,\n2) two ``unable to determine'' responses, or 3) one incorrect\nand one ``unable to determine'' response for a site. The sites\nare tested in a nonsequential order to allow for better dis-\ncrimination of sensation by the examinee. Impaired sensa-\ntion was quantified by the total number of insensate areas\nfor both feet (range: 0\u00ad6), and peripheral insensate neurop-\nathy was defined as one or more insensate area. Previous\nstudies have found the presence of one or more insensate\nareas to be highly predictive of ulcers and amputation and\nto have moderately high sensitivity (~85 percent) and spec-\nificity (~80 percent) based on vibration testing and ulcer\nDiabetes and other measurements\nParticipants' responses to the questionnaires were used to\ncategorize them by their self-reported physician-diagnosed\ndiabetes status, duration of history of diabetes (no diabetes;\ndiabetes <7 years; diabetes 7 years), measured high blood\npressure (yes, no), and age (years), race/ethnicity (non-\nHispanic White vs. others), education (less than high school\nvs. high school education or more), current smoking status\n(yes, no), and current alcohol consumption status (none;\nmild: <1 drink/week; moderate: 1\u00ad7 drinks/week; and heavy:\n8 drinks/week).\nParticipants' height (cm) and weight (kg) were measured\nwith a standard protocol, and they were divided into four\nand 92 kg). Their body mass index was calculated as\nweight (kg)/height (m)2, and they were divided into three\ngroups on the basis of their body mass index: normal (<25),\nThe glycated hemoglobin A1c (A1c) percentage was used\nto measure participants' glycemic control. They were di-\nvided into two sets of four quartiles on the basis of their\nand 5.5 percent for those without diabetes. Detailed de-\nscriptions about blood collection and processing are pro-\nvided in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists\nProcedures Manual (21).\nThe self-reported average level of physical activity, in-\ncluding work, housework if a homemaker, and going to and\nattending classes if a student, each day had been divided into\nthree levels: mainly sit, walk a lot, and carry loads or climb\noften.\nParticipants' blood pressure was measured according to\nstandard protocol involving three and sometimes four sys-\ntolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements taken with\na mercury sphygmomanometer in the mobile examination\ncenter on all eligible individuals (21). We defined high blood\npressure as an average systolic blood pressure of 140 or\nmore mmHg or an average diastolic blood pressure of 90\nor more mmHg.\nStatistical analyses\nIn our primary analyses, we estimated the prevalence\nof peripheral insensate neuropathy in the overall nonin-\nstitutionalized US population aged 40 or more years and\nwithin several subgroups. We used SAS, version 9.1, soft-\nware (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) for data\nmanagement and manipulation. Analyses were conducted\nwith SUDAAN, version 9.0.1, software (SUDAAN Sta-\ntistical Software Center, Research Triangle Park, North\nCarolina) to take into account the complex sampling design\nand to obtain representative estimates. For each of the pri-\nmary outcomes, we used the largest sample size available to\nestimate prevalence. We computed 95 percent confidence\nintervals using the critical value for a t distribution with\nTABLE 1.

We applied a\njoinpoint regression model and used the permutation test\nto determine whether there was a change of linear trend for\nage- and race-adjusted prevalences of peripheral insensate\nneuropathy by height (22). The joinpoint and 95 percent\nconfidence interval were calculated by Joinpoint, version\n3.0, freeware (23). We also assessed the significance of in-\nteraction terms between height and other variables and tested\nstatistical hypotheses at the 0.05 level.\nRESULTS\nPersons with diabetes are older than persons without di-\nabetes (p < 0.001).

We\nalso found that being tall was a similarly important risk\nfactor and that this association between height and periph-\neral insensate neuropathy prevalence probably explains the\ndifference in prevalence between men and women. Our\nanalysis of both sexes together found that the age- and\nrace-adjusted peripheral insensate neuropathy prevalence\namong persons in the highest quartile of height was 2.3\ntimes higher than that among those in the second quartile\n(the quartile of height distribution that included adequate\nnumbers of both men and women). Of note, this association\nwas stronger than the association between A1c percent-\nage levels and peripheral insensate neuropathy prevalence\namong persons with diabetes. Our findings suggest that\nheight, particularly when considered in combination with\ncurrent recommendations for screening among persons\nwith diabetes, may help to identify persons at relatively\nhigh risk for peripheral insensate neuropathy. We estimated\nthat 65.6 percent of noninstitutionalized US adults aged\n40 or more years (about 6.6 million people) were at high\nrisk for peripheral insensate neuropathy because they were\ntaller than 175.5 cm or had diagnosed diabetes for more\nthan 7 years. These findings may be useful in the develop-\nment of risk-stratification algorithms to focus peripheral\ninsensate neuropathy screening on persons at high risk for\nthe condition.\nThe pathogenesis of the relation between height and the\nprevalence of peripheral insensate neuropathy remains un-\nclear. It seems unlikely that increased stature has a general-\nized adverse effect on peripheral nerve function since\nsensorineural hearing loss, another form of peripheral defi-\ncit, by contrast, is associated with reduced stature (24). In-\nstead, the association of height with peripheral insensate\nneuropathy may be specific to long nerves of the body. In-\ncreased nerve length is associated with greater axon surface\narea, and any localized injury to an axon may impair the\noverall conduction properties of the nerve. Therefore, per-\nsons with longer nerves (and thus a larger total axon surface\narea) may be at greater risk for neurologic impairment when\nexposed to otherwise equivalent hazards (e.g., constant con-\ncentration of advanced glycation end products). Greater leg\nlength might also be associated with a prolonged time re-\nquirement for the complete regeneration of any injured\nnerve (25); this would tend to increase the duration of pe-\nripheral insensate neuropathy, thus increasing the preva-\nlence of peripheral insensate neuropathy in the population.\nAlternatively, the association of height with peripheral in-\nsensate neuropathy might be related to the increased hydro-\nstatic pressure experienced in the feet of tall persons when\nthey stand up. Peripheral insensate neuropathy would occur\nmore often if aging or prolonged diabetes is linked to a\nloss of compensatory responses to large pressure changes\nin small blood vessels. Yet another alternative explanation\ncould be related to greater skin thickness or other protective\ncharacteristics on the soles of tall people. This would be\nconsistent with our finding that peripheral insensate neu-\nropathy prevalence is related to weight among nondiabetic\npersons even after adjustment for height and other covari-\nates (table 2).\nIn addition, Harris et al. (26) showed that height was not\nassociated with extremity symptomatic neuropathy. Sorensen\net al. (7) demonstrated that only 11.7 percent of persons\nwith lower extremity insensate neuropathy defined by vi-\nbration perception threshold had lower foot painful neurop-\nathy. In this latter study, height was related to insensate\nneuropathy but not related to painful neuropathy. These data\nsuggest that sensate neuropathy may be different from in-\nsensate neuropathy and perhaps less associated with struc-\ntural nerve damage.\nThere were limitations to our study. First, because\nNHANES does not collect information from people in nurs-\ning homes or other similar institutions, our subjects were not\nrepresentative of the entire older US population. Second,\n``duration of diabetes'' as measured in this study did not\nreflect the true duration of the disease but the time since\ndiagnosis, and actual diabetes onset might precede its di-\nagnosis by several years (27). Third, there were not enough\nwomen taller than 170 cm to reliably determine the periph-\neral insensate neuropathy prevalence among them. Fourth,\nbecause this was a cross-sectional study, we could not de-\ntermine whether the association between modifiable risk\nfactors and the risk of peripheral insensate neuropathy was\na cause-effect association. This may explain why we did not\nfind smoking to be associated with an increased risk of\nperipheral insensate neuropathy as the authors of a previous\nstudy did (8). Fifth, although persons with significant cal-\nluses had been excluded from the study, NHANES did not\nhave detailed information about calluses. Finally, we used\nmonofilament testing to determine the peripheral insensate\nneuropathy status of study subjects when electrophysio-\nlogic, nerve conduction, or skin biopsy studies could have\nproduced more accurate diagnostic data; however, in epide-\nmiologic studies, monofilament testing is still an improve-\nment over the use of symptom questionnaires in terms of\nsensitivity, specificity, and capacity to predict adverse out-\nIn conclusion, we found that body height is a risk factor\nof peripheral insensate neuropathy, that the difference in\nheight between men and women may explain much of the\ndifference in peripheral insensate neuropathy prevalence\nbetween them, and that peripheral insensate neuropathy\nprevalence increases sharply with height at a height thresh-\nold of around 175.5 cm.
