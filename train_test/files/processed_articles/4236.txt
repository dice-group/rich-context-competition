H. Kim,\nChinese immigrants (Statistics Canada, 2007). Korean immi-\ngrants came to Canada in increasing numbers over the past\ntwo decades, and they now represent 0.3% of the total\nCanadian population. However, the size of the Korean\nCanadian population is increasing faster with a growth rate\nof 53%, compared to 19% growth in the Chinese Canadian\npopulation and only 4% growth for the general population\nIn Ontario, 90% of Korean Canadians and Chinese\nCanadians reside in four of the fourteen health regions within\nthe province: Mississauga Halton, Toronto Central, Central,\nand Central East (Ontario Association of Community Care\nAccess Centers, 2010). These regions have clusters of\nChinese or Korean neighborhoods providing access to infor-\nmal support networks with shared cultural heritages.\nHowever, formal service providers may also provide culture-\nspecific services (e.g., Chinese- and Korean-speaking care\ncoordinators). In other regions of Ontario, these useful ser-\nvices may not be readily available.\nAcculturation\nImmigrants become more acculturated to a host culture over\ntime, but only when it occurs at young age (Cheung, Chudek,\n& Heine, 2011). Better language acquisition among young\nimmigrants is an important contributor to this adaptation\n(Hakuta, Bialystok, & Wiley, 2003). Conversely, immigra-\ntion later in life is stressful because of cultural adjustments\nand language barriers that are likely to be more severe (Mui,\ncation difficulties, lack of social resources, and feelings of\ndetachment in the society may affect adaptation to the host\nenvironment (Bernstein, Park, Shin, Cho, & Park, 2011;\nElderly Asian immigrants often lack information and prepa-\nration to adjust to the major changes in cultural norms and\nimmigrants and 10% of Chinese immigrants are aged above\n1University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nByung Wook Chang, School of Public Health and Health Systems,\nUniversity of Waterloo, 200 University Avenue West, Waterloo, Ontario,\nEmail: bwchang@uwaterloo.ca\nA Cross-Sectional Study to Compare\nCaregiver Distress Among Korean\nCanadian, Chinese Canadian, and Other\nCanadian Home Care Clients\nByung Wook Chang1 and John P.

Korean culture, based on familism, is strongly kin-\nship-oriented and discourages individual needs and desires\ncore value of family obligation involves the Confucian tradi-\nRoh, 2010), which emphasizes that children must respect\nand give thoughtful attention to their elders for giving birth\nand rearing them into adulthood (Han, Choi, Kim, Lee, &\n2007). Thus, institutionalization or receiving external health\nor social services may be viewed negatively in this culture\nues promote an intense moral obligation to support aged par-\nents. In addition, Asian culture values stoicism and patience,\nwhich encourages keeping feelings in rather than expressing\nthem and experiencing sorrow silently (Pang, 1995).\nCultural Values and Immigration\nImmigrants experience cultural changes as a result of the\nprocess of acculturation or the interaction between the origi-\nculture, unlike Korean culture, emphasizes individualistic\nlifestyles and values independence and personal freedom\nSpence, 1985). Some North American studies suggest that a\ncontinuation of traditional Korean values after immigration\nencourages families to care for and live with their aged par-\nYoo & Kim, 2010). However, there is also evidence of\nchanges in values toward a greater focus on independence,\nautonomy, and youth (Wong, Yoo, & Stewart, 2006; Yoo,\n2014). The likelihood of this change is affected by the age at\nimmigration, the length of exposure to lifestyles of other cul-\ntures, and education levels (Hyun, 2001). As more adult chil-\ndren integrate into Western society, one might expect the use\nof formal health care services such as home care to increase\namong older Koreans.\nDespite these changes, there is clear evidence that family\nmembers still provide substantial levels of support to elderly\nfamily members living with them to avoid reliance on out-\nLee, Yoon, & Kropf, 2007). Family members caring for older\nadults may experience caregiver distress in the form of phys-\nical, psychological, emotional, social, and financial stress\n& Singh, 2010). The likelihood of caregiver distress has been\nshown to be related to cognitive and functional status of the\nMany studies, regarding the gender differences, cultural\npredictors, use of formal services, and service barriers, have\nbeen conducted on Chinese Canadian caregivers (Chappell\nof studies are available for Korean Canadian caregivers. A\nfew studies investigate living arrangements and social sup-\nport for older Korean immigrants (A. H. Kim, 2010;\non Korean informal caregiver distress in Canada (Jun, 2005).\nResearch Questions\nThe Andersen\u00adNewman behavioral model of use of health\nservices postulates that culture and ethnicity is one of the\npredisposing factors that can affect health service use\n(Andersen, 1995). Thus, the traditional culture and the pro-\ncess of acculturation would be expected to have important\nimplications for the use of health services by Korean immi-\ngrants. The key questions of interest in the present study are\nwhether Korean Canadian home care clients differ in their\nlevels of need, access to services, and rates of caregiver dis-\ntress compared with Chinese Canadians and the general pop-\nulation of home care clients.\nAlthough the present study will not test for the causal\npathways between access to health service and cultural val-\nues, it will provide the most detailed Canadian data available\nto date on characteristics associated with differences in ser-\nvice use and caregiver distress among the two main subpopu-\nlations of Asian Canadians.\nChinese Canadian clients were selected as a comparison\ngroup because they have some similarities to Koreans in\nterms of norms related to filial piety, community orienta-\ntion, and religious/cultural heritage. However, there are also\nimportant differences between these groups that suggest\nthey should not be combined a priori as a homogeneous cul-\ntural minority (e.g., recency of migration, size of diaspora in\nCanada).\nMethod\nSample\nThis study was based on secondary analyses of de-identified\ndata for all long-stay home care clients assessed as part of\nnormal clinical practice by health professionals in 14 Ontario\nCommunity CareAccess Centers (CCAC) using the Resident\nAssessment Instrument\u00adHome Care (RAI-HC; Canadian\nInstitute for Health Information, 2014b). CCAC are single\nentry point agencies funded by the Ontario Ministry of\nChang and Hirdes 3\nHealth and Long-Term Care that evaluate the need for and\nprovide access to the care that vulnerable persons need in\nhome and community settings. RAI-HC assessments exam-\nined here were completed between January 2002 and\nDecember 2010. Personal identifiers, such as name and\nhealth card number, were stripped from the record or\nencrypted in a way that would prevent identification prior to\nthe transmission of the data to the research group, and unique\nclient identifiers were given by the Ontario Association of\nCCAC. For all CCAC clients, assessments were performed\nby trained health professionals (e.g., care coordinators and\nnurses) as part of the standard clinical practice done on\nadmission and thereafter every 6 months or on significant\nclinical change. Missing data were generally not a major\nconcern given that the assessment is a mandatory require-\nment and the data were used by multiple stakeholders who\nrequire complete data.\nThe study sample was drawn from the population of all\nlong-stay home care clients admitted during the study period\n(N = 705,922). Using a variable for primary language, it was\npossible to identify clients whose primary language was\ngroups were retained for the present study to maximize the\npower to detect differences for each subgroup compared with\nthe general population. However, given that the other home\ncare clients included almost 690,000 cases, a subset was ran-\ndomly selected to yield a comparison group of 46,032 clients\nwho had a primary language other than Chinese or Korean. A\nguideline of 4 times greater than the largest subgroup\n(Chinese Canadians) was used to set the sample size for the\ncomparison group, which is consistent with methods used in\nthe case-control literature (Grimes & Schulz, 2005).\nData Source\nRAI-HC is a person-centered assessment system developed\nfor use with adults in home and community-based settings\nthat has been shown to have good reliability and validity\nCarpenter, Berg, & Jones, 1997). The instrument focuses on\nthe person's functioning and quality of life by assessing\nneeds, strengths, and preferences in a broad range of domains\nconsisting of more than 300 items.\nTwo RAI-HC items were used to define caregiver dis-\ntress: \"A caregiver is unable to continue in caring activities,\ne.g., decline in the health of the caregiver makes it difficult\nto continue,\" and \"Primary caregiver expresses feelings of\ndistress, anger, or depression.\" The presence of either of\nthese indicators was considered indicative of potential dis-\ntress. Although the first indicator may be caused by other\nfactors (e.g., aging of the caregiver), it will also include\nhealth declines associated with caregiver burden. These\nitems on caregiver distress have been used previously to\ndevelop the Method for Assigning Priority Levels (MAPLe)\ndecision support algorithm for prioritization of home care\nclients' access to community and facility-based health ser-\nvices (Hirdes, Poss, & Curtin-Telegdi, 2008).\nEthnicity was obtained from the RAI-HC assessment\nitem on preferred language. Care coordinators completing\nthe assessment used standard language codes provided by\nthe Canadian Institute for Health Information as part of the\nHome Care Reporting System technical specification\n(Canadian Institute for Health Information, 2014a). In addi-\ntion, the \"need for an interpreter\" item was assessed directly\nbased on the client's or caregiver's response; hence, it was\nnot inferred from the client's ethnicity.\nThe items describing the profile of health and health\nservice use for Korean Canadians, Chinese Canadians, and\nother Canadians were chosen based on a paper by Hirdes,\nMitchell, Maxwell, and White (2011). These items are\ncommonly used to describe health status and health service\nuse.\nSeveral summary scales can be derived from RAI-HC\nassessments to described a client's health and functional sta-\ntus. The Activities of Daily Living Hierarchy (ADLH) Scale\nmeasures physical disability, with scores ranging from 0 (no\nimpairment) to 6 (total dependence) by considering perfor-\nmance in early loss (e.g., dressing) to late loss (e.g., eating)\nMorris et al., 1997). The Changes in Health, End-stage dis-\nease and Signs and Symptoms (CHESS) Scale identifies\nindividuals at risk of serious health decline, with scores rang-\ning from 0 (not at all unstable) to 5 (highly unstable;\nArmstrong, Stolee, Hirdes, & Poss, 2010; Hirdes, Frijters, &\nTeare, 2003). The Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS) is\nbased on memory impairment, level of consciousness, and\nexecutive function, with scores ranging from 0 (intact) to 6\n(very severe impairment; Landi et al., 2000; Morris et al.,\n1994). The Depression Rating Scale (DRS) screens for\ndepressive symptoms with values ranging from 0 (no depres-\nsive symptoms) to 14 (severe depressive symptoms; Burrows,\nMorris, Simon, Hirdes, & Phillips, 2000; Szczerbiska,\nHirdes, & Zyczkowska, 2011). The Instrumental ADL capac-\nity (IADL) Scale, which ranges from 0 to 6, considers meal\npreparation, ordinary housework, and phone use, with higher\nscores indicating greater difficulty in IADL (Morris,\nCarpenter, Berg, & Jones, 2000). The interRAI Pain Scale\nuses frequency and intensity of pain to create a score from 0\nto 3 (Fries, Simon, Morris, Flodstrom, & Bookstein, 2001).\nFinally, the Method for Assigning Priority Levels (MAPLe)\ndecision support algorithm ranges from low to very high\nwith higher scores indicating greater needs. MAPLe has\nbeen shown to predict nursing home placement, caregiver\ndistress, and ratings that the \"client would be better off in\nother living environment\" in many different international\njurisdictions (Hirdes, Poss et al., 2008). MAPLe has also\nbeen validated as a predictor of institutionalization from\nacute hospital settings (Noro et al., 2011). Hence, all scales\nused in the present analyses have good reliability and valid-\nity, and are positively associated with impairment (Morris\n4 SAGE Open\nin Asian countries have also reported similar results (see, for\nScores on the summary scales were divided into different\ncategories using cutoffs previously used by Hirdes et al.\n(2011). These scale cutoffs were specified prior to examining\ncaregiver distress.\nRAI-HC has been mandated for use in eight Canadian\nprovinces and territories (Canadian Home Care\nAssociation, 2008). It has been used extensively in other\ncountries including Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway,\nSweden, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, the\nNetherlands, and England (see, for example, Carpenter\napplications for care planning and outcome measurement,\nRAI-HC can also be used for case-mix classification\n(Bj\u00f6rkgren, Fries, & Shugarman, 2000; Poss, Hirdes,\nFries, McKillop, & Chase, 2008) and quality measure-\nEthics Clearance\nEthics clearance for secondary analysis of the data was\nobtained through the University of Waterloo, Office of\nHuman Research.\nStatistical Analysis\nTo provide a descriptive profile of the health of elderly\nKorean Canadians in home care, data were analyzed first to\nobtain percentage and frequency distributions. Bivariate dif-\nferences in socio-demographic, clinical, caregiving, and\nhealth service use characteristics by ethnicity were evaluated\nwith chi-square analysis using a two-tailed test with an alpha\nlevel of .05. In addition, temporal effects were examined\nusing 2002 as a reference year, but no significant differences\nwere found over time in the key dependent variable of inter-\nest (caregiver distress).\nThe bivariate analyses reported in Tables 1 to 4 were used\nto identify how the three cultural groups differed with respect\nto important clinical and service use variables. The MAPLe\nalgorithm in Table 5 provides a risk adjustment variable that\nincorporates most of the important clinical scales and items\nreferred to in the earlier tables.\nTo investigate the risk factors for caregiver distress, crude\nand adjusted odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence\nintervals (CI) for caregiver distress were obtained from mul-\ntiple logistic regression models. Summary scales were\ntreated as continuous variables when tested in models. All\nstatistical analyses were performed using SAS software\nResults\nTable 1 shows the percentage of home care clients with\nselected socio-demographic, diagnostic, and health charac-\nteristics by language group. In this and subsequent tables, the\nlarge sample sizes result in relatively modest differences\nbeing statistically significant, although they may sometimes\nnot be clinically significant. Therefore, the emphasis here is\nplaced on the larger differences that are clinically significant\nand have relevance for policy or clinical practice. In terms of\noverall characteristics, the Korean Canadians, Chinese\nCanadians, and other Canadian home care clients had a com-\nparable age distribution. However, Korean Canadian clients\nhad a somewhat higher percentage of women, and Korean\nCanadian and Chinese Canadian males were substantially\nmore likely to be married than other male home care clients.\nThe distributions of medical diagnoses were relatively com-\nparable across the three groups, except Korean Canadian and\nChinese Canadian clients had notably lower rates of heart\nfailure than other clients. On the other hand, Chinese\nCanadian clients had the highest rates of other cardiovascular\ndiseases (53.8%, p < .01). Korean Canadian clients had\nand higher rates of unsteady gait (62.5%, p < .001) compared\nwith the other groups. In addition, Korean Canadian and\nChinese Canadian clients were less likely to walk or bathe\nindependently compared with other clients. Loss of appetite\n(15%, p < .001) was most common in the Korean Canadian\nclients, and trouble swallowing was about double the rate in\nKorean Canadians (15.9%) and Chinese Canadians (19%)\nMoreover, Korean Canadian clients had the highest rates of\nmental health symptoms such as anxiety symptoms, delir-\nium, any aggressive behavior, and hallucinations or delu-\nsions. The rates of expressive and receptive deficits in\ncommunication were also highest in Korean Canadian\nclients.\nThree indicators were used to assess social variables:\n\"Made economic trade-offs,\" \"Conflict with others,\" and\n\"Social isolation.\" Korean Canadian clients were about twice\nas likely to make economic trade-offs among purchasing\nfood, medication, housing, and necessary medical care com-\npared with the other two groups. In addition, rates of social\nisolation were comparable among the three groups, but \"con-\nflict with others\" was most common in the Korean Canadian\nclients. The most dramatic difference across groups was the\nneed for translation, where about 80% of Korean Canadians\nand Chinese Canadians needed an interpreter compared with\nTable 2 provides the distribution of selected informal\ncaregiving variables by language group. The rates of care-\ngiver distress were highest in the Korean Canadian clients\nKorean Canadians and Chinese Canadians were much less\nlikely to live alone or to live only with their spouse compared\nChang and Hirdes 5\nwith other clients. On the other hand, both minority groups\nwere about twice as likely as other home care clients to either\n\"live with their spouse and child\" or \"live with their child\nonly.\" Similarly, Korean Canadian and Chinese Canadian\nclients were also much more likely to live with their primary\nand secondary caregivers than other clients. Both the pri-\nmary and secondary caregivers were more likely to be a child\nthan in other home care clients; however, they were also sub-\nstantially less likely to have caregivers who were other rela-\ntives or friend/neighbors.\nTable 1.

Korean Canadian clients had the highest\nindicating a moderate or worse impairment in cognition.\nWith respect to ADL impairment, they had about twice the\nproportion of moderate or worse functional status compared\nwith other home care clients (about 18% compared with\n10%, respectively, p < .001). Similarly, Korean Canadian\nand Chinese Canadian home care clients' IADL capacity\nscale scores indicated higher rates of impairment in instru-\nmental activities than other clients. These differences are\nalso reflected in the MAPLe algorithm, which is a composite\nmeasure combining factors such as ADL impairment, cogni-\ntion, falls, IADL, and behavior. Korean Canadians had the\nlargest proportion in the two highest MAPLe categories\nother clients.\nTable 4 provides the percentage of home care clients\nreceiving selected health services and clinical interventions\nby ethnicity. A somewhat higher percentage of Korean\nCanadian clients received occupational therapy (19.1%, p <\n.05), but they were less likely to receive personal support or\nChinese Canadian and other clients. There were only modest\ndifferences between groups in emergency visits and hospital-\nizations; however, Korean Canadian and Chinese Canadian\nclients were much less likely to receive medical interven-\ntions such as oxygen therapy, nurse monitoring, and wound\ncare. In addition, both groups had a much lower rate of use of\npsychotropic medications (except antipsychotics) than other\nhome care clients.\nTable 5 presents the results for various multiple logistic\nregression models investigating the associations of ethnicity\nand the need for an interpreter with caregiver distress. The\nmodels also adjust for other factors that may be associated\nwith caregiver distress including MAPLe, age, sex, marital\nstatus, and receipt of personal support services. When their\nmain effects are considered alone, the language variable was\nsignificantly associated with caregiver distress with or with-\nout the adjustments for other covariates (Korean Canadian\nbe Chinese Canadians rather than the general home care pop-\nulation, the CI for Korean Canadian clients overlapped with\n1.00 slightly, and the p value was .07, indicating that the dif-\nference between the two Asian groups did not quite meet the\n0.05 level of significance, although both clearly had higher\nrates of distress than the general home care population.\nChang and Hirdes 7\nThe need for an interpreter was also significantly associ-\nated with caregiver distress with or without adjustments for\nwhen both variables were introduced as covariates in the\ncaregiver distress model, the language variable was no lon-\nger significant but the interpreter needed variable remained\ners were significant irrespective of order of entry to the\nmodel, and statistical tests of collinearity indicated that this\nwas not a major concern for these variables. Indeed, given\nthat ethnicity and need for an interpreter are not indicators of\nthe same underlying concept, they should not be considered\nto be multicollinear items.\nThe analysis shows that it is the language barrier and\nnot \"Chinese-ness or Korean-ness\" that is a key factor\nassociated with caregiver distress. Interactions between\nethnicity and the need for an interpreter were also tested.\nThese interactions were found to be significant, and the\nadjusted ORs are shown in Figure 1. For all three different\nethnic clients, the need for an interpreter was associated\nwith a higher level of caregiver distress. For those who do\nnot need an interpreter, Korean Canadian clients had\nsomewhat lower odds of distress and Chinese Canadians\nhad higher odds of distress compared with the general\npopulation of home care clients. On the other hand, the\nodds of caregiver distress were highest among Korean\nCanadian clients requiring an interpreter.\nFigure 2 shows the rates of caregiver distress by MAPLe\npriority levels and cultural groups. For all three groups,\nMAPLe is clearly associated with an increased rate of\ncaregiver distress. In addition, the rates of distress are\nhigher within MAPLe levels for the Korean Canadian and\nClinical Scale\n% (n) % (n) % (n)\nCognitive\nPerformance Scale\nDepression Rating\nScale\nNote.

They also had notably higher levels of\nfunctional and cognitive impairments than other home care\nclients. Despite their higher need for support services, Korean\nCanadians were less likely to receive personal supports/\nhomemaking and home nursing. These results suggest the\npossibility that they begin to receive help from formal ser-\nvices too late, and consequently, their caregivers experience\nFigure 1. Adjusted odd ratios for caregiver distress by ethnicity and need for an interpreter (Yes/No), Ontario, 2002-2010.\nFigure 2. Percentage of home care clients with a distressed caregiver by ethnicity and MAPLe level, Ontario, 2002-2010.\nNote. MAPLe = Method for Assigning Priority Levels.\nhigh levels of distress. It is also clear that language barriers\nare a major risk factor to elevated distress in both cultural\ngroups examined here.\nAs one might expect based on Confucian values, higher\npercentages of children took care of and lived with the\nKorean Canadian and Chinese Canadian clients compared\nwith the general home care population. These living arrange-\nments may have allowed for the exchange of intergenera-\ntional support (e.g., grandparents may have provided child\ncare in the home to allow both parents to work). Prior sup-\nport by grandparents may therefore be repaid by assistance\nfrom their children as they become frailer in later life.\nHowever, with increased female labor force participation, it\nmay be stressful for employed adult children in multigenera-\ntional households to provide care to both their children and\nelderly parents.\nKorean Canadian and Chinese Canadian clients were less\nlikely to have emergency visits and hospitalizations. These\nlower rates may mean that they are being managed well at\nhome. On the other hand, these findings may also demon-\nstrate the stoicism that delays seeking help for pain or dis-\ncomfort caused by health conditions. It is also possible that\nEastern medicines and therapies might be used instead of\nconventional health care services. Finally, some elders may\navoid visits to emergency departments because of language\nbarriers that discourage the service use.\nIt is also clear from this study that there were high rates of\ninformal caregiver distress in these groups, indicating that\nthese caregivers are not impervious to the challenges of sup-\nporting relatives with heavy care needs. Korean Canadian\nclients had the highest unadjusted rate of caregiver distress\namong these ethnic clients, a finding that is consistent with\nthose reported by other studies (E. E. Lee & Farran, 2004).\nThis difference was due, at least in part, to the substantially\nhigher levels of impairments evident in the Korean Canadian\nclients. However, compared with the general population,\nrates of caregiver distress were higher in both cultural groups\nafter adjusting for need and socio-demographic factors.\nThe present results also point to the critical importance of\nlanguage barriers for home care clients and their caregivers.\nOther studies have reported that language barriers were the\nmost frequently experienced and the most common adapta-\ntion difficulties among immigrants (Koh & Bell, 1987; Mui,\ndemonstrate that these difficulties carry over to the experi-\nence of informal caregivers. In fact, the multivariable logistic\nregression analyses indicated that the significance of ethnic\ndifferences disappears when the need for an interpreter is\nincluded. Thus, targeting language barriers can be a start in\nreducing distress experienced by home care clients and care-\ngivers from cultural minorities. However, if these needs are\nnot properly met or managed, they can lead to social isola-\ntions and other barriers in living in the community.\nConsequently, addressing language issues is a fundamental\nrequirement for any home care agency serving clients in a\nmulticultural society.\nOne of the objectives of this study was to investigate the\nrisk factors for caregiver distress of families caring for the\nelderly members. After controlling for clinical indicators of\nneed, the main risk factor that affected caregiver distress was\nthe need for an interpreter for the clients. Lack of language\nsupport such as translation services can be discriminatory to\nminority groups who do not speak the official language of\nthe dominant culture. The failure of government to provide\nsuch services can exacerbate health outcomes in these popu-\nlations (Woloshin, Bickell, Schwartz, Gany, & Welch, 1995).\nLanguage barriers can influence understanding and absorp-\ntion of information leading to social isolation and causing\npsychosocial distress and health declines in the elderly indi-\nviduals who immigrated later in life (Colenda & Smith,\nMoreover, language barriers impair social function, a prob-\nlem that may in turn lower self-esteem, a sense of security\nand control, access to important information, ability to make\nfriends, and participate in the community (Antle, 2004).\nThe findings related to the MAPLe algorithm are also of\ninterest because they demonstrate that it continues to be a\npredictor of caregiver distress within cultural groups.\nTherefore, home care agencies serving diverse populations\nmay be reassured that the algorithm indicates need for ser-\nvices to be provided in a manner that is not culturally con-\nstrained. The higher levels of distress within MAPLe levels\namong Korean Canadian and Chinese Canadian clients were\nno longer significant after adjusting for the need for an inter-\npreter. This suggests that home care agencies should provide\nservices that target the dimensions of need operationalized\nby the MAPLe algorithm, and they must do so in a manner\nthat is sensitive to cultural and linguistic considerations.\nFor multicultural societies, it is essential to account for\nlinguistic diversity as part of health and social service deliv-\nery. Cultural competence should be a basic requirement for\nhome care workers and other health care providers, but prac-\ntical provisions to deal with language barriers are also funda-\nmental considerations. Language barriers may pose important\nproblems for issues such as health literacy, awareness of ser-\nvice options, self-determination, self-esteem, and compli-\nance with treatment regimens (Damron-Rodriguez, Wallace,\nFinally, it is important to underline that language barriers\nare important considerations not only for Korean Canadian\nand Chinese Canadian clients, but also for other linguistic\nminorities. The increased distress associated with the need for\nan interpreter was also evident within the comparison group\nof other home care clients. Hence, this is not a problem unique\nto Canadians of Asian origin. However, there are only a lim-\nited number of governmental language training programs that\ntarget older immigrants in Canada (Immigrant Settlement &\nIntegration Services, 2010). Thus, governments should pro-\nvide supports to reach out to isolated minority populations of\nolder adults to prevent further deterioration of their health,\nenhance their quality of life, and support caregivers, making a\nvaluable social and economic contribution to society.\nLimitations\nThe cross-sectional nature of the data set used here limits\none's ability to make causal inferences in these findings, but\nthe multidimensional nature of the RAI-HC assessment per-\nmitted adjustments for many different potential confounders.\nSecond, there may be errors involved in the ascertainment of\nclinical characteristics such as depressive symptoms or care-\ngiver distress, which in turn may have weakened some asso-\nciations of interest. However, Chi (2011) argued that the\ninterRAI instruments are well-suited for cross-cultural\nassessment of the needs of older adults. Third, fluency in\nother languages was not considered because only the primary\nlanguage was assessed in the RAI-HC. Fourth, the ascertain-\nment of caregiver distress was a binary variable, so the sub-\njective severity of the distress cannot be determined beyond\nits presence or absence. However, other articles have used\nthe same variable to examine caregiver distress (Hirdes,\nFreeman, Smith, & Stolee, 2012; Hirdes, Poss, & Curtin-\nTelegdi, 2008). Fifth, the immigrant sample being investi-\ngated involved only those who were part of long-stay home\ncare programs. Thus, the results may not be generalizable to\ncommunity-dwelling Korean Canadian and Chinese\nCanadian older adults not receiving formal home care\nservices.\nDespite these limitations, the present study suggests that\nKorean Canadian home care clients have higher impair-\nments, but receive fewer services than other clients. Korean\nCanadians are one of the most rapidly increasing immigrant\npopulations in Canada. Therefore, the need to respond to the\nsystematic barriers identified here will likely grow over time.\n"
