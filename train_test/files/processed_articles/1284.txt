Blood levels of VOCs may be more indicative of per-\nsonal exposures than are air concentrations; no studies have addressed their relationship with\nrespiratory outcomes.\nOBJECTIVE: We examined whether concentrations of 11 VOCs that were commonly identified in\nblood from a sample of the U.S. population were associated with pulmonary function.\nMETHODS: We used data from 953 adult participants (20\u00ad59 years of age) in the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988\u00ad1994) who had VOC blood measures as well as\npulmonary function measures. Linear regression models were used to evaluate the relationship\nbetween 11 VOCs and measures of pulmonary function.\nRESULTS: After adjustment for smoking, only 1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4-DCB) was associated with\nreduced pulmonary function. Participants in the highest decile of 1,4-DCB concentration had\ndecrements of \u00ad153 mL [95% confidence interval (CI), \u00ad297 to \u00ad8] in forced expiratory volume in\nwith participants in the lowest decile.\nCONCLUSIONS: Exposure to 1,4-DCB, a VOC related to the use of air fresheners, toilet bowl deodor-\nants, and mothballs, at levels found in the U.S. general population, may result in reduced pulmonary\nfunction. This common exposure may have long-term adverse effects on respiratory health.\nKEY WORDS: air fresheners, air pollution (indoor), deodorants, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, exposure, envi-\nronmental exposure, FEV1\n, lung function, respiratory function tests, VOC.

In the Priority Toxicant Reference\nRange Study, 32 VOCs were measured in\nblood, using purge and trap gas chromatogra-\nphy/mass spectrometry as previously described\nVOCs with median values above the limit of\nacetone, benzene, ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene,\no-xylene, styrene, tetrachloroethene, toluene].\nOf the 953 participants who had a value for at\nleast 1 of 11 VOCs and who had acceptable\npulmonary function data, sample sizes varied\nfor some VOCs were not available for all par-\nticipants (NCHS 2001). Although the reasons\nfor different sample sizes are not given in the\nNHANES III documentation, it is possible\nthat some blood samples failed to meet accept-\nability standards or were invalid due to clot-\nting, or that the laboratory experienced\nproblems with instruments or quality control\nStatistical analyses. We used ordinary\nleast-squares regression models to evaluate the\nassociation between each VOC and each pul-\nmonary function outcome. For samples with\nVOC measures below the limit of detection, a\nvalue equal to the detection limit divided by\nthe square root of 2 was assigned (NCHS\n2000). We used natural log transformations of\nVOC concentrations to reduce the influence\nof their skewed distributions on the regression\nmodel estimates. We used Wilcoxon rank-sum\ntests to compare VOC median values between\ntwo groups and Kruskal-Wallis tests to com-\npare values among three or more groups. We\nperformed tests for linear trends across deciles\nusing one-way analysis of variance. We con-\nducted all analyses using SAS (version 9.0;\nSAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Weighting is\nnot recommended for analysis of data from\nthe Priority Toxicant Reference Range Study\nFor descriptive purposes, we first analyzed\nVOCs in relation to pulmonary function with-\nout adjustment for smoking. However, because\nsmoking and environmental tobacco smoke are\nsources of VOCs and also affect pulmonary\nfunction, we then added terms for smoking\nstatus (current, quit within the previous 12\nmonths, quit more than 12 months previously,\nnever), number of cigarettes smoked per day\n(continuous), years smoked (continuous), and\nserum cotinine level (continuous). Smoking\nwas a confounder for most VOCs.\nWe then used a change-in-estimate\nmethod to evaluate additional variables as con-\nfounders for the VOCs still related to pul-\nmonary function after adjustment for smoking\n(Greenland 1989). Our cutoff criterion was a\n10% change in the VOC -coefficient in rela-\ntion to pulmonary function. In this manner,\nwe assessed the following potential con-\nfounders: socioeconomic status (education,\npoverty:income ratio, use of food stamps\nwithin the previous 12 months), self-reported\ndoctor diagnosis of emphysema, use of fireplace\nwithin the previous 12 months or wood or gas\nstove for heating or cooking, age of the house\n1974 to present), presence of furred pets at\nhome, and occupational exposure. Occupational\nexposure (yes, no) was indicated by a variable\ndenoting occupations associated with chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in this\npopulation (Hnizdo et al. 2002). The only fac-\ntor that met the criterion for confounding was\nself-reported doctor diagnosis of emphysema,\nand this was included in the final models. We\nrepeated analyses excluding people with self-\nreported doctor diagnosis of asthma, and the\nresults were not changed appreciably.\nResults\nCharacteristics of the study population are\nTable 2 shows distributions of the 11\nVOCs with median values above the limit of\nVOCs and pulmonary function in NHANES III\nTable 1.

Likewise, 1,4-DCB was inversely\nassociated with all four measures within each of\nthe race groupings, although numbers become\nunstable. Numbers are further reduced within\nthe six race/sex groups, but 1,4-DCB was\ninversely related to at least one of the four pul-\nmonary function measures in each of the six\nsubgroups. The results were strongest and sta-\ntistically significant for non-Hispanic white\nfemales (FEV1\nAfrican-American males (FEV1\n0.01), although we did not find significant evi-\ndence of effect modification by race/sex combi-\nnations (multiple partial F-test, p > 0.10 for all\npulmonary function outcomes).\nHigher levels of 1,4-DCB were related to\nreduced pulmonary function in never-smokers\nas well as smokers (Table 4). Results for\nnever-smokers were similar when we defined\nnonsmokers in a more stringent manner as\nhaving serum cotinine < 0.62 ng/mL, the\ndata not shown).\nTo further examine the relationship\nbetween 1,4-DCB and pulmonary function,\nwe conducted additional analyses using uri-\nnary concentrations of 2,5-dichlorophenol\n(2,5-DCP), the major metabolite of 1,4-DCB\npesticide metabolites measured in the urine of\nNHANES III participants, using capillary gas\nchromatography and tandem mass spectrome-\nmeasurements were available only on 534 of the\nDCB, the -coefficients for both compounds\nwere inversely related to all pulmonary function\nmeasures, and the result for FEV1\nwas more sta-\ntistically precise.

Except for ace-\ntone and 2-butanone, that study measured\nthe same VOCs we included in our analyses.\nAlthough VOCs generally do not persist in\nthe blood after termination of acute exposure\n(Ashley and Prah 1997), after frequent pro-\nlonged exposures, blood concentrations can\nreflect chronic exposures (Ashley and Prah\nuptake and elimination of some VOCs has sug-\ngested that bioaccumulation may occur in mul-\ntiple storage sites in the human body (Ashley\nand Prah 1997). In the SHIELD study, the\nbetween-child variability of 1,4-DCB blood\nconcentrations greatly exceeded the within-\nchild variability (ratio = 434), suggesting that\none blood measurement of 1,4-DCB is a good\nindication of an individual's blood concentra-\ntion over time. In contrast, other VOCs had\nmuch lower ratios of between- and within-child\nvariability; for example, the next highest were\nfor TCE (ratio = 2), ethylbenzene (ratio ~ 1),\nand 1,1,1-TCE (ratio ~ 1). The high ratio\nof between- to within-child variability for\n1,4-DCB was not seen in the younger children\nof the Developmental   on Attention\nand Memory Skills (DREAMS) study, but far\nfewer children had more than one blood sample\nto estimate the ratio of within- to between-child\nvariability (e.g., 126 in the SHIELD study\ncompared with 22 in the DREAMS study)\nApart from the findings in the SHIELD\nstudy (Sexton et al. 2005a), little is known\nabout the relationship between personal\n1,4-DCB exposures and blood concentrations.\nBased on data from a graph of this relationship\nin children (Sexton et al. 2005a), we estimate\nthat a 1,4-DCB blood concentration of 10\n\u00b5g/L may correspond to personal exposures of\n102 \u00b5g/m3 or greater, which is close to the pro-\nposed chronic duration minimal risk limit\n(120 \u00b5g/m3) [Agency for Toxic Substances and\nDisease Registry (ATSDR) 2004]. Blood levels\nof 1,4-DCB were higher in children from the\nSHIELD study than in the NHANES III\nadults we studied. For example, the 95th per-\ncentile was 11.03 \u00b5g/L for NHANES III and\nDCB air concentrations can be extrapolated\nfrom blood concentrations, it is possible that\nthe highest blood concentrations of 1,4-DCB\nin NHANES III represent exposures to air\nconcentrations greater than the proposed\nchronic duration minimal risk limit.\nPeople who use air fresheners, toilet bowl\ndeodorants, and mothballs have potential for\nhigh exposure to 1,4-DCB because it is an\nimportant component of these products\nHowever, exposure also occurs in the absence\nof these products as the compound is com-\nmon in indoor environments.

According to other measures, levels in\nsome homes and public restrooms may reach\nis greater than the minimal risk limit for\nchronic exposure.\nThe chronic duration minimal risk limit is\nbased on observed eosinophilic changes in the\nolfactory epithelium of rats; no information was\navailable on effects of exposure on pulmonary\nVOCs and pulmonary function in NHANES III\nFigure 1.

For example, air fresheners, toilet bowl\ndeodorants, and mothballs are used until their\nemissions cease, and then they are replaced.\nStaff interviewers in the SHIELD study,\nwhere blood concentrations of 1,4-DCB were\nhigh, noted that many children's homes had\npervasive scents of air fresheners (Sexton et al.\nticipants in the VOC study reported recent\nuse of air fresheners or room deodorizers.\nFewer participants reported recent use of toi-\nlet bowl deodorants (8.7%), although their\nuse was associated with a 2-fold increase in\nodds of having high 1,4-DCB blood levels\nBecause NHANES III is a cross-sectional\nstudy, measurements of exposure and out-\ncome were made at the same time, and it is\nnot possible to determine if 1,4-DCB expo-\nsure preceded pulmonary function decline. A\nlongitudinal study measuring pulmonary\nfunction and exposure to 1,4-DCB at various\ntime points would be necessary to evaluate\nthe temporality of this relationship. Although\nit is possible that people who are exposed to\ntoilet bowl or air fresheners and other room\ndeodorizers might also be exposed to cleaning\nproducts that impair pulmonary function, we\nhad no data to address this.\nThe inverse association between 1,4-DCB\nconcentration and pulmonary function may\nhave been affected by unmeasured con-\nfounders. We assessed the influence of other\nfactors that may be related to pulmonary\nfunction and to 1,4-DCB exposure, such as\ntype of heating, use of wood fires, age of\nhouse, presence of furred pets, occupation,\nsocioeconomic status, presence of environ-\nmental tobacco smoke, smoking history, and\ndiagnosis of asthma or emphysema. Only\nemphysema confounded the relationship\nbetween 1,4-DCB and pulmonary function\ndeficits. The ability to carefully adjust for\nsmoking with several variables, including the\nobjective measure of environmental tobacco\nsmoke exposure, serum cotinine, was a con-\nsiderable strength of our analyses.\nThe size and diversity of this NHANES\nIII sample make it possible to examine the\nrelationships between VOCs and pulmonary\nfunction in more detail than has been possible\nin smaller studies. Our findings suggest that\n1,4-DCB exposure at levels found in the U.S.\ngeneral population may result in decreases\nin pulmonary function.
