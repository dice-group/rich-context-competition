    "abstract": "Abstract\nMultiple individual, social, and environmental factors have long been recognized as influencing a child's response to traumatic\nexperiences. However, there remain few socio-ecological frameworks to guide researchers and practitioners working with\nwar-affected children. This article examines Silove's psychosocial model of adaptation and development after trauma and\npersecution (ADAPT model) in relation to war-affected children. The utility of the model is explored by examining whether\nthe systems of safety, attachment, identity, justice, and existential meaning described in the ADAPT model are represented\nin a narrative review of research from the last 20 years on the experiences of war-affected children and adolescents. Results\nsuggest that research with war-affected children has covered all five psychosocial pillars in the model, but with overemphasis on\nthe safety, followed by the attachment, domains. This review highlights that need for research and psychosocial interventions\nthat focus on adaptation of war-affected children's identity development, sense of justice, and meaning systems.\n",

In the same year, United Nations Children's\nFund's (UNICEF; 1996) \"State of the World's Children\"\nreport estimated that two million children were killed and six\nmillion children were injured or disabled in conflicts in the\ndecade previous to its publication. Although we have since\nadvanced our understanding of the experiences of children\naffected by war, they continue to face significant trauma dur-\ning and after war. Both a10-year strategic review of the\nReport on Children and Armed Conflict\" (United Nations,\n2014) identify ongoing abuses of children in armed conflict,\nincluding sexual assault, abduction, forced participation in\nconflict, attacks on schools, and deprivation of food, basic\nhealth care and education. Such experiences fall within cur-\nrent understandings of traumatizing events which include\nactual or threatened events, including death, serious injury, or\nsexual violence though direct experience, witnessing, hearing\nabout a loved one, or repeated extreme exposure to details\n(American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013). These\nreports underscore the fact that, globally, almost two decades\nlater, many children continue to experience massive physical\nand psychological threats to their well-being.\nDespite this dismal picture, not all children exposed to\nmass violence and trauma develop psychopathology.\nMultiple individual, social, and contextual factors are recog-\nnized as influencing a child's psychosocial response to trau-\nmatic experiences. These include the nature and timing of the\nexperience, social preparation, personality, coping skills,\nsocial and familial support, and secondary stressors. This\nrecognition has resulted in calls to examine trauma and psy-\nchosocial adaptation of war-affected children from ecologi-\ncal perspectives, that is, from the vantage of children's\ndevelopmental level and life contexts (Boothby, 2008;\nGabriano & Kostenly, 1996; Walton, Nuttall, & Nuttall.,\n1997), larger socio-cultural context (Rousseau, Drapeau, &\nprotective factors (Betancourt & Khan, 2008), and time and\ncontext-dependent variables (Attanayake et al., 2009; Tol,\nSong, & Jordans, 2013).

Although some studies refer to\nBronfenbrenner's (1979) socio-ecological framework (e.g.,\nsee Betancourt & Khan, 2008; Saile, Ertl, Neuner, & Catani,\nchildhood trauma. Similarly, research that utilizes develop-\nmental psychopathology models (e.g., see Pynoos, Steinberg,\n& Piacentini, 1999) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\nof Mental Disorders (DSM)/International Classification of\nDiseases (ICD) classification systems do not adequately\naddress collective or mass trauma.\nOne model that shows promise as a general guide or meta-\nmodel in the field of refugee mental health is the adaptation\nand development after trauma and persecution (ADAPT)\nmodel. With its focus on how individuals and society adjust\nto new information and experiences (i.e., adaptation), this\npsychosocial model provides an explanation for both resil-\nient and psychopathological responses to traumatic events. It\nis built on the idea that stability at the individual psychic and\nsocial levels interact and reflect each other through supports\nfrom key psychosocial pillars represented in institutions,\nthe aftermath of war trauma, individuals and communities\nactively defend and maintain these systems of psychosocial\nstability, which include safety, bonds and attachment, justice,\nidentity and roles, and existential meaning. Individual and\ncollective mental health disorders reflect a failure to adapt\nboth individually (i.e. biologically) and in the psychosocial\nenvironment in the aftermath following trauma. Although\nthis model has been presented with adults, it may have poten-\ntial for application to children.\nThis review article examines whether the systems found in\nthe ADAPT model (Silove, 2000) are represented in the body\nof knowledge on the psychosocial experiences and needs of\nwar-affected children and adolescents through an analysis of\nresearch literature from the last 20 years. The goals are to\nexplore whether this framework applies to a pediatric popula-\ntion and to identify patterns and gaps in the scientific litera-\nture as reflected in the five psychosocial domains of safety,\nattachment, identity, justice, and existential meaning. The\nmodel's broad perspective on psychotrauma has potential to\ninform psychosocial practice with children affected by mass\nviolence. Using a narrative review approach, searches were\nconducted in major database (e.g., PubMed, medline, pscy-\nINFO, PILOTS) using key words covering the five domains\nin the model (i.e., safety, attachment, justice, identity, and\nmeaning) and terms relating to war, conflict, trauma, resil-\nience, and adaptation in children ages 5 to 18 years in con-\nflict, post-conflict, and resettlement settings. A total of 118\nrepresentative journal articles and book chapters covering\nqualitative and quantitative studies were selected and a\nresearch assistant worked with the author to analyze and cat-\negorize information into the five domains described. A sec-\nond research assistant served as an external auditor, and the\nfinal categories were determined through consensus. After a\nbrief explanation of the model, each domain is illustrated by\nusing a case incident, examples of major research findings\nrelating to the domain, and, consistent with the model, an\nanalysis of both adaptive and maladaptive responses to war-\ntrauma. Finally, avenues for further research, practice, and\npolicy implications are presented.\nThe ADAPT Psychosocial Model\nThe ADAPT model is an integrative psychosocial frame-\nwork for connecting the multiple issues, stressors, and\nresources facing war-affected individuals (see Silove, 1999,\nadaptive systems believed to subsume the functions of\nsafety, bonds and attachment, identity and roles, justice, and\nexistential meaning in all societies. Under normal circum-\nstances, these systems are understood to have evolved to\npromote personal and social homeostasis between individu-\nals and their community. Although these systems are\ndescribed separately, they are believed to interact within and\nbetween individuals in a community in \"a synergistic and\nthese systems evolve dynamically as different stressors face\nindividuals and their community, creating differing needs\nand warranting different responses.\nThe hypothesis underpinning the ADAPT model is that\nextreme trauma fundamentally challenges one or more of\nthese major adaptive systems which sustain \"a state of psy-\nchosocial equilibrium in individuals and their communities\"\nindividuals and communities is built upon several prior\nunderstandings. First, as a highly adaptable species, human\nbeings likely share universal methods of survival in the face\nof adversity, even though cultural and contextual differences\nmay shape the expression of these adaptive mechanisms\n(Silove, 2000). Second, these universal adaptive systems\nhave reciprocal representations in both psychobiological and\nsocio-cultural structures created to foster the group's survival\nand growth. Underlying Silove's model is the belief that\nhuman reactions to trauma are driven by an evolutionary need\nfor survival and psychosocial development that mobilize \"the\ninherent capacities of individuals and groups to repair their\nown institutions, given favourable support and judicious\nindividual and community contributions to the adaptation\nprocess following trauma underscores the capacity communi-\nties have to actively adapt following adverse situations. In\nthis sense, the ADAPT model can be situated within resil-\nience literature (Rutter, 2003) but with more emphasis on\nindividual and collective experiences after mass violence.\nSilove's five adaptive systems are outlined below. Each of\nthe five sections begins with a case incident illustrating the\npertinent issues related to that system. These cases are drawn\nfrom the author's clinical experience and critical incidents\ncollected during research examining cultural brokers and\nmental health practitioners' roles in facilitating refugee chil-\ndren's adaptation in resettlement countries (Brar-Josan &\nincidents sometimes involve issues related to more than one\nsystem, as an individual's experience might involve a threat\nto multiple systems simultaneously.\nSafety\nUnbridled attacks on civilians and rural communities have\nprovoked mass exoduses and the displacement of entire\npopulations who flee conflict in search of elusive sanctuaries\nwithin and outside their national borders. Among these uprooted\nmillions, it is estimated that 80 per cent are children and women.\nWhile living in Afghanistan during the civil war, 14-year old\ntwins brothers witnessed the murder of their sister and her\nhusband. One boy was also stabbed during the altercation.\nAfter resettling in Canada, both children saw a psychologist\nto address symptoms of trauma. Initially, both children were\ndoing well, but then the boy who had been stabbed began\nusing drugs and engaging in criminal activity. It was later\ndiscovered that he was being bullied while in school.\nAlthough he appeared adjusted to most people, he had devel-\noped a strong sense of paranoia and was coping by using\nsubstances. The boy started to respond to treatment after the\nbullying was addressed in school.\nDescription.Defining the absence of safety, Silove (2000)\ndescribed events that threaten the survival or integrity of an\nindividual or those close to the victim. In war, infringement\non the safety system often involves experiencing traumatic\nevents. Examining threat-based definitions, safety can be\nbroadly outlined as the relative assurance of the physical,\npsychological, and spiritual integrity of individuals and their\ncommunity. Attending to issues of safety and security is par-\namount for adaptation and survival (Silove, 2005).\nExamining the research literature on war-affected children\nand adolescents, the safety system appears to draw the most\ninterest from researchers. As seen in the case vignette, both\ndirectly witnessing violence (e.g., see Dyregrov, Gjestad, &\nexperiencing violence (e.g., see Allwood, Bell-Dolan, &\nHusain, 2002; Derluyn, Broekaert, Schuyten, & Temmerman,\nSchreiber, Le Lin, & Birmaher, 1998) are common occurrences\nreported by war-affected children and their parents. Violence\nincludes events like physical or sexual assault, shootings, and\nbombings. Indirect exposure to violence, through television or\nradio broadcasts, is another source of trauma (e.g., see Hadi &\nShivram, Winter, & Vostanis, 2009). Children and adolescents\nare also involved in the hostilities (e.g., see Amone-P'Olak,\nwith armed forces, patrolling, or being forced to commit acts of\nviolence or subterfuge. In some conflicts, girls are abducted by\nrebel forces and forced into marriage or other types of sexual\nabuse as reported among girls abducted in Northern Uganda\n(Amone-P'Olak, 2005). Resulting from these experiences,\nmany children in these studies described fearing further acts of\nviolence (e.g., seeAllwood et al., 2002;Al-Mashat,Amundson,\nBuchanan, & Westwood, 2006; Dyregrov, Gupta, Gjestad, &\nTo escape the dangers of war, children and their families\nmay leave their homes, either becoming internally displaced\nwithin their own countries or by moving to other, safer coun-\ntries (e.g., see Adam & van Essen, 2004; Gupta & Zimmer,\n1999). However, relocation poses its own dangers, including\nstarvation, assault, and exposure to further violence. In a study\nof Tibetan refugees living in India (Servan-Schreiber et al.,\n1998), one child lost half of her traveling companions in an\navalanche, while another was captured and imprisoned for a\nmonth. In another study by Bates, Luster, Johnson, and Rana\n(2013), Sudanese youth who were forced to relocate to\nEthiopia witnessed the death of more than half of their peers.\nDisplacement has been found to have a negative impact on\nchildren's well-being, with mothers of displaced Croatian\nchildren indicating a substantial increase in a variety of physi-\ncal, behavioral, and emotional symptoms, as well as more con-\ncentration difficulties (Ajdukovic & Ajdukovic, 1998). Even\nfor children who have relocated to a safe country, post-migra-\ntion experiences have been linked with children's psychologi-\ncal symptoms as noted in the case vignette (Heptinstall et al.,\ncent Middle Eastern refugees residing in Denmark, post-\nmigration adaptation and stressors (such as discrimination)\nwere stronger predictors of psychological problems than pre-\nmigration trauma (Montgomery, 2008). This demonstrates the\nsignificance of the refugee experience post-migration.\nAdaptive responses. Responses to trauma need to be viewed\nin the context of their circumstances. After experiencing war\nviolence, a period of arousal, hyper-vigilance, and avoidance\nof stimuli associated with the trauma can be considered\nadaptive behavior, especially if danger may reoccur (Silove,\n1998). For example, the previous case illustrated how hyper-\nvigilant behavior in a youth alerted the presence of new\nthreats to safety in his resettlement environment. Similarly,\n4 SAGE Open\nin a study of internally displaced Bosnians living in the midst\nof war (Goldstein et al., 1997), an increased startle reflex and\nfears of going outside, common indicators of post-traumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD), were actually considered protective\nfor children.\nResponding adaptively to war experiences may also\ninvolve children remaining at or returning to their previous\nlevel of functioning before the trauma. Standardized mea-\nsures of intelligence are one potential way to assess changes\nin children's cognitive functioning, over time. In a study of\nKuwaiti children using a translated version of the Wechsler\nIntelligence Scales for Children-Revised (WISC-R; Hadi &\nLlabre, 1998), mean changes in children's WISC\u00adR scores\nfrom pre-crisis to post-crisis were actually positive. While\nthis change was partially attributed to practice effects, it may\nalso be a sign of resiliency following trauma. Likewise, a\ndecrease in psychological symptoms of trauma among young\nMiddle Eastern refugees resettled in Denmark (Montgomery,\n2010) may be viewed as an indicator of resiliency.\nBy managing day-to-day stressors and tasks, children can\nalso show how they can adapt following trauma. For a group\nof Cambodian refugees living in America (Sack et al., 1999),\nalmost all were able to carry out daily responsibilities, such\nas employment or schooling, despite their previous traumatic\nexperiences.\nIn a study of Iraqi children following war, children dis-\nplayed a tough bravado and detached emotionality, which\nappeared to increase the children's sense of strength when\nfeeling vulnerable (Al-Mashat et al., 2006). Toughness was\nseen as a good characteristic in this context.\nMaladaptive responses. Intense emotions of anger, grief, sad-\nness, and fear are expected in the face of the tragedy and\ndestruction caused by war. However, when these feelings\nand behaviors persist, they can interfere with daily function-\ning. Reported feelings of sadness or depression (e.g., see\nAjdukovic & Ajdukovic, 1998; Betancourt, Newnham, et al.,\nSezibera, Van Broeck, & Philippot, 2009; Thabet, Abed, &\nPunam\u00e4ki, 1996; Thabet, Tawahina, El-Sarraj, & Vostanis,\nexposed to war. While these feelings are understandable,\ntheir strength and pervasiveness may interfere with chil-\ndren's ability to heal and develop following trauma.\nFrom the perspective of the ADAPT model, PTSD-related\nsymptoms of arousal and hyper-vigilance can be protective\nin dangerous environments (Silove, 1998) but can signifi-\ncantly interfere with normal functioning once children enter\na safer environment. Symptoms of PTSD are common in\nstudies of war-affected children and adolescents (e.g., see\nElklit, \u00d8sterg\u00e5rd Kj\u00e6r, Lasgaard, & Palic, 2012; Husain\nMacksoud &Aber, 1996; McMullen, O'Callaghan, Richards,\n2012), with severity of post-traumatic symptoms ranging\nfrom mild to severe. Several studies report that the severity\nof children's post-traumatic symptoms is linked to the\namount of violent exposure children experienced (Heptinstall\nAmong refugee children living in London with their fami-\nlies, a correlation was also found between the number of\npost-migration stressors (e.g., financial difficulties, insecure\nasylum status, language problems) and children's PTSD and\ndepression scores (Heptinstall et al., 2004). In particular,\nHeptinstall et al. found that experiencing the violent death of\na family member and insecure asylum status were associated\nwith higher PTSD scores. Insecure asylum status and severe\nfinancial difficulties were associated with higher depression\nRetaining post-traumatic symptoms in a safe environment\nis a maladaptive, yet common, response for children exposed\nto war (Almqvist & Brandell-Forsberg, 1997; Sack et al.,\n1999). Prevalence and severity of PTSD and depression were\nmeasured in a 12-year longitudinal study of Cambodian refu-\ngee adolescents living in America (Kinzie, Sack, Angell,\nstudents exhibited PTSD (Kinzie et al., 1986) and twelve\nyears later, 35% of 31 students met criteria for PTSD (Sack\net al., 1999). In a study by Betancourt, Newnham, et al.\nPTSD symptoms even after resettlement. Bronstein,\nMontgomery, and Dobrowolski (2012) found similar results\nin a case of Afghan unaccompanied refugee minors with 34%\nreporting PTSD symptoms, post-resettlement. According to\nthe ADAPT model, these symptoms are maladaptive because\nthey persisted for a long period of time and disrupted the reg-\nular functioning of these individuals. In a study of Iraqi chil-\ndren following the Gulf War, children's post-traumatic\nsymptoms had reduced 2 years after the war (Dyregrov et al.,\n2002). However, the overall scores remained high leading to\nconclusions that children's post-traumatic \"symptoms persist,\nwith somewhat diminished intensity over time\" (Dyregrov\nthe Tutsi in Rwanda, many Rwandan youth living in orphan-\nages and youth-headed households who had been exposed to\nextreme levels of violence were still significantly distressed,\nConversely, Punam\u00e4ki, Qouta, and El-Sarraj (2001) reported\na significant decrease in Palestinian children's neurotic symp-\ntoms 3 years following political violence, especially among\nthose children exposed to the most traumatic events, indicat-\ning that some symptoms may decline over time.\nThe safety system and its relationship to PTSD tend to\nattract the majority of researcher attention. However, several\nother maladaptive responses are potentially linked with\nsafety violations. Psychosomatic complaints (McFarlane\ncism (Punam\u00e4ki et al., 2001), underreporting of post-trau-\nmatic symptoms due to fear of stigma (Anstiss & Ziaian,\ndeveloping an external locus of control (Kuterovac-Jagodic,\n2003) are also described in groups of children following war-\ntrauma. In total, these maladaptive responses likely contrib-\nute to adjustment difficulties for children and adolescents as\nthey seek to begin new lives following war.\nBonds and Attachment\nChildren seek protection in networks of social support, but these\nhave been undermined by new political and economic realities.\nConflict and violent social change have affected social welfare\nnetworks between families and communities. Rapid urbanization\nand the spread of market-based values have also helped erode\nsystems of support that were once based on the extended family.\nA 15-year old Somali girl was having relationship problems\nwith her father while living in Canada. Before migrating, the\ngirl and her family lived in a refugee camp in Kenya. To sup-\nport the family, the girl's father travelled to an urban area to\nmake some money, during which time the girl's mother died.\nThe girl had difficulty coping with her mother's death and\nconsidered it her father's fault. She felt that if her father had\ndone more and remained close to the family, her mother\nwould still be alive. Over time, the relationship between the\ngirl and her father deteriorated, and she left home and moved\nin with a group of peers. The girl's attendance at school was\npoor so a community cultural broker arranged a meeting\nwith the girl and her father. While initially challenging, the\nrelationship between father and daughter improved slowly\nwith the assistance of community cultural supports and grief\ncounselling for both father and daughter.\nDescription.Attachment is a bond based on the need for\nsafety, protection, and comfort (Prior & Glaser, 2006) that\nbegins in infancy between a child and their caregiver(s)\n(Bowlby, 1969). This attachment need is paramount in child-\nhood, when individuals are the most vulnerable. For children\nand adolescents facing war-trauma, this need for protection\nand comfort is highly salient. Research in Uganda (Bowlby,\nVan Devender, Iwanaga, LeVine, & LeVine, 1977), Botswana\n(van Ijzendoorn & Sagi, 1999), and Zambia (Morelli & Tron-\nick, 1991) supports the premise that attachment theory is\napplicable across cultures (Prior & Glaser, 2006).\nAs illustrated in the case vignette, one of the most devas-\ntating disruptions caused by violence, displacement, and\nother war-related traumas is the impact on the survivors'\ninterpersonal bonds (Silove, 1999). Separations and losses\ncan be either actual or symbolic. For example, a child may be\nseparated from a parent while fleeing a war-ravaged area or\nlose a favorite toy which represents her comforting feelings\nof home. As a symbol of familiarity and intimacy, the loss of\na home has a deeply personal impact on children (Klingman,\n2002a). In the surveyed literature, war-affected children and\nadolescents frequently reported attachment-related threats,\nincluding witnessing violence against family or friends (e.g.,\nsee Almqvist & Brandell-Forsberg, 1997; Ellis, MacDonald,\nseparations from caregivers (Amone-P'Olak, 2005; Bates\ncommunity supports (Dyregrov et al., 2000), loss of close\nfriends (Dyregrov et al., 2002), and a lack of social support\n1996). Even after conflict has ceased, children may continue\nto worry about attachment-related threats. For example, 2\nyears after the Gulf War, more than 80% of Iraqi children\nreported fear of losing their family sometimes or always\n(Dyregrov et al., 2002). Examining the impact of separation\ndren experienced greater distress from separations than from\nwitnessing death, destruction, injury, or bombings.\nLacking a parent or caregiver may place children at\ngreater risk for psychological difficulties. A study by\nDerluyn, Mels, and Broekaert (2009) found that separated\nrefugee youth have an increased risk of facing multiple trau-\nmatic incidences, along with an increased risk for developing\nmental health problems. In a study of unaccompanied refu-\ngee minors seeking asylum in Norway (Batista Pinto Wiese\n& Burhorst, 2007), unaccompanied children were more\nlikely to experience regulation difficulties, somatic com-\nplaints, depressed feelings, and hallucinations or delusions\nthan children with family members. Similarly, in the United\nKingdom, higher levels of psychological distress was\nobserved in recently arrived young refugees, who had also\nexperienced separation from immediate family (Dur\u00e0-Vil\u00e0\net al., 2013). As children's ability to self-regulate draws\ngreatly from their caretaker's emotional state, it seems likely\nthat unaccompanied minors run a greater risk of mental\nhealth problems following trauma exposure (Huemer et al.,\n1998). Similarly, psychiatric symptoms of PTSD and depres-\nsion were more common and severe in groups of Cambodian\nrefugees who did not live with a family member when they\nmoved to America (Kinzie et al., 1986). Seglem, Oppedal,\nand Raeder (2011) found that unaccompanied refugee minors\n6 SAGE Open\nhave elevated levels of depressive symptoms even after\nresettlement. However, unaccompanied minors also experi-\nenced, on average, more traumatic events than children liv-\ning with their families (Batista Pinto Wiese & Burhorst,\n2007), highlighting the increased danger for children who\nare separated from their caregivers. A literature review by\nHuemer et al. (2009) concluded that being separated from\nfamily greatly increased refugee adolescents likelihood of\nexperiencing traumatic events.\nYouth-headed households are another outcome of war and\nthe loss of caregivers. For example, many children lost their\nparents during the 1994 genocide against Tutsi of Rwanda\nand/or subsequently from AIDS. As a result, it was estimated\nthat 10% of households in Rwanda were headed by children a\ndecade after the war (Mirza, 2006). Children in youth-headed\nhouseholds were more \"susceptible to disease, exploitation,\npoverty, inability to attend school, and displacement from\noften felt marginalized and unsupported by their community\n(Mirza, 2006). Another study found that Rwandan youth liv-\ning in child-headed households were more likely to report\nPTSD symptoms than youth living in an orphanage (Schaal &\nElbert, 2006). These studies give emphasis to the psychologi-\ncal and social sequel of threats to children's attachment sys-\ntems in the context of war.\nIn families, children are not the only members exposed to\nthe effects of war. Caregivers may also be traumatized by\nviolence, injustice, and instability (Klingman, 2006; Saile\net al., 2014). Reports of traumatized and emotionally unavail-\nable caregivers are found in studies of war-affected children\n(Al-Mashat et al., 2006; Almqvist & Brandell-Forsberg,\nthere is a higher rate of mental health problems within refu-\ngee parent populations as opposed to civilian populations\n(McFarlane et al., 2011). Psychological unavailability of\ncaregivers, due to traumatization or physical absence, may\ncontribute to long-term psychological challenges in children\n(Cicchetti, Toth, & Lynch, 1997). Studies have shown that\nthe mental health of caregivers is a key predictor of the men-\ntal health of children (Betancourt & Khan, 2008). In a study\nof families living in the Gaza Strip during periods of vio-\nlence, the emotional responses of children and their parents\nwere found to be interrelated (Thabet et al., 2008). Parents'\nPTSD scores predicted their children's PTSD symptoms.\nLikewise, parents' anxiety scores predicted their children's\nanxiety symptoms. Similarly, Ajdukovic and Ajdukovic\n(1998) found that the number of children's adjustment diffi-\nculties correlated with their mother's post-traumatic stress\nreactions. More recently, Saile and colleagues (2014) shed\nlight on the complex interaction between child and caregiver\nmental health in post-conflict settings. This study examined\ndistal and proximal risk factors for child victimization by\ncaregivers in Northern Uganda. Results indicate that aggres-\nsive parenting behaviors by caregivers was predicted by their\nown experiences of childhood maltreatment, female caregiv-\ners victimization in intimate partner relationships, and male\ncaregivers symptoms of PTSD and alcohol use.\nCaregivers also play an important role in accessing help\nfor traumatized children, as caregivers usually possess the\nmost intimate knowledge of their children's well-being.\nUnfortunately, caregivers are sometimes unaware of their\nchildren's mental health issues (Henley & Robinson, 2011;\nThis lack of awareness may be due to lack of attention from\ncaregivers (Klingman, 2006), the caregiver's own debilitation\nfrom trauma, or children's attempts to shield or protect their\ncaregivers. At other times, caregivers may fail to notice or\neven discourage children's attempts to process traumatic\nevents through re-experiencing play, hoping that children will\nsimply forget the trauma (Almqvist & Brandell-Forsberg,\nwas common practice in Iraq for parents to tell their children\nto forget what had happened. Furthermore, refugee parents\nmay be unwilling to utilize mental health services for their\nchildren because of the stigma associated with mental health\nAdaptive responses.Support is vital for children and adoles-\ncents to recover from traumatic experiences. Social (Barber,\nKuterovac-Jagodic, 2003; Stewart, Simich, Shizha, Makumbe,\ncommunity supports (Yohani, 2008) are identified as signifi-\ncant resilience factors for the adaptation of war-affected chil-\ndren and adolescents. For children, the school environment is\nof major importance as they adjust. Schools can make a differ-\nence in refugee children's ability to settle, build a sense of\nbelonging, develop socially and emotionally, and regain a\nsense of structure and routine (Humphries & Mynott, 2001;\nRana, Qin, Bates, Luster, & Saltarelli, 2011; Rousseau & Guz-\nPositive familial relationships and parental support\nappear to be particularly important for children to respond\nadaptively following war. In a qualitative study by Kanji\nand Cameron (2010), Afghani refugee children resettled in\nCanada frequently mentioned the importance of family and\nhow being united with their family gave them strength, sup-\nport, and a sense of security. Iraqi children reported main-\ntaining physical closeness with their parents as a way of\ncoping with their trauma (Al-Mashat et al., 2006). Similarly,\nCorrea-Velez et al. (2010) found that there was a significant\ncorrelation between living at home with parents and\nincreased well-being within refugee children resettled in\nMelbourne, Australia. According to Thabet et al. (2009),\ngreater parental support was related to lower levels of expo-\nsure to traumatic events among Palestinian children living\nin the Gaza Strip. Parental support was also found to be\nassociated with lower post-traumatic symptoms scores\n(Thabet et al., 2009). Harmonious parenting, in which chil-\ndren felt loved and accepted by both parents, was linked to\nbetter adjustment among Palestinian children (Punam\u00e4ki\nstudies that focused on the impact of the Asian tsunami and\ndomestic violence on youth living in Sri Lanka who had also\nexperienced civil war in their country. Positive adaptation\nwas measured by analyzing the sample's post-traumatic\nstress symptoms, somatic complaints, psychosocial func-\ntioning, and reports of their schoolwork. It was found that\nfamily support was a predictor of positive adaptation. These\nfindings indicate that it is imperative to protect parents after\nadversity to help their children recover. Conversely, discrep-\nant parenting, where children perceived their mothers but\nnot their fathers as loving and caring, was characteristic of\nchildren with higher levels of PTSD. Punam\u00e4ki et al. (2001)\nalso reported that Palestinian children who felt loved and\naccepted at home were more likely to fulfill their intellec-\ntual and creative potential.\nThe quality and supportiveness of the recovery environ-\nment following trauma contributes to the outcome of early\nPTSD reactions (Steel, Silove, Bird, McGorry, & Mohan,\n1999). In a study of children and adolescents living in a\nRwandan unaccompanied center (Dyregrov et al., 2000), the\npsychosocial environment of the center, including camara-\nderie with other children, basic needs being met, education,\nand trained staff, was believed to have a healing effect on\nthe children. Compared with children in the community,\nchildren living at the center actually exhibited lower levels\nof distress, even though \"children living at centers initially\nexperienced more losses and greater violence exposures\nthan children in the community\" (Dyregrov et al., 2000, p.\n16). Similarly, refugee children and staff of an early inter-\nvention program in Canada both identified hope as a per-\nsonal resource that was engendered when children felt\nsupported by adult staff and other important caregivers\n(Yohani, 2008). According to Dur\u00e0-Vil\u00e0 and colleagues\n(2013), the delivery of mental health services in schools and\nbeing able to consult with teachers are highly beneficial for\nrefugee children's adjustment after trauma. Alternatively,\nloss of social connections and separation from family mem-\nbers appear to maintain symptoms of depression and PTSD\nThe needs of children and adolescents without families need\nto be handled sensitively in the aftermath of war. Dyregrov\net al. (2000) cautioned that within-country adoptions of war-\naffected children need to be conducted with discretion, and\nHek (2007) outlined the advantages and disadvantages of fos-\nter-care programs in resettlement countries. Although most\nsocieties have traditions to care for parentless children in the\nabsence of blood relations (Mirza, 2006), communities may be\nless able to care for children in the immediate aftermath of\nwidespread destruction, like the Rwandan genocide (Dyregrov\nwhile communities rebuild and recover, as it can foster social\nand cognitive development, as noted by research with Eritrean\norphans (Wolff, Tesfai, Egasso, & Aradom, 1995), and meets\nbasic needs, as noted in Rwanda (Dyregrov et al., 2000). For\nunaccompanied minors moving to settlement countries, care-\ngiving arrangements vary depending on host country and can\nrange from placement in group homes, shared apartments, to\nfoster homes. In a study of asylum seeking adolescents from\nAfghanistan in the United Kingdom (Bronstein et al., 2012),\nfoster care was found to be negatively associated with PTSD.\nHighly committed foster parents are also crucial, as noted in\nstudies of unaccompanied refugee youth in foster care in\nUnited Kingdom (Wade, Sirriyeh, Kohli, & Simmonds, 2012)\nand the United States (Luster, Qin, Bates, Johnson, & Rana,\n2009). The relationship between caregivers and unaccompa-\nnied minors appears to be the crucial element in the success of\nthese various care arrangements, providing evidence for the\nrole of attachment/bonds domain of the ADAPT model. Bates\nand colleagues (2005) advocated specifically for the impor-\ntance of open-minded and flexible foster-care placements that\ntake into account the unique pre- and post-migration experi-\nences and needs of the children in care.\nRebuilding community and social structures in the wake\nof conflict may offer avenues for children to restore their\nbonds with the larger community. In a study of Israeli pre-\nschoolers, \"reconstitution of the socio-cultural layer of the\nprotective matrix may have promoted adaptation of the chil-\ndren and facilitated a reduction in stress symptoms\" (Laor\nalso identified by children and school officials as both pro-\ntective and healing for Tibetan refugee minors (Servan-\nSchreiber et al., 1998). Afghan refugee children resettled in\nCanada expressed how support from their Ismaili commu-\nnity and their involvement in community-related activities\ngreatly helped them to adjust (Kanji & Cameron, 2010).\nConversely, neighborhood disorganization was linked to\nbehavior problems among Palestinian youth (Barber, 2001).\nMaladaptive responses. As previously identified in the safety\nsystem, symptoms of PTSD (e.g., see Attanayake et al.,\n2009), sadness or depression (e.g., see Thabet & Vostanis,\noccur frequently in studies of war-affected children and ado-\nlescents. Clearly, traumatic events and responses to trauma\nare multifaceted. Viewed within the ADAPT model, these\naffective and behavioral responses likely arise from trau-\nmatic events that affect both children's sense of safety and\n8 SAGE Open\nattachment. Safety and attachment are highly salient, inter-\nconnected needs for children and do not function in isolation.\nFor example, Schaal and Elbert (2006) reported that the two\nevents most strongly related to PTSD symptoms in Rwandan\nyouth were witnessing the murder of a parent and the belief\nthat they themselves would die. However, theoretically,\nSilove notes that maladaptive responses to losses accumu-\nlated from threats to attachment systems involve grief and\ndepressive reactions. In a study of Croatian refugee children,\ndepression was correlated with deteriorating family rela-\ntions, poorer relationships with mothers, and the child's per-\nceived rejection by the mother (Ajdukovic & Ajdukovic,\n1998). It was also reported that children who lacked a sup-\nportive family environment had higher levels of stress-\nrelated symptoms and were at special risk for developing\nfurther psychological difficulties.\nIn the face of war-related trauma, families may lose their\nability to function in a healthy and adaptive manner. When\nparents and children both experience trauma, family cohesion\nand parental capacity may be impacted (Almqvist & Brandell-\nForsberg, 1997). In response to war-related stress, approaches\nto parenting may alter, evoking more authoritative parenting\nstyles, less supervision of children, or less positive communi-\ncation (Klingman, 2006). Similarly, the results of a study by\nvan Ee, Kleber, and Mooren (2012) showed that asylum\nseeker and refugee mothers experiencing post-traumatic\nstress are at a higher risk for insensitive or unstructured inter-\nactions with their infants. Ajdukovic and Ajdukovic (1998)\nreported that as Croatian refugee children exhibited more\nstress reactions, maternal gentleness decreased. Difficulties in\nrelationships with others may spread beyond the family, as\nwell. In a group of internally displaced Bosnians, children\nreported being unwilling or unable to play with others\nJustice\nWar violates every right of a child-- the right to life, the right to\nbe with family and community, the right to health, the right to\nthe development of the personality and the right to be nurtured\nand protected. (United Nations (Machel Report), 1996, p. 10)\nDuring war in his country of Uganda, an 11-year old boy\nwitnessed his mother being murdered. In addition, the boy\nand his family were unable to provide an appropriate burial\nfor his mother's body. These experiences troubled the boy for\na long time. The boy believed he could never forgive the\ncrimes he had witnessed and considered joining the army to\nseek revenge. However, over time he came to realize that he\nwould be shooting and killing innocent people. Seeking\nrevenge would have caused others to go though what he was\ngoing through. Recognizing this, the boy decided to break the\nchain of violence and walk away from it. At age 19, he\ndecided to study law, with the hope of making a difference in\nhis country's judicial system.\nDescription.Common definitions of justice tend to include\n(a) the quality of being just, (b) fairness, (c) conforming to\nmoral rightness in action or attitude, and (d) the upholding of\nfair treatment and due reward in accordance with honor,\nstandards, or law (Houghton Mifflin, 2006). Experiences that\nthreaten an individual's sense of justice include torture,\nhuman rights violations, dehumanization, corruption, exploi-\ntation, and the presence of perpetrators living with impunity\nin the community (Silove, 2000). These experiences are psy-\nchologically traumatizing due to their propensity to humili-\nate and shame the individuals and communities. In response\nto these justice violations, Silove (2000) argued that \"one\npathway of adaptation to injustice is therefore to struggle for\nthe creation of social structures that will prevent similar\nabuses in the future\" (p. 344). In addition, Silove notes that\n\"many great humanitarian leaders of this century themselves\nsuffered persecution at some point in their careers\" (p. 344),\nincluding Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. Interest-\ningly, the boy in the previous case followed a similar path-\nway to these great leaders.\nJustice-related threats can happen to children in their\ncountry of origin or following the conflict in a settlement\ncountry. Children may experience persecution (Almqvist &\nBrandell-Forsberg, 1997) for religious beliefs or cultural\nidentity. Being prevented from helping wounded individuals\nduring conflict (Qouta et al., 2003) may also affect children's\nbeliefs about justice. Following war, perpetrators of violence\nand destruction sometimes remain in their community with\nimpunity (Dyregrov et al., 2000), continually reminding chil-\ndren of the unpunished atrocities that were committed. In\nsettlement countries, threats to justice can occur at an indi-\nvidual or societal level. For example, children may be dis-\ncriminated against because of their refugee status (Bates\nby legislation regarding refugees (Hek, 2005). These experi-\nences may leave children and adolescents feeling powerless\nto impact their environment (Paardekooper et al., 1999) leav-\ning them with unresolved anger and shame. Acts of discrimi-\nnation toward refugee students can also lead to PTSD and\ndepressive symptoms (Correa-Velez et al., 2010).\nAdaptive and maladaptive responses.Respect and empower-\nment are central to just responses to war violence. At the\nforefront, service delivery and interventions should be con-\nveyed in a culturally sensitive and appropriate manner for\nchildren and their families (Thabet & Vostanis, 2000; Yohani,\n2008). These practices involve consultation with community\nmembers and development of culturally sensitive practices\n(Bates et al., 2005). Measures used to evaluate intervention\neffects should also be culturally sensitive as symptoms can\nbe expressed in a variety of ways depending on the social and\ncultural context (Betancourt, Meyers-Ohki, Charrow, & Tol,\nResponses that encourage and empower children and\nadults to take a stand against injustice offer adaptive ways to\naddress war-related atrocities. Although it may seem coun-\nterintuitive, from the ADAPT model's perspective, remain-\ning distressed because perpetrators remain unpunished in the\ncommunity (Dyregrov et al., 2000), is actually a healthy\nresponse for children and adolescents. Their distress sug-\ngests that children have not given up and accepted that these\nsituations are inevitable. For Tibetan refugee children, par-\nticipating in their nation's struggle against oppression was\nidentified as a healing and protective factor (Servan-\nSchreiber et al., 1998). Similarly, Iraqi children spoke about\ntheir resentment toward the occupying Americans and their\ndesire to help remove the occupying army (Al-Mashat et al.,\n2006). Specifically, continuing engagement in political\nactivities has been associated with a good prognosis of PTSD\nsymptoms (Allden et al., 1996). Palestinian children who\nresponded actively to political violence had fewer traumatic\nsymptoms and less emotional disorders compared with pas-\nsive children (Punam\u00e4ki et al., 2001). Israeli children\nexposed to war with strong ideological commitment did not\nreport as many psychological impacts as those with weak\nideological commitment (Punam\u00e4ki, 1996). Finally, adults\ncan also advocate on behalf of the rights of children in con-\nflict situations. Goldstein et al. (1997) encouraged profes-\nsionals, like pediatricians, to publicize the effects of war on\nchildren and bring public attention to injustices and specific\nneeds of children. There is a need to further examine the\nnature of children's involvement in justice-related activities\nas such engagement can be dangerous or contribute to further\ndistress, depending on context.\nPromoting a sense of justice and fairness in schools can\nassist children and adolescents as they resettle during post-\nconflict. For example, in resettlement countries, anti-bullying\npolicies can contribute to students developing feelings of\nbelonging in new schools (Hek, 2005). According to Montero,\nIbrahim, Loomis, and Newmaster (2012), anti-bullying pro-\ngrams must address \"anti-immigrant sentiments\" that many\nrefugee students face to further increase feelings of belonging.\nIn the United Kingdom, Blackwell and Melzak (2000) encour-\naged schools to understand and work with the behavior of refu-\ngee students in ways that cause children to feel neither\ndisadvantaged nor specially privileged. However, this may be a\ndifficult task, as noted in one study whereby some Sudanese\nstudents viewed educational assistance to address gaps in their\neducational researchers (Derwing, Decorby, Ichikawa, &\nreport feeling marginalized and stigmatized by being placed in\nEnglish as a Second Language (ESL) classes. Furthermore,\nteacher misunderstandings toward newcomer students because\nof lack of cultural awareness (McBrien & Day, 2012) and low-\nered expectations from teachers (Rana et al., 2011) can lead to\nincreased feelings of marginalization. These perspectives can\nbe understood in light of other studies that suggest newcomer\nchildren are often rejected by their peers and are discriminated\nagainst for not being able to speak English (Anisef & Kilbride,\nresponses can be viewed as attempts to resist systems that\nthreaten to contribute to isolation and marginalization.\nExposure to violence also seems to affect children's\nbeliefs regarding appropriate responses to war. Former child\nsoldiers in Uganda and the Congo with more PTSD symp-\ntoms were less open to reconciliation and had more feelings\nof revenge than those with fewer PTSD symptoms (Bayer\net al., 2007). In a study of Israeli youth, greater exposure to\nviolence tended to be related to more negative attitudes\nSilove notes that unlike other affective responses, like\ndepression or anxiety, the DSM classification system does\nnot contain primary anger syndromes (Silove, 2000). He pro-\nposes that further research is necessary to examine the pos-\nsibility of a traumatic anger disorder for survivors of human\nrights injustices. This may be particularly relevant for under-\nstanding the behaviors of older children and adolescents.\nAggressive behavior is often found in children and adoles-\ncents who survive war-trauma (Belsky, 2008; Miller et al.,\nAlthough some might argue that aggression and anger should\nbe placed as responses to safety violations, others may view\nthem as responses to unfair and unjust treatment. The per-\nceived source of the maladaptive response affects the inter-\nventions proposed to address the behavior. For example, if\naggressive behavior is postulated to stem from fear, interven-\ntions may involve managing physiological hyper-arousal\nusing cognitive and behavioral approaches. However, if\naggressive behavior is thought to stem from justice viola-\ntions, interventions may include social justice activities\naimed at empowering youth to make positive changes.\nIdentity and Roles\nAll cultures recognize adolescence as a highly significant period\nin which young people learn future roles and incorporate the\nvalues and norms of their societies. The extreme and often\nprolonged circumstances of armed conflict interfere with\nidentity development. (United Nations, 1996 (Machel Report),\nA 14-year-old Iraq-born boy, arrived in Canada with his\nsingle-parent mother and was placed in a junior high school\nafter less that four years of formal schooling during the war\nin his home country. At school he struggled academically\nand socially. His attendance was poor and he had conflicts\nwith his teachers and other school personnel. When the boy\nbegan high school the following year, his attendance contin-\nued to be sporadic. The boy's neighbourhood had high rates\nof criminal and gang activity, and he started to move toward\nthese activities. The school recommended that he enroll in a\nreform school, but the boy did not want to go. The boy's\nmother tried to discipline him, but nothing seemed to work.\nThe boy's involvement with gangs made him appear \"cool\"\namong his peers. Some youth in the community were\nimpressed that he appeared to be providing for his family,\neven if he was doing so using illegal means. The boy became\na role model for other vulnerable students, some who fol-\nlowed his example and joined gangs.\nDescription.A major developmental task for adolescents is\nidentity formation (Erikson, 1959). As children grow and\ndevelop toward adulthood, they must cultivate \"a firm and\ncoherent sense of who they are, where they are heading, and\nwhere they fit into society\" (Shaffer, Wood, & Willoughby,\nnuity, where day-to-day routines and expectations like\nattending school or playing with friends are lost (Klingman,\n2006). Children's roles, and subsequently their identity, may\nbe forced to alter drastically. Children may change roles from\nstudents to soldiers, being cared for by parents to caring for\nsiblings after the loss of both caregivers, or citizens of their\nown country to outsiders in a new country. Because of the\nplasticity of the brain, adolescents forge new identities in\nrelation to the experiences they encounter. This could explain\nhow the young boy in the case vignette easily identified with\na local gang and how children recruited by armed groups\ngrow to view themselves as part of armed groups.\nHaving one's social position, roles, possessions, and\nschool stripped away may seriously threaten a child's \"sense\nof empowerment, efficacy and individuality\" (Silove, 2005,\np. 345). As when children move to a new country, they are\noften faced with roles and expectations differing from those\nin their country of origin. Fantino and Colak (2001)\nexplained, \"the uprooting, disruption, and insecurity inherent\nin migration affect psychological and social development,\nmaking the process of identity formation a more difficult bal-\nancing act between two or more sets of cultural notions and\nexperiences for unaccompanied Sudanese refugee youth\nplaced in foster care in America. Differences in gender roles\nand behaviors caused confusion. In foster homes, cultural\ndifferences regarding household roles created difficulties\nwhen boys resisted cooking as \"women's work\" and feared\nmockery for working in the kitchen. At school, boys also\nfound female assertiveness very different in dating relation-\nships. Similarly, two studies in Australia found Afghan\n(Iqbal, Joyce, Russo, & Earnest, 2012) and Burmese (Koh,\nLiamputtong, & Walker, 2013) female refugee youth faced\ndifficulties in negotiating their identity because of differing\ngender roles and expectations between their culture of origin\nand mainstream Australian culture.\nIn some wars, individuals are targeted on the basis of their\nethnic identity. For example, during the 1994 genocide\nRwandan youth about 10 years after the genocide. Although\npolitical attempts have been made to de-emphasize ethnicity,\nHilker found that discussions about ethnicity had become a\ntaboo and moved underground. Ethnic stereotyping was still\npervasive among Rwandan youths who continuously catego-\nrized important others by perceived ethnic identity. This pro-\ncess of categorization is complex, uncertain, and often\ncontradictory; it fails to capture the lived reality, which is\nmore complex than the ethnic categories largely based on\nstereotypes. Hilker also explains that the war affected young\nRwandans' trust of others, especially those in other ethnic\ngroups. For reconciliation to be most effective among\nRwandans, Hilker argues for the need to challenge ideas\nabout the \"conceptual Tutsi\" and \"conceptual Hutu.\" Hilker\nexplains that,\na first step would be to encourage \"concrete\" Hutus, Tutsis and\n\"mixed\" Rwandans to discuss their views and experiences\nopenly, to acknowledge the plurality of their identities and to\nfoster affiliations with others based on other common experiences\nand interests. (p. 97)\nAdaptive and maladaptive responses.As school occupies a\ncentral part in a child's world, it makes sense that school\nexperiences would strongly affect identity and role develop-\nment for war-affected children and adolescents. However,\ndiscrimination is a reoccurring theme among refugee chil-\ndren in school settings (J. Stewart, 2012). Perceived discrim-\nination and resulting stress have an impact on identity\nformation in children due to the internalization of negative\nmessages (Derluyn & Broekaert, 2008), activation of pre-\nmigration traumatic reminders (Derluyn & Broekaert, 2008),\nand correlation with depressive symptomology (Ellis et al.,\ndren and adolescents actively resist such threats to their iden-\ntity by concealing their ethnic identity (Khanlou, Koh, &\ninstitutions such as schools play a key role in protecting chil-\ndren from ongoing threats to identity. Hek (2005) examined\nthe role of education in the settlement experiences of adoles-\ncent refugees in the United Kingdom. Allowing refugee\nminors to bring pieces of their personal and cultural identity\nwere important factors in school settlement, including creat-\ning links between home and school, employing teachers with\nsimilar cultural-linguistic backgrounds, and the promotion of\nfirst languages. In addition, being allowed to self-identify as\nrefugees and feeling that their experiences and contributions\nwere valued by staff and students instilled a sense of belong-\ning in adolescent refugees.\nDeveloping a sense of one's own identity and establishing\nattitudes toward other groups are typical developmental\nactivities in adolescence (Branch, 2001). Fantino and Colak\n(2001) explained that these normal developmental tasks are\ncomplicated for refugee children in Canada, who face the\nchallenge of meaningfully integrating \"their history with the\npresent and future realities of Canada\" (p. 595). As young\nrefugees relocate to new countries, they are faced with the\ntasks of navigating cultural differences and acculturation.\nBerry (1984) developed a four-part model of acculturation\nbased on the level at which individuals participate in the host\nculture (high/low) and retain their previous cultural identity\n(high/low): assimilation, integration, separation, and margin-\nalization. In a study of adolescents from the former Republic\nof Yugoslavia resettling in Australia (Kovacev & Shute,\n2004), an integration approach to acculturation positively\ncorrelated with measures of psychosocial adjustment, includ-\ning global self-worth and peer-social acceptance. Integration\noccurs when individuals' maintain their native cultural iden-\ntity and actively participate in the new country (Berry, 1984).\nAs such, Kovacev and Shute suggested encouraging refugee\nyouth to both build bridges with their host society and sus-\ntain connections with their culture of origin. Conversely,\nyouth who rejected either their own culture of origin (assimi-\nlation) or the host culture (marginalization) had the lowest\nadjustment ratings. Both assimilation and marginalization\nseem to equally endanger adolescents' ability to become\ngroup members and, consequently, their ability to develop a\nstable identity (Kovacev & Shute, 2004). In a study by\nLuster, Qin, Bates, Rana, and Lee (2010), interviews focus-\ning on factors that contributed to successful adaptation\namong Sudanese unaccompanied refugees were conducted,\n7 years after their settling in the United States. Participants\ncited their ability to have an integration approach to accul-\nturation, by combining the best of their Sudanese culture\nwith the best of American culture, as one of the reasons for\ntheir successful adjustment.\nExistential Meaning\nAll sectors of society must come together to build \"ethical\nframeworks,\" integrating traditional values of cooperation\nthrough religious and community leaders with international\nlegal standards. (United Nations (Machel Report), 1996, p. 58)\nA 17-year-old girl from the Democratic Republic of Congo\nrelated that at age 13-years, she was separated for two years\nfrom her family during the war in her country. Her family\nwere devout Christians and members of their local religious\ncommunity. During the two years she lived alone in a dis-\nplaced people's camp and experienced sexual and physical\nabuse. These experiences caused her to question the exis-\ntence of God and to denounce her religion--even after being\nreunited with some members of her family. At age 17-years\nshe started to attend church and was slowly exploring her\nbelief system again.\nDescription.In instances of war, entire populations and\nregions are disrupted on multiple levels, including personal,\nfamilial, and societal, through violence and the destruction of\nphysical property and infrastructure (Klingman, 2006). Fol-\nlowing war, children and adolescents are left striving to re-\nestablish their basic human needs for equilibrium (Kahana,\nfind reasons for the pain and suffering they experienced. War-\nfare exposes children to information and experiences which\nmay dispute their central beliefs that people are trustworthy;\nthat the world is meaningful, predictable, and safe; and that\nthat \"exposure to inexplicable evil and cruelty can shake the\nfoundations of the survivor's faith in the beneficence of life\nand humankind\" (p. 204). In a study of Israeli youth, both\nobjective and subjective measures of exposure were associ-\nated with PTSD symptoms (Solomon & Lavi, 2005), but sub-\njective measures made a greater contribution to the variance\nof symptoms. This finding suggests that, in addition to actual\nexposure, how youth interpret violent exposure affects their\npsychological well-being. Examining the research literature\non war-affected children and adolescents, little information\nexists on children's meaning-making during and after expo-\nsure to mass violence.\nReligion and spirituality are one significant source from\nwhich individuals draw and create meaning. This has been\nfound to be a protective factor in moderating the effect of\nwar trauma in youth (Werner, 2012). Seeing places of wor-\nship destroyed (Dyregrov et al., 2000) and being prevented\nfrom burying loved ones with dignity, according to religious\ntraditions (Qouta et al., 2003), are two threats to existential\nmeaning for children and adolescents. Religion and spiritual-\nity can offer children and adolescents support (Bates et al.,\nbeliefs, and spiritual advisors or leaders. When these institu-\ntions and practices are threatened, it may strip away chil-\ndren's ability to make sense of pain and suffering.\nAdaptive and maladaptive responses.Adaptive responses to\ntrauma offer ways for individuals to begin making sense and\ndealing with the atrocities of war. To cope effectively with pro-\nlonged traumatic situations, children need to be able to con-\nstruct new metaphors and personal narratives to replace\nfragmented understandings shattered by war experiences\n(Punam\u00e4ki, 2002). Symbolizing can help children diminish\nstudied Israeli children's ideological commitment, explaining\nthat this is \"psychologically important because people strive to\nfind a meaning for traumatic events and incorporate them into\ntheir life experiences\" (p. 55). She found that the more chil-\ndren were exposed to political violence, the more they\nexpressed ideological commitment. Punam\u00e4ki (1996) also\nreported that children with a strong ideological commitment\nhad lower levels of psychological problems, as long as their\nexposure to war was not overwhelming, compared with those\nwith a weak commitment. Children with a weak ideological\ncommitment reported more anxiety and insecurity, depression\nand failure, lack of social support, and bad family relations.\nPunam\u00e4ki concluded that \"children's responses are based, at\nleast in part, on the interpretations and meanings they attribute\nto these events\" (p. 67). Similarly, for Palestinian youth\ninvolved in the Intifada movement, political violence was not\nassociated with youth problems (Barber, 2001). Barber\nascribes this to the meaning youth appeared to attribute to the\nconflict and their commitment to the social and political prin-\nciples underlying it.\nDreaming and playing games may also play a role in help-\ning children to process their traumatic experiences. In a study\nof Palestinian children who recorded their dreams, different\ncharacteristics of dreams were associated with the presence\nor absence of psychological symptoms (Punam\u00e4ki, 1998).\nFor example, children who reported more repetitious,\nunpleasant, and aggressive characteristics in their dreams\nalso reported more psychological symptoms. Conversely, for\nchildren whose dreams were bizarre, vivid, active, and\ninvolved joyful feelings and happy endings, their traumatic\nexposure was not associated with psychological symptoms.\nThese findings led Punam\u00e4ki (1998) to conclude that \"the\nprotective role of dreaming means that traumatic events are\nnot associated with mental health symptoms if children's\ndreams incorporate beneficial and/or lack dysfunctional\ncharacteristics\" (p. 580). Results from a study by Helminen\nand Punam\u00e4ki (2008) also demonstrate how \"high intensity\nand low negative, and high positive\" images in dreams may\nprotect the mental health of children exposed to trauma.\nChildren who had been exposed to trauma had less post-trau-\nmatic symptoms when their dreams included images that\nwere intensive and positive. Correlations between exposure\nto military trauma and anxiety and aggressiveness were not\nfound in children who had low negative images in their\ndreams. A major theme in interviews with Iraqi children was\ntheir interest in war games (Al-Mashat et al., 2006). This\nmay demonstrate a way children attempt to process and make\nsense of the trauma they have experienced.\nBoth Tibetan child-refugees and school officials spoke of\nstrong religious beliefs as a protective and healing factor\nessential for recovery from stress-related, post-traumatic\nsymptoms (Servan-Schreiber et al., 1998). Newcomer refu-\ngee youth resettled in Canada after escaping war in their\nhome country of Afghanistan spoke of seeking strength from\nGod in times of difficulty (Kanji & Cameron, 2010). South\nSudanese children living in a refugee camp in Uganda identi-\nfied praying as a coping behavior (Paardekooper et al., 1999).\nLikewise, Iraqi children identified prayer and reading the\nKoran as giving them a sense of comfort and strength, help-\ning to minimize their fears (Al-Mashat et al., 2006). Even in\nthe face of violence, poverty, and destruction, two thirds of\ninternally displaced Bosnian children still believed life was\nworth living (Goldstein et al., 1997). This statistic suggests\nthat these children were able to hold onto the belief that good\nthings in life were still possible. Likewise, refugee children\nwere able to articulate a sense of hope and sources of hope\nduring early years of adjustment in Canada (Yohani &\nSadly, not all war-affected children are able to maintain a\npositive outlook on life. Approximately half of surveyed\ninternally displaced Bosnian children reported feeling pessi-\nmistic about the future after the civil war in formerYugoslavia\n(Goldstein et al., 1997). Some children develop a sense of\nforeshortened future (Al-Mashat et al., 2006), believing they\nwould not survive until adulthood (Al-Mashat et al., 2006;\na study of Israeli youth, future orientation was not found to\nbe associated with exposure to terror (Solomon & Lavi,\n2005). Interestingly, the most optimistic youth in this study\nhad experienced the most intensive terror and reported the\nhighest PTSD symptomatology. Feelings of fear and hope-\nlessness are a paradoxical situation for war-affected children\nand adolescents. Although loss of hope is not a helpful\nresponse to trauma, it is also representative of a possible real-\nity for children in war-torn areas. Even if children escape the\ninitial violence of bombings, shootings, and assault, they\nmust still contend with the lack of food, clean water, sanita-\ntion, shelter, and health services - which often follow war.\nSummary\nThis article examined whether the psychosocial systems of\nsafety, attachment, identity, justice, and existential meaning\nfound in theADAPT model (2006) are represented in a review\nof research from the last 20 years on the experiences and\nneeds of war-affected children and adolescents. The intention\nwas to explore whether this model has potential to serve as a\nguide for research and practice with war-affected children\ngiven its attention to adaptive and maladaptive responses to\nwar-trauma. The review is limited by its \"wide-net\" approach\nincorporating literature on war-affected children in conflict,\npost-conflict, and resettlement settings. While this was cho-\nsen to capture studies addressing adaptive and maladaptive\nresponses in all five domains, it resulted in an overemphasis\nof literature on refugees. Future reviews can utilize a more\nfocused approach by conducting systematic reviews of one\ndomain and sub-population of war-affected children.\nResults suggest that research with war-affected children\nhas covered all five psychosocial pillars in the model thereby\nshowing promise as a meta-theory for conceptualizing the\npsychosocial experiences of war-affected children. However,\nthe review highlighted the research community's emphasis\non the safety domain with most studies focusing on the iden-\ntification of PTSD in children and adolescents. This mirrors\nthe fact that much of the research on war-affected individuals\nis conducted by clinical psychologists or psychiatrists whose\ninstruments rely on the respective clinical manuals (ICD or\nDSM). The focus on safety is followed by research within the\nattachment domain. Research in this area emphasizes the\nrole of social supports and caregivers as protective factors\nand resources for children's adaptation after mass violence\nand familial losses. Maladaptive responses to such losses are\nsimilar to those found within the safety domain and include\nPTSD, depression, and anxiety as the main outcomes of\nthreats to attachment systems. Safety and attachment are\nhighly salient, interconnected needs for children that do not\nfunction in isolation, and it may be difficult to tease apart\nwhether disorders such as PTSD are responses to safety vio-\nlations, attachment violations, or both. However, from a\ntheoretical point of view, the ADAPT model suggests that\ngrief and depressive reactions are maladaptive responses to\nlosses accumulated from threats to attachment systems.\nFuture research with war-affected children may clarify this\nfurther with the recent expansion of criteria for PTSD and\ninclusion of other trauma-related disorders in the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5;\nThis review shows that the least amount of research was\nfound within the domains of identity, justice, and meaning.\nGiven the significance of these areas in child and adolescent\ndevelopment, future research and interventions should exam-\nine adaptive and maladaptive responses in these three areas\nto expand our knowledge base of children's experiences\nbeyond the emphasis on safety and attachment. For example,\nare conduct and severe anger problems in war-affected ado-\nlescents a maladaptive response to threats to injustice? If so,\nwhat types of interventions can be implemented to ensure\nadolescents experience resolution and positive adaption in\nthe aftermath of such threats? How do we address young\npeople's meaning-making systems in conflicts involving\nthreats to religious ideologies and places of worship? Finally,\nit is worth noting that the areas covered in the ADAPT model\nand this review were equally covered in Machel's (United\nNations, 1996) Impact of Armed Conflict on Children report\nalmost 20 years ago. Although children and adolescents con-\ntinue to be adversely affected in war, the research commu-\nnity has now amassed substantial empirical evidence giving\nus insight into the nature and impact of trauma and of mass\nviolence on children. Going forward, there is also a need to\nplace emphasis on researching interventions that build on\nsuch evidence. Research that explores institutional policies\nand practices that support interventions for children and fam-\nilies in post-conflict and resettlement environments should\nalso consider socio-ecological frameworks. As such, as the\nADAPT model can be a guide to ensure psychosocial\ndomains of safety, attachment, human rights/justice, identity,\nand existential meaning are equally addressed.\n"
