One explanation for the observed illusion involves retinal shifts caused by small\ninvoluntary eye movements that observers make while they try to maintain fixation. Earlier studies\nhave suggested a prominent role of the most conspicuous of these eye movements, small rapid\nposition shifts called microsaccades. Here, we present data that could expand this view with a\ndifferent interpretation. In three experiments, we recorded participants' eye movements while they\ntried to maintain visual fixation when being presented with variants of Bridget Riley's Fall, which\nwere manipulated such as to vary the strength of induced motion. In the first two experiments, we\ninvestigated the properties of microsaccades for a set of stimuli with known motion strengths. In\nagreement with earlier observations, microsaccade rates were unaffected by the stimulus pattern and,\nconsequently, the strength of induced motion illusion. In the third experiment, we varied the stimulus\npattern across a larger range of parameters and asked participants to rate the perceived motion\nillusion. The results revealed that motion illusions in patterns resembling Riley's Fall are perceived\neven in the absence of microsaccades, and that the reported strength of the illusion decreased with\nthe number of microsaccades in the trial. Together, the three experiments suggest that other sources\nof retinal image instability than microsaccades, such as slow oculomotor drift, should be considered\nas possible factors contributing to the illusion.\n",

One\ntype of illusion that has been studied extensively is illusory motion, such as instances in\nwhich a static image results in a strong motion percept, although no physical motion is\npresent. These illusions were used by artists as a way to convey motion in images composed\nof simple black and white patterns. One example, which will be the focus of the present study,\nis the painting Fall by the Op artist Bridget Riley, in which an ensemble of black and white\nundulating lines induces a strong motion percept, often reported as a 'shimmering' motion.\nOther motion illusions, with possibly different underlying mechanisms or combinations of\nunderlying mechanisms, exist, such as the Enigma illusion, consisting of radial lines with\nWorks of arts like Riley's Fall and the Enigma illusion have received considerable interest\nfrom vision scientist debating the origin of the perceived motion illusions in static patterns.\nThree possible causes of the illusion have been discussed in the last half century (for a\nreview, see Troncoso et al 2008). First, it was proposed that the illusions were caused by\nthe accommodation movements of the eyes (eg, Campbell and Robson 1958), as, in some\nsituations, the illusion was abolished when looking through a pinhole (Gregory 1993, 1994).\nSecond, ruling out retinal causes when different patterns of brain activation were found for\nreal and illusory motion, cortical mechanism have been proposed to underlie such illusions\n(Zeki et al 1993; Zeki 1994). Finally, it has been suggested that small eye movements during\nvisual fixation, known as fixational eye movements, play an important role in the illusion\nWe here focus on the role of fixational eye movements. These eye movements during\nvisual fixation can be classified into three categories (eg, Martinez-Conde 2006; Martinez-\nthe eye during attempted fixation of a relatively large amplitude (but generally less than 1 deg\nof visual angle) and high velocity. Microsaccades tend to occur in both eyes simultaneously\nand appear to have properties similar to saccadic eye movements (Otero-Milan et al 2008).\nSecond, there is slow oculomotor drift, which are also relatively large movements of the eye,\nbut with velocities that are much smaller than those observed for microsaccades. Third, there\nis tremor, which are fast but small amplitude eye movements, which can occur in just one\neye at a time. Microsaccades have been implicated in motion illusions (Troncoso et al 2008;\nZanker and Walker 2004), but slow drift is also suspected to play a role (Zanker and Walker\n2004). The contribution of microsaccades to the motion illusion in, for example, the painting\nFall can be understood as follows. During microsaccadic displacements of the eyes, the\nprojected image is shifted across the retina. Because of the particular pattern of alternating\nblack and white curves in the painting, the human motion system interprets these shifts as\nmotion, rather than changes in the direction of eye gaze (Zanker and Walker 2004). A second\nmechanism, however, could also play a role. Microsaccades are known to help prevent fading\nof the retinal image (eg, Martinez-Conde et al 2006). As a consequence, microsaccades could\ninduce a transient spiking response of neural activity, which could add to the illusion of\nmotion in the images.\nSeveral lines of research provided evidence for the role of microsaccades in motion\nillusions. First, it has been shown that the motion illusion in patterns resembling Riley's Fall\nis weakened when the retinal image is stabilized, for example, by presenting the artwork as\nan after-image (Zanker et al 2003). Second, a direct relation was found between the strength\nof the streaming-like motion in the Enigma illusion and the occurrence of microsaccades\n(Troncoso et al 2008). Finally, computational modelling of motion perception in patterns\nresembling Riley's Fall suggested that the alternating patterns of black and white curves\nin this illusion induced a large range of motion directions for displacements of the retinal\nimage, in agreement with the suggestion that the human motion system is confused by\nimages inducing illusory motion. Control images, in contrast, induced only a single direction\nof motion, corresponding to the direction of the retinal shift (Zanker and Walker 2004).\nWhereas findings such as those described above provide compelling evidence that\nmicrosaccades can be sufficient to facilitate the perception of illusory motion, it needs\nto be kept in mind that microsaccades occur at a relatively rare rate. Most studies report\nfrequencies in human observers under standard conditions in the order of one microsaccade\nper second (eg, Engbert and Kliegl 2003b). As a consequence, the duration of the interval\nbetween microsaccades can be relatively long, and it is rather possible that no microsaccades\noccur during brief stimulus presentations, while motion illusions have been found for stimuli\npresented as briefly as 250ms (Zanker et al 2010). Given the relatively low frequency of\nmicrosaccades, it therefore needs to be assumed that their effects on the motion system are\nreasonably long-lasting if they were the full explanation of the motion illusion.\n1.1 The analysis of fixational eye movements\nSeveral algorithms have been used to analyze eye movement recordings for microsaccades.\nHowever, in direct comparisons these have been reported to provide similar results (Otero-\nthe often used algorithm developed by Engbert and Kliegl (2003b). In this algorithm, the\noverall noise in the velocity of the eye is estimated from the two-dimensional distribution\nof instantaneous horizontal and vertical speed components (Figure 1; bottom panels). The\nvelocity of the eye at each point in time is then compared to a threshold derived from the\namount of noise. Signals that exceed the threshold for some amount of time, and that occur\nbinocularly (ie, in both eyes simultaneously), are classified as microsaccades which can be\neasily verified in two-dimensional position diagrams (Figure 1; top panels, green segments\nof eye trajectory). Microsaccades detected with this algorithm follow the main sequence\n(Figure 1b), an approximately linear relation between the amplitude of the saccade and the\npeak velocity of the eye movement (Zuber et al 1965), suggesting that microsaccades are\ngenerated by a similar mechanism as are regular saccades (Hafed et al 2009).\n1.2 The influence of Op Art on fixational eye movements\nAs indicated above, considerable evidence points towards the involvement of fixational eye\nmovements in the occurrence of visual motion illusions (eg, Laubrock et al 2008; Troncoso et\nalso be at work. Because of the motion signals that motion illusions seem to induce in the\nvisual system system (Zanker 2004), it could also be possible that the additional fixational\ninstability is induced by the illusion itself, increasing the number and/or amplitude of\ndifferent types of fixational eye movements. If such increased fixational instability occurs, it\nis expected that when the strength of illusory motion of a stimulus increases, more fixational\neye movements can be found. In a study comparing stimuli inducing weak and strong motion\nillusions, no increase in microsaccades was found (Zanker et al 2003; Zanker and Walker\n2004), suggesting no link between the perceived motion illusion and fixational instability\n(see also Troncoso et al 2008). We here investigate this issue further by inspecting aspects of\nmicrosaccades going beyond their frequency, such as amplitudes and directions for patterns\nthat elicit different illusion strengths (Experiments 1 and 2). Moreover, we will make a direct\ncomparison of the perceived motion illusion and the occurrence of microsaccades, by asking\nparticipants to first fixate a stimulus for a fixed interval and then to rate the perceived motion\nstrength (Experiment 3). By comparing trials with many and trials with few microsaccades,\nthe relation between microsaccades and perceived illusory motion can be examined.\nWe conducted three experiments. In the first two experiments, we made use of stimuli\nintroduced in a previous study, and of which the strength of the perceived illusion was\ntherefore known beforehand (Zanker et al 2010). The study by Zanker and colleagues provided\na new psychophysical method to measure the strength of illusory motion perceived when\nlooking at synthetic versions of Riley's Fall (called `Riloids'), which vary in the spatial layout\nof the undulating lines, as illustrated in Figure 2. A critical element of the psychophysical\nmethod was an independent manipulation of illusion strength by mixing Riloids with regular\narrays of high-contrast squares that on their own are perceived as firmly static (illustrated\nin Figure 3b). The main finding of the study was that the strength of the motion illusion\ngrows with the amplitude (A) and the spatial period (\u00b5) of the wave-like undulations of the\nline gratings, but was unaffected by the spatial wavelength of the gratings (). In addition,\nwe observed that the strength of the motion illusion was not influenced by the presence or\nabsence of a fixation target (Zanker et al 2010). This latter finding provides an interesting\nopportunity to determine how the motion illusion relates to certain aspects of fixational eye\nmovements. For example, if it were found that the presence of a fixation target increases the\nfrequency of microsaccades, without affecting motion illusion strength, this would suggest\nthat the exact frequency of microsaccades is not directly related to observing the illusion.\nThese predictions were further tested in a third experiment, in which we used a broad range of\nRiloid patterns, varying several stimulus parameters. Because of this large range of randomly\npresented stimuli, we could ask participants to rate the strength of the illusion on each trial,\nwithout giving them an opportunity to base their responses mainly on their impression of\nFigure 1. (a) Illustration of the algorithm used to detect microsaccades (Engbert and Kliegl 2003b). The\nred dashed lines in the velocity plots (bottom row of subplots) for both eyes (left and right subplots)\nindicate the (noise-dependent) thresholds for microsaccade detection. In green: The section of the\ntrace belonging to the microsaccade, also shown in the position plots (top row). (b) Microsaccades\nhave often been shown to follow the main sequence--an approximately linear relation between the\namplitude of the eye movement and the peak velocity. This linear relation is also found for the present\nset of data (observations for Experiment 1, 2, and 3, shown in red, blue, and green, respectively).\nthe stimulus layout, by trying to respond as consistently as possible (as could, for example,\noccur for mixtures of Riloids and checker patterns, where observers might rate the strength of\nthe checker pattern in the background rather than the perceived motion illusion per se). By\nobtaining ratings for the strength of the perceived motion and by recording eye movements\non every single trial, a more stringent association could be obtained between the occurrence\nof microsaccades and the motion illusion.\nFigure 2. Examples of different 'Riloids' (parametric versions of the painting Fall by Bridget Riley),\nshowing the influence of different parameters on the pattern: phase modulation amplitude A, phase\nmodulation wavelength \u00b5, and grating period . In psychophysical experiments (Zanker et al 2010), it\nwas shown that variations of the amplitude (A) and the spatial period of phase modulation (\u00b5) affected\nthe strength of the illusion, whereas the spatial wavelength () had little effect.\nIn Experiment 1, we investigated whether characteristics of microsaccades are related to the\nstrength of the motion illusion. To vary the strength of the illusion, different contrast ratios\nwere used for a mixture of a regular array of squares with a Riloid pattern (see Figure 3; for\ndetails, see Zanker et al 2010). Participants were asked to maintain fixation while looking at\nan image, first presented together with a fixation target, which was later removed.\nSeven participants took part in Experiment 1. Four participants were naive with respect to the\npurpose of the experiment, whereas the others (three lab members) had heard about the aim\nof the experiment before taking part in it. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal\nvision and gave their informed consent before taking part in the study, which was approved\nby the local ethics committee.\nStimuli were presented on a 21 inch CRT screen (refresh rate of 100Hz) controlled by an AMD\nAthlon 2400+ PC using the Experimental Builder software package (SR Research Osgood, ON,\nCanada). Binocular eye movements were recorded with an Eyelink II system (SR Research\nOsgood, ON, Canada) at a rate of 500Hz (pupil only mode) by means of a second, Pentium 4,\nPC. The Eyelink II system allows for eye movements to be recorded at a spatial resolution of\nless than 0.01 degrees and an accuracy of at least 0.5 degrees. A standard 9-point calibration\nroute was performed before each 12th trial. An additional drift correction preceded each\ntrial, in which participants were asked to fixate a centrally presented fixation target and press\nthe spacebar of a computer keyboard, to correct for drift in the recorded eye position due\nto possible slippage of the head-band to which the cameras of the system were mounted.\nParticipants viewed the computer screen from a distance of 57cm, which was maintained by\nmeans of a chin rest.\nFigure 3a illustrates the stimulus sequence. Each trial started with a bullseye fixation target\nof 1.2 deg, consisting of two rings partitioned in four patches alternating in colour from red\nto white, presented at the centre of a white screen. After 3s, a stimulus pattern measuring\n23 deg by 23 deg was presented behind the fixation symbol. Another 3s later, the fixation\nsymbol was removed.\nA basic Riloid pattern was constructed using the equations reported earlier (Zanker and\nWalker 2004), with a modulation amplitude (A) of 32 pixels and modulation wavelengths (\u00b5)\nequal to 400 and 130 pixels (top and the bottom, respectively). The grating period () was set\nto 8 pixels.\nThis basic Riloid pattern was mixed with a regular pattern consisting of 16 evenly\ndistributed squares each measuring 3 deg. The space between the checkers equalled 3 deg\nand the distance to the edge was 1.5 deg. Three different weights were used for mixing the\nof Riloids and square pattern, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 3b (indicated by the Riloid\ncontrast in the mixture, c). From an earlier study (Zanker et al 2010), these three combined\npatterns were known to induce weak, medium, and strong motion illusions, respectively.\nParticipants completed a total of 36 trials, which were presented in three different exper-\nimental blocks of 12 trials each. In these blocks four trials of each of the three combined\nRiloid and square patterns were presented in a random order.\nParticipants started each trial by looking at the central fixation target of the drift correction\nprocedure and pressing the spacebar on the keyboard in front of them. After releasing\nthe spacebar, the stimulus sequence shown in Figure 3a was presented. Participants were\ninstructed to fixate the fixation target and to maintain fixation on this location during the\nentire sequence, after which they were free to move their eyes. In addition to maintaining\nfixation, participants were asked to avoid blinking until the end of the stimulus presentation.\nAfter the presentation of the sequence, participants could take as much time as they wanted\nuntil starting the next trial. Typically, participants took about 4 to 10s before moving on to\nthe next trial.\nThe measured horizontal and vertical gaze positions were analysed for microsaccades using\nthe algorithm by Engbert and Kliegl (2003b). Microsaccades were defined as movements of\nthe eye for which the horizontal and vertical velocity exceeded a set criterion, based on the\noverall noise in the signal (6 standard deviations of velocity fluctuations), for at least 6ms in\nboth eyes. An additional amplitude criterion of less than 30 pixels (1.13 degrees) was used,\nremoving the data from accidental saccades to different areas of the screen.\nFigure 3. (a) Stimulus sequence in Experiment 1. Participants were asked to maintain visual fixation for\n9s, at a location that was first indicated by a fixation target that was presented on a white background\nfor 3s, followed by the Riloid pattern (and fixation target) for 3s, after which the fixation symbol was\nremoved for another three s. (b) Riloid patterns used in Experiment 1, with contrast mixtures between\nthe Riloid and the square pattern indicated by the contrast of the Riloid component in the mixture,\nParticipants made on average 0.91 microsaccades per second, with microsaccade rates\nvarying from 0.39 to 1.37 per second between participants. Microsaccade rates also varied\nsubstantially within trials, with the highest rate found early after the onset of the fixation\npoint and the lowest rate at the end of the trial (see Figure 4a), showing an overall decay of\nthe rate with prolonged fixation (see also, Zanker et al 2003).\nFigure 4b illustrates the effect of the fixation condition (fixation symbol only, fixation and\nstimulus pattern, stimulus pattern only) and the contrast-ratio in the mixed pattern on the\nrate of occurrence of microsaccades across participants. Whereas the fixation condition, or\ntime in the trial, had a huge effect on the number of microsaccades, no such an effect was\nfound of the relative contrast of the two components. These observations were confirmed\nby a repeated measures analysis of variance, testing these two factors and their interaction,\nthe absence of a main effect of contrast ratio (F2,12 = 0.59, p = 0.57) or an interaction between\nImportant for understanding the role of microsaccades in the motion illusion might\nnot only be the rate but also the amplitude of the microsaccades, because this determines\nhow far the retinal image shifts during each microsaccade. In Figure 4c a histogram of the\nmicrosaccade amplitudes is plotted as an average across stimulus conditions, trial intervals,\nand participants, showing that the majority of the detected microsaccades had amplitudes in\nthe 0.1 to 0.5 deg range and that few (micro)saccades occurred with amplitudes larger than\nthe cut-off value of 1.13 deg (or 30 pixels). In Figure 4d the role of the fixation interval and\nrelative contrast of the two components (Riloid and squares) on the amplitude saccades is\ninvestigated, revealing no effect of either factor, which was confirmed in a repeated measures\nA second important variable of gaze stability is the direction of the microsaccades, which\nfor the illusion determines the direction of the shift of the retinal image. In Figure 4e the\nmicrosaccade rates are shown for the four cardinal directions (rightward, upward, leftward,\ndownward) for the three stimulus intervals and three different relative contrast of the two\nstimulus components. The following observations can be made. First, microsaccade rates\ndecrease across the three intervals, in agreement with Figures 4a and 4b. Second, more\nmicrosaccades are found in horizontal (leftward, rightward) than in vertical directions\n(upward, downward). Third, no systematic differences in the direction of microsaccades are\nfound for the different contrast conditions. The statistical significance of these observations\nwas tested using a three-way repeated measures analysis of variance, testing differences in\nmicrosaccade direction (horizontal versus vertical), differences due to the fixation interval\n(fixation, stimulus plus fixation and stimulus only), and the relative contrast (c = 0.1, c = 0.5,\neffect of the direction of the microsaccade (horizontal versus vertical; F1,6 = 9.67, p = 0.021).\nThe interaction between the interval and the direction was also significant (F2,12 = 4.23, p =\n0.041). The remaining interactions and main effects did not reach significance.\nIn Experiment 1 we investigated the properties of the small saccadic eye movements during\nvisual fixation of stimuli that induce illusory motion with varying strength. Our results suggest\nthat microsaccade properties (rates, amplitudes, directions) are not related to the strength of\nthe motion illusion. Whereas the particular stimulus pattern did not affect microsaccades,\nthe rate at which they occurred, varied with the stimulus interval and therefore possibly with\nthe type visual stimulation (fixation symbol or Riloid). Higher rates were found when the\nscreen contained just a fixation symbol, whereas lower rates were found when the Riloid\npattern was presented. Microsaccade amplitudes, in contrast, were not significantly different\nfor the different intervals of visual stimulation.\nOur findings agree with earlier observations (Zanker et al 2003; Zanker and Walker 2004),\nwho found that microsaccade rates were not influenced by the type of visual stimulus (either\na pattern inducing illusory motion, or uniform grey field or checkerboard control patterns\nwhich were perceived as static). Zanker and colleagues (Zanker et al 2003; Zanker and Walker\n2004) also observed that during the course of visual fixation the rate of microsaccades\ndecreased. It is therefore possible that the difference that we observed of the presence of the\nfixation symbol could be the consequence of prolonged fixation rather than being related to\nthe fixation stimulus. This possibility is investigated in a second experiment, in which the\npresence or absence is varied across rather than within trials.\nFigure 4. Microsaccade properties. (a) Microsaccade rate as a function of the time from trial onset\nacross all conditions. (b) Microsaccade rate for each contrast condition and stimulus interval. (c)\nHistogram of observed microsaccade amplitudes. (d) Microsaccade amplitudes for each contrast\ncondition and stimulus interval. (e) Microsaccade rates for the four cardinal directions (rightward,\nupward, leftward, downward) for the three stimulus intervals (fixation, fixation+stimulus pattern,\nstimulus pattern only) and stimulus conditions (relative contrast of 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9). Averages are\nbased on data of all seven participants. Error bars and shaded intervals in time-course plots show the\nstandard error of the mean.\nIn Experiment 2, we investigated whether the effects of the fixation symbol found in\nExperiment 1 were due to prolonged fixation by varying the presence or absence of the\nfixation symbol across trials.\nEight new participants took part in the experiment. Except for author FH, participants were\nstudents at Royal Holloway University, taking part in return for course credit.\nThe stimulus sequence in Experiment 2 is illustrated in Figure 5a. Trials started with the\npresentation of a fixation target, after which the composite stimulus pattern appeared. With\nthe presentation of the stimulus pattern, the fixation symbol either remained (Figure 5a, left)\nor was removed from the display (Figure 5a, right).\nThe basic Riloid pattern was changed with respect to Experiment 1, by setting the\nmodulation amplitude (A) to 24 (instead of 32) pixels, and the modulation wavelength\n(\u00b5) to a constant of 200 pixels across the entire pattern (instead of changing from 400 to\n130 pixels from top to bottom) to better match the stimuli used by Zanker et al (2010). In\naddition to using a set of stimuli with the same three contrast mixtures as in Experiment 1,\na second set was created in which the overall contrast of the pattern was strongly reduced\n(see Figure 5b) to test for the effects of the contrast of the pattern, which has been shown to\nstrongly affect the motion illusion (Zanker et al 2010). By adding these low-contrast stimuli,\nthe number of trials doubled to 72 (12 repetition of each of 6 contrast conditions).\nExcept for the above changes to the design (using two trial intervals), to the basic Riloid\npattern, and the inclusion of the low-contrast stimuli, all methods used in Experiment 2 were\nidentical to those used in Experiment 1.\nFigure 5. (a) Stimulus sequence of Experiment 2. Trials all started with the presentation of a fixation\ntarget for 1s. After presentation of the fixation symbol, the stimulus pattern appeared for 3s, whilst\nthe fixation target was still present on the screen (left panel, in 50% of the trials) or disappeared\n(right panel, in the other 50% of trials). (b) Composite stimulus patterns used in Experiment 2. The\nhigh-contrast patterns (top row) had the same contrast mixtures of Riloids and square patterns as\nthose used in Experiment 1. Low-contrast stimuli were added, in which the overall contrast of the\nstimulus was strongly reduced (bottom row).\nAs for Experiment 1, microsaccade rates were found to vary considerably between partici-\npants. The lowest rate observed was 0.52 per second, whereas the largest rate was 1.82 per\nsecond. On average, participants generated 1.08 microsaccades per second. Figure 6 presents\nan overview of different microsaccade properties, with the average plots (b, d, e) showing the\ndata for the high-contrast stimuli. Those for the low-contrast stimuli are shown in Figure 7.\nFigure 6a shows the microsaccade rate as a function of the time after the onset of the trial,\nbased on the data across all conditions, displaying a pattern quite similar to that observed\nfor Experiment 1. Just after the onset of the fixation point, the microsaccade rate shows a\nshort dip, followed by a marked increase. After the onset of the stimulus pattern, a distinct\ndip in the rate is found, followed by a shallow rebound and slow drop-off.\nFigure 6b plots the microsaccade rate for the different stimulus conditions for the high-\ncontrast stimuli. The microsaccade rate during the presentation of the fixation target and\nwhite background was remarkably larger than during the presentation of the composite\nstimulus (with or without the fixation symbol), in agreement with the data of Experiment\n1. This higher rate is likely to be the consequence of the huge rise in the microsaccade\nafter fixation onset. Interestingly, the rates are also higher during the presentation of the\ncomposite stimulus with the fixation target than without the fixation symbol, demonstrating\nthat the difference observed in Experiment 1 was not solely due to prolonged fixation. A\nrepeated measures analysis of variance was used to investigate the statistical significance\nof the differences between conditions.

When the two stimulus trial sequences are compared, a significant main effect of the\npresence of the fixation target is found (F1,7 = 15.1, p = 0.06), in the absence of a main effect\nFigure 6c shows a histogram of observed microsaccade amplitudes, showing a similar\npattern to that observed in Experiment 1, with most microsaccades of amplitudes of 0.4 deg\nor less. Figure 6d plots the microsaccade amplitude for the different conditions with overall\nhigh-contrast. As in Experiment 1, no clear effects of the interval or trial sequence or relative\ncontrast on microsaccade amplitude can be detected. This observation was confirmed with\na repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), showing non-significant main effects\nof the interval--fixation target on white background versus composite stimulus with or\ninteraction between the two factors (F4,28 = 1.23, p = 0.32). Also, when the two composite\nstimulus intervals were compared directly, no significant main effects--with and without\nIn Figure 6e the microsaccade rates in the different directions (right, down, left, up) are\ndisplayed. Interestingly, no clear bias towards horizontal directions was observed during\nthe presentation of the fixation target on a white background (left panel). During the\npresentation of the composite stimulus (with or without a fixation target; middle and right\npanels, respectively), the bias towards the horizontal directions was restored. During the\npresentation of the composite stimulus together with the fixation symbol, there appears to\nbe stronger bias towards the horizontal for the stimuli with low relative contrast. Using a\nthree-way repeated measures ANOVA, the statistical significance of the differences between\nthe rates for horizontal and vertical microsaccades as well as the effects of the interval and\nthe relative contrast were tested. A significant main effect of the interval was found (F2,14\n= 5.84, p = 0.014). The main effect of microsaccade direction (horizontal versus vertical),\nhowever, failed to reach significance (F1,7 = 5.25, p = 0.056). The interactions and the main\neffect of relative contrast were not statistically significant either.\nIn Figure 7 we investigate whether the pattern of results changes by changing the overall\ncontrast of the stimuli. Whereas the microsaccade rates are very similar to those observed\nfor the high overall contrast stimuli, the microsaccade amplitudes show an increase during\nthe presentation of the Riloid without a fixation point. As for the high-contrast stimuli, the\nonly factor that significantly affected microsaccades rates for the low-contrast stimuli was\nFigure 6. Properties of microsaccades observed in Experiment 2.

Error bars and intervals show the standard error\nof the mean across participants.\nOne of the explanations of illusory motion in stimuli like Riley's Fall involves the shift of\nthe retinal image caused by microsaccades. Such retinal shifts induce a complex pattern\nin the human motion system, which resembles the subjective experience of a shimmering\nmotion in the illusion (Zanker 2004; Zanker et al 2010). To test this explanation of illusory\nmotion in Fall, we investigated the relation between the illusion strength and properties of\nmicrosaccades occurring during the inspection of the image in Experiments 1 and 2. Stimuli\nwith known illusion strengths from a previous study (from Zanker et al 2010) were used, and\nmicrosaccade properties were examined across the different images. No clear differences\nwere found in the patterns of microsaccades for the different stimuli reflecting different\nmotion illusion strengths, suggesting that rates, amplitudes and directions of microsaccades\nare not associated with the strength of the motion illusion. One possible issue, however, could\nbe that by relying on stimuli with known illusion strengths, small trial by trial fluctuations in\nthe perceived motion strength might not be detectable. In Experiment 3, we therefore took a\nlarger set of stimuli (by varying several parameters of the Riloids, without any checkers in\nthe background), so that we could ask participants to rate the perceived illusion strength\non a trial by trial basis, without risking that participants would respond to each stimulus\nin a stereotyped way by memorizing the previously given response for a certain stimulus.\nThis larger set of stimuli therefore had the advantage that participants might report trial\nby trial variations in the perceived motion strength, possibly caused by differences in the\nfixational eye movements made on that trial. By comparing trials with few and trials with\nmany microsaccades, it can be investigated whether retinal shifts from microsaccades are an\nimportant factor in the motion illusion in Riley's Fall or whether other explanations of the\nillusion might be required.\nFourteen new participants and author FH participated in Experiment 3, resulting in a total\nof fifteen participants (thirteen female, average age 19.3 years). The new participants were\nstudents from the University of Leuven taking part in return for course credit. The apparatus\nwas very similar to that used in Experiments 1 and 2. An Eyelink II system (the same model\nas in Experiments 1 and 2) was used to record the eye movements. Stimuli were presented on\nand 2). Participants were seated at a distance of 60 cm from the screen (57 cm in Experiments\n1 and 2), maintained by a chin rest.\nStimuli were constructed using the equations from Zanker et al (2003), in which the\nmodulation amplitude (A) was set to either of 6 or 36 pixels (minimum and maximum values\nand the bottom had the same modulation periods), and the overall contrast (c) either to 0.1,\n() was set to same values as in Experiments 1 and 2, namely 8 pixels. The size of the stimuli\n1 and 2). Each of the resulting 12 stimuli was presented six times to each participant, resulting\nin 72 trials per participant, three times with a fixation point superimposed on the image and\nthree times without the fixation point.\nBefore the start of the experiment, participants performed at least 5 practice trials,\nrandomly chosen from the set of 72 trials. During these practice trials, it was made sure\nthat participants maintained fixation during the presentation of the stimuli. The practice\ntrials also allowed participants to obtain an impression of the types of stimuli and their\nelicited motion illusions so that they could establish a baseline to determine what to consider\nas strong and weak motion illusions.\nThe trial structure was the same as in Experiment 2, with the fixation point presented for\n1s, before the stimulus was presented for 3s (with or without the fixation point superimposed).\nAfter the offset of the stimulus, participants were asked to indicate the strength of the motion\nillusion induced by the stimulus on a three point scale (1 = weak, 2 = medium, 3 = strong\nmotion illusion). Feedback after their button press confirmed their choice. Every 12 trials,\nparticipants were allowed a short break before continuing with the remainder of the trials.\nFigure 8 provides an overview of the motion illusion ratings of the participants. Generally,\nparticipants more often responded with lower values for the perceived motion strength (top\nthe average rating depended on the different parameters of the stimuli and presentation. In\nline with earlier studies (Zanker et al 2003; Zanker et al 2010), larger values for the modulation\namplitude (A) resulted in higher ratings of the perceived illusion strength (t14 = 2.45, p\n= 0.028). Also in line with earlier observations (Zanker et al 2010), lower values for the\ncontrast), in agreement with earlier findings (Zanker et al 2010). The presence of the fixation\nsymbol did not significantly influence the strength of the illusion (t15 = 1.93, p = 0.074), in\nagreement with earlier observations, showing that similar results are obtained when the\nfixation point is shown in between two stimuli (Zanker et al 2010) or in the centre of a single\nstimulus (present study).\nFigure 8. Average ratings and response frequencies for Experiment 3. The top-left plot shows the\nrelative frequency of the different ratings across observers, showing a bias towards weaker (rating of\n1 or 2) reported illusion strengths. The remaining plots show the average rating as a function of the\ndifferent parameter values or conditions. The middle plots show that stronger ratings are obtained\nfor stimuli with larger modulation amplitudes (`A') and smaller modulation periods (`\u00b5'). The bottom\nplots shows a significant, but weaker effect of the contrast (`c'), and no significant effect of the presence\n(or absence) of a fixation point.\nFigure 9 provides an overview of the microsaccade findings, linking the ratings on each\ntrial to the frequency and amplitude of the microsaccades. The frequency of microsaccades\nduring the trial (Figure 9a) showed a similar profile as in Experiment 2 (Figure 6a), showing\ntwo responses: One to the onset of the fixation symbol (t = 0ms; left of red line) and one to\nthe onset of the Riloid stimulus (t=1000ms; right of red line). Whereas we found no influence\nof the strength of the illusion in the previous two experiments, the trial by trial analysis of\nExperiment 3 revealed an inverse relation between the perceived strength of the motion\nillusion and the microsaccade rate. For example, it was found that microsaccades were\nmore often completely absent (0 microsaccades in a 3s interval; Figure 9b) when the illusion\nmicrosaccades were made, the lower the motion illusion ratings (Figure 9c; F1,14 = 8.54,\np = 0.011; linear contrast). Pairwise comparisons between trials with zero microsaccades\nand trials with one, two, three, or four microsaccades show that only for trials with two\nmicrosaccades, the difference in the rating of the illusion strength compared to trials with\nzero microsaccades fails to reach significance (t14 = 1.99, p = 0.066). For trials with one\n0.028--although this latter comparison fails to reach statistical significance if the stringent\nBonferroni correction is applied, setting the critical alpha level to 0.0125, for 4 comparisons),\nthe average motion illusion rating was always significantly lower compared to trials without\nmicrosaccades.\nFigure 9. Microsaccade properties in Experiment 3. (a) Microsaccade rates show the typical `microsac-\ncade signature' (eg, Engbert and Kliegl 2003b and Experiments 1 and 2) after fixation (t = 0ms) and\nstimulus onset (t = 1000ms; red line), with a reduction in the rate followed by an increase above\nthe initial rate. (b) The proportion of trials with 0, 1, ..., 10 microsaccades after stimulus onset (t =\n1000ms), showing that on many trials no single microsaccade was detected. The rate of trials without a\nmicrosaccade was larger for higher ratings of motion. (c) The average rating as a function of the number\nof microsaccades after stimulus onset (t=1000ms), showing a downward trend (regression line in red, in\nthe background). (d) Microsaccade rates as a function of the different stimulus parameters (modulation\namplitude, A; modulation period, \u00b5; contrast, c; and fixation point presence), suggesting that only\nfixation presence influences the microsaccade rate. (e) The histogram of microsaccade amplitudes\nshowing a similar pattern as in Experiments 1 and 2. (f) The average amplitude of microsaccades (on\ntrials on which a microsaccade occurred) as a function of the motion illusion rating, showing no effect\nof the strength of the illusion.\nAn examination of the influence of the stimulus parameters on the microsaccade rates\n(Figure 9d) confirms the findings from the previous two experiments. Rates were no different\nfor the different stimulus parameters (modulation amplitude, modulation period or contrast),\nbut a significant influence of the presence of a fixation point was found (t14 = 2.31, p = 0.037).\nA similar histogram of observed microsaccade amplitudes as in Experiment 1 and 2 was\nfound in Experiment 3 (Figure 9e). A comparison of the microsaccade amplitudes (for trials\nin which at least one microsaccade was observed) did not reveal an effect of the rated motion\n5 General discussion\nIn three experiments, we investigated involuntary eye movements (`microsaccades') made\nby observers who were instructed to maintain fixation while watching parametric versions of\nBridget Riley's Fall (called `Riloids'). The stimulus presentation was varied in several respects.\nFirst, we investigated the influence of mixing the original Riloid with a regular pattern of\nsquares (Experiments 1 and 2), which has been demonstrated to manipulate the strength of\nthe motion illusion observed in the image (Zanker et al 2010). Second, the overall contrast of\nthe image was varied (Experiment 2), another factor that has been shown to strongly influence\nthe strength of perceived illusory motion (Zanker et al 2010). Third, the influence of a fixation\ntarget was determined, which was present or absent in different intervals (Experiment 1) or\nin half of the trials (Experiments 2 and 3) while the stimulus pattern was presented. Previous\npsychophysical experiments (Zanker et al 2010) have suggested that such a fixation target\nhas little influence on the strength of the illusion. Finally, we also included Riloids without\nbackground checkers and varied the modulation amplitude, the modulation period, and the\ncontrast of the pattern (Experiment 3).\nSeveral properties of microsaccades were examined, including their frequency and\namplitude (Experiments 1 and 2) and their relation to the perceived motion illusion\njudgements (Experiment 3). Earlier research (Zanker and Walker 2004) has suggested that\nwhilst image instability is crucial for the perception of the illusion (the illusion is strongly\nreduced when retinal motion is eliminated and simulations with a computational model\nsuggest that retinal shifts are essential to explain the patterns of motions perceived in the\nstimuli), the rate at which microsaccades occur is not directly related to stimulus that is\nshown. This observation was confirmed in the present study for a different set of stimuli\nwhich allowed for controlled variations of illusion strength (Experiments 1 and 2). Whether\nthere is an association between microsaccade frequency and the illusion strength (rather\nthan the stimulus) was examined in Experiment 3, in which participants were asked to rate\nthe perceived strength of motion after each trial. This experiment revealed two important\naspects. First, in many trials no microsaccades were detected at all, and even in the absence\nof such microsaccades, participants indicated that they perceived illusory motion. Second,\ntrials with fewer microsaccades were associated with higher ratings for the perceived motion\nillusion. The more microsaccades were observed in an individual trial, the lower the average\nrating of the motion illusion strength. These observations support the idea raised earlier that\nillusion strength is not directly related to the frequency of microsaccades (Zanker and Walker\nIn our experiments, we replicated the effects of stimulus onsets on microsaccade rates.\nIn agreement with earlier observations (eg, Engbert and Kliegl 2003b; Laubrock et al 2005),\nstimulus onsets--such as the onset of the fixation symbol or the Riloid--led to an initial\ndecrease in the rate, followed by a pronounced increase and slow return to baseline. This\npattern in microsaccade rates, known as the `microsaccade signature', was also found for\nstimulus onsets in the auditory modality (Rolfs et al 2005, 2008) and for partial offsets of\nstimuli presented at fixation (Hermens et al 2010).\nAnother factor that influenced the microsaccade rate was the presence of a fixation\ntarget, which may provide some clues about the role of microsaccades in gaze control. Fewer\nmicrosaccades were found when the fixation target was absent. This was the case when\nthe fixation target was present in the initial stimulus phase and was removed in the later\nstimulus phase (Experiment 1), and also, albeit to a lesser degree, when a direct comparison\nbetween trials with and without a fixation symbol was made (Experiments 2 and 3). This\nlatter comparison excludes an explanation suggesting prolonged fixation as the cause of\nthe reduction in microsaccades (Zanker and Walker 2004) rather than the presence of the\nfixation target. A possible explanation for the increased microsaccade rate with a fixation\ntarget could be that microsaccades serve to bring the eye back to fixation after periods of\nfixation target is present, such drifts are more obvious (one finds gaze is no longer directed\ntowards the fixation symbol), which could explain why more microsaccades--as means of\nredirecting gaze to the point of origin after drifting away--occur. Such an explanation agrees\nwith findings by Otero-Millan and colleagues (2008), who showed that microsaccades were\nless frequent when observers were viewing a blank screen, compared to when they were\nviewing an image, suggesting that microsaccades require visual stimuli to `anchor' to (Otero-\nMillan et al 2008, page 8). Alternatively, participants might have performed two different tasks\nwith or without a fixation target. When a fixation target was present, they might have tried to\nkeep their direction of gaze as close as possible to the target. Without the fixation target, this\nmight no longer be a tenable strategy, and instead, they might have tried to keep their eyes\nas still as possible. With these two different tasks, to maintain fixation or to try to keep the\neyes still, different microsaccade rates have been observed previously (Steinman et al 1973),\nwith lower microsaccade rates for keeping the eyes still than for maintaining fixation, which\ncould therefore provide an explanation for our observed differences in rates. The importance\nof a fixation target for the occurrence of microsaccades was also demonstrated by Poletti\nand Rucci (2010), who found, in line with the work by Cornsweet (1956), that microsaccade\nrates were unaffected by the (perceived) fading of the retinal image, suggesting that the\nactual presence or absence of a visual stimulus is not what determines the microsaccade rate.\nMoreover, they observed that removing the fixation target and instead asking participants\nto maintain fixation within a certain region (`relaxed fixation' requirement) reduced the\nnumber of microsaccades. Furthermore, they found that the direction of microsaccades in\nthe presence of a fixation target was negatively correlated with the direction of the preceding\noculomotor drift, while such a correlation was not found without a fixation target. These\nobservations suggest a possible role of microsaccades in correcting for fixation errors under\nhigh-accuracy fixation requirements (see, also, Engbert and Kliegl 2004).\nA second aspect of the microsaccades that we investigated was their amplitude. Whereas\nmicrosaccade rates have been studied extensively, fewer studies have looked into microsac-\ncade amplitudes. It has been suggested (eg, Steinmann et al 1973) that larger amplitude\nmicrosaccades are found under conditions with more oculomotor drift (suggesting a function\nto bring the eye back to the intended point of fixation). In addition, it has been found that\nwhen fewer microsaccades occur, for example, after the onset of a visual stimulus, their\namplitudes tend to be smaller (Rolfs et al 2008). Furthermore, saccadic latencies were found\nto be longer when preceded by larger amplitude microsaccades (Rolfs et al 2008). Moreover,\nthe size of microsaccades was found to depend on whether the microsaccade occurred as\na single event or was part of a sequence of microsaccades (Laubrock et al 2010). Another\nstudy found that fading of the stimulus did not influence the amplitude of microsaccades\n(Poletti and Rucci 2010). Our study adds to these findings by investigating the role of a\nfixation stimulus and the type of visual stimulation (in particular, the strength of illusory\nmotion induced by the stimulus). Whereas microsaccade rates were strongly influenced by\nthe presence of a fixation stimulus, microsaccade amplitudes were only weakly affected. This\nsuggests that a tight coupling between microsaccade amplitudes and rates (Rolfs et al 2008)\nmight not always occur. Moreover, it also suggests that larger amounts of oculomotor drift\ncould be compensated for by more rather than larger amplitude microsaccades. With respect\nto visual stimulation, an opposite pattern of results was found. Whilst microsaccade rates\nwere unaffected by patterns increasing the strength of the motion illusion, the microsaccade\namplitude appeared to be modulated by this manipulation. The pattern of results, however,\nwas complex. No modulation of the amplitude was found when the stimulus was presented\nat the end of a long interval of fixation (Experiment 1). When part of a shorter interval\n(Experiment 2), the influence appeared to be non-monotonically related to the strength of\nthe illusion, with stronger influences for patterns inducing weak or strong motion illusion\nstrengths. Experiment 3, however, suggests that the association between the illusion strength\nand microsaccade amplitude from Experiment 2 might actually be an association between\nthe strength of the checker pattern and microsaccade amplitude. In this third experiment,\nin which participants rated the perceived motion illusion on each trial, the microsaccade\namplitude appeared to be unrelated to ratings of perceived motion strength. Possibly, the\ncheckers in the background acted as `anchor points' for fixation stability, just like a fixation\npoint, making it more obvious the eye has drifted. In this context, it should be noted, however,\nthat computational simulations (Zanker 2004) suggest that all saccadic displacements larger\nthan /4 (about 0.1 deg in the present stimuli) would lead to substantial motion illusions.\nTherefore the amplitude modulation in the range of 0.3 to 0.5 deg may have little effect on\nillusion strength, as displacements in this range are larger than the minimum displacement\nrequired for the illusion (about 0.1 deg).\nA third aspect we investigated was the direction of the microsaccades. Previous research\nhas suggested that the direction of microsaccades is influenced by the direction of covert\nmicrosaccades have often been found to be biased towards the horizontal direction (eg, Eng-\nbert and Kliegl 2003a; Hermens and Walker 2010). In contrast, Zanker and colleagues (Zanker\net al 2003; Zanker and Walker2004) found a horizontal bias only for certain participants,\nwhereas other observers displayed a bias towards vertical microsaccade directions. The\npresent findings are in agreement with those from Engbert, Kliegl, and colleagues, showing a\nsignificant bias towards the horizontal direction, with leftward and rightward microsaccades\nbeing more frequent than upward and downward microsaccades. In addition, the direction\nof microsaccades was unrelated to the strength of the illusion elicited by particular stimulus\npatterns. The discrepancy of the results between Engbert, Kliegl, and colleagues; our present\nfindings; and those from Zanker and colleagues could lie in the algorithm used to detect\nmicrosaccades. The former set of results were based on an algorithm detecting microsaccades\non the basis of a velocity criterion applied to signals from both eyes, whereas the latter results\nwere obtained using a detection criterion based on accelerations applied to the signal of\none eye only. The difference in the algorithm is also reflected in a difference in the observed\nrates, with studies applying the algorithm by Engbert and Kliegl (2003b) reporting a rate\nof 1 microsaccade per second, and the study applying the acceleration criterion (Zanker\net al 2003) observing a rate of 2 microsaccades per second. It is reassuring, however, that\nonly the absolute rate and the distributions of directions seem to depend on the detection\nwho applied different algorithms to the same dataset and found no differences in results),\nwhereas other aspects, such as differences in microsaccade rates across conditions, appear\nto be unaffected. Note, however, that our observation of no microsaccades in the presence of\nan illusion could possible depend on the ability of the algorithm and eye tracking equipment\nto detect microsaccades. Possibly, microsaccades occurred on the relevant trials, but the\nalgorithm was not able to detect them (although the observed rates around 1Hz are well in\nline with earlier observations; Martinez-Conde et al 2009).\nThe present results cast doubts on an interpretation in which retinal shifts caused by\nmicrosaccades produce the illusion of shimmering motion perceived in parametric versions\nof Fall. First, we found that on a large number of trials, no microsaccades were observed\n(Experiment 3). On these trials, however, clear motion illusions were reported by participants.\nThis finding quantifies an observation that already pointed at a possibility of motion illusions\nwithout microsaccades. Earlier, Zanker et al (2010) found that the strength of the illusion\nwas relatively unaffected by the presentation duration of the stimulus. For stimuli presented\nas briefly as 250 ms, motion illusions were found--at a typical rate of 1 microsaccade per\nsecond (eg, Engbert and Kliegl 2003b), microsaccades might not have occurred on a few trials\nof such short presentation durations. Note, however, that the finding of motion illusions in\nthe absence of microsaccades in itself is not sufficient to conclude that microsaccades do not\nplay a role in the illusion. The reason is that it cannot be excluded that the presentation of\nthe stimuli by itself might have contributed to the illusion. Possibly, the onset of the stimulus\npattern induced a transient response of visual neurons, which could be involved in perceiving\nthe illusion, similar to the recurrence of the percept of a faded stimulus after microsaccades\n(Martinez-Conde et al 2006). How exactly transients caused by stimulus onsets and induce a\nmotion illusion, however, is less clear, and should be investigated further, for example, using\ncomputational modelling. Second, the occurrence of microsaccades was found to be either\nunrelated (Experiments 1 and 2) or inversely related (stronger motion percepts were found\nwhen fewer microsaccades occurred) to the motion illusion (Experiment 3). In particular this\nlatter finding of weaker motion illusions with more microsaccades is difficult to reconcile\nwith an explanation in which microsaccades generate the motion illusion.\nGiven the above observations, the present results suggest other causes than microsac-\ncades for the illusion. For example, it could be possible that other types of fixational eye\nmovements, such as oculomotor drift, are involved. Alternatively, there might be a role for\nperceptual transients, such as the onsets of stimulus patterns, in the illusion. Taking our\nfindings as a reason to discard fixational eye movements altogether as a factor in the illusion\nmight be a step too far, however, because earlier evidence strongly suggests the involvement\nof fixational eye movements. For example, it has been shown that if the retinal image is\nstabilized, the illusion is strongly reduced (Zanker and Walker 2004), which suggests that\nretinal instability plays a role in the illusion. Moreover the observed patterns of perceived\nmotion are well in line with predictions from a motion perception model (Zanker 2004;\nZanker et al 2010), assuming the involvement of retinal shifts, such as those occurring as\na result of fixational eye movements. Oculomotor drift, rather than microsaccades might\nbe a good candidate for offering an alternative or additional explanation for the illusion.\nThese movements occur continuously, and therefore do not suffer from the problem of\nmicrosaccades that they might not occur on all trials, or for all presentation durations.\nMoreover, they are also relatively large movements of the eyes (Martinez-Conde and Macknik\n2008), and could therefore provide the retinal shift assumed in computational models\nexplaining the illusion (Zanker 2004). Whereas there is evidence that retinal shifts are\nimportant for the illusion (Zanker and Walker 2004), it cannot be excluded that perceptual\ntransients, such as those caused by stimulus onsets and offsets, also play a role. The\ninvolvement of such perceptual transients in the motion illusion in Riley's Fall could be\nfurther investigated by presenting the stimuli for extended periods of time and to ask\nparticipants to indicate changes in aspects of the perceived motion, such as its speed or\ndirection (Troncoso et al 2008). Such a presentation paradigm would eliminate perceptual\ntransients and only leave signals arising from micro-movements of the eyes and eye-blinks.\nOur experiments revealed no relation between the perceived illusion and the amplitude\nof the microsaccades. Such a lack of a relation is well in line with predictions from a motion\ndetection model. Simulations with such a model (2DMD model, Zanker 2004) show that\nthe amplitude of the microsaccades is not predicted to hugely influence the strength of\nthe illusion, except if the microsaccade amplitude becomes very small with respect to the\ndistance between stripes in the stimulus. The direction of microsaccades does not appear\nto be critical for the illusion either. Microsaccades are typically found to be biased towards\nthe horizontal direction. If the direction of microsaccades would be of importance, it would\ntherefore be expected that rotating the Riloid would change the strength of the illusion. Such\nan effect of the orientation of the pattern has not been observed (Zanker and Walker 2004).\nOur conclusion that the rate of microsaccades is not directly related or could be even\ninversely related to the strength of the illusion may appear to be at odds with the findings of\nTroncoso et al (2008), who found a clear and distinct increase in the number of microsaccades\nbefore a perceived increase in the apparent speed of illusory motion. There are a number of\nissues to consider here. First, in our study we presented stimuli for a relatively brief duration,\nwhereas Troncoso et al (2008) presented their stimuli for extended periods. The onset and\noffset of the stimuli in our experiments could have caused transient neural responses, which\nmight have contributed to the illusion, in addition to the influence of retinal shifts generated\nby fixational eye movements implicated in earlier studies of the illusion (Zanker 2004;\nZanker and Walker 2004). Second, in their study Troncoso and colleagues observed the\nincrease in the microsaccade before the change in the perceived speed, rather than during\nthe entire period of increased speed, and therefore the rate change rather than the rate itself\ncould be responsible for the change in the perception (see Martinez-Conde et al 2006, for\na similar increase in the microsaccade rate before the perceived reappearance of a faded\nstimulus). Third, the study by Troncoso et al (2008) might have investigated a different type of\nillusory motion. In their study, Troncoso and colleagues investigated the speed of a perceived\nstreaming illusion elicited by patterns related to Leviant's 'Enigma' stimulus (Leviant 1996),\nwhich might be different in nature from the shimmering motion found for Riloids (eg,\nthe streaming-like motion in Enigma is found in the bands without patterns, whereas the\nshimmering motion in Riloids is linked to clear patterns in the stimulus). Whereas the speed\nof illusory motion might be related to the strength of the illusion, as measured by Zanker and\ncolleagues (Zanker et al 2010; Zanker and Walker 2004), these two measures do not necessarily\nneed to correlate. Instead, stronger illusions could mean a larger range of directions, or more\ndirection changes, rather than higher perceived speed. The possible difference between\nthe two illusions might also involve the underlying mechanism. For example, to perceive\na motion illusion in Riley's Fall, retinal shifts might be important. For the motion illusion\nin Leviant's `Engima', such shifts might be less important, and transients generated, for\nexample, by microsaccades might be more strongly involved. Fourth, our psychophysical\nstudy (Zanker et al 2010), in which we found no effect of the fixation stimulus on the strength\nof the illusion (suggesting that microsaccades are not involved in the illusion, as their rate\ngenerally increases with the presentation of a fixation stimulus), did not control for eye\nmovements. Whereas it was very unlikely that participants made large eye movements in the\ncondition with the fixation target (only highly trained observers took part in the study, some of\nwhom demonstrated in the present study that they could well maintain fixation when asked\nto do so), it can be expected that they did make eye movements in the condition without\nthe fixation target. It can therefore not be excluded that the large-amplitude saccades likely\nto be made in this condition of the psychophysics experiment contributed to the motion\npercept and someway counteracted the effects of the increased rate of microsaccades in the\ncondition with the fixation symbol.\n6 Conclusion\nIn summary, patterns, such as those used by Bridget Riley in her painting Fall provide a means\nof creating the perception of motion in a static image. Retinal shifts caused by eye movements\nmade during visual fixation of the pattern, such as microsaccades and oculomotor drift,\nmight be responsible for this motion percept. Whereas clear effects could be found of the\npresence of a fixation stimulus on the rate of the largest of these fixational eye movements,\nmicrosaccades, the relationship with the perceived strength of motion was more ambiguous.\nTwo experiments suggested no relationship between microsaccade rates and the illusion,\nwhereas a third experiment suggested an inverse relation. Interestingly, on many of the\ntrials no microsaccades were detected, while the stimulus pattern still induced an illusion.\nIn consideration of earlier results, these findings call for an alternative explanation of the\nmotion illusion in Riley's Fall, possibly involving other types of fixational eye movements,\nsuch as oculomotor drift, or transients from other sources, such as the onset and offset of\nthe stimuli. Future work should investigate these alternative explanations more closely--for\nexample, by inspecting oculomotor recordings for slow drift and by computer models to\nfurther examine the underlying mechanisms of the perception of illusory motion.\n"
