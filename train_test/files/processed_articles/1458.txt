Adequate calcium intake is essential for\nnormal growth and development of the skeleton and teeth and\nfor adequate bone mineralization. Optimizing bone mass\naccretion in youth and adolescence is critical to attaining peak\nbone mass in adulthood (1). In adulthood, low calcium intake\nhas been associated with increased risk for osteoporosis (2),\nbone fractures, and falls (3,4). Monitoring of calcium intake is\nnecessary to evaluate one of the goals for Healthy People 2010,\nwhich is to increase the proportion of people aged $2 y who\nmeet the dietary recommendations for calcium (5). Only 32% of\nU.S. adults met the adequate intake (AI)8 for calcium through\nsources of intake, which is necessary for the accurate and precise\nestimation of total usual calcium intake. Data from the\nNHANES provide information on intakes of calcium from all\nsources, the diet, water, dietary supplement use, and antacid\nconsumption, and permits estimation of total calcium intake.\nVitamin D works to aid calcium absorption and its role in\nbone health has been well characterized (7). An accumulating\nbody of evidence suggests that it may have other roles in human\nhealth and that vitamin D deficiency may contribute to certain\nchronic diseases (8). Vitamin D occurs naturally in only a few\nfoods and is also available in fortified foods (milk and milk\nproducts, margarines, some juices, and breakfast cereals).\nFortified foods constitute the major food sources of vitamin D\nin the United States (9).

Estimates of usual\nvitamin D and calcium intake are necessary for setting the\nDietary Reference Intake (DRI) intake levels (11). We analyzed\nrecent NHANES survey data to provide national estimates of\ntotal usual intake of calcium and vitamin D from all sources by\ngender and age groups and compared them to the appropriate\nDRI recommendations.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe NHANES is a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey that\nsamples noninstitutionalized, civilian U.S. residents using a complex,\nstratified, multistage probability cluster sampling design (12). The\nNHANES data are collected by the National Center for Health Statistics\nof the CDC. Written informed consent was obtained from all partici-\npants or proxies and the survey protocol was approved by the Research\nEthics Review Board at the National Center for Health Statistics.\nNHANES participants are asked to complete an in-person household\ninterview and a health examination in a mobile examination center that\nincludes an in-person 24-h dietary recall. A second 24-h dietary recall is\ncollected via telephone ~3\u00ad10 d after the mobile examination center\nexam. Both 24-h recalls were collected using USDA's Automated\nMultiple-Pass method (13,14). For both 24-h recalls, proxy respondents\nreport for children who are 5 y and younger and proxy-assisted\ninterviews are conducted with children 6\u00ad11 y of age (15). Dietary\nsupplement use information was collected during the household inter-\nview as part of the Dietary Supplement Questionnaire. Information\nincluded the participant's use of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other\ndietary supplements over the past 30 d. Detailed information about type,\nconsumption frequency, duration, and amount taken was also collected\nfor each reported dietary supplement. The average daily intake of\nnutrients from dietary supplements was calculated for individuals using\nthe number of days supplement use was reported, the reported amount\ntaken per day, and the serving size unit from the product label. Calcium\nfrom antacids was collected as part of the NHANES nonprescription\ndrug questionnaire that participants self-completed at the home inter-\nview. For this analysis, calcium was standardized to the elemental form\nin milligrams and vitamin D was standardized to the microgram metric\nfor comparison to the DRI recommendations.\nThe unweighted examination response rate for all participants,\ncalculated as the number of participants per component divided by the\ntotal number selected into the sample, was 79% for the interview\nand 80% for the interview component and 77% for the exam component\navailable for this NHANES wave at this time. Exclusions were made in\nthe following sequence: individuals under the age of 1 y (n = 477 in\nthose who did not complete or who had incomplete dietary recall data\nUsual total nutrient intake. The National Cancer Institute (NCI)\nmethod (16) was used to produce usual nutrient intake estimates\nutilizing the amount-only part of the NCI method. The first step in the\nNCI method for nutrients (assumed to be consumed every day by every\nmember of the population) replaces reported zero intakes with one-half\nof the minimum nonzero value reported in the data set (this was\nnecessary for ,1% of the data and only for the vitamin D analyses). The\nsecond step in the NCI method models Box-Cox\u00adtransformed 24-h recall\nobservations as a function of observed fixed-effect covariates, unob-\nserved individual-level random effects, and within-individual error. For\nthese analyses, the covariates were: 1) sequence of the 24-h recall; 2) day\nof the week the 24-h recall was collected, dichotomized as weekend\n(Friday\u00adSunday) or weekday (Monday\u00adThursday); and 3) dietary\nsupplement use. The amount of calcium provided from dietary supple-\nwas used in the model. The first 2 covariates (sequence and weekend) are\nexamples of \"nuisance effects\" that are explicitly adjusted for in the\nestimation of usual intake, as described below. The Box-Cox transfor-\nmation is chosen such that the differences (\"residuals\") between\ntransformed observations and their predictions based on the fixed-effect\nparameter estimates are separable into normally distributed random\neffects (representing between-individual differences not explained by\ncovariates) and normally distributed within-person errors. Within- and\nbetween-individual variance components of the residuals are estimated\nin the transformed scale.\nThe estimated distribution of usual dietary intake is constructed to\nreflect only between-person variability; the within-person variability is\neliminated because it does not reflect usual intake. For the model under\nconsideration, between-person variation in usual intake arises from\ndifferences in measured covariate values across individuals and from the\nrandom effects. Within-individual variation is also partly due to\nmeasured covariate values (interview sequence and weekend effects).\nThe first step in constructing the usual dietary intake distribution is to\nobtain a set of representative values whose empirical distribution\napproximates the assumed distribution of between-individual random\neffects. The NCI method as described in Tooze et al. (16) uses a Monte\nCarlo simulation method to obtain a large set (by default, 100/\nindividual) of such values assuming the random effects are exactly\nnormally distributed. An alternative approach that is more robust to the\nnormality assumption at the expense of some efficiency applies the\nprocedure of Dodd et al. (17) to the individual's mean residual to\nconstruct a smaller set (one per individual) of representative values\n\"shrunk\" to the group mean of the residuals. Using either method, the\nempirical distribution of these initial representative values reflects\nbetween-individual variation that is not explained by covariates. Next,\nthe covariate information in the data set is used to calculate 2 fixed effect\npredictions for each individual. The first of the 2 predictions is computed\nas if it were a first interview on a weekend day, the second is computed as\nit if were the first interview on a weekday. Other values of the covariates\nare held at their observed values for the individual. Corresponding\nrepresentative value from the first step are added to each individual's 2\npredictions and the resulting quantities are each back-transformed to the\noriginal scale using the procedure described by Dodd et al. (17). Next,\nthe 2 original-scale predictions are combined in a weighted average\ngiving weight 3/7 to the weekend prediction and 4/7 to the weekday\nprediction. The empirical distribution function of the resulting quanti-\nties, weighted according to the survey sampling weights, is an estimate of\nthe usual dietary intake distribution. Finally, each individual's reported\ndaily intake of the nutrient from supplement sources is added to his or\nher corresponding value(s) computed from the previous step, and the\nempirical distribution of these final sums, weighted according to the\nsurvey sampling weights, is an estimate of the usual total intake\ndistribution.\nThis construction of the distribution estimator accounts for both\nkinds of between-individual variation mentioned above and explicitly\nadjusts for the nuisance effects of interview sequence and weekend/\nweekday differences. Choosing to compute fixed effect predictions as if\nfor a first recall implicitly assumes that the first recall for an individual is\nthe most accurate. The weighted averaging of back-transformed week-\nend and weekday predictions assumes that the desired usual intake in the\noriginal scale is an average over many weeks, where weekends and\nweekdays occur with frequencies 3 and 4 of 7, respectively. Finally, using\ncategorized supplement intake as a covariate allows groups of individ-\nuals with different levels of supplemental intake to have a different mean\nusual intake from food sources.\nComplete details of the NCI method and the SAS macros necessary to\nfit this model and to perform the Monte Carlo-based estimation of usual\nintake distributions can be found at the NCI Web site (18). Custom SAS\nmacros were created to estimate usual dietary and total intake\ndistributions using the shrinkage technique and to perform Fay's\n(19,20) Modified Balanced Repeated Replication variance calculations.\nThe shrinkage technique produced estimates of usual dietary intake that\nwere practically identical to the ones produced by the Monte Carlo\ntechnique. In the results that follow, distributions of dietary intake are\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nbased on the Monte Carlo technique supported by the official NCI\nmacros. However, distributions of total nutrient intake are based on the\nshrinkage technique. Because the shrinkage technique operates on\nperson-specific residuals, it was thought to be more robust in case the\nrelationship between individual dietary intake and individual supple-\nment intake was not adequately modeled simply by inclusion of the\nsupplement-use covariates.\nStatistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS\n(version 9, SAS Institute) and SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 9,\nResearch Triangle Institute) software. Sample weights were used to\naccount for differential nonresponse and noncoverage and to adjust for\nplanned oversampling of some groups. For statistical procedures not\nspecifically designed to analyze survey data, the sample weights were\ntreated as counts of individuals with identical data. SE for all statistics of\ninterest were approximated by the Balanced Repeated Replication\nperturbation factor of 0.7. Each set of replicate weights was poststratified\nto control totals computed from the initial sample weights.\nThe prevalence of use and mean contribution of calcium and vitamin\nD from supplemental sources was calculated. Mean calcium and vitamin\nD intake were calculated from the estimated usual intake distributions\n(dietary and total). Each adjusted intake was compared with the AI and\ntolerable upper intake level (UL) (21) appropriate to the individual, and\nthe fraction of individuals above the cutoffs was used as the estimate of\nthe proportion of the population that is meeting the DRI recommenda-\ntions. We tabulated statistics for 16 DRI age and gender groups. Each\ngender/age group was analyzed independently of the others.\nRather than making all possible pairwise comparisons, we used Hsu's\n(22) procedure to determine (within gender) which age groups had the\nhighest and lowest population value(s) for: 1) calcium/vitamin D dietary\nsupplement use prevalence; 2) mean calcium/vitamin D intake from\ndietary supplements; 3) proportions meeting DRI recommendations for\ncalcium/vitamin D from dietary sources only; and 4) proportions meet-\ning DRI recommendations calcium/vitamin D from all sources. The\nprocedure also allows construction of simultaneous CI for differences\nbetween each age group's population value and that of the largest/\nsmallest population value. This procedure controls the experiment-wise\nType I error rate in a manner more appropriate for this purpose than the\nclassic Bonferroni approach. Hsu's (22) procedure, with an a of 0.025,\nwas performed twice per gender for each of the 4 types of outcomes; once\nto find the largest and once to find the smallest population values(s).\nThus, the experiment-wise error rate is held at an a # 0.05, where an\n\"experiment\" refers to pinpointing age groups with the highest and age\ngroups with the lowest population values for a given outcome/gender\ncombination.\nResults\nDietary supplement use. Over one-half (53.4%) of NHANES\nover the last 30 d and 43% of the U.S. population over the age of\n1 y used supplemental calcium. Among supplement users, the\noverall mean intake of calcium from supplemental sources was\n331 mg/d (Table 1); dietary supplements provided the AI level of\ncalcium for 8 6 1% of the population. Taking calcium\nsupplements was reported by 62 6 2% among those aged\n$71 y when genders were combined. For males, mean calcium\nintake from supplemental sources was significantly higher in the\n$71-y age group than all others. Similarly, females aged $71 y\nhad a significantly higher prevalence of use of and a higher mean\ncalcium intake from supplemental sources than every other age\ngroup with the exception of those 51\u00ad70 y. Among users of\ndietary supplements, ~17% of females $71 y met the AI simply\nthrough their use of dietary supplements.\nsupplement containing vitamin D (Table 2); fewer males (33 6\nfemales 19\u00ad30 y had the lowest prevalence of use of vitamin D\ndietary supplements, whereas individuals $71 y had the highest\nreported use regardless of gender. For bother genders, those $51\ny had the highest mean intakes of vitamin D provided by\nsupplemental sources.\nTABLE 1 Prevalence of use and daily contribution of\nsupplemental calcium in the United States,\nAge group, y n Users,2 % Calcium,3 mg/d\n1 Superscripts denote sets of within-gender age groupings with means or prevalence\nestimates that are statistically indistinguishable from the lowest (a) or highest (b)\npopulation mean, as determined by Hsu's procedure (22) with a = 0.025.\n2 Data are percent 6 SE.\n3 Data are mean 6 SE.\nTABLE 2 Prevalence of use and daily contribution for users\nof supplemental vitamin D in the United States,\nAge group, y n Users,2 % Vitamin D,3 mg/d\n1 Superscripts denote sets of within-gender age groupings with means or prevalence\nestimates that are statistically indistinguishable from the lowest (a) or highest (b)\npopulation mean, as determined by Hsu's procedure (22) with a = 0.025.\n2 Data are percent 6 SE.\n3 Data are mean 6 SE.\nCalcium and vitamin D intake in the United States 819\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nDietary and total nutrient intakes. Males and females aged\n1\u00ad3 y had the highest proportion meeting the AI for dietary and\ntotal intake of calcium across all age groups (Table 3). The\nprevalence of intake above the UL was higher for total calcium\nintake compared with calcium intake from diet only, but the\nprevalence of excessive intake (i.e. above the UL) was still very\n(data not shown). However, very high calcium total intakes were\nobserved in the 99th percentile for both males and females of all\nages (Supplemental Table 1).\nFor males, the highest prevalence of meeting the vitamin D AI\nfrom dietary sources alone was among 1- to 3-y and 4- to 8-y\nhighest prevalence of meeting the AI from the diet (Table 4). Less\nthan 7% of males and females over the age of 51 y met the AI for\nvitamin D through the diet. When dietary supplement use was\nincluded, the prevalence of those meeting the AI was higher for\nall age groups, but most dramatically for those aged 51 y and\nolder. For total vitamin D intake, males and females $71 y and\nfemales 14\u00ad18 y had the lowest prevalence of meeting the AI. As\na group, ,1% exceeded the UL through diet or when total\nvitamin D intake was examined (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nThis report is the first, to our knowledge, to present national\nestimates of usual calcium and vitamin D intake from all sources\nfor the U.S. population using the most recently available data\nfrom NHANES. More than one-half of the U.S. population uses\ndietary supplements; our data indicate some individuals meet the\nAI from dietary supplement use alone. Thus, nutrient intakes\nfrom dietary supplements must be included to accurately\ncharacterize total exposure to nutrients and to estimate the\ndistribution of total usual nutrient intake. Without the inclusion\nof supplemental nutrients, mean nutrient intakes are under-\nestimated, the prevalence of inadequate intakes is overestimated,\nand the prevalence of excessive intakes is underestimated (23).\nIn public health nutrition research, the distribution of usual\ntotal nutrient intake is a necessary cornerstone (24). The\nestimates and the distributions presented in this paper were\nadjusted to reflect usual nutrient intake using the NCI method.\nThe NCI model we employed for the dietary intakes removes the\neffect of within-person variability and adjusts for the effects of\nknown covariates: sequence of 24-h dietary recall, day of the\nweek that the data were collected, and the amount of the\nnutrient provided from supplemental sources. The amount of\nthe nutrients supplied from supplemental sources is an impor-\ntant covariate; previous reports suggest that dietary supplement\nusers tend to have high dietary intakes of nutrients (23,25).\nThus, the relationship between nutrient intakes from food and\nfrom dietary supplements are complex and should be addressed\n(26). The model we developed addressed this covariate statis-\ntically by allowing those who used dietary supplements to have a\ndifferent group mean nutrient intake from the diet compared\nwith those who did not use supplements; this allowed for a more\naccurate estimation of total usual nutrient intakes. Another\nstrength of this study is that it provides independently estimated\ntabulations of usual intake means, percentiles, and proportions\nmeeting recommendations for all of the DRI gender/age groups.\nTherefore, researchers and policy makers can make pairwise\ncomparisons between as many DRI age groups as they desire,\nalthough care should be taken to control the Type I error rate\nwhen making many such comparisons. We chose to use Hsu's\n(22) procedure to statistically assess selected a priori hypotheses\nbut recognize that additional comparisons might be of interest.\nSome limitations should also be addressed. First, all estimates of\ndietary intake assume that reported nutrient intake from food\nsources on the 24-h recalls are unbiased and that the self-\nreported dietary supplement intake reflects true long-term\nTABLE 3 Calcium intake from the diet and all sources compared with the AI recommendations by\nAge group, y n AI UL\nCalcium\nDiet alone,2 mg/d Above AI,3 % Total intake,4 mg/d Above AI,3 %\nFemales\n1 Superscripts denote sets of within-gender age groupings with prevalence estimates that are statistically indistinguishable from the lowest\n(a) or highest (b) population mean, as determined by Hsu's procedure (22) with a = 0.025.\n2 Data are mean 6 SE food and water only.\n3 Data are percent 6 SE.\n4 Data are mean 6 SE for total intake: food, water, antacids, and dietary supplements.\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nsupplement intake. Second, estimates of nutrients from dietary\nsupplements depend largely on label declarations rather than\nanalytical values. Recent analytical data on dietary supplements\nsuggest that actual levels exceed the labeled values for many\nvitamins and minerals (27,28). For calcium, the average devi-\nation from the label is 14% (29); information on vitamin D\ndeviation from label is not known at this time. Thus, the data\npresented in this manuscript should be interpreted with these\ncaveats.\nOur results indicate that some age and gender groups have\nlow calcium intake. Whereas very few infants and toddlers had\nlow calcium intake, only 15% of 9- to 13-y-old females and\ncalcium from diet alone. However, when total intake was\nexamined, dietary supplements increased the prevalence of\nmeeting the AI in the older age groups. Nevertheless, considering\n14- to 18-y-old females met the AI for calcium.\nof population subgroups above the AI of calcium intake from\nfood sources are similar to those presented in this updated report\nthe prevalence of meeting the AI for 4- to 8-y-old females. One\npotential explanation for this discrepancy could be the methods\nused to adjust the data; the Iowa State method (30) was used for\nwith calcium indicate that the statistical methods employed to\nadjust the dietary intakes of calcium using NHANES data do not\nproduce very different prevalence estimates or mean calcium\ndietary recall, which may influence the usual intake estimates as\nwell. Nevertheless, these findings may indicate a decline in\ncalcium intakes among females 4\u00ad8 y of age. The USDA Food\nAvailability Report indicates an increase in the availability of\ndairy products over this time period (32). Interestingly, an\nincrease in the prevalence of meeting the AI was observed for\nboth 31- to 50-y-old males and females compared with the\nearlier report.\nGahche et al. (33) found that use of vitamin D supplements\nhas increased over time for U.S. adults (ages 14 y and older) with\n26% reporting use in NHANES III, 35% reporting use in\n2006 data on vitamin D supplement use in children were almost\nidentical to an earlier report by Picciano et al. (34) from 1999\u00ad\n2002 indicating that the prevalence of use among U.S. children\ngenders were combined. Our later data are consistent: 32% use\nof vitamin D supplements has increased over time in adult\npopulations (33), the use in children and adolescents appears to\nbe stable. Whereas younger Americans tend to have the most\nfavorable total vitamin D intake, a large percentage of older\nadults in NHANES fail to meet the recommendations from\ndiet alone and only improve marginally with the use of dietary\nsupplements. This may be in part due to the higher AI level in\nRegardless, this is of concern given the role of vitamin D in bone\nhealth, falls, and fracture risk in these age groups (35).\nDietary supplements constitute an important source of nutri-\nents for large segments of the population. About 43% of the U.S.\npopulation and almost 70% of older females report supplemental\ncalcium use. Our data and that of others (36) indicate that dietary\nsupplement use is associated with a higher prevalence of meeting\nthe AI for calcium. Recent media attention on the role of vitamin\nD in various chronic disease states has dramatically increased sales\nof this dietary supplement (37).
