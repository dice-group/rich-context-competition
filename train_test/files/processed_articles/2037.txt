Conceptually, LMS-derived\nZ scores account for normal age-related changes in pulmonary function, including variability and\nskewness in reference data. Evidence is limited, however, on whether the LMS method is valid for\nevaluating respiratory impairment in middle-aged persons. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the associ-\nation of LMS-defined respiratory impairment (airflow limitation and restrictive pattern) with\nmortality and respiratory symptoms. METHODS: We analyzed spirometric data from white par-\nticipants ages 45\u00ad64 years in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III, n  1,569) and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (ARIC, n  8,163).\nRESULTS: LMS-defined airflow limitation was significantly associated with mortality (adjusted\n1.98\u00ad2.62).

CONCLUSIONS: In white middle-age persons, LMS-defined airflow limitation\nand restrictive-pattern were significantly associated with mortality and respiratory symptoms.\nConsequently, an approach that reports spirometric values based on LMS-derived Z scores might\nprovide an age-appropriate and clinically valid strategy for evaluating respiratory impairment.

[Respir Care\nIntroduction\nIn aging populations, because of widespread and cumu-\nlative exposure to tobacco smoke, respiratory infections,\noccupational dust, and air pollution, the evaluation of re-\nspiratory impairment has clinical and epidemiological im-\nplications.1-4 Most often, respiratory impairment is estab-\nlished spirometrically, as airflow limitation (eg, COPD or\nasthma) and restrictive-pattern (eg, thoracic kyphosis, heart\nfailure, or interstitial lung disease).5,6 Importantly, to min-\nimize misidentification of respiratory impairment and to\nbetter inform clinical decision making, it is imperative that\nDrs Vaz Fragoso, Yaggi, and Concato are affiliated with the Clinical\nEpidemiology Research Center, Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare\nSystem, West Haven, Connecticut.

We also calculated the frequency of misiden-\ntification of respiratory impairment with the current spi-\nrometric criteria, relative to LMS-based assessment of re-\nspiratory impairment.\nMethods\nThis study was approved by the institutional review\nboards of Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System\nand Yale University School of Medicine. The study was\nconducted at the Yale Claude D Pepper Older Americans\nIndependence Center and the Clinical Epidemiology Re-\nsearch Center, Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare\nSystem, West Haven, Connecticut.\nStudy Population\nWe used de-identified, publically available data from\nthe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-\nvey (NHANES III) and Atherosclerosis Risk in Commu-\nnities study (ARIC).16,17 We included only white, middle-\nage (45\u00ad64 years) participants, because LMS reference\nvalues are currently unavailable for non-whites and be-\ncause of the age range of ARIC participants.8,9,17 We an-\nalyzed only data from participants who had completed at\nleast 2 spirometry maneuvers acceptable by the American\nThoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/\nERS) criteria, at initial baseline examination. Per current\nconvention, we did not exclude participants based on spi-\nrometric reproducibility criteria.18 To focus on \"irrevers-\nible\"pathology,participantswithself-reportedasthmawere\nexcluded.\nNHANES III was designed to provide national esti-\nmates of the health and nutritional status of the United\nStates non-institutionalized population.16 The NHANES III\n2000, used a complex design to generate a nationally rep-\nresentative sample, with an age range of 8\u00ad80 years\nsample from NHANES III included 1,569 participants.\nARIC was a population-based, longitudinal study of mid-\nsample from 4 United States communities and followed\nsample from ARIC included 8,163 participants.\nSpirometry\nIn both study samples, participants underwent spirom-\netry during their baseline examination, according to the\ncontemporary ATS protocol,19 with equipment that met\nATS accuracy requirements (a dry rolling-seal spirometer\nin NHANES III, and a water-seal spirometer in ARIC).16,17\nWith each subject, FEV1\n/FVC was calculated from the\nlargest set of FEV1\nand FVC values from maneuvers that\nmet the ATS acceptability criteria.18,19\nIn both study samples, based on measured values for\neach participant and as recommended, we calculated LMS-\nderived Z scores for FEV1\n/FVC and FVC as:\nmeasured/median predictedlambda  1]/(lambda  sigma)\nA Z score of 1.64 corresponded to the LMS LLN5\nWe used the LMS prediction equations to calculate values\nfor the median, lambda, and skewness. We obtained cubic\nsplines for age from tables at http://www.lungfunction-\n.org/growinglungs/software.html. Those tables are based\non 4 pooled reference samples with age range 4\u00ad80 years.8\nUsing the LMS LLN5\nas a diagnostic threshold, and per\ncurrent convention, we classified participants as having\nnormal pulmonary function if both FEV1\n/FVC and FVC\nwere  LMS LLN5\n, airflow limitation if FEV1\n/FVC was\n, or restrictive-pattern if FEV1\n/FVC was\nand FVC was  LMS LLN5\nWe also classified each subject's respiratory status based\non current Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease\n(GOLD) and ATS/ERS spirometric criteria.

With each\nCox regression model, goodness-of-fit was assessed with\nmodel-fitting procedures and analysis of residuals. We\ntested the proportional hazards assumption with interac-\ntion terms for the time-to-event outcome and each variable\nin the multivariable model; the terms were retained if\nP  .05 after adjusting for the multiplicity of comparisons.\nWe tested higher-order effects for the continuous covari-\nates and included them in the final model if they met the\nforward selection criterion of P  .20.23 Similarly, we\nevaluated the association between LMS-defined respira-\ntory impairment and the presence of respiratory symptoms\nby calculating odds ratios with logistic regression models.\nWe also calculated the prevalence of respiratory impair-\nment according to the GOLD, ATS/ERS, and LMS crite-\nria, as well as determined the frequency of misidentified\nrespiratory impairment (false positive and false negative)\nwith the GOLD and ATS/ERS criteria, relative to the LMS-\nbased assessment.\nWe used statistics software (SUDAAN 10, RTI Interna-\ntional, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, and SAS 9.2,\nSAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) for all the analyses. A\nResults\nTable 1 describes the participants. Overall, the\nNHANES II and ARIC samples were similar in age, fe-\nmale representation, body mass index, smoking status, fre-\nquency of chronic conditions, self-reported COPD, and\nrespiratory symptoms.

Otherwise, GOLD and ATS/ERS infrequently\nmisidentified respiratory impairment as normal (false neg-\natives), with a frequency range of 0.4\u00ad2.6% for airflow\nlimitation and a frequency range of 1.6\u00ad10.8% for restric-\ntive-pattern.\nDiscussion\nLMS-defined airflow limitation and restrictive-pattern\nwere associated with a significantly higher risk of death\nand likelihood of having respiratory symptoms. Moreover,\nrelative to LMS, we also found that the current GOLD and\nATS/ERS spirometric criteria may misidentify normal pul-\nmonary function as airflow limitation or restrictive-pat-\ntern. These results support the use of LMS-derived Z scores\nfor evaluating spirometry data in middle-aged persons.\nEvaluating respiratory impairment based on the\nLMS method has a strong mathematical and clinical ra-\nlated changes in pulmonary function, including variability\nand skewness in reference data.8,9 We found that LMS-\nderived Z score thresholds for spirometric variables were\nalso associated with important health outcomes. All-cause\nmortality is an objective and definitive outcome that is\nresistant to miscoding and was the primary end point in\nlandmark studies of oxygen therapy.26 In addition, respi-\nratory symptoms are the most distressing feature of respi-\nratory disease and can lead to disability and increased\nhealthcare utilization.26,27 Although lacking specificity, the\nuse of respiratory symptoms as a basis for establishing\nvalidation recognizes their importance in clinical decisions,\nas evident in practice guidelines from GOLD, ATS/ERS,\nOur results also quantify how often the currently ac-\ncepted spirometric criteria may misidentify respiratory im-\npairment in middle-aged persons (see Table 5).

Although they yielded\nassessments of airflow limitation that were similar to LMS,\nthe ATS/ERS criteria nonetheless frequently misidentified\nnormal pulmonary function as restrictive-pattern.\nThe misidentification of respiratory impairment by current\nspirometric criteria may reflect age-related methodological\nlimitations.6-14 Specifically, the GOLD thresholds for FEV1\n/\nFVC (0.70) and FVC (80% of predicted) have methodolog-\nical weaknesses in adults, for at least 2 reasons. First, because\nnormal aging is associated with increased chest-wall rigidity\nand loss of elastic recoil of the lung, normal aging often leads\nto an FEV1\nage.6-14 Second, spirometric performance shows increasing\nvariability starting at about 30 years of age, which moves the\n80%-of-predicted cut-point for FVC away from the LLN.6-14\nthreshold for FEV1\n/FVC and FVC is\nalso potentially flawed, principally because it does not ade-\nquately account for the age-related increased variability and\nskewness in spirometric reference data.8,9,13 This means that\nthe ATS/ERS LLN is based only on the distribution of ref-\nerence values, whereas the LMS LLN is based on a Z score\nthat additionally accounts for variability in spirometric per-\nformance and skewness of reference data.8,9 Importantly, as\nshown in prior work,8,9,13 these age-related methodological\nlimitations become progressively worse with advancing age\nand, hence, should be the focus of future work on the spiro-\nmetric definition of respiratory impairment in people\nWhether the potential misidentification of respiratory\nimpairment with the GOLD and ATS/ERS criteria, relative\nTable 3.

In\nparticular, airflow limitation has no definitive \"standard\"\nagainst which comparisons can be made, and restrictive-pat-\ntern requires confirmation of reduced total lung capacity via\nbodyplethysmographyorheliumdilution.6,30,31 Consequently,\nfuture work should further evaluate the health outcomes of\nparticipants who had misidentified respiratory impairment\nwith the GOLD and ATS/ERS criteria. This may require an\nanalytical plan that avoids a spirometry-defined reference\ngroup for subsequent comparisons, pooling of several large\ncohorts to achieve an adequate power for analysis, and a\nlarger array of health outcomes, including respiratory medi-\ncation use and hospitalization. In addition, future work should\nevaluate whether LMS-defined restrictive-pattern more accu-\nrately predicts a reduced total lung capacity, relative to GOLD\nand ATS/ERS.\nLimitations\nFirst, the magnitude of the associations between respira-\ntory impairment and mortality were not identical across the\nstudy samples, although the results were generally consistent\nand the differences could be due to sampling issues (eg,\nARIC had a lower frequency of fair-to-poor health status and\na lower mortality rate). Of note, greater consistency was found\nin the magnitude of associations between respiratory impair-\nment and respiratory symptoms across the study samples.\nSecond, spirometry in NHANES III and ARIC was not\nspecifically obtained after bronchodilator. Post-broncho-\ndilator values may have had a minimal effect on our re-\nsults, however, because study participants had high rates\nof smoking (conferring less reversible airway pathology)\nand because those who had self-reported asthma were ex-\ncluded from the analytical sample.\nThird, we studied only white middle-aged persons, and\nracial and age-group related differences can exist in pul-\nmonary function.8,9,32 Although this does not impair the\nvalidity of our study, it does affect the generalizability.\nFourth, our study samples were assembled in the late\nwhich raises the issue of the \"timeliness\" of the data,\ndespite the likelihood of pulmonary physiology remaining\nstable over time.
