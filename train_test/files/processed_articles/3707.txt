The\nvalue of RIPASA for discriminating differ-\nent stages of AA, however, has not been\ninvestigated. Computed tomography (CT),\nparticularly multislice (MS)CT, is widely\nperformed and important in the diag-\nnosis and differential diagnosis of AA\nbecause of its higher accuracy than\nIn the present retrospective cohort study,\nmedical records from patients with abdom-\ninal pain were retrieved and MSCT scan\nresults, and RIPASA and Alvarado scores\nwere analysed to compare their value in\ndiagnosing AA.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population and clinical data\nThis retrospective cohort study included\npatients treated for abdominal pain between\nHospital, Fudan University, Shanghai,\nChina.\nThe inclusion criteria comprised patients\nwith complete medical records (including\nMSCT examination) and all parameters\nrequired to calculate RIPASA and\nAlvarado scores. The exclusion criteria\ncomprised children (<18 years old), preg-\nnant female patients and patients who were\nallergic to iodinated contrast material. Cases\nof AA with appendectomy performed >24 h\nfollowing MSCT examination were also\nexcluded, to reduce the bias of AA stages.\nFor the diagnosis of AA, MSCT images, and\nRIPASA and Alvarado scores, were evalu-\nated retrospectively from complete medical\nnotes.\nThe study was approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board affiliated to\nJinshan Hospital, Fudan University,\nSince this was a retrospective cohort study,\ninformed consent was not required.\nMSCT scan and image interpretation\nAbdominal scans were performed using a\n64-slice Somatom Sensation 64 MSCT scan-\nner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Lower\nabdomen scans extended from the superior\nborder of the third lumbar to the pubic\nsymphysis, and whole abdomen scans\nextended from the diaphragmatic dome to\nthe pubic symphysis. Unenhanced scans and\ncontrast-enhanced scans were performed,\nand CT scanning parameters were as fol-\nlows: tube voltage, 120 kV; tube current,\ntion slice thickness, 1.0 mm; reconstruction\ninterval, 0.5 mm; pitch, 1. Patients suspected\nof colonic tumour, or ureteral or pelvic\nlesions, received 1500 ml of water (as nega-\ntive contrast material), orally at 0.5, 1 and\n1.5 h prior to scanning, to improve the\nquality of image acquisition. Patients sus-\npected of requiring urgent surgery did not\nreceive oral contrast material, to avoid\ndelaying treatment. Patients who underwent\nenhanced CT were administered 1\u00ad1.5 ml/kg\nSchering Pharma, Guangzhou, China),\nintravenously (i.v.) at a rate of 3 ml/s.\nScanning commenced 60 s following the\ninitiation of i.v. injection.\nThe appendix was reconstructed using\nmultiplanar reformation and curved planar\nreformation techniques. CT findings were\nevaluated as follows: maximum appendiceal\ndiameter; maximum appendiceal wall thick-\nness; maximum depth of the intraluminal\nappendiceal fluid; defect in enhancing\nappendiceal wall; periappendiceal inflam-\nmation; phlegmon or abscess; extraluminal\nair; intraluminal and/or extraluminal\nappendicolith.\nSimple AA was diagnosed when max-\nimum depth of the intraluminal appendiceal\nwas diagnosed when appendiceal diameter\nwas >6 mm with associated periappendiceal\ndiagnosed when appendiceal diameter was\n>6 mm with at least one of five specific CT\nsigns: defect in enhancing appendiceal wall,\nphlegmon or abscess, extraluminal air,\nwere evaluated separately by two radiolo-\ngists (J.W.Q., W.L.) with > 8 years' experi-\nence, who were blinded to the clinical score\nresults during the image evaluation period,\nand who reached consensus following dis-\ncussion when disagreement occurred. Mean\nvalues were calculated for the two sets of\nmeasurement data obtained by the two\nradiologists.\nAlvarado and RIPASA score\nFor all cases, Alvarado and RIPASA scores\nwere derived and calculated from complete\nmedical notes separately by two surgeons\n(R.X.S., Y.Z.), each with >10 years' experi-\nence, based on criteria listed in Tables 1\nto the CT diagnostic results during the score\nevaluation period, and in the case of dis-\nagreement, consensus was reached following\ndiscussion.\nTable 2.

Differences in\nthe accuracy of RIPASA compared with\nAlvarado scores in diagnosing AA were\nassessed using 2-test. Differences in the\naccuracy of RIPASA score for diagnosing\nsimple AA versus other types of AA, simple\nAA versus phlegmonous AA, and perfo-\nrated AA versus nonperforated AA were\nanalysed using Student's t-test.

The\nRIPASA score contains parameters such as\nage and sex, which could increase the accur-\nacy compared with Alvarado score, and the\nRIPASA score also contains more param-\neters that could aid with the differential\ndiagnosis of AA. All 14 parameters of the\nRIPASA score are easily obtained from\ngood clinical histories, examinations and\ninvestigations, and RIPASA score is easy\nto implement without additional costs.\nFigure 2. Representative multislice computed\ntomography (MSCT) scan image showing phlegmo-\nnous acute appendicitis (AA). In this case, Alvarado\nscore was 3 and Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha\nAppendicitis (RIPASA) score was 10. The appendix\nwas reconstructed using the multiplanar reforma-\ntion technique; arrow indicates the appendix\n(diameter, 11.6 mm) with periappendiceal inflam-\nmation; appendicolith and fluid seen in appendiceal\nlumen; CT findings met the diagnostic criterion of\nphlegmonous AA.\nFigure 3. Representative multislice computed\ntomography (MSCT) scan image showing simple\nacute appendicitis (AA). In this case, Alvarado score\nwas 2 and Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha\nAppendicitis (RIPASA) score was 6.5. The appendix\nwas reconstructed using the multiplanar reforma-\ntion technique; arrow indicates the appendix\n(diameter, 8.5 mm) without findings of periappendi-\nceal inflammation; fluid seen in appendiceal lumen\n(diameter, 3.1 mm); computed tomography findings\nmet the diagnostic criterion of simple AA.\nCompared with the Alvarado score, there-\nfore, the RIPASA score may be more\nappropriate for the diagnosis of AA.\nComputed tomography is thought to be\nimportant in the diagnosis and differential\ndate directly compare the RIPASA score\nwith CT in the diagnosis of AA. In the\ncurrent study, the sensitivity, specificity and\naccuracy of MSCT were significantly higher\nthan those of the RIPASA score for diagnos-\ning AA. There were statistically significant\ndifferences in diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity\nand specificity between MSCT and RIPASA\nscore, indicating that MSCT is an important\nsupplement to RIPASA score. This may be\nbecause the RIPASA score lacks highly\nspecific parameters, and in many other dis-\neases (including inflammation of the caecum\nand/or ascending colon, gastrointestinal per-\nforation, and right ureter calculus), a few\nabnormal parameters that are included in the\nRIPASA score often develop.\nThe diagnostic value of the RIPASA\nscore has been documented as being higher\nthan the Alvarado score for AA,14,15 how-\never no study has reported the diagnostic\nvalue of the RIPASA score for different\ntypes of AA. In the current study, the\nRIPASA score for the simple AA group\nwas significantly lower than for other types\nof AA grouped together, indicating that the\ndiagnostic value of this score for simple AA\nwas lower than for other types of AA\ngrouped together, based on the guidelines\nfor management according to RIPASA total\nscore. This may be explained by the fact that\nsimple AA had more atypical presentations\nthan other types of AA grouped together in\nthe current study and, therefore, RIPASA\nscore could not effectively address the prob-\nlem of differentially diagnosing simple AA.\nthe sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of\nMSCT for diagnosing simple AA were\nindicating that MSCT is an important pro-\ncedure for the diagnosis of simple AA.\nClinical management options for perfo-\nrated AA are reported to be different from\nthose for nonperforated AA.22\u00ad24 The rou-\ntine treatment of choice for perforated AA is\nadministration of antibiotics and/or drain-\nage, with or without appendectomy 6\u00ad12\nweeks following antibiotic treatment. In\npatients with nonperforated AA, prompt\nappendectomy is recommended to reduce\nthe risk of complications. Thus, differentiat-\ning perforated from nonperforated AA can\nbe critically important in order to select the\ncorrect therapeutic approach. To date, no\nstudy has reported the value of the RIPASA\nscore for differentiating perforated from\nnonperforated AA, however. In the current\nFigure 4. Representative multislice computed\ntomography (MSCT) scan image showing perforated\nacute appendicitis (AA). In this case, the Alvarado\nscore was 7 and Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha\nAppendicitis (RIPASA) score was 10.5. The\nappendix was reconstructed using the multiplanar\nreformation technique; the long arrow indicates\nmarkedly enhanced and swelling appendix (diameter,\n12.8 mm); the short arrow indicates defect in\nenhancing appendiceal wall located in the distal\nappendix; periappendiceal abscess with rim\nenhancement was observed; computed tomog-\nraphy findings met the diagnostic criterion of\nperforated AA.\nstudy, there was no statistically significant\ndifference in the RIPASA score between the\nnonperforated and perforated AA groups.\nHowever, use of MSCT for differentiating\nperforated from nonperforated AA revealed\na sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of\nwhich were similar values to those reported\npreviously.22,23 These results indicate that\nMSCT is superior compared with the\nRIPASA score in the differential diagnosis\nof perforated versus nonperforated AA.\nThe current study is limited by the fact\nthat it is a retrospective cohort study, how-\never, sample cases with complete medical\nnotes are presented, which improves the\naccuracy of the results, and provides evi-\ndence that may guide the choice of clinical\npathway in the diagnosis of abdominal pain.\nCases of AA with appendectomy performed\n>24 h following MSCT examination were\nexcluded, which may have biased the MSCT\nresults, however, this was done to avoid\ninaccurate reporting of the stages of AA,\nsince some nonperforated AA may rapidly\nIn conclusion, the current study suggests\nthat MSCT is the optimum diagnostic tool\nfor AA compared with RIPASA and\nAlvarado scores, particularly in cases of\nsimple and perforated AA. The study also\nshowed that the RIPASA score may be a\nsuperior diagnostic scoring system com-\npared with the Alvarado score for AA,\nwhich is important in hospitals where\nMSCT scans are not readily available. A\nprospective study of MSCT versus the\nRIPASA score should be conducted, to\nfurther confirm the superiority of MSCT\nover RIPASA in terms of sensitivity, speci-\nficity and accuracy in the diagnosis and\ndifferential diagnosis of AA.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by the Science and\nTechnology Commission of the Jinshan District\n"
