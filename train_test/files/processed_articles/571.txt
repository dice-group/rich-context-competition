Women with previous\nbilateral oophorectomy were compared with women who\nretained their ovaries. The primary outcome of interest was\nself-report of sexual ideation, chosen because having\nthoughts about sexual experiences is not prohibited by\neither a partner or a woman's own physical limitations.\nRESULTS: Three hundred fifty-six (25.8%) women reported\nprevious bilateral oophorectomy. Our analysis achieved\n90% power to detect a difference of 10% in sexual ideation.\nNo significant difference in the report of sexual ideation was\nfound between women with previous bilateral oophorec-\ntomy and women who retained their ovaries (54.5% and\nfor current hormone therapy, age, education, and race\nCONCLUSION: Bilateral oophorectomy may not play a\npivotal role in sexual ideation and function among older\nwomen.\nHysterectomy is the most commonly performed\ngynecologic surgical procedure, with more than\nUnited States.1,2 The majority of hysterectomies are\nperformed for benign indications. This leaves the\nchoice to undergo concomitant prophylactic bilateral\noophorectomy at the time of hysterectomy between a\nwoman and her surgeon. Currently, 25% to 55% of\nbenign hysterectomies are performed with concomitant\nelective oophorectomy.3\u00ad5 Elective oophorectomy is of-\nfered to women to reduce the risk of future ovarian\ncancer and adnexal surgery. However, ovarian conser-\nvation has been demonstrated to increase overall life-\nexpectancy and decrease coronary heart disease.6,7\nPostmenopausal ovaries have been demonstrated\nto produce both testosterone and androstenedione\nthat are peripherally converted to estrogens in adi-\npose cells.8 Postmenopausal women maintain serum\ntestosterone levels even two to three decades after\nmenopause.9,10 In postmenopausal women, removal\nof the postmenopausal ovaries generally results in a\nrum androgens are believed to be important in the\nmaintenance of libido and sexual function in post-\nmenopausal women.13 However, the effect of elective\noophorectomy on sexual function, including ideation,\npartnerships, activity, frequency, attitudes, and prob-\nlems in older women, has not been well-studied.

Published\nby Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.\nNational Social Life, Health, and Aging Project sur-\nvey was conducted to investigate sexuality in a na-\ntionally representative probability sample of commu-\nnity-dwelling older adults in the United States aged 57\nto 85 years old. Adults were targeted for possible\nparticipation in the National Social Life, Health, and\nAging Project study from a previous population-based\nstudy.17 A unique aspect of the National Social Life,\nHealth, and Aging Project is adequate representation via\noversampling of previously understudied minority pop-\nulations (black and Hispanic women) within the data-\nset.17 The overall survey response rate was 75.5%, with\n3,322 adults participating in the National Social Life,\nHealth, and Aging Project between July 2005 and\nMarch 2006. Information in the National Social Life,\nHealth, and Aging Project was obtained from in-home\ninterviews of trained professional interviewers in both\nEnglish and Spanish using computer-assisted personal\ninterview methods.18 Data were collected by the Na-\ntional Opinion Research Center through the University\nof Chicago and were maintained by the Institute for\nSocial Research at the University of Michigan to ensure\nthe quality of the dataset.18,19 The current study is a\nsecondary database analysis focused solely on women\nwithout cancer with known oophorectomy status. Male\nous cancer diagnosis (n198, 6%) were excluded from\nour analyses. This study was exempt from review by the\nYale University Institutional Review Board because it\ninvolves research of an existing dataset from a public\nsource.\nThe purpose of this study was to compare sexual\nfunction of older women who reported previous bilat-\neral oophorectomy with that of older women who had\nretained their ovaries. Women reporting no previous\noophorectomy or unilateral procedure were considered\nas women who retained their ovaries. The primary\noutcome of interest was self-report of sexual ideation at\nleast once monthly. We chose sexual ideation as our\nprimary outcome because having thoughts about sexual\nexperiences should not be affected by either the wom-\nan's own physical limitations or the partner's issues (lack\nof partner or partner's physical limitations). Because\nsexual function is known to change with age, women\nwere stratified into the age categories of 57\u00ad64 years,\nnally, we examined the difference between women\nwho underwent oophorectomy before self-reported\nmenopause and women who underwent oophorec-\ntomy after menopause.\nSecondary outcomes included current sexual part-\nnerships, sexual frequency within the past 12 months,\ntypes of sexual activities, sexual attitudes, and sexual\nproblems. A current partner was defined as the woman\nreporting being currently married, cohabitating, or hav-\ning an intimate partner. Women reporting no current\nsexual partner were not asked questions about sexual\nfrequency or types of sexual activity (except for mastur-\nbation). Sexual frequency included the participation in\nany sexual activity within the past 12 months. Sex was\ndefined as \"any mutually voluntary activity with another\nperson that involves sexual contact, whether or not\nintercourse or orgasm occurs.\" Types of sexual activity\nreported including foreplay, vaginal coitus, receiving or\nperforming oral sex, and masturbation. All women were\nasked questions about their own sexual attitudes, values,\nand beliefs. For women reporting a current sexual\npartner, women were asked about sexual problems,\nincluding interest, lubrication, anorgasmia, dyspareunia,\nand avoidance of sexual activity because of problems.\nStatistical analyses, including descriptive and in-\nferential statistics with percentage estimates and 95%\nCI, were performed as appropriate. The National\nSocial Life, Health, and Aging Project dataset allowed\ndata to be weighted to provide an estimate of popu-\nlation characteristics representative of community-\ndwelling older Americans aged 57 to 85 years. Not all\nwomen answered all questions. Survey weights were\nused to account for the differential probability of\ninclusion in the sample and differential probability of\nnonresponse in all the analyses. Percentage estimates\nand 95% CI were obtained to report weighted fre-\nquencies. Model fitting and variance estimates used in\nthe construction of CI account for the stratified and\nclustered nature of the design to produce unbiased\nestimates of standard errors. Logistic regression anal-\nysis was used to assess the association between sexual\nideation (primary outcome) and oophorectomy status,\ncurrent hormone therapy, demographic characteris-\ntics, and clinical characteristics. Potential confounders\nwere considered for inclusion in the final model based\non their significance in univariable analysis (P.1).\nSignificant confounders were included in the final\nadjusted model if they continued to affect the final\nmodel (P.05).   status and current\nsystemic hormone therapy were included in the final\nmodel because these were our main independent\nvariables of interest. Statistical analyses were per-\nformed using SAS 9.2. Assuming a prevalence of\nsexual ideation of 52.8% (based on Lindau et al20), our\nanalysis achieved 90% power to detect a difference of\n10% in sexual ideation with a significance level () of\n834 Erekson et al Sexual Function After   OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY\nRESULTS\nIn total, 1,352 women were included in this analysis:\nretained their ovaries.

There were no significant differences in the\nreport of sexual problems between women undergo-\ning premenopausal compared with postmenopausal\noophorectomy, including lack of interest (P.97), vagi-\nnal lubrication (P.45), inability to climax (P.84), pain\nwith intercourse (P.23), lack of pleasure (P.21), and\navoidance of sex because of problems (P.26).\nDISCUSSION\nWe found sexual ideation and function were similar\namong community-dwelling older women with previ-\nous bilateral oophorectomy compared with women\nwho had retained their ovaries. Lindau et al16 previ-\nously reported on the sexual activity, frequency,\nattitudes, and problems of both women and men from\nthis project. Their report shows that sexual function\ndecreases with increasing age. However, hormonal\nstatus was not considered in their work.\nOne reported drawback of prophylactic oopho-\nrectomy women is decreased sexual function and\nhypoactive sexual desire disorder.21\u00ad24 In one small\nprospective study conducted in Turkey, sexual func-\ntion scores were found to significantly decrease in\npostmenopausal women 6 months after hysterectomy\nwith bilateral oophorectomy when compared with\npreoperative scores.22 The short length of this study\nand a lack of a control group of women with retained\novaries limit our knowledge of how oophorectomy\naffects sexual function in postmenopausal women in\nthe long-term. Finch et al21 reported that premeno-\nTable 4.

Estimates are weighted to\naccount for differential probabilities of selection and differential nonresponse. Model fitting and variance estimates used in the\nconstruction of confidence intervals account for the stratified and clustered nature of the design to produce unbiased estimates of\nstandard errors. The analyses for sexual activity (not including masturbation), frequency, and problems are limited to the 720\n(53.9%) of women who reported having a current sexual partner.\n840 Erekson et al Sexual Function After   OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY\npausal women with BRCA mutations undergoing pro-\nphylactic oophorectomy report a decrease in sexual\nfunctioning compared with postmenopausal women\nwith BRCA mutations undergoing the same proce-\ndure; however, this study was limited to follow-up of\n1 year after surgery. Finally, Leiblum et al23 reported\nhypoactive sexual desire disorder was more common\namong women younger than age 50 years who were\nsurgically menopausal compared with their intact\ncounterparts; however, no difference was seen in\nsexual desire in women older than age 50 years who\nhad undergone surgical menopause. Although evi-\ndence suggests that premenopausal bilateral oopho-\nrectomy has a negative effect on sexual function, our\nfindings and those of Leiblum et al23 suggest the effect\ndiminishes with increasing time from menopause. It is\npossible that the effects of bilateral oophorectomy on\nsexual function decrease as women age; therefore,\nage, rather than oophorectomy, is the main contribu-\ntor to sexual dysfunction in older women.\nLimitations of our study include the self-report of\noophorectomy. However, because women with one\nor more retained ovary may have mistakenly re-\nported bilateral oophorectomy, and women mistak-\nenly reporting to have intact ovaries may have under-\ngone bilateral procedure, we believe misclassification\nwould be nondifferential. Our study is also limited by\nits cross-sectional design. Women were not asked\nabout sexual function before and after oophorectomy;\ntherefore, causality cannot be determined. However,\nour findings suggest that oophorectomy status is not\nassociated with a permanent and lasting effect on\nsexual function in older women. Our study is limited\nby being a secondary database analysis. Further infor-\nmation on certain variables was not collected. Specifi-\ncally, we only have information on sexual ideation at\nleast once monthly. No information about the monthly\nfrequency of sexual ideation was available. Finally, this\nstudy discusses a sensitive topic and is limited by partic-\nipant nonresponse to certain questions. As reported by\nLindau et al,16 overall 2% to7% of respondents declined\nto answer questions about sexual activity and 14%\ndeclined to answer questions about masturbation. To\naccount for nonresponse, weights were used to adjust for\nthe bias of differential nonresponse. Our study is also\nstrengthened by the large sample size representative of\nthe community-dwelling older women in the United\nStates and detailed information on numerous aspects of\nsexual function in this older population, enhancing the\nstudy's external validity. In brief, our findings suggest\nthat elective oophorectomy may not play a long-term\npivotal role in the sexual ideation and function of older\nwomen.\nREFERENCES\n1.
