During this\nimportant period of growth and maturation, children gain\n20% and 50% of their adult height and weight, respectively\n(Mahan and Escott-Stump, 1996).

It is important for adolescents to lay out the\nfoundation for chronic disease prevention by the promotion\nand maintenance of healthful lifestyles (US Public Health\nService, 1990). Therefore, for a wide variety of reasons\nrelated to the rapid physical and emotional development\nduring this period, adolescence represents a period of peak\nconcern.\nLittle attention has been paid to adolescent nutrition in\ndeveloping countries. A series of studies conducted with\nsmall unrepresentative samples in Latin America and the\nCaribbean, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia represent the most\ncomplete examination of this topic (International Center for\nwere included in seven of the eleven studies.

Adolescent girls were reported at a higher risk of\ndietary inadequacy and poorer nutritional status than boys\nin several countries of Asia (Waslien and Stewart, 1994).\nHowever, there is minimal understanding about adolescent\ndietary patterns in developing countries.\nStudies from industrialized countries show that adoles-\ncents have unique dietary patterns. Adolescents may place\nthemselves at particular nutritional risk by choosing to\nfollow extreme eating patterns (Bull, 1988; American\nand skipping meals are common practice among adoles-\ncents in the United States and other Western countries\nprevalence of obesity among US adolescents is over 20%\nand still increasing (Troiano et al, 1995; US Department of\nCorrespondence: Barry M.

Rapid economic development has\nsigni\u00aecantly reduced physical activity among Chinese\nadults as well as being associated with a marked change\nin the structure of the adult diet and body composition\nnational nutrition surveys show that, during the past several\ndecades, younger Chinese children have experienced a\nsteady increase in weight and height and also a marked\nshift from problems of under-nutrition to those of over-\nweight during the past several decades (Zhang & Huang,\n1996), but little further study about adolescent nutrition in\nChina has been conducted.\nTo understand current patterns as well as short-term\nrelationships between economic change and adolescent\nnutrition, we investigated the effects of gender, age, house-\nhold income and residence on the nutritional status and\nmacronutrient intakes of Chinese adolescents in a cross-\nsectional analysis.\nMaterials and methods\nSurvey design\nThe China Health and Nutrition Surveys (CHNS) are\nlongitudinal. They cover eight provinces (Guangxi, Guiz-\nhou, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Liaoning and Shan-\ndong provinces) that vary substantially in geography,\neconomic development, public resources and health indi-\ncators. A multistage, random-cluster process was used to\ndraw the sample surveyed in each of the provinces. Coun-\nties in the eight provinces were initially strati\u00aeed by\nincome (low, middle and high), and a weighted sampling\nscheme was used to select randomly four counties in\neach province. Within each county, the township capital\nwas selected, and three villages were chosen randomly.\nEach provincial capital and a lower income city from\neach province were selected. This analysis was con\u00aened\neither the World Wide Web site for the China Health\nand Nutrition Survey (http:aawww.cpc.unc.eduaprojectsa\nchinaachina_home.htmlt) or Popkin et al (1993) for details\non the sampling.)\nAnthropometric data\nMeasurements of weight and height were obtained from all\nsubjects. Anthropometric measurements were carried out\nby trained health workers who followed standard protocol\nsimilar to the NHANES protocol developed by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics. In addition, all interviewers\nhad to take inter-observer reliability tests as part of the\ntraining. Weight was measured in light indoor clothing to\nthe nearest 0.1 kg with a beam balance scale. Height was\nmeasured without shoes to the nearest 0.1 cm using a\nportable stadiometer. Each of these measurements was\ncarried out by at least two health workers\u00d0one took the\nmeasurements while a second recorded the readings.\nSociodemographic data\nThe data concerning income and age are relevant to this\nanalysis and special attention has been paid to them. During\nthe household interview, questions about income were\nasked for all income-producing activities that each family\nmember had engaged in. Full income from market and non-\nmarket activities, such as non-monetary government sub-\nsidies (such as food ration coupons) was recorded. Accord-\ning to the practice in China, both the Western and Chinese\ncalendars were used when collecting age data, with the\ntraditional Chinese dates later converted into Western\ndates.\nDietary data\nDetailed household food consumption data and individual\ndietary intake data were collected for 3 consecutive days.\nThe sample was randomly allocated from Monday to\nSunday and almost equally balanced across the 7 days of\nthe week from each sampling unit. Household food con-\nsumption was determined from inventory change from the\nbeginning to the end of each day. Individual dietary intake\ndata for the same 3 consecutive days were obtained from all\nfamily members based on a 24-h recall basis by asking each\nindividual\u00d0except for young children, whose mothers\nwere asked. From the household dietary data, information\non the added fat (cooking oil represents a signi\u00aecant\ncomponent of fat intake for this sample of Chinese) and\nother condiments was used to supplement the individual\ndietary intake data (Zhai et al, 1996). The collection of\nhousehold and individual dietary intake allowed us to check\nthe quality of each against the other. At the time of data\ncollection, the individual and household dietary data were\ncompared and used to identify major discrepancies. Where\nsigni\u00aecant discrepancies were found, the household and the\nindividual in question were revisited and asked about their\nfood consumption to resolve these discrepancies.\nThe survey team comprised 20 \u00b1 23 trained nutritionists\nworked full time in the respective provinces and had\nexperience in other national nutrition surveys. All inter-\nover a 2-week period in methods of data collection. Inter-\nviewers were required to follow a carefully developed\nprotocol. The 1991 China Food Consumption Table (Insti-\ntute of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, 1991) was used to\ncalculate adolescent nutrient intakes from dietary data. The\nChinese RDA and the American RDA for protein and\nenergy (National Research Council, 1989) were used\nwhen evaluating macro-nutrient intakes.\nStatistical analysis\nBody mass index (BMI  weightaheight2) and height-for-\nage Z-scores were calculated for each individual.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis was con-\nducted when risk factors of stunting, under-nutrition, and\noverweight were estimated.

Boys\nconsumed more protein relative to the RDA than girls\n(P ` 0.05). Young adolescents consumed especially large\namounts of protein.

A similar trend was\nshown among urban adolescents. In the high-income group,\nsaturated fat, or high-cholesterol diet, respectively. By\n1993, in general, these percentages increased relative to\nof rural adolescents and 60% of urban adolescents had a\nhigh-fat diet.\nDiscussion\nOur principal \u00aending is that Chinese adolescents experi-\nenced an improvement of diet and nutritional status. Chi-\nnese adolescents had relatively adequate food intakes, on\naverage, with energy and protein intakes higher than the\nAmerican RDA; the prevalence of stunting declined from\nmost important nutritional problem even though the pre-\nvalence (13%) is relatively low. However, overweight or\nobesity is emerging as a problem associated with young,\nhigh-income, and urban adolescents, but the prevalence\n(4%) is quite low compared with developed countries.\nOne of the dif\u00aeculties in studying adolescent nutrition\nrelates to the selection of standards. The indicators used to\nde\u00aene overweight or obese adolescents have not been\nstandardized. Various measures recommended include\nweight-for-age, weight stature indices, skinfold thicknesses,\nbody circumference, and body mass index (BMI). BMI has\nbeen recommended as the best standard for measuring\noverweight among adolescents and it is widely used by\nthough it is argued that BMI does not distinguish fat body\nmass and lean body mass, the recommended NHCSa\nWHO gender-speci\u00aec BMI-for-age cut-offs (WHO Expert\nCommittee, 1995) were used as standards in our study based\non the following additional considerations. (a) BMI has\nbeen found signi\u00aecantly correlated with body fatness in\nMeisler & St Jeor, 1996). (b) For adolescents, BMI may be\nmore nutritionally than genetically related, and therefore the\nchoice of local versus international standards for BMI is not\nso crucial as it is for weight and height (Rolland-Cachera,\n1993), although some researchers suggest that race-speci\u00aec\nthickness is viewed by some researchers as the best\nmeasurement of adiposity among adolescents (Sangi and\nTable 5 Distribution of population by percentage of energy derived from total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol consumption, and by residence and\nTotal fat Saturated fat Cholesterol Total fat Saturated fat Cholesterol\nRural\nUrban\naThe distributions were adjusted for age and gender.\n*Within each column, differences among low, middle, and high income were signi\u00aecantly different from each other (P ` 0.05).\n**The differences between rural and urban areas were signi\u00aecant (P ` 0.05).\nNutrition and diet of Chinese adolescents\nY Wang et al\nMueller, 1991), there are many well recognized limitations\nadvantages of using a single index throughout life are\nsuf\u00aecient to support BMI as a good indicator of fatness at\nThis study found that 13% of Chinese adolescents were\nunder-nourished, but the prevalence was as high as 18%\namong younger adolescents aged 10 \u00b1 13 years.

In contrast, there is an extensive literature that\ndocuments serious under-nutrition problems among pre-\nFew published nationally representative studies about\nunder-nutrition are available for Chinese adolescents. Pre-\nvious studies found that, on average, 21% of Chinese\npreschool children and 24% of rural preschool children\nwere of low weight-for-age (de Onis et al, 1993). A 5-year\nmonitoring project in poor rural areas in China found 24 \u00b1\neconomic evidence that there may be a widening of the\nincome differences in China, especially between rural and\nurban populations, and this might exacerbate the under-\nnutrition situation we found (World Bank, 1995). Attention\nneeds to be focused on this problem, especially among\nparticular groups such as children and adolescents in poor\nrural areas and urban low-income groups.\nHowever, our \u00aendings suggest that under-nutrition\namong Chinese adolescents is not as serious as the problem\nin most developing countries, especially those in Asia.\nOnly 19% of Chinese adolescents were found to be stunted\nwere found stunted. The prevalence of underweight among\nChinese adolescents (13%) is also lower than in some other\ndeveloping countries in Asia, such as India (53%) and\nNepal (36%). In contrast to other developing countries,\nwe \u00aend that only about 1.5 times more boys were under-\nnourished than girls while Kurz reported that at least twice\nas many boys as girls were under-nourished in seven of the\neight studies he reviewed. Studies from India, Nepal,\nIndonesia, Bangladesh, and the Philippines found that\nAsian girls were at increased risk of under-nutrition and\nmortality rates, which may be the result of their lesser\naccess to a variety of services, lower priority for food than\ntheir male siblings, and other forms of discrimination\n(Waslien & Stewart, 1994). The one-child policy might\nlead to Chinese parents to provide more equitable care to\ntheir daughters.\nIn our study, 4% of adolescents were found overweight\nor obese, and younger (` 14 years), higher-income and\nurban adolescents were most likely to be overweight. As\nis well known, adolescent obesity has important health\nconsequences and is a major antecedent of adult obesity\nprevention of obesity is a public health priority with\nmuch of the concern focusing on children and adolescents\n(Power et al, 1997). Although compared with adolescents\nin the United States (over 20%) and many other industria-\nlized countries (Troiano et al, 1995; Mahan & Escott-\nvery low, the increase of obesity among Chinese children\nand adolescents should be highlighted. A few small-scale\nsurveys among Chinese school students indicate an\nincrease of the prevalence of overweight and obesity,\nespecially among urban adolescents. A study in Heilong-\njiang province found that 5% of urban school students were\n1995). Some other nonrepresentative surveys suggest that\nthe prevalence of overweight might have reached 6 \u00b1 9% in\nseveral coastal provinces in the north by the early 1990s\nprevalence we present is lower than these \u00aendings. This\nmight be explained by different standards as well as the use\nof weight-for-age data, and different sampling in our eight-\nprovince urban and rural survey as compared with these\nmuch more limited surveys, mainly conducted in higher-\nincome regions. In particular, failure to use BMI might lead\nto considerable misclassi\u00aecation.\nThe escalating obesity among children in China has\ndrawn increasing attention, but little attention has been\nfocused on adolescents. One of our previous studies shows\nthat the prevalence of overweight among Chinese children\nCHNS data (Popkin et al, 1996). It is likely that a similar\nsituation will emerge in China among adolescents to match\nthe large increase in obesity found among younger Chinese\nchildren (Popkin et al, 1996). Of great concern is that these\nexamples may suggest, with the development of China's\neconomy and changes of people's diet and lifestyles, that\nmore adolescents in China will become overweight if no\neffective approaches are adopted in time.\nOur \u00aendings suggest an increase of dietary fat intake and\na decrease in consumption of grain and cereal products\namong Chinese adolescents, particularly among the urban,\nand high-income groups. We \u00aend that, on average, urban\nadolescents obtained 26 \u00b1 29% of their calories from fat and\n7 \u00b1 8% from saturated fat (the recommended levels are 30%\nand 10%, respectively). Furthermore, among urban adoles-\ncents, 37% of he middle-income group and 60% of high-\nincome adolescents had a high-fat diet by 1993. Dramatic\nchanges in the Chinese people's diets and their nutritional\nhabits in urban and rural areas have been well addressed\nlong-term health impact of the changes of dietary fat intake\nand grain and cereal consumption among Chinese adoles-\ncents needs to be highlighted in further research.\nFinally, we found marked differences between urban\nand rural adolescents as well as among adolescents from\nfamilies with different income levels regarding their dietary\npatterns and nutritional status, but the gap of under-nutri-\ntion between urban and rural adolescents has been nar-\nrowed. This may indicate short-term impacts of the\neconomic transition on adolescent nutrition in China. In\ngeneral, urban adolescents were of better nutritional status\nas they suffered from less stunting, which marked their past\nexperience, and they were taller and heavier than their rural\ncounterparts; but they may face more problems of obesity\nand other risks related to the increase of fat intake and\nNutrition and diet of Chinese adolescents\nY Wang et al\ndecrease of cereal and grain consumption. Adolescents\nfrom high-income families suffered from fewer problems\nof stunting as well as underweight, but from more over-\nweight than low-income adolescents. These may suggest\nthat nutrition-related efforts should focus on speci\u00aec pro-\nblems among different groups.\nOne limitation of this analysis is that we did not adjust\nfor adolescents' maturational status when using the WHO-\nrecommended BMI-for-age cut-offs to assess overweight.\nIdeally, sexual maturation should be adjusted for in study-\ning the nutritional status of adolescents (de Onis & Habicht,\nthis are not well established and other studies that present\nnational data on adolescents have ignored sexual matura-\ntion, therefore, we follow the same practice of presenting\nunadjusted patterns based on age- and gender-speci\u00aec BMI\ncut-offs. A WHO Expert Committee recommended that\nwhen population estimates of maturational status were\navailable, age-speci\u00aec means or medians for anthropometry\nmight adjust for rates of maturation that differ from the\nreference data (de Onis & Habicht, 1996). However, few\ncurrent nationally representative data on maturational\nevents among Chinese adolescents, particularly boys, are\navailable, although some data suggest that the average and\nmedian ages at menarche among Chinese girls are later\nthan that for American girls, in spite of marked changes\nduring the past several decades and variation among girls in\n1997). It is known that the adiposity of adolescent males\nand females will increase with the onset of puberty\u00d0girls\ngaining more fat and boys gaining more lean tissue. There-\nfore, considering the possible different maturational status\nof Chinese adolescents, it could be the case that the\nprevalence of overweight among our study population has\nbeen underestimated by using the NCHSaWHO reference\nwithout adjusting for maturity.\nAdolescence is an important period for a person to form\ndietary habits and lifestyle, and adolescents are more free to\naccept new information. Furthermore, adolescents have the\npotential to pass nutritional knowledge to their current and\nfuture families to improve their diet and health. Therefore,\nadolescence is an important target of nutrition education\nefforts. Nutritional knowledge focusing on a balanced diet\nof plenty of vegetables, fruits, grains, cereals, protein, and\nmoderate amount of fat is of great interest for adolescent\ndevelopment and health in China.\nIn conclusion, based on our \u00aendings and results from\nprevious research, Chinese adolescents have experienced\nan improvement of diet and nutritional status, but under-\nnutrition is still an important nutritional problem especially\namong young and poor adolescents. More attention should\nbe focused on the increase of dietary fat intake and obesity,\nparticularly among urban and high family income groups.\nNutritional education focusing on health, diet and lifestyles\nshould be carried out on a broad basis in China.\n"
