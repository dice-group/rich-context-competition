    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: Cysteine-rich, angiogenic inducer, 61 (CYR61) is a key gene in the transforming growth\nfactor-b signalling pathway, which is involved in the development of many tumour types. This study\naimed to clarify the status and clinical significance of CYR61 expression in patients with ovarian\nepithelial carcinoma.\nMethods: Tissue from patients with ovarian epithelial carcinoma or benign ovarian tumours were\ninvestigated retrospectively for CYR61 expression at mRNA and protein levels, using reverse\ntranscription\u00adpolymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Correlations\nbetween immunohistochemical scores and several clinicopathological parameters were\ninvestigated.\nResults: In 50 patients with ovarian epithelial carcinoma and 50 patients with benign ovarian\ntumours, CYR61 expression on mRNA and protein levels was significantly higher in ovarian\nepithelial carcinoma tissue than in benign ovarian tissue. CYR61 expression was associated with\nregional lymph node metastases and progression of clinical disease stage. There was no difference\nin CYR61 expression between patients aged <50 years and !50 years.\nConclusions: CYR61 expression was significantly upregulated in ovarian carcinoma tissue\ncompared with benign ovarian tumour tissue samples. Protein CYR61 levels were associated\nwith lymph node metastases and Union for International Cancer Control stage. Protein CYR61\nmay be useful in targeted diagnosis and therapy, for patients with ovarian epithelial carcinoma.\n",

This inter-\naction results in activation of TGF-b so\nthat it can bind to its receptors, thus\nstimulating the Smad pathway.7,8 Smad\nproteins can bind to protein CYR61,\nwhich leads to transcription of CYR61,\nand activation of angiogenesis and tumour\nfore, play a key role in growth and\ndevelopment, and is critically involved in\nCYR61 expression has been shown to be\nsignificantly higher in Barrett's oesopha-\ngeal adenocarcinoma tissue than in\nBarrett's oesophageal tissue with no sign\nexpression and prognosis in ovarian\nepithelial cancer, however, remains\nuncertain.\nThe present study aimed to explore\nCYR61 expression and determine whether\nprotein CYR61 could be a prognostic factor\nin ovarian epithelial carcinoma. Expression\nof CYR61 in ovarian epithelial carcinoma\nwas investigated by immunohistochemical\nstaining. In addition, the relationship\nbetween CYR61 expression and clinico-\npathological parameters in patients with\novarian epithelial carcinoma was\ninvestigated.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population and sample collection\nPatients with primary ovarian epithelial\ncarcinoma and patients with benign ovar-\nian tumours, treated at the Department of\nObstetrics and Gynaecology, The Second\nHospital, Jilin University, Changchun,\nMarch 2013, were included in this retro-\nspective study. Patients with a previous or\nsecondary malignancy, or who had previ-\nously undergone chemotherapy or radio-\ntherapy treatment, were excluded from the\nstudy. Clinicopathological information was\ncollected from the data held in records for\nthe patients diagnosed with ovarian epi-\nthelial carcinoma. Tumours were staged\naccording to the tumour\u00adnode\u00admetastasis\nstaging system of the Union for\nInternational Cancer Control (UICC; 5th\nAll patients received standard surgery\nas appropriate, to provide maximal\ntumour resection. For each patient, a\nsample of ovarian tissue had been fixed\nin 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin\nwax and cut into 4 -mm thick serial sec-\ntions for immunohistochemical staining;\na second sample had been snap-frozen\nat \u00ad80C for subsequent total RNA isola-\ntion; methodologies are described fully\nbelow.\nThis study was approved by the Ethics\nCommittee of the Second Hospital, Jilin\nUniversity. Written informed consent was\nobtained from all participants.\nRNA preparation and semiquantitative\nTotal RNA was isolated from the frozen\novarian tissue samples using TRIzol\u00d5\nreagent (InvitrogenTM, Life Technologies,\nCarlsbad, CA, USA) according to the\nmanufacturer's protocol. In short, the\ntissue, frozen at \u00ad80C was ground using\na pestle and mortar. 100 mg of ground\ntissue was then incubated with 1 ml\nTRIzol\u00d5 reagent for 5 min at room tem-\nperature. Cell debris was removed by cen-\nand 0.4 ml chloroform was added. The mix\nwas then vortexed, followed by incubation\nfor 5 min at room temperature. The phases\nwere separated by centrifugation at 12\nphase was transferred to a new tube.\n0.6 \u00c2 volume isopropyl alcohol and\n0.1 \u00c2 volume 3 M sodium acetate were\nadded to this aqueous phase and incubated\nfor 10 min at 4C. The precipitated RNA\nfor 15 min at 4C and, following removal\nof the supernatant, the RNA was washed\ntwice with 70% ethanol. The RNA was\ndried and resuspended in 30 ml of diethyl-\npyrocarbonate-treated water. Using 1 mg\nmRNA as the template, single-stranded\ncDNAs were generated using 1 ml (200 IU)\nSuperscript\u00d5 II reverse transcriptase\n(InvitrogenTM) according to the manufac-\nturer's instructions. Polymerase chain reac-\ntion (PCR) amplification of the cDNA was\nconducted using the following CYR61\nprimer sequences: sense, 50-\nACA-30. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate\ndehydrogenase was amplified as the inter-\nnal control using the following primers: 50-\nreverse: 50-ACACCA TGTAT\nBiosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). PCR\nwas performed using the premix EX Taq\u00d5\nVersion 2.0 mix (Takara, Dalian, China).\nBriefly, the qPCR was performed in 10 -ml\nreactions containing 4 ml of cDNA and 5 ml\nSYBR\u00d5 Green Master Mix (Takara), and\n1 ml of 100 mM stock primer mix. The PCR\nconditions were 94C for 3 min, followed\nby 32 cDNA amplification cycles of 40 s at\na final extension period of 5 min at 72C.\nPCR products were separated by electro-\nphoresis at a constant voltage of 2 V/cm in\na 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel. Images were\ngraphics array (BioImage Products, Ann\nArbor, MI, USA) and the integrated den-\nsities value was analysed using Motic\nImages Advanced, version 3.2 image ana-\nlysis software (Motic, Hong Kong, China).\nImmunohistochemistry assay\nTo detect CYR61 expression and localiza-\ntion of protein CYR61 in ovarian tissue,\nimmunohistochemistry was performed using\na streptavidin\u00adperoxidase immunohisto-\nchemical staining kit (Tiangen; Beijing,\nChina) according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions. In short, ovarian tissues were\nfixed in 10% buffered formalin, dehydrated\nin ethanol, embedded in paraffin wax and\ncut into 4 -mm thick sections for use in\nimmunohistochemistry analyses. Sections\nwere deparaffinized in xylene and rehy-\ndrated with graded alcohols. For heat-\ninduced epitope retrieval, sections were\nimmersed in 0.01 M citrate buffer solution\n(pH 6.0) and pressure cooked for 10 min (the\npressure of this step was not constant).\nSections were then cooled for 1 h at room\ntemperature, then washed in water and\n0.01 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS;\napplied to block endogenous peroxidase\nactivity and the sections were incubated\nwith normal goat serum at 37C for 2 h to\nreduce nonspecific binding. Sections were\nthen incubated overnight at 4C with pri-\nmary rabbit antihuman CYR61 (polyclonal;\n1 : 25 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,\nSanta Cruz, CA, USA), then washed three\nSecondary biotinylated goat antirabbit\nBiotech, Beijing, China) was added at 37C\nPBS (pH 7.2), sections were stained using\nthe ImmunoCruzTM ABC staining system\n(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the colour\nwas developed with diaminobenzidine,\naccording to the manufacturer's instruc-\ntions. The immunohistochemical staining\ncations using an Olympus BX51 light micro-\nscope (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan).\nPBS was used in place of the primary\nantibody as a negative control.\nThe level of immunoreactivity was\nassessed according to a semiquantitative\nmethod16 and was measured using a\nscale between \u00c0 and \u00fe\u00fe\u00fe, where \u00c0 repre-\nsented no immunostaining; \u00fe represented\n50% of cells reactive; \u00fe\u00fe\u00fe represented\n>50% of cells reactive. Scores of \u00c0 and \u00fe\nwere considered to be negative; scores of \u00fe\u00fe\nand \u00fe\u00fe\u00fe were considered to be positive.\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed with\nSPSS\u00d5 software, version 13.0 (SPSS Inc.,\nChicago, IL, USA) for Windows\u00d5. Student's\nt-test was used to compare means between\ntwo groups. The relationships between\nCYR61 expression and clinicopathological\nvariables (including age, UICC stage and\npresence of lymph node metastasis) in\npatients with ovarian epithelial carcinoma\nwere examined using V2-test. Data were\npresented as mean \u00c6 SD and n (%) inci-\ndence. P values <0.05 were considered to be\nstatistically significant.\nResults\nThis study included 50 patients with ovarian\nyears) and 50 patients with benign ovarian\nwere no significant between-group differ-\nences in terms of mean age (Student's t-test).\nSemiquantitative RT\u00adPCR analysis\nshowed that levels of CYR61 mRNA were\nsignificantly increased in ovarian epithelial\ncarcinoma tissue compared with benign\novarian tumour tissue (P < 0.05; Figure 1).\nProtein CYR61 immunoreactivity in\novarian tissue appeared as fine, granular to\ndiffuse cytoplasmic and membrane staining\n(Figure 2). Positive immunohistochemical\nstaining for protein CYR61 (i.e. \u00fe\u00fe or\n\u00fe\u00fe\u00fe staining intensity) was detected in\nwith ovarian epithelial carcinoma; these\nlevels of staining were significantly higher\nthan those seen in the benign tumour group\nThe association between CYR61 expres-\nsion and various clinicopathological factors\nassociated with ovrarian epithelial carcin-\noma (including patient age, presence of\nlymph node metastasis and clinical stage),\nwas examined (Table 1). Patients with lymph\nnode metastasis were found to exhibit sig-\nnificantly higher CYR61 expression levels\nthan those with no metastasis (P < 0.001).\nCYR61 expression levels were also found to\nbe higherin patients with clinical stageIII\u00adIV\ncarcinoma compared with stage I\u00adII disease\nin CYR61 expression between patients aged\nFigure 1.

Levels of CYR61\nexpression were significantly upregulated in\nthe ovarian epithelial carcinoma group com-\npared with the benign tumour group at both\nan mRNA and protein level. Furthermore,\nin the patients with ovarian epithelial car-\ncinoma, significant associations were identi-\nfied between levels of protein CYR61 and\nUICC stage and lymph node metastasis,\nsuggesting that CYR61 expression may be\ninvolved in disease pathogenesis.\nProtein CYR61 is a secreted, heparin-\nbinding and extracellular matrix-associated\nangiogenic inducer belonging to the CNN1\u00ad\n6 family, which regulates cell adhesion,\nmigration, proliferation and differentiation,\nand is involved in tumour growth.5,6\nResearch shows that CYR61 may be\nregarded as both a suppressor and a pro-\nmoter of cancer progression and tumour\nCYR61 can suppress carcinogenesis in non-\nsmall cell lung cancer or gastric carcin-\nshown that CYR61 can enhance carcinogen-\ntumour growth in a gastric adenocarcinoma\ncell line, RF-1, and in breast cancer cell\nlines,19\u00ad21 are consistent with results of the\npresent study, in which CYR61 expression\nlevels were increased in patients with ovarian\nepithelial carcinoma compared with those\nwith benign tumours, and upregulation of\nprotein CYR61 was significantly associated\nwith lymph node metastases and UICC\nstage. These results suggest that the level of\nCYR61 expression may be associated with\nthe malignant potential of ovarian epithelial\ncarcinomas.\nIn conclusion, the present retrospective\nstudy demonstrated that CYR61 expression\nwas significantly upregulated in ovarian\ncarcinoma tissue compared with benign\novarian tumour tissue, and that upregula-\ntion of protein CYR61 was significantly\nassociated with presence of lymph node\nmetastasis and UICC stage III\u00adIV disease,\nin patients with ovarian epithelial carcin-\noma. The present study findings suggest that\nCYR61 may play a key role in the develop-\nment of malignant tumours.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nTable 1.
