    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study investigated a key claim of risk regulation theory, namely, that psychological internalizing of a relationship threat\nwill serve as a mediator of the link between self-models (self-esteem and attachment anxiety) and relationship responses\n(moving closer to a partner vs. distancing from a partner). Participants (N = 101) received feedback that threatened their\ncurrent romantic relationship (or no feedback) and then completed measures of internal\u00adexternal focus, relationship\ncloseness\u00addistancing, and acceptance\u00adrejection of the feedback. Results showed that participants with negative self-models\nresponded to the relationship threat by becoming more internally focused and by distancing from their partners, whereas\nthose with positive self-models became more externally focused and moved closer to their partners. Mediation analyses\nindicated that the link between self-models and relationship closeness\u00addistancing was partially explained by internal focus.\n",

Ironically, people who prioritize self-protection goals\nare actually more vulnerable to eventual rejection compared\nwith those who prioritize relationship-promotion goals\n(Downey, Freitas, Michaelis, & Khouri, 1998; Murray,\nGriffin, Rose, & Bellavia, 2003; Stinson, Cameron, Wood,\nRisk regulation theory suggests that individual differ-\nences in mental representations of the self play an important\nrole in determining which goals are prioritized (Murray,\nHolmes, & Collins, 2006). According to the theory, people\nwith negative self-models (NSMs)--who doubt their self-\nworth and expect rejection--will tend to adopt a self-protec-\ntive interpersonal style aimed at limiting the pain of\nanticipated rejection (Cameron, Stinson, Gaetz, & Balchen,\n2010). When threats are detected, they are likely to (a) ques-\ntion their partner's acceptance, (b) internalize the threat (e.g.,\ninternal focus, internal attributions), and (c) reduce depen-\ndence on their partner and their relationship. In contrast,\nthose with positive self-models (PSMs)--who are high in\nself-worth and confidently expect acceptance from others--\nare likely to adopt a more risky, relationship-promoting\ninterpersonal style aimed at fostering closeness with others\n(Cameron etal., 2010). They are likely to respond to rela-\ntionship threat by (a) increasing their confidence in their\npartner's acceptance, (b) externalizing the threat (e.g., exter-\nnal focus, external attributions), and (c) drawing closer to\ntheir partner and their relationship.\nConsistent with these assumptions, studies have shown\nthat people with NSMs respond to relationship threats by\ndefensively distancing from their partners (e.g., Collins,\nMurray, Rose, Bellavia, Holmes, & Kusche, 2002). For\nexample, when dating participants were led to believe that\ntheir partner found them to have many faults (a relationship\nthreat), those with low (vs. high) self-esteem felt less\naccepted by their partner, rated their partner more negatively\non a series of interpersonal traits, and reported feeling less\nclose to their partner (Murray et\nanother study, dating participants who were high (vs. low) in\nattachment-related anxiety (who worry about being rejected\nor unloved) responded to partner transgressions by making\nmore relationship-threatening attributions and reporting\nbehavioral intentions that were likely to weaken their rela-\nThe goal of the current study was to examine one impor-\ntant mechanism through which self-models regulate\nresponses to threat.

For those with NSMs, self-doubts and concerns about\nrejection should lead them to focus on the implications of the\nthreat for their personal well-being (in an egocentric fashion)\nand to look for internal explanations for the threat (for exam-\nple, locating the cause in a flawed self). Turning inward and\nprocessing the threat from a self-immersed perspective\nshould then foster defensive distancing (Ayduk & Kross,\n2010). In contrast, for those with PSMs, their confidence in\ntheir worth and expectations of acceptance should lead them\nto respond to relationship threat in a less egocentric and more\ninterdependent fashion and to look for external explanations\nfor the threat (perhaps locating the cause in external events).\nTurning outward should allow them to maintain confidence\nin their relationship and should promote movement toward\nthe partner. Although these theoretical claims have not been\ntested within ongoing relationships, Ford and Collins (2010)\nprovided some initial evidence in a study of strangers in\nwhich participants were exposed to an ambiguous rejection\nfrom a potential dating partner. Participants with low (vs.\nhigh) self-esteem made more internal, self-blaming attribu-\ntions for the rejection, experienced greater cortisol reactivity\n(a physiological indicator of self-threat), and were more\nlikely to derogate their interaction partner. Importantly, self-\nblame attributions mediated self-esteem differences in corti-\nsol reactivity and partner derogation.\nIt is important to investigate this same mediation process\nin ongoing relationships, as risk regulation theory is primar-\nily designed to explain processes in relationships where\nsome degree of dependence on a partner has already been\nestablished. Does this same mediation process explain defen-\nsive distancing in ongoing relationships? To investigate this\nquestion, we assessed two novel measures of internalizing\u00ad\nexternalizing responses to relationship threat, (a) implicit\nself-focus (vs. other focus) and (b) self-conscious emotions\n(e.g., guilt, shame). First, we reasoned that increased inter-\nnalization would be revealed in heightened self-focus fol-\nlowing a relationship threat. Self-focus involves a focusing\nof attention inward (toward features of the self), rather than\noutward (toward other people or toward the situation). Based\non risk regulation theory, individuals with NSMs (compared\nwith those with PSMs) should become more self-focused\nfollowing a potential relationship threat as they turn inward\nto find an explanation for the event. To our knowledge, no\nstudy has examined focus of attention following relationship\nthreat. Second, we reasoned that internalization would be\nreflected in emotional responses to the threat. In particular,\nwe focused on self-conscious emotions, which are a set of\nemotions triggered by a failure of the self or one's behavior.\nTwo closely related and frequently co-occurring self-con-\nscious emotions are shame, which involves a negative evalu-\nation of the self, and guilt, which involves a negative\nevaluation of one's behavior (Tangney, Youman, & Stuewig,\n2007). According to social self-preservation theory, threats\nto the social self (such as relationship threat) will evoke self-\nconscious emotions as the focal emotional response\n(Dickerson, Gruenewald, & Kemeny, 2004). This should be\nespecially true for those with NSMs who are more likely to\nbecome self-focused following a social threat, resulting in\nheightened awareness of their negative self-aspects and\nincreased self-blame for the social threat (Ford & Collins,\n2010). In contrast, individuals with PSMs should be less\nlikely to turn inward and to blame themselves for the poten-\ntial threat, and should be comparatively buffered from feel-\nings of shame or guilt. Importantly, for our study,\nself-conscious emotions following threat are associated with\nwithdrawal and disengagement (to prevent further loss of\nsocial self-esteem; Dickerson etal., 2004), as well as defen-\nIn summary, self-focused attention and self-conscious\nemotions should go hand in hand as two important indicators\nof internalization. These markers of internalization should,\nin turn, help explain relationship-distancing behavior follow-\ning threat. To the extent that self-focused attention heightens\nawareness of negative self-aspects and increases feelings of\nshame and guilt for individuals with NSMs, they should be\nlikely to prioritize self-protection goals and distance them-\nselves from their partner. In contrast, if individuals with\nPSMs turn their attention outward in response to threat, they\nshould be less likely to experience self-conscious emotions\nand more likely to view the threat in a broader, less self-\nfocused perspective that enables them to approach their part-\nner and to protect or enhance their relationship.\nThe Current Study\nThe primary aim of this study was to explore the role of psy-\nchological internalizing of a relationship threat as a mediator\nof the link between self-models and relationship responses.\nTo accomplish this aim, we conducted a two-part study.\nDuring Session 1, participants completed measures of gen-\neral and relational self-models (self-esteem and attachment-\nrelated anxiety). During Session 2, they were randomly\nassigned to a \"relationship threat\" or a \"no threat\" condition\n(described below). Cognitive and emotional responses were\nthen assessed.\nWe predicted that individuals with PSMs and NSMs\nwould respond differently to the relationship threat. Those\nwith NSMs should report more internalization as reflected in\nincreased self-focus and increased self-conscious emotions.\nThey should also move away from the partner following\nrelationship threat by derogating their partner, making pes-\nsimistic predictions for the future of their relationship, and\nreducing closeness. In contrast, those with PSM should\nreport less internalization and more movement toward their\npartner following relationship threat by maintaining positive\nimages of their partner, making optimistic predictions about\nthe future, and maintaining or increasing closeness. Finally,\nFord and Collins 3\nwe predicted that movement toward/away from the partner\nwould be mediated by differences in internalizing/external-\nizing responses.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants were 101 undergraduate students (65 females)\nwere recruited from a large public university in California.\nSixty-nine percent of participants were White, 14% were\nAsian/Pacific Islander, 9% were Latino/Hispanic, 2% were\nBlack/African American, and 6% were of a different race\nthan those listed. All participants were in a romantic relation-\nreceived US$15.00 or course credit for their participation.\nProcedure\nSession 1:Questionnaire session. Groups of one to four partici-\npants completed measures of general and relational self-\nmodels (described below).\nSession 2: Experimental session. One week later, participants\nreported individually to the lab and were randomly assigned\nto the relationship threat or no threat condition. To create a\nrelationship threat, we adapted a methodology used by Mur-\nray etal. (2002) in which participants completed a bogus\nrelationship scale and received false feedback. The question-\nnaire asked participants to rate how often their partner\nengaged in various behaviors. There were 18 items that var-\nied by condition. In the threat condition, 13 items described\nnegative partner behaviors (e.g., \"How often does your part-\nner seem emotionally distant?\") and the remaining 5 items\ndescribed positive (e.g., \"How often does your partner laugh\nat jokes you make?\") or neutral (e.g., \"How often does your\npartner discuss current events with you?\") behaviors. In\naddition, participants responded on a skewed response scale\nthat was anchored in a way that elicited high scores (responses\nranged from \"never\" to \"a few times a month\"). In the control\ncondition, 5 items were negative, 10 items were positive, and\n3 items were neutral.\nAfter completing the questionnaire, participants in the\nrelationship threat condition received false feedback. The\nexperimenter ostensibly scored the questionnaire and told\nparticipants that their score was a \"70\" and that this score\nwas quite a bit higher than average. They were told that this\nreflected a low level of involvement on the part of their\nromantic partner and that over time this would be likely to\nlead to disillusionment or dissatisfaction. Participants in the\ncontrol condition did not receive feedback.\nAll participants then engaged in a filler activity (labeling\nstates on a blank map) and completed the dependent measures,\nincluding implicit self-focus and self-conscious emotions\n(measures of internalization), ratings of the partner, predic-\ntions for the future of the relationship and inclusion of the part-\nner in the self (measures of partner closeness/distancing), and\nacceptance/rejection of the threatening feedback (the manipu-\nlation check). Finally, participants were carefully debriefed.\nSession 1 Measures of Self-Models\nSelf-esteem.Self-esteem was measured with the 10-item\nwhich assesses global self-evaluation (e.g., \"On the whole, I\nam satisfied with myself\"). Participants rated each item on a\nscale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).\nAttachment-related anxiety.\nBecause chronic attachment-\nrelated anxiety and relationship-specific attachment-related\nanxiety both play an important role in shaping responses to\nrelationship events (Collins, Guichard, Ford, & Feeney,\n2004), we assessed both constructs. To measure chronic anx-\niety, participants completed a shortened (14-item) version of\nthe anxiety subscale of Brennan, Clark, and Shaver's (1998)\nExperiences in Close Relationships (ECR) Scale, which\nmeasures the extent to which a person is worried about being\nrejected, abandoned, or unloved (e.g., \"I worry about being\nabandoned,\" \"When others disapprove of me, I feel really\nbad about myself\"). Participants responded to each item on a\nscale from 1 (not at all like me) to 7 (exactly like me) in terms\nof their general orientation toward close relationships ( =\n.94). The relationship-specific scale contained identical\nitems except that some items were re-worded to refer to the\ncurrent partner (e.g., \"When my partner disapproves of me I\nfeel really bad about myself\") and participants responded in\nterms of their specific orientation toward their current rela-\ntionship ( = .92). The chronic and relationship-specific\nanxiety scales were strongly correlated with each other,\nSelf-model. To achieve the most valid and reliable assessment\nof self-models, we standardized and combined scores on\nself-esteem, chronic attachment anxiety (reverse-coded), and\nrelationship-specific attachment anxiety (reverse-coded) into\na single index (average r = .68,  = .86), with high scores\nindicating a more positive model of self. This composite self-\nmodel variable allowed us to capture various facets of indi-\nviduals' self-models, including general self-worth\n(self-esteem), general self-worth in relationships (chronic\nattachment anxiety), and self-worth in one's specific rela-\ntionship with one's own romantic partner (relationship-spe-\ncific). All three of these measures have been investigated as\nimportant predictors of risk regulation processes (Collins,\nRather than presenting the findings for each measure of self-\nmodel separately, we will present findings in terms of this\n4 SAGE Open\ncomposite self-model variable to avoid complexity and space\nissues. It should be noted that even when these variables are\ninvestigated individually, the overall pattern of results is\ncomparable across the three measures.\nSession 2 Dependent Measures\nAs mentioned previously, all dependent measures were\nassessed following the delivery of the relationship threat\nfeedback (or no feedback, in the case of the control\ncondition).\nMeasures of internalization/externalization\nSelf-conscious emotions.Participants described how they\nwere feeling \"right now\" by rating a series of emotions on\na scale from 1 (very slightly) to 5 (extremely). For the cur-\nrent investigation, we computed a two-item index of self-\nconscious emotions (guilty, ashamed;  = .68).1\nImplicit self-focus.\nParticipants completed a 12-item\nimplicit measure of self-focus based on a measure created\nby Wegner and Giuliano (1980). Participants completed a\nseries of sentences by choosing among three pronoun alter-\nnatives, one of which was first-person singular (e.g., \"The\nnoise got to us/them/me before long,\" \"I/he/she spent the day\nat the beach\"). We computed an implicit self (vs. other) focus\nscore by computing the proportion of first-person, singular\nresponses chosen. Scores ranged from 0 to .667.\nComposite measure of internalization. To provide the most\nvalid assessment of internalization, we created a composite\nmeasure by standardizing and combining scores for self-con-\nscious emotions and implicit self-focus. Although these two\nvariables were only modestly correlated (r = .18, p = .07),\nthe combined index enabled us to capture different facets of\ninternalization, thereby increasing the sensitivity of our mea-\nsurment.2 High scores indicate more internalization.\nMeasures of movement toward/away from the partner\nRatings of partner traits.Participants rated their roman-\ntic partner on a series of positive and negative interpersonal\ntraits (adapted from Murray etal., 2002) using a scale from\n1 (not at all characteristic) to 9 (completely characteristic).\nWe computed an eight-item index of positive partner evalu-\nations ( = .89; kind and affectionate, considerate, loving,\nwarm, understanding, tolerant and accepting, responsive,\nand forgiving).\nPredictions for the future. Participants were presented with\na series of positive and negative relationship events (adapted\nfrom Murray etal., 2002) and were asked to predict how fre-\nquently they thought each event would occur in the next 6\nmonths, using a scale from 1 (rarely, if ever) to 7 (frequently).\nWe computed a six-item index of optimistic predictions ( =\n.75; for example, \"My partner will provide needed support if\nI am feeling down,\" \"I will be tolerant and generous if my\npartner behaves badly.\")5.\nInclusion of other in the self.Participants completed the\ninclusion of other in the self scale (Aron, Aron, & Smollan,\n1992), which is a pictorial measure of closeness consisting\nof a series of progressively overlapping circles. Scores range\nfrom 1 (non-overlapping circles, suggesting very little close-\nness) to 7 (highly overlapping circles, suggesting a great\ndeal of closeness). Participants chose the picture that best\nrepresented their relationship.\nComposite measure of movement toward/away from the\npartner.A composite measure of partner closeness/distanc-\ning was created by standardizing and combining measures of\npositive partner ratings, positive predictions for the future of\nthe relationship, and inclusion of other in the self ( = .67).3\nHigh scores indicate increased closeness to the partner.\nMeasure of perceived partner involvement.Finally, partici-\npants responded to the question \"How involved is your part-\nner in your relationship?\" using a scale from 1 (much less\ninvolved than average) to 7 (much more involved than aver-\nage). This was the final item on the questionnaire and it was\nintended to serve as a manipulation check and to measure the\nextent to which participants in the relationship threat condi-\ntion accepted the threatening feedback.\nResults\nRegression Analyses\nTo examine the effect of self-models on responses to rela-\ntionship threat, we conducted moderated regression analy-\nses. We entered the main effects of self-model (continuous)\nand experimental condition (0 = control, 1 = threat) on Step\n1, and the Self-Model \u00d7 Condition interaction on Step 2. To\nfollow-up on significant interactions, we computed simple\nslopes and predicted means at \u00b11SD from the mean on self-\nmodels (Aiken & West, 1991). As mentioned previously, we\npredicted that the threat manipulation would move partici-\npants in different directions depending on their self-mod-\nels--those with NSMs would become more negative/\npessimistic in the threat condition compared with the control\ncondition, whereas those with PSMs would become less neg-\native (and more positive) in the threat versus control\nconditions.\nPerceived partner involvement (manipulation check).There\nwas no main effect of experimental condition ( = .008,\np = .930), a significant main effect of self-model ( = .349,\np < .001), and a significant Self-Model \u00d7 Condition interac-\nassociation between self-models and perceived partner\nFord and Collins 5\nbut there was a significant association in the threat condition\n( = .507, p = <.001); those with NSMs rated their partner as\nsignificantly less involved than those with PSMs. These\nfindings indicate that those with NSMs tended to accept the\nthreatening feedback, whereas those with PSMs tended to\ndiscount or reject it.\nComposite measure of internalization.There were significant\nFigure 2, the threat manipulation moved people in different\ndirections depending on their self-models.

Manipulation check by self-model and condition.\nNote. Predicted means were computed at 1 SD above/below the mean on self-model.\nFigure 2. Internalization by self-model and condition.\nNote.

Viewed another way,\nin the threat condition, those with PSMs (vs. those with\nNSMs) reported more movement toward the partner\n( = .512, p < .001), whereas in the control condition, those\nwith PSMs and NSMs did not differ in terms of the amount\nMediation Analyses\nWe conducted a mediated moderation analysis to test whether\ninternalization of threat mediated the Self-Model \u00d7 Condition\ninteraction on movement toward (or away from) the partner,\nfollowing procedures outlined by Baron and Kenny (1986)\nand Hayes (2013). As summarized in Figure 4, prior analyses\nrevealed a significant Self-Model \u00d7 Condition interaction\npredicting both movement toward the partner (the outcome)\nand internalization (the mediator). Internalization in turn, sig-\nnificantly predicted movement toward the partner (b = -.326,\n = -.324, p = .03), and the original Self-Model \u00d7 Condition\neffect was no longer significant. This mediated (indirect)\neffect was statistically significant as indicated by the boot-\nstrapped, bias-corrected confidence interval for the unstan-\nthese findings are consistent with the idea that movement\ntoward (or away from) the partner following threat is medi-\nated by internalization. Those with NSMs were more likely to\ninternalize the threat and were then more likely to move away\nfrom (vs. toward) their partner. In contrast, those with PSMs\nwere less likely to internalize the threat and were then more\nlikely to move toward (vs. away from) their partner.\nFigure 3. Movement toward the partner by self-model and condition.\nNote. Predicted means were computed at 1 SD above/below the mean on self-model.\nFigure 4. Summary of the mediated moderation model.\nNote. The value in parentheses shows the Self-Model \u00d7 Threat interaction effect before controlling for the mediator (internalization). The main effects of\nSelf-Model and Threat were also included in this analysis but are not illustrated here.\nFord and Collins 7\nSupplemental Analysis\nIn a final analysis, we wanted to rule out the possibility that\nthe observed effects for self-models might reflect pre-exist-\ning differences in relationship quality. There was a modest\npositive correlation between our self-model index and rela-\ntionship satisfaction (r = .34, p = .001) indicating that those\nwith more PSMs were in happier relationships. Thus, it is\npossible that the moderating effects of self-models were due\nto differences in the quality of participants' relationships\nrather than self-models per se. Therefore, we repeated all\nanalyses controlling for relationship satisfaction. The results\nremained the same as those reported above. Only the interac-\ntion effect for perceived partner involvement (our manipula-\ntion check) changed from significant to marginal. Thus, the\nobserved findings for self-models cannot be explained by\ndifferences in relationship quality.\nDiscussion\nFindings from this study provide evidence for a key assump-\ntion of risk regulation theory, namely, that internalization of\nrelationship threat is one important pathway through which\nself-models motivate self-protection versus relationship-pro-\nmotion goals. In the current study, those with NSMs were\nmore likely to engage in responses reflecting internalization\n(namely, focusing on the self and experiencing self-conscious\nemotions) following relationship threat. These responses in\nturn predicted distancing from the partner by rating the partner\nless positively, making less positive predictions for the future\nof the relationship, and reporting less closeness to the partner\non a measure of inclusion of the partner in one's sense of self.\nAlthough this pattern of responses is motivated by self-protec-\ntion concerns, it has been shown to paradoxically increase the\nrisk of being rejected by one's partner (Downey etal., 1998;\nMurray, Bellavia, Rose, & Griffin, 2003). Thus, this pattern of\nbehavior has important implications for the interpersonal out-\ncomes experienced by individuals with NSMs.\nAlthough most research on risk regulation has focused on\nthe vulnerabilities associated with NSMs, the current find-\nings highlight the importance of PSMs as a source of strength\nand resilience in the face of relationship threat. These find-\nings confirm that the moderating effect of self-models on\nresponses to relationship threat are not simply fueled by the\nharmful responses of those with NSMs (Murray, Griffin,\netal., 2003). When faced with a relationship threat, those\nwith PSMs do not simply avoid the downward, self-protec-\ntive spiral of those with NSMs but rather they engage in\nactive coping responses to protect and even boost their rela-\ntionship. Researchers should continue to identify the specific\nrelationship-boosting responses that those with PSMs engage\nin following relationship threat, as well as the mechanisms\nthat lead to these responses.\nIn addition, the current findings underscore the impor-\ntance of an external focus in response to relationship threat\nand the benefits that a less egocentric point of view can\nbring. Work investigating the benefits of an external focus\nhas largely been done in the context of participants recalling\nan intense negative event (Kross & Ayduk, 2011). The cur-\nrent study illustrates that for vulnerable groups, such as those\nwith NSMs, a less intense event (even a suggestion of a\nthreat to one's relationship) is enough to trigger an internal\nfocus and subsequent movement away from one's partner.\nPerhaps if individuals with NSMs can be trained to focus\nexternally following a relationship threat and to engage in\nreflection from a self-distanced perspective, they will avoid\nthe negative mental, physical, and interpersonal outcomes\n(Ayduk & Kross, 2010; Finkel, Slotter, Luchies, Walton, &\nization. Future work should investigate whether training\nthose with NSMs to take a less self-immersed perspective\nfollowing relationship threat can help them achieve better\ninterpersonal outcomes.\nAlthough the current findings were largely consistent\nwith our hypotheses, a few unpredicted findings deserve\ncomment. First, our manipulation check (ratings of partner\ninvolvement) did not show the expected main effect of con-\ndition, but rather an interaction effect; participants with\nPSMs defended against the threatening feedback by rating\ntheir partner as more rather than less involved in the threat\n(vs. control) condition. This finding is not entirely surpris-\ning. It is consistent with predictions of risk regulation theory\nand with findings from other studies which show that people\nwith PSMs overestimate acceptance in risky social situations\n(Cameron et\nviewing this finding as a limitation, we view it as further\nevidence of the tendency for those with PSMs to actively\ndefend their relationship against external threats by discount-\ning concerns about relationship threat and maintaining (and\neven increasing) a sense of confidence in the relationship.\nFinally, it is important to comment on a possible alterna-\ntive interpretation of our findings. Might the current findings\nreflect pre-existing differences between those with PSMs\nand NSMs in terms of relationship quality? This is unlikely\ngiven that in the absence of threatening feedback (in the con-\ntrol condition), those with PSMs and NSMs rated their part-\nners as equally involved. In addition, when we repeated all\nanalyses controlling for relationship satisfaction, the results\nremained largely the same. Thus, we feel confident that the\nobserved effects for self-models do not merely reflect differ-\nences in the quality of the relationships in which those with\nPSMs and NSMs reside.\nLimitations and Future Directions\nIt is worth noting a few limitations to the current study. First,\nas is often the case with laboratory studies of close relation-\nships, our sample was a college student sample. Thus, care\nshould be taken in generalizing beyond this sample to other\ngroups of individuals, such as older adults. Future studies\n8 SAGE Open\nshould test risk regulation processes in various age groups. In\naddition, because our sample had a mean relationship length\nof 15 months, care should be taken in generalizing these find-\nings to those in relationships of much greater length. Future\nstudies should investigate whether the interaction between\nself-model and relationship threat affects internalization and\nmovement toward/away from the partner in a similar way for\nthose in relationships of greater length. It is possible that over\ntime, as partners grow more confident in each other's commit-\nment, those with NSMs are less likely to internalize threats\nand subsequently less likely to distance from the partner. In\naddition, it should be noted that all measurements in the cur-\nrent study were self-report measures. Future work should use\nmore objective measures that are less prone to bias or to social\ndesirability effects. For example, behavioral measures of part-\nner distancing and physiological measures of internalization\ncould be incorporated into future work.\nFinally, the current findings are based on a limited con-\nceptualization of internalization and movement toward/away\nfrom the partner. Future work should incorporate additional\nmeasures of internalization and movement toward/away\nfrom the partner in tests of the mediational model investi-\ngated here. For example, additional measures of internaliza-\ntion may include rumination and reductions in state\nself-esteem, and additional measures of movement toward/\naway from the partner may include reductions in self-disclo-\nsure to the partner and non-verbal signs of withdrawal/dis-\ntancing. This would allow for a more complete understanding\nof the specific pattern of responding that leads to better or\npoorer relationship outcomes for those with positive and\nConclusion\nThe current findings provide empirical support for an impor-\ntant assertion of risk regulation theory, namely that looking\ninward following a relationship threat will motivate self-pro-\ntective responses, and that looking outward will motivate\nrelationship-promoting responses. Because internalizing a\nsocial threat has been associated with poor psychological\nand physical outcomes (Dickerson, Mycek, & Zaldivar,\nple with NSMs may be at higher risk for negative personal\nand interpersonal outcomes in response to social threat. In\ncontrast, those with PSMs are able to take life's lemons and\nmake lemonade by responding to threat in ways that increase\nboth personal and relationship well-being.\nNotes\n1. The alpha for this variable and for the composite measure of\nmovement toward/away from the partner fell just short of the\ntypical cutoff criteria of .70. However, both were, in fact, very\nclose to .70. It is likely that these alphas fell slightly short of\n.70 because the scales were created by combining very few\nitems (two items in the case of self-conscious emotions and\nthree items in the case of movement toward/away from the\npartner).\n2. The low correlation between these two measures was not\nentirely unexpected given that one was implicit and the other\nwas explicit (which are often weakly correlated). However, the\ntwo variables together provide a better opportunity to capture\nvariance in internalization. It is important to note that analyses\nconducted on the individual items and on the composite vari-\nable yield the same general pattern of findings and the same\nconclusions. However, the statistical results were slightly\nstronger with the more robust composite than with the indi-\nvidual items. Thus, our decision to combine items does not\nalter the findings.\n3. As with the internalization composite, it is important to note\nthat analyses conducted on the individual items for the com-\nposite measure of movement toward/away from the partner\nyield the same general pattern of findings and the same con-\nclusions. Thus, our decision to combine items does not alter\nthe findings.\n4. We conducted this test using the PROCESS macro in SPSS\nsamples. Bootstrap mediation tests are preferred over other\nmethods because they do not assume a normal sampling distri-\nbution of the indirect effects (Preacher & Hayes, 2008).\n5. It should be noted that we also included negatively valenced\nitems assessing ratings of partner traits and predictions for the\nfuture. However, positive and negative items loaded on sepa-\nrate factors and there were no significant findings for negative\nitems. It seems that relative to those with positive self-models\nthose with negative self-models were willing to endorse less\npositive partner traits and less optimistic relationship predic-\ntions following rejection. However, they were not willing to\ngo so far as to endorse more unambiguously negative partner\ntraits and pessimistic relationship predictions.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAiken, L.
