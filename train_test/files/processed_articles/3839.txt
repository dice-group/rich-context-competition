However, the mechanisms underlying the relationships between the acute and long-term\nbenefits of resistance exercise on BCRL are not well understood. Purpose. To examine the acute inflammatory response to\nupper-body resistance exercise in women with BCRL and to compare these effects between resistance exercises involving\nlow, moderate, and high loads. The impact on lymphedema status and associated symptoms was also compared. Methods.\nA total of 21 women, 62 \u00b1 10 years old, with BCRL participated in the study. Participants completed low-load (15-20\nrepetition maximum [RM]), moderate-load (10-12 RM), and high-load (6-8 RM) exercise sessions consisting of 3 sets of 6\nupper-body resistance exercises. Sessions were completed in a randomized order separated by a 7- to 10-day wash-out\nperiod. Venous blood samples were obtained to assess markers of exercise-induced muscle damage and inflammation.\nLymphedema status was assessed using bioimpedance spectroscopy and arm circumferences, and associated symptoms\nwere assessed using Visual Analogue Scales for pain, heaviness, and tightness. Measurements were conducted before and\n24 hours after the exercise sessions. Results. No significant changes in creatine kinase, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and\ntumor necrosis factor- were observed following the 3 resistance exercise sessions. There were no significant changes in\narm swelling or symptom severity scores across the 3 resistance exercise conditions. Conclusions. The magnitude of acute\nexercise-induced inflammation following upper-body resistance exercise in women with BCRL does not vary between\nresistance exercise loads.\n",

In addition, the mechanisms underlying the rela-\ntionships between the acute and long-term benefits of resis-\ntance exercise and BCRL are not well understood.\nSingle bouts of resistance exercise elicit muscle tissue\ndamage and an acute inflammatory response.10-12 The extent\nof this response is affected by the mode (eccentric and/or\nconcentric muscular contractions), volume (total work of\nthe session), load (weight lifted), and intensity (extent of\nneuromuscular fatigue) of resistance exercise.13-15 High-\nvolume and eccentric resistance exercise causes a greater\nmagnitude of exercise-induced muscle damage and inflam-\nsient increase in creatine kinase (CK) and inflammatory\nbiomarkers (eg, interleukin-6 [IL-6], tumor necrosis factor\n [TNF-], and C-reactive protein [CRP]) up to 72 hours\npostexercise.11,20-24 Whereas single bouts of resistance exer-\ncise cause increases in these biomarkers, chronic adaptation\nto regular exercise has an anti-inflammatory effect associ-\nated with downregulation of various inflammatory bio-\nresting levels of inflammatory biomarkers. The acute\ninflammatory response to resistance exercise has been\nreported in healthy trained and untrained individuals14 but\nhas yet to be examined in women with BCRL who have\ncompromised lymphatic system function. There is a percep-\ntion among health professionals and patients that if resis-\ntance exercise is conducted it should be prescribed at light\nloads. This perception is based on the assumption (yet to be\nempirically evaluated) that lighter loads elicit a lower\ninflammatory response in women with BCRL. However, it\nhas been reported that at least in young healthy men, there\nare no differences to the response of CK, IL-6, or TNF- 24\nhours after upper-body resistance exercise at 4 different\nloads (ranging from 50% to 110% of maximal muscular\nstrength; ie, 1 repetition maximum [RM]).29 At present, it is\nunknown if the impaired lymphatic system of women with\nBCRL prompts a different inflammatory response to vary-\ning loads of resistance exercise. The response may differ\nfrom that in healthy adults because the lymphatic system is\nimplicated in cytokine production and removal. It is sug-\ngested that in addition to the blood, cytokines may also\nenter the lymph fluid, which can modify plasma cytokine\nlevels.30 Furthermore, lymphatic fluid passes through lymph\nnodes, a site where immune cells are removed. As a result,\ncytokine production may be modulated when components\nof damaged muscle pass through lymph nodes.30 However,\nit is unknown whether the excision of lymph nodes and\nlymphatic fluid accumulation in BCRL may alter the\ninflammatory response to exercise.\nWomen who develop BCRL experience impairment\nwithin the lymphatic system, resulting in reduced or stag-\nnant flow of lymph fluid.31,32 As a result of lymph stasis,\nfibrosis, fat accumulation, and inflammation occur within\nthe affected limb.33 This impaired lymph flow results in the\nbuildup of protein-rich fluid, which is associated with\ninflammation in the lymphadetamous limb.33-35 Ongoing\nand worsening inflammatory processes of the skin, subcuta-\nneous tissue, and lymphatic system also occur.36 As a result\nof the pathological changes in the affected limb, it is plau-\nsible that the normal inflammatory response to a bout of\nupper-body resistance exercise is exacerbated or at least\naltered in patients with BCRL. This may have important\nimplications in understanding the pathophysiology, upper-\nlimb rehabilitation, and prescription of optimal resistance\nexercise loads for women with BCRL. Therefore, the aim of\nthe present study was to examine the acute inflammatory\nresponses to resistance exercise in women with BCRL.\nMarkers of exercise-induced muscle damage and inflamma-\ntion (CK, CRP, IL-6, and TNF-) in women with unilateral\nBCRL were evaluated after performing acute bouts of low-,\nmoderate-, and high-load upper-body resistance exercises.\nThe impact on lymphedema status and associated symp-\ntoms (pain, heaviness, and tightness) were also assessed.\nMethods\nParticipants\nA total of 126 women with BCRL were screened for partici-\npation in this study between August 2011 and February\n2012 (Figure 1). Potential participants were identified\nthrough referral from oncologists or physiotherapists and\nexisting databases of the investigators. A total of 25 women\nwere enrolled to participate. To be eligible, participants had\nto have had a histological diagnosis of breast cancer and a\nclinical diagnosis of unilateral BCRL defined as: (1) an\nimpedance ratio of at least 3 standard deviations (SDs)\ngreater than normative data;37,38 (2) a volume difference\nbetween affected and unaffected limbs of at least 5%;38,39\nand (3) a difference in circumference between affected and\nfrom participation if they had unstable lymphedema, which\nwas defined as receiving intensive therapy (ie, decongestive\ntherapy or antibiotics for infection) within the previous 3\nmonths. Any potential participants were also excluded if\nthey had a musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and/or neuro-\nlogical disorder that could inhibit them or place them at risk\nof harm from exercising, as determined by their general\nphysician. This study was approved by the university's\nhuman research ethics committee, and all participants pro-\nvided written informed consent.\nExperimental Design\nA randomized, cross-over design was implemented in which\nparticipants completed 3 experimental conditions separated\nby a wash-out period of at least 1 week. Prior to any experi-\nmental conditions, all participants completed a series of 4\nfamiliarization sessions implemented twice weekly for a\nfortnight. These sessions involved familiarizing participants\nwith the resistance exercises and loads performed during the\nexperimental conditions. The experimental conditions\ninvolved an upper-body resistance exercise session under-\ntaken using: (1) low load; (2) moderate load; or (3) high\nload. Sessions were completed in a randomized order as\ndetermined by a random assignment computer program. A\nseries of assessments were conducted immediately prior to\nand 24 hours after each of the experimental conditions.\nInstructions were provided to all participants to maintain\ntheir normal lymphedema management strategies through-\nout the duration of the study. Additionally, participants were\ninstructed to maintain their standard diet and physical activ-\nity levels throughout the study period.\nResistance Exercise Sessions\nEach of the experimental sessions involved a series of 6\nstandard resistance exercises targeting all the major muscle\ngroups in the upper body. Specifically, the exercises\nFigure 1. Flow of participants throughout trial.\nincluded the chest press, lat pull-down, bicep curl, triceps\nextension, lateral raise, and wrist curl. Three sets of each\nexercise were performed in each session, whereas the load\nlifted and number of repetitions completed in each set dif-\nfered between the 3 experimental conditions. The low-load\ntrial involved sets of 15 to 20 RM (ie, load corresponding to\nthe maximum weight that could be lifted 15-20 times). The\nmoderate-load trial involved sets of 10 to 12 RM. The high-\nload trial involved sets of 6 to 8 RM. These RM ranges were\nto 85% of the 1 RM (ie, maximal strength), respectively.40\nThese loading protocols have been shown to be safe for\nwomen with BCRL3,4 and are consistent with common\nresistance exercise prescriptions used in clinical practice.41\nThe participant's perception of exertion associated with\neach of the experimental conditions was assessed using the\nRating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) Scale, which quantifies\nthe difficulty of the exercise session on a scale from 6 (no\nexertion at all) to 20 (maximal exertion).42 Perceived toler-\nance of each exercise session was assessed using a 7-point\nLikert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7\n(strongly agree) in response to the statement, \"I have found\nthe exercise session to be tolerable.\" All exercise sessions\nwere supervised by an accredited exercise physiologist.\nInflammatory Markers\nVenous blood samples were collected from the nonaffected\narm by a qualified phlebotomist immediately prior to and\n24 hours following the exercise sessions. Because of risk\nreduction guidelines among this cohort (ie, guidelines to\nminimize injections to the hand and arm), we aimed to min-\nimize patient burden by allowing 24 hours between blood\nwithdrawals. This sampling time point (24 hours) also\nallowed us to determine whether a robust and sustained\ninflammatory response was induced by exercise. Samples\nwere assessed for CK, CRP, IL-6, and TNF- using stan-\ndard techniques. CK was assessed by a commercial pathol-\nogy laboratory using the ADVIA Chemistry System\n(Western Diagnostics, Perth, Western Australia). The assay\nsensitivity was <1 U/L, and the precision (coefficient of\nvariation) was 1.5%. CRP, IL-6, and TNF- were assessed\nusing multiplex bead-based immunoassays on the Luminex\nplatform (Luminex, Austin, TX). Assays were conducted\nusing magnetic multiplex kits in accordance with manufac-\nturer's protocol (Merck Millipore, St Charles, MO). The\nand 0.23 pg/mL for TNF-. The precision was 8.8% for\nCRP and IL-6 and 6.6% for TNF-.\nLymphedema Status and Associated Symptoms\nThe extent of swelling was determined by 2 independent\ntechniques: bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) and arm\ncircumferences. In accordance with the manufacturer's\nguidelines for the BIS device (ImpediMed IMPTM DF50;\nImpediMed, San Diego, CA), the impedance of the extracel-\nlular fluid in the affected and nonaffected arms was assessed\nusing a range of frequencies and compared to produce a\nL-Dex score.37 Regional arm circumferences of the affected\nand nonaffected arms were assessed according to established\nprotocols.38,43 The participant was seated with the arm\nabducted at 90\u00b0; a constant tension tape was used to measure\ncircumferences immediately distal to the metacarpal-pha-\nlangeal joint and at 5-cm intervals to the base of the axilla.\nArm circumference swelling was reported as the percentage\ndifference in total circumference between the affected and\nnonaffected arms. The severity of lymphedema symptoms\nwas assessed using Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) for pain,\nheaviness, and tightness.44 The scales ranged from 0 (no dis-\ncomfort) to 10 (worst imaginable), and participants rated\nboth the affected and nonaffected arms.\nStatistical Analyses\nSummary descriptive statistics for participants' characteris-\ntics included counts (and percentages) for categorical vari-\nables and means \u00b1 SDs or medians, minimum, and\nmaximum for continuous variables. Generalized estimating\nequations (GEEs) were used to model continuous primary\noutcomes (CK, CRP, TNF-, and IL-6) to determine time\n(pre-exercise and 24-hours postexercise) and trial (low-,\nmoderate-, and high-load) effects and Time \u00d7 Trial interac-\ntions. GEEs were considered the most appropriate multi-\nvariate modeling technique. In comparison to conventional\nrepeated-measure techniques, GEEs incorporate all avail-\nable data (including from participants with missing data at\nvarious time points). Secondary outcomes (lymphedema\nstatus and associated symptoms) were analyzed using\nrepeated-measures analysis of variance. All tests were\n2-tailed, with an  level of P  .05 as the criterion for statis-\ntical significance. No imputation of data was generated.\nData were analyzed using SPSS Statistics for Windows,\nVersion 21 (IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL).\nResults\nParticipant Characteristics\nParticipants were on average 61.5 years old and had had\nlymphedema for an average of 9 years (Table 1). Most par-\nticipants were either overweight or obese (91%) as deter-\nmined by body mass index and had undergone previous\nsurgery (96%), with an average of 17 lymph nodes removed.\nBetween 60% and 80% of participants had had previous\nradiotherapy and/or chemotherapy or were currently and/or\npreviously taking hormone therapy. According to the\nAmerican Physical Therapy Association lymphedema\nmoderate, and severe lymphedema, respectively. Most par-\nticipants (86%) self-reported being physically active prior\nto study participation. All participants maintained their\nusual lymphedema self-care management, physical activ-\nity, and diet behaviors for the duration of the study. One\nparticipant completed only the low-load trial and withdrew\nfrom the study as a result of a change in work commit-\nments, whereas another participant did not complete the\nmoderate-load trial (because of unrelated health concerns).\nThree participants did not complete the 24-hour assessment\nafter moderate-load resistance exercise. It was also not pos-\nsible to perform the BIS assessments on 1 participant.\nResistance Exercise Sessions\nMean ratings of perceived exertion for the 3 exercise condi-\ntions were similar. The participants rated the exercise ses-\nsions between \"light\" and \"somewhat hard\" (Table 2).\nParticipants rated the 3 exercise conditions as equally toler-\nable (Table 2). The load lifted across all 6 exercises differed\nsignificantly between the 3 exercise conditions (low load =\n\u00b1 650 kg in the high-load trial. There were no adverse\nevents during participation in the resistance exercise ses-\nsions, including no exacerbations of lymphedema or symp-\ntom severity.\nInflammatory Markers\nThere was no significant interaction effect between time\nand trial for CK, CRP, IL-6, and TNF- (Table 3,\nSupplementary Table [available at http://ict.sagepub.com/\nsupplemental]). There was a trend for CK to increase (non-\nsignificantly) 24 hours after each of the 3 exercise condi-\ntions, with no significant differences between the low-,\nmoderate-, and high-load conditions. There were no clear\ntrends in terms of the impact of resistance exercise load on\nCRP, IL-6, or TNF- from pre-exercise to 24 hours postex-\nercise in any of the 3 conditions. Individual responses var-\nied markedly from no change to increases and/or reductions\nin CK, CRP, TNF-, and IL-6 (Figure 2).\nLymphedema Status and Associated Symptoms\nNo significant increases were observed in BIS or interlimb\ncircumference difference at any time point during the 3\nexercise conditions (Table 4). BIS scores and interlimb cir-\ncumference differences generally tended to decrease at 24\nhours after exercise in all 3 conditions. Circumference dif-\nference decreased significantly 24 hours after low-load\nresistance exercise (P = .02). There was no worsening of\nsymptom severity of the affected arm at any time through-\nout the study. Tightness ratings of the affected arm decreased\nsignificantly 24 hours after the high-load trial (P = .015).\nDiscussion\nThe main findings of this study were the following: (1) no\nsignificant changes in indicators of muscle damage or\nTable 1.

There is a perception that\nlighter-load resistance training will produce less muscle dam-\nage and inflammation compared with higher-load resistance\ntraining (eg, large increases in CK have been observed after\nstrenuous exercise46), and there are concerns that the inflam-\nmation would exacerbate BCRL as a result of impaired lymph\nflow. Furthermore, there are concerns that resistance exercise\nwith heavy loads may exacerbate lymphedema symptoms,\nand women with BCRL are typically apprehensive about lift-\ning weights, especially at heavier loads.7 However, participa-\ntion in an acute high-load resistance exercise session has\nrecently been demonstrated to not acutely increase swelling or\nsymptom severity of the affected limb in women with BCRL.3\nImportantly, the current study extends these previous observa-\ntions to indicate that there may be no difference in the inflam-\nmatory response 24 hours following participation in acute\nbouts of resistance exercise involving low, moderate, or high\nloads. Because inflammatory markers returned to normal\nwithin 24 hours, there is little evidence that any clinically\nimportant inflammation occurred. However, it is important to\nnote that these are preliminary observations based on a small\nsample of patients who were relatively active. Higher-load\nresistance exercise is known to stimulate greater morphologi-\ncal and neural adaptations compared with lower loads.41,47,49\nAs such, these preliminary findings suggest that women with\nBCRL can safely participate in moderate- to high-load resis-\ntance exercise.\nResistance training\u00adinduced muscle damage and subse-\nquent inflammatory responses are mediated by a range of\nindividual and training program variables.14,15 In the current\nstudy, increasing the load of resistance exercise did not elicit\na significantly greater inflammatory response. Similarly, pre-\nvious findings suggest that the load of upper-body resistance\nexercise may not affect the magnitude of change in blood\nmarkers of muscle damage and inflammation. Uchida et al29\ncompared 4 different loads of upper-body resistance exercise\ntory biomarkers, including CK, IL-6, and TNF- in physi-\ncally trained men. Regardless of the loading protocol, no\nchanges in IL-6 or TNF- were observed 24 hours after exer-\ncise. Uchida et al29 reported significant increases in CK 24\nhours after each exercise trial; however, no difference was\nobserved between the different loading protocols in the mag-\nnitude of CK change.29 Although there were clear differences\nin the participants sampled, exercise protocols, blood sam-\npling, and measurement techniques between the previous and\ncurrent studies, the findings were consistent. These initial\nfindings suggest that BCRL and its associated pathology do\nnot alter acute inflammatory response in the 24 hours follow-\ning low-, moderate-, and high-load resistance exercise.\nAlthough more than half of the participants had chronic\nlymphedema (present for on average 9 years), our findings\nsuggest that symptom severity may still acutely improve\nwith appropriately prescribed resistance exercise. Consistent\nwith previous findings,50 a significant reduction in tightness\nof the affected arm was observed 24 hours after a high-load\nresistance exercise session. The possible mechanisms of\nsuch benefit are unknown, but it could be speculated that\nmore effective hydrostatic pressure drove lymph return with\nmore forceful muscle actions. In addition, more forceful\nmuscle actions may result in favorable hormone and cyto-\nkine production, affecting the tissue locally and systemi-\ncally. The observation that high-load resistance exercise did\nnot induce significantly greater exercise-induced muscle\ndamage or inflammation in the present study is supported by\nthe subjective improvements in symptom severity of the\naffected limb 24 hours after exercise. It is also important to\nconsider that although many of the participants in the study\nwere not accustomed to performing regular resistance exer-\ncise, participants were generally physically active and had\nundergone a 2-week familiarization protocol. Regular exer-\ncise may cause a cumulative anti-inflammatory effect in\nresponse to repeated bouts of exercise.25,51 Participants were\nlikely accustomed to physical activity (albeit not resistance\nexercise in particular); therefore, these findings may not rep-\nresent the acute inflammatory response of sedentary or less\nphysically active women with BCRL. However, previous\nresearch in healthy individuals indicates that even a single\nbout of eccentric exercise results in considerable protection\nfrom muscle damage in subsequent training sessions.30\nThis is the first study to our knowledge that has com-\npared whether resistance exercise load influences the exer-\ncise-induced inflammatory response and the potential\nimplications this may have for women with BCRL. We\nexamined various markers of exercise-induced muscle\ndamage and inflammation in response to varying exercise\nloads. Importantly, all levels of loading (low, moderate,\nand high) were equally tolerable in this sample of women\nwith BCRL. Nevertheless, our study was subject to several\nlimitations that are worthy of comment. First, our study\nwas limited by a relatively small sample size, which may\nlimit our ability to detect statistically significant differ-\nences. Second, blood samples were only assessed 24 hours\npostexercise. As a result, we cannot discount that the lack\nof significant increase or difference among the 3 exercise\nbouts may be a result of the clearance of cytokines prior to\nblood withdrawal.Although more frequent sampling would\nhave been preferable to demonstrate changes in cytokines\nfollowing resistance exercise (eg, Izquierdo et al19), 24\nhours between blood samples was selected to alleviate\npatient concerns and burden among patients with BCRL.\nAdditionally, systemic biomarkers were assessed, and it is\nacknowledged that local responses within skeletal muscle\nmay differ.\nFindings from the present study add to the existing body\nof knowledge by establishing that acute bouts of moderate-\nand high-load resistance exercise may not induce a greater\nlevel of muscle damage or inflammation compared with\nlow-load resistance exercise in breast cancer survivors who\nhave established lymphedema. This extends previous\nresearch demonstrating that high-load resistance exercise\ndoes not exacerbate lymphedema or associated symptoms of\nthe affected limb.3,4 Data from this present study may inform\nfuture exercise intervention studies, and given the greater\ntime efficiency and strength adaptation resulting from mod-\nerate- to high-load resistance training,41 the efficacy of low-\nload resistance exercise appears limited.41 It is well\nestablished that a strong dose-response relationship exists\nwith resistance exercise load.41 Greater improvements in\nmuscle strength and hypertrophy, physical function, and\nhealth-related quality of life are experienced with higher\nParticipants reported the same tolerability and RPE regard-\nless of load, further supporting the potential appropriateness\nof moderate to high loads for this population. Because regu-\nlar exercise has been shown to reduce resting levels of\ninflammatory cytokines in breast cancer survivors without\nlymphedema,51 future studies should aim to examine changes\nin chronic low-grade inflammation with longer-term (eg,\n12 weeks) exercise in women with BCRL.\nConclusions\nAs research continues to emerge demonstrating the safety\nand efficacy of resistance exercise in women with BCRL,\nthere remains a limited amount of research investigating\nthe physiological responses underlying these benefits.\nFindings from the current exploratory study demonstrate\nthat the magnitude of exercise-induced muscle damage\nand inflammation following upper-body resistance exer-\ncise in women with BCRL may not be dependent on the\nload of resistance exercise and that low-, moderate-, and\nhigh-load upper-body resistance exercise may not result in\na greater 24-hour inflammatory response in individuals\nwith impaired lymph flow in the upper limb. Lymphedema\nstatus and symptom severity as well as perceived tolera-\nbility and exertion of resistance exercise were also not\naffected by the load lifted. Given the extensive evidence\nthat moderate to high loads in resistance training produce\ngreater strength and morphological adaptations as well as\nphysical function and health-related quality of life com-\nport for the prescription of moderate- to high-load exercise\nfor women with BCRL.\n"
