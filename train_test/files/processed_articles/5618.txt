Copping1, Anne Campbell1, Steven Muncer2, and George B. Richardson3\n Keywords\nlife history strategy, psychometrics, methodology, K factor, evolutionary psychology\nFigueredo et al. (2015) commented on Copping, Campbell, and\nMuncer's (2014a) critical examination of psychometric assess-\nment techniques used in the evaluation of human life history\n(LH) strategies. We welcome the debate that our article has\nstimulated because only through informed and rational dialo-\ngue does a field progress. We have structured our response by\nfirst summarizing the aims and findings of our original submis-\nsion and answering some specific criticisms raised by Figuer-\nedo et al. We then raise issues regarding the specification of\nsuper factors and their underlying rationale. Finally, we raise a\nnumber of statistical issues that we consider to be pertinent to\npsychometric LH batteries.\nThe Original Study\nIn our original study (Copping, Campbell, & Muncer, 2014a),\nwe examined the structure of the High-K Strategy Scale\n(HKSS; Giosan, 2006), a psychometric index of slow LH strat-\negy, in relation to key life events (pubertal onset, sexual onset,\nand number of sexual partners) in order to validate the instru-\nment's suitability for use in LH research. Analysis suggested\nthat the HKSS did not measure a single, unidimensional con-\nstruct as represented in the original conceptualization (Giosan,\n2006). A single-factor model did not show a good statistical fit\nto the data set (based on a sample of over 800 individuals\nrecruited via a newspaper), and we proposed instead a model\nthat afforded greater statistical parsimony, while retaining con-\nceptual integrity. Decomposing the scale into four domain-\nspecific facets appeared to provide the best conceptual and\nstatistical fit to the data. Several findings emerged that were\ncontrary to LH predictions (although they were consistent with\nevolutionary predictions), and clear sex differences were evi-\ndent in the data set. We raised concerns about amalgamating\nlifestyle, personality, and behavioral items into a single scale as\nan effective measure of LH strategy and called for further work\nto clarify the underlying nature of psychometric constructs\nused in LH research. We highlighted the need to analyze data\nby sex, culture, and social class in order to more clearly exam-\nine LH strategies.\n1 Durham University, Durham, United Kingdom\n2 University of Teesside, Middlesbrough, United Kingdom\n3 University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLee T.

Such an analysis allows the scale to be evaluated against\nrecognized psychometric indices and means that potential\nitem and structural misspecifications can be identified in\nadvance. Indeed, at the time of writing, 12 published studies\nusing the HKSS had already been conducted on the assump-\ntion that the measure was valid. Had a validation study been\nconducted previously, one wonders if so many researchers\nwould have used this measure. It is important that detailed\npsychometric work is conducted to validate scales in any\ndiscipline before mainstream use.\nGiven the similar theoretical and empirical basis between\nthe HKSS and other psychometric measures of LH, we tenta-\ntively suggested that several of our findings might extend to the\ngrowing assortment of psychometric LH indicators. Figuere-\ndo's laboratory alone has generated at least five measures of\nLH strategy: the Arizona Life History Battery (ALHB), the\nMini-K (a short form of ALHB), Super-K (composed of ALHB\n\u00fe Covitality \u00fe General Factor of Personality [GFP]), Super-\nK1 (Mini-K \u00fe GFP \u00fe Mate Value), and Super-K2 (Mini-K \u00fe\nGFP \u00fe Mate Value Inventory \u00fe Mating Effort Scale \u00fe Inten-\ntions Towards Infidelity Scale \u00fe Self-Monitoring Scale).\nThese are described in Figueredo, Vasquez, Brumbach, and\nSchneider, (2007) and Olderbak, Gladden, Wolf, and Figuer-\nedo (2014) and are not inclusive of all variants of so-called K\nfactors. Figueredo et al.'s response to our article refers, at\ndifferent points, to these various inventories. To our knowl-\nedge, no detailed, item-level analysis or confirmatory factor\nanalysis (CFA) of the ALHB or the Mini-K has been published\nthat (a) clearly shows that its structure is unidimensional and\n(b) shows consistent relationships with known behavioral indi-\ncators of LH theory.\nTo clarify, we do not necessarily dispute the theoretical\nrationales for selecting many of the variables in these scales.\nResearch consistently shows that factors such as parental\nattachments, risk taking, and impulsivity are important factors\nassociated with strategy trajectory (Belsky, Steinberg, &\nFigueredo, Brumbach, & Schlomer, 2009; Richardson &\nHardesty, 2012). What needs to be considered more carefully\nis the utility of aggregating various domain-specific factors into\none domain-general measure.\nBiometric and Psychometric Indicators--A False\nDichotomy\nIn their critique, Figueredo et al. (2015) incorrectly assert that\nwe consider biometric measures preferable to psychometric\nindicators (p. 302). No claim regarding the superiority of bio-\nmetric/anthropometric to psychometric indicators was made,\nnor did we propose a dichotomy between them. Our point was\nthat researchers should employ both types of measures in order\nto examine the relationships between the two. Hence, in sug-\ngesting that, ``LH researchers embrace a position where both\nmeasures are incorporated into a more inclusive set of mea-\nsurement and structural models'' (p. 302), they concur exactly\nwith our proposal. The thrust of our argument was that the\nscales included on measures such as the ALHB (e.g., Insight,\nplanning and control; Religiosity; Mother/father relationship\nquality) do not assess LH strategy as it is usually understood\nbut rather represent variables that may predict or mediate LH\ntrajectory (e.g., earlier reproduction, more sexual partners,\nlower parental investment). Furthermore, as shown in Figure 1,\nthe summing of these different characteristics (traits, relation-\nships, and lifestyles) to produce a composite score makes it\nimpossible to examine the relationships between them. As\nevolutionary psychologists, we believe our role is to identify\nthe psychological pathways through which environmental\nstress and resource scarcity ultimately impact upon LH tempo.\nFigure 1 represents a highly simplified hypothesis about how\nthis might happen, showing only unidirectional causal relation-\nships. Personality traits may act as moderators or mediators of\nthe relationship between early experience and LH tempo. Or\nA. Early\nenvironment C. Specific\npersonality\ntraits (e.g.\nimpulsivity)\nD.

Simplified illustration of associations between some concepts discussed in the article. Psychometric inventories of life history such as\nArizona Life History Battery, Mini-K, and Super-K produce a score based on items assessing A, B, C, and D making it impossible to establish the\nmediating, moderating, or causal relationships between these variables. Because these inventories do not examine associations with E, it is\nunclear whether their model is a life history model as understood in evolutionary theory.\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nthey may be by-products of early experience that are not\ncausally related to outcomes. Or the associations between\npersonality and outcomes may be no more than common\ngenetic effects.\nWe believe that these are important questions but, following\nFigueredo et al.'s (2015) reply, we are not much clearer on their\nposition. Not only do they accept that their global inventories\n``are relatively agnostic with respect to possible causal rela-\ntions among its various components'' (p. 314), but they regard\nour suggestion of a possible causal relationship (usually called\na hypothesis) as impertinent (``the authors of the critique appar-\nently presume to know which of the various LH traits being\nmeasured are causal to the others. To a philosopher of science,\nthis degree of confidence would appear remarkable,'' p. 314).\nElsewhere, they hedge their bets by noting a bidirectional\nrelationship between biometric and psychosocial traits\n(p. 305) and by supporting a developmentally contingent\nmodel while citing genetic correlations between indicators\nLH theory was born out of comparative biological measures\nthat the field of human LHs in particular has moved on sub-\nstantially from earlier incarnations, ignoring markers of repro-\nductive fitness essentially ignores the fundamental principle of\nLH theory which is about the allocation of effort between key\nbiological tasks (e.g., growth and reproduction) that translates\nultimately into lineage continuation. If we fail to measure key\nlife events and instead restrict our measurement to domains\nsuch as personal relationships, religiosity, and self-control (as\nin the ALHB), we are not measuring LHs but lifestyles. Psy-\nchological mechanisms are doubtlessly important in the devel-\nopment of LHs in humans, and a corpus of literature supports\nwhich particular psychological mechanisms are important to\ndifferent strategies is equally vital. If the purpose of a func-\ntional psychological adaptation is to increase the probability of\nreproductive success, such mechanisms should be demonstra-\nbly related to biological indices of that goal. If this is not the\ncase, how can any psychological mechanism be truly called an\nadaptation? Figueredo et al. make the distinction between the\n``means [functional processes] and ends [distal achievements]\nprocess that would only highlight the ends (fitness outcomes).\nAs clearly noted originally however (Copping et al., 2014a,\np. 217), most researchers in the modern evolutionary sciences\ndo not advocate for a purely ``counting babies'' approach nor\nfocus purely on fitness maximization (Nettle, Gibson, Lawson,\n& Sear, 2013). We are as interested in the means as well as the\nends when it comes to strategy development, but in particular,\nhow the means facilitate the ends. To achieve this goal, what is\nneeded is a closer examination of biological indicators in rela-\ntion to environmental context and psychological, cognitive,\nand behavioral data. After all, how can the validity of processes\nor means that are hypothesized to be driving strategy be\nevaluated without reference to the fitness outcomes or ends\nin which we believe they result?\nFast LH Strategies\nIn their critique, Figueredo et al. explicitly state that ``faster LH\nstrategists should invest more energy in reproductive effort,\ndisagree with this as a key characterization of faster LHs. For\nthis reason, we (Copping et al., 2014a) deliberately picked 3\nitems considered to be indicative of a faster LH strategy and\ngreater mating effort: accelerated development (i.e., earlier\npubertal onset), earlier age of reproductive onset, and greater\nnumbers of sexual partners. These three variables are widely\nacknowledged as indicators of the pursuit of faster strategies,\nand it is not by chance that these particular variables (or their\nequivalents) feature heavily in many studies exploring human\nGriskevicius, Kuo, Sung, & Collins, 2012). These measures\nare theoretically appropriate criteria for examining the validity\nof a measure that proposes to index psychological correlates of\nfast and slow LH strategies.\nFigueredo et al. propose that, due to cultural developments\nand ecological constraints associated with Western, Economic,\nIndustrial, Rich, and Democratic societies, ``we should not\nnecessarily expect that the main effects of LH indicators like\nthe Mini-K or the HKSS will be statistically significant or very\nlarge in magnitude when predicting such fitness outcomes.'' If\nfitness outcomes are not associated with LH indicators, surely\nit raises grave questions either about the relevance of LH theory\nto an explanation of contemporary western human behavior or\nabout the validity of LH indicators. Remaining with Figueredo\net al.'s example of mating effort, research generally shows that\nattitudes, desires, and beliefs about mating tend to correlate\nsignificantly with actual mating behaviors on a population level\nSimpson & Gangestad, 1991). A similar case could be made\nfor other behaviors consistent with fast strategies such as\naggression (Archer & Graham-Kevan, 2003; Huesmann &\nGuerra, 1997). If beliefs and intentions toward a given behavior\ncorrelate with the same behavior, then we would expect an\ninventory focusing on processes calibrated toward increased\nmating effort to be related to actual mating effort. Thus, an\nindex of fast LH strategy should correlate substantially and\nin the expected direction with measures of mating behavior\nand aggression (or other indices of fast strategy execution) at\nthe population level. Although several relationships in our\nstudy corroborated predictions made from evolutionary theory,\na unitary K dimension was not apparent in this data set.\nLH indicators should show some relationship to behaviors\nconsistent with the execution of the strategies they purport to\nmeasure. Indeed, in studies that do not use aggregated psycho-\nmetric indices (and instead measure specific ecological, psy-\nchological, biological, or behavioral factors), the expected\nCopping et al. 3\nteries often fail to find the expected relationships. If specific\nvariables predict strategy patterns in the real world, what is the\nvalue of aggregating them in such a way as to mask these\nrelationships? For instance, the relationships of the ALHB with\nsocially antagonistic attitudes and socially antagonistic beha-\nviors were not significant (r \u00bc \u00c0.12 and \u00c0.07, respectively;\nWenner, Bianchi, Figueredo, Rushton, & Jacobs, 2013). Old-\nerbak and Figueredo (2012) reported the relationship between\nthe Mini-K and mating effort as r \u00bc \u00c0.03. Olderbak et al.\n(2014) found that mating effort was not significantly related\nto the ALHB (r \u00bc .05), the Mini-K (r \u00bc .12) or the HKSS (r \u00bc\nstructural model that mating effort and aggression were both\nsubsumed by another latent dimension named ``Psychopathic\nand aggressive attitudes'' which was not directly related to\nslow LH strategy. When developmental trajectory is factored\nin, the singular dimension of the K strategy is also question-\nable. Brumbach, Figueredo, and Ellis (2009) concluded that\nslow LH and social deviance were separate dimensions in ado-\nlescence and young adulthood, suggesting that a singular LH\ndimension may not emerge until later adulthood. Similar find-\nings were made by Richardson, Chen, Dai, Hardesty, and Swo-\nboda (2014) and have recently been corroborated (Richardson,\nDariotis, & Lai, in press; Richardson et al., in press). It is clear\nthat the relationship between indices of mating effort, compe-\ntition, and LH strategy is more complex than a single dimen-\nsional approach would have us believe.\nOther studies have shown that mating effort does tend to\nload negatively on K (albeit weakly) when a higher order super\nfactor (Super-K) is employed (Olderbak & Figueredo, 2012;\nOlderbak, Gladden, Wolf, & Figueredo, 2014). As the nomo-\nlogical net is widened, other factors inevitably begin to be\nincluded through their relationships with other variables such\nas life expectancy (which has strong links to aggression and\nreproduction: Chisholm, Quinlivan, Petersen, & Coall, 2005;\nDuRant, Cadenhead, Pendergrast, Slavens, & Linder, 1994;\nWilson & Daly, 1997), intelligence, personality, and beyond\nrelationship between mating effort and the Super-K remains the\nweakest link (Olderbak & Figueredo, 2012; Olderbak et al.,\n2014). This is puzzling when one considers the ultimate func-\ntion of a LH strategy is to facilitate reproductive ends.\nThe super factor aside (which we return to later), the purpose\nof the original study was to validate a specific measure; the\nHKSS. From the point of validating it against indices of mating\neffort consistent with a fast LH strategy, it would appear that the\nHKSS does not work as predicted. Alternatives (such as the\nMini-K or ALHB), used as stand-alone instruments or as part of\na larger super structure, do not appear to consistently demonstrate\npredictedrelationshipswithotherindicesoffastLHstrategy.This\nraises questions about what some of these psychometric invento-\nries actually measure and thus their validity.\nThe Environment\nAs advocates of plasticity throughout development (West-\nEberhard, 2003), we acknowledge the pivotal role of the early\nenvironment in the development of LH trajectories. Much of\nour previous work emphasizes this point (e.g., Copping &\n2009) of key environmental factors that predict levels of crime,\naggression, teenage pregnancy, and short-term mating orienta-\ntion. The wider developmental environment is indeed of para-\nmount importance. However, accurate measurement of the\nwider environment is difficult, even more so if assessed retro-\nspectively. In the absence of a well-validated, easy to admin-\nister questionnaire that accurately captures the developmental\nenvironment, many researchers are unable to examine the prox-\nimate causal factors of LH strategies. Although measuring the\nenvironment is easier said than done, some notable attempts\nson et al., 2012). Despite Figueredo et al.'s emphasis on the\nimportance of the early environment, many studies using the\nHKSS, ALHB, or the Mini-K do not assess it. Although the\nALHB asks questions regarding the quality of childhood rela-\ntionships with parents (an indication of developmental stabi-\nlity), it does not go beyond this. However, theory and research\nindicate that stress, uncertainty, and unpredictability are trans-\nmitted not just via the immediate familial environment (Cop-\nin complex ways in relation to strategy-related variables\n(Richardson, Chen, Dai, Hardesty, and Swoboda, 2014;\nRichardson et al., in press). Factors such as local morbidity,\nextrinsic mortality, unemployment, resource scarcity, mobility,\nand socioeconomic status have been suggested as being pivotal\nto strategy formation (see Ellis, Schlomer, Tilley, & Butler,\net al., 2013). These however are rarely examined in relation to\nthe ALHB, the Mini-K, the Super-K, or the HKSS.\nFurthermore, these batteries do not address the complexities\nof the early family environment (which is often purported to be\nthe main contributing factor: Belsky et al., 1991; Chisholm,\n1999). The Mini-K contains just two items asking about early\nrelationships with mother and father (e.g., ``While growing up,\nI had a close and warm relationship with my biological\nfather''). Responses to this item do not address the key factors\nabout paternal and father-figure relationships. Although a vast\ncorpus of literature suggests that father absence is a critical\nfactor in strategy development (Belsky et al., 1991; Draper &\nmany caveats. For instance, the death of a father does not lead\nto the same outcomes as abandonment by the father (Hether-\nington, 1972). Step parenting, alloparental care, and other par-\nenting strategies are also important to the expression of later\nLH strategy (Sear & Mace, 2008; Sheppard, Garcia, & Sear,\nSnopkowski, & Sear, 2014). These are not encompassed in the\nALHB or Mini-K, and the wider environment is rarely\n4 Evolutionary Psychology\nconsidered. Although it is right that measures of parental\ninvestment should be considered in studies investigating LH\nstrategies, they should be measured within the broad context of\nstrategies and not aggregated within a wider set of theoretically\nrelevant (or potentially irrelevant) indices. Although Figueredo\net al. are right to raise the importance of the environment, most\npsychometric research employing measures such as the HKSS,\nthe Mini-K, and so on (including their own) does not ade-\nquately encompass it.\nThe Super-K\nFigueredo et al. consider the Super-K factor to represent a\nwider nomological net capturing personality (GFP) and health\n(Covitality) in addition to domains covered by the ALHB (e.g.,\nGladden, Sisco, & Figueredo, 2008; Olderbak & Figueredo,\nof measurement and structural models'' is critical to the proper\nevaluation of theory and few would disagree with this. How-\never, care must be taken in their use and interpretation. The\nK-factor approach loads scale totals onto one factor or creates a\nsuper factor from a series of hierarchically structured factors.\nTo some degree, this approach blurs rather than clarifies the\nkey relationships of interest. Figueredo et al. acknowledge that\nso many indices loading (sometimes weakly) onto one global\nhierarchical construct, it is impossible to examine key relation-\nships that underpin milestones of developing LH strategies in\nany meaningful way. In Figure 1 (Biometric and Psychometric\nIndicators--A False Dichotomy section), we illustrated with a\nsimplistic model how LH traits may emerge through a series of\nenvironmental triggers, biological life events, psychological\nmediators, and behavioral outcomes. In a model using higher\norder factors, where all of these different events and processes\nare reduced and loaded onto one scale, we cannot meaningfully\ndiscriminate between them. This is particularly problematic\nwhen items are parceled (which we will address later). How-\never, examination of these key relationships is crucial to\nenhance our understanding of how strategies develop, under\nwhat conditions, and via which psychological and/or biological\nmechanisms.\nIt may be that a series of higher order factors load on to each\nother in an increasingly hierarchical fashion. As our critics\ncorrectly assert, biological traits in animals have been shown\nto cluster together predictably (Promislow & Harvey, 1990;\nRushton, 2004). We do not disagree with the proposal that a\nsimilar dimension may exist in humans. What we dispute is the\nchoice of measures within these lower order factors and the\nlack of evidence that these lower order factors work as mea-\nsurement instruments prior to aggregation, when a similar\napproach is applied to humans.\nFor example, on an all-encompassing measure of the Super-\nK, imagine that one individual scores highly on measures of\nmate value and exclusively pursues short-term sex, is very\nintelligent (high g) and has a long-life expectancy. Another\nindividual scores highly on conscientiousness and agreeable-\nness, favors long-term pair bonds, and has a lower g and life\nexpectancy. A final individual is married with children but is\nalso a clandestine adulterer with a high g and a long-life expec-\ntancy. These three individuals could have very similar overall\nscores on a Super-K strategy battery, despite the fact that they\nvary markedly on various subscales and are in reality pursuing\nradically different strategies. Aggregating many related facets\ninto a global K score means that the ability to discriminate\nwithin the range of strategic possibilities is lost and raises\nquestions about what this aggregate score is actually telling\nus. Figueredo et al. are right to acknowledge that there are a\nrange of contingent LH strategies (see Ellis et al., 2009) that\ncan exist within the scope of the K continuum but does their\nmeasurement approach really allow us to identify the range of\nstrategies in play? The complex interplay of factors that repre-\nsents a person's strategy and their developmental trajectory are\nlost using this approach (see Del Giudice, 2014; Richardson\net al., in press, for an illustrative example of such complexity).\nmight be used to incorporate a developmental dimension, pre-\nsenting a model purportedly testing a Bronfenbrenner-inspired\ndevelopmental sequence (Garcia, Cabeza de Baca, Sotomayor-\nPeterson, Smith-Castro, & Figueredo, in press). Model fitting is\nused to demonstrate that development is best described by a\nhybrid model in which Mini-K directly informs different stages\nin the sequence while each stage also affects the subsequent\nstage. However, the inclusion of these factors does not conform\nto the developmental sequence implied by most proponents of\npsychosocial acceleration theory. The evidence of the last two\ndecades has culminated in a relative consensus that forms the\nbasis of recent proposals of how strategies may emerge, such as\nthe Adaptive Calibration Model (Del Giudice, Ellis, & Shirt-\nThe proposed hybrid model (Figueredo et al., 2015) however\nbears little relationship to this (or other) models. Although the\nfirst developmental stage (biological mother and father) repre-\nsents a retrospective assessment of parental relationships in\nchildhood, the remaining stages are concurrent measures of\nexisting relationships and activities (culminating in regular\nreligious practices) placed in an arguably arbitrary order. Given\nthat the Mini-K itself is a truncated version of the ALHB scales\nused to assess each of these ``stages'', it is unsurprising that\nthey are correlated--but it is a substantial leap from this corre-\nlation to asserting a genetic influence on LH development.\nDespite Figueredo et al.'s emphasis on the environment, there\nis no treatment of environmental influences (stressors on par-\nents and the individual, indices of local competition or resource\naccess) that could play a role in the expression of any of these\nbehaviors or traits.\nOur second objection relates to how these higher order fac-\ntors are constructed. The underlying logic of the Super-K relies\non an increasingly hierarchical model of theoretically related\nfactors that culminate in a representation of an individual's\nstrategy. However, research shows that in some complex con-\nstructs, this is not a valid way to represent a phenomenon. For\nCopping et al. 5\ninstance, the GFP is one of three factors composing the Super-\nK along with the K factor and covitality (Musek, 2007; Rush-\noften constructed from either constituent personality traits\n(such as agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, neuro-\nticism, and openness) or from loading multiple personality\ninventories onto one factor assuming that all relate to a single\ncommon latent. This approach to the measurement of person-\nality however has been widely questioned recently (e.g., Hop-\nWilt (2013), in a review of existing GFP studies concluded that\n(a) this analytical approach to personality is often fundamen-\ntally flawed, (b) the overall magnitude of a general personality\nfactor is not great enough to be genuinely meaningful, and (c)\nGFP is a less useful approach to analyzing individual differ-\nences than using lower level constructs. More recently, evolu-\ntionary psychologists have also claimed that GFP is not ``a\nclean indicator of fast-slow variation in personality'' (Del Giu-\nsonality traits onto a single dimension simply distorts the real\nimpact of personality traits on LH strategies. If, like GFP, the\nlower order factors in their own right are more useful, why load\nthem into higher order structures?\nOur point here (since the wider debate regarding GFP is not\nthe central theme of this article) is that if we cannot apply such\nan analytic technique effectively to one dimension subsumed\nby a supposed Super-K factor, why should we expect it to work\nwith (a) other higher order constructs such as K and covitality\nand (b) even higher level latent variables such as the Super-K\nitself? If we cannot meaningfully interpret a higher order factor\nsuch as GFP on its own, what does it represent when aggregated\ninto a single super factor structure or factor score? Most studies\nemploying the Super-K report only the final factor loadings\nrather than providing data on the underlying structure of the\nconstituent latent traits. Instead they rely on parceled inventory\nscores (a limitation to which we will return shortly), so that we\nare unable to establish with confidence whether factors (from\nhigher order GFP to lower orders such as religiosity, altruism,\nmating effort) are valid representations of the facet(s) they\npurport to measure. This potentially obscures the meaning of\nthe Super-K factor and may cause over or underestimations of\nrelationships between it and other relevant LH traits.\nFurthermore, some incorporations of the Super-K may over-\nestimate factor loadings and thus make the Super-K appear\npsychometrically stronger than it actually is. For instance, Old-\nerbak et al. (2014), present data of a proposed Super-K struc-\nture that includes the subscales of the ALHB and the Mini-K\nloaded onto one factor. One must question why this has been\ndone when the Mini-K is effectively a short form of the ALHB.\nThere is considerable overlap of the content domain which is\nlikely to inflate estimates of factor loadings. Interestingly, cor-\nrelations between the components of the ALHB and the Mini-K\nitself are by Cohen's (1969) criteria small to medium at best.\nOlderbak et al. concluded that ``the Mini-K, ALHB, and Super-\nK factor 1 are the most convergent measures of LHS'' (2014,\np. 86) with the HKSS loading less cohesively with these\nmeasures. This is hardly surprising when one considers that the\nMini-K and the ALHB are effectively the same thing: Why\nwould they not be expected to load together? The proposed\ndevelopmental hybrid model (p. 313) presumably is similarly\nflawed given that the Mini-K is being used to predict factors\nthat the Mini-K actually includes in its measures.\nFinally, Figueredo et al. emphasize the importance of higher\norder single-factor structures for the purposes of studying LH\ntheory. If these models are to have utility, we should expect to\nsee that these single-factor structures offer greater parsimony at\nno expense to model fit when compared to lower order multi-\ndimensional structures. In studies that have explicitly tested\nthis assumption, this has not been found to be the case. Copping\net al. (2014a) found that a four-factor model, not a unidimen-\nsional one, fit data from the HKSS inventory better. Richardson\net al. (2014), using data from the National Longitudinal Survey\nof Youth 1997 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of\nLabor, 2013) found that a unidimensional structure did not fit\nthe data, or that a single LH strategy factor did not subsume all\nLH indicators. Richardson et al. (in press) also found statisti-\ncally independent mating competition and Super-K dimensions\n(implying that a single dimension was not plausible) when\nmodeling LH strategy from Midlife in the United States data.\nFinally, Richardson, Dariotis, and Lai (in press) also found that\na two-dimensional model fits the data better than a single-\nfactor model in a predominantly urban sample of young adults.\nWe, therefore, echo Revelle et al. (2013) and suggest that in-\ndepth analyses of lower order constructs is ultimately much\nmore useful to study the specifics of LH strategy than higher\norder super factors.\nStatistical Issues\nWe now briefly turn to three issues we consider important in\nthe interpretation of the results of LH studies which use psy-\nchometric measures such as the ALHB, the Mini-K, and the\nReliability of Measurement\nThe use of reliability coefficients (Cronbach's a) and the use of\nfit statistics were questioned by Figueredo et al. in relation to\nour interpretation of the HKSS as a measure. The HKSS in our\nstudy showed a high a (.86) and thus demonstrated a high\ndegree of internal consistency. Figueredo et al. make the point\nthat this is an impressive result given how short the inventory is\n(only 26 items). This is an odd claim, considering that the Mini-\nK, which is held to be the superior measure, is shorter still (at\nonly 20 items) and often yields similar reliabilities, with an\naverage around .70 according to Figueredo et al. (2015). Even\nstranger is the fact that colleagues of Figueredo have reported\neven higher reliabilities (.90) for the HKSS (Gladden, Welch,\nOur critics also criticize the reliability of one-item mea-\nsures. Although the general convention is to avoid the use of\nsingle-item measures, greater use of single-item measures is\n6 Evolutionary Psychology\nbecoming prevalent in the social sciences and arguments for\ntheir use have been made (Hayduk & Littvay, 2012). Cron-\nbach's a statistics are dependent on the number of items present\nin a scale and the number of respondents in the sample. Simply\nincreasing the number of items and/or participants will nor-\nmally increase reliability. Worryingly, many often believe a\ncan be used on its own as a proxy for unidimensionality. This is\nof course not so. As demonstrated by Green, Lissitz, and\nMulaik (1977), merging a series of orthogonal scales into one\nlarger scale will still yield high reliability estimates despite the\nfact that the underlying items do not represent a unidimensional\nconstruct. The revised HKSS with separate subscales that we\nproposed in our analysis is a case in point (where the individual\nsubscales have lower reliabilities than a single scale). Across\nmany fields within the social and behavioral sciences, research-\ners have composited scales on the basis of large Cronbach's a\ncoefficients, despite decades of research demonstrating that\ncoefficient a`s assumptions are rarely satisfied in practice\nit does not provide information about internal structure\nReliability alone does not ensure validity. Validity of a con-\nstruct is much more important to establish. Although it is good\nnews that the constructs had at least acceptable internal con-\nsistency, this is redundant if the reliably measured constructs\nare themselves misspecified. It is for this reason that models are\ncompared and evaluated using a range of fit statistics and their\nrelationships with theoretically pertinent variables associated\nwith the construct examined. In this way, the question of what\nK actually is and how it should be measured can be addressed.\nThe use of fit statistics in our study is consistent with general\npractice in the field of psychometrics (including previous\nworks by our critics; e.g., Brumbach et al., 2009; Gladden,\npretations regarding the validity of this measure are justified\nbased on the available data set. We thus maintain that our\noriginal work was far from ``psychometrically invalid,'' as our\ncritics claim it to be.\nProblems of Statistical Conclusion Validity\nOne of the criticisms we made in our original article was the\nover reliance on undergraduate samples to draw conclusions\nabout strategy development in the wider population. In order to\nestablish comparability between samples and hence validate\ngeneralization between them, Figueredo et al. reviewed evi-\ndence that distributions among undergraduate students on mea-\nsures such as the ALHB and Mini-K do not appear to differ\nappreciably from those found in the general population\nevidence helps to establish descriptive similarity between\nsamples, it does not ensure that undergraduate students share\nthe same pattern of causal relationships with other young adult\nsubpopulations or the general young adult population. We can-\nnot be sure we are looking at the same construct across samples\nwithout first establishing measurement invariance (Brown,\n2006). In other words, it is not clear that the relationships\namong indicators believed pertinent to LH strategies are man-\nifestations of the same common construct (the K or super fac-\ntor) across samples. In addition, even if measurement\ninvariance holds, the associations of a factor representing stra-\ntegies with other variables may vary across samples even when\nits means and variances do not (Little, 2000). Of course, it is\nnot easy to identify subpopulations that are causally homoge-\nneous for the functional relations linking predictor or outcome\nvariables with LH measures. Painstaking efforts are required to\ntest these relations for invariance (e.g., see Kline, 2011; Bollen,\nheterogeneity such that generalization to a broader (e.g.,\nnational) population is not warranted. However, without testing\nfor causal invariance, researchers risk accepting estimates that\nare inaccurate descriptors of some or possibly many groups.\nOne methodological approach that can help LH researchers\ndiscover and model heterogeneity is factor mixture modeling,\nin which researchers can discover latent classes with the same\nstructure but allow parameters to vary (see Henson, Reise, &\nWhen the identity of groups is known, multiple group structural\nequation modeling can also be used to test a K factor for con-\nstruct level metric invariance (e.g., across cultures; Frazier,\nTix, & Baron, 2004). Because the K factor is purportedly an\nadaptation, it is important to show that its structure does not\ndiffer across human groups. On an additional note, although\nFigueredo et al. (2015) identified studies of LH measures that\nused nationally representative data (e.g., Brumbach et al., 2009,\nsee also Richardson et al., 2014), it is still clearly the case that\nthe vast majority relied on undergraduate student data. Efforts\nto address this limitation should continue.\nSex Differences in LH Strategy\nIn our original article, we found significant sex differences and\npointed out that insufficient attention had been paid to sex in\nterms of both measurement (data are often not disaggregated by\nsex and neither sex invariance nor differences are tested) and\ntheory (given the different reproductive roles of males and\nfemales it would be surprising if LH trajectories were not\naffected). Figueredo et al. claim that sex has been well explored\nin the literature in relation to measures of K and cite four\nstudies. Yet Figueredo, Cabeza de Baca, and Woodley (2013)\nis a review that makes no real mention of sex differences spe-\ncific to K. The remaining three studies are jointly composed of\nfemales (Figueredo, Andrzejczak, Jones, Smith-Castro, &\nMontero-Rojas, 2011; Gladden, Figueredo, Andrejzak, Jones,\ndifferences are reported, there is little discussion regarding\ntheir nature and little exploration of sex differences within the\nmeasures themselves. Gladden, Sisco, and Figueredo (2008) is\nperhaps the most detailed of the four cited papers, but no invar-\niance testing is performed. Due to the small sample sizes and\nlarge numbers of items, the Mini-K has been parceled and\nCopping et al. 7\naggregated into a higher order K structure (discussed earlier)\nmaking it impossible to test for item invariance across males\n``systematic sex differences of between one-quarter to one-\nthird of a standard deviation between sexes, with males being\npredictably ``faster'' than females.'' However, as the cited\npapers do not present sufficient data to allow readers to make\nsense of this small effect size, it is difficult to interpret the true\nsignificance of this finding. It also raises further questions. In\nwhich inventories, domains, and items are the sex differences\nlocated in the K factor? Is there any evidence of structural\ninvariance over sex on any of the measures employed? These\nimportant questions require answers given the extensive evo-\nlutionary literature on sex differences in mating competition,\naggression, parenting, risk taking, and sexual behavior, to\nlarger part to play in strategy development than the current\npsychometric literature suggests. Below we detail the reasons\nwhy we would expect biological sex to impact upon LH\nstrategy formation.\nA faster LH tempo prioritizes earlier reproduction over\nsomatic growth, current over future reproduction, mating over\nparenting, and offspring quantity over quality. Given\nwomen's higher parental investment and men's consequently\ngreater fitness variance, men as a sex are characterized by a\nfaster LH tempo, as evidenced in physical (e.g., upper body\nstrength) and psychological (e.g., aggressiveness) sex differ-\nences. A shift toward a fast LH tempo for women may entail\ndifferent adjustments as a result of sex differences in mini-\nmum parental investment. There may also be sex differences\nin (sensitivity to) the cues that signal environmental stress\nand trigger LH trajectory change.\nFor men, women are a limiting resource. Mating with mul-\ntiple women offers the opportunity for extreme reproductive\nsuccess. Paternal investment is facultative and deserted moth-\ners generally assume the burden of child care. There is little\nevidence that father absence results in decreased offspring\nfitness (Sear & Mace, 2008), but such costs could be compen-\nsated for by the extra offspring resulting from a serial short-\nterm reproductive strategy. We would expect that male traits\nenhancing mating success would be selected for, both those\nassociated with intrasexual competition (aggression, domi-\nnance striving, sensation seeking) and intersexual competition\n(facial features signaling ``good genes,'' e.g., symmetry, mas-\nculinity, dominance). According to Del Giudice (2009), envi-\nronmental stress, signaled to the developing boy through\ndisrupted family relationships, fosters the development of avoi-\ndant attachment (correlated with aggression, self-reliance, and\ninflated self-esteem) which serves as a psychological adapta-\ntion for short-term relationships in adulthood. Dark Triad traits\nhave also been implicated in a fast LH strategy (McDonald,\nDonnellan, & Navarrete, 2012) via strategic deception\n(Machiavellianism), egocentrism (Narcissism), and absence\nof empathy (Psychopathy). Not yet explored is the possibility\nof downregulation of typical ``fathering'' adaptations seen\nfollowing fatherhood such as the testosterone reduction and\noxytocin enhancement.\nWomen's adoption of a fast LH strategy has focused on\nearlier age of sexual maturity, sexual initiation, and first birth.\nA meta-analysis of 33 independent effect sizes confirms an\nassociation between father absence and earlier menarche,\nd \u00bc 0.28 (Webster, Graber, Gesselman, Crosier, & Schember,\n2014) and in father-present families, a closer relationship with\ndaughters predicts later menarche (Ellis, 2004). Earlier\nmenarche is associated with a longer reproductive lifespan,\nearly initiation into sexual activity, earlier age of first\npregnancy, and increased risk of teenage pregnancy (Coall,\nTickner, McAllister, & Sheppard, 2016). Although Del Giudice\nproposed that boys are more likely to respond to early family\ndysfunction by forming avoidant attachments, girls are more\nlikely to form anxious/ambivalent attachments. Such attach-\nments are associated with abandonment anxiety and over-\ndependency and in adulthood earlier initiation into sexual\nactivity and willingness to engage in sex to secure their part-\nner's attention. An unrestricted sociosexual orientation appears\nto be more closely allied to the quality of parenting rather than\nfor an association between lifetime fertility and early familial\nstress and menarche is mixed (Coall et al., 2016).\nIn terms of reducing maternal commitment, women cannot\nescape the minimum obligation of gestation although under\nconditions of high extrinsic risk such as famine and warfare,\nmothers reduce infant-directed care (Quinlan, 2007). In low-\nrisk environments, offspring fitness shows a linear increase as a\nfunction of maternal effort before reaching a saturation point of\ndiminishing returns. In high-risk environments (such as those\nassociated with a faster LH strategy) this saturation point and\nthe corresponding reduction in maternal care are reached much\nearlier. A fast strategy prioritizes offspring quantity over qual-\nity, leading to the expectation that maternal investment will be\nreduced, although not so markedly as has been found in men\n(Szepsenwol, Simpson, Griskevicius, & Raby, 2015). Pregnant\nwomen, who have a history of early life adversity, are poorly\nattached and experience high levels of stress have lower oxy-\ntocin levels, a hormone associated with positive mother\u00adinfant\ninteractions (Garfield, Mathews, & Janusek, 2016; Samuel\net al., 2015). Child neglect and abuse are associated with pov-\nerty (Coulton, Crampton, Irwin, Spillsbury, & Korbin, 2007),\nas are lower maternal warmth, lower positive control, and\ngreater negativity (Belsky, Bell, Bradley, Stallard, & Stewart-\nBrown, 2007). In poor families, mothers' inability to empathize\nwith their children's mental states is associated with children's\nheightened vulnerability to internalizing and externalizing\nbehaviors (Hurtig et al., 2007; Meins, Centifanti, Fernyhough,\nMaternal investment in children may be truncated in favor\nof a quicker return to the mating arena. Although the advan-\ntages of multiple mating for women are less well-established\nthan for men, one clear benefit is offspring genetic diversity\n8 Evolutionary Psychology\n(``bet hedging'') and another may be cryptic female choice for\n``good'' or compatible genes (Jennions & Petrie, 2000). As\nlong-term investment is not anticipated, women are expected\nto show a preference for indirect benefits indexed by facial\nfeatures indicating health and dominance. Short-term relation-\nships can also supply some direct (if brief) financial benefits\nand the sporadic episodes of conspicuous consumption associ-\nated with criminal enterprises (``earning-and burning'') may\nmake some men attractive to women. Given the laws of supply\nand demand, securing the favor of such men will involve\nassuming an appearance and demeanor that advertises willing-\nness to engage in a short-term relationship. Conditions of pov-\nerty intensify women's intersexual and intrasexual competition\nIn addition to seeking resources through associations with\nmen, women living in situations of high extrinsic stress are\nmore vulnerable to involvement in crime although their invol-\nvement is cross-culturally lower than men's. In Britain, women\nare arrested for nearly 15% of detected crime (Parity, 2013)\nand, as in the United States, they are disproportionately repre-\nsented in petty financially motivated crimes such as fraud and\nresource-based motivation. A high proportion of women offen-\nders are undereducated, unemployed, receiving welfare bene-\nfits, and supporting dependent family members (Chesney-Lind,\n1997). Traits associated with offending (including sensation\nseeking, impulsivity, shortened time horizons) may be elevated\namong women pursuing a faster LH strategy.\nIdeally, future studies will consider the implementation of\nresearch designs that allow us to look at many of these factors\nand traits within a LH framework in more detail. Men and\nwomen will respond to different environmental cues and (obvi-\nously) different biological events via differentially attuned psy-\nchological mechanisms to facilitate fitness goals. As such,\nmeasures and analyses that can help us look more closely at\ntheir differences will be invaluably informative, particularly\nfrom an interventionist or social policy perspective.\nOne very useful psychometric tool for exploring such differ-\nences is multigroup CFA (MGCFA; see Frazier et al., 2004). In\nthe MGCFA framework, sex differences in LH strategy might\nmanifest as configural variance (i.e., different items load on\ndifferent factors), metric variance (i.e., different loading magni-\ntudes), scalar variance (i.e., different item intercepts or thresh-\nolds), and/or factor level differences in parameters including\nmeans and variances. By identifying sex differences in MGCFA\nmodels, researchers can discover if LH factors are proxies for\ndifferent constructs (or mechanisms) between the sexes, as they\nare if at least partial metric and scalar invariance do not hold. If\nwe are indeed measuring the same constructs across the sexes,\nthese models can help us determine what differences exist at the\nconstruct level, or in terms of factor variances or means.\nIn sum, MGCFA can address important questions about LH\ndimensions, such as (a) Does the K factor exist and have the\nsame meaning across the sexes? (b) Given that measurement\ninvariance holds, do the K factor means and variances differ\nsignificantly between the sexes? Importantly, differences in the\nmeans cannot be interpreted if measurement invariance does\nnot hold. This is because the same construct is not measured\nacross groups. Similar, sex differences in the correlates of the K\nfactor (or other LH factor) could simply reflect the fact that the\nconstruct does not have the same identity in males and females.\nIf measurement invariance holds, then sex differences can be\ninterpreted in terms of differences in means and variances.\nAnd, sex differences in the K factor's nomological net can be\ntraced to factor variance differences (with males expected to\nexhibit greater variance) or otherwise explained with reference\nto the evolved sex differences discussed above. At this early\nstage, the dimensionality of LH indicators is not well-\nestablished and it is not yet clear that any LH dimensions are\ninvariant by sex. These issues should be a focus for LH\nresearchers.\nItem Parcels\nFigueredo et al.'s critique strongly advocated the use of item\nparcels when evaluating LH models. Item parcels are created\neither by averaging or aggregating the scores of multiple\nindices of a theoretical construct. Thus, a scale of five items\ncan be reduced to only one number for the purposes of analysis.\nAs many inventories can potentially have hundreds of items,\nparceling is a pragmatic way of reducing the case-to-variable\nratio for the purposes of analysis. Further advantages have been\nsuggested, such as improving item fit, improving internal con-\nsistency, more stable parameter estimates and reducing the\nlevel of idiosyncratic behavior from individual items (Bandalos\n& Finney, 2001; Little, Cunningham, Shahar, & Widaman,\nHowever, creating a factor via an item parcel is not the same\nas examining the same factor as a manifestation of its original\nindicators because the parcel is a new variable and fundamen-\ntally changes the nature of the data. It is for this reason some\nargue that item parceling is not an acceptable way to treat data\nfor the purposes of analysis (Marsh, Ludtke, Nagengast, Morin,\n& Von Davier, 2013). Many researchers ignore the fact that\nparceled items should be demonstrably unidimensional and\nthat acceptable fit should be achievable when using CFA to\nmodel the parceled factor without cross loadings or secondary\nfactors (Marsh & O'Neill, 1984). The field of psychometrics\nhas generally accepted that if these basic assumptions are met\nand have been replicated consistently, parceling in this manner\nis acceptable. Unfortunately, these guidelines are not always\nadhered to. Parcelled scales are often assumed to be valid and\nreliable measures representing the underlying construct with-\nout being tested formally via other methods (Marsh et al.,\n2013). Marsh et al. provide a series of examples and simula-\ntions that demonstrate how scales that do not work as concep-\ntually specified can nonetheless achieve acceptable statistical\nfit when parcels are used instead (including random parcels).\nOften, as mentioned earlier, Cronbach's a alone is used as a\nproxy to justify unidimensionality without formal testing.\nCopping et al. 9\nWith regards to the HKSS, no such assumptions regarding\nits structure could be made as no test of the underlying factor\nstructure had ever been conducted to examine the original the-\noretical proposal. Our analysis of the HKSS suggested that the\noriginal specification was not unidimensional and that cross\nloadings between the proposed factors were evident. Treating\nthe originally suggested subscales independently was equally\nproblematic. The revision of the original items creates a better\nmodel with four factors that did not cross load at item level\n(although the resulting factors are not independent). Given this,\nwhat justification would there have been to parcel the HKSS in\nthe manner Figueredo et al. suggested? Had this been done, the\nproblems inherent in the measure would have been effectively\nhidden from view and thus we would have created a measure\nwith a presumably near perfect fit with only four items. Mis-\nspecification would have been masked by the creation of four\nnew variables. What would this new scale mean? Would it\naccurately reflect responses to items? Would the relationships\nbetween factors now be meaningful? This all seems unlikely.\nWhen interpreting models, it is important to consider what\nthey actually represent. Can a model using parcels (including\nnonrandom parcels) really reflect anything conceptually rele-\nvant? The concept underlying the measure must be kept in\nmind during model construction in CFA. If not, what is being\nconfirmed? The decision in our study to treat the models by\nspecifying the underlying structure in full (rather than by par-\nceling) was the correct way to treat these data, particularly in\nthe absence of historic evidence that the proposed structure was\nacceptable to begin with. Considering that our sample size was\nlarge enough to evaluate the full scale on an item level, what\nreason would there be to reduce this model down to three or\nfour parcels? To parcel the items post hoc as suggested by our\ncritics would achieve statistical parsimony at the expense of\nvalidity. This would not advance our understanding of LH\nstrategies. The structural analysis we employed helped to\ndevelop a scale that could reconcile theory with the available\ndata set. Had the model not been specified in full, it would have\nbeen impossible to perform detailed examination of specific\nitems to determine which were problematic for the scale.\nSummary\nWhile accepting many of the comments made by Figueredo\net al., we feel our original work was far from ``psychometri-\ncally invalid'' and reiterate calls for further consideration to be\ngiven to actual life events and for greater synthesis of these\nwith psychological variables deemed important to the LH stra-\ntegies. In doing so, researchers should be able to determine if\nthe nomological net as described by Rushton (1985), Figueredo\net al. (2015), and others exists in a form that can be reduced to\nan aggregated factor score. Furthermore, we urge researchers to\npay more attention to the constituent latent traits on higher\norder factors prior to aggregation and to publish more data\nregarding their structure. Ensuring that the lower order traits\nare valid structural measures of relevant LH traits before aggre-\ngating them into higher order factors and/or using parceled\nmeasures will afford greater confidence in the interpretation\nof results. Invariance testing across groups will also allow us\nto more adequately generalize findings across different popula-\ntions including culture, class, and sex. The validity of K-based\nmeasures in relation to adaptively relevant behaviors must be\nconsidered in greater detail if further substantial progress is to\nbe made in the field.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nArcher, J.
