    "abstract": "Abstract. Medieval times were neither dark nor grey; natural light illuminated colourful scenes\ndepicted in paintings through coloured windows and via artificial beeswax candlelight. When we\nenter, for example, a church to inspect its historic treasures ranging from mosaics to depictions of\nsaints, we do this under quite unfavourable conditions; particularly as we mainly depend on artificial\nhalogen, LED or fluorescent light for illuminating the desired object. As these light spectrums\nare different from the natural light conditions under which the old masterpieces were previously\ndeveloped and perceived, the perceptual effects may dramatically differ, leading to significantly\naltered affective and cognitive processing. Different qualities of processing might particularly be\ntriggered when perceiving artworks which deal with specific material prone to strong interaction with\nidiosyncratic light conditions, for instance gold-leafed surfaces that literally start to glow when lit\nby candles. We tested the perceptual experiences of a figurative piece of art which we created in\n3 (foreground) by 3 (background) versions, illuminated under three different light conditions (daylight,\ncoloured light and beeswax candlelight). Results demonstrated very different perceptual experiences\nwith stunning effects for the interaction of the specific painting depicted on a gold-leafed background\nlit by candlelight.\n",

Around the year 1300, the painters again started to use chiaro-\nscuro, a technique allowing shadows to be cast gradually, which had already been known by antique\npainters (Sedlmayr, 1959). The chiaroscuro creates an impressive spatial effect by illustrating the light,\nwhich illuminates the scene of a painting (Livingstone, 2002). Objects or persons have darker and\nbrighter areas depending on the angle of incident light, and they cast shadows. The light source (a) can\nbe shown within the painting; for example a candle (Figure 1b), torch or even the sun or the moon or\n(b) can also be located outside of the painting rendering it unnecessary to paint the direct light source\nitself but rather the effects of the emitted light.\nThe thought that medieval painters simply did not know how to paint in chiaroscuro tech-\nnique would be wrong as chiaroscuro was not unknown during the Middle ages. Instead, we have\nto ask: Why had they decided to use another technique? The art historian Wolfgang Sch\u00f6ne (see\nSch\u00f6ne, 1954) not only observed--as other art historians had already done--that in some periods of\nmedieval times, particularly in Ottonian book illustrations (10th and 11th centuries; cf. Figure 1a),\nthere are no cast shadows and no chiaroscuro but the paintings are \"light themselves\"; they glow from\nwithin their depths. He also observed that the figures inside the paintings seem to step out of them in\ndirection of the observer, especially if the painting has a golden background. Golden backgrounds are\nused only in illuminations, mosaics or paintings on table, in frescos other colours for instance lapis\nlazuli blue had been applied. One remarkable example is the fresco cycle of the St. Francis legend\nin the church St. Francesco in Assisi, painted around the year 1300 and thus somewhat later than\nthe Ottonian era (Sch\u00f6ne, 1954). Fortunately, this church is still equipped with the original coloured\nglass windows, and so we are faced with an original perception condition. Sch\u00f6ne even proposed\nthat it should be mandatory for medieval paintings, frescos or book illustrations to be observed under\nGolden perception: Simulating perceptual habits of the past\nmedieval light conditions in order to fully understand the artworks. Importantly, due to the glass used\nand the positioning of light sources, the illumination of closed rooms in medieval times was either\nfrom artificial light emerging from candles or dimmed light filtered by the coloured glass windows\nthrough which daylight was entering. In few cases, for instance scriptoriums, also open fireplaces,\ntorches or oil lamps illuminated the beholder's place. These light conditions, and thus, the correspond-\ning wavelengths, typically encountered in these times when perceiving the artworks/books/etc. were\nalso the light conditions the painters typically encountered during their production process. The col-\nourless glass, plus the type of artificial light which we can see in most churches and museums today,\ndramatically changes the viewing conditions as already noted by a deep analysis of the eyetracking\npattern of Duccio's \"The Annunciation\" (Leonards et al., 2007). For our present paper, the most obvi-\nous point is that modern light in particular does not let such paintings \"glow\"; instead, the depicted\nscenes appear flat and devoid of any spatial effect.\nSch\u00f6ne explained the fact that there were medieval painters who did not utilise the chiaroscuro\ntechnique with the point that the prevailing medieval religious conviction at this time was God's syno-\nnymity with light (metaphysics of light), which is based on Neo-Platonism (Sch\u00f6ne, 1954). The paint-\ners did not want to show a scene which is illuminated by daylight, or indeed any other light which can\nbe observed on earth. Their intention was to present the idea or the nature of divine light, particularly\nas the depicted scenes originated from the Holy Bible. That is why Sch\u00f6ne calls the light of medieval\npaintings not only \"self-illuminating light\" (Eigenlicht) but even \"revelation light\" (Offenbarungslicht)\n(Sch\u00f6ne, 1954, p. 55). Consequently, anything which is light itself cannot cast a shadow or have darker\nand brighter areas; thus, anybody who entered a church or opened a book in medieval times saw scenes\nof the Holy Bible filled with light.\nTo impose the sensation of paintings suffused with light--actually \"being light\"--medieval artists,\ninstead of painting holy scenes in a naturalistic style, rather used a special Formensprache (i.e. design\nvocabulary or form language, see Carbon, 2010) signifying specific religious aims. This particular\nstyle can be found in shape and form aspects as well as colour and light properties. Regarding shape\nand form, angels were, for instance, depicted with artificially long arms and fingers just to empha-\nsise their gestures. Concerning colour and light properties, the artists had to achieve the perception\nFigure 1. (a) Example for an Ottonian book illustration, 10th century; (b) example for chiaroscuro, 17th century.\nSources: (a) Bayerische Staatsbibliothek M\u00fcnchen, Clm 4452 f. 8v, (b) \"Christ before the High Priest\" by Gerrit\nvon Honthorst (depiction is public domain; original is located at the National Gallery London).\n(a) (b)\nof the colour being used more as a free colour and not so much as a surface colour, which would\nalways be associated with a specific object. A free colour, for example, would be the blue of the sky;\nwhereas an example of a surface colour is the red of a tomato. According to Sch\u00f6ne (1954), a surface\ncolour is always illuminated, whereas a free colour is always self-luminous. The art historian Hans\nJantzen explained the difference between both concepts by using the terms \"Eigenwert\" (probably\nbest to be translated as \"eigen value\" or \"own value\") and \"Darstellungswert\" (\"presentation value\")\nof the colour. He revealed that in Ottonian book illustrations the Eigenwert of colour is high, whereas\nthe Darstellungswert of colour is low (Jantzen, 1963, p. 104). By the mere inspection of Ottonian\nbook illustrations it is obvious that the artists used low naturalistic colours which have hardly any\ndescriptive function. The medieval painters also refrained from painting any material structure. There\nis no discernible difference between the wood surface of a painted object or a tissue. The surface of\nthe colours is smoothly worked-out (Sedlmayr, 1959, p. 42). All these techniques together assist in the\nperception of the colours as free colours and not as surface colours. Most evidently, this can be seen in\nthe backgrounds, where one is able to find large areas of colours, and sometimes only one colour (this\nis often gold), but no objects at all. Further enhancement of the impression of light is realised through\nbrightening the colours by adding white pigments.\nAlthough Ottonian book illustrations lack any chiaroscuro modelling, alternative modelling can\nbe found in terms of lines in white or other colours. Sch\u00f6ne (1954) calls this modelling \"Modellierungs\nhelle\" (brightness of modelling) and Sedlmayr (1959) describes it as \"modelling without shadows\" and\n\"darkness-free modelling.\" These kinds of typical medieval modelling produce spatiality--without\nthem the figures would seem totally flat, i.e. two-dimensional.\nAlthough Sch\u00f6ne's hypotheses are appealing, logical and consistent, experimental proof of them\nis still missing. Testing his hypotheses in an experimental way is quite challenging due to some nega-\ntive contextual factors: (1) It is quite challenging to simulate original medieval light conditions, and\n(2) the preservation condition of most medieval works is quite poor. Sometimes, we still find remark-\nably well-preserved Ottonian book illustrations such as the \"Bamberger Apokalypse\" (Bamberge\nApocalypse) or the \"Perikopenbuch Heinrich II\" (both from approx. 1000 AD), but the books are\ntoo precious for use in typical tests--furthermore, it is hard to find adequate control material. Conse-\nquently, we produced our own experimentally varied stimuli and showed them under systematically\nvarying light conditions.\n2 Experiment\nIn the following, we simulated three painting techniques differing in the amount of modelling used--\n(a) medieval modelling, (b) naturalistic modelling and (c) without any modelling--and combined\nthem with three specific light conditions--(a) typical candlelight when objects were illuminated by\nartificial light in medieval times, (b) typical coloured light when objects were lit by natural light\nthrough coloured windows, e.g. in cathedrals, and (c) light simulated by modern technology as day-\nlight. The main aim of the experiment was to assess the perceptual impact induced by inspecting the\nspecific combinations of our experimental factors of painting techniques and lighting conditions.\nParticipants\nTen participants (five female and five male; mean age: 25.9 years, range: 22\u00ad30 years) from the Uni-\nversity of Bamberg volunteered in the study. They were na\u00efve to the purpose of the experiment and\nhad normal or corrected-to-normal vision as assessed by the Snellen eye-chart test. All participants\nhad normal colour vision as demonstrated by a short version of the Ishihara colour test. None of the\nparticipants had any special training in history subjects in general or art history in particular.\nStimuli and apparatus\nThe stimuli consisted of nine figurative paintings, painted by an artist (P.D., the second author) spe-\ncifically for the sake of the experiment; always based on the same scene depicting a seagull on a\nmono-coloured background. The pictures (size: W \u00d7 H = 14.8 \u00d7 16.8 cm) were presented in a black\npass\u00e9-partout, size: 34.7 \u00d7 37.0 cm standing on a bookrest on a table with a height of 72.0 cm. We\nfollowed a 3 [background] by 3 [modelling] experimental design yielding nine paintings (see stim-\nulus-based variables in Table 1). The used colours have been made by the artist from mineral and\norganic pigments and the binder from Gummi Arabicum (also known as Gum Arabic). Manufactur-\ners of the pigments were Kremer Pigmente GmbH & Co.KG (D-88317 Aichstetten, Germany) and\nJ. J. Gerstend\u00f6rfer GmbH & Co.KG (D-91104 Schwabach, Germany). Further details can be retrieved\nfrom the second author.\nIn order to avoid any religious associations we have chosen a gull instead of an angel, for instance,\nas motif. Regarding the background colours, we decided to use a yellow background because it is a\nshining colour, the colour which is most similar to gold (e.g., in the heraldic tradition gold is often sub-\nstituted by yellow). The dark brown colour was used in order to investigate the effect of a dark colour\nin opposite to the shining backgrounds yellow and gold. So we could test whether the effect, if it could\nbe seen by the participants, depends on the golden background or whether it could also be observed on\na colour background which is very shiny and on colour background which is the opposite, namely dark.\nFigure 2 gives an example of three of the nine paintings of a gull with different types of modelling\nand different background colours.\nAll combinations of the stimulus-based variables were further crossed with the variable light sub-\nsuming the levels candlelight, coloured light, and daylight (Table 2). For an illustration of the latter\ntwo light sources, see Figure 3.\nProcedure\nThe whole experiment consisted of two phases lasting approx. 2 up to 3.5 hrs in total, depending on\nthe participant's pace. At no point was there any time pressure on the participants, who inspected one\npicture after another.\nTable 1.

Participants freely inspected an initial painting (background: gold; mod-\nelling: medieval) under all three light conditions in the following order: firstly daylight, then coloured\nlight and lastly candlelight. The participants were allowed to move and pick up the painting. They were\nasked to verbalise their impressions and changes of impressions from one light condition to another.\nPhase 2: \"Guided inspection\". Participants inspected all materials under all light conditions in\na random order; the light conditions changed every three trials, with repetition of the order of light\nconditions after 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 stimuli; the order of light conditions was randomised across participants.\nThe participants were asked to answer a 50-item questionnaire for each picture, addressing questions\non the impression of the foreground object (the gull), on the relationship between the foreground and\nthe background, the clearness of the depicted object and finally on the holistic impression of the paint-\ning as such. This was done with seven-point rating scales (1 = not at all, 7 = very strong or 1 = very\npoor, 7 = very good, dependent on the type of question). The questionnaire addressed key variables\nregarding the testing of the impression triggered by the specific combination of colour and mate-\nrial conditions explained above. The variables referred to four categories in which we were mainly\ninterested; i.e. Object (N = 16; e.g., \"To what extent does the gull glow against myself\"), Multilayer\n(N = 17; e.g., \"How much is the gull located on a different layer than the background?\"), Clearness\n(N = 3; e.g., \"How clear can the gull be seen?\"), and Overall (N = 14; e.g., \"How mystical is the\ngeneral impression of the painting?\"). Note that these categories were pre-experimentally defined and\nwere not further validated as latent factors or the like.\n2.2Results and discussion\nThe obtained data were analysed in a two-stepped fashion starting with the analysis of the quantitative\ndata from the rating scales of Phase 2 via general linear models, and then with the examination of the\nqualitative data of that phase by content of the participants' verbal descriptions.\nAnalyses of the quantitative data (rating scales)\nTo assess the perceptual impact of gold-leafed surfaces in combination with, e.g., typical beeswax can-\ndlelight or coloured light, which was typically used in cathedrals to light paintings of Saints, we will\nfocus with regard to quantitative data on the analysis of the following variables which we assigned to\nTable 2. Light sources used (variable light).\nLight source Description of setting\nCandlelight Two beeswax candles, diameter 6 cm (manufacturer: Company Diller), which were placed\non the left and right side of the picture, to simulate the primary artificial light source of\nthe medieval era (see Figure 3b)\nColoured light Translucent paper of the colours green, yellow, red and blue in front of two bins with a neon\nlamp inside, to simulate the incidence of light from medieval windows of churches or\nscriptoria. The bins were standing on the left and right side of the table, on which the\nparticipants were seated, and in front of them were the presented pictures (see Figure 3a)\nDaylight Simulated with daylight lamps on the ceiling\nFigure 3. Illustration of experimental light settings: (a) coloured light and (b) candlelight.\n(a) (b)\nfour main dimensions (Table 3): (1) Glowing indicates a specific quality of the object which seems to\nglow, (2) Multilayer indicates more than one pictorial layer of the painting, (3) Visibility indicates how\nwell the object can be recognised and (4) Supernatural indicates the overall impression of something\ndepicted which could be described as being mystical, supernatural, otherworldly.\nFor all four dimensions, we conducted separate three-way (multivariate) mixed-design analyses\nof variance ((M)ANOVAs) with background (gold, brown, yellow), light (candlelight, coloured, day-\nlight) and modelling (medieval, naturalistic, without) as independent variables. Note: Before the vari-\nable \"Unity of gull and background\" (dimension Multilayer) was fed into the regarding MANOVA,\nwe reversed its scale direction to make it concordant with the remaining variables (cf. information on\nthe direction of variables in parentheses of Table 3).\nAs we were mainly interested in the interaction of the different manipulations operationalised by\nthe factors background, light and modelling, we will refer only to the interactive effects of these factors;\nresults of the significant effects on the basis of the fully saturated models can be retrieved from Table 4.\nAs can be seen in Table 4, the interaction between background and light was significant for all\nfour dimensions, whereas background \u00d7 modelling failed significance for the dimension Glowing\nand the remaining interactions were only significant for Visibility. Figure 4 shows for two exemplary\nvariables how strong the visual effect of the specific assembly of gold-leafed surface and light from\nbeeswax candles truly is: the gull was particularly \"full of light\" when the candlelight illuminated the\nbird accomplished in gold-leafed technique, and specifically for this combination we also revealed the\noptimum of an overall mystical impression of the scene.\nBesides effects of background and light, Figure 5 also documents interactive effects with model-\nling: especially when gold was used within medieval modelling, participants were able to perceive\ndifferent layers in the painting, i.e. the gull was perceived as an entity of its own, being independent\nfrom the background.\nTable 3.

On average, they used\ncandlelight, coloured and daylight, respectively. Repeatedly, participants reported \"specific strong\ncontrast\" for the candlelight condition. The candlelight condition was further appreciated as having\nmore \"harmony\" and presenting a clearer view on the composition, while the golden nature was no\nlonger perceived as gold but more or less as a dark substance letting the major scene glow. Meanwhile,\nthe painting inspected under daylight was very often qualified as \"unrealistic,\" \"unnatural,\" \"unclear\"\nand \"flat.\" This overall pattern of results is quite compatible with the aforementioned analyses based\non rating scales.\n3 General discussion\nThe present paper aimed to analyse typical painting techniques used in medieval times under different\nlight conditions. We contrasted artificial daylight to (a) coloured light typically encountered in cathe-\ndrals with original coloured windows and (b) beeswax candlelight. We inspected particularly strong\nchanges in the perception of artworks which were specifically prepared for this study when we used\na gold-leafed background. In a phase where participants verbally described their visual experiences\nas well as in a phase where they responded to rating scales, we observed very different perceptions\nFigure 4.

Results illustrating the interaction of background \u00d7 modelling for the dimension Multilayer. Error bars\nindicate \u00b11 standard error of the mean (SEM).\nof the same scene when the light quality was changed. In line with earlier research conducted by\nLeonards et al. (2007), beeswax candlelight was shown to change the perception of artworks. This\neffect was not only a minor, quantitative one in the sense of merely better contrasts--perceiving little\nmore details or seeing the scene in a slightly different colour spectrum--but as was already assumed\nby Sch\u00f6ne (1954), the way under which an artwork from medieval times is illuminated changes the\nwhole meaning and understanding of the inspected work. In extreme cases, the artwork will not be\nproperly understood when the light condition differs substantially from the original setting under which\nit was created--it might also lead to a failure to experience \"Aesthetic Aha!\" (Muth & Carbon, 2013)\nfollowed by insufficient interest in the artwork and its elaboration.\nSpecifically when parts of artworks are gold leafed, it seems impossible to abstract from unfavour-\nable and artificial light conditions. Nowadays, we can inspect a large number of medieval masterpieces\nin museum contexts, arranged in unnatural settings and illuminated by specific light conditions which\nare in accord with preservation issues or simply due to economic considerations. This might turn out\nfatal when attempting to decipher and understand such artworks. The misleading idea of bright and\nspotted lights might be that any kind of such hard and bright light will uncover hidden messages and\ndeeper meanings, although in fact the specific faint light of a simple beeswax candle is the real cata-\nlyst for revealing such messages. Due to the candle's nature of selectively lightening and dimming a\ncomplex pattern of locations, such lighting conditions help us to understand what the medieval masters\nperceived on their own and what they wanted to express by their delicate works of art.\nCertainly, we cannot simulate the perception of medieval times by use of light and surface conditions\nalone, but the present experiment demonstrates that we can simulate at least parts of the perceptual\nconditions which people in those times were faced with. This is one further step towards understanding\nthe visual habits of the past, and thus a key to understanding human cognition (and subsequent action)\nof earlier times as well as different cultures. Further studies could try to activate specific perceptual\nschemata by providing participants with more information on the meaning of symbols, painting tech-\nniques and the artists' aims or by animating participants to really contemplate on the pieces of arts.\nOther experimental ideas might deal with the contextual presentation conditions of such artworks:\nnowadays, many of these precious works are literally displaced in nicely lit vitrines to be found in\nmuseums where different pieces are collected and grouped according to categories or taxonomies.\nThis means that the presentation conditions are maximally different from the objects' original embed-\nment centuries ago. If we make joint efforts to bring experts from different research and practice\napproaches together, inter alia art historians, artists, stonecutters, light engineers, restoration scientists,\nsemioticians, historians and perceptual scientists, we will be able to start a fascinating journey to the\n\"perceptual past.\"\n"
