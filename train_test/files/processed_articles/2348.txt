Negative pregnancy and birth out-\ncomes, such as infant mortality [2-4], stillbirth [5], con-\ngenital anomalies [6], preterm birth (PTB), and low\nbirthweight (LBW) [7] disproportionately affect adolescent\ncompared to adult mothers. Unfortunately, most research\non determinants of birth outcomes has focused on adult\nrather than teen mothers. Given the large number of ado-\nlescent births and the related pregnancy complications, it\nis important to explore factors that influence birth out-\ncomes specifically within the teenage group.\nAmong adult mothers, maternal educational attain-\nment is positively linked with birth outcomes [8-14].\nLower education has been associated with elevated risks\ndeath [8]. One study found that there was a positive lin-\near relationship between maternal year of schooling and\nbirthweight in black women, and a non-linear relation-\nship in white women, with the optimal level of schooling\nwith regard to birthweight being about 16 years and\nlower or higher levels of education associated with lower\nbirthweight [9].\nAlthough evidence of the association between mater-\nnal educational attainment and birth outcomes has been\nconsistent, there remain uncertainties about the explan-\nation for the association [9].

Women with lower educational attainment\nare more likely to smoke during pregnancy [16-18], and\nsome researchers reported that the relationship between\nlower maternal education and adverse perinatal outcomes\nwas (partly) explained by smoking during pregnancy\nand smoking during pregnancy had independent effects\non small-for-gestational-age births and child's antisocial\nbehaviors [12,16]. Women with lower education are also\nmore likely to have less or delayed prenatal care [20-22].\nThe Healthy People 2020 agenda includes goals related\nto improving adolescents' academic success and achieve-\nment [23]. Academic performance and educational aspir-\nation during adolescence are found to be related to\neducational attainment in adulthood [24,25]. Rumberger\nreported that grade retention and poor academic perform-\nance were important factors that were predictive of drop-\nping out of middle school [24]. Grade skipping, which is\none form of grade acceleration [26], has been found to be\nassociated with better future educational and occupational\noutcomes in science, technology, engineering, and math-\nematics among males, and with a higher likelihood of pur-\nsuing law degrees and medical degrees in females [27].\nAcademic performance and educational expectation have\nalso been negatively associated with a number of risky be-\nhaviors, such as cigarette smoking [28-31], alcohol drink-\nhypothesize that adolescents' academic performance and\neducational aspiration might be related with birth out-\ncomes through behavioral intermediaries.\nHowever, while there has been growing literature on\nmaternal educational attainment and birth outcomes\namong adult mothers, less research has been conducted\nexploring whether academic performance and educa-\ntional aspiration influence birth outcomes among ado-\nlescent mothers. Teen mothers have been found to have\npoorer educational performance compared to other\nteens [35,36]. This raises the question of a potential rela-\ntionship between adolescents' academic performance,\neducational aspiration and birth outcomes.\nThe purpose of the present study is to examine how ma-\nternal academic performance and educational aspiration\nduring adolescence are related to birth outcomes among\nadolescent mothers. In addition, we examine whether\nthese relationships, if any, can be explained by maternal\nsmoking during pregnancy and utilization of prenatal care.\nWe use data from a nationally-representative survey of\nschool-attending youth who have completed their teenage\nyears and thus have complete data on teenage pregnan-\ncies. Results will add to existing literature on the determi-\nnants of birth outcomes among adolescents.\nMethods\nData\nData from waves I and IV of the National Longitudinal\nStudy of Adolescent Health (Add Health) contractual\ndataset were utilized [37]. Add Health is a prospective\ncohort study of a nationally-representative sample of\n(Wave I) [38]. Follow-up interviews were conducted in\nIV). A multistage probability clustered sampling design\nwas used to obtain its Wave I sample. The first stage\nwas a stratified, random sample of all public and private\nhigh schools in the U.S. A feeder school was also re-\ncruited from each participating community. In-school\nsurveys were attempted with all students attending par-\nticipating schools; a total of 90,118 were completed. In\nthe second Wave I sampling stage, a sample of adoles-\ncents was drawn for in-depth in-home interviews, con-\nsisting of a random core sample plus selected special\noversamples; a total of 20,745 interviews were conducted\nat this stage. At Wave II, most students (except Wave I\nseniors) were eligible for re-interview; at Waves III and\nIV, all respondents to the Wave I in-home interview\nwere eligible for re-interview. A total of 15,701 inter-\nviews were conducted at Wave IV (80.3% response rate).\nSampling weights adjusted for both unequal probabilities\nof selection into the original sample and for loss to\nfollow-up. The present study was deemed exempt by the\nIRB at Tulane University.\nWe applied a number of sample inclusion criteria.\nFirst, we limited to females who participated in Wave IV,\nas that was the Wave when all respondents had com-\npleted their teenage years and had complete teen preg-\nnancy data. Second, we limited to female participants\nwith valid sampling weights in order to make generaliza-\ntions to the U.S. population. Third, we limited to females\nwhose first pregnancies occurred during adolescence,\nafter Wave I and ended with a singleton live birth to en-\nsure the temporal ordering of predictors and outcomes\n(n = 978). Finally, we limited to females with complete\ninformation on all covariates. This left us with an ana-\nlysis sample of 763 teen singleton live births.\nMeasures\nOutcomes\nAt Wave IV girls were asked about previous pregnancies\nand their outcomes. If they indicated they had given\nbirth, they were asked \"How much did the baby weigh at\nbirth?\", \"Was [baby's name] born before or after [his/\nher] due date?\" and then \"How many weeks or days\nearly/late was [baby's name] born?\" This was subtracted\nfrom 40 weeks to calculate gestational age. Birthweight\nwas examined in kilograms and gestational age was ex-\namined in weeks.\nPredictors\nAcademic performance\nWe measured adolescents' grade point average (GPA)\nbased on their self-reported school performance in four\nsubjects in Wave I in-home interview: English or language\narts, mathematics, history or social studies, and science.\nLetter grades of A, B, C, and D were coded as 4, 3, 2, and\n1, respectively and were averaged and dichotomized at the\nmedian (median = 2.5). In Wave I in-home interview ado-\nlescents were also asked whether they had ever skipped a\ngrade [yes/no] and repeated a grade [yes/no].\nEducational aspiration\nAdolescents' educational aspiration was measured from\nthree questions in Wave I in-home interview asking how\nmuch they wanted to go to college, how likely they were\nto go to college, and how disappointed the adolescent\nthought his/her mother would be if the adolescent did\nnot graduate from college. Responses were provided in a\n5-point Likert scale, with higher scores indicating higher\nexpectation or likelihood of going to college. Because of\nthe likely high correlation between these items, we con-\nducted a polychoric principal factor analysis with vari-\nmax rotation among the three questions, and the results\nsuggested a single-factor solution (factor loading: 0.74,\ntional aspiration scale by summing the items weighted\nby their factor loadings, with higher score indicating\nhigher aspiration for college education. In bivariate and\nmultivariable analyses, we standardized the score so that\nthe regression coefficients represent change in outcome\nwith a one-standard deviation change in the educational\naspiration score.\nWe examined correlation among all predictor variables\n(i.e., GPA, grade skipping, grade repeating, and educa-\ntional aspiration) and found low correlations, with poly-\nMediators\nBased on prior literature, we included measures of smok-\ning during pregnancy and timing of prenatal care visit as\npotential mediators of maternal education variables and\nbirth outcomes. Smoking during pregnancy was assessed\nat Wave IV for each pregnancy reported. Respondents\nwere asked to report on an ordinal scale how many ciga-\nrettes they smoked during their pregnancy (none/a few\ncigarettes but not every week/a few cigarettes a week but\nday/31 or more a day). We dichotomized responses due\nto sparseness across smoker frequencies in the sample.\nThe timing of prenatal care initiation was based on two\nquestions asked about each pregnancy reported at Wave\nIV: \"During this pregnancy with [partner] did you ever\nvisit a doctor, nurse-midwife or other health care\nprovider for prenatal care, that is, for one or more preg-\nnancy check-ups?\" and \"How many weeks pregnant were\nyou at the time of your first prenatal care visit?\" Re-\nsponses to these two questions were combined and cate-\ngorized into three groups: initiated in the first trimester;\ninitiated in the second trimester; and initiated in the\nthird trimester or no prenatal care.\nControls\nWe drew upon our previous analysis of predictors of birth\noutcomes in this cohort to determine confounders [39]. This\nanalysis indicated effects of race, age at pregnancy, age at\nWave I, body mass index (BMI) categories and parental edu-\ncation. Parental education was measured as the higher of ei-\nther co-residential mother or father: less than high school\ndiploma, high school diploma/GED or higher. BMI was cat-\negorized into four groups: underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2),\nAnalyses\nAll analyses were conducted in SAS (SAS Institute, Cary,\nNorth Carolina) using survey procedures, which apply\npopulation weights and adjust standard errors for non-\nindependence between respondents due to school-based\nsampling. We began with descriptive statistics (means\nand percentages) for all analysis variables, then con-\nducted bivariate analyses (t-test, ANOVA or linear re-\ngression) to test the crude relationships between analysis\nvariables and birth outcomes. Finally, we implemented\nmultivariable linear regression models to examine the\nrelationship between maternal academic performance\nand educational aspiration and birth outcomes after con-\ntrolling for other individual and family characteristics. For\neach birth outcome (birthweight, gestational age), we ex-\namined two models: one without potential mediator vari-\nables and the other with potential mediators. Mediation\nwas assessed based on change in effect estimates after in-\nclusion of the mediating variables [41]. Analyses were run\nstratified on race (Black / non-Black) given prior literature\nsuggesting different associations between maternal educa-\ntion and birth outcomes according to race [9]. Significance\ntesting was conducted at  = 0.05.\nResults\nThe characteristics of the study population are presented\nin Table 1. Average age at Wave I, when girls' academic\nperformance and educational aspiration were examined,\nwas about 15 for both Black and non-Black girls. This\nwas on average about two years before they gave birth.\nBlack adolescent mothers had lower birth weight and a\nsmaller proportion with GPA above median compared\nwith non-Black mothers. The educational aspiration was\nhigher in Black adolescents than in non-Black adoles-\ncents. A larger proportion of non-Black girls ever\nsmoked during pregnancy than that in Black girls.\nIn bivariate analysis, none of the education variables\nwas significantly associated with offspring's birthweight\namong Black adolescents while higher educational aspir-\nation and ever skipping a grade were related with higher\nbirthweight in non-Black adolescents. Smoking during\npregnancy was positively related with birth weight among\nBlack adolescents (Table 2). Ever skipping a grade was also\npositively associated with offspring's gestational age in\nnon-Black girls. Smoking during pregnancy was associated\nwith higher gestational age among Black adolescents\n(Table 3).\nMultivariable analysis of birthweight is presented in\nTable 4. Among Black adolescents, ever skipping a grade\nwas associated with 200 grams increase in their off-\nspring's birthweight when controlling for other variables\n(p = 0.04). Among non-Black adolescents, ever skipping\na grade and higher educational aspiration were associ-\nspectively). After adding the two potential mediators (i.\ne., smoking during pregnancy and prenatal care visit),\nthe associations between the main predictors and birth-\nweight remained largely the same, suggesting no medi-\nation (model 2, Table 4). However, smoking during\npregnancy was significantly positively associated with\nbirthweight in Black girls.\nTable 1 Characteristics of teen mothers whose first pregnancy occurred during adolescence and after wave 1 at the\nBaseline BMI category (n [%]) 0.03\nParental education ([n%]) 0.41\nEver skipped a grade (n [%]) 0.85\nEver repeated a grade (n [%]) 0.20\nInitiation of prenatal care (n [%]) 0.58\n*Range of Educational aspiration score (non-standardized):-3.46, 1.23.\nFor gestational age (Table 5), none of the education\nvariables was significantly related to birth outcomes in\nBlack adolescent girls. Among non-Black adolescents,\nthose who ever skipped a grade had around one week in-\ncrease in offspring's gestational age (p = 0.03). The\naddition of the two potential mediators did not change\nthe association between grade skipping and offspring's\ngestational age. Similar to the bivariate analysis, smoking\nduring pregnancy was associated with increased gesta-\ntional age among Black adolescents.\nPost-hoc analysis\nAs our study sample is a selected one including females\nwhose first pregnancies occurred during adolescence\nand ended with a singleton live birth, we were con-\ncerned about potential sample selection biases that\nmight have influenced our findings. We did a post-hoc\nanalysis examining whether maternal academic perform-\nance and educational aspiration during adolescence pre-\ndicted the likelihood of having teen pregnancy. Among\n6,497 adolescent girls with valid sampling weight and\nhad teen pregnancy. Among Black girls (n = 1,491),\nbelow-average GPA was associated with a higher risk of\nteen pregnancy (Odds Ratio [OR] = 2.22, 95% Confi-\n(n = 5,006), below-average GPA, ever skipping a grade,\nand ever repeating a grade were related with a higher\nnegatively associated with the risk of teen pregnancy.\nTable 2 Bivariate analysis between maternal characteristics, education variables and birthweight (kg) (N = 763)*\ninteraction\n(se) P (se) P\nNormal weight ref ref\nHS ref ref\nAbove average ref ref\nNo ref ref\nNo ref ref\nNo ref ref\n1st trimester ref ref\n*Figures presented are regression coefficients with standard errors.\nDiscussion\nEducational goals and achievements are likely to be par-\nticularly important for adolescents, as school is their\nmajor social and occupational context [42]. However,\nmost studies that linked maternal education with birth\noutcomes used maternal educational attainment in\nadulthood or at the child's birth [8-12,14]. Few studies\nhave explored whether academic performance and edu-\ncational aspiration during adolescence are associated\nwith birth outcomes among adolescent mothers. In this\nstudy, data were collected prospectively, which allowed\nus to assess academic performance and educational as-\npiration prior to the teen pregnancy.\nMultivariable analysis indicated that higher aspiration\nfor college education was related to higher birthweight\namong non-Black adolescents. Higher educational aspir-\nation could indicate a greater future orientation and\ngreater social support [43] which would be associated\nwith healthier pregnancies through health-protective be-\nhaviors, such as good nutrition and physical activity\n[44]. On the other hand, girls who do not have high as-\npiration for their educational futures may be reflecting a\nfamily or community not generally supportive of the girl\nor her goals, which might translate to reduced social\nsupport during pregnancy [45]. It also might indicate\ntheir life circumstances, which could include poor health\nor a community that does not have many people going\nto college [46,47]. This may be part of a fatalistic attitude\ntowards pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes, which\nmight lead to poorer self-care.\nWe found that grade skipping was associated with\nhigher birthweight and gestational age among non-Black\ngirls, as well as higher birthweight among Black girls.\nGrade skipping is one way to accomplish the concept of\nTable 3 Bivariate analysis between maternal characteristics, education variables and gestational age (week) (N = 763)*\ninteraction\n(se) P (se) P\nNormal weight ref ref\nHS ref ref\nAbove average ref ref\nNo ref ref\nNo ref ref\nNo ref ref\n1st trimester ref ref\n*Figures presented are regression coefficients with standard errors.\nappropriate developmental placement [27,48]. It allows\nintellectually precocious students to experience more\ndevelopmentally appropriate content by skipping over\nwhat they have already known or can easily learn [49]. It\nhas been suggested to have merit as the intellectually tal-\nented students potentially gain intellectual development,\ninterpersonal maturity and time when they advance\nmore quickly through the educational system [27]. It is\npossible that adolescents who were accelerated had\ngreater social support [50] and personal resilience and\nthus have healthier lifestyles and behaviors during preg-\nnancy which lead to better birth outcomes.\nNo statistically significant relationship was found be-\ntween adolescents' GPA and either of the birth out-\ncomes. However, we observed that among non-Black\nadolescents, those whose GPA was below average had\nhigher birthweight and gestational age than those with\nGPA above average and the magnitude of the coeffi-\ncients was larger than that for grade skipping. It is pos-\nsible that this finding is (partly) due to the imperfect\nmeasurement of adolescents' GPA; adolescents may have\nmis-reported their letter grades in Wave I in-home\ninterview. Nonetheless, this was an unexpected finding.\nWe tested the interaction between GPA and grade skip-\nping, as well as interaction between GPA and grade re-\npeating, to determine whether a low GPA represented\nmore challenging courses relative to age, but neither was\nstatistically significant (p > 0.05).\nPast studies suggested that the effect of maternal edu-\ncation on birth outcomes could be accounted for by the\nhealth-related risk behaviors, particularly maternal smo-\nking and alcohol use during pregnancy and late entry\nthe addition of smoking during pregnancy and prenatal\nTable 4 Multivariable analysis between maternal characteristics, educational variables and birthweight (kg) (N = 763)\nBaseline BMI category\nNormal weight ref ref ref ref\nParental education\nHS ref ref ref ref\nGPA\nAbove average ref ref ref ref\nEver skipped a grade\nNo ref ref ref ref\nEver repeated a grade\nNo ref ref ref ref\nSmoking during pregnancy\nNo ref ref\nInitiation of prenatal care\n1st trimester ref ref\nFigures presented are regression coefficients with standard errors.\ncare visit did not change the regression coefficients of\nthe education variables, thus there was little evidence of\na mediating effect of these factors. Among Black girls,\nwe were unable to examine the mediating effect of alco-\nhol use during pregnancy due to small cells (i.e. only\nfour girls ever used alcohol during pregnancy). Among\nnon-Black girls, the addition of alcohol use during preg-\nnancy did not change the regression coefficients of the\neducation variables (See Additional file 1: Table S1). There\nwas no relationship between education variables and po-\ntential mediator variables. It would be interesting to ex-\nplore alternative pathways that might explain the effect of\nadolescent educational aspiration and grade skipping on\nbirth outcomes.\nSurprisingly, we found that smoking during pregnancy\nwas positively related to Black adolescent mothers'\nbirthweight and gestational age. This finding is inconsist-\nent with extensive literature documenting increased risk\nof adverse birth outcomes with smoking during preg-\nnancy [51]. It is possible that this unexpected result is\ndue to the very small number of Black adolescent\nmothers who reported any smoking during pregnancy\n(n = 14), which may lead to spurious results. It may also\nbe due to sample selection biases, since our sample was\nlimited to mothers who experienced a pregnancy as an\nadolescent and had a singleton live birth, or reporting\nbiases. Given these potential issues with the ascertain-\nment of smoking during pregnancy, results should be\ninterpreted with caution.\nIn the post-hoc analysis, we found that lower GPA was\nrelated with a higher risk of teen pregnancy in both\nBlack and non-Black girls, and that higher educational\nTable 5 Multivariable analysis between maternal characteristics, educational variables and gestational age\nBaseline BMI category\nNormal weight ref ref ref ref\nParental education\nHS ref ref ref ref\nGPA\nAbove average ref ref ref ref\nEver skipped a grade\nNo ref ref ref ref\nEver repeated a grade\nNo ref ref ref ref\nSmoking during pregnancy\nNo ref ref\nInitiation of prenatal care\n1st trimester ref ref\nFigures presented are regression coefficients with standard errors.\naspiration was related with a lower risk of teen preg-\nnancy in non-Black girls. Our findings were consistent\nwith existing literature which suggests that better grades\nin school and/or higher educational aspirations are asso-\nciated with postponed sexual activities [52-55]. On the\nother hand, Tucker et al. did not find a significant asso-\nciation between parental educational expectations and\nteen pregnancy using data from Add Health [56]. How-\never, the authors used parents' educational expectations\n[56] while we examined adolescents' own educational as-\npiration. Among non-Black girls, those who ever re-\npeated a grade were more likely to experience teen\npregnancy. This is consistent with evidence from exist-\ning studies that students who are over-age for grade ex-\nperience a higher level of emotional stress and more\nbehavioral problems, including substance abuse and\nearly sexual debut [57-59]. We found that grade skipping\nwas related with a higher risk of having teen pregnancy\namong non-Black girls, which is an unexpected finding.\nThere were 24 non-Black girls who ever skipped a grade\nand had teen pregnancy. With this relatively small cell\nsize, the possibility that this finding is due to chance\ncannot be ruled out. These results suggest that adoles-\ncent girls' academic performance and educational aspir-\nation influence both the likelihood of getting pregnant\nas a teenager and birth outcomes of teenage pregnancy.\nOur findings suggest that interventions that affect ado-\nlescents' educational aspirations and grade acceleration\nmight have positive effects on birth outcomes should the\nadolescent become pregnant. It has been found that both\npersonal and social attributes are important factors that\ninfluence educational aspiration and grade acceleration\nand enjoyment of school as well as a sense of affinity in-\ncreases the probability of putting further education into\nthe plan. A friendly atmosphere at school and perceived\nsupport from parents are also influential with regard to\nadolescents' educational motivation [61]. Wells et al.\n[50] found that children with parents who more often\ndiscuss school programs, school activities, and things\nstudied in class were more likely to have grade acceler-\nation. Thus, the development of a supportive family and\nschool environment is important in stimulating educa-\ntional aspiration and promoting academic performance,\nwhich also has the benefit of being positively associated\nwith birth outcomes among adolescent mothers. In\naddition, efforts should be made to identify and place\nstudents in appropriate learning environment/grades\nOur study used a large, nationally-representative data-\nset. Measurement of exposures was made prior to out-\ncome data, which allows for the temporal inference\nbetween academic performance and educational expect-\nation and the birth outcomes. Despite these strengths,\nour study has several limitations. First, we used adoles-\ncents' self-reported letter grades rather than school tran-\nscript, which would have provided a more accurate and\nreliable measure of adolescents' academic performance.\nThe measurement of grade retention was also subject to\nreporting bias. Second, we reduced our sample size by\nrequiring complete covariate data, which could bias our\nstudy results. Analyses comparing included (n = 763)\nversus excluded (n = 215) adolescents indicated no sig-\nnificant difference in birthweight (p = 0.71), gestational\ngrade skipping (p = 0.20), adolescents' educational aspir-\nand prenatal care visit (p = 0.17). However, there were\n0.44 in included and excluded sample, respectively; p =\nin included and excluded sample, respectively; p < 0.001).\nThird, we relied on maternal self-reports of both birth-\nweight and gestational age, which may be subject to re-\ncall biases. However, past studies comparing birth\nrecords to maternal self-report have found maternal re-\nports of birth outcomes are largely a valid method of\nobtaining data [62].\nConclusions\nIn summary, we found that grade skipping was associ-\nated with higher offspring's birthweight among Black ad-\nolescents, and with higher birthweight and gestational\nage among non-Black adolescents. Higher educational\naspiration was associated with higher birthweight among\nnon-Black adolescents. Future research that explores the\npathways by which educational aspiration and grade\nskipping influence birth outcomes among adolescent\nmothers could add to our understanding of the determi-\nnants of outcomes of teen births. As is reflected in the\nnew Healthy People 2020 goals related to adolescent\nsuccess in school, a partnership between adolescent-\nserving clinicians, public health entities, and educational\ninstitutions is warranted to improve the well-being of\nboth pregnant and non-pregnant adolescents.\nAdditional file\nAdditional file 1: Table S1.
