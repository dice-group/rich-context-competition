    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe current research aims to investigate various factors that influence consumers' intention of buying foreign products. The\ndata were collected by means of self-structured questionnaires from a total of 260 Bangladeshi consumers residing in the\ntwo major cities of the country, Dhaka and Chittagong. At the initial stage, statistical analyses, particularly descriptive analysis\nas well as exploratory factor analysis, were conducted using SPSS, after which structural equation modeling was run by using\nAMOS. The findings have established that brand image and quality of foreign products carry significant positive influence on\npurchase intention of foreign products. However, religiosity leaves a significant negative effect on the purchase intention of\nforeign products. Furthermore, findings have also revealed that the image of the country of origin carries a significant positive\neffect on brand image but ethnocentrism carries a significant negative effect on perceptions about the quality of foreign\nproducts in their purchase intention. The major contribution of the current study is that it focuses on Bangladesh, as there\nis a vacuum in contemporary literature on this topic in the context of Bangladeshi consumers. The findings derived from the\nstudy could facilitate marketers in the creation of effective marketing strategies and at the same time are also valuable for\nacademicians as well as consumers at large.\n",

Such is the pressure to make their presence noticeable\nglobally that many companies are inevitably spreading their\nwings beyond their national boundaries and expanding inter-\nnationally. As a matter of fact, international expansion and\ndistribution of products beyond national borders is a result of\nthe emergence of two important phenomena, namely, global-\nization and the falling of trade barriers through the establish-\nment of different kinds of international organizations and\nassociations. At present, the globally connected marketplace\nand reviewing what influences consumers' intention of pur-\nchasing foreign products have evolved as topics of much\nimportance. Studies have been conducted in different regions\nof the world with the intention of understanding what actu-\nally affects consumers' purchase intention of foreign prod-\nThis is partly driven by the realization that consumers\nfrom different countries are distinct from each other not only\nculturally (Sohail & Sahin, 2010) but also economically and\ndemographically (Essoussi & Merunka, 2007). Under such\ncircumstances, studies conducted in the context of one coun-\ntry cannot be easily generalized in the context of another\ncountry (Sohail & Sahin, 2010). To understand which factors\nare affecting consumers' intention of purchasing foreign\nproducts, it is important to conduct research in the context of\ndifferent countries as consumers are unique in their spending\npreferences.\nAvailable literature reveals that previous studies have\nbeen conducted in the context of different countries with the\n1International Islamic University Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\n2Management and Science University Malaysia, Shah Alam, Malaysia\n3Multimedia University, Cyberjaya, Malaysia\nCorresponding Author:\nAhasanul Haque, International Islamic University Malaysia, Box No 10,\nEmail: belaliium@gmail.com\nPurchase Intention of Foreign Products:\nA Study on Bangladeshi Consumer\nPerspective\nAhasanul Haque1, Naila Anwar1, Farzana Yasmin2,\nAbdullah Sarwar3, Zariyah Ibrahim1, and Abdul Momen1\n Keywords\nforeign products, purchase intention, image of country of origin, brand image, religiosity, ethnocentrism, product quality\n2 SAGE Open\nobjective of identifying which factors affect consumers'\nintention of buying foreign products: America (Shimp &\nand Taiwan (Lin & Chen, 2006); China and Japan (X. Wang\nKingdom (Diamantopoulos, Schlegelmilch, & Palihawadana,\nMalaysia (Haque et al., 2011; Tabassi, Esmaeilzadeh, &\nSambasivan, 2012). Even though much is known in aca-\ndemic literature regarding this topic in the context of differ-\nent countries, there is a scarcity of research on this issue\npertaining directly to Bangladesh. Thus, it is imperative that\nthis study is conducted to gain insights into what influences\nBangladeshi consumers' intentions to purchase foreign\nproducts.\nLiterature Review\nPurchase Intention\nTraditionally, the term intention is defined as the antecedents\nthat stimulate and drive consumers' purchases of products\nand services (Hawkins & Mothersbaugh, 2010). One of the\nmost common approaches undertaken by marketers in gain-\ning an understanding about consumers' actual behavior is\nthrough studying their intentions (Blackwell, Miniard, &\nPysarchik (2000) have demonstrated the existence of a strong\ncorrelation between these two respective constructs. Hence,\nthey assert that purchase intention serves as an alternative for\nmeasuring consumers' purchase behavior. Therefore, con-\nsumers' intention toward a particular behavior has remained\nthe central focus of well-known theories like theory of rea-\nsoned action (TRA).\nThis claim is also supported by Azjen (1991) who men-\ntion that intention is the factor that motivates consumers and\nin turn influences their behavior. To a greater extent, it\nreveals how hard consumers are willing to try, as well as the\namount of effort they intend to exert for performing a respec-\ntive behavior. According to them, the probability that a par-\nticular behavior will actually be performed by individuals\nlargely relies on the strength of their intentions. When the\nintentions of performing certain behavior are strong, there\nare higher likelihoods that the respective behavior will be\nperformed.\nImage of the Country of Origin\nFollowing the classic work by Schooler dating back to 1965,\nsome 700 studies have been conducted in different parts of the\nglobe by prominent researchers on the topic of country of ori-\ngin (Essoussi & Merunka, 2007). The numerous studies con-\nducted on country of origin have eventually made it an essential\ntool (Ryan, 2008) and indeed a phenomenon in the arena of\ninternational marketing and consumer behavior (Sohail &\ntry of origin has occupied an integral position in understand-\ning consumers' behavior in the literature of international\nmarketing, specifically consumers' preferences and pur-\nchases of foreign products (Kumara & Canhua, 2009; Zhang,\n1996). Several researchers have noted that country of origin\nis the place where the corporate headquarters of the company\na product or brand belongs to is located (Kim & Pysarchik,\n2000; Thanasuta, Patoomsuwan, Chaimahawong, &\nmentioned by Laroche, Papadopoulos, Heslop, and Mourali\n(2005) that the importance of products' origin has increased\ntoday due to trade liberalization among foreign countries and\nglobalization of national economies. Thus, in their words,\nwith the inception of the first-ever work on country of origin\nby Schooler, the study of product origin has turned into one\nof the most lucrative research areas in the arena of interna-\ntional marketing.\nKoubaa (2008) has also stated that the image of the coun-\ntry from where a particular brand originates remarkably\naffects consumers' perception of the brand's image. From a\nsimilar perspective, it has been noted by Hsieh, Pan, and\nSetiono (2004) that when consumers hold a favorable per-\nception toward a brand's country of origin they appreciate\nbrands from that particular country, which in turn enhances\nthe brand's image; on the contrary, a country's negative\nimage in the eyes of the consumers prevents them from pur-\nchasing its brands. Thus, consumers' intention to purchase\nbrands is in harmony with their impressions about the image\nof the products' country of origin. It has been revealed that\ncountry of origin's image directly affects consumers pur-\nchase intention (Josiassen & Assaf, 2010; X. Wang & Yang,\n2008). However, other researchers such as Diamantopoulos\net al. (2011) have shown that country of origin's image\naffects consumers' intention of buying foreign product\nthrough brand image. Based on the above discussion, the fol-\nlowing hypotheses are drawn:\nHypothesis 1 (H1): Country of origin image has a signifi-\ncant positive effect on brand image.\nHypothesis 6 (H6): Brand image mediates the relation-\nship between country of origin image and purchase\nintention.\nReligiosity\nReligion is one of the most vital elements in the lives of\nevery individual (Khraim, 2010) because people from differ-\nent religious backgrounds are obligated to follow the princi-\nples and beliefs prescribed by their respective religions\n(Rehman & Shabbir, 2010). Religion cannot be considered a\nmere short-lived fad that changes over time; rather, it is a\npermanent pillar that remains in the lives of believers forever\n(Khraim, 2010). As a matter of fact, religion is one of the\nmost prominent aspects in society, influencing every aspect\nHaque et al. 3\nof a person's life, lifestyle, attitude, belief, behavior, and\nvides people with a value system and, most importantly,\ngives them their identity (Essoo & Dibb, 2004). Religion is\nan important factor that guides peoples' consumption habits\nand at the same time has an influential impact on their pur-\nchases of products as consumers from different religions are\nencouraged to abide by their religious principles in their\nselection of products (Essoo & Dibb, 2004). Even though\nreligion affects individuals' behavior and their consumption\nhabits, it has been explained by Mukhtar and Butt (2012) that\nits impact varies from individual to individual in accordance\nto their religiosities.\nPrior literature reveals that the construct of religiosity has\nbeen extended to studying consumers' purchase intention of\nand how religiosity is associated with consumers' intention\nof purchasing products that come from foreign countries.\nThe result of the study has revealed that as consumers'religi-\nosity increases, their intention of buying products coming\nfrom foreign countries decreases. Similar results have also\nbeen demonstrated by Tabassi et al. (2012). It has been\nrevealed by them that consumers are unwilling to purchase\nproducts from foreign countries as religiosities of consumers\nare negatively associated with their intention of purchasing\nthese products. Based on the above discussion, the following\nhypothesis is drawn:\nHypothesis 2 (H2): Religiosity has a significant negative\neffect on purchase intention of foreign products.\nEthnocentrism\nThe sociological concept of ethnocentrism's origin can be\ntraced back to the early 20th century, with the pioneering\nwork of Sumner (1906). It is solely a social factor that\nrevolves around the notion that individuals tend to perceive\ntheir own group (known as in-group) as superior (Sumner,\n1906). As such, individuals who belong to the same group\nare considered in-groups and individuals who do not belong\nto the group are considered out-groups and are believed to be\nharmful to the in-group (Ueltschy, 1998). Thus, it has been\nstated by Chryssochoidis, Krystallis, and Perreas (2007) that\nthe division of individuals into two distinct groups (in-group\nand out-group) makes ethnocentrism a concept that is dichot-\nomous in nature.\nWatson and Wright (2000) have investigated the effect of\nethnocentrism on consumers'attitude toward foreign products\nin the case where the local market does not provide a domestic\nsubstitute for particular product(s). The results of the study\nhave shown that ethnocentric consumers favor products that\ncome from neighboring nations that have similar cultural\nbackgrounds. Consumer ethnocentrism also plays a role in the\nquality evaluation of foreign versus domestic products.\nEthnocentric consumers tend to perceive the quality of local\nproducts as superior to the quality of foreign products (C. L.\nWang & Chen, 2004). Similar statements have also been\nmade by a number of past studies as their findings have\nrevealed that ethnocentrism leads to an unfavorable effect on\nforeign products' quality, and later, foreign products' quality\npositively affects consumers' intention of purchasing the\nDonthu, 2005). Based on the above discussion, the following\nhypotheses are drawn:\nHypothesis 3 (H3): Ethnocentrism has a significant neg-\native effect on quality of foreign products.\nHypothesis 7 (H7): Foreign product quality mediates the\nrelationship between ethnocentrism and purchase\nintention.\nBrand Image\nIn the study of marketing, branding has emerged as an inte-\ngral concept (Meenaghan, 1995). Through the years, schol-\nars have described the concept of branding in different ways\n(Meenaghan, 1995). Brand image is a result of the marketing\nactivities that are undertaken by companies (Hsiung, 2011).\nHawkins and Mothersbaugh (2010) have noted that brand\nimage, in essence, is the thought that arises in peoples'minds\nwhen they come across certain brands. In examining the\neffect of brand image on consumers' loyalty toward brands,\nit has been stated by Hu, Jou, and Liu (2009) that brand\nimage is comprised of three components, namely, the image\nof the product itself, followed by the corporation's image,\nand finally the image of competitors'brands. It has been con-\ncluded by them that for enhancing consumers'loyalty toward\na brand, it is important to improve the image of the product\nas well as the corporate image.\nYagci (2001) has found that brand image is a significant\nfactor that not only plays an influential role in affecting con-\nsumers' quality perception and attitude toward products but,\nat the same time, also plays an influential role in consumers'\npurchases of products as it is a strong predictor of consum-\ners' purchase intention as well. On the reverse side, the\nopposite has been uncovered by Eze, Yee and Wamala\n(2012) as consumers did not form their intentions of pur-\nchasing products based on the image of the brand, indicating\nthat brand name is not prioritized by consumers in making\ntheir purchases. Moreover, Shah et al. (2012) have studied\nhow consumers'purchase intentions are affected by the con-\ncept of branding. According to them, a product's core brand\nimage is comprised of two elements, namely, brand knowl-\nedge and brand preference, and both elements affected\nintention of purchasing as expected. In examining what fac-\ntors affect Iranian consumers' purchase intention of foreign\nproducts, it has been revealed by Fakharmanesh and\nMiyandehi (2013) that brand image is one of the important\nfactors; thus, they have concluded that consumers rely on\nbrand image when intending to purchase foreign products.\nBased on the above discussion, the following hypothesis is\ndrawn:\n4 SAGE Open\nHypothesis 4 (H4): Brand image has a significant posi-\ntive effect on purchase intention of foreign products.\nForeign Product Quality\nKirmani and Baumgartner (2000) have pointed that a prod-\nuct's quality is the extrinsic and intrinsic cue that is taken\ninto consideration by consumers in evaluating its perfor-\nmance. Consumers' assessment of quality has also been con-\nsidered an attitudinal judgment based on which consumers\nevaluate the extent to which brands fulfill their expectations\n(Rafi, Ali, Saqib, Choudhary, & Akhtar, 2012). C. L. Wang,\nChen, Chan, and Zheng (2000) have pointed out that quality\nresembles the functional value of a product, which in turn\nmotivates consumers in making their choices. It has been\nnoted by C. L. Wang and Chen (2004) that Chinese consum-\ners' perception regarding the quality of products is an influ-\nential predictor of their purchase intention for both local and\nforeign products. Similarly, product quality is one of the ele-\nments highly taken into consideration by consumers from\ndeveloping countries such as Pakistan when they purchase\nnonlocal products, as revealed by Khattak, Saeed, and Shah\n(2011). Prior study has shown that in the purchase of foreign\nproducts, ethnocentrism is an important factor that has the\npotential of affecting consumers' perception toward foreign\nproducts' quality; therefore, consumer ethnocentrism is an\ninfluential factor that is considered by consumers in evaluat-\ning the quality of foreign goods (Mostafa, 2010). Several\npast studies have taken into account the relationship between\nethnocentrism and the quality of foreign products when it\ncomes to understanding consumers'intention of buying these\nDonthu, 2005). In accordance with their findings, ethnocen-\ntrism has a negative effect on imported products' quality and\nthe latter leaves a positive effect on consumers' intention of\npurchasing foreign products. Based on the above discussion,\nthe following hypothesis is drawn:\nHypothesis 5 (H5): Quality of foreign products has a sig-\nnificant positive effect on purchase intention of foreign\nproducts.\nProposed Framework of the Research\nAs represented in Figure 1, the theoretical framework of the\nresearch concentrates on consumers' purchase intention of\nforeign products based on the variables extracted from the\nliterature review, namely, country of origin image, brand\nimage, religiosity, ethnocentrism, and foreign product quality.\nThe model links all these respective variables together in one\nframe and also illustrates how they are related to each other.\nFrom the figure below, it can be seen that the framework is\ncomprised of one dependent variable (purchase intention),\ntwo mediating variables (brand image and foreign product\nquality), and three independent variables (country of origin\nimage, religiosity, and ethnocentrism). In addition, it also\nreveals the basis on which the hypotheses have been derived.\nMethod\nAs the study at hand upholds the objective of exploring the\nfactors affecting consumers' intention of buying foreign\nproducts, particularly concentrating on Bangladeshi consum-\ners, it is essential to build the study by collecting data from\nFigure 1. Framework of the research.\nHaque et al. 5\nthe consumers of Bangladesh to make sure that the data col-\nlected are a good representation of the Bangladeshi popula-\ntion. The data required for the study have been gathered\nthrough the distribution of self-administered questionnaires.\nAll the items were developed based on the literature review.\nInitially, the questionnaire was developed in English and\nlater it was translated into Bengali with the help of a profes-\nsional translator. The key reason for translating the questions\ninto Bengali was to make it convenient for the respondents to\nunderstand as well as answer the questions appropriately.\nThe items were then pretested on a sample of 38 respondents,\nincluding experts, to see whether the items were understand-\nable to the respondents. Based on the feedback, a few items\nwere rephrased and a few items were deleted from the final\nversion of the questionnaire. For reliability analysis,\nCronbach's alpha test was carried out. An alpha value of .878\nshows the high reliability of the questionnaire. Hence, the\nresults of the study showed that the questions in the question-\nnaire were reliable and valid, which indicated that the ques-\ntionnaire can be utilized for collecting data for the actual\nstudy.\nAs the study at hand upholds the objective of exploring\nthe factors affecting consumers' intention of buying foreign\nproducts, particularly concentrating on Bangladeshi consum-\ners, it is essential to build the study by collecting data from\nthe consumers of Bangladesh to make sure that the data col-\nlected are a good representation of the Bangladeshi popula-\ntion. A convenience sampling method has been employed to\ncollect the required data from the two major cities of the\ncountry, Dhaka and Chittagong. The underlying reason for\nspecifically selecting these two destinations rests on the fact\nthat Dhaka and Chittagong are the main cities of the country.\nThese two cities have innumerable shopping malls, with the\nwidest variety and array of foreign (imported) products.\nCurrently, there are 43 shopping malls in Dhaka city and 29\nshopping malls in Chittagong city (Wikipedia, 2014). As\nsuch, this study has decided to cover 30% of the shopping\nmalls, which were selected randomly, for data collection.\nBased on the ratio, 22 malls were selected from Dhaka city\nand 9 malls were selected from Chittagong city. Moreover,\nthese two cities have the highest number of foreign products\nin the local market, as well as consumers who have the high-\nest interaction with foreign products. One of the main advan-\ntages of convenience sampling method is that this specific\nmethod greatly helps researchers gather the required data\nfrom a sizable number of respondents in a relatively short\nspan of time (Hair, Babin, Money, & Samouel, 2003; Hair,\nThe respondents were requested to answer the questions\non a 7-point rating scale, where 1 stands for strongly dis-\nagree and 7 stands for strongly agree. Initially, 260 question-\nnaires were given out to Bangladeshi consumers in different\nshopping malls in the cities of Dhaka and Chittagong. This is\nbecause this study has used structural equation modeling\n(SEM) for data analysis, where the minimum sample size\nrequired is 200 to conduct such analysis, as suggested by\nthe appropriate size of a sample for most of the research proj-\nects is a sample size that consists of more than 30 samples\nbut is less than 500. Thus, in reference to this particular rule,\nthe sample size of the study at hand is 260 (detailed data\ndistribution is presented in Table 1). However, for the pur-\npose of the study, 30 questionnaires were discarded, as they\nwere not fully completed by the respondents, as a result of\nwhich 230 questionnaires were used for statistical analysis.\nHence, this justifies the sample size used in this study as the\nAt the initial stage, descriptive analysis as well as validity\ntesting through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was con-\nducted through SPSS. According to Hair et al. (2009), it is\nimportant to conduct EFA as it helps researchers in summa-\nrizing the information gathered from a particular set of data.\nLater, SEM was run through AMOS to test the measurement\nmodel and, finally, analysis was completed by testing the\nfull-fledged structural model and verifying the hypotheses\nthat have been derived for the study.\nResults and Discussions\nRespondents' Demographic Profile\nOf the participants, 63% were male while 37% were female.\nIn the survey conducted, most of the participants were in the\nthe participants were in the age group of 30 to 39 years while\nof the participants were below the age of 20. A small percent-\nage of the participants were in the age group of 50 to 59 years\n(3.5%). The minority of the participants were in the age\nthe total participants. Most of the participants were Muslims,\nBuddhists, and 2.2% were Christians. In terms of academic\nqualification of the respondents, 35.7% had master's degrees,\nschool, 13.9% had completed secondary school, and 5.8% of\nthe participants had PhDs.\nEFA\nHair et al. (2009) have mentioned that it is important to con-\nduct factor analysis, as it helps researchers in summarizing\nthe information gathered from a particular set of data.\nHowever, prior to proceeding with EFA, two tests, namely,\nKaiser\u00adMeyer\u00adOlkin (KMO) and Bartlett's Test of\nSphericity, should be verified for checking the factorability\nof data (Pallant, 2007). Tabachnick, Fidell, and Osterlind\n(2001) have indicated that the value of the first test (KMO)\nranges from 0 to 1, and for an appropriate analysis it is\nimportant to have at least a value of 0.6, and for the latter\n6 SAGE Open\n(Bartlett's Test of Sphericity) it is important to attain a sig-\nnificant p value (p < .05). After running both of these respec-\ntive tests through SPSS, it was observed that the results of\nboth fell within the acceptable range, indicating that the\nresearcher can run EFA. The outcomes of the tests are shown\nbelow in Table 2.\nFrom EFA, 20 items have been derived and all the items\nare considered to be significant as they managed to load\nwith a value greater than 0.50, and any loading above this\nvalue is considered to be practically significant by Hair et al.\n(2009). All the five respective components successfully\nattained eigenvalues higher than one, as recommended by\nPallant (2007); in total, all the five components together\nCronbach's alpha has also been calculated for all the items\nof the five variables. It can be seen that all items under each\nof the variables are reliable as they all have surpassed the\nminimum value of .60 suggested by Hair, Black, Babin, and\nFitness Assessment of the Structural Model\nFor gauging the fitness of a particular model to a set of data,\nit is obligatory for researchers to employ several goodness-\nof-fit statistics (Brown, 2006).All the fit indices that are used\nfor assessing a model's fitness fall generally under three dif-\nferent respective categories of fitness, which are commonly\nknown as absolute fit, incremental fit, and parsimonious fit\nEach of the categories is comprised of a number of different\ntypes of indices as well as their required values (Table 4).\nTable 2.

Therefore, it can be stated that in\nthe case of Bangladeshi consumers, ethnocentrism does\ncarry a negative effect on the quality of foreign product. H4\nwas also not rejected as the standardized regression weight =\nsignificance for regression weight = .002. Therefore, brand\nimage is highly taken into account by Bangladeshi consum-\ners during the purchase of imported products. Last, the qual-\nity factor of foreign products also plays a significant role\nwhen Bangladeshi consumers are buying foreign products as\nindicated by the structural path, with standardized regression\nand level of significance for regression weight = significant\nat p value 000. Therefore, H5 was also accepted.\nValidity testing. Besides the baseline model, the study needs\nto consider the overall measurement model to test the valid-\nity of the analysis. To confirm construct validity of the study,\nit requires to assess convergent, discriminant, and face valid-\nity. Most of the factor loadings for each construct (more than\n.70), average variance extracted (AVE; more than .50), and\nconstruct reliability (more than .50) show the presence of\nconvergent validity, while discriminant validity is confirmed\nwith the positive difference between AVE and squared cor-\nrelation (r2) of the constructs. Here, in all cases AVE is big-\nger than squared multiple correlation value and gives the\nevidence of uniqueness for each construct. In addition, theo-\nretical support of the literature proves the face validity of the\nconstructs (see Table 7).\nTesting mediation effect. In addition to the five basic hypoth-\neses, the study also tends to test the mediation effect of brand\nimage and foreign product quality between country of origin\nand purchase intention, as well as ethnocentrism and pur-\nchase intention, respectively.

In addition, p of these effects should be significant\n(Rucker, Preacher, Tormala & Petty, 2011). For the case at\nhand, in seeking practical importance, the multiple effects of\nboth these relationships (.59 \u00d7 .28 = .16) is greater than the\nthreshold value (.08) and Sobel's test also shows the signifi-\ncant p value, which demonstrates the statistical significance.\nIn the same manner, to demonstrate the mediation effect\nof foreign products'quality, both the path coefficients of eth-\nnocentrism to foreign products'quality and foreign products'\nquality to purchase intention should be multiplied, whereas\nthe multiplication value should be greater than .08. In addi-\ntion, p of these effects should be significant (Rucker et al.,\n2011). For the case at hand, in seeking practical importance,\nthe multiple effects of both these relationships are very close\nto the threshold value (.08). Likewise, Sobel's test also shows\nthe significant p value, which demonstrates the statistical\nsignificance. Hence, it can be said that H6 and H7 are not\nrejected and brand image as well foreign products quality is\nthe mediator in the given relationship stated in the\nhypothesis.\nConclusion and Marketing\nImplementations\nThe results of the research have demonstrated that country of\norigin image does carry a significant positive effect on brand\nimage when it comes to Bangladeshi consumers'intention of\nbuying foreign products. Therefore, it is advised that market-\ners incorporate and emphasize the favorable match between\ncountry of origin image and brand image in the various mar-\nketing activities undertaken. However, in the event a certain\nbrand is affiliated with a less favorable image then it would\nbe a good decision for marketers to concentrate on other\nproduct attributes when advertising as well as promoting the\nproducts. In addition, another factor that carries a favorable\neffect on Bangladeshi consumers' intention of buying for-\neign products is brand image. Henceforth, to sell their prod-\nucts in this particular market, it is advised that marketers\nshould work toward creating favorable images of their\nbrands. Under such circumstances, it has been mentioned by\nBelch and Belch (2012) that one of the most popular means\nof improving brand image is through image advertising. At\nthe same time, the findings have also unveiled that\nBangladeshi consumers pay much attention to the quality of\nforeign products. In the future, initiatives must be taken by\nmarketers for informing the consumers about the superior\nquality of their products through advertisements.\nThe results of the study have also indicated that ethnocen-\ntrism is unfavorably associated with foreign product quality\nwhen it comes to Bangladeshi consumers' intention of buy-\ning imported products. Cateora and Graham (2007) have\nadvised that \"localisation\" is one of the most common ways\nthat can be undertaken by marketers to combat the negative\neffect of ethnocentrism. Therefore, marketers must try to\ngive local appeal to the foreign products by associating them\nwith local celebrities in advertisements, as well as creating\njoint ventures with local firms.\nFinally, the findings have shown that religiosity also car-\nries a negative effect on intention of purchasing foreign\nproducts. Therefore, to remain successful in the Bangladeshi\nmarket, it is vital for marketers to take into consideration and\nbe thoughtful toward consumers' religious beliefs when\ndeveloping their marketing strategies and activities.\nFrom a managerial perspective, this indicates that it is\nvital for marketers to tailor different strategies for consumers\nfrom different countries. This will assist marketers in craft-\ning meaningful marketing strategies that will enable them to\nappropriately position as well as sell foreign products, par-\nticularly in the Bangladeshi market. Besides, in the context\nof Bangladesh, it is also recommended that marketers should\ncreate favorable images of their brands in the minds of the\nconsumers to augment the impact on their intention of pur-\nchasing foreign products. Thus, in their marketing programs\nTable 6. Results of Hypothesis Testing.\nStructural path Estimate SE CR p\nNote. CR = critical ratio.\nTable 7. Validity Testing.\nConstruct Cronbach's  CR AVE\nNote. CR = critical ratio; AVE = average variance extracted.\nmarketers must give special attention toward informing con-\nsumers about the superior quality of their products.\nLimitations and Future Research\nThe main limitation of this study is that it strictly concen-\ntrates on Bangladeshi consumers; therefore, its findings can-\nnot be generalized to consumers from other countries. Hence,\nit is highly recommended that in the future the generalizabil-\nity of the results of the current study is tested by studying the\nproposed model in the setting of a new country where it has\nnot been studied yet and with a larger sample size. Besides,\nthe current study has studied consumers' intention of pur-\nchasing foreign products in general; it did not focus on any\nparticular category of products. In the future, researchers can\nstudy this phenomenon by taking into account specific prod-\nuct category. Moreover, as the proposed model of the current\nresearch stops at purchase intention, the researcher greatly\nencourages future researchers to extend the proposed frame-\nwork by adding actual purchase behavior to the framework,\nalong with other new mediating and moderating variables.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAboulnasr, K.
