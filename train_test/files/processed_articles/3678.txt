Being able to recognize and promote the uniqueness of\ndifferent groups of a diverse workforce is not only acknowledged as instrumental\nin improving performance, but also an imperative that organizations can no longer\nchoose to ignore. While there has been considerable academic debate on the value of\ndiversity, it is accepted that diversity adds both tangible and intangible value, even\nif it requires working through the issues and costs that sometimes accompany it. For\nIndia Inc., the imperatives for diversity have been akin to those in other countries\nand include a need to attract talent to meet the demands of an expanding knowledge\nindustry sector, creating competent teams for the Indian operations of multinational\ncompanies (MNCs), and the ambition of Indian organizations to go global.\nVIKALPA\nThe Journal for Decision Makers\nManagement, Ahmedabad\nSAGE Publications\nsagepub.in/home.nav\nhttp://vik.sagepub.com\nThemes\nDiversity\nInclusive Workplaces\nLeadership\nGender Sensitization\nOrganizational Culture\nEqual Opportunity Policy\nGenerational Diversity\nPersons with Disability\nCareer Development\nLGBT Community\nWipro\nVodafone\nMakeMyTrip\nSchneider Electric\nStarwood Hotels & Resorts\nInterGlobe Enterprises\nSeveral studies have looked at the relationship\nbetween the company's workforce demographics\nand its bottom line.1,2 In one study of Fortune 500\ncompanies, it was found that the top 25 per cent\nof the firms in terms of the presence of women in\nsenior management, actually yielded returns to their\nstockholders that were 30 per cent higher than those\nof their peers.3 Gender diversity was associated with\nincreased sales revenue and customers, and greater\nrelative profit. In a report by Deloitte, it is argued that\ndiversity and inclusion lead to improved business\noutcomes, and diversity means more than `just having\na sprinkle of women and a dab of color'.4 Using data\nfrom the National Organizations Survey in the United\nStates, Herring5 found racial diversity to be associated\nwith increased sales revenue, more number of\ncustomers, greater market share, and greater relative\nprofits. Thus, diversity can provide many potential\nadvantages to organizations. On one level, it helps\norganizations to reach out to diverse customer groups\nand markets, and on another level, by allowing for a\nvariety of perspectives, it promotes innovativeness\nand superior work outcomes and performance.\nNot surprisingly, diversity management is an\nimportant agenda in most organizations today and\nmany even have chief diversity officers, much like\nchief operating officers or chief financial officers.\nWhat we see today is the discourse increasingly\nshifting to one of inclusion, over and beyond that\nof diversity. Increasingly, research is showing that\nwhile explicit goals for diversity may be set, implicit\nbiases often limit the ability to achieve those goals.6\n1 Hersch, J. (1991).

The clincher is, given a diverse workforce, to\npromote quality, respect, and trust across multiple\nteams and geographies composed of heterogeneous\npeople in terms of age, gender, sexual preferences,\nphysical abilities, and national cultures. Diversity\nmanagement strategies or approaches have been\ncriticized for not addressing the exclusion of people\nfrom different identity groups and their limited access\nand participation in the organization.7\nThis colloquium has two objectives. One is to briefly\nreview the literature and debates on diversity\nand inclusion in the academic literature. We hope\nto briefly look at what exactly do diversity and\ninclusion mean? Are they simply new buzzwords in\nthe business world representing old wine in a new\nbottle, or do they allude to different things? What\ninfluences diversity and inclusion, and what do we\nknow about research regarding them? What are the\nfault lines in managing issues around them? What\nrole does leadership and organizational climate\nplay in shaping inclusive organizations? The other\nis to include voices from industry, diversity, and\ninclusion heads of organizations to share what their\nown journey has been towards creating diverse and\ninclusive organizations.\nThe term diversity is often used to describe the\ncomposition of work groups. At the most basic level,\ndiversity is viewed as demographic differences.\nEmphasis on diversity focuses on the composition\nof work groups around factors, which generally\ndistinguishes one individual from the other, mostly\nin terms of observable demographic characteristics\nsuch as gender, race, ethnicity, or age, or in terms\nof non-observable attributes such as education or\n7 Prasad, A.

Diversity and inclusion at the workplace:\nA review of research and perspectives (IIMA Working Paper Series No\nsocio-economic status.9,10 Diversity has been described11\nas `the varied perspectives and approaches to work\nthat the members of different identity groups bring'.\nHays-Thomas and Bendick12 define it as `the mixture of\nattributes within a workforce that in significant ways\naffect how people think, feel, and behave at work,\nand their acceptance, work performance, satisfaction,\nor progress in the organization'. While demographic\ndiversity may be a visible lead indicator, diversity of\nthought is seen as the end game.13\nJust as there are different diversity definitions,\nthere are also a multitude of perspectives that have\nbeen found to exist within organizations vis-\u00e0-vis\ndiversity. Two complimentary typologies of diversity\nhave been proposed. Dass and Parker14 propose a\ncontinuum of perspectives ranging from diversity as\na threat and diversity as a source of problems such as\ndiscrimination and fairness to diversity as a means to\ncreate opportunities such as access to new markets\nand diversity as something that has the potential for\nlearning (including costs and benefits). Similarly,\nexamining the effects of diversity on work group\nprocesses, Ely and Thomas15 offered a somewhat similar\ntypology of organizational approaches to diversity,\nthe integration-and-learning perspective, the access-\nand-legitimacy perspective, and the discrimination-\nand-fairness perspective. The discrimination-and-\nfairness perspective involves focus on justice and the\nfair treatment of all members, as a moral imperative.\nThe access-and-legitimacy perspective is based on\nthe recognition that the organization's markets and\nconstituencies are culturally diverse, and, therefore,\nmatching the organization's own workforce is a way\nof gaining access and legitimacy to those markets.\n9 Kreitz, P.

It is argued\nthat the dominant perspective among organizational\nmembers influences the way diversity is handled\nwithin organizations. It is proposed that the integration-\nand-learning perspective is what provides sustained\nbenefits in the long run.\nChanges in the discourse about diversity have seen\na shift from debates about affirmative action to focus\nmore extensively on the notion of inclusion. The\ninclusion literature is still under development and there\nappears to be limited agreement on the conceptual\nunderpinnings of the construct.16\nIthasbeenarguedthatifjust10percentmoreemployees\nfeel included, the company will increase work\nattendance by almost one day per year per employee17.\nA Catalyst report has found that, in India, employee\nperceptions of inclusion account for 43 per cent of\nteam citizenship behaviour18. According to the Deloitte\nreport, when employees think that their organization\nis committed to and supportive of diversity and they\nfeel included, they report better business performance\nin terms of their ability to innovate, responsiveness\nto changing customer needs, and team collaboration.19\nThey argue that organizations need to rebalance\ntheir focus on inclusion rather than prioritizing only\ndiversity, to fully unleash the potential of diversity. In\nother words, an additional effort is needed to focus on\ninclusion, over and beyond diversity.\nIn one of the early descriptions of inclusion, Miller20\ncalls it the extent to which individuals are `allowed\nto participate and are enabled to contribute fully'.\n16 Shore, L.

Public Personnel Management,\nAccording to another definition21, inclusion is `the\ndegree to which an employee is accepted and treated\nas an insider by others in a work system'. Considering\nit along a continuum, Mor Barak22 notes that `employee\nperception of inclusion\u00adexclusion is conceptualized as\na continuum of the degree to which individuals feel\na part of critical organizational processes'. According\nto the Mor Barak model, diversity and organizational\nculture contribute to perceptions of inclusion\u00ad\nexclusion, which in turn are related to job satisfaction,\norganizational commitment, individual well-being,\nand task effectiveness. Emphasizing on the fairness\nperspective and the active seeking out of employees in\nthe process of inclusion, Holvino, Ferdman, and Merrill-\nSands23 define inclusion as `equality, justice, and full\nparticipation at both the group and individual levels, so\nthat members of different groups not only have equal\naccess to opportunities, decision-making, and positions\nof power, but they are actively sought out because of\ntheir differences'. Towards achieving this, Roberson24\nargues that inclusion refers to `the removal of obstacles\nto the full participation and contribution of employees\nin organizations'. Elsewhere it is defined as `the extent\nto which employees believe their organizations engage\nin efforts to involve all employees in the mission and\noperation of the organization with respect to their\nindividual talents'.25\nThe pairing of diversity and inclusion at times leads\nto the misunderstanding that these are related and\nsimilar. It is argued that while diversity can be achieved\nby hiring different people in the organization, inclusion\nis a process that involves change in mindset of all the\npeople in an organization.

For example, in China, relatively stronger\nlinks existed between altruistic leadership, inclusion,\ninnovation, and citizenship.48\nSkills Needed for Creating Inclusive Organizations\nWhile diversity and inclusion are recognized as\nimportant for effective organizations, the specific\nresearch on what skills or competencies are required\nto engender inclusion is still in its nascent stage. In\ntheir research, Hays-Thomas, Bowen, and Bourdreaux49\nasked their respondents to tell them about a situation in\nwhich they had observed someone dealing either very\neffectively or very ineffectively with a work situation\nthat involved challenges related to diversity among\nemployees. Required values, knowledge, and skills for\nline/staff, middle managers, and top leadership were\nidentified based on the analysis of the critical incidents\nand are shown in Table 1.\n44 Wasserman, I.

Making up workers in an inclusive organiza-\nrepresentation of historically disadvantaged groups\ncould be the resentment or backlash from those who do\nnot directly benefit from such practices, augmenting in\nsome cases the negative stereotypes that may already\nexist.55 As some caution56, there is a need to scrutinize the\nextent to which the rhetoric of diversity and inclusion\nactually meets the reality and the expression of voice\namong the minorities in today's organizations. Thus,\nit is important to ensure that diversity and inclusion\nefforts are not reduced to tokenism57, as perceived by\nthe minority group members, and are also seen as fair\nby others in the organization.\nIn this colloquium, our attempt is to capture the\njourney of a few organizations, located in India, that\nhave embraced inclusion in spirit and may have\ngone beyond simply having numbers that reflect\ndiversity. In having the organizations share their\njourney--what propelled them, their insights and\npractices--we hope to present lessons for Indian\norganizations on what it is to create an inclusive work\nculture. In the questions that they are asking them-\nselves today, we hope to present dilemmas and chal-\nlenges that give hints on what needs to be addressed\nin terms of unconscious biases and larger societal\nissues beyond organizational structures. The six\norganizations that we present here are by no means\nthe only exemplars of inclusive organizations. We are\naware of and have interacted with several organiza-\ntions that have embraced inclusion as a high priority\nand made clear progress in their respective journeys.58\nHowever, due to space and time considerations, the\nsample has been chosen to represent multinational\nand Indian origin organizations, manufacturing\nand service sector, large- and medium-sized organ-\nizations.

Of\nthe six organizations, the initial interviews were carried out by the\nBizDivas research team.\nWipro Ltd. is a global information technology,\nconsulting, and outsourcing company with\nover 1.5 lakh employees serving clients in\n175 + cities across six continents. It is globally recognized\nfor its innovative approach towards delivering business\nvalue and its commitment to sustainability. Today the\ncompany is a trusted partner of choice for global busi-\nnesses looking to `differentiate at the front' and `stand-\nardize at the core' through technology interventions.\nWipro recognizes that a talented and diverse\nworkforce is a key competitive advantage, and that\na heterogeneous group is better equipped to handle\ncomplex and intangible problems. Diversity in the\nworkforce also results in a rich organizational mosaic\nof ideas and practices which can enhance innovation\nand customer delight leading to higher revenues.\nNurturing diversity and making inclusivity a part of\nWipro's culture has thus remained a key focus area for\nthe organization and is a strategic enabler to ensure\nbusiness and performance.\nWipro's commitment to being an equal opportunity\nemployer has been integral to its code of conduct,\npolicies, and processes. In order to give structure and\nimpetus to the diversity charter and to channelize\nconcentrated effort in building a more inclusive and\nglobal workforce, the Diversity and Inclusion (D&I)\nprogramme was formally launched in 2008. The\nprogramme is multi-dimensional and consists of four\npillars--gender, persons with disabilities, nationality,\nand underprivileged/disadvantaged communities.\nWorldwide, research has indicated that there has been\nslow progress in these areas as indicated by the low\nwork participation rate for women in the organized\nsector, under-representation of women in leadership\npositions, high unemployment rate of persons with\ndisabilities, etc. Over the years, Wipro's diversity\nagenda has focused on driving initiatives to address\nthese areas and some of these initiatives have gained\nprominence as industry benchmarks.\nThe impact of these efforts is reflected in the current\nprofile of Wipro's workforce comprising 32 per cent\nper cent betw een the age group of 30 and 45 years,\nand 8 per cent above 45 years.\nLaying the Foundation for an Inclusive Culture\nBeing a sensitive and inclusive employer is part of\nour vision statement. Our recruitment policy clearly\nstates that we are an equal opportunity player and\neven includes the local diversity agenda for specific\ngeographies in the addendum. For example, in the\nUSA, there has to be a certain amount of hiring from\nthe pool of veterans. When it comes to gender diversity,\nour key belief is that as we increase the input pool, there\nwould be more women with the ability and aspiration\nto grow within the organization. So, we have focused\non hiring more women at the entry level to better the\ngender ratio through the entire pipeline.\nFor D&I initiatives to be successful, leadership\nsupport is crucial. Our senior management team has\nactively taken part in spreading the message. Today\nthe communication around D&I is driven through our\ninternal blog. Several senior leaders including our CEO\npublish their blogs here to promote the D&I agenda.\nMany also take on mentoring roles for young women\nemployees in the organization.\nCreating a culture that supports diversity requires\nsustained focus and effort.

They\nare available online and it is mandated that everyone\ncompletes them by a certain time period after joining\nand get certified. In our efforts to ensure gender\ndiversity, we are sensitive that men may feel side-\nlined. So in our gender-related initiatives, we have\ntried to include their contribution on this journey. Men\nregularly attend our `Women of Wipro' Speaker Series\nwhere we have a facilitated interaction with senior\nwomen employees from our customer organizations.\nMany of the mentors in our `WOW Mentorship\nprogramme for high potential women employees'\nare senior male employees of Wipro. Essentially,\nmanagers--both men and women--are custodians of\nour diversity charter.\nGender Diversity\nWhat has worked for us at Wipro is to not look at gender\ndiversity from a `one size fits all' approach. The life\nstages of women employees can be roughly divided\ninto three phases. The early years of their career, when\nthe key driver is to learn new technologies, and there\nare less constraints in terms of hours at work or travel.\nThe next is the middle stage where life changes with\nmarriage or childbirth, and the women need flexibility\nand organizational support to sustain their careers.\nThe third stage is essentially where the personal\nfront seems more settled and the drive seems to be\naround the impact one is making on the organization.\nMonetary rewards by themselves become less of a\nmotivator and the woman employee will continue\nwithin the organization only if she is able to make a\ndifference to the larger charter of the organization,\nthrough hugely visible projects, client interfacing roles\nor driving important agendas for the organization. We\nhave realized that the unique needs and aspirations\nof each of the three stages need to be taken into\naccount in planning the strategies for inclusion. Being\nsensitive to these stages has specifically helped us at\nWipro to increase the number of women in the middle\nmanagement levels.\nWomen in Leadership\nUnder gender diversity, we have a mentoring\nprogramme that has been in place for the last three\nyears. In this programme, senior leaders--both men\nand women--act as mentors to women employees.\nClose to 100 women employees across the globe are\nselected and put through the mentoring initiative with\nthe objective of grooming them for leadership roles.\nWhile the manager is definitely available to discuss\ncareer growth, having a mentor helps create dedicated\ntime where the young mentees can discuss relevant\nissues on a regular basis. Right at the beginning of the\nprocess, each mentee defines a clear objective with\nher mentor and the progress is tracked through the\nengagement. Through this programme, we are aiming\nat increasing the number of women in the middle\nmanagement levels. When we started this programme\nwhich dropped to 8 per cent as they reached the senior\nlevels. However, today the share of women employees\nin the middle management level has moved to 22 per\nGenerational Diversity\nAnother important area for us has been to ensure\ninclusion around generational diversity--with 54 per\ncent of our employees being between 22 and 30 years,\nabove 45 years.

This was a huge eye-opener for us.\nThe survey also showed certain trends--like social\nnetworking--that one could definitely subscribe to\nthe millennials. This led us to lift the organization-\nwide ban on access to the social network sites such\nas Facebook and Twitter. Seeing how much learning\nhappened through this medium, we actually\ndeveloped our own networking tool, called Yammer.\nWe actively encourage the use of Yammer as a forum\nfor people to form groups with different interest and\nskills for writing code in a specific technology, and\nresolving specific issues.\nHiring of People with Disabilities\nAt Wipro, people with disabilities (PwDs) have been\nplaced in mainstream positions (see Figure 1). Wipro\nselects all its employees based only on merit and it\nbelieves that persons with disability could aspire for\nany of these positions. In the last four years, the number\nof employees who have disclosed their disabilities has\nTo support the differently abled people, we have\nlooked at different aspects of infrastructure, training,\nand sensitization.\nWipro is a member of the Confederation of Indian\nIndustry (CII), the NationalAssociation of Software and\nServices Companies (NASSCOM), and International\nLabour Organization (ILO). With CII and NGOs, such\nas Sarthak, Ability Foundation, and Enable India, it\nhas run job fairs to help differently abled people with\na platform to find job opportunities besides organizing\ninclusive campus hiring with JSS, Dr Ambedkar\nInstitute of Technology For Handicapped (AITH), and\nNational Institute of Speech and Hearing (NISH). We\nhave established relationships with colleges where\nthere are students with disabilities, and we encourage\nthem to participate.\nFigure 1: Share of Different Roles for PwDs\nRole-wise Avg.

So far,\nover a 1,000 interviewers have cleared this course. The\nrecruiter while interviewing candidates with disability\nelicits information on what reasonable accommodation\ncould be required while going through a selection\nprocess. We have introduced a self-identification form\nin which employees could indicate any accessibility\nissue or accommodation requirement at the time of\njoining. Any accessibility issue that has been brought\nup so far has been effectively resolved in 48 hours by\nthe company. Battery-operated vehicles have been\nprocured for people with disabilities to travel within\nthe campus.\nThe Travel and Transport Policy has been revamped\nto include `reasonable accommodations'. Wipro\nis committed to providing additional reasonable\naccommodation wherever required to ensure a level\nplaying ground for people with disabilities.\nBarrier-free Communication\nThe Wipro Kinesics website has been developed to\nmaintain a communicative environment between\nhearing and hearing-disabled employees in Wipro.\nIt is a combination of Indian, American, and local\nsign languages. The tool includes sections on Wipro\nterminologies, detailed dictionary, conversation,\nand sign language basics. Wipro Kinesics brings\nto prominence the need for communication to be\nbarrier-free and for such communication at work\nto include categories of disability like speech and\nhearing. Through this, we anticipate that a large\nnumber of organizations may be able to attract talent\nwith speech and hearing disabilities and improve\ncareer opportunities for them.\n`Winclusive' is a vibrant community of employees\nwith disabilities that discusses the applicants'\naccessibility. The community posts change requests.\nThese are implemented to the extent feasible. Changes\nare internally tested and released to the community\nwhich then validates the application. Also, help\nrequests by new employees are addressed through\nthis community. This helps enable new employees\nto become quickly productive. The team has also\nreviewed all our employee policies numbering up to 58\nand has come out with recommendations on possible\nreasonable accommodation for people with disabilities.\n`Winclusive' community has now become a part of\nWipro's social media platform, Yammer, which has\nbeen successfully able to connect people and share\nglobal updates in the disability sector.\nManagers and leaders are trained in sign language.\nRendition of the Indian National Anthem is done in\nsign language to create an inclusive environment.\nWipro observes the International Day for People with\nDisabilities every year on December 3, by building\nsensitivity amongst employees at large and also by\ninviting NGOs working with PwDs to display their\nproducts and share their expertise.\nWe have a PWD engagement calendar through which\ntownhalls,paneldiscussions,rewardsandrecognitions,\nfeedback session with managers of disabled employees,\netc. are regularly planned and organized.\nBarrier Free Infrastructure\n`Breaking all Barriers', an annual contest for Wipro\nemployees, is a forum through which employees\nreview Wipro's physical infrastructure (accessibility\nwithin buildings, accessible restrooms, railings, ramps,\nsignages, etc.) and collaborate with the Facilities\nteam to bring about changes. An exclusive policy on\naccessibility on the intranet portal helps individuals\nto suggest reasonable accommodation requirements\nto the Facilities team. Wipro's Building Standards\n(which was earlier based on National Building Code\n2005) have been modified to include international\nnorms developed by the United Nations `Accessibility\nfor the Disabled, A Design Manual for a Barrier Free\nEnvironment', and the latest draft of the Building\nCode prepared by the National Centre for Promotion\nof Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP) and\nAccessAbility, India.\nAccessible Information Systems\nWipro has a set of over 100 software applications\napplications address a variety of requirements in\nHR, travel, leave, cash, career, etc. These applications\nare created by the Information Systems (IS) Team,\nand maintained by a team of over 500 employees.\nBefore deployment, each application is extensively\nvalidated against the WCAG-2.0 guidelines (Web\nContent Accessibility Guidelines) with a focus on visual\nand motor disabilities. After deployment, the software\nis field tested by the community group. Deviations\nor modification requests reported by the field are\nprioritized and the application is re-deployed to ensure\nthat it meets WCAG-2.0 guidelines. Wipro.com, the\nwebsite of Wipro, has also been made accessible by\nfollowing the WCAG2.0 guidelines.\nSkills have to be augmented to enable a software\ndeveloper to develop as per the WCAG-2.0. Each\nengineer is first made aware of the needs of persons\nwith disabilities. They are then trained\u00adin person, or\nthrough webinars, or through e-training sessions\u00adon\nwhat makes software accessible. After the training,\nthey have to clear assessment tests to get certified. The\ncourse content is upgraded periodically to meet the\nchanges and challenges of new technologies (such as\nmobile enablement). It is reassuring to see many of\nthese certified employees reflecting a changed outlook.\nWipro has a full-time consultant from Diversity and\nEqual Opportunity Centre (DEOC) to keep us abreast of\nthe changes in the environment, statutory obligations,\nand also to advise on taking the inclusivity initiative for\nemployees with disabilities to the next level.\nInclusion of Disadvantaged Community\nA Rural BPO\nWipro's rural BPO centre was launched in Manjakkudi\nin 2011 as a `Back Office to Back Office Model' as the\nresult of a tie-up with Swami Dayananda Education\nTrust. The trust strives to provide quality education to\nthe economically backward regions of Tamil Nadu. The\ncentre completed three years in 2014 and from an initial\nstrength of 50 employees, it grew to 100 employees\nin the second year, and around 150 employees in the\nthird year. The centre has enabled the creation of job\nopportunities and in turn reduced the migration of\nyouth to urban areas.\nTracking Inclusion through Audits\nBesides industry research and engagement with\nexternal stakeholders on D&I themes, Wipro tracks\nkey diversity indicators to identify opportunity\nareas. Our key organizational metrics are gender\ndisaggregated and published in the public domain\nin our business responsibility report and standalone\nsustainability report. These indicators include\nworkforce composition, leadership pipeline, attrition\npercentage, training data, and results of the biennial\nemployee perception survey, which includes\nquestions on D&I, freedom of expression, fairness,\netc. The structured analysis of these data drives the\nD&I goals for the year. For instance, three years ago,\nwe looked at how salary increases were happening for\nwomen employees across the organization. This audit\nhighlighted that, while there was no apparent\ndisparity in the senior management, in the lower\nlevels, in some pockets, women seemed to get the\nshort end of the stick. This could possibly be due\nto managers getting the men in the teams to stretch\nmore or possibly a prevalent societal bias that the\nmen as a single breadwinner need a better salary than\nthe women, who possibly are part of double income\nfamilies. Since these were isolated incidents and not\nall-pervasive, we addressed it by counselling the\nindividual managers to eliminate these disparities.\nLast year, we also commissioned three key in-house\nsurveys to identify current gender equity perspectives\nin the organization and to identify the focus areas.\nThe survey results have produced Six-Sigma action\nplans around global deployment efforts, lateral hiring\npractices, and company-wise tracking, monitoring, and\npublishing of these efforts.\nSocietal biases around gender obviously creep into the\nworkplace. For instance, a manager's perception on how\nhard it is to expect the women team members to take late\nnight calls or stretch at times may come in the way of\nhim/her having a good gender diversity in his/her team.\nSecond, when it comes to the differently abled, despite\nthe infrastructure being there, some employees may\nfeel that someone who is, say visually impaired, may\nnot have the same speed on delivering like the others\nin the team. While such beliefs may not be prevalent,\nidentifying where they exist and sensitively dealing with\nit at an individual level need a sustained effort.\nWipro being an equal opportunity employer considers\ndifferently abled candidates at par with the candidates\nwithout disability. However, to be able to hire more\nof differently abled candidates, we need to develop\nmore people with the skills required in the IT sector.\nWipro has collaborated with NGOs and institutes to\ntrain and develop the differently abled candidates\nand prepare them for the IT industry. Also, at times,\nthere could be reluctance among the business groups\nin letting on board a differently abled employee in\ntheir teams.\nIncreased awareness and sensitization sessions on the\ninclusion of PWDs and showcasing the achievements\nof our differently abled employees in the town halls\nhelp us address these biases.\nCurrently, although we operate at a global level, we\nare still largely Indian. Over the next few years, one\nof the focus areas would be on how we could become\na more global organization by recruiting men and\nwomen of different nationalities and cultures. We are\nalso looking at how best we can create a level-playing\nfield for differently abled employees and bridge the\ngap between their hiring and their placement in a\nproject and ensure a better long-term career path for the\ndifferently abled employees.\nPower to Diversity: Vodafone India's Inclusion Story\nNisha Verma\nHead - Diversity, Vodafone India\ne-mail: Nisha.Verma@vodafone.com\nVodafone Group Plc. is one of the world's largest\ntelecommunications companies. It provides a\nrange of services, including voice, messaging,\ndata, and fixed communications. Vodafone has mobile\noperations in 26 countries, partners with mobile\nnetworks in 55 more, and fixed broadband opera-\nhas around 446 million mobile customers and over 12\nmillion fixed broadband customers.59 Vodafone India\nis a fully-owned subsidiary of Vodafone Group Plc.\nMaking its entry into India in 2007, Vodafone today has\nbuilt an ever growing and robust business in a highly\n59 For more information, please visit: www.vodafone.com\nprice-sensitive and competitive market. Serving around\n184 million customers, Vodafone provides innovative,\ncustomer-friendly, and differentiated products and\nservices through a wide scale distribution and exclu-\nsive retail footprint--backed up with a modern, tech-\nnologically advanced network for both voice and data.\nA value-based organization, Vodafone is committed to\nachieving the highest standards of health, safety, and\nwell-being for its employees and business partners.\nAs a responsible corporate, Vodafone India has been\nworking with several partners from the social sector to\naddress some of India's most pressing challenges over\nthe years. Sustainability for Vodafone is an ongoing\njourney as it believes that what is good for the society\nis good for business. The Vodafone Foundation too\nis actively engaged in corporate social responsibility\n(CSR) by harnessing the potential of mobile services and\ntechnology to maximize impact within communities,\nespecially in the domains of women, agriculture,\neducation, and disaster relief.\ncomprise 20 per cent of the workforce. Employees\nwork in 23 different circles pan India. The company\nconsciously began to focus on three key pillars of\ndiversity--gender, ethnicity, and business experiences\nand skills--in 2010. In the last five years, the practice\nhas led to diversity reflecting across the organization,\nbe it at the circle level, in the corporate office, or at the\nVodafone group level.\nEnhancing the diversity of the workforce has a clear\nbusiness impetus. Thirty-three per cent of the telecom\ncustomer base is women and ensuring a similar gender\nratio in the workforce meant better engagement with the\ncustomer. Consciously, adding diversity in nationality\nand experience also meant a huge scope for innovation\nand new products. It is believed that different ways of\nthinking and approaches are the core advantage of a\ndiverse workforce.\nAs we embarked on increasing diversity, we realized\nthat just stating something as a diversity agenda would\nnot suffice. To bring in and ensure the acceptance of\neach specific group required widespread and in-depth\nattention. To inspire a change in culture for the inclusion\nof a variety of minority groups within the organization,\na change in mindset was necessary. Thus, we decided\nto focus on first, increasing the number of women in the\norganization and also integrating them and making it\npossible for them to contribute to the maximum of their\npotential. It was assumed that unless we tackled gender\ndiversity and demonstrated exemplary performance\naround this area, the employees may become sceptic of\nour larger programme of increasing diversity and reduce\nthecommitmenttomakediversityhappenonotherfronts.\nSenior Management Support and Sensitization\nThe starting point at Vodafone India was to support\ndiversity and create a work environment that believed\nin diversity and supported inclusion. Our top\nmanagement and the strategic leadership team were\nvery clear that this was the right thing to do. In fact,\nMarten Pieters, a former MD and CEO of Vodafone\nIndia, hosted the first Focused Group Discussion\n(FGD) with women employees to get a pulse of the\nissues on the ground. The organization then spent\nclose to a year and a half preparing the ground in\ncreating a culture that would embrace and support\ndiversity and inclusion. A module around inclusive\nleadership and unconscious bias was conducted\nfor 2,500 + line managers to initiate a change in\nthe mindset and also to enroll the senior leaders as\nchampions of diversity.\nNaturally, the starting point for these inclusion sessions\nwas the Executive Committee. The sessions were then\nconducted across different circles with the business\nhead of that particular circle as the host. This helped\nto communicate that it was not an HR initiative but\nsomething that the business managers also believed in\nand supported.\nAt the end of each of these workshops, each of the\ncircles came up with a list of things that they wanted\nto work on to include diverse people in their circles.\nBased on the analysis of action points chosen at each\ncircle in India, Vodafone chose the top three areas to\nwork on to ensure that specific nuances and priorities\ncommon to all regions would get addressed. People\nwithin each of the circles partnered with the HR teams\nto make the necessary changes required to build the\nright culture to support diversity and inclusion. Such\ninitiatives included: sensitizing line managers on\nrespectful language, work-life balance practices, and\nwomen-friendly policies.\nWe have paid attention to the challenge of ensuring\ninclusion through specific policies and practices.\nFor example, to support gender diversity, we have\nidentified two specific issues that stop women from\ncontributing to their potential--maternity leave and\na sense of safety and security--and have adopted\nappropriate measures:\n\u00b7 We have introduced the global minimum standard\nof four months of maternity leave across all our\noperating companies across the world and also\nimplemented reduced hours of work for six months\npost-return from maternity for child care.\nWe have also laid out a detailed maternity-\ntransitioning process to support the women on\nmaternity. It also enables the line manager to plan\nwork better. In fact, the transitioning process starts\neven before the women employee goes on maternity\nleave. We sensitize the line managers to take care of\nher special needs during this period, reassess her\ngoals to ensure that they are commensurate with her\nstage of maternity, have role-related conversations\nin advance, and bring in the replacement in the\nform of a maternity cover. We assign a buddy who\nstays connected with her during the leave period.\nOn return, the employee is re-oriented into the\norganization/role. Enough care is taken to see\nthat she does not lose on her benefits, for example,\nincentives, bonus, etc. while on maternity leave and\nKPIs are reworked to ensure that they match the\nhours she will work.\n\u00b7 For women in our organization, we have customized\nthe philosophy of `Safe Workplace, Safe Travel and\nSafe Stay':\n\nIt is mandatory to have a late night drop facility\nvia a company vehicle in case a women employee\nhappens to work late.\n\nIn some locations, such a drop is additionally\nsupported with a security person escorting the\nwoman right up to her door step.\nWhen women employees are scheduled to arrive\nlate from outstation trips, they are provided\ncompany vehicles to get to their home from the\nairport/station.\n\nAll vendors providing transport services have\nundergone police verification and background\nchecks.\n\nMoreover, hotels or guesthouses need to follow\nspecific instructions to ensure the safety of\nwomen for empanelment.\n\nPrevention of sexual harassment at workplace\nis very strongly enforced by the Internal\nComplaints Committee.\nTracking Inclusion\nTo ensure that the people who are hired are included in\nthe real sense, we have also put in place the tracking of\nnumbers at the hiring stage--both in terms of gender\nand in getting people from diverse experiences and\nskills. On a regular basis, data around increments\nand promotions are reviewed to ensure that all the\ndeserving people are getting recommended for\npromotion irrespective of the gender and that there is\nno disparity on the basis of gender. There are regular\ndipstick surveys to ensure that Vodafone India is seen\nas an equal pay and equal opportunity employer.\nIn the annual Vodafone People Survey, there are specific\nquestions on diversity and inclusion; for instance, `Am\nI being treated fairly?' `Am I being respected?' The\nresponses are closely tracked at an organization level.\nThis survey is conducted yearly and forms a part of\nManagers' report which is viewed very closely by the\norganization. As Ashok Ramchandran, Director, HR,\nVodafone India, says: `Even if a manager is delivering\ngreat results but is not sensitive, then he is not the right\nperson for us. And we have had to part ways with some\npeople of this kind as an exception'.\nDriving Inclusion through Communication\nDiscussion on the inclusion of women is part of the\nbiannual town halls. Senior leaders, the CEO, the HR\ndirector, all make it a point to repeatedly talk about\ninclusion of women. Management conferences held\neach year also make it a point to showcase the D&I\nresults. The best circle awards are decided by adding\ndiversity and inclusion of women as a criterion for\njudging the performance on each circle.\nAddressing Exclusion\nAll the Vodafone circles have an internal complaints\ncommittee where any person, be it a man or a woman,\ncan report any sexual harassment that they may be\nexperiencing at the workplace. There are frequent\ncampaigns, through e-mailers, communication by\nbusiness managers encouraging people to speak up to\nhighlight issues.\n`ZubaanSambhalKe' campaigns--A series of awareness\nmailers have been circulated to men and women\nemployees highlighting the various aspects of sexual\nharassment at the workplace and beyond. Additionally,\nassociatedlegalimplicationshavealsobeenhighlighted.\nThe focus on diversity and inclusion has resulted in\nseveral unique practices within the organization.\nOne such concept that has gained a life of its own and\nmade an impact is the Vodafone Inclusivity Network\n(VIN). It is detailed in Exhibit 1.\nThe Angel Stores\nVodafone India has set up 34 `Angel Stores' across 21\ncircles in the country. These retail outlets are managed\nand run entirely by women employees, thereby making\nthem unique. From the security and pantry staff, to\nthe customer service resources and management-level\npersonnel, women occupy all the positions. The company\nbelieves that this is a way to empower women employees.\nThe `Angel Stores' have been successful in building and\nmaintaining loyalty among all their customers--both\nmen and women. In keeping with the Vodafone tradition,\nthe customer service offered at these stores matches the\nclass and standard of all other Vodafone retail outlets.\nThe friendly female staff helps customers, both men and\nwomen, feel at ease while they are visiting the stores\nand purchasing products, thus enhancing customer\nexperience.\n`Project Shakti': Building Diversity in the\nFrontline\nAfocused initiative is to hire women for non-traditional\nroles by giving them exclusive support for one year.\nFor instance, we went to engineering colleges in rural\nlocations and hired an all-women batch of graduate\nThe 4C model for valuing diversity and promoting\ninclusion involves Customer, Colleagues,\nCommunity, and Communication. There is a VIN\nchapter in each Circle. The Circle chapters take the\nonus of creating engagement initiatives around\nthe 4Cs. There is a quarterly meet of circle senior\nsponsors to share best practices with corporate. The\nentire network is driven by the 23 business circles\nacross India. VIN teams across the circles have both\nmen and women employees across different levels\nwho drive the 4C initiatives.\n\u00b7 The 4C initiatives for including more women have\nthe following objectives:\n\u00b7 To inspire and empower women to maximize\ntheir potential for both individual and business\nsuccess\n\u00b7 To promote cross-gender understanding and\nan inclusive culture wherein people get a safer\nenvironment to communicate thoughts and views\nspecifically on any cultural or policy barriers\n\u00b7 To support the creation of a consistent Vodafone\nemployer brand that is attractive to women\n\u00b7 To provide insights into the requirements of female\ncustomers to inform the development of Vodafone\nproducts and service\n\u00b7 Toencouragetheinvolvementofnetworkmembers\nin Vodafone Foundation or local community\ninitiatives that benefit women\nThe Vodafone inclusivity network is empowered to\ndrive communication around D&I.\n4C Initiatives\nCustomer: Initiating walk-in drive at the stores\nfor women customers, various plans/offers\nspecifically for women customers, female retailers\n(Fe-tailers)\nColleagues: Conducting career development\nworkshops for women employees, Inspirational\nspeaker series,\nCommunities: Associating with NGOs working\non girl child education, enabling NGOs to connect\npeople, Fe-tailers\nCommunication: Conducting `Open Houses',\nCoffee with the CEO\nengineer trainees or field trainees. The selected women\nwere specifically hired to work in sales and were\nassigned as a responsibility of the senior people in the\ncircle who were their mentors. The mentor doubled as\nsponsor as well by ensuring that the hired women were\nsuccessful in their assignment and overcame challenges\nif any. The trainees were put on a year's rotation\nprogramme focusing on understanding the product,\nmarket, customers, and process. During that period\nthey were not given any actual responsibility or role.\nPost the first year, they were transferred to territories\nwithin the circle as territory leaders.\nThe project has been a success and the hired women are\nall performing well in roles which were predominantly\ndone earlier by male colleagues. This initiative is\nnow being run in other circles across Vodafone with\nevery circle having its own name. The project is now\ncurrently running in the second year with a third year\nplanned soon.\nIn the first year, we had hired 15 trainees, and seeing\nthe success of the programme, increased the number\nto 28 in the second year. We continue to build on this\nprogramme.\nExhibit 1: Vodafone Inclusivity Network (VIN)\n`Project Samridhi': Fe-tailers--Our Women\nRetailers\nVodafone Samridhi is an integral part of Vodafone's\nobjective to encourage women empowerment in\nHaryana, thereby making a difference to the lives of the\ncommunities we engage with.\nUnder the project, Vodafone has appointed women\nfrom the lowest echelons of the society to encourage\nthem to become entrepreneurs and earn a living for\nthemselves. This programme is slated to be extended\nto other districts in rural Haryana in a phased manner.\nAs part of the pilot, 24 women from Narnaul in\nMahendergarh district were trained to sell e-top-ups\nand recharge vouchers. As an additional support\nmechanism, Vodafone women retailers have been\ngiven special incentives in the first two months.\nThis pilot was successful and now we have 66 such\nFe-tailers.\nThis initiative has given a huge recognition to the brand\nVodafone and has enabled the reach of Vodafone in\nrural areas which were otherwise difficult to penetrate.\nIt has also given an opportunity of earning a living to\nwomen in rural areas.\nCareer Development: Pathways to Success and\nEverywoman Network\n`Pathways to Success' is a career development series\nfor our women employees to take on future leadership\nroles in the organization. They come together for two\ndays and focus on Career Maps, Personal Brand, and\nNetworking; and the series has been very well received.\nIn addition, we have enrolled all our women on\n`Everywoman Network'. Everywoman is the world's\nlargest web-based network and learning and\ndevelopment platform for women in business and\nfemale entrepreneurs. It enables like-minded women\nto share experiences, opportunities, and ideas; they are\nprovided a backdrop to enable confidence and success\nto grow.\nWe have also been making some efforts in including\npersons with disability and creating openness for\npeople with different sexual orientation and ensuring\nthe success of those coming from diverse educational\nbackgrounds.\nWorking with Differently Abled: `Project Drishti'\nVodafoneIndiahastiedupwiththeNationalAssociation\nof Blind (NAB) to hire visually impaired associates for\nthe call centre in Mumbai on an experimental basis.\nThese associates are supported by imparting specific\ntraining and converting the collaterals in Braille and\nby providing infrastructure support in terms of giving\nthem Braille-enabled phone and so on.\n`The core objective is to create a win\u00adwin between our\nbusiness goals and critical social cause by generating skill\nsets and earning opportunity amongst the differently\nabled people, and helping them become self-dependent'.\nWhen experimented in Mumbai, it was found that\ntheir productivity was higher than the others; they had\nhigher conviction and convincing power, were polite\nand persuasive, and their commitment was noticeably\nhigher. NAB was therefore approached for the tie-up\nto start with this unique project called `Drishti' and it\nspread in other circles across the country as well.\nCelebrations\nBesides week-long celebrations to commemorate\nthe International Women's Week, globally Vodafone\nhas started to celebrate Parent's Day, and also has\nspecial programmes for people from different sexual\norientation or preferences and so on.\nVIN keeps the topic of D&I alive in all our 23 circles.\nThe D&I practices and line managers at Vodafone\ncontinue to be recognized:\n- Arvind Vohra, Operations Director East, was given\nthe WILL Choice of Women's Awards 2014 for his\nleadership and support to the D&I agenda.\n- Dilip Kumar Ganta received the D&I Champion for\n- Vodafone figures in the top two MNCs, according\nto a survey conducted by AON Hewitt, which\nbenchmarks its D&I focus and best practices.\nInclusion for Diverse Skillsets\nWe have also spread our net far and wide to attract\nprofessionals from all backgrounds. To ensure that the\nrecruits who come from non-telecom backgrounds are\nable to function well in Vodafone, we have worked on\ndesigning a very structured onboarding process. The\nnewmanagementtraineesandpeoplefromnon-telecom\nbackgrounds undergo cross-functional induction and\nan intense technology session. There are 30-, 60-, and\n90-day modules to ensure that the recruits interact with\nthe right people to gain a better understanding of the\nbusiness and the industry.\nIn retrospect we know that the initial efforts to drive\nconversations across the organization enabled us to\nset the right tone for driving diversity and inclusion,\nhelping employees see the business imperative and\nreduce the risk of diversity and inclusion initiative\nas being just another good-to-do thing. The decision\nto focus on one aspect of diversity and do a deep-\ndive in it further helped achieve visible results in a\nshort timespan. `Over the past two years, we focused\nintensely on becoming gender-balanced and moved\nfrom having 14 per cent women in our workforce to\n20 per cent today. This focus will continue in the next\nphase of our evolution,' confirms Ashok Ramchandran,\nDirector, HR, Vodafone India. `The company's\n`Discover Graduate' programme, under which it\nhires from business schools and technology institutes,\nfocuses on 50 per cent women hires at the entry-level.\nThe transformation agenda will continue!'\nCountering the mindset especially at the supervisory\nlevels is an ongoing challenge. In certain small pockets,\nwe also encounter biases/prejudices around what\nwomen employees are capable of doing--for instance,\nmeeting aggressive sales targets, travelling extensively,\nand being interested in taking up certain kinds of\nroles. The other big obstacle is the leaking pipeline--\nwomen opting to quit owing to a whole lot of societal\nand personal reasons. This is also related to the larger\nsocietal construct that women after all need to take\ncare of their families and unless society makes it more\nand more conducive for women to get educated and\nprogress as professionals, this will be a challenge for\norganizations across the board.\nAt Vodafone, we recognize inclusion as a process, an\nongoing journey. Given the commitment from our top\nmanagement and the sustained discussions and efforts\nacross different levels, we know we are on the right\ntrack in creating a culture that welcomes and celebrates\ndiversity in its truest essence.\nMake My Organization Diverse and Inclusive: The\nMakeMyTrip Story\nNihar Mathur Poonam Thakur\nAssistant Manager - Human Resources Manager - Public Relations\ne-mail: Nihar.Mathur@makemytrip.com e-mail: Poonam.Thakur@makemytrip.com\nTarika Chopra Yuvaraj Srivastava\nManager - Human Resources Chief Human Resource Officer\ne-mail: Tarika.Chopra@makemytrip.com e-mail: Yuvaraj.Srivastava@makemytrip.com\nMakeMyTrip.com, India's leading online travel\ncompany, was founded in the year 2000.

The D&I Council agenda is divided into four\nfocus areas:\n1. Inclusive communication platforms\n2. Celebration of diversity\n3. Improving the gender ratio at the mid-to-senior\nlevel\n4. Providing better facilities at the workplace\nEach of these subgroups has worked to ensure\nthe adoption and sustenance of these inclusion\nagendas.
