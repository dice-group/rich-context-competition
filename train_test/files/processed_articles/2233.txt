Both aims pose important dilemmas about\nchoice \u00ad what it means and how to protect it.2\nThe foreclosure crisis and its many spillover effects on markets, neighborhoods,\nand families have only increased the attention paid to the effects of low-income\nhousing assistance, including the types of neighborhoods that Housing Choice\nVoucher holders live in and whether low-income families with vouchers contribute to\ndecline when they concentrate in particular neighborhoods. In 2008, The Atlantic\nmagazine and New York Times, among other major media, sounded the alarm,\nsuggesting that changing market dynamics and decisions to demolish public housing\nmight be opening once-stable neighborhoods \u00ad in cities and suburbs alike \u00ad to a wave\nof crime arriving with poor people of color using housing vouchers.3\nStepping back from these immediate controversies, since 1992, the hope of\nimproving locational outcomes through low-income housing policy \u00ad which has also\nbeen linked to the controversial transformation of public housing since the early\npursued through the voucher program in four ways: a broad budgetary shift away\nfrom supply-side project subsidies to vouchers; reforms to the voucher program that\nmake it a more flexible tool for deconcentrating poverty and/or promoting racial\ndesegregation, for example, through higher rent ceilings and ``portability'' across\njudicial consent decrees in which the federal government agreed, as part of racial\ndesegregation efforts, to promote a wider array of neighborhood opportunities in\nvoucher-based experiment launched by the US Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment (HUD) in five metro areas in 1994. MTO aims to examine the effects of\nvoluntary relocation from public or assisted housing in high-poverty neighborhoods\nto privately owned apartments in low-poverty neighborhoods.\nThough HUD under President Bush was criticized for undermining the focus on\nlocational outcomes (e.g. Priemus, Kemp, and Varady 2005), that focus, nonetheless,\nrepresents a major shift \u00ad a ``locational turn'' \u00ad in the nation's low-income housing\npolicies since the 1980s. True, relocation or ``dispersal'' programs have been\ndiscussed and implemented, often on a small scale and without formal evaluation,\nsince the urban unrest of the 1960s. But MTO's immediate antecedent is a court-\nordered racial desegregation effort, the landmark Gautreaux program ordered in\nmetro Chicago in 1976 and examined by social researchers in the decades since (cf.\n1See US HUD (2007).

There are glass-\nis-half-full and half-empty assessments, depending on the reference point: Housing\nChoice Vouchers do much better, on average, than public housing at avoiding high-\npoverty neighborhoods, for example, but a relatively small share of voucher users,\nparticularly if they are racial minorities, live in low-poverty or racially integrated\nareas.5 Vis-a\n` -vis the reformer's benchmarks, then, and national policy statements\nabout neighborhood quality from the Housing Act of 1949 to the Millennial\nHousing Commission report a half century later,6 the nation's largest housing\nassistance program for low-income people falls short.\nTo explain this, previous research, as well as the informally reported insights of\nprogram staff at all levels, has highlighted a range of supply-side barriers, such as\ndiscrimination and a scarcity of affordable and otherwise appropriate rental housing\nunits for voucher holders, as well as varied demand-side (client-side) barriers, such as:\ndebilitating physical and mental health problems; limited time, money, transporta-\ntion, information, and other resources vital for effective housing search; a fear of\nlosing vital social support and institutional resources; and ambivalence about\n2007). Based on a review of these studies, only programs that emphasize relocation\nto low-poverty neighborhoods appear to achieve such outcomes to any significant\ndegree. Moreover, the evidence that positive effects of special supports \u00ad that is,\n``assisted'' mobility \u00ad on locational outcomes persist over the long run is thus far\nlimited to administrative data on the Gautreaux program, which indicate sustained\nracial and economic integration over more than a decade (DeLuca and Rosenbaum\nThese patterns have led some observers to wonder whether deconcentrating\npoverty is more a reformer's ideal than a priority for the families served by housing\nprograms and to question both the feasibility and the wisdom of intervening in the\ncomplexities of housing choice for low-income people (Clark 2005). Yet to date,\nresearchers relying on structured surveys or location mapping have generated limited\n4See Leslie Kaufman, ``An Uprooted Underclass, Under the Microscope,'' New York Times\n(25 September 2005); ``A Voucher for Your Thoughts: Katrina and Public Housing,'' The\nEconomist (24 September 2005); Xavier de Souza Briggs and Margery Austin Turner,\n``Fairness in new New Orleans,'' The Boston Globe (5 October 2005); and Briggs (2006). The\nKatrina relocation also created a ``natural experiment,'' with moves from segregated, high-\npoverty, and often high-crime areas in pre-storm New Orleans to a range of different\nneighborhood contexts in a variety of metro areas.\n5There is a large literature. See, in particular, Hartung and Henig (1997), Khadduri (2006),\n6See Newman and Schnare (1997) and Meeting Our Nation's Housing Needs: Report of the\nBipartisan Millennial Housing Commission Appointed by the Congress of the United States\nanswers for these fundamental debates about voucher assistance, which we tackle\nthrough two research questions. First, beyond short-run success or failure at finding\nunits in particular kinds of neighborhoods, what are the neighborhood trajectories\nover time for families served by assisted housing mobility? Second, how do housing\nsupply- and demand-side factors interact over time to shape those trajectories, and as\npart of that question, why do some families \u00ad but not others \u00ad end up moving back to\nmuch poorer neighborhoods after leaving them? The first question is about where\nfamilies move, the second about why, how, and with what prospects.\nMTO has produced a range of locational outcomes over time, and correspond-\ningly varied interpretations by the policy community, not a simple success-or-failure\nstory. As such, we employed a mixed-method approach at three of the five sites: new\nanalyses of the MTO interim survey data, combined with census and administrative\ndata on changing neighborhoods and metro areas, plus in-depth qualitative\ninterviews and intensive ethnographic fieldwork with MTO families (another\nresearch team employed a somewhat different approach in the remaining two sites).\nWe examine housing choices in the context of families' broader strategies for their\nlives, as well as demographic and other changes in metro areas that shifted the\ndistribution of quality, affordability, and other traits among housing locations. We\ndetail specific ways in which choice decisions did matter over time \u00ad but almost\nalways in the context of having very limited choices to make. This is a major\nchallenge, albeit one that is often muddled or avoided in policy debates, as we\nrethink options for tackling persistent inequality in America.\nBackground\nThe study of MTO lies at the intersection of two research literatures generally kept\napart: one on residential mobility and the other on neighborhood effects. The former\nis about why families move and where they move. The latter is about whether, how,\nand how much where they live (neighborhood context) affects child and family well-\nbeing. Well-being is a broad construct that includes physical and mental health,\neconomic self-sufficiency, and more (reviews in Ellen and Turner 2003; Leventhal\non well-being has largely focused on what conditions might be sufficient to produce\nneighborhood effects. In this paper, we focus instead on a key necessary condition,\nespecially for many low-income and minority families in the housing market:\nMoving to and staying in comparatively advantaged neighborhoods. We begin with\na brief review of the foundational literature on the residential mobility of unassisted\nhouseholds before focusing on the distinctive patterns for assisted ones. We include a\nbrief discussion of policy design and implementation dilemmas in assisted housing\nmobility as well, tied to our research questions.\nUnassisted households: locational choices and outcomes\nA large research literature examines residential choice and locational outcomes, with\na focus on a majority of households that do not receive the housing subsidies\ntargeted to low-income households. First, centered on the residential satisfaction\nmodel, research on mobility decisions emphasizes the importance of life-cycle\nfactors, such as age and family status, and the salience of both housing unit traits\nand traits of the surrounding neighborhood in triggering moves (Clark and\nGoldstein, and Frey 1975). In addition, this literature on why families move reminds\nus of the importance of what the Census Bureau terms ``involuntary'' factors, such as\njob loss, death, divorce, eviction, fire, unaffordable mortgage or rent, or non-renewal\nof lease (for example, due to property sale), as triggers for moves. Notably,\nresidential mobility has declined for most demographic groups in America in recent\ndecades. But it has increased for low-skill, low-income households. They are much\nmore likely than higher-skill counterparts to be renters, who move four to five times\nas often as owners, and to make involuntary moves (Fischer 2002; Schacter 2004).\nConversely, such households are much less likely to make nonlocal moves toward\neconomic opportunity, for example, to take a job in another region (Fischer 2002).\nInvoluntary moves and the long-run loss of housing affordable to the lowest income\nhouseholds may explain why children move much more often in the United States\nthan other wealthy nations (Long 1992). This gap reminds us that some forms of\nresidential mobility, especially frequent moving in search of a secure and affordable\nsetting, can be a big negative for families.7\nBut residential satisfaction and mobility rate studies do little to explain where\nfamilies move to, whether at points in time or in trajectories of moves over time. On\nthe latter front, a second literature has focused on the where of housing preferences\nand outcomes. The economic model of locational choice emphasizes that households\ntry to optimize a multi-attribute bundle of housing traits, which includes safety,\naccess, and other traits of locations (Galster 2003). But research across disciplines\nhighlights, among other factors, the importance of racial attitudes, discrimination,\nand patterns of neighborhood change over time. First, most households prefer some\nracial or cultural ``comfort zone'' \u00ad a factor that interracial class differences alone do\nnot explain well (Charles 2005). Yet there is frequently a mismatch between such\nneighborhood make-up preferences and the neighborhoods actually available (Bruch\nexpress a desire to live in more integrated areas but find a limited supply of available,\naffordable neighborhoods that fit their preferred range; some rely on referral\nnetworks that lack information on such places (see review in Charles 2005). Whites\nin America report a growing tolerance of, if not always an appetite for, greater\nneighborhood integration but tend to define their comfort zone in ways that lead to\nSecond, while racial discrimination in rental and ownership housing markets\nhas declined overall in recent decades, it continues to affect minority as well as\nwhite housing choices, adding an informal ``tax'' (higher lease-up or other fees) to\n7Clearly, some types of moves have long been associated with social mobility as well as escape\nfrom undesirable places. But as every parent knows, moving can be harmful as well. Recent\nresearch on child and adolescent development has underscored the deleterious effects of\nfrequent moving on children and adolescents, net of other factors, including poorer emotional\nhealth, weaker academic outcomes, strained family relationships, smaller and less stable peer\nnetworks, and even a greater risk of gravitating toward deviant or delinquent peers after\narriving in new schools and communities (Barlett 1997; Haynie and South 2005; Haynie,\nSouth, and Bose 2006; Pribesh and Downey 1999). Drawing on fieldwork among low-income\nAfrican-Americans, researchers and family therapists have emphasized the importance of\nsecuring ``the homeplace'' \u00ad comprising ``individual and family processes that are anchored in\na defined physical place and that elicit feelings of empowerment, rootedness, ownership,\nsafety, and renewal'' (Burton et al. 2004, 397) \u00ad and the difficulty many families face in\nsecuring such a homeplace.\nthe transaction costs of moving and/or steering households \u00ad both whites and\nminorities \u00ad toward particular neighborhoods in ways that reproduce segregation\nThird and finally, most demographic research on housing patterns describes\naggregate patterns for groups over time, not the trajectories of individual\nhouseholds, obscuring important features of housing choice and also of supply.\nSince the 1960s, geographers, sociologists, and other analysts of ``vacancy chains''\nhave modeled churning, filtering, and other systems-level dynamics, whether with\nPersky and Felsenstein 2008; White 1971). But a newer body of research, focused on\nMTO-type prospects of households, finds that as minority poverty concentration\nsoared in the 1970s and 1980s, blacks were about as likely as whites to ``exit'' poor\nneighborhoods (South and Crowder 1997). Most exited by moving, not because\nneighborhood change led to a much lower-poverty rate over time (Quillian 2003).\nBut blacks were far more likely than whites to move from one poor neighborhood to\nanother and also to re-enter a poor neighborhood fairly quickly after residing\noutside of one. The latter factor \u00ad ``recurrence'' \u00ad helps explain blacks' much longer\nexposure than whites to neighborhood poverty over time (Quillian 2003; Timberlake\n2007), a gap that is not explained by racial differences in income or household\nstructure. That gap persisted into the 1990s, even as extreme poverty concentration\ndeclined, and appears to be dominated by black renters; it is not accounted for by\nblacks moving to transitional neighborhoods that became poor after they moved\n(Briggs and Keys 2009). Until recently, data limitations made it impossible to\ncompare transitions and exposure over time for unassisted versus assisted\nhouseholds, whose fortunes we turn to next.8\nAssisted households: locational choices and outcomes\nBy some measures, voucher holders appear to be quite clustered in particular\nneighborhoods or types of neighborhoods. According to a 2003 HUD report that\nexamined the nation's 50 largest housing markets, the spatial clustering of vouchers is\nfar greater than the dispersion of housing units at affordable rents alone would predict:\n25% of black recipients and 28% of Hispanic recipients live in high-poverty\nneighborhoods, compared to only 8% of white recipients, and yet the voucher\nprogram utilizes only about 6% of all units with rents below the HUD-designated Fair\nMarket Rents (US Department of Housing and Urban Development 2003). This study\ncould not determine the units actually available to interested voucher users, of course.\nIf landlords are unwilling to rent to them, for example, rent levels do not matter much.\nVoucher holders typically cluster in moderate-to-high-poverty neighborhoods of\nin distinct corridors or ``hot spots'' where affordable rental housing tends to be more\nabundant and minority concentration high (Hartung and Henig 1997; McClure\n8Latinos appear to occupy an intermediate position, with more favorable locational\ntrajectories than blacks but less favorable ones than whites (South, Crowder, and Chavez\n2005), and also to show substantial variation among nationality groups (e.g., Cuban, Mexican,\nPuerto Rican); data limitations have made it impossible to study longitudinal patterns among\nAsians.\nneighborhoods or racial ghettos that are relatively vulnerable to decline (Galster,\nCensus 2000, voucher recipients in the five MTO cities \u00ad that is, the overall program\npopulations, beyond the relatively small population of MTO participants at each\nsite \u00ad lived in a census tract that ranged from 71% minority, on average, in Boston to\n91% minority in Chicago. We return to the issue of voucher concentration and\nsubmarkets in the ``Results'' section.\nBut what are voucher users' neighborhood trajectories over time, that is,\nconsidering those who remain on housing assistance? Analysis of the nearly 630,000\nhouseholds that entered the Housing Choice Voucher program between 1995 and 2002\nindicates that most lease-ups were in neighborhoods with poverty rates of about 20%\n(about the same as the pre-program neighborhoods for those who leased up in new\nunits) and that, over subsequent moves, voucher holders tended to make only modest\nimprovements in neighborhood traits such as poverty rate and percent minority (Feins\nand Patterson 2005). The analysis also found that the voucher households most likely\nto move repeatedly are black, lower income, with younger children, and households\nliving in moderately poor (20\u00ad39% poor) neighborhoods, not low-poverty or high-\npoverty neighborhoods. Yet if they moved, black households experienced larger mean\nneighborhood improvement than whites or Hispanics.9 Similarly, using the geocoded\nPSID data linked to data on housing assistance receipt, Newman and Harkness (2000)\nfound that MTO-like moves, from high- to low-poverty areas, are extremely rare for\nthose on housing assistance (about 6% of all moves); nearly two-thirds (62%) of moves\nare from one extremely poor neighborhood to another.\nWhat explains these patterns? Some researchers, typically using structured\nsurveys of clients, have focused on voucher users' preferences and resources, as well\nas the supply-side barriers they face in the marketplace. As for preferences, research\nhas largely been confined to identifying priorities: Safety and proximity to relatives\nand friends rank particularly high for assisted households, and there is some\nevidence that these are threshold concerns \u00ad more important, on average, for clients\nthan good schools or proximity to job locations (Basolo and Nguyen 2006; Johnson\n2005; Priemus, Kemp, and Varady 2005). Voucher holders \u00ad very low-income family,\nsenior, and disabled households \u00ad also tend to identify proximity to public\ntransportation as a priority; housing counselors similarly tell researchers that\n``accessibility'' or ``getting around'' are top concerns for their clients, especially those\nwho live in relatively transit-rich central cities and are asked to consider moving\nfarther out (Varady and Walker 2000, 2007). Understanding locational priorities is\nimportant for obvious reasons, but so is understanding a willingness to make trade-\noffs among those priorities, and prior research has had little to say about that.\nResearch has also emphasized important demand-side barriers, such as: (a) the\ndebilitating mental and physical health problems found disproportionately in the\nhousing-assisted population \u00ad including the so-called ``hard to house'' \u00ad where public\n9As the researchers note, the finding that those in the most disadvantaged places are less likely\nto move may reflect negative selection: The fact that households that lease up in those areas\nface additional, unobserved challenges. In a controlled experiment, Abt Associates et al.\n(2006) found that voucher-holding welfare families enjoyed some improvement in locational\noutcomes over time, reflecting both economic and racial integration, when compared to\nwelfare families that did not receive housing vouchers. Families who entered the\ndemonstration while living in ``stressful arrangements,'' including high-poverty public\nhousing, were particularly likely to experience locational improvements.\nor assisted housing has been demolished and ``vouchered out'' in favor of mixed-\nincome redevelopment (Popkin, Cunningham, and Burt 2005; Popkin and Cove\ndesegregation programs (Pashup et al. 2005); and (b) limited time, money, trans-\nportation, information, and other resources important to effective housing search\nconcerned, Varady and Walker's (2007) multi-city study of vouchering out found\nthat voucher holders leaving public housing were more likely to find out about\navailable apartments from friends and relatives, newspaper ads, or real estate listings\nthan from housing counselors.10\nBeyond preferences and demand-side barriers, researchers consistently identify a\nrange of supply-side barriers as well. First, there is reported discrimination based on\nrace, family status (e.g. presence of young children), or source of income, that is, the\nuse of the voucher itself. In most states and localities, landlords are not required to\naccept vouchers, and requirements elsewhere are loosely enforced. There is some\nevidence that source-of-income discrimination is more prevalent than racial\ndiscrimination, at least in some local housing markets (Varady and Walker 2007).\nNext, there is the scarcity of affordable and otherwise voucher-appropriate\nhousing units in many communities, especially in tight housing markets where much\nPendall 2000). This scarcity reflects the dwindling supply of rental housing affordable\nto those at the lowest incomes, including the working poor. Some 1.2 million low-\nrent units (units costing $400 or less per month, including utilities) were lost between\nhouseholds experiencing ``worst-case housing needs,'' defined by HUD as falling\nbelow 50% of area median income and either paying more than half of household\nincome for housing or living in substandard housing (or both), surged by 16%, or\ntendency of many low-poverty jurisdictions to exclude such housing is at issue here\nas well. That is, the scarcity problem reflects the geographic concentration of\naccessible supply, not just the limited volume of that supply (Briggs 2005; Pendall\nFinally, market conditions also shape outcomes: As of 2001, voucher recipients\nin very tight markets were about 20% less likely than those in loose ones (61% vs.\n80%) to lease up anywhere (Finkel and Buron 2001), and market tightness, as we will\nshow, was especially important for MTO families who wanted to stay in low-poverty\nareas but had to move repeatedly. Yet program capacity also matters: Research on\ncertain less studied markets \u00ad such as Alameda County, California, where local\nhousing agencies are well-managed \u00ad shows relatively high lease-up rates over the\nlong run even among families who used vouchers in unfamiliar suburbs, where the\nrental market was often tight (Varady and Walker 2007).\nWith the exception of Gautreaux, where long-run administrative data are\navailable, and of Varady and Walker's survey evidence on ``returnees'' in the\n10Most voucher users relocated to predominantly black or racially changing areas of the local\nmarket. In addition, more than half of the voucher users in their study reported wanting to\nmove again, and even many who were satisfied with their current housing voiced that wish \u00ad\nciting pressure to move out of public housing quickly and feeling that they had ``settled'' for a\nsatisfactory unit rather than one that was ``just right'' for their family (p.153).\nAlameda sample (those who initially relocated to suburbs but later returned to the\ncity), research on these issues has focused on initial relocation outcomes. There is no\nempirical research we know of on the important question of how supply- and\ndemand-side factors interact over time to shape locational outcomes for particular\nvoucher users \u00ad an interaction that is best understood, we argue, when housing\nchoices are viewed in the context of families' larger life strategies and challenges, that\nis, more holistically than conventional survey studies of household priorities and\nlocational outcomes can do. Before we outline our approach to these research gaps,\nwe briefly review the distinctive policy dilemmas facing assisted mobility interven-\ntions such as MTO.\nPolicy design and implementation dilemmas\nAssisted mobility programs confront important dilemmas about which clients to\ntarget, how to operationalize ``choice,'' which locations to target, and how to\nimplement effectively. First, it is not clear that the most disadvantaged populations \u00ad\nthose that are not only income poor but face barriers to life functioning in the form\nof chronic physical or illness, substance use, or other problems \u00ad are well suited to\nassisted relocation. At least, such hard-to-house populations may not be suited to\nrelocation strategies right away and not without intensive social services or other\nattention has focused on the rigors of involuntary relocation by these extremely\ndisadvantaged households, such as when public housing projects are demolished, but\nsignificant barriers to functioning are also evident in MTO, wherein families\nvolunteered for the chance to escape public and assisted housing in high-poverty\nneighborhoods. These major barriers were highlighted in the early assessment of\ncounseling challenges in MTO (Feins, McInnis, and Popkin 1997) but largely\nignored in research on MTO thereafter.\nSecond, given the range of constraints faced by assisted households, simple\n``choice'' may never be enough to dramatically change locational outcomes \u00ad and\nsome not-so-simple alternatives pose legal and political dilemmas of their own. Most\nlocal housing programs appear to lack the will and/or the way (capacity) to inform\nvoucher holders' choices about the range of neighborhoods that have affordable,\neligible units in them; the focus is on leasing up affordable units quickly (Johnson\nin the tight markets where voucher holders struggle most, it may be that ``intensive\nhousing placement'' \u00ad a\n` la Gautreaux, wherein placement counselors ``lined up'' the\nunits in racially integrated communities \u00ad and not simply helping families search, is\nthe key to lowering poverty concentration and racial segregation in the voucher\nprogram.11 Also, families' unwillingness to make particular kinds of moves might be\na major determinant of MTO housing trajectories and locational outcomes over the\nlong run. This was an issue for initial lease-ups in both Gautreaux and MTO (Feins,\n11Such placement is the defining feature of the relatively uncommon, small-scale unit-based (as\nopposed to voucher-based) approaches to housing mobility for low-income families, such as in\ndefines supply-side strategies such as inclusionary zoning and area ``fair share'' requirements--\nat least when they include very low income households--and efforts to preserve affordable\nsupply in ``better'' neighborhoods, such as in the federal Mark to Market reforms for project-\nbased Section 8 housing.\nThird, as for which locations to target, voucher users and policy analysts and\nadvocates may not be on the proverbial same page in terms of what neighborhood\n``quality'' means. Poverty rates, racial composition, local school performance, and\nother measures are obviously proxies for the value of a particular residential\nlocation, and as noted above, safety and proximity to loved ones may be the\ndominant considerations for most assisted households. In some instances, these\nfactors conflict with the aim of improving locational outcomes, for example, when\nfamilies feel torn between seeking safer neighborhoods (which may be further away)\nand staying close to relatives (which often means moving nearby).\nFourth and finally, effective implementation is a challenge. Because the success of\nvoucher-based assisted housing mobility programs, like that of the voucher program\ngenerally, hinge on a chain of cooperative action by landlords, tenants, housing\nagencies, and sometimes organized interest groups, Briggs and Turner (2006, 59)\nconclude, ``This element of the nation's opportunity agenda is particularly\nvulnerable to the strong-idea-weakly-implemented problem.'' Given the risk of\nNIMBY-ism and other sources of resistance, as well as a history of limited\ncooperation among local housing agencies in each metropolitan housing market,\nimplementing effectively at scale becomes a particularly challenging prospect\nMethodological background: why launch a social experiment? What is MTO testing?\nMobility patterns and locational outcomes were important but intermediate\nconcerns \u00ad means toward an end \u00ad when MTO was launched. The experiment's\nintended end outcomes were improvements in the well-being and economic prospects\nof participating children and families, that is, improvements in education, economic\nself-sufficiency, health and mental health, youth risky behavior, and other domains.\nIn this section, we highlight selected features of the MTO design, which is well\ndocumented elsewhere (e.g. Orr et al. 2003), and how the experiment has evolved as a\nwindow on housing choice and locational outcomes.\nIn 1994, MTO's local program managers invited very low-income residents of\npublic housing and project-based assisted housing to participate. All were in high-\npoverty neighborhoods of Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York.\nThe mean baseline location was a striking 56% poor in 1990 \u00ad much higher than the\n40% threshold that analysts have used to define extreme or ``ghetto'' poverty\n93% of whom were black or Hispanic, met payment record and other basic eligibility\nrequirements. Those families were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment\ngroups: a control group (families retained their public housing unit but received no\nnew assistance), a Section 8 comparison group (families received the standard\ncounseling, centered on how to lease up but not emphasizing the benefits of choosing\nlow-poverty areas, and standard voucher subsidy, for use in the private market), or\nan experimental group. The experimental-group families received relocation\ncounseling (focused on opportunities to live in low-poverty areas) and search\nassistance (often in the form of accompanied visits and transportation to vacant\nunits); the supplemental services provided and the specific roles played by public\nversus nonprofit housing agencies varied considerably across the sites (Feins,\nMcInnis, and Popkin 1997). The experimental group also received a voucher useable\nonly in a low-poverty neighborhood (less than 10% poor as of the 1990 census), with\nthe requirement that the family live there for at least a year. After the initial\nplacement, no families received additional relocation counseling or special assistance\nfrom the program, nor did any face program-imposed locational restrictions\nafter the first year. So there was no feature of the demonstration to specifically\nencourage families to choose another low-poverty neighborhood if and when they\nmoved on.\nOf the 1820 families assigned to the experimental group, just under half (47% or\n860) found a suitable apartment and moved successfully (leased up) in the time\nallotted, becoming the program's ``compliers'' \u00ad a 20% improvement over the\nGautreaux program. Those who did not successfully lease-up are noncompliers (still\nmembers of the experiment group: MTOX in our plots). The experimental-group\nfamilies most likely to lease up had fewer children, access to a car, more confidence\nabout finding an apartment, greater dissatisfaction with their origin neighborhood,\nand no church ties to the origin neighborhood; a looser rental market and more\nintensive counseling services were also significant predictors of success (Shroder\n2003). The program's early impacts included dramatic improvements in neighbor-\nhood poverty rates and participants' reports of safety and security \u00ad but not rates of\nHousing tenure, assistance receipt, and the frequency of moves, which are both\ncause and effect of broader housing choices and opportunities, did not change\nsignificantly for any of the treatment groups. By the interim mark, that is, the\nevaluation point four to seven years after random assignment, about 70% of MTO\nhouseholds continued to receive some form of housing assistance, about 90% (in\nall three groups) were still renters, and the low-income renters who dominate the\nMTO patterns showed the comparatively high rates of residential mobility that\ncharacterize poor renters nationwide; there were no substantial differences among\ntreatment groups in length of time residing in their current housing unit (Orr et al.\nlikely to report feeling safe, to report less social disorder in their neighborhoods, and\nto report feeling satisfied with their neighborhoods (Orr et al. 2003, 42).\nBut what, in fact, is the treatment, and what is MTO testing? Like other social\nexperiments, MTO has evolved in the real world and not under controlled laboratory\nconditions. First, 67% of the experimental complier group had moved at least once\nmore by the interim mark, and, according to Orr et al. (2003), that group was only\nhalf as likely (18% vs. 38%) as compliers who stayed put to be living in a neigh-\nborhood less than 10% poor. The most common reasons for compliers' moving on\nwere involuntary: problems with the lease (22%), which may include failed unit\ninspections, rent increases, and decisions to sell the unit or for other reasons not to\nrenew the voucher holder's lease; and conflicts with the landlord (20%). But almost\nas many families (18%) reported wanting a bigger or better apartment.\nAs we noted above, MTO's program content helped families get to particular\nkinds of neighborhoods, not stay in them or move to similar neighborhoods over\ntime. Still, a strong desire to stay in similar neighborhoods was evident by the interim\nmark, when two-thirds of those who had moved since initial relocation reported\nsearching for housing in the same neighborhoods. The larger point is that additional\nmoves introduce additional family-level selection effects on locational outcomes over\ntime, making it difficult to attribute particular outcomes to the intervention as\none moves beyond treatment-group differences to analyze outcomes for distinct\nsubgroups within the treatment groups (as we do). For this reason in particular,\nmost of our results are descriptive in nature, not presented as unbiased estimates of\ntreatment effects or ``program causality'' (see Kling, Liebman, and Katz 2007).\nSecond, many of the low-poverty areas that served as initial destinations for the\nexperimental group have changed over time, through no choice of the participants.\nCensus data show that while most were relatively stable in terms of income levels,\ninner-city neighborhoods were becoming less poor. Third, about 70% of the control\ngroup had also moved by the interim mark \u00ad most to other poor neighborhoods but\nwith a mean reduction in neighborhood poverty rate from 51% to 34% (when\ncompared to control-group members who did not move). One reason for these\nmoves was public housing demolition and revitalization programs, HOPE VI most\nimportantly, which received a major boost from federal policy and local mayors and\nadvocates just as MTO was starting up. But the key point is that many members of\nthe MTO control group are movers too, some with vouchers, about one-quarter\nliving in neighborhoods below 20% poverty by the interim point, rather than\nmembers of a fixed-in-place comparison category.\nStill, at the interim point that preceded our fieldwork by about two years, families\nin the MTO experimental group were about 13% more likely than the control group,\nand experimental compliers 27% more likely, to be living in very low-poverty areas;\nthe experimental group had also lived in such areas for longer periods of time (Orr\net al. 2003, 42). The experimental group has had an exceptional experience vis-a\n` -vis\nthe dominant pattern for low-income housing assistance nationwide. MTO is thus a\ntest of at least two important things for families who used to live in high-poverty\npublic housing and project-based assisted housing: (a) the experience and effects of\nliving in much lower-poverty neighborhoods over some period of time; and (b) the\nexperience and effects of relocating, after initial counseling and search assistance, to\nlow-poverty neighborhoods, and, in some cases, relocating again to a range of\nneighborhood types, while raising children and handling other life challenges.\nData and method\nThe Three-City Study of Moving to Opportunity was designed to examine key puzzles\nthat emerged in the MTO interim impacts evaluation. Based on HUD authorization of\nour team and another research team, we conducted our study in three of the five MTO\nsites \u00ad greater Boston, Los Angeles, and New York \u00ad but for comparison, conducted\ncertain analyses using data on greater Baltimore and Chicago as well. We focused on\n``how'' and ``why'' questions: To better understand what statistical analyses of close-\nended surveys have been unable to explain, we employed a mixed-method strategy that\nincluded extensive qualitative fieldwork. Qualitative approaches are particularly\nimportant for (a) understanding why participants in social programs make the choices\nthey do and (b) understanding significant variation in outcomes within and not just\nbetween treatment groups. But these aims are distinct from (c) making causal claims\nabout the effects of the treatment.\nThe study featured three main components: statistical analyses of changing metro\nareas and neighborhoods, using the 1990 and 2000 censuses plus administrative data\n(for types used in this paper, see sources in table notes), and mapping for key themes;\na large random sample of qualitative interviews; and a random subsample selected\nfor follow-on ethnographic fieldwork. This paper includes a fourth component as\nwell: statistical analysis of geocoded MTO interim survey data, obtained under\nspecial agreement with HUD and Abt Associates, to examine housing trajectories\nand locations over time.\nOur family-level qualitative data, from the interview and ethnography\ninitial placement through the MTO program and about two years after the interim\nsurvey data were collected. First, we interviewed 122 randomly selected families,\nconducting a total of 276 semi-structured, in-depth qualitative interviews with\nparents, adolescents, and young adults in all three treatment groups, including\ncompliers and noncompliers in the experimental and Section 8 comparison groups\n(sampling randomly within the stratum of families who had an adolescent child\nresident in the home at the time of the interview). Overall, we conducted 81\ninterviews in Boston, 120 in Los Angeles, and 75 in New York, offering monetary\nincentives (for details on coding, interview length and content, and more, see\nBriggs et al. 2008). The combined cooperation rate (consents as a share of eligible\nhouseholds contacted) for the interviews was 79%, and the response rate was 70%.12\nThe sample covers the full range of outcomes for all three MTO treatment groups\nand both complier statuses, a key to generating representative results.\nTo enhance validity and extend our data on priority themes, the ethnographic\nfieldwork added direct observation to what participants reported about their\nattitudes, choices, and outcomes. We did ``family-focused'' ethnography (Burton\nweeks, over a period of six to eight months, for about two hours at a time (for a total\nof 430 visits). To select these 39, we sampled randomly within the 122 interview\nhouseholds, oversampling for ``locational success'' among experimental compliers\n(where success was defined as residing in a low-poverty neighborhood at the time of\nthe interview). The response rate for this subsample was 70% (households that\nconsented initially and with whom we completed data collection on each ``core\nconstruct,'' see below). We provided monetary incentives (cash and/or gift cards) for\nboth the formal interviews and ethnographic field visits.\nUnlike more established traditions in ethnography \u00ad for example, community, in-\nschool, or peer-group studies \u00ad family-focused ethnography centers on developing\nrich, valid accounts of family-level decisions and outcomes, including efforts to\nsupport and advance children, parents, elders, or other family members (Burton\n1997). The fieldwork focused on the core constructs of families' lives, such as a daily\nroutines to ``get life accomplished'' (Burton 1997), important social relations, and\nthe details of engagement (or lack of same) in their neighborhood of residence and\nother neighborhoods (such as those where relatives or close friends lived). The\nfieldwork was a blend of naturalistic (unstructured) interviewing, semi-structured\ninterviewing, and direct observation of family life inside and outside the home.\nChi-square analyses confirm that both samples are quite representative of the\nmuch larger population of MTO families surveyed at the interim mark in terms\nof background traits, employment status, and a range of other social outcomes\n(Table 1). In terms of sample outcomes, we modestly under-represent Hispanics and\nover-represent families on welfare in the ethnographic component (p 5 0.05).

The integration of distinct types of data to answer central research\nquestions is crucial for generating richer, more valid results and actionable specifics to\nguide decision-makers. Mixed-method approaches are also crucial for building better\ntheory, over time, from a base of complex and mixed results.\nBut we caution the reader about the need to appropriately interpret the different\ntypes of data. For example, the ethnographic field data, while drawn from a random\nsample that generated wide range in the phenomena under study, follows a case\nstudy logic rather than a sampling logic. The case-study approach allows us to\nunderstand family circumstances as integrated constructs \u00ad families as cases that are\nrevealing for the conditions that covary within them \u00ad without indicating how\ncommon those constructs are across the program population as a whole (Ragin 1987;\nSmall 2008; Yin 1994). Survey results, if the measures are valid, tell us what we can\nreliably conclude about a large population but with little insight into the underlying\nsocial processes of interest. On the other hand, ethnographic and other qualitative\nmethods provide the depth and texture that illuminate such processes \u00ad housing\nchoices as the subjects themselves perceive and make them in a social context, for\nexample \u00ad but typically without precise population inferences. The results are not\nless ``true'' where we cannot indicate, with precision, what share of the larger\npopulation particular cases represent. Put differently, small-N results can be ``big''\n(in importance), but this does not settle the issue of how prevalent they are.13\nResults\nTwo main research questions guided this study. First, beyond short-run success or\nfailure at finding units in particular kinds of neighborhoods, what are the\nneighborhood trajectories over time for families served by assisted housing mobility?\nSecond, how do housing supply and demand-side factors interact over time to shape\nthose trajectories?\nWe begin by placing MTO relocation patterns in their metropolitan contexts,\nincluding: (a) the large-scale population settlement shifts that MTO relocations\nparalleled to a significant degree; (b) the spatial patterns for the full population of\nvoucher holders (not just MTO participants) in each housing market, that is, as local\nbenchmarks for the MTO treatment groups; and (c) the significant differences,\nbetween MTO metro areas, in the distribution of neighborhood types (for example,\nthe number and share of neighborhoods in a given metro that featured concentrated\nminority poverty versus the prospect of racial or economic integration). Then we\nexamine the housing trajectories of MTO families and the supply- and demand-side\nfactors that shaped their locational choices and outcomes.\nRelocations in metropolitan context\nEarlier MTO research has focused on mean locational outcomes in terms of census\ntraits (Feins 2003; Orr et al. 2003). But tracts lie within larger zones \u00ad such as\ntransitional inner-ring suburbs \u00ad that often change in distinctive ways as metro areas\nchange. We begin by describing these subareas as MTO destinations, including\nvoucher-clustering patterns. We grouped relocation outcomes into rings according to\n13All personal names below are pseudonyms, and sublocal places are disguised.\ndistance from the central business district (CBD) of each metro, measuring the\ndistance from the CBD core to the centroid of each tract in the metro, then grouping\nthe distance measures into rings corresponding to the first, second, and third thirds\nwithin the central city, as well as thirds within the suburbs. Table 2 reports on\ncompliers only, and due to limitations on the administrative data available, it\npresents 2004 locations for ``all voucher holders'' alongside 2002 locations for MTO\nparticipants.\nRelocation zones\nWhereas the Gautreaux program's desegregative lease-ups in suburban commu-\nnities placed families in middle-class, mostly white areas 15\u00ad20 miles from their\nmostly black origin neighborhoods in Chicago, in all five MTO metros, the first\nand only assisted relocation made by MTO experimental compliers was typically to\na low-poverty, majority\u00adminority neighborhood in the outer ring of the central city\n(about two-thirds of all compliers) or in an economically diverse inner suburb (by\nwhich we mean an area with a wide range of income levels) proximate to the\ncentral city (about one-third), not to more distant, affluent, or racially integrated\nBy the interim mark, the distribution of MTO voucher holders across rings, in\nboth treatment groups, matched that of all voucher holders in those cities at roughly\nthe same time. But experimental-group compliers remained more dispersed: Half\nwere in census tracts where fewer than 2% of the households held vouchers,\ncompared to just one-fifth of the Section 8 comparison-group compliers and 38% of\nall voucher holders in these metro areas.\nWhat area-wide changes affected the zones MTO families lived in? A doubling of\nthe suburban poor population in the 1990s, for example, was concentrated in older,\ninner-ring suburbs, where minority suburbanization also tends to be concentrated\noutnumbered the poor in their central cities by more than one million persons\n(Berube and Kneebone 2006). And a resurgence of housing demand in central cities\npushed rents and sales prices upward much faster than incomes in many urban\nneighborhoods.\nWe will focus briefly on the market-specific character of these changes at our\nthree study sites alongside the MTO-triggered ``starting points'' (initial relocations)\nfor the experimental compliers, since policymakers' hopes were highest for them.\nIn Gautreaux, housing counselors acted as placement agents, lining up units, in a\nrelatively loose market, that were offered on a take-it-or-leave-it basis to those on\nthe waiting list. In MTO, where clients would choose their units, supply-side\nconstraints quickly led to a variety of local compromises: Early assessment\nsuggested that while all five sites tried to expand the pool of participating\nlandlords, limited staff capacity and limited payoff curtailed such efforts (Feins,\nMcInnis, and Popkin 1997). Counselors found their pre-existing landlord lists most\n``productive'' as sources of vacancies. Also, vacancies for certain types of rental\n14Note how inadequate it can be to denote neighborhoods or localities according to poverty\nrate alone. Some low-poverty areas are home to households with a wide range of incomes and\nsocio-economic status (including the poor, up to some threshold level), while other low-\npoverty areas, such as affluent suburbs, have almost no diversity on that dimension.\nTable 2.

Finally, rental brokers provided shortcuts to\nlandlords who were willing to accept vouchers, at least at some sites. Boston\nprogram staff estimated, for example, that 20% to 25% of their placements were\nsecured through brokers.\nRelocation vis-a`-vis metropolitan restructuring\nNew York City compliers were concentrated initially in small rental properties in the\nNortheast Bronx \u00ad where the nonprofit placement agent's landlord contacts were\nconcentrated and where vacancies were numerous \u00ad with a handful moved to Staten\nIsland, having relocated primarily from public housing in Central Harlem and the\nSouth Bronx. This program-induced mobility tracked a larger movement of people\nof color, including middle-income black and Hispanic homebuyers, to the city's\nouter core and inner suburbs; Harlem and Brooklyn, the historic centers of black\nsettlement, gentrified and became home to more whites, while the South Bronx\nbecame ever-more Hispanic thanks largely to immigration (Furman Center for Real\nEstate and Urban Policy 2005). But deep pockets of poverty and black and Hispanic\nconcentration remained in those three areas, where many of the city's most\naffordable rentals are concentrated; according to HUD, inflation-adjusted gross\nblack migration out of the New York region, mostly toward the Southern US, where\nhandful of MTO families tracked that migration as well.\nBoston MTO families relocated from the inner-city neighborhoods of Dorche-\nster, Roxbury, and South Boston mainly to small rental properties in the city's\neconomically diverse outer core neighborhoods or to transitional inner-suburb\ncommunities on the North and South Shore, such as Brockton, Quincy, Revere, and\nRandolph. Those suburbs became poorer and more racially diverse in the 1990s as\nthe job-rich western suburbs along the Route 128 high-tech corridor, where school\ndistricts are strongest, remained overwhelmingly white and middle- to upper-income\nthe growing poverty in these outer-core and inner-ring suburban areas on the\nregion's north-south axis (the ``stacking'' of data points in central Boston masks the\ndrop in poverty in inner-city neighborhoods). One experimental complier we\ninterviewed in suburban Boston conveyed her perception of growing poverty\nconcentration quite bluntly: ``I left the ghetto, but the ghetto followed me.'' As of the\n2000 Census, three-quarters of metro Boston's poor lived in the suburbs. And Stuart\n(2000) found that half of the home purchases made by black and Hispanic\nhomebuyers outside the central city between 1993 and 1998 were made in just seven\nof the metro region's 126 municipalities; those seven were relatively affordable\ntowns, where poverty and fiscal distress grew in the 1990s and where school district\nperformance is much poorer than the affluent suburbs. Meanwhile, many central-city\nneighborhoods gentrified dramatically; gross rents jumped 15% in real terms\nincreases.\n15Rents were measured in 2005 dollars. See US HUD State of the Cities Data System\n(SOCDS) at http://socds.huduser.org/index.html [accessed August 2, 2007].\nIn Boston and New York, MTO experimental compliers left behind high-\npoverty and high crime but transit-rich areas that were close to the CBD for\nmore car-reliant areas with dispersed services and job locations. In sprawling Los\nAngeles, their counterparts left inner-city neighborhoods in South and East LA\nSource: see Table 2.\nNote: MTOX=Experimental group.\nfor transitional southern suburbs nearby (e.g. Compton and Lynwood), as well as\ncommunities in the sprawling San Fernando Valley (about 15 to 30 miles from\norigin, to the north), Long Beach to the southwest, and rapidly expanding and\nincreasingly diverse eastern suburbs and satellite cities 40 to 60 miles from origin,\nmainly in adjacent Riverside and San Bernardino Counties \u00ad the once-agricultural\n``Inland Empire'' where many low- and moderate-income Angelenos have moved\nin response to the city's desperate shortage of affordable housing. For the MTO\nfamilies that lacked reliable access to a car, transit options in most of these\ndestination communities were poor.\nMetro Los Angeles saw a large outmigration of non-Hispanic whites, together\nwith rapid immigration from Asia and Latin America, throughout the 1990s and\ninto the new decade (Frey 2006), as well as growth in extreme poverty concentration,\ncounter to the national trend (Jargowsky 2003). Closer to the streets, those aggregate\nchanges were reflected in dramatic patterns of ethnic succession and competition as\nwell (Zhou and Myers 2006). For example, many long-black neighborhoods in South\nLA \u00ad known as ``South Central'' until the 1992 riots inspired a name change \u00ad\nbecame mixed areas of poor black and Hispanic, or even majority-Hispanic and\nSpanish-language-dominant settlement.\nHousing market trends\nMTO has operated in some of the nation's costliest housing markets. Four of the five\nMTO sites had tight housing markets before the demonstration began, and they\nremained significantly tighter than the national average over the course of the\ndemonstration (Figure 2).16 In 1990, only Chicago's vacancy rate essentially matched\nthe national rate, with Baltimore and Boston close behind. LA and New York were,\neven at that recessionary point, at or below the 4\u00ad6% vacancy rates estimated for the\ntypical rental market's ``natural'' vacancy rate, that is, equilibrium corresponding to\nno downward or upward pressure on real rents (Gabriel and Nothaft 1988, 2001). By\nthe end of the decade, as rental markets grew tighter in many metros nationwide,\nvacancy rates plummeted in all five MTO metros and most of all in those places that\nbegan the decade as tighter markets. Greater Boston, LA, and New York \u00ad our study\nsites \u00ad became extremely tight (rate 5 3\u00ad4%), and in the LA case, the trend toward\nan ever-greater scarcity of vacant rentals persisted into the new decade, right through\nthe latest recession.\nAs Figure 3 shows, the HUD-defined fair market rent (FMR) trends mirror\nimage those vacancy rate trends: While the increases were not monotonic, our\nthree study sites began and remained the most expensive of the five MTO\nmetropolitan housing markets, clustered in the $1100 to $1300 per month range by\nthe national increase of 6%, while Boston and New York saw sharp increases (9%)\nas well (data not shown). By 2004, when we visited MTO families, the rental\nmarkets in Los Angeles and New York were imposing very widespread hardships.\nHere, we must rely on county-level data from the 2004 American Community\n16We used HUD-designated and provided fair market rent (FMR) geographies to track price\ntrends. These areas are not determined solely by housing market analysis by HUD but by the\nlaws and regulations governing the HCV program.\nSurvey: More than half of all Los Angeles and New York City renters (54% and\n51%, respectively), and nearly half in Baltimore, Boston, and Chicago (48%), paid\nmore than 30% of their income for housing, compared to the national average of\nSource: US Department of Housing and Urban Development, ``FMR HUD History 1983-\nPresent,'' 2 Bedroom data.\nNote: Geographies are HUD-designated Fair Market Rent (FMR) areas, per Congressional\nlegislation and regulatory decisions by HUD.\n44%. Each of the five MTO markets saw an 8% jump in that hardship rate\nNeighborhood traits by MTO metro area\nHere, we consider differences in the distribution of neighborhood types \u00ad an\nimportant arbiter of locational opportunity \u00ad between the metro areas. Though some\ntrends, such as sharp increases in real rents and the suburbanization of poverty,\naffected all five MTO metros, several notable differences remained among them in\nthe typical neighborhoods experienced by participants in the demonstration by the\ninterim mark and by all other households in the metro area, as Table 3 shows. For\nexample, the share of experimental-group compliers living in neighborhoods with\npoverty rates below 20% ranged from a high of 71% in metro Boston to just 45% in\nmetro Los Angeles; even members of the control group in Boston were three times\nmore likely to be living in such neighborhoods than were their counterparts in Los\nAngeles and four times more likely than counterparts in New York. While these\noutcome differences may owe in part to site differences in program effects \u00ad for\nexample, effects of differential approaches to counseling or assistance early on \u00ad\nthese locational outcome differences in 2002 track the sharp differences in mean\nexposure to poverty for all households in those metro areas. That is, there are fewer\nhousing opportunities in low-poverty areas overall in metro Los Angeles and New\nYork than in the other three MTO metros.\nA parallel pattern emerges for racial mixing: Boston is the standout in terms of\nMTO locational outcomes at the interim point (with more families in comparatively\nmixed neighborhoods), and the striking gap between the two metros with the lowest\nrates (LA, NY) tracks the big gap in racial exposure for all households when those\ntwo markets are compared to the other three. In metro Boston, 93% of all\nhouseholds live in neighborhoods with moderate or lower minority concentration,\nwhile fewer than half of all households do so in metro New York and Los Angeles.\nTable 3.

For the experimental group,\n``all'' includes both compliers and noncompliers, as explained in text.\nSummary\nInitially and for four to seven years after, the locational quality secured by MTO's\nexperimental-group compliers was far better in multiple dimensions than that in origin\nneighborhoods but \u00ad for reasons that are still uncertain \u00ad less and less distinct from\nthat of the unassisted, voucher-holding complier group in the demonstration and also\nless distinct from the universe of all voucher locations in these metro areas. In\nadditional analyses we have not presented here, the trends reshaping that larger set of\nlocations \u00ad a decline in rental housing affordability, shifting patterns of racial and\neconomic segregation, a spike in subprime lending targeting poor and minority\nneighborhoods, sharp declines in city crime rates, the shift to majority\u00adminority make-\nup in the central city in some cases (Boston) and the metro in others (LA, NY), and\nmore \u00ad indicate how dramatically the geography of housing opportunity was changing\naround the MTO families over time. But again, that geography \u00ad particularly with\nrespect to the number of racially mixed, low-poverty neighborhood options \u00ad\nremained very different across the three MTO metro areas on which our study focused.\nOver time: what household trajectories led to the locational outcomes observed?\nThis section addresses our first main research question: what were the neighborhood\ntrajectories over time? We cannot interpret the outcomes of MTO in a meaningful\nway without understanding the trajectories that led to those outcomes.\nAgainst a changing distribution of locational quality, MTO families have been\nmobile \u00ad but not necessarily more so than low-income renters as a whole. On\naverage, experimental and Section 8 families moved the same number of times (2.6\nmoves), while control-group families moved somewhat less often on average (2.1\nHow did the experimental compliers fare and why? Figure 4 shows locational\ntrajectories for the select group of experimental compliers who leased up in areas\nthat were very low-poverty in 2000 (10% or less poor). Most initial relocation\nhappened in the latter half of the decade, though the program employed the\navailable 1990 tract poverty data. We employed Census 2000 rates for tract poverty\nand thus: (a) isolate transitions across neighborhood poverty levels that reflect\nresidential mobility from any that owe to substantial change in neighborhood\npoverty levels; and (b) focus on those compliers who were positioned, through their\ninitial relocation, to receive the treatment planners intended (prolonged exposure to\na neighborhood that retained a very low-poverty rate). This is revealing for\ndescriptive purposes but clearly does not allow us to attribute treatment effects, given\nthe selectivity. We further limit this reporting to cases for which valid address data\nwere available at multiple observation points: at initial relocation, in the year 2000,\nand again at the interim evaluation point in 2002.17 To describe representative\npatterns for this group, we limit neighborhood types to three levels of poverty: very\nconsolidation does obscure exposure to the extremely poor areas (over 40% poor)\n17Households not included in this analysis were somewhat more likely to be Hispanic, in the\nlabor force, with a high school/GED, and living in a lower poverty neighborhoods at the time\nof the interim survey, though differences were generally modest (p 5 .05, data available).\nthat most experimental compliers left behind at first relocation but captures most of\nthe variation in trajectories over time.18\nFour trajectories are evident in Figure 4. Type 1 households are those that\nmanaged to stay in very low-poverty tracts at all three observation points, whether\nthey moved or did not move, while type 2 households remained in tracts that were\nlow poverty (or better). Types 1 and 2 are distinct, then, only as a matter of degree.\nType 3 households ``bounced'' from the initial, very low-poverty neighborhood to a\nmoderate-to-high-poverty neighborhood by the second observation and then back to\na very low-poverty tract by 2002. Type 4 households, who reverted quickly, were\nalready in a moderate-to-high-poverty tract by 2000 and remained in one (though\nnot necessarily the same one) when observed again in 2002. The bifurcated pattern is\nstriking: Most households either stayed in a very low to low-poverty tract (40% of\nthese particularly successful compliers, combining types 1 and 2) or moved on within\na few years to a moderate-to-high-poverty tract and then remained in that type of\ntract (56%). Only a small fraction (4%) followed the type 3 trajectory, re-attaining a\nvery low-poverty location after some time in a much poorer one.\nA second pattern \u00ad the enormous variation by site \u00ad is not shown in this\naggregate plot. For example trajectory type 1 ranged from 13% for the greater LA\nsite and 16% in New York to 43% in Boston. If types 1 and 2 are combined, those\nFigure 4. Locational trajectories for MTO experimental complier households that initially\nrelocated to neighborhoods that were very low poverty in 2000 (N \u00bc 193).\nSource: Geocoded MTO Interim Impacts Evaluation Survey and Tracking.\n18As a final caveat, because the Los Angeles site completed MTO lease up several years after\nBoston and New York, the intervals between observation points are shorter for Los Angeles.\nFuture research on a longer observation window will mitigate this and other site differences,\nbut all households in our study were observed at least 4 years post random assignment.\ntwo trajectories represent a slight majority (56%) in Boston, compared to just 34%\nfor New York and 24% for LA. Conversely, type 4 is a large majority in New York\n(66%) and even more so LA (74%), compared to just over one-third (36%) for\nBoston. Type 3 is a very small share at each site, from 0% for New York to 8% for\nBoston. A third and final pattern, also not shown, reflects those who leased up in\nareas in the 1990s \u00ad and who remained in those areas, stably, over the observation\npoints. This includes 100 cases total, or one-third of all who leased up successfully in\nthe target census tracts at the three sites.\nThe first pattern adds to Clampet-Lundquist and Massey's (2006) evidence that\ninitially relocating to a racially integrated tract, rather than simply to a very low-\npoverty one, was highly predictive of living in both racially integrated and very low-\npoverty tracts at the interim mark some four to seven years later. Again, removing\nneighborhood change from the patterns and treating the shares summarized above as\nodds, relocating initially to a tract with a stable, very low-poverty rate gave MTO\nhouseholds at our three study sites a roughly 50\u00ad50 chance, on average, of being in a\nvery low to low-poverty tract at the interim point \u00ad but much lower odds in New\nYork and LA.\nAs for the second pattern, we cannot rule out the possibility that program effects,\nincluding initial counseling and assistance differences across sites, help explain site\ndifferences in the distribution of trajectories. But per the discussion above, the\nsignificant differences by site in the pool of neighborhoods available \u00ad in the\navailability of very low and low-poverty tracts, as well as racially integrated tracts \u00ad\nappears to be a significant contributor as well. The third pattern includes some of the\nmost stably housed families, including those who did not move at all, whose\nlocational outcomes by 2000 reflected the growth in poverty around them.\nNow we turn briefly to the comparison group of voucher holders in the\ndemonstration who did not face initial locational restrictions or receive special\ncounseling or search assistance (Figure 5). For this group, typing is more complicated,\nsince starting-point neighborhood poverty levels were much more variable. But one\nFigure 5. Locational trajectories for all Section 8 comparison group complier households\nmay describe all cases with the three starting points indicated with the frequencies on\nthe left side of the starting points in the graph (e.g. 62% relocated initially to a\nneighborhood that was more than 20% poor according to the 2000 census). And almost\n90% of the cases can be described with the four trajectory types indicated, based on\nstarting point: type 5 households (5% of the total) initially relocated to areas that were\nvery low poverty as of the 2000 census and remained in very low or low-poverty areas\n(for simplicity, the graph shows the end outcome as ``low''); type 6 households (11%)\nstarted in those places but reverted to moderate or higher-poverty areas; type 7 (17%)\nstarted in low-poverty areas and remained in them throughout the four to seven-year\nobservation window; and the largest group, type 8 (56%) started in moderate or higher-\npoverty neighborhoods and remained in such areas throughout the window. The\nremaining 10% of cases reflect more mixed patterns, with small cell frequencies. The\npath frequencies that appear in the middle of the graph, then, can be read as a measure\nof how predictive the starting points are for the households' locational trajectories and\noutcomes over time. In simple terms, just under a quarter (22%) of the Section 8\ncomparison group households had trajectories similar to types 1 and 2 for the\nexperimental group compliers. But the vast majority either stayed in moderately poor\nto extremely poor neighborhoods over time or moved back to such areas after initially\nmoving to less poor areas when they enrolled in MTO and exited public housing.\nThe MTO interim evaluation reported on the rarity of Section 8 comparison\ngroup compliers leasing up in the very low-poverty areas targeted for the\nexperimental group, but this trajectory analysis adds a striking view of stability\nand instability over time. The only type that is not stable is the small share of cases\nthat relocated initially to very low-poverty areas. By comparison, not a single case\nthat began in a low-poverty area reverted to a higher-poverty one, that is, like the\norigin tracts, over time (though some moved to very low-poverty areas). Yet such\nreversion was the dominant pattern for those who relocated to the least poor areas\nand specifically to areas that were very low-poverty at the end of the decade. Two-\nthirds of the 47 Section 8 compliers who made that initial relocation had reverted.\nAnd the other types reflect stable residence in the kinds of neighborhoods that most\nvoucher users in these metros live in: moderately to extremely poor areas, with\nBoston showing consistently lower mean poverty rates than LA or New York.\nDrawing on our most in-depth source of data on MTO families, the ethnographic\nfieldwork, Table 4 outlines the social context for observed trajectory types 1 through\n4. These distinctions are based on the ethnographic sample of 28 experimental\ncompliers, which included an oversample of those who were living in suburban areas,\nand so we seek here to shed light on the underlying social mechanisms, not to\nindicate their prevalence in the program population.\nNot only were the types 1 and 2 families in our ethnographic sample luckier\n(on average) in the marketplace, but they tended to express particularly strong\npreferences for ``better'' areas (defined as safer and more economically diverse than\nthe inner city) and more limited kin attachments and obligations in inner-city areas. It\nis not surprising, in that context, that their social lives had moved with them \u00ad even, in\nsome cases, over multiple moves across a wide geography. In simple terms, these\nfamilies were both satisfied and well adapted. For example, Roxanne, who lost her\napartment in one LA suburb when her landlord opted to sell the property, found out\nabout another ``good'' neighborhood through a friend. While the new neighborhood\nwas roughly 15 miles away, Roxanne and her family once again centered their lives on\nthe new place. Ditto Sabrina in suburban Boston, who complained about ghetto\nneighbors moving in from the inner city but focused her children on the safety,\nTable 4.

See types plotted in Figure 4.\nrecreational programs, and shopping in her suburban neighborhood, not the inner-\ncity neighborhoods where most of her relatives continued to live.\nIn contrast, type 4 families (``move-backs'') were generally drawn back to living\nin the inner city through an involuntary move but sometimes through social\nobligation and preference. Sick or otherwise needy kin loomed large for the most\nconstrained families, whose social lives revolved around relatives and close friends\nback in the inner city even when the (subject) family resided in a low-poverty area\nelsewhere in the metro. Though our sample sizes are small, parents in this group also\nappear less likely than those in type 1 or 2 to have access to cars. This was especially\nserious for the LA move-back cases who relied on welfare or had unstable jobs. But\nit applied to a transit-reliant family living in a poor section of Staten Island, too,\nwhose kin support networks were concentrated in the South Bronx.\nSome type 4 cases endured not one but a series of bad breaks in the rental\nmarket. In New York, Lanelle loved living in a low-poverty area in the Northeast\nBronx and chose her neighborhood based on a teacher's recommendation of a strong\nelementary school there. But when the heat did not work for two weeks in the winter,\nLanelle got sick, the housing authority refused to pay the landlord, and Lanelle and\nher children were evicted. After a brief spell living with her grown son, they found a\nnew place with a great landlord in a moderately poor area. But Lanelle's health\nproblems made the fourth floor walk-up apartment untenable. Through her\nstepfather, Lanelle learned about a good building near Yankee Stadium in the\nSouth Bronx. During our fieldwork, several relatives moved into the building.\nThough the area is poorer and noisier than the Northeast Bronx, and though no one\nin the family will walk alone there at night, services, shopping, schools, friends and\nfamily, and the subway are all nearby. Marlena, Lanelle's youngest daughter, can\nwalk herself to school and play outside.\nType 3, the rarest trajectory type in the MTO interim survey sample, showed\nvariable patterns along these same dimensions. The few cases in our sample that fit\nthis type struggled to align life goals \u00ad which included a better neighborhood for\nthe children \u00ad with insecure or inadequate housing and employment opportunities\nas well as hard-to-reach social support, such as vital childcare provided by a parent\nor sibling living at a distance. Anique is the single mother of Clara, age 11. She has\nmoved five times since the initial relocation. She initially relocated from the\nhousing projects in South Los Angeles to an apartment in the nearby southern\nsuburb of Gardena. But Anique soon moved back to South LA because she\nwanted more space and because she worried about Clara living too close to a\nswimming pool. The new home was larger, but the neighborhood turned out to be\ntoo dangerous in the evening. So Anique and Clara soon moved again to a home\nin Compton, also an inner suburb to the south. Anique's failed attempt to buy this\nhouse caused her to lose her housing voucher. But she landed in a job in Riverside\nCounty, more than 70 miles to the east, where an aunt and uncle lived and were\nwilling to provide childcare. Anique and her daughter moved there. But before\nlong, their relatives left California, and lacking alternative sources of safe,\naffordable childcare, Anique moved with her daughter to Long Beach to live with\nAnique's mother and sister. Then Anique was laid off from her job, needed\nfinancial help, and so stayed with her mother. Then she got a new job in Riverside\nCounty, so her commute was nearly 80 miles each way, and she left the house at 4\nAM each day. By the time of our final fieldwork visits, Anique had scraped\ntogether enough money to rent a small one-bedroom apartment across the street\nfrom her job. Anique is a revelatory case (Yin 1994): an extremely persistent single\nmother in the experimental complier group whose job, housing, and support\nlocations remained unstable for a long period of time, challenging her to bring\nthem into alignment.\nIn the final section of results, we look more closely at the demand- and supply-\nside factors that shaped locational outcomes, including the nature of preferences and\ntrade-offs, for all three MTO treatment groups.\nDemand-side factors and choices\nHaving examined neighborhood change and its metropolitan context above \u00ad that is,\nfactors outside the control of MTO families \u00ad we focus here on the two types of\nchoices that families did make to influence their locational outcome: whether to move\nand where to move. The choices made and those available address both of our main\nresearch questions, as we will show. In some instances, we present data on several\ntreatment groups (to allow comparison), while in others, as noted below, we are\nfocused descriptively on the experience of the compliers. The latter is revealing of key\nsocial processes and decisionmaking factors in spite of the fact that it cannot indicate\ntreatment effects per se.\nReasons for moving on after initial relocation\nChoices about where to move would not be so important if the overall rate of\nmobility were lower in the demonstration. Corroborating and extending the interim\nsurvey results, we find, drawing on the large and representative sample of qualitative\ninterviews, that this moving was for a variety of voluntary and involuntary reasons,\nthe most important of which may be categorized as: dissatisfaction with their housing\nquality, landlords, or neighborhoods; leasing problems (such as a unit being sold,\nrented above the voucher program price ceiling, or removed from the voucher\nprogram); or life changes such as birth, death, job getting and job loss, divorce, or\ndomestic dispute. Based on our large sample of qualitative interviews, these drove\nsecond and additional moves and continued to be the major reasons for moving\nyears after the interim evaluation.19 But we find that only rarely did being closer to\nloved ones act as a reason for moving for experimental compliers; more importantly,\nit factored into the assessment of neighborhood options and helped shape important\ndaily routines \u00ad around the accessibility of childcare provided by a relative, for\nexample, or where socializing took place.\nSection 8 comparison group movers were particularly likely to cite dissatisfaction\nwith their neighborhood \u00ad a lack of safety and sometimes noise or more generally ``the\nwrong environment for my children'' \u00ad as a main reason for moving. This is\nconsistent with the comparison group's greater exposure to high-poverty areas\nand with their lower neighborhood satisfaction scores over the course of the\ndemonstration.\nMore than one-third of the reasons cited by experimental complier families,\non the other hand, reflected dissatisfaction with their landlord or housing unit.\nSubstandard physical conditions were a major culprit. Either the family chose to\nmove because they were not satisfied with landlord maintenance and repair, or\nthe unit failed to meet inspection standards set by the housing voucher program.\nSome families reported health problems related to toxic home environments, such\nas carbon monoxide poisoning and mold, and we observed serious problems\nfirsthand in some units: kitchens overrun with cockroaches as we sat to conduct\ninterviews, heat that barely functioned in the cold winter, and more. But there\nwas dissatisfaction with landlords as well: some families found the lack of privacy\ntoo restrictive (e.g. where the landlord lived in the same building), especially when\nit prevented family and friends from visiting; and some parents could not handle\nlandlords' expectations about keeping their children quiet. We are not arguing\nright and wrong here, particularly since we do not have data from the landlords,\n19Families reported reasons for moving for each of their address spells, from original lease-up\nmerely noting the factors that MTO heads of household cited as important to\nthem.\nThere were a few notable site differences, regardless of treatment group. For\nexample, New York families talked about landlord or unit-based ``push'' factors\ntwice as often as Boston or Los Angeles families. This was especially the case for\nmembers of the NY experimental group, many of whom leased up initially with\nsmall, live-in landlords in multi-family homes. Conversely, about one-third of LA\nMTO families who moved on complained more (in both treatment groups) about\ntheir neighborhoods being undesirable.\nMTO control-group families who had moved from public housing projects\neither highlighted ``pull'' factors (such as receiving a voucher outside the MTO\ndemonstration), the decision to leave subsidized housing altogether, the desire to get\nbetter units and/or neighborhoods, or push factors beyond their control: most\nimportantly, being vouchered out through HOPE VI or other redevelopment\nprograms that required resettlement.\nUnderstanding locational preferences: avoidance behaviors, hopes, and priority setting\nBeyond main reasons for moving, our qualitative interviews and ethnographic\nfieldwork help shed light on why MTO households made the specific housing unit\nand neighborhood choices they did, showing how needs changed (for example, as\nthe household grew) and also how a willingness to make tradeoffs among desired\noutcomes \u00ad for example, the willingness to stay or not stay in a lower quality housing\nunit in order to stay in a safer neighborhood \u00ad varied significantly among families.\nPrior research on MTO has emphasized neighborhood safety \u00ad in particular, the\nchance to get away from the drug dealing and violence in high-risk neighborhoods \u00ad\nas the primary motivator for participating families' initial relocation (Orr et al.\n2003). Years afterward, parents in all three treatment groups continued to emphasize\nthis avoidance factor (as distinct from the attractions of a resource-rich neighbor-\nhood), sharing stories of the neighborhoods left behind. But distancing children from\nwhat subjects perceived as undesirable ``ghetto'' behavior was a factor as well,\nparents recalled. We stress that these are perceptions, years after the fact, of behavior\nin a challenging social and economic context. Distinct class behaviors invariably lead\nto perceived social boundaries and often to sharp judgments as well, as ethnographic\nstudies of ``street'' versus ``decent'' cultures at play in urban neighborhoods have\nPattillo 2007). What is important for our purposes is that the perceptions remained\ndistinct and strongly negative, constituting a second avoidance factor in neighbor-\nhood choice over time.\nSome complier parents in our ethnographic sample recalled loud and frequent\npartying, hanging out on the streetcorner, gang banging, being confrontational and\nquick to fight, young girls acting ``fast'' (promiscuous), and dressing or carrying\noneself inappropriately (``ghetto style''). For example, April, a mother in the Boston\nexperimental-complier group who is originally from Haiti, has lived in the same\nneighborhood since her first relocation. It is an economically diverse area in which,\nsays April, people ``are nice, go to work, dress nice.'' She contrasted her ``suburb''\nneighborhood (her label) with the ``ghetto place'' the family moved away from, and\nshe emphasized how much more important these locational qualities were to her\nthan housing unit features:\nYou know, over there [in the old neighborhood], people are ``Blah! Blah!'' Loud! The\nmusic is high, there's ghetto people. You even hear 8-year old kids F-talking! . . . You\nknow those kids are trouble . . . I don't care if people give me $5,000 and I get a big\napartment, with three bedrooms or more in [my old neighborhood]. I never want to live\nin the ghetto. (Fieldnote)\nThese judgments carried over to compliers who noticed in-migration of poorer\nfamilies in their low-poverty areas \u00ad the ``ghetto followed me'' dynamic we\nmentioned earlier. Sabrina, an experimental complier in Boston, explained her intent\nto move again, though she and her children were well integrated into the routines\nand institutions of their neighborhood:\nSabrina said, ``I'm looking for another apartment, better suited for my needs, something\nmore, on a better street. Not so close to the people around here.'' Fieldworker: I asked\nwho she didn't want to be around and she replied, ``The ghetto people in the building\ndown the street. The whole building is low-income and everyone is coming from\nDorchester [in inner-city Boston]. They bring with them their Dorchester behavior, and\nI don't like that.'' (Fieldnote)\nBut making these negative judgments about some neighbors did not stop less\nwary MTO parents from relying on those neighbors for support. For example,\nRoxanne, an experimental complier in Los Angeles, thinks her neighbors are mostly\n``ghetto'' because they like loud music and ``let people hang out.'' But she also thinks\nshe could turn to any of them for help in an emergency, in part, she reasons, because\nthey are parents in their thirties and forties, and they care about children. Other\nexperimental complier parents expressed the same sentiment, distinguishing their\nimmediate neighbors' watchfulness and helpfulness from the issue of the neighbor-\nhood's character, which they hoped would not turn all poor and all minority.\nAvoidance aside, and regardless of treatment group, there were common\nattractions to particular kinds of neighborhoods and neighbors: living near people\nwho are working and/or ``middle-class,'' as well as ``respectful'' or ``peaceful,'' and \u00ad\nwhile the emphasis on privacy versus social engagement varied \u00ad wanting to live\nin places where ``everybody minds their own business,'' which is ``a nice family\nenvironment.'' Some MTO parents specifically emphasized homeownership,\nneighbors' investment in place, and maturity. As one parent in New York told us,\n``There's nice places in the Bronx. It's the people. Got to find people who care about\nthe community. I should do my research and find a place with less kids, older\npeople'' (Interview).\nSocial supports\nSome researchers have suggested that voucher holders' locational outcomes reflect\nunmeasured preferences for access to family and friends, as well as familiar local\ninstitutions, and not just market or program-based barriers to wider housing choice\n(e.g. Varady and Walker 2000). But our qualitative data point to a range of types:\nparents who prioritize proximity to loved ones or cherished institutions, such as a\nchurch; those who factor in such proximity but do not make it a priority when\ndeciding where to live; and those who use vouchers to distance themselves from\nneedy or risk-bearing relatives and friends. Cross cutting this variation in priorities\nwas the geography of families' ties: Members of the control group often reported\nextended family networks in and around their public housing developments, whereas\ncompliers in both treatment groups tended to report strong ties residing at greater\ndistance (outside their neighborhoods). This is consistent with Shroder's (2003)\nfinding that experimental-group members with fewer social ties to the old\nneighborhood were more likely to successfully lease up in low-poverty areas.\nDecades of research on social networks confirm that extensive kin reliance is\nparticularly common among the chronically poor, also that their supportive ties tend\nto be more localized, limited in number, and strained than those of higher income\norganizing their social worlds around relatives and a few close friends rather than\nnew social contacts garnered in workplaces or \u00ad even more rarely \u00ad in new\nneighborhoods. But some chose new residential locations that kept relatives\nparticularly close at hand. For example, Larissa, a Section 8 complier in New\nYork, originally had trouble finding an adequate apartment with her voucher. She\nwas relieved to find one near her mother:\nIt is down the block from my mother, because I try to stay next to my mother, because I\nhave two brothers, but they don't help her. I do, so I try to stay. And it was convenient.\nShe helps me. We all help each other. So it was good. I took it. I was like, okay, it is two\nbedrooms and better than what I had before. (Interview)\nThat priority led a small share of experimental compliers (510% of our\ninterview sample) to move back to inner-city neighborhoods, though not necessarily\nthe ones left behind at first relocation, in order to be close to loved ones and\nsometimes the church. Almost all of these cases were in Los Angeles, where\ncompliers moved much farther on average and where public transportation is\nfamously inadequate. In the shorthand of social network analysis, the attractions of\na move back were both instrumental (social support) and expressive (socializing).\nOverwhelmingly, for example, compliers in our ethnographic sample reported that\nsocializing with loved ones meant driving or taking transit back into the inner city;\ntheir close ties rarely with them in their new neighborhoods. Patricia, an\nexperimental complier in Los Angeles who had no car access and felt particularly\nisolated, explains why she moved from a low-poverty area in the San Fernando\nValley back to South LA (though she later called the former safer and ``nicer''):\nThe reason why I moved by here, because, uh, I wanted to come closer to my family\ndown here because I was the only one in the Valley and everybody stayed over here, or\nover there, and nobody would come visit me or my kids because they was like you stay\ntoo far, you stay too far, you know. And I was like, you know, but still, can't you all\ncome get us . . . We used to be down here like every weekend catching the Metro all the\nway from the Valley all the way here. I found a church home down here in L.A., and I\nliked it and I wanted to be closer to my church home, so I moved down here with my\nmother, and my sister, and my family and stuff. I liked it out there [in the Valley], but I\nwanted to move closer to my loved ones . . . My kids, they was like, ``Mama, don't\nnobody come visit us.'' (Interview)\nOther families adapted better, whether because they had more resources under\ntheir own roofs initially, economic opportunities worked out, or for other reasons.\nFinally, some MTO families used voucher-based relocation to distance\nthemselves from the neediness or perceived negative influence of particular relatives,\nincluding those with a criminal past, no housing, no steady work, an addiction\nproblem, or all of these. Wary social relations, including self isolation from the\nstrains of kinship and other strong ties, has been a theme of qualitative work on\nghetto poverty, including public housing environments, at least since classic studies\nsuch as Rainwater's Behind Ghetto Walls (1970) and Stack's All Our Kin (1974). But\nthe debates over public housing transformation in recent years have generally de-\nemphasized this feature of social life among the chronically poor, highlighting the\nopposite pattern of cohesiveness and kin reliance (e.g. Greenbaum 2006, Venkatesh\nThe distancing strategy appeared in all three treatment groups, including control-\ngroup cases such as Jeanine, who left public housing in Los Angeles after an\nescalation of gun violence. When we visited her, she and her children were still in a\nrisky neighborhood, with prostitution taking place right outside their front door. But\nJeanine said she felt much safer there and added,\nI don't want my family to know where I stay. I have three aunties and two other uncles\nwho don't know I'm here. ``Fieldworker: What would happen if they knew?'' They would\ncome visit, and they would become a problem, wanting to borrow, coming to stay. I got\na cousin who has been in jail over 13 years, looking for a place to stay. I was like, `Oh no\nyou're not. You been in jail. I woudn't be comfortable in the same house with you.' My\nkids say, `Why you keep me away from my family?' I'm like, `Protecting you from the\nbullshit!' (Fieldnote)\nInstitutional resources and amenities\nNotably, very few MTO mover families identified neighborhood institutional\nresources or amenities as main reasons to live in particular neighborhoods, and\nalmost no families in the complier group who stayed in low or very low-poverty\nareas were engaged in the associational life of those neighborhoods, whereby they\nmight have formed useful ties with neighbors. Some movers \u00ad notably the families in\nour ethnographic sample who had remained in low-poverty areas for more than five\nyears \u00ad did most of their shopping and some of their socializing in those ``new''\nneighborhoods, while other mover families preferred to attend church and to shop in\nanother neighborhood. Many did comment on the greater convenience and\naffordability of shopping in their old neighborhoods, where more retailers targeted\nlow-income consumers.\nTrade-offs\nComplier families faced more complex choices after the initial relocation,\nincluding unwelcome trade-offs between the things they valued: a decent housing\nunit and a decent neighborhood. Above, April makes clear that she would not\ntrade ``the right place'' (as she defines it) for a much better housing unit \u00ad or for\nall the proverbial gold in Fort Knox. But most parents in our ethnographic\nsample of experimental compliers maintained close ties with kin or a small circle\nof close friends in high-poverty neighborhoods left behind and/or emphasized unit\nfeatures more than April did. These parents weighed the location-unit trade-off\nvery differently, especially if they were not as lucky as April had been to find a\ndecent unit. In moving on, some had more bad luck in the housing market,\nlanding in a poorly maintained unit and needing to move on quickly again or\nending up on a street that was more dangerous than it seemed during the search.\nSome faced changing housing needs, too, as the make-up of their households\nchanged, with sick or homeless relatives moving in or a newborn requiring an\nadditional bedroom \u00ad trading away a decent neighborhood to get a bigger or\nbetter place was not about preferences in the abstract but problem-solving under\ntight constraints.\nShifting preferences and life-stage factors\nWithout consistent baseline measures and a larger sample of in-depth\nethnographic cases to allow multivariate analysis, we cannot confidently assert\nthat living in particular kinds of neighborhoods changed preferences in significant\nways. But living outside the inner city clearly provided new information on the\ntrade-offs that places present: the projects presented a variety of risks, for\nexample, but also some conveniences and a kind of social acceptance that some\nparents and children valued more consciously after relocating to a very different\nenvironment.\nIn addition, our fieldwork highlights how the gaps between adult and child\npreferences (especially if the children are adolescents) sharpen under relocation to\nmuch lower-poverty areas. Neighborhoods that are ``peaceful'' to parents are often\n``boring'' for teenagers, especially males, offering the latter little to do (according to\nthem) and, in some cases, posing strains of acculturating to a different class culture,\nwith its largely unwritten rules of appropriate speech, dress, and conduct.\nAdolescents with strong kin ties to inner-city neighborhoods were more likely to\nvisit those neighborhoods often, maintain peer relationships there (often with\ncousins), and seek out some of the very risks their parents feared. MTO parents were\noften sensitive to these desires while trying to buffer their children from the most\nserious risks.\nSearch process and supply-side factors\nBeyond preferences and trade-offs, the qualitative data indicate how opportunities\nand constraints \u00ad most reflecting the structure of the voucher program and its\nweaknesses in expensive housing markets, some reflecting the challenges of low-\nincome single parenting \u00ad contributed to housing choices over time by shaping\nfamilies' information sets, housing search behavior, and more. We avoid any\nestimates of prevalence here and employ a case-study approach, because we were\nable to collect valid data on multiple housing searches only for a subset of families\nFirst, while complier families relied on a mix of search strategies for the initial\nrelocation \u00ad about one-third relied on program counselors, and the rest were evenly\ndivided among public housing agency lists, private real estate agents who broker\nrentals, and newspapers \u00ad the majority who moved on again relied heavily on their\nown devices, including rental agents they paid directly, classified ads, and word of\nmouth (referral networks) to find adequate housing units and landlords willing to\naccept the housing voucher. One reason, as affordable housing became scarcer, is\nthat housing agency lists were routinely out of date and useless, said interviewees.\nThe qualifier for this is that the MTO program counseling clearly got some families\nto consider areas they had never heard of and were not (until then) exploring \u00ad areas\nwhere we found them more than five years later. For those families fortunate enough\nto find housing units and locations that worked and to avoid (or manage) the chance\nevents that trigger many involuntary moves for low-income households, counseling\neffects on locational outcomes endured for years. This underscores the pivotal role of\nhousing stability.\nSecond, when additional moves proved necessary or desirable for whatever\nreason, landlord refusal to accept housing vouchers, especially in ``better''\nneighborhoods, and the prevalence of units that did not meet program quality\nstandards constrained the search significantly. For these reasons and because of the\ntime and other constraints on wider search, voucher users did focus on what parents\nperceived to be their best prospects, which generally meant units in poorer and more\ndangerous neighborhoods \u00ad a pattern hypothesized in the MTO interim evaluation\nreport (Orr et al. 2003,31). MTO parents expressed surprise and relief when areas\nthey perceived to be much better offered them a housing opportunity.\nConsider Tameka, an experimental complier in Los Angeles who initially\nrelocated to a low-poverty neighborhood in the suburbs that she liked very much.\nWhen the landlord stopped accepting housing vouchers, she was forced to find a new\napartment, and this drove her back to the central city, though she looked hard in the\nsuburbs too. With a great deal of effort, she found a house in LA to rent that she\nliked, but she had to help the landlord prepare the unit to pass the required\ninspection. She recalls:\nWell . . . it's really a tricky thing when you're moving, because . . . especially when\nyou're a working, single parent . . . I know I, I have a certain amount of time to be out\nthis apartment, to be relocated. So I went to this place where people find a place for you.\nYou pay them this fee, and they look for like apartments and houses for you, for people\nthat work and stuff. And you pay `em a fee, like $150 or something . . . And all the, they\ngive you like a listing every week. And every time they give you a listing of maybe, I'd\nsay roughly 100 places, maybe 80 of the places is already rented, been rented out\nalready. . . . But it took me about 45 days and, um, at work, even on my break, I was in\nnewspapers and doing anything I had to do to find a place. Actually, I found this\nhouse . . . in La Opinion [an Hispanic newspaper], and I had my coworker to like read it\nfor me. . . . And they had a open house and I came, and I was like, oh, I know a lotta\npeople gonna be for this. Don't think like that, don't think negative. And when I came\nfor open house, I was the only person here. I looked at a lotta places in [an inner suburb\nto the south of Los Angeles] . . . a lot of places that were vacant and available, they did\nnot accept Section 8. So you run into that . . . . and if you're not determined and a focus\nperson, you will really give up. (Interview)\nThese were not static markets, as we showed with vacancy and FMR data earlier.\nMartina, a Latino Section 8 complier in Los Angeles, explains,\nIt's been very difficult] to find an apartment with Section 8. . . . [It took] (a)bout three\nyears to find the one in Larga. You do find them, but not in good areas. I have children\nand I do it for them, not for myself. There are less expensive areas, but you don't wake\nup alive, or they rob or kill you. You can find them, but very far away from here. This\narea is expensive. In Larga, we paid $800, and the man is currently renting it for $1,500.\nThat is why he asked us to move out, so he could raise the rent. [I lived there] five years.\nHe wanted to raise the rent. Section 8 does not allow that. If $800 was being paid, he\nwas not going to be allowed. That is why he told us to leave. It was hard to find an\napartment. [Mine is] very expensive . . . I'm going to see what I can do to pay for my\nrent because Section 8 will give me $500. I will pay the rest. This apartment costs $1,100.\n(Interview)\nAmber, a Section 8 complier in Boston, describes the change in apartment\nhunting in the Boston area and why relying on a broker was important as the market\ntightened and she tried to find a new place in ``nicer'' neighborhoods:\nLooking for a new apartment, just doing the newspaper, don't help. So I end up, um,\ngoing to a real estate, the real estate agent had to help me find a apartment. I found this\napartment, which I had to pay them a fee. And, um, the rent was going up to like $1,600,\n$1,800. So it was very hard calling [by] myself. And when I went to Section 8, I tried to\ndo the same list thing. That wasn't working out. They either wanted me to move way\nfar, further than Mattapan, meaning at least 45 [minutes] to an hour away from my\nfamily. I didn't want to do that. So my best [bet] was to go to a real estate, and that's\nwhat kind of helped me to get this apartment in Hyde Park [a low-poverty\nneighborhood in the outer core of Boston]. I didn't want to go to Mattapan. I didn't\nwant to go to Roxbury [also inner city]. I wanted to stay, live in Hyde Park or West\nRoxbury [another low poverty, outer-core area in the city], which I think both the\nneighborhoods are a little bit nicer. The schools are a little better. (Interview)\nReal estate agents made the search for an adequate, voucher-accepting unit more\nefficient, in part by steering MTO participants toward particular locations. With\ntime, information, and other search resources at a premium, agents probably\nexpanded the locational alternatives for some families who would have otherwise\nsettled on the easiest-to-search locations, those in the weakest rental submarkets \u00ad\nhigh-risk neighborhoods.\nSummary\nWhile the broad contours of changing housing markets are evident in many of these\nfamily experiences \u00ad those who moved most often, in particular \u00ad the range of\nexperiences is striking. For some families, getting a housing voucher is ``like\n[winning] an Oscar'' (as one told us), inspectors and landlords cooperate in textbook\nfashion, and the unit remains affordably priced for years. For others, the dearth of\nminimally acceptable units, the insecure opportunity to live in a safer neighborhood\nwhen one does gain a foothold, and each arduous new search are all reminders of\nwhat it means to rent housing on the bottom of the income ladder in extremely costly\nand tight markets \u00ad and with a government housing subsidy that is often stigmatized\nand rejected in ``better'' neighborhoods.\nDiscussion\nPrior housing research has had little to report about locational outcomes over time\nfor participants in ``assisted mobility'' programs \u00ad even though exposure to\nparticular kinds of neighborhood environments over time is a necessary condition\nfor certain positive ``neighborhood effects'' on children and families. Nor has\nresearch prior to MTO revealed the processes that put families who receive low-\nincome housing assistance on one housing trajectory versus another; even MTO\nresearch to date has been dominated by results for mean treatment effects, which\nimply an ``average'' experience that does not, for practical purposes, exist for all of\nthe outcomes we care about.\nIn lieu of more evidence on these, our two research questions, the debate often\nrevolves around stylized versions of the supply- versus demand-side explanations of\nsegregation in the nation's biggest low-income housing program. In the strong \u00ad that\nis, unqualified \u00ad form of the supply-side narrative, at least for tight housing markets,\npoor families who win the ``lottery'' of housing assistance are desperate to live in\nmore racially and economically integrated areas. But market discrimination and\nscarcity thwart their dream of a better life in a better place. In this telling, even\nvoucher holders who receive information, transportation, or other supports have\nlittle meaningful choice. In the strong demand-side narrative, families only integrate\nwhen they are obliged to do so by government planners. Assisted housing mobility,\nin this telling, reflects the integrator's ideal and not the preferences of families served.\nYes, all parents may want the safest possible places for their children, say the\ndemand-side purists, but the inner-city poor, most of whom are racial minorities,\nalso want the comfort of familiarity and social acceptance, as well as support from\nloved ones \u00ad even if that means enduring more dangerous and resource-poor areas.\nBased on the decade-plus experience of families in the MTO experiment, we find\nthat the supply-siders are right about constraints (though our fieldwork was not set\nup to detect discrimination as a contributor) while the demand-siders largely\nmisconstrue the role of preferences, at least in the tight housing markets where much\neconomic growth and inequality are concentrated in America. Yes, intense market\npressure in greater Boston, Los Angeles, and New York over MTO's first decade, as\nwell as the limits and flaws in the housing voucher program were huge constraints for\nmany families. The less stably housed the family, the more this was true \u00ad because\neach new move forced the family to navigate anew, with little room to maneuver in\nthe choice of best-possible neighborhoods \u00ad and this appears to have contributed to\nmany trajectories that led experimental compliers (the focus of hopes in the\nprogram) to poorer neighborhoods of residence over time. This helps explain why\nlocational outcomes converged over time for the treatment groups even though two-\nthirds of experimental compliers who had to move on or who chose to do so reported\nlooking for a new apartment in the same neighborhood. In lieu of better locations,\naffordable units with landlords willing to rent to voucher holders, families take what\nthey can get, making the most of proximity to loved ones, managing in substandard\nor crowded units for the sake of their children, and otherwise settling.\nThe first major policy and research implication of this study is clear: In tight\nmarkets, relocation-only interventions, even the best assisted, are unlikely to produce\nenduring improvements in locational outcomes without focused attention on the\ngeography of housing supply that will remain affordable and available. This calls for\nexpanding and accelerating the focus on supply-side strategies with an inclusionary\napproach in many markets. In addition, it means searching on behalf of families in\norder to generate wider options, as Gautreaux placement agents did in the program's\nfirst wave, and then working with private landlords to ensure that decent, leased\nunits will remain affordable and in program compliance as long as possible. This\nneed not deny families the opportunity to lease up elsewhere, but it would put the\nonus of the arduous search task in the most competitive markets on the agencies\noffering the housing assistance, which too often fails to live up to national policy\ndeclarations about the importance of a suitable living environment for all families.\nIn the shorthand of optimization, we have, in the Housing Choice Voucher\nprogram, a low-income housing assistance policy engineered to minimize cost to the\ntaxpayer; subject to an inconsistently enforced minimum standard of unit quality.\nThe program lacks a robust rule or incentive to ensure the best-possible locational\nquality or stability in good locations, especially in the tight markets where those\nmechanisms are needed most. Stability is a pre-condition, frequently over-looked in\npolicy debates that rely on point-in-time data on housing locations, for more\nproductive engagement by low-income families in schools and community life,\nespecially in less poor, less racially isolated, and also less familiar places: Without\nstability, no community and fewer positive effects of place.\nThe second policy implication has to do with improving places rather than\nhelping people relocate away from them. Since safety looms so large in the calculus\nof low-income families on housing assistance \u00ad just as it does for most households\nwith children, regardless of income \u00ad policymakers should redouble efforts to making\nthe neighborhoods where very low-income households are concentrated much safer,\nparticularly from the most unpredictable acts of gun violence that so troubled\nfamilies in the MTO experiment, both on the streets and in schools.\nYet the demand-siders are right that choice (individual agency) also matters, not\njust in principle but in the significant choices parents make for themselves and their\nchildren over time. Rarely, however, did this take the form of an unconstrained\npreference for neighborhood A over neighborhood B. We have underscored, based\non families' in-depth accounts of their choices and circumstances as well as our direct\nobservations of those circumstances, the importance of trade-offs. Where they had a\nmeaningful choice to make, some MTO parents were willing to trade away attractive\nunit features (including size and quality) in order to stay in a better neighborhood.\nOthers, particularly if they had had to endure the worst of the dilapidated and poorly\nmaintained housing stock in the voucher program, would not make the same choice.\nThey preferred a better apartment in a risky environment, and they were willing to\nmanage the risks.\nOnly rarely did the location of relatives, friends, or other loved ones trigger a\nmove or determine where families moved. But pre-established ties, most of all the\nnetworks that MTO participants did not choose \u00ad the kin networks into which they\nwere born \u00ad remained the center of most participants' social worlds and so factored\ninto life routines and assessments of neighborhoods. Yes, some families who moved\nout later moved back and valued the access they regained to loved ones; this was\nespecially true, in our small ethnographic sample, for families without reliable access\nto a car. But it is also the case that those ties proved burdensome and draining\nsometimes and that some parents moved in part to distance themselves from\nperennially needy relatives or relatives who posed special risks, such as addicts and\nex-offenders that MTO parents perceived to be bad influences on their children.\nSimilarly, some parents had to deal with dissatisfied, adolescent children who found\nsafer neighborhoods boring.\nSome reforms could ``change the default,'' in the language of choice architecture\n(Thaler and Sunstein 2008): from renting up where it is most familiar as well as\neasiest to use the voucher to considering recommended options first \u00ad and opting for\nan alternative, even in a riskier neighborhood, if one prefers that for any reason. But\nchoice architecture can only help so much when the available choice set is very\nlimited. Like the finding about search and constraint, our finding about the role of\nchoice implies that policymakers should re-assess the issues that define available\nsupply for housing voucher holder, in particular the enforcement of quality standards\nand the pivotal issue of landlord acceptance. It is vital that assisted relocation not be\nthought of as simply a matter of counseling, more generous payment levels, or\nlocational restrictions on vouchers \u00ad the latter would be very unpopular, as well as\nvulnerable to litigation. Wider landlord participation demands responsive housing\nagencies, and while we do not think our data offer definitive evidence on the question\nof regional versus municipal management of the voucher program, the integral role\nof housing quality assurance, appropriate payment standards and FMR geogra-\nphies, and wider landlord participation should not be overlooked in the effort to\nfocus on the demand side, say with better information and other search supports for\nfamilies. Having said that, policymakers should also assess the role that private\nrental agents can and should play in brokering the voucher market. And they should\nrethink the rules and incentives facing voucher management agencies (not just\ntenants) as ``choosers'' (Sard 2008). Voucher reform legislation submitted in 2007\naddresses several of these concerns,20 but as of this writing, the prospects for such\nlegislation remain unclear, and the increasing cost of the voucher program is likely to\nremain a top policy issue for HUD and the Congress, at least in the near term.\nA final implication of this trade-off finding is that car vouchers and other tools\ncould mitigate the trade-off between living in a safer neighborhood and having the\ndesired level of access to one's social supports and cherished institutions, such as\n``church homes.'' In related analyses, we have found that the employment challenges\nfor work-ready MTO participants were not merely a reflection of their limited skill\nlevels but of the difficulties of lining up three-way jobs-housing-social support\nmatches. Difficult commutes and transportation constraints figure into that triangle\nin predictable ways \u00ad and not just for those families who use housing assistance to\nleave unsafe but transit-rich neighborhoods and then lack access to a car.\nLimitations and future directions for research\nThere are key limitations of these data and the analyses we have been able to\nconduct. First, by design MTO served only voluntary movers, and some factors we\nhave analyzed, including the preference to stay close to social supports that are\nconcentrated in inner-city neighborhoods, may be more important for involuntary\nmovers. Second, as we underlined above, our discussion is based on family\nexperiences and outcomes in some of the nation's tightest markets; we are not\nmaking more general claims about all rental markets or all metros, and longitudinal\nevidence on these dynamics in less tight marketplaces would be useful. Third and\nfinally, a number of our insights reflect a small-n, case-study logic, which considers\nmultiple dimensions of each family's life. We have tried to show the variation in\nparticipants' experiences but often without knowing the prevalence of particular\nexperiences. Inferences should therefore be made carefully, but in general, we have\nunderscored how misleading the notion of an ``average'' program experience can be.\nModeling choice\nWhere does this study leave us in terms of a model of housing choice by very low-\nincome families in America? Based on our findings as well as prior research, and\nadapting the classic critique of rational planning by Lindblom (1959), we propose\nthat a model of limited, segmented comparisons captures the observed variation in\noutcomes well. Choices are limited first by the structure of the metropolitan housing\nmarket and the choices that real estate agents, landlords, and others make and\nsecond by the limited time, information, money, and other resources that the poorest\nfamilies possess to make the best choices. The result is limited comparison shopping\nby many very low-income families. And choices are segmented on two dimensions: in\nterms of preferred trade-off, there are families more willing to cope in risky\nneighborhoods than deal with lousy housing units in better neighborhoods, while\nother families have the inverse priority; and in terms of key social relations, there are\nfamilies whose social worlds are organized around kin contact and those who act to\ndistance and buffer themselves from such contact. Individually, each of these\ndistinctions has some relevance across the income spectrum, of course \u00ad almost\nall housing consumers face some important constraints, and we differ in terms of\npreferred contact with relatives \u00ad but as a construct, this model of limited, segmented\ncomparisons helps explain how choice and constraint act together to shape locational\noutcomes for the poorest renters, many of them racial minorities in a still highly\nsegregated nation.\nGiven this, should MTO be the model for the Housing Choice Voucher program,\nthe nation's largest effort to address the housing needs of very low-income people? In\nterms of its guiding principles, we think the answer is ``yes.'' Many residents of\ndistressed, high-crime neighborhoods want the opportunity to escape those areas,\nand we not only know how to help them do so \u00ad how to assist relocation more wisely\nthan we did when MTO was launched \u00ad but we also know how to mitigate the tough\ntrade-offs some families face when relocating. In terms of design and implementation,\nhowever, MTO was not enough \u00ad in that it relied on poverty rate alone to target\n``opportunity'' areas, failed to properly screen hard-to-house families with severe\nhealth and other problems, and failed to enable most participants to stay away from,\nnot just get out of, the high-risk areas they wanted to avoid. In sum, the experiment\nwas founded on a strong and politically legitimate idea \u00ad the meaningful choice of a\nbetter living environment for one's family \u00ad that could be much more effectively\nimplemented.\n"
