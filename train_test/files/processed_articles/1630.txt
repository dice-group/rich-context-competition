As measured by BMI, recent estimates\nindicate that almost 1 in 5 children are considered obese (1).\nBoth genetic (3,4) and environmental (5\u00ad7) factors contribute to\nthe energy imbalance that leads to obesity. Another public health\nconcern in the US is food insecurity. A household is considered\nfood insecure if it does not have the financial means to access\nenough food for all household members to sustain active,\nhealthy living (8). Approximately 1 in 5 children in the US lives\nin a food-insecure household as measured via the USDA Core\nFood Security Module (CFSM)6 with substantially higher rates\nfor those below the poverty line (8). Both obesity and food\ninsecurity have been shown to lead to a plethora of medical\nResearch on the relationship between food insecurity and\nchildhood obesity has lead to mixed results. Some studies have\nfound a positive relationship (16\u00ad19), others have found no\nrelationship (10,20\u00ad25), others have found a negative relation-\nship (26\u00ad28), and 1 study found that the relationship depended\non whether self-reported or measured heights and weights were\nused (29). Food insecurity has also been found to influence\nobesity through its interaction with stress (30,31) and with\ndepression, parenting, and infant feeding (32). This work has\nused a variety of data sets and methods. Common to all these\nstudies is the use of a child's BMI to delineate whether he or she\nis obese, overweight, healthy weight, or underweight.\nThe central advantage of using BMI to establish the weight\nstatus of a child is that, compared with other measures of obesity,\nstature and weight are considered the easiest and most reliable\nmeasures to obtain across the wide range of settings in which\nroutine preventive screenings are conducted (33). A key disad-\nvantage is that excessive body fatness is the pathology associated\nwith obesity and it cannot be measured directly using BMI insofar\nas BMI does not distinguish between mass in the form of fat, lean\ntissue, or bone (33,34). Additionally, gender- and age-specific\nBMI-derived guidelines are confounded by the onset of puberty\n(34) and are not appropriate for children with contractures or\ndeformities (33). Therefore, scientists argue that multiple mea-\nsures of childhood obesity should be assessed (34\u00ad36).\nIn addition to BMI not presenting a full picture of obesity,\nresearch has shown that connections between obesity and child\n1 Supported by the USDA, Cooperative State Research, Education, and\n2 Author disclosures: C.

For example, compared with BMI, waist circumference\n(WC) and waist:height ratios were better predictors of cardio-\nvascular disease risk factors (37), WC and hypertiglyceridemic\nwaist phenotype were better predictors of metabolic syndrome\n(38,39), and fat mass was more closely associated with physical\nactivity (40). Moreover, the distribution of obesity within\npopulations (e.g. by race and by sex) differs depending on\nwhich measure of obesity is used (41\u00ad44). Just as relationships\nbetween obesity and health outcomes differ by choice of\nmeasure, the same may be true for the relationship between\nchildhood obesity and food insecurity.\nWithin the obesity literature, there is no consensus on which\nmeasure of obesity is preferable in all instances (45). As a\nconsequence, we used a wide variety of measures [BMI, WC,\ntriceps skinfold (TSF), trunk fat mass, percentage of body fat]\nand their respective obesity cutoffs. We analyzed these relation-\nships for children between the ages of 8 and 17 y with data from\nMethods\nParticipants\na program of studies conducted by the National Center for Health\nStatistics, CDC (46) to assess the health and nutritional status of adults\nand children in the United States. NHANES examines a nationally\nrepresentative sample of ;5000 persons each year, about one-half of\nwhom are children (46). The NHANES samples examined for these\nanalyses were limited to households , 200% of the poverty line, because\nfood insecurity is rare among households above this threshold (8). The\nMeasures\nClassification of weight status. All physical assessments of the child\n(e.g. height, weight, WC) were measured by a trained technician in the\nNHANES mobile examination center. We derived 5 indicators of obesity\nfrom this information. In each instance, if a child was not classified as\nobese, we referred to the child as being nonobese. First, BMI (kg/m2) was\ncalculated from the child's weight and height and mapped into a\npercentile using age- and sex-specific reference values obtained from\nCDC growth charts for the US (47). A child was classified as obese if his\nor her BMI was $ the 95th percentile. Second, WC was measured at just\nabove the uppermost lateral border of the right ilium at the end of a\nnormal expiration. A child was classified as obese if his or her WC was $\nthe 90th percentile reference value for their age and sex in models for the\nfull population or by gender, and their age, sex, and race in models by\nrace (48). Third, TSF thickness was determined at the midpoint between\nthe acromion and olecranon process on the posterior surface of the right\narm with a Lange caliper. A child was classified as centrally obese if his or\nher TSF was $ the 95th percentile reference value for their age and sex in\nmodels for the full population or by gender, or age, sex, and race in\nmodels by race (49,50). Fourth, trunk fat mass was determined using\ndual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The trunk included the thoracic and\nlumbar spine, and left and right ribs and pelvis. A child was classified as\nobese if his or her trunk fat mass was greater than or equal to established\nage-sex reference values for identifying high trunk fat mass (51). Our\nfinal indicator of obesity was percentage of whole-body fat measured via\nwhole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans taken with a\nHologic QDR-4500A fan-beam densitometer. Hologic software version\n8.26:a3* was used to administer all scans. For the scans, children wore\ndisposable paper gowns, removed all objects that would interfere with\nobtaining an analyzable scan image, and were positioned supine on the\ntabletop with their feet in a neutral position and hands flat by their side\n(52). A child was classified as obese if his or her percentage of body fat\nwas $ the 95th percentile reference value for their age and sex (34).\nFood insecurity. Food insecurity was measured using the same\nmethodology employed by the USDA, a well-established and reliable\nmethodology that has been used in the official classifications of food\ninsecurity since the mid-1990s (8). Defined over a 12-mo period, a series\nof 18 questions taken from the CFSM was posed to NHANES mothers;\nthe full set of questions can be found in Supplemental Table 1. As done\nwith the official measures (8), a household with #2 affirmative responses\nto the CFSM was categorized as food secure and a household with $3\naffirmative responses was categorized as food insecure.\nConfounders. Several demographic characteristics were included as\ncovariates in the multivariate analyses. Each has been related to children's\nweight status and the food insecurity status of the child's household\n(10,16\u00ad32). These cofounders included the child's age (y), race/ethnicity\n(Hispanic of any race, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, other),\ngender, and annual household income divided by the poverty line.\nStatistical analyses\nDescriptive statistics were calculated for the total sample, by race/ethnicity\n(non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic), by gender, and by\nrace/ethnicity and gender. Comparisons between the obesity statuses of\nfood-insecure and food-secure children were made for each of the obesity\nmeasures. To test for the statistical significance of differences, x2 tests were\nused. Logistic regression models were estimated to assess the association\nbetween childhood obesity and food insecurity, controlling for other factors\n(i.e. the list of confounders above). The bivariate comparisons and logistic\nregression models were conducted on the full sample and subsamples of\nnon-Hispanic White children, non-Hispanic Black children, Hispanic\nchildren, girls, and boys. We further estimated the logistic regression\nmodels for each of the race/ethnicity categories separately for girls and boys\n(i.e. White non-Hispanic girls, Black non-Hispanic girls, Hispanic girls,\nWhite non-Hispanic boys, Black non-Hispanic boys, and Hispanic boys).\nAs described above, when race-specific obesity cutoffs were available, we\nused these in our subsample analyses. In light of the oversampling of\nHispanics and non-Hispanic Blacks in the NHANES, we used the sampling\nweights supplied by the NHANES for all estimations (48). All analyses\nwere conducted using Stata Version 10 for Windows (53).\nResults\nThe sample when weighted was 44% non-Hispanic White, 22%\nnon-Hispanic Black, and 26% Hispanic (Table 1). Fifty-two\npercent of the children were males and the mean age of the child\nwas 12 y. The mean income:poverty line ratio was 1.04. Regard-\ning our key variables of interests, nearly 37% of the households\nwere food insecure and for the 5 measures of childhood obesity,\nthe range of obese children varied from 15 to 45%. Specifically,\n18% of children were considered obese via BMI assessments,\nand 45% via body fat. Along with the proportions defined as\nobese differing markedly by obesity measure, there were also\ndifferences within measures by race/ethnicity and by gender.\nNext, we broke down food insecurity status by whether a child\nwas obese or not obese according to the 5 measures of obesity\nnoted above (Table 2). Bivariate x2 results for the entire sample\nand for each of the subsamples showed that food-insecure children\nwere no more likely to be obese than their food-secure counter-\nparts across the 5 measures of obesity. It should be noted, however,\nthat food insecurity and obesity often coexist in low-income\nchildren, because, depending on the obesity measure and subsam-\nple assessed, 12\u00ad57% of food-insecure children were also obese.\nWe used logistic regressions to control for other factors. The\nassociation between food insecurity and obesity was nonsignif-\nicant at usual confidence levels for the sample of all children for\nall 5 measures of obesity (Table 3). The nonsignificance of the\nrelationship between food insecurity and obesity also held when\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nwe limited the sample to non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic\nBlacks, and Hispanics, as well as by girls and boys. In addition,\nwhen we assessed the association between food insecurity and\nobesity status for race by gender subgroups (e.g. White non-\nHispanic girls) (results not tabulated), all relationships were\nnonsignificant across all subgroups for all 5 measures of obesity.\nDiscussion\nFood insecurity and childhood obesity were not associated for\nchildren between the ages of 8 and 17 y in households with\nincomes ,200% of the poverty line. This was true when we\nexamined the full sample and when we broke down the sample\nby gender, race/ethnicity, and gender and race/ethnicity. These\nTABLE 1 Descriptive statistics of children and adolescents aged 8\u00ad17 y in households with annual incomes less than 200%\nof the poverty line1,2\nAll White, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic Hispanic Girls Boys\nMeasures of obesity, % above cutoff\nMeasures of body size\n1 Values are means 6 SE or percent.\n2 Data were weighted using sampling weights provided by NHANES (46).\nTABLE 2 Obesity status for food-secure compared with food-insecure 8- to 17-y-old children and\nadolescents assessed using various measures of obesity1\nProportion obese\nn BMI WC, cm TSF thickness, mm Trunk fat mass, kg Body fat, %\nAll\nWhite non-Hispanic\nBlack non-Hispanic\nHispanic\nGirls\nBoys\n1 Data were weighted using sampling weights provided by NHANES (46).\nFood insecurity and childhood obesity 1175\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nresults are consistent with recent findings of no relationship\nbetween food insecurity and childhood obesity (10,20\u00ad24). We\nemphasize that our results held across a wide array of obesity\nmeasures. Previous findings of no relationship between food\ninsecurity and childhood obesity were based only on the BMI\nof the child. Our results demonstrate that the findings from\nthese previous studies may also be robust to other obesity\nmeasures.\nDespite finding no association between food insecurity and\nchildhood obesity, an important point (and paradox) still\nremains: food insecurity and overweight coexist in low-income\nchildren. In our sample, depending on the obesity measure, 12\u00ad\n57% of food-insecure children were obese. The possible reasons\nwhy food-insecure children are also obese may include over-\nconsumption of cheaper, energy-dense foods (54,55), overeating\nduring times when food is more plentiful (56), metabolic\nchanges to ensure a more efficient use of energy (57), different\nstandards of what constitutes an adequate diet (58), parents\noverprotecting their children by giving them more food than\nneeded when food is available (59), and the mother being food\ninsecure during pregnancy (60).\nLow-income, food-insecure children may be obese due to\nother factors associated with residing in a low-income house-\nhold. As noted in the annual reports on food insecurity in the\nUnited States (8), households with lower incomes (vs. those with\nhigher incomes), households headed by a Black non-Hispanic or\nHispanic person (vs. households headed by a White non-\nHispanic person), and households headed by a single person\n(vs. households headed by a married couple) are all more likely\nto be food insecure. These are all factors that have been\nFour limitations of this study and subsequent directions for\nfuture research warrant mention. First, we were unable to\nexamine associations with food insecurity specifically for the\nchild in question. As the availability of food to eat may vary\namong the members in a household, analyses testing the\nrelationship between food insecurity and weight status for a\nparticular child are needed (22,31). Second, compared with\nother data sets, the NHANES more precisely measures the\nphysical characteristics of children, but it does not have as rich a\nset of socioeconomic confounders and income is not as precisely\nmeasured. Future researchers on this topic may wish to use other\ndata sources with richer sets of possible cofounders. To the best\nof our knowledge, a data set that provides measures of the\nphysical characteristics of children as precise as those in the\nNHANES and also has a rich set confounders does not exist for\nthe US. Third, we have not made any causal claims about the\nrelationship between food insecurity and childhood obesity.\nFuture researchers may wish to utilize data sets and empirical\nmodels that allow for establishing causality. Fourth, we did not\nconsider the potential effect of dietary intake and physical\nactivity on childhood obesity. Future work might consider how\nthe interaction of these factors is associated with food insecurity\nand childhood obesity.\nIn conclusion, we emphasize policy implications of our\nwork. Alleviating food insecurity and childhood obesity have\nbeen priorities among policymakers. Policymakers have tools\nto address these issues. Chief among food programs is the Food\nStamp Program. Previous work has presented some evidence\nthat food stamps help to alleviate food insecurity (66\u00ad70).\nAlong with food stamps, policymakers can use other programs\nsuch as the National School Lunch Program, the Temporary\nAssistance to Needy Families program, and the Earned Income\nTax Credit to aid low-income families in meeting the food\nneeds of their children. Regarding childhood obesity, school\nfitness programs and, more broadly, nutrition and wellness\nprograms have had some success in combating child weight\nissues. Our findings that food insecurity and obesity are not\nassociated mean that policymakers can address the dual\nproblems of alleviating food insecurity and childhood obesity\nwithout worrying about possible negative spillovers from one\nto the other.\n"
