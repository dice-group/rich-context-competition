    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article describes the implementation of blended learning in a higher education institution by focusing on the less proficient\nstudents. Malaysia's Ministry of Higher Education has urged every university to introduce blended learning in their teaching\nand learning processes as a new approach. Nevertheless, there are less proficient students who are hesitant, less motivated,\nand face difficulty in associating learning with technological applications. Our main purpose is to show how blended learning\ncan be designed to suit the less proficient students by first identifying their learning styles and then creating a motivating\nsupportive learning system through the use of teaching technology applications. The sample size for this study is 64 business\nprogram students from four groups taking the course Introduction to Statistics in two consecutive semesters. These are\nstudents who had to repeat a few subjects including Introduction to Statistics as well as students who entered university with\nlower qualifications and had to undergo one semester of booster certification program. Final examination scores are used as\na measure of students' performance. Comparison using examination marks scored is shown using independent t test, mean\neffect size, and Box and Whiskers plot. Results showed noticeable difference in examination scores obtained by the different\ngroups of students. As a conclusion, while blended learning approach bears many benefits, it has to be tailored to suit the\ndifferent students' cognitive levels as well as learning styles.\n",

Availability of such technology makes way to the\ndevelopment of blended learning, which is a teaching\napproach that takes advantage of such teaching application\ntools. One such tool is the video that plays an important role\nin replacing the instructor in his or her absence. However,\ntechnology is just a tool. To be able to use the tool, one has to\nhave the know-how and the motivation to use the tool, while\novercoming the fear of not being able to catch up with the\nfast evolving technology.\nMuirhead and Salmon (2002) stated that there is a neces-\nsity to motivate students with poor level of independence as\nonline learning lacks face to face interaction. On the con-\ntrary, social interaction is an inherent characteristic of con-\nventional teaching approach settings. To have an effective\nblended learning approach, a student must have interest in\nthe material taught; be a self-motivated, independent, and\nself-directed learner; be a critical thinker; enjoy family sup-\nport; receive positive and timely feedback; accept responsi-\nbility for own learning; be organized; and possess practical\nknowledge in the use of computers; deficiency in any of\nthese factors may cause poor social interaction among stu-\ndents'community (Irizarry, 2002). Thus, a sufficient solution\nto develop a strong sense of community in students who\nwould feel isolated in a fully online course is to offer one\nwith no complete loss of face-to-face contact.\nWe have developed a blended learning module for a sub-\nject called Introduction to Statistics (Md Noh, Yusoff, &\nYusoff, 2015) and had implemented the module to students\nenrolled in the subject for the past three semesters at a public\nuniversity. The first two semesters were a success where fail-\nure rate among students who were taught using the blended\nlearning module was small and grades achieved were signifi-\ncantly better than students who were taught using conven-\ntional approach (Md Noh et al., 2015). However, in the third\nsemester, a sudden increase in failure rate to more than 25%\nhad opened our eyes to look further into the strengths and\nweaknesses of blended learning especially when it involves\n1UiTM Terengganu, Dungun\nCorresponding Author:\nNur Hidayah Md Noh, Faculty of Computer & Mathematical Sciences,\nUiTM Terengganu, Dungun, Terengganu 23000, Malaysia.\nBlended Learning Approach for Less\nProficient Students\nSarah Yusoff1, Rohana Yusoff1, and Nur Hidayah Md Noh1\n Keywords\ne-learning, Introduction to Statistics, higher institutions, online tools, teaching and learning\n2 SAGE Open\nless proficient students. This article aims to show how blended\nlearning can be designed to suit the less proficient students.\nComparison in grades scored in the final examination is pre-\nsented to show the effect of the redesigned module.\nLiterature Review\nMobile Devices and the Uses of Social Media in\nBlended Learning\nTechnology is undeniably changing the face of education,\nand the technology impact is widely felt by educators and\nlearners. A study was conducted by Gikas and Grant (2013)\nto understand learning perceptions with mobile computing\ndevices and the roles of social media. This study revealed\nthat mobile computing devices and the use of social media\ncreated opportunities for interaction and provided opportuni-\nties for collaboration, student engagement with the content,\nand communication using social media, and Web 2.0 tools.\nAnother perception study about social media, the Twitter,\nwas also conducted by Tur and Mar\u00edn (2015). This study\nrevealed that students perceive that mobile technology is\nuseful in education and are willing to use the Twitter as a tool\nof learning. A similar study about online tools by Montero-\nFleta, P\u00e9rez-Sabater, and P\u00e9rez-Sabater (2015) concluded\nthat Twitter can increase students' confidence in using\nEnglish as a communication language. Likewise, students\nview online tools as an easier learning method and less\nintimidating way to search new vocabulary. Another similar\nstudy about the use of mobiles for learning higher education\nby Al-Emran, Elsherif, and Shaalan (2016) also suggested\nthat mobile-learning can be one of the teaching pedagogies\nin higher education. Even with slow Internet connectivity,\nstudents still view and accept blended learning favorably\nThere are numerous online teaching materials available\nfor every subject with various different approaches. In\nMathematics and Statistics, websites like Khan Academy,\nOpenEd, Sophia.org, Ted Ed, Learn Zillion, DreamBox,\nEdmodo, and Blendspaces are taken as references to produce\nhigh quality teaching materials in blended learning. These\nwebsites use good software applications such as ShowMe,\nEducreation, Knowmia, and Explain Everything in produc-\ning interesting and excellent materials for teaching and learn-\ning tools.\nChallenges of Implementation in Blended\nLearning\nThere are several challenges in implementing blended learn-\ning as a mode of teaching. Khan, Shaik, Ali, and Bebi (2012)\nmentioned an effective way to overcome the challenges is\nsufficient technology support and infrastructure. The biggest\nchallenge in implementing blended learning is to adopt the\nmethod into the teaching and learning system. The same\nchallenge is highlighted in a study by de Jong, Savin-Baden,\nCunningham, and Verstegen (2014). De Jong highlighted six\nmajor issues that are relevant to designing blended learning\nsystems. Two main issues are cultural adaptation and tech-\nnology know-how. Students must be able to change to adopt\nthe new teaching and learning style. However, one should\nnote that social interaction and communication should not be\njeopardized at the expense of technology usage. The role of\nteacher, careful selection of collaboration tools, and techni-\ncal preparation are important considerations when designing\nand implementing blended learning. Teaching materials pro-\nvided online must be carefully chosen to assist successful\nteaching and learning process.\nLim and Morris (2009) highlighted four categories of good\ninstructional design. They are instructor qualities, quality of\nlearning activities, learning support facilities, and study\nworkload. Challenges of blended learning implementation\nhighlighted by Ocak (2011) are complexity of the instruction,\nthe lack of planning and organization, effective communica-\ntion, institutional support, and the lack of electronic means.\nOther challenges identified by Butcher (2016) are time con-\nsuming, changing roles, difficulty in adopting new technolo-\ngies, and the frustration with technical infrastructure and\nindividual learner distraction. Ocak pointed that successful\nimplementation of the blended courses can be affected by\ntheir highly complex and different teaching patterns. Despite\nthe challenges, Kim, Bonk, and Teng (2009) predicted that\nblended learning will become a new teaching pedagogy in the\nfuture trend. The use of technology can be seen as an innova-\ntive challenge to restructure the teaching-learning process and\nintegrate Information and Communications Technology in\nindependent, collaborative, and interactive work. In addition,\nthe blended students are more successful in transferring their\nknowledge to their projects than the ones in the face-to-face\ngroup (Demirer & Sahin, 2013). This finding implies that\nblended learning approach has a positive effect on the transfer\nof learning.\nGood blended learning materials can motivate good stu-\ndents to learn. This is because good students have high moti-\nvation to learn (Lim & Morris, 2009). Salili, Chiu, and Lai\n(2001) found that students, who are confident and motivated\nto learn, spend more time and effort and achieve higher lev-\nels of performance than those who are not confident and not\nmotivated. This is supported by Sankaran and Bui (2001)\nwho found that less motivated learners did not perform as\nwell on knowledge test as motivated students. These less\nmotivated students do not have the same amount of excite-\nment toward the subject matters as the good students. This is\nthe human part of the challenges that an educator has to face\nwhen implementing blended learning.\nFigure 1 shows the blended learning components and per-\ncentage of students who face problems in blended learning.\nThe components are online assessment, classroom tutorials,\nand video power point. The red line represents the component\nwith the highest percentage of student who face problems,\nYusoff et al. 3\nwhile the green line represents the component that best helped\nstudents' understanding. The components that have the high-\nest percentage of students facing problems are online assess-\nment and video power point. Meanwhile, the component that\nbest helped students' understanding is classroom tutorials.\nThese results were obtained by Yusoff et al. in 2015.\nProficiency Levels\nThe term proficiency is used in a variety of ways in educa-\ntion. Other similar terms for less proficient students are less\neffective learners, ineffective learners, poor readers, unsuc-\ncessful learners, or unskilled learners. Educators evaluate\ntests or other forms of assessments by giving scores and\nscales, and thereafter categorize students into several profi-\nciency levels. This method of categorizing students is widely\nused in education to assess students' achievement.\nMost studies found that high proficient students make use\nof strategies more consciously, more purposefully, more\nappropriately, and more frequently than do poor learners\n(Oxford & Nyikos, 1989). Similarly, Naiman, Frohlich,\nStern, and Todesco (1978) found that high proficient stu-\ndents use a great variety of appropriate strategies for both\nreceptive and productive tasks, whereas less effective learn-\ners have a smaller range of strategies and often do not choose\nappropriate strategies for the task.\nMehrdad, Ahghar, and Ahghar (2012) studied reading\ncomprehension across three levels of proficiency (elemen-\ntary, intermediate, and advanced). Mehrdad et al. found\nthat an elementary (less proficient) student is not able to\nbenefit from the cognitive and metacognitive strategies\ncompared with intermediate and advanced learners.\nMehrdad et al. further found that elementary readers\nmainly attend to the factual information in the text and fail\nto relate such information to the general content. Poor\nreaders are not aware of the use of strategies to monitor\ntheir comprehension of texts as well as their strategy use\n(Mokhtari & Reichard, 2002). Lower achiever student's\nuse less metacognitive strategies compared with higher\nPammu, Amir, and Maasum (2014) focused on reading\nstrategies for less proficient tertiary learners. Panmu, Amir,\nand Maasum found that the less proficient learners used top-\ndown strategies for better comprehension. The reading strate-\ngies used was setting purpose for reading, previewing text,\ndetermining what to read, resolving conflicting information,\nand confirming prediction. Another study by Mistar (2001)\nfound that good and poor students in Indonesia use similar\nstrategies but good learners use the strategies more frequently\nand effectively than poor learners do. Chen (1990) found that\nmore proficient learners actually use fewer communication\nstrategies, though they use them more effectively than less\nproficient students. Generally, proficiency has been deter-\nmined on the basis of the educators' judgments about their\nstudents based on the marks or grades and their personal \"on-\nbalance\" assessment of their students given the descriptors of\nhigh proficiency or good, middle proficiency or fair, and low\nproficiency or poor (Magogwe & Oliver, 2007).\nApproach for Less Proficient Students\n\"If I cannot learn the way you teach, will you teach me the\nway I can learn?\" a simple quote from Ignacio Estrada\n(Courtesy of David Zats). In practice, not all teaching meth-\nods can fit all students. Everyone is unique and needs differ-\nent approach. Some of us are fast learners and some of us are\nslow learners. Slow learner is a term used to describe a stu-\ndent with the ability to acquire all necessary academic skills,\nbut at a rate and depth below that of the average student\n(Muppudathi, 2014). Muppudathi suggested that every\nteacher or educator should build self-confidence among slow\nlearners, be able to repeat (saying the same thing over and\nover), and encourage other learning activities. In summary,\nan educator must have innovative approaches or strategies\nfor less proficient students. For example, to build up stu-\ndents' confidence level, an educator may use a simple\napproach first before gradually introducing a more complex\nbut important approach. From experience, we observe that\nthis approach is effective especially for mathematical and\nstatistical subjects.\nFigure 1. Blended learning components and percentage of students who face problems.\n4 SAGE Open\nMethod\nThe sample size for this study is 64 business program stu-\ndents from four groups taking the course Introduction to\nStatistics in two consecutive semesters. The four groups of\nstudents are divided into two samples called Sample A and\nSample B.\nSample A consists of 31 students who took the course\nIntroduction to Statistics from June to October 2015.\nWhereas Sample B consists of 34 students who took the\nA is divided into two groups; one group contains 10 stu-\ndents who had to repeat the subject while the other group\ncontains 21 students comprising of those who had under-\ntaken a booster program because they entered the univer-\nsity with lower qualification, repeaters, and a few good\nstudents (according to their cumulative grades [CGPA]).\nSample A was taught using the Original Blended Learning\n(OBL) module.\nSample B is also divided into two groups; one group con-\nsists of 21 students who had either repeated the subject once,\ntwice, or had dropped the subject when they should have\ntaken it in earlier part of the program. The other group of 13\nstudents is made up of those who had undertaken a booster\nprogram because they entered the university with lower qual-\nification, repeaters of the subject, and several good students\n(according to their CGPA). Students from Sample A who\nfailed their examination and had to repeat the subject are\nincluded in Sample B. Furthermore, both samples of students\nwere instructed by the same lecturer (Mrs. Rohana). Sample\nB was taught using the Redesigned Blended Learning (RBL)\nmodule. Apart from very few good students, the rest of the\nstudents in both samples are considered less proficient in the\ncourse. To give a better insight to readers, a summary of the\ncharacteristics of each sample is shown in Table 1.\nWe have tried to control all possible variables to reduce\nthe differences between the two samples. From Table 1, we\ncan see that Characteristics 1 to 5 for both samples are very\nsimilar. To show whether the redesigned blended module is\nmore effective for less proficient students, we compare final\nexam marks and the total marks (final exam marks plus\ncontinuous assessments marks) for the two samples using t\ntest and look at the mean effect size. The final exam scores\ncan be used for comparison because for every semester, stu-\ndents' answer scripts are inspected by an audit committee\nelected by the university to make sure that markings are\naccording to the marking scheme and no unsolicited marks\ngiven to students' answers willfully. As such, the scores can\nbe taken as true data.\nBrief Description of the OBL Module\nThe blended learning module that we developed consists of\nthree dimensions: face to face (F2F) sessions, self-learning,\nand assessments. The total four contact hours per week is\ndivided into 2 hr F2F and 2 hr self-learning (a ratio of\n50:50). F2F sessions are class sessions where students can\nask questions, discuss, and solve problems in the lecturer's\npresence. At the same time, the lecturer facilitates, explains,\nand provides exercises for students to work on. This is the\ntime when lecturers can ensure that students solve problems\nusing correct methods and understand concepts correctly.\nSelf-learning sessions require students to learn indepen-\ndently anywhere and at their own convenient time. Students\nare provided with videos on all the topics in the syllabus,\nlecture notes, and tutorial exercises.Assessments are embed-\nded in both F2F and self-learning sessions. They consist of\nshort written quizzes, assignments, and tests. The final\nexamination is conducted at the end of the semester after a\nweek of \"study leave\" where no formal lectures are allowed\nduring the week. During F2F sessions, a minimal technol-\nogy application is used; most of the time, instructors use\n\"chalk and talk\" method. While during self-learning, com-\nmunication among students and instructor is made easy with\ninstant messaging applications (WhatsApp and Telegram).\nThe university online learning application is also available\nfor forums, online quizzes, and online accessible storage of\nall teaching materials.\nTo make it easy to differentiate between the OBL module\nand the redesigned module, we are going to call the original\nmodule as OBL module and the redesigned module as RBL\nmodule.\nTable 1.

Teaching module Original Blended Learning Redesigned Blended Learning\nYusoff et al. 5\nRBL Module\nThe following paragraphs describe how the components of\nthe three dimensions of the OBL were tailored to suit the less\nproficient students.\nTechnology applications.During F2F sessions, technology\napplications used in RBL module are Explain Everything\nand Padlet, while during self-learning, similar communica-\ntion applications as in OBL module are used.\nInvestigate learning styles. The first two semesters of students\ninstructed using the OBL module had proven blended learn-\ning is suitable for diverse learning styles. Thus, applying the\nsame method of teaching to all students during F2F and\nassessments are acceptable. However, results from the third\nsemester of blended learning showed that the statement might\nbe true only up to a certain cognitive and motivational level.\nBelow a certain threshold level, we still have to be sensitive\nand cater for the different learning styles when teaching.\nThus, at the beginning of the first class, we asked students to\nanswer a questionnaire on visual, auditory, and kinesthetic\nlearning styles (VAK questionnaire). Results showed that all\nof the less proficient students are kinesthetic whereas the few\ngood students are all either visual or auditory or both. This is\nquite an interesting finding that implies watching and listen-\ning to an instructor's explanation will get the less proficient\nstudents nowhere near to comprehending what is being taught\nand what more to remember the facts and figures. To learn\nquicker, these students have to be doing more activities con-\nnected to the subject rather than only watching and listening.\nRealizing that the students are mostly kinesthetic in learn-\ning style, we have redesigned the original module to include\nmore activities. But that is not enough because asking them\nto do more activities may only rouse complaints as they may\nhave to spend more time on our subject while other subjects\nalso demand their attention. Hence, the instructor has to bal-\nance between the enthusiasm to get the students to learn her\nsubject with the amount of workload given to students.\nMoreover, students will not do the exercises, quizzes, and\nassignments if they are not motivated enough.\nIntegrate videos and lecture notes. Some students have voiced\nout that they find difficulty in concentrating to academic vid-\neos. It is well understood that listening to academic videos\nmay be a boring activity as academic videos do not have the\nattractions of a movie and the likes. What more if some theo-\nretical concepts are not understood by the students? To over-\ncome the problem of understanding the videos, during F2F\nsession, instructor uses the power point videos converted to\nportable document format (PDF) as lecture notes. This is to\nfamiliarize students with the slides in the videos as well as\nfacilitate students' memory of the content. Students could\nask questions about the slides and redo the examples when\nthey watch the video again.Instant feedback on short written\nquizzes. Each of the quizzes takes about 10 to 15 min of the\n2 hr F2F session. The objective is to strengthen memory of\nwhat has been learnt before as well as to motivate students to\nput in effort to learn. It is a way to avoid students passively\nwatching a video which does not achieve any level of rich\nlearning as it does not require the student to do anything but\nsit, watch, and, with a bit of luck, absorb information. For\neach chapter, students are required to watch a fixed number\nof video slides and a topic for the quiz is given. After the\nquiz, students'answers are redistributed among them and the\ncorrect answers are presented together with the marking\nscheme. Students then mark their friends'answers and return\nthe papers to their owners when finished marking. In this\nway, students get instant feedback on their mistakes. All\nmarks achieved are recorded and contribute to a portion of\nthe continuous assessment mark. The reason for this is to\neradicate any idea by the students that the quiz is unimport-\nant and so no need to be concerned with.\nProportion of F2F to self-learning.The proportion of F2F to\nself-learning in OBL module was set to 50:50. In RBL mod-\nule, F2F stays 2 hr but the amount of time allocated for com-\npletely independent self-learning is reduced to 1 hr while\nanother hour of self-learning is set for open book quizzes. So\none open book quiz for every chapter. Every student has to\nsubmit their individual quiz and marks given will be a pro-\nportion of their continuous assessments. Students may\nchoose not to be in class, but they have to come to class to get\nthe question paper. This is to ensure that they make them-\nselves available to do the quiz. They are allowed to discuss\nand to look up notes and books, but it is compulsory for them\nto submit in a specified time set by the instructor. The quiz\nwas designed so that students can finish in 1 hour. Instructor\nis not present in class but is available online to answer any\nquery about the quiz except to give direct answer. Students\nare encouraged to teach and to learn from each other. Espe-\ncially, the better ones are encouraged to teach while the\nweaker ones are encouraged to ask. In this way, we hope to\ncreate a happy and lively study environment for the students.\nThis method overcomes the main disadvantage (Muirhead\nand Salmon, 2002) of blended learning which is the lack of\nface to face social interaction.\nThe main objective for implementing open book quizzes\nis to motivate students to study. Although they are open book\nquizzes, they need to have basic knowledge to hasten their\nunderstanding so that they can finish the quizzes in the speci-\nfied time. Marks for these open book quizzes are given for\nsubmission, not for the correct methods and answers per se.\nHowever, different marks are given for the different amount\nof questions answered completely. This method of assess-\nment helps to relieve the instructor from having to correct\ntoo many quizzes. The answers to an open book quiz are dis-\ncussed in the following F2F session. Students who are absent\nare given a link to Padlet for online submission.\n6 SAGE Open\nContinuous assessment proportion.The continuous assess-\nment consists of tests, quizzes, and open book quizzes. Out\nof 100% total final mark, tests constitute 30% and quizzes\nand open book quizzes constitute 10%. Tests are meant to\nevaluate understanding of the subject material whereas quiz-\nzes and open book quizzes are meant to motivate students.\nThat is why for each set of short instant quizzes, open book\nquizzes, and online quizzes, only the best scores from 30%\nof the total assigned short instant quizzes, open book quiz-\nzes, and online quizzes are counted for the 10%. To motivate\nstudents, this information is kept secret.\nAnalysis and Results\nTable 2 shows the comparison between summary statistics of\nstudents' performance under both OBL and RBL modules.\nTwo different scores are used in the comparison: (a) final\nexam scores only and (b) final exam plus ongoing assess-\nment scores. The mean, median, minimum, and maximum\nvalues for OBL module are all lower than the mean, median,\nminimum, and maximum values for RBL module. In addi-\ntion, lower dispersion in scores (lower standard errors) for\nOBL module indicates that the rest of the scores are close to\nthe mean value. These results indicate that in general, stu-\ndents in RBL module perform better than students in OBL\nmodule.\nWe also extend the analysis to effect size analysis to know\nhow much the effect of RBL module is over the OBL module.\nWe have used the effect size given by Cohen's d . The mean\neffect size for final exam scores only is d = 0.83 while d = 0.93\nfor final exam and ongoing assessment scores. This indicates a\nlarge effect size suggesting high practical significance.\nTable 3 shows the comparison of scores using box-\nplots. From the plots, we can see that the distributions of\nfinal exam scores are almost normal for both OBL and\nRBL modules. However, the distribution of final exam\nand ongoing assessment scores for OBL module is left\nskewed showing the impact of ongoing assessment scores\non the total scores. If the ongoing assessments measure\nstudents' effort, then we can conclude that only half of the\nstudents had dedicated reasonable effort while the other\nhalf had dedicated less than reasonable effort. However,\nin the RBL module, the distribution of final exam and\nongoing assessment scores is still almost normal.\nFurther analysis using independent sample t test is con-\nducted to compare the scores. Results in Table 4 show that\nthere is a significant difference between scores for OBL and\nRBL modules; that is, mean score for RBL module is signifi-\ncantly higher than the mean score for OBL module.\nLimitation\nApart from the difficulty in obtaining identical samples for\nconducting comparison, the other limitation is that the RBL\nmodule has been verified on only two groups of students in\none semester. Further verification with more groups of stu-\ndents is necessary to get more reliable results.\nConclusion and Recommendations\nNowadays, blended learning is a must. If students cannot\nlearn the way we teach them, then as instructors, we must find\nways to change our teaching method. Hopefully, teaching and\nlearning can be joyful as well as a satisfying experience for\nboth students and instructors. Results from this study show\nthat blended learning can be used as a teaching approach for\nless proficient students in the course Introduction to Statistics.\nHowever, the dimensions of the blended learning have to be\ntailored to suit the students' learning styles. This is because\neven though an average proficient student can quickly famil-\niarize and adapt to blended learning approach, less than aver-\nage proficient students need to have additional monitoring to\nencourage higher participation.\nOne important element in the RBL module is the increase\nin opportunity for academic social interaction among stu-\ndents. Through open book quizzes, students have the chance\nto socialize academically through discussion while complet-\ning the questions. This has a tremendous effect on elevating\nshyness and individualistic behavior among students. As a\nresult, they become more helpful, more caring toward each\nother, and more importantly have higher motivation to study.\nFinally as a reminder for us, technology is just a tool; to get\nstudents to work and motivate them to put in effort, the teacher\nis most needed. However, motivation through talking and\nadvice will not have a transcendental effect if not supported by\na good learning system.Agood learning system for a course is\none that offers many opportunities for student enhancement\nsuch as abundant and easy access course materials, instant\nfeedback on progress through quizzes and tests, and an envi-\nronment of helpfulness among colleagues and instructors.\nTable 2.

Through the use of technology,\nthey have easy access to abundant course materials as well as\ntwo-way communication with instructors and colleagues.\nThus, we recommend three elements essential in blended\nlearning for less proficient students: easy access to course\nmaterials, instant feedback, and academic social interaction.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAl-Emran, M., Elsherif, H.
