AO is also linked with cancers of many sites,\nincluding breast, colon, and the kidney (9\u00ad11).\nWhereas the best methods for estimating abdominal fat\npatterning are by imaging techniques such as magnetic\nresonance and computed tomography, an anthropometric\nsurrogate [waist circumference (WC)] is used for large-\nscale population-based studies. Measurement of WC is sim-\nple, requiring only a tape and little training. Also, WC is\nhighly correlated with visceral adiposity, which is recog-\nnized as the most metabolically active form of adiposity\nThe mechanism linking AO with cardiovascular diseases\nis poorly understood. However, the link may be due to its\n*Department of Community Medicine, Department of Family Medicine, and \u00a7Department\nof Internal Medicine, Mercer University School of Medicine, Macon, Georgia; and De-\npartment of Preventive Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City,\nKansas.\nAddress correspondence to Ike S.

Two possible mechanisms\nhave been suggested for the mode of action of AO in\ncardiovascular diseases: 1) through the predominance of the\nhighly sensitive lipolytic hypertrophied visceral adipose tis-\nsues, free fatty acids may provoke insulin resistance\n(14,15); and 2) elevated free testosterone and reduced sex-\nhormone-binding globulin may be triggers for increased\nabdominal adiposity and reduced fractional hepatic extrac-\ntion of insulin (16). Thus, the association of adiposity with\ncardiovascular diseases may be caused by visceral fat depot\ndischarging free fatty acids into the portal and systemic\nNational Institute of Health (NIH) Clinical Guidelines\nrecommend the measurement of waist as a screening tool\nfor health risk (18). The NIH guideline advocates risk\nstratification based on WC. WC values of 102 cm or greater\nin men and 88 cm or greater in women are the cut-off points\nfor AO (18,19). These WC cut-off points were proposed by\nLean et al. (20) and later by Han et al. (21) to assist\nprofessionals in managing subjects with obesity-related co-\nmorbidities.\nSexual dimorphism and ethnic differences are well\nknown for AO (22\u00ad24). As suggested by some investiga-\ntions, blacks have higher upper-body adiposity, based on\nWC, compared with whites (23,24). Blacks' susceptibility\nto AO may be due to their larger visceral fat deposits\n(23,25). Indeed, some investigators suggest that blacks'\npropensity to metabolic aberrations may be a result of\nexcess visceral adiposity compared with whites. Others\nhave postulated that racial differences with regard to upper\nbody fat cells may be associated with racial differences in\nmetabolic risk factors (26).\nDespite racial/ethnic differences in AO, no data exist\ndescribing ethnic trends in AO estimated from WC in U.S.\nadults. Hence, in this report, we describe the changes in the\ndistribution of WC in white, black, and Mexican-American\nsought to determine the prevalence and trends in AO, using\nthe NIH expert panel and World Health Organization con-\nsultation group recommended definitions (18,19).\nResearch Methods and Procedures\nData Source\nThe U.S. National Center for Health Statistics provided\ndatasets that were used in this study. These datasets repre-\nwere from cross-sectional surveys with similar designs and\nwere carried out among noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian\npopulations. Descriptions of the plan and operation of these\nsurveys have been described by other investigators (27,28).\nBriefly, these two surveys have a similar structure and\ndesign and are national in scope.\nThe U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination\nplex, multi-stage sampling plan. This survey was the first\nexamination survey without an upper age limit. Also, in\nNHANES III, a home examination option was employed for\nthe first time to obtain examination data for very young\nchildren and for elderly persons who were unable to visit the\nmobile examination centers.

Approximately 9965 persons\nOnly adults who were identified as non-Hispanic white,\nnon-Hispanic black, or Mexican American between 20 to 79\nyears old were included in this investigation. This study was\nalso restricted to subjects who were measured for WCs.\nWomen who were pregnant at the time of the surveys were\nexcluded from this analysis. In the surveys, waist measure-\nments were made at the natural waist midpoint between the\nlowest aspect of the rib cage and highest point of the iliac\ncrest (to the nearest 0.1 cm).\nDefinition of Terms\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical programs available in SAS for Windows (29)\nand SUDAAN (30) were used for this analysis. To account\nfor unequal probabilities of selection, oversampling, and\nnonresponse, appropriate sample weights were used for the\nanalyses. SE estimates were calculated using the SUDAAN\nstatistical program. For NHANES III, the Taylor series\nlinearization method was used to estimate SEs (30). For\nthe delete 1 jackknife method (31), partitioning the sample\ninto 52 replicates by deleting one unit at a time.\nWC was normalized using Log10\n, and overall and age-\nspecific differences in WC among ethnic groups were as-\nsessed using one-way ANOVA. Sex-specific distribution of\nWC in the population was evaluated using nonparametric\nsmoothed curves, based on sequential calculations of run-\nning medians for groups with adjacent points (32). Preva-\nlences of AO were age-adjusted by direct methods using the\ndesign age groups that have been recommended for analy-\nses. The customary 95%CIs and p values of 0.05 were\nused to indicate statistical significance.\nAbdominal Adiposity in Ethnic Groups, Okosun et al.\nResults\nAmerican subjects were eligible for this investigation.\nOverall and age-specific mean values of WC stratified by\nsex are provided in Table 1.

The largest absolute differ-\nence between study periods in WC was observed in the 20-\nto 39-year-old Mexican-American men, with a difference of\n8.7 cm. In women, blacks had greatest overall and age-\nspecific WC compared with whites and Mexican Americans\nin both study periods. In women, the largest difference\nbetween study periods in WC was observed in the 20- to\n39-year-old black women, with a difference of 4.7 cm.\nThe distribution of WC in the population was evaluated\nin white, black and Mexican-American men and women for\nIn men, the distribution curves shifted to the right, indicat-\nthat were investigated.

This concept has\nsubsequently been popularized by Lean et al. (20) and Han\net al. (21) and has gained considerable support from differ-\nent studies.

Because of the voluminous\ndata in recent years regarding the negative effects of obe-\nsity, we hypothesized a statistically significant decrease in\nwith the prevalence of AO that was recorded in the 1988 to\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to describe trends\nin AO in the three predominant U.S. ethnic groups. This is\nalso the first investigation to use the new proposed WC\ncut-off point for obesity recommended by the NIH expert\npanel on the identification, evaluation, and the treatment of\noverweight and obesity to assess the three U.S. ethnic\ngroups (18) These series of surveys represent the best avail-\nable data because the sampling schemes were similar and\nrepresentative of the national population. The training pro-\ngram and quality control measures instituted in the surveys\ngive an added credibility to the data. An important limita-\ntion of this study, however, is that the data are inadequate\nfor determining the causes of the relatively quick increase in\nthe prevalence of AO as defined by WC cut-off points.\nOur study showed increases in WC in white and black\nmen and women and Mexican-American men in 1999 to\nof the three ethnic groups that were investigated. The shift\nto the right was greater in women than men. The result of\nthis investigation showed overall higher prevalences of AO\nwomen. The greatest difference in the overall prevalence of\nAO between men and women was observed among blacks,\nthe study periods in prevalences of AO in 40- to 59-year-old\nMexican-American men and overall and age-specific cate-\ngories studied in Mexican-American women.\nThe shifts in the distribution of WC to higher values and\noverall increases in AO for each of the three ethnic groups\nin men and women (except Mexican-American men 40 to\n49 years old and all Mexican-American women) are con-\nsistent with those using BMI as the marker for obesity. The\nage-adjusted prevalence of obesity using BMI increased\nThe overall increase in the prevalence of AO in 1999 to\nin epidemiological and clinical journals since NHANES III\nregarding the negative effects of obesity, may be explained\nby public health inability to publicize ill effects of obesity\n(35). Arguably, the lack of decrease in AO may also be\nattributed to the short time periods between surveys. Dis-\nease changes caused by public health interventions are often\nassociated with much larger time periods (in excess of the\nAbdominal Adiposity in Ethnic Groups, Okosun et al.\nTable 1.

Other investigators believe that the low rate of phy-\nsician counseling about exercise and nutrition for obesity\nmay, in part, be associated with the lack of significant\ndecrease in overall adiposity (36). Reasons for decrease in\nAO among Mexican-American women of all ages and Mex-\nican-American men 40 to 49 years old are not clear and\nwarrant further studies.\nThe contribution of AO to cardiovascular diseases and to\nracial/ethnic differences in cardiovascular disease risks is\nof type 2 diabetes in white, black, and Hispanic women,\nrespectively, could have been avoided if AO were absent\nof racial/ethnic differences in the risk of type 2 diabetes\nbetween white and black women and between white and\nHispanic women, respectively (3). Also, compared with\nrespectively, the increased risk for development of hyper-\ntension if they had high values of AO (37). Similarly,\nclustering of insulin resistance syndromes associated with\nAO occurred significantly more often in blacks or Hispanics\ncompared with whites (38).\nMetabolic abnormalities caused by AO start in childhood\n(39). Fifty percent of obese children remain obese when\nthey grow up (40), and they develop insulin resistance\nsyndromes such as hypertension, glucose intolerance, dys-\nlipidemia, and hyperinsulinemia in adolescence and young\nadulthood (41). These facts have important implications for\nearly prevention and management of insulin resistance syn-\ndromes.\nConclusion\nThis study demonstrates a clear increase in AO between\nfor screening and treatment for obesity. With the exception\nof Mexican-American women, AO is increasing in all three\nU.S. ethnic groups that were evaluated in this study. Obesity\npreventive measures should target high-risk groups.
