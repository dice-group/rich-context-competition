Data from the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988\u00ad1994) were used to compare whether energy, nutrient, and food\nyears: those born in Mexico, those born in the United States whose primary language was Spanish, and those\nborn in the United States whose primary language was English. Percentages of persons who met the national\ndietary guidelines for fat, fiber, and potassium and the recommended intakes of vitamins and minerals\nassociated with cardiovascular disease were also compared. In general, Mexican Americans born in Mexico\nconsumed significantly less fat and significantly more fiber; vitamins A, C, E, and B6; and folate, calcium,\npotassium, and magnesium than did those born in the United States, regardless of language spoken. More\nwomen and men born in Mexico met the dietary guidelines or recommended nutrient intakes than those born in\nthe United States.

However, risk\nfactors for CVD (e.g., elevated blood pressure, obesity, cig-\narette smoking, elevated blood cholesterol, non-insulin-\ndependent diabetes mellitus) vary greatly among the diverse\nsubgroups of this population. For example, a recent analysis\nof a US sample of Mexican Americans (who comprise two-\nthirds of the US Hispanic population) found that those born\nin the United States had significantly higher levels of CVD\nrisk factors than those born in Mexico; furthermore, among\nMexican Americans born in the United States, those who\npredominantly spoke Spanish exhibited markedly higher\nlevels of risk factors than their counterparts who predomi-\nnantly spoke English (3). Other studies of different ethnic\ngroups have reported similar associations of country of birth\n(migration status) and language spoken (acculturation sta-\ntus) with elevated CVD risk factor levels (4\u00ad6).\nChanges in diet often occur when groups of people\nmigrate or become more acculturated, which may influence\ntheir levels of risk factors for CVD (7). For example, sub-\ngroups of the Hispanic population show distinct differences\nin dietary intakes according to country of birth (8, 9), gen-\nerational status (10), and primary language spoken (11). In\ngeneral, Hispanics born in the United States eat diets higher\nin fat and lower in fiber compared with Hispanics born out-\nside the United States. Moreover, Hispanics who have lived\nin the United States for more than one generation or who are\nmore acculturated (defined as speaking English) report\nhigher average intakes of fat and lower average intakes of\nfiber than first-generation Hispanics who have stronger ties\nhowever, have not shown consistent patterns of vitamin and\nmineral intakes among the different subgroups of Hispanics.\nThese studies also have been limited by small sample sizes\n(9) or restricted geographic areas (11\u00ad13) or have included\nonly women (9, 10); thus, they fail to represent the overall\nUS population. Furthermore, they have not examined level\nof acculturation by both country of birth and primary lan-\nguage spoken to further differentiate Hispanics living in the\nUnited States today.\nSocioeconomic status (SES) often accounts for ethnic dif-\nferences in CVD risk factors, including factors related to\nDifferences in Dietary Intakes in a US Sample of Mexican Americans 549\ndietary intake (14\u00ad16). However, diet studies of Hispanic\npopulations that have analyzed SES report inconsistent find-\nings. For example, the San Antonio Heart Study showed that\nHispanic men living in higher SES neighborhoods had\nhigher fat intakes than Hispanic men living in lower SES\nneighborhoods (17). In contrast, the San Luis Valley\nDiabetes Study showed that Hispanics whose SES was\nhigher (as measured by number of years of education) had\nlower fat intakes than Hispanics whose SES was lower (18).\nUnfortunately, past studies of diet and health that used US\nsamples have not clarified these inconsistent findings, possi-\nbly because they have not accounted for differences in SES.\nIn the present study, we analyzed dietary data on 2,853\nMexican-American women and men from the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)\nwho were differentiated according to country of birth and\nprimary language spoken: those born in Mexico, those born\nin the United States whose primary language was Spanish,\nand those born in the United States whose primary language\nwas English. Our first objective was to compare intakes of\nenergy and nutrients related to CVD from 24-hour dietary\nrecalls among the three groups of Mexican Americans, after\nadjusting for age and SES (as measured by years of educa-\ntion). Our second objective was to determine to what degree\neach group met the nationally recommended intakes for\ndietary fat, fiber, and selected vitamins and minerals. Our last\nobjective was to compare the frequencies of intake of foods\nreported on a 1-month food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)\namong the three groups and to evaluate these qualitative\nresults in relation to the quantitative nutrient intakes deter-\nmined from 24-hour dietary recalls.\nNHANES III, a large US survey conducted from 1988 to\n1994, is a major source of information on the nutritional and\nhealth status of the US civilian population aged 2 months or\nmore (19) and used the same stratified multistage probability\ndesign as previous National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Surveys (20, 21). Mexican Americans were\noversampled to produce statistically reliable health estimates\nfor the largest ethnic minority group in the United States. The\ndata were collected via standardized questionnaires adminis-\ntered by health professionals at participants' homes; stan-\ndardized medical examinations by physicians, medical tech-\nnicians, and other health professionals at National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey mobile examination centers;\nand laboratory tests on whole blood and sera.\nStudy sample\nThe sample for our analyses included 1,449 Mexican-\nAmerican women and 1,404 Mexican-American men aged\n25\u00ad64 years who completed both the home questionnaire\nand medical examination. We used age 25 years as our lower\nage cutpoint because educational attainment (a covariate in\nour multivariate regression models) often is not complete\nbefore this age. Age 64 years was used as our upper age cut-\npoint to avoid problems regarding selection effects due to\nnon-CVD-caused morbidity and mortality (22). We\nexcluded data for respondents who were pregnant (n  63),\nthose for whom education information was lacking (n \n20), and those whose surveys were coded as unreliable (n \n2). In our analyses of energy and nutrient intakes, we\nexcluded an additional 141 subjects whose 24-hour dietary\nrecalls were coded as unreliable and 50 subjects who\ncalories. Respondents who were excluded represented the\nthree Mexican-American groups defined below.\nDefinition of variables\nRace/ethnicity was based on asking respondents to clas-\nsify their ethnicity as Black; Mexican or Mexican American;\nWhite, non-Hispanic; Asian or Pacific Islander; Aleut,\nEskimo, or American Indian; or other Latin American or\nother Spanish. Respondents who chose Mexican or Mexican-\nAmerican ethnicity were included in our analysis. Migration\nstatus and level of acculturation were indicated, respectively,\nby country of birth and primary language spoken at home,\nboth factors that have shown high levels of validity and reli-\nability (23) and that reflect the strength of cultural beliefs and\npractices and influence health status (24). To explore whether\ndietary patterns differed according to migration status, level\nof acculturation, or both, we divided the respondents into\nthree groups: those born in Mexico, those born in the United\nStates whose primary language spoken at home was Spanish,\nand those born in the United States whose primary language\nspoken at home was English.\nInformation on educational attainment was collected as a\ncontinuous variable and was defined as the highest number\nof years of education completed. We chose years of educa-\ntion as our measure of SES because few data tend to be\nmissing, it remains valid throughout adulthood, and it is\navailable for persons not employed outside the home (25).\nMeasurement of diet\nNutrient and food intakes were assessed for the three\ngroups of Mexican-American women and men by using a\nsingle 24-hour dietary recall and a 1-month qualitative FFQ.\nThe 24-hour dietary recall was administered by bilingual\nSpanish-speaking interviewers at the mobile examination\ncenters; an automated, interactive interview and coding sys-\ntem were used that featured a standardized interview format\nand automated probes to obtain detailed information about\nfoods, including brand names, preparation methods, and\ningredients used in preparation (26). Three-dimensional\nfood models, measurement aids, and food-specific units\nwere used to estimate amounts consumed. Not included\nwere nutrients obtained from nutritional supplements, med-\nications, and seasonings added to prepared foods at the\ntable. From the 24-hour dietary recall, we determined total\ncalories, percentage of calories from total fat and saturated\nfat, and the following nutrients: cholesterol, fiber, vitamin\nA, vitamin C, vitamin E, folate, vitamin B6, calcium, potas-\nsium, and magnesium. These nutrients were selected\nbecause of their association with CVD (27\u00ad29).\nThe FFQ, administered during the household interview,\nwas used to ask respondents about the average number of\ntimes foods were eaten during the 1-month period preceding\nthe interview date. Frequencies of consumption of foods\nfrom the following food groups were ascertained: milk and\nmilk products, meat and egg dishes, fruits and fruit juices,\nvegetables, grains and legumes, desserts, and added fats.\nWe also determined the percentages of respondents, by\nmigration status and level of acculturation, who met the US\ndietary guidelines (30\u00ad32) or recommended intakes of\nselected nutrients (33\u00ad35). Dietary guidelines included total\nfat (30 percent kcal/day), saturated fat (<10 percent\nkcal/day), cholesterol (300 mg/day), fiber (25 g/day), and\npotassium (3,500 mg/day). Intake of vitamin A was com-\npared with the Recommended Dietary Allowances (33);\nvitamin C, vitamin E, folate, vitamin B6, calcium, and mag-\nnesium were compared with the Dietary Reference Intakes\n(34, 35). Percentages of Mexican Americans who reported\ntaking a vitamin or mineral supplement in the past month\nwere also determined from a question asked during the\nhousehold interview.\nStatistical analysis\nPrimary analyses, using multiple linear regression mod-\nels, were carried out with SUDAAN software (version 7.11;\nResearch Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North\nCarolina) to adjust for the complex sample design of\nNHANES III (19). All analyses incorporated sampling\nweights that adjusted for unequal probabilities of selection.\nMultivariate analyses were conducted separately for men\nand women. The dependent variables were energy and nutri-\nent intakes. The independent variables were the three migra-\ntion and acculturation groups (Mexican born, US-born\nSpanish speaking, and US-born English speaking), educa-\ntional attainment (in years, centered at the sample mean for\neach gender to aid in interpretation of the regression coeffi-\ncients), age (centered at the sample mean for each gender),\nand their first-order interactions.\nThe SAS System for Windows (version 6.12; SAS\nInstitute, Cary, North Carolina) was used to determine the\nfrequencies of various demographic characteristics, percent-\nages of persons who met the dietary guidelines or recom-\nmended intakes of nutrients or who took a vitamin or min-\neral supplement, and frequencies of foods and food groups\nreported from the FFQ by the three groups of Mexican\nAmericans. Sampling weights also were incorporated in\nthese analyses.\nRESULTS\nborn in Mexico were more likely to live in urban areas, have\nlarger families, have lower educational attainment and\nhigher levels of poverty, perform unskilled labor (e.g., agri-\nculture, construction, assembly line), and be without health\ninsurance than those born in the United States (table 1).\nThe results of the regression models comparing US-born\nSpanish-speaking and US-born English-speaking women\nand men with women and men born in Mexico, adjusted for\neducation and age, are shown in table 2. While there were no\nsignificant differences in energy intake among the three\nTABLE 1.

There were significant differences in nutrient intakes\nby migration status; women and men born in Mexico\nshowed more healthful nutrient intakes than US-born\nwomen and men, regardless of acculturation status. For\nwomen, the percentage of calories from total fat and satu-\nrated fat was lower for those born in Mexico, except for US-\nborn Spanish-speaking women, whose percentage of calo-\nries from saturated fat was not significantly different. The\npercentage of calories from monounsaturated fat also was\nlower for women born in Mexico, but the percentage of\ncalories from polyunsaturated fat did not differ among the\nthree groups of women (data not shown). The results for\nmen were similar, with the exception of US-born English-\nspeaking men, whose percentage of calories from total fat\nwas not significantly different. The only significant differ-\nence regarding cholesterol was found for US-born English-\nspeaking men, whose intakes were lower than those of their\ncounterparts.\nParalleling the lower intakes of fat among women and\nmen born in Mexico were higher intakes of several vita-\nmins and minerals. Both women and men born in Mexico\nhad significantly higher intakes of vitamin C, folate, vita-\nmin B6, and calcium than US-born women and men,\nregardless of language spoken. With the exception of US-\nborn Spanish-speaking women, intakes of fiber, potassium,\nand magnesium also were significantly higher among\nwomen and men born in Mexico. Women and men born in\nMexico also had significantly higher vitamin E intakes than\nUS-born Spanish-speaking women and men and signifi-\ncantly higher vitamin A intakes than US-born English-\nspeaking women and US-born Spanish-speaking men.\nSeveral significant first-order interactions were found (p <\n0.05) between the three groups and education or age.\nHowever, they were of low magnitude and did not appear\nto be clinically meaningful.\nThe least-squares means, adjusted for education, age,\nand all first-order interaction terms, are presented in table\n3. Differences in folate and calcium intake appear particu-\nlarly clinically significant between Mexican-born and US-\nborn women and men. With the exception of vitamin A, no\nsignificant differences in nutrient intakes were found\nbetween Spanish-speaking and English-speaking US-born\nMexican Americans. Similar results were found when\nnutrient densities, as measured by nutrient intakes per\n1,000 calories, were compared among the three groups of\nwomen and men.\nConsistent with the results reported above, higher per-\ncentages of women and men born in Mexico met the US\ndietary guidelines for total and saturated fat, fiber, and\npotassium than did their US-born counterparts (table 4).\nFurthermore, higher percentages achieved 100 percent or\nmore of the recommended intakes of vitamin C, folate,\nTABLE 3.

While approximately\none-fourth to one-third of all Mexican Americans reported\ntaking a vitamin or mineral supplement in the past month,\nfewer women and men born in Mexico reported this behav-\nior than their counterparts did. For all dietary comparisons,\nno consistent pattern of differences was found between the\nUS-born Spanish- and English-speaking groups.\nFor the migration and acculturation groups, the average\nnumber of times foods were consumed during the 1-month\nperiod preceding the respondent's interview date is summa-\nrized in table 5. There were few differences in the patterns\nof milk, meat, and egg consumption. Women and men born\nin Mexico consumed more fruits and fruit juices, vegetables,\nand grains and legumes than did those born in the United\nStates. Of note are the differences in consumption of salty\nsnacks (e.g., chips, pretzels), desserts, and added fats (e.g.,\nsalad dressings, margarine) by migration status and level of\nacculturation. In general, English-speaking women and men\nborn in the United States reported the highest levels,\nSpanish-speaking respondents born in the United States\nreported intermediate levels, and respondents born in\nMexico reported the lowest levels. It is important to recog-\nnize that our food intake data were not tested for statistical\nsignificance because of the large number of comparisons\nmade. However, the pattern of food intake (e.g., added fats)\nwas consistent with that of nutrient intake (e.g., percentage\nof calories from total fat) observed across the three groups\nof Mexican-American women and men.\nDISCUSSION\nThis study compared intakes of nutrients related to CVD\nand foods in a US sample of Mexican-American women and\nmen differentiated by country of birth and primary language\nspoken. Overall, women and men born in Mexico had the\nhealthiest nutrition profiles despite lower levels of education\nand more persons living below the poverty level. This finding\nsuggests that migration status may be an important determinant\nof diet. In contrast, nutrition profiles were similar for Mexican-\nAmerican women and men born in the United States regardless\nof language spoken, suggesting that this measure of accultura-\ntion was not an important determinant of diet in this sample.\nOne possible explanation for the lack of differences in\ndiet according to primary language spoken may be that all\npersons in the United States are similarly exposed to food\nadvertising and food choices from the time they are young.\nPast research provides evidence that food choices made dur-\ning childhood influence food choices made during adult-\nhood (36). In contrast, lack of exposure to Americanized\ndietary habits during childhood may have contributed to the\nhealthier diets of Mexican Americans born in Mexico, most\nof whom came to the United States as adults.\nComparison to other research\nIn general, we found that women and men born in Mexico\nconsumed significantly fewer calories from total and satu-\nTABLE 4.

Our energy\nand nutrient results, with the exception of dietary choles-\nterol, agree with findings from the few studies that have\nevaluated the diets of Hispanics or Mexican Americans by\ncountry of birth, generational status, or primary language\nwas significantly higher in first-generation Mexican-\nAmerican women. In our study, only men born in Mexico\nreported a significantly higher cholesterol intake compared\nwith US-born men.\nOur results differ from those of the San Antonio Heart\nStudy and the San Luis Valley Diabetes Study. For example,\nin contrast to our study, calcium and potassium intakes were\nlowest among the poorest Mexican Americans in the San\nAntonio Heart Study (12) and did not differ by educational\nlevel among Hispanics in the San Luis Valley Diabetes\nStudy (13). These inconsistent findings are possibly due to\nthe different ways in which Hispanics were compared (by\nmigration status and primary language spoken in our study,\nby neighborhood income in the San Antonio Heart Study,\nand by years of education in the San Luis Valley Diabetes\nStudy). Although Balcazar et al. (37) have shown that lan-\nguage spoken and years of education are correlated (r \n0.21), some Hispanics who predominantly speak Spanish\nare highly educated while some Hispanics who predomi-\nnantly speak English have little education. Thus, studies that\ncompare Hispanics by using only one characteristic (e.g.,\ncountry of birth), without adjusting for others (e.g., primary\nlanguage spoken, years of education), may not differentiate\nthis population clearly.\nAs we found for nutrient intakes, a greater proportion of\nMexican-born than US-born Mexican-American men and\nwomen met the dietary guidelines for total fat, saturated fat,\nfiber, and potassium and averaged more than 100 percent of\nthe recommended intakes of vitamin C, folate, vitamin B6,\ncalcium, and magnesium. While approximately half of all\nwomen achieved the recommended intakes of vitamins C\nand B6, less than one-third, including those born in Mexico,\ndid so for vitamin A, vitamin E, folate, calcium, and mag-\nnesium on a given survey day. These percentages must be\ninterpreted with caution, however, because single 24-hour\nrecalls do not represent a person's usual intake. With multi-\nple days of dietary data, the distribution of usual nutrient\nintake would narrow, and more people would probably\nachieve the recommended intakes (38). Nonetheless, other\nstudies (39, 40) also have reported low percentages of\nMexican-American women meeting the recommended\nintakes of folate and calcium. In light of the recent increase\nin the recommended amounts of these nutrients and vitamin\nE (34, 35), nutrition education emphasizing these nutrients\nmay be especially important for all Mexican-American\nwomen, regardless of their country of birth or acculturation\nlevel.\nAn important finding was the higher percentages of US-\nborn women and men who reported taking a vitamin or min-\nTABLE 5.

Although nutrient intakes from food\nsources may decline with increasing acculturation, absolute\nintakes of vitamins and minerals may improve with\nincreased supplement use.\nIn our study, women and men born in Mexico, compared\nwith those born in the United States, consumed more fruits,\nvegetables, and grains and legumes and had the highest\nintakes of traditional Mexican foods such as cornbread, tor-\ntillas, beans, and rice. Our findings agree in part with those of\nings of traditional foods were eaten by less-acculturated com-\npared with more-acculturated Hispanics. Otero-Sabogal et al.\n(41) also found a higher fruit intake among less-acculturated\nHispanics. Our finding of higher vegetable intakes among\nwomen and men born in Mexico was inconsistent with other\nstudies that have shown vegetable intakes to be lower among\nless-acculturated Mexican Americans (9, 37, 41). However,\nthis difference may be explained by how vegetables were\ndefined. For example, some studies excluded potatoes and\ncorn; the FFQ we used included these foods as vegetables.\nAlso, our FFQ had 12 questions about vegetables, while other\nquestionnaires included as few as one question. Research has\nshown that the frequency of foods reported increases with the\nnumber of items asked on the FFQ (38).\nWe also showed lower intakes of desserts and added fats\namong adults born in Mexico compared with US-born\nMexican Americans, a finding that agrees with Schaffer et\nal. (9). However, other studies have reported higher rates of\nfat avoidance by Latinos as acculturation increases (42, 43).\nThese discrepant findings are likely due to differences in the\nsix-item scale used to determine fat avoidance compared\nwith the NHANES III FFQ that asked about three types of\nadded fats.\nOverall, several factors may account for any discrepan-\ncies between our study and other studies of the dietary\nintakes of Mexican Americans, including temporal trends in\nfood intakes, different methods of collecting dietary infor-\nmation, changes in nutrient and food databases, and samples\nfrom different regions of the country (38). Data from all\nstudies were collected in the 1980s, and our study continued\nthrough 1994. Thus, the time frames for all studies were\nsimilar. However, the National Cholesterol Education\nProgram was introduced in the late 1980s, and the mass\nmedia encouraged the general population to reduce their\ndietary fat and cholesterol intakes (44). Many lower-fat\nfoods also were introduced in the marketplace. Nonetheless,\nour results regarding dietary fat are consistent with those\nreported prior to introduction of the National Cholesterol\nEducation Program. Most studies of Mexican Americans\nused similar methods to collect dietary data (i.e., 24-hour\nrecalls to determine nutrient intakes and FFQs to determine\nfood intakes), but the length of the FFQs (e.g., 22 items in\nthe Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey vs.\n62 items in NHANES III), the content of certain items on\nthe FFQs (e.g., added fats), and the time frame (e.g., past\nmonth vs. past year) varied. Another likely explanation for\nany discrepancies is use of different nutrient and food data-\nbases to determine nutrient intakes. For example, prior to\nNHANES III, the US Department of Agriculture databases\nwere more likely to include Americanized, commercially\nprepared Mexican foods rather than the recipes of foods pre-\npared in Mexican-American homes (45). Different data-\nbases also may partially explain conflicting results between\nregions of the country, despite control for SES (12, 13).\nMoreover, Mexican Americans living in different regions of\nthe United States may have access to different foods, espe-\ncially if the availability of foods changes with the seasons.\nLimitations and strengths of our study\nOne limitation of our study is the cross-sectional design\nof NHANES III, which prevented us from drawing causal\ninferences. Dietary assessment tools also have inherent lim-\nitations (38). For example, a single 24-hour dietary recall is\nnot representative of individual nutrient intakes because of\nday-to-day variation in food consumption, and the FFQ used\nin NHANES III is qualitative (i.e., it did not include portion\nsizes, which are required to quantify the number of servings\nof foods eaten). However, a single 24-hour recall is valid for\nmeasuring nutrient intakes of groups, and the FFQ may be\nuseful for ranking persons in terms of the frequency of foods\nor food groups reported (38). Moreover, inclusion of two\ndietary instruments enables a general comparison of results\nfrom each tool (e.g., intake of total fat from the 24-hour\ndietary recall and added fats from the FFQ). As mentioned\npreviously, another limitation regarding dietary data is the\naccuracy of the nutrient and food databases used. However,\nsubstantial care was taken to include a wide variety of tradi-\ntional Mexican foods and to ensure the accuracy of the\nnutrient contents of these foods in the NHANES III database\n(Catherine M. Loria, National Center for Health Statistics,\nA further limitation of NHANES III is the unavailability\nof in-depth data on some important variables. For example,\nour measure of acculturation was based on primary lan-\nguage spoken at home, which is a simple indicator of a very\ncomplex adaptation process involving attitudes, cognitive\nfactors, and personality in addition to language (46). This\ndefinition may explain the inconsistent pattern of differ-\nences we found between Spanish-speaking and English-\nspeaking US-born Mexican Americans. However, language\nuse is a central part of the acculturation process and has been\nused previously as a proxy for acculturation (23).\nIt is also possible that our results showing healthier nutri-\ntion profiles for persons born in Mexico may be explained\nby the \"healthy migrant\" effect, whereby persons who\nimmigrate to the United States consume more nutritious\ndiets than do persons who do not immigrate (47). Therefore,\nour dietary intakes may not be representative of all women\nand men born in Mexico.\nThese limitations are balanced by the strengths of\nNHANES III, which is one of the most extensive US sur-\nveys in existence and includes multiple dietary measures.\nNHANES III also oversampled Mexican-American women\nand men, thus providing sufficient numbers of participants\nin the three acculturation groups and sufficient numbers of\nwomen and men from both the lower and upper SES strata.\nMoreover, our analyses adjusted for education in addition to\nmigration and acculturation status, strengthening our obser-\nvations of differences in dietary intakes among Mexican\nAmericans living in the United States.\nPublic health implications\nThe Hispanic population is anticipated to increase from\n(48). Mexican Americans are projected to constitute the\nlargest increase of all Hispanic groups. As future genera-\ntions of Mexican Americans make the transition further\naway from their native culture, healthful diets should be\nencouraged to prevent an increased risk of heart disease and\npremature mortality.\nOur findings of more healthful nutrition profiles among\npersons born in Mexico highlight the need to encourage all\nMexican Americans to eat more foods such as whole grains,\nbeans, and cereals as well as fruits, vegetables, and dairy\nfoods that are low in fat and high in fiber, vitamins, and min-\nerals. Nutrition education is needed for second-generation\nMexicanAmericans as they become further removed from the\nheart-healthy traditions of their native country and enter a\nsocial milieu in which unhealthy foods are ubiquitous.\n"
