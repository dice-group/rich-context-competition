    "abstract": "Abstract\nCommunity development emphasizes the utilization of community resources, also known as community capitals. However,\nit is often difficult for the community to access these resources; this difficulty retards development. Such is the predicament\nfaced by the Orang Kuala, for whom coastal changes have resulted in greater difficulty in accessing their community resources.\nNor is that the only threat that they face. For affirmation of these threats, this article lists two objectives, that is, to\nidentify the accessibility of marine resources and to explain the types of threats faced by the Orang Kuala. To achieve these\nobjectives, a study was conducted involving 51 household heads and 5 Orang Kuala informants, all of whom are residents\nof Sungai Layau village in Johor, Malaysia. This study uses a mixed-method approach, the concurrent embedded design, and\nalso interview-based questionnaires and in-depth interviews simultaneously. For the first objective, the results show that the\nOrang Kuala can still attain community resources in the form of marine products. However, the Orang Kuala faced three\ntypes of threats: trends, shocks, and seasonal changes. The most significant threat to the Orang Kuala is the trend, that\nis, cost of living and social problems. These threats can reduce their chances of acquiring benefits from these community\nresources. This condition is called \"vulnerability of community capitals.\" The objective of this article is to put forth proposals\non how to increase the capacity of community resources for the Orang Kuala so that their community can attain sustainable\ndevelopment. This proposal is based on the reality that the threats facing the Orang Kuala are at a critical level and that they\nare ready to accept changes.\n",

This follows the bottom-up principle and is\nconsistent with the objectives of community development.\nAccording to Diacon and Guimar\u00e3es (2003), the aim of com-\nmunity development is to empower marginalized communi-\nties. This involves building confidence, building the capacity\nand sustainability of networks available in the community,\nand restoring its physical, economic, and social structures.\nAccording to Brennan and Barnett (2009), community devel-\nopment is a reflection of the local population's ability to\nmobilize and manage the resources available to meet the\nneeds of local communities. Both definitions refer to com-\nmunity resources and their importance to community\ndevelopment.\nHowever, this does not mean that it is necessary to set\naside elements that pose a threat to community development.\nFor example, Payne (2006) observed that if less cohesive-\nness is present, communities can become paralyzed.\nMeanwhile, Pyles and Harding (2012) discovered that an\nactivity that displays the intimate relationships among com-\nmunity members is an element that aids in the success of\ncommunity development. On the other hand, if community\ncohesion decreases, anomie symptoms will be evoked in the\ncommunity, from which loneliness can result in suicides.\nAmir Zal, Samah, and Redzuan (2012) consider the threat\nof community development from a different angle; that the\nproblem cannot be involved in the community, which leaves\nthe side effects to the youth and known victims of disempow-\nerment. Disempowerment is a condition that is contrary to\nempowerment. As a result of disempowerment, the commu-\nnity cannot develop because community resources in the\nform of human capital cannot be utilized by the youth.\nUtilization of community resources for community\n1Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia\n2Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Malaysia\nCorresponding Author:\nW.

A. Amir Zal1, Mustaffa Omar2, Hood Salleh2, and\nSharina Ab. Halim2\n Keywords\nOrang Kuala, community capitals, forms of threats, trend factors, shock factors, seasonal factors\n2 SAGE Open\ndevelopment can be explained through the Asset-Based\nCommunity Development (ABCD) approach. ABCD is an\nalternative approach to replace the needs-based approach\n(Boyd, Hayes, Wilson, & Bearsley-Smith, 2008). It includes\nstrategies to identify and mobilize community \"assets\" for a\nchange (Boyd et al., 2008). The assets in the context of the\nABCD do not refer to purely economic factors but include\nthe capacities of the community (Kretzmann & McKnight,\n2005), such as natural, human, social, cultural, political, and\nfinancial assets (Callaghan & Colton, 2008; Fey, Bregendahl,\n& Flora, 2006). Through those assets, communities no lon-\nger rely on foreign societies to solve their problems, using\ninstead the maximal resources in their communities\nThis approach, however, is not always right for all situa-\ntions. A study by Mulligan and Nadarajah (2012) reviewed\nthe lessons to be derived from community rebuilding in the\nwake of the 2004 tsunami that struck India and Sri Lanka.\nThose scholars found that the participation of community\nmembers in the beginning is not ideal, but remedial assis-\ntance from outside parties is necessary in the beginning. This\nassistance is not easy to implement. According to Islam and\nMorgan (2012), external organizations, particularly non-\ngovernmental Organizations (NGOs), need social capital to\nachieve community empowerment. The forms of such\nempowerment are collective action, social trust, coordination\nand cooperation of mutual benefits, and sharing norms and\nvalues.\nThese resources are of great importance as a catalyst for\ncommunity development. Threats to a community can be\nseen in terms of accessibility to community resources and\noccur when community resources that should be used for the\npurpose of incentivizing the community to achieve a better\nlife, whether economic, social, or administrative, cannot be\nfully utilized. The situation becomes more serious when\nresource accessibility becomes difficult to achieve and com-\nmunities are no longer free to use the resources. The failure\nto take advantage of community resources for community\ndevelopment is a big setback for any community. This situa-\ntion puts the community in a vulnerable state and subtracts\nfrom its development.\nThe Orang Kuala is an indigenous Proto-Malay tribe, and\nthey are noticed to be undergoing changes. They are dis-\ntinctly different from the Orang Asli Darat, which depends\non the forests. In contrast, the Orang Kuala tribe is known as\nOrang Asli Laut due to their total dependence on a marine\nenvironment (Amir Zal, Redzuan, Samah, & Hamsan, 2012).\nThey catch fish in the watersheds by boat and lead a nomadic\nlife (Yuszaidy Mohd Yusoff, Mohamad Nazri Ahmad, &\nMohamed Anwar Omar Din, 2009). History indicates that\nthe Orang Kuala play a significant role as pirates, robbing\ncertain groups as a strategy to protect the interests of the\nMalay Sultanate.\nAccording to Andaya (2008), Orang Kuala individuals\nwere warriors and ship captains during the days of the Malay\nSultanate. Their knowledge of the sea made them invaluable\nin these roles. However, after the fall of the Malay Sultanate,\nthe Orang Kuala went back to living as fishermen, becoming\ncompletely dependent on the sea, where they could find and\nexploit marine resources for their survival.\nA study conducted by Yuszaidy Mohd Yusoff et al. (2009)\nfound that Orang Kuala have greatly changed but have\nneglected their identity as the Sea Peoples. Similarly, a study\nconducted by Amir Zal, Redzuan, Samah, and Hamsan\n(2013) also found that the Orang Kuala are forgetting their\nidentity with some of them assuming that they are the\nMalays. The denial of the original identity affects their com-\nmunity capitals as it induces less access to their community\ncapitals. Consequently, this scenario is significant to the\nstudy because it can be a determining factor to the survival of\nthe community.\nThe Orang Kuala Rhetoric of Threats\nA study by Amir Zal, Redzuan, et al. (2012) shows changes\nin the Orang Kuala's way of life. Current investigations show\nthat they have become actively involved in business activi-\nties in which they have shown some measure of success. The\nhistory of Orang Kuala stated that their economic activity is\nTheir participation in economic activities is not as minor\ncharacters but as a supplier of marine products to the Chinese\neconomic activity was threatened due to the engagement of\nthe Bugis Sulawesi community in the same economic activ-\nity (Harper, 1997). The vulnerability became more critical\nwhen the Malays from Indonesia in the mid-19th century\nmigrated massively to the Orang Kuala economic activities\nand grabbed the same resources (Harper, 1997). The situa-\ntion is deepened and further weakens the Orang Kuala\nthrough a political problem that marginalizes the role of\nOrang Kuala in the economy. Thus, the Orang Kuala eco-\nnomic activity is no longer a significant contributor to the\nwhole of society.\nHowever, in the 20th century, they reengage in the activi-\nties of the current economy. They are still focusing on the\ntraditional economic activities as fishermen, but at the same\ntime, they worked as traders, importers, and middlemen sell-\ning second-hand goods such as clothes from Singapore and\nexporting vegetables. Their participation in economic activi-\nties is not recorded properly, so it is difficult to obtain accu-\nrate data on the number of people who were involved in a\nnew economic activity. Even so, they have not completely\nleft their old ways behind. For the tribe, the sea still forms the\ncore of their identity. They still remain close to the sea, even\nif only as a pastime or a hobby (Amir Zal, Redzuan, et al.,\nA variety of development activities have been imple-\nmented on the coast. Coastal developments are beneficial but\nAmir Zal et al. 3\nalso pose a threat to the community. For example, surveys\nconducted by Stead (2005) and Er, Selvadurai, Ardieansyah,\nand Jusoh (2011) show that development in coastal commu-\nnities has resulted in the destruction and loss of coastal\nmarine resources and caused changes in marine ecology.\nThis situation also affects the Orang Kuala, as their environ-\nment has also been exposed to development, and it raises\nquestions about the accessibility of their marine resources.\nSo far, only developments on the coast have been associ-\nated with threats to coastal communities. However, there are\nother forms that can also pose a threat, such as natural disas-\nters, shocks, and trends. Natural disasters refer to threats that\ncannot be controlled and therefore are not a conscious option\nchosen by the coastal community, such as seasonal changes\nwith regard to monsoon circulations. Trend threats refer to\nchanges in the economy, social situations, and leadership.\nShocks are a form of threat that cannot be detected at an early\nstage and can occur suddenly. Not only is the irrelevant\ndevelopment to be associated with the threat to coastal com-\nmunities, but there is a threat in other forms as well. These\nare the issues that have determined the objectives of this\nstudy, which are to identify the accessibility of marine\nresources and to explain the types of threats faced by the\nOrang Kuala.\nCoastal Communities and Strength of Marine\nResources\nThe survival of fishermen depends entirely on marine\nresources. However, it is not only fishermen who depend on\nthese resources, for the general public is also dependent on\nthe produce supplied by the fishermen. Therefore, the fisher-\nman is a significant moderator of the access of marine\nresources and their distribution to the public. However, their\nrole is often underestimated and viewed as second-class,\ndespite the fact that the fisherman is able to generate a good\nincome (Hassan, Shaffril, D'Silva, Omar, & Bolong, 2011).\nThe generation of a substantial income shows that marine\nresources can propel economic growth. Fishermen play a\ncrucial role in the economic development of the country (Siti\nZobidah & Chhachhar, 2012). Thus, marine resources are\nimportant resources in the coastal community and to the gen-\neral public.\nCoastal communities are often faced with difficulty in\naccessing marine resources. According to Svensson,\nRodwell, and Attrill (2010), reductions in the number of fish\ncaught throughout the past decade is a problem that has been\nfaced by all communities. According to Clay and Olson\n(2008), some fishing communities are threatened because\nthey are directly affected by the shortage of marine resources.\nThis reality is similar to that found in the study conducted by\nPakpahan, Lumintang, and Susanto (2006) in North Jakarta.\nThe study found that coastal communities face difficulties in\nincreasing income, especially during certain seasons, which\nwill determine whether the crop that they harvest is a bumper\none or a dud. This puts them in a vulnerable situation and\nmay even invite other problems, including political, social,\nand economic problems (Clay & Olson, 2008). These prob-\nlems can result in poverty for the fishermen (Tzanatosa et al.,\n2006). Unfortunately, these particular problems are beyond\nthe control of anyone in the coastal communities.\nVast coastlines have opened many opportunities for the\ndevelopment of economic-oriented profit. These include\ntourism, agriculture, aquaculture, housing, industry, ports,\nland reclamation, and other beach activities, as implemented\nin the Iskandar Malaysia development project at Danga Bay\nWaterfront (Rosniza Aznie, Abdul Rahim, Ahmad, Buang, &\nZainol, 2011). Although this gives a good impression in\nterms of economic growth, the drastic changes brought on by\nrapid development can often result in an opposite effect. For\nexample, impacts on coastal communities and their cultures\ncan destroy whole livelihoods. These resources are so crucial\nto developmental activities that the communities would not\nsurvive if the resources were to be destroyed (Dahalan et al.,\nCoastal communities are deeply concerned with the\nadvent of development that has forced them to change and\nadapt within a short time. The effects of development include\ndepopulation and sociodemographic, physical, socioeco-\nnomic, and security threats (Omar et al., 2011). The negative\neffects of coastal development were further confirmed\nthrough findings by Er et al. (2011) in a study made on the\ncoast of Dumai Jakarta, Indonesia. This study shows the\nincrease of adverse impacts on the local community as a\nresult of rapid economic development, which include marine\npollution, deterioration of the livelihoods of fishermen, tour-\nism, and coastal ecology.\nA similar finding was made by Jamaluddin Jahi (2009), in\nwhich he reported loss of habitat, erosion, sedimentation,\nand extinction of natural habitats. These problems destroy\nand affect activities necessary to the daily lives of coastal\ncommunities (Marschiavelli & Niendyawati, 2007; Nur\nHafizah & Aziz, 2010). Community-based experience and\nconfirmation by scientific studies clearly demonstrate that\nthe implementation of coastal development has a great\nimpact on humans due to the fact that oceanic and coastal\nchanges pose more complex problems than many may real-\nize, and can cause a lasting impact on coastal communities.\nCountless problems faced by coastal communities can be\nobserved based on the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework\n(SLA), which was introduced by the U.K. Government's\nDepartment for International Development (DFID). SLA\nsuggests vulnerability observed on three forms, namely,\nshock, seasonality, and trend. The shock is in the form of\nthreats that occur suddenly, and the seasonality is a threat\nthat occurs at certain seasons. Meanwhile the trend is phe-\nnomenon-based, it is not expected to be prolonged. However,\nthe model was modified slightly to suit the concerns of this\n4 SAGE Open\nstudy, which relate to the accessibility of community capital\nrelated to natural capital of Orang Kuala.\nResearch Method\nThe study was conducted by using a mixed-method, which is\na combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches.\nThe purpose of using this approach was that researchers\ncould obtain as much data as possible. The data obtained not\nonly have high reliability but also are persuasive in showing\nthat the data collected truly reflect the reality of the subjects.\nThis study uses concurrent embedded design. This study\ndesign allows researchers to gather qualitative and quantita-\ntive data in a balanced and simultaneous manner, as gather-\ning all types of data is important (Andrew & Halcomb,\nQuantitative data were collected from 51 household heads\nthat live in Sungai Layau village, Johor. In addition, five\ninformants were chosen for the qualitative approach. The\nselection of 51 household heads as the sample size is based\non the census and not based on the sampling principle. Fifty-\none is the total number of household heads who lived at the\nSungai Layau village. In particular, they are composed of\naged between 41 and 56 years, followed by individuals aged\nThe five informants for the qualitative data collection are\ndetermined based on the principles of data saturation.\nResearchers stopped interviewing the fifth informant as he\ngave sufficient information to achieve the objectives of this\nstudy and the answer is very similar to other informants. The\nselection of the five informants is based on the maximum\nvariation principle that assumed each informant selected has\na different value from the other.\nResearchers used two methods simultaneously, the inter-\nview-based questionnaires and in-depth interviews, based on\nsemi-structured interview protocol. Data collection tech-\nniques applied by the researchers were conducted as follows.\nResearchers asked quantitative questions first, and each item\nin the interview was then interspersed with qualitative ques-\ntions. The disadvantage of this technique is that it takes a\nlong time, at an average of 2 hr for one-on-one respondents\nof the study.\nQuantitative data were analyzed using SPSS software,\nusing descriptive statistics only. Data were displayed as a\npercentage of each item in the questionnaire. The qualitative\ndata were coordinated and analyzed using QSR NVivo soft-\nware. Data were analyzed using basic qualitative data analy-\nsis techniques, namely, open coding, clustering, categorizing,\nand thematic method. The presentation of the results alter-\nnates between quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative\ndata are presented first, followed by qualitative data, which\nare presented based on descriptive techniques.\nFindings and Discussion\nAccessibility of Resources From the Sea\nTable 1 presents data on the accessibility of marine resources.\nWith respect to the accessibility of food resources from the\nsea, most of the respondents (80.4%) stated that there are still\na lot of state resources and as much as 84.3% stated that these\nresources are easily accessible. This point is illustrated by the\ninformants who stated that food sources in the form of fish,\ncrabs, and other foods are still plentiful. Although they\nacknowledge that the sea is no longer as abundant as before,\nthe quantity obtained is sufficient to sustain daily life. In fact,\nthe excess still allows them to use it for their businesses.\nSimilarly, for the question of accessibility of relevant sources,\ninformants said that they are still readily available. This fact\nis manifested in the statement of Informant C: \"There is a\nnormal range. Em, but if you want to appeal once, not multi-\nply. But enough to sell shall be.\"\nWith respect to medical resources from the sea, only\n19.6% of the respondents expressed that they are at a high\nquantity and easily available. With apprehension to this mat-\nter, informants expressed some confusion concerning the\nmedical resources. According to the informants, not many\nmarine resources can be a source of medicine. This is because\nmedicinal use of marine resources is not something that has\nbeen practiced by the Orang Kuala. Moreover, their lives\nnow have changed and they have started to leave the tradi-\ntional life and follow a modern lifestyle. This includes the\nuse of modern medical practices:\nTable 1. Accessibility of Resources From the Sea.\nQuantity Accessibility\nStatement Many Easy to get Qualitative summary\nFood resources from the sea 80.4 84.3 Readily available in a normal range\nMedical resources from the sea 19.6 19.6 Leave the traditional life and follow a modern lifestyle\nMarine resources for commercial use 96.1 94.1 Settled near the sea get and high demand for sea\nproducts\nRecreational resources of the sea/beach 96.1 96.1 Capacity to boost the local economic activity\nNon-economic resources of the sea 19.6 19.6 Difficulty adapting to non-sea environments\nAmir Zal et al. 5\nI ever hear the sea cucumber. But I did not know much Orang\nKuala here know how to use it. But Orang Kuala there used to\nknow. Orang Kuala now would no longer know. If you ask other\nboys they would not know. (Informant D)\nRespondents were also asked about the use of marine\nresources for commercialization or for economic activities.\nMost respondents (96.1%) stated that marine resources for\neconomic activities are still plenty. Even as much as 94.1%\nof the respondents stated that these resources are easily avail-\nable. Although not all respondents use fishing activities as\ntheir primary source of income, they stated that the use of\nmarine resources for commercial purposes is still able to pro-\nvide income to them. They get high demand for sea products\nin foreign markets. This situation also puts informants in a\nbetter position because resources are easy to find. They set-\ntled near the sea, and that enabled them to access marine\nresources at any time. \"That's easy, near the sea. Chinese and\nMalay were waiting for fish. Just open our eyes, already saw\nthe fish. Hahaha\" (Informant A).\nIn addition, the question of the use of marine resources for\ncommercial and recreational purposes also indicates that\nthey are still plenty, with 96.1% of the respondents indicating\nthat the resources are abundantly and readily available. For\nthe informants, every sea or beach environment can be har-\nnessed for recreational activities such as swimming, picnick-\ning, and boat racing. Informants believe that the marine\nresources in the form of sandy beaches and calm seas can not\nonly serve as a resource for recreation but can also boost the\nlocal economic activity. However, the informants and villag-\ners have not commenced such activities seriously. The reality\nis shared by Informant B:\nI (see) a chance. Look, beautiful place. It is Orang Kuala like to\ncome. But this has not landed all of us, so who wants to go can\ngo. The son can swim, boat was going ok. You can come to the\nsea with your family. But we do not know how to focus on\ntourism activities.\nOn the other hand, the non-marine sources are few and\nhard to come by. This is due to the fact that Orang Kuala are\nthe Sea Orang Kuala and they are not skilled enough to\nexplore the opportunities of non-sea-based resources.\nInstead, they focus on marine resources only. Although the\nOrang Kuala increasingly leave traditional activities such as\nfishing, they are less able to exploit other natural resources,\nparticularly forest or land resources. These limitations give\nthem the inability to make full use of parts of their environ-\nment that have nothing to do with the sea. Reality shows that\nthe respondent had difficulty adapting to non-sea environ-\nments. See the statement represented by Informant D:\nNormally, all changed. We also want to change, but it takes time.\nBefore, everything we did in a boat . . . Eating, sleeping,\nmarriage on a boat. The sea is very important to us. But when\n(locate in) land, gotta live by the sea too. Changing other work\nthere, but have to working with other Orang Kuala.\nIn conclusion, the Orang Kuala's marine resources are\nstill plentiful and easy to obtain. This situation can be an\nopportunity for local communities to utilize marine\nresources for community development activities. In addi-\ntion, the availability of resources to the community bestows\non them the strength to make changes as suggested by Boyd\net al. (2008). The studies from Amir Zal, Redzuan, et al.\n(2012) show that the ownership of community capitals\nenables economic empowerment. Community development\ncould occur because local communities find it easier to take\nadvantage of community resources that they have been\nfamiliar with for a long time. However, community devel-\nopment will be hindered if the community is satisfied with\nits current level of community resources without consider-\ning the potential for increased capacity of the resource. This\npoint of view aligns with Brennan and Barnett's (2009)\nsuggestion that community development occurs when com-\nmunity members build a community capacity for existing\nresources.\nThe Threats to the Orang Kuala\nReferring to Table 2, this study shows that there are three\ntypes of threats faced by the respondents: trends, shocks, and\nseasonal changes. The trends refer to changes that are\nassumed to occur in accordance with the progress of society\nand modernization. In the context of this study, the trends\nobserved seemed to negatively affect the lives of the Orang\nKuala. A shock refers to a sudden change in contrast to com-\nmon expectations and is not expected to occur in the com-\nmunity. The seasonal changes were defined as the events that\ncannot be controlled, such as temperature, monsoon circula-\ntion, and so on.\nThe trends. The greatest threats faced by the respondents are\nchanges in the cost of living and social problems, respond\n92.2% of the participants. These threats include inflation of\nthe prices of essential goods. The interviews with infor-\nmants reveal similar and consistent responses, for example,\nthe following statement by Informant E: \"Hard, very hard . .\n. We don't have much money. But, goods price go up as\nwell. More expensive. The day before are not like this, for\nfifty dollars a lot of goods can buy. Now can be gone an\nhour.\"\nThe same is stated by Informant A on the trends in social\nproblems, such as substance abuse and addictions to alcohol,\ndrugs, gambling, and prostitution. These social problems dis-\nturb informants, despite the lack of their serious prevalence\nin Orang Kuala communities. The informant displays con-\ncern that a social problem has emerged in Orang Kuala com-\nmunities although it is still manageable:\nI do not want to accuse anyone, but this thing happened. Shame\nalso wants to tell Mr. This is cause by the Orang Kuala from\noutside. Make friends with them, we get their disease. We worry\nabout our children, but older Orang Kuala there too. Hehehe.\n6 SAGE Open\nThe other major threat is climate change, which 74.5% of\nthe respondents had faced. This trend relating to climate\nchange had been affecting fishing activities. This is not an\nobvious trend, but the change has been noticed by the Orang\nKuala. This is explained by informant C: \"Yes, there is. But\nnot changed much . . . Yes, I noticed. How did . . . come\nincreasingly strong wind, storm, big waves can suddenly\ncome. But not tsunami. Hahaha.\"\nHowever, the informant could not say precisely whether\nchanges that can be attributed to climate change have often\nbeen discussed in mainstream society or not. Nevertheless,\nthey realize that climate change has occurred by comparing\npresent sea conditions with previous sea conditions.\nWith respect to a change in the form of governance, only\n56.9% of the respondents said that such an event occurred.\nThe informants who stated that the event occurred detailed a\ndescription as follows:\nTo say it changed? The usual console . . . every leader sees other\nthings. Here also same. But (change) has he brought, must we\nnot feel comfortable. We support good, if not we will be angry.\nThere is little bad, but our Orang Kuala must be angry, he scared\ntoo. (Informant D)\nThe statements from Informant D shows that any leader-\nship conflict in their community is under control and can be\ntempered with a communal spirit. Although they realize that\nthere is a conflict due to changes in governance or leadership\nin the community, they still feel a sense of belonging as the\nOrang Kuala prioritize community in such circumstances.\nTherefore, they do not consider a change in leadership threat-\nening to their communities.\nIn addition, only 49% of the respondents said that the\ndevelopment of technological change threatens their lives.\nThe informants stated that the development of technology is\nnot something that threatens their lives but a phenomenon\nthat can inspire them to live a better and more equal life up to\nmainstream society's standards. In fact, they look to the\ndevelopment of technology to help them get out of a range of\nproblems, such as the issue of poverty and the negative ste-\nreotypes imposed by society onto them:\nWe are as Orang Asli . . . The outsiders thought we're backward,\nwear loincloth. We never wear loincloth. Hehehe. If developed,\nlike some new tools, like going to the sea, with the boat engine,\nmake easy we to find the fish. Fast, no need to paddle . . . Our\nlives so look like a plague, like the Malays too. So, be looking to\neat more. Can have a car, house can be good. So, the other Orang\nKuala are not saying us as Orang Asli anymore. (Informant E)\nThe tone of the informant's statement reflects his valua-\ntion of development. The informants do not see technologi-\ncal development as a threat but as something that can\nmotivate them to keep pace with development. As for the use\nof technology, it is not alienating to the Orang Kuala, who\nwelcome it because it helps them to change and facilitate\ntheir lives.\nIn conclusion, there were three major trends threatening\nthe Orang Kuala, that is, the rising cost of living, social\nissues, and climate change. Of the three trends, only social\nproblems can be controlled by the Orang Kuala. The two\nother threats, which are the increasing cost of living and cli-\nmate change, cannot be controlled by the Orang Kuala. A\nthreat that cannot be controlled by humans has\nTable 2.

(2006), that is, the threat\nof seasonal changes. This threat is a common threat faced by\ncoastal communities. Coastal communities insist on making\nany changes that they need to prepare for climate change.\nThis has to do with the Orang Kuala's view on development.\nThey do not consider development and technological change\nas threats but as aids to help them to join the mainstream\nsociety's development. This is because the development on\nthe coast is having a positive impact on the community in\nterms of promoting the growth of activity (Rosniza Aznie et\nThe shocks.The shock faced by 51% of the respondents is\nsome form of epidemic disease. This percentage is not high\nbecause very few cases of plague existed among the Orang\nKuala. This example is described by Informant B: \"That's\ndisease is, like hives, stomach pain. Ha, abdominal pain first\nis our Orang Kuala were upset stomach. I do not know to\nwhat epidemic. But many are ill. But do not be cause for\ndeath.\"\nOnly 35.3% of the respondents considered an economic\ncrisis that causes cessation of work as a different kind of\nthreat, and 13.7% of the respondents considered natural\ndisasters such as hurricanes a threat. If an economic crisis\nhappened, the Orang Kuala do not feel worried because they\nhave other sources of income, such as working as fishermen.\nHowever, they still feel worried if the economic crisis affects\ntheir ability to repay debts monthly: \"Never be afraid because\nof economic crisis, we can work the sea (fishing). Fish are\nalso a lot . . . but if thinking the car debt, makes head pain\"\n(Informant C).\nWith regard to the forms of the natural disaster shocks\nsuch as hurricanes, informants did not express much con-\ncern. This is because they are familiar with these natural\ndisasters and accept them as normative of life as the Sea\nPeople. They also noted that natural disasters do not always\nhappen and do not interfere with the routine of their lives.\nThe following example is mentioned by Informant A:\nEm, when it comes (the storm), that normal for strong wind.\nLive by the sea, was normal. If feel fear is not the Sea Orang\nKualas. Shame. Hehehe. If come too (storm), we are not difficult\nit is, just sometimes.\nIn conclusion, the shocks do not comprise a threat to the\nOrang Kuala. This is because the form of the threats affect-\ning them is familiar to the Orang Kuala. For example, in the\nevent of an economic crisis, they possess knowledge and\nskills related to the sea to secure economic resources if they\nneed to deal with economic problems. Natural disasters that\noccur in coastal areas are also not seen as a threat but are\naccepted as a matter that must be faced by those living on the\ncoast.\nReality is different from the views of Elfindri et al. (2005,\ncited in Noviarti, Jahi, & Nor, 2011), who state that the\nproblems of a particular season, including natural disasters,\npose a threat to coastal communities. In the case of the Orang\nKuala, their lives in the marine environment (Amir Zal,\naccept the difficulties as the Sea Orang Kualas. They do not\nperceive those events as a threat but accept them as part of\ntheir lives. Therefore, their views on sea events are different\nfrom those of other communities.\nThe seasons change. The decline of marine resources due to\nthe change of seasons is the greatest threat reported by the\nrespondents (74.5%). The threat posed by the change of sea-\nsons was indicated by the informant to refer to the state of the\ntides. In all, 72.5% the respondents also said that they per-\nceived threats related to the occupation with the uncertainty\nof the seasons. Both of these types of threat are intercon-\nnected with each other. Based on Orang Kuala experience,\neach state of the sea enables them to obtain a different type\nof marine resource. For example, at low tide, they may be\nable to get resources such as pumpun, sea worms, crabs, and\nothers. In such a circumstance, fish totals are declining.\nWhen there are high tides, it is easy to acquire fish. However,\nin the event of a storm or rough seas, marine products are\nreduced: \"Depend on a situation, if we can find the low-\nwater other things, crabs there too. But if the tide, many fish\nwe got. Storm? Fish to escape. Hahaha\" (Informant A).\nConcern for the threat of fluctuating prices (quantity of\nproducts in the seasons) was displayed by 62.7% of the\nrespondents, and concern for market volatility with the sea-\nsons was displayed by 51% of the respondents. Informants\ndescribed the threat of market uncertainty with regard to the\nseasons as making it problematic to acquire certain resources\nsuch as fish to meet market demand. This results in price\nincreases. However, typically high prices are not caused by\nthe Orang Kuala, but are associated with the exploitative\nbehavior of middlemen who manipulate seasonal\nconditions:\nOf course, if the storm, even fish can suck. We want to earn\nmoney, look for the fish also available. The price is high. We go\nup a bit. But many middlemen up (price). Pity also the Orang\nKuala who want to buy. But they already know the season\nbarring the unlikely even fish prices. (Informant C)\nThe seasons change, and the resultant decline in marine\nresources and uncertain employment are the highest forms of\nthreat faced by the respondents. All forms of threat associ-\nated with nature are beyond the control of the Orang Kuala.\nIn the case of a natural disaster, although it is a threat beyond\ntheir control, the Orang Kuala possess the knowledge and\nskill to weather the event. However, the questionnaire indi-\ncates a different attitude toward seasonal changes. The Orang\nKuala feel a lack of control due to changing elements that\npose a threat in each season. Both of these findings are incon-\nsistent. It has been demonstrated that seasonal variation\n8 SAGE Open\nposes a threat that results in socioeconomic changes. This\nview is consistent with the view of Pakpahan et al. (2006),\nwho state that this problem occurs when connected with eco-\nnomic interests.\nConclusion, Impact, and\nRecommendations\nOverall, community resources in the form of marine\nresources can still be obtained by the Orang Kuala. This\nallows them to continue life as usual. This reality can encour-\nage the Orang Kuala to use the community resources as the\nbasis for the development of their communities. This\napproach is consistent with the essence of community\ndevelopment.\nThe types of threats faced by the community are trends,\nshocks, and seasonal change. The study concluded that the\ntypes of threats that occur are related to events that cannot be\ncontrolled by the Orang Kuala. This includes the side effects\nof the threats, such as social problems caused by economic\nproblems and indirect contact with other societies. However,\nthe forms of community development need to be considered\na possible threat in terms of a reduction in the opportunity to\ntake advantage of community resources, which include eco-\nnomic, social, and political benefits. These resources should\nbe tapped for community development purposes. This means\nthat the forms of threat occur when an event reduces the\nresources and opportunities to access community resources.\nAs summary, the most significant threat to the Orang Kuala\nis the trend, consisting of the cost of living and social prob-\nlems. This situation can be labeled as a vulnerable commu-\nnity of capitals. However, in the context of the Orang Kuala,\nthe problem is not of their choosing. It occurs beyond their\ncontrol.\nThus, the Orang Kuala can choose to not depend solely on\nexisting community resources. This does not mean that they\nhave to stop using existing community resources. This action\nis not in accordance with the ABCD approach. Instead, they\ncan increase the capacity of their community resources. The\nOrang Kuala can take a lesson from Loza (2004), who states\nhow community capacity building is significant. This results\nin an increase in the economic power of the community.\nEven the act of increasing the capacity of the resources can\npromote the occurrence of sustainable development. This\nThis effort is not difficult because there are findings\nshowing the ability of the Orang Kuala to accept the changes\nnecessary. For example, they do not consider technology a\nthreat but believe that new technology helps them to adapt\nand overcome the negative stereotypes that have been\nimposed on them by mainstream society. This article sug-\ngests that the Orang Kuala could be supplied with new\nhuman capital (knowledge and skills), whether by increasing\nthe capacity of existing human capital or by adding a differ-\nent human capital. This proposal is based on the reality that\nlife-threatening changes in coastal communities are a matter\nthat cannot be avoided because it is not under the control of\nthe Orang Kuala.\nThe action is, however, more effective when there is a\nconsistent effort from the government. Through policies and\nprograms, the government can encourage Orang Kuala to\nraise existing community capitals, for example, by introduc-\ning Orang Kuala specific courses and encouraging them to\njoin the same to improve the capacity of their community\ncapitals. In this way, they not only preserve their identity as\nthe Sea People but also strengthen their economy with the\neconomic remuneration. These efforts can produce a social\ninnovation among Orang Kuala. As for a long-term recom-\nmendation, the efforts to develop OrangAsli potential should\nbe evaluated based on the specific context, which is based on\na different ethnic background. Each Orang Asli is living in\ndifferent environments and has specific identity. This reality\npaved specific threat and need to be addressed based on the\nspecificity of the Orang Asli background.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe researchers thanked the Ministry of Higher Education as\nresearch grants were channeled to undertake this study through the\nLong Term Research Grant Scheme (LRGS)\nReferences\nAmir Zal, W.
