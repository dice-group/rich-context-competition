The\nstatement says that MetS can be diagnosed\nwith a body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m2\nwith any two of the following:1,2 (i) raised\nl), or specific treatment for this lipid abnor-\nmality; (ii) reduced HDL-C <40 mg/dl\n(<1.29 mmol/l) in females, or specific treat-\nment for this lipid abnormality; (iii) raised\nblood pressure: systolic blood pressure >\nor treatment of previously diagnosed hyper-\ntension; (iv) raised fasting plasma\nor previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes\n(>5.6 mmol/l), an oral glucose tolerance test\nis strongly recommended, but is not neces-\nsary to confirm the presence of MetS.2 If\nBMI is >30 kg/m2, central obesity can be\nassumed and waist circumference does not\nneed to be measured.2\nThe global epidemic of obesity and\nT2DM has resulted in an increasing\nnumber of patients suffering from MetS.3\nThis is of particular concern because of the\nclose association between MetS and cardio-\nvascular disease (CVD).4 There is also\ngrowing evidence that MetS might be asso-\nciated with male sexual dysfunction.5 With\nthis growing understanding of the close\nassociations between various pathological\nstates, T2DM, CVD, obesity, erectile dys-\nfunction and hypogonadism are no longer\nregarded as separate diseases in elderly\nmen.6 However, the relationship between\nMetS, erectile dysfunction and hypogonad-\nism remains unclear and needs to be further\nelucidated.7 The aims of this study were to\nevaluate the prevalence of erectile dysfunc-\ntion among patients with T2DM and/or\nMetS, and to evaluate the relationship\nbetween the components of MetS and male\nsexual dysfunction.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis prospective study enrolled consecutive\nmale patients with confirmed T2DM\nin the Department of Urology, The First\nAffiliated Hospital, School of Medicine,\nXi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi\nProvince, China. T2DM was diagnosed\naccording to the American Diabetes\nAssociation as follows:8 FPG ! 7.0 mmol/l,\nrandom blood sugar !11.1 mmol/l or glu-\ncose !11.1 mmol/l 2 h after an oral glucose\ntolerance test. All of the patients had normal\nthinking ability, were able to express inde-\npendent judgement and answer questions,\nand were willing to co-operate with the\ninvestigation. The inclusion criterion\nwas the confirmed diagnosis of T2DM,\nwhile the exclusion criteria were as fol-\nlows: presence of psychological disorders;\nhyperprolactinaemia; primary hypogonad-\nism; pituitary tumours; bilateral/unilateral\ncryptorchidism; testicular inflammation;\nsevere anaemia; prostate cancer; genital\nmalformations; spinal cord injury; genitour-\ninary surgery; dysplasia; thyroid disease;\nendocrine disorders (e.g. hyperthyroidism,\nsystemic lupus erythematosus); connective\ntissue disease; cancer; blood diseases; severe\nperipheral vascular disease; poor peripheral\nperfusion; severe liver or kidney dysfunc-\ntion; and other organic diseases.\nEthical approval for the study was pro-\nvided by the Ethics Committee of Xi'an\nparticipants provided written informed con-\nsent and all were given free access to the\nstudy results.\nInvestigational methods\nThe sample size and power were not pre-\ndetermined before the study commenced as\nit was a prospective study with a set time\nperiod. Two questionnaires, a general ques-\ntionnaire and a sexual function question-\nnaire, were distributed to patients with\nT2DM who attended the hospital for a\nroutine outpatient check-up. The general\nquestionnaire asked questions regarding\nage, occupation, residence, marital status,\neducational status, family monthly income,\nlifestyle, level of education, smoking status,\nalcohol drinking status, exercise, and disease\nhistory (hypertension [controlled by medi-\ncation], T2DM and hyperlipidaemia, coron-\nary heart disease, arrhythmia, peripheral\nvascular disease and brain vascular disease).\nPatients answered questions regarding the\ncurrent status (normal or abnormal) of their\nmetabolic parameters, including blood cell\ncounts, myocardial enzyme levels, blood\nglucose concentration, blood lipid levels,\nliver function test results, and renal function\ntest results, which were later tested and\nconfirmed at the hospital. Whilst at the\nhospital, the patients also had the following\nparameters measured: blood pressure,\nheight, weight, waist circumference and hip\ncircumference.\nThe sexual function questionnaire con-\nsisted of two parts: (i) patients who had not\nhad sexual intercourse within the past\n6 months needed to answer about the time\nspan without sexual intercourse, night-time\nor early-morning erections, and the reasons\nfor intercourse termination; and (ii) patients\nwho had had sexual intercourse within the\npast 6 months completed the International\nIndex of Erectile Function (IIEF-5).9 The\nIIEF-5 consists of five questions, each\nscored on a five-point ordinal scale (0\u00ad5),\nwhere lower values represent poorer sexual\nfunction. The questions address five areas\nrelated to the patient's ability to achieve\nand maintain an erection that resulted in\nsatisfactory intercourse over the previous\n6 months. The possible scores for the IIEF-5\nrange from 1 to 25 (one question has scores\nof 1\u00ad5). Patients with a score of !22 were\nconsidered to have normal erectile function\nand subjects with a score of <22 were\nconsidered to have erectile dysfunction\n( 7 \u00bc severe erectile dysfunction; 8\u00ad11 \u00bc\n21 \u00bc mild). Patients completed the IIEF-5\nquestionnaire themselves under the supervi-\nsion of trained medical staff. All question-\nnaires were then collected from the patients\nby the medical staff.\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nthe SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version 13.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. A univariate logistic regression\nanalysis of data from the entire survey\npopulation was undertaken on the study\nparameters after having selected potential\nrisk factors based on the published literature\nand research. Multivariate logistic regres-\nsion analysis of data from the entire survey\npopulation was then undertaken on the\nparameters that were either statistically sig-\nnificant in the univariate logistic regression\nanalysis or on parameters that might have\nsome expected association with erectile dys-\nfunction in order to determine the risk\nfactors for erectile dysfunction. The results\nare expressed as odds ratio and 95% confi-\ndence interval. A P-value <0.05 was con-\nsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nA total of 186 questionnaires were distrib-\nuted to male patients with T2DM attending\nthe hospital for a routine check-up. From\nthese men, the medical staff collected 175\nwere incomplete; therefore, they were not\nincluded in the study).

The lower\nthe income, the higher the prevalence of\nerectile dysfunction.\nUnivariate logistic regression analysis of\ndata from the entire survey population\nshowed that the levels of physical activity\nwere significantly correlated with prevalence\nThe lower the level of physical activity, the\nhigher the prevalence of erectile dysfunction.\nUnivariate logistic regression analysis of\ndata from the entire survey population also\nshowed that blood pressure was significantly\ncorrelated with prevalence of erectile dys-\nblood pressure, the higher the prevalence of\nerectile dysfunction. The remaining factors\nsuch as educational status, smoking status,\nalcohol drinking status, waist circumference,\nhip circumference and weight were not\nassociated with risk of erectile dysfunction.\nMultiple potential risk factors for erectile\ndysfunction in male patients with T2DM\nand/or MetS were used in a multivariate\nlogistic regression analysis of data from the\nentire survey population. The results\nshowed that there were three risk factors\nfor erectile dysfunction: age, blood pressure\nand duration of diabetes (Table 2).\nDiscussion\nMetabolic syndrome has become a global\npublic health problem.3 The initial clinical\ninterest in this syndrome was due to its\nassociation with CVD and the growing\nepidemic of T2DM throughout the\nworld.10 There is a high degree of overlap\nbetween the cause of erectile dysfunction\nand CVD.11 With the global epidemic of\nobesity and T2DM, research has demon-\nstrated that MetS has a secondary associ-\nation with male sexual dysfunction and that\nerectile dysfunction is significantly asso-\nciated with MetS.12 Several studies have\nevaluated the relationship between sexual\ndysfunction and prevalence of MetS. In a\nstudy of 236 male patients with MetS,\nof libido, 22.7% premature ejaculation and\n4.8% ejaculation delay.13 The phenomenon\nof gonadal dysfunction was more common\nin patients with MetS compared with\nhealthy individuals.12 In another study, of\nMetS was independently associated with a\ndecreased IIEF-5 score.14 It is worth noting\nthat this study also showed that there was a\nhigher proportion of moderate-to-severe\nerectile dysfunction in older men (!50\nyears) with MetS compared with younger\nmen (<50 years) without MetS.14 A further\nwith erectile dysfunction demonstrated that\nMetS was significantly correlated with inci-\ndence of moderate-to-severe ED,15 while\nDemir et al. showed that a decrease in the\nerectile dysfunction symptom score was\nsignificantly correlated with an increase in\nthe number of metabolic risk factors.16 The\nMassachusetts Male Aging Study further\nconfirmed that the presence of MetS was still\nassociated with an increased risk of erectile\ndysfunction even in a population whose\nThe results of this present study showed\nthat increasing age was significantly asso-\nciated with an increase in prevalence of\nerectile dysfunction. Univariate and multi-\nvariate logistic regression analyses demon-\nstrated that age, duration of T2DM, TG\nlevels, blood pressure, monthly income and\nphysical activity were risk factors for erectile\ndysfunction in patients with T2DM and/or\nMetS. These current findings suggest that\nMetS and its components have a negative\nimpact on male erectile function, and the\nrelationship between the duration of T2DM\nwas particularly significant with erectile\ndysfunction. This study was limited by the\nfact that the sample size and power were not\npredetermined before the start.\nIn conclusion, these current findings sug-\ngest that patients with erectile dysfunction\nshould be carefully examined to see if they\nhave T2DM and/or MetS. Conversely, when\nmanaging male patients with T2DM and/or\nMetS, medical staff should be aware of the\npotential impact that these diseases have on\nsexual function and they should actively\nenquire about the patient's experience of\nerectile dysfunction.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
