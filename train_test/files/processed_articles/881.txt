Despite the intuitive appeal of this argument, both the\nnature and prevalence of competing generational claims in\nmid-life remain open questions several decades after the\nnotion first surfaced (Uhlenberg, 1993). Elsewhere in this\nissue, Rosenthal, Martin-Matthews, and Matthews (1996)\nuse Canadian survey data to contribute new estimates of how\nmany middle-aged adults balance potential filial duties with\ncompeting social roles.\nHow common are three-generation families in which the\ndependencies of the youngest and oldest kin vie for the\nresources of the middle generation? At the most basic level\nthis is a question of population structure, a fundamental\nconcern of demographers. In the aggregate, the relative\nsupport burden on middle-aged persons (defined as broadly\ncrudely measured by various dependency ratios. Estimates\nare regularly published for the total dependency ratio (the\nsum of \"youth\" and \"elderly\" support ratios) and, even\nrecently, a \"sandwich generation\" ratio (U.S. Bureau of the\nCensus, 1996). Because such calculations do not represent\nactual family linkages, these ratios represent per capita\nburden under the assumption that all middle-aged persons in\na population contribute equal effort to support young and\nold, even those without children or living parents.\nMore realistic estimates of the generational structure of\nfamilies can be derived from simulation models. Multi-state\nlife table models, for example, allow demographers to esti-\nmate the number of person-years a cohort survives with both\nold parents and children given a regime of nuptuality,\nfertility, and mortality risks. Watkins, Menken, and Bon-\ngaarts (1987) use such a macro-simulation model to show\nthat the demographic conditions which prevailed in 1980\ntipped the generational \"seesaw\" in favor of living longer\nwith parents aged 65 and over than with children under age\n18. On average, only five years were lived having both an\nolder parent and a minor child, only slightly more than the\noverlap years under the 1900 schedule of rates. Micro-\nsimulation models, such as SOCSIM described by Himmel,\n1994), generate even more refined representations of family\ntrees in historical and projected time.\nUntil recently demographic methods were required to\nestimate the simple prevalence of three-generation families\nNational Survey of Families and Households (NSFH), and\noutside the respondent's household are available to describe\nthe generational structure of mid-life families. Because fam-\nily information is reported for spouses/partners if married,\nthese data more fully describe the cross-pressures potentially\nbuffeting mid-life families.\nFigure 1 displays the distribution of family structures by\nage for a mid-life reference population using data from\nparents or in-laws but no children and about one in five have\nchildren but no parents or parents-in-law. By far, the most\ncommon family structure at ages 50--54 is the family con-\ntaining at least three generations. Nearly 74 percent in this\nage group have one or more living parents (or in-laws) and\none or more children (or stepchildren). The prevalence of\nfour-generation families (parents, children, grandchildren,\nand the mid-life reference generation) is shown with a dotted\nline to indicate that this type of family is a special case of\nfamilies with three or more generations. The prevalence of\nyears after the peak in the prevalence of families with at least\nthree generations.\nUnlike the Canadian data of Rosenthal, Martin-Matthews,\nand Matthews (1996), the estimates shown in Figure 1 sum-\nmarize potential obligations to parents and in-laws and chil-\ndren and grandchildren. Several important features of con-\ntemporary family structure are obvious in these data. First,\nmembership in a three-generation family containing older\nparents and children is modal for middle-aged adults up to age\n60. Four-generation families also are fairly common for those\nin their forties and fifties. Second, with a mean age of child-\nthe generational overlap occurs at a point when both the\nelderly parents and offspring of middle-aged adults are likely\nto need care. Rather, the timing of parent care is more likely\nto coincide with the launching of young adult children.\no -\n& Parents + Children N,^\nC3 or more Generations) \\\nParents, Children, +\nGrandchildren ,\u00bb -- \"\n(4 Generations) /\n/ /\n\\ ^ /' yS\n^ ^ - ^ ^ - -- ~ --\nf Only Children\n\\ /\nOnly Parents ^ ^ - ^\nAge\nFigure 1.

Source: Weighted\ndata from the 1992-94 National Survey of Families and Households.\nThird, at a point in the life cycle of middle-aged adult\nchildren when elderly parents or in-laws are at greatest risk\nfor frailty (typically after age 75), the generation in the\nmiddle is more likely to be juggling care commitments to\ngrandchildren than to their own very young children.\nStructural data alone neither prove nor dispel the image of\nmiddle-aged adults caught in a web of generational obliga-\ntions. Within the constraints of a given family structure,\nactual helping behaviors must be examined. But because the\nissue of mid-life family demands originally emerged in the\nliterature on parental caregiving, often only actual hands-on\nassistance is considered in analyses of competing obligations\nto kin at various ages. While future research needs to\nintegrate care involvement with grandchildren and in-laws,\nfar more important may be models which account for all\npossible intergenerational exchanges. Locating kin obliga-\ntions in such a matrix has important analytic advantages. The\ncurrencies of intergenerational exchanges include not only\ntime (or services), but also money and space (co-residence).\nContingent on service availability, financial transfers can\nsubstitute for labor-intensive care either for young children\nor for frail parents. Financial assistance can take many\nforms, including irregular but substantial transfers to help\nwith medical bills, the down payment on a first home,\ncollege tuition, or living expenses during spells of unem-\nployment or times of marital transition (after widowhood of\na parent or divorce of a child). On occasion, payments may\nby-pass the older parent or offspring and go directly to the\nprovider of services.\nRosenthal, Martin-Matthews, and Matthews (1996) and\nother researchers report a very low incidence of financial\ntransfers to older parents. Indeed, elderly parents appear far\nmore likely to give financial help to children and grandchil-\ndren than to receive it (Soldo and Hill, 1993). But the low\nprevalence of financial help for parents and reverse flows\nmay mask competing family pressures on both the short- and\nlong-term resources of middle-aged adults in extended fami-\nlies. Financial responsibility for college tuition may encour-\nage work or sustain the commitment to work longer than\nwould otherwise be the case. Alternatively, providing labor-\nintensive care for dependent parents or grandchildren may\ndiscourage work, especially for women. Under either sce-\nnario, intergenerational transfers have distinct implications\nfor pension eligibility, saving, asset accumulation, and ulti-\nmately post-retirement incomes (Soldo and Hill, 1995).\nThese broader aspects of competing generational claims on\nthe resources of the middle-aged are often overlooked in\nmodels which fail to recognize that care obligations --\nwhether to children, grandchildren, or parents -- are endog-\nenous with labor supply decisions (i.e., care and work\ndecisions are jointly determined).\nLocating parent care obligations in a broader array of\nintergenerational exchanges also calls attention to potential\nhelper substitutions within the extended family. Most\nmiddle-aged children with elderly parents have one or more\nsiblings with whom to share filial responsibilities (Wolf,\n1994). Parents and most, if not all, children are likely to be\ninvolved in deciding how to assemble a care network.\nAnalyzing the transfer behaviors and constraints of only one\nmid-life child in a family underestimates the flow of re-\nsources to an older parent and the sheer volume of competing\ndemands on adult children. Neither can such analyses pro-\nvide insights into the division of labor within a family or the\ndistribution of burden across mid-life adults linked by blood\nor marriage.\nExtensive data are required to fully account for competing\nclaims on the financial and time resources of middle-aged\nadults and the correlation of their transfer behaviors with\nwork. The new Health and Retirement Study (HRS), de-\nscribed by Juster and Suzman (1995), provides many of the\nneeded data elements for a large representative sample of\ntional obligations peak, detailed family roster data are avail-\nable on children, parents, and siblings for both spouses/\npartners in the case of couples. More importantly, each\nmention of an intergenerational transfer is linked to the spe-\ncific relative who receives or provides the transfer. It is\npossible, for example, to describe a parent care system in\nterms of the hours and dollars contributed by each child, in the\ncontext of each one's own competing family constraints and\nwork behaviors (Soldo and Hill, 1995). Because family ros-\nters and transfers are updated at each biennial interview, dy-\nnamic models of generational competition also are possible.\nThe image of middle-aged adults balancing parent care\nduties with child care duties is clearly an inappropriate\nrendering of mid-life. A fuller account of cross pressures at\nmid-life requires data and analyses which recognize alterna-\ntive transfer currencies, siblings as potential substitute help-\ners, and obligations to both own kin and kin by marriage.\nBecause there is a natural life-cycle rhythm to giving and\nreceiving transfers, panel data are needed to evaluate how\nreciprocities (either bequests from parents or assistance later\nin life from own children) offset the sheer volume of claims\non mid-life resources.\n"
