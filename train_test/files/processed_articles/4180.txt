    "abstract": "Abstract. In distinguishing individual shapes (defined by their contours), older children (6.5 years of\nage on average) performed better than younger children (4 years of age on average), and, although\nthe task did not involve any categorization or generalization, the error pattern was qualitatively\naffected by shape differences that are generally common distinctions between objects belonging\nto different categories. The influence of these shape differences was also observed for unfamiliar\nshapes, demonstrating that the influence of categorization experience was not modulated by the\nretrieval of shape features from known categories but rather related to a different perception of\nshape by age. The results suggest a direct influence of categorization experience on more abstract\nshape processing. When children were distinguishing shapes, new words were paired with the target\nshapes, and in 2 additional tasks, the acquired name\u00adshape associations were tested. The younger\nage group was able to remember more words correctly.\n",

In this respect, shape reflects something about the developmental and evolu-\ntionary history of kinds. For artificial kinds, shape is often a necessary condition to fulfil a particular\nneed, and small shape differences frequently reflect functional optimization. Therefore, children's re-\nliance on shape in the formation of new natural and artificial categories is probably an essential pre-\ndisposition. Indeed, many developmental studies have demonstrated its importance in an early stage\nof life (e.g., Gershkoff-Stowe & Smith, 2004; Landau, Smith, & Jones, 1988). Another indication of\nthe importance of shape in categorization is the so-called shape bias, where it has been demonstrated\nthat names are generalized to new objects that preserve the shape properties of a category (Landau\nthe work of Landau et al. (1988), a new word (e.g., \"dax\") was used to refer to a reference object.\nParticipants relied on shape to generalize new words to new instances. However, when reference\nobjects were not labelled but participants were instructed to select new objects that go together with\nthe reference objects, participants seemed to rely less on shape, although still more on shape than on\nnon-shape cues such as texture or size. In sum, participants rely more on shape when words are as-\nsociated with them and it probably indicates that human experience with visual shape perception and\ncategory naming leads to the expectation that names are referring to objects that have similar shapes\n1.1Different kinds of shape similarity\nIn vision research, it is sometimes crucial to control for the influence of category representations\nwhen a perceptual task involves familiar objects. For instance, manmade objects have more straight\nA developmental difference in shape processing and\nword\u00adshape associations between 4 and 6.5 year olds\n*Corresponding author.\ncontour segments in their boundaries than natural kinds. We could hypothesize that it takes longer to\ndistinguish a pair of manmade objects from each other than a manmade object from a natural object\nbecause the manmade objects share more similar boundary segments. However, manmade categories\nand natural kinds are also forming two separate cognitive categories, and cognitive factors could in-\nfluence reaction times too. To exclude a potential influence from prior experience from known cate-\ngories, one could try to create unfamiliar (nonexisting) objects for which no category representations\nexist but that have similar shape characteristics such as, for instance, contours composed of straight\nand curved boundary segments. However, it is difficult to define a set of similar shape characteristics\nbetween familiar and unfamiliar objects, and assumptions about the relevant shape characteristics\nare necessary. Therefore, many developmental studies of shape perception relied on one or another\nspecific theoretical framework of object recognition such as, for instance, Biederman's (1987) \"Rec-\nognition By Components\" or RBC theory (e.g., Abecassis, Sera, Yonas, & Schwade, 2001; Haaf et\nal., 2003; Mash 2006). In RBC theory, object representations consist of structural spatial relations\nbetween volumetric parts called geons. Geons are considered to form the shape primitives of the\nvisual system, and they consist of quasiregular volumetric shapes such as for instance cylinders and\ncuboids. New unfamiliar objects are then created by any arbitrary assemble of geons.\nHere, we introduce changes to category-relevant and -irrelevant shape properties using a pla-\nnar interpolation algorithm developed in the computer vision literature: thin plate splines or TPS\n(Bookstein, 1989; see also Ons & Wagemans, 2011, and the references therein). This tool allows us\nto make specific types of shape changes, which can be applied equally well on familiar and unfamil-\niar shapes, without having to make assumptions about shape primitives or without selecting manu-\nally salient contour points in a morphing algorithm (De Winter & Wagemans, 2008; Newell & B\u00fcl-\nthoff, 2002). More specifically, the TPS algorithm is able to extract a deformation scheme between a\npair of two familiar contours, for instance, two contours from a different category. The deformation\ncan be considered as a technical implementation of coordinate transformations in object recognition\n(Graf, 2006). Once the deformation scheme is determined between a pair of contours, it is possible\nto use the same deformation scheme on a new unfamiliar one, resulting into a second unfamiliar con-\ntour. When the initial transformation scheme is extracted from two contours from different basic-lev-\nel categories, then the unfamiliar contours can be assumed to inherit similar category-relevant shape\ndifferences as they involve the same deformation scheme. Similarly, when the two original contours\nare members of the same basic-level category, then the derived unfamiliar contours from the same\nscheme can be assumed to inherit shape differences that do not imply any category change.\nIn Figure 1, some examples of this procedure are provided. These stimuli are also used in our\nexperiment. In the upper half of Figure 1, there are pairs of contours related to the same and to differ-\nent basic-level categories. The gridlines behind each donkey, dog, bowl, bottle, car, and hat dem-\nonstrate the planar transformations causing the deformation of the upper-left contour (including the\nrectangular grid in the background) into any other contour of the same cluster. Within each cluster,\nthe horizontal contour pairs are members of the same basic-level class, while the vertical pairs are\nmembers of different classes. In the lower half of Figure 1, the same transformations are executed on\nunfamiliar contours (note that the curve paths of the grid lines do not fully correspond because they\nare initially located at slightly different positions in the image plane). Although the lower contours\nare not related to any familiar category, they can be assumed to inherit some within and between\nbasic-level shape differences from the original contour pairs because they underwent the same planar\ntransformations. For more technical details about this procedure, we refer to the Appendix.\nThe advantage of the latter approach is that we do not need to define relevant and irrelevant\nshape features explicitly, and therefore, we can relax the assumptions on the specific features and\nshape primitives involved in category representation, and thus, reduce the dependency of the study\non a particular theory of object recognition.\n1.2The present study\nThe shape bias has mainly been investigated in the context of a name generalization task (e.g., Imai,\ndemonstrates the influence of visual shape on category naming. Here, we intended to study whether\nhuman experience with categories and names also leads to biases in shape perception. Therefore, we\nfocused on two kinds of shape differences: the first kind comprises shape differences that are irrel-\nevant for determining the basic level of category ownership (therefore, in the current study, this con-\nCategory-related shape similarity 483\ndition is labelled \"Irrelevant\"), while the second kind comprises shape differences that are generally\nrelevant for categorization (labelled \"Relevant\"). We investigated the influence of these two kinds of\nshape differences on children's ability to distinguish individual shapes, and we examined children's\npattern of confusion between shapes. Older children are more experienced in abstracting and gener-\nalizing relevant information (Son, Smith, & Goldstone, 2008), therefore, we hypothesized that older\nchildren make proportionally more errors for objects differing in irrelevant properties compared with\nrelevant properties (Ons & Wagemans, 2011). Such an influence of category-dependent shape differ-\nences would be a nontrivial outcome because our task does not require any categorical abstractions\nor generalizations. Each shape was paired with only one individual nonsense name.\nTo introduce a clear difference in the level of prior experience and developmental phase, we\nincluded two distinct age groups: one group consisted of children between 3.1 and 5 years of age\n(4 years on average) and the other group consisted of children between 6 and 7.1 years of age (6.5\nyears on average). Children in this age range are very well able to participate in a computerized\nexperiment, which allows us to gather data in a well-controlled setting, and their vocabulary is still\ngrowing considerably, reflecting probably a great deal of developmental changes in their acquired\ncategory representations.\nIn the experiment, the contour shape (the target) and its corresponding new name (e.g., \"knaai\")\nwere first provided by the computer. Subsequently, the same contour and three other contours (the\ndistracters) were displayed on the monitor screen. The distracters were varying on category-relevant\nand -irrelevant shape properties. The computer asked the children to indicate the target contour\n(called \"knaai\") between the alternatives on a touch screen. We referred to this task as \"perceptual\nidentification.\" The predicted outcome that older children make proportionally more errors for ob-\njects differing in irrelevant properties would suggest that shape perception is influenced by category-\nrelevant processing.\nA second aim of the experiment was to investigate the influence of age on individual name\u00ad\nshape associations. We therefore included two additional tasks in the experiment to test the formed\nword\u00adshape associations (referred to as the \"word comprehension task\" and the \"word production\ntask\"). In the word comprehension task, the name of a shape was provided and the child had to indi-\ncate the correct shape between the alternatives on a touch screen. Conversely, in the word production\ntask, a shape was presented and the child had to recall the correct nonsense name. Although many\nFigure 1. Category-relevant and -irrelevant shape differences, illustrated with the stimuli from the experiment\n(see text for an explanation).\ntheories advocate the predisposition of young children to make word\u00adshape associations (e.g., the\n\"critical period of language acquisition,\" see Lenneberg, 1967; or the \"vocabulary burst\", for an\noverview, see Goldfield & Reznick, 1990), we expected older children to perform better because they\nhave more general cognitive skills to cope with a computerized experiment. The two additional tasks\nprovided remarkable results. Despite an average age difference of 2.5 years and a minimum age dif-\nference of 1 year for each individual from both age groups, we found that both age groups performed\nequally well in the word comprehension task and that the younger age group even outperformed the\nolder one in the word production task.\nThere were two age groups (variable age): The younger age group consisted of 18 children between\n3.1 and 5 years of age (M 5 4, SD 5 .5) and the older age group consisted of 18 children between\n6 and 7.1 years of age (M 5 6.5, SD 5 .3). Children were recruited from the Mater Dei School in\nGenk, Belgium. Participation was voluntary, and written informed consent was obtained from the\nparents. Each child did all the tasks two times: once for a cluster of familiar objects and once for a\ncluster of unfamiliar objects.\nThe experiments were conducted on a Microtouch 3M Inc. 15-inch touch screen and a Pentium IV\n3.2 GHz computer. The experiment was programmed in Eprime 1.3, and the stimuli were created in\nThree stimulus pairs were selected from our set of outlines (Wagemans et al., 2008) derived from the\nSnodgrass and Vanderwart set (1980): donkey and dog, bowl and bottle, car, and hat (see Figure 1,\nupper half). In addition, there were three unfamiliar contours created by the addition of multiple line\nfragments randomly selected from contours of the Snodgrass and Vanderwart set (1980; see Figure\n1, lower half). Three deformation schemes were obtained, one for each set of three pairs of objects,\nwhich was then also applied for a matched pair of unfamiliar shapes (see Introduction for an expla-\nnation and the Appendix for more detail).\nThree unfamiliar contours (see the upper left contours in the lower clusters of Figure 1) were\nplaced one by one in each transformation scheme, creating nine clusters of unfamiliar contours (3\nunfamiliar objects  3 deformation schemes) that inherited the basic-level shape differences from\nthe existing contours, as explained above. Three examples are depicted in the lower half of Figure 1.\nThe variable that distinguishes between these two kinds of contours (familiar vs. unfamiliar) was\nlabelled \"FAMILIARITY.\" In the experiment, the contours were presented without the grids depicted\nin Figure 1. Within each cluster, shapes on the same row are different in category-irrelevant proper-\nties and shapes on different rows are different in category-relevant properties.\nIn each session, the four stimuli of a cluster were paired with four word-like non-words (resem-\nbling normal Dutch nouns). The non-words were randomly selected from a pool of 16 non-words in\nthe beginning of the experiment: \"baak, drun, knaai, fauf, guig, huut, lool, krips, meen, pieg, roeid,\nprans, shoes, stel, weir, zeuj.\" The four selected non-words were consistently related to the same four\nstimuli in the perceptual identification task. The new words were spoken in a sentence in the native\nDutch mother tongue, recorded digitally and reproduced on-line by the computer.\nTwo sessions were administered to each participant: one session consisted of a set of four shapes\nderived from a pair of familiar objects and one session consisted of a matched set of four shapes of\nunfamiliar objects (in the sense that the same transformation scheme was involved). A non-word\nadministered to one participant in the first session was never repeated in the second session. Each set\nwas used equally often within each age group, and the order of the two sessions (familiar and unfa-\nmiliar) was counterbalanced within each age group. So, the three clusters of familiar objects were\neach used six times in total by the 18 participants of each age group, and the nine clusters of unfamil-\niar objects were each used two times in total by the 18 participants of each age group. The clusters\nwere randomly assigned without replacement to the participants.\nCategory-related shape similarity 485\nEach session consisted of four tasks. Two perceptual tasks (perceptual identifications 1 and 2) al-\nlowed us to investigate shape perception at different ages and two small tasks (word comprehension\nand word production) allowed us to investigate the word\u00adshape associations at different ages. In\nperceptual identification task 1, participants carried out a delayed match-to-sample task with four\nalternatives (see Figure 2). During the target presentation, the selected non-word was spoken by the\ncomputer as indicated in Figure 2. The participants had to indicate the target among four alternatives\non a touch screen. The four alternatives consisted of the four stimuli in one cluster (see Figure 1).\nAll four contours served an equal number of times as target and as distracter. For each target contour,\nthere was always one distracter differing in category-irrelevant shape properties and two distracters\ndiffering in category-relevant shape properties. To motivate the children, a kangaroo jumped up-\nwards on a hill for each correct answer. In the perceptual identification task 2, the same four stimuli\nserved as target. However, to make the perceptual identification task more difficult, four in-between\nmorphs were added and participants had to choose between eight alternatives instead of four. Except\nfor the number of alternatives, perceptual identification 2 was identical to perceptual identification 1.\nOne of the purposes of the subtle variation between tasks was to create a computer game with differ-\nent levels of difficulty to motivate the children.\nIn the word comprehension task, the target stimulus presentation was omitted (second and third\ndisplay in Figure 2) and only the four alternatives were shown (first and fourth display in Figure\n2) simultaneously with the spoken question by the computer. To choose correctly between the four\npresented contour shapes, children had to remember the correct shape alternative to which the name\nwas referring in the preceding perceptual identification blocks. In the word production task, only\nthe target contour was presented (display 1 and display 2, now until response) simultaneously with\nthe spoken question translated to English \"How was this called?\" and the children's answers were\nregistered by the experimenter. The experimenter chose one of the word alternatives depending on\nwhat the children uttered. In case of doubt, she mentioned the four alternatives and asked the child to\nchoose.\nEach session consisted of six consecutive blocks: the first, the third, and the fifth block constitut-\ned the perceptual identification task 1 and the second block constituted the perceptual identification\ntask 2. The fourth block constituted the word comprehension task and the sixth block constituted the\nword production task. The reason behind the block order is to alternate between an easy task (percep-\ntual identification 1) and the more difficult tasks in order to prevent fear of failure.\nBecause participants were young children, we could administer only a limited number of trials\n(to prevent fatigue and boredom). The six blocks contained 8, 12, 8, 12, 8, and 12 trials, respectively.\nFigure 2. A trial from the perceptual identification task 1.\nIn all blocks, all contours from one set of four served an equal number of times as target and all\n\ncontours served also an equal number of times as distracter with relevant shape properties or irrel-\nevant shape properties in respect to the target. Each name\u00adshape pair was administered seven times\nin total in all the blocks of the perceptual identification task before the onset of the word comprehen-\nsion task and nine times in total before the onset of the word production task. Each contour-name as-\nsociation was tested three times in the word comprehension task and three times in the word produc-\ntion task. In the word comprehension task, the word production task and the perceptual identification\ntask 2, the kangaroo made a pleasant squeezing sound for each correct and incorrect answer given.\nThus, contrary to the perceptual identification task 1, there was no feedback on the accuracy of the\nanswers in the other three tasks.\nThe experimenter guided the children individually from the classroom to a separate room where the\ncomputer-animated experiment was conducted. The experimenter tried to motivate the children but\naccepted a passive role in the collection of the children's responses. Children were instructed to do\nwhat the computer asked for (see Figure 2). Children were not informed about the different computer\ntasks. For instance, children were not informed that the computer was going to ask them to produce\nthe words at the end of the game (experiment). There was no instruction asking explicitly to memo-\nrize the words for the shapes presented in the perceptual identification tasks. When children re-\nsponded with the conventional nouns for the existing objects in the word production task, they were\ninstructed to use one of the four spoken words in the experiment.\nWe used logistic regression in SAS (i.e., the LOGISTIC procedure). The categorical variables\nAGE (4 vs. 6.5 years), FAMILIARITY (familiar vs. nonfamiliar objects), and AGE  FAMILIAR-\nITY were entered as explanatory variables in all models predicting the log-ratio of two counts (e.g.,\nthe number of correct vs. incorrect answers). The logarithm is used as a link function between the\nratio of counts and the categorical variables to establish a generalized linear model. This is a neces-\nsary step to incorporate probabilities (e.g., accuracy) into a linear model. Because the low numbers\nof trials lead to low counts, we aggregated the data for all blocks of the perceptual identification task\n3.1Perceptual identification\nFirst, we compared the level of accuracy in the perceptual identification tasks between different age\ngroups. We aggregated the number of correct target selections for the three blocks of the perceptual\nidentification task 1. We found a small but significant difference in accuracy for the variable AGE\n5 4.55, p  .05). The younger age group selected the target correctly in 66.2% of the trials\n(68.5% for the familiar shapes and 63.9% for the unfamiliar shapes) and the older age group selected\nthe target correctly in 74.1% of the trials (77.5% for the familiar shapes and 70.6% for the unfamil-\niar shapes). We found a similar trend for the more difficult perceptual identification task 2 but the\ndifference was not significant anymore, probably because of the lower number of trials (x2\n5 .55). The odds for a correct target selection for the older age group against the younger age group\nwere 1.12 for the perceptual identification task 1 and 1.07 for the perceptual identification task 2. We\ndid not find any significant effect for the variable FAMILIARITY and the variable AGE  FAMILI-\nSecond, we investigated whether older children made proportionally more errors for objects dif-\nfering in irrelevant properties compared with relevant properties. In each trial, there were always two\ndistracters differing on relevant properties and only one distracter differing on category-irrelevant\nshape properties (see Figure 1). Therefore, it was two times more likely to select a relevant distracter\nthan an irrelevant one at chance level. Despite the fact that there were more relevant distracters than\nirrelevant ones, irrelevant distracters were chosen much more frequently in both age group. For\nthe familiar objects, the younger age group was 2.38 (x2\nchoose a distracter differing on category-irrelevant shape aspects than on relevant aspects and the\nirrelevant shape differences. For the unfamiliar objects, the younger age group was 1.28 (x2\n .01) times more likely to select a distracter differing on irrelevant shape properties against a dis-\nCategory-related shape similarity 487\ntracter differing on relevant shape properties. The same measure for the older age group was 2.56 (x2\n5 27.6, p  .0001). Although the irrelevant distracters were chosen more frequently for the familiar\nobjects compared with the unfamiliar objects, the trend was not significant (x2\nthe younger age group;\n5 0.71, p 5 0.39 for the older age group). Thus, the effect of FAMILIARITY was not significant.\nTo investigate the influence of age on the type of errors that were made, we compared the prefer-\nence for the irrelevant distracter type against the relevant distracter type across age groups. In the\nperceptual identification task 1, we found developmental differences. In Figure 3, the proportion of\nirrelevant and relevant distracter selections are plotted. The younger age group selected the irrelevant\ndistracter in 16.4% of the cases and the relevant distracters in 17.3% of the cases, while the older\nage group selected the irrelevant distracter in 15.7% of the trials and the relevant distracters only in\nFigure 3.

Notice that the proportion of irrelevant and relevant distracters in Figure 3 and\nthe proportion of correct responses mentioned before sum to one. Given that a distracter was chosen,\nthe older age group was 1.25 times more likely to select the irrelevant distracter type compared with\nthe younger age group (1.2 for the familiar objects and 1.44 for the unfamiliar objects). The variable\nAGE was significant\n5 4.14, p  .05). The trends were similar in the perceptual identification task 2, but the effect of\nAGE was not significant anymore (x2\ntrials.\n3.2Word\u00adshape association learning\nIn two tasks, the word comprehension task and the word production task, the associations between\nwords and shapes were tested. In the word comprehension task, participants had to select the shape\namong four alternatives that corresponded to the spoken names referring to the shape in the preced-\ning perceptual identification task. In Figure 4, the younger age group selected the correct shape for\nwords relating to nonexisting objects in 40.7% of the cases and the correct shape for words referring\nto existing objects in 43.5% of the trials, while the older age group selected the correct shape for\nwords relating to nonexisting objects in 34.7% of the trials and the correct shape for words refer-\nring to existing objects in 46.3% of the trials. The 95% confidence intervals in Figure 4 demonstrate\nthat all scores were higher than chance levels (one out of four), but there was no significant effect of\nIn the word production task, the participants had to name the shapes by using the same names\nas those used to refer to the shapes in the perceptual identification task. The word production scores\nwere lower than the word comprehension scores for the older age group. On the one hand, the word\nproduction task should be more difficult than the word comprehension task because the participants\ncould not choose between the four alternatives anymore and had to recall the name explicitly from\nmemory. On the other hand, children received one extra block of perceptual identification with\nname\u00adshape pairings before the onset of word production task, which might have led to better word\u00ad\nshape associations. The scores for the younger age group were 47.2% for the unfamiliar objects and\n47.7% for the familiar objects, while the older age group scored 25.5% for the unfamiliar objects and\n38.9% for the familiar objects (see Figure 5). Aggregating the data over familiar and unfamiliar ob-\njects, the variable AGE was significant (x2\nFigure 5.

The odds for a correct name\nproduction for younger against older children was 1.47. The variables FAMILIARITY and AGE \nFAMILIARITY were not significant.\n4 Discussion\n4.1Perceptual identification\nIn the perceptual identification task, we found that older children performed slightly better than\nthe younger children. Such a difference in performance is expected when we assume that children\nnormally develop better perceptual skills in the course of their development. Older children made\nfewer errors in the perceptual identification task than younger children, but when focusing on the\ntype of errors children made, an important interaction emerged. The average number of errors was\nmore or less constant for the irrelevant shape differences, that is, younger and older children se-\nlected equally frequently the irrelevant shape distracter (see Figure 3). However, the number of\nerrors made by selecting the relevant shape distracters reduced substantially by age and can actu-\nally account for the whole difference in accuracy between the two age groups. Older and younger\nchildren came to the same proportion of incorrect irrelevant distracter selections but differed largely\nin the proportion of incorrect relevant distracter selections. In other words, older children seemed to\nhave developed more sensitivity for shape differences when shape differences are related to typical\ndifferences between objects of different categories. When we would have observed the reduction of\nerrors only for the familiar objects, then category representations and known labels could have been\nconsidered to account for this reduction in errors. However, the same pattern of errors was observed\nfor the unfamiliar objects. Such a transfer of errors is only possible when experience in the mutual\nrelation between shape and categories also transfers towards never encountered objects. The results\nindicate that shape perception itself is influenced by former categorization experience in the sense\nthat relevant shape properties are perceptually stronger processed before an object is recognized\n(e.g., the unfamiliar objects) and that the relevance of the shape properties seems to correspond with\nchildren's former experience in distinguishing categorical relevant differences between objects (see\nalso Folstein, Gauthier, & Palmeri, 2010; Gillebert, Op de Beeck, & Wagemans, 2008, for related\nbehavioural evidence; and Folstein, Palmeri, & Gauthier, 2012; Gillebert, Op de Beeck, Panis, &\nWagemans, 2009, for related neural evidence). The results also show that category-relevant shape\nprocessing also occur in a perceptual task that does not require any categorical abstractions.\nA shape bias refers to a generalization of nouns on the basis of shape. Instead of generalizing\nnouns, in the perceptual identification task, shapes were matched to shapes, and therefore, the task\nnecessarily forced responses based on shape. A shape bias is not applicable in this context. Inversely\nto a shape bias in the name generalization task, a category bias in matching shapes seems to occur in\nFigure 6. Comparison in overall accuracy for the three tasks for each age group. The error bars denote 95%\nconfidence intervals.\nthe perceptual identification task. Errors in matching shapes largely depended on categorical rela-\ntions. Similar to how the shape bias determines largely the generalization of nouns or categories, a\ncategory bias also seems to exist in tasks depending on perceptual processes.\n4.2Word\u00adshape association learning\nAlthough older children performed better than younger children in the perceptual identification\ntasks, they performed more poorly in the word production task (see Figure 6) and only equally well\n(numerically even slightly worse) in the word comprehension task. The trend is similar for familiar\nand nonfamiliar objects. The younger children were better in remembering explicitly the associated\nnew words when the contours were presented. The results suggest that younger children are better in\nthe acquisition of arbitrary word\u00adshape associations, a phenomenon that might be related to the so-\ncalled critical period of language acquisition (Lenneberg, 1967). The age of the critical period in the\ncontext of our experiment should fall somewhere between the two age groups (i.e., around 5 years of\nage; Krashen, 1973). One of the essential hallmarks of the critical period is that the pattern of decline\nin language acquisition should demonstrate an abrupt change at some critical age (Hakuta, Bialystok,\n& Wiley, 2003). However, because the data only consisted of two age groups, it is impossible to\ndetermine whether the pattern declines monotonically or abruptly at a particular critical age. Never-\ntheless, the results clearly show a decline for word production at a very early age in childhood.\nA word of caution is needed that results should be interpreted in the light of the applied instru-\nments. For instance, in a survey study (Fenson et al., 1994), a 682-word checklist was used derived\nfrom the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventories (CDI) and performed representa-\ntive measurements of an infant's actually acquired vocabulary at a particular moment in their life.\nThe word production test consisting of an inventory check list involves a completely different kind\nof measurement than the word production task in the present study, where only the associations\nbetween four contours and four non-words were learned and measured. Moreover, the children\nwere not instructed to remember the spoken words and the word\u00adshape association tests were not\nannounced beforehand. Small details can lead to unexpected results. For instance, in Sloutsky and\nFisher (2004), 5 year olds exhibited more accurate memory than adults in a new\u00adold recognition task\nof previously encountered stimulus material from a preceding induction task. Before and during the\ninduction task, the participants were not informed that a recognition task would follow. However, in\na baseline group of adults and children, the same material from the induction task was presented, and\nthe baseline participants were instructed to memorize the material to engage later on in a recognition\ntest. Contrary to the induction groups, the baseline adults performed better than the baseline 5 year\nolds. Thus, the fact that the word tests were not announced might have caused the obtained effect in\nthe current investigation. The older age group might be better in ignoring task-irrelevant aspects like\nthe names of the objects in the perceptual identification tasks.\nFurthermore, the decline in performance for the word production task could be explained by\nan age difference in the way attention was divided between the auditory and visual modality. The\nolder age group might have had a tendency to attend more exclusively to the visual input, while the\nyounger age group might have had a tendency to attend more equally to the vocally pronounced la-\nbels and the visually presented contours. Indeed, Robinson and Sloutsky (2004) found evidence that\nyoung children before the age of 4 have a preference for auditory input, while older children have a\npreference for visual input (see also Sloutsky & Robinson, 2008). Obviously, attending both to the\nauditory labels and the visual contours simultaneously could lead to better word\u00adshape associations\nand could explain the decline in performance for the word production task by age.\n4.3Category-relevant shape processing\nAbstract shape properties present in familiar and unfamiliar shapes have to account for the category-\nrelevance effect in perception. By abstracting very general shape properties, older children can dis-\ntinguish better between relevant and irrelevant shape properties, and therefore, they might be able to\nfocus more intensely on the relevant shape properties. This view corresponds to the view that shape\nrecognition builds on increasingly abstract representations of object shape (Smith, 2003; Son et al.,\n2008). According to Son et al. (2008), abstraction is in part simplification and it enables generaliza-\ntion because it requires the removal of irrelevant information.\nA similar view on generalization could be offered for the word production task. Abstraction of\nshape properties could be helpful to narrow down the meaning of a whole set of words instead of just\none. Such a process of abstraction is an efficient way to narrow down naive category representations.\nCategory-related shape similarity 491\nSuch a developmental change would predict that the older age group makes relatively more errors\nfor objects that share basic-level shape properties and fewer errors for objects that do not share basic-\nlevel properties, a hypothesis that was confirmed in the current investigation.\n"
