About 85% of that is present in bones and teeth in\nthe form of apatitie, and the most of the remainder is inside\ncells in soft tissues. Only ~0.1% of body phosphate circu-\nlates in the blood. A well-fed healthy adult consumes\n~1.5 g of phosphorus/day and about two-thirds of that is\nexcreted in the urine and the rest in the feces.\nThe serum phosphorus level is influenced by dietary\nintake, gastrointestinal absorption, distribution across the\nbody compartments including uptake into bone and excre-\ntion [1]. Regulation of serum phosphorus levels involves\nvitamin D, parathyroid hormone and fibroblast-derived\ngrowth factor-23 (FGF-23). Increased serum phosphorus\nconcentrations are associated with vascular calcification\n[2] and mortality in dialysis patients [3\u00ad6]. Reduction in\ndietary phosphorus intake by avoiding foods high in phos-\nphorus such as colas or dairy products is considered critical\nin controlling serum phosphorus in dialysis population.\nThus, the national guidelines recommend reduction in diet-\nary phosphorus intake in dialysis patients.\nAs glomerular filtration rate (GFR) declines to about\ndecreases and serum levels of phosphorus begin to increase\n[7, 8]. More recently, in non-dialysis-dependent chronic\nkidney disease (CKD) patients, higher serum phosphorus\nlevels have been shown to be associated with increased\nmortality [9, 10]. These data raise the possibility that higher\ndietary phosphorus intake might be associated with in-\ncreased mortality in non-dialysis CKD. To our knowledge,\nthere are no prior studies on the associations of dietary\nphosphorus with mortality in moderate CKD. Therefore,\nwe examined these associations in the moderate CKD pop-\nulation in the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES) III data.\nMethods\nStudy population and baseline data\nThe NHANES is an ongoing series of the surveys of the non-institution-\nalized civilian population in the USA conducted by the National Center for\nsurvey of the US population was carried out. It used a complex, multistage\nsampling design to obtain a sample that is representative of the non-\ninstitutionalized civilian US population of early 1990s [11].\nBriefly, participants provided informed consent and underwent a\nstructured home interview conducted by trained personnel to ascertain\nself-reported medical history of conditions such as myocardial infarction,\nstroke, congestive heart failure and diabetes. This was followed by a\nphysical examination, which included blood pressure measurement,\nextensive anthropometric and physiological assessments and blood draw\nfor laboratory testing [11] at the NHANES Mobile Examination Center.\nThe time of the blood draw and the number of hours of fasting before the\nblood draw were recorded. As detailed below, during this visit, partic-\nipants also underwent a detailed diet interview.\nSerum creatinine, albumin, calcium and phosphorus were analyzed on a\nHitachi 737 automated analyzer (Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics,\nIndianapolis, IN) using reagents from Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics.\nSerum creatinine measurements obtained using a kinetic rate Jaffe method\nin NHANES III were recalibrated to standardized creatinine measurements\nobtained at the Cleveland Clinic Research Laboratory (Cleveland, OH) as\ncreatinine [12]. GFR was estimated as 175 3 (standardized serum crea-\n(if the individual is African-American) [13]. CKD was defined as GFR\nDietary assessment\nDetails about dietary assessment methodology have been published else-\nwhere [11]. A computer-based interview system developed by the Uni-\nversity of Minnesota's Nutrition Coordinating Center (Regents of the\nUniversity of Minnesota) was used to conduct a 24-h dietary recall. The\n24-h dietary recall was conducted by trained interviewers. The US Depart-\nment of Agriculture's Survey Nutrient Data Base was used to calculate\nmacro- and micronutrient content of the foods consumed during the 24-h\nrecall period for each respondent.\nNutritional assessment\nA trained technician carried out anthropometric measurements, while\nanother trained technician assisted and recorded the measures. Weight\nwas measured to the nearest 0.01 kg on an electronic scale. Standing height\nwas measured to the nearest 0.1 cm with a stadiometer. Bioimpedance\nanalysis (BIA) model 1990B (Valhalla Scientific, San Diego, CA) was\nused for the measurement of whole body electrical resistance and impe-\ndance. A standardized protocol for BIA procedure was carried out by\ntrained observers and physicians in a standardized environment. Lean\nbody mass (LBM) was estimated from prediction equations that were\nvalidated and cross-validated for men and women separately and for\nblacks and whites between the ages of 12 and 94 years. [men: LBM\nsquared divided by resistance (cm2/X)] [14].\nFollow-up data\nThe National Center for Health Statistics created an NHANES III Linked\nMortality File that contains mortality follow-up data from the date of\n2000. This information was based upon the results from a probabilistic\nmatch between NHANES III and National Death Index death certificate\nStatistical analyses\nNHANES III utilized a complex multistage probability sample design.\nSeveral aspects of the NHANES design must be taken into account in data\nanalysis, including the sampling weights and clustered sampling. We used\nthe svy suite of commands in Stata 11 (Stata 11, College station, TX) and\nfollowed the analytical guidelines for NHANES data proposed by the\nCenters for Disease Control [16]. The svy commands in Stata accounts\nfor the elements of NHANES sampling design to calculate the expected\nmeans and proportions of the entire US non-institutionalized civilian CKD\npopulation, which are presented with the estimated values and with asso-\nciated 95% confidence intervals.\nUsing gender-specific tertiles, unadjusted associations of dietary phos-\nphorus intake with baseline characteristics including dietary variables\n(calorie, protein, calcium and magnesium intake), nutritional variables\n(serum albumin and LBM) and serum calcium, phosphorus and\nDietary phosphorus and mortality 991\ncalcium\u00adphosphorus product were examined using chi-square contin-\ngency table analysis for categorical variables and analysis of variance\nfor continuous variables.\nIn a multivariable linear regression model, the association of dietary\nphosphorus with serum phosphorus was examined adjusted for demo-\ngraphics (age, gender and race), dietary variables (calorie intake and percent\ncalories from protein), time of the day (morning: 7:00\u00ad11:59 AM, afternoon:\nand the hours of fasting before the blood was drawn.\nSurvival analyses\nThe unadjusted association of dietary phosphorus intake with mortality\nwas first examined in a Cox proportional hazards regression model without\ncovariate adjustment. Next, this model was adjusted for age, gender and\nrace to examine the extent to which demographic variables confound this\nassociation. A third Cox regression model was performed with further\ncovariate adjustment for comorbid conditions (history of myocardial\ninfarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, cancer and diabetes), lifestyle\nfactors (smoking, alcohol use and physical activity), dietary variables\n(calorie intake and percent calories from protein) and estimated glomerular\nfiltration rate (eGFR). Finally, as higher phosphorus intake might be\nassociated with better nutritional status, the effects of further adjusting\nfor nutritional variables [serum albumin, body mass index (BMI) and\nLBM] were examined in a fourth Cox regression model.\nThe assumption of proportional hazards was examined by comparing\nthe logarithm of the hazard ratio (HR) for each predictor variable in the\nfirst 3 years of follow-up to the logarithm of the HR of the predictor\nvariables after Year 3. No models showed proportional hazards assump-\ntion violations with respect to dietary phosphorus intake.\nThe factors gender and stroke exhibited a significant deviation from\nproportional hazards (P < 0.05) in at least one of the models. Hence, rather\nthan including these factors as covariates, each of the Cox regressions was\nstratified by each of these factors to allow separate baseline hazard func-\ntions within each stratum. In addition, quadratic terms were tested for each\ncontinuous covariate to test for the presence of nonlinear effects of that\ncovariate. No quadratic terms were statistically significant.\nSimilar analyses were performed treating dietary phosphorus intake as\na categorical variable with the lowest dietary phosphorus intake as the\nreference group.\nResults\nOf the 16 864 adults with valid data for GFR estimation,\nthe subpopulation of 1105 CKD participants with nonmiss-\ning data for dietary intake, nutritional variables and mortal-\nity were included in this analysis.\nHigher phosphorus intake was associated with younger\nage and non-African-American race (Table 1). GFR was\nmodestly higher in the higher phosphorus intake group.\nThere was a very small but statistically significant differ-\nence in calcium\u00adphosphorus product.\nTable 1.

Of the anthropometric meas-\nures, higher phosphorus intake was associated with\nhigher estimated LBM but not BMI or serum albumin\n(Table 2).\nDietary phosphorus was weakly associated with serum\nphosphorus after adjustment for demographics, calorie in-\ntake, percent calories from protein intake, time of blood\ndraw and duration of fasting. A 100 mg/day increase in\ndietary phosphorus was associated with a corresponding\nof follow-up. The unadjusted hazard of death was lower with\nhigher phosphorus intake (Figure 1). As shown in Figure 2,\nadjustment for age, gender and race attenuated the decrease in\nthe HRs associated with higher phosphorus intake. Adjust-\nment for comorbid conditions, eGFR, smoking, alcohol use,\nphysical activity levels and energy intake further attenuated\nthis association. Adjustment for nutritional status eliminated\nthe lower hazard of mortality associated with high phosphorus\nintake.\nThe associations of phosphorus intake as a categorical\nvariable with mortality were similar (Table 4).\nDiscussion\nThe results of the current study suggest that high dietary\nphosphorus levels are associated with very modest increase\nin serum phosphorus levels but not with increased mortality\nin early-stage III CKD. However, high dietary phosphorus\nis positively associated with LBM and intake of energy,\nprotein, calcium and magnesium.\nHigher levels of serum phosphorus was associated with\nincreased risk of mortality in advanced CKD [9, 10] as well\nas hemodialysis patients [3, 5]. Furthermore, higher serum\nphosphorus levels were associated with lower ankle-\nbrachial index (a marker of peripheral arterial disease) in\nindividuals with normal kidney function or moderate kid-\nney disease [17], increased risk of cardiovascular disease in\nproteinuria [18], and increased risk of stroke and death in\nhealthy community-dwelling adults [19]. Therefore, there\nis much interest in strategies to reduce serum phosphorus\n(either by decreasing dietary intake of phosphorus or use of\nphosphorus binders) not only in dialysis population but\nEven though the above studies of serum phosphorus\nprovide a strong rationale for targeting dietary phosphorus\nin advanced stages of kidney disease, there is a paucity of\ndata on whether dietary phosphorus by itself is a risk factor\nfor poor outcomes in those with normal kidney function\nor mild kidney dysfunction. In an earlier analysis of\nNHANES III data, there were no associations of dietary\nphosphorus with serum phosphorus in non institutionalized\nUS general population [23]. Antoniucci et al. [24] con-\nducted a rigorous 4-week interventional study of dietary\nphosphorus in 13 healthy men. In that study, participants\nwere admitted to a General Clinical Research Center\nand consumed a constant diet that provided 500 mg of\nphosphorus per day, which was supplemented to achieve\nthree phosphorus intakes, each of 9 days duration:control\nrestricted \u00bc 625 mg/day. Intakes of calcium, sodium,\npotassium, magnesium, and energy were constant. Diet-\nary phosphorus intervention had no effects on serum\nphosphorus levels. Therefore, there is no clear evidence\nto support the notion that dietary phosphorus manipula-\ntion will impact on serum phosphorus levels in those\nwith normal kidney function or those with moderate\nNonetheless, independent of serum phosphorus levels,\nhigh dietary phosphorus could have deleterious consequen-\nces through other mechanisms. In the phosphorus interven-\ntion study described above, high dietary phosphorus intake\nresulted in increased serum levels of FGF-23 [24]. In-\ncreased serum levels of FGF-23 have been shown to be\nindependently associated with endothelial dysfunction\n[25], coronary artery disease [26], left ventricular hyper-\ntrophy [27] and mortality [28] in CKD or dialysis patients.\nApart from its effects on serum FGF-23 levels, high dietary\nphosphorus could affect outcomes through other mecha-\nnisms. For instance, in vitro, bovine aortic endothelial cells\nexposed to a phosphorus load increased production of\nreactive oxygen species and decreased nitric oxide produc-\ntion [29]. Furthermore, flow-mediated dilation of the\nbrachial artery was significantly decreased by dietary\nphosphorus load in healthy volunteers [29]. Apart from\ncardiovascular disease, high dietary phosphorus intake\ncould also increase progression of kidney disease as uremic\nTable 3. Adjusted associations of dietary phosphorus with serum phosphorus\nRegression coefficient (95% CI) P-value\nTime of blood draw\nDietary phosphorus and mortality 993\nrats fed with low phosphorus diet had slower progression of\nkidney disease on renal histology [30].\nTaken together, the above literature could be interpreted\nas evidence that high dietary phosphorus intake could be\ndeleterious in those with moderate kidney disease. Indeed,\nin maintenance hemodialysis patients, high dietary phos-\nphorus was associated with increased hazard of death [31].\nHowever, to our knowledge, there are no published data on\nwhether high dietary phosphorus intake is indeed associ-\nated with increased mortality in moderate CKD.\nnary excretion of phosphorus decreases and serum levels of\nphosphorus begins to increase [7, 8]. In this sample of\npeople with moderate kidney disease (eGFR, 49.3 \u00c6 9.5\nmL/min/1.73 m2), higher reported dietary phosphorus in-\ntake was associated with lower hazard of death in unad-\njusted models (Table 3 and Figure 2). With adjustment,\ndietary phosphorus intake was not significantly associated\nwith mortality. It is possible that the magnitude of the Cox\nregression coefficients for dietary phosphorus were attenu-\nated due to effects of measurement error [32] or short-term\nvariation in diet. However, because the estimated HRs cor-\nresponding to higher phosphorous levels were <1 in each\nmodel considered (Figure 2), it is unlikely that attenuation\ndue to measurement error obscured a direct association of\nhigher phosphorus with increased mortality. Thus, the\nresults of this study suggest that spontaneously higher phos-\nphorus intake is not associated with increased mortality at\nthis level of eGFR. It is still conceivable that dietary phos-\nphorus restriction might improve outcomes in those with\nmore advanced CKD with decreased ability to excrete phos-\nphorus. Interventional studies are warranted to conclusively\nestablish the potential benefit or harm of low phosphorus diet\nin early-stage III CKD.\nAnother therapeutic strategy is the use of phosphorus\nbinders to decrease dietary phosphorus absorption in\nthose with early stages of CKD and normal serum phos-\nphorus levels [33]. In individuals with advanced CKD\nrus (4.5 \u00c6 0.7 mg/dL), therapy with sevelamer was\nassociated with decreased progression of coronary calci-\nfication compared to individuals treated with a low phos-\nphorus diet alone [34]. Since low phosphorus diet was\nassociated with increased coronary calcification in that\nstudy, the decreased calcification with sevelamer may be\nthrough mechanisms independent of its dietary phospho-\nrus-binding effect. Therefore, it is unclear whether dietary\nphosphorus restriction would improve coronary calcifica-\ntion and cardiovascular outcomes in CKD. In a retrospec-\ntive analysis of hemodialysis patients, patients treated\nwith phosphorus binders were matched with those who\nwere not treated with phosphorus binders by their baseline\nserum phosphate levels and propensity score of receiving\nphosphorus binders during the first 90 days [33]. In that\nstudy, therapy with phosphorus binders was independ-\nently associated with lower mortality. This was presum-\nably because phosphorus binders suppressed serum FGF-\n23 levels. Similarly, in men with moderate to advanced\nnon-dialysis CKD, phosphorus binder therapy was asso-\nciated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality which\nFig. 1. Kaplan\u00adMeier plot of unadjusted survival by phosphorus intake\ntertiles in moderate CKD.\nFig. 2. HR of death associated with phosphorus intake in moderate CKD.\nTable 4.

However, in a small randomized con-\ntrolled trial of CKD patients, the use of lanthanum, a phos-\nphorus binder was associated with decrease in urinary\nphosphorus excretion but not that of serum FGF-23 levels\n[35]. Thus, it is unclear whether the use of phosphorus bind-\ners in early-stage CKD patients with normal serum phospho-\nrus levels would impact on hard end-points.\nHigher protein intake is associated with higher phospho-\nrus intake. Therefore, zealous restriction of phosphorus\nintake might decrease protein intake and adversely affect\nnutritional status [36]. Indeed, in this study, higher phos-\nphorus intake was associated with higher LBM (Table 2).\nDietary approaches to maximizing nutritional status while\ncontrolling phosphorus intake include maximizing the or-\nganic phosphorus to protein ratio and minimizing inor-\nganic sources [31]. An organic Italian Mediterranean diet\nwas reported to both decrease serum phosphorus and in-\ncrease LBM among patients with Stages 2 and 3 kidney\ndisease [37]. Adjustment of phosphate binder use based on\ndietary phosphate intake is reported to result in improved\nphosphorus levels in children without influencing\nStrengths of this study include the representative sam-\nple and rigorous methodology of the NHANES study.\nLimitations of the study include the observational nature,\nwhich limits causal inferences. Despite its common use,\nthe Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation has\nseveral limitations when used in specific groups and may\nresult in the over diagnosis of CKD [39]. Furthermore,\nthere were only single baseline measurements of dietary\nintake with a single 24-h recall at baseline. Conventional\nnutrient databases may not account for the consumption of\nfood additives laden with highly bioavailable phosphorus\n[40\u00ad43], which might result in underestimation of phos-\nphorus [36]. Imprecise estimates of dietary phosphorus\nintake might bias the study toward null hypothesis. How-\never, given that the total calorie intake was lower in the\nlowest phosphorus group and higher in the highest phos-\nphorus group, it is unlikely that there was systematic\nunderestimation of dietary phosphorus in the low phos-\nphorus intake group compared to the high phosphorus\nintake group. Fasting durations and time of day in blood\ncollection varied between participants and these might\naffect serum phosphorus levels. However, when adjusted\nfor these variables, dietary phosphorus had statistically\nsignificant but clinically not meaningful association with\nserum phosphorus at this level of eGFR. In addition, there\nare no data available in this NHANES dataset on serum\nparathyroid hormone or FGF-23 levels.\nWe conclude that spontaneously higher dietary phospho-\nrus intake is not associated with increased mortality in\nmoderate CKD in the USA. We conjecture that this absence\nof association reflects the maintenance of serum phospho-\nrus levels in the normal range at this level of GFR. How-\never, interventional trials are needed to establish the\noptimal level of dietary phosphorus intake in moderate\nCKD. Demonstration of sustainable dietary and supple-\nment approaches to maximizing nutritional status and phos-\nphorus metabolism may play a role in improving both\nclinical outcomes and quality of life of patients with CKD.\n"
