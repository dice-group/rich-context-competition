The aim of this study was to\ninvestigate whether betatrophin levels and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) were associated.\nMethods: Circulating betatrophin levels were measured in 162 patients with PCOS and 156\nmatched control females using specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Correlations\nbetween betatrophin levels and PCOS incidence as well as multiple key endocrine PCOS\nparameters were analyzed using multiple statistical methods.\nResults: Betatrophin levels were significantly increased in patients with PCOS (685.3 \u00c6 27.7 vs.\n772.6 \u00c6 42.5 pg/ml). When sub-grouping all investigated subjects according to the presence of\ninsulin resistance, women with PCOS and insulin resistance exhibited markedly higher betatrophin\nconcentrations. Furthermore, betatrophin levels were significantly correlated with fasting insulin\nlevels and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance only in females with PCOS\nConclusion: We provide the first report that betatrophin is strongly associated with PCOS. This\nstudy suggests that betatrophin may potentially serve as an independent predictor for the\ndevelopment of PCOS in at-risk women, especially those with insulin resistance.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/imr\n*These authors contributed equally to this work.\n1Department of Reproductive Medicine, Yantai\nYuhuangding Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao\nUniversity, Yantai, Shandong, China\n2Department of Obstetrics, Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital,\nAffiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Yantai, Shandong,\nChina\nCorresponding author:\nHongchu Bao, Department of Reproductive Medicine,\nYantai Yuhuangding Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao\nUniversity, 20 Yuhuangding East Rd, Yantai Shandong\nEmail: hongchubao@outlook.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and\ndistribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.\nsagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\n",

However, the aetiology of PCOS\nis underpinned by both insulin resistance\nand hyperandrogenism, with insulin resist-\nance exacerbating hyperandrogenism.3\nInsulin resistance occurs in approximately\n80% of women with PCOS and occurs\nindependently of obesity.4 Furthermore,\nwomen with PCOS are believed to be at an\nincreased risk of developing type 2 diabetes\nmellitus (T2DM).5 A recent meta-analysis of\n13 studies reported a 4-fold increased risk of\nT2DM in women with PCOS.6 Thus, PCOS\nis a well-defined clinical model of insulin\nresistance and the pre-diabetic state.\nBetatrophin, also known as angiopoietin-\nlike protein (ANGPTL8), is a newly identi-\nfied circulating protein predominantly\nproduced in the liver and adipose tissue.\nBetatrophin is induced as a result of insulin\nresistance,7 therefore attracting increasing\nattention. Betatrophin was reported to pro-\nmote pancreatic beta cell proliferation and\nimprove metabolic control by increasing the\nbeta cell division rate in insulin resistant\nmice.7 However, in humans, the associations\nof serum betatrophin levels with diabetes,\nobesity, and lipid profiles remain controver-\nsial.8,9 Some studies have suggested that\ncirculating betatrophin levels are elevated\ncorrelating with lipid profiles,18 while others\nreported that betatrophin levels were\nreduced in subjects with diabetes.19\nAccumulating evidence suggests that beta-\ntrophin is significantly associated with adi-\nposity, type 2 diabetes, and the metabolic\nTo date, there have been no reports on\nthe relationship between betatrophin and\nPCOS. In fact, most women with PCOS\ndisplay impaired glucose tolerance and are\nat higher risk for developing T2DM.21\nMoreover, betatrophin has a close relation-\nship with insulin resistance and\nquestion of whether abnormal betatrophin\nmight associate with PCOS. Therefore, the\npresent study aimed to detect circulating\nbetatrophin levels in subjects with PCOS\nand healthy control female patients. We also\nevaluated the association between betatro-\nphin levels and clinical, hormonal, and\nmetabolic variables to achieve a better\nunderstanding of the relationship between\nbetatrophin and PCOS.\nPatients and methods\nStudy participants\nThis case-control study was approved\nby the Institutional Ethical Review\nBoard of Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital\nwas obtained from all patients before the\ninitiation of the study. We included 162\nwomen with a diagnosis of PCOS and 156\nnon-hirsute ovulatory women (regular\ncycles and luteal phase progesterone levels\nhigher than 3.8 ng/mL), ranging from 18 to\n45 years of age, in the study at our clinic\naccording to the Rotterdam PCOS\nConsensus criteria.22 Each subject under-\nwent a complete medical examination and\nan endocrine profile and haematological,\nhepatic, and renal function analysis.

Automated\nchemiluminescence immunoassay systems\nwere used for measuring luteinizing hormone\n(LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),\ntotal testosterone (ADVIA Centaur,\nSiemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Eschborn,\nGermany), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate,\nand sex hormone\u00adbinding globulin (SHBG)\nDiagnostics). The free androgen index\n(FAI) was estimated by dividing total testos-\nterone (nmol/L) by SHBG (nmol/L) \u00c2 100.\nLow-density lipoprotein cholesterol was\nestimated indirectly with the Friedewald for-\nmula.24 Total cholesterol, high-density lipo-\nprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, and\nglucose levels were determined by colori-\nmetric-enzymatic methods (Siemens Advia\nSystem, Deerfield, IL, USA). Intra- and\ninter-assay coefficient of variation values\nfor these parameters were <5% and <8%,\nrespectively.\nGlucose tolerance test\nIn all subjects, a 3-h oral glucose tolerance\ntest was used to evaluate insulin resistance\nand b-cell function. After a 12-h overnight\nfast, patients ingested 75g glucose, and glu-\ncose and insulin concentrations were deter-\nand 180 min. For this study, we used only\nfasting insulin and glucose to determine the\nHOMA index. Insulin resistance was calcu-\nlated using the HOMA-insulin resistance\n(HOMA-IR) formula: glucose (mmol/L) \u00c2\nlin was evaluated using a chemiluminescence\nimmunometric assay and commercial kit\nglucose was measured using a glucose oxidase\nassay (Tosoh Corp., Tosoh, Japan).\nMeasurement of betatrophin\nFasting serum betatrophin levels were\nassessed using enzyme-linked immunosorb-\nent assay (ELISA) kits (EIAab Science,\nThe procedures were in accordance with the\nmanufacturer's instructions.

The\ncorrelation coefficient (r) and P-value were adjusted for age and body mass index. Clinical indexes with significant\ninsulin, resulting in increased serum trigly-\nceride levels and insulin resistance instead\nHowever, several reports have indicated\nthat betatrophin was increased in T2DM\nthat betatrophin could be a potent diagnos-\ntic biomarker for T2DM.27 Of note, a recent\nmeta-analysis demonstrated that circulating\nbetatrophin levels in patients with T2DM\nwere higher than those of non-diabetic\nadults in the non-obese, but not in the\nobese, population.8 This finding suggests\nthat betatrophin plays a role in the patho-\ngenesis of insulin resistance and T2DM. In\naddition to T2DM, Ebert et al.15 determined\nthat women with gestational diabetes melli-\ntus had significantly higher betatrophin\nlevels compared with those of healthy preg-\nnant controls. Furthermore, gestational dia-\nbetes mellitus status positively predicted\ncirculating betatrophin levels. Additionally,\nmounting evidence from recent animal-\nbased studies has suggested that betatrophin\nassociates with lipid metabolism. Mice lack-\ning betatrophin had a 70% reduction in\nplasma triglyceride levels compared with\nthose of littermate control subjects.26\nHowever, to date, no studies have examined\nwhether betatrophin is associated with\nPCOS, though growing evidence has\nsuggested that insulin resistance and dysli-\npidaemia play critical roles in its\npathophysiology.\nAs indicated in this study, we determined\nthat circulating betatrophin levels were\nmarkedly increased in Chinese patients\nwith PCOS compared with those in the\ncontrol group. Moreover, a Spearman rank\nanalysis demonstrated that serum betatro-\nphin levels were significantly positively asso-\nciated with indexes of insulin resistance,\nincluding fasting insulin levels and\nHOMA-IR. These findings corroborate\nthose of a previous population-based study\nthat indicated that serum betatrophin levels\nwere elevated in patients with T2DM and\nassociated with insulin resistance.14\nHowever, it is unclear whether increased\nbetatrophin expression is a compensatory\nresponse or only a marker of insulin resist-\nance in PCOS. Notably, increased circulat-\ning betatrophin levels were identified in\nwomen with PCOS and insulin resistance\nbut not in control women with insulin\nresistance. Nonetheless, the increased beta-\ntrophin levels in subjects with PCOS are\ninteresting and raise the question regarding\nthe actual function of betatrophin, particu-\nlarly after recent reports confirming that\nbetatrophin does not affect beta cell expan-\nsion in mice28 or humans.29 Additionally, it\nis postulated that betatrophin as a novel\nhormone may be involved in the generation\nof an atherogenic lipid profile.18 However,\nbeyond glucose metabolism, we did not find\nthat betatrophin levels significantly asso-\nciated with the lipid profile. Therefore, it\nwould appear that different mechanisms are\ninvolved in the regulation of betatrophin\nlevels in PCOS. However, we cannot exclude\nthe possibility that elevated betatrophin\nlevels may be associated with other etio-\nlogical factors in PCOS, which may affect\ninsulin resistance. In a recent study, Yi\net al.27 determined that betatrophin could\nbe a potent diagnostic biomarker for T2DM\nTable 3.

Clinical indexes with significant differ-\nences (P <.05) are in bold.\nin an indigenous Chinese population, imply-\ning that betatrophin might be the driving\ncause of the disease. More studies are\nrequired to determine the mechanisms\nunderlying the role of betatrophin in PCOS.\nSimilarly, Calan M et al.30 and Song S\net al.31 revealed that betatrophin levels were\nhigher in patients with PCOS than those in\nthe control group. Moreover, Calan M\net al.30 demonstrated a positive correlation\nbetween betatrophin levels and HOMA-IR\nin patients with PCOS and control subjects,\nwhich is consistent with our present result.\nHowever, Song S et al.31 determined that\nserum betatrophin levels were negatively\ncorrelated with HOMA-IR. Conversely,\nErbag G et al.32 in a small sample study (30\npatients with PCOS and 27 without PCOS)\nidentified significantly lower betatrophin\nlevels in patients with PCOS. In the same\nstudy, betatrophin levels displayed a strong\nnegative correlation with HOMA-IR. The\ndifferent findings may be related to the use of\ndifferent ELISA kits, different ethnic groups,\nor the design and sample size of each study.\nTo evaluate which parameters were inde-\npendently associated with betatrophin levels\nin PCOS, a multiple regression analysis was\nperformed. We identified HOMA-IR as the\nonly parameter that remained statistically\nsignificant. We therefore conclude that insu-\nlin resistance was the primary contributing\nfactor to elevated betatrophin concentra-\ntions in this cohort of patients with PCOS.\nThus, betatrophin levels are evidence of a\nPCOS-associated disorder rather than a\nPCOS diagnosis, possibly indicating a state\nof oxidative stress and inflammation, and\nare strongly associated with insulin resist-\nance in patients with PCOS.\nThe limitations of the present study\nincluded the relatively small sample size,\nwhich precluded stratification of groups by\nBMI for comparison, and the cross sectional\nnature, which prevented us from establish-\ning causality. Another limitation in our\nstudy is the lack of assessment of\nbetatrophin levels on different days of the\nmenstrual cycle in subjects. Therefore, fur-\nther studies are required to investigate the\nassociations between betatrophin levels and\nclinical phenotype and pro-inflammatory\nmarkers in normal-weight versus obese\nwomen with PCOS, as well as to better\ncharacterize betatrophin secretion through-\nout the menstrual cycle.\nIn conclusion, we have provided the first\nevidence that serum betatrophin concentra-\ntions were markedly increased in patients\nwith PCOS compared with those of control\nsubjects. Our findings also suggest a possible\nassociation between betatrophin levels and\nPCOS. However, additional studies are\nneeded to elucidate the role of betatrophin\nin PCOS development and determine\nwhether targeting betatrophin could hold\npromise for PCOS treatment.\n"
