    "abstract": "Abstract:\nreputation in the world of central banking. Germany achieved a high degree of domestic\nstability and provided safe haven for investors in times of turmoil in the international\nfinancial system. Eventually the Bundesbank provided the role model for the European\nCentral Bank. Hence, we examine an episode of lasting importance in European\nmonetary history. The purpose of this paper is to highlight how the Bundesbank\nmonetary policy strategy contributed to this success. We analyze the strategy as it was\nconceived, communicated and refined by the Bundesbank itself. We propose a\ntheoretical framework (following S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m, 2005) where monetary targeting is\ninterpreted, first and foremost, as a commitment device. In our setting, a monetary\ntarget helps anchoring inflation and inflation expectations. We derive an interest rate\nrule and show empirically that it approximates the way the Bundesbank conducted\npolicy rule with those of the FED and of the Bank of England. We find that the\nBundesbank's policy reaction function was characterized by strong persistence of policy\nrates as well as a strong response to deviations of inflation from target and to the\nactivity growth gap. In contrast, the response to the level of the output gap was not\nsignificant. In our empirical analysis we use real-time data, as available to policy-\nmakers at the time.\nJEL-Classification: Inflation, Price Stability, Monetary Policy, Monetary Targeting,\nPolicy Rules\nNon technical summary\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, the German Bundesbank established its\nreputation as one of the most successful central banks in the world. Along with the\nSwiss National Bank, the Bundesbank was the first central bank to announce and pursue\na strategy based on monetary targets after the breakdown of Bretton Woods. In this\npaper, we relate the Bundesbank success in maintaining price stability and in anchoring\ninflation expectations to its strategy. We examine the strategy as it was presented,\nrefined and communicated by the Bundesbank itself. Our goal is to provide a historical\naccount of the conduct of monetary policy, focusing especially on the first ten years of\nmonetary targeting, from 1975 until the middle of the 1980s, when price stability was\nvirtually reached in Germany.\nAccording to the Bundesbank Act, the objective of monetary policy is to safeguard the\ncurrency. The Bundesbank has always interpreted its mandate as giving precedence to\n(domestic) price stability. It is, therefore, clear that monetary targets were intermediate\ntargets. Moreover, the Bundesbank's operational framework for monetary policy\nimplementation implied that the first step in the transmission mechanism was the\ncontrol over a money market interest rate. Thus, in this paper, we characterize the\nBundesbank's monetary policy strategy through an interest rate rule in the tradition of\nTaylor (1993, 1999), modified to take account of the implications of monetary targeting\nfor the Bundesbank's interest rate decisions.\nBuilding on the modified loss function approach (pioneered by Rogoff, 1985), we show\nhow focusing on money growth helps to bring the conduct of monetary policy closer to\noptimal policy under commitment (thereby improving on the outcome under discretion).\nIt does so by inducing a persistent, history-dependent response of policy rates to\ndeviations of inflation and output from target. We find that the interest rate rule implied\nby our model captures key features of the Bundesbank's monetary policy actions. In the\nmodified loss function framework, monetary growth targeting is permanently relevant\nand imposes structure on the monetary policy reaction function. Nevertheless, given that\nmonetary deviations from target have to be traded off against other arguments in the\nloss function, frequent deviations from target cannot be excluded. Hence, the operation\nof monetary growth targeting as a commitment device is compatible with target misses,\neven repeatedly. In practice, the Bundesbank had to account for the determinants of\nobserved deviations and explain how, in the end, it would deliver on the final goal of\nprice level stability.\nUsing real-time data, our main empirical finding is that the Bundesbank response to the\noutput growth gap was highly significant. Such response is a characteristic of the\nconduct of monetary policy under commitment. It is also robust policy against problems\nin the measurement of the level of potential output in real time. A similar response to\nthe growth gap was not present in the reaction function of the Federal Reserve System\nduring the Burns-Miller period. It does become significant, for the US, in the later\nVolcker-Greenspan period. We are able to characterize systematic monetary policy for\nGermany and the US. Our empirical findings suggest a much less stable approach in the\nNicht technische Zusammenfassung\nIn der zweiten H\u00e4lfte des 20. Jahrhunderts begr\u00fcndete die Deutsche Bundesbank ihren\nRuf als eine der erfolgreichsten Zentralbanken weltweit. Neben der Schweizerischen\nNationalbank war die Bundesbank die erste Zentralbank, die nach dem Zusammenbruch\ndes Bretton-Woods-Systems eine Strategie der Geldmengensteuerung bekannt gab und\nverfolgte. In der vorliegenden Arbeit setzen wir den Erfolg der Bundesbank bei der\nGew\u00e4hrleistung der Preisstabilit\u00e4t und der Verankerung der Inflationserwartungen in\nBeziehung zu ihrer Strategie. Wir untersuchen diese Strategie in der Form, wie sie von\nder Bundesbank formuliert, weiterentwickelt und kommuniziert wurde. Unser Ziel ist\neine historisch akkurate Darstellung der geldpolitischen Entscheidungsfindung, mit\neinem besonderen Schwerpunkt auf den ersten zehn Jahren der Geldmengensteuerung,\nvon 1975 bis Mitte der Achtzigerjahre. Im Laufe dieser Phase wurde in Deutschland\nnahezu Preisstabilit\u00e4t erreicht.\nGem\u00e4\u00df dem Gesetz \u00fcber die Deutsche Bundesbank ist die Aufgabe der Geldpolitik die\nW\u00e4hrungssicherung. Die Bundesbank hat ihren Auftrag immer dahingehend ausgelegt,\ndass sie der (inl\u00e4ndischen) Preisstabilit\u00e4t Vorrang gab. Demzufolge ist klar, dass die\nGeldmengenziele Zwischenzielgr\u00f6\u00dfen darstellten. \u00dcberdies implizierte der\ngeldpolitische Handlungsrahmen der Bundesbank, dass der erste Schritt im\nTransmissionsmechanismus die Kontrolle eines kurzfristigen Zinssatzes am Geldmarkt\nwar. Deshalb beschreiben wir in dieser Arbeit die Geldpolitik der Bundesbank mithilfe\neiner Zinsregel in der Tradition Taylors (1993, 1999), die so angepasst wurde, dass sie\ndie Bedeutung der Geldmengensteuerung f\u00fcr die Zinsbeschl\u00fcsse der Bundesbank\nber\u00fccksichtigt.\nIm theoretischen Teil des Papiers zeigen wir mit Hilfe eines einfachen makro-\n\u00f6konomischen Modells, wie eine Ber\u00fccksichtigung des Geldmengenwachstums in der\nVerlustfunktion dazu beitr\u00e4gt, die geldpolitische Reaktionsfunktion in Richtung einer\noptimalen regelgebundenen Geldpolitik zu lenken (und damit die Resultate einer\ndiskretion\u00e4ren Politik zu verbessern). Dies geschieht, indem eine persistente und\nvergangenheitsabh\u00e4ngige Reaktion der Leitzinsen auf Abweichungen der Inflation und\nder Produktion von ihren Zielgr\u00f6\u00dfen erzeugt wird. Wir stellen fest, dass die aus\nunserem Modell resultierende Zinsregel wesentliche Merkmale der geldpolitischen\nMa\u00dfnahmen der Bundesbank erfasst. Bei der modifizierten Verlustfunktion ist die\nSteuerung der Geldmenge dauerhaft relevant und gibt der geldpolitischen Reaktions-\nfunktion eine Struktur vor. Dennoch k\u00f6nnen in Anbetracht der Tatsache, dass Ab-\nweichungen der Geldmenge vom Zielwert gegen andere Argumente in der Verlust-\nfunktion abgewogen werden m\u00fcssen, h\u00e4ufige Abweichungen von der Zielgr\u00f6\u00dfe nicht\nausgeschlossen werden. Daher ist die Durchf\u00fchrung der Geldmengensteuerung als\neinem Instrument der Regelbindung mit \u00ad sogar mehrfachen \u00ad Verfehlungen der Ziel-\nwerte vereinbar. In der Praxis musste die Bundesbank \u00fcber die Bestimmungsfaktoren\nder beobachteten Abweichungen Rechenschaft ablegen und erkl\u00e4ren, wie sie schluss-\nendlich das eigentliche Ziel der Preisstabilit\u00e4t erreichen w\u00fcrde.\nDas wichtigste Ergebnis unserer empirischen Untersuchung \u00ad unter der Verwendung\nvon Echtzeitdaten \u00ad ist, dass die Reaktion der Bundesbank auf eine Abweichung des\nBIP-Wachstums von Wachstum des Produktionspotentials hoch signifikant war. Eine\nsolche Reaktion ist charakteristisch f\u00fcr die Durchf\u00fchrung einer regelgebundenen Geld-\npolitik. Sie stellt zudem eine robuste Politik im Hinblick auf Probleme bei der Messung\ndes Produktionspotenzials in Echtzeit dar. Eine vergleichbare Reaktion auf die\nWachstumsl\u00fccke war in der Reaktionsfunktion des Federal Reserve System in der Zeit\nvon Burns und Miller nicht nachzuweisen. Sie wird f\u00fcr die Vereinigten Staaten erst im\nsp\u00e4teren Verlauf der Amtszeit von Volcker und unter Greenspan signifikant. Wir sind in\nder Lage, f\u00fcr Deutschland und die USA eine systematische Geldpolitik zu beschreiben;\nunsere empirischen Befunde deuten auf einen deutlich weniger stabilen Ansatz im\nVereinigten K\u00f6nigreich hin.\nContents\n2 Brief overview of inflation developments in selected industrial\n2.1 Rise and fall of the Bretton Woods regime 4\n2.3 Explanations of the Great Inflation 6\n3 Sound money and price stability in Germany 8\n3.1 The legacy of the Bundesbank and stability-oriented monetary\npolicy\n3.2 The conduct of policy under monetary targeting 13\n4 Monetary targeting as a commitment device 20\n5 The Conduct of Monetary Policy and Monetary Policy Rules 29\n5.1 Brief reference to the literature 30\n5.2 A comparison of empirically estimated policy rules 30\nLists of Tables and Figures\nTable 2.1 Selected Macroeconomic Indicators for G7 &\nSwitzerland\nTable 3.1 Numerical inputs for the derivation of the money growth\ntargets\nTable 3.2 Monetary targets and their implementation 51\nTable 5.1 Estimates of the extended reaction function, inflation\nforward-looking (from t to t+4), change in output gap\nfrom t-4 to t, real-time data\nTable 5.2a The US.

Along with the\nSwiss National Bank, the Bundesbank was the first central bank to announce and pursue\na strategy based on monetary targets after the breakdown of Bretton Woods. In this\npaper, we relate the Bundesbank success in maintaining price stability and in anchoring\ninflation expectations to its strategy. We examine the strategy as it was presented,\nrefined and communicated by the Bundesbank itself. Our goal is to provide a historical\naccount of the conduct of monetary policy, focusing especially on the first ten years of\nmonetary targeting, from 1975 until the middle of the 1980s, when price stability was\nvirtually reached in Germany.\nAccording to the Bundesbank Act the objective of monetary policy is to safeguard the\ncurrency. The Bundesbank has always interpreted its mandate as giving precedence to\n(domestic) price stability. It is, therefore, clear that monetary targets were intermediate\ntargets. They were instrumental to achieving price stability. Helmut Schlesinger (1988)\n\u00ad as quoted in von Hagen (1995) - made the point crystal clear:\n\"... the Bundesbank has never, since 1975, conducted a rigid policy geared at the\nmoney supply alone; all available information about financial markets and the\ndevelopment of the economy must be analyzed regularly ... Furthermore, the\nBundesbank had to check the consistency of her original monetary targets with the\nultimate policy goals.\"\n* Paper prepared for the National Bureau of Economic Research, The Great Inflation Conference, Woodstock,\nVermont, September 25-27, 2008.

Last but not least we would like to express our gratitude to Aurelie\nTherace for her efficient help in preparing the final manuscript.\nMoreover, the Bundesbank's operational framework for monetary policy\nimplementation implied that the first step in the transmission mechanism was the\ncontrol over a money market interest rate. Thus, in this paper, we characterize the\nBundesbank's monetary policy strategy through an interest rate rule in the tradition of\nTaylor (1993, 1999), modified to take account of the implications of monetary targeting\nfor the Bundesbank's interest rate decisions. The issue has already been repeatedly\nconsidered in the literature (e.g. Clarida et al., 1998, Gerberding et al., 2005).\nThe central role of monetary policy in anchoring inflation and inflation expectations\nwas recognized as crucial by the Bundesbank early on. Such concern is transparent in\nthe mechanics of the derivation of the monetary target. From this viewpoint, central\nbanking practice progressed ahead of theory's emphasis on credibility and reputation (as\ndeveloped later in the work of Kydland and Prescott, 1977; Barro and Gordon 1983a,\nIn the last fifteen years, the new neoclassical synthesis and new Keynesian models\nbecame the workhorse for the theory of monetary policy-making (see Woodford, 2003,\nand Gal\u00ed, 2008, for authoritative, book length, surveys).1 These models rely on a Real\nBusiness Cycle core. They add on price setting by monopolistic competitive firms\nsubject to some constraint or cost on price changes, leading to nominal stickiness.\nAnother key feature is that economic agents form expectations in a forward-looking\nway, taking into account what they know about the central bank's reaction function.\nHence, despite their well-known limitations, these models provide a natural\nenvironment to discuss commitment, credibility and reputation (see, for example,\nBuilding on the modified loss function approach (pioneered by Rogoff, 1985), we will\nshow in this paper how focusing on money growth helps to bring the conduct of\nmonetary policy closer to optimal policy under commitment (thereby improving on the\noutcome under discretion). It does so by inducing a persistent, history-dependent\nresponse of policy rates to deviations of inflation and output from target. Therefore, it\n1 These models have also been actively used in policy-making institutions. Prominent examples are the ECB,\nthe Board of Governors and the IMF.

Nevertheless, it does, in our view, help to interpret the historical\nevidence. Specifically, our stylized story suggests one mechanism through which\nmonetary targeting provided a means to anchor inflation and inflation expectations. We\nderive an interest rate rule corresponding to this set-up and confront it with real-time\ndata. We find that the interest rate rule implied by our model of monetary targeting\ncaptures the Bundesbank's monetary policy actions well. We compare the policy\npursued in Germany with those conducted by the FED and the Bank of England.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we provide an overview of the relative\nperformance of German monetary policy as compared with other industrialized\ncountries. In section 3 we briefly describe institutions and history of monetary policy in\nGermany in the relevant period. We elucidate the concept of \"pragmatic monetarism\"\nand clarify the crucial role of the explicit derivation of the monetary target. In section 4\nwe introduce a simple macroeconomic framework based on the standard new Keynesian\nmodel. We derive a role for monetary targeting as a commitment devise. We obtain the\ninstrument rule implied by our framework. In section 5 we estimate an interest rate rule,\ninspired by our theoretical analysis, using real time German data and compare the\nresults with estimates for the US and the UK. In section 6 we conclude.\n2 Brief overview of inflation developments in selected industrial\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, the German Bundesbank acquired a strong\nreputation for maintaining lower inflation rates than many other countries could. In this\nsection we will look at the relevant stylized facts and put them into historical context, in\nparticular from a monetary policy perspective. From a global view, the second half of\nthe 20th century was marked by three periods: by the system of Bretton Woods which\nlasted until 1973, to be followed by the period of the \"Great Inflation\" until the end of\nthe 1970s and subsequently by the period of \"Great Moderation\" from the early to mid\n2.1 Rise and fall of the Bretton Woods regime\nThe first part of the post-world war II period was marked by the Bretton Woods\nInternational Monetary Regime. The beginning of this stage is characterized by the\ntransition to a regime of convertibility, for current account transactions, by most\nWestern European Countries, in December 1958. It involved the fixing of a par value\nfor each currency in terms of gold. The framers of the system intended to reconcile the\npositive aspects of the classical gold standard (for example exchange rate stability,\nintense international trade) with autonomous national macroeconomic policies. The idea\nwas that currency convertibility would be expected only for current account transactions\n(capital controls were accepted) and that exchange rates would be fixed but adjustable\n(in the face of fundamental disequilibria). According to Garber (1993): \"The collapse of\nthe Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates was one of the most accurately and\ngenerally predicted of major economic events.\" The intuition is that there are intrinsic\nelements of internal tension in any gold exchange standard. Bordo (1993) categorizes\nthe problems under the heading adjustment, liquidity and confidence. One aspect is\nknown as the Triffin (1960) dilemma. The system relied on the convertibility of the US\ndollar into gold. On the other hand it required the availability of US dollars as liquidity.\nThe latter required US balance of payment deficits, thereby undermining (the former)\nconvertibility of the US dollar. The most symbolic moment was, perhaps, the\nsuspension of the convertibility of the dollar into gold, in August 1971. The system then\ncollapsed completely into a system of generalized floating in 1973. With the collapse of\nthe last operational link to gold, the age of a commodity standard was over.\nAccording to a very well-known folk theorem of international monetary economics,\nfixed exchange rates, freedom of movement of financial capital and autonomous\nmonetary policy constitute an impossible trinity. As mentioned above, the Bretton\nWoods regime allowed for capital controls. Nevertheless, over time, in the context of\nfull convertibility for current account transactions, the effectiveness of capital controls\nwas gradually diminishing. The Bundesbank was vividly aware of the constraint that\nparticipation in the Bretton Woods systems imposed on its ability to pursue domestic\nprice stability. During the period 1959-1973 the DM was re-valued three times against\n2.2 The stylized facts\nIn the period 1960-1998, German inflation, measured in accordance with the Consumer\nPrice Index, was, on average, 3.1 per cent per year (with a standard deviation of 1.8\npercentage points). During this period German inflation was the lowest and most stable,\nas recorded internationally (see Table 2.1, which reports the average numbers of key\nmacroeconomic variables for the G7 countries and Switzerland over that period). Only\nSwitzerland came close with an average inflation rate of 3.3 per cent (and a standard\ndeviation of 2.3 percentage points). These results compare with the US that recorded an\ninflation rate of 4.4 per cent, on average per year, with a standard deviation of 2.9\npercentage points. Across the G7 countries inflation was highest and most volatile in\nItaly with, respectively, 7.4 per cent and 5.4 percentage points for annual inflation and\nfor its standard deviation. After the full period the Deutsche Mark (DM) had retained\nabout 30 per cent of its original value, compared with less than 20 per cent for the US\ndollar, the Canadian dollar and the Japanese Yen, about 13 per cent for the French\nFranc, about 8.5 per cent for the Pound Sterling and only about 6 per cent for the Italian\nLira.\nIt is interesting (and instructive) to recall that during the 1960s, in the context of the\nBretton Woods system, inflation was actually slightly higher in Germany than in the\nUS. Specifically, the ten-year average was 2.4 per cent in Germany, while it was 2.3 per\ncent in the US (Canada was very close with an inflation rate of 2.5 per cent).\nNevertheless, in the UK, France, Italy inflation was on average above 3 per cent and in\nJapan above 5 per cent. However, using an average for the sixties can be misleading. In\nthe last years of the sixties, the rise in consumer prices was accelerating in the US with\ncent.\n2 There were also short episodes of floating.\nThe differences between the inflation rates in Germany and the other G7 countries were\nmost marked at the start of the period of floating exchange rates. In fact, in the period\n4.8 per cent). In the same period of eight years, prices almost doubled in the US (with\nan annual average inflation rate of 9 per cent). The differences persisted in the\nsubsequent disinflation. In the longer period 1974-1989 (the year of the fall of the\nBerlin Wall), prices increased by 72 per cent in Germany (with an average annual rate\nof 3.5 per cent) and by 181 per cent in the US (corresponding to an annual average rate\nof 6.7 per cent). It is also worth noting that only in Germany and Switzerland did\ninflation peak at single-digit levels in the 1970s and the 1980s. Italy and the UK\nrecorded two-digit ten-year averages in the 1970s. Italy did so in the 1980s as well (see\nFig. 2.1). Table 2.1 shows that the same comparison also applies to the volatility of\ninflation3.\nGermany's favorable performance applies also to the behavior of nominal interest rates.\nIn Figure 2.2 we show the averages of short-term (3 months) and long-term (10 years)\ninterest rates during the 1970s. Evidently, German interest rates were then at the lower\nend of the interest-rate spectrum.\nRegarding the behavior of real variables, however, it is worth noting that they did not\ndiverge significantly among industrialized countries during the same period. Figure 2.3\nshows that in the 1970s, there was no obvious trade-off between real GDP growth rates\nand inflation across countries.\n2.3 Explanations of the Great Inflation\nTo avoid the accusation of omitting important facts, let us refer briefly to the most\nwidespread explanation of the Great Inflation. According to Bruno and Sachs (1985),\nthe key factor behind the acceleration of prices were the oil price shocks4. Bruno and\nSachs (1985) state (page 7): \"A clear and central villain of the piece is the historically\nunprecedented rise in commodity prices (mainly food and oil) in 1973-74 and again in\n1979-80 that not coincidentally accompanied the two great bursts of stagflation.\" The\ntraditional explanation emphasizes supply shocks and the subsequent demand response.\n3 With some qualification for the case of Canada.\nSupply shocks play the role of the initial exogenous impulse followed by endogenous\nadjustment of the private sector and policy authorities. Barsky and Kilian (2002, 2004)\noffer an alternative reading of the facts. According to their account, oil prices, and other\ncommodity prices, should be seen as responding to global supply and demand factors.\nSpecifically, the authors account for the increase in oil prices in 1973 as a delayed\nadjustment to consistent demand pressure persisting since the late 1960s. The\nadjustment was delayed because during the 1960s oil prices were regulated through\nlong term contracts between oil producers and oil companies. In a situation of clear\nexcess demand at the going price, conditions were ripe for OPEC to renege on its\ncontractual agreements with oil companies leading to much higher oil prices. From such\na viewpoint, it seems plausible that broad upward trends in commodity prices, the\ncollapse of Bretton Woods and the collapse of the oil market regime were all driven by\nexcess demand growth in the late 1960s and the early 1970s. This would be compatible,\nfollowing Barsky and Kilian, with a broad monetary account of the Great Inflation.\nDespite our obvious sympathy for such an account, investigating it is beyond the scope\nof this paper.\nStill, the fact that inflation in the US and other member countries of the Bretton Woods\nSystem accelerated well before the first hike in oil prices supports the hypothesis that\ndemand shocks (among them, increases in government spending) in conjunction with\naccommodative monetary policy prepared the ground for the inflationary surges of the\n1970s. Furthermore, Figure 2.1 suggests that it was the response to the oil price shocks\nof the 1970s that made most of the difference. The Bundesbank did not manage to avoid\nprice acceleration completely (CPI inflation averaged 4.8 per cent during the 1970s) but\nperformed much better than most of all other industrialized countries.5 The remainder of\nthe paper is thus devoted to the question: how did Germany manage to opt out of the\nGreat Inflation?\n5 The differences would be even more striking if one would consider a wider sample of industrialized countries\n(see, for example, Frenkel and Goldstein, 1999, who consider 23 countries).\n3 Sound money and price stability in Germany\n3.1 The legacy of the Bundesbank and stability-oriented monetary policy\nOn 31 December 1998, together with all national central banks joining European\nMonetary Union, the Deutsche Bundesbank ended its life as a central bank responsible\nfor conducting monetary policy for its currency. Combining this period with the term of\nits predecessor, the Bank deutscher L\u00e4nder, the overall period coincides with the\nexistence of the D-Mark.6\nThe D-Mark developed - together with the Swiss Franc - into the most stable currency\nin the world after 1945, and the Bundesbank achieved a reputation as a model of a solid,\nsuccessful central bank. This left a legacy reaching beyond its existence as a central\nbank responsible for a national currency. The statute of the European Central Bank,\nenshrined in the Maastricht Treaty, reflects this fact very well. But it is also fair to say\nthat, in addition, the Bundesbank's track record influenced the world of central banking\non a global scale.\nThis world-wide attention was heavily influenced by the fact that Germany (again\ntogether with Switzerland) avoided the \"Great Inflation\" of the 1970s. What explains\nsuch a superior ability to approach price stability? In this sub-section, we will examine\nthe historical, cultural and institutional background. In the next sub-section, we will\ndevelop a theoretical model which formalizes the Bundesbank's strategy and in section\n5, we will characterize quantitatively the conduct of monetary policy by the\nBundesbank.\nTo explain Germany's post Second World War monetary history one has to go back to\n1948 and even beyond. The institutional foundation was laid in 1948 by law of the allies\n\u00ad (West) Germany did not yet exist as a state - which gave the Bank deutscher L\u00e4nder\nindependence from any political authorities.7 When a few months later the D-Mark was\nintroduced, this institution was entrusted preserving the stability of the new currency.\n6 To be precise: The Bank deutscher L\u00e4nder was established on 1 March 1948. The D-Mark became the\ncurrency of (then) West Germany on 21 June 1948. The Bundesbank replaced its predecessor on 26 July\n7 De jure the Allied Bank Commission could interfere, but never made any use of this prerogative. See\nThe currency reform in cooperation with the simultaneous economic reforms of Ludwig\nEhrhard laid the foundations of (West) Germany's economic success, the so-called\n\"Wirtschaftswunder\" (economic miracle).\nAs a consequence, most Germans for the first time in their life enjoyed a stable\ncurrency. This experience had a deep impact on the mind of the German people. The\nMark, initially (1873) created as a currency based on gold had ended its existence in the\nhyperinflation of 1923 which destroyed Germany's civil society.8 The successor of the\nMark, the Reichsmark, created in 1924 ended its short life with the currency reform of\n1948. People had again lost most of their wealth invested in nominal assets. No wonder\nthat a strong aversion against inflation and a desire for monetary stability became\ndeeply entrenched in the mind of the German people!9 It became so entrenched in\nGermans' expectations, habits and customs that it deserved the special expression\n\"stability culture\". It is interesting to stress the virtuous interaction between Germany's\nstability culture and the independence of the Bundesbank.\nA particular historical episode illustrates it emphatically. The German Constitution of\n1949 required the Government to prepare the Deutsche Bundesbank law. It was no\nsecret that then chancellor Konrad Adenauer was not a friend of an independent central\nbank. However, his clash with the central bank in May 1956 when he criticised in public\nthe increase of the discount rate (from 4.5 to 5.5 percent) \u00ad \"...the guillotine will hit\nordinary citizens...\" had already demonstrated to what extend the media and the public,\nat large, were behind the independence from political interference of the central bank.\nAs a consequence, he lost the battle against the minister of the economy Ludwig Erhard.\nIn the end, the Bundesbank law of 1957 in section 12 stated explicitly that: \"In\nexercising the powers conferred on it by this Act, [the Bundesbank] is independent of\ninstructions from the Federal Government.\" Together with the mandate in section 3 of\n8 Stefan Zweig (1970), a writer, claims in his memoirs of that time that the experience of this total loss of the\nvalue of the currency more than anything else made Germans \"ripe for Hitler\".\n9 It was interesting to see that in the days before the Berlin Wall fell demonstrators in the streets of Leipzig\ncarried posters saying: \"If the D-Mark is not coming to us we will come to the D-Mark\". So this desire for\nstability had also affected the mind of East Germans.\n\"safeguarding the currency\" the Bundesbank Act established the institutional fundament\nfor a stability oriented monetary policy. 10\nNotwithstanding the fact that this law could have been changed at any time by a simple\nmajority of the legislative and insofar seemed to be based on shaky legal ground, the\nreputation of the Bundesbank became such that there was never any serious initiative to\nchange the law. The status of the Bundesbank and the support for its stability oriented\nmonetary policy was firmly grounded on (and, in turn, reinforced) the \"stability culture\"\nAt the time of the ratification of the Bundesbank Act there were not only hardly any\nindependent central banks in the world, it is even difficult to find any serious discussion\nin the literature on the issue of an appropriate institutional arrangement for a central\nbank. Interest in this topic was mainly triggered by the experience of the \"Great\nInflation\" in the 1970s and the more and more obvious failures of monetary policy in\nmany countries. First publications discussed credibility issues (Barro and Gordon) and\nthe time inconsistency problem (Kydland and Prescott). The outcome of monetary\npolicy depending on the statute - here the degree of independence of the central bank -\ncommanded broader attention only in the 1990s, with a paper by Alesina and\nSince, the number of publications on central bank independence has exploded,\ndiscussing all aspects from defining independence, measuring its degree to designing\noptimal contracts for central bankers. Is it wrong to say that the good performance of the\nBundesbank not least in the 1970s has contributed to, if not triggered, this branch of\nresearch?\nThis interest in the topic and the result by more and more research papers has also\nsupported the claim to give independence to the new central bank which still had to be\nfounded, the European Central Bank. One should not forget that some of the countries\nsigning the Maastricht Treaty at that time (1992) still had not given independence to\n10 It is interesting to note that \"safeguarding the currency\" initially referred to the \"domestic\" as well as the\n\"external\" value (i.e. the exchange rate) of the currency. Over time the Bundesbank succeeded in obtaining\ngeneral acceptance of its interpretation of safeguarding the purchasing power of the currency.\n11 See Alesina and Summers (1990). An early paper by Bade and Parkin (1980) was widely ignored and not\neven published.\ntheir own national central banks. Since then \"independence\" of the central bank has\nbecome a model also on a global scale.\nIn a nutshell the message stemming from experience and theory is: Institutions matter!\nThe outcome of monetary policy is heavily dependent on the institutional design of the\ncentral bank.\nAnother aspect of great importance pertained the exchange rate regime (see previous\nsection for a brief reference to the Bretton Woods system and some selected references\nto the relevant literature). For many years, the Bundesbank was in favour of a fixed\nexchange rate of the D-Mark against the US-Dollar. It even argued against the\nappreciation of the D-Mark in 1961. The law of the \"uneasy triangle\" had been more or\nincreasingly apparent that the fixed exchange rate was a constraint for conducting a\nmonetary policy geared towards a domestic goal, namely price stability. (Richter 1999;\nvon Hagen 1999). In a regime of a fixed exchange rate and free capital flows, money\ngrowth becomes endogenous and any attempt to withstand the import of inflation is\nfinally self-defeating.\nThe Bundesbank experienced a period of excessive money growth driven by\ninterventions buying US-Dollars. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the external\ncomponent of money creation was sometimes even higher than the growth of the\nmonetary base, implying that the internal contribution of money creation was negative.\nThe consequences of this constellation for the institutional design of monetary policy\nwere far-reaching: The Bundesbank, notwithstanding its independence from political\ninterference, equipped with all the necessary instruments, was powerless with respect to\npursuing a domestic goal since the exchange rate was fixed and capital flowed freely\nacross borders. This fundamentally changed when in March 1973 Germany let its\ncurrency float against the US-Dollar. The Bundesbank being relieved from its\nobligation to intervene in the exchange market could now consider conducting a\nmonetary policy to safeguard the internal stability of its money, i.e. maintaining price\nstability.\nThe Bundesbank declared the fight against inflation to be the principal goal of its\nmonetary policy12 and, in line with this, had already started to slow down inflation\ncrisis broke out. The rise in oil prices thwarted the efforts of the Bundesbank while real\noutput started to decline at the same time. Being confronted with such a situation, the\nBundesbank attempted to keep monetary expansion within strict limits in order to avoid\npossible spill-over effects into the wage and price-setting. In doing so, it did, however,\nnot commit itself to any clear strategy and quantification.13 Instead, the Bundesbank\nmainly tried to influence the behaviour of market participants by means of \"moral\nsuasion\". However, the social partners more or less ignored the signals given by the\nBundesbank and agreed on high increases in nominal wages in 1974 trying to\ncompensate for the loss in real disposable income. As a consequence unemployment\nincreased and inflation went up.\nAgainst this experience, the idea of adopting a formal quantitative target for money\ngrowth which would provide a nominal anchor for inflation and inflation expectations\nrapidly gained ground. As it happened this period coincided with the \"monetarist\ncounterrevolution.\" The leading monetarists Milton Friedman, Karl Brunner and Alan\nMeltzer claimed that central banks should abstain from any attempt to fine-tune the\neconomy and should instead follow a strategy of monetary targeting. (A floating\nexchange rate was a necessary condition for controlling the money supply.) These ideas\nin principle found positive reactions in Germany (Richter 1999; von Hagen 1999). The\nBundesbank discussed this approach internally and with leading proponents. Helmut\nSchlesinger, member of the Executive Board and chief economist, had an intensive\nexchange of views not least when participating in the intellectually influential Konstanz\nSeminar founded by Karl Brunner in 1970.14 The rejection of fine-tuning and the\nmedium-term orientation of monetary policy implied by monetary targeting was\nstrongly supported also by the German Sachverst\u00e4ndigenrat (1974).\n13 In fact, the Bundesbank tried to ensure that \"monetary expansion was not too great but not to small either\".\nSee Deutsche Bundesbank (1974), Annual Report, especially p. 17.\n14 See Fratianni and von Hagen (2001). The authors give a comprehensive survey on subjects discussed and\npersons attending. The seminar still continues and was chaired for many years by the leading German\nmonetarist Manfred Neumann.\nHowever, in spite of the Bundesbank being the first central bank in the world to adopt a\nmonetary target (for the year 1975), the honeymoon with leading monetarists came soon\nto an end. This process started already when the Bundesbank declared its move to the\nnew strategy \"an experiment\", stressed that it would not (and, in the short run, could\nnot) control the monetary base, and over many years missed its monetary target.\nThe Bundesbank interpreted its approach as a kind of \"pragmatic monetarism\" and kept\n1997, 1999). Not surprisingly, this attitude was heavily criticised especially by Karl\nBrunner (1983). However, in its monetary policy practice, the strategy served the\nBundesbank well in defending the stability of its currency - if not in absolute terms it\ndid at least (together with the Swiss National Bank) substantially better than most other\ncentral banks.\n3.2 The conduct of policy under monetary targeting15\n(a) Derivation of the money growth target\nThe choice of a monetary target in 1974 undoubtedly signalled a fundamental regime\nshift. Not only was it a clear break with the past but also a decision to discard\nalternative approaches to monetary policy.16 There were two main arguments in favour\nof providing a quantified guidepost for the future rate of monetary expansion. First and\nforemost was the intention of controlling inflation through the control of monetary\nexpansion. Second, the Bundesbank tried to provide guidance to agents' (especially\nwage bargainers') expectations through the announcement of a quantified objective for\nmonetary growth.17 Therefore, with its new strategy, the Bundesbank clearly signalled\nits responsibility for the control of inflation. At the same time, the Bundesbank\nexpressed its view, that while monetary policy by maintaining price stability in the\nlonger run would exert a positive impact on economic growth, the fostering of the\neconomy's growth potential should be considered a task of fiscal and structural policies,\n15 Parts of the following section are taken from Issing (2005).\n16 It must be recognized that the start of monetary targeting was characterized by a high degree of uncertainty.\nAfter all, Germany had just come out of the Bretton Woods \"adjustable peg\" system in which many topics\nwere seen as irrelevant.\nwhile employment was a responsibility of the social partners conducting wage\nnegotiations.\nAlthough the formulation of the new strategy was heavily influenced by the ideas of the\nleading monetarists, the implementation of monetary targeting in Germany deviated\nfrom the theoretical blueprint in a number of ways. One important difference was that\nBundesbank did not formulate its targets in terms of the monetary base, but in terms of\na broadly defined monetary aggregate, the central bank money stock (defined as\ncurrency in circulation plus the required minimum reserves on domestic deposits\ncalculated at constant reserve ratios with base January 1974).18 Secondly, the\nBundesbank did not attempt to control the money stock directly, but followed an\nindirect approach of influencing money demand by varying key money market rates\nand bank reserves (two-stage implementation procedure). Thirdly, the Bundesbank\nmade it clear from the beginning that it could not and would not promise to reach the\nmonetary target with any degree of precision. Accordingly, in this period, the new\nregime of monetary targeting was in many respects an experiment.\nFrom the outset, the Bundesbank recognized the importance of adopting a simple,\ntransparent and at the same time comprehensible method for the derivation of the annual\nmonetary targets.19 The analytical background for the derivation formula was provided\nby the quantity theory of money. Starting from the quantity identity, one gets that\naverage money growth, m\n , and average inflation, p\n , will fulfil the identity:\nt\nt\nt\nt\ny\np\nv\nm \n+\n\n\n\n+\nwhere p, m, y and v are the (logs of the) price level, the money stock, real income and\nthe income velocity of money, respectively, and the bars denote long-run average\nvalues. Taking the velocity trend and the long-run average rate of real output growth to\nbe exogenous, it follows from (3.1) that trend inflation can be pinned down by\ncontrolling the trend rate of money growth:\nt\nt\nt\nt\nv\ny\nm\np \n+\n\n-\n\n=\n18 The ratios were 16.6% for sight deposits, 12.4% for time deposits and 8.1% for savings deposits. After the\nmid-eighties, the heavy weight on currency increasingly proved to be a disadvantage, and when setting the\nBased on this reasoning, the Bundesbank derived the target for average money growth\nin year t, *\nt\nm\n , from the sum of the (maximum) rise in prices it was willing to tolerate,\n*\nt\np\n , the predicted growth in potential output, *\nt\ny\nE \n-\n, and the expected trend rate of\nchange in velocity, *\nt\nv\nE \n-\n:\n)\n(\n)\n( *\n*\n*\n*\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nv\nE\ny\nE\np\nm \n-\n\n+\n\n=\n\n-\n-\nwhere the deltas now represent year-on-year changes, and Et-1\ndenotes expectations at\nthe end of year t-1. The target rate for average (year-on-year) money growth was then\ntranslated into a target rate for money growth in the course of the year (see Table 3.2\nThe approach reflected the insight that monetary growth consistent with this derivation\nwould create the appropriate conditions for real growth in line with price stability.\nWhile these basic relationships were uncontested over medium to longer-term horizons,\nthe Bundesbank was fully aware of the fact that they might not strictly apply over the\nshorter term. On a month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter basis and even beyond, the\nbasic relationship between the money stock and the overall domestic price level was\noften obscured by a variety of other factors. Any attempt to strictly tie money growth to\nits desired path in the short-term might have led to disturbing volatility in interest and\nexchange rates, thus imposing unnecessary adjustment costs on the economy.\nAccordingly, the Bundesbank repeatedly pointed to the medium-term nature of its\nstrategy and explained that it was prepared to tolerate short-term deviations from the\ntarget path if that seemed advisable or acceptable in terms of the overriding goal of\nprice stability.\nFirst experiences with monetary targets were not particularly encouraging. Between\n(see Table 3.2). The sharp increase in interest rates which had taken placed immediately\nafter the end of the Bretton Woods System was almost completely reversed in 1974/75\nand real short-term interest rates were kept rather low until the beginning of 1979 (see\nFigure 4.2a). Clarida and Gertler (1997) interpret this as evidence \"that the\nBundesbank's commitment to fight inflation waned somewhat during the period\nbetween the two major oil shocks\". Von Hagen (1999) argues that following the first oil\nprice shock, short-term employment-related goals gained prominence. In the\nBundesbank's own reading, the loosening was mainly motivated by two considerations\nwhich, in hindsight, turned out to be partly based on misjudgments. First, policymakers\napparently overestimated the extent to which the currency appreciation would dampen\nreal activity and inflation. The second misjudgment concerned the depth of the 1975\nrecession, which in hindsight, turned out to have been greatly overestimated (see\nNevertheless, the Bundesbank was able to slow down inflation from the high levels\nbefore to 2.7% in 1978. During this period the Bundesbank gained valuable insights into\nthe new regime and introduced a number of technical modifications (see Table 3.2).\nThese experiences helped the Bundesbank to enhance the monetary targeting concept\nfrom its experimental stage into a fully-fledged strategy. As a consequence, at the end of\n1978, the potential-oriented monetary targeting strategy had been established and had\nproven its value. Therefore, the Bundesbank was well prepared when the German\neconomy entered especially troubled waters.\nThe economic situation in 1978 was broadly seen as rather comfortable. German real\nGDP had grown by around 3 per cent, accompanied by high levels of employment\ngrowth and falling unemployment. The situation was, however, less positive in terms of\nmonetary growth and inflation. Monetary growth had overshot its target and there were\nsigns of acceleration in the rate of inflation, which in 1978 stood, on average, at 2.7%.\nFurthermore, in 1979, the sharp increase in oil prices associated with the second oil\nprice shock hit the German economy. The resulting massive increase in import prices,\nespecially energy prices, augmented by a weakening of the exchange rate, brought about\na turnaround in Germany's current account position, leading to a current account deficit\nin 1979 for the first time in many years.\nAt the same time, government fiscal policy was clearly expansionary. Thus, fiscal\npolicy rendered the central bank's task even more difficult. Moreover, the European\nMonetary System (EMS), an exchange rate regime defining the exchange rates of\nparticipating currencies in terms of central rates against the ECU, had begun rather\nquietly in March 1979, but subsequently faced tensions and the need to adjust parities\nIt was obvious from the beginning that the direct effect of the oil price shock on\nconsumer prices could not be prevented by monetary policy. At the same time, the\nBundesbank had carefully analysed the lessons of the first oil price shock. Against this\nexperience, in 1979 the Governing Council of the Bundesbank was well aware of the\nthreat that the oil price increase could translate again into sustained increases in\ninflation brought about by second-round effects in wage and price-setting.21 In\nresponding to these challenges, the Bundesbank took decisive action. The discount rate\nwas increased in steps from 3 per cent at the start of 1979 to reach 7.5 per cent in May\n1980. In parallel, the Lombard rate was increased from its initial level of 3.5 per cent to\n12 per cent, the normal Lombard window being closed.22 By subsequently reducing the\nmonetary targets from 1979 onwards, the Bundesbank sent out a clear signal for\nrestoring price stability.\nNot until the second half of 1981 did the growth rates for the monetary base begin to\ncome down. Towards the end of 1981, there were increasingly clear signs of an easing\nof price and wage pressures. The D-Mark regained confidence in the foreign exchange\nmarkets and strengthened again, not only within the EMS but also in relation to the US-\nDollar. The external adjustment process was promoted through a slowdown in domestic\ndemand and the current account position improved noticeably. Furthermore, through the\n\"monetary warning\", the government became aware of the unsustainability of its deficit\npolicy. From then on, budget consolidation was increasingly recognized as being an\nurgent task.\nThe subsequent years 1982-85 can be regarded as a phase of monetary relaxation and\nnormalisation. The Bundesbank's monetary policy was focused on bringing down\ninflation and restoring the stability of the currency, and it proved able to realise this aim\nthroughout the period. The benchmark figure for the tolerated rate of inflation (which,\nuntil 1984, was termed the \"unavoidable\" rate of price increase) was gradually reduced\nvirtually reached in the middle of the 1980s, the Bundesbank changed over from the\nconcept of an \"unavoidable\" rate of inflation to a medium-term price norm or price\nassumption of no more than 2% (see Table 3.1).\n(d) The last test \u00ad German reunification\nGiven the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy and the developments described\nabove it is far from surprising that, at the end of the eighties, the Bundesbank was one\nof the most respected central banks in the world. At the beginning of the 1990s, it was\nabout to face an important historical test, in the form of German re-unification.\nThe D-Mark was introduced in the eastern L\u00e4nder on 1 June 1990. Curiously the\nintroduction of the currency preceded political unification (3 October 1990). The\nextension of the territorial scope of monetary policy clearly led to a significant increase\nin uncertainty. Specifically, the operation entailed an increase in money supply of the\norder of 15% of West German money stock. This number compared with about 10%,\nwhich would have been appropriate on the basis of estimates of the relative size of the\nformer GDR's GDP at market prices. Moreover, there were additional factors\nchallenging the conduct of the Bundesbank's stability-oriented policy. In fact, German\nre-unification led to a massive expansion of aggregate expenditure in Germany,\nincluding sizeable general government deficits. As a consequence inflation rose quickly,\nwith price increases (in West Germany) exceeding 4% in the second half of 1991.\nHow could the Bundesbank under these circumstances maintain price stability over the\nmedium term? How could it preserve credibility?\nThe Bundesbank decided to stick to its tried and tested framework, including the\nnormative rate of 2% for inflation. This option implied that the Bundesbank was, for a\nshort time, prepared to accept monetary expansion above the announced target. Again,\nthe money growth targets proved to be highly beneficial in terms of anchoring inflation\nexpectations, even though it was not easy to derive an adequate money growth target for\n22 See Baltensperger (1999) for a more detailed description of this period, the monetary targets and their\nrealisations.\nreunited Germany (see Issing et al., 2005, p. 3f). The Bundesbank abided by its well-\nproven strategy right up to the beginning of EMU in January 1999. While some\ntechnical features of the strategy (e.g. the exact definition of the target variable) were\nchanged over time, its major elements \u00ad the explicit derivation of the annual money\ngrowth targets from medium-term macro-economic benchmark figures, the flexible\nimplementation which included temporary departures from the medium-term rule, and\nthe two-stage implementation procedure- - stayed intact. In this respect, the\nBundesbank's approach certainly stands out by reason of its consistency and remarkable\ncontinuity.\n(e) Lessons\nWhat are the lessons that can be drawn? Why was Germany better able to counter the\ninflationary shocks of the 1970s than most other countries? Several key aspects emerge\nfrom this brief review of German monetary policy after the end of the Bretton Woods\nSystem. To begin with, the Bundesbank was the first central bank to announce a\nmonetary target and thus to undertake a strategy of commitment, transparently\ncommunicated to the public.23 Moreover, when announcing the money growth targets,\nthe Bundesbank disclosed the most important guiding principles behind its decisions,\nsuch as the maximum rise in prices that would be tolerated by the central bank and its\nestimate of potential output growth. By doing so, the Bundesbank fostered transparency\nand provided an anchor for medium-term inflation expectations. In retrospect, against\nthe background of the more recent debate about the merits of an intensive\ncommunication policy, these elements of the Bundesbank's strategy appear very\nmodern indeed.\nAfter the initial years of experimentation, the strategy had proven its value in the\nbaptism of fire of 1979 and the early 1980s. In doing so, it had managed to establish\ncredibility which, in turn, had started to set in motion a virtuous circle. Still, one may\nwell ask \u00ad and indeed, it has often been asked \u00ad how the Bundesbank was able to get\naway with its practice of deviating time and again from the announced targets while at\nthe same time preserving its reputation as a bulwark of monetary stability.24 After all,\neven if one excludes the years 1975-78, the targets were missed seven out of 20 times\nAs explained by Issing (1997, p. 71f), the target misses were rarely of a completely\ninvoluntary nature, but mostly constituted deliberate monetary policy decisions. Yet, it\nwas exactly in those situations that the monetary targets had an especially valuable\ndisciplining effect because once a target was missed the decision makers were put under\npressure to justify the outcome in terms of the ultimate aim of safeguarding the\ncurrency. Similarly, Schlesinger (2002) argues that the targets imposed discipline on the\ndecision makers by forcing them to explain their decisions and to persuade the public\nthat failures to meet the intermediate target did not jeopardise the final goal of policy.\nFinally, according to Neumann (2006, p. 14), \"the Bundesbank was the first central\nbank that provided the public (or at least, an elite audience), with an intelligible\nnumerical framework that facilitated the evaluation of its policy course from the\noutside\". Viewed from this perspective, the money growth targets represented a\nmovement away from purely discretionary policy towards a more rule-based behaviour.\nThe Bundesbank itself has sometimes designated its strategy as constrained or\ndisciplined discretion, Neumann (1997) talks of \"rule-based discretion\".\n4 Monetary targeting as a commitment device\nAs explained in the previous section, the Bundesbank did not attempt to control the\nmoney stock directly, but followed an indirect management procedure which worked\nvia influencing conditions in the money market. Hence, on a basic level, the\nBundesbank's approach may be described as setting the short-tem interest rate so as to\nachieve the rate of money growth that was viewed as consistent with the attainment of\nthe final goal, price stability. In this section, we present a model which formalises this\napproach and enables us to compare the implied interest rate rule with other interest rate\nrules proposed in the academic literature (such as the Taylor rule and its many variants).\nhave discussed the implications of targeting money growth for a central bank which sets\nthe short-term interest rate. Although we know from the previous section that the\nBundesbank's practice of monetary targeting differed from the monetarist blueprint in a\nnumber of ways, it is still instructive to consider the simple case of a \"pure\" or \"strict\"\nmoney growth rule first. Under strict money growth targeting, the central bank is\nrequired to find the short-term interest rate, it\n, which sets the growth rate of money\nequal to the pre-specified target:\n*\nt\nt\nm\nm \n=\nsubject to a money demand relation that relates real money holdings to output and the\n( ) md\nt t y t i t t\nm p y i\n  \nwhere md\nt\n captures short-run dynamics and shocks to money demand. Taking first\ndifferences, the growth rate of money is related to the inflation rate, the change in the\nnominal interest rate and the growth rate of output through\nmt\n= t\n+ y\nyt\n- i\nit\n+  md\nt\n .\nGiven the money demand relation (4.2), equilibrium velocity can be written as\n( )\n* * *\n* * * * *\n* * * *\n( ) , where\nt t t t\nv\nt t t y t i t t\nv\nt y t i t t\nv m p y\nm p y y i\nv y i\n  \n  \n= - - -\n- - = - +  +\n=> = - -  -\nand equilibrium changes in velocity\n* * * *\nt y t i t t\nv y i\n  \nare represented by a function of potential output growth and of changes in the steady-\nsteady level of the nominal interest rate (if there are any). We define the velocity shock\n*\nv\nt\n as a shock to equilibrium money demand. We interpret *\nv\nt\n as a portfolio shock that\ncan be observed by the central bank due to its institutional knowledge.\nAs discussed in the previous section, a central bank with the objective of controlling\nlong-run average inflation will set the money growth target equal to the \"acceptable\"\n25 Such a money demand equation can be derived from the optimization problem of a household who values\nmoney holdings in its utility function that is separable in real balances and consumption goods, see\nrate of inflation, t\n*, adjusted for the predicted growth rate of potential output and the\nexpected trend rate of change in velocity (which is exactly what the Bundesbank did):\nm t\n* = t\n* + Et\nyt\n* - Et\nv t\nNote that in contrast to Eq (3.3), we now assume that the money growth targets are\nbased on current-period expectations of *\nt\ny\n and *\nt\nv\n , which presupposes that the\nmoney growth targets are regularly updated to take account of revisions in the estimates\nof potential output growth and the trend change in velocity.26 From (4.3a) the formula\nfor the money growth target can be reformulated as:\n* * * *.\nv\nt t y t t t\nm E y\n  \nwhere we abstract from changes in the nominal equilibrium interest rate (as the\nCombining (4.2a) and (4.4a), the deviation of money growth from target can now be\nexpressed as:\n{ }\n* * * *\n( ) .\nmd v\nt t t t y t t t i t t t\nm m y E y i\n     \n -  = - +  -  -  +  -  (4.5)\nUsing the equality of actual money growth with target (equation (4.1)) entails:\n{ }\n* * *\nmd v\nt t y t t t i t t t\ny E y i\n     \n- +  -  -  +  -  = (4.6)\nSolving for the nominal interest rate, (4.6) can be transformed into an instrument rule of\nthe form:\n{ }\n* * *\n( ) ( ) md v\nY\nt t t t t t t t t\ni i i\ni i y E y\n\n   \n  \n-\n= + - +  -  +  -  (4.7)\nAccording to (4.7), money growth targeting implies an interest rate reaction to the\nlagged interest rate, to the deviation of inflation from target, to the deviation of actual\noutput growth from (the central bank's estimate of) potential output growth (which is\nequivalent to the change in the output gap), and to the difference between the \"true\"\n26 As regards the Bundesbank, the fact that the targets were usually formulated as a corridor of 2 or 3\npercentage points (see Table 3.2) provided flexibility for adjustments to changes in the underlying estimates.\nIn addition, there was a regular mid-year review of the targets.\nmoney demand shock md\nt\n\n , and the portfolio shock observed by the central bank,\n*\nv\nt\n\n . As pointed out by Orphanides (2003), the interest rate rule implied by (strict)\nmoney growth targeting thus belongs to the class of \"natural-growth targeting rules\",\nwhich do not rely on estimates of the natural rate of interest and output and thus \"stay\nclear of the pitfalls known to plague the natural-rate-gap-based policy approach\" (p.\n990). Notice, however, that in order to be a meaningful specification, which would be\nsuitable for characterizing the practical implementation of monetary policy, the money\ndemand shocks in (4.7) should have reasonable properties. We will discuss this issue in\nmore detail in Section 5 where we present our empirical results.\nHowever, as discussed in the previous section, the Bundesbank did not adhere to a strict\nversion of the Friedman rule, but instead pursued a strategy of \"pragmatic monetarism\".\nMost importantly, the assumption that the central bank hits the money growth target\neach period which underlies Equation (4.1) is at odds with the Bundesbank's acclaimed\nmedium-term orientation and the fact that it tolerated short-term deviations from target.\nAccording to Issing, one of the fundamental functions of a monetary policy strategy is\nto confer credibility to the achievement of the final goal of price stability (see, for\nexample, Issing et al. 2005). In order to incorporate the key issues of credibility,\ncommitment and reputation in our analysis, we choose a framework which allows us to\ninterpret a monetary target as a commitment device. Specifically, we assume that the\nBundesbank council re-optimized the setting of the policy instrument(s) every period,\nthat is, it acted under discretion. However, in our reading, policymakers were aware of\nthe problems associated with discretionary policy and used monetary targeting as a\ndevice to get closer to the optimal (but time-inconsistent) commitment solution. In\nparticular, we assume that when setting interest rates, the objective of the Bundesbank\ncouncil was to minimize deviations of inflation and money growth from target, while\nalso seeking to stabilize output and the interest rate around their respective target\n28 In the loss function (4.8), we have abstracted from the complications arising from a gap between the efficient\nand the natural level of output, but one should keep in mind that with a positive value of x*, the optimal\ndiscretionary policy suffers from an average inflation bias as well as a stabilisation bias; see Woodford,\n[ ]\n\n\n=\n\n-\n\n+\n-\n+\n+\n-\n*\n*\n*\n)\n(\n^\n)\n(\n^\n^\n)\n(\nt\nt\nt\nm\nt\nt\ni\nt\nx\nt\nt\nt m\nm\ni\ni\nx\n\u00df\nE \n\n\n\nwhere \u00df is the discount factor, xt\nis the output gap defined as the gap between actual\noutput, yt\n, and potential output, yt\n*, and\nx\n\n^ ,\ni\n\n^ and\nm\n\n^ are the relative weights attached\nto the output, interest rate and money growth terms.\nThe use of a modified loss function to attenuate the pitfalls associated with discretionary\nmonetary policy was pioneered by Rogoff (1985). More recently, several authors have\nanalysed the properties of monetary policy strategies based on modified loss functions\nin the context of forward-looking new Keynesian-type models. There are many variants\nof modified loss functions including, price level targeting (Svensson, 1999, Vestin,\nFor our purposes, the most closely related contribution in the literature is S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m\n(2005) who analyses the implications of delegating a loss function to the central bank\nwhich deviates from society's true loss function by an additional money growth target.\nAs shown by S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m, this modification can be beneficial for a central bank acting\nunder discretion since the money growth target introduces interest rate inertia and\nhistory dependence into interest rate decisions, both of which are features of the optimal\ncommitment policy. In S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m's baseline simulations, a money growth target closes\nabout 80% of the gap between discretionary policy and the optimal policy under pre-\ncommitment. This result is the more remarkable given the fact that it is obtained in the\ncontext of a standard New Keynesian model where money growth is neither useful as\nan indicator of future inflation nor of output growth, and where money plays no direct\nrole in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.\nNevertheless, our objective differs from S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m's. Specifically, we want to derive\nthe interest rate rule characterizing optimal discretionary policy under the modified loss\nfunction (4.8). In our reading, this loss function captures some relevant dimensions of\nthe Bundesbank's approach of pragmatic monetarism. Most importantly, it accounts for\nmisses of the monetary target in the context of a strategy where monetary growth is\nalways important for monetary policy-making. Hence, we expect the interest rate rule\nimplied by this loss function to provide a useful starting point for the empirical analysis\nundertaken in Section 5.\nIn order to derive the interest rate rule implied by the modified loss function (4.8), we\nneed a model of the underlying structural relationships between the target variables. To\nkeep the analysis as simple as possible, we assume that these relationships are\nadequately captured by the standard New Keynesian model which, despite its well-\nknown limitations, is the workhorse in the theory of monetary policy-making.\nSpecifically, we use the baseline version of the model which consists of an aggregate\nsupply and an aggregate demand equation, augmented by the simple money demand\n* *\n( )\nt t t t t t t\n\u00df E x u\n    \n+ +\n)\n(\nn\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nr\nE\ni\nx\nE\nx -\n-\n-\n=\n+\n+\n\n( ) md\nt t y t i t t\nm p y i\n  \nwhere \nt\nu is a cost-push shock and \nt\nr is a natural-rate shock.

While we do not want to take that route here, it is possible\nto gain important insights into the nature of the policy problem by considering the\nanalytical solution to the much simpler static version of the problem.32 Hence, in what\nfollows we assume that when taking interest rate decisions, the Bundesbank Council\nwas concerned only with minimizing the current period loss function, taking private\nsector expectations as given.

However, the inclusion of a money\ngrowth term in the loss function implies an additional interest rate response to\ndeviations of money growth from target. Interestingly, the Euler equations (\"targeting\nrules\") derived by Dennis (2007) for the case of fully optimal discretionary policy take\nessentially the same form as Eq (4.15). This suggests that the functional form of the\npolicy rule (4.15) is not specific to the simple one-period optimization problem\nconsidered here, but carries over to the much more complex intertemporal optimization\nproblem.33 Note, however, that in order to apply the Dennis algorithm to the problem\ndescribed by Eq (4.12), the model has to be extended to include the first difference of\nthe interest rate in the vector of endogenous variables.34 As a consequence, under fully\noptimal discretionary policy, the current interest rate will be a function of the first\ndifference of the interest rate as well as of all the variables included in Eq (4.15).\nIn order to test whether the Bundesbank attached any weight to its money growth\ntargets (relative to other potential targets), we could stop the analysis here and estimate\nEq (4.15) directly. This is the route taken by most empirical studies, such as Clarida et\nal.(1998). However, in order to make the policy rule implied by the modified loss\nfunction (4.8) more directly comparable with other types of simple interest rate rules,\nwe do not follow this approach here, but instead repeat the above exercise and eliminate\nthe money growth term from Equation (4.15). The process of elimination of money\ngrowth deviations from the policy rule mimics the steps we have taken above for the\ncase of pure money growth targeting. To simplify the procedure, we first re-write Eq\n)\n(\n)\n( *\n*\n*\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nm\nm\nx\ni\ni \n-\n\n\n\n+\n-\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n= \nwith\ni\n\n^\n=\n , \n\nx\n^\n=\n , \n=\n\n, )\n(\n^\ni\nm\n\n\n\n +\n+\n=\n\nand then use Eq (4.11) to substitute out the money growth term:\n( )\nt\nt\ni\nt\ny\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\ni\nx\nx\ni\ni \n\n\n\n\n\n \n+\n\n-\n\n+\n-\n\n\n+\n-\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n= *\n*\n* )\nFinally, solving for it\n, we get:\n( ) ( )\n( )\n( ) ( )\n*\n*\n(\n-\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n-\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n+\n\n\n=\nt\ni\ni\nt\ni\nt\ni\ny\nt\nt\ni\nt\ni\nt\ni\nt\ni\nx\nx\ni\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to (4.18), the interest rate rule of a central bank that targets money growth\ndiffers from a standard Taylor rule in that it implies a response to the deviation of actual\noutput growth from potential output growth (which is equivalent to targeting the change\n34 The model is closed by including the definition of the additional variable, 1\n-\n-\n=\n\nt\nt\nt\ni\ni\ni , among the model\nequations. See Dennis (2007), Technical Appendix.\nin the output gap) as well as a response to the lagged interest rate and to the difference\nbetween the \"true\" money demand shock and the portfolio shock observed by the\ncentral bank. As shown by Giannoni and Woodford (2003), responding to the lagged\ninterest rate (interest rate inertia) and to the change rather than the level of the output\ngap (history dependence) are both features of the optimal commitment policy. (4.18)\ntherefore nicely illustrates the argument put forth by S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m (2005) that money\ngrowth targeting may play a useful role in overcoming the stabilisation bias of\ndiscretionary policy. The response to money demand shocks implied by Eq (4.18) is\nusually viewed as a major drawback of monetary targeting. However, it cannot be\nestablished a priori how serious this problem is when the central bank takes into\naccount portfolio shifts when implementing monetary targeting (as routinely practiced\nby the Bundesbank ). In section 5 we attempt to look at the relevant empirical evidence.\nEquation (4.18) is the basis for the interest rate rule that we will estimate in the next\nsection.35 As before, the intuition presented is predicated on some restrictions on the\nbehavior of the error term in the money demand equation. We will further discuss the\nissue in section 5 below.\n5 The Conduct of Monetary Policy and Monetary Policy Rules\nIn this section, our goal is to provide a systematic comparison of policy rules followed\nin Germany, the US and the UK. To allow for a fair comparison, our aim was to use\nmodel specifications for each of the three countries that are as similar as possible\nregarding the dynamic structure and the corresponding variables. In order to provide a\nmore precise characterization of systematic differences in the conduct of monetary\npolicy, we estimate and compare interest rate reaction functions. The specification of\nthe estimated reaction functions is based on the interest rate rule derived in the previous\nsection, which includes the elements of a standard Taylor rule as well as the features\nimplied by including a money growth target in the loss function.\n35 In the simple model above we do not consider lags in monetary transmission. In the empirical results we will\nsee that forecast inflation performs better than current inflation. Transmission lags can rationalize such result\n(see comments in section 5).\n5.1 Brief reference to the literature\nThere is a voluminous literature about monetary policy reaction functions, especially as\nregards the US. According to the established view, there was a regime shift around\nOctober 1979 (the start of the Volcker disinflation)36. The broad strand of the empirical\nliterature sees the main difference between the pre-Volcker period and the Volcker-\nGreenspan period as pertaining to the interest response to an increase in inflation (or\nexpected inflation). Specifically, the claim is that the coefficient, measuring the interest\nrate response to inflation was significantly below unity during the pre-Volcker period\nand significantly above unity in the later period. An inflation coefficient below unity\ncorresponds to accommodative monetary policy as real interest rates decline in response\nto an inflation increase (see, for example, Clarida et al., 1998, 2000 or Lubik and\nSchorfheide, 2004). In other words, before 1979 US monetary policy does not comply\nwith the Taylor principle. Characterization of monetary policy in the interim period,\nbetween 1979 and 1982, is difficult as it seems dominated by transition dynamics\ninduced by the Fed's monetary experiment. Moreover, the Fed's policy response to\neconomic slack also seems difficult to pin down. Orphanides (2003, 2004) goes as far as\nto argue that the key distinction does not involve the response to expected inflation, but\nrather the response to policymakers' real-time perceptions of real activity (excess\ndemand). Using real-time data to re-estimate the Fed's policy rule, he finds that, prior to\nVolcker's appointment, policy was too responsive to perceived output gaps.\nSpecifically, loose monetary policy was a consequence of responding strongly to\noverestimations of economic slack. More recent papers (Boivin, 2006, Kim and Nelson,\n2006, Partouche, 2007), using a time-varying coefficients framework, find important,\nbut gradual changes in the Fed's response to both inflation and real activity, not\nproperly accounted for by the typical split-sample approach.\n5.2 A comparison of empirically estimated policy rules\nAs a starting point for a comparative analysis of German and US monetary policy\nreaction functions during the Great Inflation, it is useful to take another look at the\nrelative inflation performance of the two countries from the mid-1960s to the early\nwas stopped by quick disinflation which preceded the Volcker disinflation by about six\nyears. Still, the dating of the regime shift is not as straightforward for Germany as it is\nfor the US, where the appointment of Paul Volcker as Chairman provides an obvious\ndate for a structural break. Two potential candidates are the breakdown of the Bretton\nWoods System in March 1973 and/or the official start of the monetary targeting regime\nin 1975Q1.37 However, most studies on the Bundesbank's reaction function, including\nlater date, namely 1979Q1, as the starting point of their analysis. The reason for doing\nso can best be understood by comparing the behaviour of real interest rates and inflation\nduring the period in question.\nAs shown in Figure 5.2, pre-1979 the US real rate steadily declines as inflation rises,\nbecoming persistently negative during most of the seventies. In late 1979, the real rate\nrose sharply, leading to a subsequent decline in inflation. This observation provides the\nrationale for the analysis in Beyer and Farmer (2007). They argue that the source of the\ninflation build- up in the 1970s was a downward drift in the real interest rate that was\ntranslated into a simultaneous increase in unemployment and inflation by passive Fed\npolicy. For Germany, the picture is different. Real interest rates rose sharply after the\nbreak-down of the Bretton Woods System in March 1973. Moreover, real interest rates\nwere (almost) always significantly positive throughout the period. Nevertheless, the\nearly increase in real interest rates was almost completely reversed in 1974/75 and the\nreal rate was kept rather low until the beginning of 1979 (data: inflation measured by\nCPI inflation against previous quarter, real rates calculated by subtracting period t+1\ninflation from three-month money market rates, three-quarter centered moving\naverages). Overall, however, the visual comparison between the conduct of monetary\npolicy in Germany and the US in the 1970s suggests loose monetary policy in the latter\ncountry, but not in Germany.\nIn the remainder of this section, our aim is to characterize differences in monetary\npolicy in terms of differences in the estimated monetary policy reaction functions. In\norder to be better able to capture empirical regularities, we extend the interest rate rule\n36 See Beyer and Farmer (2007) for an econometric investigation and Gaspar et al. (2006) for an analytical\nnarrative drawing on the documentary evidence provided in Lindsey et al.(2005).\n37 The Bundesbank had already established an internal monetary target for its own orientation for the year 1974\nderived in the previous section - Eq (4.18) - in two directions. First, the theoretical\nmodel of Section 4 was silent on the frequency of the data, but it is usually taken to\ndescribe regularities observed in quarterly data and in quarterly rates of change.\nHowever, when applying the model to the Bundesbank's monetary policy, we have to\ntake account of the fact that the Bundesbank's money growth targets were annual\ntargets which referred to money growth over the previous four quarters. Hence, in the\nempirical application of Eq (4.18), we extend the time horizon of the inflation and\noutput growth variables to annual (four-quarter) rates of change. Secondly, we allow for\nforward-looking behaviour on part of the policymakers, that is, we allow them to focus\non expected rather than current inflation. This modification of Eq (4.18) can be\nrationalised by lags in the transmission of monetary policy impulses which are not\naccounted for in the baseline New Keynesian model.38 Thirdly, in order to capture\ninterest rate dynamics not accounted for by the first lag of the interest rate, we also\nincluded the second lag of the interest rate among the endogenous variables. Hence, we\nstart from a specification of the following form:\n* *\n* *\n(( ) ) (( ) )\n( ( ) ) ( )\na\nt n t t t t\nt t t t\nmd v\nt t t t t\ny\n\u00dfE E y y\ni i i u\nE y y\n   \n   \n\n  \n\n+\n- -\n \n+ -  + - \n \n= - - + + +\n \n+  -  +  -\n \n \nwhere )\n(\nt\na\nn\nt\nE \n+\n is policymakers' inflation forecast for period t+n formed in t on the\nbasis of the information available at time t, a denotes annual inflation, )\n)\n(( *\nt\nt\nt\ny\ny\nE \n-\nis policymakers' estimate of the current output gap, again formed on the basis of\ninformation available at the time,\nt\nu is an error term and 4\ndenotes changes over the\nprevious four quarters. An important issue is the method used to generate the forecasts\nof inflation, the output gap and the output growth gap. Unfortunately, as regards the\nBundesbank, real-time forecasts of these variables over the relevant time horizons and\nat the appropriate frequency do not exist. Therefore, we follow the method first\nproposed by McCallum (1976) and proxy the unobserved forecasts by the\n38 Strictly speaking, this argument is valid only for the part of the interest rate response to inflation which\nderives directly from the inflation stabilization objective in the loss function (4.8). Therefore, we also\nestimated specifications of the interest rate reaction function which allow for a response to current as well as\nexpected future inflation. However, not surprisingly, in these exercises one of the two terms usually drops\nout.\ncorresponding realizations (see Clarida et al., 1998). Hence, the error term ut\nis a linear\ncombination of the forecast errors and the exogenous disturbance term. In order to keep\nthe forecast errors as small as possible, we use the initial (unrevised) figures on inflation\nand output as well as the first available estimates of the output gap.39 To avoid\nendogeneity problems, these variables are instrumented by a vector of variables It\nwhich\nwere part of policymakers' real-time information sets and which are orthogonal to the\nerror term\nt\nu (for details on the instrument sets, see Table 5.1-5.3).\nFinally, for empirical tractability, the model requires a sufficiently stable empirical\nmoney demand function. Reviewing the empirical literature on money demand we are\nconfident that this condition is fulfilled as there is broad evidence for the existence of\nsufficiently stable cointegrated money demand models. In conventional cointegrated\nmoney demand models money is usually explained by output (e.g. GDP, serving as a\nscale variable), and one or more suitable interest rate variables that represent own rates\nand opportunity costs for holding money. Derivations of actual money from the long-\nrun money demand relationship *\n( )\nm m\n- are then interpreted as stationary (i.e.\ntransitory) money demand shocks, corresponding to the level of\nt\nexample, Beyer (1998) finds a stable cointegrated long run money demand function for\nThe standard deviation of their first differences is 4.6%, compared with a standard\ndeviation of 3.5% for the year-on-year growth rate of money. Similarly, Baba et\nal.(1992) find a stable long-run money demand function for US M1 for the sample\napproximation for empirically estimating our modified theoretical Taylor rule (4.18).\nWe first report our findings for Germany which are summarized in Table 5.1. The\nestimates are based on the real-time data set described in Gerberding et al. (2004). In\norder to compare the conduct of monetary policy in Germany before and after the\ncollapse of Bretton Woods, the data set was extended backwards to 1965 so that it now\n40 Using annual data Hendry and Ericsson (1991b) find a stable long-run money demand function for US M1\nunambiguous results, we present estimates for three different break points, with the\n1978Q4, respectively. In Table 5.1, we only report results for a forward-looking\nspecification of the reaction function where the horizon of the inflation forecast variable\nhas been set to four quarters. However, in order to check the robustness of the results to\nchanges in the horizon of the inflation variable, we conducted the exercise for different\nhorizons of the inflation forecast, reaching from n=0 to n=4, and found that the results\nwere qualitatively the same.42 Our estimations also established that the term\n*\n( )\nmd v\nt t\n \n -  does not play a major econometric role. In theory, this term is\nunobservable. Point estimates and standard errors of regressors in model (5.1) remain\nvirtually unaffected whether an empirical proxy of that term is included or not.\nHowever, as part of a money demand shock this error variable has interesting policy\nimplications which we will discuss further below (see 5.3).\nThe analysis yields a number of interesting results. First, we find that the coefficient \u00df,\nwhich captures the interest rate response to inflation, is significantly below one before\nthe introduction of monetary targeting (that is, for the sample periods 65Q1-73Q1 and\n65Q1-74Q4, respectively), but significantly above one afterwards (that is, for the\nsamples starting in 75Q1 and later). Note, however, that the standard error of the\ninflation coefficient and of the equation is lowest for the (arguably more stable) 1979-\n1998 period. From this, we conclude that the Bundesbank respected the Taylor principle\n(responded to a rise in (expected) inflation in a stabilizing way) right from the\nbeginning of the monetary targeting regime. This contrasts with empirical estimates of\nstandard Taylor rules for the US over the 1970s. Second, the response to the perceived\noutput gap, 1\n, is significantly positive with point estimates about 0.5 in the Bretton\nWoods/pre-Monetary Targeting sub-samples. By contrast, it is close to zero and\ninsignificant under monetary targeting. If one follows Orphanides (2003), the lack of\n41 The first vintage of Bundesbank estimates of potential output that we were able to reconstruct dates from\nApril 1972 (Bundesbank, AR 1971). In order to go back beyond this date, we proxied the unavailable \"true\"\nreal-time data by the estimates dating from April 1972. We think this justifiable since there are no\nindications of major revisions during the time span 1965-1972. For instance, the estimates of the German\nestimates that we reconstructed from the April 1972 vintages of Bundesbank data on actual and potential\noutput.\n42 Results available from authors on request.\nresponse to real-time estimates of the output gap, which at the time were heavily biased\ndownwards in most countries, may also have been an important reason for Germany's\nsuperior inflation performance after the regime shift. Thirdly, the coefficient on the\noutput growth gap, which is insignificant before the introduction of monetary targeting,\nbecomes highly significant afterwards. According to our theoretical model, this is an\nimportant feature which distinguishes the Bundesbank's policy under monetary\ntargeting from a purely discretionary approach. Hence, we interpret this result as\nevidence that the money growth targets did bring the Bundesbank policy closer to the\n(otherwise not feasible) optimal commitment solution. Fourthly, we find a significant\ndegree of interest rate inertia, captured by , in all sub-sample periods, with point\nestimates about 0.6 before and about 0.8 after the regime change. The high degree of\ninertia after the regime shift is in accordance with the predictions of the theoretical\nmodel as well as with the Bundesbank\u00b4s often professed preference for conducting\npolicy with a steady hand (\"Politik der ruhigen Hand\").43\nTables 5.2a and b present the results for a very similar formulation for the US. We use\nthe three months T-Bill rate as a short term interest rate. Regarding the explanatory\nvariables, inflation is again measured by year-on-year changes in CPI. For the output\ngap, )\n( *\nt\nt\ny\ny - , we use the real-time perceptions of the US output gap reconstructed by\nOrphanides (2003). We report results for annual changes in the output gap as well as for\nits quarterly changes. Notice, that for the US we normalize the inflation target *\n at\nzero. For the forward-looking element, we use inflation expectations one period ahead\nthat are formed at period t. In Table 5.2a, we use real-time inflation forecasts based on\nof revised inflation data. For interest rate smoothing we restricted ourselves to reporting\nthe case of one lag only44.\nFor analyzing the US we follow the strategy that is common in the empirical literature\nand estimate over samples that correspond to the chairmanships of Burns - Miller and\nthe inclusion of an AR(1)-model for the error term.\nperiod\"). The omitted interim period is characterized by transitional dynamics and does\nnot yield useful estimates.\nWe are able to reproduce a number of well known findings. First, for real time inflation\nforecast data (see Tab. 5.2a) we can replicate Orphanides' (2003) findings with a Taylor\ncoefficient greater than unity also in the Burns-Miller period whereas for revised\ninflation data (Tab. 5.2b) the Taylor coefficient on inflation is significantly below unity\nin the Burns-Miller period and significantly above one in the Volcker-Greenspan\nperiod. Second, the coefficient on the lagged interest rate is much larger in the latter\nperiod (becoming close to one). Third, and focusing on formulation with the annual\nmeasure of the change in the output gap, the coefficient on the output gap is always\nsignificant, at the 5% level, except for the Volcker \u00ad Greenspan period in case of\nquarterly changes of the output gap (see Tab. 5.2b, 3rd row). Regarding the history\ndependence of monetary policy we find significant differences between the US and\nGermany. For the US the coefficients for both, quarterly or annual changes in the output\ngap is insignificant during the 1970s. Conversely, it is highly significant during the\n1980s and 1990s whereas for Germany it is significant throughout the entire post-\nBretton Woods sample period. The comparison of the models for Germany and the US\nbetween Table 5.1 and Table 5.2a,b therefore suggests that the conduct of monetary\npolicy in the US and Germany differed during the 1970s but after 1983, US monetary\npolicy approached the practice that the Bundesbank followed since 1975.\nTurning to the case of UK, already from eyeballing Figures 2.1-3 one would expect,\nwith respect to Germany but to a lesser extent also to the US, very different empirical\nresults for any estimated Taylor rule. Compared to US and Germany inflation in UK\npeaked highest, interest rates during the 1970s were at a much higher level whereas\ngrowth performance was comparatively much weaker than in US or Germany. In order\nto explain the UK three-month T-bill rate, we use the real-time perceptions of the UK\noutput gap reconstructed by Nelson and Nikolov (2003). For future inflation we use\nrevised data, analogue to Table 5.2b for the US. The results in Table 5.3 confirm our\npriors. Interest rates in the 1970s appear to follow a near-unit root process. Neither\noutput nor inflation gap are remotely significant. This changes only later in the 1980s\n44 We also estimated the models with two lags and got very similar quantitative and the same qualitative results\ncompared to the one lag only specification.\nand 1990s, when the output gap remains insignificant but the Taylor coefficient on\ninflation is estimated rather tightly at 1.5.\n5.3 The role of money demand shocks\nAs pointed out in the previous subsection, dealing with the term )\n( *\nv\nt\nmd\nt\n\n \n-\n has\ninteresting policy implications. The term represents those (exogenous) changes in\nmoney demand that are not identified and accounted for by the central bank. Ignoring\nthis term in the empirical model implies an assumption that the central bank \u00ad in our\ncase the Bundesbank - did not make systematic mistakes in identifying shocks to money\ndemand. Under this assumption, the variable )\n( *\nv\nt\nmd\nt\n\n \n-\n will be a white noise (or at\nleast stationary) process which can be subsumed as, say,\nt\nu\n% , into the error term of Eq\n(5.1). However, we are aware that our framework also has testable implications for the\nBundesbank's response to unidentified disturbances to money demand.45 Specifically,\nwe would expect to find that policy was tightened in response to an increase in this\nvariable and vice versa. Unfortunately, since we do not have reliable information on the\nmagnitude of the portfolio shocks observed by the Bundesbank, in real time, *\nv\nt\n , we\ncannot test this hypothesis directly. However, as a robustness check, we conducted an\nalternative test which is based on the assumption that the Bundesbank was able to\nidentify a fraction  of the \"true\" money demand shock so that md\nt\nv\nt\n\n =\n* holds. Under\nthis assumption, we can rewrite Eq (5.1) as:\n* *\n(( ) ) (( ) )\n( ( ) ) (1 )\na\nt n t t t t\nt t t t\nmd\nt t t t\ny\n\u00dfE E y y\ni i i u\nE y y\n   \n   \n\n  \n\n+\n- -\n \n+ -  + - \n \n= - - + + +\n \n+  -  + - \n \n \nwhere  denotes the fraction of the \"true\" money demand shock that the Bundesbank\nwas able to identify. In the special case when 1\n = the Bundesbank could identify all\nshocks as portfolio shocks, whereas if 0\n = the shock to money demand remained\nunreduced. Using the residuals from the money demand model of Beyer (1998) to\nestimate Eq (5.1a), we find that the coefficient  is highly significant, with a point\nestimate of 0.77.46 On the other hand, the fact that our estimate of  is also significantly\n45 We thank our discussant Benjamin Friedman bringing this important point to our attention. .\n46 Results available from Andreas Beyer on request.\ndifferent from one suggests that the Bundesbank did react to shocks to money demand\nwhich it was unable to identify in real time. Specifically, when money growth increased\nas a consequence of a non-identified disturbance to money demand, the Bundesbank\nwould tighten policy, in contrast with what would be the case under perfect information.\nThis empirical finding is in line with the testable implication from the theoretical model\npresented in the previous section. Nevertheless, the relatively high value of  suggests\nthat the Bundesbank was able to identify most money demand disturbances in real time.\nHence, it responded to such shocks in a much muted way, thereby limiting the volatility\nof policy rates.\nTo sum up, the empirical results for Germany, US, and UK suggest that monetary\npolicy in the three countries was conducted very differently in the 1970s. For Germany\nand US estimating a Taylor rule for that period produces reasonable results but reveals\ndifferent policy strategies. Money as a commitment device has worked well for\nGermany and is reflected by a significant coefficient in changes of the output gap\nvariable. For the US we do not find any similar history dependence in the data for the\nsharp contrast, monetary policy in the UK has been very different both with respect to\nUS and Germany. Our empirical findings do not allow for any Taylor-type\ncharacterization of UK monetary policy in the 1970s and only very vaguely for the\n6 Conclusion\nIn this paper we examine an important episode in European monetary history. We\ninvestigate the conduct of monetary policy in Germany in the 1970s and the 1980s. It\nwas during this period that the Bundesbank acquired its credibility and reputation as a\nbulwark against inflation. Our goal was to illustrate how the monetary growth targeting\nstrategy, followed by the Bundesbank since 1975, contributed to this success. We\nwanted, as much as possible, to examine the strategy as conceived, communicated and\nrefined by the Bundesbank itself. Naturally we are not able to do full justice to the\nBundesbank's approach. We can only present a simplified (stylized) view of the conduct\nof monetary policy in that period.\nNevertheless, we think that by focusing on anchoring inflation and inflation\nexpectations, we capture a fundamental aspect of the interaction between monetary\npolicy and the behavior of economic agents. Using a standard new Keynesian model\nand a modified loss function (incorporating money growth deviations) we are able to\nexplain the role of money growth targeting as a commitment device. Under some mild\nconditions regarding the existence of a stable money demand function which are\nfulfilled at least for Germany for the time period under consideration, we are able to\nderive a role for money as a commitment device, succeeds even in the context of the\nnew Keynesian model (in which money plays no active role).\nThe operation of monetary growth targeting as a commitment device is compatible with\ntarget misses, even repeatedly. In the modified loss function framework monetary\ngrowth targeting is permanently relevant and imposes structure on the monetary policy\nreaction function. Nevertheless, given that monetary deviations from target have to be\ntraded off against other arguments in the loss function frequent deviations from target\ncannot be excluded. In practice, the Bundesbank had to account for the determinants of\nobserved deviations and explain how, in the end, it would deliver on the final goal of\nprice level stability.\nA standard objection to monetary targeting is that it induces unwarranted volatility in\npolicy rates in response to unidentified disturbances to money demand. In the context of\nour theoretical model, it is the case that the central bank will tighten in response to non-\nobserved positive shocks to money demand. Empirically, we find this holds true for the\nBundesbank. Nevertheless, empirical evidence shows that money demand was stable in\nGermany during the period. Moreover, the Bundesbank appears to have been able to\ntake into account most special factors in real time. Hence, the response of policy to\nmoney demand disturbances was much attenuated, limiting the relevance of this concern\nfor the historical performance of the Bundesbank.\nIssing in his Stone Lecture (Issing et al., 2005) affirms: \"The Bundesbank missed its\ntarget roughly half of the time ... This does not mean, however, that the Bundesbank\ndid not take monetary targets seriously. On the contrary, money growth targets were\nregarded as constituting the basis for a rules-oriented approach to monetary policy.\nAnnouncing a monetary target implied a commitment by the Bundesbank towards the\npublic. Deviations of money growth from the target had always to be justified. Even if it\nis true that the reputation of the Bundesbank ultimately was achieved by its success in\nfulfilling its mandate to safeguard the stability of its currency, its final goal, current\npolicy continuously had to be justified in the context of its pre-announced strategy. In\nthis sense, the strategy contributed to the transparency, the accountability and the\ncredibility of Bundesbank's policy.\"\nFrom our theoretical framework we derive an interest rate rule. Using real-time data, we\nfind that it closely approximates the monetary policy, as it was conducted by the\nBundesbank, in the period of 1975 to 1998. The main finding is that the Bundesbank\nresponse to the output growth gap was highly significant. Such response is a\ncharacteristic of the conduct of monetary policy under commitment. It is also robust\npolicy against problems in the measurement of the level of potential output in real time.\nA similar response to the growth gap was not present in the reaction function of the\nFederal Reserve System during the Burns-Miller period. It does become significant, for\nthe US, in the later Volcker-Greenspan period. We were able to characterize systematic\nmonetary policy for Germany and the US. Our empirical findings suggest a much less\nstable approach in the UK.\nReferences\nAlesina, A. and Summers, L.
