It is noteworthy, however, that many of\nthe arguments presented for greater sharing of data are\ngrounded in empirical claims about its potential to generate\nmore and better science and to enable more efficient use of\nresearch resources for the greater good. In principle, these\nclaims are amenable to testing and evaluation. It may be that\nsome approaches to data sharing are more likely to promote\neffective and efficient research than others, and it is also pos-\nsible that the most effective and sustainable approach may vary\nbetween settings and different forms of data or research. One\nfactor in the sustainability of any approach to data sharing is\nlikely to be the extent to which it is compatible with enduring\ncollaborative partnerships between researchers in their capac-\nity as data producers and/or data users. Another related factor\nis likely to be the extent to which proposed approaches to data\nsharing reflect a reasonable alignment between the mandate\nfor data-sharing claimed, often in the \"public interest\" by\nresearchers, research funders and journals, and the social\nlicense important stakeholders, including research participants,\ncommunities, research ethics committees, and the wider public\nwould consider themselves to have given for data sharing\nWhere the social license for sharing individual-level\ndata from clinical and public health research and the man-\ndate claimed by research actors are reasonably well-aligned,\nthere may be grounds for confidence that more effective\ndata sharing will indeed lead to more successful and appro-\npriate scientific research. Where, however, there is a signifi-\ncant gap between them, it seems less likely that the\nwidespread adoption of data-sharing practices will be sup-\nported without significant investment of time and resources\ninto the building of trust and confidence. Moreover, where\nthere is a lack of support from the public, key data gover-\nnors (such as research ethics committees), researchers, and\nresearch institutions, there is good reason to hypothesize\nthat research progress may be undermined by lack of trust\nand/or confidence.\nWhile important in all research settings, such consider-\nations are likely to be particularly important, both morally\n1University of Oxford, UK\n2Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand\n3University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa\n4KEMRI Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Nairobi, Kenya\n5Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam\n6Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action, Mumbai, India\n7Children's Hospital 1, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam\n8University College London, UK\n9Thammasat University, Bangkok, Thailand\nCorresponding Author:\nSusan Bull, Ethox Centre, Nuffield Department of Population Health,\nUniversity of Oxford, Old Road Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, UK.\nEmail: susan.bull@ethox.ox.ac.uk\nBest Practices for Ethical Sharing of\nIndividual-Level Health Research Data From\nLow- and Middle-Income Settings\nSusan Bull1, Phaik Yeong Cheah1,2, Spencer Denny3, Irene Jao4, Vicki Marsh1,4,\nLaura Merson5, Neena Shah More6, Le Nguyen Thanh Nhan7, David Osrin8,\nDecha Tangseefa9, Douglas Wassenaar3, and Michael Parker1\n Keywords\nbiomedical research ethics, data sharing, data release, research data, research governance, low-income countries, middle-\nincome countries, clinical research, health policy, privacy, trust\nand instrumentally, in research conducted in low- and mid-\ndle-income settings where social justice concerns are at\ntheir most acute. Against this backdrop, significant progress\nin data sharing, even where it is believed to be capable of\ncontributing to scientific knowledge addressing the global\nburden of disease, is likely to require the development of\nmodels of good data-sharing practice capable of command-\ning the trust and confidence of relevant stakeholders. These\nwill need to be grounded in shared understandings of what\nis required for data sharing to be \"equitable, ethical, and\nefficient\" (Walport & Brest, 2011). Careful consideration of\nstakeholders' differing interests in the development of gov-\nernance policies and processes is needed to enable sound\njudgment of the balance between the need to share data in a\nway that maximizes their use, while ensuring that appropri-\nate protections are in place to minimize potential harms\nIn this article, we report on the results of a literature\nreview and qualitative studies conducted in five low- and\nmiddle-income settings, which explored the experiences\nand views of key stakeholders about best practices in\nsharing individual-level data from clinical and public\nhealth research (Bull, Roberts, & Parker, 2015; Cheah\net\nal., 2015; Denny, Silaigwana, Wassenaar, Bull, &\nthe systematic review was unable to identify any empiri-\ncal studies of stakeholders' views about best practices in\nsharing individual-level data from clinical and public\nhealth research in low- and middle-income settings.\nBefore discussing the findings of our own research, we\nsummarize the main arguments in favor of, and concerns\nabout, data sharing in the literature.\nThe Potential Benefits of Data Sharing\nIt is increasingly widely believed that the greater sharing of\nde-identified individual-level public health and medical\nresearch data would be of high value. Such sharing has the\npotential to enable verification, replication, and expansion\nof research results and to provide means of addressing\nbiases, deficiencies, and dishonesty in published and\nunpublished research (Chan, Hr\u00f3bjartsson, Haahr,\nalso claimed that shared data sets have the potential to gen-\nerate and enable the addressing of novel research ques-\ntions, inform the design of future research, contribute to\npowerful meta-analyses, and to support the building of\ncapacity in analysis (Anderson & Merry, 2009; Dove,\nVallance & Chalmers, 2013). It is argued that researchers\nand research institutions may benefit from sharing data, as\nthe visibility and relevance of their research increases,\npotentially leading to increased collaborations and research\nfunding (Pisani, Whitworth, Zaba, & Abou-Zahr, 2010a;\nThese arguments are important because, if the empirical\nclaims upon which they are based are true, they suggest that\nsharing data has the potential to make an important contri-\nbution to scientific progress and improved health. This\nwould be achieved by expanding the knowledge base used\nto inform not only research but also the ethical review of\nresearch, health care policy development, purchasing deci-\nsions, regulatory review of novel treatments, and clinical\nIn addition to these important claims, which have an\nethical dimension, several additional explicitly moral argu-\nments have been made for greater data sharing. These\ninclude arguments about the ethical importance of maxi-\nmizing the value and utility of data sets and of minimizing\nthe costs and burdens of unnecessary duplication of research\n(Doshi, Goodman, & Ioannidis, 2013; Rani, Bekedam, &\nBuckley, 2011). Data sharing is considered to enable the\nbest use of valuable resources, and to appropriately honor\nthe contributions of research participants (Gotzsche, 2012;\nLangat et\nStrech & Littmann, 2012). Moreover, it is argued that the\ninterests of the wider public, who when asked tend to sup-\nport research, also warrant treating data as a public good to\nbeshared(Tangcharoensathien,Boonperm,&Jongudomsuk,\n2010; Toronto International Data Release Workshop\nConcerns About Data Sharing\nWhile the potential value of data sharing is increasingly rec-\nognized, several important enduring concerns need to be\naddressed for data sharing to be both successful and appro-\npriate. The literature suggests that many of these concerns\nare scientific. As with primary research, the results of sec-\nondary research may be flawed if analysis is inappropriate\nor biased, or if reanalyses are based on misinterpretations of\nthe data or are conducted to push specific agendas (Pearce\nthis may be more likely in secondary research where those\nwho use the data are removed from the context of data col-\nlection and curation. Concerns also arise from the belief\nthat effective data sharing is resource intensive. Curating\ndata for sharing and developing appropriate data-sharing\npolicies and processes takes significant expertise, effort,\nWhitworth, 2010). Monitoring uses of secondary data,\nresponding to queries from data accessors, and evaluating\nresults of secondary research will also require appropriate\nresourcing.\n304 Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics 10(3)\nOther concerns relate to the impact of data sharing on the\nresearchers who collect data and produce shared data sets.\nMandated data sharing could affect researchers' abilities to\npublish primary findings from their studies, and to file rel-\nevant patents, which might in turn create disincentives to\nfund and conduct primary research (Mello et\nabout ownership rights and intellectual property issues may\nmake it difficult to determine who has the authority to\ndecide how data should be shared (Anderson & Merry,\nresearchers have also expressed concerns about reputational\ndamage if their analyses and findings are challenged in sec-\nPerhaps the most commonly expressed concern, however, is\nthat primary researchers' scientific activities may be under-\nmined by data sharing in situations where secondary users,\nwho may be better resourced, are able to utilize data more\nquickly than those who produced it. Given the importance\nof peer-reviewed publications in funding decisions and aca-\ndemic advancement, sufficient opportunities for primary\nresearchers to publish the findings of research are critical\nal.,\n2012), as is appropriate recognition for producing and\ncurating data sets for sharing (Langat etal., 2011; Pisani &\nFinally, and importantly, concerns have been expressed\nabout the potential for data sharing to harm or to fail to\nrespect the interests of participants. A major concern is to\nensure that research participants' privacy is protected and\nthe confidentiality of identifying data is preserved while\nmaintaining the utility of data sets (Castellani, 2013; Sieber,\ndata continue to develop (de Wolf, Sieber, Steel, & Zarate,\n2013), but the possibility of identifying participants, directly\nor deductively, particularly when data sets may be com-\nbined, remains of concern (European Medicines Agency,\nhas also been much discussion about the implications of\ndata sharing for consent. There is some debate about the\nneed to inform participants that de-identified data will be\nshared (de Wolf, Sieber, Steel, & Zarate, 2005; Gotzsche,\nticipants about the possible ramifications of sharing (Mello\nData Release Workshop Authors, 2009). Concerns have\nbeen raised that if data are released without explicit approval\nfrom participants, the delicate trust relationship between\nresearchers and participants will be harmed (Greenhalgh,\nis broad agreement that consent is required, but some dis-\nagreement about what this implies. Broad consent to data\nsharing is becoming increasingly common and accepted\nsome commentators have argued that explicit and dynamic\nconsent for all research uses on each occasion is preferable\nData Sharing in Low- and Middle-Income\nSettings\nMost published literature on data sharing focuses on\nresearch in high-income settings. However, although the lit-\nerature is limited, versions of the arguments above have\nalso begun to appear in literature concerning research in\nlow- and middle-income settings (Manju & Buckley, 2012;\nSankoh & Ijsselmuiden, 2011; Tangcharoensathien etal.,\n2010). Some of this discussion has arisen in the context of\nthe growth of genomic research in low-income settings\n(Parker et\nal., 2009) and increasingly, particularly in\nresponse to the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, calls\nhave been made for facilitating timely data sharing to\ninform responses to public health emergencies and disease\noutbreaks (Langat et\nWhile many of the above arguments are relevant to the\nsharing of research data in any setting, there are some sig-\nnificant differences. For example, while limited resources\nmay be a hindrance to data sharing in higher income set-\ntings, they are likely to be a significant barrier to ethical\ndata sharing in lower income settings (Manju & Buckley,\nWhitworth, 2010). For high-quality individual-level data to\nbe shared in databases with long-term sustainability, signifi-\ncant investment in human resources, technology, and infra-\nstructure will be required. Training, mentoring, and career\npathways also need to be provided for a range of specialist\nsupport staff to document and curate data sets and manage\ndata-release processes.\nFurthermore, the arguments about the potential impact\nof data sharing on primary data producers are also likely to\nbe much more pressing in the case of researchers and\nresearch institutes in low- and middle-income settings. In\nsuch settings, differences in capacity between primary data\nproducers and secondary data users, most likely in high-\nincome settings, who may conduct very rapid analyses of\nthe data, are much greater.\nIt is against this background that we conducted a multisite\nempirical ethics research project using qualitative research\nmethods to examine stakeholder experiences of, and views\nabout, best practices in sharing individual-level data from clin-\nical and public health research. Interviews and focus groups\nwere conducted with key stakeholders, including health pro-\nfessionals, researchers, and community representatives in\nIndia, Vietnam, Thailand, South Africa, and Kenya. The find-\nings of the individual studies are published as separate articles\nin this special issue (Cheah etal., 2015; Denny, Silaigwana,\npresent an overarching analysis of the findings of the project as\na whole. While this analysis is not easily generalizable to other\nlow- and middle-income settings, we believe it offers some\ninteresting and important insights which are likely to be of use to\nresearchers, research ethics committees, funders, and policy\nmakers. It also suggests a number of potential avenues for\nresearch in these and other settings. In the sections below, we\npresent our findings under two broad headings. The first is an\noverviewoffourkeythemesarisingfromouranalysisrelatingto\nviews about important requirements for good ethical data-shar-\ningpractice.Thesecondidentifies fourways forwardinthinking\nthrough the practicalities of good data-sharing practice.\nCore Considerations in Ethical Data\nSharing\nTaken together, the analyses of the five individual studies\nsuggest four key factors as important considerations in judg-\ning whether any particular data-sharing initiative is likely to\nbe an example of good data-sharing practice and likely to\ncommand support in the development of models of data-\nsharing practice. These are the value of data sharing, mini-\nmizing harm, promoting fairness and reciprocity, and trust.\nThe Value of Data Sharing\nEchoing a broad consensus in the published literature, there\nwas general support at all five empirical study sites for data\nsharing among the stakeholders, particularly among senior\nand junior researchers. Attitudes of community members\nand participants were typically more cautious, although sup-\nport for data sharing often grew as they became familiar\nwith the concepts involved, the potential advantages of shar-\ning, and safeguards that could be implemented to address\nconcerns. What this suggests is that for all stakeholders, an\nassessment of the potential benefits of data sharing is likely\nto be an important factor in the question of whether or not it\nconstitutes an example of good data-sharing practice. It is\nimportant to note, however, that this is not the overriding\nconsideration. The benefits of data sharing are seen as one\nfactor in any such judgment. In the following, we discuss\nstakeholders'views about the other factors seen as important\nrequirements for best practice in data sharing.\nMinimizing Harm\nConcerns about minimizing harms of research focused on\nensuring that participants' interests were not adversely\naffected when individual-level data were shared. At all\nsites, protecting participants' privacy and ensuring that\nidentifying data remained confidential were considered to\nbe of key importance by all stakeholders, reflecting a con-\nsensus in the reviewed literature (Bull, Roberts & Parker,\n2015). However, reflecting the broader discussions of harm\nin the literature outlined above, de-identification of data\nwas not necessarily considered sufficient in itself to mini-\nmize the risk of harm. Risks of harm were associated both\nwith the sensitivity of the data sets collected and with the\nuses that could be made of the data. Participants described a\nwide range of data sets that were likely to be sensitive, but\nnoted that all data could potentially be sensitive, which\nmade it important to understand both the context in which\ndata had been collected, and proposed secondary uses of it.\nParticular concerns were raised about secondary research\nwith de-identified data contributing to the stigmatization of\nidentifiable communities, populations, and even countries.\nData and secondary research about topics such as disease\nprevalence and socioeconomic status had the potential to\nincrease stigmatization when results were insensitively\nreported, or when secondary users had vested interests. In\nsome cases, more direct harms could potentially result from\ndata sharing, for example, if data about participants in\nimpoverished informal settlements collected for public\nhealth research purposes was accessed by secondary users\nto inform accelerated resettlement.\nIn addition to potential harms to participants, researchers\nat all sites echoed concerns in the literature discussed above\nabout the potential for data sharing to adversely affect\nresearch capacity and career development in low- and mid-\ndle-income settings. Concerns were raised, for example,\nabout primary researchers being side-lined by better\nresourced institutions conducting secondary research.\nSecondary users' critiques of the quality of data sets and of\nthe primary research could affect primary researchers'repu-\ntations, ability to attract research funding, and career devel-\nopment. If insufficient resources were available for\nappropriate preparation and curation of data sets prior to\nmandatory sharing, and to respond to secondary users' que-\nries during such sharing, then resources might be wasted in\nsecondary analyses which were unable to generate valid\nanswers to the research question.\nPromoting Fairness and Reciprocity\nAt all sites, the importance of ensuring that data-sharing\npractices did not increase existing inequalities was consid-\nered fundamental, reflecting discussions in the literature\nabout the need for data sharing to be ethical and equitable.\nKey considerations in good data-sharing practice:\nThe value of data sharing\nMinimizing harm\nPromoting fairness and reciprocity\nTrust\n306 Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics 10(3)\nParticipants focused not only on the importance of protect-\ning stakeholders from harm but also promoting their rele-\nvant interests. In such discussions, community stakeholders\nnoted that their contributions to the development of a valu-\nable resource suggested that the resource should be used to\ndirectly or indirectly benefit their community. There was\ndiscussion about the possibility of direct benefits accruing\nto participants from secondary research, but no general con-\nsensus that direct benefits were a requirement of ethical\ndata sharing. Community stakeholders in multiple settings\ndiscussed the importance of secondary research providing\nindirect benefits, such as addressing health issues of rele-\nvance to their communities. If such issues were not to be\naddressed, then it was considered important that secondary\nresearch should have the potential to advance health more\ngenerally.\nResearchers' perspectives were similar to those high-\nlighted in the literature, emphasizing the importance of\nensuring that data sharing was conducted in a way that did\nnot adversely affect their careers or ability to conduct health\nresearch of relevance to the communities in which they\nwere based. Research data were perceived to be a valuable\nresource created and managed with considerable effort. The\nimportance of these data was not limited to their value in\naddressing specific research questions of relevance to com-\nmunities, but also linked to their potential to leverage fund-\ning and capacity development for future research. Echoing\ndiscussions in the literature, a core requirement of fair data\nsharing was that primary data producers received appropri-\nate recognition of their role in producing valuable data sets.\nCapacity building may be needed to support researchers'\neffective and timely analyses of their own data sets, to\nenable effective participation in larger collaborations ana-\nlyzing multiple linked data sets, and to enable identification\nand secondary analysis of relevant data sets to address top-\nics of interest. Some stakeholders went further and sug-\ngested that principles of reciprocity require that data\nproducers should be routinely offered the opportunity to be\ninvolved in secondary analyses of their data, with appropri-\nate "
