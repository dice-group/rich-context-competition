What, if anything, can\nbe done to enhance the durability of peace in the aftermath of war? Some cease-\nfires fall apart within days or months, others hold for years, while others last in-\ndefinitely. Why, for example, did a cease-fire in the Arab-Israeli war in 1948 fail\nwithin three months, while the next one lasted for years? Why has peace so often\nfaltered between India and Pakistan but held, despite ongoing tensions, between\nNorth and South Korea? Surprisingly little theoretical or empirical work has ex-\nplored this important question.\nStates have devised a number of mechanisms to try to make it easier to main-\ntain peace. These mechanisms are often implemented as part of a cease-fire agree-\nment. States set up demilitarized zones, accept international peacekeeping missions,\nestablish dispute resolution procedures, sign formal agreements, and undertake other\nsteps to try to enhance the prospects for peace. Do these measures work? If so,\nwhy? This article begins to answer this question by analyzing the duration of peace\ntheories of international cooperation to argue that measures such as these help\nenemies overcome the cooperation problem inherent in the aftermath of war. Stu-\ndents of international relations have long drawn on contracting theory and the new\neconomics of organization literature to examine how actors can achieve coopera-\ntion even as anarchy makes it impossible to write enforceable contracts.1 Scholar-\nMany friends and colleagues have given advice and comments on the larger project of which this\npaper is a part.

I argue that mechanisms within agree-\nments can make durable peace more likely by changing the incentives to break a\ncease-fire, by reducing uncertainty about actions and intentions, and by prevent-\ning accidental violations from triggering another round of fighting. If this argu-\nment is correct, the content of cease-fire agreements should affect whether peace\nlasts. Individually and collectively, these measures should be associated with more\ndurable peace, all else being equal.\nScholars of international relations in the realist tradition likely would argue that\ncease-fire agreements and the measures within them are at best epiphenomenal. In\nthese scholars' view, agreements may reflect other factors that affect durability,\nbut arguments that they themselves shape the chances for lasting peace are ideal-\nistic. In this view, agreements are merely \"scraps of paper.\" They are not binding\nin an anarchical system and should have no independent effect on international\nbehavior, least of all on decisions about war and peace.2 To test the effects of\nagreements on the durability of peace, one therefore needs to control for other\nfactors that affect the baseline prospects for peace. If, once these variables are\nincluded, agreement mechanisms have no effect, then one can conclude that agree-\nments are only scraps of paper. If, however, agreements matter even when the\nbaseline prospects are accounted for, this would support the argument that even\ndeadly enemies can overcome the obstacles to cooperation.\nA small but growing literature has begun to examine what makes peace easier\nor harder to maintain. For example, a number of scholars, including Zeev Maoz\nand Paul Hensel, have found that decisive victories tend to be more stable than\nstalemates.3 Hensel also found that conflicts over territory were more likely to\nreemerge. In what is probably the most comprehensive examination of this issue\nto date, Werner finds that changes in relative capabilities over time provide the\nbest explanation for the breakdown of peace.4 She argues that the durability of\npeace is best examined as a decision to restart the war as part of an ongoing bar-\ngaining process, so that changes taking place after the fighting stops are most likely\nto affect whether it starts again.\nThe growing literature on \"enduring rivalries\" is closely related to the study of\nthe resumption of war.5 By selecting only cases of repeated conflict, much of this\nliterature cannot address the question of why some rivalries endure while others\ndo not. However, Stinnett and Diehl tackle this issue in their study of the paths\nto rivalry. They find, for example, that conflicts between contiguous states, be-\ntween major powers, or between recently independent states are more likely to be\n2. This is akin to the argument that international institutions are epiphenomenal. Mearsheimer 1994.\nSee also Mearsheimer 2001. If agreements have no effect, however, it is not clear why states bother to\nwrite them. Leeds, Long, and Mitchell 2000.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Existing works have only tangentially addressed\nwhether deliberate mechanisms to try to maintain peace have been effective.8 No\nsystematic studies have explored whether and how the content of cease-fire agree-\nments matters in the construction of lasting peace.9 Are cease-fire agreements merely\nscraps of paper that have no effect on stability? Or is it the case that agreements\ncan improve the prospect of a lasting peace?\nThe first section of this article develops cooperation theory to explain how spe-\ncific mechanisms within cease-fire agreements might affect the durability of peace.\nThis argument suggests that measures such as the withdrawal of forces, creation\nof demilitarized zones, formal cease-fire agreements, peacekeeping, third-party guar-\nantees, and dispute resolution procedures should help foster peace that lasts. The\nmore of these measures implemented, the longer peace should last, all else being\nequal. This section also lays out the counterargument and explores other variables\nthat might be expected to affect the baseline prospects for peace. It is important to\ninclude these variables to guard against the possibility of finding spurious effects\nif these factors influence both the content of agreements and the duration of peace;\nin other words, to show that agreements are not epiphenomenal. The second sec-\ntion describes the econometric model and the data set of cease-fires in inter-\nnational wars used to test these hypotheses. The findings, presented in the third\nsection, show that agreements are not merely scraps of paper; rather, the imple-\nmentation of specific mechanisms within cease-fire agreements can help make peace\nlast. Strong agreements lead to more durable peace.\nIn this study I define peace merely as the absence of war. I do not distinguish\nbetween relations that become very friendly and those that remain acrimonious\ndespite the absence of violence. Under my definition, North and South Korea have\nbeen at \"peace\" for half a century. Clearly, not all varieties of peace are equally\ndesirable, nor does stability necessarily coincide with social justice. Nevertheless,\nmost wars cause poverty, disease, and dislocation, and all entail the large-scale\nloss of human life. Repeated conflict only exacerbates these tragedies. This study\nnot only indicates that states can overcome obstacles to maintaining peace in war-\ntorn areas, but also identifies the most effective ways of doing so.\n8. There has been more work done on this question for civil wars, including Walter 2001; Hampson\n9. Werner and others have examined the effects of negotiated settlements or of peace treaties (as\nopposed to armistices), but not of the content of the arrangements implemented.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Because war is\ncostly, there is shared interest in avoiding renewed hostilities. This shared interest,\nhowever, does not automatically lead to peace. Recent belligerents have deeply\nconflicting interests and strong incentives to take advantage of each other.10 They\nalso have good reason to fear each other's intentions. Cooperation is therefore\ndifficult to achieve. I argue that cease-fire agreements can foster cooperation in\nseveral ways, by changing incentives, by reducing uncertainty about actions and\nintentions, and by controlling accidental violations of the cease-fire.\nThis argument rests on three assumptions: (1) that states are rationally led; (2)\nthat war is costly, and not desired for its own sake; and (3) that each ex-belligerent\nhas incentives to take advantage of its opponent, or good reason to fear its oppo-\nnent's intentions. I do not assume that both belligerents reach a cease-fire on equal\nfooting.\" There are usually winners and losers in war, and at least one side's ac-\nceptance of a cease-fire may have been \"coerced.\" However, unless one side is\ncompletely eliminated in war, both sides can impose costs on each other, and the\nproblem of cooperation maintains.12\nFirst, by \"rationally led\" I mean that leaders make decisions purposefully and\nthat they consider the expected costs and benefits of their actions. Leaders are not\nomniscient; they can make mistakes. But I assume that leaders do not act ran-\ndomly, nor will they act in ways that they expect will be contrary to their inter-\nests. I do not assume that states are unitary actors, however. Leaders are subject to\ndomestic political pressures, and may not exercise full control over all of those in\nwhose name they lead.\nSecond, to say that actors prefer peace to war is not to say, naively, that they\nprefer peace to the possibility of winning a war and dictating terms, but to say that\nthey would prefer to reach the outcome of war without the cost of fighting it. War\nis costly in terms of lives and money, and it is risky--there is always the chance\nof losing rather than winning. As Fearon has explained, war is \"ex post ineffi-\ncient.\" 13 Unless fighting is preferred for its own sake, even enemies would prefer\nto settle their disputes without resorting to war.\nThe inefficiency of war does not necessarily result in peace, however. This study\nconcerns states who were recently at war, and who are, by definition, deadly en-\n10. A shared interest in peace combined with conflicting individual interests constitutes the prob-\nlem of cooperation. On the distinctions between harmony, cooperation, and deadlock, see Keohane 1984.\n11. For the sake of simplicity, I discuss the problem of cooperation as involving only two states. A\nnumber of wars in this study have multiple belligerents. These are split into separate dyadic observa-\ntions in the quantitative research discussed below.\n12. Kecskemeti 1964. The only case examined here in which one side was eliminated by the other\nis South Vietnam's fall to the North in 1975.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core. ReadCube, on 18 Jan 2017 at 04:10:45, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at\nemies.14 I assume, third, that relations between adversaries are marked by seri-\nously conflicting interests and deep mistrust. It is unlikely that the war settled the\nconflict to both parties' satisfaction. Indeed the war may have caused new issues\nof conflict. Both sides face incentives to take advantage of each other. They are\nbargaining over some disputed issue. If either side thought it could march in and\ntake what it wanted without meeting much resistance, it would probably choose to\ndo so. States prefer peace to war, but not to settling the dispute on their own terms.\nConflicting interests give belligerents an incentive to break the cease-fire in a bid\nto make unilateral gains on the battlefield. This is the familiar game of prisoner's\ndilemma.\nThere may also be cases where neither side would prefer to attack, even un-\nopposed. However, there is no easy way for actors to know this. In an atmosphere\nof deep mistrust in the aftermath of war, each side has good reason to fear attack\nfrom its opponent. Uncertainty and fear about the other's intentions can under-\nmine cooperation even where perfect information would automatically yield a co-\noperative outcome. Security dilemma dynamics and their spirals of fear and hostility\nare especially likely among states who have recently engaged in mortal combat.15\nWith communication channels severed during the war, and enemies likely to as-\nsume the worst about each other, incidents along the cease-fire line, even if acci-\ndental or the result of rogue forces, can reignite war. Peace is precarious.\nA hypothetical case helps illustrate the obstacles to peace. Imagine two states\nthat have just fought a war over a piece of territory (Israel and Syria in 1973,\nperhaps, or El Salvador and Honduras after the 1969 Football War). The war was\ncostly and the two states would prefer not to fight again, but they would each like\nmore of the disputed land, preferably all of it. Both believe it to be rightfully theirs,\nand domestically, occupation of any part of it by the enemy is seen as a travesty.\nThe side that lost territory in the war has an incentive to try to win it back, and the\nside that gained may hope it can now claim more. Both sides therefore have in-\ncentives to try to encroach upon the other, or even to make a dramatic advance, to\npush the cease-fire line farther toward the other side.\nMoreover, both states have good reason to fear encroachment or attack by the\nother. These fears have likely been exacerbated by leaders' inflammatory remarks\nfor domestic consumption. Both sides will be particularly wary of military maneu-\nvers, resupply efforts, or anything that might be a precursor to a new attack. When\nthe fighting stopped, soldiers were likely left in close proximity to their enemies,\nfacing each other \"eyeball-to-eyeball\" across the cease-fire line. The chance of\ntroops firing across the line or of skirmishes as each side tries to improve its po-\nsition is quite high. If irregular troops were involved in the fighting, or if com-\n14. Peace is more or less automatic among friendly states, or among states who are far away from,\nand have little to do with, each other; between Belize and Mozambique, say.

In assurance games such as stag Hunt, it is the grave payoff of being attacked and\nthe difficulty of assessing intentions that makes cooperation risky.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

In such a tense atmosphere of mistrust, with normal diplo-\nmatic channels cut, such small clashes can easily escalate. Whether through delib-\nerate action, spirals of fear and preemption, or accident and involuntary defection,\nthe probability of war erupting anew is high.16\nAlthough both sides are better off with peace, they cannot simply declare peace\nand leave it at that. Their commitments to maintain peace are not credible.17 An\nactor with hostile intentions has an incentive to say it will abide by the cease-fire\nso that its partner will cooperate and be \"suckered\" into letting down its guard\nand perhaps leaving itself vulnerable to attack. In international relations, of course,\nthere is no external enforcement power to prevent actors from such cheating. This\nis the central problem of cooperation under anarchy in international relations.\nSo how do deadly enemies ever achieve peace? Cease-fire arrangements rely on\nreciprocity and mutual deterrence. Each side stops fighting in exchange for the\nother side doing the same. If either breaks the cease-fire, the other will respond in\nkind. It is the prospect of return fire that deters attack. This is so central to the\nnotion of a cease-fire that it may seem quite obvious. However, for reciprocity\nand deterrence to work, several things must be true: the cost of reinitiating con-\nflict must outweigh the incentives to attack; it must be easy to distinguish com-\npliance from noncompliance; both sides must be reassured about each other's\nintentions, especially if a there is a military advantage to striking first; and acci-\ndents must be prevented from triggering another war. These requisites suggest both\nthe obstacles to peace and strategies for overcoming them.\nCease-fire agreements can employ three types of strategies to ensure that peace\nlasts: changing incentives by making it more costly to attack; reducing uncer-\ntainty about actions and intentions; and preventing or controlling accidental vio-\nlations. These strategies suggest specific observable mechanisms, the effects of\nwhich are tested below.\nAltering Incentives\nWar will resume if the incentives to attack exceed the cost of breaking the cease-\nfire. But there are steps belligerents and the international community can take to\nincrease the costs of an attack. These steps widen the bargaining space between\nbelligerents and make another bout of war less likely. Adversaries can tie their\n16. Reiter 1995 found preemption to be rare as the sole cause of war. But conflicts that start or\nescalate to war through preemption are most likely among deadly enemies, such as Israel and its Arab\nneighbors in 1967. Similarly, wars rarely start purely by accident, but escalating clashes, often at least\npartially the result of accidents or unauthorized action, can contribute to the spiral toward war. Such\nwas the case between India and Pakistan in 1965, and arguably again in 1999. Escalating clashes led to\nthe second war between China and Vietnam, and to serious fighting short of full-scale war between\n17. For analyses of the problem of credible commitments as an obstacle to peace see Fearon 1995;\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core. ReadCube, on 18 Jan 2017 at 04:10:45, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at\nown hands by physically constraining their ability to attack. Withdrawal of troops\nfrom the front line, creation of a demilitarized buffer zone, and arms control make\nremobilizing for war more difficult. These actions also make a successful surprise\nattack much less likely.\nBelligerents may also be able to alter incentives by declaring their cease-fire\nformally. By signing a formal agreement, states invoke international law. Of course,\nwith no higher authority to enforce it, international law is not binding in the way\nthat domestic law is. International agreements can be broken, but breaking them\nrisks losing international aid and military support, and legitimizes retaliation by\nthe other side. Formal and public declaration of a cease-fire thus invokes inter-\nnational audience costs.18\nActors may also turn to outsiders to help them enforce a cease-fire. Commit-\nment by a third party to guarantee the peace serves as a deterrent, again by raising\nthe cost of noncompliance. An external guarantor takes on some of the responsi-\nbility for retaliation in the event of defection. The presence of peacekeeping troops\ninterposed between forces may also serve as a physical and reputational buffer to\nensure the cease-fire.\nReducing Uncertainty About Actions and Intentions\nAgreements can reduce uncertainty by specifying the terms of a cease-fire. Mark-\ning the exact location of the cease-fire line provides a focal point that can help\nprevent \"salami tactic\" attempts to push the line to either side's advantage. Spell-\ning out the rules of the cease-fire explicitly helps to define compliance and non-\ncompliance, which serves to prevent misunderstandings and avoid unnecessary\ntension. The more specific the agreement, the less uncertainty there will be about\nwhat constitutes compliance.\nVerification mechanisms can alleviate concerns about detecting aggressive moves\nby the opponent in time to respond. Monitoring may be less important in cease-\nfire agreements than other sorts of agreements, because states are likely to rely on\nnational intelligence for warning of an attack, and it is difficult to hide aggression\nonce it starts.19 However, neutral referees can play an important role in fostering\nstable peace. Because it is costly to be seen as the aggressor, states will try to\nblame the other side for any fighting that starts. Without neutral observers, claims\nof being the victim of aggression are not credible and there are bound to be\ndisputes over \"who started it.\" Monitors to investigate incidents and provide\n18. Agreeing to peace and signing a formal document in the first place may involve substantial\ndomestic audience costs if peace is unpopular with some groups.

The international audience costs\nof breaking a cease-fire, therefore, often depend on impartial monitoring.\nPhysical constraints, audience costs, and third-party guarantees or peacekeep-\ning efforts change belligerents' incentives, but also serve as important signaling\ndevices that can reduce uncertainty about intentions. Willingness to accept mea-\nsures that make war more costly is a credible signal of benign intent. States con-\ntemplating an attack will be less willing than those with nobler intentions to sign\non to measures that increase the physical or political cost of fighting. Critics might\nargue that this concedes the point that agreements are epiphenomenal; only those\nwho intend to abide by the cease-fire will agree to strong mechanisms, but it is the\nintentions, not the mechanisms, doing the causal work. This argument is unfalsi-\nfiable, as is there is no way to measure intentions a priori (if there were, inter-\nnational relations would be very different and war might not exist at all). But it\nalso misses the point. Of course intentions matter. One of the ways in which agree-\nments affect the durability of peace is by providing credible ways of signaling\nthese intentions and overcoming the security dilemma.\nIn the abstract, there are two distinct causal pathways possible: one in which\nagreement mechanisms influence peace directly by constraining states or provid-\ning information, and another in which mechanisms simply signal intentions. How-\never, the two pathways are not so easily distinguished in reality. As the literature\non signaling and \"cheap talk\" suggests, if there are incentives to misrepresent, as\nthere surely are among deadly enemies, signals are only credible if they are costly.\nFor a state to limit its ability to wage war, or to open itself up to verification is\ncostly, and therefore credible. That is, the indirect signaling function depends in\nlarge part on the more direct effects of agreement mechanisms.20\nControlling Accidents\nReciprocal strategies can be very vulnerable to accidents and misunderstandings.\nIf troops stray over the cease-fire line, or fire accidentally, and the other side re-\ntaliates, the situation can quickly spiral back into full-blown war. If leaders do not\nexercise full control over their troops (or in some cases over civilians), rogue groups\nopposed to peace can easily upset it by violating the cease-fire and provoking\nretaliation.\nOngoing negotiations and dispute resolution procedures can alleviate this dan-\nger by preventing misunderstandings and providing a forum for resolving differ-\nences before a spiral of retaliation is triggered. However, because both sides have\n20. Some of the mechanisms examined here signal by \"tying hands,\" creating costs only if a state\nreneges on its commitment. This is true of the reputational costs invoked by a formal agreement, for\nexample. Others \"sink costs\" by requiring payment ex ante, for example withdrawing from territory.\nOthers, such as verification measures, may do both. On this distinction, see Fearon 1997.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core. ReadCube, on 18 Jan 2017 at 04:10:45, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at\nan incentive to blame violations on accidents or rogue factions, communication\nby itself may not always be credible.\nWithdrawal of forces, buffer zones, and arms control can help prevent accidents\nand misunderstandings from occurring in the first place.21 \"Confidence-building\nmeasures\" to regulate and make transparent behavior (such as military exercises)\nthat is likely to cause tension can also prevent misunderstandings and alleviate\nsuspicions. Cease-fire agreements often hold each state responsible for violations\ncoming from its own territory, to prevent these violations from being used as an\nexcuse for intentional defection. Agreements may also include concrete measures\nfor internal control to deal with this problem of \"involuntary defection.\"22 In ad-\ndition to acting as referees, international monitors investigate and mediate small\nclashes and disputes to keep them from escalating.\nThe theory put forth here is an institutionalist argument about mechanisms to\novercome the obstacles to cooperation. I hypothesize that agreements can enhance\nthe durability of peace by raising the cost of breaking a cease-fire, reducing un-\ncertainty, and preventing and controlling accidents. While these three strategies\nfor maintaining peace are presented separately, their functions are intimately con-\nnected, and specific mechanisms often serve several purposes. For example, mon-\nitoring by peacekeepers reduces uncertainty by ensuring that defectors will be\ncaught. This also raises the cost of reinitiating war. In practice, much of peace-\nkeepers' day-to-day work entails mediation and the prevention of small clashes\nfrom spiraling out of control. Physical constraints that alter the incentives for war\nalso necessarily reduce fears of impending attack and reduce the likelihood of ac-\ncidents. Belligerents' willingness to implement measures to tie their own hands\nand raise the cost of attack serves as a credible signal of commitment and thereby\nreduces uncertainty and makes accidents easier to control.\nWhile analytically distinct, the strategies of raising costs, reducing uncertainty,\nand controlling accidents therefore overlap in practice. The strategies themselves\ncannot be observed directly. But the specific mechanisms discussed above can be\nobserved and their effects tested empirically. I focus on the following measures:\nwithdrawal of forces, establishment of demilitarized zones, arms control, mea-\nsures to control potential rogue groups, third-party involvement, peacekeeping,\nconfidence-building measures, dispute resolution procedures, the specificity of\nagreements, and whether agreements are formal or tacit.\nI use the term \"strength of agreement\" to refer to the number and extent of the\nmeasures implemented as part of a cease-fire. Agreement strength varies from none,\nif a cease-fire takes place with no agreement or without implementing any of the\nmeasures listed above (as when the second war between China and Vietnam sim-\n21.

The United Nations Emergency Force was given responsibility for pursuing fedayeen (guer-\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

(The agreements reached between Israel\nand Egypt after the Yom Kippur war, as well as the Korean Armistice, are exam-\nples.) If the cooperation theory spelled out here is correct, peace should last lon-\nger, ceteris paribus, the stronger the agreement implemented. Furthermore, each\nof the individual measures should be associated with more durable peace. Both\ntogether and separately, these mechanisms are hypothesized to increase the stabil-\nity of peace.\nPolitical Settlement\nAltering incentives, reducing uncertainty, and controlling accidents are all rather\napolitical strategies for avoiding war. But the political content of an agreement\nshould also be important. Resolving the underlying issues of conflict, if it is pos-\nsible, is a way of removing the reason to fight. Whether an agreement purports to\nsettle the political issues over which the war was fought, rather than simply to\nstop hostilities, should affect stability. I focus on the more mechanical tools for\nmaintaining peace, because settlement of the basic political issues, whether by\nagreement or by force, is quite rare in the post-World War II era. Most wars end\nwith the fundamental issues still in dispute, even if one side clearly won the war\n(Israel's decisive victory in 1967 did not settle the Arab-Israeli issue, for example).\nNevertheless, when a settlement of substantive political issues is reached, whether\nimposed or agreed to, one should expect it to be associated with stable peace.\nThe Counterargument: Agreements Are Epiphenomenal,\nMerely \"Scraps of Paper\"\nAll else being equal, stronger agreements should lead to more durable peace. All\nelse is not equal, however. The agreement aside, peace will be easier to maintain\nin some cases than in others. The counterargument to the hypothesis that agree-\nments can foster peace is that when cooperation is relatively easy, parties will be\nable to draft strong agreements. These are the very cases in which peace will last\nin any case. Conversely, when cooperation is difficult and the chances of peace\nfalling apart are high for other reasons, belligerents will be unable to conclude\nagreements that do anything more than paper over differences. Any apparent rela-\ntionship between the strength of agreements and the duration of peace is therefore\nspurious. According to this argument, agreements are merely epiphenomenal; they\nreflect other factors that determine the duration of peace but have no independent\neffect of their own.\nIn related research I have tested this counterargument directly, examining whether\nstronger agreements are implemented when these situational variables make peace\neasier or harder to maintain. I have found little evidence that states only imple-\nment strong agreements in the easy cases. If anything, just the opposite is true,\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Following other studies of the resumption of war, one\nshould expect peace to last longer after decisive military victories than after stale-\nmates.25 Because the cost of war is the main reason to cooperate in the first place,\none might also expect peace to be more stable the more costly the war just fought.\nBelligerents with a history of conflict before the war are likely to have a harder\ntime maintaining peace, either because repeated conflict is a good indicator of the\nintractability of the dispute or because conflict breeds future conflict. One might\nexpect cooperation to be most difficult when war threatens states' very existence\nor when the fight is over territory.26 Because contiguous states are more likely to\nfight in the first place, one might expect them to be more likely to fight again than\nstates separated by more than a border.27 Changes in relative military capabilities\nshould also affect the durability of peace.

The use of an arbitrary time period is problematic, however. What\none chooses as the time limit by which to judge success can significantly affect\nresults. One could instead use the criterion of whether war has ever resumed to\ndistinguish permanent peace from any cease-fire that fails. This would at least be\nan analytic, rather than arbitrary, distinction between the two categories. How-\never, this method runs into another problem--the issue of \"censored data.\" Peace\nthat has lasted to date may not continue to hold. Even if peace has lasted quite a\nlong time, one cannot know how long it will continue to last. Israel and Syria\nhave not fought a full-fledged war in almost twenty years, but they might yet.30\nThose cases in which peace has lasted to date are considered \"censored.\"\nFortunately, a class of econometric models exists that avoids all of these prob-\nlems. Duration models (also known as hazard rate or survival time models) esti-\nmate the effects of independent variables on the length of time something lasts,\nand the models can incorporate our uncertainty about how long the phenomenon\n(in this case, peace) will continue into the future. Of the several duration models\nto choose from, I use a Weibull model. Unlike some models, it does not require an\nassumption that the hazard rate (the instantaneous rate of failure given survival to\na given point) is constant over time. The Weibull, therefore, allows us to test com-\npeting hypotheses about whether peace becomes easier or harder to maintain over\ntime. The Weibull does, however, assume that the shape of the hazard rate is mono-\ntonic. To see whether this is a reasonable assumption, I have also run a Cox pro-\nportional hazard model that makes no assumption about the shape of the hazard.\nThe findings are not significantly different, suggesting that the Weibull model is\nappropriate. The Weibull gives more precise estimates in a small data set like the\nThe Cease-Fires Data Set\nTo test the hypotheses laid out above, I constructed a data set that includes infor-\nmation on cease-fires and how long they lasted; on the situation between the bel-\nligerents at the time of cease-fire (their history of conflict, the decisiveness of\nmilitary victory, etc.) as well as changes over time (in relative capabilities, regime\ntype, etc.); and detailed information on the nature and content of any agreement\nand peace mechanisms that accompanied or followed the cease-fire.\nThe data set covers cease-fires in international wars ending between 1946\nand 1997. Each case is a cease-fire between a pair of principal belligerents in the\n30. India and Pakistan fought a war in the Kargil region in 1999 after the data used here were\ncensored, underlining the importance of treating with care our uncertainty about peace that has lasted\nto a certain point.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

It need not be accomplished through an ex-\nplicit agreement. COW wars in which fighting stopped and started again are di-\nvided into separate cases, one for each cease-fire. During the first Arab-Israeli war\nin Palestine, for example, there was a break in the fighting in 1948 in accordance\nwith a United Nations (UN) Security Council resolution ordering a cease-fire. Three\nmonths later, the cease-fire failed when Israel launched an offensive to seize the\nNegev. Another cease-fire ended the war in 1949. I treat these as distinct cases.\nHistory tends to forget the failed cease-fires, focusing only on the ones that suc-\nceeded in ending the war. Breaking these into separate cases is therefore crucial to\navoid selecting on the dependent variable.34 Cease-fires range in length from two\nweeks (the first Turco-Cypriot cease-fire) to fifty years and counting (Korea).\nBecause wars that start and stop again are treated as separate observations, and\nbecause multilateral wars are split into dyads, not all of the cases in the data set\nare independent of one another. I correct for the statistical problem of autocorre-\nlation by calculating robust standard errors,35 but a substantive caveat should also\nbe noted. Because the Arab-Israeli conflict has been both multilateral and oft-\nrepeated, much of the data set thus consists of Middle East cases. Domination of\nthe data set by one conflict raises issues of generalizability. However, in neither\nthe quantitative work, nor related case-study research have I found significant dif-\nferences between the Middle East cases and others that would skew results.36\nThere are forty-eight cease-fire cases in the data set. They are listed in Appen-\ndix 1. Each of these cease-fires is a subject for which there are multiple observa-\ntions over time, each of a year or less, for a total of 876 observations. This allows\nme to record changes in military capabilities over time, the arrival or departure of\npeacekeepers, or the fact that a new agreement has been reached implementing\nnew measures. These are known as \"time-varying covariates\" in the duration analy-\nsis lingo. For each subject, the time spans run continuously to the start of a new\nwar or the end of the data at the beginning of 1998. The duration model treats\n32. One interstate war from the COW list is dropped because it never reached an interstate cease-\nfire. The war between Vietnam and Cambodia \"ended\" with the installation of a pro-Vietnam govern-\nment, but the fighting between this new government and the Khmer Rouge continued as a civil war.\n33. Defined as those contributing less than one-tenth the number of troops committed by the largest\nprovider of troops.\n34. I used COW data on when states \"left\" and \"reentered\" the war, supplemented by my research,\nto determine these breaks in the fighting. It is possible that I have missed some very short-lived cease-\nfires. This selection bias should work against my own argument, however, as brief cease-fires are much\nmore likely to be reported if accompanied by strong agreements than by weak ones.\n35. These are calculated using Huber's method, with cases clustered by conflict. All of the Arab-\nIsraeli cases are one cluster, all of the India-Pakistan cases another, and so on. Cases are assumed to be\nindependent between clusters but not necessarily within clusters.\n36. Where controlling for Arab-Israeli cases made a significant difference in the results, it is dis-\ncussed below.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Peace is considered to fail at the start of another COW war between\nthe same two belligerents. The data set is censored at the end of 1997.37 War re-\nsumes eventually in twenty-one cases, and is censored in the other twenty-seven.\nData on the various aspects of agreements come from my research on each case.38\nI investigated and coded the following aspects of agreements: the extent of with-\ndrawal of forces, demilitarized zones, arms control measures, peacekeeping (whether\na monitoring mission or a peacekeeping force, and whether the mission was new\nor was left over from a previous mission before the war broke out), third-party\ninvolvement in peacemaking or guarantees of the peace, the specificity of any agree-\nment, whether it was formal or tacit, dispute resolution procedures, confidence-\nbuilding measures, measures to control possible rogue action, and whether the\npolitical issues over which the war was fought were settled.39 See Appendix 2.\nNot all of the cease-fires are accompanied by agreements, of course. The data\nset includes a number of cases in which fighting stopped with a unilateral with-\ndrawal, in which war simply fizzled to an end with no explicit cease-fire, or in\nwhich fighting ended with the installation by one side of a \"friendly\" government\nfor the other (as in Hungary in 1956). In such cases, the mechanisms under dis-\ncussion here are coded as zero unless measures were implemented in the absence\nof an agreement.\nAgreement strength is measured in two ways. One is simply an index of the\nmechanisms implemented, with a point for a demilitarized zone, another for arms\ncontrol measures, half for a monitoring mission or one for an armed peacekeeping\nforce, and so on. This measure is crude but has the benefit of being objective and\nreplicable by others. It ranges from 0 to 10. The other is a more subjective coding\nof the extent of the measures implemented. This measure is a five-point scale rang-\ning from none for cease-fires with no mechanisms (Russo-Hungary or Uganda-\nTanzania, for example) to very strong for formal, detailed agreements with\npeacekeeping contingents, demilitarized zones, dispute resolution procedures, and\nso on (the Korean Armistice and the Egyptian-Israeli agreements after 1973 fall\ninto this category). It is derived from a qualitative comparison of all of the cases\nin the data set.40 The objective and subjective measures are highly correlated (.88).\n37. The North Vietnam-South Vietnam case is censored immediately because South Vietnam ceased\nto exist.\n38. Sources included references surveying international conflict in the postwar era (including Ber-\n1991), secondary sources on each conflict, and primary documents, including cease-fire agreement\ntexts.\n39. To prevent my own knowledge of outcomes from biasing my coding, I coded the cases \"blind,\"\nthat is, hiding proper names or other information that would allow me to identify the case. While it\nwas not feasible to have someone duplicate the entire data set to check inter-coder reliability, a re-\nsearch assistant \"spot checked\" randomly selected cases.\n40. Note that neither measure includes whether the agreement settled the political issues over which\nthe war was fought, which I consider separately.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core. ReadCube, on 18 Jan 2017 at 04:10:45, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at\nUsing both helps ensure that the subjective coding is not biased and that the ob-\njective coding is fairly accurate.\nData on situational or control variables come from existing data sets. A dummy\nvariable marks whether the war ended in a tie or in a military victory for one side.\nThe COST OF WAR measure is based on battle deaths, HISTORY OF CONFLICT mea-\nsures the extent to which the belligerents' shared past is marked by serious dis-\nputes. I include measures noting whether one side's very existence was threatened\nby the war, whether the fight was over territory, whether belligerents are contigu-\nous, and whether the war involved more than two states. Following Werner, I use\nthe COW material capabilities data to measure changes in relative capabilities.41\nMeasures of expected utility were generated in EUGene.42 Appendix 2 provides\nmore specific details of coding and data sources.43\nFindings\nBaseline Prospects for Peace\nWith a relatively small data set, it is not possible to test all of the hypotheses\noutlined above simultaneously. I begin with an assessment of the baseline pros-\npects for peace, leaving the agreement aside for the time being. Table 1 shows the\nstatistical results. Coefficients indicate the effect of variables on the hazard of war\nresuming. Positive coefficients indicate variables associated with peace that falls\napart more quickly (a higher hazard of failing), and negative coefficients mark\nvariables associated with more durable peace (a lower risk of another war). To\ngive a sense of the relative size of effects, the right-hand column presents esti-\nmated hazard ratios for variables found to have a significant effect. Hazard ratios\nare interpreted relative to a baseline of one: a ratio of 0.50 indicates that the hazard\nis cut in half, while a ratio of 2.0 indicates a doubling of the risk of another war.\nWars that end in a tie are much (twenty-seven times) more likely to be repeated\nthan those that end with a decisive victory for one side. More costly wars are\nfollowed by substantially more durable peace, all else being equal. Peace is signifi-\ncantly more fragile between belligerents with more acrimonious shared histories,\nand is almost six times more precarious when one side's existence is threatened\n41. Because democratic dyads never fight, there are no cease-fires between democratic states, but\nsome dyads become jointly democratic after a cease-fire is in place (for example, Britain and Argen-\ntina after 1983). Joint democracy may make peace more durable, but the finding depends largely on\nhow one codes Cyprus during the extremely short-lived cease-fire in 1974. It is also called into ques-\ntion by the 1999 Kargil War between India and Pakistan (which occurs after the data used here are\ncensored). For further discussion of these cases and the relationship between democracy and the\ndurability of peace, see Fortna forthcoming, chap. 3. Here, I control for the possible effects of the\ndemocratic peace by dropping those few observations in which both states are democracies (based on\nPolity data) in some tests.\n43.

Territorial disputes may be more salient\nthan other issues over which states rattle their swords, but not more important\nthan other issues over which states have already deemed it worth fighting a war.\nNeighboring states are estimated to be twice as likely to fight again, but this find-\ning is not always statistically significant.45\nAs Werner's argument would predict, changes in relative capabilities over time\ndo seem to be associated with the resumption of war. But it is not entirely clear\nfrom this finding which way the arrows run. Do changes in relative capabilities\nlead to war, or does war lead to changes in relative capability? For example, was\nthe India-Pakistan war over Bangladesh caused by Pakistan's falling capabilities,\nor did the war, which severed Pakistan in two, cause our measures of capability to\ndrop? Because many of the factors that go into the measure of a state's capability\n(population, energy consumption, and iron and steel production, among other things)\nare not likely to have an immediate effect on war-fighting capability, I lagged the\nmeasure of the change in relative capabilities by one year (see Model 3). The pos-\nitive effect on the risk of war drops away completely. In fact, the lagged variable\nshows that power shifts are associated with much more durable peace. This is\nprobably the result of a missing data bias,46 as it is unlikely that shifts in power\nare actually stabilizing. These results, however, cast significant doubt on the find-\ning that changes in relative capabilities cause peace to break down.47\nThe results for predictions of conflict in Buena de Mesquita and Lalman's\nexpected-utility international interaction game are inconsistent over various spec-\nifications of the model; in many (such as Model 4), they are associated with more\ndurable peace, exactly the opposite of what their predictions would expect.48 Con-\ntrolling for the democratic peace by dropping cases in which both sides have be-\ncome democratic does not significantly change other results.49\n44. The latter finding is driven largely, but not entirely, by the Arab-Israeli cases.\n45. While neighbors are more likely to fight in the first place, all of the states in these data have\nproven themselves to have both reason to fight and the ability to reach each other militarily. It is thus\nnot surprising that the effects of contiguity are weaker for the resumption of war than for propensity to\nfight in the first place.\n46. Data for this lagged variable are missing for the first year of each cease-fire. Inclusion of this\nvariable thus excludes the most short-lived cease-fires, those that fail within one year.\n47. This hypothesis deserves further testing with finer grain measures of military capabilities. Some\ncomponents of the COW capability index (military manpower and expenditures, for example) are likely\nto affect war-fighting ability more quickly than others (those tapping industrial power). War also is\nlikely to affect some components more quickly than others. To further complicate the picture, it may\nbe that states ramp up their military capabilities in anticipation of impending war, so that changing\ncapabilities may be an indicator, rather than a cause, of war.\n48. The results are no stronger if I generate predictions using S, as suggested by Signorino and\nRitter 1999, rather than Tau-B to measure policy similarity.\n49. Democracy in one but not both states is associated with very unstable peace, but this finding is\ndriven entirely by the cases involving Israel and India and is not robust to alternative model specifica-\ntions. While states in transition to democracy might be especially war-prone, democratization has no\nsignificant effect on the durability of peace. See Mansfield and Snyder 1995.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core. ReadCube, on 18 Jan 2017 at 04:10:45, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at\n354 International Organization\nThese findings suggest that it will be much harder to maintain peace in a case\nlike the 1948 cease-fire in the Arab-Israeli War--which took place without a clear\nvictor, between states whose entire history was marked by violence, and with the\nvery existence of one side at stake--than in a case such as the Falklands War, fought\nby states a long distance from each other with little previous history of militarized\nconflict, ending in a very lopsided victory for Britain, with a relatively low death toll.\nIn sum, then, to control for the baseline prospects for peace, one needs to con-\ntrol for the decisiveness of victory, the cost of war, the belligerents' previous his-\ntory of conflict, and whether the war threatened one side's existence. To be safe,\none might also want to control for contiguity, joint democracy, and for changes in\nrelative capability, though the latter might be spurious.\nAgreement Strength\nTable 2 shows the effects of the strength of cease-fire agreements (measured in\ntwo different ways) on the durability of peace. Estimates of both coefficients and\nhazard ratios are given. The subjective coding of agreement strength is a cate-\ngorical variable (none, very weak, weak, moderate, strong). Model 1 shows the\ncomparison to the omitted middle category (weak). As expected, the strongest agree-\nments yield the most durable peace, and moderately strong agreements perform\nbetter than weak ones. Compared to the median agreement (weak), moderate agree-\nments reduce the risk of another war by an estimated 57 percent (as indicated by\nthe hazard ratio of 0.43), and strong agreements reduce the hazard of failure by\nmore than 80 percent. Very weak agreements are associated with the least durable\npeace, faring perhaps even worse than no agreement at all. But compared to the\nmiddle category, peace falls apart more quickly with both very weak and no agree-\nments. These effects are jointly significant.50\nThe findings are even clearer if one uses the objective index of agreement strength\n(Model 2). The negative and statistically significant coefficient indicates that the\nstronger the agreement, the longer peace lasts, all else being equal. A unit increase\nin agreement strength is associated with about a 20 percent reduction in the risk of\nanother war. Overall, I find fairly strong support for the hypothesis that the con-\ntent of agreements matter. Even when one takes the baseline prospect for peace\ninto account, stronger agreements lead to more durable peace.\nAs this finding contrasts with Werner's finding that the existence of a peace\ntreaty has no significant effect on the durability of peace, it is worth exploring the\ndiscrepancy further.51 Werner's peace treaty variable codes whether the war ended\n50. Joint significance is determined with F-tests using STATA's \"test\" command.\n51. Werner 1999. Neither the difference in time period examined, nor whether all belligerents or\nonly principal participants are included accounts for the discrepancy in our findings. Neither restrict-\ning her model to post-1945 cases only, nor dropping minor participants from it makes a significant\ndifference to her results. Adding minor participants to my data would only strengthen the finding that\nstrong agreements last (most of these cases involve the Korean Armistice, a very strong agreement that\nhas lasted a very long time).\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

The\nKorean Armistice is a good example: it is a very strong (in my terms) agreement\nthat did not settle the underlying issue of the war.52 Plugging my variables of agree-\nment strength into Werner's model suggests tentatively that stronger agreements\nyield more durable peace. The coefficient for the index of strength becomes neg-\native, unlike the coefficient for Werner's treaty variable, indicating a reduction in\nthe hazard rate.53 The coefficient is not statistically significant, but with so few\ncases (and particularly so few peace failures) left in the data set, neither are the\nvariables that Werner concludes are important. This brings us to the second issue.\nIn Werner's data, only twelve of sixty-three post-World War II cases experi-\nence another round of fighting. Werner does not include cease-fires that fell apart\nso quickly that the new fighting was considered part of the same war. As ex-\nplained above, this results in selection bias. By ignoring the resumption of fight-\ning after a two-week cease-fire during the Turco-Cypriot War, for example, or the\nbreakdown of the first attempt at peace during the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli War, Wern-\ner's data truncates the dependent variable. Because these short-lived cease-fires\ntend not to be accompanied by strong peace agreements, omitting them biases find-\nings away from the conclusion that such agreements affect the durability of peace.\nBy coding not just the existence of an agreement but its content, and by including\ncease-fires that failed very quickly, I show that agreements matter.\nAssessing Individual Peace Mechanisms\nAlthough mechanisms to alter incentives, reduce uncertainty, and control acci-\ndents are effective in the aggregate, examining the effects of each peace mecha-\nnism individually is important to know how best to maintain peace. Tables 3 to 5\nshow the results of each mechanism in turn, controlling for the baseline prospects\nfor peace. Unfortunately, the small data set and problems of multicolinearity mean\nit is not possible to test all of these measures simultaneously. Because many as-\npects of agreements are correlated, it is difficult to reach strong conclusions about\nwhich measures are most effective relative to each other. For each mechanism, I\nchecked the results controlling for the other aspects of agreements that were highly\n52. In the data set used here, the variable political settlement (discussed further below) comes clos-\nest to Werner's variable. But note that the variables differ in some cases. We agree that Israel and\nEgypt eventually signed a peace treaty after the Yom Kippur War, for example, but while she treats the\nsecond Kashmir War as ending with a peace treaty, I code the Tashkent Agreement as a cease-fire, as it\ndid not settle the issue of Kashmir.\n53.

Note that while the trade-off between mul-\nticolinearity and omitted variable bias makes it difficult to assess precisely the\nrelative merits of each aspect of agreements, it does not call into doubt the general\nfinding that agreements matter in the construction of durable peace. The bias arises\nbecause the omitted agreement mechanisms also affect the durability of peace,\ncontradicting the null hypothesis that agreements do not matter.\nAs Table 3 indicates, withdrawing forces from the cease-fire line may reduce\nthe risk of another war, but not significantly so. Troops withdraw to the status\nquo ante in about one-third of the cases examined here, suggesting that the norm\nagainst taking (and keeping) territory by force is fairly strong. Failure to with-\ndraw from land captured during war has often laid the seeds for another round\nof fighting (the continuing strife over territories occupied by Israel in 1967 being\nthe best example). But returning to the prewar lines does not ensure peace.\nIsrael and Egypt fought again after Israel withdrew from the Sinai in 1956, for\nexample.\nDemilitarized zones (DMZs) to separate troops help foster durable peace. Even\npartial or very limited zones can help reduce the danger of accidents and skir-\nmishes (for example, the number of incidents between India and Pakistan dropped\nmarkedly when narrow DMZs were established after the first and second Kashmir\nwars), but this effect is only marginally significant. However, full DMZs (defined\nas those 2 km wide or more, running the full length of the cease-fire line) have a\nclear stabilizing effect, reducing the hazard of another war by about 90 percent.\nDMZs have contributed to peace between El Salvador and Honduras after the Foot-\nball War, in Korea, and between Israel and Syria in the Golan Heights. Arms con-\ntrol measures have not reduced the likelihood of recurrent war.55\nNor have measures to establish internal control over potential rogue groups made\npeace more stable. A number of cease-fire agreements specify that each side is\nresponsible for any hostile action coming from its territory. Such statements are\nnot effective at making states rein in irregular forces; in fact these statements are\nmore likely an indicator of a serious problem with rogue groups. In some cases\n(such as the Football War), there is evidence that concrete measures to disarm\nirregular forces can help cement peace. But in many cases, the problem has not\nbeen one of \"involuntary defection\" by rogue groups, but of the voluntary use of\nirregular forces to carry out covert aggression. This problem, especially promi-\nnent in India and Pakistan and in the Middle East, has not been effectively dealt\nwith.\n54. These checks produce far more output than can be printed here (complete data is available on-\nline at (http://www.columbia.edu/~vpf4/scraps.htm).

Out-\nsiders often help mediate a cease-fire, as the United States did for Israel and Egypt\nin 1970 to end the War of Attrition, or as Iran did in Armenia and Azerbaijan in\n1992. Third parties may also pressure client states to stop fighting, as in the Sinai\nWar and the Iran-Iraq War. This level of involvement may help warring states reach\na cease-fire to begin with, but it does not help them keep it. If anything, cease-\nfires reached with outside mediation appear to be more likely to break down quickly\n(the coefficient is positive but not significant). Explicit guarantees, though not ter-\nribly frequent, are much more successful. There are no cases of peace failing when\nan outside state has explicitly underwritten the cease-fire. Unlike in civil wars,\nsuch guarantees are not necessary56 (there are many cases of durable peace with-\nout them), but they clearly help reduce the risk of another war.\nTable 4 shows the effect of peacekeeping. The international community has sent\nmonitors or armed peacekeepers to about two-thirds of the interstate cease-fires in\nthe post-World War II era. These efforts have helped keep the peace, but the ef-\nfectiveness of peacekeeping can be easily undermined. The presence of monitors\nappears to lengthen the duration of peace.57 However, the presence of armed peace-\nkeepers does not have a statistically significant effect. A look at peacekeeping's\nrecord suggests an important difference between missions deployed at the time of\nthe cease-fire, and those already in place before the war broke out. More than half\nof peacekeeping's failures (that is, cases where peacekeepers were present and\nwar resumed) were those of missions deployed long before the cease-fire. In many\ncases these missions were largely inactive and had been discredited by their ear-\nlier failures. The UN Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), had been deployed in 1964 to\nhelp keep peace between Turkish and Greek Cypriots in an internal conflict. It\ncould do nothing to prevent military action by Turkey in 1974, nor was its pres-\nence effective in maintaining a cease-fire in the midst of the Turco-Cypriot War.\nBoth the UN Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) in the Middle East and\nthe UN Military Observer Group (UNMOGIP) in Kashmir were effective in the\nearly years of their deployments, but after more bouts of fighting--in 1956 and\nrendered useless. Both missions remain in place today, but are inactive.\nIf one drops cases in which peacekeeping contingents were already deployed be-\nfore the war (for example, keeping the first Arab-Israeli cease-fire when UNTSO\nwas first established but dropping subsequent cases in which UNTSO is the only\npeacekeeping mission), one can see that new peacekeeping missions have been quite\neffective.58 Of course, new peacekeeping missions are not foolproof, or there would\n57. This finding is not as strong when the Arab-Israeli conflict is controlled for. Deploying a larger\nnumber of peacekeepers seems to reduce the risk of another war, but this effect is not statistically\nsignificant (results not shown).\n58. Note that because almost all of the omitted cases are wars that ended with a decisive victory but\nwere repeated, the hazard ratio for the variable tie is highly exaggerated.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

But these measures have\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core. ReadCube, on 18 Jan 2017 at 04:10:45, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at\n362 International Organization\nbeen employed in only a few cases, making it is possible that this finding is merely\nan artifact of the data.\nI examined two types of dispute resolution between belligerents: that provided\nby ongoing third-party mediation after a cease-fire has been reached;60 and joint\ncommissions made up of representatives from both states in the war. The former\nis not an effective dispute resolution tool; in fact it is associated with peace that is\nsignificantly more likely to break down quickly. But joint commissions such as\nthose set up after the Korean War, between Ethiopia and Somalia in 1988, or be-\ntween El Salvador and Honduras in 1980, have been much more successful. The\nhistory of the armistice commissions between Israel and its Arab neighbors sug-\ngests that willingness to work within such a forum can provide an important sig-\nnal of intentions. These commissions worked well in their early years to settle\ndisputes over land use and fishing and farming rights, as well as to handle small\nincidents between soldiers. Conversely the breakdown of these regimes both sig-\nnaled and contributed to increasing hostility on both sides.61\nAll else being equal, the more specific the cease-fire agreement, the longer peace\ntends to last. More specific agreements also tend to implement other measures to\nkeep peace, but the finding that specificity reduces the hazard of another war holds\nup even when these other measures are controlled for. The most detailed agree-\nments, such as the Korean Armistice and the Israeli-Egyptian peace agreement,\nhave been followed by lasting peace. Cases of medium detail (China-India, the\nGulf War, and the two Kashmir Wars, for example) have had mixed success, and\nthe much less detailed agreements (for example, the Six Day War and the first\nTurco-Cypriot cease-fire) have tended to fail quickly. Demarcating the exact loca-\ntion of the cease-fire line put a halt to efforts on both sides to push for slight\nadvantages in the early days of each cease-fire between India and Pakistan.62 Of\ncourse, deliberate attacks cannot be stopped by specifying the location of the cease-\nfire line, but defining compliance can clearly help prevent skirmishing as both\nsides try to improve their positions.\nPeace tends to last longer after formal agreements than after tacit or unilaterally\ndeclared cease-fires, all else being equal, but the difference is not significant sta-\ntistically, nor terribly robust to different model specifications. Concern about in-\nternational audience costs often plays a role in states' decisions about whether,\nwhen, and how to fight each other. India and Pakistan, for example, have both\ntried hard not to appear as the aggressor in their repeated wars, using proxy forces\nrather than regular troops to initiate hostilities.63 These two states have also fought\n60. As opposed to mediation to reach a cease-fire, which was examined above.\n63. Pakistan sent Azad Kashmir forces across the cease-fire line in 1965, successfully laying the\nblame for the war on India's retaliation. India learned the lesson and sponsored the Mukti Bahini in-\nsurgency in East Pakistan (Bangladesh) in 1971.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

The general norm against aggression means that costs may be paid\neven for breaking an informal cease-fire. The international reaction has often been\nmuted, either by great powers turning a blind eye for strategic reasons (especially\nduring the Cold War), or by a UN reluctant to threaten its impartiality by naming\nan aggressor.65 Formalism may, therefore, not be the best way to test for the role\nof international audience costs.\nIn sum, arms control, third-party mediation, and attempts to control irregular\nforces have not helped maintain peace, and may in fact be associated with espe-\ncially fragile peace. Confidence-building measures, formalizing an agreement, and\nwithdrawal of forces may help, but the evidence to support their role is unclear.\nThe most effective tools for maintaining peace in the aftermath of war are demili-\ntarized zones, explicit third-party guarantees, peacekeeping, joint commissions for\ndispute resolution, and making the cease-fire specific.\nPolitical Settlement\nNot surprisingly, political agreement on the issues over which the war was fought\nleads to very durable peace (see Table 6). In fact, there are no cases in the wars\nexamined here in which both sides agreed explicitly to a political settlement and\nwar later resumed. But, as mentioned earlier, such settlement is quite rare in the\npost-World War II period. Only three wars led to an explicit agreement on the\nbasic dispute over which the war was fought: the Yom Kippur War between Israel\nand Egypt; the Iran-Iraq War, in which Iraq conceded the Shatt al'-Arab waterway\nto secure its flank with the outbreak of the Gulf War; and the Gulf War itself, in\nwhich Iraq formally renounced its claim to Kuwait when it surrendered.66 Wars\nthat end leaving the basic issues unsettled, as in the Korean Armistice, have been\nthe norm rather than the exception. Even if one includes settlements imposed uni-\nlaterally by a decisive victor (but without official acceptance by the defeated side,\nas in the Falklands), settlement is rather rare.67 This de facto category also ap-\nis so inhospitable, and because specifying a terminus would require agreement on the disputed border\nwith China.\n65. A blatant example of this was the UN's decision not to blame Pakistan for its role in starting the\n1965 war with India. For Secretary General U Thant's rationale, see UN document S/6651 (3 Septem-\n66. In a few other cases, belligerents eventually settled their political conflict many years after the\nwar ended, as Israel and Jordan did in 1994.\n67. The basic issue of the war has been settled unilaterally in eight wars (nine dyads) in these data:\nRussia-Hungary, China-India, Vietnam (North versus South), India and Pakistan in 1971, the second\nround of the Turco-Cypriot War, Uganda-Tanzania, the Falklands War, and the second part of the Azeri-\nArmenian War.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

The antagonism generated by the fighting is most\nraw just after hostilities end, and once things settle down, states should have a\nsomewhat easier time maintaining peace. This would suggest negative \"duration\ndependence\"; that is, a cease-fire's likelihood of failing (given that it has held thus\nfar) goes down over time. But if Fearon and others are right that one of the rea-\nsons states fight costly wars is the inability to gauge each other's capabilities and\nresolve (the combination of private information and incentives to misrepresent),\nthen one might expect peace to be easiest to maintain in the early stages.69 The\nwar just fought will have revealed information about military capabilities and po-\nlitical resolve. Over time, however, uncertainty will creep back in. This would\nlead one to expect positive duration dependence for the survival of peace; the risk\nof another war should increase with time.70\nThe shape parameter p, specifically whether it is greater than or less than one,\ngives an estimate of whether the risk of another war goes up or down, or stays the\nsame over the course of a cease-fire. In most of the models presented here, the\nshape parameter p is less than one, indicating that the hazard rate is decreasing.\nThe shape parameter p is only greater than one in models that are likely affected\nby missing data bias. This finding fits better with the intuitive notion that peace is\nmost fragile early on and solidifies over time than with the hypothesis derived\nfrom the perspective that sees war as a problem of information. But one should\nnote that the value of this parameter is not always statistically significant. The risk\nof war may simply be constant over time.71\nConclusion\nAre some war-torn areas simply doomed to repeated conflict and warfare, or is\nthere something that can be done to improve the chances for peace? The findings\nof this article warrant optimism. Peace is hard to maintain among deadly enemies,\nbut mechanisms implemented in the context of cease-fire agreements can help re-\nduce the risk of another war. Peace is precarious, but it is possible. Agreements\nare not merely scraps of paper, their content affects whether peace lasts or war\nresumes.\n70. On the importance of considering duration dependence, see Beck, Katz, and Tucker 1998.\n71. Note that independent variables should \"soak up\" or explain some of the duration dependence,\nso it is not surprising that in more completely specified models, p is closer to one.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

It is more\ndifficult when wars end in stalemates, when states' previous history is riddled with\nconflict, and when war can threaten the very existence of one side. It seems to be\nharder for neighbors, but it is easier when states have just fought a very deadly\nwar, giving a greater incentive to avoid further bloodshed.\nBut given these givens, states can act to improve the chances for peace. I have\nfocused on measures that: alter incentives by raising the cost of an attack either\nphysically or politically; reduce uncertainty by specifying compliance, regulating\nactivities that are likely to cause tension, providing credible signals of intention;\nor help prevent or manage accidents from spiraling back to war. Do these mea-\nsures help encourage durable peace? I find that, in general, they do. All else being\nequal, peace lasts longer when stronger agreements, implementing more of these\nmeasures, are in place. A counterargument suggests that strong agreements are\nonly associated with durable peace because they are implemented in the easy cases.\nBut the effects of agreements do not wash out when the baseline prospects for\npeace are controlled for.\nWhile some international relations scholars might be surprised to learn that states\ncan institute measures to overcome the obstacles to peace, practitioners probably\nknow this already. For them, the value of this research is in its lessons about which\nmechanisms work better than others. Because these measures are often imple-\nmented in conjunction with each other, one cannot reach conclusions about this that\nare as strong as one might like. But the history of cease-fires over the past half-\ncentury suggests that creating buffer zones between opposing armies is quite ef-\nfective. Making the terms of the cease-fire, including the location of the cease-fire\nline, as specific as possible is also important, as is setting up joint commissions to\ndiscuss the inevitable conflicts and misunderstandings that arise in the aftermath\nof fighting. Confidence-building measures, formal agreements, and withdrawal of\nforces do not hurt, but the evidence that these measure help is less clear-cut.\nFor their part, outsiders interested in helping belligerents maintain peace can\nimprove its chances by providing an explicitly stated guarantee of the cease-fire,\nand by deploying international monitors or troops as peacekeepers. But third par-\nties should be aware that mediation to reach a cease-fire may be counterproduc-\ntive in the long run. Peacekeeping can easily become discredited. Leaving a mission\nin place after it has failed does little to bolster the prospects for peace.\nThat states can implement measures to reduce the risk of another war raises the\nquestion of whether they can do more to prevent war breaking out in the first\nplace. If demilitarized zones or peacekeeping can help maintain peace after war,\ncan they do so beforehand? Obviously one cannot answer this question defini-\ntively without a wider study, but at least in theory, the measures discussed above\nshould be effective preemptively. The challenge is likely to be in convincing states\nto implement them. It is normal, and therefore politically more acceptable, to take\nmeasures to ensure peace in the aftermath of war. Giving up territory to create a\nbuffer zone or allowing international peacekeepers to infringe on their sover-\neignty before hostilities break out, of course, is more difficult.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.
