Drawing largely from the culture history of precolonial/prepolitical Africans--that is, the Bantu/\nCushitic-Ethiopians (Azanians)--the author has demonstrated vividly that far from being distinct ethno-culture national\ncommunities, the so-called tribes of African states are better considered subculture groups, whose regional culture practices\nerstwhile paid tribute to their nation's main culture center in Karnak. For example, using the culture symbols and practices\nof some local groups and linking them to the predynastic and dynastic Pharaonic periods, I argued that there is compelling\nevidence against qualifying Africa's tribes as distinct ethno-culture national entities. In genuine culture context, I stressed that\nthe Ritual of Resurrection and its twin culture process of the mummification of deceased indigenous Pharaohs tend to suggest\nthat the object of the Bantu/Cushitic-Ethiopians national culture was life (in its eternal manifestation) and then resurrection\nlater, and that there are recurring (culturally sanctioned) ethical examples among the culture custodians of these subculture\ngroups that generally pay tribute to the overarching culture norm. Furthermore, the fact that the Ritual of Resurrection\nbegan in the Delta region and ended at the Sources of the Nile, where the spirit of the deceased indigenous Pharaohs was\nintroduced into the spiritual world of their ancestors, contradicts conventional perceptions that ancient Egypt was a distinct\nnational community isolated from precolonial/prepolitical Africa/Azania.\n",

Hence, ethno-\nculturally, I discussed the concept of \"Pan-ism\" in relation to\nprecolonial/prepoliticalAfrican--that is, theAzanian (or later\nancient Egyptian) pan-deity Min.1 Moreover, although I dis-\ncussed the importance of the \"Ritual of Resurrection\" (see\ntwin culture process of the \"mummification of the indigenous\nPharaohs\" to the objective of the Azanian national culture, I\nstressed that such symbolic culture practices are supplemen-\ntary to that nation's culture commitment to the eternal essence\nof life, Manfou[i]r/Menefre (the Greco-European Memphis).2\nIt is in light of such culture commitment and the fact that the\nwhole Nile Valley region was an inextricable part of these\nculture processes that I questioned the national essence of the\npan-African Movement(s)/PAMs and/or the numerous irre-\ndentist movements on Africa's political plain, especially\ngiven most African leaders subscription to the colonial ideal\n(theAfrican states) through which a United States ofAfrica or\nAfrica's newly emerging tribal entities (e.g., the Biafras,\nHutustan, Eritrea, Somali-land, etc.) could be forged.\nPut simply, ethnic and culture reasons prompted my cri-\ntique of both Pan-Africanism and Africa's tribal (pseudoeth-\nnic) irredentism. For instance, after meticulously scrutinizing\nthe process by which Eritrea forged its national identity, and\non the basis of which it eventually achieved statehood, and\nSomaliland's apparent route to secession, the scholar\nDominique Jacquin-Berdal (2002) came to the conclusion\nthat in both cases it was the \"colonial self\" rather than ethnic-\nity that provided the basis for secession, while it was \"war\"\nthat proved to be the catalyst of nation formation.

The second was the period of\ninstitutions and symbols of autonomy, and finally the libera-\ntion war itself, during which the nationalist struggle gradu-\nally spread from a small elite to encompass the Eritrean\nmasses. It was also during this period that Eritrea's identity\nwas cemented and given its present characteristic by the\n\"dominant Movement,\" the Eritrean People's Liberation\nFront (EPLF). In other words, while Dominique's position\nseems close to sharing the ethno-symbolist perception that\nhowever, in her analysis of Africa's state-nations that straw\nwas not ethnic. Thus, in her critique of the ethnic interpreta-\ntion of the origins and spread of nationalism, her argument is\nsimply that in much of Africa, ethnicity as much as national-\nism is a modern creation. She maintains accurately that, the\ncolonial administration's need to \"map\" the population under\nits control led to the establishment of categories whose con-\ntours were in many cases substantially different from those\nthat had previously prevailed (Jacquin-Berdal, 2002).\nDominique's lucid analysis, among others, has proven\ncritical to the novel concept of pseudoethnicity and pseudona-\ntionalism developed in Azanism with specific reference to\ncontemporary African politics. This is particularly true of\nMuamar Gaddafi's recent (preassassination) approval of the\npartitioning of Nigeria into Christians and Islamist dominated\nstates. Subsequently, this essaic-article which is meant to\nstrengthen the ethno-culture paradigm of real nations shall\nthus expand on the concept of genuine-/pseudonationalism so\nas to elaborate on that position. Because this article is gener-\nally meant to expose the culture deficit of postcolonialAfrican\npolitics, it will thus be reasonable to critically review the\nmajor inconsistencies characterizing the political mandate of\nsome key PAM(s) figures (e.g., the late Kwame Nkrumah,\nJulius Nyerere, and Muammar Gaddafi). This should demon-\nstrate how PAMs' political mandate continues to adversely\naffect the indigenous people's culture quest for genuine free-\ndom(see\"QuestioningthePan-AfricanistUnionistParadigm\"\nsection).\nIndeed Gaddafi's approval of pseudoethnic entities/iden-\ntities on Africa's political plain accords with early colonial-\nist attempts to create tribal states in colonial Africa. Such a\ndivisive heritage, which doubtlessly has become synony-\nmous with contemporary African politics, can rightly be\ncontrasted with the urge in Azanism to rediscover the ethno-\nculture origin of the Azanian nation. Following this ethno-\nculture emphasis in Azanism, I will thus seek to explore the\nethnic affinities spanning across the subculture groups of\nNhana (ancient Ghana) with the view to reintegrating them\nin the culture fold/school of the Azanian nation (see \"Are\nWe at the Verge of a Genuine Ethno-Cultural National\nReawakening?\" section).\nQuestioning the Pan-Africanist Unionist\nParadigm\nA Review of Muammar Gaddafi's Approval of\nPseudoethnic Identities in Colonial Africa\nPrior to his assassination in August 2011, Muammar Gaddafi\nwas generally heralded by advocates of pan-Africanism as a\ngreat unionist leader--despite obvious facts to the contrary.\nIn fact, some even considered him then to be the rightful heir\nto Nkrumah's pan-Africanism (and hence the champion of\nAfrican Unity [AU]). Such fortuitous approval of Gaddafi\nunionist credentials had--mirabile dictu--been made in bla-\ntant disregard to his divisive stance vis-\u00e0-vis Nigeria's polit-\nico-religious crisis, which could easily be replicated across\nthe whole of colonial Africa. In any event, the prevailing ido-\nlum that the culture values of the indigenous peoples of colo-\nnial Africa are inferior to the dominant politico-religious\ncultures imposed on them by agents of colonialism is widely\napproved by local politicians. It should therefore not come as\nsurprise that the main beneficiaries of Gaddafi's financial\nintrigue among the satraps (leaders?) of the African states\n(and leaders of African communities in the diaspora) had in\nthe past overlooked the divisive statements of that erratic\ncharacter, who until his demise disguised himself for a\nstaunch defender of the AU.\nFor example, speaking to the mammoth crowd that braved\nthe afternoon heat in Nakivubo War Memorial Stadium after\nleading the Thuhur (afternoon) prayers, Muammar Gaddafi\n(on the occasion to openAfrica's largest Mosque in Kampala)\nstated that \"any Bible or Tora (Old Testament) that does not\nmention prophet Mohamed was written by mankind and\ntherefore a fraud.\"3\nDespite his Islamic bias, Professor Ali A. Mazrui--on\nthe occasion of Kwame Nkrumah's 100th Anniversary--\npostulated Gaddafi as the timely heir to Nkrumah's legacy\nof pan-Africanism (Mazrui, 2009). Even Gaddafi's app-\nroval of the partitioning of Nigeria into Christians- and\nMoslems-dominated pseudoethnic state-nations had also\nbeen largely overlooked by most local commentators. In\nfact, the official condemnation issued by the foreign min-\nistry in Nigeria (after Gaddafi's divisive remarks) amounts\nto such nugatory statement as \"Colonel Gaddafi's irre-\nsponsible utterances\" or \"his theatrics and grandstanding\nat every auspicious occasion have become too numerous to\nrecount.\" Astonishingly, that was the official response to\nGaddafi's overt approval of the partition of India in 1947\nas the kind of historic solution that could benefit Nigeria.4\nIf anything, such a divisive statement does not seem to\nperson the AU.\nTrue, prior to becoming the AU chairperson in 2009,\nGaddafi was factitiously outspoken about the urgent need for\na United States of Africa,5 And had once stated that \"I shall\ncontinue to insist that our sovereign countries work to\nachieve the United States of Africa.\"6 He even went as far\n\"envisaging a single military force, a single currency, and a\nsingle passport for the Africans to move freely around the\ncontinent.\"7 Probably attracted by the Bantu-Ethiopian\nPharaonic title, the then Libyan strongman had earlier a\ngroup of 200 traditional African chiefs named him the \"King\nof kings,\" thus signaling his disdain for the prevailing demo-\ncratic nostrum being imposed on the African states by\nWestern powers. Speaking at the AU summit in Addis Ababa\nin 2009, Gaddafi was aplomb and perhaps atarvistic about\nthe shortcomings of democracy in Africa. As he puts it,\nAfrica was essentially tribal; and multiparty democracy only\nworsens the situation as most political parties draw their core\nsupport base along tribal lines. Thus, his radical solution for\nAfrica's tribal political allegiances was the Libyan example\nwhere opposition parties were outlawed.8\nHis Arabo-Islamic bias became more apparent when he\ninsisted on the inclusion of the Islamic code of practice in\nAU decision-making process in which \"silence on important\npolicy issues is considered a tacit approval.\"9\nGaddafi's Arabo-Islamic bias notwithstanding, his cun-\nning admiration of the indigenous Pharaonic model10 doubt-\nlessly earned him then the allegiance and support of some\ntraditional chiefs, which, in the event of genuine national\nrevival, would have weighed significantly on the conscience\nof the Azanians. This notwithstanding, it should be empha-\nsized that not all pan-Africanists were comfortable with\nGaddafi's grand political ambitions. For instance, Yao\nGraham, who is critical of the AU's choice of Gaddafi as the\nUnion chairperson in 2009, argued vehemently against con-\nfusing Gaddafi's political opportunism with Nkrumah's pan-\nAfrican dreams. Citing the much quoted phrase of David\nRooney's Critical Biography on Kwame Nkrumah, \"His\nhopes were encapsulated in his ultimate goal of a united\nAfrica in which its rich natural resources would benefit its\npeople and not the capitalist system and other exploiters,\" he\ncautioned against accrediting Gaddafi with Nkrumah's grand\nIndeed, whether or not Gaddafi merits the credit of a gen-\nuine unionist leader is ineluctably pivotal in that while he\nwould have imposed the Arabic language and the Islamic\nfaith on the indigenous people of a United States of Africa;\nand had in the past also used the pelf of Libya to finance the\ndestabilization of African states south of the Nubian Desert\n(e.g., Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Somalia, Ethiopia,\nNigeria, and Uganda); and had even implicitly sponsored the\ndisplacement and misappropriation of indigenous land in\nMali, Niger and Mauritania, and so on to make more\n\"Lebensraum for the `Second-Phase' of Arabs colonial\nexpansion\" (Chinweizu, 2006); there is no doubt that most\npan-Africanists would rather shy away from Nkrumah's\npolitical shortcomings vis-\u00e0-vis his people's culture quest for\nreal freedom and national unity.\nI observed in Azanism that Kwame Nkrumah was also\nforthrightly outspoken about his internationalist ambitions\nand, above all, his commitment to scientific socialism. Thus,\nin genuine national context (in which the freedom of a peo-\nple is the inspiration behind nationalist movements), that\nKwame Nkrumah--in light of his fortuitous conviction to\nthe lineal/progressive economic ideal of scientific social-\nism--would have exonerated Karl Marx11 (from his ambiva-\nlent approval of British colonial rule in India or the superior\nGermanics colonization of Peasant Slavs in Europe) is bound\nto taint Nkrumah's national credentials significantly.\nNkrumah's generous political (and not cultural) commitment\ntoAU until his death in 1972 could be summed up in his link-\ning of Gold Coast or modern Ghana's independence to that\nof the rest of colonial Africa, as in this statement\ndie Freiheit und Unh\u00e4ngigkeit Ghanas ist bedeutunglos, wenn\nsie nicht mit den totalen Befreiung Afrikas verkn\u00fcft wird [The\nIndependence of Ghana is meaningless unless it is linked up\nwith that of the total liberation of the African continent].\nHowever, his ambivalent approval of the atrocities associ-\nated with scientific socialism raises more questions about his\ngenuine commitment to the freedom of his people. If any-\nthing, it should thus be emphasized that Kwame Nkrumah,\nlike Yao Graham who today (like most pan-African cadres)\nlauds his democratic bias, was equally enthusiastic about his\ncontemporary \"Scientific Socialism.\"12\nInevitably, Nkrumah's myopic political obligation to the\nlineal economic ideal of his contemporary scientific social-\nism made him, like some of his predecessors,13 yet another\nvictim of similar political marriages that was to later cement\nthe incremental infiltration and destruction of the Bantu/\nCushitic-Ethiopians culture institutions by economically\ninspired political influx mainly from the north and northeast-\nern fringes of the Azanian nation. Lamentably, that such\npolitical influx then and now has the intent of seizing control\nof the culture centers of the Azanian nation and her vast natu-\nral resources also found mention in Diop's (1974) African\nOrigin of Civilization: Myth or Reality.\nThe Persistence of the Indigenous Culture and Its\nImportance to National Revival\nIn light of the fact that, prior to being a committed pan-\nAfricanist, Nkrumah was first an advocate of West Azania's\n(Africa's?) independence and unity via scientific socialism\n(as this is evidenced by his invocation of the concept of\nNhana/ancient Ghana for his supposedly newly indepen-\ndent Gold Coast), let's critically review the culture essence\nof Nhana so as to demonstrate why national emancipation\nprocess that fails to embrace the institutions of indigenous\n4 SAGE Open\nculture(s) is bound to be superficial and tenuous. For\ninstance, Diop (1959), who had researched the social history\nof the Bantu-Ethiopians extensively, traces the concept of\nNhana back to the demise of Meroe14--one of the last ref-\nuges of the retreating custodians of the Azanian national cul-\nture. Although there is still no academic consensus about the\norigin of Nhana per se, most scholars now agree that that\nkingdom was a genuine indigenous communal or social\nendeavor; and that most of the indigenous subculture groups\nof (what is formally) the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) region played a pivotal role in its\nfoundation (Hannah, 1967). Importantly, in its over thousand\nyears history (which began around the 1st century a.d.), the\nculture and political influence of Nhana stretched from the\nWestern fringes of present day Sudan covering the whole of\nthe ECOWAS region (West Sudan) and parts of Southern and\nCentral Algeria and Morocco. Consequently, any political\nattempt to resuscitate the concept of Nhana would inelucta-\nbly have had wider cultural implications for the region's\nindigenous communities. In fact, judging from that concept\nof culture significance and/or its indispensability in terms of\nthose people's moral obligation to the institutions of Azanian\nculture (e.g., in Manfou(i)r [Menefre]/Memphis, Aiwn [On]\nBeth-Shemesh or Heliopolis, Karnak/Luxor/Thebes, and or\nMeroe, etc.), it would have been inconceivable for genuine\nnationalists to associate themselves with such economically\nderived external political ideas which historically are respon-\nsible for the demise of the Azanian culture.\nEven if one would contest the Azanian nationalists proc-\nlamation that the foundation stone of Nhana was laid by\ndescendants of the Bantu-Ethiopian Pharaohs, who, in that\ncritical period of their nation's social history, were busily\nrelocating that nation's invaluable culture heritage to a secure\nlocation, the convincing parallels drawn in Azanism between\nthe Moabas Sun-God Hyen-Nu (One Hand) and the dynastic\nEthiopian (and later Egyptian) Heru/Horus (or Amon and\nAton15), and the similarities also shown in that work between\nthe kingship title of the Moab[a]s, B\u00e9t (messenger, announcer,\nteller, etc.) and Bes-Ptah of the early Pharaonic culture unde-\nniably tilts in favor of culture contiguity. In fact, according to\nthe mythological stipulation of the Moabas origin, especially\nthe group which identifies itself as \"Luok-Niib\" (inhabitants\nof the Underworld16), their early male ancestor (Nyaan), like\nBes-Ptah (and his seven deified-assistants), who founded the\nfirst earthly Order (after the perfect/prehuman World Order\nfounded by Hyen-Nu), had four wives--each representing\nprobably the geographical axis of mainland Azania or the\nquadrant angles the matriarchal foundation of the Pyramids--\nwho bore him seven sons. These became the seven extant\nethnic extensions of that Bantu-Ethiopian subculture group,\nwhich could not only be rightly paralleled with the assistants\nof Bes-Ptah, but also made up the 12 astronomical figures\nrepresented in the so-called ancient Egyptian Calendar. Also,\nin his Signs and Symbols of Primordial Man: The Evolution\nof Religious Doctrines from the Eschatology of Ancient\nEgyptians, Albert Churchward (1994), who researched the\ntraditional customs of the local population, observed that that\nsymbolic culture figure \"Seven\" is in widespread use across\nthe whole of Azania. Thus, if anything, it is culturally impel-\nling that the elderly of the Moabas are morally constrained\nfrom eating the flesh of the predynastic Crocodile deity\nSubk/Sebek. And the same is true of the culture custodians of\nthe Bawul\u00e9s (in Ivory Coast), who until today refrain from\neating the flesh of rams--the culture symbol of Amon. By\nsimilar analytical token, a critical review of that mysterious\nculture animus, Bamaka-Koo (Crocodile of water), from\nwhence Bamako (Mali's capital) is derived, would confirm\nthat Bamaka-Koo has indeed conceptual affinity with the\nSebek deity of the dynastic period. And the same could be\nargued of the mysterious eternal giant black Serpent of the\nDogon Pantheon.\nNot surprisingly, the wealth and demise of ancient Ghana\nunavoidably found mythological elaboration in a ritualistic\npractice in honor of a giant black Serpent, Bida. However,\nunlike the giant black serpent which, in a genuine culture\ncontext, symbolizes the eternal Spirit of the Bantu-Ethiopians\ncommon ancestry (placed on an Island at the sources of the\nWhite Nile in Azanism), Bida had--by the time of Nhana's\ndemise--inherited the cannibalistic psychology associated\nwith the political cultures of the incoming barbarians (from\nthe north and northeastern fringes bordering the Azanian\nnation), who, as noted earlier, were largely responsible for\nthe incremental destruction of the institutions of the Azanian\nculture.17 Thus, whether or not such interrelated and sym-\nbolic culture practices and/or norms, especially the moral\nrefrain from cannibalism, reflect the true objective of the\nAzanian culture,18 it can be stressed without erring that the\nMoabas played a central role in the foundation of Nghana. In\nfact, in Azanism, I derived the concept of Nghana (am I\ngood?) from Moar/Mol\u00e9--the language of the Moabas. This\nculturally pivotal Bantu-Ethiopian group is referred to in\nWilliam's (1989) work as Patan-Grumah (a federation of the\nformer Mossi Kingdom). He described them as a sedentary\nfolk, who (in Azanism) are still found in present day Chad,\nGuinea, modern Nhana (Ghana?), Mali, Niger, Sudan,\nTo[n]go, and probably beyond. Accordingly, despite the fact\nthat the social psychology of those who still associate them-\nselves with the concept of colonial Africa is being influenced\nby external political ideas, the Azanians could forestall the\npan-Africanists political preference of pseudoethnic entities\n(e.g., Biafra, Hutustans, Eritrea, etc. in Africa) by adversely\nopting for the total liberation of Azania (and with it the rein-\nstitutionalization of her culture institutions).\nAlas, Kwame Nkrumah was not alone in his readiness to\nrelinquish northern Azania to Arabs colonial occupation. In a\nprivately circulated article titled, \"Nyerere's Last Advice to\nBlack Africa--Retreat From Continentalist to Sub-Saharan\npan-Africanism,\" Chinweizu (1987), the author of\nDecolonizing the African Mind, hinted to the fact that the late\nJulius Nyerere, who in 1963 considered colonial Africa to be\nsingle geopolitical unit (with its present inhabitants repre-\nsenting one geopolitical constituency), was apt to declare in\n1997 that Africa South of the Sahara should henceforth be\nconsidered a distinct political unit which is quite separate in\nits identity and destiny from the Arabs-occupied part of\nAfrica (see Godfrey, n.d.). While Chinweizu is doubtlessly\nvocal about the resurgence of Arab colonialism in Africa\nsince the 1960s--after the \"First Phase\" was interrupted by\nthe political development of the Ottoman Empire--and later\nWest Europeans colonial inroads into Africa between the 17\nand 20th centuries, and tends to share Nyerere's proposition\nto unify the indigenous population of colonial Africa South\nof the Nubian (Sahara?) desert, it seems rather unclear\nwhether such a political union would imply relinquishing the\n\"Sacred Land\" of the Bantu-Ethiopians national culture to\nArab colonialism. This notwithstanding, Chinweizu's lament\nabout the erosion of traditional culture norms amid the con-\ntinuing colonial pressures and his urge on the need for the\nindigenous people of colonial Africa to resuscitate the cul-\nture institutions of their forebears as guidance for the\nfuture--in many of his privately circulated writings--merits\nnationalists attention.\nAlso, despite most pan-Africanists capitulation to the\npending Arab colonialism, there is no doubt that Kwame\nNkrumah's invocation of such culture terms as Nhana\nSouth Africa, respectively, and/or Nyerere's perception of a\npeople's identity and destiny would resonate ethno-culturally\namong revivalist intellectuals. Furthermore, Professor Ali A.\nMazrui's distinction between \"Africans of the Blood and\nAfricans of the Soil\" is contemporaneous with national\nreproduction ideas in that he rightly includes the Azanians\n(Africans?) of the Diaspora (i.e., the Azanian Americans) in\nhis list of the indigenous Azanians (or his Africans of the\nBlood and Soil). Notably, he defined this original group in\nracial and genealogical terms; and hence identifies them with\nthe Blackness of Cham/Kemit. However, most Algerians,\nLibyans, Egyptians, Tunisians, and Moroccans are those of\nthe soil and not necessarily of Blood (see Mazrui, 2009).\nIn genuine national context, revivalists could reasonably\nargue that in addition to the irreducibility of the Nile Valley\nregion to the culture custodians of the Azanian nation\n(because of the process of the \"Ritual of Resurrection\"), the\nfact that among the citizens of Arabs-occupied part of colo-\nnial Africa there are indigenous Azanians (e.g., the Nubians,\nthe assimilated or aboriginalArabs such as the blackArabs in\nSudan or the so-called Semitic Ethiopians or Somalians) is\nbound to have serious ethno-culture and national implica-\ntions for those Pan-Africanists who (in their blind service of\nthe colonial ideal [Africa's 53 states]) would rather forego\nthe sacred land of the Azanians to Arab colonialism. Despite\ntheir subordinate economic and political status under the\npending Arab colonial occupation, these marginalized and\nneglected indigenous Azanians must be encouraged to resist\nthe colonial pillage of their ancestral (Cham's) land.\nAre We at the Verge of a Genuine\nEthno-Cultural National Reawakening?\nEven provided we eschew Gaddafi's plaudit of pseudoethnic\nentities in Africa because of the political reality in Libya\ntoday, the fact that key members of the AU overtly condoned\nthe NATOAir Strikes which led to overthrow of the Gaddafi's\nregime (and his consequent assassination) shows how futile\nthe AU really is. Already, Gaddafi's early emphatic approval\nof the creation of pseudoethnic entities in Nigeria amounts to\ndeclaring the whole pan-African project moribund. So, even\nif the pan-Africanists would forgive the late Gaddafi for his\ndirect role in the destabilization of other African states (e.g.,\nChad, Mali, Niger, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Uganda,\netc.) in the recent past, the universal indifference of Arab\nleaders to the systematic genocide and ethnic cleansing in\nSudan (e.g., in Dafur, South Kordofan, the Nuba Mountains,\netc.), and/or their silence on the deportation of hundreds of\nthousands of indigenous Azanians from Mauritania in the\nentirely different agenda for participating in the political pro-\ncess of the AU. For instance, I noted in Azanism that revival-\nist intellectuals do not necessarily have to invoke the decline\nof the culture institutions of Uruk (Sumer/Sumeria), which at\nthe onset was founded and controlled by Anu (and his daugh-\nter Ishtar/Isis),19 and/or the directly related historic occupa-\ntion of the Delta region by the Hyksos, to grasp the\ngeographical reach of their nation's culture institutions. In\nfact, Am\u00e9lineau Abb\u00e9 Emile (1916), who had mistaken the\nAnu for an ethnic group, is also quoted in Diop's (1974)\nAfrican Origin of Civilization: Myth or Reality (see Guevara,\ninhabitants of Egypt and Arabia Patraea. So, the fact that\nsome of these occupied territories are now considered indig-\nenous to Arab colonialists suffices as a warning to revivalist\nintellectuals who still see the Great Nile Valley region as an\nirreducible part of their nation's culture practices.\nIn essence, this analytical discernment which, as men-\ntioned earlier, is meant to reintegrate the subcultures of the\nindigenous Azanians into the main culture school in Karnak/\nLuxor does not necessarily imply that Karnak is the birth\nplace of the Bantu/Cushitic-Ethiopians national culture.\nThus, in referring to the celestial orientation of the Bantu-\nEthiopians national culture, I argued in Azanism that the\nplacement of the green Nile goddess Hapi on the Mountain\nof the Moon (mountain Kilimanjaro), the Highest peak in\nAzania, prior to the construction of the miniature Pyramids\nin Meroe and then later the Great Pyramids of Giza--built\nduring the period of the Solar Mythos (as by then the culture\ncustodians of the Azanian nation would have probably\nestablished the precise location from which they could com-\nmunicate proficiently with the celestial bodies)--suggests\nthat the origin of that particular national culture lies further\nSouth, as in this Neferti's optimism about the eventual res-\ntoration of the Maat:\n6 SAGE Open\nA king will come from the South;\nAmeni, the justified, is his name,\nThe son of a woman of Nubia,\nand a child of Upper Egypt,\nHe shall receive the white crown and wear the red crown.\nThis perception is further strengthened by the fact that the\npopular \"Ritual [of Ausar/Osiris] Resurrection,\" which at its\npeak, began with the introduction of the Sektit/Seher (also\ncalled Hennu's) Boat through the tale of the Great Nile in the\nDelta region ended at the source of the great Nile River in the\nCongo-belt, where the eternal Spirit of the Bantu-Ethiopians\nancestors (in the form of a giant black Serpent) was origi-\nnally located. Eventually, whether or not one equates the\nsymbolic culture act of having to travel upstream against the\nwaves of the great Nile River with the idea of traveling\nthrough the culture symbol of the eternal Spirit of the\nAzaninans'common ancestry, it remains to be said that (from\nthe perspective of the Azanian national culture) the quest for\neternity was never meant to be entrusted to the profane or the\nvulgar demoi. Hence, neither the wheel of the Hennu's Boat\nnor the presentation of the Maat was confided to the profane/\ndemoi. In other words, that all Azanians are in line with the\nmoral objective of their nation's culture entitled to the right\nkind of knowledge about eternal life does not necessarily\nreduce the gerontocratic constitution of the Bantu/Cushitic-\nEthiopians pharaonic culture. In this sense, the embracement\nof the market-led liberal democratic institutions by both the\nfounding fathers and current leaders of PAMs and/or the AU\nnot only shows how disingenuous these really are on the sub-\nject of the emancipation of the Azanians but also how irrec-\noncilable their political objectives are in juxtaposition to that\nof the Azanian culture.\nThe eternal essence of that nation's culture practice has\nfound its convincing elaboration in Doctrina Azanica\n(Azanism). This position is also shared in Maulana Karenga's\nMaatian ethics. For instance, drawing on King Kheti's justifi-\ncation for the practice of Maat, Karenga (2006) observed that\n\"the stress on justification is not simply in the sense of being\njust but also in a sense of living Maat that would justify\nimmortality\" (p. 60). Maat is described as \"nourishment for\nRa (the perfect embodiment of life); Ra lives by it, it is offered\nMaat is also a nourishment for all the divinities as well as\nhumans who strive for eternity, as stressed in Coffin Text\n(CT) IV, 62, 170. Accordingly, the Maatian ethics which orig-\ninated from the cultural history of the Old Kingdom was, first,\nestablished as a moral order with divine, natural and social\ndimensions. Secondly, Maat is counter-posed with isfet (evil,\nchaos, wrong-doing) as well as with . . . grg (falsehood) and\nwrong-doing. Thirdly, Maat is a standard and measure of both\nmoral life on the personal and social level. Fourthly, Maat is tied\nto the concept of moral and social excellence . . . and the resultant\nworthiness. Finally, the ground of Maat is that it's God's will,\nand thus the King's will and that it is good, effective and life-\nEconomic Agents' Political Role in the Demise of\nthe Azanian Culture\nIf from the onset of their nation's social history, the Azanians\nhad the moral obligation to endure such an indispensable cul-\nture journey that is likened to the traversing of the inner part\nof a black Serpent (as in the Ritual of Resurrection), one\ncould reasonably foresee why the alliance of external and\ninternal political agents--inspired by myopic economic\nobjectives--have until today proven so detrimental to that\nnation's culture institutions. Notably, \"the divine inspiration\nto cultivate a perfect humanity capable of inhabiting both the\nterrestrial and celestial provinces\"20 (as illustrated in the\ncelestial orientation of the Azanian culture earlier) is doubt-\nlessly irreconcilable with the sanguinary trait of the econom-\nically inspired state system, whose expansive policies are\ntoday responsible for the destruction of preestablished\nculture(s). In terms of the demise of the institutions of the\nAzanian national culture, historic records attest that the sys-\ntematic/incremental infiltration (and usurpation) of that\nnation's culture institutions by state agents goes as far back\nas the antiquity. Early record of such economically inspired\npolitical incursions is associated with the southward expan-\nsion of the Greco-Europeans, who are generally known to\nhave introduced the patriarchal system (capitalist patriarchy)\nin Azania. Importantly, one should read early Greco-\nEuropean migrations and settlements in three waves; and,\nabove all, in light of the culture deficit (and/or failures) of the\nexpansive state system. Ostensibly,\nthe first is associated with the Ionian and Dorian migrations of\nthe last century of the 2nd Millennium BCE, which resulted in\nthe settlements of City-States in Western Anatolia and was\nprobably associated with the \"Sea Peoples\" (Hyksos) who later\nappeared in Egypt and Canaan (as the Philistines). The second\nand third waves, which occurred around 800 and 600 BCE, were\nhighly organized land rush ... where City-States sought to\nexpand their influence and relieve over-population. (Guevara,\nNotably, the remark about the perpetual trend of the native\npopulations--and state agents rational historic response to\nsuch a natural phenomenon through state expansionism--is\ninevitably culturally imperative. That in turn impels this\nancient testimony about the economic mind approach to\nnative lands--the invaluable/irreducible culture assets of all\nnations: \"Joseph bought all the land of the Egyptians, except\nthem by Ausar (Osiris; the god King) to cover the cost of\nthe indigenous population of the then occupied Egypt (north-\nern part of Azania) were politically coerced into selling their\nland (the source of earthly life) in exchange for a grain of\ncorn from that early external capitalist agent (Joseph), the\nbible tells us that there was this terrific famine of all times in\nthat part ofAzania.Although the bible has until now remained\nsilent on the question whether that could possibly have been\na man-made famine intended to force the local population off\ntheir ancestral land, it can rightly be argued that such polit-\nico-economic developments explain why the culture custodi-\nans of the Bantu-Ethiopian kingdom have historically been\nat the forefront of national emancipation and revival move-\nment. Notwithstanding, it is worth adding that by the turn of\nthe 7th century b.c. the culture center of the Azanian nation\n(Karnak/Thebes) was largely under the political influence of\nthe alliance of external and internal economic forces. This\nthen explains the relocation of that nation's culture institu-\ntions to other parts ofAzania, including Meroe whose demise\nherald the rise of Nhana (ancient Ghana). And as we will\nsoon see, because the founders of Nhana not only inherited\nthe culture institutions of their forebears, but also, lamenta-\nbly, the political intrigue that earlier cemented the disintegra-\ntion of theAzanian nation, it was only a matter of time before\nthey too became victims of similar intrigue.\nIndeed, economically, early Greek, Roman, and Christian\nwriters had extolled the fruits of the Bantu-Ethiopians\nnational culture, as in Homer's Iliad:\nRoyal Thebes\nEgyptian treasure house of countless wealth,\nWho boast her hundred gates through each of which,\nWith horses and two hundred warriors march. (see Homer's\nRegarding the economic autarky of the ancient Ethiopian\nKingdom, Strabo described ancient Egypt as \"from the begin-\nning the most self-sufficient land on the earth\" (Kalopoulos,\nalso reiterated in early biblical scripts \"was watered as\nGardens of the Lord, as the land of Egypt\" (Genesis 13.10;\nBy similar analytical token, it could be stressed without\nerring that, in its over thousand years history, the kingdom of\nNhana boasted similar\neconomic achievements with extensive economic relations\nstretching as far as Portugal, Spain, and probably beyond. In the\nculture front, credible evidence attests that late Egyptian,\nEuropean, and Asian students had erstwhile studied Philosophy,\nLaw, Mathematics, and Medicine in the tertiary institutions/\nSubsequently, the mythological stipulation about the\nwealth and decline of ancient Ghana through the giant black\nserpent (Bida), whose psychological existence depended on\nthe blood of virgin lives (Auset/Isis's life?), not only amounts\nto a total aberration from the ethical norms of the Azanian\nculture, but, above all, also reveals an unbearable state of\nmoral decadence, at least on the part of that kingdom's elites,\nby the time of Nhana's demise. In contrast to the life-serving\npurpose of the Azanian national culture, we are told that the\nsanguinary Bida demanded an annual sacrifice of beautiful\nvirgins in return for guaranteeing the prosperity of ancient\nGhana. The year in which the fianc\u00e9 (Mamadu Sarolle) res-\ncued the intended victim unleashed Bida's wrath in the form\nof a drought that covered the whole kingdom. Consequently,\ngold mining, among others, fell into decline and with it the\ndisintegration of ancient Ghana.22\nApart from the analogy of Bida's mythology with the\nhuman-sacrificing rituals known of the Artemis cult (and/or\nother foreign deities like Allt and Ashirath, etc.), whose fol-\nlowers were to later incrementally infiltrate and usurp the\ninstitutions of the Bantu/Cushitic-Ethiopians national cul-\nture, the fact that the then Islamized Mamadu Sarolle was the\nfianc\u00e9 of Bida's last victim, whose rescue unleashed that ser-\npent's scorching wrath culminating in the demise of Nhana,\nsuggests that by the time of Nhana's disintegration external\npolitical influence had indeed permeated the psychology of\nsome local leaders (and with them the large sections of the\nlocal population as well). Critics could, for example, contrast\nBida's deviant sanguinary reach with the biblical testimony\nthat Abraham refrained from sacrificing his son Isaac after\nhis encounter with the culture symbol of Amon, the ram.\nFurthermore, Maulana Karenga, who has critically\nexplored the traditional emphasis of the Maatian ethnics,\ndraws our attention to the centrality of traditional norms\nthrough the valuable teachings of Merikare:\nEmulate your fore-parents, your ancestors.\nLo, their words endure in books.\nOpen and read them and emulate their knowledge.\nFor one who is taught becomes skilled. (Karenga, 2006, pp.\nHence, the Maatian ethics, which was originally meant to\ninstruct the wise, \"comes to her/him in its pure essence like\nthe condition of the sayings of the ancestors\" (Karenga,\nAs Karenga further observes, the Book of Khunanup,\ncommonly called \"The Story of the Eloquent Peasant,\"\nwhich he described as a text on social justice and moral\n8 SAGE Open\nnarrative, not only urges leaders to live Maat (truth, justice,\nrighteousness) but also reminds them that long life and\nimmortality are based on Maatian conduct. Thus, \"doing\nMaat (justice), so Khunanup (the Peasant), is like a breath to\nthe nose\" (Karenga, 2006, p. 70). Moreover, the rejection of\nisfet (evil) through the Maatian conduct is not only in line\nwith tradition, but is importantly a yearning for the eternal\nqualities of Ra, the authentic source of Maat and light-giver.\nThus, in CT II, 149, the deceased says, \"I shine like Ra daily,\nI establish Maat and expel falsehood.\"\nI am (one) who obeys no magic, who is not scorched by fire nor\nwet by water.\nI will be like Ra every day\nOne who will be fashioned everyday by the\nDespite having derived such fervent nostalgic longing for\ntradition from the First Intermediate and Middle Kingdoms,\nthe literary texts from these periods diverge considerably\nfrom that of the Old Kingdom. Texts dated from this period\nshow evidence of provincial rulers increasing independence\nand years of famine which created huge problems (Karenga,\nrightly observed,\na fundamental characteristic of Maatian discourse in the Old\nKingdom is that there appears to be, at least formally, an implicit\n\"Selsbtverst\u00e4ndlichkeit\" attached to Maat. [Hence,] it was not\nput in question and therefore not thematized. Everyone knew\nwhat Maat was. There arose no communicative need to come to\nan understanding concerning it. (Assmann, 1990, p. 55; Karenga,\nBut with the breakdown of social order from this period,\n\"L'\u00e9vidence naturelle de la Maat, incoprpor\u00e9e dans le roi\ns'est decompose.

MAAT having become problem-\nprisingly, \"Offering Maat to God which earlier is posed as\nsocial practice later emerges as a central ritual as depicted in\nthe iconography of the New Kingdom and Late periods\"\nOstensibly, I have explored in considerable detail (in\nAzanism) the role external and internal political forces played\nin undermining the institutions of the Bantu-Ethiopians phar-\naonic culture, especially during the reign of Amenophis III\nand IV. For our present purpose, let's then assume that\nAkhenaten/Echnaton's radical aberration from traditional\nculture norms (as validated by the sand mounds of al Amarna\nin Arabs-occupied Egypt) was the historic precedent of\nBida's transformation from being originally the symbolic\nrepresentation of the eternal Spirit of the Bantu-Ethiopians\ncommon ancestry into a monstrous political deity, whose\npsychological existence depended on the blood of virgin\nAuset(s). Without such external political interventions the\npseudocultural developments that was to later cement the\ndemise of the institutions of the Azanian culture would have\nbeen unthinkable--not in Manfouir/Menefre (Greeks\nMemphis), Iwnu/ [w]anu (Greeks Heliopolis, Jewish Beth-\nShemesh or the biblical On), Karnak/Thebes, Napata, Meroe,\nor later Kimb\u00e9 Salah/Saleh (the capital of Nhana).\nAs for the demise of Nhana, Arabo-Islamic tradition also\nattests to the fact that Almoravid Muslims from the North\nsucceeded in infiltrating the kingdom incrementally and\neventually invaded it. Initially, the Islamic community at\nKimb\u00e9 Saleh remained a separate community some distance\naway from the king's palace. It even had its own mosques\nand schools, while the king retained his traditional beliefs. In\nthe kingdom's closing days, however, traditional kings had\nto rely on Muslim scholars to run the administration of the\nterritory. With Takrur to the west already transformed into an\nIslamic community, which then evolved ever closer trading\nties with the Arabs-occupied part of colonial Africa, it was\nonly a matter of time before Kimb\u00e9 Saleh, whose local lan-\nguages in some parts of the city were already deemed sacri-\nlege for Islamic practices, would succumb to the same\npolitical pressures that earlier cemented the demise of the\nAzanian nation.\nWith the demise of Nhana in the 13th century a.d.,24 it\nwas only ineluctable that such weak unviable tribal entities\nas theAshanti-, Mali-, Mossi-, Shongai- and the Oyo empires,\nand/or, tragically, the Hausas's city-states became the univer-\nsally approved political norm in the entire region. As we are\nby now aware, these have since been replaced by the postco-\nlonial African states, which lamentably also owe their origin\nto the Westphalian heritage. At this analytical juncture, genu-\nine nationalist/revivalist intellectuals are simply reminded\nthat the relative ease with which Ivory Coast, Libya, and\nMali recently succumbed to the prevailing colonial yoke\nsuggests that maintaining the African states amounts to noth-\ning less than an ethnocide.\nEthnic and Culture Reintegration as Nationalist\nRejection of the Colonial Heritage\nIf indeed the enfeebled Hausas's city-states, which in the\n18th century fell so miserably to Osman Dan Fodio's Arabo-\nIslamist forces (not to mention the fact that both Mali and\nNigeria, in short the AU, are presently heavily reliant on\ntheir former European colonial masters in their fight against\nthe resurgent Arabo-Islamic colonialism), are the future\npolitical ideal pan-African intellectuals and leaders would\nenvisage for Africa's pseudoethnic (tribal) entities, they\nshould be reminded that--in genuine national context--the\nHausas, like other subculture groups of Nhana, attest to\nsharing the same ancestral lineage with the rest of the Bantu/\nCushitic-Ethiopians. In fact, Dan Masanin--a Hausa histo-\nrian, Maitama Sule, who is also a leading figure in the Kano\nEmirate, not only believes in an authentic ethnic connection\nspanning the whole of the indigenous inhabitants of Azania\nbut also argues credibly that the Hausas are ethno-culturally\nlinked to the rest of the Cushitic-Ethiopians. He even goes\nfurther to cite linguistic similarities as well as the fact that\nthese subculture groups shared the worship of the Sun-god\nprior to the introduction of Christianity and Islam in colo-\nnial Africa. If anything, most informed Hausas not only\nbelieve to be the original inhabitants of the Nubian\n(Saharan?) Desert region but are also convinced that some\nof their leaders are descendants of the indigenous Pharaohs.\nEven today, the palace of Daura contains a sword which\nsome Hausas believe came from the pharaohs.25\nFurthermore, in the mythological stipulation about the\norigin of the Hausas, we also learn about the \"Hausa Bakwai\"\n(seven Hausas), Kano, Zazzau (Zaria), Gobir, Katsina, Rano,\nDaura, and Biram, and the \"Banza Bakwai\" (Zamfara,\nKebbik, Nupe, Gwari, Yauri, Yoruba, and Kororofa). This\nother seven Hausas are considered to be the descendants of\nan extramarital affair between the Hausas's male ancestor\nBawa and a concubine. The significance of this latter narra-\ntive is not only the inclusion of Yoruba among the common\nlineage of the Hausas but also the fact that it contains a fan-\ntastic twist that purports a genealogical link between the\nHausas and the Arabs. And as we shall see, this latter legend-\nary narrative merely reveals the creative genius of later\nIslamized Hausa scholars, who might have desperately tried\nto reconcile local myths with incoming Arabo-Islamic influ-\nences. Thus, just as early Arabic and Islamic scholars estab-\nlished a spurious ancestral link with the biblical Abraham\nand his Cushitic-Ethiopian (Egyptian?) wife, so too did polit-\nical-expedient Hausas, whose legitimacy as leaders was by\nnow not based on their elevated knowledge of the local cul-\nture but instead dependent on their genealogical link to the\nfounder (prophet) of Islam, see the need to reinvent their\nancestral history in line with the Arabo-Islamic leadership\nmodel. In any event, Islamized Hausas and Fulanis are not\nidiosyncratic in making such spurious claims. It is an estab-\nlished norm in colonial Africa that most local leaders subser-\nvient to Arabo-Islamic political influence are one way or the\nother genealogical linked to Prophet Mohammed. Thus,\nwhen I left Luanda ([A]Ngola, South West Azania,) in the\nearly 1990s, Islam was virtually nonexistent. It was recently\nintroduced into that part of Azania by local converts from the\nGreat Lakes region and/or West and North Azania. But that\nshould not preclude the possibility that there might already\nbe some politically conscious converts who conceive the\nneed to establish such a genealogical lineage. One must not\nforget that the legitimacy and future of Morocco's (heredi-\ntary) Monarchy hinges on similar spurious assumptions.\nIf anything, this critical review of the mythology of Bida\nand that of the Hausas's origin suffice to validate the forego-\ning arguments. In the myth of the Hausas origin, we are told\nthat the son of Bagdad king (Bayajidda or Abuyazidu) had a\nquarrel with his father, and, consequently, left Bagdad only\nto find himself in Daura (one of the seven city-states of the\nHausas, north of Kano). While in Daura, Bayajidda (out-\nsider) found out that the local inhabitants were being terror-\nized and deprived of drinking water by a giant serpent, which\ntook over the well of the local community. As gratitude for\nBayajidda's brave act in killing that giant serpent, the king of\nDaura gave him his daughter to marry. Their first son Bawa\n(servant) went forth to give birth to the Hausa\u00adBakwai\n(founders of the seven city-states of the Hausas).26\nPutting aside the question why the entire population of\nDaura would in those days have depended on a single well\nfor its source of drinking water, critics are reminded that the\ntime Osman Dan Fodio's Arabo-Islamic forces captured the\ncity-states of the Hausas Bagdad (Iraq) was among the most\nimportant centers of Islamic scholarship. Moreover, with the\ninclusion of the \"Hausa Bakwai\" and \"Banza Bakwai\" in this\nlegend, one could reasonably perceive a rational incorpora-\ntion of incoming Arabo-Islamic patriarchal influences in the\nmyth of Hausas's origin. Thus, just as Sarah--Abraham's\nfirst and legitimate wife--begot Isaac (the male ancestor of\nthe Hebrews), and his illegitimate Nuba\u00adEgyptian wife,\nHagar, begot Ismael (the presumed male ancestor of the\nArabs), so too had the Hausas's male ancestors both legiti-\nmate and illegitimate sons. Bayajidda's killing of the giant\nblack serpent (the primordial embodiment of the eternal\nspirit of the Bantu-Ethiopians ancestry) tends to add even\nmore to that romanticized legend in that it not only incorpo-\nrates elements of the mythology of Bida but also implicitly\ninvokes the wholly politicized biblical narration depicting\nAbraham's sacrificial killing of the culture symbol of Amon\n(ram) in the place of his son Isaac--during the occupation of\nLower Egypt by the Hyksos. In viewing this, are we not deal-\ning here with a systematic external political attempt to extir-\npate the culture/mythical symbols of the Bantu-Ethiopians\nnational culture?\nIn contrast, I observed in Azanism that the blood that cir-\nculates the veins of the culture symbols of the Bantu-\nEthiopians Kingdom (e.g., the Ram or the Apis Bull of\nManfouir/Menefre) is dependent entirely on the vegetation\n(remedy) ofAusar/Osiris resurrection. Moreover, thatAnubis\nand the Subk/Sebek deity, the predynastic crocodile deity of\nthe Moabas (Moabites of pre-Israelite Canaan?) or later the\nculture symbol of the capital of the present day Mali\n(Bamaka-ko [Crocodile of water]), were also included\namong the Judges of the Dead during the dynastic Pharaonic\nperiod begs the conclusion that the custodians of the Azanian\nculture had erstwhile succeeded in acculturating these latter\ncannibalistic animals in accord with the life-serving purpose\nof genuine culture(s). In the case of Anubis, after it had lost a\nsurvival (intellectual) contest against the Rabbit.27 With this\nanalytical discernment, revivalist intellectuals would simply\nlike to remind the pan-Africanist (and other pseudonational-\nist) intellectuals that we share the genuine\nnationalists position that the Bantu-Ethiopians are ethnically\nand culturally akin, and that the prevailing (divisive) colonial\nmodel influencing the psychology of the subjects of colonial\nAfrica is not a realistic substitute for genuine identity forma-\ntion process. To strengthen this position, let's expound on the\nhistory of the Dagbon (also known as the Dagbon-Mol\u00e9) of\nmodern Nhana (Ghana?), as this adds more to the ongoing\nanalytical discernment in support of an ethno-culture national\nidentity for the Azanians.\nIn the mythology of the origin of the Dagbon-Mol\u00e9 one is\ntold that their male ancestor, Tohadzie--the red hunter--\ndescended from Zamfara (one of the \"Banza Bakwai\" of the\nHausas). The young Tohadzie, who, like his grandfather\nBayajidda, was doubtlessly driven by sociopolitical ambi-\ntions, left Zamfara only to find himself in a town of the then\nnascent Mali Empire. It would seem Tohadzie arrived in\nMali shortly after the disintegration of the kingdom of\nNhana. For, unlike Bayajidda, who earlier rescued the\nindigenous inhabitants of Daura from the terror of a giant\nblack serpent which took control of the locals'only source of\ndrinking water, the brave Tohadzie had to grapple this time\nwith a black buffalo (the \"Apis Bull\" of Manfouir?), which\nastonishingly not only took control of that Malian commu-\nnity's only source of drinking water but also killed anyone\nwho dared to fetch water from that town's river.After leading\nthe drought-stricken community to slain their bestial enemy,\nTohadzie was also not only offered a Malian princess (called\nPagawugba) for marriage but he also eventually inherited the\nthrone of that local community. If anything, the newly wed-\nded royal couple eventually gave birth to a son (Kpognambo),\nwho, in line with the hereditary norm of the incoming patri-\narchal model, was also imbued with Tohadzie gallantry and\nhunting qualities.\nInasmuch as the killing of the eternal spirit of the Bantu-\nEthiopian ancestors by Bayajidda or the killing of the sacred\nApis Bull of Manfouir by his grandson Tohadzie is con-\ncerned, it could reasonably be argued that the \"Green\nCrown,\" which originally had served as the legitimate geron-\ntocratic title of the Pharaonic system had (after the demise of\nKarnak) lost its culture significance, and the political events\nthat unfolded since then right through to the current political\ncrisis engulfing the whole ECOWAS region amounts to what\none could readily qualify as genuine political sorcery.\nSuccinctly, after the death of Kpognambo's parents, he\ntraveled westwards from the then Malian Empire to Buin (in\nFadan Grumah),28 where after defeating the Tendana, he\nusurped the kingdom's throne and ruled it until his death.\nIn Buin, Kpognambo married two wives, Sihisabiga\n(daughter of Buin spiritual leader) and Suhuyini (the daugh-\nter of the king of Fadan Grumah). Suhuyini gave birth to\nGbewaa29 and Sihisabiga gave birth to Malgimsi, Nyelgili,\nand Mamzisheli.\nAfter Kpognambo's death, and with replacement of the\ngerontocratic constitution of the Azanian culture with the\nincoming economically inspired patriarchal model, and with\nfour sons of an early political marriage vying for the throne\nof Buin, it was only a matter of time before internal dissen-\nsion fractured that kingdom. The ensuing conflicts forced\nGbewaa and his followers to emigrate to Pusiga, the Upper\nEastern region of modern Nhana (Ghana). Here, Naa\nGbewaa and his followers established the kingdom of greater\nDagbon, which he ruled until his death. Kpognambo's other\nsons, Nyelgili founded the chieftainship of Nangodi and\nNamzisheli founded Tongo.\nFollowing the death of Naa Gbewaa, similar succession\nwars ensued among his sons and grandsons. Such divisive\nconflicts reached their peak when Zirli murdered his brother\nKufogu to inherit Biun's throne--and this much to the dis-\nagreement of his other siblings. With that act, the final stage\nwas set for further conflicts leading to the eventual breakup\nof the Dagbon Kingdom into the modern Dagbon kingdoms\n(with their lion rulers; Staniland, 1975).\nIt was in the midst of such perdurable political crisis that\nother Naa Gbewaa's sons, Sitobu, Tohagu, and Mantambo\nmigrated further southwards from Pusiga and found the\nManprusi Kingdom (Tohagu), the Nanun Kingdom\n(Mantambo), and Sitobu, the modern Dagbon Kingdom.\nHence, the Nanun, Mamprugu, and Dagbon people consider\neach other as brothers. In addition, a daughter of Naa\nGbewaa, Yentuagri, married a Patan Grumah and they found\nthe Mossi Kingdom. The narrative even goes on to add the\nKusasis and other groups of modern Ghana, To[n]go, and\nBurkina Faso among descendants of the Dagbon.30 That the\nPatan-Grumahs are today found in Mali, Niger, Guinea,\nChad, Sudan, and parts of Southern Libya, and so on suffices\nto remind critics of the complexity involved in terms of iden-\ntity formation process in Azania as a whole.\nImportant about this concise history of the Dagbon-Mol\u00e9\nis the interrelated ethnic role the Hausas and Patan-Grumahs\n(the Moabas) have played in the emergence of the other sub-\nculture groups (tribes?) of that region. Subsequently, in\nAzanism, I referred to the Bantu-Ethiopian subculture group\ncalled \"Luok Niib\" (inhabitants of the underworld) whose\nseven male ancestors shared the same ancestral lineage and\nwho until today not only maintain the Subk/Sebek deity of\nthe predynastic period but also continue to worship Hyen-Nu\n(Heru/Horus?).31 Furthermore, while the kingship titles of\nthe other subculture groups of Nhana are Nam, Naan, Naba\n(also linked to Meroe), Nana, and so on, \"B\u00e9t\" (messenger),\nwhich I paralleled with \"Bes-Ptah\" inAzanism, is the authen-\ntic kingship title of Moabas. It is even culturally significant\nthat \"Nab\" in Moar/Mol\u00e9 means cow; and indigenous\nPharaohs during the dynastic era were known to be referred\nto as \"bulls, either of the sky or earth\" (Christopher, 2002).\nTherefore, the custodians of the Azanian national culture,\nwho until this day consider the total liberation of the Nile\nValley region as concomitant to the reintroduction of the\n\"Ritual of Resurrection,\" which, as noted elsewhere, is irre-\nducibly bound with that peoples' culture quest for real free-\ndom (as life in its eternal manifestation), will lament African\nleaders' and pan-African intellectuals' subscription to the\ncolonial African ideal as a total aberration from the genuine\nnational cause.\nIn fact, culturally speaking, apart from the promise of\nparadise after the violent death of the profane in her or his\nmyrmidon service to the state system, leaders of the world's\ndominant political religions, which continue to influence the\npsychology of the subjects of colonial Africa, are far from\nconvincing genuine nationalists with their economic response\nto the imminent culture challenge humanity faces, namely,\nthe perpetual growth of native populations. However, in con-\ntrast to the murderous reach of these political sorcerers (as in\nthe human-sacrificing rituals remarked elsewhere of foreign\npolitical deities, which in contemporary context is merely\ntransmogrified into the incessant rivalries of the expansive\nstates), the custodians of theAzanian national culture were--\nfrom the onset of their nation's social history--not only pre-\nscient of that imminent culture challenge but even anticipated\nthat through the appropriate culture measures humanity is\nintellectually capable of attaining real freedom. Accordingly,\nthe well-known \"Ritual of Resurrection\" in the \"Book of\nComing Forth by Day\" and the closely related culture pro-\ncess of the \"Mummification of the deceased indigenous\nPharaohs\" should be seen as supplementary to the underly-\ning objective of theAzanian culture--that is eternity first and\nthen resurrection.\nTo transpose the afflatus of the Azanian culture radically,\nthe custodians of the culture institutions of the Bantu/\nCushitic-Ethiopians Pharaonic system are unanimous in their\nconvictionaboutthehomogeneity oflocal/nationalculture(s).\nNevertheless, they also tend to maintain that in each earthly\nnation's culture quest for a superior (immortal) identity, lead-\ners of the various earthly nations would ineluctably arrive at\nan epistemological junction (in the form of an Ankh), where\nthey would be summoned by the conscience of Universal\nExistence to present their distinctive culture documents (e.g.,\nthe Maat) as testaments to each nation's nonpareil service to\nLife. But, in light of the foregoing analysis, the panache of\nthe Bantu-Ethiopians culture school is simply that such a\nconscious voluntary integration of the earthly nations culture\ndocuments (is this the Universal Constitution of Nations?) at\nthe advent of a perfect humanity, which is capable of transit-\ning the terrestrial and celestial provinces must not be con-\nfused with the democratic constitutions of existing Polities\n(which are mainly composed of economic adventurers/spec-\nulators, political sorcerers, mother murderers, homosexuals,\npedophiles, etc.)--because the objective of the overarching\nConstitution is the service of Life in her eternal manifesta-\ntion. In other words, the perception that pristine culture must\nbe subservient to Life's purpose unequivocally contradicts\nthe prevailing multicultural casuistry at the base of the demo-\ncratic constitution of the nation-state system, which, as\nobserved elsewhere, is--even if somehow panurgic and for-\ntuitous--fully embraced by both AU leaders and PAMs\nintellectuals.\nConclusion\nApodictically, this essaic-article took critical issue with the\nmainstream views espoused mainly by agents of colonialism,\nleaders and intellectuals of the PAMs and those of Africa's\ntribal irredentism, that there is anything ethno-cultural (and\nhence national) about the so-called African tribes. Drawing\nlargely from the social history of precolonial/prepolitical\nAfrica, that is, the Bantu/Cushitic-Ethiopians kingdom\n(Azanian nation), I demonstrated lucidly and vividly that far\nfrom being distinct ethno-culture nationalities as is often\nportrayed in the mainstream scholarship, the African tribes\nare better considered subculture groups, whose providential\nand provincial culture norms and practices erstwhile paid\ntribute to the objective of the Azanian culture. For instance,\nusing the culture symbols and practices of some local groups\nand linking them to that of predynastic and dynastic\nPharaonic periods, I observed that there is compelling evi-\ndence against qualifying the so-called African tribes as dis-\ntinct ethno-culture national communities. In genuine culture\ncontext, the old age Ritual of Resurrection and the interre-\nlated culture process of the mummification of a deceased\nindigenous Pharaohs attest that the moral objective of that\nnation's culture is irreducibly subservient to Life's purpose\nas exemplified by the immortality of Hyen-Nu (Heru/\nHorus?). Furthermore, there are recurrent culturally sanc-\ntioned ethical instances among the elderly of these subcul-\nture groups (e.g., the moral constraint from eating the flesh\nof any of the culture symbols assigned to their nation's cul-\nture institutions such as the Subk/Sebek deity, the Apis Bull,\nthe ram symbol of Amon, etc.), which genuinely pay tribute\nto the overarching culture norm. Moreover, the fact that at its\napogee, the process of the Ritual of Resurrection began in the\nDelta region of the Nile Valley and ended at the Sources of\nthe White Nile, where the spirit of the deceased indigenous\nPharaohs was introduced into the pneumatic habitation of\ntheir ancestors, contradicts conventional wisdom that ancient\nEgypt (during the reign of the indigenous Pharaohs) was a\ndistinct national community isolated from the rest of Azania.\nTherefore, the emphatic approval of the pending Arab colo-\nnial occupation of the sacred land of the Bantu/Cushitic-\nEthiopians Kingdom-Azania and/or the approval of the\nemergence of pseudoethnic identities on Africa's political\nplain by the AU leadership and PAMs intellectuals indicate\nhow really disingenuous these are on the question of national\nemancipation and unity.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1. Diop (1974), who discussed the culture significance of the\nancient Ethiopian Pan-deity Min in his African Origin of\nCivilization: Myth or Reality, also stressed that only the indig-\nenous Ethiopians were permitted to worship that national\ndeity. In Azanism, I derived the concept of \"Min/Min\u00e9\" (me)\nfrom Moar/Mol\u00e9 in that the Moaba(s) are the only subculture\ngroup of the Azanian nation which until today worship the\nancient Bantu-Ethiopians (and later ancient Egyptians) Sun-\nGod Hyen-Nu (One Hand).

The belief in the infinite\nphenomenal respiratory organism such as Life is derived\nmythologically from the love between Geb and Hyen-Nu.\nThe difficulty involved in that laborious and numinous task\nmeant to demonstrate Hyen-Nu's nonpareil love to earthly\nlife is illustrated by the description of rain as the sweat from\nthe pores of Hyen-Nu and Earth/Geb. N[y]un is the primor-\ndial water which nourishes the rivers and oceans earthy life\ndepends on. It is also the interaction between Hyen-Nu (in\nthe form of Sun rays/Ani) and Geb that the crude air (vapor?)\nwhich earthly life breath is generated and purified by the veg-\netation/remedy of Ausar's resurrection.\n 3.

In discussing the indigenous Pharaonic model of leadership\nand linking it to the presentation of Maat at the advent of a\nKing/Queen legitimate ascension to the Pharaonic throne,\nI gave priority to the authentic gerontocratic monarchy as\nopposed to hereditary monarchy, which was undoubtedly\nintroduced in Azania by colonial agents.\n11. On Karl Marx's defends of British colonial policies in India,\n12. Having researched extensively in Ngola (Angola) during the\nwar years, I have firsthand knowledge of the exact role inter-\nnationalists forces played in the liberation struggle in colonial\nAfrica. This notwithstanding, that the economic and political\nobjectives of Scientific Socialism are in most cases contrary\nto the indigenous Azanians culture quest for real freedom has\nbeen simply overlooked by most African leaders and PAMs\ndetails).\nthe culture center of Sumer (Uruk), which at the onset was\npresided by Anu and his daughter Auset (Ishtar/Isis), to the\nAzanian culture center in Karnak, but also explores the politi-\ncal intrigue surrounding the demise of that culture center's\nsecurity--the conservationist Enkidu (discussed in the Epics\nof Gilgamesh) in light of similar political marriages in the\ncourts of Amenophis III and IV, which doubtlessly facilitated\nthe infiltration and destruction of the culture institutions of the\nBantu-Ethiopians Pharaonic system.\n14. Nhana in Moar/Mol\u00e9, the language of the Moabas (simply\nno credible academic justification to discriminate between\nHyen-Nu, Amon, Aton, and/or A-Nu (Anu), as all refers to\nthe same Sun-God in Moar/Mol\u00e9. Amon (A = you [are])+Mon\n(red) is merely referring to the reddish radiance of the rising or\ndescending Sun; whileAton (A+ton [hot]) is made in reference\nto the glowing radiance of the same Sun-God.\n16. Luok, in essence, simply means an existential state of either\ndwelling in a deep pit or a cave, and Nu-rua, the singular of\n(Niib), means the creature of Hyen-Nu. The general idea of\ninhabiting a cave made in reference to this Bantu-Ethiopian\ngroup makes sense given the celestial orientation of the\nAzanian culture. In addition, a parallel could be drawn between\nthat existential state and that of Bes-Ptah as the first anthropo-\nmorphized deity of the Azanian culture, who (together with his\nseven assistants) created the first earthly order in pursuit of the\noriginal/perfect world order attributed to Hyen-Nu.\n17. For the cannibalistic tendencies associated with the politi-\nrejection of Azanian culture of such sanguinary practices see\n18. A thorough study would also prove that committed elderly of\nthe Bantu-Ethiopian subculture groups (e.g., the Ashantis, the\nBamuns [Ba-Amun], Bawul\u00e9s, Ba-Congos, Zulus, etc.) are\nuntil today morally constrained from eating the flesh of any\none of the symbolic animalistic deities of the Azanian culture.\n19. Unlike Am\u00e9lineau Abb\u00e9 Emile and Diop who tend to consider\nAnu/Ani as an ethnic group and the original builders of the\nancient Ethiopian (Egyptian?) city of Aiwn (On), I observed\nin Azanism that there is no genuine academic justification\nto discriminate between A+Nu (Anu) and Hyen-Nu. In fact,\nthere are different hieroglyphic symbols denoting Heru/\nHorus (e.g., One Eye, Falcon, One Finger, One Hand, etc.).\nAccordingly, A (You/r) + Nu (Hand) merely refers to the origi-\nnal Self-created-creating-Hand.\n20. The trend of human population suggests that the custodians\nof the Azanian culture were indeed right in equating earthly\nbeings with the stellar bodies. Thus, the infinite expansion\nof the stars means the human population has the natural pro-\npensity of attaining the 100 billion mark on Earth which thus\nimpels the culture quest for perfect being.\n21.
