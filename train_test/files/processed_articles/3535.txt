Daoud consequently located a series of sexual assaults\nwithin an expansive sexual ecology encompassing cultural, ethnic, national and\nreligious groups, which he took to include Arabs, North Africans, refugees and,\nabove all, Muslims. The sexual assaults examined in Daoud's article had taken\nplace in the German cities of Cologne, Hamburg and Stuttgart a month earlier.\nThis article published in the New York Times, like many other reports and features\ndisseminated across a number of different media platforms including newspapers\nand websites, communicated a seemingly coherent picture which appeared to\nexplain the assaults with ease. It portrayed Muslim men as tyrannical, Muslim\nwomen as downtrodden or exploited, and the wider world of Islam as culpable (see\nalso Morey and Yaqin, 2011). Daoud linked the actions of a small number of\nindividuals to wider cultural and religious groups, beginning with the million or\nso refugees who had recently been granted asylum in Germany and extending to\nthe wider Arab world, North African and Middle Eastern peoples and cultures, as\nwell as to the Islamic world more broadly.\nThe counterpoint to the `miserable' Muslims identified in the New York Times\narticle was, of course, an equally stereotypical West. Daoud implicitly character-\nised the West as a culture and a people upholding values pertaining to gender\nequality and sexual harmony. In the context of powerful Orientalist myths\nabout the Arab and Muslim world as a hotbed of repressed sexuality \u00ad which\nDaoud admittedly acknowledged \u00ad it was damaging that his article also employed\nthe diction of contagion. It described the intersecting groups of Muslims and\nArabs as sexually dangerous, their `sick relationship with women' threatening\nthe `healthy' European body politic.1 According to Daoud, a disease \u00ad implied\nas sexual in nature \u00ad is `spreading to [Western] lands'. This `pathology' is also\nbroadening from a mental to a physical register, where its expressions range from\nhymen reconstruction surgery to the actions of suicide bombers (2016b: n.p.). It\nshould not escape the reader's notice that, both according to Daoud and amongst\nsome of the Islamic religious authorities he decries, an emphasis on what is deemed\n`healthy' and wholesome and what is labelled as `sick' forms an ideological sub-\nstratum for controlling what women do with their bodies and with whom. Small\nwonder that feminists and queer theorists such as Sara Ahmed and Ann\nCvetkovich have called for the `depathologization' (Cvetkovich, 2012: 5) of nega-\ntive affects such as misery. These scholars have drawn attention to various man-\nifestations of unhappiness as racialised categories associated with `melancholy\n(neo-)colonialism, such emotions are `not so much a medical or biochemical dys-\nfunction as a very rational response to global conditions' (Cvetkovich, 2012: 5).\nAccordingly, these theorists call for a recalibration of widespread, and potentially\ndamaging, assumptions that happiness is automatically equated with the reductive\nconcept of `good' and misery is diametrically opposed as `bad'.\nReturning to Daoud, his argumentational thrust is remarkably familiar. Indeed,\nthis latest iteration of counterproductive stereotypes and sometimes wilful confu-\nsions can be traced back through European colonial histories. However, this mor-\nalistic discourse of difference has shifted and expanded over time, mapping onto\ncontemporary developments and events. Kamel Daoud's New York Times article\nreworked an original piece \u00ad `Cologne, lieu de fantasmes' (2016a) \u00ad which the\nFrench newspaper Le Monde printed on 31 January 2016. These two articles\nwere simply the latest instalments from a subgenre of journalism in which current\nevents with broadly sexual content were, and indeed are, reported on and inter-\nimaginative geography. A jumbled picture of Arab and Islamic worlds is sketched\non this backdrop, centring on North Africa and the Middle East and spilling over\ninto any place where Arab and/or Muslim men come into contact with others.\nSuch an imaginative geography exists primarily in the European mind, but it is\nmapped onto real people and places, forming the lens through which events are\ninterpreted. This is a metaphorical place of misery, where tyrannical men objectify\nand exploit women and girls, both within and outside their own communities.\nTo understand this emphasis upon misery, it helps to focus more closely on Sara\nAhmed, whose monograph The Promise of Happiness exposes an emotional apart-\nheid in which unhappiness (or, in our case, misery) is kept quarantined as far away\nfrom happiness as possible:\n[T]he very idea of contagion can be evoked in the self-regulation of feeling worlds.\nYou might refuse proximity to somebody out of fear that you will be infected by\nunhappiness, or you might seek proximity to somebody out of hope that you will be\ninfected by happiness. An affective geography of happiness takes shape. Unhappiness\nis pushed to the margins, which means certain bodies are pushed to the margins, in\nChambers et al. 3\norder that the unhappiness that is assumed to reside within these bodies does not\nAhmed communicates that the much-vaunted affect of happiness, which is usually\nassumed to be within every individual's grasp, is intimately connected to privilege.\nthat `[f]eelings can get stuck to certain bodies' (2010a: 69). Thus, happiness and\nmisery map onto `good' and `bad' Muslims respectively, and in turn, as we will\nargue, `good' and `bad' Muslims map onto Islamophilia and Islamophobia.\nAt stake in Daoud's article, as in several other media reports and commentaries\non the sexual assaults in Germany, is the creation of a composite category of the\nsexually rapacious refugee, Arab and/or Muslim man. As previously mentioned,\nthe actions of relatively few individuals are axiomatically identified with this\nincreasingly capacious and allegedly predatory group. Each of the subcategories\nmatters, but one stands out as the usual suspect in this burgeoning genre of current\naffairs reporting: the Muslim man. In response to the New York Times article, a\ngroup of academics, including David Theo Goldberg, Ghassan Hage and Laleh\nKhalili, published an open letter also in Le Monde on 11 February protesting\nDaoud's `psychologization' of `more than a billion individuals' from Muslim back-\nMuslim studies tend to be dominated by social science disciplines, including\nsociology, human geography, religious studies and criminology. Breaking new\nground, the AHRC-funded Storying Relationships research project from which\nthis article stems focuses on the concomitant importance of arts and humanities\nscholarship in the field of Muslim studies. By bridging the social sciences and\nliterary or cultural studies approaches and aiming to transcend the pernicious\ndichotomies of good Muslim and bad Muslim or Islamophilia and\nIslamophobia, our research seeks to find a middle ground between polarised posi-\ntions. This is especially salient in light of the recent rise of extremism \u00ad Islamist,\nHindutva and white supremacist. In Tariq Ali's, 2002 book, The Clash of\nFundamentalisms, he positions American imperialism as the most dangerous `fun-\ndamentalism' of our contemporary moment. More recently, in Age of Anger\n(2017), Pankaj Mishra reveals that ISIS, white supremacy and Hindu fundamen-\ntalism have a surprising amount in common. Like Ali, Mishra categorises blind\nin mind both the rise of violent extremism accreting to Islam and the resurgence of\nthe far right, we seek to unsettle hostility towards, as well as uncritical praise of,\nMuslims through detailed analysis of literary texts. The contrasting pictures of the\n`sexual misery' of Muslims on the one hand and `happy British Muslims' on the\nother are unpicked in this article, which takes creative non-fiction and novels as\nmore illuminating points of reference than media representations. While this article\nbegins with an in-depth discussion of descriptions of Muslim men, the article then\nmoves on to examine the portrayal of Muslim women and to a particularly female-\nassociated literary genre \u00ad namely, chick lit. Finally, we consider the stories about\nMuslim sexualities that are not yet in circulation. We ask how these stories could\nbe produced, circulated and consumed, and, whether through their telling and\nsharing, sexual relationships could be reimagined.\nMainstream depictions of Muslim sexualities\nBefore examining the work of a number of Muslim-identified writers who relate\nstories about relationships and sexualities within their communities \u00ad thereby\nbringing hitherto unheard stories and experiences to wider audiences \u00ad it is neces-\nsary to develop a clearer picture of what they are writing against, whether explicitly\nor implicitly. As outlined above, journalists have adumbrated an expansive sexual\necology of Islamic sexualities through reference to stereotypes and caricatures.\nThis article is concerned with the form that these stereotypes currently take in\nthe UK, as well as with Muslim writers' responses to such vignettes. Close reading\nallows us to differentiate a series of themes that go beyond the inflammatory\nheadlines equating sexual misery with Muslim men. We argue that literature by\nMuslim-identified writers fleshes out conventional mediations of this `misery'.\nFirst, it is essential to highlight some of the specific ways in which Muslim\nsexualities have been portrayed in mainstream discourse in the context of\nBritain. An important and indicative example of this mainstream discourse, in\nthe form of media and political commentary, is provided through consideration\nof Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) and Child Sexual Abuse (CSA). CSE/A has\nbeen widespread throughout the UK, but has been especially and alarmingly\nprominent in a number of post-industrial, socially and economically deprived\nparts of the Midlands, Lancashire, Yorkshire and more recently Tyne and\nWear. Geographically, there is an overlap between areas affected by CSE/A and\nthose with substantial populations of Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME)\ngroups,2 notably those with Pakistani Muslim heritage.\nDominating prevailing discussions of CSE/A is a narrative in which commen-\ntators claim to have discovered and transgressed a purposeful and cowardly silence\nmaintained by liberals and those belonging to associated professional classes in\ntheir refusal to blame Pakistani, Muslim or Asian men and their wider communi-\nties for acts of sexual exploitation and abuse. Breaking this taboo \u00ad acknowledging\nwhat the (London) Times reporter Andrew Norfolk (2012a) has called the `ele-\nphant in the room' \u00ad these commentators go to some lengths to explain precisely\nhow and why the men in these targeted minority groups are culpable. Today, their\ninterventions have become sufficiently commonplace that any claims about ele-\nphants in rooms are no longer tenable. Indeed, these claims have reached beyond\ntheir most obvious home \u00ad right-wing and populist British print newspapers such\nas the Times and Daily Mail \u00ad to permeate more liberal-identified voices, including\nthat of the former New Labour Home Secretary and Blackburn MP Jack Straw.\nThis observation resonates with Joseph Massad's argument that Islamophobia and\nliberalism are not mutually exclusive; on the contrary, he argues, they are mutually\nChambers et al. 5\nconstitutive (Massad, 2015; see also Phillips, 2016). Commenting on the conviction\nWe need to get the Pakistani community to think much more clearly about why this is\ngoing on [. . .] These young men are in a western society; they act like any other young\nmen, they're fizzing and popping with testosterone, they want some outlet for that,\nbut Pakistani heritage girls are off-limits and they are expected to marry a Pakistani\nStraw's confidently confrontational tone has been echoed and apparently vindi-\ncated more recently by those in the professional classes and others in positions of\npower and authority. This is evidenced in Alexis Jay's (2014) report, which inves-\ntigated the circumstances surrounding the sexual abuse of at least 1400 children in\nwhich examined the alleged failures of social integration in the UK. These discus-\nsions, which have clearly become orthodox wisdom and therefore no longer taboo,\ndemand a closer look.\nThe dominant, and arguably hegemonic, discourse on Muslim sexualities is\ninconsistent in its use of ethnic, racial and religious categories and terms, but its\nprimary concern ultimately lies with Muslims. In an op-ed on the Rotherham child\nabuse, Norfolk accused `Muslim men, mostly of Pakistani origin' of being the\nperpetrators (Norfolk, 2012a: 11); this demonstrates a widespread tendency to\nslip between these and related terms, effectively using them as synonyms. In anoth-\ner article, entitled `Role of Asian Gangs is Played Down by Report on Thousands\nof Child Victims', Norfolk quotes Michael Gove, the Conservative Member of\nParliament, and now Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural\nAffairs and jingoistic Brexiteer, as complaining about the establishment's silence\non `Asian abusers' (Norfolk, 2012b: 12). The media's far too regular (and unex-\namined) slippage between categories, including Muslim, Pakistani and Asian, ref-\nugee and immigrant, is open to interpretation. It may be argued that journalists, in\nseeking to vary their language, are merely reaching for synonyms. Equally, it may\nbe that their muddled reportage betrays ignorance. Whatever the case, categories\nare conflated, particular terms are used as surrogates for others, and out of this\nconfusing picture the category of the Muslim floats to the surface. In the context of\npost-7/7 British media reportage on Muslims, Maria Sobolewska and Sundas Ali\nargue that the coverage `follow[s] a pre-existing media narrative' (2015: 677), which\nmay, in turn, be located within a much larger discursive system \u00ad namely, that of\nsexualised Orientalism (Phillips, 2016).\nSexualised Orientalism, though a historically coherent and repetitive narrative,\nis also marked by local variations and apparent contradictions. Sexualised\nOrientalist figures \u00ad of which Muslim men are prime examples \u00ad are in some\ncases depicted as sensuous and hypersexualised, in others as sexually repressed,\nand in certain cases as embodying both of these contradictory tendencies at once\n(Phillips, 2016). Straw's description of British Muslim men, for example, refers to\nyoung men `fizzing and popping with testosterone'. Yet it simultaneously alludes to\na culture that denies these men a healthy sexual `outlet', allegedly driving them to\ntake action in extreme ways, such as through the sexual exploitation of children. In\nhis assertions about the closed sexual ecologies of British Pakistani Muslims, Straw\nalso dismissed the women in those communities, constructing them as sexually\nunavailable, repressed figures, devoid of sexual desire and experience.\nAlthough this damaging and incorrect image of Muslim sexualities is becoming\nincreasingly common and widespread, the media and various individuals respon-\nsible for creating and sustaining this story have not been entirely successful in\neradicating other perspectives. The simplistic picture of Muslim sexual aggressors\nand white victims has been undercut, for example, by Manveen Rana's report for\nthe BBC's File on 4 radio documentary series (2014: n.p.). In this programme\nRana exposed the fact that Asian women were victims in Rotherham too, but\nthat their voices have been silenced. Similarly, the Guardian ran an article by\nDeputy Children's Commissioner Sue Berelowitz, who unequivocally stated that\nCSE/A is `not a problem within one particular faith or ethnic group' (Berelowitz,\n2012b: n.p.). Berelowitz argued that the ethnicities of abusers and victims alike\nmirrored those of the communities in which these events took place \u00ad with a\nmajority of abusers, in fact, being white.\nThe BBC and Guardian's critical and sympathetic coverage illustrates that the\nemergent narrative of CSE/A as a Muslim problem is contested. Furthermore, this\nis not simply a matter of mainstream voices (of non-Muslims and white people)\nbeing pitted against those of Muslims, even though this is part of the story. And,\nwhile some non-Muslims are searching for a gradated approach, a number of\nMuslim-identified commentators are taking an opposing stance. Yasmin Alibhai-\nBrown, identifying herself as Muslim, took issue with Berelowitz (2012a), whom\nshe accused of failing to name and blame those who were disproportionately\nresponsible for CSE/A: Muslim men of Asian, specifically Pakistani, heritage.\nAlibhai-Brown alleged that this official was held back by political correctness\nand the fear of being labelled `racist'. In keeping with the shrill and combative\ntone of the right-wing British tabloid newspaper for which she was writing,\nAlibhai-Brown dramatised and sensationalised. `Circles of sexual hell for young\ngirls are run by gangs of Muslim men (most of Pakistani or Bangladeshi heritage)\nwho mostly prey on white girls', she claimed (2012: n.p.). This journalistic extrap-\nolation, in which localised events are linked to a bigger picture and Muslims are\npinpointed as blameworthy, is often implicit; however, there are also instances\nwhere this is unequivocally spelt out for the reader. The New York Times' reporter\nEmma-Kate Symons drew simplistic parallels between the New Year assaults in\nCologne and those that took place in Rotherham. Symons claimed that white girls\nin the northern English town were `targeted ethnically by Pakistani gangs', and\nthat both Rotherham and Cologne formed part of a wider `sexual jihad' (2016: n.\np.). This phrase seems to have been borrowed from India, where a right-wing\nHindutva urban myth, spread through the social media platform WhatsApp, has\nwhipped up majoritarian anger over allegations about Hindu women being\nChambers et al. 7\nabducted by Muslim men, forcibly converted to Islam, coerced into marriage and\n`sexual jihad' may also be a reaction to Amina Wadud's 2006 publication of an\nurgent, radical book entitled Inside the Gender Jihad: Women's Reform of Islam\n(notably, Wadud is an African-American academic and in 2005 became the first\nwoman to lead a New York City mosque congregation in prayer). More generally,\nthough, the idea of sexual jihad revisits and renews a wider discourse in which\nMuslim men are portrayed as sexual tyrants and, conversely, sexual tyrants are\nportrayed above all as Muslims.\nThe issue of CSE/A is not just explored with journalistic relish, as evidenced by\nits treatment in Nadeem Aslam's acclaimed anti-clerical novel, Maps for Lost\nLovers. From his controversial opening line on the subject \u00ad `[s]emen was found\ndetails of the sexual abuse of a child by a Muslim preacher. This cleric has been\nemployed in a northern English mosque despite his known history of assaults on\nchildren, and the novel traces the religious community's cover-up of this abuse.\nIt is important to examine this example in the context of Aslam's manifest aesthetic\nqualities, as well as his problematic overloading of religious maltreatment in the\nnovel. Maps for Lost Lovers' primary plotline centres on the `honour' killing of an\nunmarried British Pakistani couple who live together, but subsidiary cruelties\ninclude the violent exorcism of djinns, women's lack of rights under Islamic\ndivorce and the pernicious effects of gender segregation.\nThese descriptions, some of them caricatures and all of them freighted with\nnegativity, touch on many of the themes that various Muslim-identified and\nnon-Muslim writers, from journalists to novelists, have written against. We now\nturn to some of the counter-hegemonic representations that these writers have\nproduced.\nHappier pictures of Muslim sexualities\nResponding to the pervasive pictures of misery evaluated above, more positive\nperspectives on Muslim sexualities are gaining traction and attention. To begin\nwith the mainstream media, the Herald Scotland (Duffy, 2014: n.p.), BBC (2003: n.\np.) and Guardian (Samira Ahmed, 2013: n.p.) have run stories about the popularity\nof speed dating and modern matchmaking experiences in Muslim communities.\nThe very act of publishing these stories serves to establish Muslims as rounded\nhuman beings who engage in diverse dating and relationship norms, thus challeng-\ning commonplace perceptions of Muslim relationship practices. Within such\nreportage, young British Muslim men and women openly break down stereotypes\nof the traditional Muslim and instead reveal a glimpse of the real-life experiences\nof the everyday Muslim who could easily be the assumed white, secular reader's\nMuslim neighbour, colleague or friend. For example, in the Guardian article `Single\nMuslim Women on Dating: \"I Don't Want to Be a Submissive Wife\"', journalist\nSamira Ahmed focused in particular on Asma, who described several dating horror\nstories with wry humour and open-mindedness (Samira Ahmed, 2013: n.p.).\nSimilarly, in 2015, left-leaning tabloid the Mirror published an article `\"Tinder\nfor Muslims\" Targets Religious Singletons who Are Sick of Shallow Hook-up\nServices'. In it, Jasper Hamill (2015) interviewed Shahzad Younas, the 30-year-\nold founder of halal dating app Muzmatch, who drew attention to his female-\nfocused algorithms and the app's emphasis on encouraging marriage matches\nrather than dick pics. In a longer journalistic investigation into the `Islamic\nTinder' phenomenon, Triska Hamid (2017) spoke to the users (rather than the\nCEOs, as had previously been the norm) of dating apps such as Muzmatch,\nMinder and Salaam Swipe. In this article, three consumers \u00ad Amira, Noura and\nAyesha (respectively a lawyer, a civil servant and an entrepreneur) \u00ad bemoan the\n`quality' of men to be found online and in the `real world', stating that their high-\npowered jobs make them `intimidating' to single men of their own age (Hamid,\n2017: 84). As single Muslim women looking for love, Asma, Amira, Noura and\nAyesha highlight through their stories those challenges faced by ordinary Muslim\nwomen. These challenges often turn out to be not so different from those of any\nother single woman looking for love, irrespective of religion or culture.\nWorking alongside, and sometimes within, the mainstream media, a new wave\nof young Muslims are also finding ways to present their friends, families and\ncommunities as confident, contented people who enjoy life and engage in well-\nrounded relationships. For example, in 2014, a YouTube video entitled `Happy\nBritish Muslims' was disseminated by an incognito group of British Muslims\nknown as Honesty Policy as a tribute to African American singer-songwriter\nPharrell Williams. `Happy British Muslims' quickly went viral as a joyous antidote\nto the dominant narrative of `sick' Muslim sexuality. At the time of writing, the\nvideo has garnered 2,378,323 views and many inches of newsprint. It features men,\nwomen and children from various ethnic groups dancing, even body popping, to\nWilliams' hit song `Happy'. Comprising an emblematic slice of contemporary\nMuslim society, some of the women featured are muhajabah while others are\nnot. Similarly, the everyday people highlighted in the video wear everything\nfrom Guy Fawkes masks to abayas, shalwar kameez to jeans and children's\nfancy dress costumes. It is the ordinariness of the people depicted in the video\ntogether with the upbeat soundtrack that is both affecting and effective.\nIdentifiably British settings, such as skateboard parks, suburban living rooms,\na greasy spoon cafe, council estates, dreaming spires and a mosque form the\nbackdrop to the video.\nTwo record-scratch moments briefly pierce the exuberant optimism, providing\nhints of a gloomier experience. Firstly, Cambridge scholar Sheikh Abdal-Hakim\nMurad, also known by his birth name of Tim Winter and renowned for his serious\ndemeanour, stares impassively at the camera before holding up an explanatory\n`I'm happy' sign (Honesty, 2014: n.p.). Later in the YouTube clip, another dis-\ncomforting moment arises and then quickly passes when two Muslim men appear\nto square up to each other, but soon stand down and break into jiving together to\nWilliams' catchy vocals. There was limited criticism of the video as haram, and this\nChambers et al. 9\njudgement that it was not permissible for believing Muslims possessed a sexual\nangle, because music and dancing are seen as gateways to impropriety. However,\nthe primary critic \u00ad an online Muslim news source the Shaam Post \u00ad quickly\nremoved its article stating that Sheikh Murad had distanced himself from the\nvideo, when Murad turned around and contradicted this stance by speaking to\nthe Independent in favour of Honesty Policy's activism (Merrill, 2014: n.p.). Some\nonline commenters were less circumspect, however, with one, Mohammad\nGhasemi, expressing his strong distaste for the free interaction between the male\nand female dancers, as well as the expressions of sexuality present in the video\nwhen he remarked: `It is Haram [against Islam] for women to dance in front of\nmen. You are not real muslims. This video is vomiting [sic]'. At the other end of the\npolitical spectrum, another commenter (A Freeman) succinctly demonstrated the\nprevalent `everyday racism' Muslims regularly encounter when (s)he wrote as\nfollows: `There are NO \"British Muslims\" \u00ad only alien invaders and colonists\nOR native convert traitors to their nation and heritage. Their nation is Islam,\nnot Britain, and their British passport is simply a flag of convenience' (Honesty,\nseems to accuse all Muslims of being `enemies within' the British nation-state,\nwhose loyalties reside outside Britain with the Ummah or global community of\nMuslims. Honesty Policy's presentation of British Muslims' performance of hap-\npiness was innovative in that it cut across and contradicted contemporary por-\ntrayals of British Muslims as dour, sexually repressed and `alien' to perceived\nWestern contemporary lifestyles.\nHowever, there is an adversarial quality to the stories we have discussed so far.\nStereotypes of miserable Muslims, personified in the figure of the tyrannical\nMuslim man who preys on white girls and women while his wife, daughters and\nsisters fester at home behind closed doors, are countered by depictions of happy\nand sexually liberated Muslims. Arguably, both of these perspectives are simplistic:\none dwelling on problems that have some substance but which are exaggerated and\nwildly distorted, and the other glossing over tensions and challenges in its effort to\npresent a more positive picture of the sexual lives of Muslims. The latter, however\nwell-meaning, idealises Muslims, potentially dehumanising them. Imen Neffati\n(2016: n.p.), a Tunisian researcher based at the University of Sheffield, contends\nthat Muslims are too often rendered as `angelic' and `innocent', especially by leftist\nwriters. Neffati defends Daoud in the face of such ange\u00b4lisme, situating him as a\nNorth African Muslim scholar criticising Islam from the inside. And yet, as we\nhave argued, Daoud's article is unbalanced in its attempt to confront the problems,\nhowever real, that led to the sexual attacks in Germany.\nPulling in an opposite direction, Pnina Werbner provides fascinating, but per-\nhaps overly optimistic, discussion of everyday multiculturalism and conviviality\namongst British Muslim communities, even as she recognises that these positive\ninteractions usually take place in gender-segregated private spaces (2013: 405).\nLondon Olympics and the mostly warm British reception towards then-emerging\nMuslim athlete Mo Farah are complicated by her own "
