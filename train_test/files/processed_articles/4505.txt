    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study explores how hiking trips in the forest afford two Norwegian families experiences of leisure during the trips. In situ\ninterviews were analyzed using a descriptive phenomenological research method, which brackets theoretical or ideological\nassumptions during data collection and analysis. The results show that three levels of experience are interwoven. First,\nindividual family members, parents as well as children, are immersed in the activities in their physical environment, which\nevokes positive bodily feelings. Second, interactions and dialogue between family members concerning actual events during\nthe trip give rise to a sense of belonging and togetherness. Finally, the family creates a narrative about itself in the light of\nits own future as well as sociocultural expectations. We characterize this tapestry of experiences as an act of hiking leisure.\nWe conclude that the experience of the hiking trip goes beyond a simple duality of a core versus balance activity theory and\nanswers the call for research that incorporates the natural contexts in which leisure activities take place.\n",

The idealization of\nfamily leisure in various media outlets depicts quality time\nand family togetherness in a positive light (Shaw, 2001). In\nresearch, it is argued that family leisure involvement pro-\nmotes family functioning and \"facilitates feelings of close-\nness, personal relatedness, family identity and bonding\"\nmon activities during family time can be romanticized as\ntime involving \"everyone having fun or strengthening bonds\nhowever, present a less romantic, more critical take on fam-\nily leisure. Shaw (2008) pointed out that the different mem-\nbers in the family can have different experiences with family\nleisure. While mothers may continue experiencing the\nresponsibility of caring for the children associated with nec-\nessary household chores, fathers may structure their leisure\nby adopting the children's activities (Such, 2006). Harrington\n(2014) found that in Australian families, there is a classed\ndimension in the parents' intentions for joint family activi-\nties. A common aim among low-income parents is to create\nfamily bonds that last after the children have left home.\nMiddle-income parents stressed that family leisure can pass\non values that are important to children's later work life, such\nas \"working together, getting along, being responsible\"\n\"The Core and Balance Model of Family Leisure\nFunctioning\" (Zabriskie & McCormick, 2001) describes\n\"core\" and \"balance\" as two functions of family leisure activi-\nties. Core family leisure addresses needs for stability and\ncohesion between family members. It typically involves activ-\nities such as watching television together, playing board\ngames, playing in the yard, or other home-based activities.\nBalance family leisure addresses the families'need for change\nand the opportunity to learn new skills through novel experi-\nences. It typically involves the families physically getting\naway from everyday hustle to unusual, less frequent, non\u00ad\nhome-based activities (Zabriskie & McCormick, 2001), such\nas trips to a theme park or outdoor recreation. Theoretically,\nthis model suggests that to promote family functioning, there\nshould be a relatively equal involvement in family leisure at\nhome and away (Zabriskie, 2001). It also suggests that\nalthough most activities can be characterized as either balance\nor core, some activities may provide stability for one family\n1University College of Southeast Norway, Kongsberg, Norway\n2Telemark Hospital, Skien, Norway\n3Hedmark University College, Elverum, Norway\nCorresponding Author:\nRob Bongaardt, Faculty of Health and Social Science, University College of\nEmail: rob.bongaardt@hit.no\nHiking Leisure: Generating a Different\nExistence Within Everyday Life\nRob Bongaardt1, Idun R\u00f8seth2, and B\u00f8rge Baklien3\n Keywords\nfamily leisure, core and balance activity, leisure affordance, Giorgi, phenomenology\n2 SAGE Open\nbut change and novelty for another (Zabriskie & McCormick,\nresearch that goes beyond a sheer theoretical approach and\nincorporates context, such as the natural environment, includ-\ning trees, grass, events, animals, and so on. In this article, we\naddress how two Norwegian families make sense of their\nexperiences with hiking in the forest. How does the experi-\nenced meaning of their hiking trip relate to the functions of\nleisure delineated by the core and balance model and how does\nthe natural environment provide context for these functions?\nTo answer these questions, we build on the concept of\nbridges the gap between the physical and the experiential\nworlds that families engage in when hiking in the forest. In\nthe next section, we will present the affordance concept,\nincorporating recent theoretical developments. A phenome-\nnological study of two families hiking in the forest forms the\ncore of this article. We explain how we designed and con-\nducted this research, linking the theoretical framework of\naffordances to Husserlian descriptive phenomenological\nresearch. In the discussion, we underscore the relation\nbetween the general meaning structure of the phenomenon at\nhand--a family hiking in the forest--and the various affor-\ndances that are effectuated in this activity. We suggest that\nthese two Norwegian families seek experiences of the famil-\niar as well as novelty in their hiking trips, demonstrating a\nblend of core and balance activities.\nThe Concept of Leisure Affordance\nPierskalla and Lee (1998) proposed a holistic model of recre-\nation that takes into account the experience of meaning for\nthe person as well as the properties of the environment that\nare significant to the realization of this meaning. They\nresorted to ecological perception theory, as initiated by\nGibson (1986) and further developed by the Gibsonians\nthe basis for their model. Affordance is the core concept of\nthe ecological approach to perception and action; an affor-\ndance is defined as a property of the environment that affords\naction that is meaningful for the organism. In recreational\nscience, as Pierskalla and Lee (1998) argued, one can speak\nof leisure affordances, that is, information in the environ-\nment that affords leisure activities for human beings:\nExamples of forest affordances include locomotion (e.g., trails),\nmanipulation (e.g., forest products), concealment (e.g., city\nbuffers), and certain behaviour (e.g., roads vs. hiking trails).\nThese affordances can also be described by the perceiver using\nmental concepts such as excitement, relaxation, or stress. (p. 71)\nAnother ecological psychological concept endorsed by\nPierskalla and Lee (1998) is that of event. An event takes\nplace with a spatial and temporal configuration and captures\nthe whole of the affordance and activities that take place\nwithin it. A hiking trip, for instance, begins and ends with\nrespect to both time and place; it is an event in itself, includ-\ning a pattern of activities that effectuates affordances that are\navailable and meaningful. Events are seen as nested struc-\ntures, and Pierskalla and Lee (1998) stated that \"[f]uture\nresearch might suggest that a short hiking event in a park be\nnested in a longer vacation event\" (p. 72). We will return to\nthe idea of nesting in the discussion.\nThe concept of leisure affordance was picked up by\nKleiber, Walker, and Mannell (2011) in the second edition of\nA Social Psychology of Leisure. They further specified the\nconcept of leisure affordance in outdoor environments to\ninclude preferred experience, that is, qualities such as \"par-\nticularly enjoyment, relaxation, and a feeling of comfortable\ntion, they underscored the role of social affordances. In this\nfield of research, it is important to understand the properties\nof an environment that afford social interaction or are \"con-\nducive to self-expression more generally\" (Kleiber et al.,\nThree troublesome themes run through these adaptations\nof the ecological approach to leisure science, namely, the\nquestion of how affordances for physical activity relate to\naffordances of a psychological and social nature, the issue of\nthe existence of affordance for the individual as experienced\nas meaningful yet existing independently of the individual in\nthe environment, and a lack of empirical research applying\nand developing the leisure affordance concept. Points of\ndebate around the affordance concept in general have existed\nreview of these). A recent article by Rietveld and Kiverstein\n(2014) developed a conceptual framework that claims to\novercome some of the sticky problems, and, as we stress for\nthe purpose of this article, offers a way to frame the leisure\naffordance concept that opens up for its use in empirical\nresearch. The crux of their approach is to emphasize that\naffordances are embedded in sociocultural practices (Rietveld\n& Kiverstein, 2014). The varieties of practices that humans\nengage in are patterned as different \"forms of life,\" \"manifest\nin the normative behaviours and customs of our communi-\nThe flexibility that the notion of a \"form of life\" offers allows us\nto capture the variety of practices within the human way of life.\nIt can be understood on at least three grains of analysis: the\nhuman form of life in general (as contrasted with the form of life\nof another kind of animal); a particular sociocultural practice . . .;\nand finally, the particular engagement with affordances of\nindividuals that we see when we zoom in on this practice at a\nmore detailed level of analysis. It is this straddling of different\ngrains of analysis that makes the notion of \"form of life\" well\nsuited for using it in a definition of affordances. (Rietveld &\nFor the individual, the perception and effectuation of affor-\ndances requires a certain skill. Children and adult novices\nBongaardt et al. 3\nalike require \"the improvement of perceiving with practice\nEducators provide normative assessment of the learner's per-\nception based on the execution of a particular skill in an\nactual situation: \"situated normativity,\" as Rietveld and\nThe properties of the particular physical environment also\nrequire the education of attention: Steep Amsterdam stairs or\nrain on an icy mountain road provides instant \"judgment\" of\nthe skill of the one who dares to take on the climb. The par-\nticular skills of an individual, in other words, require a famil-\niarity with the socio-material surrounds in agreement with a\nparticular form of life, which provides normative standards\n(Rietveld & Kiverstein, 2014). In terms of the present article,\nall this translates into saying that hiking in the forest as a\nleisure activity takes place in a landscape of leisure affor-\ndances, whereby the latter can be understood as nested socio-\nmaterial properties of the surrounds that afford positive\nfeelings of well-being.\nWe now turn our attention to the concrete use of the idea\nof leisure affordances in a field study, that is, a gateway to\nunderstanding what sense families make of their hiking trip\nand how this translates into the constructs of core and bal-\nance family leisure activities. As we will describe in the next\nsection in more detail, we accompanied and interviewed two\nfamilies on day-long hiking trips through a forest. For the\ninterviews and the analysis, we used a descriptive phenome-\nnological research approach. It has been argued that the\nGibsonian approach is congruent with phenomenology.\nThese approaches understand perception, movement, and the\nbody in similar ways, which is best illustrated with reference\nto Merleau-Ponty (Merleau-Ponty & Smith, 2002). Dohn\n[r]eturning to the concept of affordances with the Merleau-\nPontian notion of body schema, the two concepts emerge as\ncomplementary ways of referring to the fact that concrete\nsituations are, objectively seen, meaningfully structured relative\nto the actual skills of a particular agent. (p. 161, emphasis in\noriginal)\nPhenomenological psychologists who followed Merleau-\nPonty and Husserl (a founding father of phenomenology)\nhave developed research methods that tease out meanings as\nthese are experienced by a person in a concrete situation. We\ncontend that the phenomenological research method we have\nused in our study of a family's hiking trip is consistent with\nand, in fact, a concrete operationalization of a Gibson-\ninspired study of leisure affordances.\nMethod\nDescriptive phenomenology aims to uncover the meaning\nstructure of a phenomenon as it appears to the consciousness\nof those who experience it. As consciousness is primarily\nconcerned with something else than itself, this meaning\nstructure describes the meaningful relationships that the per-\nson has with others and the world as well as his or her own\nplace within this. This meaning is as experienced by the per-\nson and is not merely a statement about the external world. It\nis said that phenomenologists refrain from claiming existen-\ntial truth and rather focus on how the phenomenon and its\nmeaning appear to the person as manifest through his or her\ninteraction with them. In this particular study, we used\nGiorgi's (2009) descriptive phenomenological method.\nGiorgi based his research method on Husserl's phenomeno-\nlogical philosophy, but he changed it to enable it to be used\nin research on other persons than oneself, as is common in\nqualitative social and human scientific research.\nData are typically obtained from people's everyday life\nworld, which is the \"common everyday world into which we\nare all born and live\" (Giorgi, 2009, p. 10). When collecting\nand analyzing the data, the researcher is to suspend or\n\"bracket\" theoretical assumptions about the phenomenon\nunder study. The researcher also makes an effort to minimize\nhis or her own preconceptions about the phenomenon and\nadopts an attitude of wonder (Merleau-Ponty & Smith,\n2002). After the analysis and presentation of data are com-\npleted, the researcher can remove the brackets and open up\nthe newly acquired description of the phenomenon for fur-\nther dialogue with existing research or other rich sources of\ninformation about the phenomenon at hand, or, for example,\nwith professional practice.\nParticipants\nThe data for this particular study were selected from a previ-\nous set of data collected in Norway in 2012 to explore phe-\nnomenologically the relationship between hiking in nature\nand experienced sense of well-being (Baklien, Ytterhus, &\nBongaardt, 2015). Two of the interviews in that study took\nplace over the course of a day, in contrast to the other inter-\nviews that took no more than about half an hour. The present\narticle is based on those two day-long trips. We recruited the\ntwo families through their blogs on the Internet where they\nhad posted pictures and text about being a family who enjoy\nhiking in nature. Both families consisted of a Norwegian\nmother and father (all in their 30s) and two children (5 and\n11, and 8 and 10 years old, respectively). These are typical\nnuclear families and may represent the ideal of family leisure\nexperiences. In Norway, as in other parts of Western Europe\nand North America, other family constellations are common\n(Shaw, 2010). This was also the case in our original data set\nas referred to above. We joined these two families on whole\nday trips because they both had a reflective attitude toward\nhiking experiences (as witnessed by their engagement on\ntheir Internet site) and were willing to include us in their in\nsitu hiking experience. The third author went along with the\nfamilies on a trip into the woods and conducted the inter-\nviews on the way and during a gathering around a campfire.\n4 SAGE Open\nThe trips were focused on activities such as fishing or pre-\nparing food rather than walking a long distance. During the\nactivities, individual and family meanings were generated\nand confirmed as we will describe in depth. Following fami-\nlies with different constellations on a day-long trip would\nperhaps have revealed different meanings. The impression\nfrom our earlier study (Baklien et al., 2015), however, is that\nexperienced meanings in this natural context of hiking in the\nforest converge into similar themes.\nFieldwork\nThe focus was on the family as a unit and the entire inter-\nviews took place with both parents and both children present.\nThis type of fieldwork has been called \"go-along\" (Carpiano,\nactivities, one gets an opportunity to see the phenomenon\nunfold in its natural setting (Czarniawska, 2007; Ingold &\nalong with informants in the neighborhood, to the shop, to a\npark, or out in the woods and, at the same time, ask questions\nand observe how they experience, interpret, and practice\nsuch environments (Carpiano, 2009). This method is suitable\nwhen the researcher desires to be present in the informant's\n\"natural\" environment to ask questions, listen and observe,\nand explore life worlds and social practices where the phe-\nnomenon takes place (Kusenbach, 2003). While the theoreti-\ncal framework that we described above helped us to frame\nthe research situation and maintain sensitivity to experienced\nmeanings during the fieldwork, the theory of leisure affor-\ndance did not inform the content of meanings that we teased\nout during the analysis. That is to say, with respect to the\nmeaning content as experienced by the participants, we\nbracketed our preconception of leisure affordances.\nData Collection\nThe researcher met the families in their respective homes.\nBoth families took the researcher to a bonfire site where the\nfamily made a small shelter known as gapahuk. To meet the\nfamilies before the trip, to learn their names, and to walk\nalong with them to the bonfire site gave the researcher a\nchance to chat before the interviews and to get an impression\nof how the family interacted as a unit during the hiking trip.\nIt also gave the researcher an opportunity to create a some-\nwhat informal relationship to avoid the feeling that he was\nsome kind of \"inspector\" judging the family's interactions\nand hiking skills. Some tension was present, however, espe-\ncially in relation to being a professional researcher, a partici-\nFor example, when the family shared food and coffee with\nthe researcher, he was a guest; when participating in carrying\ngear or collecting dry wood for the fire, he was a participant;\nand when asking questions, he was a researcher. The inter-\nviews were recorded when sitting around the fire. Both\nfamilies were eager to share their experience. Most of the\ndescriptions came from the parents; the children occasion-\nally joined the conversation, but took part in most of the\nongoing activity. The taped interviews lasted approximately\n2 hr each.\nData Analysis\nIn our study, two families totaling eight persons participated.\nThe interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed, and ana-\nlyzed using Giorgi's (2009) phenomenological method. The\ninterviews were conducted in Norwegian. In his research\nmethod, Giorgi recommends four steps to analyze data. The\nfirst step is to read the entire transcript to get a sense of the\nwhole. In Step 2, the transcript is read again, and meaning\nunits are identified. That is to say, when rereading the inter-\nviews, the researcher makes a mark in the text when he or she\nexperiences a shift in the meaning. This typically occurs\nwhen the participant moves on to another aspect of his or her\nlife world. The 4 hr of interview data showed a typical repeti-\ntion of meanings. In Step 3, the meaning units are trans-\nformed into a cohesive language in an effort to identify the\ngeneral character of the meaning unit. This is a process of\nso-called imaginative variation, in which the researcher tries\nout different formulations of what is said at various levels of\ngeneralization. The formulation that captures the meaning of\nthe experience across participants is taken into the final step\nof analysis. All authors were involved in this third step as\nwell as the fourth step. In the fourth step, the transformed\nmeaning units are synthesized to a consistent statement that\nexpresses the general meaning structure of the entire experi-\nence of the phenomenon. The structure must be found in all\nthe interviews to be part of the essence of the experience of\nthe phenomenon. However, in the interpretation of the results\nof the study, one should be aware that the general meaning\nstructure can never grasp the totality of the original experi-\nence (Giorgi, 2009). The researcher has to read \"between the\nlines\" and tease out \"the coherence between explicit and\nimplicit meanings in the description\" (R\u00f8seth, 2013, p. 29).\nThat is to say, due to the process of imaginative variation,\nthese meanings appear in the meaning structure in different\nphrasings than those used by the participants. The fourth step\nwas the opportune moment in the analytical process to make\nthe shift from Norwegian to English. The meaning structure\nwas written in English from its first draft onward, whereas\nSteps 1 to 3 were conducted in Norwegian.\nGiorgi's (2009) research method usually involves at least\nthree separate interviews with different persons who share\ntheir views and experiences of the phenomenon under study.\nThe reason for this is that having only one or two participants\nputs a heavy strain on the imaginative variation; it becomes\nmore difficult to separate the essential from the more inciden-\ntal meanings. Since our study included two families with a\ntotal of eight participants, we judge our data to be sufficiently\nrich and varied to grasp meanings that are more general.\nBongaardt et al. 5\nResults\nThe phenomenological analysis revealed a general meaning\nstructure of the families' experience of hiking in the forest.\nThe results are presented as follows: first, the general mean-\ning structure that describes the families'experience of hiking\nin the forest. Second, three interrelated constituent parts of\nthe meaning structure are described. These constituents are\ninterdependent and should not be confused with theoretical\nthemes. However, it is common in Giorgi's descriptive phe-\nnomenology to take the essential meaning structure apart and\nexplore its constituents independently of each other for the\nsake of further analysis and discussion (Von Essen &\nEnglander, 2013). The constituents are presented with refer-\nence to quotes from the participants. These were translated\ninto English by a professional translator.\nThe General Meaning Structure of Hiking Family\nLeisure\nThe family's experience is that the upcoming hiking trip to\nthe forest is a continuation and confirmation of their desire as\na family to integrate outdoor experiences into the way they\nlive their life. In a sense, this trip had started already when\nthey came home from the previous trip and were pondering\nabout where to go next time, thus prolonging the good feel-\nings that the recent trip had generated. Before the onset of the\nnew trip, they planned when, where, and with whom to go\nhiking. Although they look forward to the joy that comes\nwith the trip, getting out of the door still implies the mental\nchallenge of leaving behind many things left undone. This is\na tension they are aware of and know will dissolve once they\nare on their way. They pack for the hiking trip in anticipation\nof encountering a world with physical demands more chal-\nlenging than those at home. At the same time, they prepare\nfor a simple form of life in choosing to leave behind elec-\ntronic devices or other luxury goods. Having experienced the\nsimplicity of outdoor life themselves earlier in life, the par-\nents are eager to pass on to their children the manual skills\nand peaceful frame of mind that come with the trip. While on\nthe trip, the family gradually loses their interest in clock time\nas they become driven by the length of day given to them by\nthe light of the sun and a campfire. They tune in to the pace\nof the environment, through which also the pace of the fam-\nily members becomes more synchronized than it usually is at\nhome. Basic tasks, like fishing, collecting firewood, and pre-\nparing and eating a meal around the campfire bring the fam-\nily together. Individually, a bodily feeling of well-being\nemerges in congruence with the satisfactory and successful\nbodily efforts that were made earlier that day--like walking\na long distance or climbing a steep slope. Good feelings also\ncome with sitting close together and feeling the warmth of\nthe flames or tasting self-prepared food. An awareness of\neach person's well-being as well as being in tune as a family\nunderscores for them the relevance of being outdoors as part\nof their life. They reinforce family unity during hiking trips\nby remembering and telling stories about earlier trips. These\nverbal exchanges and reflections converge into a larger nar-\nrative that conveys a shared meaningful world that surpasses\nthe family's everyday life as lived at home, while still being\nintegrated into their family life.\nWe identified the following three constituents integrated in\nthe general meaning structure: (a) simplicity and bodily\nawareness, (b) joint activity and cohesion in the family, and\n(c) creating a larger family narrative. Between them, the three\nconstituents underscore that the family is aware of the rele-\nvance that they attach to hiking and of their purposeful initia-\ntive and endeavor to implement the hiking trips. We propose\nto characterize this awareness-driven endeavor as an act of\nhiking leisure. Before we discuss the meaning structure, con-\nstituents, and the idea of hiking leisure in terms of the leisure\naffordance concept, we will describe the three constituents in\nmore detail with reference to quotes from the interviews.\nConstituent 1: Simplicity and Bodily Awareness\nThe first constituent identifies the individual family mem-\nber's interaction with the environment and the positive\nbodily feelings this evokes. Immersed in the peacefulness of\nthe environment, a sense of simplicity takes over. The mother\nin Family 2 explains that you \"don't miss the paper and news\non TV and stuff like that. Because it means so little when\nyou're out on a hike.\" The father adds that when \"you're out\nhiking, there aren't any problems . . . whatever you've for-\ngotten, well, you've kind of forgotten it . . . if you forgot to\nbring a fork, it's too bad. So you have to find another solu-\ntion. Make a fork from a piece of wood or something.\" The\nfather in Family 1 finds the simple lifestyle in his blackened\ncoffee pot. He says, \". . . it is something about the simplicity.\nThe eternal, somehow. . . . It has great value. Also something\nto do with the campfire, of course.\"\nThe campfire is another token of life taking a turn toward\nless complexity, \"they belong together, campfire and a hik-\ning trip\" (Mother in Family 2). This family tells us that they\nalways make a campfire when that is allowed, and some-\ntimes even during summer, when it is forbidden. The father\nexplains that there \"is something about the sound. . . . It turns\noff other thoughts . . . getting cleansed a bit.\" And \"there's\nalso something about sitting and staring at the flames; you\nget a nice warm feeling inside,\" the mother adds.\nHowever, it is not only the campfire which constitutes\nbodily awareness, but also the horizon or the soothing move-\nment of water or trees affords a sense of well-being, accord-\ning to the mother in Family 1: \"There's something that\nmoves, something that's living. But then, there's nothing that\ndemands anything.\" The family members, each in their own\nway, dwell in the peaceful physical environment, which is\nexperienced as a distance from obligations and gives a sense\nof bodily relief and well-being. The father in Family 1 sum-\nmarizes this as follows:\n6 SAGE Open\nI certainly do lower my shoulders a lot when I get outdoors. At\nleast now in a busy period, I'm almost a bit kind of absent when\nI'm at home. My mind is somewhere else all the time, very\noften, with things to be done or that should have been done.\nNow [in the countryside], for example, it's quite different. Now\nI'm completely focused in comparison. What you're doing,\nwhere you are.\nThe first constituent underscores the experiential intertwin-\ning of a world perceived as immediately present through its\nbeauty and simpler qualities and the person's bodily and\nmental well-being expressed as warmth and relief.\nConstituent 2: Joint Activity and Cohesion in the\nFamily\nThe simplicity of the environment invites the family mem-\nbers to see each other in a different light. The forest is with-\nout outsiders or intrusive tasks. It affords another way of\nliving, a different form of social interaction, and a sense of\n\"just being a family\" sharing activities. A son (Family 1)\nstates that \"fortunately there's no internet in the woods, so\nDad cannot work.\" His father confirms that he is aware of\nbeing more present while hiking and that this enables him to\nbe more open to be together with his children: \"it's easier to\nget me to join in their playing or something when we're out\n[hiking] than when we're sitting in the living room.\" The\ncouple in the other family had this exchange:\nMother: I think that for me and [my husband], it's done a\nlot for our relationship that we're so much out on hik-\ning trips. Now we're out hiking. Here we collaborate,\nsomething like that. I don't like to stand idle with my\nhands in my pockets until the tent is up, I need some-\nthing to do. So we have clear tasks, who does what.\nFather: From the moment we find a site for the camp until\nwe're lying in our sleeping bags we don't need a sys-\ntem . . . somehow we both know what the other one\ndoes.\nMother: And it feels very nice that that's the way it is.\nWe witnessed some of the interactions between family\nmembers. The younger son in Family 2, for example, is\nhelping to build the campfire, when the mother asks the\nother son: \"Can you help him? There are a few longer sticks\nback there. Find a small branch or a stick that has fallen\ndown there. Oops!\" [The boy trips and falls] \"Up again.\"\nThe father in this family reflects on his experience that they\nare more together and that he really sees his children when\nthey are out hiking:\nIt binds us more together when we're here in the forest. . . .\nAnyway, I feel that when we get out, I'm more able to see the\nkids properly. . . . It's like . . . hiking . . . is good, both for the\nbody and for cohesion in the family.\nWithout distractions and time constraints, the family\nmembers become more visible to each other. They literally\nemerge in a different light. \"Now I feel it's getting really\ncosy, now that it's getting darker all around us. Can you see\nthat the campfire's shining on [the son's] face, for example?\nCan you see that,\" the father (Family 2) asks the son, \"that\nit's shining on [the sister]? That's nice and cosy.\" The daugh-\nter in the other family notices that her father relaxes more\nwhen hiking; \"at home he is sometimes a little bit more\nstrict,\" she says.\nSitting around the campfire, sensing the presence of others\nand the security they provide, the family members experience\na gathering point where they are just together. It gives them a\nsense of being away from others. When they stare into the\ncampfire or fish or eat together, the focus is on what is happen-\ning in the situation. The parents experience that time slows\ndown when they become aware that time is no longer filled\nwith obligations but with whatever they feel like doing. They\ndescribe their ways of being active together in the moment.\nThe family feels that they can just \"be\" without doing much.\nMother (Family 2): Although we do things and this and\nthat, there's no stress involved. If we're outdoors,\nthere's nothing we've got to do by a certain time,\nmaybe we'll have to be back home for something, but\napart from that, there's no constant time pressure.\nHaving to go here, go there, do this, do that. Here we\ncan just be, we don't necessarily do.\nConstituent 3: Creating a Larger Family Narrative\nSimple living replaces comfortable living at home. The fam-\nily sits on the ground or on some timber and they make sim-\nple food like hot dogs with simple means. They actively seek\na simpler life because that is part of what they experience as\na breathing space. In the breathing space, the family can just\nstop, see each other through a joint dialogue, and create nar-\nratives about themselves. The simplicity is valued and is part\nof the breathing space that becomes a plot or an event they\ncan attach to their shared family narrative. They retell stories\nfrom the distant or recent past to bring forth the sense of\nbeing together that provides continuity and belonging.\nMother (Family 2): But when we were there at Easter\nthen, when [the younger son] had his birthday on Palm\nSunday. Then we'd made it out of a kind of tarpaulin.\nWe'd made it out of wood and so on, that we'd made\nlike a \"gapahuk,\" then we were lying there, each in our\nown sleeping bag, and you look up at the sky and there\nare thousands of stars. It's really an incredible feeling.\n. . . You get a bit of perspective when you're lying\nthere, looking up to see thousands of stars, and if you\nlook some more, you see even more stars. You get a bit\nhumble or how should I put it.\nBongaardt et al. 7\nBy telling stories about earlier trips, the family creates a nar-\nrative, which also incorporates reflections about why it is\nimportant for them to be a family that takes hiking trips--\nthey hike the experience. The young daughter in Family 1\nasks, \"Mom, wasn't it fun when we were hiking there where\nwe were with [friend's name] and there were sheep down\nthere? During the evening the sheep came and stood where\nwe were packing.\"\nSon: They were goats.\nFather: That was another trip.\nDaughter: Yes, and then the sheep came and daddy had to\nchase them away, and they followed him, and he had to\nhide behind a tree.\nThe mother in this family tells us that \"the trip is definitely\ngood in itself, but there's something about knowing, `Well,\nnow I've been out hiking, now we've been together and\nwe've had fresh air and exercise.'\" Her reflections on the\nrelevance of being on family trips then extend to a larger\ntime scale:\nThere's no doubt about it, I take out the kids because I think\nthey'll come to appreciate it, or appreciate it and remember later\n. . . Creating memories, and that has to do with how you yourself\nremember how it was when you went on a trip.\nEven difficult and straining experiences tend to be woven\ninto a narrative that binds the family in a positive manner. As\nthe son in Family 1 recalls, \"We were there, and it was actu-\nally a bit dirty, but then it was fun to slide down the hill.\"\nThrough every hiking trip the family takes, the family's nar-\nrative about hiking is enacted and reshaped.\nDiscussion\nIn the theoretical section above, we have characterized the\nhiking trips of the two families as events with a beginning\nand an end in time and space. As events, these trips are part\nof a sociocultural practice within a form of life that endeav-\nors to find a place between workaday life and leisure. Family\nleisure activities are said to enhance family cohesion,\nincrease family satisfaction, encourage positive interaction\nbetween family members, and bring novel experience and\nadaptive strength into the family. Such scientific concepts\nand theories are abstractions that need to be anchored in an\nanalysis of actual experiences (Pratt, Howarth, & Brady,\n2000). In what follows, we discuss how a Gibsonian theory\nof leisure affordance dovetails with our in-depth descriptive\nphenomenological analysis of two families on a hiking trip.\nThe meaning structure interweaves three levels of affor-\ndances of the hiking trip: First, individual family members\nexperience meaning on a bodily emotional level when they\neffectuate physical affordances present on the trail and in the\nforest. Second, interactions between family members during\nthe trip's events effectuate social affordances of closeness\nand coherence between the family members. Finally, reflec-\ntions on the phenomenon of hiking itself as induced by actual\nevents and joint activity as well as the interviewer's ques-\ntions effectuate cultural affordances. Between them, these\nactivities constitute the act of hiking leisure.\nThe individual family members engage in activities that\nthe forest affords. Good examples are how a fork is cut out of\na stick lying around in the forest, how a campfire is built\nfrom what is available in the immediate surrounds, but also\nthe enjoyment of the view of a sunset afforded by the water-\nside and the mirroring effect of the water surface. Through\neffectuating these leisure affordances, the person experi-\nences a sense of satisfaction and well-being. This takes place\nat the individual level and seems to imply a limited amount\nof explicit reflection during the activity--one is immersed in\nthe act of doing what one is doing. The perspective taken is\nfrom the first person; the \"I\" forms the apex of the experi-\nence. Moreover, it is \"I\" who effectuates affordances that\noffer a counterweight to daily life, balancing out stress and\nroutines. Zabriskie and McCormick (2001) referred to this as\nbalance leisure activities.\nYet, these activities make even more sense to the indi-\nvidual person when they are shared with others. Building the\ncampfire is done together with other family members, the\nview of the sunset is pointed out to the other, implying an\ninvitation between children and parents alike to share the\nperspective. As such, the environment not only consists of\nthe natural surroundings but also of the rest of the family, so\nthat the nature and other family members afford a wider\nrange of activities. Among these activities are the conversa-\ntions within the family about the same view (like the starry\nsky), tasks (like putting up the tent), and artifacts (like the\nfather's blackened coffee kettle). This shared effectuation of\nsocial leisure affordances constitutes the feeling of belong-\ning and togetherness for the family during the trip. In the\nmoment when this happens, it arises between family mem-\nbers without any explicit reflection on this happening itself.\nThe perspective taken is from the second person, that is,\nbetween you and me, and the \"we\" forms the apex of the\nexperience. Between you and me, we effectuate affordances\nthat bring us closer together and confirm the core of our exis-\ntence as a family.\nA third perspective is also present, one that reveals a\nreflective stance on the family hiking experience, putting it\nin a larger sociocultural context. Especially the parents in the\nfamilies are aware of the continuity of their hiking trips. The\nfamily communicates what is significant and meaningful for\nthem through a narrative that is built out of a collection of\nmemorable events, situations, and feelings generated during\ntheir trips. This narrative affords and shapes the families'\nconduct because they enact what is inspiring in their life and\nWhen the family sings about what they are doing, enjoys the\nstarry night, fishes together, or makes a campfire, they do\n8 SAGE Open\nmore than just add words to a narrative; they put their bodily\nawareness and sense of belonging together into their narra-\ntive while being in action. The narrative structure that the\nfamily collectively constitutes thus cannot be separated from\ntheir experience of it. Narratives help inform and form\nthoughts, emotions, and perceptions, and vice versa; what is\nexperienced in the present affects how we understand the\npast and anticipate the future (Goldie, 2000; Heidegger,\n(Van den Berg, 1972). This concerns the future of not only\nthe family as a whole, but also, more specifically, the chil-\ndren who are given experiences that they can continue in\ntheir own family later. One father confirmed this when he\ntold us that he was giving his children an experience that\nchildren from other cultures may not get. The cultural affor-\ndances illustrate most explicitly the normativity implied in\nperspective taken on the family is embedded in the norma-\ntive cultural expectation of Norwegian society to use nature\noptimally as an easily accessible means to promote health\nand family well-being (Riese & Vorkinn, 2002). The apex of\nthis perspective lies beyond the individual family and closer\nto the family \"form of life\" (see above) that Norwegian soci-\nety endorses.\nAt this sociocultural level of understanding, hiking trips\nare primarily regarded as a balancing leisure activity that\nfunctions to promote health and well-being as a counter-\nweight to daily life. Yet, at this level, one can also make a\ncase for understanding the family hiking trips as a core activ-\nity. The argument then goes as follows: Maclaren (2011),\nwho primarily follows Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological\nunderstanding of emotions, differentiates between emotional\nclich\u00e9s and authentic passions. She writes,\nSometimes life presents us with a genuine question--a question\nfor which we do not have an answer prepared, a question that\nunsettles and deranges not only the habitual network of meanings\nthat structures our world, but our very sense of self, of who we\nIn such situations, one may experience a genuine passion,\nwhere emotion takes over and one struggles initially to find a\nplace for it. A sense of passivity characterizes the entire expe-\nrience, but once one manages to resolve the situation and has\nbroken down habitual ways of living, a new understanding of\nself and life may arise; novelty has emerged. In this sense,\nhiking leisure qua balancing out a stressful life is not the cre-\nation of novelty, but rather what Maclaren describes as living\nthrough an emotional clich\u00e9. Clich\u00e9 is used as a descriptive\nterm rather than a normative judgment of the person or the\nemotion. It describes the feelings or emotions that accompany\nthe realization of a meaning that one is already familiar with\n\"established routes for making sense of things . . . that reinsti-\nEmotional clich\u00e9s work for us, Maclaren (2011) explained, in\nhelping us navigate the physical, social, and cultural world;\nwe assent to \"a particular inclination of meaning in [the] per-\nceived world\" (p. 59). In terms of the present article, the fam-\nily realizes affordances with which they are familiar within\ntheir form of life and which they expect to bring a sense of\nbelonging and coherence. As hiking trips are fully integrated\nin the form of life, they can be seen to generate a different\nexistence within everyday life each time they take place.\nConclusion\nIn this article, we have attempted to elaborate on and nuance\nthe understanding of core and balance leisure activities by\nintroducing a conceptual framework and a research setting\nand methodology that underscore the relational character of\nperception, action, and experience. Our research has high-\nlighted some of the concrete meanings of these activities as\nperceived by the family members themselves rather than as\nconceived by theoretical constructs. In doing so, we were\nable to identify various nested layers of family leisure expe-\nriences. \"Hiking leisure\" becomes a meaningful idea because\nthe experience of \"hiking\" \"hikes\" different meanings as part\nof the leisure activity; some counterbalance everyday life,\nsome strengthen a sense of family belonging, while others\nprepare the family for its future. We recognize that within the\nsame trip, both core and balance activities are played out at\ndifferent levels of abstraction, each associated with different\ntypes of leisure affordances. In the light of Zabriskie and\nMcCormick's (2001) model, this illustrates a case in which\none and the same activity fulfills both core and balance func-\ntions. This aligns with Sch\u00e4nzel and Carr's (2016) critical\nevaluation of the core and balance model. They argue that for\nmany present-day family constellations, this duality does not\nhold, or, as is the case in our study, is applicable to some, not\nall, aspects of the leisure activity.\nThe phenomenological approach used in this article is\noften used in the fields of psychology and health care studies\nwhere interviews are conducted in an office. The use of a\nphenomenological in situ approach in the field of leisure\nstudies is not common. One exception is Bischoff's (2012)\nphenomenological-hermeneutical study of hiking trails and\nhow different persons construct a variety of meanings while\nhiking on the same trail based on their individual interpreta-\ntions of its natural surrounds and ideological contexts (as\nindicated by, for instance, the signs that mark the trail).\nEarlier we referred to the \"going along\" methodology. What\nmakes our phenomenological approach different from these\nstudies is that one brackets, whenever possible, theoretical\nassumptions or common sense assumptions while collecting\nand analyzing the data. This implies that one also aims to\nbracket the normative or ideological ideals or critical views\nin the field in which the research is set. That is, \"hiking lei-\nsure\" was allowed to speak for itself through the mothers,\nfathers, and children who engaged in it.\nBongaardt et al. 9\nThe fieldwork proved manageable, but challenges remain:\nAlthough we opted to tape the interviews and conversations\nduring the hours around the fire for practical reasons, other\nunrecorded moments during hiking trips may involve conver-\nsations that are valuable to analyze at the level of detail that\nGiorgi's method provides. For example, transitional moments\nfrom walking on a trail to setting up camp or from being\nengaged in here-and-now actions to talking about experiences\nfrom earlier trips may provide valuable information about the\nshifts between and integration of levels of experiences.\nPaying attention to such moments in future research may also\nprovide more information about the specific affordances\neffectuated in hiking and other leisure situations.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBaklien, B., Ytterhus, B., & Bongaardt, R.
