The Army Study to Assess Risk\nand Resilience in Servicemembers (STARRS) developed risk-targeting systems for these outcomes based on machine\nlearning methods using administrative data predictors. However, administrative data omit many risk factors, raising\nthe question whether risk targeting could be improved by adding self-report survey data to prediction models. If\nso, the Army may gain from routinely administering surveys that assess additional risk factors.\nMethods: The STARRS New Soldier Survey was administered to 21,790 Regular Army soldiers who agreed to have\nsurvey data linked to administrative records. As reported previously, machine learning models using administrative\ndata as predictors found that small proportions of high-risk soldiers accounted for high proportions of negative\noutcomes. Other machine learning models using self-report survey data as predictors were developed previously\nfor three of these outcomes: major physical violence and sexual violence perpetration among men and sexual\nviolence victimization among women. Here we examined the extent to which this survey information increases\nprediction accuracy, over models based solely on administrative data, for those three outcomes. We used discrete-\ntime survival analysis to estimate a series of models predicting first occurrence, assessing how model fit improved\nand concentration of risk increased when adding the predicted risk score based on survey data to the predicted\nrisk score based on administrative data.\nResults: The addition of survey data improved prediction significantly for all outcomes. In the most extreme case,\nthe percentage of reported sexual violence victimization among the 5% of female soldiers with highest predicted\nrisk increased from 17.5% using only administrative predictors to 29.4% adding survey predictors, a 67.9%\nproportional increase in prediction accuracy. Other proportional increases in concentration of risk ranged from 4.8%\nConclusions: Data from an ongoing New Soldier Survey could substantially improve accuracy of risk models\ncompared to models based exclusively on administrative predictors. Depending upon the characteristics of\ninterventions used, the increase in targeting accuracy from survey data might offset survey administration costs.\n",

Although intensive preventive in-\nterventions have been developed in the civilian popula-\ntion and shown to reduce risk of some of these\noutcomes, including those involving physical and sexual\nviolence (e.g., [5, 6]), cost-effective implementation of\nthese interventions would require that they be delivered\nonly to soldiers judged to be high-risk. It has been\nshown that useful risk targeting systems can be devel-\noped for these outcomes based on administrative data\navailable for all U.S. Army soldiers using machine learn-\ning methods, with the small proportions of soldiers\npredicted to be at high risk by these systems accounting\nfor substantial proportions of subsequently observed\ninstances of the outcomes [7\u00ad13]. However, many\nknown risk factors for these outcomes are not assessed\nin Army administrative records, raising the possibility\nthat risk targeting could be improved by expanding the\npredictor sets to include information from such add-\nitional data sources as self-report surveys [13] and social\nmedia postings [14].\nGiven that the risk of many negative outcomes, includ-\ning involvement in physical and sexual violence [4, 15,\n16], is especially high in the early years of Army service,\na survey carried out at the beginning of service might be\nespecially useful in providing information that would\nhelp increase the accuracy of risk-targeting beyond the\naccuracy achieved by exclusively using administrative\ndata as predictors. A New Soldier Survey (NSS) of this\nsort was administered as part of the Army Study to\nAssess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army\nSTARRS) [17]. As reported previously [13], prediction\nmodels derived from NSS data found that the small pro-\nportions of new soldiers judged to be at high risk based\non NSS predictors accounted for relatively high propor-\ntions of attempted suicides, psychiatric hospitalizations,\npositive drug screens, and several types of violent crime\nperpetration and victimization. For example, the 10% of\nnew male soldiers estimated in cross-validated models to\nhave highest risk of major physical violence perpetration\nin the early years of service accounted for 45.8% of ac-\ntual acts of major physical violence in the sample.\nTo date, no results have been reported about the\nextent to which information obtained in the NSS could\nbe used to increase the accuracy of predictions based ex-\nclusively on administrative data. Such increases might be\nespecially large early in the Army career, when adminis-\ntrative data are sparse, with the predictive power of NSS\ndata decreasing relative to that of administrative predic-\ntors over time. The current report presents the results of\nthe first attempt to add data from the NSS survey to\npreviously-developed predicted risk scores based on\nadministrative data. We focus on predicting physical and\nsexual violence perpetration among males and sexual\nviolence victimization among females during the early\nyears of Army service because these are the three out-\ncomes for which separate risk models based on NSS and\nadministrative data were previously developed.\nMethods\nSample\nThe NSS was administered to representative samples of\nnew U.S. Army soldiers beginning Basic Combat Train-\ning (BCT) at Fort Benning, GA, Fort Jackson, SC, and\nFort Leonard Wood, MO between April 2011 and No-\nvember 2012. Recruitment began by selecting weekly\ntion to attend an informed consent presentation within\n48 h of reporting for duty. The presenter explained study\npurposes, confidentiality, and voluntary participation,\nthen answered all attendee questions before seeking\nwritten informed consent to give a self-administered\ncomputerized questionnaire (SAQ) and neurocognitive\ntests and to link these data prospectively to the soldier's\nadministrative records. These study recruitment and\nconsent procedures were approved by the Human Sub-\njects Committees of all Army STARRS collaborating or-\nganizations. The 21,790 NSS respondents considered\nhere represent all Regular Army soldiers who completed\nthe SAQ and agreed to administrative data linkage\n(77.1% response rate). Data were doubly-weighted to ad-\njust for differences in survey responses among the re-\nspondents who did versus did not agree to\nadministrative record linkage and differences in adminis-\ntrative data profiles between the latter subsample and\nthe population of all new soldiers. More details on NSS\nweighting are reported elsewhere [18]. The sample size\ndecreased with duration both because of attrition and\nbecause of variation in time between survey and end of\nthe follow-up period. The sample included 18,838 men\nMeasures\nOutcomes\nOutcome data were abstracted from Department of\nDefense criminal justice databases through December\nDependent variables were defined as first occurrences of\neach of the three outcomes for which predictive models\nhad previously been developed from both administrative\ndata and NSS data: major physical violence (i.e., murder-\nmanslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated arson, aggravated\nviolence, or robbery) perpetration by men, sexual\nviolence perpetration by men, and sexual violence\nvictimization of women, each coded according to the\nBureau of Justice Statistics National Corrections Report-\ning Program classification system [19]. The perpetration\noutcomes were defined from records of \"founded\" of-\nfenses (i.e., where the Army found sufficient evidence to\nwarrant full investigation). The victimization outcome\nwas defined using any officially reported victimization\nregardless of evidence.\nPredictors\nAs reported in previous publications, separate composite\nrisk scores for each outcome were developed based on\nmodels from either the STARRS Historical Administra-\ndetails of building the models that generated these\nscores are reported in the original papers and will not be\nrepeated here other than to say that they involved the\nuse of iterative machine learning methods [20] with\ninternal cross-validation to predict the outcomes over a\none-month risk horizon in a discrete-time person-\nmonth data array [21]. The HADS models were devel-\noped using all the nearly 1 million soldiers on active\nall years of service rather than only for the first few years\nof service, whereas the NSS models were developed\nusing the NSS sample. We then applied the coefficients\nfrom these models to the data from the soldiers in the\npresent samples to generate composite prediction scores.\nThus, each person-month had a single score from each\nmodel representing the predicted log odds of the out-\ncome occurring (note that this score changed each\nmonth for the HADS models, but remained the same\nwithin each person for the NSS models because the NSS\nwas administered only once). Each score was then stan-\ndardized by a mean of 0 and variance of 1 in the total\nsample. These composite prediction scores were used as\nthe input in the current analysis. In other words, for\neach of the models reported here, there were two pos-\nsible two independent variables (plus their transforma-\ntions and interactions): the standardized log odds of the\nevent occurring according to the HADS model and the\nstandardized log odds of the event occurring according\nto the NSS model.\nThe potential predictors selected for inclusion in the\niterative model-building process for the HADS and NSS\nmodels operationalized 8 classes of variables found\nin prior studies to predict the outcomes: socio-\ndemographics (e.g., age, sex, race-ethnicity), mental dis-\norders (self-reported Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\nof Mental Disorders, 4th edition [DSM-IV] disorders in\nthe NSS and medically recorded International Classifica-\ntion of Diseases [ICD] disorders in the HADS models),\nsuicidality/non-suicidal self-injury (self-reported in the\nNSS and medically recorded in the HADS models), ex-\nposure to stressors (assessed in detail in the NSS models\nwith questions about childhood adversities, other life-\ntime traumatic stressors, and past-year stressful life\nevents and difficulties; assessed in the HADS models\nwith a small number of available markers of financial,\nlegal, and marital problems, information about deploy-\nment and stressful career experiences, and military crim-\ninal justice records of prior experiences with crime\nperpetration and victimization), military career informa-\ntion (for new soldiers, Armed Forces Qualification Test\n[AFQT] scores; physical profile system [PULHES] scores\nused to indicate medical, physical, or psychiatric limita-\ntions; enlistment military occupational specialty classifi-\ncations; and a series of indicators of enlistment waivers;\nand for the HADS models, increasing information over\nthe follow-up period about promotions, demotions, de-\nployments, and other career experiences), personality\n(only in the NSS models), and social networks (only in\nthe NSS models). Results of performance-based neuro-\ncognitive tests administered in conjunction with the\nNSS were also included in the NSS models [22]. More\ndetailed descriptions of the HADS and NSS predictors,\nthe final form of each model (i.e., the variables that were\nultimately selected for inclusion by the algorithms), and\npredictive performance are presented in the original re-\nAnalysis methods\nAnalysis was carried out remotely by Harvard Medical\nSchool analysts on the secure University of Michigan\nArmy STARRS Data Coordination Center server. Given\nthat respondents differed in number of months of\nfollow-up, we began by inspecting observed outcome\ndistributions by calculating survival curves using the\nactuarial method [23] implemented in SAS PROC\nLIFETEST [24]. We projected morbid risk to 36 months\neven though some new soldiers were followed for as\nlong as 44 months because the number followed beyond\n36 months was too small for stable projection. Discrete-\ntime survival analysis with person-month the unit of\nanalysis and a logistic link function [21] was then used\nto estimate a series of nested prediction models for first\noccurrence of each outcome. Models were estimated\nThe model-testing process involved two steps: first,\ndetermining the best model using the HADS risk score\nonly, and then finding the optimal strategy for combin-\ning NSS data with the best model from the first step.\nSpecifically, we began with a model including only the\ncomposite predicted risk score based on the HADS\n(expressed as a predicted log odds standardized to have\na mean of 0 and a variance of 1), controlling (as in all\nsubsequent models) for time in service; we then\nestimated models including a quadratic effect of HADS\nrisk score, an interaction of the risk score with time, and\ntheir combination. In the second step, we tested the ef-\nfect of adding the NSS composite predicted risk score to\nthe best HADS model, followed by combinations of a\nquadratic NSS term, an interaction of NSS score with\nHADS score, and an interaction of NSS risk score with\nhistorical time. Importantly, whereas the values of the\nNSS composite risk score did not change with time in\nservice because the NSS was administered only once,\nthe values of the HADS composite risk score did change\ndue to the addition of new administrative data each\nmonth. We tested the significance of interactions be-\ntween the composite risk scores and time in service to\nevaluate the assumption that the HADS composite risk\nscore might become more important over time and the\nNSS composite risk score less important. Design-based\nWald 2 tests based on the Taylor series method [25]\nwere used to select the best-fitting model for each out-\ncome. This method took into consideration the weight-\ning and clustering of the NSS data in calculating\nsignificance tests.\nOnce the best-fitting model for each outcome was se-\nlected, we exponentiated the logistic regression coeffi-\ncients and their design-based standard errors for that\nmodel to create odds-ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence\nintervals (95% CIs). We then divided the sample into 20\nseparate groups (ventiles), each representing 5% of re-\nspondents ranked in terms of their risk scores in the\nbest-fitting models, and calculated concentration of risk\nfor each ventile: the proportions of observed cases of the\noutcome in each ventile. If the models were strong pre-\ndictors, we would expect high concentration of risk in\nthe upper ventiles. Concentration of risk was calculated\nand compared not only for the best-fitting models but\nalso for the HADS-only models to determine the im-\nprovement in prediction strength achieved by adding in-\nformation from the NSS rather than relying exclusively\non HADS risk scores. We also calculated concentration\nof risk for the NSS-only models for comparative pur-\nposes. Finally, we calculated positive predictive value:\nthe proportion of soldiers in each ventile that had the\noutcome over the follow-up period. As with morbid risk,\npositive predictive value was projected to 36 months\nusing the actuarial method to adjust for the fact that the\nfollow-up period varied across soldiers.\nResults\nOutcome distributions\nA total of 186 male NSS respondents were accused of\nfounded major physical violence perpetration and 132 of\nsexual violence perpetration by the end of the follow-up\nperiod, and 135 female NSS respondents reported sexual\nviolence victimization over the same time period. These\nnumbers correspond to incidence estimates per 1000\nperson-years of 4.5 for male physical violence perpetra-\ntion, 3.1 for male sexual violence perpetration, and 19.5\nfor female sexual violence victimization. 36-month morbid\nperpetration, 7.7 for male sexual violence perpetration,\nand 42.6 for female sexual violence victimization (com-\nputed using the actuarial method [23] implemented in\nSAS PROC LIFETEST [24]).

However, the addition of the NSS risk\nscore improved model fit in both cases. We conse-\nquently focused on the additive model (i.e., HADS plus\nNSS composite risk score) for these outcomes. For sex-\nual violence perpetration among men, however, model\nfit was improved by inclusion of the interaction between\nthe NSS composite risk score and time since survey ad-\nministration (2\nmodel (Table 2). (See Additional file 1: Table S1, for\nodds ratios and chi-square values for all models tested.)\nCoefficients in the best-fitting models\nInspection of the odds ratios (ORs) of univariate models\nwith either the NSS or HADS composite risk scores as\nthe only predictors shows that each score is associated\nwith significantly increased odds of each outcome, with\nORs relatively comparable in magnitude for NSS (OR =\nearity, individual predictors' ORs are lower but remain\nsignificant in the two additive models that include both\ncomposite risk scores as predictors (HADS OR = 2.1 for\nphysical violence perpetration and 1.3 for sexual violence\nvictimization; NSS OR = 1.6 for physical violence perpet-\nration and 1.8 for sexual violence victimization). In the\nmodel for sexual violence perpetration, the HADS com-\nposite risk score is significant (OR = 1.4) and stable over\nthe follow-up period, whereas the NSS composite risk\nscore is a significant predictor in the first 12 months of\nservice (OR = 2.3), decreases but remains significant\nduring the second year of service (months 13\u00ad24; OR =\n1.7), and becomes nonsignificant beyond the second year\nConcentration of risk and positive predictive value in the\nbest-fitting models\nConcentration of risk was strongly elevated compared to\nthe 5% of observed cases expected by chance in the top\n3 predicted risk ventiles of all three best-fitting models\n(Fig. 3). 39.5% of observed physical violence perpetra-\nsexual violence victimization occurred among the 5% of\nsoldiers in the top risk ventiles for those outcomes\n(Table 4). Between 49.8% (sexual violence victimization)\nand 56.3% (physical violence perpetration) of observed\ncases of the outcomes occurred among the 15% of\nsoldiers in the top three risk ventiles.\nThese proportions were for the most part meaningfully\nhigher than those achieved by using only the HADS\npredicted risk score (Table 4).

One would\nexpect this improvement to shrink somewhat in out-of-\nsample performance due to the fact that the NSS pre-\ndicted risk score was developed in the same sample as it\nwas applied. However, a counter-balancing consideration\nis that incremental prediction accuracy might increase\nbeyond the level found here if an NSS survey became a\nroutine part of Army accession, as the sample available\nfor analysis would then be large enough for disaggre-\ngated analyses of individual predictors from both admin-\nistrative and survey data rather than requiring the use of\nthe composite predicted risk scores we were forced to\nuse here because of the small NSS sample size.\nWe found unexpectedly that the strength of the NSS\npredicted risk scores remained stable over the time\nperiod of the study for physical violence perpetration\nand sexual violence victimization. This suggests that the\nNSS tapped into relatively stable individual differences\nin risk factors for these two outcomes rather than situ-\national risk factors that became less relevant over time.\nA review of the most important predictors making up\nthe NSS predicted risk scores showed, consistent with\nthis interpretation, that these variables are dominated by\nmeasures of personality, history of pre-enlistment life-\ntime psychopathology, and history of pre-enlistment life-\ntime trauma exposures, most notably prior sexual\nviolence victimization among women and prior involve-\nment in violence among men [13]. For sexual violence\nperpetration, however, the NSS risk score was no longer\na significant predictor after the end of the second year in\nservice (i.e., in months 25 and beyond). This could sim-\nply be a function of greater uncertainty in the model as\ntime progresses (as the confidence interval for the odds\nratio at months 25+ still contains relatively large values),\nor it could reflect a true decrease in the predictive\nstrength over time. Regardless, the NSS data were valu-\nable for predicting the majority of sexual violence per-\npetration outcomes, because 83.2% of reported assaults\noccurred within the first two years of service.\nIt is less clear why the HADS predicted risk scores did\nnot increase in strength over time, as administrative\ninformation about soldiers became richer over time.\nOne plausible interpretation is that the early months of\nservice, when administrative records are sparse, are also\ncharacterized by lower prevalence of the outcomes con-\nsidered here, as new soldiers are more closely supervised\nduring Basic Combat Training (BCT; the first 10\u00ad\n16 weeks in service) and Advanced Individual Training\n(2\u00ad12 months after completion of BCT) so that oppor-\ntunities for violence are lower. Administrative records\nbecome richer after the end of training, at which time\nprevalence of violence outcomes also increases. The ex-\ntent to which the temporal consistencies in prediction\naccuracy continue beyond the early years of service stud-\nied here is unclear, although it seems unlikely that the\nprediction accuracy of survey reports obtained from 18-\nyear-old new soldiers will maintain constant strength\nover many years in service. This question will be the\nfocus of ongoing analyses of the STARRS data as the\nNSS cohort ages.\nFig. 2 Pearson correlations between composite risk scores based on the HADS and the NSS by month in the NSS sample (n = 18,838 men and\nEven though the addition of NSS data improved\nprediction of all outcomes beyond the HADS predic-\ntions, the question remains whether the magnitudes of\nthese improvements are large enough to justify imple-\nmenting an ongoing NSS for all new soldiers.

Uncertainties about these values make it\nimpossible to calculate these cost-benefit ratios here, but\nthese are the calculations the Army needs to make if it\nis interested in using evidence-based standards for tar-\ngeting preventive interventions for high-risk new sol-\ndiers.

However, predic-\ntion may be considerably improved through the addition of\nself-report data, especially (1) when an outcome is partly\npsychologically driven, and consequently, subjective infor-\nmation may be a powerful predictor, and/or (2) when im-\nportant predictors in administrative data sets may be noisy\nor inaccurate because they are not fully captured by institu-\ntional systems (e.g., health events when no medical care\nwas sought, covert antisocial behaviors). The control con-\nferred when administering self-report questionnaires is an\nadditional advantage; researchers can select the variables\nthey consider to be most essential, and questionnaires can\nbe designed in such a way that data require little processing\nprior to use in algorithms.\nConclusions\nSelf-report information can substantially improve predic-\ntion of risk for interpersonal violence beyond the infor-\nmation available in administrative databases for Regular\nArmy soldiers early in their careers. The U. S. Army\nmay benefit from ongoing administration of self-\nadministered questionnaires to new soldiers.
