We defined hearing\nimpairment as the pure-tone average .25 dB hearing level of pure-tone thresholds at low/mid-\nHz) and identified independent risk factors using logistic regression.\nRESULTS--Controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and marital status, odds ratios for associations\nand 3.55 (1.57\u00ad8.03) for poor health. Controlling for age, race/ethnicity, sex, and income-to-\npoverty ratio, odds ratios for associations with high-frequency hearing impairment were 4.39\nropathy.\nCONCLUSIONS--Low HDL, coronary heart disease, peripheral neuropathy, and having\npoor health are potentially preventable correlates of hearing impairment for people with diabetes.\nGlycemic control, years since diagnosis, and type of glycemic medication were not associated\nwith hearing impairment.\nSome degree of hearing impairment\naffects over two-thirds of diabetic\nadults, about twofold higher than\nthat of the nondiabetic population (1), yet\nlittle is known about the characteristics of\nthose experiencing this disability. Reports\n(2,3) indicating that audiometric hearing\nthresholds are correlated with diabetes\ncomplications, poor glycemic control, or\ndiabetes duration are often not corrobo-\nrated (4\u00ad6). Although cardiovascular dis-\nease and its risk factors, including\nsmoking, have been linked to hearing\nimpairment in the general population\n(7,8), these associations are unsubstanti-\nated among people with diabetes. One\ninvestigation (9) of diabetes complica-\ntions among a population-based sample\ndemonstrated that hearing impairment\nwas associated with nephropathy but\nnot with retinopathy, diabetes duration,\nor hemoglobin A1c\n(A1C). Thus, the evi-\ndence that diabetes severity is associated\nwith the likelihood of hearing impairment\nis inconclusive.\nRecent national survey data provide\nan opportunity to examine the correlates\nof hearing impairment in a representative\nsample of diabetic adults. The aim of the\ncurrentstudyistoexaminewhether,among\npeople with diabetes, hearing impairment\nis associated with diabetes duration, insulin\nuse, glycemic control, cardiovascular dis-\nease risk factors, or the presence of diabetes\ncomplications.\nMETHODS--Data, collected during\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES), which used a complex, mul-\ntistage, probability sample representative\nof the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S.\n(95.0%) completed the audiometric ex-\namination, and of those, 399 reported\ndiagnosed diabetes when asked the ques-\ntion, \"Other than during pregnancy (for\nwomen), have you ever been told by a\ndoctor or health professional that you\nsigned to a fasting blood draw and were\nevaluated for undiagnosed diabetes using\nthe criterion of a fasting blood glucose\n$126 mg/dL.

A PTA of at least\n25 dB HL is considered to be impairment\nof sufficient severity to present difficulties\nwith understanding speech (10). Item-\nmissing threshold data were considered\nas audiometric nonresponse (tone not per-\nceived). After verifying that the average\nof their available pure-tone thresholds\nexceeded 25 dB HL, participants with\naudiometric nonresponse within a fre-\nquency range were classified as impaired\nfor that range. For graphical purposes,\nthe worse ear was defined as the ear\nwith the greater PTA of all seven thresh-\nolds.\nDemographic characteristics, includ-\ning age, race/ethnicity, sex, marital status,\nand educational attainment were ob-\ntained during interviews. Current smok-\ning status and history of smoking also\nwere obtained by interview. The income-\nto-poverty ratio was defined as the ratio of\nreported total family income to the U.S.\nCensus Bureau poverty threshold. We\ndefined leisure-time noise exposure as a\npositive response to either of two ques-\ntions assessing noise exposure from fire-\narms (outside of work) or other noise\nsources, for an average of at least once per\nmonth for a year. Occupational noise\nexposure was defined as a history of\nloud noise at work that required speaking\nin a raised voice to be heard. Coronary\nheart disease was defined as a positive\nresponse to any of three questions asking\nwhether a doctor had told the participant\nthat they have coronary heart disease,\nangina, or had a heart attack. Participants\nrated their general health status during a\ncomputer-assisted interview. Questions\nabout the current use of insulin and oral\nagents, and years since diabetes diagno-\nsis, were asked of those with diagnosed\ndiabetes.\nAnthropometric and clinical mea-\nsures were obtained during physical ex-\naminations that included a blood draw\nand clean-catch urine collection (11).\nBMI was calculated as weight in kilograms\ndivided by the square of height in meters.\nWe defined central adiposity as a waist\nmeasurement of $102 cm for men or\n$88 cm for women. We defined hyper-\ntension as systolic blood pressure $140\nmmHg, diastolic blood pressure $90\nmmHg, or report of current antihyperten-\nsive medication use. Ankle brachial index,\nthe ratio of systolic blood pressure in the\nbrachial artery to that in the posterior\ntibial artery in the right or left ankle, was\nmeasured in participants aged $40 years.\nWe defined peripheral arterial disease as\nan ankle brachial index ,0.9. Albumin-\nuria was defined as a ratio of urinary al-\nbumin to urinary creatinine $30 mg/g.\nMonofilament testing was administered\nto participants aged 40\u00ad69 years. Periph-\neral neuropathy was defined as having at\nleast one insensate area of six metatarsal\nsites tested (three on each foot) using a\nstandard 10-g monofilament. High cho-\nlesterol was defined as total cholesterol\n$200 mg/dL, a positive response to a\nquestion of whether a health professional\nhad ever told the participant that they\nhave high cholesterol, or reported current\nuse of lipid-lowering medications. Low\nHDL was defined as HDL ,40 mg/dL.\nA1C was assessed by Boronate Affinity\nHigh-Performance Liquid Chromatogra-\nphy using Primus CLC330 and Primus\nCLC 385 (Primus, Kansas City, MO),\nand values were standardized to the\nmethod of the Diabetes Control and\nComplications Trial, yielding interassay\ncoefficients of variation ,3.0% (12). Sub-\noptimal glycemic control was defined as\nA1C $7%. Plasma glucose was measured\nusing a hexokinase enzymatic method\nwith a coefficient of variation of 1.3\u00ad\nData analysis\nThe proportions of our sample with\nhearing impairment at high frequencies,\nat low/mid-frequencies, at both frequency\nranges, and not hearing-impaired were\ncomputed. Statistical differences in the\ndistribution of sociodemographic and\nanthropometric characteristics, noise ex-\nposure, smoking, comorbidities, and\ncharacteristics of diabetes were examined\nwith t tests (for continuous characteris-\ntics) and x2 tests (for categorical charac-\nteristics). For the t test, values for years\nsince diabetes diagnosis were trans-\nformed by taking their natural logarithm\nto better approximate the assumption of\nnormality. The level of significance was\na = 0.05. Characteristics independently\nassociated with a greater prevalence of\nlow/mid- and high-frequency hearing im-\npairment were identified from odds ratios\nand 95% CIs were estimated using logistic\nregression. Models tested with peripheral\nneuropathy, or peripheral arterial disease,\nyears. Differences in the effects of covari-\nates on the odds of hearing impairment by\nwhether diabetes was previously diag-\nnosed were tested with interaction terms.\nAnalyses were performed using SAS ver-\nsion 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and\ngle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC),\nincorporating 6-year sample weights,\nwhich accounted for the probabilities of\nbeing assigned to audiometry and/or to\nfasting plasma glucose testing.\nRESULTS--Two-thirds of subjects\nwith diabetes had high-frequency hearing\nimpairment (Table 1). Twenty-six per-\ncent also had low/mid-frequency hearing\nimpairment. Less than 1% of subjects\nwith diabetes had a low/mid-frequency\nhearing impairment without high-\nfrequency involvement. Characteristics of\nthe U.S. population with diabetes (diag-\nyears, are presented in Table 2 and strati-\nfied by low/mid- and high-frequency hear-\ning impairment. Diabetic subjects with\nhearing impairment had a mean age of\n56\u00ad57 years, which was significantly older\nthan those without hearing impairment.\nAmong those with hearing impairment, a\nlesser proportion was non-Hispanic black\nor Mexican American. No sex differences in\nTable 1--Prevalence of hearing impairment at high frequencies among the U.S. population\nwith diabetes (diagnosed or undiagnosed) aged 20\u00ad69 years stratified by hearing impairment\nn Weighted prevalence (%)\nHearing-impaired at low/mid-frequencies 3 0.5\nBainbridge, Hoffman, and Cowie\nlow/mid-frequency hearing impairment\nwere observed, but there was a markedly\nhigher percentage of male subjects among\nthe hearing-impaired at high frequencies.\nDiabetic adults with low/mid-frequency\nhearing impairment were more likely to\nbe unmarried and to have less than a high\nschool education, whereas no significant\ndifferences in marital or education status\nwere found by high-frequency hearing im-\npairment status. We found no significant\ndifferences in the proportions with hearing\nimpairment by leisure time or occupational\nnoise exposure.\nAmong subjects with diabetes, prev-\nalence of low HDL was significantly\ngreater in those who were hearing-\nimpaired at the low/mid-frequency range,\nwhereas the prevalence of high total\ncholesterol was significantly higher in\nthose who were hearing-impaired at the\nhigh-frequency range. We observed no\ndifferences in hearing impairment by the\nprevalence of hypertension or current\nsmoking status. Coronary heart disease\nwas twice as prevalent among diabetic\nsubjects with low/mid-frequency hearing\nimpairment and over four times as prev-\nalent among those with high-frequency\nhearing impairment compared with those\nwithout hearing impairment. Comparing\ndiabetic subjects with high-frequency\nhearing impairment to those without\nimpairment, estimates for mean BMI and\nthe proportion with central adiposity\nwere not in the expected direction but\nwere not significantly different (P = 0.12).\nPeripheral neuropathy was experienced\nby 25% and peripheral arterial disease\nby 9% of those with high-frequency hear-\ning impairment, about four times the\nprevalence of these complications among\nthose not impaired. Higher prevalence es-\ntimates of albuminuria were observed\namong those with hearing impairment at\nboth frequency ranges, although this was\nstatistically significant at the low/mid-\nfrequency range only. We observed no\ndifference in the proportion with A1C\n$7%. The proportion of subjects with\nlow/mid-frequency hearing impairment\nwho reported being in poor health was\nover two times that of those without\nlow/mid-frequency hearing impairment.\nTable 2--Sociodemographic, noise exposure, and health characteristics of the U.S. population with diabetes (diagnosed or undiagnosed)\nLow/mid-frequencies*\nP\nHigh frequencies\nP\nHearing-impaired\nNot\nhearing-impaired Hearing-impaired\nNot\nhearing-impaired\nSociodemographic characteristics\nRace/ethnicity (%)\nNoise exposure (%)\nHealth characteristics\nFor diagnosed diabetes (n = 399)\n.25 dB in either ear.

Partic-\nipants with low/mid-frequency hearing\nimpairment used insulin more frequently\nand oral medications less frequently\n(marginally significant, P = 0.08).\nAdjusting for sociodemographic fac-\ntors, we found that low HDL levels in-\ncreased the odds of low/mid-frequency\nhearing impairment by 2.2-fold (Table 3).\nThose who reported poor health were\nover three times as likely to have low/\nmid-frequency hearing impairment. Sub-\njects who reported coronary heart disease\nor peripheral neuropathy had over four\ntimes the odds of high-frequency hearing\nimpairment. We found no evidence of ef-\nfect modification of any covariate by di-\nagnosed versus undiagnosed diabetes.\nSuboptimal glycemic control, years since\ndiagnosis, type of glycemic medication,\nBMI, and high total cholesterol were not\nsignificantly related to hearing impair-\nment at either frequency range. Age-\nadjusted mean pure-tone thresholds\nfrom the worse ear are presented by the\npresence or absence of low HDL (Fig. 1A),\ncoronary heart disease (Fig. 1B), periph-\neral neuropathy (Fig. 1C), and poor self-\nreported health (Fig. 1D). Subjects with\nlow HDL and coronary heart disease and\nthose who reported poor health had higher\nthresholds at all frequencies than subjects\nwithout these conditions. Subjects with pe-\nripheral neuropathy had higher thresholds\nCONCLUSIONS--Diabetes-related\nhearing loss has been described as a pro-\ngressive, sensorineural impairment (5)\naffecting audiometric thresholds between\nage-related hearing loss, typically begins\nin the higher frequencies and progresses\nto the middle and then lower frequencies as\npeople age. Correlates of high-frequency\nhearing loss may indicate characteristics\nof those in an earlier stage of presbycusis,\nand subjects who additionally have low/\nmid-frequency hearing impairment are\nmore likely to have had hearing impair-\nment for a longer period of time. Thus,\nwe evaluated correlates of low/mid- and\nhigh-frequency hearing impairment in a\nnationally representative sample of dia-\nWe observed strong associations with\nage and race at both frequency ranges that\nare consistent with evidence from the\ngeneral population (13). Despite the\nhigher prevalence of diabetes complica-\ntions, such as retinopathy and nephropa-\nthy, among non-Hispanic blacks and\nhad lower prevalence of hearing impair-\nment compared with non-Hispanic\nwhites or people from other minority\nrace/ethnicity groups. The higher odds\nof high-frequency hearing impairment\namong male subjects than female subjects\nis possibly attributed to residual confound-\ning by industrial and/or recreational noise\nexposure, for which self-reported measures\noften are inadequate. Excessive noise com-\nmonly affects hair cells sensitive to signals\nolds in this range are more commonly ob-\nserved among male subjects (16). We\nobserved greater prevalence of high- fre-\nquency hearing impairment among those\nwith a lower income-to-poverty ratio,\nconsistent with previously described so-\ncioeconomic inequalities (17). In addi-\ntion to exposure to noisy environmental\nconditions (18), subjects of lower socio-\neconomic status may have a history of in-\nadequate glycemic control, for which we\nare unable to adjust adequately because\nwe have only one A1C measurement. We\nobserved a greater prevalence of low/mid-\nfrequency hearing impairment among un-\nmarried subjects. Cruickshanks et al. (19)\nhave reported greater risk of hearing im-\npairment among unmarried subjects over\n10 years of follow-up, but the role of mar-\nital status in the development of hearing\nimpairment remains unknown.\nThere is debate about whether diabe-\ntes affects hearing through angiopathic or\nneuropathic mechanisms (20). We found\nhearing impairment in the low/mid- and\nhigh-frequency range to be associated\nwith low HDL and coronary heart disease\nhistory, respectively. These observations\nsupport the hypothesis that diabetes-\nrelated hearing loss accompanies an ath-\nerosclerotic mechanism affecting the inner\near that also may occur subsequent to an\nischemic event. There are no population-\nbased studies of subjects with diabetes\nwith which to compare our findings,\nbut Gates et al. (7) described elevated\nlow/mid-frequency pure-tone thresholds\namong male subjects (but not female sub-\njects) of the Framingham Cohort Study\nwith confirmed myocardial infarction\nand reported a greater occurrence of low/\nmid-frequency hearing impairment among\nboth male and female subjects with con-\nfirmed coronary heart disease. Our evi-\ndence agrees with observations by Gates\net al. (7) who found an inverse relationship\nbetween HDL and low/mid-frequency\nPTAamongwomen.Findingsfromastudy\nof middle-aged men in military occupa-\ntions further support an atherosclerotic\nmechanism based on modest associations\nof high total cholesterol and high triglycer-\nides with hearing impairment after adjust-\ning for diabetes (21). It is important to\nnote that we observed no association be-\ntween hearing impairment and albumin-\nuria, an outcome related to microvascular\ndisease. The elevated odds of hearing im-\npairment among non-Hispanic white sub-\njects that we observed compared with\nnon-Hispanic black or Mexican-American\nsubjects also is incongruent with usual\nrace/ethnic patterns of microvascular com-\nplications, such as nephropathy or retinop-\nWe observed a strong association of\nhigh-frequency hearing impairment with\nperipheral neuropathy.

A previous epidemiologic in-\nvestigation of type 2 diabetes and hearing\nimpairment found no association for either\ndiabetes duration or A1C, findings that our\nstudy corroborates (9).\nWe acknowledge the limitations to\nthis analysis. Our sample is derived from\nnoninstitutionalized adults, so we are\nunable to generalize to subjects in nursing\nhomes, where more severe disability\nmight be expected.
