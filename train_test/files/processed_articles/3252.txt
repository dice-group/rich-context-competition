Dabei wird \u00fcblicherweise die Normal-\nverteilungsannahme f\u00fcr die St\u00f6rprozesse getroffen. F\u00fcr viele empirischen Daten,\ninsbesondere im Finanzmarktbereich, erweist sich die Normalverteilung aber als\nunzutreffend, weil ihre Verteilung typischerweise durch \u00fcberm\u00e4ssige Ausrei\u00dfer\ndickere Enden besitzt als die Normalverteilung. Als Alternative bietet sich die\nsogenannte -stabile Verteilung an, deren Eigenschaften durch den Stabilit\u00e4ts-\nparameter () bestimmt werden. Diese Verteilung ist besser geeignet das Verhalten\nsolcher Variablen zu beschreiben; die Normalverteilung ist als Spezialfall enthalten.\nUnter der symmetrischen -stabilen Verteilungsannahme f\u00fcr die St\u00f6rprozesse haben\nBlattberg u.a.

However, the normality assumption is not appropiate for\nmany economic variables, especially financial markets. Financial data are\ntypically fat-tailed and excessively peaked around zero. One altenative\ndistributional assumption is -stable distributions, whose shape is governed by the\nstability parameter, . The -stable distributions are more appropriate to describe\nsuch financial variables; the normal distribution is a special case of the -stable\ndistribution.\nUnder the symmetric -stable distributional assumption for the disturbances,\nBlattberg et al (1971) consider best linear unbiased estimators for a regression\nmodel. This estimator, however, is derived with non-stochastic regressors, which\nhardly enable us to apply it for finacial markets. For example, both individual\nreturns and the market return in the usual capital asset pricing model are\nstochastic. An asymptotic analysis of the estimator is not provided in Blattberg et\nWe consider both the rate of convergence to the true value and the asymptotic\ndistribution of the normalized error of the linear unbiased estimators. In so doing,\nwe allow the regressors to be stochastic and disturbances to be heavy-tailed with\neither finite or infinite variances, where the tail-thickness parameters of the\nregressors and disturbances may be different. Furthermore, using simulation and\nresponse-surface methods we investigate the properties of the estimator.\nBoth the convergence rate and the asymptotic distributions of the estimator turn\nout to be a function of  of the regressors and the disturbances. A simulation\nresult shows that the asymptotic distributions are only a rough approximation for\nfinite samples.\nContents\n2 Rate of convergence and the limiting distribution\nfor the regression coefficient estimator 3\n3 Summary of different scenarios 23\n5 Limiting and finite-sample distributions of n under Scenario 5 35\n1 Introduction\nFor the estimation of the coefficients of a regression model one typically applies ordi-\nnary least squares (OLS), which is equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimation\nif the disturbances are normally distributed. Furthermore, according to the Gauss-\nMarkov theorem, the OLS estimator has the minimum variance of all linear unbiased\nestimators if the disturbances follow a distribution with finite variance. However, if\nthe disturbances follow a distribution with infinite variance, but with finite mean, the\nOLS estimator is still unbiased but no longer a minimum variance estimator.\nRelaxing the normality assumption by allowing disturbances to have a symmetric\n-stable distribution with infinite variance (1 <  < 2), Blattberg et al (1971) gen-\neralize the OLS estimator to a different linear unbiased estimator that minimizes the\n-stable scale of the estimator. That generalization is performed in the framework of\na regression model in which the independent variable is assumed to be non-stochastic.\nWe consider both the rate of convergence to the true value and the asymptotic\ndistribution of the normalized error of the linear unbiased estimators of coefficients in\nthe regression model with both stochastic regressors and disturbances being heavy-\ntailed with either finite or infinite variances,1 and the tail-thickness parameters of the\nregressors and disturbances may be different. Even though our distributional assump-\ntions are more general than the assumptions of -stability, the limiting distributions\nof the estimators will often be expressed through stable random variables.\nFor any random variable X there is a number   (0, 2] satisfying C = A +B.\nExponent  is called the stability parameter. A random variable with exponent  is\nsaid to be -stable distributed. Closed-form expressions of -stable distributions exist\nonly for a few special cases. However, the logarithm of the characteristic function of\nthe -stable distribution can be written as (see Zolotarev (1986) and Samorodnitsky\net al (1994) for more details on -stable distributions)\nln (t)=\n\n\n\n\n\n-|t|[1 - i sign(t)tan\n] + i\u00b5t, for  = 1,\n-|t|[1 + i \nsign(t) ln |t|] + i\u00b5t, for  = 1,\nwhere  is the stability parameter (or tail-thickness parameter );  is the scale pa-\n1There is some controversy on whether the variance of financial returns is always infinite. We\navoid this controversy by using a heavy-tailed model that allows for both finite or infinite variance.\nrameter;   [-1 1] is the skewness parameter; and \u00b5 is the location parameter. If \n= 0, the distribution is symmetric. The shape of the symmetric -stable distribution\n(SS) is determined by the tail-thickness parameter   (0, 2]. For 0 <  < 2 the\ntails of the distribution are thicker than those of the normal distribution; and the\ntail-thickness increases as  decreases. When  = 2, the SS distribution coincides\nwith the normal distribution with variance 22, the only member of the family with\nfinite variance. When  = 1, the SS distribution reduces to the Cauchy distribu-\ntion. If  < 2, moments of order  or higher do not exist, which means the variance\nis infinite. If X is an -stable random variable, 0 <  < 2, with scale , skewness ,\nand location \u00b5, then a common notation is X  S\n(, , \u00b5). In that case the tails of\nX are given by\nP(\u00b1X > )  C\nas   , where\nC\n=\n\nx- sin x dx\nSome more basic information and notation on stable random variables we use,\nunless otherwise specified, can be found in Samorodnitsky et al (1994).\nOne distinct example for a possible application of our results in the paper can\nbe found in financial market analysis. For econometric analysis of a dynamic capital\nasset pricing model, it is necessary to add an assumption concerning the distributional\nbehavior of stock returns. Since Bachelier (1900) the traditional and most widely\nadopted distributional assumption on financial return process has been the Gaussian\nhowever, the -stable distributions with 0 <  < 2 have often been considered to\nbe a more realistic distribution assumption for asset returns than that of a normal\ndistribution, because asset returns are typically fat\u00adtailed and excessively peaked\naround zero--phenomena that can be captured by -stable distributions with  < 2.\nThis is the so-called stable Paretian assumption. In a certain sense the stable Paretian\nassumption is a generalization rather than an alternative to the Gaussian assumption.\nIndeed, according to the generalized central limit theorem, the limiting distribution\nof the sum of a large number of independent, identically distributed (iid) random\nvariables is -stable with 0 <   2; see Zolotarev (1986). For more applications of\nthe -stable distributions in economics and finance; see Rachev et al (1999), Rachev\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present our new\nestimator and analyze the asymptotic distribution of the estimator. Section 3 summa-\nrizes various scenarios by the different  for regressors and disturbances. In Section\n4 we discuss the choice of the optimal  in the new estimator both analytically and\nnumerically. In Section 5, using simulation and response surface analysis, we present\nboth the limiting and finite-sample distributions of our new estimator. Section 6\ncontains some concluding remarks.\n2 Rate of convergence and the limiting distribu-\ntion for the regression coefficient estimator\nConsider a simple regression model like the one below.\nYj\n= Xj\n+ Uj\nWe assume that the regressors {Xj\n} are iid random variables with polynomially\ndecaying tails. Specifically,\n-x ,   , some x\nFurthermore, we assume that the noise (disturbances) {Uj\n} are also iid random vari-\nables, which we assume to be symmetric, with\n-u ,   , some u\nWe assume, further, that the sequences {Xj\n} and {Uj\n} are independent.\nNote that no assumptions on the symmetry of either dependent observations or\nregressors are made. We remark, further, that it is relatively straightforward (at\nleast, away from the boundary cases) to extend the results below to the case where\nthe tails of the regressors and noise variables are regularly varying (ie adding slowly\nvarying factors in (4) and (5)). Since such slowly varying functions are not practically\nobservable, we decided against including extra technical arguments in an already\nhighly technical paper. Finally, we allow values of x\nand u\nin the interval (0, 1] as\nwell, since our methods cover those cases equally well.\nThe goal is to estimate the regression coefficient  in (3), and our estimator is\n^\n,n\n=\nn\nj\nYj\nn\n|Xj\nfor some  > 1 with < \u00b7 > defined as a signed power.2 Note that the OLS estimator\ncorresponds to  = 2 in (6).\nOur immediate task is to understand the behavior of the difference\nn\n:= ^\n,n\n-  =\nn\nj\nUj\nn\n|Xj\nd\n=\nn\n|Xj\nn\n|Xj\n,\nwhere the last distributional equality follows from the symmetry of the noise. That\nis, we are interested in the rate of convergence of the estimator ^\n,n\nto the true value\ndepending on the choice of . When such convergence actually takes place, this will\nalso establish consistency (in probability) of our estimator.\nIt is clear that the rate of convergence to zero of the difference n\ndepends signif-\nicantly on the tail exponents x\nand u\n, and on the choice of . What is interesting\nis that we will see below that there are basically 7 different cases of possible values\nof x\nand u\n, in each of which the rate of convergence is a different function of .\nA common feature of our results will be the existence of an exponent d such that\nndn\n W as n   (8)\nfor some non-degenerate weak limit W. Occasionally, on certain boundaries we will\nhave to modify (8) to allow for a slowly varying factor in the left-hand side. That is,\nwe will have\nndL(n) n\n W as n   (9)\nwhere L is a slowly varying function.3 In any case we will view the exponent d in\neither (8) or (9) as measuring the rate of convergence. In particular, the exponent d\n3L(x) is a slowly varying function as x  , if for every constant c > 0 and limx\nL(cx)\nL(x)\nexists\nand is equal to 1.\nturns out to be a different function of  in the 7 different cases of possible values of\nx\nand u\nwe mentioned above.\nThe reader will find it easier to follow the different technical detail below after\nnoticing the existence of several critical boundaries. The first boundary is that\n\nx\nNote that on one side of that boundary |Xj\n|/(-1) has a finite mean and hence the\ndenominator in (7) is governed by the law of large numbers (LLN). On the other side\nof that boundary |Xj\n|/(-1) is in the domain of attraction of a positive stable law\nand the corresponding heavy-tailed central limit theorem governs the behavior of the\ndenominator in (7). On the boundary itself, the mean is infinite, but the (weak) LLN\nis still in force.\nThe second critical boundary is that of\nmin ( - 1)x\n, u\nHere on one side of the boundary the random variables |Xj\nhave a finite\nvariance and hence the Gaussian central limit theorem (CLT) governs the behavior\nof the numerator in the second expression in (7). On the other side of that boundary\nthese random variables are in the domain of attraction of a symmetric stable non-\nGaussian law and hence the corresponding CLT will be responsible for the behavior\nof the numerator. On the boundary itself the variance is infinite, but the CLT will\nstill be in force.\nWe now proceed to consider the different ranges of x\nand u\nmentioned above.\nScenario 1 Suppose that\nNote that under this scenario (10) fails independently of . Consider, therefore, the\nsecond part of the critical boundary (11)\n 2 or, equivalently,  \nx\nWe will see that, in this case, the exponent d governing the rate of convergence of n\nto zero in (8) or (9) is given by\nd =\nConsider first the non-boundary case\nu\n> 2 and  >\nx\nThen, we claim that the following version of (8)\nndn\n\nC-/((-1)x)\n\nholds weakly, where N(0, 1) and S(-1)x\n\n(1, 1, 0) in the right-hand side above are\nindependent. Furthermore, D1\nis the constant in the tail in (4). See the end of the\nprevious section for the description of the constant C\nas well as for other basic information on stable random variables.\nIndeed, in this case,\nndn\n=\n|Xj\nn\n|Xj\nLet  > 0, and\nKn\n() = {j = 1, 2, . . . , n : |Xj\nNote that\nkn\n() := Card(Kn\n())  I\nweakly, where I\nPoiss(\u00b5) stands for a Poisson random variable with mean \u00b5.\nWrite (by giving names to the numerator and denominator in the right hand side\nndn\n=\nand let\n^\nNn\nn\n| ^\nXj\n^\nDn\n= n-/(-1)x\njKn()\n|Xj\nwhere\n^\nXj\n=\n\n\n\n\n\nXj\n, if j = {1, 2, . . . , n} \\ Kn\n()\n~\nXj\n, if j  Kn\n().\nXj\n} is an iid sequence with a common law I\nP(Xj\n \u00b7 | |Xj\n|  n1/x ), and\nindependent of the sequences {Xj\n} and {Uj\n}.\nNote that ^\nNn\nand ^\nDn\nare independent.

In particular, from the plots in the previous section we know that d() is a non-\nincreasing function of  in Scenarios 1 through 5, and a non-decreasing function of \nin Scenarios 6 and 7.\nWhat  do we choose if the x\nand u\nare unknown or rather we do not know\nthem precisely? This is a common situation since the precision of even the best non-\nparametric estimators of the tail exponents is not very high; see eg Embrechts et al\nClearly, the tighter bounds on x\nand u\nwe have, the easier it is to select a good\n. In this section we will consider several possible situations. The reader is invited to\nconsider additional possibilities. We will only consider the cases x\nhere, as those are of relevance in empirical analysis.\nSuppose first that we know that\nx\nThen the choice of\nalways leads to the highest possible rate of decay of n\n, ie the highest possible d.\nIndeed, if x\n 2, then Scenario 4 is in force (the boundary case x\n= 1 does not\ndistinguish between Scenarios 1 and 4), and, since\nx\nx\nwe obtain the optimal d = 1/x\n. On the other hand, if x\n> 2, then Scenario 6 is in\nforce, and since\nx\nx\nwe obtain the optimal d = 1/2.\nOn the other hand, suppose we know that\nThen any choice of\nalways leads to the highest possible rate of decay of n\n(highest possible d). Indeed,\nScenario 5 is in force and\nu\nx\n ,\nand we obtain the highest possible value of d = 1/x\n.\nNote that in the above cases, and with the choice of  we are recommending, we\nwill always have d  1/2.\nUnfortunately, in the range 1  u\ncan be bigger than 2, no such\nefficiency is possible.\nTo measure the relative efficiency of a given choice of , let us introduce the\nnotation\nR(; x\n, u\n) =\nd(; x\n, u\n)\nd(x\n, u\n)\nwhere d(; x\n, u\n) is the value of d corresponding to , x\n, u\nand\nd(x\n, u\n) = max\nd(; x\n, u\nFor a set A of (x\n, u\n) let\nA\n() = inf\n(x,u)A\nR(; x\n, u\nbe the worst efficiency of a given choice of . We may then look for a maxmin value\nA\nsuch that\nA\n(A\n) = max\ninf\n(x,u)A\nR(; x\n, u\n) := RA\nIndeed, for a given  > 1, choose x\nso large that x\n/(x\n- 1) <  and let u\nThen we will be eventually within Scenario 5, and\nR(; x\n, u\n) =\nHence A\n() = 0 for all  > 1, and so RA\n= 0, as claimed.\nIf, however, x\ncannot be arbitrarily large, then things are better.\nLet  > 2, and\nThen any  in the range\nis a A\n. Furthermore,\nRA\n=\n\nTo prove this, consider first the range\n >\n\n.\nHere, as in the case A = (2, ) \u00d7 (1, 2), we see that A\n() = 0. Next, we consider\nthe range\n\n<  \n\nNote that\ninf\n(x,u)\u00d7A\nR(; x\n, u\n) =\n\nand is achieved when x\n , u\n 1. On the other hand,\ninf\n(x,u)\u00d7A\nR(; x\n, u\n) =\n\nand is achieved when x\n , u\nA\n() = min\n\n- ,\n\n=\n\nx\nx\n- x\n+ 2). Furthermore, A\nx\n+\nx\n- x\nSimilarly in the range\n\nwe obtain, in a similar way, that\nA\n() =\n\nTherefore, both (147) and (148) follow. In this situation we can guarantee d  2/()2\nwith the choice of  recommended above.\nThe above discussion of the ways to select the parameter  focuses on the rate of\nconvergence to the true value, which is, clearly, the single most important criterion.\nWith the rate of convergence kept fixed, however, other things become important.\nAmong them is the spread of the limiting distribution. To compare such spreads and,\nhence, to be able to tell more about good ways to select , we performed a simulations\nstudy.\nDesign of simulation. From the viewpoint of empirical evidence, we consider\nx\n [1, 2). To implement data-generating processes, we have selected\nx\n, u\nfrom Scenario 5. We use a length of quantile 0.975\nas a spread measure,\nwhere p\nis the pth quantile of the simulated distribution of (7).5 According to the\nrecommendation in (141), we use   (1, 1.5]. For implementation we have selected \nfor each estimate, 10,000 replications were made. Figure 9 shows the  minimizing\nthe spread for selected x\n, u\nand sample sizes.\nThe selected  shows noticeable irregularity, even for large samples. Nevertheless,\nsome useful rules for choosing the  can be formulated as\n =\n\n\n\n\n\nu\nif u\nHere, the parameter u\nplays a key role, while the role of x\nand the sample size seem\nto be less important.\n4In order to better see the behavior of the estimates near the boundary points 1 and 2, a more\ndetailed selection was used in another simulation. The results show that the transition from 1 to\nnumbers bigger than 1 (1.01 and 1.05 were additionally chosen in the simulation) and from 2 to\n5The results are very robust against taking other quantiles and other spread measure such as\nvariation; see Samorodnitsky and Taqqu (1994, Ch 2) for an explanation of the variation.\n\nx\n\nu\n\n\nx\n\nu\n\n\nx\n\nu\n\n\nx\n\nu\n\n\nx\n\nu\n\n\nx\n\nu\n\n\nx\n\nu\n\n\nx\n\nu\n\n\nx\nn=\n\nu\n\nFigure 9:  for selected x\nand u\n5 Limiting and finite-sample distributions of n\nunder Scenario 5\nIn this section we consider the most interesting scenario in practice, Scenario 5. Since\nthe limiting distribution in (51) is a non-standard one, we perform simulations and\nresponse surface analysis and give both the limiting distributions by given x\nand u\n,\nand finite-sample distributions.\n5.1 Limiting distributions of n\nThe behavior of the limiting distribution in (51) based on Scenario 5 is numerically\nanalyzed. Figure 10 shows simulated limiting distributions for selected x\nand u\n.\nFor this simulation we used  according to the choice rule described above.\nA comparison of the limiting distributions for various x\nand u\nshows that they\nbecome more dispersed if u\ndecreases or x\n= 1.5. For the spread of the\nlimiting distributions, x\nplays a more important role than u\n.\n\nx\nu\n\nx\nu\n\nx\nu\n\nx\nu\n\nx\nu\n\nx\nu\n\nx\nu\n\nx\nu\n\nx\nu\nFigure 10: Simulated limiting distributions for selected x\nand u\nRather than simply tabulating critical values for a few selected sample sizes, x\n\u00ad\nvalues and u\n\u00advalues, we employ response surface techniques to present our simu-\nlation results in a compact fashion. In addition, this approach allows us to derive\napproximate critical values for wide ranges of x\n\u00ad and u\n\u00advalues and facilitates com-\nputational implementation. Response surface methodology has been used in various\nstatistical and econometric applications (see Myers et al 1989).\nResponse surface analysis was applied to approximate selected quantiles of the\nlimiting distributions n\nfor the fitting of a response surface, on the 175 (x\n, u\n, q)\u00adcombinations considered.\nFor the surface a functional form was specified, a high\u00adorder polynomial in x\n, u\nand q. Specifically, we estimated\n(x\n, u\n, q) =\nah,i,j\nx\nu\n,\nx\n, u\nTo derive the approximate response surface, we selected the subset of regressors which\nmaximized the adjusted\u00adR2 value. To take possible heterogeneity of the approxima-\ntion error ,x,u,q\ninto account, the generalized least squares method was used for\nestimation, although there did not seem to be systematic heterogeneity due to varia-\ntions of the characteristic exponent . The estimation results are reported in Table 1.\nEstimated coefficients (ahij\n) in the response surface functiona\naThe estimates are multiplied by 106. t-values are given in brackets.\n\nmean |^\nthe absolute goodness of fit deteriorates as the significance level decreases, especially\nwhen x\nand u\n6The negligibility of the constant terms justifies the use of the adjusted\u00adR2 value for selecting\nthe regressor subset. Its use would be inappropriate if the zero restrictions on the constant terms\ndid not hold.\n7To obtain better response surface approximations, simulations with additional intermediate val-\nues for x and u could have been conducted. However, the surfaces turn out to be rather smooth\nwith respect to both variables, which means additional simulations would have led to only negligible\nimprovements in the response surface approximations. Selected comparisons between simulations\nwith intermediate (x\n, u)\u00adcombinations and corresponding response surface approximations sup-\nport this conclusion.\n5.2 Finite-sample distributions of n\nTo examine the finite-sample behavior of n\n, we simulated samples of length n = 50,\nand disturbances\nut\nwere drawn from symmetric standard stable Paretian distributions (ie c = 1 and\n = 0) with the characteristic exponent x\nand u\n1.99,  having been chosen by the rule in the previous subsection. For each of the\n, u\n, n)\u00adcombinations, 10,000 replications with the same seed were\ngenerated with the algorithm of Weron (1996) as a modified version of Chambers et\nOverall properties of the distributions for finite samples with respect to x\nand\nu\nare similar to those of the limiting distributions. For supplying critical values for\nfinite samples, response surface analysis was again applied to approximate selected\nquantiles of n\ngenerated from the 10,000 replications. Specifically, we focused on\nthe 1, 5 and 10% critical values and, hence, for the fitting of a response surface\n, u\n, q)\u00adcombinations considered. For the surface a functional form\nwas specified, a high\u00adorder polynomial in n, x\nand u\naccompanied by quantiles.\nSpecifically, we estimated the following regression and the estimated coefficients of\nthe response surface regression are summarized in Table 2.\n(n, x\n, u\n, q) =\nah,i,j\nx\nu\n,\n, u\n\nmean |^\n| = 0.7816 indicate adequate fits. As expected, the\nabsolute goodness of fit deteriorates as the significance level decreases, especially\nwhen x\nand u\napproach 2.\nNext, we use a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to check how close the finite-sample dis-\ntributions of n\nare to the limiting distributions. Figure 11 shows the QQ plots of the\nempirically estimated distributions Fn\nagainst the limiting distribution F0\n8This algorithm is analytically identical with the widely used stable random number generator\nwritten by J.H. McCulloch which is available on McCulloch's website: http://economics.sbs.ohio-\nstate.edu/jhm/jhm.html\nEstimated coefficients (ahij\n) in the response surface function\ntribution. The empirical values of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test statistic:\nsup\nx\n|Fn\nare obtained by taking the largest deviations from the dotted line.\nFigure 11: Simulated limiting distributions for selected x\n\nn. As is\nclearly shown in Figure 11, the finite-sample distributions differ significantly from\nthe limiting distributions even at n = 10, 000. For all cases the null hypothesis\nthat Fn\ncannot be accepted. For various x\nand u\nthe KS test shows the\nsame result. This means that for empirical work the limiting distributions is only a\npoor approximation of the finite sample distributions, which means we need tables of\ncritical (quantile) values of each combination of (x\n, u\n) for a range of sample sizes\nn.\n6 Concluding remarks\nOne can see that blindly using the OLS approach  = 2 can lead to very inefficient\nestimators of the regression coefficient. A much better approach is to take the tails\ninto account. Even if the tails of the regressors and disturbances are known only\napproximately, this can still provide valuable information for selecting a good value of\n and, hence, constructing a more efficient estimator. Iterated procedures in which the\ntails and the regression coefficient are estimated simultaneously should be considered.\nJeong-Ryeol Kurz-Kim\nemail: jeong-ryeol.kurz-kim@bundesbank.de\nDeutsche Bundesbank\nSvetlozar T.
