Most temporally primary (based on retro-\nspective age-of-onset reports) fear/anger, distress, dis-\nruptive behavior, and substance disorders significantly\npredict elevated odds of subsequent suicidal behaviors\nin bivariate models. The most consistently significant as-\nsociations of these disorders are with suicide ideation,\nalthough a number of disorders are also predictors of plans\nand both planned and unplanned attempts among ide-\nators. Most suicidal adolescents (80%) receive some\nform of mental health treatment. In most cases (55%),\ntreatment starts prior to onset of suicidal behaviors but\nfails to prevent these behaviors from occurring.\nConclusions: Suicidal behaviors are common among US\nadolescents, with rates that approach those of adults. The\nvast majority of youth with suicidal behaviors have pre-\nexisting mental disorders. The disorders most power-\nfully predicting ideation, though, are different from those\nmost powerfully predicting conditional transitions from\nideation to plans and attempts. These differences sug-\ngest that distinct prediction and prevention strategies are\nneeded for ideation, plans among ideators, planned at-\ntempts, and unplanned attempts.\namong the leading causes of\ndeath worldwide, especially\namong adolescents and\nyoung adults.1-4 Despite the\nscope and seriousness of the problem, rela-\ntively little is known about the preva-\nlence, correlates, or treatment of suicidal\nbehavior (ie, suicide ideation, plans, and\nattempts) among US adolescents because\nnationally representative studies of this\nproblem are rare. Although some prior\nstudies have reported on these aspects of\nadolescent suicidal behavior5-8 and\ndeath,9-11 virtually all of them were based\non small regional samples, limiting the\ngenerality of findings and precluding fine-\ngrained analyses. Comprehensive na-\ntional data on suicidal behavior among\nadolescents are needed to improve our\nunderstanding of the nature of this per-\nplexing and devastating problem, to arm\nclinicians with information about risk\nprofiles, and to help inform decisions about\npromising prevention targets.\nCME available online at\njamanetworkcme.com\nAuthor Aff\nDepartmen\nHarvard Un\n(Dr Nock),\nEducation,\n(Dr Green)\nHealth Care\nMedical Sch\nSampson, a\nand Kessler\nGeneral Ped\nHospital Bo\nMedical Sch\nMcLaughlin\nAuthor Affiliations:\nDepartment of Psychology,\nHarvard University, Cambridge\n(Dr Nock), School of\nEducation, Boston University\n(Dr Green), Department of\nHealth Care Policy, Harvard\nMedical School (Mr Hwang,\nMs Sampson, and Drs Zaslavsky\nand Kessler), and Division of\nGeneral Pediatrics, Children's\nHospital Boston, Harvard\nMedical School\n(Dr McLaughlin),\nMassachusetts.\n\u00a92013 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nOur report presents data on the epidemiology of ado-\nlescent nonlethal suicidal behaviors from the National\nComorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supple-\nment (NCS-A), the first national survey of US adoles-\ncents to assess a wide range of DSM-IV mental disorders\nand suicidal behaviors using fully-structured diagnostic\ninterviews. Several recent studies have reported on\nmonth prevalence and treatment of suicidal behav-\niors.19 Here, we present new data on lifetime prevalence\nand age at onset of suicidal behaviors, as well as infor-\nmation on correlations with temporally primary mental\ndisorders and treatment.\nMETHOD\nSAMPLE\nage at the time of selection, although some respondents turned\n18 years before their interview) in the continental United States\ncompleted in conjunction with the National Comorbidity Sur-\nvey Replication.20 The design and field procedures of this study\nare reported in detail elsewhere.12-15 The NCS-A used a dual-\nframe sample composed of (1) a household subsample of ado-\nlescents (n=904) selected from the National Comorbidity Sur-\nvey Replication households and (2) a school subsample of\nadolescents (n=9244) selected from schools (day and residen-\ntial schools of all types, with probabilities proportional to size)\nin the same nationally representative counties as those in the\nNational Comorbidity Survey Replication. The overall re-\nOne parent or parent surrogate (subsequently referred to as\n\"parents\") of each adolescent provided written informed con-\nsent, and the adolescents provided written informed assent be-\nfore adolescent interviews. Parents also completed self-\nadministeredquestionnairesabouttheadolescent'smentalhealth.\nThe self-administered questionnaire response rate was in the\nrange of 82.5% to 83.7% in the household-school samples. Our\nreport focuses on the 6483 adolescent-parent pairs with com-\nplete data. The use of this subsample reduces the precision of\nthe estimates compared with analyses based on the full sample,\nbut it eliminates the bias introduced by having missing parent\nreports on adolescent disorders.\nEach parent and adolescent was paid $50 for participating\nin the study. All study procedures were approved by the hu-\nman subjects committees of Harvard Medical School in Bos-\nton,Massachusetts,andtheUniversityofMichiganatAnnArbor.\nCompleted cases were weighted for within-household prob-\nability of selection (for the household subsample) and residual\ndiscrepancies between sample and population on demographic-\ngeographic variables. Weighting procedures are described\nelsewhere.12,13 Adolescents in the weighted NCS-A parent-\nadolescent sample are very similar to the population of US ado-\nlescents on a wide range of sociodemographic/geographic\nMEASURES\nSuicidal Behaviors\nSuicidal behaviors were assessed using a modified version of\nthe Suicidal Behavior Module of the Composite International\nDiagnostic Interview (CIDI).21,22 This module assesses the life-\ntime occurrence and age at onset of suicide ideation (\"You se-\nriously thought about killing yourself\") and, among respon-\ndents who reported lifetime ideation, suicide plans (\"You made\na plan for killing yourself\") and suicide attempts (\"You tried\nto kill yourself\"). To examine transitions among behaviors, we\nfocus on not only predictors of lifetime suicide attempts but\nalso predictors of lifetime suicide ideation, lifetime suicide plans\namong ideators, and lifetime attempts among ideators with and\nwithout a plan.\nDSM-IV Mental Disorders\nAll adolescents completed a modified version of the World\nHealth Organization CIDI, a fully-structured diagnostic inter-\nview administered by trained lay interviewers16,21 modified for\nadministration to adolescents.15 The disorders examined were\norganized into 4 broad categories based on the results of an ex-\nploratory factor analysis reported elsewhere23: fear and anger\ndisorders (panic disorder and/or agoraphobia, specific pho-\nbia, social phobia, and intermittent explosive disorder [IED]),\ndistress disorders (separation anxiety disorder [SAD], post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder and/or dys-\nthymia [MDD/DYS], and generalized anxiety disorder), dis-\nruptive behavior disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity\ndisorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and\neating disorders [including anorexia nervosa, bulimia ner-\nvosa, and binge-eating disorder]), and substance abuse (alco-\nhol and illicit drug abuse). We also assessed bipolar disorder\n(I or II). Parent reports were also obtained and were com-\nbined with adolescent reports to derive DSM-IV diagnoses for\nthe 4 disorders shown in prior research to benefit most from\ninclusion of parental reports: MDD/DYS, attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and con-\nduct disorder.24,25 Adolescent and parent reports were com-\nbined using an \"or\" rule at the symptom level. An NCS-A clinical\nreappraisal study14 showed good concordance between diag-\nnoses based on the CIDI and self-administered questionnaire\nand independent clinical diagnoses in a subsample of NCS-A\nparent-adolescent pairs based on blinded administration of the\nSchedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-\nAge Children, Present and Lifetime Version.14,26\nSociodemographic Variables\nA number of sociodemographic variables were assessed using\nthe CIDI: sex, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, Hispanic, or other), parental education (less\nthan a high school degree, a high school degree or General Edu-\ncation Development credential, some postsecondary educa-\ntion, or a college degree), birth order (first, last, and other),\nnumber of siblings (0, 1, 2, or 3), and number of biological\nparents living with the adolescent (0, 1, or 2). Information was\ncollected in the surveys to date the transitions in time-varying\nvariables (eg, respondent's age at birth of siblings and at pa-\nrental death or divorce), allowing us to redefine these vari-\nables for each year of the respondent's life as time-varying pre-\ndictors of onset of suicidality.\nTreatment\nLifetime history of treatment for emotional or behavioral prob-\nlems was assessed using questions from the Service Assess-\nment for Children and Adolescents.27,28 The entry question asked\nrespondents whether they (for adolescent self-reports) or their\nchild (for parent reports) ever \"received services\" for prob-\nlems with \"emotions or behavior\" or \"alcohol or drug use\" from\neach of 11 different types of professionals or settings.

Discrete-\ntime survival analysis, with person-year the unit of analysis and\na logistic link function, was used to examine associations of tem-\nporallyprimary(basedonretrospectiveage-at-onsetreports)men-\ntal disorders and subsequent first onset of suicidality.29 Time was\nmodeled as a separate dummy predictor variable for each year\noflifeuptoageatintervieworageatonsetoftheoutcome,which-\never came first. Survival coefficients and their standard errors\nwere exponentiated and reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95%\nCIs. The results of both bivariate and multivariate models are\nreported to provide information on both gross and net associa-\ntions of disorders with suicidal behaviors.\nMultivariate survival models either assumed additivity (in\npredicting logits) or included nonadditive associations among\ncomorbid mental disorders. The latter models included a sepa-\nrate dummy predictor variable for each disorder (\"type dum-\nmies\") and dummy predictor variables for number of disor-\nders (\"number dummies\"). Relative odds of suicidal behaviors\nassociated with a given comorbid cluster (compared with re-\nspondents with no disorders) correspond to the product of the\ntype dummies and the number dummy for the respondent's\nnumber of disorders. For example, the relative odds of sui-\ncidal behaviors among respondents with a given set of 3 co-\nmorbid disorders would be the product of the 3 ORs for those\nparticular disorders multiplied by the 3-disorder number\ndummy, where the latter was assumed to be constant for all\nrespondents with any combination of exactly 3 or more co-\nmorbid disorders. This means that the ORs associated with the\nnumber dummies can be interpreted as multiplicative devia-\ntions from the associations of comorbid disorder clusters with\nthe outcomes expected based on an additive model (ie, a model\nwith type dummies but no number dummies).30\nThe Taylor series method31 was used to estimate standard\nerrors in the SUDAAN software system,32 to adjust for sample\nweighting and clustering. Multivariate significance was exam-\nined using Wald 2 tests based on design-corrected coefficient\nvariance-covariance matrices. Statistical significance was con-\nsistently evaluated using 2-sided tests with an  level of .05.\nIndividually significant coefficients were interpreted only if the\nequation in which they were estimated was significant as a whole\nin a multivariate test, an approach that minimizes the problem\nof false positives due to multiple comparisons while avoiding\nthe problem of low power to detect true associations of mod-\nerate magnitude that is introduced by more conservative meth-\nods (eg, Bonferroni corrections).33 Model comparisons were\nmade using the Akaike information criterion.34\nRESULTS\nThe lifetime prevalences of suicide ideation, plans, and\n(Table 1).

All of these preva-\nlence estimates are higher among girls than boys, with\nthe exception of the proportion of ideators who go on to\ndevelop a plan and the proportion of attempts that are\nplanned vs unplanned.\nAge-at-onset curves show that the lifetime preva-\nlence of suicide ideation is very low (1%) through 10\nyears of age, then increases slowly through 12 years of\nage, and then more rapidly between 12 and 17 years of\nage (Figure 1). The prevalence of plans and attempts,\nin comparison, remains very low (1%) through 12\nyears of age, then increases in roughly linear fashion\nthrough 15 years of age, and then more slowly until 17\nyears of age. Speed-of-transition curves show that the\nvast majority of adolescent transitions from ideation to\noccur within the first year of onset of ideation\n(Figure 2). The vast majority (88.4%) of adolescent\ntransitions from plan to attempt occur within the year\nof developing the plan.\nTable 1.

Non-Hispanic blacks have sig-\nnificantly lower odds of attempts (OR = 0.3) than do\nnon-Hispanic whites, which can be traced to signifi-\ncantly lower odds of ideation (OR = 0.5) in conjunc-\ntion with insignificantly lower conditional odds of\nplans among ideators (OR = 0.7) and attempts among\nboth planners (OR = 0.4) and ideators without a plan\n(OR = 0.4). Hispanics and other race/ethnic groups, in\ncomparison, do not differ significantly from non-\nHispanic whites with regard to any of these odds.\nThe odds of an attempt are elevated among youths\nwith a parent who graduated from high school (OR = 2.0)\nor completed some college (OR = 3.0) compared\nwith those with a parent with either more (ie, college\ngraduates) or less (ie, did not graduate from high school)\neducation. These associations are due to significantly el-\nevated odds of ideation among respondents whose par-\nents have had some college education (OR = 1.4), non-\nsignificantly elevated conditional odds of a plan (OR = 1.9-\nrespondents whose parents completed high school or\nsome college, and elevated odds of an unplanned at-\ntempt (significant only for the offspring of parents\nwith some college education) in these 2 subsamples. Birth\norder and number of siblings are related only to one as-\npect of suicidality: significantly reduced odds of an un-\nplanned attempt among the youngest children and those\nwith 2 or more siblings (OR = 0.1). Finally, a significant\nrelationship exists between living with 0 (OR = 4.1) or\n1 parent (OR = 2.0) vs both biological parents and sui-\ncide attempt due to significantly elevated odds of ide-\nation (OR = 2.8-1.8) and, among youth living with no bio-\nlogical parents, of both planned (OR = 6.2) and unplanned\n(OR = 3.7) attempts.\nThe vast majority of adolescents with a lifetime history\nlifetime criteria for at least 1 of the 15 DSM-IV/CIDI dis-\norders considered (Table 3). The prevalence of each dis-\norder is elevated in virtually all subsamples of youths with\nsuicidal behaviors, with 78.7% of these differences sta-\ntistically significant at an  level of .05. The most preva-\nlent lifetime disorder among suicidal adolescents is MDD/\nDYS, followed by specific phobia, oppositional defiant\ndisorder, IED, substance abuse, and conduct disorder.\nThe prevalence of mental disorders generally increases\nwith increasing severity of suicidal behaviors (ie, sui-\ncide ideation  suicide plan  suicide attempt), al-\nthough SAD shows the opposite pattern.\nDiscrete-time survival analysis was used to examine as-\nsociations of temporally primary lifetime mental disor-\nders with the subsequent first onset of a suicide at-\ntempt. The results of bivariate models (ie, including only\none disorder at a time) suggest that 13 of the 15 lifetime\nDSM-IV disorders examined are associated with signifi-\ncantly elevated odds of a subsequent suicide attempt\n(Table 4). Panic/agoraphobia and SAD are the excep-\ntions. Significant ORs range from 4.5 to 7.4 for disrup-\ntive behavior disorders, from 4.1 to 12.3 for distress dis-\norders, from 2.8 to 4.8 for substance disorders, and from\n2.5 to 3.5 for fear/anger disorders.

The final\nmodel, constrained in this way, included the interactions\nof 3 disorders with plans: IED, SAD, and conduct disor-\nder. This model fits the data better than a model with no\ninteractions between disorders and plans (an Akaike in-\nformation criterion of 1041.9 for the model with interac-\ntions vs an Akaike information criterion of 1083.6 with-\nout interactions). Only half of the 12 disorders with the\nsame ORs predicting planned and unplanned attempts are\ngreater than 1.0, of which 2 are significant (OR = 2.5 for at-\ntention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and OR = 5.3 for eat-\ning disorders), and one other OR is significantly less than\n1.0 (OR = 0.3 for alcohol abuse). Two of the 3 disorders\nwith ORs that differ in predicting planned and un-\nplanned attempts are significant only in predicting planned\nattempts (OR = 4.2 for IED and OR = 0.1 for SAD).

Al-\nthough virtually all of the mental disorders examined were\npredictors of a suicide attempt in bivariate models, these\nassociations were largely explained by mental disorders\nas predictors of suicide ideation. Among adolescents with\nideation, only MDD/dysthymia predicted the develop-\nment of a suicide plan, and only a handful of disorders\nwere predictors of the transition from ideation to a sui-\ncide attempt (ie, MDD/dysthymia, eating disorders, at-\ntention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder\n[only for unplanned attempt] and IED [only for planned\nattempt]). These findings are consistent with recent find-\nings in epidemiological studies of adults, in which MDD\nemerged as the strongest predictor of suicidal thoughts\ncompared with disorders characterized by anxiety, agi-\ntation, and poor behavioral control, which were the stron-\ngest predictors of a suicide attempt among ideators.22,40\nSeveral of the findings raise questions that require fur-\nther study and theorizing. Our finding that IED is a pre-\ndictor of only planned, not unplanned, suicide attempts\nTable 5.

Models control for all the demographic variables from Table 2 and person-years (each year coded as a\ndichotomous dummy, starting from year 4). Time-varying disorders were not time-lagged (turns on the year of onset for the disorder).\nbA dummy predictor variable for having a plan was included in both models. In the model that merely controlled for plan, this was the only additional predictor,\nwhich means that it was implicitly assumed that the odds ratios of temporally primary disorders predicting a subsequent attempt were the same for planned and\nunplanned attempts. In the model that also included interactions, subgroup coding was used to estimate odds ratios of disorders separately with planned and\nunplanned attempts for the subset of disorders in which the difference between these 2 odds ratios was found to be statistically significant and stable.\ncSignificant at P.05, determined by a 2-sided test.\ndWith or without a history of dependence.\n\u00a92013 American Medical Association.

Nota-\nbly, though, we observed this same pattern in 2 prior stud-\nies,22,40 which suggests that it is not merely a chance find-\ning in the present study. Future research is needed to study\nthis association in more depth in the context of a broader\ninvestigation of the roles of impulsiveness and planning\nin suicidal behaviors. Another interesting finding was that\nSAD was associated with consistently low odds of all sub-\nsequent suicidal behaviors (and significantly so for\nplanned suicide attempts). Although speculative, it may\nbe that adolescents who fear leaving their parents are less\nlikely to act on suicidal thoughts and plans for fear of\nlosing them. Prior studies have found that anxiety dis-\norders protect against oppositional/aggressive behav-\nior.41 A similar process might exist for suicidal behav-\nior. Nevertheless, given the large number of coefficients\nexamined, the significant association of SAD with re-\nduced odds of a suicide attempt among planners should\nbe considered no more than provisional until replicated\nin independent samples.\nSeveral aspects of the results regarding treatment are\nespecially noteworthy. The fact that most suicidal ado-\nlescents who receive treatment see a mental health spe-\ncialist suggests that these adolescents are getting access\nto those most qualified to treat them. In addition, the fact\nthat the proportion of adolescents in treatment in-\ncreases with severity (ie, from ideation to having a plan\nto attempting suicide) implies that the treatment sys-\ntem is responsive to variation in severity. However, it is\nnoteworthy that suicidal adolescents typically enter treat-\nment before rather than after the onset of suicidal be-\nhaviors. This means that mental health professionals are\nnot simply meeting with adolescents in response to their\nsuicidal thoughts or behaviors, but that adolescents who\nare clinically severe enough to become suicidal more typi-\ncally enter treatment before the onset of suicidal behav-\niors. There is no way to know from the NCS-A data how\noften this early intervention prevents the occurrence of\nsuicidal behaviors that would otherwise have occurred\nbut were not observed in our data. It is clear, though, that\nTable 6.

This finding is consistent with recent data high-\nlighting the difficulty of reducing suicidal thoughts and\nbehaviors among adolescents.42 We are unaware of any\nprior epidemiologic data on the lifetime treatment of sui-\ncidal adolescents, so there is no basis for comparison of\nour findings with those of previous studies. However, a\nrecent report found that the rate of 12-month treatment\nof adults with suicidal behavior in 21 countries aver-\naged 40% and was higher in the United States\nserved in the present study than in these adult studies\nreflects the fact that we examined lifetime treatment rather\nthan 12-month treatment and that the prevalence of men-\ntal disorders among those with suicidal behaviors, which\nis associated with increased probability of treatment,45\nwas higher in the NCS-A than in the other studies.\nThese findings should be interpreted in light of several\nlimitations. First, the results are based on retrospective\nself-reports that may be subject to recall bias. Second, men-\ntal disorders were assessed with a fully-structured in-\nstrument rather than by clinical assessment, although this\nlimitation is tempered somewhat by the good concor-\ndance between survey diagnoses and blinded clinical\ndiagnoses.14 Third, several disorders known to be asso-\nciated with suicidal behavior were not examined (eg,\nschizophrenia and personality disorders). Fourth, some\nof the disorders that were found to be significant are likely\nto have been false positives owing to the large number of\ntests performed. Consequently, regarding these associa-\ntions, it is important to consider the results to be provi-\nsional until they are replicated. Fifth, we examined only\na limited set of predictors. For example, we did not con-\nsider health risk behaviors, protective factors, or family-\ncommunity predictors. Sixth, we focused only on onset\nof suicidal behaviors and did not examine either severity\nor persistence or inquire specifically about intent to die.\nSeventh, we did not validate reports of treatment, nor did\nwe examine the adequacy of treatment. These limita-\ntions notwithstanding, our study provides valuable new\ninformation about suicidal behaviors among adoles-\ncents. The results point to the need for future work to\nincrease our understanding of the dramatic increase in\nsuicidal behaviors during adolescence, of the causal path-\nways linking child-adolescent mental disorders to ado-\nlescent suicidal behaviors, and of actionable strategies for\nclinical prediction and prevention of these behaviors.\nCorrespondence: Matthew K.
