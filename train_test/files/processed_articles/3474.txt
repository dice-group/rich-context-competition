People on\nthe autism spectrum are conceptualized here as ecologically competent individuals that\ncould have been adept at learning and implementing hunting and gathering skills in the\nancestral environment. Upon independence from their mothers, individuals on the autism\nspectrum may have been psychologically predisposed toward a different life-history\nstrategy, common among mammals and even some primates, to hunt and gather primarily\non their own. Many of the behavioral and cognitive tendencies that autistic individuals\nexhibit are viewed here as adaptations that would have complemented a solitary lifestyle.\nFor example, the obsessive, repetitive and systemizing tendencies in autism, which can be\nmistakenly applied toward activities such as block stacking today, may have been focused\nby hunger and thirst toward successful food procurement in the ancestral past. Both solitary\nmammals and autistic individuals are low on measures of gregariousness, socialization,\ndirect gazing, eye contact, facial expression, facial recognition, emotional engagement,\naffiliative need and other social behaviors. The evolution of the neurological tendencies in\nsolitary species that predispose them toward being introverted and reclusive may hold\nimportant clues for the evolution of the autism spectrum and the natural selection of autism\ngenes. Solitary animals are thought to eschew unnecessary social contact as part of a\nforaging strategy often due to scarcity and wide dispersal of food in their native\nenvironments. It is thought that the human ancestral environment was often nutritionally\nsparse as well, and this may have driven human parties to periodically disband.\nInconsistencies in group size must have led to inconsistencies in the manner in which\nnatural selection fashioned the social minds of humans, which in turn may well be\nresponsible for the large variation in social abilities seen in human populations. This article\nemphasizes that individuals on the autism spectrum may have only been partially solitary,\nthat natural selection may have only favored subclinical autistic traits and that the most\nsevere cases of autism may be due to assortative mating.\nThe solitary forager hypothesis\n",

People with autism largely withdraw\nfrom social contact and become absorbed in private worlds of obsessive interests and\nrepetitious activities (Kelly, Garnett, Attwood, and Peterson, 2008). Autism has been\nshown to be highly heritable and has been associated with a number of both genetic and\nenvironmental risk factors (Cantor, 2009). It is thought that the genes associated with\nautism create very selective abnormalities that tend to affect brain regions associated with\nsocial cognition (Amaral, Schumann, and Nordahl, 2008). Unfortunately, the genetics,\nmolecular biology and neuroscience of autism are still, relative to many other neurological\ndisorders, shrouded with uncertainty due to their highly complex nature (O'Roak and State,\nA portion of this complexity and uncertainty arises from the relatively large number\nof distinct susceptibility genes that have been identified, many of which can be completely\nabsent even in pronounced autism (Freitag, 2007). This genetic heterogeneity may be\nresponsible for the clinical heterogeneity, which ranges from debilitating social deficits to\nminor personality traits (Caronna, Milunsky, and Tager-Flusberg, 2008). Medical science\nrecognizes certain phenotypes that are thought to lie on a continuum often referred to as the\nautism spectrum disorders (ASD). Of these disorders, the DSM recognizes: autistic\ndisorder (Kanner's autism), childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental\ndisorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS, or atypical autism) (Piven, 2000). Autistic\ndisorder itself has also been broken into 4 subgroups: Asperger syndrome the highest-\nfunctioning form (Asperger, 1944; Frith, 1991), autism, high-functioning and low-\nfunctioning autism (Kanner, 1943; Baron-Cohen, 2006). Geneticists report that although\nthe clinical distinctions do not map neatly onto specific genes or patterns of genes, lower\nfunctioning individuals may have a higher total number of susceptibility alleles (Abrahams\nand Geschwind, 2008). For this reason this article will not make evolutionary distinctions\nbetween individual autistic disorders but will focus on the autism spectrum and the range of\nrelated genes as a whole.\nA number of very different theories about the causes of autism have attempted to\nexplain the scattered facts. It has been difficult for theorists to create a grand synthesis, and\nautism has been reconceptualized many times. At one point, it was thought that autistic\nchildren were purely a result of poor parenting, an idea that was once widely embraced but\nis now utterly rejected (Baron-Cohen and Bolton, 1993). Autism is now known to be a\nbiological phenomenon in which a genetic diathesis or susceptibility may interact with\nearly environmental circumstances to determine the severity of outcome (Kumar and\nChristian, 2009). However, why this genetic susceptibility to autism is so prevalent and\nhow the genes persisted despite the perceived negative effects is unclear. It is the author's\nThe solitary forager hypothesis\nview that conceptualizing autism in terms of evolutionary biology will offer insight into the\nunderlying factors, and help to make sense out of its seemingly incongruous characteristics.\nThe risk of developing autism approaches .5 percent in the general population,\nmaking it a highly prevalent \"disorder\" from an evolutionary perspective (Gluckman,\nBeedle, and Hanson, 2009). In the past two decades alone, the incidence of ASD has\nheightened attention by the medical community as well as the broadening of diagnostic\ncriteria (King and Bearman, 2009; Fombonne, 2009). Disorders, like autism, that are so\nprevalent that they exceed common mutation rates are thought to have persisted because\nthe genes responsible for them conferred some advantage in the ancestral environment\n(Nesse and Williams, 1998). To fully understand the evolutionary provenance of such a\nsyndrome it is important to attain a rough date of its origins in natural history.\nFor years autism was thought to be a disorder that affected Caucasians exclusively.\nIf this had in fact been the case, an evolutionary explanation would have to explain why\nautism originated and spread in Europe over the last 20 to 40 thousand years. It is now\nknown, however, that autism affects all human populations (Szatmari and Goldberg, 2000).\nIn fact, autism presents with very similar prevalence rates, worldwide, in all studied races\nand ethnic groups (Fombonne, 2002) and has only a very moderate association with\nimmigrant status or socioeconomic status (Morrier, Hess, and Heflin, 2008). That autism\nhas similar prevalence in all studied ethnic groups strongly suggests that it existed in a fully\ndeveloped form well before the first humans left Africa. Autism and the autism spectrum\nappear to be very ancient, yet how were the responsible genes selected and maintained over\ntens or perhaps hundreds of millennia?\nThis article will delineate the \"solitary forager\" hypothesis of autism which\nproposes that some genes contributing to autism were selected and maintained because they\nfacilitated solitary subsistence. Population dispersion, band fission or dissolution,\nestrangement, ostracism, and separation were probably infrequent but unavoidably\nreoccurring conditions that may have impacted the human genome during evolution.\nIndividuals on the autism spectrum are described here as having had the potential to be\nself-sufficient and capable foragers in scenarios marked by diminished social contact. In\nother words, these individuals, unlike neurotypical humans, would not have been obligately\nsocial and may have been predisposed toward taking up a relatively solitary lifestyle.\nCommon psychological characteristics of autism are taken here as a suite of cognitive\nadaptations that would have facilitated lone foraging. Like other solitary mammals with\nsimilar cognitive adaptations, they were probably not completely solitary; rather, they may\nhave done much of their foraging alone and reconvened intermittently with familiar\nindividuals. The article will use the perspectives from evolutionary medicine and\nevolutionary psychopathology to expound upon this hypothesis in a conjectural and\nexploratory manner. Corroborating evidence is sought from evolutionary medicine, the\nsystemizing theory of autism, anthropology, primatology and comparative neuroscience.\nAutism and Evolutionary Medicine\nThe solitary forager hypothesis\nMany medical conditions that are pathological in the present are known to have\nbeen adaptive in the ancestral environment, and the science of evolutionary medicine is\nconcerned with identifying and understanding these conditions (Williams and Nesse, 1991).\nIt is thought that evolutionary perspectives on disease can elucidate pathophysiology and\nultimately inform treatment strategy (Gluckman et al., 2009). The accomplishments of\nevolutionary medicine in explaining disease in terms of adaptation to environment are\nextensive and have provided insights into the origins of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular\ndisease, cystic fibrosis, diabetes mellitus, obesity, sickle cell anemia and many others\n(Trevathan, 2007). Evolutionary medicine has also attempted to explain the origins of\ncertain mental disorders. Several well-received theories have been formulated based on\nthese attempts and they may lend perspective to the natural history of autism.\nThe growing fields of evolutionary psychopathology (Nesse, 1999; Baron-Cohen,\napplication of evolutionary rationale to the understanding of psychological and psychiatric\ndisorders. Researchers in these domains have concluded that there were multiple,\nalternative cognitive strategies used to deal with the problems and obstacles that recurred in\nour evolutionary past (Cosmides and Tooby, 1992). Furthermore, they have emphasized\nthat individual differences in developmental patterns may not always represent the effects\nof idiosyncratic life experiences, but in fact represent biological, naturally selected\nresponses to pressing environmental concerns (Bjorklund and Pellegrini, 2000; Hood and\nA number of sensible evolutionary theories of autism have been put forth. Autism\nhas been conceptualized as a low-fitness extreme of a parentally-selected fitness indicator\n(Shaner, Miller, and Mintz, 2008). The authors have advanced that variation in the ability\nto connect socially to ones parents, an adaptive trait, may have a maladaptive, extreme\nform that results in autism. Other researchers have envisioned autism as a consequence of\npaternally imprinted genes (Badcock and Crespi, 2006). This idea has been taken further\nand autistic-like traits have been envisioned as constituting a male-typical strategy geared\ntoward parental investment, low-mating effort, high partner-specific investment and long-\nterm resource allocation (Del Giudice, Angeleri, Brizio, and Elena, 2010). These and other\ntheories of autism are well-supported and plausible. None of these are directly compatible\nwith the present hypothesis but neither are they directly contradictory. Like the present\nhypothesis they view autism as an extreme end of a continuum constituted by adaptive\ntraits. Unlike these though, the present hypothesis attempts to explain autism in terms of\nthe behavioral ecology of hunting and gathering.\nMany articles in the last two decades have attempted to utilize the perspective of\nbehavioral ecology to explain various forms of psychopathology (e.g., anxiety, addictive\npersonality, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, psychopathy and post-traumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD)). These articles have attempted to reconceptualize these disorders as\nadaptive, cognitive syndromes that, at one time, had ecological utility (Hood and Jenkins,\n2008; Reser, 2006). These articles have given thoughtful treatments to disorders such as:\nanxiety, hypothesized to represent a careful, cautious strategy (Marks and Nesse, 1994);\ndepression, a socially submissive strategy (Allen and Badcock, 2006); schizophrenia, a\ndefensive, vigilant and impulsive strategy (Reser, 2007); psychopathy, a socially selfish\nThe solitary forager hypothesis\nand opportunistic strategy (Brune and Brune-Cohrs, 2006); and PTSD, a threat-avoidant\nstrategy (Bracha and Maser, 2008). Significant comparative evidence supports these four\ntheories. The symptoms of anxiety, depression, psychopathy and PTSD have been shown to\nexist in other animals, serving adaptive purposes. Imagine the plight of a guppy born\nwithout the capacity for predator anxiety or a social monkey born without the instinct to act\nsubordinate to larger, dominant monkeys. Despite the cultural stigma and psychological\npain associated with these four disorders today, genetic susceptibility to them would have\nconferred specific adaptive benefits in prehistoric times. Certainly, a person who meets the\ncriteria for an anxiety disorder takes this \"cautious strategy\" to an extreme; however,\nresearchers speculate that such people may have achieved high reproductive success during\nhighly volatile, violent or unpredictable times (Nesse, 2007). Similarly, self-subordination,\nthreat-avoidance and selfishness all represent important behavioral proclivities that have\nstrong neurological foundations in a large variety of species. Importantly, social and asocial\ntendencies also have neurological bases and vary widely between species (Robinson,\nFernald and Clayton, 2008). Innate predispositions toward sociality are also thought to vary\nwithin species (Brune and Brune-Cohrs, 2006), and it is thought that the severity of autism,\nlike the severity of these other disorders, can be shown to exist on a continuum. As a final\nexample of the success and applicability of evolutionary psychopathology to mental\ndisorder, let us consider the popular reconceptualization of attention-deficit / hyperactivity\ndisorder (ADHD).\nThom Hartmann (1997) coined the phrase \"hunter in a farmer's world\" to explain\nthe predicament of individuals with ADHD. He totally rethought the condition, explaining\nthat in the ancestral environment, children were not naturally selected to listen for hours on\nend, to pay careful attention to lessons, or to concentrate for long periods on assignments.\nShapiro and others (Jensen et al., 1997) have elaborated on this hypothesis. They explained\nthat the predilection for individuals with ADHD to be impulsive, hyperactive and scattered\ncould have offered advantages in prehistoric times. It is likely that the ability to focus on a\nsingle concept for a prolonged period was not necessarily beneficial in hunting and\ngathering times. High levels of activity and scanning, though, may have kept humans in\ntune with a rapidly changing environment and allowed them to identify and act on both\nimmediate threats and immediate opportunities. Additionally, Panksepp (1998) has\nconcluded that even some severe cases of ADHD may reflect normal variation in these\nadaptive tendencies. Likewise, this article will take the perspective of evolutionary\npsychopathology and make the argument that autism represents \"a lone forager in a social\nworld.\" As with ADHD, perhaps a large proportion of the autism spectrum, maybe even\npronounced cases of autism, may reflect normal variation. The autism spectrum will be\nconceptualized as representing naturally occurring variation, at one extreme end of the\nsociality continuum.\nPresentation of the Hypothesis\nToday, the cognitive disabilities associated with the autism spectrum are clear and\nwell documented; however, modern social, occupational, and mating practices may conceal\nthe evolutionary or adaptive benefits. From an anthropological perspective, the society we\nThe solitary forager hypothesis\nlive in is very different from the ancestral environment. Because of the large group sizes\nseen in modern day cities and the very social nature of modern employment, social abilities\nsuch as congeniality, extraversion and savoir-faire are highly regarded. Even minimal\nsocial dysfunction or awkwardness can be professionally and socially problematic. In fact,\nthe DSM considers social ability as a critical component of psychological health (APA,\n1994). Social ability may have been less critical though in the prehistoric past, especially\nwithin certain contexts. During the six million years since our branch diverged from that of\nchimpanzees, our ancestors lived in relatively small groups that probably fluctuated greatly\nin size (Nesse and Williams, 1995). Under these conditions, the abilities to relate\neffortlessly to a stranger, to display affection in a demonstrative manner, or to charm a\nforaging companion were probably exposed to inconsistent selective pressures.\nInconsistencies in the level of social ability that our environment demanded may well be\nresponsible for the large variation in social abilities seen in human populations, as well as\nthe extremes of social \"dysfunction.\"\nThe adaptive value of social ability may have been inconsistent in the ancestral past\nfor many reasons. Depending on the period of human evolution, the geographical location,\nthe ecological setting and the cultural habits of the group in question, ancestral foragers\nmay have foraged intimately with others throughout the day, may have spent weeks\nforaging alone, or anything between these two extremes. Humans are a highly social\nspecies, and this tells us that, like chimpanzees, we must have spent much of our formative\nyears congregating together (Byrne and Bates, 2007). However, just as our social\ntendencies are a testament to our social past, our asocial tendencies may indicate the\nopposite. In other words, during prehistoric times, a certain proportion of breeding\nindividuals may have adapted neurologically to living under conditions where group size\nwas very small or social contact was attenuated, and this may have led to the numerous\nautism genes found in the modern-day gene pool. It is unclear which phenotypes on the\nautism spectrum might have been selected for in the ancestral environment. Surely it is\nmost conservative and parsimonious though to assume that high-functioning or subclinical\nphenotypes were the substrate for selection.\nCertain eccentricities or impediments peculiar to autism may have precluded past\nresearchers from considering that individuals on the autism spectrum may have survived\nwell during prehistoric times. As in neurotypical individuals, behavior in autism can vary\nmarkedly from individual to individual. Some individuals with autism are awkward and\nunwieldy while others are graceful and nimble. Some are gentle and kind while others can\nbecome angry and violent. Some are severely mentally handicapped whereas others are\ncognitively gifted. These extremes, often barely tempered by social constraints and morays,\nmight make these individuals appear dangerously unnatural. Given this, and given that a\nproportion of individuals with autism cannot be mainstreamed comfortably in elementary\nschool, it may appear that autism would have been maladaptive. Hypothetically though, it\nwould be much more difficult to place a young orangutan in a human elementary school\nclassroom than it would be to place the average autistic child, and yet orangutans are\ncapable of reaching full ecological independence before age 10 (Wich, Atmoko, and Setia,\n2009). Although, some individuals on the autism spectrum have grave social deficits, many\nmay have been able to survive and prosper as effectively as other solitary mammals in their\nThe solitary forager hypothesis\nnatural environment. A great deal of new research supports this line of reasoning by\nillustrating that autistic individuals may have great trouble with social cognition but that\ntheir other cognitive abilities are largely intact (Baron-Cohen, 2003). The next section will\nconsider some of the findings in the literature on autistic intelligence, supporting the notion\nthat autistic individuals can be very competent in areas that do not require social cognition.\nTesting the Hypothesis\nAutistic intelligence and systemizing\nSimon Baron-Cohen and others have changed the way that many researchers think\nabout autism by pointing out that a social deficit alone may account for most of the\nsymptoms. Previous theories of autism have characterized autistics as cognitively confused,\ndisorganized or incoherent. Baron-Cohen, on the other hand, has characterized autistics as\nhaving profound social disabilities but otherwise being coherent and able-minded. His\ntheories of autism emphasize that the main deficit is in the social domain, specifically, in\nthe inability to empathize with and model the minds of others (Baron-Cohen, 1995). A\nlarge number of subsequent studies have substantiated that \"theory of mind,\" or the ability\nto empathize with others, is impaired in autism (Colle, Baron-Cohen, and Hill, 2007).\nBaron-Cohen and others have argued persuasively that impaired theory of mind in autism\ncan be independent of learning ability and general intelligence. Furthermore, he has\ndocumented that some autistic individuals can have superior technical understanding of\nphysical systems (sometimes referred to as folk physics as opposed to folk psychology)\ncompared to their age-matched peers, and he has termed this ability \"systemizing.\"\nBaron-Cohen has demonstrated that even though autistics are poor at empathizing,\nthey are good at systemizing. Systemizing is the ability to observe a physical system and\nmake inferences or conclusions about how it works and what causes it to work the way it\ndoes. He explains that systemizing works well for phenomena that are lawful and\ndeterministic but that systemizing is of almost no use when it comes to predicting moment-\nby-moment changes in a person's behavior. Empathizing and forming theories about the\nother person's mind is required for the latter task (Baron-Cohen, Ashwin, Ashwin,\nTavassoli, and Chakrabarti, 2009). According to Baron-Cohen, abilities that are associated\nwith empathizing include responding empathetically to distress, intuiting another's\nemotional state, being sensitive to facial expressions, and demonstrating ability with\nlanguage. Systemizing, on the other hand, is associated with ability in domains such as map\nreading, mental rotation, physics, mathematics and motoric systems (Baron-Cohen, 1995).\nPeople who are good at empathizing are thought to lean toward jobs in the areas of social\nwork, psychology, and nursing. High systemizing is thought to lead to jobs in engineering,\nconstruction, and science. Baron-Cohen has even indicated that he thinks that autistic traits\nmay have been naturally selected due to their contribution to tool construction and use\nUnlike autism, empathizing seems to be unimpaired in individuals with Down\nsyndrome, William's syndrome, and some other forms of mental retardation, despite their\ndecreased ability to systemize and their lower general intelligence (Baron-Cohen, Leslie,\nThe solitary forager hypothesis\ndissociation between intelligence and empathy indicates a real genetic and cognitive\ndifference between the two types of disorders. Many children with autism have IQs well\nbelow the average for their age; however, the intelligence tests that correct for social\ndisability have shown that many autistics may in fact not be intellectually impaired at all\n(Scheuffgen, Happe, Anderson, and Frith, 2000). Contrary to speculations, researchers have\nfound little evidence of a deficit of executive function in autistic children younger than 4\nyears of age. This suggests that the mild executive function deficits seen after age 4 are not\nprimary to the disorder but may arise later because of the absence of social learning\n(Griffith, Pennington, Wehner, and Rogers, 1999). In fact, several \"less learned, more\ninnate\" executive functions, including inhibition and visual working memory, appear to be\nBaron-Cohen, and those who have followed him, has performed a great deal of\nresearch showing that systemizing is part of the genetic profile of autism and that the\nautistic spectrum is continuous with normal human variation. He has demonstrated that the\nparents and relatives of people with autism are good at systemizing but not very good at\nempathizing. He has compiled data showing that fathers and grandfathers of males with\nautism are twice as likely to be engineers compared to males in the general population\n(Baron-Cohen, 2006). He has also shown that students in the natural sciences have a higher\nnumber of relatives with autism than do students in the humanities (Baron-Cohen, 2006).\nBaron-Cohen and others have also shown that in Asperger's syndrome and in high-\nfunctioning autism, individuals can perform at normal or often superior levels in tasks\nrequiring the systemization of information. People with Asperger's scored higher on his\nSystemizing Quotient (SQ) (Baron-Cohen, Richler, Bisarya, Gurunathan, and Wheelwright,\n2003), performed better on tests of intuitive physics (Lawson, Baron-Cohen, and\nWheelwright, 2004) and can reach extremely high levels of achievement in systemizing\ndomains, such as mathematics, physics, and computer science (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright,\nStone, and Rutherford, 1999). This has been called the \"autism advantage\" in popular\nautism advocacy. It is thought that these high-functioning autistic individuals may be\nneurologically well-suited for certain jobs that are detail-oriented, repetitive, and involve\nthe identification of technical errors (Scheuffgen et al., 2000). A popular conceptualization\nof this purports the idea that quirky computer specialists working in Silicon Valley, for\nexample, desire jobs allowing them to work alone on computing problems, tend to marry\nothers who are high on systemizing but low on empathy, and tend to have a propensity to\nhave children that, like them, are on the autism spectrum. Baron-Cohen pointed out that, \"If\nsystemizing talent is genetic, such genes appear to co-segregate with genes for autism\nBaron-Cohen has extended his theories into the \"extreme male brain theory\" of\nautism (Baron-Cohen, 2003). He pointed out that women, when compared to men, are more\nverbal, more socially adept, and have more sophisticated capacities for empathy and theory\nof mind. He asserted that the differences between non-autistics and autistics could be\nthought of as analogous to the differences between women and men. This extreme male\nbrain theory is fascinating, well-supported, and may produce testable hypotheses. Baron-\nCohen's analogies may be expanded if one concludes that autism represents the cognitive\nstyle of an individual who is well-suited for living alone. Comparing non-autistic and\nThe solitary forager hypothesis\nautistic individuals then may be more like comparing a dog (a pack animal) to a cat (a\nlargely solitary animal) rather than comparing a woman to a man.\nBaron-Cohen and others have been successful in convincing many researchers that\nautistic people are intelligent in a different way and very good at systemizing and\nunderstanding non-social, natural processes. Baron-Cohen has even posited that evolution\nmay have maintained the genes for autism precisely because of the systemizing ability,\nsuggesting also that many cases of autism may be due to the assortative mating of two\nhigh-systemizing parents (Baron-Cohen, 2006). The present paper hopes to extend these\narguments by pointing out that these natural systemizing abilities could have predisposed\npeople on the autism spectrum to be able-minded, able-bodied, solitary foragers in the\nprehistoric past.\nAutistic intelligence and foraging\nIn modern society, due to cultural, historic, and sociological circumstances, many\nindividuals with autism do not learn to become self-sufficient. Due to their social deficits,\nmany people with autism do not follow their peers on a path toward social and occupational\nmobility. Today, children must go through a prolonged period of education and\nsocialization to reach a point where they can hold a job and live autonomously. Autonomy\nand even food procurement depend on social abilities as well as learning that took place in\na particularly social setting, the school classroom. Schooling can be very difficult for\nindividuals with autism because, as the systemizing theory of autism has demonstrated,\nindividuals with autism have a proclivity to learn things on their own rather than from\nothers (Siegel, 2003). Unfortunately, the interests chosen and knowledge acquired by\nindividuals with autism often do not coincide with financial, professional, or social\nopportunities (Cimera and Cowan, 2009). Even when carefully guided by loving parents, it\nis difficult for many individuals with autism to teach themselves how to become self-\nsufficient in today's world. However, this may have been much more natural in the\nancestral environment, particularly considering that merely 10,000 years ago, neither food\nprocurement nor the acquisition of a place to sleep were necessarily contingent on social\nability as they are today. The discipline of behavioral ecology, which may be applicable\nhere, is based on the premise that behavioral traits, and the neural substrates responsible for\nthem, are shaped by natural selection and hence are fine-tuned to respond to a particular\nenvironment (Krebs and Davies, 1993). The autism spectrum may be explicable in terms of\nbehavioral ecology in the sense that it represents the adaptive value of being fine-tuned to\nthrive in an environment with diminished social contact.\nSimilar to mothers in contemporary foraging societies, mothers in the ancestral past\nwould have required their children to learn how to forage for food from an early age (Buss,\n2005). Virtually all mammals, whether of social or asocial species, use their systemizing\nabilities to learn food procurement techniques from their mothers (Krebs and Davies,\n1993). The offspring of asocial mammalian species may not be motivated to empathize or\nsocialize much with their mother, but are nonetheless driven by hunger to attend to her\nexamples and internalize her tactics (Begon, Townsend, and Harper, 1996). This strategy\nworks well for hundreds of species of asocial mammals (even ones with very small brains\nand limited systemizing abilities) and presumably would have worked well for individuals\nThe solitary forager hypothesis\nwith autism. Of course, it would be an immoral experiment to place an autistic toddler and\nits mother in the wilderness for years in order to see if he or she learns and thrives.\nHowever, would such an experiment be needed if it could be shown that autistic behaviors\nare normal relative to those of other solitary animals taken out of the wild since birth (e.g.,\na pet reptile, a domestic cat, or a captive orangutan)? Are there reasons to think that an\nindividual with autism, living in prehistoric times, would not be strongly motivated by\nthirst, appetite, discomfort, sexual urges, and other innate instincts to become nutritionally\nindependent and to increase its reproductive success?\nThe behavior of autistic individuals is often seen as bewilderingly inappropriate in a\nsocial context, because they so often become interested in or obsessed with socially\nmeaningless activities (Piven, 2000). In a natural environment though, it is likely that\nhunger would have motivated them to redirect their obsessive tendencies toward food\nprocurement. Today, their hunger for food does not drive them to refine food procurement\ntechniques because their parents feed them every time they are hungry. Modern humans are\nresponsible for social and academic learning and are rarely given the chance to be\npositively reinforced by successful food acquisition. This temporal or causal pairing\nbetween learning and satiety, integral for wild animals (Domjan, 2003), has been\nartificially taken away from modern children. Because the compelling and coercing natural\ninstinct of hunger does not actuate or motivate modern individuals with autism, their efforts\nand skills are misplaced onto irrelevant stimuli.\nThe powerful and mobilizing asocial fascinations and preoccupations seen in\nmodern-day autism could have aided their prehistoric counterparts in self-preservation.\nHumans habituate to things that they are not interested in and systemize things that they\nfind rewarding, motivating, or intrinsically interesting. In the ancestral past, activities\nleading up to the sating of hunger would have been highly reinforced, and thus food\nprocurement and food processing strategies would have been the primary variables of the\nreinforcement schedule for individuals with autism. Perhaps, when children with autism\nignore their parent's examples of social behavior today, it is because these examples seem\nuninteresting and meaningless, whereas in the ancestral past they would have been inspired\nby their parent's hunting and gathering activities. Today, because they are not able to\nforage or to watch their parents forage and because they can obtain food free of effort, their\ninterests are redirected toward salient, nonsocial activities, like stacking blocks, flipping\nlight switches, lining toys up in rows, playing with running water, chasing vacuum\ncleaners, and collecting bottle tops. This kind of misapplication of an innate tendency is\nknown in human ethology as a type of \"vacuum activity\" (Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 2009, p. 153).\nThe interests of autistic individuals often lead to the development of islets of\naptitude or competence. Despite obvious deficits, many exhibit that they have refined or\neven mastered certain skills. These skills are often referred to as splinter skills. These may\ninclude eccentric proficiencies, such as penchants for drawing, music, rote-memory, or\npuzzle solving (Treffert, 2009). In extreme cases, these skills might include what are often\ncalled savant abilities including things like counting, hyperlexia, pattern finding, and\ncalendar or mathematical calculation (Treffert, 2000). Some of these skills and abilities in\nautism were probably acquired because the individual focused on a particular type of\nproblem solving, they learned to systemize a particular system, and then they retained and\nThe solitary forager hypothesis\nelaborated on the ability. In the past, these elaborate abilities would probably have mapped\nonto the acquisition of foraging techniques, which, would have been honed to proficiency\nthrough rote repetition and practice.\nMany anthropologists studying hunter-gatherer groups exclaim that the foragers that\nthey are observing have cultivated amazing naturalistic abilities and are able to sense and\nperceive things to which they themselves are virtually blind (Kaplan, Hill, Lancaster, and\nHurtado, 2000). These abilities, like tracking, ranging, stalking, food processing, mapping\nof terrain, and knowledge of flora and fauna may be areas through which the potential for\nautistic or savant-like abilities were channeled in the ancestral past. The same could be said\nfor the deep stores of specialized or technical knowledge exhibited by people on the autism\nspectrum. This penchant for knowledge about pet interests could have been dedicated to\nmemorizing edible and inedible species, analyzing the habits of prey items, understanding\nself-protection, maximization of food-collection efficiency, tool fashioning, and shelter\nprocurement.\nAside from their asocial preoccupations, individuals with autism also exhibit\nstereotyped and repetitive actions (Piven, 2000). In fact, many mammals engage in\nperseverative or repetitious behaviors especially when placed into unnatural or confining\nenvironments (Lewis, Tanimura, Lee, and Bodfish, 2007). Repetitive, stereotypical\nbehavior (including self-injurious behavior) is very rare in the wild but very common in\ncaptive animals, as well as in autism (Grandin, 2009). More intelligent animals seem to\nhave increased capacity for self-injurious behaviors. It has been estimated that 10 to 15\npercent of rhesus monkeys living alone in a cage develop self-biting, head banging and\nself-slapping (Lewis et al., 2007). This may indicate that the living conditions that many\nyoung individuals with autism experience are artificial, and possibly inhumane, as they are\nnot as stimulating or motivating as the wild environment that they are born expecting.\nThe propensity toward strict adherence to routine seen in autism may have close\nanalogues in the \"master routines\" and \"subroutines\" of many non-social species (e.g.,\nwaking, cautious emergence, defecation, grooming, basking, foraging, returning, bedding,\nsleeping). Although such neurologically mediated rituals can be repetitive and inflexible at\ntimes in many vertebrate species, they are important regulators of adaptive behavior\n(MacLean, 1990). Perhaps the persistent, stereotyped behaviors characteristic of autism had\necological utility in the sense that they allowed structure, order, and self-regulation. Why is\nthere the tendency toward tedium and invariability then? Most of the variety in the life of a\nhuman hunter-gatherer is probably found in its social interactions. There would probably be\nmuch less variety in the life of a lone hunter-gatherer. A lone forager would be forced to\nengage in lonely, repetitive, and stereotypic activities, such as scanning repeatedly for\nthreats and items to scavenge, picking and processing fruit, searching for and extracting\nvegetables, and locating and capturing prey items. An obsessive desire for sameness,\nrepetition, and ritual makes little sense in the context of a social setting but seems\napplicable in a lone setting. In fact, it might be bad to expect variability and to thrive off\nunpredictability in a solitary scenario because of the monotony of living alone.\nA mind that is highly geared toward using social cognition and forming emotional\nrelationships would have been disadvantageous in an individual who was forced by\ncircumstance to live in a solitary scenario. This may help explain why many individuals\nThe solitary forager hypothesis\nwith autism have an undue preference for their own company, pay attention to the non-\nsocial aspects of people, and treat others as if they were inanimate objects (Bowler, 2007).\nConcentrating on empathy or theory of mind would probably have been impractical and\ncounterproductive. Brune and Brune-Cohrs (2006) have speculated that theory of mind and\nsocial cognition are probably vulnerable to dysfunction. He pointed out that most people at\none time or another have strong desires to ascribe intentions to non-animals. A solitary\nforager without autism may be likely to attribute agency or ascribe intentions to inanimate\nobjects, amounting to displaced and confused behavior.\nIn her book \"Animals Make Us Human\" autistic professor Temple Grandin (who\nherself engaged in repetitive, restricted and self-injurious behavior at a young age) points\nout that even though domestic dogs and cats both live comfortably with humans, only cats\ncan leave a human family to live solitarily in the wild (Grandin, 2009). \"If you put the\nfamily poodle out in the countryside, his chances of surviving are low unless he finds\nanother family to live with. But abandoned cats do fine\" (p. 70). Here she underscores the\nfact that some animals are obligately social whereas others can transition between social\nand solitary lifestyles. Her life story is an attestation to the fact that individuals with severe\nautism can make this transition while maintaining the \"cognitive coherency\" to contribute\nprofoundly to both industry and academia (Grandin, 1996).\nLike other animals that are not obligately social, many individuals with autism\navoid close bodily contact and fail to establish emotional relationships. It seems that these\ntendencies might have facilitated solitary life, whereas the inclinations to seek out physical\ncontact and emotional relationships could have made solitary life miserable or unbearable.\nClassic works of fiction portraying humans abandoned or marooned from others emphasize\nthe human need for companionship. The protagonists in such works frequently have\nunremitting obsessions with imaginary friends, behavior that would be extraneous and\nprobably maladaptive for a solitary human. People on the autism spectrum would be less\nlikely to yearn for companionship and more likely to focus on survival. Solitary species\nhave very limited abilities for social cognition. This is probably because gregarious\npredispositions, companionable inclinations, and social instincts in general are maladaptive\nin a solitary context.\nAutistics and orangutans: Solitary foragers\nAn analysis of the behavior of orangutans in the wild offers valuable insight into the\necology of a solitary ape. Most animals, many mammals, and several species of primates\nseek out food on their own. It is clear that such a solitary foraging strategy can even be\neffective for apes. In fact, orangutans, the species that is genetically third closest to humans\nas revealed by molecular studies, live solitarily in the wild. Orangutans eat, sleep, hunt, and\nforage on their own (Delgado and Van Schaik, 2000). They are often described as cautious\nand introverted, and it has been estimated that Bornean orangutans spend at least 95% of\ntheir time alone (Van Schaik, 1999). Orangutans have low interaction and association rates,\nand only infrequently meet up with conspecifics, often only to mate (Van Schaik and Van\nHoof, 1996). They have been reported to congregate in small groups temporarily, but only\nto eat from a particularly fruit-laden tree. Several specialists emphasize that orangutans\nhave limited social aptitude and tend to prefer solitude (Van Schaik, 1999). Van Schaik\nThe solitary forager hypothesis\n(1999) has concluded that, unlike all other species of apes, well-defined communities do\nnot appear to exist in any orangutan population studied so far.\nIn orangutans, inculcation in infancy and juvenility consists of learning about food\nprocurement from the mother. In stark contrast, chimpanzees are indoctrinated into learning\nabout both food procurement and socialization (Delgado and Van Schaik, 2000). Orangutan\nmothers teach their babies to recognize edible food species, implement foraging techniques,\nfind shelter from the elements, protect themselves from predators, and develop effective\nranging capabilities (Noordwijk and Van Schaik, 2005). Compared to chimpanzees, young\norangutans do not learn much from their mothers about communication or socialization;\nhowever, they do learn everything that they need to survive and reproduce.\nUnlike their orangutan counterparts, chimpanzee adolescents reliably stay with (or\nat least frequently visit) their mothers for months or years after they have been weaned\n(Goodall, 1986). Their strong affective ties, emotional attachments, and gregarious nature\nkeep mother and child in contact into adulthood or, at times, throughout life (Galdikas,\n1984). Orangutans, on the other hand, exhibit very different behavior. Adolescent\norangutans reliably leave their mother and go off on their own to forage very soon after\nweaning. The bond between the mother and child is based largely on the provision of milk\n(Noordwijk and Van Schaik, 2005). One of the most frequent complaints of parents with\nautistic children is that they find it very difficult to build an emotional bond with the child\n(Frith, 1991). One might imagine that in an ancestral setting the bond between a mother\nand her autistic child could have been as delicate (and yet at times, as ecologically\nappropriate) as the bond seen in orangutans. Despite this relative delicacy, the vast majority\nof babies and children with autism do develop true psychological attachments to their\ncaregivers. This attachment would probably have facilitated the acquisition of foraging\ntechniques as it does in orangutans.\nThe ability to make inferences about the mental states of others probably first\nemerged in a clear form during early primate evolution due to heavy selection from the\nsocial environment (Brothers, 1990). Apes, relative to monkeys though, have elaborated\ngreatly upon this ability, presumably because their social environment was even more\nimportant. Aside from orangutans, all apes, including gibbons, gorillas, chimpanzees, and\nbonobos are social species, much like humans (Chance and Jolly, 1970). To some degree, it\nseems that orangutans regressed in their social abilities relative to other apes because, as\ntheir group size decreased, pressure from the social environment must have decreased\nalong with it.\nPrimatologists generally agree that orangutans live solitary lifestyles primarily\nbecause the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, where they are found, have poor food density.\nRelative to the lush African regions that chimpanzees and gorillas inhabit, these islands\ncannot support large groups of social apes (Delgado and Van Schaik, 2000). If orangutans\nlived in larger social groups, they would have to travel extremely far (up to 20 miles) each\nday simply to get enough food to sustain themselves (Sugardijto, te Boekhorst, and van\nHoof, 1987). Because orangutans are large animals, and because the trees and bushes in\ntheir non-seasonal habitat go through various phases of producing buds, shoots, and fruit,\nthe orangutans must forage through many plants daily to ferret out the right dietary\nfoodstuffs (Delgado and van Schaik, 2000). Because they must traverse so much land\nThe solitary forager hypothesis\neveryday in order to obtain a sufficient number of calories, individual orangutans must\ndefine large territories for themselves. It is thought that in Sumatra, each orangutan needs\nnearly a square kilometer and that in Borneo each requires an even larger area of spatial\nisolation (MacKinnon, 1974). Fascinatingly, Borneo is thought to be less food-dense, and\nBornean orangutans are thought to be less socially inclined when compared to Sumatran\norangutans (Van Schaik, 1999). Food density of the habitat is actually known to be an\nimportant determinant of group size in a number of animals (Marler, 1968). In fact, when\nfood becomes scarce, even chimpanzees split up to search for food alone (de Waal, 1982).\nHarsh and unpredictable climates marked much of the period of human evolution\n(Reed, 1997). The Pleistocene and Pliocene ice ages caused frequent aridity of the African\nplains, which would have dried up many sources of food for our foraging ancestors\n(Ravelo, Andreasen, Lyle, Lyle, and Wara, 2004). These conditions would have rendered\nour habitat nutritionally scarce (Bobe, Behrensmeyer, and Chapman, 2002), perhaps\nforcing groups of our ancestors to disband. Humans may have been forced to do this\nhabitually in the past despite the fact that we are an inherently social species. In sum,\nenvironmental forces prominent during our evolution caused nutritional scarcity that, at\nleast in some geographic regions, may have created the same conditions that selected\norangutans to become solitary. Another condition that influences selection for sociality is\nthe distribution of food resources. It is known that when food is approximately evenly\ndispersed in an environment, solitary foraging yields higher energy returns, but when food\nis clumped, group foraging becomes more efficient (Marler, 1968). One may not even need\nto invoke scarcity or food distribution patterns to conclude that many pre-social species,\nincluding humans, may have experienced historical disruptions (either punctuated or\ngradualistic) in their social continuity that left lasting traces in the genome.\nAdaptations particular to orangutans, which are thought to reflect their life-history\nstrategies, may have implications for autism. Orangutans exhibit prominent sexual\ndimorphism (van Schaik, 2004), and much of this is thought to be due to high testosterone\nlevels in the males. Autistics are also thought to exhibit elevated testosterone levels, which\nmay be associated with increased fetal exposure to testosterone (Knickmeyer, Baron-\nCohen, Raggatt, and Taylor, 2005). It might make sense that a solitary strategy is better\nsuited to males given that female animals of many species have an increased need for social\nsupport and parenting proficiency. Male orangutans actually spend a greater proportion of\ntheir time alone compared to females (most of the time spent between two males is thought\nto be attributable to random, unintended encounters) (van Schaik, 1999). Interestingly,\nautism is four times more prevalent in men compared to women, is accompanied by more\nsevere anomalies in brain structure in men, and is known to have a worse prognosis in men\n(Bowler, 2007). Higher testosterone levels in autistic males may have increased their sexual\naggressiveness as well as their sexual attractiveness. Mating practices of individuals on the\nautism spectrum may have been similar to those of the orangutan. Females with autism or\non the autistic spectrum probably had little difficulty in procuring receptive sex partners.\nMales, on the other hand, could have procured partners using the same tactics used by male\norangutans, such as propositioning, perseverative soliciting, provisioning, food sharing, and\nothers.\nIt has not yet been made clear how much orangutan neurology has been affected by\nThe solitary forager hypothesis\ntheir recent stint of solitary foraging, which may have only gone on for the last 10,000\nyears (Van Schaik, 1999). Regardless, evolutionary comparisons with solitary primates and\nother solitary mammals that are known to have neurological adaptations causing them to\nlack biological instincts for gregariousness, affection, and strong social relationships should\nbe informative. It is also important to affirm that no offense is intended toward autistic\nindividuals in this comparison with orangutans. Only traits related to sociality are\ncompared here, and individuals with autism are not in any way equated with apes in\ngeneral. In fact, individuals with autism are only compared to orangutans here to the same\nextent that neurotypical individuals are compared to chimpanzees. Orangutans were\nselected as a basis of comparison for this article simply because they are the species of\nsolitary foragers that is most closely related to humans.\nThe evolution of autism\nThe evolution of social tendencies in animals is a poorly understood topic of\nresearch. Even less understood is the evolution of solitary tendencies from social forebears.\nIt is clear that there are costs and benefits to living in groups and that the pressures from the\nsocial environment can change abruptly (Perez-Barberia, Shultz, and Dunbar, 2007).\nSurely, in the past, individuals on the autism spectrum were sometimes born into the arms\nof supportive and cohesive social groups, much like today. If autism does represent a\nsolitary forager strategy, then this circumstance could have constituted a mismatch that\nmay have been negatively selected against. However, most adaptations have risks\nassociated with them and instead of representing a panacea; they reflect tradeoffs that, over\nevolutionary time, produce on average more benefits than costs. This mismatch may not\neven have decreased fitness. Given the propensities of modern day people with autism,\nsuch individuals might have chosen to journey off alone nomadically or hermitically.\nAlternatively, they might have chosen to forage alone but return to their group infrequently\nin order to interact and travel with group members. This may have depended on \"how\nautistic\" the individual was. Even individuals on the far side of the autism spectrum may\nnot have even been truly solitary during prehistory. Social chess abilities or Machiavellian\nintelligence are not well developed in people on the autism spectrum. Their speech and\nmannerisms can be monotonous and mechanical, yet this may not have kept them from\noffering valuable skills and forming functional relationships with other humans. In many\ncases, autistic individuals exhibit pragmatic competence that could have made them\nvaluable attributes to their foraging companions. Today, a large proportion of individuals\nwith Asperger's have been assimilated into elite social and professional spheres despite the\nfact that they are not adroit social conformers (Grandin, Duffy, and Attwood, 2008). It is\nreasonable to imagine that a proficient hunter with autism could be not only tolerated but\nhighly valued by a small band of hunters who were each eccentric themselves, not having\nbeen exposed to our modern, relatively conformist, post-industrial society. This would be\nakin to the situation today where millions of mainstreamed autistic children around the\nworld have become accepted on the playground, despite their differences. It is well\naccepted that despite valuing their time alone, many individuals with autism enjoy\nfriendships and have a documented predilection for valuing quality of friends over quantity\n(Bauminger et al., 2008). Similarly, when in captivity, or when gathering around a large,\nThe solitary forager hypothesis\nfertile fruit tree, orangutans can be observed to have social competencies, even if they are\nnot as facile or effusive as chimpanzees.\nIf autism in fact evolved, did it do so predominantly among neurotypical humans or\nwithin an isolated population of solitary individuals? The autism continuum could represent\na remnant of genetic introgression that took place before humans were the lone species in\nour genus. Perhaps some of the genes for autism evolved not in our direct ancestral line but\nin a solitary subspecies which later merged genetically with our line of descent through\ngene flow. Demes, or subpopulations of relatively solitary individuals, could have been\nassimilated into our gene pool after a fair amount of interbreeding following migration.\nSuch solitary subpopulations could have arisen in ecologically or climatologically different\ngeographic regions of Africa anytime during the Plio-Pliestocene.\nThe evolution of human populations with short stature may shed light on this issue.\nThe pygmy phenotype, characterized by small body size, appears to have evolved\nindependently in South American, African, and Southeast Asian populations in the last\n200,000 years. The phenotype is mostly restricted to rainforest environments and is thought\nto represent a response to the selective pressures associated with living in a tropical\nrainforest (Migliano, Vinicius, and Lahr, 2007). This powerful climatological association\nhas motivated adaptationist hypotheses as to how small size would increase reproductive\nsuccess in a warm, wet environment with dense foliage. Physical anthropologists have\nhypothesized that short stature may have increased the capacity to cope with one or more of\nthe following: caloric limitations, high temperature, high humidity, extensive forest\nundergrowth, increased mortality, vitamin deficiencies or even a combination of these\n(Migliano et al., 2007). Multiple genetic disruptions of the growth hormone and insulin-like\ngrowth factor I pathway are likely to be involved etiologically, but no specific DNA\nmutations have been uncovered (Cavalli-Sforza, 1986). It is clear though that when\npygmies intermarry with non-pygmies, the result is a spectrum; children tend to be\nintermediate in stature to those of the two parental populations (Cavalli-Sforza, 1986).\nPygmy populations show us a few things that are interesting in the present context: 1.\nisolated pockets of humans can remain reproductively insulated for long enough to evolve\ndiscrepant ecological strategies; 2. such populations can quickly (less than 40,000 years in\nthe South American and Asian pygmies; Cavalli-Sforza, 1986) develop features that vary\nmarkedly from the norm; 3. these traits can involve multiple genes at different loci; and 4.\ninterbreeding can result in either continuous or polymorphic variation in subsequent\ngenerations. It is interesting to note that, as these indigenous people become assimilated\ninto other gene pools, the genes for short stature will persist and may affect phenotypic\nvariability in sporadic and unpredictable ways for a long time to come.\nThe genes that make up a polygenic trait usually all have different natural histories.\nThey appeared as mutations at different periods, and they were selected at different times.\nFor example, several different genes, each working through different molecular\nmechanisms, helped Europeans develop lighter skin as they moved to higher latitudes over\nthe last 60,000 years. Interestingly, an entirely different set of alleles with unique cellular\nproperties helped people in northern Asia develop lighter skin (Norton et al., 2007). Few of\nthese genes have been selected to fixation, and they occur together in different proportions,\ncreating a lot of variability in skin color even within isolated populations. The genes for\nThe solitary forager hypothesis\nautism may be similar to these examples in the sense that each gene may have a different\nnatural history. Some genes may have been meant to work cooperatively whereas other\nhave not. Each gene that predisposes toward autism may represent a different way to make\nan organism a little less reliant on sociality.\nLike other polygenic, continuous traits, the mutations responsible for autism could\nhave been maintained by \"environmental heterogeneity,\" a form of balancing selection. In\nother words, the genes responsible for autism may have remained in our gene pool because\nas social-environmental conditions fluctuated in the past, discrepant genetic\npolymorphisms, or \"multiple alternate alleles,\" were favored. Currently, it is not possible to\nscrutinize the natural history of autism genes at this level of analysis because, even though\nover a dozen genes have been implicated, including an oxytocin receptor, a serotonin\ntransporter, and putative language genes, very little agreement exists in the literature over\nIt is currently not possible to tell whether the frequencies of genetic variants\nresponsible for autism are high enough, or in the right proportions, to accommodate a\nmodel of past positive selection. The contributions of a large number of relatively rare\ngenes and of de novo mutations (Abrahams and Geschwind, 2008) tell us that autism may\nnot have been subject to natural selection for thousands of years and that it may have a\nlarge non-evolutionary component, as well as an irregular evolutionary signature. The\npresent article cannot fully address this issue primarily because of the lack of knowledge\nabout the genetics of autism. It is unclear whether autism can be explained better by rare\nmutations or by rare combinations of common genetic variants (Muhle, Trentacoste, and\nRapin, 2004). Future linkage and association studies though may be able to resolve whether\nthe responsible genes are mutated sequences encoding aberrant gene products or normal\npolymorphisms acting synergistically (Kumar and Christian, 2009). It is also clear that a\ncertain proportion of the clinical picture of autism is not representative of adaptation. Some\ncases of autism are associated with congenital anomalies and physical stigmata that were\nprobably not adaptive. How and why rare comorbidities such as Rett syndrome, tuberous\nsclerosis, fragile X syndrome, psychomotor epilepsy, and other clinical entities can present\nwith autism is far from apparent (Amaral et al., 2008). It may be the case that several\npathological conditions present symptoms that resemble autism (or exacerbate autism) and\nthus clinicians and epidemiologists have grouped them together with autism, obscuring its\nnatural visage and the elements of it that could have been adaptive. This is certainly the\ncase with ADHD and schizophrenia. Idiopathic or teratogenic neurodevelopmental insults\ncan closely mimic these as well as other neurodevelopmental disorders (Zimmerman,\n2008). Many of these unknowns will not become clear until additional genetic, molecular,\nand pathophysiological research is done.\nAnother important criticism of the present argument is that there may be no clearly\ndocumented anthropological evidence for solitary foraging in modern humans. This\nshouldn't be taken as significant evidence against the present hypothesis given that there do\nnot seem to be any documented examples of autistic individuals in hunter-gatherer groups\neither. It seems that no one has looked for these things systematically. The prevalence of\nautism in forager groups should be equivalent to the prevalence in the rest of the world,\ngiven that epidemiologic studies indicate that environmental factors, such as perinatal\nThe solitary forager hypothesis\ninsults, prenatal infections, teratogens, and toxins (factors that may be particular to modern\nlife) account for only very few cases of autism (Amaral et al., 2008). In modern society, it\nis apparent many people intentionally sequester themselves or prefer solitude to different\ndegrees, and it is reasonable to expect that this type of behavior would have existed in the\nancestral past and could have been continuous with the autism spectrum. Despite the fact\nthat there seems to be no academic literature on solitary foraging in humans it is clear that\nwhen food is scarce, hunting parties have been seen to disperse for solitary hunting and\nreconvene at later times (Hill and Kaplan, 1993; Jochim, 1988). When food is not abundant\nand nutritional intake is low, the optimal foraging strategy is to lower population size and\ndensity (Belovsky, 1988). As with other apes, submarginal or impoverished habitats cannot\nsupport large groups of humans, and group size diminishes under these circumstances\nSeveral substantiated cases of abandoned youths, known as feral children, have\nsurvived to adulthood in the wild (Brothers, 1990). It is probable that a much larger\nproportion of children were orphaned in the wilderness in ancestral times, and this may\nhave contributed to the selective pressures for asocial temperament. Feral children usually\nhave many autistic features in the sense that they are emotionally detached, prefer solitude,\nand eschew physical contact (Brothers, 1990). These features may constitute protective,\nadaptive responses to solitary life, and their resemblance to the symptoms of autism may\nnot be coincidental.\nA consistent, predictable proportion of ancestral humans (and ancestral hominins)\nmust have been forced to live alone during the six million years of human prehistory. From\nthese individuals, the ones with mutations that created disruptive abnormalities in regions\nof the social brain may have experienced increased reproductive success. This should not\nsound like a stretch, considering that this general pattern may have already occurred during\nthe evolution of orangutans. After orangutans diverged from the common ancestor that they\nshared with gibbons around 18 million years ago, they moved into Southeast Asian\nrainforests where they were forced to give up their social lives for solitary ones because of\necological constraints (Sugardjito et al., 1987). It appears that from the consistency of their\nbehavior in and out of the wild, their solitary tendencies may be hereditary and\nneurological. For this reason, it should be very informative for autism researchers to\ncompare the brain areas responsible for social cognition across apes. This kind of research\nhas not yet been done. We may never know exactly what it was like to have autism in\nprehistoric times, but comparing them to known solitary species on a variety of\nneurological measures may provide clarification.\nThe brain in autism\nThe brain abnormalities in autism do not seem to constitute indiscriminate\npathological abnormalities as one might expect if autism were simply a disease. The most\nconspicuous brain abnormalities seem to consistently and systematically affect the areas of\nthe brain that have been associated with social cognition (Adolfs, 2001). The amygdala, the\nanterior cingulate cortex, the orbito and medial frontal cortex, and the mirror neuron system\nhave all been strongly associated with social cognition (Dapretto, Davies, and Pfeifer,\n2006), and also have been shown to be the same areas that exhibit the prominent anomalies\nThe solitary forager hypothesis\nin autism (Williams, Whiten, Suddendorf, and Perrett, 2001). This selectivity makes it\nseem that the genes that influence social areas of the brain were affected and the others\nwere spared (consonant with Baron-Cohen's psychological theories of autism). According\nto Gelman and Williams (1998), brains have been evolutionarily organized to acquire and\nstore particular sorts of relevant information and disregard other, irrelevant information. In\nthis context, individuals along the autistic spectrum appear to have a neurological\npropensity to gate out social information and thus gain conscious access to highly\nprocessed nonsocial perceptions and schemata. This section will look at how this might be\naccomplished by focusing on eye contact, facial expression, oxytocin regulation,\nmacrocephaly, amygdala reactivity, and facial recognition in autism.\nCurious phenomena that are very common in autism are averted gaze and poor eye\ncontact (Hutt and Ounsted, 1966). Autistic individuals describe eye contact as\nuncomfortable and even threatening (Piven, 2000). Interestingly, eye contact is also very\nrare in the vast majority of solitary species, including orangutans, who actively avoid both\ndirect gazing and even facing (Yamagiwa, 1992). Chimpanzees and gorillas share gazes\nand use the eyes for communication frequently, just like most humans (Gomez, 1996).\nChimps and gorillas use eye contact constantly while interacting with members of their\nown group but may charge at an individual from another group if it makes eye contact.\nStaring between unfamiliar apes is often interpreted as a threat signal; therefore, it is best\nfor a solitary mammal to avoid both eye contact and direct gazing in order to forestall an\nattack (Gomez, 1996). Orangutans actively avoid gazing and eye contact and this tendency,\nvery common among solitary animals, has been explicitly interpreted as adaptive for their\nsolitary foraging niche (Yamagiwa, 1992). Instead of face-to-face direct viewing,\norangutans, like individuals with autism, glance momentarily at others sideways with the\nhead turned away (Kaplan and Rogers, 1996). The neurological substrates (including\namygdalar sensitivity) that underlie this very specific and prominent tendency may have\nevolved for the same adaptive, defensive reasons in both autistic individuals and\norangutans.\nStudies have shown that autistic individuals are less expressive, especially with\nrespect to facial communication. They make fewer facial expressions and are rated as more\nflat or neutral in affect by observers (Yirmija, Kasari, Sigman, and Mundy, 1989). This\nabsence of facial responsiveness is probably due to underlying neuronal mechanisms, and\nthere is evidence that the facial motor nucleus is significantly reduced in size in autism\n(Rodier, Ingram, Tisdale, Nelson, and Romano, 1996). Fascinatingly, the size of the facial\nmotor nucleus is thought to vary predictably in total volume as a function of group size in\nmonkeys and apes. The larger the average group size, the more important facial\nexpressiveness is and the larger the facial motor nucleus must be (Sherwood, 2005). It\nshould be informative to analyze the anatomical organization of the autistic facial motor\nnucleus, taking note of the general size, the placement of motor neurons, distribution of\nneuron types and the general topography of muscle representation. Experts in phylogenetic\nspecializations of primate facial neurology might be able to perceive social or ecological\ntraits in the distinctive anatomical organization of the facial neural pathways in autism.\nAnalyzing it relative to that in orangutans should be informative as well, as it is known that\norangutans are much less facially expressive than other apes (Liebal, Pika, and Tomasello,\nThe solitary forager hypothesis\nOxytocin, a neuropeptide thought to enhance social learning, social expressiveness,\ndirect eye gaze and the ability to remember faces (Savaskan, Ehrhardt, Schulz, Walter, and\nSchachniger, 2008), is reduced in autism subjects. Diminished peripheral levels of oxytocin\nmay play a large role in retuning social brain modules in autism (Green et al., 2001). It has\nbeen shown that intravenous oxytocin produces a significant reduction in stereotypic\nbehaviors in adult autism subjects and increases empathy in people without autism\n(Hollander et al., 2003). Variation in oxytocin levels in mammals reflects adaptations to the\nsocial environment, just as it may in the case of autism. Animals that rely on pair-bonds\nand social attachment have higher levels of plasma oxytocin, especially when it is\nbehaviorally relevant, like during childbirth or monogamous sex (Campbell, 2008).\nComparing prairie voles to montane voles, two very closely related species of rodent, is\ninteresting in this context because the two differ widely in bonding behavior. The montane\nvole, relative to the prairie vole, has a much smaller number of receptors in the brain for\noxytocin and, unlike the amorous prairie voles, they do not form pair bonds (Marler, 1968).\nThe montane voles have fewer receptors and thus are less responsive to oxytocin, making\nthem more wary, suspicious and more easily frightened of other members of their species--\nensuring that they do not allow themselves to become vulnerable (Marler, 1968). It is\nthought that the wide discrepancy in social behavior between these two species reflects\nadaptation to two very different physical and social environments (Adolfs, 2001). Not\nsurprisingly, interspecific, seasonal and reproductive variation in oxytocin concentrations\nhave been attributed ecological and adaptive significance. High levels are associated with\ntrust, love, pair-bonding and generosity in a variety of mammals (Adolfs, 2001). It would\nbe interesting to compare the details of oxytocin action--such as receptor number and\ndistribution--in solitary animals with that of people with autism.\nDiminished peripheral levels of oxytocin may cause individuals with autism to be\nborn \"expecting\" or prepared for a socially impoverished environment. Natural selection\ncannot act on behavior directly but instead acts on the neural substrates that generate the\npsychological mechanisms that create the behavior. Evolved psychological mechanisms,\nsuch as cognitive modules, are generally understood in terms of specific inputs, decision\nrules and outputs (Buss, 1995). Most of these mechanisms were naturally selected to be\nsensitive to a narrow range of perceptual information. In other words, they are biologically\nprepared to learn about or solve particular adaptive problems. Some mechanisms are\nknown to be domain-specific and many of these are assumed to exhibit variation in\nhumans, causing some people to attend to perceptual cues that others might miss entirely.\nTuning differences in domain-specific mechanisms or modules, especially those involving\noxytocin, serotonin and adrenaline, may underlie the differences in autistic cognition and,\nlike other differences seen in nature, may have been created by natural selection to help\nsolitary foragers face their particular set of recurrent or ecologically relevant threats and\nopportunities.\nIt has been shown that one or both hippocampi are often significantly larger in\nautism (Amaral et al., 2008). The hippocampus is a convergence zone that is integral to\nspatial ability, and perhaps the large size of the hippocampus in autism has neuroecological\nrelevance. The study of neuroecology focuses heavily on the relationships between\nThe solitary forager hypothesis\necological hardships, necessity for spatial ability and the size of the hippocampus\n(Garamszegi and Eens, 2004). It might make sense that a solitary forager would have to\ncompensate for the fact that it could not rely on the spatial abilities of its companions.\nIndividuals with autism have also been shown to excel at the block design subtest of the\nWechsler intelligence scales, evidence of high visuospatial abilities (Bolte, Dziobek, and\nPoustka, 2009). It may be possible that such abilities are indicative of the visuospatial or\nmnemonic rigors particular to a solitary existence.\nBrain growth is accelerated in early autism, and this may have been adaptive for a\nyoungster that was preparing to become a solitary forager. Individuals with autism have\nbeen known for years to exhibit increased head circumference and increased brain size (two\nhighly correlated traits) during infancy (Dementieva et al., 2005). Macrocephaly (head\ncircumference higher than the 97th percentile), one of the most consistently encountered\ntraits seen in autism, is known to affect between 14% and 34% of all autistic infants (Fidler,\nBailey, and Smalley, 2000). In fact, total brain size, as revealed by MRI, is on average 5-\n10% bigger in autism between 18 and 48 months of age (Mraz, Green, Dumont-Mathieu,\nMakin, and Fein,, 2007). Neonates who will develop autism and macrocephaly exhibit\nnormal head circumference at birth, but their head growth accelerates during the first year\nof life. This growth continues until at least 4 years of age, slows and then decelerates\nprematurely (Dementieva et al., 2005). This increased rate of brain maturation and growth\nslows early, well before nonautistic brains start to slow, resulting in very similar head sizes\nbetween those with autism and those without in both adolescence and adulthood (Fidler\netal., 2000). A large contributor to increased brain size in youth is myelination, and it is\nthought that different areas of the brain myelinate differentially according to an ecological\nprogram where primary sensory areas begin to myelinate first, well before association\ncortices. The dramatic increase in head circumference from birth until age 4 may be\nevidence that the learning arc for a solitary forager is not as protracted as it is for other\nchildren. Hunter-gatherer children need to laboriously and perseveringly learn a language\nalong with social morays, a time-consuming process (Kaplan et al., 2000). Researchers\nhave concluded that learning during human childhood takes so long because social\ninteractions are more variable and relatively less frequent than other forms of ecological\nlearning (Greenough, Black, and Wallace, 1987). The fact that individuals with autism\nshow this increase in head and brain size between birth and age 4 may indicate that they are\nprogrammed to learn more about their environment, faster, at an earlier age. This may also\nsuggest that autism represents a precocial (\"out of the nest early\") strategy where learning\ntakes place very early so that the animal can become independent of its mother quickly, a\ncharacteristic observed in countless nidifugous animals that do not have complex social\nlives. Consistent with this conclusion are data evincing that many males with autism\nexhibit precocious puberty (Tordjman, 1997), further evidence of a precocial as opposed to\nan altricial strategy.\nOther neurological differences particular to autism may hold neuroecological\nsignificance. Individuals with autism have been widely reported to have increased fear\nactivity in the amygdala and high levels of anxiety (Baron-Cohen et al., 2000) which might\nact to increase vigilance, caution and a healthy fear of strangers. It seems reasonable to\nassume that a solitary forager would benefit more from such caution than would an\nThe solitary forager hypothesis\nindividual who must learn to embrace companions. Some frequently reported, but only\npreliminarily researched, eccentricities in autism include acute and perceptive hearing, and\nincreased frequency of, and interest in, smelling (Leekam, Nieto, Libby, Wing, and Gould,\n2007); two features that could certainly be interpreted in a neuroethological context. Face\nprocessing, a key factor in the development of social perception, is severely impaired in\nautism (Dalton et al., 2005). The area responsible for face recognition, the fusiform face\narea, in particular has demonstrated reduced activation in autism during facial\ndiscrimination tasks (Pierce and Redcay, 2008) indicating that in autism, like in many\nsolitary animal species, identity recognition may not be as valuable. These neurological\ndifferences may be telling. If autism truly does represent a solitary phenotype, then the\nbrain abnormalities--which are highly consistent across individuals on the spectrum--\nshould furnish theoretically intriguing insights, not only into comparative cognition but\nalso into human evolution.\nImplications of the Hypothesis\nThis article has attempted, in an exploratory manner, to provide a characterization\nof autism that reconciles known findings with evolutionary theory. In the past it was not\nunderstood how individuals on the autism spectrum might have gotten along during\nprehistoric times. Yet now, a comparison with solitary species shows that autistic\nindividuals may have lived largely solitary lives and achieved self-sufficiency and\nreproductive success. Characteristics of autism that have been interpreted as consistent with\nthe solitary forager hypothesis include: the high systemizing abilities, the obsessive and\nperseverative tendencies, the repetitious and ritualistic tendencies, splinter skills, the deep\nbut narrow stores of knowledge, the parallels with orangutans and montane voles, gaze\naversion, absence of eye contact, increased hippocampal size, macrocephaly, precocious\npuberty, the testosterone effect, reduced fusiform face area and facial motor nucleus\nactivity, amygdalar sensitivity, reduced oxytocin concentrations and the sex ratio. Clearly,\nthere are exceptions to each of the lines of evidence offered here. For instance, there are\ninnumerable functional differences between the social mind of an orangutan and that of the\naverage individual with autism. The growing body of experimental literature testing the\nsocial-cognitive skills of solitary species may offer important insight into autistic traits\nthough and tell us more about the similarities and differences in these domains. It will be\nvery difficult to determine irrefutably if what we know as autism today was in fact an\nadaptive phenotype in the ancestral past. The hypothesis presented here is underspecified\nand vague but may be progressive as it is thought that analyzing disease states from an\nevolutionary perspective can ultimately do much to inform and influence medical theory\nand, ultimately, even intervention strategy (Nesse and Williams, 1995). Furthermore, the\nevolutionary perspectives delineated here could potentially provide structure for empirical\ninvestigations in animal behavior or cognitive neuroscience.\nThe case that the autism spectrum represents a solitary forager phenotype is a very\ntop-heavy argument that can and probably should be toned down in numerous ways. First,\nindividuals with autism were probably not totally solitary and may even have been better\nadapted to very small groups than to a purely solitary existence. Second, it should be\nThe solitary forager hypothesis\nemphasized that natural selection may have only been selecting for subclinical autistic traits\nand that the high-functioning corner of the spectrum may have been the substrate for\nnatural selection. Third, the most severe cases of autism may actually have been\nmaladaptive and due to assortative mating of two individuals that hold a high number of\nautism susceptibility genes. A comprehensive solitary forager theory of autism must\naddress these issues and should start by partitioning variation in autism into nosological\ncategories that represent either pathology or nature. This article has not clearly committed\nto delineating which aspects of autism are adaptive and which are not, or even committed\nto whether the lowest functioning forms could have had a place in nature. It is probably too\nearly to make these discriminations. However, it seems that if the extreme end of the\nautism spectrum was selected for, that the distribution of autism prevalence relative to\nseverity might be bimodal or have a fattened tail, yet this does not seem to be the case.\nIt is probable that other endophenotypes and genetic patterns in autism can be\nanalyzed in terms of the present hypothesis to provide convergent evidence. Eventually,\ngenetic hypothesis testing could provide near incontrovertible proof for the present\nhypothesis. Until then, comparing intron relative to exon mutations in susceptibility genes\nfor autism, mapping gene linkages, analyzing epigenetic patterns, scrutinizing genome-\nwide microarray analyses, and even looking for inter and intraspecific trends in\ngenographic data may all provide support. Further comparative behavioral studies may also\nbe revealing. It will be instructive to look for abilities in autism that more closely resemble\nforaging activities than the abilities mentioned here. Conversely, looking for\nanthropological evidence for autism-like traits among successful foragers should also be\nrevealing. It is also important to question whether the processing deficits or cognitive\nfindings in autism might have put a solitary forager at a disadvantage. In order to further\nexplicate the evolutionary roots of autism and draw new inferences with the potential to\ninform medical intervention, I encourage researchers to turn to ethology and Niko\nTinbergen's (1963) \"four questions\" in understanding the value of behavior: 1) what is the\nimmediate benefit to the organism? 2) What is the immediate consequence? 3) How does it\ndevelop in the individual across ontogeny? 4) How did it evolve in species across\nphylogeny? Knowledge about the costs and benefits of solitary existence may help to guide\neach of these lines of research.\nOliver Sacks (1970) has formulated an interesting view of autism that appears to be\nconsistent with this. He points out that the perspective of the autistic individual appears\naboriginal because they never succumb to our modern societal conventions, but that this\ndoes not keep them from perceiving, thinking and behaving in original, innovative and\nintelligent ways:\nThe autistic by their nature are seldom open to influence. It is their \"fate\" to\nbe isolated and thus original. Their \"vision,\" if it can be glimpsed, comes\nfrom within and appears aboriginal. They seem to me, as I see more of them,\nto be a strange species in our midst, odd, original, wholly inwardly directed,\nStudies in behavioral genetics have demonstrated that tendencies for cooperation,\nThe solitary forager hypothesis\ntemperament, and sociality have biological underpinnings. Furthermore, they show\nconsiderable variability within and between animal species (Frank, 1998). Tendencies for\nindependence, reclusiveness, introversion and other traits characteristic of autism certainly\nshow a great deal of variability between species (Trivers, 1985), but what about within\nthem? Perhaps populations of other social species, such as chimpanzees, have an equally\nlow but consistent prevalence of autistic individuals as well. No formal diagnostic criteria\nare available for psychiatric or even social disabilities in other animals (Wilner, 1991), but\nit would be interesting, although difficult, to see if there are analogues, or possibly\nhomologues of autism in other species. If there were homologues of autism in species\nclosely related to humans, it would be relatively easy to use molecular techniques to show\nthis given that the genes responsible could be identified. Looking at the evolutionary\nsignatures in the behavioral genetics of autism might tell us more about the variability in\nlife-history strategies of our ancestors. Many different factors could be invoked in such a\ndiscussion, including behavioral neuroscience, cognitive primatology, the importance of\ngroup membership to survival, fission-fusion sociality, mating strategies, maverick males,\npaleoneurology, parenting methods, phenotypic plasticity, sexual selection, social and\naffective neuroscience, pair bonds, territoriality, social hierarchy, and others.\nBecause humans are highly social, we like to think that complex societies\nrepresent the crowning achievement of evolution.... Indeed, if group living\nwere the universally superior lifestyle, we would expect social species to\noutnumber solitary ones, but exactly the opposite is true. Why? Almost\ncertainly because in many environments, the costs of living with others are\nHumans are an innately social and gregarious species. Their ancestral environment, like\nthat of chimpanzees, selected them to be this way (Foley and Gamble, 2009). It is probable\nthat as with all traits selected for by evolution, there are costs and benefits associated with\nsocial predispositions and that the large variation in sociability in our species reflects the\nlarge variability in selective forces in the past. The relative prevalence of autism is high\nenough to suggest that it was a phenotype that was naturally selected for in the past, but\nalso low enough to suggest that it was rarely preferable to the socially typical alternative.\nPerhaps the prevalence of the autism spectrum in modern human populations tells us\nsomething profound about the frequency of forced solitude in ancestral times, the adaptive\nvalue of social instincts and the plasticity of human cognitive strategies. Showing that\nautism had ecological viability and that it exists today because of its success in the past\nsuggests that it should not be considered a disease, but instead a condition. It should not be\nthought of as something to be ashamed of, but as something that represents individuality,\nself-determination and autonomy.\nCompeting interests: The author declares that he has no competing interests.\n"
