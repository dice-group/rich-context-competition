G6PD\ndeficiency is caused by mutations in the X-\nlinked gene, G6PD. Over 400 mutations have\nbeen reported, most of which are single amino\nacid substitutions.1 The resulting protein\nvariants have different levels of enzyme activ-\nity and are associated with a variety of\nbiochemical and clinical phenotypes, resulting\nfrom an increased vulnerability of erythro-\ncytes to oxidative damage. Clinically these\nmay present as acute haemolytic anaemia,\nchronic haemolytic anaemia or neonatal\nhyperbilirubinaemia; alternatively, patients\nmay be asymptomatic.2 The most common\nclinical manifestations are neonatal jaundice\nand acute haemolytic anaemia, both of which\nare usually triggered by an exogenous agent.1\nMost G6PD mutations occur sporadic-\nally, although the two most common forms,\nG6PD Mediterranean and G6PD A\u00c0, occur\nwith increased frequency in certain popula-\ntions.3 The polymorphic G6PD variants in\neach population have a characteristic pro-\nfile.4 For example, in African populations\nthe G6PD A\u00c0 variant (G to A at nucleotide\nexclusively the cause of G6PD deficiency,\nwhereas the G6PD Mediterranean variant\n(C to T at nucleotide 563) is the predomin-\nant form in the Mediterranean and Middle\nEast regions, and in areas of India.5 A\nnumber of additional `silent' polymorph-\nisms that do not affect the amino acid\nsequence of G6PD have been detected\nusing DNA sequencing of the G6PD gene.6\nStudying the haplotypes created by combin-\nations of these polymorphisms may be\nuseful in identifying the origin of various\nmutations.\nIn the present study, the prevalence of\nG6PD deficiency was investigated in Saudi\nmen. The frequency of the two polymorph-\nisms associated with the G6PD A\u00c0 mutation\nin an amino acid change from valine to\nmethionine at position 68) and A to G at\namino acid change from asparagine to\naspartate at position 126) \u00ad was determined\nin those found to have G6PD deficiency.\nSubjects and methods\nStudy population\nBlood samples were obtained from healthy\nmale Saudi donors from the Central\nBlood Bank, Taif, Dallah Driving\nSchool, and the blood bank of King\nAbdulaziz Specialist Hospital, Taif,\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, in the period\nMethodology is described below.\nAll samples were tested at the\nDepartment of Clinical Laboratory\nSciences, College of Applied Medical\nSciences, King Saud University, Riyadh,\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia. Written\ninformed consent was obtained from each\nstudy participant and the study was\napproved by the Ethics Committee,\nMinistry of Health, Taif, Saudi Arabia.\nScreening for G6PD deficiency\nA 6-ml venous blood sample was collected\nfrom each subject in an ethylenediaminete-\ntra-acetic acid anticoagulated tube and pro-\ncessed within 24 h of collection. From this,\n4 ml was used to screen for G6PD deficiency\nusing a Fuorescent spot test (Boehringer\nMannheim, Mannheim, Germany) accord-\ning to the manufacturer's instructions.\nG6PD deficiency was confirmed using a\nG6PD determination and quantitative test.7\nIn subjects shown to be G6PD deficient\nand in control samples (which were selected\nrandomly from subjects who had a negative\nresult on the fluorescent spot test, no family\nhistory of G6PD deficiency and no history\nof blood disease), the remaining 2 -ml blood\nsample was analysed for the presence of the\ngene. All samples were stored at \u00c080C until\nanalysis.\nDNA extraction; detection of gene\nmutations\nGenomic DNA was isolated from peripheral\nblood samples using a DNA extraction kit\n(Norgen Biotek, Ontario, Canada) accord-\ning to the manufacturer's instructions.\nExtracted DNA was then dissolved in TE\nbuffer at a concentration of $100 ng DNA/\nuntil further analysis.\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) fol-\nlowed by restriction fragment length poly-\nmorphism (RFLP) was carried out, to screen\nfor the G202A mutation on exon 4 and the\ngene. PCR was performed using 110-ng\nsamples of DNA, 2\u00c2PCR Master Mix\nreagents (Norgen Biotek) and specific pri-\nmers as used by Al-Jaouni et al.8 (Table 1).\nPrimers were synthesized by BioServe\nBiotechnologies, Hyderabad, India.\nThermal cycling (Applied Biosystems,\nBurlington, Ontario, Canada) involved pre-\nliminary denaturation at 95C for 5 min,\nfollowed by 35 cycles of denaturation at\nelongation at 72C for 45 s, followed by a\nfinal elongation step at 72C for 5 min for\nthe G202A mutation; and preliminary\ndenaturation at 95C for 5 min, followed\nannealing at 62C for 30 s and elongation at\n72C for 45 s, followed by a final elongation\nmutation.\nFor RFLP, 10 U of the restriction\nenzymes NlaIII and FokI (New England\nBioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) were incu-\nbated with 15 ml of PCR products for\n2 h. Digestion products were separated\nusing 3.5% agarose gel electrophoresis,\nstained with ethidium bromide, and\nquantified using ultraviolet transillumin-\nation.

The frequencies in\nJaizan, Al Hafouf and Khaiber,13 and in Al-\ncentages of G6PD deficiency were reported\nSaudi males, 4.76% were shown to have\nG6PD deficiency, which is low compared\nwith some other regions.\nMuzaffer10 estimated the prevalence of\nG6PD deficiency in neonates in Yanbu, in\nthe western part of Saudi Arabia, to be\n$2%. This is similar to the 2% prevalence\nreported by Niazi et al.19 from a cord-blood\nscreening programme conducted in 1992 in\nSaudi Arabia, but lower than prevalences\nreported by al-Nuaim et al.20 in the Riyadh\narea and by Nasserullah et al.21 in the Qatif\nand Al Hasa area.\nMost of the mutations found in the\ncoding region of the G6PD gene are single\nbase substitutions, leading to an amino acid\nreplacement.22 Gari et al.23 studied the\nfrequency of G6PD mutations on exons 6\nand 7 in Jeddah, in the west of Saudi Arabia,\nand reported the presence of two mutations\non exon 6 \u00ad G6PD Mediterranean and\nG6PD Sibari. The G6PD Mediterranean\nmutation is a single C to T transition at\nstrated in Mediterranean Middle East popu-\nof those found to have G6PD deficiency had\nthe G6PD Mediterranean mutation.\nHowever, other studies in the United Arab\nSaudi Arabia28 report higher frequencies for\nthe G6PD Mediterranean mutation (ranging\ncoding sequence polymorphisms, linkage\ndisequilibrium has been shown to exist\nbetween the Mediterranean C563T mutation\nand a silent C to T transition at nucleotide\nnot in Italy5 or India.29 The G6PD Sibari\nmutation, which is an A to G transition at\nthose with G6PD deficiency in the study by\nGari et al.23 The presence of this polymorph-\nism in a western Saudi population suggests\nthat there is considerable genetic heterogen-\neity in this region. A study by Al-Jaouni\net al.8 in the same region investigated poly-\nwith G6PD deficiency; G6PD Mediterranean\nwas seen in 89.1%, G6PD Aures (T to C at\n0.9%. None of the subjects showed the G6PD\nA\u00c0 mutation.8 A study by Warsy and El-\nHazmi30 identified the G6PD A\u00c0 mutationin\nthose with G6PD deficiency in various sev-\neral provinces in Saudi Arabia; the central\nprovince had the lowest frequency (0.74% in\nPreviously we reported that angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme gene polymorphism was\nassociated with G6PD deficiency;7 however,\nspecific G6PD polymorphisms were not\ninvestigated in this earlier study.\nwere screened for G6PD deficiency, of\nG6PD deficient. On molecular characteriza-\ntion, 6% of those with G6PD deficiency had\nG202A mutation, giving an overall fre-\nquency of the G6PD A\u00c0 mutation of 2%.\nHowever, this was not statistically signifi-\ncantly different compared with the fre-\nquency of this mutation in controls.\nThe findings of the present study were\nlimited by the small sample size.\nIn conclusion, the G6PD A\u00c0 variant was\nshown to occur at a low rate in a Saudi male\npopulation and does not appear to be a\nmajor cause of G6PD deficiency in this\nregion. These findings need to be confirmed\nby larger studies with more extensive\nmolecular genetic characterization.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThe authors would like to extend their sincere\nappreciation to the Deanship of Scientific\nResearch at King Saud University for its funding\nof this research through the Research Group\n"
