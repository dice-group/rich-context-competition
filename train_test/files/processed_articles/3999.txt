This line of research holds much promise in\nexplaining some of the foundational evolutionary origins of basic political orientations. Much of this recent research\nfocused specifically on skin conductance response to threatening and disgusting stimuli, however, is based on analyses\nof a data collection sample of approximately 200 study participants drawn from the same community at a single point in\ntime. Herein we attempt to reproduce many of the basic findings of recent research on skin conductance response and\npolitical behavior using data collected from a novel and unique dataset in a different context. In brief, we fail to reproduce\nmany of the basic findings from this incipient line of research which suggests that the link between skin conductance and\npolitical behavior may be more contingent than previously assumed.\n",

This research agenda has focused on the\nrelationship between physiological responses and political\nissue preferences and partisanship. A seminal work in the\nfield thus far is Oxley et al. (2008), which demonstrates that\nthose with higher physiological sensitivity to threatening\nstimuli generally tend to support more conservative politi-\ncal policies and vice versa. It suggests that those with a\nhigher threat sensitivity support conservative policies that\nseek to \"protect\" the status quo from threats. Several other\n2014) have been largely successful in demonstrating addi-\ntional evidence in support of this phenomenon, specifically\nthat a variety of political attitudes and behaviors seem to be\nclearly associated with physiological response patterns.\nThis research implies strong evidence for the evolutionary\norigins of human political behavior (see e.g. Hatemi and\nDespite these compelling findings, much of the recent\nresearch focused specifically on the relationship between\npolitical behavior and skin conductance response to threat-\nening and disgusting stimuli is based on analyses of a data\ncollection sample of approximately 200 study participants\ndescribed first by Oxley et al. (2008). The objective of this\nanalysis, then, is to attempt to reproduce1 the findings of\nsome of these early studies, specifically in regards to skin\nconductance response to threatening and disgusting stimuli,\nusing a novel and unique dataset produced in a different\ncontext. To briefly preview the findings, we are unable to\nreproduce many of the findings of previous research on the\nlink between skin conductance response and political atti-\ntudes in our novel context. This suggests that the previous\nresearch linking skin conductance and political behavior\nPhysiological responses and political\nbehavior: Three reproductions using\na novel dataset\nBenjamin R Knoll1, Tyler J O'Daniel2 and Brian Cusato3\n Keywords\nPolitical physiology, political biology, skin conductance, threat response, SCL, political behavior\n1Department of Politics, Centre College, Kentucky, USA\nGraduate School of Public and International Affairs, University of\nPittsburgh, USA\nDepartment of Psychology and Behavioral Neuroscience, Centre\nCollege, Kentucky, USA\nCorresponding author:\nBenjamin R.

Many researchers have investi-\ngated the role of emotional response and cognitive\nprocessing (see e.g. Lodge and Taber, 2005; Mutz and\nMRI and EEG brain imaging to measure differences between\nself-identified liberals and conservatives in the way they\nprocess information--especially what regions of the brain\nreact when facing a risky decision or which areas have\nincreased gray matter data (Amodio et al., 2007; Giuseffi,\nmeasured response valences and found that conservatives\nwere quicker to respond to negative images and biased\ntoward negative outcomes and situations (Carraro et al.,\net al. (2011) measured gaze cuing effects and found that lib-\nerals were more influenced by gaze cues and argued that\nconservatives value personal autonomy more so than liber-\nals and therefore are less likely to be responsive to gaze\ncues. Vigil (2010) measured facial expressions in college\nstudents and discovered that Republican sympathizers were\nmore likely to interpret faces as signaling threatening\nexpressions or dominant emotions and political affiliation\nwas independently related to perceptions of threatening\nfacial expressions, whereas the demographic variables were\nnot significantly related (see also Vigil and Strenth, 2014).\nMore recently, Adams et al. (2014) found that exposure to a\nrepugnant odor (which activates the disgust response)\nmoved subjects to be more likely to oppose socially liberal\npolitical policies, including gay marriage. (For a more com-\nprehensive treatment of the literature on physiological\nresponse and political behavior, see Hatemi and McDermott,\nOther researchers have focused specifically on physio-\nlogical threat response, as measured most often by skin\nconductance (sweat response), which is the focus of the\ncurrent study. The first major examination of the link spe-\ncifically between skin conductance levels (SCL) and politi-\nparticipants were shown a series of threatening images and\ntheir change in SCL and mean blink amplitude (intensity of\nblink response) were measured to indicate levels of physi-\nological threat arousal on the part of participants.According\nto the authors, those who exhibited lower physical sensi-\ntivities to threatening images were \"more likely to support\nforeign aid, liberal immigration policies, pacifism, and gun\nexhibited higher reactions to the same stimuli were \"more\nlikely to favor defense spending, capital punishment, patri-\nthat were interpreted by the authors as preferences for poli-\ncies that protect the status quo from threats.\nWhile research on the relationship between physiologi-\ncal response and political and social attitudes are growing,\nas far as we were able to determine as of the writing of this\nreport there have been only six additional published studies\nin peer-reviewed outlets that specifically investigate the\nlink between physiological response as measured by SCL\nand political attitudes.\nexample, both used SCL change to measure disgust sensi-\ntivity and determine its relationship to policy preferences.\nSmith, et al. (2011) determined that gay marriage was the\nonly issue significantly related to SCL change in response\nto disgusting stimuli. Similarly, Balzer and Jacobs (2011)\ndetermined that disgust sensitivity (both self-reported and\nphysiological) easily separated supporters and opponents\nof gay marriage.\nIn another study, Dodd et al. (2012) measured changes in\nboth SCL and attentiveness to the visual stimuli being pre-\nsented. They successfully reproduced Oxley et al.'s (2008)\nfinding that links SCL response to threatening images with\nconservative political orientations. They also find that com-\npared with individuals on the political left, those on the right\npay more attention to aversive stimuli and exhibit greater\nphysiological responsiveness to said stimuli.\nRenshon et al. (2014) attempted to establish a connec-\ntion between anxiety emotions and attitudes toward immi-\ngration. They found that emotions incidental to the decision\nprocess can have significant effects on immigration atti-\ntudes, and that these are mediated by levels of SCLresponse\nto anxiety-inducing stimuli. In other words, physiological\nresponses are important because they can affect the rela-\ntionship between emotions and political attitudes.\nOthers have broadened both the independent and\ndependent variables. Gruszczynski et al. (2013) broadened\nthe dependent variable to political behavior and found that,\non average, those individuals that were more physiologi-\ncally responsive to both threatening and disgusting images\nwere also more likely to participate in politics, as measured\nby a multi-item \"participation scale.\" Wagner et al. (2014)\nexamined SLC response not to threatening/non-threatening\nimages but instead to images of President Obama and found\nthat the SCL response to Obama's image predicts intensity\nof opinions toward both Obama and health care reform.\nCurrent objectives\nAs can be seen, the weight of the evidence thus far has\nestablished a clear relationship between higher skin con-\nductance response sensitivity and conservative political\nattitudes. In that light, it is important to note that the seven\nKnoll et al. 3\nstudies described in the previous section which have estab-\nlished the evidence for the relationship between SCL\nresponse patterns and political attitudes (Balzer and\nWagner et al., 2014) examined only three distinct data\nsamples. When it comes to studies examining SCL threat\nand disgust response specifically, each analyzed data col-\nlected from the same single original sample of individuals\nrecruited from the Lincoln, Nebraska area in the summer\nof 2007, although different studies feature analyses of dif-\nferent subgroups drawn from the original recruitment sam-\nSOM page 2). (See Table 1 in the Supplementary Online\nMaterials [SOM] for details on the various samples for\nthese seven studies.)\nTo bolster their generalizability, it is important that these\nfindings for SCL threat and disgust response be reproduced\nin a variety of contexts from diverse samples. Thus far the\nevidence for the link between SCL threat response and\npolitical orientations is based on a single data collection\nsample. Thus, our current objective is to determine whether\nor not these same patterns exist by attempting to reproduce\nthe same results in a different context using a unique data-\nset collected from a novel sample. We focus specifically on\nstudies examining SCL threat, non-threat, and disgust\nIn order to evaluate the generalizability of these previ-\nous findings, we conducted a skin conductance and threat\nstimuli procedure modeled after those used by previous\nresearchers in this field (Balzer and Jacobs, 2011; Dodd\nSmith et al., 2011), but varying slightly the images and\nquestion wording in the procedure as well as the sample,\nwhich consisted of 69 students recruited from both general\neducation (43%) and upper-level political science courses\n(57%) at Centre College, a selective liberal arts institution\nin the central south region of the United States. Of the\nundergraduate-aged sample, 57% were female and 43%\nmale, 55% self-identified Democrats or leaners, 38%\nRepublicans or leaners, 7% pure Independents, 50% liber-\nsubjects reported having strong opinions toward at least\nintensity of opinion toward that issue (more details availa-\nble in the SOM materials).\nIt is important to note that this procedure does not repre-\nsent a pure \"replication\" of the previous studies but rather\nan attempt to \"reproduce\" the same findings in a novel con-\ntext with slightly varying conditions in order to determine\nthe extent of their generalizability (see note 1; full details of\nthe procedure are available in the SOM). This is important\ngiven how influential this body of research has become in\nrecent years.\nWe begin with a reproduction of Oxley et al.'s (2008) find-\nings related to SCL change and political attitudes. (A full\ndescription of the reproduction procedure is included in the\nSOM.) First, we note that similar to Oxley et al. (2008),\nsubjects in our sample responded with higher mean levels\nof SCL change to threatening images than non-threatening\nrespectively), although this effect is smaller than that\nreported by Oxley et al. (2008). (Compare mean values of\nreported in Oxley et al. 2008 SOM, page 4.) This is impor-\ntant because it shows that subjects were indeed responding\ndifferently to threatening vs. non-threatening stimuli in\nterms of physiological SCL threat response, and in the\nexpected direction (see Figure 1).\nNext, we conduct difference of means t-tests to repro-\nduce the analyses regarding the relationship between change\nin SCL in response to threatening/non-threatening images\nand support for protective policies. In terms of SCLresponse\nto threatening images, we find that, contrary to Oxley et al.\n(2008), those with high levels of support for protective poli-\ncies actually have lower average levels of change in SCL\nlevels (-0.0007 logged Hz) compared to those with low lev-\nels of support (0.0055 logged Hz). We also find that this\ndifference fails to achieve statistical significance (t=1.046;\np=0.300). In terms of non-threatening visual stimuli, we\nalso find no significant difference in non-threatening SCL\nthat regress support for protective policies on threatening\nand non-threatening SCL responses.2 Table 1 shows the\nresults of the model predicting support for protective poli-\ncies (0\u00ad5 additive index scale) using SCLchange in response\nto threatening images as the key independent variable with\nFigure 1.

(2008)\nand current study.\n4 Research and Politics \ngender (female=1; male=0) and family income (9-point\nordinal variable) as controls.\nWhereas the coefficient for threatening image SCL\nchange in Oxley et al. (2008) achieved statistical signifi-\nreproduces Oxley et al. (2008) Table 2. This is identical to\nthe model displayed previously in Table 2 except that the\nkey independent variable of interest is SCL change in\nresponse to non-threatening stimuli.\nHere we observe that, in line with Oxley et al. (2008),\nthe coefficient for SCL change in response to non-threaten-\ning images fails to achieve statistical significance in pre-\ndicting support for protective policies.\nIn sum, we fail to reproduce Oxley et al.'s (2008) key\nfindings related to the relationship between SCL change in\nresponse to threatening visual stimuli and support for pro-\ntective policies in our novel context. We are, however, able\nto reproduce the finding that SCL changes in response to\nnon-threatening visual stimuli have no significant relation-\nship with support for protective policies.\nSmith et al. (2011) take a slightly different approach in ana-\nlyzing the relationship between physiological response pat-\nterns and political attitudes. In contrast to Oxley et al.\n(2008), who analyze responses to threatening visual stimuli,\nSmith et al. (2011) focus on physiological responses to dis-\ngusting stimuli. Specifically, they measure SCL change (and\nheart rate change) in response to images of a \"horribly ema-\nciated but alive body, human excrement floating in a toilet,\na bloody wound, and an open sore with maggots in it\"\n(Smith et al., 2011). They argue that the disgust response is\nimportant to understand as separate from the threat response\nbecause of its unique interaction with sociopolitical atti-\ntudes and behavior, particular through the predictions of\n\"moral foundations theory\" (Haidt, 2012; Haidt and Hersh,\ndifferent subset than that analyzed by Oxley et al. (2008).\nFirst, we observe that similar to Smith et al. (2011), sub-\njects in our study responded with increased SCL to disgust-\nreproduce Smith et al.'s (2011) first finding that SCL\nresponses to disgusting images predict self-report political\nideology. (A full description of the reproduction procedure\nis included in the SOM.) We estimate an OLS model with\nideology as the dependent variable and SCLdisgust response\nand gender as independent variables and the results are dis-\nplayed in Table 3. While the coefficient is in the right direc-\ntion (conservative = higher SCL response), the coefficient in\nNext, we attempt to reproduce the finding that the SCL\ndisgust response predicts attitudes toward gay marriage. We\nagain estimate an OLS model identical to that found in Table\n3 except substituting gay marriage attitudes for ideology as\nthe dependent variable; the results are displayed in Table 4.\nAgain, the SCL disgust response fails to significantly pre-\ndict attitudes toward gay marriage (p=0.498) and the coef-\nficient, while insignificant, is in the wrong direction (higher\nSCL response associated with more liberal gay marriage\nattitudes).\nAmong other things, Dodd et al. (2012) focus on SCL lev-\nels in response to threatening and non-threatening images\n(identical images and subject pool as described in Oxley\net al. 2008) and analyzed the relationship between SCL\nchange in response to these images and \"political\norientation\"--a scale index variable formed by combining\nself-report partisanship, ideology, preferences on 28 politi-\ncal policies, and responses to 15 \"social principles\" index\nFirst, we examine Dodd, et al.'s (2012) finding regard-\ning differences in SCL levels between those on the right\nand left side of the \"political orientation\" scale. (A full\ndescription of the reproduction procedure is included in the\nSOM.) We find no statistically significant difference\nbetween those with left and right orientations in SCL\nresponses to threatening (\"aversive\") images (t=\u00ad1.256;\nin SCL responses to non-threatening (\"appetitive\") images\nTable 1.

The model is found in Table 5 and, again, the coef-\nficient for SCL change to threatening images fails to\nIn sum, we are unable to reproduce the key findings of\nDodd et al. (2012) that changes in SCL levels in response to\nthreatening (\"aversive\") images is meaningfully related to\nbroad political orientations.\nDiscussion and conclusion\nThis analysis was able to reproduce some findings in our\nnovel context while unable to reproduce several others.\n(Table 2 of the SOM summarizes each specific finding\nfrom the literature and its reproduction result.)\nSpecifically, we successfully reproduced findings related\nto SCL response in the face of threatening, non-threaten-\ning, and disgusting stimuli, as well as the non-relation-\nship between SCL response to non-threatening images\nand political behavior. In contrast, we were unable to\nreproduce the arguably more critical findings related to\nphysiological responses to threatening images. In our\nparticular sample at least, there appears to be very little\ndiscernible relationship between responses to threatening\nor disgusting visual stimuli and attitudes such as ideology\nand political preferences. How should we interpret these\nfindings given the evidence presented in previous\nresearch demonstrating a clearer relationship between\nSCL and political attitudes?\nThe most obvious (although not exclusive3) possibility\nis that the differences between our findings and others is\ndue to the fact that the subjects in our analysis are college\nstudents while previous studies have analyzed a more rep-\nresentative sample of adults in the population who have\nmore diversity in terms of age, income, and levels of edu-\ncation. Previous research has shown that young adults are\nless crystalized in their political attitudes and show more\nvariability than older adults (Sears, 1986) and all of our\nsample were likely in their late teens or early twenties with\na heavier skew toward liberal ideological views. This may\ntherefore suggest an interactive relationship: the link\nbetween physiological response (specifically SCL threat\nresponse) and political attitudes may depend to some\nextent on subject age and its effect on the stability of politi-\ncal attitudes. That being said, Renshon et al. (2014) found\nsignificant effects of SCL anxiety (but not threat) response\non political attitudes using a sample composed of young\nadult males. Also, there is evidence that student samples\nare not wholly unrepresentative of the wider population\nwhen it comes to social science attitudes and behavior\nTherefore, we conclude that more research is warranted\nto further investigate the relationship specifically between\nSCL threat and disgust response mechanisms and political\nattitudes, as well as the extent to which these relationships\nare contingent upon factors such as political interest, age,\netc. Specifically, we call for additional reproductions of this\ndata collection procedure in a variety of contexts to deter-\nmine the extent of generalizability and ubiquity of physio-\nlogical-political relationships.\n"
