Small-\nparticle air pollution (<10 m in diameter) is especially harm-\nful to health because, once inhaled, particles can travel\nthrough the circulatory system and ultimately cause damage\nto organs, such as the heart, lungs, and brain (1). Chronic ex-\nposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution has been\nlinked to elevated risks of cardiovascular diseases, respira-\ntory diseases, and death (2\u00ad4). Emerging research suggests\nthat exposure to air pollution may also be harmful to brain\nhealth and functioning (5). Studies of animals and humans\nhave found an association between exposure to high concen-\ntrations of PM air pollution and both increased brain inflam-\nmation and accumulation of -amyloid, a marker of neuronal\ndysfunction (6\u00ad8). Individuals experiencing air pollutant\u00ad\ninduced inflammation and neurodegeneration may be more\nlikely to develop cognitive deficits (9) and may have greater\nrisk for experiencing progressive neurodegenerative diseases\nsuch as Alzheimer's disease.\nOlder adults are especially susceptible to the adverse car-\ndiovascular and respiratory outcomes associated with par-\nticulate air pollution (10, 11). However, relatively little is\nknown about the relationship between PM exposure and cog-\nnitive function in older adults. Prior studies have found that\nolder adults living in close proximity to a major road, a mea-\nsure of exposure to traffic-related PM, have worse cognitive\nfunction (12, 13). Studies of particulate matter with an aero-\ndynamic diameter of 10 m or less reported no association\nwith cognitive function (12, 14). However, in a study that ex-\namined the coarse (aerodynamic diameter 2.5\u00ad10 m) and\nfine (aerodynamic diameter 2.5 m) components of PM\nseparately, higher levels of residential exposure to both com-\nponents were associated with worse cognitive decline (15).\nFurthermore, exposure to higher concentrations of black\nAmerican Journal of Epidemiology\n\u00a9 The Author 2014.

To our knowledge, there is no existing research on the\nassociation between PM2.5\nexposure and cognitive function\nin a national sample of older US men and women. In this\npaper, we use a nationally representative sample of community-\ndwelling older adults to explore the hypothesis that living in\nareas with higher concentrations of PM2.5\nis associated with\nworse cognitive function, even after adjustment for individual-\nlevel risk factors and community-level social and economic\ncharacteristics.\nMETHODS\nData\nWe used data from the Health and Retirement Study\n(HRS), a longitudinal and nationally representative study of\nUS adults aged 50 years or older. The study sample was ob-\ntained using a stratified, multistage area probability sample\ndesign with oversampling of African Americans, Hispanics,\nand Floridians. Respondent information was obtained from\nthe RAND HRS data file, version L, which is produced by\nthe RAND Center for the Study of Aging (Santa Monica,\nCalifornia), with funding from the National Institute on\nAging (Baltimore, Maryland) and the Social Security\nAdministration (Woodlawn, Maryland). We used data from\nrespondents with a history of stroke, as well as 86 respon-\ndents who were missing data on individual-level covariates.\nRespondents who lived in census tracts that were not within\nnot be geocoded to a census tract (n = 297) were not included\nin the analysis, because their exposures to PM2.5\ncould not be\nascertained. In addition, 1,222 respondents who had a proxy\ncomplete the interview, and thus whose cognitive function\nwas not directly assessed, were excluded from the analytical\nsample. Implications of missing PM2.5\nand cognitive data are\ndiscussed in more detail in the results section. The final ana-\nyears or older.\nAir pollution data came from the US Environmental Pro-\ntection Agency's (EPA's) Air Quality System, a national net-\nwork of air monitoring stations that collects data on air\npollutants. Data on census tract\u00adlevel air pollution for 2004\nwere obtained from RAND's Center for Population Health\nand Health Disparities Data Core Series (17). Measures of\ncensus tract\u00adlevel social and economic characteristics are\nfrom the 2000 census. Pollution and census data were linked\nto HRS respondents using census tract identifiers.\nMeasures\nCognitive function. The HRS measure of cognitive func-\ntion is based on the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status\n(18) and has been validated for use in population surveys\nconducted in person and by telephone (19). Approximately\n72% of the sample received the cognitive assessment in\nface-to-face interviews, and the remainder completed the as-\nsessment by telephone. Cognitive function was assessed on a\n35-point scale that sums scores on immediate and delayed\n10-noun free-recall tests to measure memory, a serial 7 sub-\ntraction test to measure working memory, a backwards count-\ning test to measure processing speed, recall of the date and\nname of the president and vice president to measure orienta-\ntion, and an object naming test to measure knowledge and\nlanguage. Participants under age 65 years were not assessed\non the orientation and object naming tests because the\n\"young old\" generally answer all items correctly. To con-\nstruct a total cognitive function score for all respondents,\nwe assigned full points on these tests to those younger than\nWe also created measures for 2 separate components of\ncognitive function measured in the HRS: episodic memory\nand mental status. The numbers of correctly recalled words\nin the immediate and delayed recall tests were summed to cre-\nate a total episodic memory score that ranges from 0 to 20.\nCorrect answers on the remaining tests were summed to cre-\nate a mental status score that ranges from 0 to 15. Previous\nanalysis of cognition in the HRS suggests that episodic mem-\nory and mental status represent 2 distinct factors and should\nbe investigated separately (19).\nAir pollution. Census tract\u00adspecific concentrations of\nported by monitors within a 60-km radius of each census\ntract centroid. Values from each monitoring station were\nweighted using the inverse of the distance from the census\ntract centroid to the location of the monitor to give greater\nimportance to values reported by monitors closer to the re-\nspondents' census tracts. The daily means were then aggre-\nconcentration.\nCovariates. Individual-level covariates include socio-\ndemographic and socioeconomic characteristics, as well as\nsmoking status. Sociodemographic information included\nage, sex, and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, Hispanic, other). Socioeconomic measures\nincluded educational attainment, which was assessed as the\nhighest completed grade of school or year of college; current\nemployment status; and logged household income and\nwealth. Smoking behavior was included (never smoker, for-\nmer smoker, current smoker). Census tract\u00adlevel covariates\ninclude the proportion of residents aged 25 years or older\nwithout a high school degree and median household income\n(logged).\nAnalytical strategy\nWe used multilevel linear regression models to examine\nthe association between PM2.5\nand cognitive function. On av-\nerage, there were 3 sample members living in a tract (13,996\nrespondents living in 4,577 tracts), with only 13% of sample\nmembers living in a singleton tract (i.e., a tract with no other\nsample members). Thus, most sample members were clus-\ntered in tracts and, therefore, had similar ambient air pollu-\ntion exposures. We used multilevel models to account for\nthe clustering of respondents within census tracts (20). For\nboth the total cognitive function score and the 2 subcompo-\nnents, 3 models are presented. Model 1 includes adjustments\nfor tract-level covariates and individual sociodemographic\ncharacteristics. Model 2 adds individual socioeconomic sta-\ntus. Model 3 adds smoking status. Analyses were conducted\nusing Stata, version 12, software (StataCorp LP, College Sta-\ntion, Texas) and HLM, version 6.06, software (Scientific\nSoftware International, Inc., Skokie, Illinois). In all analyses,\nwe used sample weights that adjust for differential sampling\nprobabilities and nonresponse and make the sample represent-\native of the older US population.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 shows individual-level characteristics of the sam-\nple. The average age of the sample was 64 years. There were\nmore women than men, most were non-Hispanic white, and\ntheir average educational attainment was just above high\nschool level. Average income and wealth showed consider-\nable variability in this sample. Just more than half of the sam-\nple was not working, and most did not smoke. The average\ncognitive function score was approximately 24, which is in\nthe normal range.\nBecause the association between cognitive function and\nappeared to be nonlinear, we divided PM2.5\ninto quar-\nm3) in the tracts in which respondents lived.

Nearly half of sample members\nlive in areas where PM2.5\nconcentrations exceed the air qual-\nity standard.\nThe distribution of sample characteristics is shown sepa-\nrately for each PM2.5\nquartile in Table 2. The proportion of\nresidents with less than a high school degree is higher in\nmore polluted areas. However, residents in more polluted\nareas also have higher average income than those in less pol-\nluted areas. Those living in more polluted areas were younger\nand less likely to be white. Education and income show a cur-\nvilinear relationship with PM2.5\n, suggesting that those with\nthe highest levels of education and income lived in both the\nleast and most polluted areas. A higher percentage of those\nliving in the most polluted quartiles were not working and\nwere current smokers. Cognitive function was lower among\nthose living in areas with higher exposure.\nTable 3 presents the multilevel regression models of cog-\nnitive function.

First, because res-\nidents' exposure to ambient air pollution may depend on the\ntotal number of years they have lived in an area, we examined\nmodels that adjusted for the length of time at residence.

We found no evidence of\ninteractions between PM2.5\n, sociodemographic factors, or so-\ncioeconomic factors (P for all interactions < 0.01). However,\ninteractions between PM2.5\nand smoking status suggest that\ncurrent smokers in the second quartile of exposure had worse\ncognitive function than nonsmokers in the same quartile and\neither smokers or nonsmokers in the bottom quartile of expo-\nsure (P for interaction = 0.04).\nWe also considered the potential influence of missing\nand cognitive function data on the reported findings.\nFirst, we performed logistic regressions using individual-\nlevel sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables to\npredict missingness of cognitive function data and PM2.5\ndata (i.e., 1 = missing, 0 = not missing).

Although\nwe do not have information about PM2.5\nexposure for indi-\nviduals who do not live in close proximity to an air monitor,\nwe can assign these individualsto the lowest exposure quartile\nunder the assumption that the EPA does not place monitors in\nareas with low PM2.5\nconcentrations. Assigning individuals\ndata to the lowest quartile did not change\nour findings.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this cross-sectional study of older US men and women,\nwas associated with cognitive function\nafter adjustment for community social characteristics and\nindividual social, demographic, economic, and health charac-\nteristics. We did not find a linear association between PM2.5\nand cognitive function. Those living in areas with the highest\nexposure in our sample did not have the worst cognitive func-\ntion. Rather, the data indicate that living in areas with annual\nconcentrations that exceed EPA air quality standards is\nharmful to older adults' cognition. To put our findings in per-\nspective, we found that living in more polluted areas was as-\nsociated with a decrease in cognitive function that is similar\nto a 1.7- to 2.8-year difference in age in our data. We did not\nfind much support for effect modification by individual-level\ncharacteristics. However, our results suggest that, at relatively\nconcentrations, cognition may be worse among\nolder adults who smoke.\nSeparate analyses of 2 subcomponents of cognitive func-\ntion suggest that it is episodic memory that is adversely af-\nfected by exposure to PM2.5\n. Episodic memory impairment\nis 1 of the core diagnostic criteria used to determine mild cog-\nnitive impairment and dementia in older adults (23), and it\nhas been suggested that impairments in this aspect of mem-\nory represent some of the earliest signs of dementia (24).\nThus, exposure to PM may have the most significance for\ncognition in healthy older adults who have not yet demon-\nstrated cognitive impairment.\nTo our knowledge, this is 1 of only a handful of studies to\nconsider the association between air pollution and cognitive\nfunction in older adults and the first to do so using a nation-\nally representative sample of older men and women. Most of\nthe existing evidence for a link between air pollution and cog-\nnitive function comes from studies of younger populations (9,\n25, 26). Yet there is now growing evidence of the importance\nof air pollution for the aging brain, as well. This study adds to\nexisting research on air pollution and cognition in older\nadults by demonstrating that the pollution-cognition link ob-\nserved in prior studies of select populations (12\u00ad16) is also\npresent in a broader sample of older US men and women.\nThe current study has several limitations. There were sub-\nstantial missing data on both cognitive function and PM2.5\n.\nBecause we excluded older adults who were institutionalized\nor had proxy-assisted interviews, the study findings are some-\nwhat biased toward a cognitively intact older adult popula-\ntion. Our analysis of the characteristics of those with and\nwithout cognitive data confirms that our analytical sample\ndiffers in several ways from those with missing cognitive\ndata. However, our findings were unchanged after imputing\ncognitive function for these individuals and including them\nin the analytical sample. We also excluded from our analyses\nthose individuals for whom PM2.5\nexposure could not be de-\ntermined. These individuals also differed in systematic ways\nfrom the analytical sample. However, we found the same pat-\ntern of results when we included those with missing PM2.5\ndata in the lowest exposure quartile.\nTable 4.

Although out-\ndoor pollution may be an important contributor to overall ex-\nposure, pollution exposure may also occur in other contexts,\nsuch as in the workplace or during daily road travel. How-\never, most of our sample members were not employed, so\noutdoor residential pollution concentrations may be a good\napproximation of their total exposure. In addition, previous\nresearch has found high correlations between outdoor\nexposure and both indoor and personal PM2.5\nexposure\n(27). This is likely due to relatively small spatial variability in\nconcentrations within urban areas. Thus, even though\nwe use a measure of outdoor PM2.5\nfrom pollution monitors,\nwe are also likely measuring a good portion of personal ex-\nposure. Moreover, we did not have data on long-term pollu-\ntion exposure, though our measure may reflect some degree\nof longer-term air pollution. Pollution levels are highly cor-\nmeasured in a given year and levels mea-\nsured 1 and 4 years prior, respectively. PM2.5\nmeasured in a\ngiven year has also shown a high correlation ( = 0.89) with\nestimated levels from 10 years prior (15).\nThis study examined cognition with respect to only the fine\nfraction of PM and did not consider the coarse fraction of PM,\nwhich has been linked to cognitive decline in prior research\n(15). Although we found an association between PM2.5\nand\ncognitive function, we are not able to determine what compo-\nare primarily responsible for the association.\nis a complex mixture of several components, including\ncarbon and metals (28), and it remains unclear which compo-\nnent, or components, are responsible for the adverse health\n.

This is supported by studies of cognition that have\nfound associations with black carbon, a traffic-related com-\nAlthough we included a number of community- and\nindividual-level covariates in our models, we were unable\nto account for other potentially important confounders, such\nas diet and cognitive engagement, which are thought to be\nkey risk factors for poor cognitive function in old age. Fi-\nnally, this study examined cross-sectional associations and,\nthus, causal pathways between air pollution and cognitive\nfunction in older adults cannot be determined. However, an\nassociation between PM air pollution and cognitive decline\nhas been established in previous research using data from\nthe Nurses' Health Study (15).\nThe concern over the health effects of fine PM air pollution\nis growing. Fine particles are small enough that they can pass\nthrough the throat and nose and ultimately enter the lungs and\nbrain (30). Inhaled particulates can affect the respiratory and\ncardiovascular systems, with potential consequences for vas-\ncular pathology in the brain, and they may even directly cause\ndamage to brain structure and physiology. Studies of both\nhumans and animals have confirmed that exposure to PM is\nlinked to harmful changes in brain health and functioning.\nThe biological evidence, as well as findings from population-\nbased studies, including the study presented here, provides\nfurther indication that air pollution plays an important role\nin brain aging.\nThe population of older adults living in large metropolitan\nareas is growing rapidly (31). Although air pollution levels\nhave declined in recent years (32), older residents of many\nUS cities continue to breathe air that is harmful to their\nhealth. In 2013, the EPA lowered the air quality standard\nconcentrations below 15 g/m3 was associated\nwith worse cognition in older adults. Efforts to further reduce\nconcentrations in accordance with the recent EPA stan-\ndard may have beneficial consequences for the cognitive\nhealth of the aging US population.\n"
