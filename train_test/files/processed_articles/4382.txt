Yet\nwhat has often been lacking in cross-country comparisons is a critical socio-historical analysis of\ncontingent nation-specific events and features as well as an in-depth analysis of Finnish education\npolitics as constantly changing dynamic system. We analyze and reconstruct the discursive\nnarrative of Finnish comprehensive education within a socio-historical framework. The material\nconsists of interviews with the establishment of Finnish education: politicians, leading policy-\nmakers and stakeholders, and established scholars (n=9). Three periods were recognized and\nreconstructed in the analysis: 1) The pre-comprehensive school period, 2) a steady development\nculminating in the crisis of the 1990s, and 3) the PISA results, which in the narrative led to\ninternational success and national gridlock. The crucial changes relate to changes in audiences\n(performing game). Two key findings emerge from this discursive narrative analyses: the role of\nthe PISA reports as a turning point for the basic education politics in Finland and how this turn\nled to a discussion of comprehensive school as a kind of success story.\n",

In recent years, Finnish\ncomprehensive education has often been discussed in both academic and public forums in terms of\nCorresponding author:\nAssistant Professor Sonja Kosunen, Faculty of Educational Sciences, University of Helsinki, PO Box 9, 00014, Finland.\nEmail: Sonja.kosunen@helsinki.fi\nGeneral submission\nits relatively high learning outcomes and perceived efficiency. This discussion has been based on\ncross-country surveys and reports, such as PISA (OECD, 2009), and is related to the relatively\nuniform quality of learning outcomes in the schools measured in these reports which have attracted\ninternational attention. In a way, Finland has become a reference society, an idealized and glorified\nmodel for educational policy-makers and media around the world (Steiner-Khamsi, 2004;\nTakayama et al., 2013; Waldow et al., 2014). With this article we seek to reconstruct the narrative\nof Finnish comprehensive education that is being generated in the current times by the powerful\nactors of education politics in Finland.\nIn transnational policy-borrowing processes, technical solutions such as learning content and\nschool management principles are used as `input' to explain `outputs' such as PISA (e.g. Takayama,\n2010). What has often been lacking in cross-country comparisons are the critical socio-historical\nanalyses of contingent nation-specific events and features (Phillips, 2002; Simola, 2004; Steiner-\nKhamsi, 2013), and an in-depth analysis of politics as a constantly changing and dynamic system.\nOnly recently has Finnish research literature started to focus on these issues (e.g. Simola et al., 2017).\nThis study endeavours to fill this gap by analysing the discursive narrative of Finnish compre-\nhensive education. The research task is to reconstruct the narrative of Finnish comprehensive\nschooling from the storylines derived from the interviews with the educational establishment and\nexamine the story from a discourse analytical perspective. Our research questions are:\n1. Through which discursive formations is the narrative of Finnish comprehensive education\nconstructed throughout time?;\n2. Which actors are pointed out as the ones defining and redefining the direction of compre-\nhensive education politics?; and\n3. What are the central events in the narrative with their contextual influences on national and\ninternational level?\nThe material consists of interviews with the establishment in Finnish education: politicians, lead-\ning policy-makers and stakeholders, and established scholars (n = 9). In this study we are interested\nin how the narrative of Finnish comprehensive education is constructed and how this reflects the\nchanging relations of key actors in education politics. The article contributes to the current discus-\nsion of the socio-historical formation and development of Finnish comprehensive education (e.g.\nM\u00f8lstad and Karseth, 2016; Simola et al., 2017) and education policy and politics in general\nThe legislative development of Finnish comprehensive education\nAs in all Nordic countries, in Finland the idea of `one school for all', where all children, regardless\nof social background, gender, ethnicity and place of residence, study in similar schools, has tradi-\ntionally been a guiding principle in organizing education for nation building, social change and the\nin Finland is often considered as one of the cornerstones of the country's basic education. Following\nKivinen (1998), from a legislative perspective the systematization of Finnish comprehensive edu-\ncation can be summarized in five milestones:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\nHowever, the processes leading to these legislative changes were lengthy and multifaceted.\nThe legislative actions from the 1850s through the 1980s gradually increased the regulative role\nof the state (Ahonen, 2003). In contrast to the relatively uniform comprehensive school system\nrescind the state regulation of public education (Ahonen, 2003; Varjo, 2007). First, the changes in\nthe statutory government transfer (in 1984) and the Committee on Government Decentralisation\n(in 1986) made it possible for municipalities to decide how much money to invest in education.\ning the idea and practice of parental school choice in Finland. In addition, both the Task Force for\nOverall Reform of School Legislation (1993\u00ad1995) and the Committee for Overall Reform of\nSchool Legislation (1996\u00ad1998) ended up suggesting the implementation of more freedom for\nNational Curriculum Guidelines in the 1990s (POPS, 1994) gave local schools and teachers more\nfreedom to decide on pedagogical methods, and even content (Ahonen, 2003; Varjo, 2007).\nAlthough in the recent curricula (POPS, 2004; 2014) the content and goals of comprehensive\neducation have again been expressed in more detail (e.g. Sivesind et al., 2016), the internationaliza-\ntion and decentralization of education have moved the political control from the state to more or less\ntemporal networks of different educational stakeholders (Hansen, 2016). Instead of chasing the\nunity of the state a priori, the focus should be shifted to those social rules, known truths, techniques\nand networks of references through which the state is constituted in its socio-historical context (e.g.\nand strategic use of the past in the current discursive formations.\nThe study\nThe research task was to analyse how the narrative of Finnish comprehensive education is constructed,\nthrough which mediators, power relations and influences it is described, and what are the events that are\ngiven a central role in creating the narrative. The focus of the study remains on what kind of Finnish\ncomprehensive education narrative is described in the discourse over time. The narrative is understood\nas a powerful discursive practice in policy-making into which knowledge is encoded in the form of a\nstory and which is a form of basic understanding of phenomena (see Schank and Abelson, 1995). Our\nfocus is on narrative mediators, power relations and social networks, and on the events that are given a\ncentral status (which we call a `thickening'in the storyline) in the creation of the narrative. In addition,\nwe look at what kind of audience the story targets each time and how these changes influence the poli-\ntics concerning comprehensive education in the narrative.\nThe interviewees, invited to the interviews as `educational experts', were asked to tell `the story\nof the Finnish comprehensive school (peruskoulu)'as they saw it, and to reflect in particular on the\nFigure 1. The timeline presented in the interview.\ndifferent actors involved in its formation. The interviews lasted between one and two hours. The\noutline was that of a stimulus interview, where a timeline (Figure 1) was shown to the interviewee\nin order to provide a stimulus and structure to the otherwise fairly open thematic interview.\nIn every instance, the interviewee decided the year with which to start, with one exception,\nwhich required a restriction; in that case the interviewer specified a point of departure in the 1970s.\nThe starting point of the story varied from the French Revolution to the twentieth century. Several\nfollow-up questions were asked once the interviewees had finished telling the story as they saw it.\nThe interviewees (n = 9) were members of the establishment in Finnish education, i.e. long-term\npoliticians (n = 2), policy-makers and administrative leaders (n = 3), other central stakeholders\n(n = 2), and scholars (n = 2), all of whom have or had the role of specialist in governmental bodies\ndealing with comprehensive education in Finland. Both men (n = 5) and women (n = 4) were inter-\nviewed. The interviews were first conducted with long-term researchers, who were identified by a\nliterature review on the topic. We chose the remaining informants based on a snowball sampling:\nwe asked each interviewee for names of other people who should be interviewed on the topic of\ndevelopment of basic education politics and comprehensive education in Finland. The number of\nkey informants saturated in the interviews, as the same actors were repeatedly mentioned at least\non the level of their institution. Thus, as a pragmatic methodological decision, we decided to\nrestrict the number of interviewees to these nine.\nAlthough the number of interviews is relatively small, the central stakeholders from different\nbranches of education politics were involved. In addition, a research tradition of elite interviews\n(Harvey, 2011) was acknowledged in gathering the data. The central actors in basic education politics\nin the Finnish context include a variety of individuals, public institutions, third sector organizations,\nunions and other kinds of stakeholders as well as enterprises from the private sector. In the interviews,\nthe relationship is discussed between the government (especially the Ministry of Education and\nCulture), the Finnish parliament (with a few MPs in particular mentioned often), the National Board\nof Education, the unions, universities (with a few specific researchers given multiple mentions), pri-\nvate enterprises (such as companies that provide private tutoring) and international organizations\n(such as the OECD, the EU and the Nordic Council of Ministries). We interviewed central actors who\nwere currently or had previously been in powerful positions in comprehensive education politics and\npolicy-making. In addition, coverage of interviewees from different ends and the middle field of the\npolitical stratum was introduced. Only one invited interviewee declined the interview request.\nThe interview material was gathered in a relatively short time, one year (2015-2016), and is\nintended to deepen the understanding of how those who often have the power of telling the story of\ncomprehensive schooling in public actually construct the narrative. The material was gathered prior\nto the (then) newly published PISAresults in December 2016, where Finland's position had dropped.\nIn order to increase the consistency and reduce the obvious variance of time and space of the con-\nducted interviews in this study, the interviews were gathered during a relatively short period of time\n(one year) during which no major events or happenings (such as publication of rankings or major\nreforms) took place. The interviews were also conducted in similar places, i.e. only at the university\nor the interviewee's office, which as environments made the interview situations resemble each\nother. The interviewers were aware of the requirements of aiming to repeat the interviews as similar\nsituations as best as possible, in order to increase the trustworthiness of the study.\nThe conceptual analysis of the material follows the guidelines of narrative discourse analysis. This\nanalytical approach was chosen in order to better grasp the power in the discourses that are socially\nconstructed in the stories. In the field of governance studies, storytelling is widely understood as a\ntechnique in which social identities, forms of rationality and political strategies can be transmitted\nwithout the attention or direct control of self-governing actors or organizations (S\u00f8rensen, 2006).\nRhodes (2011: 289) identifies three characteristics of storytelling. The first, the language game, for-\nmulates the storyline and answers the questions of what has happened and why. The second function,\nthe performing game, refers to the idea that, in order to be influential, stories must be told differently\nfor different audiences. Third, the story always implies a management game. Stories are seen as a way\nto connect the past experiences and future expectations. (Rhodes, 2011; see also Lyotard, [1984]\n1979) In other words, stories are told to co-opt, hide and open up the contingency of social reality.\nFollowing Schank and Abelson (1995), we consider stories as the basis of understanding, which\nis encoded in the account. Thus, the idea of asking for the `story of the Finnish comprehensive\nschool' has been an attempt to capture a certain form of understanding of this phenomenon.\nH Porter Abbott (2009; 2011) discusses the mutual relations of stories, discourses and narratives.\nHis main idea is that the story is what is explicitly being asked in the interviews: the aim is to\ninvestigate the historical continuation of events and the social function of the narrative. The story\ncan be analytically divided into events, such as acts (intentional) and happenings (unintentional).\nIn practice, the distinction between intentional and unintentional can be hard to grasp, given its\ncontingency, but in narrative analysis this distinction provides tools.\nThe analysis of intentionality within the frame of discursive analyses is of course challenging\n(see Van Dijk, 2006); however, the context within which certain events are described as intentional\nis vital, as well as the interpretation of the speakers' position in relation to the content. The biggest\nchallenge methodologically would be the assumption of intentionality in the speech, which would\nrequire making assumptions about the speakers' mental models (see Van Dijk, 2006: 128). In this\nstudy we have made use of Van Dijk's (2006) analytical solution of focusing only on the overall\ntopics of discussion, and the descriptions of them historically being intentionally or unintentionally\nconducted, rather than concentrating on the syntactic structure or intonation of the speech. We need\nto emphasize that the analysis aims to reveal only the ways of describing the different moments on\nthe storyline by the interviewees, who sometimes explicitly described some of the moments as hap-\npenings, which no-one had presumed according to their content. Thus, making judgements about\nwhether some of the events were actually intentional or unintentional remains out of the scope and\ninterest of this study, given these methodological presuppositions. However, it is worth noting that\nmany of the interviewees were themselves involved in the processes mentioned in the story and\nwere originally communicating about them further to the public, nationally and internationally.\nBevir and Rhodes (2012) suggest that recovering stories is an excellent method for fine-grained\nresearch. Stories are told in order to co-opt, hide and open up the contingency of social reality.As stated,\nwe set out not only to look at the story and the events included in it, but also to concentrate on how the\nstory was told (discourses in socio-historical space\u00adtime) and what are considered its implications in\npolicy-making as a social practice. We focus on how the story is told as a historical continuation, what\ncausalities and reasons for the events are constructed, and what external influences are perceived as\ncontributing to the development of Finnish comprehensive education. As an analytical practice, we\nreconstructed an individual storyline, including all the events mentioned, for each interviewee and spec-\nified the common events, acts and happenings in the different stories. The changes in the audiences and\ngiven importance of the events and their influences were then analysed. These questions are becoming\nmore and more important, especially in times of international learning assessments, indicators and edu-\ncational exports, because the power of the narrative of Finnish comprehensive education seems to serve\nas a vital force in profit-making by exporting education from Finland (Sepp\u00e4nen et al., in press).\nAs an analytical unit, the settings should be detached from the general outline of the story. Here,\ntoo, the concepts of double temporality (see Bhabha, 1996; Farred, 2004) and double spatiality (or\n`doubled by spatial deixes'; Masemola, 2011) are acknowledged: there is a time about which the\nstory is told and a time when the story is told. There is also a place about which the story is told and\na place where it is told. Traditional analysis focuses on investigating what is told in a story, but the\nways of telling the story should also be given full consideration (investigating the narrative: who and\nwhich institutions become part of the story, by which means, who is left out, whose influence is con-\nstructed as superficial and whose power as hidden, but strong, to mention but a few possibilities).\nThickenings and periods in the narrative\nThe story of Finland's comprehensive schooling was constructed by the interviewees from a fairly\nunanimous viewpoint. For example, the differences in political positions did not produce signifi-\ncantly different events in the storyline, an outcome that could well be considered surprising. The\nstarting points of the story, left undefined by the interviewers, varied in time. Some of the inter-\nviewees started their story in the Enlightenment;1 some began in the 1970s when comprehensive\nschools were in fact established. As one might expect, the researchers interviewed tended to begin\nin the earlier years, whereas the politicians and other stakeholders concentrated mainly on the\nperiod after the Second World War.\nThe events (the unintentional happenings and the intentional acts) were also described with dif-\nferent terminology by different storytellers. In the analysis of the events discussed in all the inter-\nviews, nine different chronologically organized and consistent themes emerged. The timeframe\nranged from the Enlightenment to 2015. Not all interviewees discussed all of these years, but these\nwere the `thickening' points in the story. We organized time periods around points at which some-\nthing new and significant happened, either because of intentional political decision-making or by\nchange, as described by the interviewees:\n1. Ideas and ideologies of the Enlightenment, nationalism and Bildung2;\n2. The beginning of social democracy as the basis of a political party in Finland;\n3. The period from the Second World War in Finland until 1968: the growing influence of a\nleft\u00adcentre political coalition;\n4. Preparation and birth of the comprehensive school: provision of research support and polit-\nical friction with the previous early stage selection in a dual system (Folk School/grammar\nschool);\n5. Ten years of egalitarian and uniform comprehensive school;\n6. The slow slide towards the 1990s and economic depression: major cuts in public spending,\ndiscursive change and a political turn;\n7. Developing the school in line with international trends in education: panic about the quality\nof the comprehensive school and political pressure from the Confederation of Finnish\nIndustries; and\n8. PISA report: `turning the boat', fixing minor issues and trying to maintain the schools and\nthe image despite declining results in Finnish students' performance.\nEvents 3, 4, 5 and 7 were described as intentional acts, and the rest rather as happenings. After\nidentifying these eight events, we re-analysed the stories by focusing on the time periods,\nwhich all start and end with a thickening in the storyline, where relevant events and happenings\ntake place. These thickenings in the narrative are moments when the story experiences an\nunchangeable turn and a new discursive compilation starts. We have named the eras between\nthe thickenings the `time periods', which thus comprise several events and have their starting\nand ending points in thickenings in the story. Altogether, three periods were recognized and\nreconstructed in the analysis:\n1. The first period, including themes 1\u00ad3, is called the Pre-comprehensive school period\n(\u00ad1970), during which the events and actors' intentions were for nine years of compulsory\nschooling for all children nationwide;\n2. The second period comprises events 4-7 and is called From steady development to the first\n3. The last period, called PISA as an international performance game (event 8), begins at\nthe turn of the millennium and focusses mainly on public and behind-the-scenes discus-\nsion of the PISA evaluations. What enabled the analysis of this language game further\nwas the concentration on the performing game: the change of audience in each period in\nthe story, resulting in the construction of a different narrative.\nWe present below the central events, actors and politicizations of the content of each analytically\nreconstructed thickening. We analyse the potential of changing the direction of education politics,\nleading to reconstruction of the story of comprehensive education politics in the analysed material.\nThe pre-comprehensive school period: equality in education for a national audience\nin a Nordic setting\nThe first thickening in the storyline concerned the somewhat long line of emergence of a compre-\nhensive school system, which comprised the period after the Second World War in Finland until\n1968 (puitelaki or the Framework Law): it was crucial in terms of the discussions of the compre-\nhensive school. Ideas and ideologies of the Enlightenment and nationalism were described as the\nstarting points of the whole development, resulting in the political debate about elementary schools\n(kansakoulu) and finally the construction of a comprehensive school (peruskoulu).\nIn the 1930s the political climate was all in all tight, so that this discussion [on combining the dual school\nsystem into a uniform system] was difficult and started off again after the [Second World] war, when the left-\nwing gets out of jail and comes from the other side of the [Russian] border. And then it took another few\ncommittees before they reached the stage that the 1968 law was given. And that story can be told in so many\nways. [Pasi] Sahlberg has told it in his own way with the name Finnish Lessons, which is a hero story of a kind,\nand then there ... is this Miracle named book, which tells of a very straightforward development, but I consider\nthis to be far more complex, and often things happen due to world-political happenings. (Researcher 2)\nThen we come to the Second World War: There is this myth that Finns grew into a very solid community.\n... but after the war there was this spirit that these citizens who had fought on the front line for the\nfatherland, they need, and they deserve, a long, common basic education. (Researcher 1)\nThe common basic education (yleinen pohjasivistys) refers here to the German concept of\nBildung. The interviewee uses the concept here to indicate the turning point, how previously\nexclusive Bildung starts to belong to everyone regardless of their future educational path. This\nidea of Bildung `for all' was considered to be a cornerstone for the development which later lead\nto the birth of comprehensive school system.\nThe elementary school actually broke the ice, and there was an ideologically strong conception that this\n[elementary school] is the basis of the national ascent. And then came the law of comprehensive education,\nwhich made it stable, the whole thing, which helped then of course in spreading the comprehensive school\nto the whole country. And that's what our PISA results are based on. (Administrative Leader 2)\nThe beginning of the twentieth century, according to the story, was a time when Bildung, national-\nism and the beginning of social democracy in the form of a political party influenced the develop-\nment of elementary schooling. Socio-democratic ways of constructing elementary schools were\noriginally borrowed from Sweden, as a result of study trips made by a few politicians, and devel-\noped in Finland into an even larger egalitarian system of education than the original. In this narra-\ntive, the Finnish school was constructed as a national project with a national audience, with\ninfluences borrowed mainly from Sweden with regard to educational governance and from\nGermany regarding a didactic tradition.\nThe story of the parliamentary process in the events leading to comprehensive schooling was\ndiscussed mainly by the researchers interviewed. They questioned vigorously the narrative of pure\nconsensus in constructing the comprehensive school: a great deal of contingency, forms of uninten-\ntional happenings and multifaceted political games were also involved. A central element in the\nnarrated events was that academics were introduced into the narrative, and the evidence base in\nconstructing comprehensive schooling was emphasized.\nIf I start with the discussion that gave birth to the comprehensive school. ... I ... heard a lot of calls [at the\nuniversity] from the Ministry of Education. ... The main goal established in those discussions was to\ncreate more societal equality through education, and what was hammered home with all students ... was\nthat this reform is highly political, and important educational experts had been gathered to support the\nreform. And there was a major part of the professors by then. Not all, though.... however, equality was a\ngoal, and it was mainly because of this left-central combination having a strong standing point in the\nsociety then. (Administrative Leader 1)\nIn the law of 1968, it was said that the practices and structures and so on in these schools needed to be\ndeveloped in such a way that learning is not dependent on the [child's] socio-economic background, place\nof residence or gender. And this could be read as, `Ahaa! It says here that everyone can learn everything'.\nAnd that was not stated in any of the political documents about the comprehensive school, but it was read\nin this way. (Researcher 1)\nThe narrative about this era included a counter-narrative to the hegemonic discourse of unanimous\ndecision-making regarding construction of the comprehensive school, and it emphasized the politi-\ncal struggles and negotiations of power: what was evident was that it was impossible to resist the\naim of promoting equality of education in that political climate.\nIn the 1960s\u00ad1970s there was a fundamental fight about who should have power in education. Does it\nbelong to a totalitarian system, or could parents and regions and local communities have some kind of a\nsolution [to give there].... our educational politics was then very left-central, and if you supported private\nschools and 100-year-old grammar schools, which have a right to stay in this community, then you were a\nterrible capitalist and bourgeois and whatever, and these were used in hitting back at these old grammar-\nschool men. And if you made any criticism of the idea that everyone can learn everything and integration\nalways produces excellent outcomes, then you were reactionary and behaviourist, and they were hammered\npretty hard there too. (Researcher 2)\nThe emergence of the comprehensive school was thus supported in the narrative by research and\nstill included traces of political disagreement with the previous dual system (the grammar school\nvs. the elementary school). However, the decision was then made official by a political qualified\nmajority, because the actual act that took place in Finland was eventually unanimously agreed\nupon: an essential law was enacted in 1968.\nFrom one side, it seemed that there was a double bind in the discussion of the emphasis on aca-\ndemics: discussing the cultural shift in research and a move from more behavioural theories\ntowards more constructionist ones, as well as ideological questions concerning equality and power\nin which these two sides (at least) seemed to discuss the issue from different positions, with hardly\nany actual meeting point. However, in terms of the settings presented, this part of the story (when\ntold some decades later) was offered as the basis for the success of the Finnish comprehensive\nschool, because it was supported by research:\nI personally think that the central idea of this success story is that it was not only a political reform, but\n[also] was strongly supported by the folks at universities. I would see this as a research-initiated or maybe\nresearch-supported reform, a reform supported by research. (Administrative Leader 1)\nThe narrative shift of the first period combines two different motives behind comprehensive\nschooling. First, a strong emphasis was placed on Bildung and enlightenment, which in the inter-\nviews were most strongly attached to and manifested in the construction of the elementary school\n101/1921). Second, emphasis was given to education as a national and even nationalist project,\nwhich was also personified by a few central actors in the history of comprehensive education.\nFrom steady development to the first crisis of the comprehensive school\nThe first ten years (1974-1984) of the second period were described as a time of a relatively egali-\ntarian and uniform comprehensive schooling. Bona fide practice and political consensus were men-\ntioned in the interviews, because the new comprehensive school was being developed and financed\nin good spirit:\nThere was a lot of experimental research, and the development of comprehensive school was supported by\nthat work. It was very visible until the [19]90s. And it was very strong in the [19]80s, and the outcome of\nthe reform, putting two school types together, was successful because we had such strong experimental\nactions and a constant increase in the level of teacher education. ... and also, taking an international\nglance, because we started a very strong in-service training for [school] staff. And in that respect, Finland\nis very different from other Nordic countries. (Administrative Leader 1)\nFrom this period on, international references, especially to other Nordic countries, became stronger\nin the narrative. The view on Finnish educational politics and policies as a part of a larger interna-\ntional frame and deriving international influence, primarily Nordic, was more apparent in the ver-\nbal presentations. Comprehensive education was discussed in an international, comparative\ncontext.\nThe Nordic co-operation has been important and valuable to Finland, and Finland has been this nice and\nobedient and profited a lot from that experience from other countries. Sweden has, of course, been kind of\na big brother and slightly arrogant and thought of Finland as being slightly strange, as we invested so much\n[in education], but then [came] the first PISA round, then a lot of this perception. ... And Finland has had\nvery close relations to Denmark and Norway as well.... There was a lot of co-operation before, as the\nadministration and professors spoke good Swedish. All administrators spoke good Swedish, which was a\nrequired skill, and these meetings were very regular. Nowadays they have faded into fairly formal ones.\n(Administrative Leader 1)\nThe slow slide towards economic depression started in Finland in the 1990s. Major cuts in public\nspending were introduced, which affected the funding of comprehensive schools to a significant\nextent. The biggest themes and events that arose in the discussion were the decentralization\nreforms, new laws introducing public school markets along with other neoliberal features, and cut-\nting funds from teachers' in-service training. However, in looking back, this period seemed to\nredefine the original meaning of educational equality from a geographical angle: socio-economic\ndifferences were targeted in the reforms, but the economic depression, the (then) current political\nsituation and decentralization policies as parts of that changed the situation of educational equality\nThe economic depression in its way boxed the system on its ears, and as simultaneously there was this big\npolitical change when after this whole period we got a general director on the National Board of Education\nfrom the Coalition Party [right-wing].... and simultaneously the Minister of Education [came] from the\nCoalition Party as well, a very strong de-regulation and modification of the comprehensive school started\n.... The spirit in which the [19]90s were drawn \u00ad it was unique and in its way weeded out the comprehensive\nschool. ... [One administrative leader] had the strong intention to erase these norms from comprehensive\nschool, and simultaneously the association of Finnish local and regional authorities got some staff, who\nvery much wanted to foster the idea that `the municipality and local level know'. And then there was [a\npowerful Social Democrat] who had the same point of view, thus creating a whole new consensus between\nthe Social Democrats and the Coalition Party.... [This] led to regional equality becoming a swear word.\n(Administrative Leader 1)\nThe situation [of regional inequality] has somehow gotten out of hand, and of course, if the starting point\nis the child's or pupil's right, then of course they should have similar possibilities, but it is then completely\ndifferent, if you get 20 hours more than someone else every year in some subject, or you have better\nopportunities for choosing foreign languages that will enhance your career and advance your path of study.\n(Administrative Leader 2)\nFollowing the major political turn in the politics of comprehensive education at this point in the\nstory in the 1990s, there seems to have been a discursive change. New legislation was introduced,\nincluding reforms in decentralization, more options and competition in the form of emerging pub-\nlic education markets, which included, for example, the introduction to the Finnish comprehensive\nschool system of parental school choice and pupil selection conducted by the schools. The prem-\nises regarding their origin, and especially the consequences of these reforms, as past and future\npoints of reference, were described in vivid terms, because they were perceived as promoting a\nnew kind of basis to comprehensive education politics:\nNeither these politicians nor civil servants were aware that there was this neoliberal framework around\nthese decisions which they were preparing and presenting.... I remember, I was part of a [committee] in\n[early 1990s], and that was an authoritative group... and I used the floor and applied the term neoliberalism\n... and [they] asked, what is neoliberalism? In the US it had been a general term already in the [beginning\nof the 1980s]. Here we were still in such a state of innocence that we thought we were just making nice\nliberties and a nice little competition, of course. (Researcher 1)\nThe political turn of the 1990s can also be approached through the shifting relations of the Finnish\npolitical parties. According to the interviewees, the centre\u00adleft coalition had an important role not\nonly in establishing comprehensive schools in the late 1960s, but also in protecting the `one school\nfor all' idea against marketization and privatization.\nDuring these years and decades, I have hosted many kinds of guests, and ... they always wondered how\nwe managed to maintain the comprehensive school as a beautiful flower of national education politics. I\nhave always emphasized that ... either the Finnish Social Democratic Party or the Centre Party \u00ad or in the\nbest case both \u00ad have been sitting in the cabinet. So, there has always been one or the other tackling these\nright-wing attempts to privatize education. (Politician 2)\nAs part of the wider societal change, the centre\u00adleft coalition in Finland began to lose its status quo\nin the 1980s. Shifting political coalitions also changed the politics of comprehensive education.\nAccording to the interviews, the 1990s appear to be a competitive tug-of-war, when ministers of\neducation chose sides based not entirely on their political party or existing coalitions but, rather, on\nthe basis of their own vision of a single educational issue. In tight situations, individual actors\ncould play a significant role for policy-shaping and decision-making in different committees.\nIn the mid-[19]90s the National Coalition Party tried to re-introduce the entrance examinations into\ncomprehensive school. On the school law committee were politicians from all different parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Centre Party were divided. One hooked up with the left and the Green Party, who\nwere not eager to change history ... while the other person from the centre decided to jump on the right-\nwing bandwagon. (Politician 2)\nShifts in political coalitions also had an impact on teacher education. Teachers' in-service training\nhad been considered an important factor in the high quality of Finland's comprehensive schooling;\nit was only a decade later that it was so described in PISAsuccess stories. Nevertheless, the changes\nin the 1990s were considered harsh in this respect:\nAnd I dare say that today ... [making in-service training for teachers tuition-based and eliminating the\nin-service centre in the small municipality of Heinola] was completely conscious and intentional, so that\nlet's stop this centralized state-governed education and let's levy a charge for it and make the municipalities\npay.... And then these poor municipalities have absolutely no chance, because they have to pay a daily\nallowance, and the municipalities have a very little of these allowances. And that's how [this] foundation\n[Abroad] in-service training is collaborative learning. What do we do? The same thing we have been doing\nfor decades, with a few good exceptions. Previously, we went to Heinola for a course. ... But everything\ncomes down to money.... and I'm not blaming our Ministry of Education or even the ministers of education,\nas these things come from above. It comes from... the Ministry of Finance, the big boys of the government\ndecide. And I can say this even with the recorder on here. (Stakeholder 1)\nThus far, the audience for the comprehensive school (the performing game) had mainly been an\ninternal one \u00ad a national audience \u00ad with, according to the storylines, some influences imported\nfrom the outside, including strong co-operation especially among the Nordic countries through vari-\nous Nordic and international organizations. Developing the school according to international trends\nin education was the next, overlapping stage in the multiple reforms in the 1990s, and there we can\nsee a change in the audience for Finnish comprehensive education (a change in the performing\ngame). The narrative now reflected political pressure from the Confederation of Finnish Industries\nto reform the comprehensive school system from several directions. Special attention was given to\ndiscussing the quality of the comprehensive school and the need for a market-based structure of the\nsystem, as had been done earlier in Sweden, from where previous influences were derived.\nI remember ... the battle that even if we wandered from this world [of uniform schooling] towards a world\nwith more leeway, we didn't go very far. And I believe an essential thing is, I think, the choice we made in\n[19]94-95 or so. It is a fact that in the background there was this free school ideology from Sweden. And\nwe did something else.... They decided to bring in private schools along with public comprehensive\nschools. They intentionally started creating this free school concept.... We in Finland then ... decided not\nto go in that direction, but rather to increase freedom within the public system. So that the emerging\npressure could be unloaded there. (Politician 1)\n... also there you see the battlefronts on a political scale that the right-wing bourgeois parties strongly\nsupport private schools. And then the rest of the field [gives more support] for this school for everyone,\nmeaning a general municipal school, but there you see the development inside that that we have this\ndevelopment of so-called teaching with an emphasis [on streaming]. Quite a lot swam in, so a kind of\nhidden, or is it even that hidden? Grouping is the term used, where better and worse performing pupils are\nput in different groups. (Administrative Leader 2)\nThis point (Politician 1) was one of the first references to Sweden, albeit not intended as a sugges-\ntion to follow the Swedish model. Here, too, double temporality needs to be acknowledged: criti-\ncism of free schools in Sweden is currently harsh. Thus, rationalizing this as an intentional act\n(which it was, according to the story of many interviewees) rather than being an unintended hap-\npening would seem to be a wise move for internal and external audiences. In addition, it was pos-\nsible here to discover friction in the storyline between the interviewees: some of them claimed that\nthere was consensus behind not introducing a fully privatized school market; some of them\ndescribed an internal conflict between the political right and the left. Some interviewees went into\ndetail about how these changes were initiated:\nWell, I would say that there you find links to economic life. Business would be rather on the side [of free\nschool ideology], and then I would say that the field of political parties was unanimous on the decision that\nwas made.... and the laws were accepted by a solid majority in the parliament. (Politician 1)\nFor example, in the [19]90s the comprehensive school was heavily criticized by the Confederation of\nFinnish Industries, and the whole system was set to be dismantled on a political basis. But the ideas of\ndismantling the system were knocked out when the first PISA results started appearing, and after that\nnobody has really questioned the idea of a comprehensive school. (Administrative Leader 3)\nThe second comprehensive school period was told in terms of a steady development towards a Law\nfor Comprehensive Education (A 718/1984). However, in the narrative the strengthened liberal\nright and the deteriorating coalition between the left and the centre from the late 1980s began to\nbreak down the social and regional equality as the ideological base of the comprehensive school.\nThe whole of the 1990s is described mainly as a decade of danger characterized by constantly\nchanging political coalitions, economic depression and the rise of managerialism and new public\nmanagement. However, the first major crisis of comprehensive schooling was soon to be ended due\nto glorious (i.e. outstandingly good) PISA results at the beginning of the new millennium.\nPISA as an international performance game\nThe narrative about the political discussions of the 1990s seemed to drive the comprehensive\nschool nationally into a discursive situation in which reform was soon to be carried out. However,\nthe PISA results which, based on the interviews, we consider analytically as an unintentional hap-\npening in this regard, changed the direction of events, because it changed the audience and the\nmeasurements of the perceived quality of Finnish comprehensive education.\nThe comprehensive school got quite a ride then in the [19]90s; even [acknowledged professors] ... gave\nstatements...they questioned the product so to speak, that the comprehensive school is, though not in quite\nthese words, expensive and inefficient and that kind of rhetoric, which was also insisted on by the\nConfederation of Finnish Industries in their pamphlets back then. It started to spring from all directions.\nAnd I don't know, this is kind of ... but was it eventually so that PISA in fact might have saved the Finnish\ncomprehensive school, I can't answer this, but one might play with that question. (Researcher 2)\nEven while there seemed to be a discourse casting PISA in the role of revealing the good quali-\nties of Finnish schools, the discussion prior to the PISA results, accompanied by the deregula-\ntions and educational reforms, left a permanent mark on the Finnish comprehensive school. The\nPISA report seemed to `turn the boat' and change the discourse, and in particular the audience.\nAnalytically, this seemed to be more of a happening than an intentional act, but the impact of\nPISA was considered enormous. PISA was described as culminating much of the development\nof schools and opening new discussions about the international marketization of education.\nI think that the PISA results were kind of like . . . not like a happy accident, but more like an accident in\nhappiness...It sort of like jammed up things...When you get feedback that you are doing damn well, then\nof course you try to retain all that is good... Sometimes a positive thing that is happening to someone is\nnot positive for the person's future. (Politician 1)\nI remember that in parliament, one politician stood up and said, `Hey boys, now we can invest in something\nother than comprehensive schooling'... So now that we are so good at this, we can start saving.\n(Administrative Leader 1)\nClearly, the surprise PISA results had a two-fold influence on educational politics, according to the\nnarrative: first, it was followed by internal preservation and protection of the comprehensive school\n(and halted all intended changes, according to the interviewees, because Finland scored at the top);\nand, second, by international fame and marketing efforts, such that up to the present time more and\nmore actors attempted to profit personally from the favourable outcome (which was confirmed in the\ninterviews). Bad news internally about the school was hardly heard, or even publically discussed:\nThere were an awful lot of politicians at an event [about] the PISA results, and there was this huge Eureka\nmoment \u00ad that the comprehensive school is so good, that we have been worried about it for no reason. That\nwe don't have to be this good, as we were first in everything. That was politics, and there the PISA success\nended up being negative.... [Other reports] were done much more carefully concerning the differences\nbetween schools and classes, and the ministry was often informed about it: `Now were going down.' ...\nand this caused a counter-reaction from the civil servants, who said yes, but in PISA we're doing fine. And\nthat's important, because the politicians are not interested in anything else. (Administrative Leader 1)\nAt the same time, the interviewees described how Finland was borrowing policies from outside, fixing\nminor issues and trying to maintain the schools and the image as the `best system among OECD coun-\ntries' despite the later declining results. These were the main topics in the narrative with regard to\neducation politics and policies during this period. It was evident that there was a major shift in the\nperforming game: Finland became a reference society and played that role for those outside the coun-\ntry. Connections with both international and national audiences became more complex.\nIf you want to get across [to politicians] where the innovations come from, I think that, in a way, it's from\ntheir own political background organizations.... And that's probably how it has always been, so that some\nproper country gets benchmarked where they have a similar governmental coalition or people in power as\nthemselves.... But it's mainly European countries, or Canada or the States then, but it's pretty hard for them\nto say we should do this or that, as they have some pretty horrible [PISA] results. (Administrative Leader 2)\nInternational organizations [and] OECD parameters are read when they suit us. And now we get new PISA\nresults, and then we read them. I'm afraid ... of the political process in the future, as we already have\npeople who think less [in comprehensive school] would be enough; but what happens when the results\nsink? The guilty party has to be found. Finns always start looking for the guilty ones. They take their\nshotguns and go out to find the guilty. Where do they find them? (Stakeholder 1)\nAfter the thickening concerning the PISA reports, the external influences referred to were reduced\nto a number of references to either the OECD or the OECD-countries, where success in the OECD-\noriginated rankings created a new frame of international reference. On a national level, the narra-\ntive of the early 2000s and perspectives for the future included the notion of not having a clear\npolitical consensus on comprehensive education. This has probably been the case for decades\nwhere highly politicized topics are concerned, such as forms of equality, quality and, later on,\nbenchmarking.\nTable 1.

And\nthis discussion should be conducted in a parliamentary group and over governmental terms in order to find a\nconsensus, which we had then; well, it probably wasn't unanimous then when the comprehensive school was\nestablished, but it created a shared thought that this is a good thing. (Stakeholder 2)\nWhat is evident is that the internationalization of evaluation and cross-country rankings through\nbenchmarking seemed to change the audience for the comprehensive school through events taking\nplace in different fields (such as the economic depression) and forums (international comparisons\nand benchmarking): the shift in the performing game from a national audience to an international\naudience, especially in the role of the `best' model, thanks to OECD reporting, reflects some later\nnational-level intentional acts in comprehensive education politics.As a lasting and unexpected situ-\nation, the Finnish PISA success also changed the relations of political actors. In contrast to the\n1990s' critique, comprehensive schooling suddenly became a political conservation area for all the\nmajor stakeholders \u00ad rhetorically speaking, at least, at the time the story was told. Despite this\n`freeze-frame' situation, there seemed to be no shared vision about the future direction for the com-\nprehensive school. However, by the end of the first decade of the new millennium, new criticisms\nrelated to the content of learning and digitalization began to be directed at comprehensive schools.\nTable 1 present the results showing the thickenings discovered in the narrative on the entire\ntimeline of comprehensive education politics, the central events and influential actors and the form\nof management game during each period.\nConcluding discussion\nAs we have noted above, the narrative of the Finnish comprehensive school, and the politics sur-\nrounding it, seem to consist of three major periods: the emergence of the comprehensive school\n(the 1970s); major reforms during the 1990s; and the period after the first PISA results in the early\n2000s. What distinguished these three periods of comprehensive education politics from each other\nwere the thickenings in the storyline with a strong described connection to the overall political situ-\nations, both nationally and internationally, and external occurrences outside the scope of education\npolitics. The two first periods were discursively described in the interviews as times of intentional\npolitics and policy-making with regard to comprehensive education, when the audience for the\nstory was national and the discussion involved only borrowing ideas from abroad. The first period\nreflects the birth of national solidarity, which later took the form of a left\u00adcentre coalition with\ngoals of social and regional equality in basic education. JV Snellman was discussed as a central\nactor who played an important but controversial role in the construction of common education,\nbecause he promoted Bildung and education, but not necessarily a uniform comprehensive educa-\ntion system: he preferred a dual model. Mikael Soininen, as an individual actor, was mentioned\noften in the interviews. Curiously, internal shifts in educational attitudes of the Agrarian Party dur-\ning the period (see Arola, 2003; Kivirauma and Jauhiainen, 1996) were not raised as a central part\nof the story, although such a discussion might have been expected based on the backgrounds of the\ninterviewees. Nor were the Evangelical Lutheran Church, and especially the clergyman Uno\nCygnaeus (often considered to be the father of Finnish public education), mentioned in the inter-\nviews as important actors as often as they are cited in the research literature.\nThe comprehensive school reform implemented in the 1970s was described as being strongly\nsupported by academia, which then in the last period, thirty years later in the narrative, was used as\none of the explanatory factors behind the success of Finland's students in the PISA tests. During\nthe second period, in the 1990s, the processes implementing neoliberal policies to different extents\nbrought new tones to the discussion of borrowing and lending educational policies. In the narra-\ntive, the political right wing was blaming the comprehensive school for `equalizing' students too\nmuch and not serving the needs of a changing business world and neoliberal market principles,\nsuch as individual choice. Organizations such as the Confederation of Finnish Industries ended up\nIn addition, some researchers were accusing the comprehensive school of reproducing the social\norder and failing to advance the goals of social change and equality (Ahonen, 2003). However,\nheavy criticism of the Finnish comprehensive school was dampened after the good results shown\nby Finnish students in the PISA 2000 report (Rinne and J\u00e4rvinen, 2011); later explanations in the\nliterature for the reasons behind this success and its consequences have been ambiguous (see, e.g.,\nSahlberg, 2011; Sepp\u00e4nen et al., in press).\nThe 1990s were described as a period of shifts in the political atmosphere, which then encoun-\ntered an unexpected turn when the PISA results appeared. This was analysed as a happening, one\nthat also changed the performing game \u00ad the emergence of an international audience (Rhodes,\n2011) \u00ad of policy-making and caused new forms of management games, and acts. These may be\ninterpreted as the pillars for the discussion about Finland as a reference society (Steiner-Khamsi,\nthere was a major change in the audience. According to the narrative, PISA brought the discussion\nof Finnish comprehensive education into an international framework overnight. In the current\ndescription of this period, a new national management game (see Rhodes, 2011) could be observed,\nbecause this part of the story was emphasized in particular in the quotidian storytelling of the\nFinnish success of education.\nThe aim of finding causality between education politics and policies (reforms) and success\nin learning outcome rankings has been of interest for external audiences as well as for educa-\ntional export in the later 2010s. It seemed that certain unintentional happenings were explained\nfurther as intentional acts, because these explanations would fit better the purposes of the fol-\nlowing period and change the management game: the role of changing the setting and thus the\ninfluence of the double temporality is evident. One could also argue that the recursive nature of\nthe stories makes it possible both to reinforce or challenge current discourses in the political\ndebate by referring to the perceived past. As well as these `lessons to be learned from the past',\nstorytelling also provides for addressing different audiences by connecting the story of the\ncomprehensive school to national politics in other fields, such as the welfare state and social\nissues; the narrative of teacher education; the narrative of educational research in different\nuniversities and their links to developing comprehensive schooling (especially in the 1970s in\ndiscussions of the cultural turn); the narrative of the curriculum (which is probably the most\ninterconnected); and the narrative of international trends in education (such as the role of OECD\nreporting) and political changes in the surrounding world (such as the collapse of the Soviet\nUnion during this time frame). Each of these themes could be the subject of an article of its\nown: they deserve to be mentioned.\nConcerning internal and external influences, the latter part of the decade commencing in 2010\nseems to constitute a new period in the narrative of Finnish comprehensive education politics, in\nwhich the influence of international organizations like the OECD, the economic depression and\n`managerialization' of public administration changed the internal power relations and forms of\nsteering the comprehensive education politics. As key findings in the analysis, two factors should\nbe emphasized: first, the role of the PISA reports as a turning point in comprehensive education\npolitics; and, second, how this then led to the discussion of the comprehensive school as a success\nstory of a kind, especially under the term `social innovation'. The use of the word `innovation' is\nmost likely time-bound and requires a sense of double temporality (Farred, 2004) of events: in the\nnarrative, several happenings were rationalized as acts in the storyline, even if the people involved\nin those events recall a great deal of contingency along the way. This notion links the findings of\nthis study to the earlier literature on Finland as a reference society of a kind (see Takayama et al.,\n2013; Waldow et al., 2014). That position, it seems, is something that has been internally negoti-\nated on the national level, and the aims of also capitalizing on it economically have been pursued\nsomewhat late, albeit currently strongly in the form of educational export. However, the lack of\ncapacity of telling an appealing story about the success, constructing a consistent and rational nar-\nrative, has been one of the pitfalls on the way of profiting fully from it for educational exporters.\nWhat becomes clear is that the narrative approach has provided a methodological tool with\nwhich to observe the interaction of acts and happenings and their external influences as a series of\nevents. The combined storylines constructing the narrative in the given socio-historical context\nactually reveal the contingency of the events. The relations of actions and consequences recon-\nstructed in narratives are not at all as rational, which we explain as being due to double temporality.\nExplanations of events change over time; but certainly some of those described as acts in the sto-\nryline of the Finnish comprehensive school were indicated as being a contingent series of happen-\nings. Sometimes they were described as being based on acts which led to new acts, and sometimes,\nlike the PISA results, they were just perceived as surprises which eventually shaped the system's\nentire performing game.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publi-\ncation of this article..\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publica-\ntion of this article: This article is part of the research project Dynamics in Basic Education Politics in Nordic\nCountries (DYNO), funded by Academy of Finland (decision number 276221).\nNotes\n1.
