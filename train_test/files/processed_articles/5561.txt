In its ever-increasing\nscales of production across wide geographic zones\nand temporal scopes, the social media image--pro-\nduced, manipulated, shared, and organized via social\nmedia streams--manifests distinct modes of socio-cul-\ntural expression.1 Are these images different in kind\nfrom earlier images? What are the ways in which they\noffer to shape our experience of ourselves and of the\nworld today? How do these images allow us to know\nthe world differently, and how is this knowing different\nin kind from earlier kinds of understanding?\nThis article discusses the ways in which\ncontemporary large-scale visual materials created\nwithin social media platforms suggest changing prac-\ntices of knowledge production and acquisition.\nAnalyzing core elements in the changing syntax of\nexisting visual software ontology--the ways current\nsocial media platforms and aggregators organize and\ncategorize social media visual materials--I trace the\nlevels in which the social media image offers new experi-\nences, conceptions, and interactions in regard to con-\ntemporary cultural productions.2 Doing so requires us\nto redefine the dynamic processes by which visual\nknowledge, value, and meaning are made in contem-\nporary conditions.\nI start by analyzing the organization of visual mater-\nials within the social media data stream--a continuous\npresentation of multiple information units from many\nHistory of Art and Architecture Department, University of Pittsburgh,\nUSA\nCorresponding author:\nNadav Hochman.\nEmail: h.nadav@gmail.com; Website: nadavhochman.net\nBig Data & Society\nbds.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License (http://\nwww.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (http://www.uk.sagepub.com/aboutus/\nopenaccess.htm).\nusers, places, and times. Contrary to a database struc-\nture that has no predefined notions of time, and conse-\nquently does not favor the temporal and linear\norganization of data objects, the data stream presents\nthe temporal element as its core organizational and\ncommunicational factor. Using examples from existing\nsocial media platforms and aggregators, I show how the\ndata stream re-conceptualizes a new understanding of\ntime and thus suggests a new experiential mode of con-\ntemporary history.\nFinally, I analyze how these new temporal arrange-\nments are manifested and discussed in three artworks:\n``Untitled'' (Perfect Lovers) by Felix Gonzalez-Torres\nLast Clock by Jussi A\n\u00a8 ngesleva\n\u00a8 and Ross Cooper\n(2002). As I argue, the works situate the contemporary\nimage within a new ``order of stream time'' and poet-\nically reflect on the experience and symbolic signifi-\ncances of this particular time.\nFrom database to data stream\nWhat are the material conditions (i.e. structure, imple-\nmentation, organization) by which the social media\nimage emerges or can be defined today? What are the\nrepresentational implications of these material condi-\ntions? These questions draw upon a long research trad-\nition devoted to trace the ways in which knowledge and\nmeaning productions are structured by representational\nforms--ranging from the study of esthetic properties as\nsymbolic forms (Panofsky, 1991), to the analysis of his-\nrecent efforts by software and algorithmic studies\nferent forms of materiality have been considered from\nthis perspective, they all explore the particular shapes of\ninformation; how these forms influence our experience\nof it; the types of analyses and interpretations it sup-\nports; and how it reflects particular values and hierar-\nchies of particular times and places (Dourish and\nThe materiality of information that concerns me\nhere are the ways in which visual information within\nsocial media platforms is structured, processed, and\npresented, and the consequences of these forms for\nthe ways we understand and experience these images.\nSpecifically, I situate the social media image within a\nnew order of time and elaborate on the experience,\nmeaning, and analyses of this particular time.\nTo illustrate this point, I focus on the organization\nand presentation of visual materials within the social\nmedia data stream, contrary to information arrange-\nments in a structured database. While the database des-\nignates a rather stable organization of data objects,\nrecent online developments signal a paradigm shift\ntoward the transient data stream (Berry, 2011a,\nto the database, where updates and queries are made\ninfrequently (and thus used to define the static ``desti-\ndynamic, continuous flow of items that keeps updating\naccording to new data that arrives from multiple, time-\nvarying sources.\nThe data stream has been in use since the beginning\nof the 2000s in an increasing number of applications\nthat require real-time processing of continuous data\nflows from geographically distributed sources\nples of such applications come from diverse\nfields--financial applications, network monitoring,\nsecurity, sensor networks, and others--it is the incorp-\noration of the stream as the core mechanism in social\nmedia platforms that has transformed former everyday\ncommunication patterns and structured new social\nexperiences. Examples such as Twitter, Facebook,\nInstagram, or Newsfeed represent a new class of com-\nmunication technologies, all structured as streams of\ninformation (status messages, images, videos, and\nlinks) contributed by many users from many places\nAs apposed to previous mechanisms that work on\nopening and closing server connections, and pulling in\ninformation on request, this new type of data process-\ning performs a continuous query for new data units\nthat arrive in the database and pushes the result into\nthe stream according to the filter being used. The result\nis thus a persistent, real-time connection between a\nserver and a user (Marz, 2011). These data units\nappear to us from the current time backward and are\nrestricted to the recent now, as older objects quickly\ndisappear from the stream and are available only by\nsearching the application database. What we have\nhere is a continuous, rapid presentation of multiple\ndata units from many users, places, and times--all\nappear to us almost at the same, synchronous, time.\nWhat is most important to understand is that while\nthe database stores sets of relatively static recodes with\nno pre-defined notions of time (objects or data values\nare not necessarily organized by the time of creation or\nuploaded to the database unless time indications are\nexplicitly added), the data stream is a continuous\nsequence of items that are organized by their arrival\ntime or by a time stamp that is associated with an\nobject (Golab and Ozsu, 2003). In this way, if the data-\nbase suppressed traditional linear forms (as it has no\npre-defined notions of time), and marked an informa-\ntional ontology that formed a new way to structure our\ncontemporary experience in and of the world\n2 Big Data & Society\nemphasize once again the linearity of a particular data\nsequence, and thus re-conceptualize new types of con-\ntemporary knowledge formations and acquisitions.\nWhat type of linearity is it, and how does it manifest\nitself in regard to visual materials in the social media\ndata stream? How does the organization of images in\nthe stream structure our understanding of social visual\ndata today? Put differently, if the stream brings back\nthe temporal element as its core organizational and\ncommunicational factor, what type of collective rela-\ntionship with time does it suggest? How does the\npresentation of the stream construct our understanding\nof this collective time, and how does this time differ\nfrom earlier times encapsulated in former data\npresentations?\nIt might be useful to think about the near-simulta-\nneous real-time structure of the data flow within the\nstream in terms of what historian Franc\n\u00b8 ois Hartog\nhas called ``presentism'': a ``regime of historicity'' (or\na temporal order) in which the present has become the\nmost crucial ordering mechanism of contemporary\nsociety (Hartog, 2003). In this new temporal\nregime--formulated by others as timeless (Castells,\nence'' of the present is one of enervating depthlessness\nthat traps us in an omnipresent present, a withdrawal\ninto the present as an absolute value that absorbs the\npast and the future and eliminates them. Such a regime\nsignals a disconnection from past historical concep-\ntions--such as the modern order of time, which was\nmarked by the idea of progress and a continuous orien-\ntation toward the future--and undermines the mere\nHow might this work if applied to the structural\nlogic and presentation of the stream? While the\nstream seems to take part in Hartog's ``presentism,''\nas it is in real-time and continuous updates of recent\n``presents'' appear to us almost at the same time, it also\ndiverges from it by offering a particular form of pres-\nentism. As the data stream is a multiplicity of coexisting\ntemporalities or ``worldviews'' from many people and\nplaces, the experience of viewing the stream is a con-\ntinuous comparison of temporal representations: a com-\nparison of the present time experienced by an individual\nlaunching the application to all other presences\nexpressed by other individuals in the same feed, all\nposting images in temporal proximity to each other.\nThe effect of this comparison is the resynchroniza-\ntion of our own living bodies' temporality with the\ntemporalities of others, fusing all together in order to\nmake them ``one.'' This does not mean, however, a lack\nof time, or an ``atemporal'' or ``timeless'' state in which\nwe are all at the same time together. Rather, it is a\ncondition in which time becomes times, a performance\nof the contemporary flow of synched and meshed times\nand the relations between them. In this condition of\ntime, the past, present, and future are constructed in\na relationship that is not about the passage of time (as\nin former modern organizational forms such as the\nfilm), but about being at the same time with other\nusers (viewing the stream as it updates), being after\nusers' time (browsing past events), or being before\nusers' time (experiencing an event before it is uploaded\nto the stream by other people).\nIn other words, contrary to Hartog's view of pre-\nsentism as disconnected from the past and the future\nthe stream actually facilitates their conditions of possi-\nbility. The stream enables the present of the viewer/user\nto break down into the past and the future times of\nother users. It creates a montage of ``temporal dialect-\nical images'' that coincide with one another (``close''\ntimes), or completely incommensurable times (``differ-\nent'' times). By so doing, the stream activates a set of\nco-occurring temporal relations (before/after/at the\nsame time) and thus brings the past, present, and\nfuture of many users closer together as a simultaneous\nduration of multiple temporalities.\nThese new temporal relations are best understood in\ntheir historical context. As famously discussed by\nWalter Benjamin, the modern experience of temporality\nis one of a ``homogenous empty time,'' in which time is\nconceived as the uniform, ``empty'' units represented by\nthis idea was later developed by Benedict Anderson,\nthis understanding of time encompassed a new experi-\nence of simultaneity, in which unrelated people can feel\nthemselves unified and together by occupying the same\nhomogeneous temporal moment (according to\nAnderson, this understanding of time was mostly\nderived from the 19th century mass circulation of\ndaily newspapers, through which thousands of people\nshared the same experiences by reading the daily news).\nIn other words, this new sense of simultaneity enabled\nus to imagine ourselves as members of the same socio-\nlogical reality, in which all co-occur at the same, homo-\nBenjamin borrowed the idea of homogeneous empty\ntime from Henri Bergson, who argued that while tem-\nporality actually consists of heterogeneous moments of\nduration that permeate one another, our mental appar-\natus reconfigures time as homogeneous by laying it out\nthis way, as explained by Mitchell (2000), modernity\ncan be characterized as a ``form of temporality'' with\na homogeneous spatial expression, in which we are all\nthe same empty, imagined, time-space. The result of\nthis simultaneity was what made it possible to construct\nthe idea of historical time: history is the story of a civ-\nilization, culture, or people whose distinct and detached\nlives are reimagined and reassembled into one unit in\norder to create a sense of progress from one simultan-\nWhen this becomes clear, it is easier to understand\nhow the data stream activates a new contemporary\nform of temporality. If the modern conception of\ntime, epitomized by printing technologies, was an\nexperience of homogeneous empty times that rests on\ngiving temporality a unified spatial expression (the spa-\ntialization of time), and the postmodern, emblemed by\nthe structure of the database, undermined and rejected\nthis time (the annihilation, distraction, and death of\ntime), the stream mechanism can be thought of as the\ntemporalization of space, giving spatiality a fragmented\ntemporal expression (the expansion of time).\nAs time is viewed from many places, and space is\nviewed from many different yet close times, the\nstream thickens contemporary views of time and\nspace into a parallel display of multiple temporalities\nfrom various spatialities. These extensions of time and\nplace, however, do not unfold as expanded presents in\nwhich the visual flow constitutes a continuous or dis-\ncontinuous chronology. Rather, the informational\nmechanism of the stream turns temporal synchroniza-\ntion into a new experiential mode of contemporary his-\ntory, in which the past, present, and future of images\nfrom many locations and users temporally coexist with-\nout the need to manifest a sense of modern linearity or\na historical progression between them.\nImagined data communities\nWhile the resynchronization of times enabled by the\nstream velocity, frequency, and immediacy offers a\nnew subjective experiential mode of contemporary tem-\nporalities, its expansion into a new condition of con-\ntemporary history is facilitated by the projection of this\nidiosyncratic experience into larger sets of collective\ndata productions and presentations. Each action\ntaken within the stream is fed into a structured data-\nbase that complies with an archival impulse to fulfill the\npotential of real-time stream drives (Gehl, 2011: 6). In\nthis reciprocal mechanism, the stream recedes back into\na retrievable, structured database that is then (or most\noften) used to restructure distinct individual streams for\nspecific users according to their historic actions/data\n(Weltevrede et al., 2014: 6) and aggregate temporal\nmultiplicities from many people, places, and times.\nThis new condition is enabled by an infrastructural\nstability of information atomization, fragmentation,\nand presentation within uniformed real-time streams.\nThe organization of streams as nodes of ``international\nstyles'' (visual, textual, etc.) forces each individual\ninformation unit to look, act, and speak the same\nway and supports a relationality that enables the con-\njoining of different indexical datasets that are diverse in\nvariety, exhaustive in scope, and fine-grained in reso-\nlution (Kitchin, 2014). This process permeates the\nglobal and the local, the technical and the social,3 and\nenables us to move from individual knowledge units to\ntheir juxtaposition with countless other near-simulta-\nneous data units, and then move back to graspable\nforms of knowledge by locating connections and rela-\ntions, only now on a larger scale and sense.\nHow does this work in relation to social media\nimages? The transformation of images within the\nstream into a retrievable structure is enabled by\nmanual and automatic procedures that ``fragment'' or\n``atomize'' individual images into small informational\nunits and present them in collections with all other\nimages that share informational proximity in a data-\nbase. The first most common manual visual classifying\nsystems are based on information annotation with key-\nwords. This type of manual indexing has been known as\ntagging, and the index terms or keywords are referred\nto as tags (Avery, 2010). The basic principle is that\nusers of social media services do ``subject indexing,''\nand the assigned tags are shown immediately on the\nWeb along with the posted image (Vob, 2007). In\nsome cases, content annotation is performed by out-\nsourced labor using services such as Mechanical Turk\nsocial media platforms outsource micro tasks such as\ntagging photos, filtering abusive content, or judging the\nnews relevance of content items (Twitter engineering\nThe second automatic organization of visual mater-\nials in social media platforms is based on ``external''\nannotation of images with metadata (such as location\ncoordinates, a time stamp, a user name, etc.) and\n``internal'' analysis of visual content. While the\nformer dominates current social media data organiza-\ntion, recent developments in artificial intelligence and\ncomputer vision analysis signal potential classification\nsystems based on visual content (Camfind, 2013;\nAiming to transform the way in which people search\nand browse theirs and others' photos, these systems\nautomatically analyze and recognize searchable visual\ncontent such as objects, text, or faces and automatically\nadd searchable tags to images and videos where those\nitems are ``seen'' by the software.4\nThese types of visual data management are becom-\ning ever-more synchronous with the act of picture\ntaking within and outside of the stream and operate\nboth on the level of the individual's image collection\nand over collective datasets from many people. They\noffer to group small and large sets of images based on\ninherent content attributes and then divide these visual\nsets according to various categories.\n4 Big Data & Society\nThe result of this twin data-control process (auto-\nmatic and manual tagging of image segments and\nother information) reconditions the terms under\nwhich text, images, and numbers come together and\nopens up new relations between them. In these new\nrelations, text, numbers, and images are synchronously\n``born'' and dissolved into one another without the pre-\ncedence of one over the other (i.e. text does not come\nafter the image as a means to explicate what is in the\nimage but rather it is an inherent part of it). This recent\ntransformation of visual, verbal, and numerical identi-\nties does not reduce an image into language or a\nnumber, but rather dissolves their historical borders\nas fixed boundaries in order to form new relations of\nthe visual to the outside world.\nLet us look at a particular example of this process.\nThe visual data stream consists of real-time docu-\nmented events that appear to us right now, but it also\nincludes photos that were taken hours, days, weeks,\nand sometimes years before they were uploaded to the\nstream. When uploaded to the stream, these old photo-\ngraphic events are assigned with the elements of a new\nevent and ascribed as a ``new'' here and now (as their\ntime indication of when it was uploaded to the stream\nindicates its recentness). But these past events are com-\nmonly assigned by users with textual tags that indicate\ntheir ``original'' time (such as the common tags ``tbt,''\nwhich stands for ``throw back Thursday,'' or\n``latergram''), and together with all other time\nindications within the stream (1 minute ago, 2 weeks\nago, etc.), they make the gap between the past and\nthe present obvious--and in this way, they ``thematize''\nthe flow of time within the stream.\nBut there is more to these changing relations\nbetween images and their surrounding texts and num-\nbers. Words and numbers are not meant to explicate an\nimage (as an indexical sign) but rather to group it with\nall other images that share data similarity. What this\natomization process facilitates is that images that once\npointed toward themselves (i.e. our interest was first\ndirected to what is going on inside the image and\nthen toward the outside world--what has been known\nas the symbolic aspect of images) now point directly\noutside, looking for connections, relations, and pat-\nterns with other items in a collection. Put differently,\nthe social media image directs our attention from the\ninside toward the outside: toward its potential position-\ning with all other images in the same ``social (media)\nspace and time''; toward its spatial boundaries (i.e.\nwhere similar images with the same tag were taken\naround the world; see, for example, Figure 1) and its\ntemporal boundaries (i.e. when these images are taken;\nWe can articulate these relations in another way. If\nearlier visual forms such as a work of art, a film, etc.\nhave been discussed and conceived as a representation\nof an ``imagined world,'' and what was going on inside\nthe image was interpreted as reflecting (or not) larger\nFigure 1. A visualization of 100,000 Instagram photos with the tag #selfie (yellow) and 100,000 photos with the tag #me (blue) taken\ncultural patterns, for the social media image, these rela-\ntions are turned once again on their head. The ``ima-\ngined'' aspects of an image are no longer inherent to the\nindividual pictorial surface and the construction of its\nvarious visual elements, but rather it is constructed\nfrom the relations of these elements with countless\nother similar pictorial elements in other social media\nimages. Everything that is outside of the image or\nactively ``dissected'' from the image (i.e. content units\nsuch as people, buildings, etc.) connects it to imagined\ndata communities that only potentially and relationally\nexist. In other words, while what is going on inside the\nimage shows us what the world is right now (derived\nfrom the immediate registration and the shared space of\neveryday life), everything that is going on outside that\nimage considers the what if or what might be, or how we\nmight think about what the world is through the lens of\naggregated, simultaneous representations of particular\ndata units. In short, the ``real'' is everything that is\ngoing on inside an image (images of particular subjects\nin the world), while the symbolic is everything that is\noutside of that image and connected to it via similar\nfragmented data units (Figure 2).\nIn this way, if the computer--or the ``meta-\nmedium'' (Kay and Goldberg, 1977)--facilitated the\nconditions for the rise of ``meta-media''--software\ntools that allow the user to manipulate and change\nthe original structure of a media object (Manovich,\n2005)--the rise of visual social media platforms facili-\ntated the conditions for the rise of what we can call the\n``meta-image'': a visual media interface that offers both\nthe original object (i.e. image, video) and software tools\nthat allow users to manipulate and change this object,\nadd descriptions, and also share, organize, and store\nthe image in distinct ways. In turn, each of these\nimage's textual and numerical descriptions (filters,\ntags, location) becomes the ``DNA'' of an image, or\nits unique ``signature,'' and is then used as metadata\nto group this image with countless other images that\nshare similar data units. As such, the social media\nimage is a meta-image because it is always an image\nabout and within larger groups of images, associated\nwith them by shared identical data units (such as loca-\ntion, time, filter, tags, content, etc.).\nDue to this process of continuous fragmenta-\ntion--derived from the need to ``control'' and order\nmassive amounts of visual materials--the social media\nimage is emerging as a significant cultural form not\nonly in terms of the structure of an individual image\nwithin a media interface but also in terms of its organ-\nization within complete image collections. It is this type\nof collective image organization that opens new creative\npossibilities to organize, present, and interface large\nvisual data within and outside of the stream, and it is\nthe ways in which these images are grouped, when, and\nwhy, that determine the significance of their organiza-\ntion and the meaning of each image in relation to all\nother images in that group.5\nHorizon of temporalities\nWithin the social media domain, recent ``collective''\norganizational forms of social media data act as aggre-\ngators that collect data streams from existing social\ninformation sources through API (application\nprogramming interface) calls and act as ``live stream\nreaders'' that pull together data from various social\nnetworks and are known as ``social network aggrega-\ntors'' (Wikipedia, 2014), or as ``analytics dashboards''\nthat provide synthesized and often algorithmically sum-\nmarized views of data streams to extract meaningful\ninsights known as ``social media control centers''\n(HootSuite, 2013). In regard to the visual stream, the\nformer currently includes applications that offer, for\nexample, to follow all social media data images that\nare produced in a confined area in real time (see, for\nApp, 2013), while the latter offers to automatically re-\ncreate live events and summarize insights about them\nby crawling the Web for relevant photos, videos, and\nfirst-person accounts (Seen, 2014) or detect live events\nin the city according to social media data (images and\ntexts) that are produced within it (CityBeat, 2014).\nWhat is unique about these visual aggregators is that\nthey replicate the individual experience of viewing a\nnear-simultaneous personalized visual stream consist-\ning of only people you follow, and turn it into a sum-\nmarized view of recent social media chronologies\nproduced by all other ``worldviews'' that are shared\nwithin the stream in confined areas, particular places,\nor specified events. In other words, if the individual\nstream is a ``curated'' presentation of only people we\nfollow and we choose to synchronize ourselves with, or\nof performances of time we want to compare ourselves\nwith, the aggregated stream acts in an opposite way: it\nallows us to bring all other people from a particular\nlocation into our own flow of time.\nThe CityBeat aggregation system is a particularly\ninteresting case in point (Figure 3). The system seg-\nments the city into a grid of small squares\nmedia production rates within each square (Xia et al.,\n2014). In this way, each square acquires a ``temporality\nrate'' according to the number of images and other\nsocial media data produced within it at different times\nof the day and over long durations in order to detect\nabnormalities in an area (the system measures higher or\nlower production rates compared with average rates at\ndifferent times of the day over time). The result is a\npresentation of simultaneous ``abnormal temporalities''\n6 Big Data & Society\nor ``events'' in the city that allows you to zoom in and\nexamine the particular social media manifestations that\nreport various visual and textual aspects of what is\ngoing on in this area in real time.\nBecause what we see are multiple representations of\ndata abnormalities in the city, the system activates the\npresent as an organizing principle of the past (every\nimage posted in an area is measured to all other past\nimages posted in this area), and this present is also a\nmeasuring tool that prefigures near-future images from\nthe same area. Put differently, and more in line with our\nformer discussion, the linear structure and presentation\nof the aggregated stream is unique because it systemat-\nically both synchronizes all present temporal passings\nin a confined place and also reactivates recent histori-\ncities in that place that are derived from the aggregation\nFigure 2. Moritz Stefaner (2014) shared tag space--a comparative visualization of keywords people use in five cities to describe\ntheir selfies. The visualization displays a network of tags, cities, and photos taken 4\u00ad12 December 2013. The photos are used as\nbridges between tags and cities. Bigger tags are used more often. The tags in the center constitute a shared vocabulary across the\ncities, while the ones on the outside are more specific to one (or sometimes two) cities. The visualization was created as part of the\nselfiecity project. Available at: http://selfiecity.net (accessed 10 July 2014).\nand synchronization of these temporalities over time. In\nother words, present simultaneous temporalities in a\nparticular location are compared with all other past\nsynchronous temporalities in this location and are\nalso compared with simultaneous temporalities in\nother locations in order to reveal historical relations\nbetween these temporalities.\nIn this way, these aggregators suggest an alternative\nregime of historicity that automatically generates simul-\ntaneous larger wholes while bringing the recent past into\nthe present to prefigure the near future. The stream is\nthus a new temporal condition that shifts away from\nmodern conceptualizations of time as a continuous uni-\nfied sequence toward a ``presentifying'' esthetics of mul-\ntiple temporalities and their relations in time and space.\nWhat these aggregators do is to bring together diverse\ntemporal segments of particular events or geographical\nareas into the recent present. They intensify the temporal\nexperience of the present and blow it up into multiple\nscales (specific events, places, or individuals, the entire\ncity, the country, or the earth), while segmenting it into\nwhat might be called a ``horizon'' of simultaneous tem-\nporalities.6 It turns the older spatial organization of the\nhorizon (think, for example, of an image where the sky\nmeets the earth and construct a straight horizontal line)\ninto a temporalized one, which is now constructed from\nus viewing the co-linearity of a synchronized time that\nhas now become times (Figure 4).\nThis is now\nThis description of some aspects of the conditions of\nvisual materials within the stream points toward the\nways in which the social media image might offer new\nexperiences, conceptions, and interactions in regard to\ncontemporary visual productions. As I have shown, the\nstructure of the social media image shapes the questions\nthat we can ask of it and determines how it can be used\nto understand and view the world.\nThese new worldviews--constructed from particular\nvisual arrangements and temporal principles--also have\nconsequences for particular kinds of creative and poetic\nrepresentational practices. In what follows, I discuss\nthree such examples. Each in its own distinct way, the\nworks ``Untitled'' (Perfect Lovers) by Felix Gonzalez-\nand Last Clock by Jussi A\n\u00a8 ngesleva\n\u00a8 and Ross Cooper\n(2002), poetically reflect on the experience and symbolic\nsignificances of our new ``order of stream time.'' By\ndoing so, the works illuminate some of the challenges,\nconditions, and tensions between ``former'' visual struc-\ntures and contemporary (emerging) ones and draw our\nattention to the material conditions of big visual data\ntoday and its emerging symbolic cultural significations.\nThe work ``Untitled'' (Perfect Lovers) by Felix\nGonzalez-Torres from 1991 consists of two identical\nclocks placed side by side and presents analogous\nFigure 3. A screenshot from CityBeat (2014), a real-time event-detection system utilizing multiple feeds of geo-tagged social media\ndata.\n8 Big Data & Society\ntimes (Figure 5). They are set to show exactly the same\ntime, yet due to batteries running down at different\nrates in each of the two clocks, they are slightly out\nof synch. It is a juxtaposition of two perfectly aligned\ntimes that gradually run down and advance at differing\nrates, a metaphorical unfulfilled desire of two nearly\nidentical and symmetrical beings to become one--and\nthus: ``Perfect Lovers.''\nThe work is also a poetic manifestation of particular\nprinciples of expression of contemporary temporalities.\nCoupled with the viewer's time, the experience of the\nwork is one of a continuous comparison of three differ-\nent times, a set of near-simultaneous temporal relations\nthat will never be unified (the time of the viewer's clock\nis always before/after/at the same time with the other\ntwo clocks). As I explained before, this is also the\nexperience of the stream, which offers the resynchroni-\nzation of temporalities that could never be completely\nsynched.\nHowever, the work tells us something more refined\nin relation to these new temporal conditions. The dif-\nferences between the two clocks are shrinking to their\nminimum, and their temporal gaps from one another\nremain roughly the same as they keep presenting similar\nor close times. This is an acute observation if applied to\nthe temporal mechanism of the stream. As real-time\ninformation units from many users, places, and times\nkeep flowing into the stream, past events quickly dis-\nappear in favor of new events, and thus the presenta-\ntion of information is always from the recent past,\npresent, or near future (i.e. 1 second ago, 10 minutes\nago, or 1 day ago, but usually not past that time span).\nHowever metaphorical ``Untitled'' (Perfect Lovers)\nmight be, its material structure forces the viewer to be\nwithin different times, and, most importantly, in close\ndistance from these unique times. By so doing, the\nwork pre-echoes a fundamental condition in the experi-\nence of our current ``stream time,'' underscoring its\nstructure as a continuous comparison of temporalities\nthat their distance from each other (and us) remains\nalways roughly equal and close. This temporal experi-\nence, as meticulously visualized by Gonzalez-Torres, is\nnot about the passage of time as a succession of events\nlaid out on a unified spatial sequence such as the timeline\n(a la Bergson), but one of being in relation to others who\nare always in a similar, short temporal distance from us.7\nWhile ``Untitled'' (Perfect Lovers) is an early meta-\nphorical articulation of core principles in the structure\nFigure 4.

Christian Marclay's The Clock is\na 24-hour video that assembles, samples, edits, and\nremixes together thousands of short film clips--all fea-\nture clocks, watches, or people announcing or referring\nto time. These short cinematic time indications are then\norganized chronologically to represent the progression\nof a full day and synchronized with the actual time of the\nviewer. The result is a 24-hour timepiece, which meticu-\nlously ticks the time (minutes and sometimes the sec-\nonds) of a full day, while confronting the viewer with\nshort historical cinematic moments that are synchro-\nnized and timed with the outside world (Figure 6).\nBy creating ``a sort of homemade Web engine'' (Smith,\n2011), a fabricated algorithmic aggregation system that\nseems to automatically search and cross-reference count-\nless cinematic materials that refer to time in one way or\nanother, Marclay poetically signifies the problem of scale\nitself: it is not only about how to deal with the exponential\ngrowth of data, but rather how to generate a significant\ncultural object (be it a work of art, a historical account,\ncultural theory, etc.) based on this data. In fact, in the case\nof The Clock, the problem is how to say something about\nthe changing nature of our current time, while the acute\nproblem is that you have countless, different, expressions\nof this time, or, more precisely, how do we encapsulate the\nmeaning of contemporary time on a planetary scale and in\na planetary sense?\nMarclay's solution here is to organize his large-scale\ndataset according to real-world time, to synchronize the\nscreen time (the time presented in each clip) with the real\ntime of the viewer. The result is a database of cinematic\nsegments that are decontextualized, devoid of meaning,\ncan be replaced by others, and are equal in their import-\nance, relevance, and contribution to the overall meaning\nof the collection. It is a continuous artificially constructed\nfragmented stream of time-stamped images (both with the\noriginal cinematic time and a real-world time indication),\na fictional hybrid of historical cinematic moments that\nappear to us as if they are accruing right now.\nWithin these new temporal conditions, the experience\nof the work is of a continuous tension between the linear\nand the cyclical: the cyclical, in the form of particular\ntime indications that repeat themselves potentially for-\never (the actual time of the viewer synchronized with\nscreen time), and the linear, in the form of constantly\ndisturbed autonomous film fragments (the construction\nof meaning by conventions of causality within the image\nor a sequence of images). In this way, the work overrides\nthe symbolic nature of the original film clip, its distance\nand distinction from the world, in favor of a more direct\nassociation with larger networks of meaning that\nhappen to us right now.\n\u00dfThe Felix Gonzalez-Torres Foundation.\nCourtesy of Andrea Rosen Gallery, New York.\n10 Big Data & Society\nWhat we get here is a mixture of old and new, a para-\ndoxical timeline of negated times that are, surprisingly,\ncompletely synchronized. This is not a traditional time-\nline, as its historical axes are not parallel but conjoined\nto each other. Each image is not organized and perceived\naccording to its original cinematic or creation time, but\nby multiple other real and potential times that operate\nwithin it. We can call it a relational timeline, a timeline\nthat is interested not in the organization of information\naccording to its substantial features (in terms of a fixed\ncontent, creation date, etc.) but rather in potential rela-\ntions, connections, and continuities among its countless\nfragments. Very much like social media stream time, the\nwork presents us with a timeline that forces you to be\nwithin time (the present time) but also inherently against\nit (as you are constantly occupied by the juxtaposition of\ndifferent times together).\nIn light of my earlier discussion of current visual\ninformational processes within the stream, it is useful\nto think about The Clock as an expression of the\ndesire for a film to become a contemporary image. It\narticulates a tension between a cinematic modern linear-\nity that is controlled by a singular worldview of a\nfilmmaker to the arbitrary organization of many world-\nviews by constantly changing equally important data\nattributes. By so doing, it juxtaposes and confronts\ntwo inherently different pictorial logics and draws our\nattention to the material configurations and cultural sig-\nnifications of contemporary visual stream productions.\nSimilar informational and representational processes\ntake place and are intensified in the work Last Clock by\nJussi A\n\u00a8 ngesleva\n\u00a8 and Ross Cooper (the work was first\nreleased as an interactive installation in 2002 and was\nlater adapted to mobile phones in 2011). While The\nClock still carries the identification of a singular mod-\nernist artwork that remains the same every time you\nwatch it, in Last Clock, the cinematic database is\nreplaced or eliminated with a continuous stream of\nimage slices that are captured live by a mobile phone\ncamera. Each of the clock's hands, as they rotate\naround, leaves a trace or a ``slice'' of what has been\ncaptured by the mobile camera phone. In this way,\nwhat seems at first a traditional analog clock with\nsecond, minute, and hour hands showing the current\ntime quickly transforms into a visual representation of\nthe temporal nature or ``rhythm'' of individuals in a\nFigure 6. Christian Marclay, The Clock, 2010. Single channel video, duration: 24 hours.\nPhoto: Ben Westoby.\nCourtesy White Cube.\nparticular space. In other words, the software of Last\nClock captures ``slices'' of reality through the mobile\nphone camera and stitches them together in such a\nway that every change in position, perspective, or envir-\nonment of the camera phone directs the shape of time\n(Figure 7).\nInstead of a fixed representational ``universal'' time\nthat is being determined a priori as in all other regular\nclocks, time here is ``personalized'' by capturing\nmomentary slices of space and positioning them on\nthe screen both in time and as time itself. The result is\na monitoring clock that detects the changing nature of a\nspace or movement in space and forces an individual to\nunderstand themselves as a point in that time and place.\nSimilarly to The Clock, the work connects a former\nrepresentational time to an individual time. The result\nis a representation of different scales of visual time\n(minutes, hours, or seconds) that moves from the uni-\nversal, global time to the local, idiosyncratic time, while\nnot reducing the latter in favor of the former.\nAs the hands of the clock rotate at different rates,\ndisplaying the last minute, hour, and 12 hours as its\nhistory, they continually overwrite the past with the\npresent. While this speaks to stream mechanisms dis-\ncussed before (such as the close distance between dif-\nferent temporalities that remains roughly equal and\nclose), Last Clock also elaborates on the question of\nthe representational pace of time. Even though the\nsame slice of the video feeds all three hands of the\nclock, the fact that the hands move at different rates\nmeans that each ring shows a different algorithmically\nconstructed representation of the same time.\nAs apposed to The Clock, where the viewer was con-\nfronted with the multiplicity of temporalities at the\nsame time, Last Clock manipulates and juxtaposes the\nsame singular temporality but places it within three dif-\nferent temporal rates. This points directly to the fabri-\ncation of stream time and its medium specificity. A\nstream is not only the flow and convergence of the\nmultiplicity of different, yet close, times, but it is also\nFigure 7. Jussi A\n\u00a8 ngesleva\n\u00a8 and Ross Cooper (2002) Last Clock.

I analyzed the structure\nof social media images within the stream, charted some\nof the current ways to organize and categorize these\nimages, and theorized the representational implications\nof these new structures for the ways in which we might\n``know'' and understand these images. Additionally, I\nshowed how these visual arrangements and temporal\nprinciples facilitated by the stream are poetically mani-\nfested and discussed in three artworks that position\ncontemporary time as their main subject of inquiry.\nBoth the visual stream and our discussed artworks\nsituate the contemporary (social media) image within a\nnew order of time and elaborate on the experience,\nmeaning, and analyses of this particular time. By\nemphasizing technical and poetic ways in which social\nmedia platforms and aggregators situate the present as a\n``thick'' historical unit that embodies multiple and syn-\nchronous temporalities, I tried to illuminate some of the\nconditions, challenges, and tensions between former\nvisual structures and current ones and unfold the cul-\ntural significations of contemporary big visual data.\nAs apposed to prevalent conceptions of contempor-\nary time as trapped within a paralyzing presentism of\nsimultaneous flows with no past or future (Castells,\nto recent attempts to undermine the study of this eter-\nnal ``plastic'' present (Uprichard, 2012)--this article\ninsists that this ``now'' is actually just one temporal\naspect of many, facilitated by the stream. As such, my\ngoal was to start pointing to the distinctive qualities in\nwhich the visual stream facilitates a complex multipli-\ncity of ways of being in real-time(s) today. In particu-\nlar, I tried to bring attention to the cruciality of what it\nis to be in stream time that promotes the awareness for\nthe ``presence'' of other kinds of times, including algo-\nrithmic times.\nThis is for me what is truly inscribed into recent\nnotions of ``velocity,'' and the main challenge for\nresearch interested in the experience of Big Data\nstreams presentism: recognizing, characterizing, and\nanalyzing the variety of presence(s) in each platform,\nfor different groups of users, and for different geogra-\nphies, and the ways in which these presence(s) are\nconstructed by larger (cultural, social, political, and\ntechnological) forces.\nIt is only in these circumstances--to bring us back to\nour original starting point of the image within a new\nregime of time--that we may say that image taking is\nshifting from being ``of the world'' and is becoming\n``for the world.''8 The social media image thus demands\nthat we trace, visualize, and analyze its encounters,\ncoherence, and negation with other images across dif-\nferent times, following the circumstances that give\nshape to its existence and operation within particular\nstream time(s).\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author declares that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding\nagency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nNotes\n1. My use of the term social media is restricted here to ``social\nawareness streams'' (SAS), characterized by their public\n(or personal\u00adpublic) nature of the communication, the\nbrevity of posted content, and a highly connected social\nspace (Naaman et al., 2010). As such, what I refer to here\nas the social media image denotes a particular type of\nimage that is taken, manipulated, and shared within\nsocial media awareness streams (natively uploaded\nimages) and is archived in a retrievable public or semi-\npublic database. In doing so, I am not accounting for\nthose contemporary social media platforms that are not\norganized as streams and that their images are not pre-\ndominantly created for and within a particular application\n(for example, platforms such as Pinterest, which is orga-\nnized around building collections that are not stream or\nreal-time oriented); nor do I refer to non-retrievable and\nnon-public images (i.e. apps like Snapchat that are orga-\nnized around a specific ephemeral logic).\n2. This is a rather general conception of ontology. For the\nspecific meaning of the term ``software ontology'' in infor-\n3. This description aligns and follows Star and Ruhleder's\n4. For example, Flickr and Pinterest recently incorporated\nvisual search mechanisms that automatically recognize\nvisual content in images and enable users to search their\ndatabase by image themes and concepts, or recognize par-\nticular items (i.e. the shape of clothing) and show similar\nitems the viewer might be interested in (Constine, 2014;\nPanzarino, 2014). Moreover, in addition to simple and\nnow most common face identification in digital cameras,\nface detection has found its way into popular services such\nas iPhoto, Picasa, Facebook, Instagram, Google\u00fe, etc.\n(Banerjee and Anderson, 2013). In Facebook, for example,\nfaces are not just detected but also automatically tagged\nand matched as they are uploaded into the stream\n5. This organizing principle of images as a ``group'' is a spe-\ncific choice, but one of many. Other perspectives could\nequally highlight, for example, the potential within big\ndatasets to trace the circulation of a single image across\ncollections, platforms, time, and space.\n6. This follows Heidegger's understanding of time as ``the\nhorizon of the understanding of being in terms of tempor-\nparadox'' of contemporary artistic compositions: ``Past\ntimes or imagined futures are no longer events strung\nalong history's chain or thread, but are actions that\noccurred, or might be imagined to have occurred, at a\nroughly equal temporal distance from us.''\n8.
