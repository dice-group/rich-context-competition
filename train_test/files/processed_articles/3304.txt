Over the past decade, Tiger Woods has emerged as\none of the most recognized professional athletes of all time.\nThis is no small feat as the game of golf has not always been\nsynonymous with members of minority populations. Instead,\nthe game was viewed by many as an exclusive and elitist\npastime, enjoyed primarily by affluent White males who\npossess the physical, social, and economic traits and attri-\nbutes required to access golfing facilities. Hence, it is no\nwonder that, during the early days of golf as an organized\nAmerican professional sport, minority groups such as\nAfrican Americans and females were systematically\nexcluded or denied active and direct participation. This was\nbecause of the fact that the game of golf is a club-driven\nsport. Membership and access to clubs were contingent on\nthe selection process. Sadly, other American professional\nsports such as baseball, basketball, and football also enforced\nselective participation restrictions, limiting minority partici-\npation during the early years of inception.\ncombined with civil rights activities had profound effects on\nAmerican professional sports. Desegregation in professional\nsport commenced, creating opportunities for minorities to\nparticipate equally, halfheartedly, or as \"tokens of jest.\" An\nearly example of such change took place at the 1963 San\nDiego Open. The Professional Golfers Association of\nAmerica (PGA) finally allowed the first African American to\ncompete in a PGA tour event, not for his ability but as a\nsponsor exemption. The golfer was world heavy-weight\nchampion Joe Lewis. This token of jest was perceived as\ndemeaning, yet it provided a pathway for future African\nAmericans to participate in professional golf tournaments.\nOthers included Charlie Sifford and Pete Brown. Sifford\nwon two tour events, one senior event, and was the first\nAfrican American to be inducted in the World Golf Hall of\nAfrican American to win a PGA-sanctioned event, the 1964\nWaco Turner Open. These trailblazers have afforded the\nopportunity for people of all races and color to see golf not\nas an exclusive and elitist pastime but as a game in which\nplaying and career opportunities abound for qualified indi-\nviduals. Golf is a technical sport requiring an extensive body\nof competencies before career opportunities can be fully\nexploited. Acquisition of such knowledge is often cost pro-\nhibitive for members of minority groups, which subsequently\nexcludes minorities from active participation and career\nexploration. However, in recent years, initiatives geared spe-\ncifically toward increasing minority participation have been\ndeveloped and implemented. One such initiative was under-\ntaken in 2008 with the University of Maryland, Eastern\nShore (UMES). The PGA granted UMES the right to offer\nthe coveted \"Golf Management University Program\" as one\nof its on-campus academic programs. The UMES is a histori-\ncally Black college. This PGA initiative with UMES repre-\nsented a profound departure from past practices. UMES\nwelcomed the inaugural class of aspiring PGA professionals\n1University of Central Florida, Orlando, USA\n2University of Memphis, Memphis,TN, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nDanaV.Tesone, Rosen College of Hospitality Management, University of\nEmail: dtesone@mail.ucf.edu\nIncreasing Minority Golf Participation\nThrough PGA Education Initiatives\nJill Fjelstul1, Leonard A.

The article continues by examining the PGAini-\ntiatives geared toward increasing minority participation in the\ngame. The golf management university program accreditation\nprocess is outlined with specific emphasis on the process\nundertaken by UMES. The article concludes with excerpts\nfrom an interview conducted with Dr. Ernest Boger, chairman\nand associate professor of the Hotel and Management\nDepartment, School of Business and Technology at UMES.\nThe interview revealed the process undertaken by UMES in\nits successful quest to become one of only 20 universities in\nthe United States to offer the PGA Golf Management\nUniversity Program. The information provided in this article\ncan be valuable to universities that want to add the PGA's\naccredited program to their academic curricula.\nMinority Golf Participation\nand Initiatives\nThe National Golf Foundation (NGF) provides relevant\ninformation on every aspect of the golf industry. The most\nrecent study on minority golfer participation was published\nby the NGF in 2003. In that year, the total number of golfers\nOf those 27 million golfers, approximately 5% were African\nAmericans, 4% were Asian Americans, and less than 4%\nwere Hispanic Americans (NGF, 2009). A more recent study\nin 2008 reported total golfer participation had increased to\n29 million. Unfortunately, statistics specific to minority golf\nparticipation were not recorded, but it could be assumed that\nsuch numbers would reveal low participation in relation to\nnonminority golf participation. In an effort to increase\nminority participation in the game, various programs and\nassociations have implemented golf-related initiatives. Two\nsuch initiatives were established by the World Golf\nAssociation and by the Bill Dickey Scholarship Association.\nThe World Golf Association established The \"First Tee\"\nProgram in 1997. The First Tee Program provides young\npeople between the ages of 8 to 18, from all backgrounds, an\nopportunity to develop life-enhancing values through golf\nand character education (The First Tee, 2009). The program's\nobjectives are to introduce golf to 3.5 million individuals to\nthe game over a 5-year period, to provide life skills experi-\nence at all its facilities, to expand the program to 140 com-\nmunities over the 5-year period, to establish a First Tee\nchapter in all 50 states, and to develop First Tee operations in\n90% of the top golf markets (The First Tee, 2009). Since its\ninception, more than 3 million children from minority groups\nhave participated in the program.\nThe Bill Dickey Scholarship Association (formerly the\nNational Minority Junior Golf Scholarship Association) was\nformally established in 1994 as a nonprofit organization.\nTheir goal was to assist minority college-bound students in\nachieving excellence through the game of golf. The associa-\ntion was the brainchild of its founder, Bill Dickey. During\nthe 1970s, Dickey envisioned a national organization com-\nposed of individuals and golf clubs committed to affording\nminorities the opportunity to participate in golf at the junior\nand college levels. The overall focus of the organization was\non young minority golfers. The goal was to increase minority\nparticipation in golf while pursuing an education through\nsupport and financial assistance (Dickey, 2009).\nThe PGA of America's Golf\nManagement University Program\nThe PGA Golf Management University Program, formally\ncalled the PGA Professional Golf Management Program, is\na 4.5-year structured educational program offered at 20 uni-\nversities nationwide. The program is designed to provide\nstudents with the knowledge and skills necessary for success\nin the golf industry. The program includes classroom stud-\nies, internship experiences, and player development (PGA,\n2009a). Ferris State University became the first PGA-\naccredited university programs. Table 1 depicts the school,\nthe academic unit in which the golf management program is\nlocated, and their respective maximum handicap entrance\nrequirement. Students graduating from accredited universi-\nties receive a baccalaureate degree on completion of the\ninstitution's academic requirements, the PGA's internship\nrequirements, and the playing ability test (PAT) mandates.\nEach graduate becomes a PGA professional on completion\nof their respective baccalaureate degree. Graduates typically\ngain employment as golf-teaching professionals, tournament\ndirectors, pro shop managers, or golf sales representatives.\nGraduates also gain employment in golf retail, media, mar-\nketing, or with golf associations.\nThe UMES PGA Golf Management\nUniversity Program and Interview\nThe PGA Golf Management University Program is open to all\nuniversity-bound students nationwide. The program at UMES\nhas special significance as it coincides with the PGA's effort\nto increase golf participation and golf career opportunities for\nminorities. Both the university and the PGA felt that they\ncould develop a symbiotic relationship and achieve their\nrespective goals of offering the PGA golf management pro-\ngram at a historically and predominantly Black college. The\naccreditation process was initiated in 2002 with full accredita-\ntion awarded in 2008. The authors were granted a telephone\ninterview with Dr. Boger in January 2009. The goal was to\ngain insight into UMES's successful quest in becoming 1 of\nonly 20 universities selected nationwide to acquire the PGA\naccreditation and to also be the first predominantly African\nAmerican university with such distinction.\nDr. Ernest Boger, chairman and associate professor of the\nHotel and Management Department, School of Business and\nTechnology at the UMES, was in his first 30 days at UMES\nwhen the university decided to formally pursue the PGA\nFjelstul et al. 3\nGolf Management University Program. The following are\nexcerpts from the interview with Dr. Boger.\nHow Did the Pursuit of the PGA\nAccreditation Begin?\nThe UMES is a land grant, historically Black college located\nin the small town of Princess Anne on the Eastern Shore of\nMaryland. In 2002, Dr. Thelma B. Thompson, President of\nUMES, wanted the university to become involved with the\ngolf industry. The university contacted the PGA and was sub-\nsequently provided a list of the accreditation requirements to\nthe university. On review of the university requirements, our\npresident decided that UMES would be proactive and develop\na framework that would allow us to exceed the PGA require-\nments. By 2004, the UMES Golf Academy opened, offering\nthe only year-round, indoor golf training facility in the state of\nMaryland with computer-assisted golf swing analysis equip-\nment and the short game Putt, Pitch, and Chip Center. The\nUMES Golf Academy became a unique offering among the\n35 golf courses located on the Eastern Shore. The PGA was\ninformed of the UMES Golf Academy and of UMES's com-\nmitment to golf education. The PGA began informal discus-\nsions with President Thompson about the PGA's Golf\nManagement University Program.\nWhatWas theTimeline for Receiving the\nAccreditation of the PGA Golf Management\nUniversity Program?\nFrom start to finish, the accreditation process lasted 3 years.\nAfter our informal discussions with the PGA, our administra-\ntors were given a list of requirements that had to be met prior\nto formal consideration by the PGA. Within 4 to 5 months, all\nrequirements had been met, and a formal proposal was sent to\nthe PGA. The goal of UMES was to exceed the expectations\nset forth by the PGA. By all accounts, they did. The specific\nrequirements were to secure full-time positions for an incom-\ning director of the program and for an internship coordinator,\nand a PGA golf professional to be employed in one of the\npositions. An administrative assistant position specific to the\nPGA program was also secured, an additional requirement for\neach university. The facility requirements were to designate\nan office area for the program, secure golf course and practice\narea access for students in the program, and have access to a\nlearning laboratory, including a model pro shop, club fitting,\nand club repair facilities. PGA representatives conducted a\nsite visit and were satisfied that all requirements were met.\nThe UMES became the 20th university in the country to\nreceive accreditation of the PGAGolf Management University\nProgram. UMES also became the first historically Black col-\nlege or university to receive the PGA accreditation. The first\nclass of PGA golf management students arrived on the UMES\nDidYou Hire Personnel Directly Responsible\nfor the PGA Golf Management University\nProgram at UMES?\nYes, this had the full support from the university's president.\nThe PGA requires three positions dedicated to each accredited\nprogram. The PGA requires a director to be in place\n1 year prior to the inaugural class of students. A full-time\nfaculty member was hired at UMES to fill that role. The PGA\nalso requires an internship coordinator to be in place 6 months\nprior to the start of the program. The internship coordinator\nmust be a graduate of a PGA professional golf management\nprogram. Hence, an internship coordinator was hired by\nUMES, thereby meeting all the requirements of the PGA.\nFinally, an administrative assistant was hired, completing the\npersonnel requirements mandated by the PGA. In addition,\nthe PGA requires that all personnel affiliated with a university\nprogram must attend a PGA Expo Show prior to the com-\nmencement of the program. This, too, was completed.\nTable 1.

The students will\nreceive a Bachelor of Science in Golf Management on\ncompletion of the program. The program is a comprehensive\ndegree program, integrating the curriculum requirements of\na hotel and restaurant management major with the knowl-\nedge base of the PGA's professional golf management pro-\ngram, including 16 months of structured internship\nexperience and a PAT. The PAT is mandated by the PGA.\nWereThere Any Issues or Concerns From the\nUniversityWhen Developing the Curriculum\nRequirements Mandated From the PGA?\nThe university has set policies in regard to proposing a new\ndegree program and curriculum. The process starts with\napproval by the faculty and concludes with approval by the\nstate of Maryland. We did run into a small issue, but it was\nresolved. Our goal was to offer a Bachelor of Science in\nGolf Management, but our curriculum proposal totaled 130\ncredit hours, 10 more than the customary 120 credit hours.\nUMES was required to make a special request to the state of\nMaryland to acquire a 130 credit-hour degree program,\nwhich was successfully awarded.\nWhat Is/Are the Enrollment Criteria Specific\nto the Golf Management Program at UMES?\nA student must verify a handicap of 12 or less to be consid-\nered as an incoming student in the golf management pro-\ngram at UMES. This is in addition to the regular academic\nrequirements for enrollment consideration. The PGA also\nrequires a player development program to be in place for\nstudents who either do not have a documented 12 handicap\nor less, or for those students who are having trouble passing\nthe mandated PAT. The player development program at\nUMES is devoted to PAT preparation, offering strategies in\nfull swing, short game, and game management. The player\ndevelopment program is designed to prepare students to suc-\ncessfully pass the PAT as early in the program as possible.\nThe program is offered with both classroom instruction and\ncoordinated practice and playing, and is conducted by a\nPGA member of the golf management staff. Once a student\nhas passed the PAT, they will no longer be required to par-\nticipate in the player development program. For those stu-\ndents who do not pass the PAT by their sophomore year,\nUMES offers an academic safety net. The curriculum is set\nup so that a student can transition toward a degree pursuit in\nhotel and restaurant management if it becomes clear that the\nPAT requirement may not be successfully completed.\nWhat IsYour FirstYear's Enrollment and\nWhat AreYour Enrollment Goals?\nThe goal for the 1st year was 25 students. We have 20 stu-\ndents. The demographic profile of the inaugural class is as\nfollows: 5 African Americans, 1 Korean, and 14 White.\nCurrently, there are no women enrolled in the UMES golf\nmanagement program. Eight of the students are on academic\nscholarships. Our goal is to have 100 students in the PGA\nprogram, which means that we have to add 25 students each\nyear. UMES is committed to enrolling a talented student\nbody from a variety of ethnic and geographic backgrounds.\nThe program is dedicated to supporting the PGA's objective\nof recruiting qualified minorities into each of its accredited\nuniversity programs. To help each accredited university with\nminority recruitment, the PGA provides scholarship monies\neach year. PGA diversity scholarship assistance is available\nfor African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanics, and\nfemales on a competitive basis. UMES will recruit nation-\nally for prospective students.\nDoYou Have ConcernsThat the Golf Industry\nIs Not Growing Fast Enough to Absorb\nGraduates?\nNo major concerns. The PGA guarantees employment for all\nstudents graduating from a PGA-accredited university pro-\ngram. UMES is happy that their students will all graduate\nwith PGA accreditation, status, and membership.\nWhatTypes of Employment Opportunities\nAre AssociatedWith PGA Accreditation?\nThere are many directions a graduate may take on receiving\nmembership in the PGA. Common pursuits include posi-\ntions in pro shop operations, golf course operations,\nand teaching the game of golf. There are also positions\nbeyond the golf course. Graduates may seek employment in\ncorporate and association management, manufacturing,\nsales, marketing, golf technology, course and club house\ndesign and development, research and development, mer-\nchandising, tournament operations, and public relations.\nWhat Facilities Are Available for UMES\nStudents Pursuing the Bachelor of Science in\nGolf Management?\nWe are privileged to have Great Hope Golf Course and\nNutters Crossing Golf Course as the official home courses\nFjelstul et al. 5\nfor the UMES program. Great Hope and Nutters Crossing\nwill be home to many of our golf management tournaments\nand will be used as learning laboratories for many of our\nwork experience activities. In addition, a model \"golf shop\"\nis provided as a learning laboratory at Nutters Crossing Golf\nCourse. The program will use the Nutters Crossing Golf\nCourse in many of our work experience activities and incor-\nporate budgeting, procurement, merchandising, and opera-\ntions procedures.\nCanYou Offer Advice for Other Academic\nPrograms inTheir Pursuit of the PGA's\nAccredited Golf Management University\nProgram?\nAbsolutely. We had full support of this pursuit from the\nPresident of UMES. Such support was instrumental in the\naccreditation process. We also sought not only to meet\nrequirements set forth for PGA-accredited programs but to\nexceed such expectations. We wanted the PGA to know that\nwe were 100% committed to securing accreditation.\nConclusion\nHistorically, the game of golf as a professional sport system-\natically excluded minority participation. However, in recent\nyears, several organizations have attempted to increase\nminority participation through targeted initiatives. One such\ninitiative is the PGA's Golf Management University Program\ngeared at preparing individuals for careers in the golf indus-\ntry. UMES provides an excellent example of how the pro-\ngram was implemented at a historically and predominantly\nBlack college. The university was successful in obtaining\nthe coveted accreditation due to several reasons.\nFirst and foremost was full institution support. The accred-\nitation solicitation process was spearheaded by the universi-\nty's president who proactively provided the necessary\nresources that would support the application process. This\ncommitment caught the attention of PGA officials. UMES\nwent a step further by exceeding PGA expectations, once the\napplication process for the program was underway. As a\nresult, they completed the formal application process in 4 to 5\nmonths. Many institutions undergo an application process of\nmore than 1 year. This short time frame underscores the\nnotion that support of the university president and the state of\nMaryland was crucial in the program development process at\nUMES. It also suggests that the PGA is supportive in expos-\ning minority groups to career opportunities in the game of\ngolf. UMES's successful quest in acquiring the golf manage-\nment accreditation also highlights the need for partnership\nbetween academic institutions and the golf community; that\nis, the UMES partnership with several area golf courses for\nthe practical PGA requirements. Finally, increasing minority\nparticipation in golf requires initiatives and organizations\ndesigned to expose members of minority populations to golf\nat an early age. Examples of such organizations include the\nFirst Tee and the Bill Dickey Scholarship Foundation. The\ncombination of early exposure, scholarships, and structured\neducational programs should increase minority participation\nin the game of golf in the foreseeable future. It will be inter-\nesting to see whether other historically Black colleges and\nuniversities pursue the PGA Golf Management University\nProgram. It will also be interesting to examine demographic\ncomposition of these programs to see whether members of\nminority groups are taking advantages of these golf educa-\ntional opportunities.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nDickey, B.
